A part of the II Corps of the Army of the Potomac, the regiment was engaged in many battles from Ball's Bluff to Petersburg, and suffered the tenth highest fatality rate amongst Federal regiments. The regiment was composed almost entirely of men from Worcester County, and was mustered in on July 12, 1861.

On October 21, it was engaged with the heaviest loss among all Federal regiments at the Battle of Ball's Bluff. In the spring of 1862, it was made a part of the II Corps of the Army of the Potomac and accompanied it during the Peninsular Campaign, being engaged at the Battles of Seven Pines, Savage's Station, and Glendale with modest losses. In April 1862, the 1st Company Massachusetts Sharpshooters was attached to the regiment, serving with it until the spring of 1863. Spending most of the summer at Harrison's Landing, it departed in August just in time to miss the Battle of Second Bull Run. The regiment then embarked upon the Maryland Campaign, where it was savagely flanked by the Confederates at the Battle of Antietam, losing over 50% of its 600 men. During the Battle of Fredericksburg, it was kept out of the main assault on Marye's Heights and suffered relatively few losses. The Battle of Gettysburg found the regiment engaged against the assaults of the Army of Northern Virginia on July 2 and 3, 1863, with heavy loss. By 1864, the regiment's strength had dwindled, but it still faced rigorous campaigning with action at The Battle of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, Cold Harbor, and the Siege of Petersburg. By June 22, the regiment could field only 75 officers and men. This small group was captured en masse that day when they were outflanked by a Confederate force on the Jerusalem Plank Road. The survivors and parolees mustered out of Federal service on July 26, 1864, with its recruits and re- enlistees being transferred to the 20th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry.  Casualties  During the war, the 15th Massachusetts Regiment sustained the 10th-highest number of men killed or fatally wounded in action among all 1,200 Federal regiments. Its losses at several engagements are as follows: * Ball's Bluff, Va., October 21, 1861: 40 killed or fatally wounded, 70 wounded, 202 captured (312 out of 650 engaged) * Antietam, Md., September 17, 1862: 104 killed or fatally wounded, 206 wounded, 14 captured (324 of 600 engaged) * Gettysburg, Pa., July 2–3, 1863: 37 killed or fatally wounded, 94 wounded, 24 captured (155 out of 239 engaged) * Wilderness, Va., May 5–6, 1864: 16 killed or fatally wounded, 51 wounded, 17 captured (of whom 6 died in prison) In sum, 14 officers and 227 enlisted men were killed or fatally wounded during the course of the war.

The organization describes itself as leading an awareness campaign against \\"Qadiani propaganda\\", a derogative term often used for Ahmadi Muslims. The academy also studies, and publishes on theological concepts such as Khatam an- Nabuwwah, or Seal of the Prophets which in its opinion describes the absolute finality of Prophet Muhammad. The organization is loosely affiliated with similar organizations around the world, particularly with those in Pakistan. Criticism In 2010, The Independent reported that the Khatme Nubuwwat Academy was inciting division between Ahmadis and Muslims. At the time, the website belonging to the Academy described Ahmadis as nothing but a gang of traitors, apostates and infidels. With reference to this, Akber Choudhry, a spokesman for the Academy stated, The words 'apostates' and 'infidels' are understood differently in English than in their Islamic theological sense, especially within the Urdu-speaking Muslims, and can be replaced by terms more sensitive to the current climate in which the connotations of these words have changed quite rapidly in the past few years . In 2018 an article in the New Statesman stated that \\"A cursory look at the website of the ‘Khatme Nubuwwat Academy’ displays the following language used to describe Ahmadi Muslims: “kafir” – a term that is intimidating with hostile connotations. The site also lists a quote allegedly taken from the poet Allama Muhammad Iqbal, stating, “Ahmadis are traitors both to Islam and to India”.\\" = In the media = After The Independent article, BBC and Channel 4 also picked up the story and alleged that pamphlets advocating the killing of Ahmadis had been distributed in South London. The Crown Prosecution Service decided that no crime had been committed and no charges were brought. An Ahmadiyya spokesperson said that a judicial review was being considered and Lord Avebury asked for an inquiry into the CPS decision. However, no judicial review or inquiry occurred. Avebury remarked that the threshold for prosecution was too high and questioned why only one case had been filed since the law came into being.

Sapphique was released in the US in December, 2010. Sapphique is also the name of the legendary prisoner who journeyed to escape. Plot summary The setting of Sapphique is divided between two main locations: \\"The Realm\\", a place of artificial harmony, and \\"Incarceron\\", a microscopic prison that contains a vast world, all controlled and monitored by an artificial intelligence. There is little advanced technology in The Realm, as the rulers of The Realm set humanity back to the 17th century. Finn, who escaped from Incarceron, believes The Realm is little different from Incarceron. The story starts off with Attia, who helped Finn while unable to escape herself. She acts as the assistant to a magician named the Dark Enchanter, whose real name is \\"Rix\\". She follows him on his tour before turning on him, leaving him to die, although he does survive. She originally became his assistant in order to acquire his glove, having previously belonged to Sapphique, the legendary Sapient who escaped from Incarceron. She then travels with Kerio, Finn's Oath Brother. During this journey, the duo fight a twelve-headed monster. They are then summoned by the A.I. running Incarceron to go to a location that contains a humanoid shell for the A.I. While traveling to this location, they encounter a nursery that allows them to contact Finn. The A.I. wants to escape itself in order to see the stars. Doing so, however, will leave the millions of prisoners inside to die. In The Realm, Finn is told by Claudia that he was originally Giles, a prince thought dead. He has flashes of memories but is unable to entirely remember. Following this, another person claims that they are Giles. The two are called before a council in order to determine who is actually Giles, where the council decides that the pretender is actually Giles and that Finn is to be executed for lying, despite Finn being the true Giles. The two engage in a duel, but Finn misses his stab for the imposter's heart. Finn and Claudia run away to the wardenry, which acts as a portal into Incarceron. From within this room, the two fend off the army of the Queen. Jared, Claudia's mentor, meets the two in the wardenry, having nearly been killed by an assassination plot. Jared knows more about the portal than them and begins working on getting it working. During this period, Rix, who survived his betrayal by Attia, takes on Kerio as an apprentice, after which Kerio reaches the humanoid shell. Rix attempts to kill Attia in revenge but is stopped by Kerio. Keiro decides to not give the glove to the A.I., putting it on himself. This results in Kerio trading places with Claudia, who is still in the wardenry. The A.I. running Incarceron recognizes Claudia as the Warden removed her from Incareron so she could become Queen. Kerio, now on the outside, is caught in the middle of a battle. The group captures Queen's son, forcing her to stop her assault. Some of the Queen's soldiers manage to get in by following a Steel Wolf, who act as the guards to the Warden. but fail to dislodge Finn and his group. The Realm is suddenly revealed to an illusion covering a decaying world following the machine that maintained the illusion losing power. Jared then takes the glove from Kerio and realizes that he was Sapphique. Jared, now Sapphique, opens a permanent portal between The Realm and Incarceron. Attia steps out of Incarceron through the portal for the first time and is awed by the stars. Finn and Sapphique then pledge to reform both the Realm and Incarceron. Inspiration and Origins Fisher said that as she was completing Incarceron, she knew that another book would be necessary to complete the story. > As I neared the end of Incarceron I realised there would be a sequel, but I > didn’t think it would make a trilogy. A pair of books was something I hadn’t > done before, so I was happy with that. Sapphique picks up a few months after > the earlier book ends, and I can’t say too much about the plot without > giving things away. But maybe escape is not the same thing as freedom, and > inside the prison a crazy king claims to own Sapphique’s Glove, an object of > great power that everyone, including the Prison itself, desperately wants. Setting As with the previous novel, the book is set over two areas: Incarceron and The Realm. =Incarceron= Incarceron is a futuristic prison - a living building that tortures the inhabitants inside. Its futuristic technology oversees all the inmates inside through glowing, red eyes, and tortures them with the hope of escape, an unattainable goal only a legendary figure has attained. Initially, the intent of Incarceron's creators, the Sapienti, was to incarcerate all the criminals in the world and repair their morals to form a perfect society, controlled with the help of the Prison entity 'Incarceron'. The prisoners and Sapienti inside were sealed off from the world in order to control all variables in this experiment, with the exception of the prison Warden to oversee the project. However, after years of isolation and the failure of the perfect society, those inside have no way to seek help or escape when the Warden abandons the experiment's aims. =The Realm= The Sapienti created Incarceron during a time of advanced technology and discovery. However, since then, King Endor released a royal decree that Time would be \\"stopped\\" in order for humanity to survive, and now the Realm is trapped in the 17th century. The King justified that they were making a world \\"free from the anxiety of change\\". The Protocol prevents the development of science and evolution, and has since hindered Sapienti, and provided problems against freeing those in Incarceron. Characters *Finn (Keiro's Oath- Brother) (Giles) *Claudia Arlexa *John Arlex (Warden of Incarceron) *Keiro (Finn's Oath-Brother) *Attia *Rix (Dark Enchanter) *Jared (Sapphique) *Queen Sia (Queen of the Realm) * Incarceron (The living prison) *Caspar (Sia's Son) (Earl of the Realm) =The Sapienti= The Sapienti are the learned people in the Realm and in Incarceron. Incarceron was created by the Sapienti. Several of the creators entered Incarceron with the intent of passing knowledge to the inhabitants and ensuring the success of the experiment. Outside of Incarceron, the Sapienti are greatly respected for their knowledge and often are allowed to breach protocol. They have a mother tongue, which only Sapients can speak. It is also the mother-tongue of the prison. They wear special robes to distinguish themselves from others. Within Incarceron, there are very few Sapienti remaining. Cover The hardback cover shows an ornate golden keyhole. Through the keyhole, stars can be seen. This is a reference to Finn's escape from the prison to the outside world where he could see the stars. The paperback shows two golden swans attached by chains around their necks and decorated with diamonds. Critical reception Reception so far has been mostly positive, although many reviews say that this sequel is not as good as its predecessor. One review said: > Fisher concludes her high-intensity, mind-bending duology in this sequel to > Incarceron. She further explores themes of reality, illusion, and freedom > without losing her intensely original world-building and authentic > characters. The bittersweet conclusion fits perfectly...

The screenplay, written by Hossein Amini, is based on James Sallis's 2005 novel Drive. The film stars Ryan Gosling as an unnamed Hollywood stunt driver who moonlights as a getaway driver. He quickly grows fond of his neighbor, Irene (Carey Mulligan), and her young son, Benicio. When her debt-ridden husband, Standard (Oscar Isaac), is released from prison, the two men take part in what turns out to be a botched million-dollar heist that endangers the lives of everyone involved. The film co-stars Bryan Cranston, Christina Hendricks, Ron Perlman, and Albert Brooks. Producers Marc Platt and Adam Siegel optioned the source novel after Siegel read a review from Publishers Weekly. Adapting the book proved to be challenging for Amini, as it had a nonlinear narrative. Gosling, one of Platt's top casting choices, eventually signed on for the lead, as he wanted to star in an action-oriented project. Gosling played a pivotal role in the film's production, which included hiring Refn as director and Beth Mickle as production designer. Newton Thomas Sigel oversaw the principal photography, which started on September 25, 2010, was shot on location in various parts of Los Angeles, and ended on November 12. Before its September 2011 release, Drive had been shown at a number of film festivals, including the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, where it received a standing ovation. Refn won the festival's Best Director Award. The film was praised for its direction, cinematography, performances (particularly Gosling and Brooks’), visuals, action sequences, and musical score; however, some critics were appalled by its graphic violence and found that potentially detrimental to the film's box office success. Several critics listed Drive as one of the best films of 2011, including the National Board of Review. Its honors include a nomination for Best Sound Editing at the 84th Academy Awards. Plot An unnamed Driver works as a mechanic, a stunt double, a stunt driver, and a criminal-for-hire getaway car driver in Los Angeles, California. His jobs are all managed by auto shop owner Shannon, who persuades Jewish mobsters Bernie Rose and Nino to purchase a car for the Driver to race. Driver meets his new neighbor, Irene, and grows close to her and her young son, Benicio. Their relationship is interrupted when Irene's husband, Standard Gabriel, is released from prison. After initial awkwardness, Driver and Standard become friends. Standard owes protection money from his time in prison and is assaulted by Albanian gangster Cook, who demands that Standard rob a pawnshop for $40,000 to pay off the debt. Cook forces Benicio to pocket a bullet as a symbol that he and his mother are in danger. Upon finding this out, Driver offers to act as the getaway driver for the pawnshop robbery. While Driver is waiting outside the pawnshop with Cook's accomplice, Blanche, the store owner kills Standard. Driver and Blanche are then pursued by another car. Driver hides with Blanche in a motel where he learns that the pawnshop owner claims Standard was the sole perpetrator and no money was stolen. Driver threatens Blanche when she lies about being oblivious to the second car. She admits that the bag contains a million dollars, and she and Cook planned to re-steal the money for themselves using the car that chased them. While Blanche is in the restroom, she is killed with a shotgun by one of Cook's henchmen; Driver fatally stabs the gunman before killing another one with the shotgun. At the auto shop, Shannon offers to hide the money, but Driver brushes him off. He hunts down Cook in a strip club, threatens to kill him, and force-feeds him the bullet that he had given to Benicio earlier. Cook reveals that Nino was behind the robbery. Driver calls him and Nino dismisses his offer of the money, instead sending a hitman to the Driver's apartment building. Driver tells an angry Irene about his involvement with her husband's death. When the pair enter an elevator, the Driver notices a hitman. Driver kisses Irene, and then brutally beats the hitman to death, leaving her horrified. Knowing that someone may have leaked Driver's whereabouts for Nino to know his address, the Driver confronts Shannon, who reveals that he also unwittingly mentioned Irene. Driver tells Shannon to flee. At his pizzeria, Nino reveals to Bernie that a low-level Philadelphia wise guy from the \\"East Coast mob\\" stashed the money at the pawnshop with plans to use the money to set up a new operation. Since anyone tied to the robbery could lead the East Coast Italian Mafia to them, they need to kill everyone involved. Bernie warns Nino that nobody steals from the Italian Mob. Nino is angry because the Italian Mob has patronized and insulted him for being Jewish. He convinces Bernie to follow his plan. Bernie murders Cook, as he is the sole witness to their agreement. After Shannon refuses to divulge the whereabouts of the Driver at the auto shop, Bernie slashes his forearm with a straight razor, killing him. Enraged at finding Shannon's corpse at the auto shop, Driver, disguising himself with a rubber stuntman's mask, follows Nino from the pizzeria to the Pacific Coast Highway and rams his car onto a beach; he chases Nino towards the ocean and drowns him. He phones Irene and tells her that he will not return, but the short period of knowing her and Benicio was the best part of his life. The Driver meets Bernie, who promises that Irene will be safe in exchange for the money. Upon giving him the money, Bernie stabs him in the stomach, before Driver brandishes his own knife and stabs Bernie to death. Driver survives and drives away, while Bernie lays in the parking lot next to the cash. Irene, having second thoughts, knocks on Driver's apartment door but no one answers. Since Bernie was the last living person to know of Irene's existence, she is now safe forever.  Cast  * Ryan Gosling as The Driver * Carey Mulligan as Irene * Bryan Cranston as Shannon * Albert Brooks as Bernie Rose * Oscar Isaac as Standard Gabriel * Christina Hendricks as Blanche * Ron Perlman as Nino * Kaden Leos as Benicio *James Biberi as Cook Production =Development= The novel Drive by James Sallis was published in 2005. Producers Marc Platt and Adam Siegel of Marc Platt Productions optioned the novel after Siegel read a review in Publishers Weekly. The driver intrigued Siegel because he was \\"the kind of character you rarely see anymore he was a man with a purpose; he was very good at one thing and made no apologies for it\\". The character interested Platt, because he reminded him of movie heroes he looked up to as a child, characters typically portrayed by Steve McQueen or Clint Eastwood. Hossein Amini adapted the novel for the screen. He felt it was a rare book to receive from a studio because it was short, gloomy, and like a poem. Since the novel does not present a linear story, but has many flashbacks and jumps around in time, Amini found the adaptation challenging. He felt the non-linear structure made it \\"a very tricky structure\\" for a feature film. A film adaptation of Drive was first announced in early 2008, with Neil Marshall set to direct what was being described as \\"an L.A.-set action mystery\\", planned as a starring vehicle for Hugh Jackman. Universal Studios, which had tried to make a film version for some time, was also on board. By February 2010, Marshall and Jackman were no longer attached to the project. Producer Marc E. Platt contacted actor Ryan Gosling about Drive early on. Platt explained: \\"I have this list that I've created of very talented individuals whose work inspire me writers, directors, actors whom I have to work with before I go onto another career or do something else with my life.\\" Near the top of Platt's list was Gosling, who, despite having starred in several films of diverse genres, had never starred in anything like Drive. He had always been interested in doing an action-oriented project. Gosling said that he had been put off by the many current action genre films that focused more on stunts instead of characters. But he responded to Platt about two days later, as he was strongly attracted to the plot and the leading role of the unnamed driver. He thought the story had a \\"very strong character\\" at its core, and a \\"powerful\\" romance. In an interview with Rotten Tomatoes, Gosling was asked what had attracted him to the film, and whether he had read the earlier script when Jackman and director Neil Marshall were attached to it. He said: > I think that might be the original one I read. I read a few drafts. I read > one as well where he wasn't a stunt driver at all, which was a newer draft > maybe that's the one Hugh Jackman had; I'm not sure exactly. Basically when > I read it, in trying to figure out who would do something like this, the > only way to make sense of this is that this is a guy that's seen too many > movies, and he's started to confuse his life for a film. He's lost in the > mythology of Hollywood and he's become an amalgamation of all the characters > that he admires. When Gosling signed on for the leading role, he was allowed to choose the director, a first in his career. The actor chose Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn, whose work he admired. He said, \\"It had to be [him]. There was no other choice.\\" When Refn read the first screenplay for Drive, he was more intrigued by the concept of a man having a split personality, being a stuntman by day and a getaway driver at night, than the plot of the story. Believing that the director might be intimidated by the script, as it was unlike anything he had done before, Gosling had concerns about whether Refn wanted to participate. Refn took on the project without hesitation. =Casting= When casting roles in his films, Refn does not watch casting tapes or have his actors audition for him. Instead, he meets with them, and casts them on the spot if he feels they are right. Drive was the first film that British actress Carey Mulligan signed on to do after being nominated for an Academy Award for her role in An Education (2009), which was directed by Lone Scherfig, also a Danish filmmaker. (Scherfig used to babysit Refn when he was a child, and they have become good friends). At the time of Mulligan's casting, Refn had not seen An Education. But his wife was a big fan of the film and Mulligan's performance, and she urged him to cast her. In the original script, the character was a Hispanic woman named Irina. The character was changed to Irene after Mulligan was cast; Refn said that he \\"couldn't find any actress that would click with [him] personally\\". While working on the film, Refn had some cast and production members move in temporarily with him, his wife and two daughters in their home in Los Angeles. This included Carey Mulligan and Hossein Amini, the screenwriter. This enabled them to be immersed in the film. Refn and Amini made significant changes to the original script during this time. thumb Bryan Cranston plays the role of Shannon. Refn knew he wanted to cast Cranston, as he was a fan of his work in the TV series Breaking Bad. Knowing Cranston had other opportunities, Refn asked the actor how he would like to develop the role. After not hearing back, Refn called him; Cranston was just then writing the pros and cons of doing Drive for himself. Moved by Refn's interest, Cranston accepted the part. Christina Hendricks plays the small role of Blanche. \\"Trying to work in a more reality arena for a character like that,\\" Refn originally auditioned porn stars for Blanche. He was unable to find anyone with the necessary acting talent. After meeting with Hendricks, he decided to cast her as he felt her persona would click with the character. Albert Brooks plays the foul-mouthed, morose Bernie Rose. When Refn suggested him, Gosling agreed, but thought the actor might not want to play a character who is violent and sullen, or appear in a film that he did not work on himself. Brooks accepted the role to go against type, and because he loved that Bernie was not a cliché. > There are six people you could always get to play this kind of part, and I > like that the director was thinking outside of the box. For me, it was an > opportunity to act outside the box. I liked that this mobster had real > style. Also, he doesn't get up in the morning thinking about killing people. > He's sad about it. Upset about it. It's a case of, 'Look what you made me > do.' Nino, a key villain, is portrayed by Ron Perlman, one of the last actors to join the cast. Refn said, \\"The character of Nino was originally not particularly interesting, so I asked Ron why he wanted to be in my movie when he's done so many great films. When Perlman said, 'I always wanted to play a Jewish man who wants to be an Italian gangster', and I asked why, and he said, 'because that's what I am – a Jewish boy from New York', well, that automatically cemented it for me.\\" Oscar Isaac portrays a Latino convict named Standard, who is married to Irene and is released from prison a week after Irene meets The Driver. Finding the role somewhat unappealing, he developed the archetypal character into something more. He said of the role: > As soon as I sat down with Nicolas, he explained this universe and world of > the story, so we made the character into someone interested in owning a > restaurant, someone who made some wrong decisions in his life, ending up in > a bad place. By making 'Standard' more specific and more interesting, we > found that it made the story that more compelling. =Filming and cinematography= The film was made on a production budget of about $15 million and shot in various parts of Los Angeles, beginning on September 25, 2010. Locations were picked by Refn while Gosling drove him around the city at night. At the director's request, Los Angeles was picked as the shooting location due to budget constraints. Refn moved into a plush Los Angeles home and insisted that the cast members and screenwriter Amini move in with him. They would work on the script and film all day, then watch films, edit, or drive at night. Refn asked that the editing suite be placed in his home as well. With a shooting script of 81 pages, Refn and Gosling continued to trim down dialogue during filming. The opening chase scene, involving Gosling's character, was filmed primarily by Refn within the car's interior. In an interview, he said he intended for this scene to emulate the feeling of a \\"diver in an ocean of sharks,\\" and never left the vehicle during the car chase so that the audience can see what's happening from the character's point of view. Tight on money and time, he shot the scene in two days. With two different set-ups prepared in the car, the director found it difficult to have mobility with the camera, so he would switch the camera to two additional set- ups nearby. As downtown Los Angeles had been rejuvenated, Refn avoided certain areas to maintain the novel's gloomy atmosphere. The scene was shot at low angles with minimal light. The elevator sequence was shot without dialogue. Refn explained: Before shooting the head-smashing scene, Refn spoke to Gaspar Noé and asked him how he had done a similar scene in his film Irréversible (2002). Crossing the line from romance to violence, the scene begins with the Driver and Irene kissing tenderly. What they share is really a goodbye kiss. The Driver becomes a kind of \\"werewolf,\\" violently stomping the hit man's head in. Irene sees the Driver in a new light. Of this scene Refn said: > Every movie has to have a heart – a place where it defines itself – and in > every movie I've made there's always a scene that does that. On Drive, it > was hard for me to wrap my head around it. I realized I needed to show in > one situation that driver is the hopelessly romantic knight, but he's also > completely psychotic and is willing to use any kind of violence to protect > innocence. But that scene was never written. As I was going along, it just > kind of popped up. In March 2012, Interiors, an online journal concerned with the relationship between architecture and film, published an issue that discussed how space is used in this scene. The issue highlights Refn's use of constricted space and his way of creating a balance between romance and violence. Refn shot Drive digitally with an Arri Alexa camera. Using the Arri Alexa camera, cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel shot the film digitally. According to executive producer David Lancaster, the film has abundant, evocative, intense images of Los Angeles that are not often seen. \\"From the little seen back streets of downtown LA to the dry arid outposts on the peaks of the desert landscape surrounding it, Siegel has re-imagined an LA all the way down to the rocky cliffs by the sea.\\" Car scenes were filmed with a \\"biscuit rig,\\" a camera car rig developed for the film Seabiscuit (2003). It allowed stunt driver Robert Nagle to steer the car, freeing Gosling to concentrate on acting. Consistent with Refn's usual visual style, wide-angle lenses were used extensively by cinematographer Sigel, who avoided hand-held camera work. Preferring to keep the film more \\"grounded\\" and authentic, he also avoided the use of computer-generated imagery (CGI). Budget restrictions were also a factor in this decision. Although many stunt drivers are credited, Gosling did some stunts himself, after completing a stunt driving car crash course. During the production, Gosling re-built the 1973 Chevrolet Malibu used in the film, taking it apart and putting it back together. Filming concluded on November 12, 2010. Beth Mickle was hired as the film's production designer on Gosling's recommendation; they had worked together on 2006's Half Nelson. Prior to filming, Mickle supervised a crew of 40, routinely working 16- to 18-hour days. This was her most expensive film to date, and Mickle felt freer since \\"there was another zero added to the budget,\\" compared to that of Half Nelson. The crew built the Driver's apartment building, which included a hallway and elevator that linked his unit to Irene's. Mickle also built a strip club set and Bernie Rose's apartment in an abandoned building. Turning a \\"run-of-the- mill\\" Los Angeles auto body shop into a grandiose dealership was one of the most challenging tasks. Painting the walls an electric blue color, she filled the showroom with vintage cars. While Drive is set in the present day, it has a 1980s atmosphere, underlined by the vehicles, music, and clothes, and by the architecture. The parts of the city seen in the Valley and near downtown Los Angeles are cheap stucco and mirrored glass; the film excludes buildings constructed more recently. Drab background settings include the Southern California commercial strip. As the Los Angeles Times pointed out, whenever gleaming buildings are shown, it is because they are being seen from a distance. Refn shot those scenes from a helicopter at night in Bunker Hill, Los Angeles. Music Refn chose Johnny Jewel of Desire and the Chromatics to score the film. He wanted electronic music and to have it be abstract, on occasion, so viewers can see things from the Driver's perspective. As Refn was going through mixer Jewel's catalog, he picked out \\"Under Your Spell\\" and \\"Tick of the Clock\\" because he thought of Drive being a fairy tale. During Drives climax, \\"A Real Hero\\"'s keynote melody, about becoming \\"a real human being, and a real hero\\", refrains because that is when the Driver displays both those characteristics. At first, Jewel worried that \\"Under Your Spell\\" might be too literal, but soon realized it is used in Drive \\"in the exact same way that I was feeling it when I wrote it. He definitely got the nuance of the song, and understood what it was supposed to mean, and he wanted to give that emotion to the viewer, that same feeling.\\" Thinking of music in terms of basic elements, Jewel would tell the director that for certain scenes, it should not have bass since, as an earth tone, it is usually used for a more emotional or ominous part. Jewel thought the music should be in the upper register and relaxing for the \\"dreamlike\\" scene. To help himself with the music composition process, and to conjure up melodies, the producer would highlight many phrases from the novel, then print those words in large font, and hung them on his walls or draw pictures during viewings of Drive. Although Jewel's music was used in the score, at the last minute the studio hired composer Cliff Martinez to imitate the style and feel of Jewel's bands Chromatics and Glass Candy. Refn gave him a sampling of songs he liked and asked Martinez to emulate the sound, resulting in \\"a kind of retro, 80ish, synthesizer europop\\". Editor Mat Newman suggested Drives opening credits song: \\"Nightcall\\" by French electronic musician Kavinsky. Most of its ethereal electronic-pop score was composed by Martinez. Refn was a particular fan of his ambient music on the Sex, Lies, and Videotape soundtrack. The score contains tracks with vintage keyboards and bluntly descriptive titles. Jewel reworked his unused soundtrack for the film into Themes for an Imaginary Film, the debut album by his side-project Symmetry. A re-scored soundtrack for the film was produced for the BBC by Zane Lowe for its television broadcast in October 2014. The soundtrack included original music from Chvrches, Banks, Bastille, Eric Prydz, SBTRKT, Bring Me the Horizon, The 1975 and Laura Mvula. 'Track listing'Reception Drive (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) was released on CD on September 27, 2011 by Lakeshore Records. Prior to that, owing to viral reviews such as those found on Twitter, the soundtrack sold well on iTunes, climbing as high as number four on the sales charts. The album was released on vinyl in June 2012, by Mondo. The nineteen-track album has amassed positive reviews. James Verniere of the Boston Herald graded it an \\"A\\", stating, \\"The cool crowd isn't just watching Drive; they're listening to it, too ... The Drive soundtrack is such an integral part of the experience of the film, once you see it, you can't imagine the film without it.\\" AllMusic reviewer James Christopher Monger selected opening track \\"Nightcall\\", \\"I Drive\\", \\"Hammer\\" and \\"Bride of Deluxe\\" as soundtrack's highlights. Mayer Nissim of Digital Spy gave it a four out of five star rating, finding it as important as the film itself. She stated the album, beginning with non-Martinez songs instead of mixing it up for a more enjoyable listening experience, cost it a star. In September 2016, Lakeshore and Invada Records released a fifth anniversary special edition pressing of the soundtrack, featuring new liner notes and artwork. That same month, Johnny Jewel, College, Electric Youth, and Cliff Martinez discussed the impact of the soundtrack and film on their lives and contemporary music culture. Jewel told Aaron Vehling that Drives \\"blend of sonic and visual nostalgia with a contemporary spin is always deadly.\\" The soundtrack was listed on Spin magazine's list of 40 Movie Soundtracks That Changed Alternative Music.

In November 2010, FilmDistrict acquired North American distribution rights. The owners were so eager to get their hands on Drive, they started negotiating to buy it before seeing any footage, believing it could appeal to people who enjoy a genre movie, as well as the arthouse crowd. The film had a release date of September 16, 2011, in the United States. The film premiered on May 20, in competition at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. At its first showing the film received abundant praise and \\"some of the best responses of the festival,\\" but Xan Brooks of The Guardian, who gave it a positive review, said it \\"can't win, won't win\\" Cannes's top prize. Brooks explained that \\"[I]t's too self- consciously retro, too much a series of cool, blank surfaces as opposed to a rounded, textured drama,\\" but said that it was his \\"guilty pleasure\\" of the 2011 competition, labeling it an enjoyable affair. He said, > Over the past 10 days we've witnessed great art and potent social > commentary; the birth of the cosmos and the end of the world. Turns out what > we really wanted all along was a scene in which a man gets his head stomped > in a lift. They welcome it in like a long-lost relation. The film was greeted with hoots and howls of joy from the media, with viewers cheering on some of the scenes featuring extreme violence. Drive received a 15-minute standing ovation from the crowd. The festival awarded Refn best director for Drive. Drive was screened at the Los Angeles Film Festival (LAFF) on June 20 at its gala screenings program. It was among more than 200 feature films, short projects, and music videos, from more than 30 countries, to be shown during the festival. After Red Dogs release date was pushed up by several days, Drive replaced it as the Melbourne International Film Festival's closing night film. The film was also screened during FilmDistrict's studio panel presentation at the San Diego Comic-Con function. A secret screening for Drive was held at London's Empire Big Screen during the middle of August. In September, Drive screened as a special presentation during the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival, alongside another film starring Gosling, The Ides of March. Reception =Critical response= Director Nicolas Winding Refn at the film's presentation at the 2011 Deauville American Film Festival Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 92% based on 265 reviews, and an average rating of 8.29/10. The site's critical consensus states, \\"With its hyper-stylized blend of violence, music, and striking imagery, Drive represents a fully realized vision of arthouse action.\\" Metacritic, another review aggregator, gave it a score of 78 out of 100, based on 43 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". It was one of the highest-ranked, and most-featured, films on critics' year-end top 10 lists. It ranked as fourth-best film of the year, behind The Tree of Life, The Artist, and Melancholia on Metacritic's tally of top 10 lists. Drive was picked as the best film of the year by: Peter Travers of Rolling Stone, Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times, James Rocchi of BoxOffice, Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out (New York), Neil Miller of Film School Rejects, Mark Russell of The Oregonian, and a staff critic from Empire magazine. The writers for the film magazine Empire listed Drive as their number one film of 2011. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film 4 out of 4 stars, declaring that Drive was \\"a brilliant piece of nasty business,\\" and that \\"Refn is a virtuoso, blending tough and tender with such uncanny skill that he deservedly won the Best Director prize at Cannes.\\" Travers also said, \\"Prepare to be blown away by Albert Brooks. Brooks' performance, veined with dark humor and chilling menace (watch him with a blade), deserves to have Oscar calling.\\" The Wall Street Journals Joe Morgenstern also praised Brooks's performance, calling his villainous performance \\"sensational.\\" James Rocchi of The Playlist gave the film an \\"A\\" letter grade, and wrote that \\"Drive works as a great demonstration of how, when there's true talent behind the camera, entertainment and art are not enemies but allies.\\" Rocchi placed Drive as his number one film of 2011. Movielines Stephanie Zacharek complimented the film's action and wrote that it \\"defies all the current trends in mainstream action filmmaking. The driving sequences are shot and edited with a surgeon's clarity and precision. Refn doesn't chop up the action to fool us into thinking it's more exciting than it is.\\" She also admired Refn's skill in handling the film's violence, and the understated romance between Gosling and Mulligan. Her score for the film is 9.5/10. Drive was Roger Ebert's seventh best film of 2011. In praising the film, he wrote, \\"Here is a movie with respect for writing, acting, and craft. It has respect for knowledgeable moviegoers.\\" Like Zacharek, Ebert admired the film's action sequences, which were practically made and did not rely on CGI effects. Anthony Lane wrote in The New Yorker that Drives violence was far too graphic, and this ultimately was a detriment to the film. Referring to the violence, he said, \\"In grabbing our attention, he diverts it from what matters. The horror lingers and seeps; the feelings are sponged away.\\" Michael Philips of the Chicago Tribune felt similarly, and said that although he enjoyed the film in the early sections, it became \\"one garishly sadistic set piece after another\\". Phillips thought the film relied too much on \\"stylistic preening\\" and did not have enough substance. In 2014, The Huffington Post included Drive on its list of 8 Movies From The Last 15 Years That Are Super Overrated, with Bill Bradley criticizing the low amount of dialogue by Gosling's character and writing that \\"Refn spends all 100 minutes trying to convince you that he has a cool iPod playlist.\\" Complex magazine criticized the film for whitewashing the character of Irene, who was a Latina in the source novel. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a score of \\"C−\\"; this was attributed to audiences feeling tricked, having expected more driving action based on the marketing. =Style and inspiration= Andrew O'Hehir of Salon magazine described Drive as a \\"classic Los Angeles heist-gone-wrong story,\\" that \\"isn't trying to outdo Bullitt or get the next assignment in The Fast and the Furious franchise\\". O'Hehir also described homages to \\"Roger Corman's B-movie aesthetic and the glossy Hollywood spectacles of Michael Mann\\". Steven Zeitchik of the Los Angeles Times examined themes in the characters of \\"loyalty, loneliness and the dark impulses that rise up even when we try our hardest to suppress them\\". Reuters Nick Vinocur described a series of comic gore, resulting in \\"a bizarre concoction ... reminiscent of David Lynch's Mulholland Drive ... Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, and [with] angst-laden love scenes that would not be out of place in a Scandinavian drama\\". Christopher Hawthorne, also from the Los Angeles Times, has compared it to the works of Walter Hill, John Carpenter, Nathanael West, J. G. Ballard, and Mike Davis. According to Refn, Drive is dedicated to filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky and includes shades of Jodorowsky's existentialism. Drive has been described as a tough, hard-edged, neo-noir, art house feature, extremely violent and very stylish, with European art and grindhouse influences. Drive also refers to 1970s and 1980s cult hits such as The Day of the Locust (1975) and To Live and Die in L.A. (1985). Other influences can be seen in the neon-bright opening credits and the retro song picks\\"a mix of tension-ratcheting synthesizer tones and catchy club anthems that collectively give the film its consistent tone\\". Drives title sequence is hot-pink, which was inspired by Risky Business (1983). Refn has also indicated that the film's romance was partly inspired by the films of writer-director John Hughes. Refn's inspiration for Drive came partly from reading Grimms' Fairy Tales, and his goal was to make \\"a fairy tale that takes Los Angeles as the background,\\" with The Driver as the hero. To play with the common theme of fairy tales, The Driver protects what is good while at the same time killing degenerate people in violent ways. Refn said Drive turns into a superhero film during the elevator scene when The Driver kills the villain. The director said he was also inspired by films such as Point Blank (1967), Two-Lane Blacktop (1971), The Driver (1978), and Thief (1981). Jean-Pierre Melville's crime productions influenced the cinematography. Amini's script imposes \\"a kind of sideways moral code,\\" where even those who comply with it are almost never rewarded for their efforts, as seen when The Driver helps Standard because of concern for Irene and her son. In their vehicles, the characters not only make escapes or commit murder, but try to find peace and search for romance. The Driver has been compared to the Man With No Name, a character Clint Eastwood portrayed in the Sergio Leone western, because he almost never speaks, communicating mostly non-verbally. The Driver's meager dialogue is not designed to present him as tough, but to soften him. Refn chose to give The Driver very little dialogue and have him drive around listening to synth-pop music, taking control when it counts. Peter Debruge of Variety opined that what The Driver lacks in psychology, he makes up through action and stylish costuming. The Driver's wardrobe, in particular the satin jacket with the logo of a golden scorpion on the back, was inspired by the band KISS, and Kenneth Anger's 1964 experimental film Scorpio Rising. Refn sees the former as the character's armor, and the logo as a sign of protection. According to reviewer Peter Canavese, the jacket is a reference to the fable of The Scorpion and the Frog, mentioned in the film, which evokes its use in the Orson Welles film Mr. Arkadin. =Box office= Drive grossed $78.1–81.4 million worldwide. In North America, the film grossed a total of $35.1 million. The film opened in North America earning $11.3 million on the weekend of September 16, 2011, and played at 2,866 theaters. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"C–\\" on an A+ to F scale. It was one of four wide releases that opened that weekend, and came in second.

Nedjeljni is principally concerned with life, culture, politics and style. Founded by Tomislav Wruss in 2003http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/nedjeljni-jutarnji-list-od-2-ozujka-na- kioscima/121703.aspx in the long tradition of Croatian Sunday papers such as Nedjeljna Dalmacija, it was brasher and less polite than the daily edition of Jutarnji. Nedjeljni typically publishes fewer political and more urban-tabloid and human interest stories than its daily counterpart. The approach is more populist and entertaining, yet it has also been a platform for serious debate and important crusading issues. Recent development  Nedjeljni has undergone a visual re-design since June 2010. The number of pages has been expanded to about 90, in order to match the volume of Sunday papers in Britain or the U.S. Numerous columnists have been added, and now include the literary critic and essayist Igor Mandić, leading web entrepreneur Nenad Bakic, actress and screenwriter Jelena Veljača, editor-in-chief of Forbes Croatia, Viktor Vresnik and culinary expert Rene Bakalović. Nedjeljni also launched a weekly food supplement, Dobra Hrana, with 10 pages of cooking tips and features on dining culture. The paid circulation figures have been increasing in recent months, and the title currently outsells the daily edition of Jutarnji. Notable stories  In September 2010, Nedjeljni launched a series of investigative features on the Croatian meat industry, exposing the systematic failure of inspections and border controls.http://www.jutarnji.hr/vara-se-na- analizama--uvozi-se-staro-meso--a-mesnice-imaju-katastrofalne-higijenske- uvjete/883580/ The series drew sharp criticism from government officials and industry leaders, but Jutarnji continued publishing until the government opened a hotline and launched a series of investigation.http://www.jutarnji.hr/afera-meso--u-sest-dana-cak-300-prijava- na--mesofon-/889211/ In October 2010, the paper published a shocking feature on the Croatian shadow economy, which by some estimates represents about 30% of the country's GDP. The feature was widely cited and brought about a change in the legal system in order to battle shadow economy. On its March 2, 2011 cover, the paper published an exclusive story on the corruption in the European parliament involving the Slovenian, Romanian and Austrian representatives. Also, on January 3, 2010, Nedjeljni published one of the first articles on Fimi-media, a company that was allegedly involved in a corruption scandal that led to the arrest of former Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader.http://www.net.hr/crnakronika/page/2010/01/02/0173006.html References External links *Official website Publications established in 2003 Weekly newspapers published in Croatia Croatian-language newspapers Mass media in Zagreb Newspaper supplements 2003 establishments in Croatia ","title":"Nedjeljni Jutarnji"},{"id":"30273609","text":"Evan Kaufmann (born October 31, 1984) is a German-American former professional ice hockey forward who played in the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL). Playing career Kaufmann, who is Jewish, was born in Plymouth, Minnesota and graduated from Robbinsdale Armstrong High School at Plymouth in 2003. His great-grandparents were murdered during the Holocaust. At the University of Minnesota, Kaufmann played on the Golden Gophers hockey team and studied accounting at the Carlson School of Management. Kaufmann was a Western Collegiate Hockey Association scholar-athlete pick all four years at Minnesota.

Kaufmann admits that his teammates are very curious about him being Jewish and often ask him questions. Kaufmann told the UK's Daily Mail: \\"I didn't have to think hard about it. It is a great honour but it will also be a very emotional moment for me when I hear the national anthem played.\\" On February 16, 2012, Kaufmann agreed to leave DEG at season's end and signed with fellow DEL club, Nürnberg Ice Tigers, where he played through the 2014-15 season. In July 2015, he announced his retirement from ice hockey.

An example of this includes The Birth of a Nation, which promoted white supremacy, amongst other things. Over time as race relations have improved, parodies and documentaries of racism have begun to be included into film.  Early history  = African American = The industry of the United States grew slowly at first. Over time, plots began to develop and movies became better produced. In 1915, the film The Birth of a Nation by D.W. Griffith was released. The plot of the film basically showed that Ku Klux Klansmen were the saviors to the nation and that they would help to bring back a stable government. The movie also included the use of actors in blackface. Over time, racism became embedded into the film of Hollywood. In 1927, the film The Jazz Singer was released. One of the central themes was the use of blackface by character Jack Robins. Scholar Corin Willis said about the movie: = Arab = In 1921, Paramount Pictures released the Rudolph Valentino movie The Sheik. The movie itself was a box office success but showed Arabs as savage beasts who auction off their own women. The film was followed up a few years later with The Son of the Sheik, which also portrayed racist overtones. Rudolph was even asked by a New York Times reporter once whether or not his well-off character could fall for a savage (an Arab woman). To Valentino's credit, he responded by saying: \\"People are not savages because they have dark skins. The Arabian civilization is one of the oldest in the world...the Arabs are dignified and keen brained.\\" In his essay \\"Arabs in Hollywood: An Undeserved Image\\", Scott J. Simon argues that of all the ethnic groups portrayed in Hollywood films, \\"Arab culture has been the most misunderstood and supplied with the worst stereotypes\\": He also singled out A Son of the Sahara (1924) as \\"the strongest subconscious attack on the Arab culture of all the Arab movies of the 1920s\\". = Asian = Racism against East Asian peoples in Hollywood roles also began in the 1920s. Charlie Chan (actually based on the real Chang Apana), a supposed \\"good Asian\\" was used as an antithesis to Fu Manchu, the so-called \\"bad Asian\\". In 1923, the British silent film serial The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu came out. This movie ushered in the beginning of decades of movies with the Fu Manchu theme. In 1929, the American film The Mysterious Dr. Fu Manchu starring Warner Oland came out. The Show of Shows was released the same year and featured a stereotypical setting with Nick Lucas and Myrna Loy. Several Hollywood movies continue to portray Asian destinations as underdeveloped or of being lived in by savages. This includes showing elephant as a primary mode of transport in modern India or any of the similar stereotypes that has no resemblance to reality. = Native Americans = Throughout the early 1900s, many films that perpetuate stereotypes about Native Americans were made, in particular the stereotype of the \\"Noble Savage\\". The roles of Native Americans were usually reserved for Caucasian actors. The portrayal of indigenous Americans of the silent era most notably remains The Last of the Mohicans (1920). In 1936, the Three Stooges mocked Native Americans in the comedy short, \\"Whoops, I'm an Indian!\\"  Hollywood's golden age  In the 1940s, people like Dudley Dickerson were appearing in Three Stooges films. Dudley was used because of his bug-eyed appearance and portrayal of stereotypes of the time. The prevailing views in Hollywood at the time helped to prevent him from advancing his career, but he never complained about his line of work and actually enjoyed what he was doing. A later Stooges short, The Yoke's on Me, showed a stereotypical view of the Japanese people. Movies of the era showed began to increase the stereotypes that previous generations had started. The Charlie Chan and Fu Manchu stereotypes began to increasingly become more active in movies. Republic Movies released a fifteen episode serial Drums of Fu Manchu, which was later released into a feature film. This brought back the Fu Manchu stereotype after a few years of inaction in Hollywood. The \\"Devil Doctor\\" stereotype was absent from film between 1940 and 1965. Arab stereotypes also played into the film of the time. This included the use of bellydancers and billionaires. The bellydancer stereotype first occurred on film in 1897 when Thomas Edison's kinetoscope showed the women dancing.

The village is ancient, and had fallen into ruins before being restored and turned into a naturist resort around the year 2000. History El Fonoll has been mentioned in writings going back as far as 1305. The village originally contained a castle, of which no trace remains, and a small church dedicated to St. Blaise, built between the 10th and 12th centuries, which contains some unique architectural features and has remained in good condition. The village fell into disuse, and its buildings into ruins, during the 20th century, and the entire area, including over 150 hectares of surrounding land, was eventually bought by Barcelona businessman Emili Vives in 1995, with the intention of restoring it and turning it into a naturist centre. During the construction, Vives met with much obstruction from local and regional officials, but persisted with the project and succeeded in rebuilding almost all of the buildings, using the original limestone blocks. The village today El Fonoll is situated in an isolated forested river valley cutting through the surrounding grain-farming plateau region, and there is an extensive network of tracks winding through the adjoining forested hillsides and abandoned fields and terraces. It is connected by road to the village of Passanant and by track to Vallfogona de Riucorb, both about 5 km away. The village has no access restrictions for people passing through, but there are signs at the boundaries of the lands asking visitors to remove their clothes if possible and not to smoke or use cameras.See the picture of the boundary sign. The top-right symbol indicates \\"no clothes when the sun is shining\\". The village sources much of its food from its own organic plots, and generates its own electricity using wind turbines and solar panels. Accommodation is provided for about 200 people, both long-term residents and holiday visitors. Options include a camping and caravan area, apartments in the restored buildings, and several isolated stone cabins scattered throughout the lands. The Catalan Naturism Club has the use of a building in the village for its activities and accommodation. Facilities available to residents and guests include a shop, a vegetarian cafeteria, a library, a swimming pool, sports pitches, picnic and barbecue areas, and regular organised activities such as sports, entertainment, and courses and conferences related to alternative living. The communally prepared Sunday paellas are especially popular. The facilities operate all year around, but vary with the seasons, to include traditional seasonal activities such as calçotades (springtime scallion feasts) and castanyades (autumn chestnut feasts). Due to the village's inland location and altitude at about 650m its winters are cool, so it attracts smaller numbers of visitors, mainly clothed, outside of the summer season.

It was built by Sir Edward Carey, the keeper of the Jewels to Queen Elizabeth I from stones removed from Berkhamsted Castle. Several notable residents of Berkhamsted lived in the house and over the years its owners welcomed guests such as King Charles I and William Gladstone.Hastie, pp55-56 The house was one of two Elizabethan mansions in the town, the other being Egerton House on the High Street which was demolished in 1937. Berkhamsted Place survived fire and renovation for over 380 years before it became derelict and was demolished in 1967. Construction The ruins of Berkhamsted Castle J.C. Buckler Queen Elizabeth I granted the manor of Berkhamsted, along with the lease of Berkhamsted Castle, to her Keeper of the Jewels, Sir Edward Carey (or Cary), in 1580. Carey was descended from the Carys of Cockington, an ancient Devon family whose lineage went back to Adam de Karry, the first Lord of Castle Karry in Somerset, in the 13th Century.Cobb, p. 33 Berkhamsted Castle had, by this stage, fallen into disrepair and the lease of a ruined castle was possibly intended as some sort of royal joke; Carey owed a nominal annual rent of one red rose, payable yearly on St John the Baptist's Day (24 June). Rather than live in the castle grounds, Sir Edward built for himself a mansion house on top of the hill overlooking the castle, and purloined stonework from the castle ruins to build his house. Architecture Berkhamsted Place was a two- storey building with attics above. The plan of the house was in the shape of a letter E, with wings to the north and south-east. The walls were originally faced with 7-inch square stone chequers of flint and Totternhoe stone with brick additions and a tiled roof. An avenue of lime trees led up the hill to the house. A survey of the house in 1650 by parliamentary commissioners, later held by the office of the Duchy of Cornwall, described the house thus:Cobb, pp. 46–48 According to a survey by the Royal Commission on Historical Monuments in 1910, the house was said to be in \\"fairly good\\" condition, although it noted some decay around the stonework of the original windows. The house retained part of the original courtyard house built by Sir Edward Carey, c. 1580, and hall on the south-eastern side, built after the 1662 fire, occupied part of the old courtyard between the wings. The front of the house was brick with an embattled parapet and a porch with a Tudor-style four- centred arched doorway. The survey noted that a commemorative stone could be seen below the drawing-room windows on, also facing south-east, bearing the inscription \\"1611\\", possibly marking the alterations made for Prince Henry when he purchased the house. The rest of the south-eastern side was covered in cement, and had several small projections and gables. Much of the original decorative stonework was lost after the 1662 fire but that which was preserved could be seen on the north-western side of the house. Here, there were also two brick buttresses and two projecting octagonal brick chimneys which had been added to the building in the 17th Century. At each end of the north side was a plain gable which had a three-light window, stone mullions and a transom, topped with a small stone pediment. The other windows were modern sash windows At the north-eastern end of the house was a stone oriel window; by 1910 this was partially blocked and cut away to accommodate a newer brick chimney. The interior of the house had been considerably altered, but a number of 17th-century features had been retained, including a decoratively carved oak fireplace, another fireplace with plaster decoration, a panelled ceiling, and a decorated plaster ceiling with moulded ribs, vine ornaments, and heads. There was also an ornate 17th-century wooden staircase with square newels, turned balusters and moulded handrail. History Sir Edward Carey's occupation of Berkhamsted Place was brief; in 1588 he took possession of the Manor of Aldenham and went to live in the town, leasing Berkhamsted Place to his brother, Sir Adolphus Carey. He was the first of many tenants of Berkhamsted Place, passing the tenancy on to his son, Sir Henry Carey, who was later to become Lord Falkland and Lord Deputy of Ireland. Various members of the Carey family used the house until 1612, when it was bought by Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales for the sum of £4000. Henry, who died later that year, passed the house to his brother, Charles, who was later crowned King Charles I. Prince Charles leased the property to his tutor Thomas Murray and his wife Mary or Jean Drummond, who had been his nurse and had been Lady of the Privy Chamber to the prince's mother, Anne of Denmark. It is known that the young Prince Charles, then aged sixteen, paid a visit to the Murrays on 14 August 1616, when they spent an afternoon hunting in the estate, Berkhamsted Park.Cobb, p. 35 During the reign of Charles I, it is known that some alterations were made to the house, supervised by Sir David Cunningham of Auchenharvie. One of Cunningham's letters to his cousin describes a royal command for him to supervise building work at Berkhamsted Place in 1629 and his account for this survives counter-signed by Thomas Trevor, on behalf of Sir John Trevor, surveyor of works at Windsor Castle. (Records of Messrs Tods Murray and Jamieson WS, lawyers, Edinburgh) The turbulent events of the English Civil War came to Berkhamsted Place in the 1640s when the Murrays' daughter, Ann Murray, became in a Royalist plot to protect the life of the King's second surviving son, the young Duke of York (who was later to become King James II of England, from the Parliamentarian forces. King Charles was executed in 1648, and Ann, fearing for her life as a Royalist, fled from Berkhamsted Place. Possession of the house was taken by a Berkhamsted-born soldier in Cromwell's Army, Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Axtell. Aged only 26, Axtell was known for his ruthlessness and had risen in the ranks, having served as Captain of the Parliamentary Guard at the execution of King Charles. Axtell's political fortunes reversed following the Restoration of the English monarchy; in 1660 he was hanged, drawn and quartered at Tyburn for the crime of regicide. Ann Murray was later honoured for her loyalty to the crown when King James II granted her a royal pension. In St Peter's Church, Berkhamsted, a memorial on the north wall of the old chancel commemorates James and John Murray, inscribed \\"youths of the most winning disposition who lived and died at Berkhamsted Place\\". Sayer's Almshouses (1664) on Berkhamsted High Street In 1660 the lease of Berkhamsted was taken on by the Lord Treasurer, Jerome Weston, 2nd Earl of Portland; it was during his residency that a large fire broke out, destroying two-thirds of Berkhamsted Place. Reconstruction was hastily commenced, probably financed by John Sayer, a wealthy local man who was Chief Cook to King Charles II. The central part of the house was rebuilt but the two wings which formed the side of the courtyard were never restored. Some of the original Elizabethan decorative stonework was retained on the north wall and can be seen in later photographs of the property. Sayer took ownership of the house shortly after it was rebuilt, and he lived there with his family until his death in 1662. Sayer became well known as a benefactor to the town of Berkhamsted, and his legacy enabled a row of almshouses to be built for the poor widows of the town; these houses still stand today on the High Street and bear a stone inscription \\"The gifte of John Sayer, 1664\\". Around 1690, the Dutch artist Jan Wyck painted A huntsman with a hare and hounds above Berkhamsted, which shows the church, castle, and Berkhamsted Place in the background.Sotheby's International Preview, no. 61 March/April, (1986), p. 3 and full cover illustration, sold 12 March 1986, (the Preview in error calls the Place, 'Ashlyn's Hall') The Sayer family remained in residence at Berkhamsted Place until 1716, when they sold the lease to William Atwell; he in turn sold it to John Roper in 1718, whose family stayed in the house for nearly a century. In 1807 the lease was reassigned to John Egerton, 7th Earl of Bridgewater. The house was eventually bought outright from the estate of the Prince of Wales by Earl Brownlow.Cobb, p50 Ownership of the property was then passed to General John Finch and his wife, notable benefactors of the town who were responsible for rebuilding the Thomas Bourne School and supporting the town hall fund. After General Finch, the house was occupied by Lady Sarah Spencer and Gertrude, Countess of Pembroke. The two ladies entertained many notable establishment figures in their fashionable country residence, including the Duke of York (who was later crowned King George V) and the Prime Minister William Gladstone. The house was subsequently purchased by the Ram family, first occupied by a Mr S.J Ram KC and later in 1937 by his son, Sir Granville Ram who was First Parliamentary Counsel to the Treasury. Decline Berkhamsted Place at it appears today Berkhamsted Place served well over the centuries as an English country house; at the time of the Second World War the house had nine bedrooms, three bathrooms and five upstairs staff bedrooms. By the 1950s, the cost of running and maintaining a fully staffed great house became prohibitive, and like many other staffed residences, the property was sold off to be converted into flats in the 1950s. The surviving 17th-Century wing of the house became the studio of the renowned sculptor Reg Butler, whose 1953 work Unknown Political Prisoner won the Grand Prize in a competition held by the London Institute of Contemporary Arts. By 1963 the house had become unoccupied and fell into dereliction and was finally demolished in 1967. Today, the site is occupied by a number of private cottages and a farm.

The dam was built at the former first cataract of the Nile, and is located about 1000 km up-river and 690 km (direct distance) south-southeast of Cairo. When initially constructed between 1899 and 1902, nothing of its scale had ever been attempted; on completion, it was the largest masonry dam in the world. The dam was designed to provide storage of annual floodwater and augment dry season flows to support greater irrigation developmentPower from the Assuan Dam to Be Used to Increase Still Further the Cotton Crop in Egypt, The New York Times, July 27, 1913, (pdf file) and population growth in the lower Nile. The dam, originally limited in height by conservation concerns, worked as designed, but provided inadequate storage capacity for planned development and was raised twice, between 1907 and 1912 and again in 1929–1933. These heightenings still did not meet irrigation demands and in 1946 it was nearly over-topped in an effort to maximize pool elevation. This led to the investigation and construction of the Aswan High Dam upstream. Background The earliest recorded attempt to build a dam near Aswan was in the 11th century, when the Arab polymath and engineer Ibn al- Haytham (known as Alhazen in the West) was summoned to Egypt by the Fatimid Caliph, Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, to regulate the flooding of the Nile. After his field work convinced him of the impracticality of this scheme, and fearing the Caliph's anger, he feigned madness. He was kept under house arrest from 1011 until al-Hakim's death in 1021, during which time he wrote his influential Book of Optics. Construction Following their 1882 invasion and occupation of Egypt, the British began construction of the first dam across the Nile in 1898. Construction lasted until 1902, and it was opened on 10 December 1902, by the Duke of Connaught and Strathearn. The project was designed by Sir William Willcocks and involved several eminent engineers of the time, including Sir Benjamin Baker and Sir John Aird, whose firm, John Aird & Co., was the main contractor.Egypt bond Capital and financing were furnished by Ernest Cassel.Finance, Jewish Encyclopedia c.1906 The Old Aswan Dam was designed as a gravity-buttress dam; the buttress sections accommodate numerous gates, which were opened yearly to pass the flood and its nutrient-rich sediments, but without retaining any yearly storage. The dam was constructed of rubble masonry and faced with red ashlar granite. When constructed, the Old Aswan Dam was the largest masonry dam in the world.V. Novokshshenov, Laboratory studies of the stone masonry in the Old Aswan Dam , Materials and Structures 1993, Vol. 26, p. 103-110 The design also included a navigation lock of similar construction on the western bank, which allowed shipping to pass upstream as far as the second cataract, whereas a portage overland was previously required. At the time of its construction, nothing of such scale had ever been attempted.Frederic Courtland Penfield, Harnessing the Nile, Century Magazine, Vol. 57, No. 4 (February 1899) =Heightening= Initial limitations were imposed on the dam's height, due to concern for the Philae Temple. The initial construction was found to be inadequate for development needs, and the height of the dam was raised in two phases, between 1907–1912 and between 1929–1933. Generation of electricity was added. The first phase was supervised by Sir Benjamin Baker, but much of the detailed work was undertaken by Murdoch MacDonald.Grace's Guide (1952) Murdoch MacDonald obituary. Accessed: 4 January 2014. With its final raising (designed and supervised by MacDonald's firm, Sir M MacDonald & Partners), the dam is in length, with a crest level above the original riverbed; the dam provides the main route for traffic between the city and the airport. With the construction of the High Dam upstream, the Old Dam's ability to pass the flood's sediments was lost, as was the serviceability provided by the locks. The previous Old Dam reservoir level was also lowered and now provides control of tailwater for the High Dam. Power plants The Aswan Low Dam supports two hydroelectric power plants, Aswan I (1960) and Aswan II (1985–1986). Aswan I contains 7 X generators with Kaplan turbines for a combined capacity of and is located west of the dam. Aswan II contains 4 x generators for an installed capacity of and is located at the toe of the dam. See also * Energy in Egypt Further reading * Perennial irrigation and flood protection for Egypt.

It is their follow-up to the horror film Inside. Plot Lucy is a young woman who starts her practical training as an at-home nurse. She is trained by an older lady, Mrs. Wilson. The last patient on their rounds lives in an old, remote mansion. Lucy enters the mansion, which is filled with stuffed animals, and finds Mrs. Wilson at the bed of the patient, Mrs. Deborah Jessel. Mrs. Wilson tells her that Jessel was once a prominent ballet teacher, but is now bedridden and in a coma. There is a rumor that Mrs. Jessel has a treasure of gold and jewels located somewhere on the property. After her first day on the job, Lucy tells her boyfriend, Will, about the treasure. Lucy, Will, and Will's brother Ben decide to hunt for the treasure. They enter the basement of the house through a window. In a room filled with stuffed animals gathered around a tea table, they find a single locked door. Lucy correctly suspects that a key worn by Jessel is the key to this door. Inside, they find a white sheet covering what looks like a stuffed mannequin of a young girl. Lucy suggests that this is the corpse of Jessel's mute daughter Anna, still dressed in a ballerina outfit. Lucy twists the key on the pedestal the corpse is standing on, and the corpse starts spinning slowly with music playing, like a ballerina on a music box. They hear noises from the floor above and try to flee the house, but the window through which they entered is now secured by iron bars. While trying to find an exit, they become separated. Ben finds himself in an operating room with no door and no idea how he got there. He is killed by veiled ballerinas who appear out of nowhere. Lucy sees Mrs. Jessel sitting at what was once Anna's tea party table. There is a flashback demonstrating that Mrs. Jessel was a very strict ballet teacher: a girl leaves the ballet class and Jessel later finds her lying dead in Anna's room; Anna is bent over the girl, drinking her blood. It is revealed that the Jessels are vampires. Will is attacked by Ben, who is now a vampire. Will stabs Ben with a pair of scissors, but Mrs. Jessel attacks and kills him. Lucy discovers that Anna is not dead. Anna attempts to drink Lucy's blood, but Lucy pushes her away. Mrs. Wilson appears, attacks and sedates Lucy. While Wilson watches, Mrs. Jessel implants the pupae of a moth into the throats of Lucy and Anna; this is a ritual to exchange their souls. Jessel believes that she has been successful when Anna awakes and her eye color has changed and she is in a different body. Jessel orders Anna to dance, but Anna does not respond. Wilson attempts to punish her, but Anna stabs her with scissors and then turns on Jessel. Both women fall to the floor. Although bleeding heavily, Jessel tries to bite Anna. Lucy whips her mother until she releases Anna, and the two girls throw Jessel off a third floor balcony. Anna and Lucy escape from the mansion, and walk along a seaside cliff holding hands. Lucy (in Anna’s body) leans over the cliff, but she does not fall. Instead, she flies into the sky. Her scars disappear, and Anna (in Lucy’s body) watches her float away. Production Julien Maury and Alexandre BustilloThe film went into production in 2009. It was initially intended to be Bustillo and Maury's English-language debut and shot in the United Kingdom but they moved to a lower-budget French production after they found that they were losing creative control over their story. A promo was shown at the American Film Market. The film was described as being more of a fantasy film than their previous film; \\"If Inside was meant to play as horror taken from fact then Livid plays as horror taken from fairy tale, the Grimm kind with all the bloody bits left in.\\" Cast *Chloé Coulloud — Lucy *Jérémy Kapone — Ben *Félix Moati — William *Catherine Jacob — Mrs. Wilson *Marie-Claude Pietragalla — Deborah Jessel *Chloé Marcq — Anna *Loïc Berthezene — Lucy's father *Béatrice Dalle — Lucy's mother *Rajan Maman — Tony's Son Release Livid was shown at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 11, 2011. On October 12, the film was shown at the Sitges Film Festival. Marc Thiébault won the award for Best Production Design at the festival for his work in Livid. The film opened in France on December 7, 2011. Reception Variety compared the film unfavorably to the director's previous film Inside, stating that \\"the pic is so eager to go over the top that, in the end, it doesn't make much sense.\\" Screen Daily gave a positive review of the film, comparing it to the works of Guillermo del Toro and Dario Argento. The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a negative review, stating that it was neither \\"gory nor eerie enough to function as veritable horror fare\\". Horror magazine Fangoria gave the film a positive review of three out of four, stating that the film's \\"final moments are a bit stretched and its end is sillier than probably intended. It’s imperfect, yes, but entirely worth loving; likely and hopefully appreciated and adored over time.\\" Remake An English-language remake for the film was written by David Birke and was to be directed by Nicholas McCarthy, but was not made.

Wilson Seventh-day Adventist Church The central buildings in the rural Wilson community are the Seventh- day Adventist Church and school. Wilson is home to the largest Adventist church in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The church also operates a Junior Academy, enrolling grades 1 – 10. In the early 1900s, a group of Adventists from Wisconsin moved into the area and began farming. A church was erected in 1908 and services were originally held in French. The first minister was R.J. Bellows. In 1948, a furnace fire caused the church to be demolished, however, a new church was built and completed in 1949. A small area at the back of the church was partitioned off as a schoolroom, however, the space was inadequate and in 1947, a public school building was purchased from the Ford River Township and moved onto land across from the church. In 1964, the original school was torn down and a new three-room school with a gymnasium was built. The school is still in operation today.

The line is also called the Paulista Line, because it goes along much of the Avenida Paulista, one of the leading financial centers in São Paulo. Despite being the second line to be planned, it was the third to be built—the second line built was actually Line 3 (Red Line). This line connects West to South-East regions. Internal view of an Alstom G stock train. History Santuário Nossa Senhora de Fátima-Sumaré Station The first section of Line 2 (Green Line), initially called the Paulista Line, was built using the New Austrian Tunnelling Method. The line opened on January 25, 1991, having at that time a length of and four stations. With this line the metro system was extended to include a major axis of the expanded center of São Paulo, with a large concentration of financial institutions, hospitals, schools, hotels, consulates, offices of state radio and television, theaters and museums. The following year the Ana Rosa and Clínicas stations were opened, increasing the line to . In 1998 two new stations (Vila Madalena and Santuário Nossa Senhora de Fátima-Sumaré) were completed, adding a further stretch. On March 30, 2006 the then Governor Geraldo Alckmin on his last day in office opened the Santos-Imigrantes station. Shortly after, on May 9, 2006, the Chácara Klabin station was formally opened by former Governor Claudio Lembo, thus completing the stretch between Ana Rosa and Santos-Imigrantes, making the line a total of long. Brigadeiro Station platform On June 30, 2007 the Governor José Serra opened the Alto do Ipiranga station, located at the junction of Avenida Dr. Gentil de Moura and Rua Visconde de Piraja, bringing the metro network in São Paulo to a total length of , with a forecast of passenger demand on Line 2 of 370,000 people per day. Jose Serra published a decree and authorization to extend the line to Vila Prudente, adding the Sacomã, Tamanduateí and Vila Prudente stations. On May 10, 2007, during the Papal visit of Benedict XVI to the city of São Paulo, Line 2 had the highest demand of its history up until then, carrying 370,226 passengers. During the weekend of May 17–18, 2008 Line 2 was temporarily shut down between the stations and Clinicas and Consolation to allow for the use of a tunnel boring machine just seven meters below the level of its tunnel being used for the extension project of Line 4 (Yellow). The current record of passengers carried by the line was on May 7, 2008, with 428,056 passengers. On March 28, 2009, the first of the sixteen new trains came into operation for the inauguration of the Sacomã - Vila Prudente stretch. On January 10, 2010, Sacomã station was opened to the public, initially only in operation from 10:30 to 15:00 and then from the 22nd, from 10:00 to 16:00. Finally, on the 30th of that month, it was fully opened to the public. Although the extension project of Line 2 was the only one to receive the whole amount in 2009, the schedule was delayed—the opening of the Tamanduateí and Vila Prudente stations originally scheduled for March 2010 was postponed. On August 18 it was announced that the opening of Vila Prudente station would happen just three days later. On September 21, the Tamanduateí station opened.

The Santuário Nossa Senhora de Fátima-Sumaré station is elevated and situated in a valley (under the Dr. Arnold viaduct). The Tamanduateí station is elevated with concrete structures mixed with metal, supporting the arched ceiling. All other stations are underground. The Trianon-Masp, Consolação, Brigadeiro, Ana Rosa, Chácara Klabin, and Santos-Imigrantes stations are composed of core platforms. The others are just side platforms.

It resulted in more casualties and caused greater damage than Hurricane Norma, which took place later that season. On October 6, a tropical depression formed and strengthened into a tropical storm six hours later. Lidia brushed the Gulf of California coast of Baja California Sur and made landfall just south of Los Mochis in Sinaloa on October 8. Tropical Storm Lidia rapidly weakened and dissipated the same day. Lidia killed at least 73 people and caused at least $80 million (1981 USD) which is equivalent to $193 million (2010 USD) in damage. It inflicted heavy rain and flooding throughout parts of northwestern Mexico, especially Sinaloa. Meteorological history A tropical depression formed on October 6 while located south of Cabo San Lucas.distance calculated from The Longitude/Latitude Calculator. Data enter in from the East Pacific best track file (ref #2) Ahead of a southwesterly flow over Mexico and a front, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Lidia at 0000 UTC October 7. Lidia moved generally north, and reached its maximum windspeed of 50 mph (85 km/h). Despite encountering warm sea surface temperatures, which are generally favorable for intensification, Lidia slowly weakened as it moved towards southern Baja California. The tropical cyclone passed over the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula on 1700 UTC October 7; at the time of the landfall Lidia was located about northwest of Cabo San Lucas. Two hours later, Lidia entered the Gulf of California, and turned to the northeast. Lidia made landfall on the shores of Sinaloa about south of Los Mochis on October 8, with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). At 0600 UTC, the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center ended advisories as the tropical cyclone dissipated inland about northeast of that same place. The remnants of Lidia continued their northeast track, moving over Mexico, and ultimately emerging into the Southern United States, spurring a new frontal wave. Impact and aftermath alt=Map Tropical Storm Lidia caused flash flooding, with highest point point maxima was at El Varejona and Badiraguato in Sinaloa. Heavy rainfall sent water down a dry river bed in Pericos, killing 40 people, mostly children. In the village Bachiulato, (or perhaps Pericos) six soldiers died while attempting to save peasants from the flooding. In the northern part of Sinaloa, 42 were confirmed killed and 76 were missing. Around Los Mochis, four people were killed. About 800 houses were also destroyed in that town. In Culiacán, eleven people were killed. Losses to cattle, crops, and fishing vessels were more than $80 million (1981 USD), equivalent to $193 million (2010 USD). Electricity was cut off to two settlements, Guamúchil and Guasave. Telephone service was also cut off to Culiacán. Heavy rain caused flooding that cut off seven towns in Sinaloa from the outside world. It also contaminated the water supply in Culiacán, leaving many without clean drinking water. Almost a hundred villages were flooded, as were two dams. The Rio Fuerte burst its banks and flooded sixty settlements. It also forced evacuations, which were enforced by the Mexican Army. Mexican Federal Highway 15 was closed due to the storm, as was the Pacific Railroad. The highway was reopened shortly after the storm passed. The total death toll from Tropical Storm Lidia was determined to exceed 73. This was enough to make it the deadliest tropical cyclone of its season, which mostly occurred in rural areas. A few days later, Hurricane Norma struck similar areas as Lidia, also causing devastation. The remnants of Lidia brought moisture to extreme southeastern Arizona. During the aftermath of the storm, food and clothing was brought to towns isolated by the storm. In Culiacán, churches, schools, and a baseball stadium served as temporary shelters for displaced persons. Rescue workers also searched for bodies of victims of both Lidia and the subsequent Hurricane Norma, which hit the same area a few days later. Due to the damage wrought by both Lidia and Norma, the Governor of Sinaloa, Antonio Toledo Corro, declared his state a disaster area. He also asked the Mexican Federal Government for aid.

These kinds of interactions have been studied and modeled by population ecologists for nearly a century. Species at the bottom of the food chain, such as algae and other autotrophs, consume non-biological resources, such as minerals and nutrients of various kinds, and they derive their energy from light (photons) or chemical sources. Species higher up in the food chain survive by consuming other species and can be classified by what they eat and how they obtain or find their food.  Classification of consumer types  =The standard categorization= Various terms have arisen to define consumers by what they eat, such as meat-eating carnivores, fish-eating piscivores, insect-eating insectivores, plant-eating herbivores, seed-eating granivores, and fruit- eating frugivores and omnivores are meat eaters and plant eaters. An extensive classification of consumer categories based on a list of feeding behaviors exists. =The Getz categorization= Wayne Getz's consumer categories are based on material eaten (plant: green live, brown dead; animal: red live, purple dead; or particulate: grey) and feeding strategy (gatherer: lighter shades; miner: darker shades). Another way of categorizing consumers, proposed by South African American ecologist Wayne Getz, is based on a biomass transformation web (BTW) formulation that organizes resources into five components: live and dead animal, live and dead plant, and particulate (i.e. broken down plant and animal) matter. It also distinguishes between consumers that gather their resources by moving across landscapes from those that mine their resources by becoming sessile once they have located a stock of resources large enough for them to feed on during completion of a full life history stage. In Getz's scheme, words for miners are of Greek etymology and words for gatherers are of Latin etymology. Thus a bestivore, such as a cat, preys on live animals (Latin: bestia=animal) while a sarcophage, such as a botfly larva mines live flesh and a zontanophage (Greek: zontanos=alive), such as a leaf miner, mines live plant material. A carcasivore (Latin: carcasium=carcass), such as white-backed vulture, scavenge animal carcasses while a necrophage (Greek: nekros=dead body), such as a blowfly, mines dead flesh. Victivores (Latin: victus=living) gather live plant material and thus include frugivores, nectivores, graminivores, granivores and folivores as subcategories. Lectivores, such as many termites, gather dead plant material (Latin: lectus=bed which is the root of the word litter, as in leaf-litter) and thanatophages (Greek: thanatos=death), such as pillbugs mine piles of dead plant material.

He was a key figure in creating the original operational plan for the Fox News Channel and was a senior member of the original 20/20 staff. He is also the author of two books, Naked Launch and The Making of The Thorn Birds, a story of the making of the 1983 ABC-broadcast miniseries, The Thorn Birds. Career =Early career: WCBS-TV & WABC-TV= Cooper's career began in the early 1970s at WCBS-TV, where he was writer and producer of Channel 2 News From The Newsroom, the first ever daily newscast to be aired from a working newsroom. During his time there, he worked with many prominent names including John Stossel, Linda Ellerbee, Lynn Sherr, Dave Marash, Rolland Smith, Pia Lindstrom and Joel Siegel among many others. He resigned from WCBS- TV in 1976, after stating that he no longer liked the direction the program was heading in and was asked to join WABC-TV, where he was Assistant News Director of Eyewitness News for the next year. Here, Cooper received an Emmy for Outstanding News Coverage for mounting television's first newscast anchored live from the location of a breaking story. It was during this time that Cooper also produced and directed the first music videos made for Warner Bros. Records, including videos for Rod Stewart, Seals and Crofts and Little Feat with Lowell George. =Police films for the NYPD= In 1981, Cooper went on to produce a multi-award-winning series for the New York City Police Department (NYPD). He was asked by New York City Police Commissioner at the time, Robert McGuire, to \\"make dramatic films containing storylines built around constitutional law issues\\" to improve teaching of constitutional law to police officers. The movies starred James Earl Jones, Sam Waterston, Ken Howard, Rob Morrow among many others, while the cop roles were acted by 35 real police officers. He later produced two other films and a music video for the NYPD's Operation SPECDA, a classroom anti-drug program that were shown to fifth and sixth grade children at school in 1986. The song, which was called The SPECDA Theme Song was sung by police officer Robin Vance accompanied by 200 children. In the late 80s he was asked to produce another two films for the NYPD, Police Women and Restoring Dignity: Frontline Response to Sexual Assault. =The Wall Street Journal Report= In the mid-1980s, Cooper was brought on by Michael Connor, head of television for The Wall Street Journal, to advise in the remake of The Wall Street Journal Report as consultant and production designer. After the big Wall Street crash of 1987, the program was deemed a success with a 600% increase in viewer rating. =ABC & King World Productions= Cooper was a founding senior member of ABC's 20/20 staff in 1977 before resigning from the show in 1981 in pursuit of other challenges. After his continued success, in 1987, ABC News offered Cooper's production company Dan Cooper Productions to produce a new 14-hour series of documentaries titled Great TV News Stories that were aired on VH-1. The show was such a success that Av Westin, former executive producer of the prime time ABC News program 20/20, offered Cooper another position as executive producer of Instant Recall, a series that recounted major news events through a kaleidoscope of video, music, news, interviews and newsreel footage. The famous show which was broadcast by King World Productions, the producers of shows like Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune and distributor of Oprah, was hosted by John Palmer. =Fox News= In 1994, Cooper moved to Fox News where he was managing editor and financial chief of Fox's prime time news magazine, Front Page. After Front Page was canceled, he was placed as managing editor and financial chief of prime time magazine, Full Disclosure with Judith Regan and Andrew Neil. Working alongside Roger Ailes, Cooper became one of the co- founders of Fox News Channel in 1996. He created the original operational plan for the Fox News Channel and was put in charge of the design and construction of its production facility in New York. In his operational plan, he determined that 900 people would need to be hired, including details of what their duties were, how they would work with each other and where they would work. Cooper was personally in charge of hiring about 90 people, who reported back to him directly. He also designed the Washington Bureau and studio and supervised the scenic design of every Fox News Channel broadcast. Cooper was on board from the first day, having co-written Fox News Channel's business plan which was presented to and approved by Rupert Murdoch on the same day. Cooper also created the 24-hour concept of news on the hour and half-hour, with news talk shows taking place in between. Cooper was also in charge of the weather deal cut with WSI and created and implemented Fox News' weather bug that was superimposed in the lower right of the Fox broadcast image. =4 Stories= In 1997, Cooper produced and directed 4 Stories, a series that focused on showing volunteers and organizations and groups, taking pro-active roles in helping others in need. The show was aired on WNBC-TV and hosted by Maurice DuBois. 4 Stories was a huge hit, beating successful shows like Baywatch, X-Files and Pensacola Gold in rankings and won several awards. The show received an Award For Excellence In Broadcasting and was named Outstanding Public Affairs Series at the 33rd annual New York State Broadcasters executive conference. It also won second prize, a tie with 60 Minutes, at World Hunger Year's Harry Chapin Media Awards in 1997 for the Best Broadcasts award. =Controversies= In 2005, Cooper began writing a memoir, a dark comedy about his life and of his time working at Fox News titled Naked Launch, that contains criticism towards Fox News and its co-creator, Roger Ailes. The book received a lot of critical acclaim after Cooper began posting chapters of it on his website. Naked Launch (and various interviews and news articles published after the book's launch) reveals that Cooper was at one point Roger Ailes's \\"confidante\\", exposing many details of Ailes's \\"paranoid\\" persona.Naked Launch: Prologue plus extras. Accessed February 24, 2013. In 2009, Keith Olbermann accused Cooper of a Twitter defamatory conspiracy against him on his MSNBC broadcast, Countdown with Keith Olbermann. Olbermann implied that Dan was part of the Fox News plot to defame him; specifically, running the Twitter account which Olbermann claimed he hadn't set up, even though MSNBC held the account in Olbermann's name. The accusations started when Olbermann allegedly received a Twitter email with Dan Cooper's name in it, which was later revealed to have been a Dan Cooper fan who was urging Olbermann to follow Cooper on Twitter. Personal life Cooper studied journalism at New York University. He was married to Gina Pia Bandini, an independent television production coordinator and production assistant, in his New York home in 1990. The couple later divorced in 2004.

Bond (commonly Bill Bond) (born January 2, 1931) is an inventor and mechanical engineer who retired from General Motors after spending his entire career with the car maker. He is most noted for his innovative work on intake manifolds, a three-wheeled concept car, and early electric cars in the 1960s.  Background  William Dale Bond was born January 2, 1931 in Winterset, Iowa to Dale Bond, an entrepreneur and Myrtle Swedlund Bond, a music teacher. He graduated from Iowa State University in 1960 with a BS degree in Engineering and is a member of the Iowa State University chapter of Tau Beta Pi, an engineering society for academic excellence. In the early 1950s, he raced on the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah. He was one of the charter members of the Ames, Iowa hot rod club and the Night Crawlers in the mid-1950s. Bond served as a ballistic meteorologist for the National Guard during the Korean War era.  Career  A member of the engineering staff, Bond worked for General Motors (GM) from July 1960 until his retirement in February 1993. His early work involved one of GM's earliest electric cars, the Electrovair II, a 1966 Corvair Monza sedan powered by silver-zinc batteries. The battery pack gave the Electrovair II a similar performance to that of the conventional gasoline powered Corvair which the car was based on with a top speed of 80 mph. As the project manager of the Electrovair II, Bond served as the spokesperson and driver when the car was demonstrated to the press in October 1966. It is the oldest historic vehicle on display at the GM Heritage Center in Sterling Heights, Michigan. Bond then worked with the Electrovan, which is credited as the world's first hydrogen fuel cell powered vehicle. The Electrovan had a top speed of 70 mph, was able to accelerate from 0-60 mph in 30 seconds and had a range of 120 to 150 miles. It is currently on display at the GM Heritage Center in Sterling Heights, Michigan.

History Farmland \\"set aside\\". Farmers can qualify for the Single Farm Payment by leaving areas fallow. Historically, the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) emphasised direct subsidies for agricultural produce. To reduce price distortion, the connection between payments and specific crops was removed; instead, a \\"Single Farm Payment\\", which subsidised farmers on a per- hectare basis, was introduced in June 2003; although farmers may now attempt to claim subsidies for more land than they actually have. This \\"decoupling\\" of subsidies means they are accepted in the \\"Blue box\\" category of subsidies in the WTO Agreement on Agriculture negotiated at the Uruguay Round, in line with international agreements to reduce market-distorting subsidies and price controls. Payments to farmers National governments within the EU make their own arrangements for implementation and for paying subsidies to farmers; in the UK this is done by the Rural Payments Agency, an executive agency of Defra. Some British farmers have experienced problems due to delays in verifying how much land they have which is eligible for subsidy. The Scottish government offers farmers an online system to claim subsidies, which reduces the burden of paperwork. In non-Euro countries, payments to farmers may be made in local currency at an exchange rate set by the European Central Bank. Trading Some farmers trade their subsidy entitlements. Economics The Single Farm Payment is a large proportion of income for many farmers, who say they could not profit without subsidies. However, farm subsidies in developed countries push down food prices and impoverish third-world farmers. Taxpayers in the EU get more than most in return for their money. In 2010, the EU spent €57 billion on agricultural development, of which €39 billion was spent on direct subsidies.

The vessel had originally set sail from Boston on 15 November 1939 after months of preparation for the voyage to Antarctica. The stop in Philadelphia was to load two planes on board. One was a single-engine Beechcraft to be used together with the Snow Cruiser, and the other was a twin-engine Condor to be used at the West Base for geological exploratory flights.

This unofficial journal is in the hands of Gilmour's children. Harold P. Gilmour. He is seen here at his \\"desk\\" at the West Base (Little America III) in May 1940. Born in Lynn, Massachusetts, Gilmour enlisted in the Navy as a teenager and was subsequently Honorably Discharged. When Gilmour was in his mid- thirties, he decided to switch gears and seek adventure and he volunteered for the United States Antarctic Service (USAS) to participate as an explorer in the 1939–1941 Expedition to the South Pole. He was assigned to Little America III – the West Base. During the long 1940 winter night, a Geological Party Expedition of four men was organized at the West Base and they prepared for the extremely long sledging trek on board two dog sleds to the Edsel Ford Ranges. The four-man party was composed of Lawrence A. Warner, leader and geologist, Charles F. Passel, geologist and radio operator, Harold P. Gilmour \\"Gil\\", recorder and collector of biological specimens and Loran Wells \\"Joe\\", photographer and observer. The extensive Warpasgiljo Glacier was discovered and named for these four members (WARner + PASsel + GILmour + JOe) of the Geological Party Expedition. The Geological Party's Expedition mapped and geologically surveyed most of the southern portion of the Edsel Ford Range, and also investigated the different natural resources of the area. They also triangulated and measured accurately to help create improved maps of the region. The four-man Geological Party Expedition left the West Base on 17 October 1940 and returned 82 days later on 7 January 1941 traveling a total of 691 nautical miles on board their dog sleds. Shortly into this almost 3-month expedition, one of Gilmour's wood skis broke. With no way to repair the ski, Gilmour continued with a half ski, and was nicknamed by the other Expedition Party members as \\"Ski-and-a-Half Gilmour\\". This extra strain on one leg left Gilmour with a limp for the rest of his life. He also had two toes amputated due to frostbite, a common occurrence among explorers of that era. In the nearly three-month expedition, they had to be supported by airplanes that deposited supplies at 100-mile intervals along their charted route. The Geological Party Expedition visited for the first time some 50 peaks in this region and some 300 geological specimens were collected. Mount Gilmour was one of those peaks and was named in honor of Harold P.

After denouncing Islam before an Islamic judge, they were imprisoned. Though threatened \\"with being thrown upon the streets as prostitutes\\", they were eventually beheaded. They are commemorated on 24 November.http://www.boston-catholic-journal.com/roman-martrylogy-in- english/roman-martyrology-november-in-english.htm#November_24th Flora Flora was born to a Christian mother and a Muslim father. Her father died when she was still very young, and Flora was brought up as a Christian. Her Muslim older brother tried in vain to convert Flora to Islam, eventually surrendering his sister to the authorities. Flora was imprisoned and a Muslim scholar was appointed to teach her about Islam, but she managed to escape and fled towards the Christian settlements. María María was born to a Christian father and Muslim mother. Her mother was baptised some time after she got married. Fearing charges of apostasy, the couple and their two children left their home in the town of Elche and moved to the village of Fronianus. María lost her mother at a young age, and her father sent her to convent in Cuteclara. The convent’s abbess, Artemia, told María how she witnessed the execution of her two sons by the Muslim rulers thirty years prior. The story had a long-lasting impression on the girl. María’s older brother, Walabonsus, also received a religious education at the monastery of Saint Felix. The siblings, who were separated when María was sent to the convent and Walabonsus to the monastery, met again when Walabonsus was appointed one of the supervisors of María’s convent. Walabonsus was executed by Muslim authorities on 16 July 851, and his martyrdom along with Artemia's story drove María to follow in her brother’s footsteps. Imprisonment and martyrdom Flora and María met at the church of Saint Acisclus. and decided to denounce Islam together. They did so before a Qadi (Islamic judge) and were subsequently imprisoned. In jail, Flora was offered a full pardon if she \\"returned\\" to Islam, but she explained that the only beliefs she had ever held were Christian. This explanation was not accepted because according to Islamic law, a child born to even one Muslim parent should have adopted Islam as their religion. Sabigotho used to visit Flora and María in jail and once spent a night in their cell \\"as if she herself were shackled, not only to console the two soldiers, but to confide in them her own intention to die\\". In accordance with Shari'a law, Flora and María were found guilty of two different crimes: Flora was executed for apostasy, and María for blasphemy. Before the executions, the young women were threatened \\"with being thrown upon the streets as prostitutes\\", which was an unbearable punishment for virgins. They were beheaded on 24 November 851. There bodies were left in the open for a day then thrown into the river. The body of Mary was recovered and taken to the convent, that of Flora was never recovered. Their heads were buried at the church of St Acisilus in Cordoba. Legacy Flora and María were the first two of nine females Christian Martyrs of Córdoba described by Eulogius of Córdoba in his Memorial of the Saints. Their example inspired other Christians to become martyrs.

It is named after its main editor, James Hobrecht (1825–1902), who served for the royal Prussian urban planning police (\\"Baupolizei\\"). The finalized plan \\"Bebauungsplan der Umgebungen Berlins\\" (Binding Land-Use Plan for the Environs of Berlin) was resolved in 1862, intended for a time frame of about 50 years. The plan not only covered the area around the cities of Berlin and Charlottenburg but also described the spatial regional planning of a large perimeter. Thus, it also prepared the city and its neighbouring municipalities for the Greater Berlin Act of 1920, which greatly extended Berlin's size and population. The plan resulted in large areas of dense urban city blocks known as 'blockrand structures', with mixed-use buildings reaching to the street and offering a common-used courtyard, later often overbuilt with additional court structures to house more people. The Hobrecht-Plan inspired new urban plans after 1990 by construction senator Hans Stimmann and his colleagues, so that the formerly- divided Berlin would grow together and become denser and livelier. Hobrecht's plan is often compared to Baron Haussmann's restructuring of Paris, as it also resulted in wide metropolitan avenues, large urban parks and squares, sewers and other modernisation projects of the infrastructure.  History  The 1862 plan as a map (scale of 1:15'384) The industrial revolution led to a swift rural exodus at the beginning of the 19th century. Berlin as the Prussian capital was the target of many emigrants resulting in a rapid growth. After the Napoleonic Wars the city grew by 10,000 new inhabitants every year accelerating in the middle of the century so that the metro area would reach the millions at the end of the century (see Berlin population statistics). There had been already some urban planning on the city before Hobrecht. This includes proposals from Karl Friedrich Schinkel and planning maps from Johann Carl Ludwig Schmid dating to 1825 and 1830. Peter Joseph Lenné proposed a wider regional planning in 1840 named \\"Projektierte Schmuck- und Grenzzüge von Berlin mit nächster Umgebung\\" (projected decorative and boundary lines of Berlin and its immediate vicinity). All the persons were well-renowned architects and city planners. Hobrechtsfelde Hobrecht was instead a geodesist (professional land surveyor) who had just extended his formation with a civil engineer examination on transportation planning (\\"Wasser-, Wege- und Eisenbahnbaumeisterprüfung\\") in 1858. Soon after entering the royal Prussian urban planning police he was commanded in 1859 to head the commission on creation of a land-use plan for Berlin and its environs. He traveled to Hamburg, Paris and London in 1860 to learn about the contemporary development status in urban planning especially their sewer systems. In the 1860s the Berlin Customs Wall was removed and there were plans to amalgamation of the many suburbs of Berlin on 1 January 1861. Based on the just finished land surveys and existing land-use proposals James Hobrecht constructed a map showing a possible land-use for a city at a projected size of 1.5 to 2 million inhabitants. It incorporated the land between the Customs Wall and a railway line being constructed to encircle the city; the area came to be known architecturally as the Wilhelmine Ring. That Hobrecht-Plan did show two large ring roads encircling both of Berlin and Charlottenburg with dozens of arterial roads entering the city. The area between these were divided into rectangular spaces. Unlike the urban planning of Paris, Hobrecht did respect the existing roads, villages and railways including them into the planning process. The map was resolved on 18 July 1862 and it would influence the urban structure of Berlin for the centuries to come.  Results  Mietskaserne – row of backyards showing the distance between each house is no more than required for the fire engine to turn The Hobrecht-Plan was detailed for the street area, giving only the boundary lines for housing construction. The housing construction business was rather unregulated in comparison with modern construction rules – there were some basic constraints to allow fire brigades to do their work by having the maximum height limited to 20 meters and each house had to be reachable from the streets via a backyard of at least 5.34 × 5.34 meters in size to allow the fire engine to turn. In effect, speculative builders took over with densely packed architectural designs to allow a maximum number of rooms – the foundation of the Mietskaserne tenement housing estates rings. While Hobrecht called for the front buildings to be designed for upper- and middle-class people, the backyard buildings were mostly plagued by lack of sunlight and poor ventilation. The situation worsened in Gründerzeit times with housing construction running too slowly so that the population density rose beyond 1000 inhabitants per square kilometer – many backyard houses had two to three inhabitants per room and the citywide sewer system was not to be finished before 1893.  Reception  The Hobrecht-plan was criticized for decades as given the foundation for the social problems possibly even nurturing the street fights in the 1920s between red (communists) and brown (fascists) thugs in the crowded lower class quarters. Hobrecht himself was surely in the position and he had the education to outguess the results. He promoted his plan saying This also indicates that he had no real intention to prevent the housing conditions of the lower class which he might have seen as normal in his times. The reception in the late 20th century is much more favorable to the Hobrecht-Plan as it did also establish the basis to resolve the problems that were to come. There are no records whether he did fight behind closed doors – but he was called off on 15 December 1861 already. He went to Stettin to build a water supply system and to plan the sewer system which would be built in 1870. With the help of his brother Arthur Hobrecht – who would eventually become lord mayor of Berlin in 1872 – he was able to return to Berlin in 1869 ordered to plan the sewer system for the city. The construction works would start in 1873 lasting until 1893. From 1885 to 1897 he was council member commissioned for urban planning.

Her work regularly appeared in magazines such as Scribner's Monthly, Harper's Weekly, and The Ladies Home Journal. Early life and education Alice Barber was born near Salem, New Jersey. She was the eighth of nine children born to Samuel Clayton Barber and Mary Owen, who were Quakers. She attended local schools until she and her family moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. At age 15 she became a student at the Philadelphia School of Design for Women (now Moore College of Art & Design), where she studied wood engraving. The Women's Life Class (1879), Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She was admitted to the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1876 (the first year women were admitted), studying under Thomas Eakins. Among her fellow students at the Academy were Susan MacDowell, Frank Stephens, David Wilson Jordan, Lavinia Ebbinghausen, Thomas Anshutz, and Charles H. Stephens (whom she would marry). During this time, at the academy, she began to work with a variety of media, including black-and-white oils, ink washes, charcoal, full- color oils, and watercolors. In 1879, Eakins chose Stephens to illustrate an Academy classroom scene for Scribner's Monthly. The resulting work, Women's Life Class, was Stephens' first illustration credit.  New Woman  As educational opportunities were made more available in the nineteenth century, women artists became part of professional enterprises, including founding their own art associations. Artwork made by women was considered to be inferior by the art world, and to help overcome that stereotype women became \\"increasingly vocal and confident\\" in promoting women's work, and thus became part of the emerging image of the educated, modern and freer \\"New Woman\\".Laura R. Prieto. At Home in the Studio: The Professionalization of Women Artists in America. Harvard University Press; 2001. . pp. 145–146. Artists then, \\"played crucial roles in representing the New Woman, both by drawing images of the icon and exemplifying this emerging type through their own lives.\\" Alice Barber Stephens, The Women Business, oil, 1897, Brandywine River Museum, Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania One example of overcoming women stereotypes was Stephens' Woman in Business from 1897, which showed how women could focus not only in the home, but also in the economic world. As women began to work, their career choices broadened and illustration became a commendable occupation. People's ideas about education and art started to merge, and the outcome of a certain sensitivity to the arts began to be seen as uplifting and educational. By using illustration as a means to further their practices, women were able to fit the traditional gender role while still being active in their pursuits for the \\"New Woman\\". According to Rena Robey of Art Times, \\"The early feminists began to leave the home to participate in clubs as moral and cultural guardians, focused on cleaning up cities and helping African Americans, impoverished women, working children, immigrants, and other previously ignored groups.\\" Stephens took advantage of the explosion of illustration opportunities, including the opportunity to work from home. = Women's education = Edwin Forrest House, formerly the home of the Philadelphia School of Design for Women. Throughout the period before the civil war, textile and other decorative work became acceptable occupations for those who aspired to be in the middle class. The Philadelphia School of Design for Women, founded in 1848 by Sarah Worthington Peter was first among a group of women's design schools established in the 1850s and 1860s; others appeared in Boston, New York, Pittsburgh, and Cincinnati. It began as a charitable effort to train needy and deserving young women in textile and wallpaper design, wood engraving, and other salable artistic skills, providing a means for training women who needed wage work. The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (PAFA), established in 1805 by painter and scientist Charles Willson Peale, sculptor William Rush, and other artists and business leaders. Although they both taught art and design, PAFA and the Philadelphia School of Design For Women were not of equal social importance; the School of Design remained clearly lower in the city's cultural hierarchy, both because it was a women's school and because it was dedicated to commercial art instead of the fine arts. However, curriculum changes instituted in the late 1860s moved it closer to the artistic and social orbit derived from the European academic tradition, like the Academy of Fine Arts.  Career  = Early career = In 1880, Stephens left the Academy to work full-time as an engraver. Her work was in high demand for popular illustrated magazines like Harper's, the oldest general-interest monthly magazine in America, and Century. While she frequently depicted domestic scenes featuring women and children, her illustrations defied categorization in a single genre. Stephens' connection with Harper's began in approximately 1882, as it printed the work of American artists and writers, such as Winslow Homer and Mark Twain. Much of her work was published in Harper's Young People (later known as Harper's Round Table). By the mid-1880s, however, Stephens' pace of work began to affect her health. She started to shift into pen-and-ink illustration. Her health continued to suffer, however. In an effort to recuperate, during 1886–1887, she traveled to Europe to sketch, study, and rest. In Paris, she studied at the Académie Julian and the Académie Colarossi. She exhibited two works, a pastel study and engraving, at the Paris Salon in 1887. Upon her return from Europe, Stephens resumed her illustration career with contributions to the Ladies' Home Journal and several book projects for Houghton Mifflin and Crowell publishers. Likely influenced by her European travels (and potentially by her husband), she also began painting in oil. Stephens exhibited her work at the Palace of Fine Arts and The Woman's Building at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. = Educator = In 1888, she began to teach courses at the Philadelphia School of Design for Women. Around the same time, with artist and educator Emily Sartain, she was one of the founders and officers of The Plastic Club of Philadelphia (1897), the oldest art club for women in continuous existence. During this period she also co-founded the Civic Club of Philadelphia. Among Stephens' students at the School of Design was Charlotte Harding, who became a well-known illustrator. Harding also worked for Century, Harper’s and other popular magazines at the time. Stephens later invited Harding to share her studio, located at 1004 Chestnut Street in Philadelphia. The Chestnut Street studio became a meeting point for other artists, including students from the School of the Design and the Academy of Fine Arts. = Illustrator and painter = She illustrated Sarah Orne Jewett's An Every-Day Girl (1890). Her painting The Germania Orchestra at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (1891) is now among the collection of the Biggs Museum of American Art in Dover, Delaware.Germania Orchestra at PAFA from Biggs Museum. During the mid-1890s, following the development of the halftone process, Stephens started to use more varied media, including watercolor, for her illustrations. The increasing popularity of her illustrations for mystery stories earned her the title \\"Mistress of Mysteries.\\" In 1895, The Philadelphia Inquirer noted when referring to Stephens that \\"there is scarcely any American illustrator better known to-day.\\" That year, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Stark Munro Letters was published, which was illustrated by Stephens. \\"The Nursery\\" by Alice Barber Stephens. 1898 Ivory Soap advertisement. Throughout the year 1897, Ladies' Home Journal ran a series called \\"The American Woman,\\" featuring six full-page illustrations by Stephens. The illustrations depicted the American Woman in six different settings: society, religion, home, summer, business, and motherhood. Notably, Stephens, who was both a career artist and the mother of a then-four-year-old son, chose to set three of the scenes inside the home, and three outside the home. She illustrated Mary E. Wilkins' The People of Our Neighborhood, which was published in 1898. In 1899, Stephens was invited to teach at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, but she declined the offer due to poor health. Following another European sojourn during 1901–1902, Stephens also completed illustrations for the 1903 edition of Louisa May Alcott's Little Women. During Stephens' time in Paris in 1902, Maria Christina of Spain requested that Stephens paint her portrait. Stephens continued to work as a renowned illustrator and completed illustrations for the 1903 edition of Louisa May Alcott's Little Women. She served on the jury for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis. In 1904, more commonly known as the St. Louis World's Fair. During the late 1910s, the pace of Stephens' work began to slow. She reportedly told an interviewer that she refused to work during World War I, saying it was not \\"worthwhile to make pictures in the midst of destruction.\\" In 1917, Hamlin Garland's A Son of the Middle Border was published, which was illustrated by Stephens. In the later part of her career, in the 1920s, Stephens' illustrations were made of mostly washes or charcoal with washes. She painted landscapes and portraits of Quakers and Pennsylvania Germans. By 1926, she had ceased working commercially. In 1929, the Plastic Club held a retrospective exhibition of her work in Philadelphia.  Personal life and death  Thunderbird Lodge In June 1890, Stephens married Charles Hallowell Stephens (1855-1931), an instructor at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. According to Charles' student Helen W. Henderson, Alice Barber and Charles H. Stephens had first become attached while they were both students at the Academy, and a \\"long romantic engagement\\" preceded their eventual marriage. They had one son, D. Owen Stephens (1894–1937), who also became an artist. Following a long trip abroad in 1901–1902, the Stephenses had architect Will Price convert a stone barn in the utopian community of Rose Valley, Pennsylvania into Thunderbird Lodge (1904), a sprawling house that contained studios for both of them.Thunderbird Lodge from Rose Valley Museum & Historical Society. She died in 1932 at Thunderbird Lodge at the age of 74, after having a paralytic stroke. She is buried in West Laurel Hill Cemetery in Bala-Cynwyd. Following her death, her son Owen donated a collection of Stephens' drawings to the Library of Congress, which held an exhibition during the spring of 1936. In 1984, the Brandywine River Museum featured her work in a major exhibition. Her papers are in the Archives of American Art at the Smithsonian Institution. The collection also consists of correspondence, clippings concerning Stephens' work, nine reproductions of her illustrations, photographs she had taken, an exhibition catalog for the Plastic Club (1898), a booklet about her and three award certificates (1884-1895). These items were donated in 1988 by Stephens’ granddaughter and her husband.  Awards and prizes  In 1890, she won the Mary Smith Prize for best painting for a resident woman artist at the annual Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts exhibition for her work Portrait of a Boy. At the 1895 Atlanta Exposition, a world's fair in Atlanta held to stimulate trade, she won a bronze medal and in 1899 won a gold medal at an exhibition in Earl's Court, London for her illustration of George Eliot's Middlemarch and Maria Mulock Craik's John Halifax, Gentleman. A year later, her illustrations for Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Marble Faun won a bronze medal at the Exposition Universalle in Paris.

He obtained official permission to establish a training school at what was then the small fishing village of Kobe in Settsu Province with the three-fold purpose of creating an officer’s training academy, a shipyard for the construction of modern warships, and a modern seaport. From the beginning, Katsu encountered opposition to his plans from within the shogunate, and as official funding was withheld, he was forced to support the center largely out of his own funds and the donations of a few sympathetic daimyō. The presence of a large number of pro-Sonnō jōi rōnin within the membership of the center also brought the project under suspicion, especially in the wake of the Kinmon Incident and the Ikedaya Incident, and the center was closed in mid-1865, A number of students of the Kobe Naval Training Center subsequently went on to play a major role in the Meiji Restoration, including Sakamoto Ryōma, Mutsu Munemitsu and Itō Sukeyuki.

It was formed 29 September 1924 and was one of many the sport clubs established by police and postal workers in the 1920s.Grüne, Hardy and Karn, Christian (2009). Das große Buch der Deutschen Fusballverein Kassel: Agon-Sportverlag. . Through most of its history the club has been a lower-tier local side. History Post played just a single season in the top-flight Oberliga Berlin in 1932–33, just prior to the restructuring of German football under the Third Reich. The country's existing regional leagues were replaced by 16 Gauligen and Post failed to qualify for the new Gauliga Berlin-Brandenburg (I) after its 7th place Oberliga finish. They took part in qualification for Gauliga play at the end of the 1935–36 season, but did poorly. The team's only cup appearance also took place in 1930s when they played in the 1932 Berliner Landespokal (Berlin Cup). They advanced out of the quarterfinals past Südstern Neukölln (1:0) to be put out by Hertha BSC Berlin in their semifinal matchup (2:5). Following World War II, occupying Allied authorities banned most organizations across the country, including sports and football clubs, as part of the process of de-Nazification. Post was lost in 1945 and not re-formed until 1949 when the club re-appeared as Blau-Gelb Berlin, named for the traditional blue and yellow of the national postal service. It was not until 1952 that the club resumed its historical identity as Post Sportverein Berlin.Grüne, Hardy (2001). Enzyklopädie des deutschen Ligafußballs 7. Vereinslexikon. Kassel: Agon-Sportverlag. . The division of the city into eastern and western sectors during the Cold War led to the formation of the postal workers club BSG Post Berlin which became part of the separate football competition that emerged in East Germany. In 1972, Post joined SpVgg Berlin 74 to create Post SV 1974 Berlin. Following German reunification, BSG Post Berlin became part of Post SV 74 in 1990. In 2005, the club was renamed Pro Sport Berlin 24 and does not field a senior men's side anymore but still offers women's football.

It operates Domodedovo International Airport near Moscow, although the runways are controlled by the state. Overview East Line Group's truck and jet bridge East Line was founded in 1992 as a cargo agent and freight forwarding business; after gaining control of Domodedovo airport it reduced fees and improved ground transport to attract customers. In 1993–1994, East Line Group, founded by Urals entrepreneurs Anton Bakov and Dmitry Kamenschik, Ветеран обороны Домодедово — «Коммерсантъ», 7.10.2013 who built capital in the early 1990s on hauling cargo from Asian countries to Russia, invested in several facilities at Domodedovo, including a new customs terminal and catering services. In late 1996, Kamenschik-led East Line Group privatized the terminal facilities of Domodedovo Airport and formed JSC 'International Airport Domodedovo' and several other commercial entities controlling the airfield operations at the airport. Since 1998, the runways, air traffic control, and communication facilities are formally on a lease to the subsidiary of East Line Group. In December 2010, East Line displaced director Vyacheslav Nekrasov, following disruption at Domodedovo caused by electrical problems and severe winter weather. East Line has recently reconstructed more airport facilities, and has continued to attract more passengers and more airlines. Domodedovo is now the busiest airport in Russia; there are plans to construct a third runway. Double-level passenger bridges were installed in May 2012, to support the Airbus A380 which will be used on some Emirates flights to Domodedovo.

The illegality of a transaction, either because of public policy under the common law, or because of legislation, potentially means no action directly concerning the deal will be heard by the courts. The doctrine is reminiscent of the Latin phrase \\"Ex turpi causa non oritur actio\\", meaning \\"no cause of action arises from a wrong\\". The primary problem arising when courts refuse to enforce an agreement is the extent to which an innocent party may recover any property already conveyed through the transaction. Hence, illegality raises important questions for English unjust enrichment law. Overview One of the earliest reported cases is Everet v Williams (1725) where two Highwayman had a legal dispute over the proceeds of their robberies. The court declined to entertain the suit, and both litigants were later hanged. In another early case, Holman v Johnson (1775) 1 Cowp 341, 343 Lord Mansfield CJ set out the rationale for the illegality doctrine.

Tort In the law of tort, the principle would prevent a criminal from bringing a claim against (for example) a fellow criminal. In National Coal Board v EnglandNational Coal Board v England [1954] AC 403, House of Lords (UK). Lord Asquith said, In Hewison v Meridian Shipping Services Pte Ltd,. an employee who had obtained his position by concealing his epilepsy was held not to be entitled to claim compensation for future loss of earnings as a result of his employer's negligence, since his deception (resulting in a pecuniary advantage contrary to the Theft Act 1968) would prevent him from obtaining similar employment in future. It is not absolute in effect. For example, in Revill v Newberry. an elderly allotment holder was sleeping in his shed with a shotgun, to deter burglars. On hearing the plaintiff trying to break in, he shot his gun through a hole in the shed, injuring the plaintiff. At first instance, the defendant attempted to raise the defence of ex turpi to avoid the claim; this failed and he appealed against the decision. The Court of Appeal dismissed the defendant's appeal, holding that he was negligent to have shot blindly at body height, without shouting a warning or shooting a warning shot into the air, and that the response was out of all proportion to the threat. The precise scope of the doctrine is not certain. In some cases, it seems that the illegality prevents a duty of care arising in the first place. For example, in Ashton v TurnerAshton v Turner [1981] QB 137, High Court of Justice (England and Wales). the defendant crashed a car in the course of getting away from the scene of a burglary, injuring the plaintiff. Ewbank J held that the court may not recognise a duty of care in such cases as a matter of public policy. Similarly, in Pitts v Hunt,. Balcombe LJ of the Court of Appeal rationalised this approach, saying that it was impossible to decide the appropriate standard of care in cases where the parties were involved in illegality. However, the other two judges, although reached the same conclusion, took different approaches. Beldam LJ favoured a public conscience approach which considers whether the general public would be outraged or view the court as indirectly encouraging a criminal act if they were to award damages. Dillon LJ meanwhile provided little practical guidance in his approach where the defence of illegality is successful when a claimant's cause of action arises \\"directly ex turpi causa\\". Trusts The courts view ex turpi as a defence where otherwise a claim would lie, again on grounds of public policy. In Tinsley v MilliganTinsley v Milligan [1992] Ch 310, Court of Appeal (England and Wales). Nicholls LJ in the Court of Appeal spoke of the court having to \\"weigh or balance the adverse consequences of granting relief against the adverse consequences of refusing relief\\". The plaintiff was ultimately successful in Tinsley v Milligan in the House of Lords, which allowed the claim on the grounds that the plaintiff did not need to rely on the illegality..

During his lifetime, Vollon was a successful celebrity, enjoyed an excellent reputation, and was called a \\"painter's painter\\". In 2004, New York's then-PaceWildenstein gallery suggested that his \\"place in the history of French painting has still not been properly assessed\\". Family and early years Vollon was born the son of an ornamental craftsman in Lyon, France. He taught himself to paint. He began an apprenticeship to an engraver, and studied under Jehan Georges Vibert at the École des Beaux-Arts in Lyon to become a printmaker. He then worked at decorating enamelled pans and stoves. In 1860 he and Marie-Fanny Boucher married and later had two children, Alexis and Marguerite. Paris and becoming a painter In 1859 he moved to Paris, with the intention of becoming a painter. There he became a student of Théodule Ribot and was influenced by Dutch still life painters of the 17th century. He became friends with Alexandre Dumas, Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux, Honoré Daumier and Charles-François Daubigny. Vollon once described himself as a young artist \\"madly in love with painting\\". Figures and still lifes Mound of Butter (1875–85; National Gallery of Art) was said to look so real that it might have been painted with butter itself. Vollon aspired to paint figures and not only still lifes which were the lowest acceptable genre for the Salon. He submitted a figure painting of a woman carrying a large basket on her back, Femme du Pollet à Dieppe (Seine-Inferieure), to the 1876 Salon, where it won first prize and received universally great reviews. However it was criticised by Édouard Manet, who unleashed a few words, in () which stigmatized it. According to Carol Forman Tabler, curator and professor of art who wrote her dissertation on Vollon, writing for Nineteenth-Century Art Worldwide: Later years and awards Petit Carol Forman Tabler wrote: Tabler describes his ambition and the decades-long strategies Vollon used to secure a place in history. After one year in the Salon des Refusés in 1863, beginning in 1864 he exhibited his work at the Paris Salon. Vollon won a third-class medal in 1865, a second- class in 1868, and first-class in 1869. Vollon was a member of the Salon's jury for at least ten years starting in 1870. Jean-Baptiste Olive's (1848-1936) still lifes were influenced by his works. Vollon also had students, among whom were Raymond Allègre (1857-1933), Joseph Garibaldi (1863-1941), Henri Michel-Lévy (1845-1914), Théo Mayan (1860-1936) and Gustave le Sénéchal de Kerdréoret (1840-1933). He became a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor in 1870, and eight years later received the Officer's cross. He was elected to the Académie des Beaux-Arts in 1897. In 1900 he was awarded the Grand Prix at the Paris World's Fair. In July of that same year Vollon suffered a stroke while painting at Versailles and later caught a fever. He died shortly thereafter, on 27 August 1900, at the age of 66. He is buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery, in the 20th arrondissement of Paris. Legacy A restaurant on Rue Antoine Vollon in Paris Wildenstein showed more than 70 works by Vollon in Manhattan in 2004. For The New York Times, a reviewer wrote, \\"Vollon smacks too much of other artists to be Truly Important, but his sensuous wallows in paint are well worth wider notice\\". But an earlier reviewer for the same newspaper quotes a critic writing in 1883, \\"He is, perhaps, the greatest painter living....\\" His son Alexis Vollon (1865–1945) became a painter. Two streets in France are named for him: Rue Antoine Vollon in Bessancourt and in Paris, whilst an intersection with a fountain in Lyon is named Place Antoine Vollon.

The route runs to the north, essentially parallel to the current alignment of US 281. It has an intersection with RM 165 before crossing the Blanco River. Access to the north bank of the river and Blanco State Park is provided by Park Road 23. Loop 163 turns to the west and ends at an intersection with US 281 in downtown Blanco; the road continues to the northwest as RM 1623. Because Loop 163 provides a connection between RM 165 and US 281, signage from US 281 at both ends of Loop 163 also contains the RM 165 route marker. History Loop 163 was designated on June 1, 1960. The route is a former alignment of US 281 through Blanco. 50px A previous route designated Spur 163 was designated on February 27, 1945 from US 59 & Main Street through Houston to US 59.

Unlike squid, belemnites had an internal skeleton that made up the cone. The parts are, from the arms-most to the tip: the tongue-shaped pro-ostracum, the conical phragmocone, and the pointy guard. The calcitic guard is the most common belemnite remain. Belemnites, in life, are thought to have had 10 hooked arms and a pair of fins on the guard. The chitinous hooks were usually no bigger than , though a belemnite could have had between 100 and 800 hooks in total, using them to stab and hold onto prey. Belemnites were an important food source for many Mesozoic marine creatures, both the adults and the planktonic juveniles, and likely played an important role in restructuring marine ecosystems after the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event. They may have laid between 100 and 1,000 eggs. Some species may have been adapted to speed and swam in the turbulent open ocean, whereas others resided in the calmer littoral zone (nearshore) and fed off the seafloor. The largest belemnite known, Megateuthis elliptica, had guards of . Belemnites were coleoids, a group that includes squid and octopuses, and are often grouped into the superorder Belemnoidea, though the higher classification of cephalopods is volatile and there is no clear consensus how belemnites are related to modern coleoids. Guards can give information on the climate, habitat, and the carbon cycle of the ancient waters they inhabited. Guards have been found since antiquity and have become part of folklore. Description =Shell= Cone diagram: r pro-ostracum, a alveolus, p phragmocone, g guard The belemnite cone is composed of three parts. Going from arms to tip, these are the tongue-shaped pro-ostracum; the conical, chambered phragmocone; and the spear-shaped guard at the very tip. The guard attached to the phragmocone in a socket called the alveolus. The cone, in life, would have been encased in muscle and connective tissue. They had calcite guards, and aragonite pro-ostraca and phragmocones, though a few belemnites also had aragonite guards, and the alveolar side of the guards of belemnitellids may have also been of aragonite. The pro-ostracum probably supported the soft parts of the belemnite, similar to the gladius of squid, and completely surrounded the phragmocone. The phragmocone was divided by septa into chambers, much like the shells of cuttlefish and nautiluses. The chambered phragmocone was probably the center of buoyancy, and so was positioned directly above the center of mass for stability purposes. In regards to buoyancy, belemnites may have behaved much like modern ram's horn squid, having the chambers of the phragmocone flooded and slowly releasing more seawater via the siphuncle tube as the animal increases in size and weight over its lifetime to maintain neutral buoyancy. At the tip of the phragmocone beneath the guard is a tiny, cup-like protoconch, the remains of the embryonic shell. The dense guard probably served to counterbalance the weight of the soft parts in the mantle cavity near the arms on the opposite end of the animal, analogous to the camera of nautiloids. This would have allowed the animal to move horizontally through the water. The guard may have also served to cut through waves while swimming at the surface, though modern cephalopods generally stay completely submerged. Though unlikely, it is possible fossilization increased the perceived density of the guard, and it may have been up to 20% more porous in life. Fins may have been attached to the guard, or the guard may have lent support for large fins. Including arms, guards could have accounted for one fifth to one third of the total length of a belemnite. =Soft anatomy= Belemnites had a radula—the mouth—embedded in the buccal mass—the first part of a gastropod digestive system—similar to open ocean predatory cephalopods. The radula had rows of seven teeth, consistent with modern predatory squid. The statocysts—which give a sense of balance and function much like the cochlea of the ear—were large, much like in modern fast-moving squid. Like other cephalopods, the skin was likely thin and slippery. The eyeballs were likely thicker, stronger, and more convex than in other cephalopods. The mantle cavity of cephalopods serves to contain the gills, gonads, and other organs; also, water is siphoned into and expelled out of the mantle cavity via a tube opening near the arms of the animal, the hyponome, for jet propulsion. Though the hyponome was well-developed in belemnites, the phragmocone was large, implying a small mantle cavity and thus less jet propulsion efficiency. Like some modern squid, belemnites may have mainly used large fins to coast along currents. Two Acanthoteuthis specimens with preserved soft anatomy elements had a pair of rhomboid fins near the top of their guards; however, the specimens had different sized fins, possibly owing to sexual dimorphism, age, or distortion during fossilization. These specimens appeared to have had similar adaptations to modern squid for speed, and may have been able to reach similar maximum speeds of like modern migrating Todarodes flying squid. Reconstruction of a typical belemnite =Limbs and hooks= Belemnites had 10 hooked arms of, more or less, equal length with suckers. The hooks were rarely larger than , and increased in size towards the midsection of the arm, possibly because the midsection is where maximum power could be exerted when grabbing, or bigger hooks on the extremities of the arm increased the risk of losing the arm. Having two rows of hooks covering the entire breadth of the arm, a belemnite could have had between 100 and 800 hooks in total. Some hooks have a spur just above the base, but this may be a distortion from fossilization or preparation of the material. The chitinous hooks are subdivided into three sections: the base—which can be either flat or concave—the shaft—which projects either upward at an incline either straight or bent—and the uncinus—which can be hook- or sabre-like. Overall, they were fish-hook shaped, and probably only the uncinus was exposed. Different hook shapes were probably specialized for certain tasks, for example, a strongly hooked uncinus was designed to stab prey at a constant angle and force, and sink in deeper if the prey tried to move away from the belemnite. Hook shapes and forms vary species to species. In Chondroteuthis, large hooks were common near the mouth, and were either used for surrounding small prey or ramming into large prey; however, these large hooks were not present in a small specimen, indicating it was either a juvenile—and the development of different hooks coincided with a difference in prey selection—or the specimen was a female and the hooks were used by males for male-on-male combat or during copulation. In modern hook-bearing squid species, only matured males have hooks, indicating a reproductive purpose. It is possible the hooks, being analogous to suckers, could move. The Jurassic Youngibelus reconstructed with hectocotyli The males, like in modern squid, probably had one or two hectocotyli—long, modified arms used in copulation or combat with other males. Instead of several hooks, the hectocotyli feature a pair of enlarged hooks—mega-onychites—to latch onto the female at a safe distance to prevent getting stuck with one of her hooks. Like squid, the positioning of the mega-onychites could have been either at the tip or origin of the arm depending on the species. Copulation probably involved the male depositing spermatophores into the female's internal mantle chamber. =Development= Cephalopod embryonic shells. A) Ammonoidea (B) Sepiida (C) Belemnoidea (D) Spirulida (E) Orthocerida (F) Nautilida (G) Oncocerida (H) Pseudorthocerida (I) Oegopsina (J) Bactritida. IC indicates the initial chamber. Like other cephalopods, belemnites may have laid floating-egg masses, and single female may have laid between 100 and 1,000 eggs. Hatchlings were either miniature forms of adults or went through a larval stage. According to the latter model, the egg was formed by the protoconch and a single-layered shell wall. During the larval stage, the protoconch became internal and the guard began to form. The embryo of Passaloteuthis, the most well-studied among belemnite embryos, had a protoconch, a developing guard, and a solid guard. The developing guard tightly surrounded the protoconch. The embryonic shell consisted of an ovoid protoconch and several chambers. The protoconch had two layers, and several compartments—called \\"protoconch pockets\\"—formed between the layers, which may have stored gas or liquid in life to stay buoyant. The protoconch and guard were probably made of chitin, a protective material which may have allowed the embryo to survive at greater depths and colder temperatures, develop into adults faster, and allow juveniles and adults to venture into deeper waters. Further, the protoconch would have allowed them to form limbs before reaching the phragmocone stage, and thus inhabit the open ocean earlier. These may have allowed belemnites to colonize a range of habitats across the world. Much like in cuttlefish, nautiluses, and ammonites, the number and successive size of the chambers of the phragmocone are used to analyze the growth of an individual over their life. Successive belemnite chambers tend to increase in size exponentially. Unlike other cephalopods, there is no decreasing trend of chamber size in the earliest stages. The decreasing trend generally coincides with hatching, meaning embryonic belemnites had no or few chambers and hatched only with a protoconch. The phragmocone, thus, developed after hatching. Ammonites are thought to have done the same, implying a similar reproductive strategy, and, considering both reached cosmopolitan distributions, a rather efficient one. Belemnite hatchling protoconches are estimated to have been generally around . The guards of Megateuthis elliptica are the largest among belemnites, measuring in length and up to in diameter. The Cretaceous Neohibolites is one of the smallest known with a guard length of around . In the New Zealand Belemnopsis, four major annual growth stages were preserved in the guard, giving belemnites a lifespan of about three to four years. The mesohibolitid belemnites, using the same methods, had a lifespan of about a year. In Megateuthis, the guard was demonstrated to have fully developed after one or two years, and growth spurts followed the lunar cycle. =Pathology= MRI of a deformed Late Cretaceous Gonioteuthis guard Belemnite guards have sometimes been found with fractures with signs of healing. It has been interpreted in the past that these are evidence of digging, with belemnites using their guard to dig up prey on the seafloor; however, belemnites are now generally interpreted to have been open ocean predators. A deformed, zigzag-like guard of a Gonioteuthis was likely the result of a failed predation attempt. Two other Gonioteuthis guard specimens exhibit a double-pointed tip, probably stemming from some traumatic event. One belemnite guard also presents a double-pointed tip, with one of the points projecting higher than the other, probably a sign of an infection or settlement of a parasite. A Neoclavibelus guard features a large growth on the side likely stemming from a parasitic infection. A Hibolithes guard shows a large ovoid bubble near the base, likely deriving from a parasitic cyst. A Goniocamax guard has several blister-like formations, thought to have come from a polychaete flatworm infection. The calcitic guards were apparently desirable habitats for boring parasites indicated by the diversity of trace fossils left on some guards, including the sponge Entobia, worm Trypanites, and barnacle Rogerella. Taxonomy =Evolution= Map of the world in the Late Triassic Belemnites, being coleoids, derive from the orthoconic (conical) Devonian belemnoid order Aulacocerida, which, in turn, derived from the Devonian Bactritida. Belemnites were traditionally thought to have evolved in northern Europe in the Hettangian stage of the Early Jurassic 201.6–197 million years ago (mya) and later spread to the rest of the world by the Pliensbachian stage 190 mya. However, the 2012 discovery of early Asian forms—classified into the family Sinobelemnitidae—now moves this to around 234 mya in the Carnian stage of the Late Triassic. Belemnites probably originated in the Asian part of the Panthalassic Ocean around the eastern coasts of the ancient continent of Laurasia in a cephalopod radiation, alongside the octopus-like Prototeuthina and the belemnoid Phragmoteuthida. However, there is a dubious Permian occurrence, the Palaeobelemnopsidae, reported from Southern China. By the Early Jurassic, belemnites were probably quite common, having spread out into the western Laurasian coasts as well as Gondwanan waters to the south. Guard shapes in the early Jurassic ranged from conical to spearheaded, but spearheaded became more prevalent as the Jurassic progressed. This was probably due to pressure to become more streamlined and increase swimming efficiency, coevolving with increasingly faster predators and competitors. Their early evolution and apparent abundance were likely important in reconstructing marine ecosystems after the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event, providing an ample food source for marine reptiles and sharks. Belemnoidea, as a group, seemed to feature a reduction of the projection of the otherwise conical phragmocone into the pro-ostracum. That of the most ancient order Aulacocerida is orthoconic (none projects), Phragmoteuthida three-quarters projects, Belemnitida a quarter, and the most developed Diplobelida an eighth. =Research history= Opalized Peratobelus guard from the Early Cretaceous The first mention of belemnites in writing comes from the Greek philosopher Theophrastus, who lived in the 4th and 3rd century BCE, in his book De Animalibus Quæ Dicuntur Invidere who described it as lyngurium, lynx urine which had been buried and solidified. Pliny the Elder, in the first century CE, did not believe in lyngurium, and called the gemstone a belemnite for the first time—though not recognizing it as a fossil. The name is from Ancient Greek βέλεμνον bélemnon meaning dart for the guard's shape. Subsequent authors either considered it to be lyngurium or amber. The first mention of a belemnite representing a fossil was made in 1546 by German mineralogist Georgius Agricola, and subsequent authors gave several hypotheses to its nature in life, including them being shellfish, sea urchin spines, sea cucumbers, coral polyps, or some internal shell. In 1823, English naturalist John Samuel Miller classified belemnites as cephalopods, comparing the newly discovered phragmocone remains to that of a nautilus, and concluding a resemblance to Sepia cuttlefish. He also erected the genus Belemnites with 11 species. This classification was confirmed when the first impressions of belemnite soft body anatomy were described by English paleontologist Richard Owen in 1844. In 1895, German paleontologist Karl Alfred Ritter von Zittel organized the clade Belemnoidea and included the families Belemnitidae, Asteroconites, and Xiphoteuthis. Hibolites from the early Cretaceous at the State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart The guard—also known as the rostrum, scabbard, gaine, and sheath—is the part of the animal most likely to be fossilized. Guards are difficult to distinguish at the species level, and, consequently, synonyms are common and inflate the group's apparent diversity. Preserved hooks can be used to distinguish belemnite species as each species has unique hook shapes. However, scolecodont segmented worm fossils have been mistaken for belemnite hooks and vice versa. Preserved fossil guards are used to measure the ancient isotopic signature of the waters the individual inhabited in life, which gives information on the climate, habitat, and the carbon cycle. =Phylogeny= Belemnites were cephalopods. Having no outer shells, they are classified into the subclass Coleoidea. In 1994, American geologist Peter Doyle defined Coleoidea as composing of three superorders: Decapodiformes (squid and cuttlefish), Octopodiformes (octopuses), and Belemnoidea; with Belemnoidea containing the orders Aulacocerida, Diplobelida, and Belemnitida. Also, the order Phragmoteuthida is sometimes believed to be a sister group to Belemnoidea, but Doyle considered it to be a stem-group to Decapodiformes and Octopodiformes. However, the higher classification of cephalopods is volatile with no clear consensus. Coleoidea is sometimes divided into Neocoleoidea (containing all modern cephalopods) and Paleocoleoidea (containing Belemnoidea), so belemnites would be a sister group of modern cephalopods. However, this grouping is probably paraphyletic—it does not contain a common ancestor and all its descendants—and, thus, invalid. According to some authors, belemnites were a stem-group of Decapodiformes: According to the \\"belemnoid root-stock theory\\", belemnoids gave rise to modern coleoids some time in the Mesozoic, with octopuses deriving from Phragmoteuthida and squid from Diplobelida, making Belemnoidea paraphyletic. The spirulid Longibelus could be a transitional species between belemnoids and squid. However, molecular evidence suggests that the squid and octopus lineage diverged from Belemnoidea in the Permian. The order Belemnitida is a monophyletic taxon, consisting of a common ancestor and all of its descendants, and is characterized by the possession of ten hooked appendages, a multilayered outer wall of the phragmocone, and a septum between the pro- ostracum and the phragmocone. Belemnitida is separated into two suborders: Belemnitina and Belemnopseina, though a third possible suborder may exist with Sinobelemnitidae. The Belemnopseina guards have a groove on their alveolus, whereas the Belemnitina have a groove at their apex. The grooves probably corresponded to blood vessels. Another suborder, Belemnotheutina, is also proposed, whose members have an aragonitic guard in contrast to the calcitic guards of other belemnites. Aragonitic guards are usually only seen in the ancestral Aulacocerida belemnoids, and Belemnotheutina may represent a transitional stage between the two orders, though some believe Belemnitida derived from Phragmoteuthida which derived from Aulacocerida. *Family Dimitobelidae **Conobelus **Dimitobelus **Pumiliobelus *Family Belemnitellidae **Actinocamax **Belemnitella **Belemnites *Family Belemnopseidae **Belemnopsis **Vaunagites *Family Cylindroteuthidae **Cylindroteuthis *Family Dicoelitidae **Dicoelites *Family Duvaliidae **Duvalia **Pseudobelus **Rhopaloteuthis **Pseudoduvalia *Family Hastitidae **Hastites **Pleurobelus **Rhabdobelus **Bairstowius *Family Halcobelidae **Holcobelus **Calabribelus **Lissajousibelus *Family Megateuthidae **Acrocoelites **Cuspiteuthis **Dactyloteuthis **Megateuthis *Family Mesohibolithidae **Curtohibolithes **Hibolithes **Mesohibolithes *Family Nipponoteuthidae **Nipponoteuthis *Family Oxyteuthidae **Oxyteuthis *Family Passaloteuthidae **Acroteuthis **Angeloteuthis **Brevibelus **Clastoteuthis **Parapassaloteuthis **Passaloteuthis **Pseudohastites *Family Pseudodicoelitidae **Pseudodicoelites *Family Salpingoteuthidae **Salpingoteuthis *Family Sinobelemnitidae **Sichuanobelus *Incertae sedis **Aulacoteuthis **Belemnella **Coeloteuthis **Eobelemnites **Gonioteuthis **Nannobelus **Pachyteuthis **Simpsonibelus **Youngibelus **Rhaphibelus **Winkleriteuthis Paleoecology =Habitat= Belemnites with Early Jurassic Dactylioceras ammonites Belemnite remains are found in what were littoral (nearshore) and mid-shelf zones. To hunt, they may have quickly or stealthily grabbed prey, maintaining a grip with the hooks, and then dove down to eat. It is traditionally thought they resided on the shelf their entire life, and preyed on crustaceans and other mollusks. Belemnites with slender guards may have been better swimmers than those with more massive guards, with the former having dived into deeper waters and hunted in the open ocean; and the latter restricted to the nearshore and fed from the seafloor. Broadly speaking, they may have preferred temperatures of , and, like modern squid, warmer waters may have heightened their metabolism, increasing birth and growth rates, but also decreasing lifespan. It has been suggested that most belemnite species were stenothermic, inhabiting only a narrow range of temperatures, though Neohibolites had a cosmopolitan distribution during the Cretaceous Thermal Maximum, a period of dramatic increase of global temperatures. =Mortality= The shark Hybodus with belemnite guards in its stomach, State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart Belemnites were likely an abundant and important food source to many sea-going creatures of the Mesozoic. Belemnite hook remains have been found in the stomach contents of crocodilians, plesiosaurs, and ichthyosaurs; and the coprolite remains of ichthyosaurs and the extinct thylacocephalan crustaceans. Some animals may have only eaten the heads, leaving the phragmocone and guards, however, the guards of around 250 Acrocoelites were found in the stomach of a Hybodus shark, and a fragment in an Oxford Clay marine crocodile, meaning they were eaten whole. It may be that they were to regurgitate the indigestible matter later, similar to the modern sperm whale. To defend themselves, belemnites likely were able to eject a cloud of ink. The abundant planktonic belemnite larvae, along with planktonic ammonite larvae, likely formed the base of Mesozoic food webs, serving a greater ecological function than the adults. Giant pachycormid fish are thought to have been the main filter feeders of the time, occupying the same niche as modern baleen whales. A large aggregation of belemnite guards Large accumulations of guards are commonly found and have been nicknamed \\"belemnite battlefields\\". The most quoted explanation is that belemnites were semelparous and died shortly after spawning, much like modern coleoids which migrate from the ocean to the shelf area. In battlefields comprising both adults and juveniles—as the former model would consist entirely of adults—large groups of belemnites may have been killed by volcanism, changes in salinity or temperature, harmful algal blooms (and, thereby, anoxia), or mass stranding. Another popular theory is that the guards were simply moved or redeposited by ocean currents into large aggregations. Some battlefields may be regurgitated indigestible matter from a predator. =Extinction= Squid and octopuses diversified and began to outcompete belemnites by the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous. Belemnites declined through the Late Cretaceous, and their range became more restricted to the polar regions; the southern populations became extinct in the early Maastrichtian, and the last belemnites—of the family Belemnitellidae—inhabited what is now northern Europe. They finally became extinct in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, around 66 mya, where, like in ammonites, it is thought the protoconch of embryos could not survive the ensuing acidification of the oceans. However, the dubious genus Bayanoteuthis is reported from the Eocene, though this is often excluded from Belemnitida. Following the extinction of the belemnites at the end of the Cretaceous, holoplanktonic gastropods, namely sea butterflies, replaced planktonic belemnite larvae at the base of the food chain. In culture Belemnite guards have been known since antiquity, and much folklore has evolved since. Before belemnites were identified as fossils, it was believed the guards were some gemstone, namely lyngurium and amber. After a thunderstorm, guards would sometimes be left exposed in the soil, explained as lightning bolts thrown from the sky. This belief still persists in parts of rural Britain. In Germanic folklore, belemnites are known by at least 27 different names, such as Fingerstein (\\"finger stone\\"), Teufelsfinger (\\"Devil's finger\\"), and Gespensterkerze (\\"ghostly candle\\"). In Southern England, the pointy guards were used to cure rheumatism, ground up to cure sore eyes (which only aggravated the problem), and, in Western Scotland, put into water to cure distemper in their horses. Belemnitella was declared the state fossil of Delaware on 2 July 1996.

Eventually, the wars eliminated the male lines of both families. The conflict lasted through many sporadic episodes between 1455 and 1487, but there was related fighting before and after this period between the parties. The power struggle ignited around social and financial troubles following the Hundred Years' War, unfolding the structural problems of bastard feudalism, combined with the mental infirmity and weak rule of King Henry VI which revived interest in the House of York's claim to the throne by Richard of York. Historians disagree on which of these factors was the main reason for the wars. With Richard of York's death in 1460, the claim transferred to his heir, Edward. After a series of Yorkist victories from January–February 1461, Edward claimed the throne on 4 March 1461, and the last serious Lancastrian resistance ended at the decisive Battle of Towton. Edward was thus unopposed as the first Yorkist king of England, as Edward IV. Resistance smouldered in the North of England until 1464, but the early part of his reign remained relatively peaceful. A new phase of the wars broke out in 1469 after the Earl of Warwick, the most powerful noble in the country, withdrew his support for Edward and threw it behind the Lancastrian cause. Fortunes changed many times as the Yorkist and Lancastrian forces exchanged victories throughout 1469–70 (and Edward was even captured for a time in 1469). When Edward fled to Flanders in 1470, Henry VI was re-installed as king on 3 October 1470, but his resumption of rule was short-lived, and he was deposed again following the defeat of his forces at the Battle of Tewkesbury, and on 21 May 1471, Edward entered London unopposed, resumed the throne, and probably had Henry killed that same day. With all significant Lancastrian leaders now banished or killed, Edward ruled unopposed until his sudden death in 1483. His 12-year-old son reigned for 78 days as Edward V. He was then deposed by his uncle, Edward IV's brother Richard, who became Richard III. The accession of Richard III occurred under a cloud of controversy, and shortly after assuming the throne, the wars sparked anew with Buckingham's rebellion, as many die-hard Yorkists abandoned Richard to join Lancastrians. While the rebellions lacked much central coordination, in the chaos the exiled Henry Tudor, son of Henry VI's half-brother Edmund Earl of Richmond, and the leader of the Lancastrian cause returned to the country from exile in Brittany at the head of an army of combined Breton, French and English forces. Richard avoided direct conflict with Henry until the Battle of Bosworth Field on 22 August 1485. After Richard III was killed and his forces defeated at Bosworth Field, Henry assumed the throne as Henry VII and married Elizabeth of York, the eldest daughter and heir of Edward IV, thereby uniting the two claims. The House of Tudor ruled the Kingdom of England until 1603, with the death of Elizabeth I, granddaughter of Henry VII and Elizabeth of York. Shortly after Henry took the throne, the Earl of Lincoln, a Yorkist sympathizer, put forward Lambert Simnel as an impostor Edward Plantagenet, a potential claimant to the throne. Lincoln's forces were defeated, and he was killed at the Battle of Stoke Field on 16 June 1487. Name and symbols The name \\"Wars of the Roses\\" refers to the heraldic badges associated with two rival branches of the same royal house, the White Rose of York and the Red Rose of Lancaster. Wars of the Roses came into common use in the 19th century after the publication in 1829 of Anne of Geierstein by Sir Walter Scott.During Shakespeare's time people used the term Civil Wars: cf. e.g., the title of Samuel Daniel's work, the First Four Books of the Civil Wars Scott based the name on a scene in William Shakespeare's play Henry VI, Part 1 (Act 2, Scene 4), set in the gardens of the Temple Church, where a number of noblemen and a lawyer pick red or white roses to show their loyalty to the Lancastrian or Yorkist faction respectively. The Yorkist faction used the symbol of the white rose from early in the conflict, but the Lancastrian red rose was introduced only after the victory of Henry Tudor at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, when it was combined with the Yorkist white rose to form the Tudor rose, which symbolised the union of the two houses; the origins of the Rose as a cognizance itself stem from Edward I's use of \\"a golden rose stalked proper.\\" Often, owing to nobles holding multiple titles, more than one badge was used: Edward IV, for example, used both his sun in splendour as Earl of March, but also his father's falcon and fetterlock as Duke of York. Badges were not always distinct; at the Battle of Barnet, Edward's 'sun' was very similar to the Earl of Oxford's Vere star, which caused fateful confusion. Most, but not all, of the participants in the wars wore livery badges associated with their immediate lords or patrons under the prevailing system of bastard feudalism; the wearing of livery was by now confined to those in \\"continuous employ of a lord\\", thus excluding, for example, mercenaries. Another example: Henry Tudor's forces at Bosworth fought under the banner of a red dragon while the Yorkist army used Richard III's personal device of a white boar. Although the names of the rival houses derive from the cities of York and Lancaster, the corresponding duchy and dukedom had little to do with these cities. The lands and offices attached to the Duchy of Lancaster were mainly in Gloucestershire, North Wales, Cheshire, and (ironically) in Yorkshire, while the estates and castles of the Duke of York were spread throughout England and Wales, many in the Welsh Marches. Summary of events Important locations in the Wars of the Roses Tensions within England during the 1450s centred on the mental state of Henry VI and on his inability to produce an heir with his wife, Margaret of Anjou. In the absence of a direct heir, there were two rival branches with claims to the throne should Henry die without issue, those being the Beaufort family, led by Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset, and the House of York, headed by Richard of York. By 1453, issues had come to a head: though Margaret of Anjou was pregnant, Henry VI was descending into increasing mental instability, by August becoming completely non-responsive and unable to govern. A Great Council of nobles was called, and through shrewd political machinations, Richard had himself declared Lord Protector and chief regent during the mental incapacity of Henry. In the interlude, Margaret gave birth to a healthy son and heir, Edward of Westminster. By 1455, Henry had regained his faculties, and open warfare came at the First Battle of St Albans. Several prominent Lancastrians died at the hands of the Yorkists. Henry was again imprisoned, and Richard of York resumed his role as Lord Protector. Although peace was temporarily restored, the Lancastrians were inspired by Margaret of Anjou to contest York's influence. Fighting resumed more violently in 1459. York and his supporters were forced to flee the country, and Henry was once again restored to direct rule, but one of York's most prominent supporters, the Earl of Warwick, invaded England from Calais in October 1460 and captured Henry VI yet again at the Battle of Northampton. York returned to the country and for the third time became Protector of England, but was dissuaded from claiming the throne, though it was agreed that he would become heir to the throne (thus displacing Henry and Margaret's son, Edward of Westminster, from the line of succession). Margaret and the remaining Lancastrian nobles gathered their army in the north of England. When York moved north to engage them, he and his second son Edmund were killed at the Battle of Wakefield in December 1460. The Lancastrian army advanced south and released Henry at the Second Battle of St Albans but failed to occupy London and subsequently retreated to the north. York's eldest son Edward, Earl of March, was proclaimed King Edward IV. He gathered the Yorkist armies and won a crushing victory at the Battle of Towton in March 1461. After Lancastrian revolts in the north were suppressed in 1464, Henry was captured once again and placed in the Tower of London. Edward fell out with his chief supporter and adviser, the Earl of Warwick (known as the \\"Kingmaker\\"), after Edward's unpopular and secretly-conducted marriage with the widow of a Lancastrian supporter, Elizabeth Woodville. Within a few years, it became clear that Edward was favouring his wife's family and alienating several friends closely aligned with Warwick as well. A near-contemporary Flemish picture of the Battle of Barnet in 1471 Furious, Warwick tried first to supplant Edward with his younger brother George, Duke of Clarence, establishing the alliance by marriage to his daughter, Isabel Neville. When that plan failed, due to lack of support from Parliament, Warwick sailed to France with his family and allied with the former Lancastrian Queen, Margaret of Anjou, to restore Henry VI to the throne. This resulted in two years of rapid changes of fortune before Edward IV once again won complete victories at Barnet (14 April 1471), where Warwick was killed, and Tewkesbury (4 May 1471), where the Lancastrian heir, Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales was killed or perhaps executed after the battle. Queen Margaret was escorted to London as a prisoner, and Henry was murdered in the Tower of London several days later, ending the direct Lancastrian line of succession. A period of comparative peace followed, ending with the unexpected death of King Edward in 1483. His surviving brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, first moved to prevent the unpopular Woodville family of Edward's widow from participating in the government during the minority of Edward's son, Edward V, and then seized the throne for himself, using the suspect legitimacy of Edward IV's marriage as pretext. Henry Tudor, a distant relative of the Lancastrian kings who had inherited their claim, defeated Richard III at Bosworth in 1485. He was crowned Henry VII and married Elizabeth of York, daughter of Edward IV, to unite and reconcile the two houses. Yorkist revolts, directed by John de la Pole, 1st Earl of Lincoln and others, flared up in 1487 under the banner of the pretender Lambert Simnel—who claimed he was Edward, Earl of Warwick (son of George of Clarence), resulting in the last pitched battles. Though most surviving descendants of Richard of York were imprisoned, sporadic rebellions continued until 1497, when Perkin Warbeck, who claimed he was the younger brother of Edward V, one of the two disappeared Princes in the Tower, was imprisoned and later executed. Origins of the conflict =Disputed succession= In the early Middle Ages, the succession to the crown was open to any member (Ætheling) of the royal family. From the 9th century, the term was used in a much narrower context and came to refer exclusively to members of the house of Cerdic of Wessex, the ruling dynasty of Wessex, most particularly the sons or brothers of the reigning king. According to historian Richard Abels \\"King Alfred transformed the very principle of royal succession. Before Alfred, any nobleman who could claim royal descent, no matter how distant, could strive for the throne. After him, throne-worthiness would be limited to the sons and brothers of the reigning king.\\" Alfred himself succeeded to the throne in preference to the sons of his brother the previous king, who were underage at the time. In the reign of Edward the Confessor, Edgar the Ætheling received the appellation as the grandson of Edmund Ironside, but that was at a time when for the first time in 250 years there was no living ætheling according to the strict definition. William the Conqueror's son King Henry I of England died in 1135 after William Adelin (William Ætheling), his only male heir, was killed aboard the White Ship. Following the White Ship disaster, England entered a period of prolonged instability known as The Anarchy. However, following the ascension of Henry of Anjou to the throne in 1154 as Henry II, the crown passed from father to son or brother to brother with little difficulty until 1399. Henry IV The question of succession after Edward III's death in 1377 is said to be the cause of the Wars of the Roses. He had four surviving legitimate sons: Lionel, Duke of Clarence (called 'Lionel of Antwerp' 1338–1368); John, Duke of Lancaster (called 'John of Gaunt'; 1340–1399); Edmund, Duke of York (called 'Edmund of Langley' 1341–1402); and Thomas, Duke of Gloucester (1355–1397). Although Edward III's succession seemed secure, there was a \\"sudden narrowing in the direct line of descent\\" near the end of his reign. His eldest son Edward, the Black Prince, had died the year before. Edward III was succeeded on the throne by the Black Prince's only surviving son Richard II, who was only 10 years old. Richard's claim to the throne was based on the principle that the son of an elder brother had priority in the succession over his uncles. Since Richard was a minor, had no siblings, and had three living uncles at the time of Edward III's death, there was considerable uncertainty about who was next in line for the succession after Richard. If Richard II died without legitimate offspring, his successors by primogeniture would be the descendants of Lionel of Antwerp, Edward III's second son. Clarence's only daughter, Philippa, 5th Countess of Ulster, married into the Mortimer family and had a son, Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March (1374–1398), who technically had the best claim to succeed. However, a legal decree issued by Edward III in 1376 introduced some complexity into the question of who would ultimately take the throne. The letters patent he issued limited the right of succession to male heirs, which placed his third son, John of Gaunt, ahead of Clarence's descendants because the Mortimer line of descent passed through a daughter. Richard II's reign was marked by increasing dissension between the King and several of the most powerful nobles. Richard's government had become highly unpopular beyond his strongholds in Cheshire and Wales. Throughout his reign, Richard had repeatedly switched his choice of the heir to keep his political enemies at bay and perhaps to reduce the chances of deposition. Nevertheless, when Henry Bolingbroke (son of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster) returned from exile in 1399, initially to reclaim his rights as Duke of Lancaster, he took advantage of the support of most of the nobles to depose Richard and was crowned King Henry IV, establishing the House of Lancaster on the throne. House of Lancaster Henry V The House of Lancaster descended from John of Gaunt, the third surviving son of Edward III of England. Their name derives from John of Gaunt's primary title of Duke of Lancaster, which he held by right of his spouse, Blanche of Lancaster. They had received explicit preference from Edward III in the line of succession because they formed the most senior unbroken male line of descent from him. Henry IV's claim to the throne was through his father, John of Gaunt. At the onset of Richard II's reign, Gaunt was the official heir presumptive, but due to the intrigues of his turbulent rule, the succession was unclear by the time of his deposition. Therefore, an argument could be made that the legitimate king of England was not Henry IV, but instead was Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March, the son of Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March. However, there was little support at the time for his counter-claim. Certainly, many people believed it to be the case. As Henry's initial popularity waned, the Mortimer family's claim to the throne was a pretext for the major rebellion of Owain Glyndŵr in Wales, and other, less successful, revolts in Cheshire and Northumberland. There were uprisings in support of the Mortimers' claim throughout Henry IV's reign, which lasted until 1413. A peculiarity of Henry IV's seizure of the throne is demonstrated in the way he announced his claim. He was vague, and he resigned himself to mentioning that he was the rightful heir of Henry III, who had died more than a century before, perhaps subtly implying that all English kings ever since (Edward I, Edward II, Edward III and Richard II) had not been rightful monarchs. Henry IV seems to have been exploiting a legend that Henry III's second son Edmund \\"Crouchback\\", 1st Earl of Lancaster, was his eldest son but had been removed from the succession because he had a physical deformity, which gave origin to his nickname. Since Henry IV was Edmund's descendant and heir through his mother Blanche of Lancaster, he was the rightful king. There is no evidence for this legend, and Edmund's nickname did not stem from a deformity. An important branch of the House of Lancaster was the House of Beaufort, whose members were descended from Gaunt by his mistress, Katherine Swynford. Originally illegitimate, they were made legitimate by an Act of Parliament when Gaunt and Katherine later married. However, Henry IV excluded them from the line of succession to the throne. Henry IV's son and successor, Henry V, inherited a temporarily pacified nation, and his military success against France in the Hundred Years' War bolstered his popularity, enabling him to strengthen the Lancastrian hold on the throne. Nevertheless, one notable conspiracy against Henry, the Southampton Plot, took place during his nine-year reign. This was led by Richard, Earl of Cambridge, who attempted to place Edmund Mortimer, his brother-in-law, on the throne. Cambridge was executed for treason in 1415, at the start of the campaign that led to the Battle of Agincourt. House of York The founder of the House of York was Edmund of Langley, the fourth son of Edward III and the younger brother of John of Gaunt. Their family name comes from Edmund's title Duke of York, which he acquired in 1385. However, the superiority of their claim is not based on the male line, but on the female line, as descendants of Edward III's second son Lionel of Antwerp. Edmund's second son, Richard, Earl of Cambridge, who was executed by Henry V, had married Anne de Mortimer, daughter of Roger Mortimer and sister of Edmund Mortimer. Anne's grandmother, Philippa of Clarence, was the daughter of Lionel of Antwerp. The Mortimers were the most powerful marcher family of the fourteenth century. G.M. Trevelyan has written that \\"the Wars of the Roses were to a large extent a quarrel between Welsh Marcher Lords, who were also great English nobles, closely related to the English throne.\\" Anne Mortimer's husband Richard, Earl of Cambridge Anne de Mortimer had died in 1411. When her brother Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March, who had loyally supported Henry, died childless in 1425, the title and extensive estates of the Earldom of March and the Mortimer claim to the throne thus passed to Anne's descendants. Richard of York, the son of Cambridge and Anne Mortimer, was four years old at the time of his father's execution. Although Cambridge was attainted, Henry V later allowed Richard to inherit the title and lands of Cambridge's elder brother Edward, Duke of York, who had died fighting alongside Henry at Agincourt and had no issue. Henry, who had three younger brothers and was himself in his prime and recently married to the French princess, Catherine of Valois, did not doubt that the Lancastrian right to the crown was secure. Henry's premature death in 1422, at the age of 36, led to his only son Henry VI coming to the throne as an infant and the country being ruled by a divided council of regency. Henry V's younger brothers produced no surviving legitimate issue, leaving only distant cousins (the Beauforts) as alternative Lancaster heirs. As Richard of York grew into maturity and questions were raised over Henry VI's fitness to rule, Richard's claim to the throne thus became more significant. The revenue from the York and March estates also made him the wealthiest magnate in the land. =Henry VI= From early childhood, Henry VI was surrounded by quarrelsome councillors and advisors. His younger surviving paternal uncle, Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, sought to be named Lord Protector and deliberately courted the popularity of the common people for his own ends but was opposed by his half- uncle Cardinal Henry Beaufort. On several occasions, Beaufort called on John, Duke of Bedford, Humphrey's older brother, to return from his post as Henry VI's regent in France, either to mediate or to defend him against Humphrey's accusations of treason. Henry VI's coming of age in 1437 brought no end to the noblemen's scheming, as his weak personality made him prone to being swayed and influenced by select courtiers, especially those whom he deemed his favourites. Sometime after, Cardinal Beaufort withdrew from public affairs, partly due to old age and partly because William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk, rose to become the dominant personality at court. Suffolk and the Beauforts were widely held to be enriching themselves through their influence on Henry and were blamed for mismanaging the government and poorly executing the continuing Hundred Years' War with France. Under Henry VI, all the land in France won by Henry V and even the provinces of Guienne and Gascony, which had been held since the reign of Henry II three centuries previously, were lost. Opposition to Suffolk and Beaufort was led by Humphrey of Gloucester, and Richard of York. Humphrey felt that the lifetime efforts of his brothers, of himself, and many Englishmen in the war against France were being wasted as the French territories slipped from English hands, especially since Suffolk and his supporters were trying to make large diplomatic and territorial concessions to the French in a desperate attempt for peace. In this, Gloucester enjoyed little influence, as Henry VI tended to favour Suffolk and Beaufort's faction at court due to its less hawkish and more conciliatory inclinations. The Duke of York, Bedford's successor in France, and at times also described as a skeptic of the peace policy, became entangled in this dispute as Suffolk and the Beauforts were frequently granted large money and land grants from the king, as well as important government and military positions, redirecting much needed resources away from York's campaigns in France. Henry VI Suffolk eventually succeeded in having Humphrey of Gloucester arrested for treason. Humphrey died while awaiting trial in prison at Bury St Edmunds in 1447. Some authorities date the start of the War of the Roses from the death of Humphrey. At the same time, Richard of York was stripped of the prestigious military command in France and sent to govern the relatively distant Ireland, whereby he could not interfere in the proceedings of the court. However, with severe reverses in France, Suffolk was stripped of office and was murdered on his way to exile. Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset (Cardinal Beaufort's nephew), succeeded him as leader of the party seeking peace with France. The Duke of York meanwhile represented those who wished to prosecute the war more vigorously, and criticised the court, and Somerset in particular, for starving him of funds and men during his campaigns in France. In all these quarrels, Henry VI had taken little part. He was seen as a weak, ineffectual king. Also, he displayed several symptoms of mental illness that he may have inherited from his maternal grandfather, Charles VI of France. By 1450 many considered Henry incapable of carrying out the duties and responsibilities of a king. In 1450, there was a violent popular revolt in Kent, Jack Cade's Rebellion, which is often seen as the prelude to the Wars of the Roses. The rebel manifesto, The Complaint of the Poor Commons of Kent written under Cade's leadership, accused the crown of extortion, perversion of justice, and election fraud. The rebels occupied parts of London, and executed James Fiennes, 1st Baron Saye and Sele, the unpopular Lord High Treasurer, after a hasty trial. After some of them fell to looting, they were driven out of London by the citizens. They dispersed after they were supposedly pardoned but several, including Cade, were later executed. After the rebellion, the rebels' grievances formed the basis of Richard of York's opposition to a royal government from which he felt excluded. Two years later, in 1452, Richard of York returned to England from his new post as Lieutenant of Ireland and marched on London, demanding Somerset's removal and reform of the government. At this stage, few of the nobles supported such drastic action, and York was forced to submit to superior force at Blackheath. He was imprisoned for much of 1452 and 1453 but was released after swearing not to take arms against the court. The increasing discord at court was mirrored in the country as a whole, where noble families engaged in private feuds and showed increasing disrespect for the royal authority and the courts of law. In many cases, feuds were fought between old-established families, and formerly minor nobility raised in power and influence by Henry IV in the aftermath of the rebellions against him. The quarrel between the Percys—long the Earls of Northumberland—and the comparatively upstart Nevilles was the best-known of these private wars and followed this pattern, as did the Bonville–Courtenay feud in Cornwall and Devon. A factor in these feuds was the presence of large numbers of soldiers discharged from the English armies that had been defeated in France. Nobles engaged many of these to mount raids, or to pack courts of justice with their supporters, intimidating suitors, witnesses, and judges. This growing civil discontent, the abundance of feuding nobles with private armies, and corruption in Henry VI's court formed a political climate ripe for civil war. With the king so easily manipulated, power rested with those closest to him at court, in other words, Somerset and the Lancastrian faction. Richard and the Yorkist faction, who tended to be physically placed further away from the seat of power, found their power slowly being stripped away. Royal power and finances also started to slip, as Henry was persuaded to grant many royal lands and estates to the Lancastrians, thereby losing their revenue. In 1453, Henry suffered the first of several bouts of complete mental collapse, during which he failed even to recognise his new-born son, Edward of Westminster. On 22 March 1454, Cardinal John Kemp, the Chancellor, died. Henry was incapable of nominating a successor. To ensure that the country could be governed, a Council of Regency was set up, headed by the Duke of York, who remained popular with the people, as Lord Protector. York soon asserted his power with ever-greater boldness (although there is no proof that he had aspirations to the throne at this early stage). He imprisoned Somerset and backed his Neville allies (his brother-in-law, the Earl of Salisbury, and Salisbury's son, the Earl of Warwick), in their continuing feud with the Earl of Northumberland, a powerful supporter of Henry. Henry recovered in 1455 and once again fell under the influence of those closest to him at court. Directed by Henry's queen, the powerful and aggressive Margaret of Anjou, who emerged as the de facto leader of the Lancastrians, Richard was forced out of court. Margaret built up an alliance against Richard and conspired with other nobles to reduce his influence. An increasingly thwarted Richard (who feared arrest for treason) finally resorted to armed hostilities in 1455. Early stages =Start of the war= Richard, Duke of York, led a small force toward London and was met by Henry's forces at St Albans, north of London, on 22 May 1455. The relatively small First Battle of St Albans was the first open conflict of the civil war. Richard's aim was ostensibly to remove \\"poor advisors\\" from King Henry's side. The result was a Lancastrian defeat. Several prominent Lancastrian leaders, including Somerset and Northumberland, were killed. After the battle, the Yorkists found Henry hiding in a local tanner's shop, abandoned by his advisers and servants, apparently having suffered another bout of mental illness. (He had also been slightly wounded in the neck by an arrow.) York and his allies regained their position of influence. With the king indisposed, York was again appointed Protector, and Margaret was shunted aside, charged with the king's care. For a while, both sides seemed shocked that an actual battle had been fought and did their best to reconcile their differences, but the problems that caused conflict soon re-emerged, particularly the issue of whether the Duke of York or Henry and Margaret's infant son, Edward, would succeed to the throne. Margaret refused to accept any solution that would disinherit her son, and it became clear that she would only tolerate the situation for as long as the Duke of York and his allies retained the military ascendancy. Henry recovered and in February 1456 he relieved York of his office of Protector. In the autumn of that year, Henry went on royal progress in the Midlands, where the king and queen were popular. Margaret did not allow him to return to London where the merchants were angry at the decline in trade and the widespread disorder. The king's court was set up at Coventry. By then, the new Duke of Somerset was emerging as a favourite of the royal court. Margaret persuaded Henry to revoke the appointments York had made as Protector, while York was made to return to his post as a lieutenant in Ireland. Disorder in the capital and the north of England (where fighting between the Nevilles and Percys had resumed ) and piracy by French fleets on the south coast was growing, but the king and queen remained intent on protecting their positions, with the queen introducing conscription for the first time in England. Meanwhile, York's ally, Warwick (later dubbed \\"The Kingmaker\\"), was growing in popularity in London as the champion of the merchants; as Captain of Calais he had fought piracy in the Channel.Pollard, A.J. (2007). Warwick the Kingmaker, London, pp. 177–178 In the spring of 1458, Thomas Bourchier, the Archbishop of Canterbury, attempted to arrange a reconciliation. The lords had gathered in London for a Grand Council and the city was full of armed retainers. The Archbishop negotiated complex settlements to resolve the blood-feuds that had persisted since the Battle of St. Albans. Then, on Lady Day (25 March), the King led a \\"love day\\" procession to St. Paul's Cathedral, with Lancastrian and Yorkist nobles following him, hand in hand. No sooner had the procession and the Council dispersed than plotting resumed. =Act of Accord= Ludlow Castle, South Shropshire The next outbreak of fighting was prompted by Warwick's high-handed actions as Captain of Calais. He led his ships in attacks on neutral Hanseatic League and Spanish ships in the Channel on flimsy grounds of sovereignty. He was summoned to London to face inquiries, but he claimed that attempts had been made on his life, and returned to Calais. York, Salisbury, and Warwick were summoned to a royal council at Coventry, but they refused, fearing arrest when they were isolated from their supporters. York summoned the Nevilles to join him at his stronghold at Ludlow Castle in the Welsh Marches. On 23 September 1459, at the Battle of Blore Heath in Staffordshire, a Lancastrian army failed to prevent Salisbury from marching from Middleham Castle in Yorkshire to Ludlow. Shortly afterward the combined Yorkist armies confronted the much larger Lancastrian force at the Battle of Ludford Bridge. Warwick's contingent from the garrison of Calais under Andrew Trollope defected to the Lancastrians, and the Yorkist leaders fled. York returned to Ireland, and his eldest son, Edward, Earl of March, Salisbury and Warwick fled to Calais. The Lancastrians were back in total control. York and his supporters were attainted at the Parliament of Devils as traitors. Somerset was appointed Governor of Calais and was dispatched to take over the vital fortress on the French coast, but his attempts to evict Warwick were easily repulsed. Warwick and his supporters even began to launch raids on the English coast from Calais, adding to the sense of chaos and disorder. Being attainted, only by a successful invasion could the Yorkists recover their lands and titles. Warwick travelled to Ireland under the protection of Gaillard IV de Durfort, Lord of Duras, to concert plans with York, evading the royal ships commanded by the Duke of Exeter. In late June 1460, Warwick, Salisbury, and Edward of March crossed the Channel and rapidly established themselves in Kent and London, where they enjoyed wide support. Backed by a papal emissary who had taken their side, they marched north. King Henry led an army south to meet them while Margaret remained in the north with Prince Edward. At the Battle of Northampton on 10 July, the Yorkist army under Warwick defeated the Lancastrians, aided by treachery in the king's ranks. For the second time in the war, King Henry was found by the Yorkists in a tent, abandoned by his retinue, having suffered another breakdown. With the king in their possession, the Yorkists returned to London. In the light of this military success, Richard of York moved to press his claim to the throne based on the illegitimacy of the Lancastrian line. Landing in the north Wales, he and his wife Cecily entered London with all the ceremony usually reserved for a monarch. Parliament was assembled, and when York entered he made straight for the throne, which he may have been expecting the Lords to encourage him to take for himself as they had acclaimed Henry IV in 1399. Instead, there was stunned silence. York announced his claim to the throne, but the Lords, even Warwick, and Salisbury, were shocked by his presumption; they had no desire at this stage to overthrow King Henry. Their ambition was still limited to the removal of his councillors. The next day, York produced detailed genealogies to support his claim based on his descent from Lionel of Antwerp, Duke of Clarence. York's claim was through the daughter of a second son, Henry's through the son of a third son. The judges felt that Common law principles could not determine who had priority in the royal succession, and declared the matter \\"above the law and passed their learning.\\" Parliament agreed to consider the matter and accepted that York's claim was better, but by a majority of five, they voted that Henry VI should remain as king. A compromise was struck in October 1460 with the Act of Accord, which recognised York as Henry's successor, disinheriting Henry's six- year-old son, Edward. York accepted this compromise as the best offer. It gave him much of what he wanted, particularly since he was also made Protector of the Realm and was able to govern in Henry's name. =Death of Richard, Duke of York= Ruins of Sandal Castle, near Wakefield, West Yorkshire Queen Margaret and her son had fled to the north of Wales, parts of which were still in Lancastrian hands. They later travelled by sea to Scotland to negotiate for Scottish assistance. Mary of Gueldres, Queen Consort to James II of Scotland, agreed to give Margaret an army on condition that she cede the town of Berwick to Scotland and Mary's daughter be betrothed to Prince Edward. Margaret agreed, although she had no funds to pay her army and could only promise booty from the riches of southern England, as long as no looting took place north of the River Trent. The Duke of York left London later that year with the Earl of Salisbury to consolidate his position in the north against the Lancastrians who were reported to be massing near the city of York. He took up a defensive position at Sandal Castle near Wakefield over Christmas 1460. Then on 30 December, his forces left the castle and attacked the Lancastrians in the open, although outnumbered. The ensuing Battle of Wakefield was a complete Lancastrian victory. Richard of York was slain in the battle, and both Salisbury and York's 17-year-old second son, Edmund, Earl of Rutland, were captured and executed. Margaret ordered the heads of all three placed on the gates of York. Middle stages =Edward's claim to the throne= Parhelion at sunset The Act of Accord and the events of Wakefield left the 18-year-old Edward, Earl of March, York's eldest son, as Duke of York and heir to his claim to the throne. With an army from the pro-Yorkist Marches (the border area between England and Wales), he met Jasper Tudor's Lancastrian army arriving from Wales, and he defeated them soundly at the Battle of Mortimer's Cross in Herefordshire. He inspired his men with a \\"vision\\" of three suns at dawn (a phenomenon known as \\"parhelion\\"), telling them that it was a portent of victory and represented the three surviving York sons; himself, George and Richard. This led to Edward's later adoption of the sign of the sunne in splendour as his personal device. Margaret's army was moving south, supporting itself by looting as it passed through the prosperous south of England. In London, Warwick used this as propaganda to reinforce Yorkist support throughout the south – the town of Coventry switched allegiance to the Yorkists. Warwick's army established fortified positions north of the town of St Albans to block the main road from the north but was outmanoeuvred by Margaret's army, which swerved to the west and then attacked Warwick's positions from behind. At the Second Battle of St Albans, the Lancastrians won another big victory. As the Yorkist forces fled they left behind King Henry, who was found unharmed, sitting quietly beneath a tree. Henry knighted thirty Lancastrian soldiers immediately after the battle. In an illustration of the increasing bitterness of the war, Queen Margaret instructed her seven-year-old son Edward of Westminster to determine the manner of execution of the Yorkist knights who had been charged with keeping Henry safe and had stayed at his side throughout the battle. As the Lancastrian army advanced southwards, a wave of dread swept London, where rumours were rife about savage northerners intent on plundering the city. The people of London shut the city gates and refused to supply food to the queen's army, which was looting the surrounding counties of Hertfordshire and Middlesex. =Yorkist triumph= Edward IV Edward of March, having joined with Warwick's surviving forces, advanced towards London from the west at the same time that the queen retreated northwards to Dunstable; as a result, Edward and Warwick were able to enter London with their army. They found considerable support there, as the city was largely Yorkist-supporting. It was clear that Edward was no longer simply trying to free the king from bad councillors, but that his goal was to take the crown. Thomas Kempe, the Bishop of London, asked the people of London their opinion and they replied with shouts of \\"King Edward\\". The request was quickly approved by Parliament, and Edward was unofficially appointed king in an impromptu ceremony at Westminster Abbey; Edward vowed that he would not have a formal coronation until Henry VI and his wife were removed from the scene. Edward claimed Henry had forfeited his right to the crown by allowing his queen to take up arms against his rightful heirs under the Act of Accord. Parliament had already accepted that Edward's victory was simply a restoration of the rightful heir to the throne. Edward and Warwick marched north, gathering a large army as they went, and met an equally impressive Lancastrian army at Towton. The Battle of Towton, near York, was the biggest battle of the Wars of the Roses. Both sides agreed beforehand that the issue would be settled that day, with no quarter asked or given. An estimated 40,000–80,000 men took part, with over 20,000 men being killed during (and after) the battle, an enormous number for the time and the greatest recorded single day's loss of life on English soil. Edward and his army won a decisive victory, and the Lancastrians were routed, with most of their leaders slain. Henry and Margaret, who were waiting in York with their son Edward, fled north when they heard the outcome. Many of the surviving Lancastrian nobles switched allegiance to King Edward, and those who did not were driven back to the northern border areas and a few castles in Wales. Edward advanced to take York, where he replaced the rotting heads of his father, his brother, and Salisbury with those of defeated Lancastrian lords such as the notorious John Clifford, 9th Baron de Clifford of Skipton-Craven, who was blamed for the execution of Edward's brother Edmund, Earl of Rutland, after the Battle of Wakefield. =Edward IV= Harlech Castle, Gwynedd, Wales The official coronation of Edward IV took place on June 1461 in London, where he received a rapturous welcome from his supporters. After the Battle of Towton, Henry VI and Margaret had fled to Scotland, where they stayed with the court of James III and followed through on their promise to cede Berwick to Scotland. Later in the year, they mounted an attack on Carlisle, but, lacking money, they were easily repulsed by Edward's men, who were rooting out the remaining Lancastrian forces in the northern counties. Several castles under Lancastrian commanders held out for years: Dunstanburgh, Alnwick (the Percy family seat), and Bamburgh were some of the last to fall. There was also some fighting in Ireland. At the Battle of Piltown in 1462, the Yorkish supporter Thomas FitzGerald, 7th Earl of Desmond, defeated the Lancastrian Butlers of Kilkenny. The Butlers suffered more than 400 casualties. Local folklore claims that the battle was so violent that the local river ran red with blood, hence the names Pill River and Piltown (Baile an Phuill, meaning \\"Town of the blood\\"). There were Lancastrian revolts in the north of England in 1464. Several Lancastrian nobles, including the third Duke of Somerset, who had been reconciled to Edward, readily led the rebellion. The revolt was put down by Warwick's brother, John Neville. A small Lancastrian army was destroyed at the Battle of Hedgeley Moor on 25 April, but because Neville was escorting Scottish commissioners for a treaty to York, he could not immediately follow up this victory. Then on 15 May, he routed Somerset's army at the Battle of Hexham. Somerset was captured and executed. The deposed King Henry was later captured for the third time at Clitheroe in Lancashire in 1465. He was taken to London and held prisoner at the Tower of London, where, for the time being, he was reasonably well treated. About the same time, once England under Edward IV and Scotland had come to terms, Margaret and her son were forced to leave Scotland and sail to France, where they maintained an impoverished court in exile for several years. The last remaining Lancastrian stronghold was Harlech Castle in Wales, which surrendered in 1468 after a seven-year-long siege. =Warwick's rebellion and the death of Henry VI= Middleham Castle The powerful Earl of Warwick (\\"the Kingmaker\\") had meanwhile become the greatest landowner in England. Already a great magnate through his wife's property, he had also inherited his father's estates and had been granted much forfeited Lancastrian property. He also held many of the offices of state. He was convinced of the need for an alliance with France and had been negotiating a match between Edward and a French bride. However, Edward had married Elizabeth Woodville, the widow of a Lancastrian knight, in secret in 1464. He later announced the news of his marriage as fait accompli, to Warwick's considerable embarrassment. This embarrassment turned to bitterness when the Woodvilles came to be favoured over the Nevilles at court. Many of Queen Elizabeth's relatives were married into noble families and others were granted peerages or royal offices. Other factors compounded Warwick's disillusionment: Edward's preference for an alliance with Burgundy rather than France and reluctance to allow his brothers George, Duke of Clarence and Richard, Duke of Gloucester, to marry Warwick's daughters Isabel and Anne. Furthermore, Edward's general popularity was on the wane in this period with higher taxes and persistent disruptions of law and order. Louis XI of France By 1469, Warwick had allied with Edward's jealous and treacherous brother George, who married Isabel Neville in defiance of Edward's wishes in Calais. They raised an army that defeated the king's forces at the Battle of Edgecote Moor. Edward was captured at Olney, Buckinghamshire, and imprisoned at Middleham Castle in Yorkshire. (Warwick briefly had two Kings of England in his custody.) Warwick had the queen's father, Richard Woodville, 1st Earl Rivers, and her brother John executed. However, he made no immediate move to have Edward declared illegitimate and place George on the throne. The country was in turmoil, with nobles once again settling scores with private armies (in episodes such as the Battle of Nibley Green), and Lancastrians being encouraged to rebel. Few of the nobles were prepared to support Warwick's seizure of power. Edward was escorted to London by Warwick's brother George Neville, the Archbishop of York, where he and Warwick were reconciled, to outward appearances. When further rebellions broke out in Lincolnshire, Edward easily suppressed them at the Battle of Losecoat Field. From the testimony of the captured leaders, he declared that Warwick and George, Duke of Clarence, had instigated them. They were declared traitors and forced to flee to France, where Margaret of Anjou was already in exile. Louis XI of France, who wished to forestall a hostile alliance between Edward and Edward's brother-in-law Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, suggested the idea of an alliance between Warwick and Margaret. Neither of those two formerly mortal enemies entertained the notion at first, but eventually, they were brought round to realise the potential benefits. However, both were undoubtedly hoping for different outcomes: Warwick for a puppet king in the form of Henry VI or his young son; Margaret to be able to reclaim her family's realm. In any case, a marriage was arranged between Warwick's daughter Anne and Margaret's son Edward of Westminster, and Warwick invaded England in the autumn of 1470. Battle of Tewkesbury Edward IV had already marched north to suppress another uprising in Yorkshire. Warwick, with help from a fleet under his nephew, the Bastard of Fauconberg, landed at Dartmouth and rapidly secured support from the southern counties and ports. He occupied London in October and paraded Henry VI through the streets as the restored king. Warwick's brother John Neville, who had recently received the empty title Marquess of Montagu and who led large armies in the Scottish marches, suddenly defected to Warwick. Edward was unprepared for this event and had to order his army to scatter. He and Richard, Duke of Gloucester, fled from Doncaster to the coast and thence to Holland and exile in Burgundy. They were proclaimed traitors, and many exiled Lancastrians returned to reclaim their estates. The Lancastrian siege of London in 1471 is attacked by a Yorkist sally. Warwick's success was short-lived, however. He over-reached himself with his plan to invade Burgundy in alliance with the King of France, tempted by King Louis' promise of territory in the Netherlands as a reward. This led Edward's brother-in-law, Charles of Burgundy, to provide funds and troops to Edward to enable him to launch an invasion of England in 1471. Edward landed with a small force at Ravenspur on the Yorkshire coast. Initially claiming to support Henry and to be seeking only to have his title of Duke of York restored, he soon gained the city of York and rallied several supporters. His brother George turned traitor again, abandoning Warwick. Having outmaneuvered Warwick and Montagu, Edward captured London. His army then met Warwick's at the Battle of Barnet. The battle was fought in thick fog, and some of Warwick's men attacked each other by mistake. It was believed by all that they had been betrayed, and Warwick's army fled. Warwick was cut down trying to reach his horse. Montagu was also killed in the battle. Margaret and her son Edward had landed in the West Country only a few days before the Battle of Barnet. Rather than return to France, Margaret sought to join the Lancastrian supporters in Wales and marched to cross the Severn but was thwarted when the city of Gloucester refused her passage across the river. Her army, commanded by the fourth successive Duke of Somerset, was brought to battle and destroyed at the Battle of Tewkesbury. Her son Prince Edward, the Lancastrian heir to the throne, was killed. With no heirs to succeed him, Henry VI was murdered shortly afterward, on 21 May 1471, to strengthen the Yorkist hold on the throne. Later stages =Richard III= Richard III The restoration of Edward IV in 1471 is sometimes seen as marking the end of the Wars of the Roses proper. Peace was restored for the remainder of Edward's reign. His youngest brother, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, and Edward's lifelong companion and supporter, William Hastings, were generously rewarded for their loyalty, becoming effectively governors of the north and midlands respectively. George of Clarence became increasingly estranged from Edward and was executed in 1478 for association with convicted traitors. When Edward died suddenly in 1483, political and dynastic turmoil erupted again. Many of the nobles still resented the influence of the queen's Woodville relatives (her brother, Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers and her son by her first marriage, Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset), and regarded them as power-hungry upstarts (parvenus). At the time of Edward's premature death, his heir, Edward V, was only 12 years old and had been brought up under the stewardship of Earl Rivers at Ludlow Castle. On his deathbed, Edward had named his surviving brother Richard of Gloucester as Protector of England. Richard had been in the north when Edward died. Hastings, who also held the office of Lord Chamberlain, sent word to him to bring a strong force to London to counter any force the Woodvilles might muster. The Duke of Buckingham also declared his support for Richard. Richard and Buckingham overtook Earl Rivers, who was escorting the young Edward V to London, at Stony Stratford in Buckinghamshire on 29 April. Although they dined with Rivers amicably, they took him prisoner the next day and declared to Edward that they had done so to forestall a conspiracy by the Woodvilles against his life. Rivers and his nephew Richard Grey were sent to Pontefract Castle in Yorkshire and executed there at the end of June. Princes in the Tower, painted by John Everett Millais Edward entered London in the custody of Richard on 4 May and was lodged in the Tower of London. Elizabeth Woodville had already gone hastily into the sanctuary at Westminster with her remaining children, although preparations were being made for Edward V to be crowned on 22 June, at which point Richard's authority as Protector would end. On 13 June, Richard held a full meeting of the Council, at which he accused Hastings and others of conspiracy against him. Hastings was executed without trial later in the day. Thomas Bourchier, the Archbishop of Canterbury, then persuaded Elizabeth Woodville to allow her younger son, the 9-year-old Richard, Duke of York, to join Edward in the Tower. Having secured the boys, Robert Stillington, Bishop of Bath and Wells then alleged that Edward IV's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville had been illegal and that the two boys were therefore illegitimate. Richard then claimed the crown as King Richard III. The two imprisoned boys, known as the \\"Princes in the Tower\\", disappeared and are assumed to have been murdered. There was never a trial or judicial inquest on the matter. Perkin Warbeck claimed he was the younger of the Princes from 1490 and was recognised as such by Richard's sister, the Duchess of Burgundy. Having been crowned in a lavish ceremony on 6 July, Richard then proceeded on a tour of the Midlands and the north of England, dispensing generous bounties and charters and naming his son as the Prince of Wales. =Buckingham's revolt= Opposition to Richard's rule had already begun in the south when, on 18 October, the Duke of Buckingham (who had been instrumental in placing Richard on the throne and who himself had a distant claim to the crown) led a revolt aimed at installing the Lancastrian Henry Tudor. It has been argued that his supporting Tudor rather than either Edward V or his younger brother, showed Buckingham was aware that both were already dead. The Lancastrian claim to the throne had descended to Henry Tudor on the death of Henry VI and his son in 1471. Henry's father, Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond, had been a half-brother of Henry VI, but Henry's claim to royalty was through his mother, Margaret Beaufort. She was descended from John Beaufort, who was a son of John of Gaunt and thus a grandson of Edward III. John Beaufort had been illegitimate at birth, though later legitimised by the marriage of his parents. It had supposedly been a condition of the legitimation that the Beaufort descendants forfeited their rights to the crown. Henry had spent much of his childhood under siege in Harlech Castle or exile in Brittany. After 1471, Edward IV had preferred to belittle Henry's pretensions to the crown and made only sporadic attempts to secure him. However, his mother, Margaret Beaufort, had been twice remarried, first to Buckingham's uncle, and then to Thomas, Lord Stanley, one of Edward's principal officers, and continually promoted her son's rights. Buckingham's rebellion failed. Some of his supporters in the south rose up prematurely, thus allowing Richard's Lieutenant in the South, the Duke of Norfolk, to prevent many rebels from joining forces. Buckingham himself raised a force at Brecon in mid-Wales. He was prevented from crossing the River Severn to join other rebels in the south of England by storms and floods, which also prevented Henry Tudor landing in the West Country. Buckingham's starving forces deserted and he was betrayed and executed. The failure of Buckingham's revolt was clearly not the end of the plots against Richard, who could never again feel secure, and who also suffered the loss of his wife and eleven-year- old son, putting the future of the Yorkist dynasty in doubt. =Henry VII= Henry VII Many of Buckingham's defeated supporters and other disaffected nobles fled to join Henry Tudor in exile. Richard made an attempt to bribe the Duke of Brittany's chief Minister Pierre Landais to betray Henry, but Henry was warned and escaped to France, where he was again given sanctuary and aid. Confident that many magnates and even many of Richard's officers would join him, Henry set sail from Harfleur on 1 August 1485, with a force of exiles and French mercenaries. With fair winds, he landed in Pembrokeshire six days later and the officers Richard had appointed in Wales either joined Henry or stood aside. Henry gathered supporters on his march through Wales and the Welsh Marches and defeated Richard at the Battle of Bosworth Field. Richard was slain during the battle, supposedly by the major Welsh landowner Rhys ap Thomas with a blow to the head from his poleaxe. Rhys was knighted three days later by Henry VII. Henry, having been acclaimed King Henry VII, strengthened his position by marrying Elizabeth of York, daughter of Edward IV and the second best surviving Yorkist claimant after George of Clarence's son the new duke of Warwick, reuniting the two royal houses. Henry merged the rival symbols of the red rose of Lancaster and the white rose of York into the new emblem of the red and white Tudor Rose. Henry later shored up his position by executing several other claimants, a policy his son Henry VIII continued. Many historians consider the accession of Henry VII to mark the end of the Wars of the Roses. Others argue that they continued to the end of the fifteenth century, as there were several plots to overthrow Henry and restore Yorkist claimants. Only two years after the Battle of Bosworth, Yorkists rebelled, led by John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln, who had been named by Richard III as his heir but had been reconciled with Henry after Bosworth. The conspirators produced a pretender, a boy named Lambert Simnel, who resembled the young Edward, Earl of Warwick (son of George of Clarence), the best surviving male claimant of the House of York. The imposture was shaky because the young earl was still alive and in King Henry's custody and was paraded through London to expose the impersonation. At the Battle of Stoke Field, Henry defeated Lincoln's army. Lincoln died in the battle. Simnel was pardoned for his part in the rebellion and was sent to work in the royal kitchens. Henry's throne was challenged again in 1491, with the appearance of the pretender Perkin Warbeck, who claimed he was Richard, Duke of York (the younger of the two Princes in the Tower). Warbeck made several attempts to incite revolts, with support at various times from the court of Burgundy and James IV of Scotland. He was captured after the failed Second Cornish uprising of 1497 and killed in 1499, after attempting to escape from prison. Warwick was also executed, rendering the male-line of the House of York (and by extension the whole Plantagenet dynasty excluding the legitimized Beauforts who were later renamed to the House of Somerset) extinct. During the reign of Henry VII's son Henry VIII, the possibility of a Yorkist challenge to the throne remained until as late as 1525, in the persons of Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham, Edmund de la Pole, 3rd Duke of Suffolk and his brother Richard de la Pole, all of whom had blood ties to the Yorkist dynasty but were excluded by the pro- Woodville Tudor settlement. To an extent, England's break with Rome was prompted by Henry's fears of a disputed succession, should he leave only a female heir to the throne or an infant who would be as vulnerable as Henry VI had been to antagonistic or rapacious regents. Aftermath Historians debate the extent of impact the wars had on medieval English life. The classical view is that the many casualties among the nobility continued the changes in feudal English society caused by the effects of the Black Death. These included a weakening of the feudal power of the nobles and an increase in the power of the merchant classes and the growth of a centralised monarchy under the Tudors. The wars heralded the end of the medieval period in England and the movement towards the Renaissance. After the wars, the large standing baronial armies that had helped fuel the conflict were suppressed. Henry VII, wary of any further fighting, kept the barons on a very tight leash, removing their right to raise, arm and supply armies of retainers so that they could not make war on each other or the king. The military power of individual barons declined, and the Tudor court became a place where baronial squabbles were decided with the influence of the monarch. Revisionists, such as the Oxford historian K. B. McFarlane, suggest that the effects of the conflicts have been greatly exaggerated and that there were no wars of the roses. Many places were unaffected by the wars, particularly in the eastern part of England, such as East Anglia. It has also been suggested that the traumatic impact of the wars was exaggerated by Henry VII, to magnify his achievement in quelling them and bringing peace. The effect of the wars on the merchant and labouring classes was far less than in the long-drawn-out wars of siege and pillage in Europe, which were carried out by mercenaries who profited from long wars. Although there were some lengthy sieges, such as those of Harlech Castle and Bamburgh Castle, these were in comparatively remote and less populous regions. In the populated areas, both factions had much to lose by the ruin of the country and sought a quick resolution of the conflict by pitched battle. Philippe de Commines observed in 1470: > The realm of England enjoys one favour above all other realms, that neither > the countryside nor the people are destroyed, nor are buildings burnt or > demolished. Misfortune falls on soldiers and nobles in particular... Exceptions to this claimed general rule were the Lancastrian looting of Ludlow after the largely bloodless Yorkist defeat at Ludford Bridge in 1459, and the widespread pillaging carried out by Queen Margaret's unpaid army as it advanced south in early 1461. Both events inspired widespread opposition to the Queen, and support for the Yorkists. Many areas did little or nothing to change their city defences, perhaps an indication that they were left untouched by the wars. City walls were either left in their ruinous state or only partially rebuilt. In the case of London, the city was able to avoid being devastated by convincing the York and Lancaster armies to stay out after the inability to recreate the defensive city walls. Few noble houses were extinguished during the wars; in the period from 1425 to 1449, before the outbreak of the wars, there were as many extinctions of noble lines from natural causes (25) as occurred during the fighting (24) from 1450 to 1474.Terence Wise and G.A. Embleton, The Wars of the Roses, Osprey Men-at-Arms series, p. 4, from K.B. MacFarlane, The Nobility of Later Medieval England, Oxford University Press The most ambitious nobles died and by the later period of the wars, fewer nobles were prepared to risk their lives and titles in an uncertain struggle. The kings of France and Scotland and the dukes of Burgundy played the two factions off against each other, pledging military and financial aid and offering asylum to defeated nobles and pretenders, to prevent a strong and unified England from being able to make war on them.

Following that event, Richard's legitimate successor would be Henry Bolingbroke if strict Salic inheritance were adhered to, or Anne Mortimer if male-preference primogeniture, which eventually became the standard form of succession (until the Succession to the Crown Act 2013), were adhered to. Armies and warfare Following defeat in the Hundred Years' War, English landowners complained vociferously about the financial losses resulting from the loss of their continental holdings; this is often considered a contributory cause of the Wars of the Roses.Webster, Bruce. Wars of the Roses. p. 40. Luminarium: Encyclopedia Project: \\"Every version of the complaints put forward by the rebels in 1450 harps on the losses in France.\\" The wars were fought largely by the landed aristocracy and armies of feudal retainers, with some mercenaries. At the end of the Hundred Years' War, large numbers of unemployed soldiery returned to England seeking employment in the growing armies of the local nobility. England drifted toward misrule and violence under the weak governance as local noble families like the Nevilles and Percys increasingly relied on their feudal retainers to settle disputes. It became common practice for landowners to bind their mesnie knights to their service with annual payments. Half of an indenture contract, the randomly cut (or indented) edge proves a match to the counterpart document Edward III had developed the contract system where the monarch entered into formal written contracts called indenture with experienced captains who were contractually obliged to provide an agreed-upon number of men, at established rates for a given period. Frequently the landed nobility acted the principal or main contractor. Knights, men at arms and archers were often sub-contracted. A lord could find men amongst his tenantry who included landless men and others who would crave the security of maintenance and livery. Skilled archers could command as high a wage as knights. As baronial armies grew in size, the rule of law was weakened. Support for each house largely depended upon dynastic factors, such as blood relationships, marriages within the nobility and the grants or confiscations of feudal titles and lands. Given the conflicting loyalties of blood, marriage, and ambition, it was not uncommon for nobles to switch sides; several battles (such as Northampton and Bosworth) were decided by treachery.. The armies consisted of nobles' contingents of men-at-arms, with companies of archers and foot-soldiers (such as billmen). There were sometimes contingents of foreign mercenaries, armed with cannon or handguns. The horsemen were generally restricted to \\"prickers\\" and \\"scourers\\"; i.e. scouting and foraging parties. Much like their campaigns in France, it was customary for the English gentry to fight entirely on foot. In several cases, noblemen dismounted and fought amongst the common foot-soldiers to both inspire them and due to the fact that, as proven by the experiences of battles on the continent, heavy cavalry is of limited tactical value when both sides possess large numbers of skilled Longbowmen. It was often claimed that the nobles faced greater risks than the ordinary soldiers as there was little incentive for anyone to take prisoner any high-ranking noble during or immediately after a battle. During the Hundred Years' War against France, a captured noble would be able to ransom himself for a large sum but in the Wars of the Roses, a captured noble who belonged to a defeated faction had a high chance of being executed as a traitor. Forty-two captured knights were executed after the Battle of Towton. The Burgundian observer Philippe de Commines, who met Edward IV in 1470, reported, > King Edward told me in all the battles which he had won, as soon as he had > gained a victory, he mounted his horse and shouted to his men that they must > spare the common soldiers and kill the lords, of whom none or few > escaped.Wise & Embleton, p.4 Even those who escaped execution might be declared attainted therefore possess no property and be of no value to a captor. =Chronological list of battles= * First Battle of St Albans (22 May 1455) * Battle of Blore Heath (23 September 1459) * Battle of Ludford Bridge (12 October 1459) * Battle of Sandwich (15 January 1460) * Battle of Northampton (10 July 1460) * Battle of Worksop (16 December 1460) * Battle of Wakefield (30 December 1460) * Battle of Mortimer's Cross (2 February 1461) * Second Battle of St Albans (17 February 1461) * Battle of Ferrybridge (28 March 1461) * Battle of Towton (29 March 1461) * Battle of Piltown (early 1462) * Battle of Hedgeley Moor (25 April 1464) * Battle of Hexham (15 May 1464) * Battle of Edgecote Moor (26 July 1469) * Battle of Losecoat Field (12 March 1470) * Battle of Barnet (14 April 1471) * Battle of Tewkesbury (4 May 1471) * Battle of Bosworth Field (22 August 1485) * Battle of Stoke Field (16 June 1487) See also *War of the League of Cambrai References =Bibliography=        Further reading  External links * The Wars of the Roses - Ancient History Encyclopedia * warsoftheroses.com includes a map, timeline, info on major players and summaries of each battle * Diagram of the Wars of the Roses * Reflections of the Yorkist Realm Includes photographs and discussion of places connected with the Wars of the Roses, including Bosworth, Harlech and Towton * \\"The Wars of the Roses\\", In Our Time, BBC Radio 4 discussion with Helen Castor, Colin Richmond and Steven Gunn (18 March 2000).

The route generally travels east to an intersection with , and then to the northeast before ending at a junction with US 290 near the town of Henly. RM 165 (in conjunction with Loop 163) provides a bypass of Johnson City and the US 281/290 junction for traffic traveling between Blanco and points east of Henly, such as Dripping Springs and Austin. History RM 165 was designated on June 11, 1945, connecting US 281 (and, after its realignment, Loop 163) to Middle Creek Road, approximately to the east. The designation was extended to the current eastern terminus of US 290 on November 21, 1956. The bridge structure crossing the Blanco River (which had replaced the original low-water crossing) was washed out in a catastrophic flooding event on May 23–24, 2015, with road closure at that location until further notice. The bridge deck and support beams were displaced from the piers and washed downstream; the piers and bents may require some repair after inspection for damage, and completion of a replacement deck structure is not anticipated by the Texas Department of Transportation before October, 2015.

He is remembered as the arranger of the Argentine National Anthem.Melanie Plesch, \\"Esnaola, Juan Pedro.\\" Diccionario de la Música Española e Hispanoamericana (Madrid: Sociedad General de Autores de España, 1999-2002), vol. 4, 760-762. Biography Esnaola was born in Buenos Aires to a Spanish-Basque father and a local-born mother of Basque background. He began musical training as a child, under his uncle, the priest José Antonio Picasarri (1769–1843), chapel master at the cathedral of Buenos Aires. As the region became independent from Spain in 1810, and Picasarri decided not to resign his Spanish citizenship, he was forced to leave the country (1818). He took along his nephew, who then was able to take piano and counterpoint lessons from European music teachers in Madrid and Paris (and perhaps also other cities). Esnaola wrote an unspecified number of piano pieces in Madrid (now lost).Guillermo Gallardo, Juan Pedro Esnaola: Una estirpe musical. Buenos Aires: Teoría, 1960. Picasarri and Esnaola could return to Buenos Aires on 29 June 1822 thanks to an amnesty law that Governor Martín Rodríguez issued on that year. They soon founded a \\"School of Music and Singing\\" supported by the provincial government, and participated in the performances of the local Philarmonic Society.Gallardo, Juan Pedro Esnaola. Esnaola must have completed his training as a composer with the Spanish violinist, singer, composer, and impresario Mariano Pablo Rosquellas in Buenos Aires over the following years, and, at 16, wrote a three-voice Mass in D major (1824) that summarized his knowledge of the art.Bernardo Illari, \\"Relevés d'apprenti: La formación profesional del compositor Esnaola.” Música e Investigación 17 (2009), 17-68. Starting around 1827, Esnaola began a career as a merchant and businessman, following in the footsteps of his father. During the 1830s and later, he developed an active social life. Even though he avoided party affiliations, the regime of Governor Juan Manuel de Rosas blacklisted and imprisoned him for a few weeks in 1840. He managed to weather the storm probably by composing anthems in praise of Rosas (1841-1843); yet there is no evidence that Esnaola ever belonged to the latter's party, nor he served any significant administrative positions. Esnaola did attend regularly the salon of Rosas's daughter, Manuelita, in Palermo, to whom he dedicated a string of songs and dances, and who may have interceded for his release.Bernardo Illari, “Esnaola contra Rosas.\\" Revista Argentina de Musicología 11 (2010), 33-73. After Rosas was overthrown and went into exile with his family (1852), Esnaola occupied several official positions, including the administration of the Serenos (night watchmen), the direction of the provincial mint, the presidency of the bourgeois Club del Progreso (1858), and that of the Bank of the Province of Buenos Aires (1866). During these years, Esnaola seldom appeared in public as a performer, yet he contributed administrative and overseeing work to concert societies and conservatories. He participated in the resurrection of the Philharmonic Society, for which he performed the piano again in 1855, and, later, held honorary posts in the La Lira music society and the Society of the Quartet. Esnaola furthermore presided over the supervising committee for the School of Music of the [Buenos Aires] Province, founded in 1874. In the meanwhile, he continued to amass a fortune both considerable and controversial, through mortgage loans and property rental. He died a single man, and bequeathed his millions to his sister's family.Gallardo, Juan Pedro Esnaola. Pianist Esnaola was universally recognized as an excellent piano performer. While a teenager, he often participated in concerts organized by the School of Music or the Philharmonic Society, in which he also sang opera excerpts. Yet he refused to carry on a professional career, and from the 1830s, he mainly appeared in private venues.Gallardo, Juan Pedro Esnaola. Works Esnaola cultivated most of the living genres in the Buenos Aires of his days, in a personal style based upon Mozart, Haydn, and Rossini, but that gradually incorporated Romantic influences. Even though he frowned away from folk songs and dances, his production is by no means a mere imitation of international trends, and carries a seal of its own. There is no evidence that he ever accepted a paid commission. He seems to have created music for free, as contributions to certain institutions or as gifts for friends and family members. In the mid-to-late 1820s and early 1830s, Esnaola regularly wrote church music, including his Mass in D, two more Masses (now lost), a Mass and Office for the Death, several hymns and motets, and a large-scale Miserere for voice and piano (1833), which earned him a well-deserved fame. His catalog also includes three lost symphonies.Carmen García Muñoz y Guillermo Stamponi, Juan Pedro Esnaola. Su obra musical. Catálogo analítico-temático (Buenos Aires: Ediciones de la Universidad Católica Argentina, 2002). He re- orchestrated for local performance several large-scale compositions that were available only in piano-vocal scores, including Rossini's opera Otello (1827)Illari, \\"Relevés d'apprenti.\\" and Haydn's oratorio The Creation (1845). Starting in 1833, Esnaola created salon songs and dances with increasing frequency. Around 1835-1836, he developed a self-conscious project for the creation of \\"national\\" song together with the poet and ideologue, Esteban Echeverría. If the collection never saw the public light, the experience had a noticeable impact upon Esnaola's subsequent productions in the genre. His later songs grew in length and artistic elaboration. By 1841, he had collected 48 of his songs in an unpublished autograph collection; about ten more survive in the music notebooks that belonged to Manuelita Rosas. His choice of poets includes Vicente López y Planes, Juan Cruz Varela, Luis Méndez, and the female poet and feminist Rosa Guerra.Bernardo Illari, “Ética, estética, nación: Las canciones de Juan Pedro Esnaola,” Cuadernos de Música Hispanoamericana 10 (2005), 137-223. Piano dances that often assume the intimate and elaborate qualities of instrumental miniatures were the main object of his attention during the 1840s, including minuets, waltzes, and polkas.Bernardo Illari, “Volverse romántico (estudio preliminar)”, en Juan Pedro Esnaola, Valses, Minuets, Contradanzas, Cuadrillas, edición facsimilar (La Plata, Argentina: Instituto Cultural de la Provincia de Buenos Aires, 2009). Esnaola regularly produced anthems for civil institution, including the School of Moral Sciences, the Society of Beneficence (both dated in 1827), and the Philharmonic Society (1856). Probably to placate Rosas's anger, he wrote four hymns in his praise (1841-1843), plus two festive songs in honor of Manuelita Rosas (1851).Illari, \\"Esnaola contra Rosas.\\" In spite of Esnaola's notable accomplishments as a pianist and composer, his name is more often remembered as the arranger of the Argentine National Anthem, composed by the Catalan Blas Parera in 1813. Esnaola first produced an unofficial two-voice arrangement around 1848. In 1860, he was commissioned a new version, which met with general approval in spite of the many novelties it incorporated. This arrangement, with a few modifications, was declared as the official anthem of the Argentine Republic and is still in use today.Carlos Vega, El Himno Nacional Argentino (Buenos Aires: Eudeba, 1962, among other editions).

Given the determinants of chemical bonding and the chemical properties of the atoms, topology provides a model for explaining how the atoms ethereal wave functions must fit together. Molecular topology is a part of mathematical chemistry dealing with the algebraic description of chemical compounds so allowing a unique and easy characterization of them. Topology is insensitive to the details of a scalar field, and can often be determined using simplified calculations. Scalar fields such as electron density, Madelung field, covalent field and the electrostatic potential can be used to model topology.Brown, David; Topology and Chemistry; Structural Chemistry Volume 13, Numbers 3–4, 339–355, Each scalar field has its own distinctive topology and each provides different information about the nature of chemical bonding and structure. The analysis of these topologies, when combined with simple electrostatic theory and a few empirical observations, leads to a quantitative model of localized chemical bonding. In the process, the analysis provides insights into the nature of chemical bonding. Applied topology explains how large molecules reach their final shapes and how biological molecules achieve their activity. Circuit topology is a topological property of folded linear polymers. This notion has been applied to structural analysis of biomolecules such as proteins and RNAs. Topological indices It is possible to set up equations correlating direct quantitative structure activity relationships with experimental properties, usually referred to as topological indices (TIs). Topological indices are used in the development of quantitative structure- activity relationships (QSARs) in which the biological activity or other properties of molecules are correlated with their chemical structure.

In 1919 and 1920, Lieutenant Commander Cooke repeated the process for the larger submarine , distinguishing himself when she accidentally sank on 1 September 1920 by saving the lives of 37 men trapped in her wreck. This is documented in A. J. Hill's book, \\"Under Pressure: The Final Voyage of Submarine S-5\\". During the remainder of the 1920s, he was executive officer of the submarine tender , had shore duty at the Cavite and Mare Island Navy Yards, was gunnery officer of the battleship , and served at the United States Department of the Navy in Washington, D.C.. From 1931 to 1933, Commander Cooke commanded a submarine division, attended the Naval War College Senior Course, was Commandant of the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, had further Navy Department duty and was war plans and logistics officer with the United States Fleet staff. Promoted to captain in June 1938, Cooke soon returned to Washington, D.C., for duty with the Chief of Naval Operations war plans staff. He took command of the battleship in February 1941, saw her through the 7 December 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, that brought the United States into World War II, and remained with her into 1942. By then a rear admiral, Cooke became the principal planning officer for Admiral Ernest J. King, who was both Commander in Chief, U.S. Fleet, and Chief of Naval Operations. He played a vital role on Kings staff as a brilliant strategistFrank, Richard B., \\"Picking Winners?\\", Naval History, June 2011. until after the end of World War II in 1945, serving as Chief of Naval Plans and as Advocate for Naval Management of War in Pacific and working on issues related to the Navys transition from a battleship- centered orientation to one focused on aircraft carrier task forces. He was present at Omaha Beach during the Allied invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944, and finished the war as Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Operations with the rank of vice admiral. Between the end of 1945 and early 1948, as an admiral, Cooke commanded the Seventh Fleet and Naval Forces, Western Pacific, also serving as naval consultant to the Republic of Chinas leader, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek.

He has also contributed to the similar Australian wrestling publication Piledriver and long-running newsletter Wrestling Then and Now as well as professional wrestling websites ProWrestlingDaily.com and Bill Apter's 1wrestling.com. Conlan has also done work for the online version of The Sun, the most-read daily newspaper in the United Kingdom. Biography =Early life and influences= Jason Conlan developed an interest in drawing and professional wrestling as a child. As early as the age of six, he began watching Steve Rickard's NWA-affiliated promotion All Star Pro-Wrestling and its wrestling programme On the Mat. He became an avid fan of the show and was encouraged to begin drawing some of the wrestlers he saw such as Baron Von Krupp. After On the Mat was cancelled in 1984, Conlan started reading Pro Wrestling Illustrated and began following professional wrestling in the United States. Though he enjoyed WWF Superstars of Wrestling when it debuted in New Zealand in 1987, the country's first regular American wrestling show, Conlan favoured the National Wrestling Alliance, specifically Jim Crockett Promotions, partly due to being a fan of the NWA-friendly \\"Apter mags\\" and found its wrestlers more interesting to draw. Conlan continued developing his artistic talent, carefully studying comic book art, newspaper comic strips, and political cartoons, and started selling his own drawings while a high school student. Conlan also had a regular spot in his local newspaper. He considered attending art school but found it \\"to be boring and expensive\\". =Pro Wrestling Illustrated= Conlan was working part-time in a comic book store when he first contacted the offices of Pro Wrestling Illustrated via cold calling in 1995. His first call was \\"politely declined\\" but had better luck two weeks later and was put through to then editor Bill Apter. He had previously worked on the Australian wrestling magazine Piledriver and the Wrestling Then and Now newsletter, however, it was his work for PWI which would give him his first big break. After two months of negotiations, he accepted an offer from publisher Stu Saks to draw a monthly cartoon in addition to 30 full-page cartoons for their wrestling annual. He would eventually go on to illustrate all of Saks' wrestling magazines. His comic strip On the Mat, named in honour of the wrestling programme Conlan watched as a child, debuted later that year and continues to appear in PWI as of 2010. Conlan, also employed at a bookstore, is also a contributing artist for professional wrestling websites ProWrestlingDaily.com and 1wrestling.com, the latter owned by Bill Apter. He has also contributed to the online version of The Sun, the most widely read daily newspaper in the United Kingdom, which also carries artwork from On the Mat for its sports columns. =Recent years= A member of the Australian Webcomics Collective, Conlan has also drawn art for the long-running Australian comic anthology series DeeVee. In July 2007, his comic strip \\"Mister J and the Pirates\\" appeared in DeeVee 2007 alongside work from Eddie Campbell, Jeffrey Brown, Mandy Ord, Jason Paulos, Daren White, David Tang, Matt \\"Stikman\\" Huynh, Daniel Best, Andy Finlayson, Daniel Gibbs and Lee Slattery. Reception Conlan's work has garnered some interest from within the wrestling industry. When World Championship Wrestling was touring New Zealand during its final years, he sent some of his artwork to their office and was invited to meet some of the wrestlers during the tour. Scott Steiner, he was told, had expressed some negative comments towards a caricature he had done of Steiner and was warned to stay away from him during the tour. The popular Mexican luchadore Puma had the opposite reaction praising Conlan and commenting \\"When I saw myself [in the PWI comic strip] I thought I might as well just retire right there. It just doesn't get any better than that.\\" In recent years, Conlan has expressed an interest in having his artwork commissioned by World Wrestling Entertainment, as many of his favourite caricatures are of WWE superstars, such as illustrating a daily cartoon for WWE.com.

He played at the end and fullback positions for the Michigan Wolverines football teams from 1910 to 1913. He developed a reputation as an excellent forward passer and was one of the earliest Michigan players to have success as a passer. Early years A native of Detroit, Michigan, Torbet attended the Detroit public schools. He attended Detroit Central High School and was a star of the school's football teams in 1908 and 1909. After the 1908 season, the school's yearbook noted that Torbet's \\"sensational playing was a bright feature of every game.\\" He was unanimously selected as the captain of the school's 1909 football team. At Detroit Central, he was a teammate of Jimmy Craig and \\"Bubbles\\" Patterson -— both of whom later joined Torbet on the University of Michigan football team. University of Michigan 1911 Michigan Wolverines football team Torbet graduated from high school in 1910 and enrolled at the University of Michigan. He was a reserve on Michigan's football team in 1910, and a three-year starter at the end, fullback and halfback positions from 1911 to 1913.(started three games at left halfback in 1911)(started five games at end in 1912)(started four games at end, and two at fullback in 1913) The Wolverines compiled a record of 16-4-2 in Torbet's three years as a starter. Torbet was one of the earliest Michigan Wolverines football players to have success as a forward passer. The forward pass was not legalized until 1906, and it was not until 1913 (after the success that year of Gus Dorais and Knute Rockne at Notre Dame) that the forward pass was widely popularized.Cross, Harry, \\"Inventing the Forward Pass\\", November 1, 1913, reprinted in \\"This Day in Sports\\", The New York Times, November 1, 2004 Two years before Dorais and Rockne popularized the passing game, Torbet developed a reputation as one of the game's best forward passers. The Detroit Free Press wrote that, in 1911, \\"his long forward passes were largely instrumental in bringing Michigan her victory.\\" In the final game of the 1912 season, on fourth down with seven yards to go in the fourth quarter, Torbet threw a touchdown pass to Miller Pontius to give Michigan the lead against Cornell; Michigan won the game 20-7. The New York Times praised Torbet's work in the \\"whirlwind finish\\" against Cornell: > While Cornell did not have as strong a team as was expected, the Wolverines' > expert use of the forward pass placed them on a higher plane than they have > reached before this fall. ... It was the forward pass that did the work, and > to 'Squib' Torbet belongs the glory. His heaves were excellent. At the end of the 1912 season, Torbet was selected by Fielding H. Yost as a first-team player on his All-Western team. In early 1913, Torbet announced plans to leave the university, stating that he was not satisfied with the results of his last semester's examinations. However, in late February 1913, he announced that he had reconsidered his decision and would return to the football team in the fall of 1913. The Detroit Free Press reported: \\"It seems that the forward-passing end was a bit hasty in making up his mind to leave and that when the matter was gone into carefully it was found that he was not in bad shape at all scholastically.\\" As a senior in 1913, he was moved to the fullback position where he continued to develop a reputation as an effective forward passer. At the end of October 1913, the Detroit Free Press wrote: > The showing of 'Squib' Torbet at fullback this afternoon was the one bright > spot in an otherwise dismal scrimmage. ... On his off tackle plunges the new > Yost fullback was always good for a gain.

The aim of Torbet was perfect. The ball went > like a streak and was high and true. Later years Torbet graduated from the University of Michigan in 1914. In September 1914, he was reportedly hired to teach and coach football at the Colorado School of Mines. (Colorado School of Mines records, however, reflect that William Hanley was the head football coach during the 1914 and 1915 seasons.) He studied sociology at Michigan and, after graduating, devoted himself \\"to both practical and theoretical sociology.\\" He worked as a supervisor of athletics at Detroit parks. He married Gladys Evelyn Matheson on April 18, 1916 in Detroit. In the fall of 1916, Torbet coached the Timken club football team—a team composed of \\"mechanics and office men who are employed in the various departments of the big plant of the Timken Detroit Axle company.\\" Torbet lived in Northville, Michigan in his later years. He died in February 1974 at age 84.

LTC LAKIN, Terrence L.) was a United States Army criminal trial that found Terrence Lakin guilty on four counts of disobeying orders and one count of missing movement. The trial took place over December 14–16, 2010. Doctor Terry Lakin, a lieutenant colonel in the United States Army, announced that he would refuse deployment, and subsequently refused to deploy to Afghanistan because of his concerns over President Obama's constitutional eligibility to be president. It was Lakin's hope that he could request a copy of Obama's birth certificate as part of a court-martial, a goal that had eluded previous military defendants. Lakin had the support of three retired American generals. Before Lakin went to court- martial, it was found by the judge that President Obama's eligibility (and hence his birth certificate) had no bearing on the case. Lakin pleaded guilty to two charges while pleading not-guilty to one other. Despite recanting his original concerns and asking the jury for leniency, Lakin was found guilty of all charges and sentenced to dismissal from the Army, loss of pay and allowances, and a prison term of six months. Lakin was released from the United States Disciplinary Barracks after serving five of his six months. He was later denied a medical license in Kansas as a result of his dereliction of duty. Background Terrence Lee Lakin is a native of Greeley, Colorado, and graduated from University High School. , Lakin was married with three children. After studying biology at Colorado College in 1987, Lakin attended medical school at the Kansas City University of Medicine and Biosciences in 1993, and completed his residency at Womack Army Medical Center. Lakin's postgraduate education was undertaken at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in 2007. He has a doctorate in osteopathic medicine and a master's degree in public health. Lakin deployed with the US Army six times prior to his dismissal from the service. In 2005, while assigned as a flight surgeon to the 4th Cavalry Regiment, then-Major Lakin was named as the Army Medical Department's Flight Surgeon of the Year for 2004. Prior to his court- martial, Lakin was awarded two Achievement Medals, three Army Commendation Medals, one Meritorious Service Medal, and one Bronze Star Medal; he was also a US Army selectee for promotion to colonel. After the 2008 election of Barack Obama, Lakin fruitlessly attempted to personally certify the president's constitutional eligibility for the office through his congressional representatives and his military chain of command. To his Army superiors, Lakin argued that \\"he believed that based on their oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution, military officers should be allowed to demand proof of the President's eligibility.\\" Refusal to deploy Assigned to the DiLorenzo TRICARE Health Clinic (a constituent command of Joint Task Force National Capital Region Medical), then-Lieutenant Colonel (LTC) Lakin had orders to report to Fort Campbell, Kentucky on April 12, 2010, for his second deployment to Afghanistan. Lakin described his orders as \\"illegal\\", because as \\"all orders have their origin with the commander-in-chief\\", and since he claimed that President Obama had not satisfactorily proven his constitutional eligibility for his station, those orders could not be followed. After researching what options were open to him, Lakin approached the American Patriot Foundation, Inc. (APF) with his idea for a video wherein he would explain his reasons for intending to disobey orders. Margaret Hemenway, spokesperson for the APF, told the Greeley Tribune that she had directed Lakin to speak with a lawyer who attempted to dissuade the soldier, and that Lakin filmed the video anyway. On March 30, 2010, the APF posted Lakin's video to YouTube. In the video, Lakin invited his court-martial not only to cause the president's legitimacy to be scrutinized, but also because he wanted the president to produce his original 1961 birth certificate to prove his \\"birth on American soil\\" and natural born-status. Hemenway, speaking for the APF to Salon, repeatedly claimed that President Obama hadn't even released the same birth certificate Lakin had to give the military. (At the time of Lakin's demands, Hawaii did not release images or copies of original birth certificates, and President Obama had already released an image of the record of his birth as provided by the Hawaii Department of Health.) The APF also raised funds to assist in Lakin's defense. Prior to April 12, Army officials stated they were aware of Lakin's intent to \\"violate articles 87 and 92 of [the] Uniform Code of Military Justice\\", but until he did so they had nothing further upon which to comment. Instead of complying with his deployment orders, Lakin reported to the Pentagon. After being Mirandized and informed by his commanding officer—Colonel Gordon Ray Roberts—that he would face court- martial, Lakin's Pentagon access badge and governmental laptop were confiscated. Pending his court-martial, Lakin was assigned to duty at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C. =Analysis= Salon contributor Alex Koppelman noted that LTC Lakin was not the first US military member to \\"become a birther cause celebre\\", indicating the cases of Major Stefan F. Cook (Cook v. Good) and Captain Connie Rhodes (Rhodes v. MacDonald). Koppelman explained that neither of these lawsuits succeeded in a ruling on Obama's eligibility to be president. In contrast, since a court case (in this case, a court-martial) was the likely conclusion to Lakin's actions, his attorneys hoped that he could seek President Obama's original birth certificate for use in his defense. Chris Lawrence, CNN's Pentagon correspondent, noted in August 2010 that an Opinion Research Corporation poll showed that 27% of \\"Americans think President Obama probably or definitely was not born in the United States.\\" Lawrence reported that some of the remaining 73% argued that legal cases like Lakin's are fundraising opportunities for \\"certain political causes.\\" =Support for Lakin= When contacted by the Greeley Tribune in spring 2010, Lakin's father—Frank Lakin—said that his son's video \\"does not reflect the opinions or the attitude of the family by any means […] We're Obama supporters.\\" Prior to Lakin officially violating his order to deploy, former Republican U.S. Senator Bob Smith, who founded the American Patriot Foundation, said: \\"...my personal belief is that when an officer has a constitutional question I don't have a problem with that being answered, that's his legal right to have that answered, but I'm not involved in it.\\" Jelani Cobb with The New Yorker reported in 2016 that then-Congressional Representative Tom Price spoke about Lakin in 2009/2010, saying that the lientenant-colonel had raised salient questions about President Obama's eligibility for office. Three retired United States generals expressed support for Lakin. The first was retired Army Major General Paul E. Vallely, a senior military analyst for Fox News. In an interview, Vallely stated \\"I think many in the military – and many out of the military – question the natural-birth status of Barack Obama.\\" Following Vallely's announcement, retired Army Major General Jerry Curry and retired Air Force Lieutenant General (and Fox News analyst) Thomas McInerney also expressed public support for Lakin. Court- martial =Pre-trial= Lakin's civilian lawyer—Costa Mesa, California-based personal injury lawyer Paul Rolf Jensen—pursued the tack that if the president's original 1961 birth certificate were released, and if it proved that presidential ineligibility, \\"the prosecution would have no taste for ending Col. Lakin's career.\\" When asked about the president's already-released record of birth, Jensen replied, \\"I don't know what you're seeing but I haven't seen an original long form certificate signed by the doctor that gave birth to him, the very same document that Colonel Lakin was ordered to in order to deploy.\\" Colonel Lind, trial judge On August 6, 2010, in a Virginia courtroom with standing-room only, Lakin was charged with \\"three charges of disobeying a lawful order, one count of missing movement (not deploying with his unit) and one count of dereliction of duty.\\" He and his legal team petitioned the military judge—Colonel Denise Lind—for a delay in pleading to allow for time to file a motion to dismiss. Judge Lind allowed the defense a two-week delay for that purpose, and then another successive week to allow both parties \\"to formulate and send written responses to the motion.\\" The motion's hearings were scheduled for September 2 & 14, and if the motion failed, the court-martial was scheduled to start on October 13. Lakin also waived his choice of either a bench trial or a jury trial. In September, Lind ruled that whether President Obama was constitutionally qualified for office had no legal bearing on Lakin's case. As such, Lakin could not make any demands for the president's birth certificate as part of his trial. After Lind's ruling, defendant Lakin dismissed defense attorney Jensen, going on to hire retired United States Marine Corps Colonel Neal Puckett as counsel. Puckett disagreed with Jensen's recommendation that the Lakin should approach his constitutional misgivings by disobeying orders, but felt that his client's decision was \\"a courageous act of civil disobedience\\" nonetheless. Ultimately, because of Lind's ruling, Puckett felt that Lakin would probably be convicted. =Trial= On December 14, 2010, the first day of Lakin's court-martial at Fort George G. Meade, Lakin pleaded guilty to four counts of disobeying orders (with one being dismissed as redundant at the request of his counsel), and pleaded not-guilty to missing movement, considered the gravest of his charges. Judge Lind accepted Lakin's guilty pleas and convicted him duly; the court- martial continued on the second charge. As to missing movement, Puckett argued that Lakin's orders did not specifically require the surgeon to fly, and that he could have opted to \\"choose an alternate method of travel.\\" jurors were asked about their awareness of the \\"birther movement\\". Facing up to 3.5 years in military prison and dismissal from the Army, on December 15 Lakin changed tack and stated that he was wrong to question the president's qualifications through his military service. He requested that the jury allow him to continue his career in the military (\\"I don't want it to end this way, I want to continue to serve\\"), and that he would now undertake his deployment if he could, even with his concerns about the president unaddressed. The defense brought witnesses before the court to testify on Lakin's behalf, describing the accused as a \\"compassionate physician\\" who always volunteered to help when needed. The prosecution introduced the officer that was deployed in Lakin's stead, who testified alongside his wife about how the last-minute deployment affected their lives. Lakin at sentencing Lakin was found guilty of all charges on December 16. After five hours of deliberation, the jury sentenced him to six months in a military prison, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and dismissal from the Army (the officer equivalent to a dishonorable discharge). The sentence was approved by Major General Karl Horst. Lakin would begin his sentence immediately, though an automatic appeal would go before the United States Army Court of Criminal Appeals. Confinement and beyond Lakin served five months in the United States Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, being released a month early on May 13, 2011. On July 28, 2011, the United States Army Court of Criminal Appeals granted Lakin's request to withdraw his case from appellate review. Speaking on the subject of his outstanding appeals in June 2011, Lakin foresaw no complications in continuing to practice medicine. On 21 October 2011, the Kansas State Board of Healing Arts denied Lakin a license to practice medicine in Kansas saying he \\"potentially jeopardized the health, safety and welfare of the military troops for which applicant was employed to provide medical care.\\" Lakin later co- authored a 2012 book on his experiences, Officer's Oath: Why My Vow to Defend the Constitution Demanded that I Sacrifice My Career. By August 16, 2014, Lakin was working for the Southern Colorado Clinic in Pueblo, Colorado. On 21 January 2017, a petition at We the People was created by \\"G.W.\\" entitled, \\"Reinstate Lt. Col. Terry Lakin into the U.S. Army with full rank, pay, benefits and pension immediately.\\" In its 30-day run, only 6143 people signed the petition, only six percent of what was required to receive an official response from the Trump administration (100,000). In early 2017, Michael Miner with the Chicago Reader spoke with Marco Ciavolino, a close friend of Lakin and editor of the onetime lieutenant-colonel's 2012 book. Ciavolino says he told President Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen about pardoning Lakin, as it would \\"allow Lakin to recover hundreds of thousands of dollars in back pay and benefits, and make him eligible to go back into the army.\\" Both Lakin and Ciavolino bemoaned the petition as premature; arriving right after Trump's inauguration, it was likely \\"there's a lot of more urgent things going on.\\" Miner noted the possibility that, even if the petition had received 100,000 signatures, the new president had previously vacillated on the subject of Obama's citizenship. , the Terry Lakin Action Fund site still claims that President Obama's birth certificates are forgeries, and says of Lakin himself: References Trials in the United States Lakin ","title":"Court-martial of Terry Lakin"},{"id":"30276327","text":"Grape grower Dick Boushey Boushey Vineyard is a grape-growing estate located in the Yakima Valley AVA, north of Grandview, Washington.

History The Dreamworld Express opened with Dreamworld on 15 December 1981 as the Cannonball Express. At the time the railway only featured a single stop in Main Street. A steam locomotive built by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1917 was purchased and of track was said to have been laid to develop the ride. This figure must relate to the quantity of rail used as reference to maps shows that the line is only about in length. The Baldwin locomotive was originally used during the First World War in France before being relocated to Queensland for use on the cane fields. At the time of its opening, the Cannonball Express was said to be the Longest privately owned railway in Australia. However, this was clearly incorrect. It is not even the longest privately owned passenger railway. A second steam locomotive, built by Perry Engineering in 1951, which had also seen service at a Queensland sugar mill, was purchased and put into service on the railway. Until the late 1990s the railway operated with both steam locomotives in peak periods. The railway then shifted to operations on a rotational basis, with one train being serviced while the other would operate normally. The two locomotives could each tow carriages to cater for up 160 passengers at a time. A set of covered cars were mostly used on the railway, with a set of uncovered carriages, now disposed of, being rarely used unless both trains were operating. A carriage with disabled access was always added to the end of at least one of the operating trains. After Easter 2013, Dreamworld began operating the train only on weekends and school holidays. The park subsequently replaced the two steam locomotives with a diesel replacement. The diesel masquerades as a steam locomotive and was built by ride manufacturers C&S; in Italy. The ride now operates as the Dreamworld Express. On 26 January 2016 Dreamworld reintroduced the Baldwin locomotive as a one-off event. Subsequently, it was announced that the steam locomotive would operate on the first Saturday of every month and on other occasions. Stations Four stations are located throughout the park. The first is Central Park Station located at the end of Main Street at the bottom of the hill. The railway cuts across a main pathway through the use of a set of boom gates before navigating between the Tower of Terror II, Rivertown, Wiggles World and Tiger Island before arriving at the second station. The second station is located in a portion of Rivertown near the Billabong Buffet restaurant. Directly after the station the train passes another set of boom gates before passing the Dreamworld Woolshed and part of the Dreamworld Corroboree. A station is located in Dreamworld Corroboree with entry and exit via the Kai-Kai Café and Bunya Trading Gift Shop. The railway then passes the rest of the Dreamworld Corroboree alongside the Murrisipi River before arriving at the fourth and final station at Rocky Hollow. The station is located near the Rocky Hollow Log Ride and its on-ride photo shop. The final section of railway travels around the former location of the Blue Lagoon water park as well as Dreamworld Studios where Big Brother Australia is filmed. It then returns to Central Park Station in Main Street after passing the railway maintenance sheds. This railroad is slightly based on the Disneyland Railroad, with the Baldwin locomotive resembling the #4 Ernest S. Marsh locomotive (appropriate enough, it also uses #4), the cars designed with the Excursion III design, and there being four station stops.

It was opened in 1858 and is one of the oldest railways in Germany. History  In 1841 the Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar- Eisenach and the duchies of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Saxe-Meiningen signed a treaty to establish a railway from Eisenach to Coburg. This also covered the construction of a line from Coburg to Sonneberg, connecting Sonneberg with the city of Meiningen and south to Bavaria. Passenger train with class 86 steam locomotive at Coburg, Kalenderweg level crossing in 1958 in 1855 the newly formed Werra Railway Company (Werra-Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft) received a concession to build and operate the line and on 1 November 1858 the Werra Railway was opened. 28 years later, on 1 October 1886, a 19.2 km long extension was opened from Sonneberg to Lauscha. On 1 October 1895, the Werra- Railway Company, including this line, was acquired by the Prussian government and it was administered by the railway administration of the Deutsche Reichsbahn in Erfurt until 1945. The timetable of the German State Railway (Deutsche Reichsbahn) in 1939 included 14 daily passenger trains and an express train in each direction with a running time on the line of 20 minutes for the expresses. After the occupation by Thuringia by Soviet troops in July 1945, operations between Sonneberg and Neustadt were interrupted. On 1 September 1947, freight services resumed over the Inner German Border, with a break during the Berlin Blockade. Two pairs of freight trains each day had been approved by the occupying powers for the transport of coke from Neustadt to Sonneberg, but traffic was small and irregular. On 30 September 1951 the last run took place, which was followed by the dismantling of the tracks in the spring of 1952. Coburg station The Coburg–Neustadt section was electrified in 1975 with a financial subsidy from the State of Bavaria. This allowed the avoiding of a locomotive change to a class 86 steam locomotive or a class 280 diesel locomotive in Coburg. Instead the class 144 electric locomotives continued to Neustadt. In 1979, Oeslau station was renamed Rödental station and a new station building was opened. A year later rail operation on weekends were abandoned. After the fall of the Inner German Border the line through the gap between Neustadt and Sonneberg was immediately reinstated. Some of the land had to be bought back as only a few years earlier part of the line had been sold to the Bavarian forest service. On 28 September 1991 the 3.5 km long, former cross-border section from Neustadt to Sonneberg was returned to service, it was electrified from the first day. From 2004 to 2006, DB Station&Service; rehabilitated platforms along the line (at Neustadt, Mönchröden and Rödental stations) and adapted them for disabled people. In addition, the new halts of Coburg Nord and Rödental Mitte were built and put into operation on 11 December 2005. Operations  Sonneberg Hauptbahnhof Train hauled by 143-128 at Coburg–Kalenderweg level crossing in 2008 Deutsche Bahn Regional-Express trains run on the line every hour (route number 820). They run to Bamberg and on to Nuremberg, alternating via Lichtenfels and via Nuremberg–Erfurt high-speed railway. Trains are usually requiring 22 minutes for the route, stopping at all stations. The regional express are operated by Bombardier Talent 2 (class 442) sets and Vectron locomotives with double-deck carriages. Scheduled freight traffic has been re-established. When required, IntEgro Verkehr GmbH operates container trains from Monday to Fridays from Hof to Sonneberg Ost and return.

On 7 January 1862, approximately 3,000 French soldiers landed at Vera Cruz. Small British and Spanish contingents that were originally part of the adventure preferred to withdraw quickly leaving only the French forces assisted by small numbers of Austrian, Belgian and Turkish troops. These forces, whose numbers would later rise to approximately 38,000 men, were successively placed under the command of generals Charles de Lorencez, Élie Frédéric Forey and finally François Achille Bazaine. The campaign was the scene of some of the most notable battles in French military history, such as the glorious struggle for the village of Camaron where, on 30 April 1863, sixty two legionnaires resisted bravely for nine hours against over two thousand Mexicans, allowing for the capture of the city of Puebla on 17 May 1863 thus paving the way to Mexico. In the capital, an assembly of notables recognized Archduke Maximilian of Habsburg, brother of Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria, as Emperor of Mexico. However, even with the support of 20,000 Mexicans who embraced the new emperor, Maximilian's forces were harassed in their work of pacification by the troops of President Benito Juárez who had the support of the United States. In February 1867, Emperor Napoleon III ordered the repatriation of all remaining French troops from Mexico, the last elements left the port of Vera Cruz on 12 March 1867. An abandoned Emperor Maximilian, defeated and captured near the city of Querétaro, was executed in June of that year. Award statute The Commemorative medal of the Mexico Expedition was awarded by the emperor, to all those who took part in the Mexico Expedition, upon nomination and approval by the minister under which the corps or service of the potential recipient was attached. The medal was to be worn on the left breast. No minimum time of service was mentioned in the award statute. A later decree of 16 April 1864 added the Commemorative medal of the Mexico Expedition to the list of previous awards that could be revoked following a condemnation to a fixed prison term of one year or more for a crime committed by the recipient. Award description The Commemorative medal of the Mexico Expedition was a 30 mm in diameter circular silver medal. Its obverse bore the left profile of Emperor Napoleon III crowned with a laurel wreath surrounded by the relief inscription \\"NAPOLEON III\\" \\"EMPEREUR\\" (). A 4 mm wide relief laurel wreath ran along the entire circumference of both the obverse and reverse of the medal. On the reverse, within the laurel wreath, the circular relief inscription \\" * EXPEDITION DU MEXIQUE * 1862•1863\\" (), two small five pointed stars separating the text from the dates. At the center, the relief inscription on five lines of the campaign's major battles \\"CUMBRES\\" \\"CERRO-BORREGO\\" \\"SAN-LORENZO\\" \\"PUEBLA\\" \\"MEXICO\\". The medal hung from a 36 mm wide white silk moiré ribbon bearing 5 mm red and green stripes arranged at a 45 degree angle forming a cross, over which was superimposed a black eagle, its wings spread and holding a green snake in its beak and talons, a design inspired by the coat of arms of Mexico.

The medal was awarded with no condition of minimum time of service or participation in a particular military campaign; it was, however, necessary to prove one's right to the medal with a record of service or leave record. A later decree of 16 April 1864 added the Saint Helena Medal to the list of awards that could be revoked following a condemnation to a fixed prison term of one year or more for a crime committed by the recipient. The Saint Helena Medal was accompanied by an award certificate from the Grand Chancery of the Legion of Honour and came in a white cardboard box with intricate ornamentation on the lid in the form of an embossed imperial eagle over the inscription on seven lines \\"AUX COMPAGNONS DE GLOIRE DE NAPOLÉON I DÉCRET IMPÉRIAL DU 12 AOÛT 1857\\" (). Award description The Saint Helena Medal is of irregular shape and struck from bronze. It is a 2 cm in diameter circular medallion surrounded by a 50mm wide laurel wreath tied with a bow at the bottom. Atop the medal, a 2 cm wide Imperial Crown. The obverse of the medallion bears the relief image of the right profile of Emperor Napoleon I surrounded by the relief inscription \\"NAPOLÉON I EMPEREUR\\" (). A ring or small orbs separates the central medallion from the wreath. Just below the image of the emperor, a small anchor, the privy mark of the award's designer, Désiré-Albert Barre. The reverse is identical except for the medallion which bears the relief circular inscription within a narrow 20mm band \\"CAMPAGNES DE 1792 A 1815\\" (). In the centre, the relief inscription on nine lines \\"A\\" \\"SES\\" \\"COMPAGNONS\\" \\"DE GLOIRE\\" \\"SA DERNIÈRE\\" \\"PENSÉE\\" \\"STE HÉLÈNE\\" \\"5 MAI\\" \\"1821\\" (). The medal should hang from a 38mm wide green silk moiré ribbon bearing five 1,8mm wide red vertical stripes spaced 4,5mm apart and 1mm red edge stripes. The ribbon passes through a suspension ring, itself passing through a lateral hole in the imperial crown's orb atop the medal. Image:Médaille de ste helene revers.jpgReverse of the St Helena medal.

Built in 1787 by Will Blake, a sugar planter, it is stated to be the oldest structure on the island. Although gutted by the French in the late 1790s, it was rebuilt by the British and today has been fully restored, with its kitchen complex, stables and slave quarters intact. A church in the vicinity contains a stone fascia with open- air side walls and a ceiling, which is the form of a hull of a ship. Wallblake House is one of the ten heritage houses in The Valley that was refurbished over a seven-year period and completed in 2004, at a cost of EC$250,000 (about US$92,000). The Wallblake Trust gained the support of the Catholic Church, many local enthusiasts and NGOS. The Heritage Trail Committee has raised the status of this house consequent to an agreement between the Wallblake Trust and the Anguilla Heritage Trail. It is Anguilla's only surviving plantation house. History The house was built in the mid to late 1700s. The name \\"Walblake\\" is probably a distortion of William Blake, a planter who lived around the end of the 18th century. The construction date, 1787, is noted from an inscription on an old brick on the northern kitchen wing. The first known historical event that occurred at the house was the French invasion by Victor Hugues of this island in 1796 when the Wallblake House witnessed a “crippled Anguillian” known as Hodge, taking shelter in its cellar. However, he could not escape the French soldiers who caught and executed him. This was followed by their gutting the property. The execution of the injured Anguillian further led to a reparation reflex reaction by the Anguillians as they executed the French prisoners of war who had been detained in the Old Court House on Crocus Hill, without trial. However, the French were not successful in their invasion effort as the local Angullians put up a brave fight and were supported by the British ship, , arriving on the scene at the right time. After this incident, the Wallblake estate was rebuilt. The house was owned by the planter Valentine Blake for some time. In the 1800s, when Anguilla experienced severe drought, the estate resorted to raising economic crops such as sugar and cotton over an area of of plantation, but with little success, the same being true with the other Anguillian plantations. Thereafter, the estate saw several owners. In the 1900s, it was with Carter Rey, a rich business baron who had bought the estate from the Lake family. Next, it was owned by his younger brother Frank Rey. In 1959, Marie Rey Lake, who had converted from the Anglican Church to being a Roman Catholic, donated the house to the Catholic Church, which continues to own it till this day. The house was leased to the Department of Tourism in 1978 for a time when they refurbished it. After the lease expired, the house was returned to the Roman Catholic Church and currently functions as a rectory. Now the heritage monument is being planned to depict the history of the island and the Anguilla's Heritage Trail. In this effort, Lilli Azevedo, an archaeologist and Heritage Trail Committee member who is providing the narration support, has planned to give expositions of the archaeological findings of Fountain Cavern related to the Amerindian archaeology of Anguilla. Architecture and features The house has a stone foundation. The roof is formed with Guyanese hardwood and is shingled. The upper section is wooden. The original structure was built with dressed stones that were probably brought from East End or even Scrub Island. The lime mortar for jointing was made from a mixture of burnt coral and shells with admixtures of molasses and marl. The original timber has been retained in the upper floors. The structure has double paneling. Intricate carvings on its edges give the effect of a \\"tray ceiling\\", that is, the appearance of inverted trays hung from the roof as if rope is tied to the edges to hide any defects in its construction. The heritage building has been restored to its original design and colour scheme. The elegant and decorative designs that existed in the original building have been fully retained. Grounds The grounds have a bakery, cistern, and stable block. Tall, Spanish bayonet trees are on the property. An adjacent church has a unique decorative stone front facade. Tourism Set behind a white picket fence, Wallblake is now a private house, and living quarters of the priest from St Gerard's Roman Catholic Church. However, tours can be arranged. However, it also serves as a museum annex, as well as a venue for art shows, flower shops and marriage receptions. The international airport in The Valley, just to the south of the house, was named Wallblake Airport, and has now been renamed Clayton J. Lloyd International Airport.

The leak, which began on 28 November 2010, occurred when the website of WikiLeaks — an international new media non- profit organisation that publishes submissions of otherwise unavailable documents from anonymous news sources and news leaks — started to publish classified documents of detailed correspondence — diplomatic cables — between the United States Department of State and its diplomatic missions around the world. Since the initial release date, WikiLeaks is releasing further documents every day. Financial support for terrorist groups Diplomats claim that Saudi Arabian donors are the main funders of non-governmental armed groups like Al-Qaeda, the Taliban and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). Militants seeking donations often come during the annual hajj pilgrimage, Umrah and Ramadan. In one occasion, LeT, which carried out the 2008 Mumbai attacks, used a Saudi- based front company to fund its activities. A main concern of the officials at the U.S. embassy in Riyadh is protecting Saudi oilfields from al-Qaida attacks.

Afghanistan-Saudi relations Afghan President Karzai's visited Saudi Arabia on February 2–3, although richer in symbolism than significance, was a sign that lukewarm Saudi-Afghan relations may finally be warming up. Saudi Arabia announced an aid package of US$150 million for reconstruction in Afghanistan. However, the Saudis continue to have concerns about Afghan corruption and believe greater political unification of the Pashtun community is essential. Their apparent wish to de-emphasize Karzai's visit, may also indicate the King Abdullah's desire to keep some distance and maintain his credibility as a potential reconciliation mediator. Saudi Foreign Minister, Prince Turki Al Faisal called Afghanistan a \\"puzzle,\\" \\"where establishing trust with Afghan leaders, and recognizing the links between Pakistan and the Taliban, were keys to success. All financial aid to the Afghan government should be conditional, benchmarks must be set for the leadership, and aid must be withheld until these are met.\\" GCC-Saudi relations Saudi Arabia attempts to block co-operative projects between other GCC members. Furthermore, the Saudis are blocking a proposed causeway project between Qatar and the UAE and a proposed gas pipeline project between Qatar and Kuwait, because of Saudi objections, the Kuwaitis are now turning to the Iranians for gas. The Qatar-UAE causeway, when combined with the planned Qatar Bahrain Causeway, would greatly facilitate travel between the three countries this would eliminate the need to transit through Saudi Arabia.

Saudi Arabia was also opposed to Qatar's and Bahrain's plan to seek better ties with Iraq. According to American diplomats, like the Iranians, the Saudis have not hesitated to use their money and political influence inside Iraq. Iraqi contacts assess that the Saudi goal and that of most other Sunni Arab states, to vary degrees is to enhance Sunni influence, diminish Shia dominance and promote the formation of a weak and fractured Iraqi government. The Saudis are using their money and media power through satellite channel like Al-Arabiyya, Al-Sharqiya and other various media they control or influence to support Sunni political aspirations, exert influence over Sunni tribal groups and counter the Shia-led Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq (ISCI) and Iraqi National Alliance (INA).

The Saudi monarch stated that he does not trust Nouri al Maliki because the Iraqi Prime Minister had \\"lied\\" to him in the past by promising to take certain actions and then failing to do so. The King did not say precisely what these allegedly broken promises might have been. He repeated his oft heard view that al-Maliki rules Iraq on behalf of his Shiite sect instead of all Iraqis. King Abdullah has expressed his dismay over Nouri al Maliki by stating that he does not trust him and calling him an \\"Iranian agent.\\" The King and Princes all suggested that the Saudi government might be willing to consider the provision of economic and humanitarian assistance to Iraq at initial stages it would be in the range $75–300 million.

The Saudis are funding projects in Yemeni tribal areas so the tribal leaders eject radicals.\\" Anti-Shiism as Saudi Foreign Policy Iraqi officials have noted that frequent anti-Shia outbursts from Saudi religious figures are often allowed to circulate without sanction or disapproval from the Saudi leadership, moreover Wahabbi Sunni Islam condones religious incitement against Shia. The Saudis have traditionally viewed Iraq as a Sunni-dominated bulwark against the spread of Shiism and Iranian political influence. In the aftermath of bombings in predominantly Shia areas across the country in 2009 that killed dozens, PM Maliki pointed publicly to one such statement, made by a Saudi imam in May, and stated, \\"We have observed that many governments have been suspiciously silent on the fatwa provoking the killing of Shiites.\\" \\"Shi'a triangle\\" An April 2009 cable claims that United Arab Emirates Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed stated there is \\"Saudi concern of a [Shi'a] triangle in the region between Iran, the Maliki government in Iraq, and Pakistan under Zardari.\\" Saudi support for a Palestinian state During French President Sarkozy's visit to Saudi Arabia, King Abdullah agreed to support the Annapolis initiative to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Abdullah told Sarkozy that the issue of Palestinian refugees must first be resolved and that the Israelis must cease all West Bank settlement construction. Abdullah maintained that East Jerusalem must be the capital of a Palestinian state and that this section of Jerusalem must be solely under Arab control. Guantanamo Bay detainees King Abdullah proposed that Guantanamo detainees could be monitored by \\"implanting detainees with an electronic chip containing information about them and allowing their movements to be tracked with Bluetooth. This was done with horses and falcons.\\" Vice in Saudi Arabia =Nightlife= In Jeddah, despite the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (CPVPV) — the religious police of Saudi Arabia, there is an ongoing underground nightlife, which includes \\"the full range of worldly temptations and vices\\" i.e., \\"alcohol, drugs, sex \\" and \\"working girls\\" (prostitutes). Even though these parties are in complete violation of CPVPV's laws, the mutaween of CPVPV are afraid to raid these parties, since these parties are hosted by the young princes of al-Saud, the monarchic ruling house of Saudi Arabia. =Exclusive parties= The Economist summarised cable descriptions of \\"exclusive parties\\" in Saudi Arabia, stating, \\"An American official in Saudi Arabia describes un-Islamic mores at a clandestine Halloween party, hosted by a royal prince. Alcohol and prostitutes abounded at the event, attended by 150-plus Saudis. The host's status kept the fearsome religious police away. Such parties, the writer concluded, were increasingly typical in the kingdom.\\" Censorship and propaganda According to a May 2009 cable, the \\"Saudi regulatory system offers the al-Saud regime a means to manipulate the nation's media to promote its own agenda,\\" and criticism of the al-Saud regime is not tolerated at all. All major media outlets in Saudi Arabia — newspapers, such as Al-Watan, Al-Hayat, and Asharq Al-Awsat, and free-to-view television networks, such as MBC Group and Rotana — are owned and controlled by the al-Saud regime, and accordingly self-censorship is the order of the day — which is \\"motivated by profit and politics\\". The pro-western ideologies in these newspapers and American programming — such as Friends, Desperate Housewives, the Late Show with David Letterman and Hollywood films — are seen as an antidote to extremist religious thoughts in the recruitment of terrorists, especially young teenagers, because of the demographic target groups of these programs. Oil Production Cables revealed that the US was warned by Sadad al Husseini, a senior Saudi government oil executive, that the country's oil reserves are overstated by as much as 300 billion barrels (40% of the claimed reserve). It is therefore not possible for Saudi Arabia to prevent the oil price from rising.

Rules Like in the sport of biathlon, participants start with running, and alternate between running and shooting series of three arrows at a target from away. For scoring, it does not matter whether the target is hit in the center or at the edge. For each missed shot the athlete must run a penalty loop. The number of laps and target sizes depend on age and bow type. At the end, the fastest athlete wins.

Supported by the Anta Dam, it transfers water through a circuit to a downstream power plant. After years of delay and a cost of US$2 billion, the power complex became operational in June 2013. Background Construction on the complex began in January 2007 after the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) issued an installation permit. One goal of the project is to reduce environmental impacts created by large reservoirs. The complex's five reservoirs will have a surface area of . On August 5, 2009, the river was diverted through the Anta Dam's spillway. The rate progress is such that the completion of construction is on schedule for commissioning in 2013. The Anta Dam began to impound its reservoir in late February 2013. All three generators went into operation by early June 2013. The project was completed almost three years behind schedule. Delays were attributed to increased costs, lengthy permit approvals and a court decision which delayed the Anta Reservoir from being filled. Operation Water from the Paraíba do Sul is impounded at the high and long roller-compacted concrete Anta Dam before being diverting into a series of eight water channels, four water tunnels and five reservoirs totaling in length. At the end of the circuit, the water is fed to a power station containing 3 x Francis turbines. The Anta Dam itself supports a power station with 2 x Kaplan turbine-powered generators. The water diverted by the dam first enters channel C1 which is long, wide and deep. After C1, the water moves into the long tunnel T1 before entering the long channel C2. After C2 and the use of a dike, the water forms the Tocaia reservoir before entering channel C3 which is long. From C3, water is led into tunnel T2 and then to the long channel C4 before reaching tunnel T2A. Water from T2A enters a valley and with the assistance of two dikes, creates Louriçal reservoir. From the reservoir, water enters channel C5 which directs it to the third Calçado reservoir which is partially created by the project's largest dike of in height and in length. The Calçado reservoir uses an outlet works to remove any excess water from the reservoir and help maintain appropriate levels. Water from the reservoir then moves into the long channel C6 which feeds the project's longest tunnel, T3, at in length. From T3, water moves into the Antonina reservoir before reaching the long channel C7 and then into the Peixe reservoir which is created with the assistance of three dikes. After the reservoir, the water is transferred to intake channel C8 and from there into three long penstocks which feed the Simplício Power Plant's three Francis turbines. The penstocks provide of hydraulic head and are at a 12.48 percent angle. Once the water is discharged from the power station, it returns to the Paraíba via a long tailrace channel.

The leak, which began on 28 November 2010, occurred when the website of WikiLeaks -- an international new media non- profit organisation that publishes submissions of otherwise unavailable documents from anonymous news sources and news leaks -- started to publish classified documents of detailed correspondence -- diplomatic cables -- between the United States Department of State and its diplomatic missions around the world. Since the initial release date, WikiLeaks is releasing further documents every day. Afghanistan =Ahmad Zia Massoud= According to a cable from the American Embassy in Kabul, Vice President of Afghanistan, Ahmad Zia Massoud, was found carrying $52 million in cash that he \\"was ultimately allowed to keep without revealing the money's origin or destination.\\" The discovery was made in the United Arab Emirates by local authorities working with the Drug Enforcement Administration. =Ahmed Wali Karzai= A cable recounting meetings between American officials and Ahmed Wali Karzai, in September 2009 and February 2010, offered the following warning: \\"Note: While we must deal with AWK as the head of the Provincial Council, he is widely understood to be corrupt and a narcotics trafficker\\". Noting several of Karzai's statements are known to be false, the cables explain that \\"He appears not to understand the level of our knowledge of his activities. We will need to monitor his activity closely, and deliver a recurring, transparent message to him\\". =Hamid Karzai= Hamid Karzai, President of Afghanistan, was described as \\"paranoid\\" in one cable. =German trust fund= The U.S. military took fifteen percent of the €50 million the German government gave to a trust fund to build up the Afghan National Army. =Bacha bazi= Employees of US government contractor DynCorp paid for the services of \\"dancing boys\\", apparently a euphemistic reference to Bacha bazi, which is considered sexual slavery and child prostitution. Armenia ;Iraq War The 2010 diplomatic cable leaks revealed U.S. anger against Armenia for shipping arms to Iran. In late 2008, U.S. diplomats came to the conclusion that in 2003 -- when Serzh Sargsyan was the Defense Minister of Armenia -- the Armenian government had purchased anti-tank rockets (RPG-22) and PK machine guns from Bulgaria and supplied them to Iran. These weapons were subsequently sent by Iran to insurgents in Iraq and were used in attacks there, killing one American soldier and wounding ten. The diplomatic cables contain angry letters from Condoleezza Rice, U.S. Secretary of State, and John Negroponte, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State to Sargsyan, by-then-President of Armenia. The allegation was initially denied by Sargsyan but after U.S. diplomats presented the Armenian side with substantial evidence and pressed the country to introduce stricter export controls, Sargsyan \\"reversed the mantra he has repeated for the last four months\\" and agreed, despite Armenia National Security Service Chairman Gorik Hakobyan's attempts to lay the blame on Bulgarians. U.S. troops continue to find military equipment from the Sargsyan deal at the hands of insurgents during their raids. For instance, U.S. military personnel discovered an arms cache in Baghdad on 15 February 2008 which belonged to the Hezbollah Brigades -- an Iranian-backed Iraqi militant group. Among mostly Iran-manufactured weapons were six Bulgarian RPG-22 anti- tank weapons, production lot and serial numbers of which indicated they were produced by the Bulgarian firm which sold the weapons to Armenia. ;Radiation Portal Monitor On 26 August 2009, a car carrying three Armenian citizens entered Georgia from Armenia at the Sadakhlo border crossing. The car set off a gamma alarm on the radiation detection portal monitor. The driver provided a cursory explanation for the alarm, and the patrol police did not detain the group. On August 27, the same car returned to Armenia through the Sadakhlo crossing, and again set off a gamma alarm. At this point, the patrol police detained the occupants and searched the vehicle. Georgian officials determined that the car was contaminated with cesium-137. However, because the search did not produce any radioactive material, the occupants were released and returned to Armenia. It appears that whatever the car was carrying had been delivered.  Australia  Azerbaijan ;Political elite Azerbaijan is described as a country \\"run in a similar manner to the feudalism found in Europe in the Middle Ages\\" where well-connected families are the political elite and control certain sectors of the economy as well as certain geographic areas. This political elite uses the government's mechanisms to \\"keep out foreign competitors.\\" Among the well-connected families are First Lady Mehriban Aliyeva's family, the Pashayevs, whose members hold powerful positions in government and academia. The Pashayevs also operate extensively in Baku's construction and real-estate market, own several banks, an insurance company and Azerbaijan's only Bentley automobile dealership as well as having large investments in the financial and telecommunications sectors. In a subsequent cable, the Heydarovs are described as the second most powerful commercial family in Azerbaijan, controlling \\"a business empire in Azerbaijan ranging from fruit juice production to real estate development.\\" Minister of Emergency Situations Kamaladdin Heydarov is described as the most powerful member of the family, having amassed his wealth during his tenure as the Chairman of the State Customs Committee. ;Mehriban Aliyeva The first lady of Azerbaijan, Mehriban Aliyeva is reported to have gone through \\"substantial cosmetic surgery, (done) presumably overseas.\\" She is also dubbed more \\"fashion- conscious and daring\\" than the \\"average woman in majority-Muslim Azerbaijan\\", because she sometimes wears provocative dresses. Bangladesh =Rapid Action Battalion= The United Kingdom has assisted in training the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) an elite anti-crime and anti-terrorism unit of Bangladesh Police which is described by the Human Rights Watch as a \\"government death squad\\". It was held responsible for more than 1000 extrajudicial killings. The British training was involved in \\"investigative interviewing techniques\\" and \\"rules of engagement\\" and conducted by serving British police officers, working under the auspices of the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA). However, the U.S. has been aware of this training sessions but its government was constrained by RAB's \\"alleged human rights violations, which have rendered the organisation ineligible to receive training or assistance [by U.S.]\\". =2008 Bangladeshi general election= U.S. officials wanted leaders of both major political parties to participate in the 2008 Bangladeshi general election.

It indicates suspicion that Bangladesh's interest in peacekeeping in Africa has more to do with building influence in Africa than goodwill to the U.N. =U.S. concerns= U.S. officials seemed worried about rising numbers of Muslims, including Bangladeshis in the UK, and were collecting data about this. =DGFI support for Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami= The Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI), Bangladeshi military's spy agency, supported Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami -- an Islamic fundamentalist terrorist/militant organization -- forming a new political party.

Hoagland quoted people skeptical about an anti-corruption campaign in Kazakhstan. He referred to a political analyst who \\"sees the recent convictions more as a sign of intra-elite warfare than evidence of a concerted anti-corruption effort\\" and a \\"civil society activist\\" who \\"describes the discredited officials as 'the weak links in the chain' and believes that the 'real sharks' are continuing to operate with impunity.\\" Hoagland commented, \\"Corruption is endemic among Kazakhstani officialdom, as it is across the CIS. Blessed with strong tax revenues, government salaries are high in Kazakhstan compared to its neighbors -- for example, Prime Minister Masimov's salary is over $50,000 a year -- but most senior officials live lifestyles that require much higher incomes. In many instances, they receive profits from businesses registered in the names of their spouses or other relatives. In other cases, they're stealing directly from the public trough.

(c. 1505 – 1580), was a Spanish Dominican missionary and the second Catholic bishop of the Diocese of Cuzco, Peru (1544–1562). (in Latin) Biography Solano was born in about 1504 in Archidona, a town in the Province of Málaga. He studied at the Colegio de San Esteban of the University of Salamanca. It was there that he decided to enter the Dominican Order. He began his novitiate in the last months of 1524, and made his final profession on 24 December 1525. Solano then served in various positions before becoming prior of the Monastery of Santo Domingo in Peñafiel. In September 1543, Solano was nominated as the second Bishop of Cuzco by Emperor Charles V. Without waiting for papal confirmation and still not consecrated to the episcopacy, Solano took the opportunity to embark to Peru with the Viceroy Blasco Núñez Vela. They left Sanlúcar de Barrameda on November 3, 1543 and arrived at Nombre de Dios in modern Panama on January 10 of the following year. On January 24, 1544, Solano set sail from Panama, landing at Tumbes, Peru, on March 4 and continuing the journey by land to Lima. Due to the rebellion of Gonzalo Pizarro, Solano was unable to enter Cusco and take possession of his see. Instead, he joined the royal army. He was first able to enter Cusco on 3 November 1545, and was finally consecrated as bishop on October 24, 1546 by his fellow Dominican friar, Jerónimo de Loayza, the newly elevated Archbishop of Lima. He was, however, forced out of the city after the Battle of Huarina in 1547. Because of his loyalty to the king, Solano roused the ire of the rebel Francisco de Carvajal, who commented that he, \\"having sat in his church and prayed for peace among Christians, walked around the camp like a field marshal\\". After the defeat at Huarina, Solano joined the forces of Pedro de la Gasca. He was present at the Battle of Jaquijahuana, which decisively ended the uprising in favor of the royalist Viceroyalty of Peru. As bishop, Solano was an eager defender of the rights of the native Peruvians. He obtained money from the Spanish conquistadores from the booty they had gained in their victory with the purpose of relieving the suffering of the native population, with which he built the Hospital de San Lázaro. This hospital, finished in 1552, was the first of its kind in Peru. His episcopacy also saw the laying of the foundation of the current Cathedral of Cusco. He was the principal consecrator of García Díaz Arias, the first Bishop of Quito (1547); and the principal co-consecrator of Martín de Calatayud, the third Bishop of Santa Marta (1547).Catholic Hierarchy: \\"Bishop Juan Solano, O.P.\\" retrieved January 21, 2016 Solano returned to Spain in October 1560, seeking support in his efforts to curb the behavior of the conquerors as well as the division of his diocese, which he considered too large for a single bishop. Having failed in Spain, he traveled to Rome, hoping to interest Pope Pius IV in his cause. Once again he failed and resigned as bishop in 1562. Solano retired to the Dominican convent of Santa Maria sopra Minerva in Rome. In his later days he was instrumental in transforming the convent's studium on the model of the College of St. Gregory at Valladolid in his native SpainCarlo Longo O.P., La formazione integrale domenicana al servizio della Chiesa e della società, Edizioni Studio Domenicano, 1996, \\"J.

The Philippine Football Federation (PFF) is the governing body of international football in the country. Football is a popular sport in the Philippines, although it is not as popular as basketball, which is the most popular sport in the Philippines. However, football has a long history in the archipelago, dating back to more than 100 years ago when Paulino Alcántara Riestra became the first Filipino and Asian player to play for a European club. He made his debut as a striker at the age of 15 at Barcelona, which made him the club's youngest and second highest goalscorer behind Lionel Messi. Since then, the first football teams began to form, including the Manila Sporting Club in 1906, the Sandow Athletic Club in 1909, and the Bohemian Sporting Club in 1910. To promote and revive the sport, some international and local football clubs helped the Philippines. FIFA also assisted the country by building and upgrading facilities including the creation of the PFF headquarters in 2009. As well, the establishment of the United Football League (UFL) and the National Men's Club Championship to provide more local competitions. The Philippines national football team is the representative of men's international football for the Philippines. They won the Far Eastern Games once (in 1913) and became a two-time Philippine Peace Cup champion (in 2012 and 2013). The Philippines women's national football team, representing women's international football in the Philippines, achieved a third-place (bronze) finish at the 1985 Southeast Asian Games. There are many stadiums that can be found in the Philippines like the Rizal Memorial Stadium in Manila which is the national stadium of the country. It is also the home stadium of the Philippine football team. Meanwhile, the Panaad Stadium in Bacolod is the secondary venue for the Philippines. History =Introduction= Paulino Alcántara, one of FC Barcelona's all-time top- scorers Around 1895, football was introduced in the Philippines by English sportsmen. In addition, some Filipinos sent to college in Hong Kong and China returned home and taught their friends a little bit about the game of football. Within a year, there were two or three football clubs established in Manila. In 1898, the U.S. Navy battleship Maine was anchored in Havana harbor to protect the Americans from a riot between Cuba and Spanish officers, and after the ship sank resulting in significant casualties, the Americans declared war against Spain, beginning the Spanish–American War. They damaged every ship in Manila Bay. This ended Spanish colonization of the Philippines, and replaced the colonizing Spaniards with Americans. When the war broke out, those football teams disbanded and abandoned the city, either to save themselves and their families from the bombardment they expected at any moment, or to cast their lot with the Filipino troops outside the city limits. After the war when peace reigned again, six football teams were formed, among them the Manila Sporting Club, the Paris Club, and the Manila Jockey Club. In 1906, the Sandow football team was established (further developed as Sandow Athletic Club in 1909). On 15 October 1907, the first official football match was held in Manila, with the celebration of the opening of the Philippine Assembly. The trophy, a silver cup donated by 27th President of the United States William Howard Taft, was won by the Sandow Athletic Club. Soon, more clubs were formed. In 1910, the Bohemian Sporting Club was organized and began to train football players. In 1920, the Circulo Social Deportivo was established and produced a football team. To further propagate the love of the sport and to regulate soccer championship contests, all football teams within the city banded themselves together and organized the Philippine Amateur Football Association in 1907 (now the Philippine Football Federation), and held its first championship in 1921 with Bohemian Sporting Club as champions. On 25 February 1912, Paulino Alcántara was the first Filipino and Asian footballer to play for a European club. Alcántara made his debut for Barcelona at the age of 15 against Català Sporting Club, where he scored his first hat- trick. Alcántara remains the youngest player to play or score for the club. He scored 369 goals in 357 matches, making him the second club's highest goalscorer (counting goals scored in both official games and friendlies) with Lionel Messi ranking first in the record. In 1917, he was selected by the Philippines to represent the country at the Far Eastern Championship Games in Tokyo, helping them defeat Japan 15–2, which remains the largest win in Philippine international football history. Alcántara only played once for the Philippines that finished second in the tournament. He also made some appearances in other national teams, including Catalonia and Spain. In 1916, while continuing his studies in medicine, he played football for a local team, the Bohemian Sporting Club, whom he helped win two Philippine Championships in 1917 and 1918. The popularity of \\"The Beautiful Game\\" didn't even decrease when the Americans founded basketball in the Philippines in 1910 as part of the physical education curriculum in Philippine schools. Filipinos only embraced basketball en masse later in the 1950s and 1960s when the USA sent many Peace Corps volunteers to the Philippines, and part of their socialization with locals was to play basketball with them. It was only then that basketball overtook other sports like football and baseball in a very big way as many ordinary Filipinos felt an ego-boost to experience white American Peace Corps volunteers playing basketball with them as previously during the American Period, such fraternizing of whites with the locals was generally discouraged due to racist segregation. Two surveys were conducted in parts of Metro Manila in 2012—the first found that basketball is the most-watched sport at 74.4%, and football is fourth at 17.9%. In the second survey, basketball was found to be the most-played sport during leisure time at 9.6%, while association football did not make the list. =1950s-1970s= Football saw some rise in the fifties where the country saw enthusiasm for the sport built through the football teams of top educational institutions such as the Ateneo, Letran, La Salle, San Beda, University of San Carlos, University of Santo Tomas, Silliman, and the University of Visayas. The Philippine Football Association partnered with San Miguel Brewery to seek foreign assistance in developing football in the country. In the early sixties, British coaches Alan Rogers and Brian Birch were brought in and funded by San Miguel to train referees, coaches and players in the country. Due to lack of facilities, the two coaches organized a five-a-side football competition which was played in a field with the same size of a basketball court. The two were later relieved and Danny McClellan and Graham Adams were tasked train national and youth players. San Miguel through the Philippine Football Association, brought in Spanish medical students who were knowledgeable in football in 1961. Association president, Felipe Monserrat, tasked the Spaniards to garner interest in football in the country and to train local players. The composition of the Spanish quarter were Francisco Escarte, Enrique dela Mata, Claudio Sanchez and Juan Cutillas, with the former two leaving after a year. The group was followed by Peter Leaver from the United Kingdom who focused on developing school football and assisted schools such as Ateneo and La Salle. Philippine football also received promotional support from the Elizalde Company. In 1971 Juan Cutillas, selected four Spanish players and one Chinese in an effort to boost the Philippine national team. The national team joined the tournaments such as the Pestabola Merdeka, Pesta Sukan, Jakarta Anniversary Tournamentp and the President Park Tournament. The Philippines managed to cause upsets results against Thailand, Singapore and South Korea. When the Spanish players, Tomas Lozano, Mannuel Cuenca, Juan Guitierrez and Julio Roxas left the football team due to financial reasons, football in the country saw another decline and basketball gained foothold in the country. =Revival= Help from foreign countries and clubs There have been four projects accepted by the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), to build and upgrade football facilities in the Philippines. In the first project, approved in August 2000, FIFA built six technical centers on Iloilo, Laguna, Negros Occidental, Cagayan de Oro, Zamboanga, and Agusan del Sur, with a total budget of ₱ (≈€ or ≈$ ). The next project, in December 2006, constructed the headquarters of the PFF in Pasig. Its third project was to upgrade the pitch in the Rizal Memorial Stadium to an artificial turf from August to September 2012, but it was discontinued because Philippine Football Federation President Mariano Araneta said that conducting the 2012 Philippine Peace Cup in Manila would lessen the expenses of the PFF in the event. FIFA's final project was to build a technical center in Bukidnon, which includes a natural grass pitch, dormitories, changing rooms, lecture rooms and offices. A number of foreign countries and clubs have offered to help promote and popularise the sport within the country. In 2010, the German Football Association (DFB) recommended the services of former Rwanda U-17 coach Michael Weiß as coach of the \\"Azkals\\", a nickname for the national team, after Dan Palami's three-day visit in Frankfurt. The DFB gave the Philippine Football Federation a grant of € (≈₱ 31 million or ≈$ ). However, after three years as a head coach, Weiß was no longer part of the Azkals after the PFF's year-end evaluation. On 18 October 2011, officials from the Real Madrid Foundation visited the Philippines to sign an agreement with local non-governmental organizations (NGO) to open a social and sports academy for youths in Mindanao to 70 poor children with under age 14. On 15 May 2012, English club Chelsea was joined by international development manager Ian Woodroffe, and Adrian New, managing director for Asia, arrived in the country to formally launched a football school at the SM Mall of Asia. It is the third football school created by Chelsea in Asia, after two others in Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur. The school is operated by Phil Younghusband and James Younghusband, brothers and former members of Chelsea's Reserves and Youth Team. After a year, Smart Communications sponsored the soccer school through its partnership with the Younghusband Football Academy (TYFA) to visit schools throughout the Philippines in conjunction with Smart's program. Soon after its establishment, they built an artificial grass football field named as Gatorade-Chelsea Blue Pitch in Ayala Alabang. The opening ceremonies was joined with Ayala Corporation president, Fernando Zobel de Ayala, Makati mayor Jun Binay and Makati representative Monique Lagdameo last 15 January 2014. The venue has a dimension of and it is set to be the new facility for the school. Another Spanish club, Barcelona, conducted a camp in Muntinlupa named \\"Barcelona Escola Camp 2013\\". It began on 17 April and ended on 21 April 2013. Two coaches from Barcelona Escola, Joseph Moratalla and Jordi Blanco, came to the Philippines. The camp was organized by Team Socceroo. A second camp was scheduled on 18 December to 22 December 2013, held in Emperador Stadium, Taguig. Coaches from the camp shared their training, philosophy, methodology, and values with the children. After the destruction of Typhoon Haiyan in the country, FIFA gave the PFF $ 1 million to rebuild and rehabilitate damaged football facilities. Leyte Football Association President Dan Palami and other football officials are planning to construct a training center in Tacloban from the grant FIFA gave. On 3 December 2011, the Philippines faced U.S. club LA Galaxy as a part of their Asia-Pacific Tour in the Rizal Memorial Stadium, which Galaxy won 6–1. Manchester United with its sponsor, a shampoo brand Clear made a \\"multi-year partnership\\" as they will hold training camps facilitated by coaches in the sport. The Manchester United Soccer School will teach 32 amateur footballers in an \\"intense and rigorous\\" program. Tryouts were held in March 2014. Development of international and local competitions In 2008, the Filipino Premier League (FPL) was established as the top-flight competition in the Philippines. It featured eight clubs from the National Capital Region. The PFF also planned a Visayas and Mindanao FPL tournament in 2009, which never materialized. The first and only champion of the league, which was cancelled at the season's conclusion, was the Philippine Army. Shortly after the dissolution of the Filipino Premier League, the Football Alliance sought to renew the interest of Filipinos in football. The Alliance entered into discussions with the United Football Clubs Association for the possibility of establishing another top-flight football competition in the Philippines. Instead of creating a whole system and competition, the United Football Clubs Association agreed to partner with the Football Alliance in operating the United Football League (UFL), a semi-professional league. After the league's second season, AKTV became its official TV broadcaster with the signing of a ₱ 150 million (~$3.3 million or ~€2.5 million), five-year deal, which ensures the airing of two live matches every week. The deal was further improved with a new TV arrangement in which four live matches would be aired every week on primetime television on AksyonTV. On April 21, 2017, the Philippines Football League (PFL) was launched as the first professional football league and the highest level of men's club football in the country. The league is sanctioned by the Philippine Football Federation, and replaced the United Football League which was previously the de facto top-tier league. Unlike the UFL, teams joining the PFL will be representing cities and provinces, as well as, have their own certified home stadiums and youth teams. Six of the eight teams joining the inaugural season came from the UFL, namely Ceres–Negros, Global Cebu, JPV Marikina, Kaya FC–Makati, Loyola Meralco Sparks, and Stallion Laguna. Two new teams Davao Aguilas, and Ilocos United were formed to join the new league. The Philippine Football Federation has not been able to organize a national tournament since 2007, when they staged the PFF Centennial Men's Open Championship due to \\"variety of reasons\\". In January 2011, Smart Communications approached the PFF with an offer to finance a new local football cup competition, the PFF National Men's Club Championship. The proposed partnership was set to last 10 years, with Smart releasing ₱ 80 million in funds with the aim of providing more playing opportunities for football players, and the eventual creation of a national cup. In March 2011, the first season of the cup began. Since 2012, the Chinese Taipei Football Association (CTFA) requested if the PFF can host the third staging of the Long Teng Cup in the Philippines. It was then accepted, the Philippines which has been a regular participant since its inception in 2010, renamed the tournament the Paulino Alcántara Cup, then renamed it once again to the Paulino Alcántara Peace Cup. The tournament was eventually renamed the Philippine Peace Cup because the Philippine Sports Commission, which operates the Rizal Memorial Stadium where the tournament was held, has a rule against events named after an individual. The tournament takes place in September to celebrate Peace Month in the Philippines. National team performance The national men's team at the 2019 Asian Cup. The inaugural season of the Far Eastern Games (FEG) in 1913 was the first championship held in Manila. The tournament provided the first matches in international football for all three nations, including the Republic of China and Japan. In the same season, the Philippines clinched their first championship title in international soccer when they defeated China 2-1. They also competed in 1915 in Shanghai, where the Chinese grabbed their first FEG title against the Filipinos. The Philippine team has competed in every Far Eastern Games, but has not yet won another tournament since 1913. In 1938, the FEG was cancelled due to the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War. The Philippine team competed in the Asian Games numerous times, making their debut in 1954 when the Philippines hosted the tournament. The Filipinos were in Group A with South Vietnam and Chinese Taipei. All games was held in Rizal Memorial Stadium. Their matches were both losses, resulting in early elimination. They returned in 1958 in Tokyo, this time competing in Group C. The Azkals recorded their first win at the games over Japan, but eventually lost to Hong Kong. In 1962, the Asian Games were held in Jakarta. Chinese Taipei and Israel were excluded in the tournament when the Indonesian government refused to issue visas for the Israeli and Taiwanese delegations. Meanwhile, Burma withdrew from competition. The Philippine team finished last in the standings, behind South Vietnam, Indonesia, and Malaya. The team finished last again in 1974 after losing every game. Beginning in 2002, an age division of under-23 was approved for men, which is the same as in football competitions in the Olympic Games. The Philippines U-23 has never yet made an appearance at the Asian Games since 2002. The Philippine team has participated in minor tournaments such as the Merdeka Tournament in 1962, 1971 and 1972, where each was finished in the group stages. The Philippine team is yet to qualify at the AFC Asian Cup. They have played at the AFC Challenge Cup, which serves as a qualifier for the Asian Cup. They have made two appearances, in 2006 and 2012. The 2006 AFC Challenge Cup was the opening season of the competition, held in Bangladesh. The Philippines advanced automatically because there was no qualification stages. After competing in Group A, they concluded the standings with a loss over Chinese Taipei and two draws with India and Afghanistan. However, in the second season, they did not advance because of their performance at the qualification phase, finishing short at second place only by goal difference. Their first match was a victory over Brunei, followed by a goalless draw from Tajikistan and a 3-0 win against Bhutan. The conclusion was the same in the 2010 qualification stage, where they ended their campaign by finishing third. The Philippine national team's campaign at the 2010 AFF Championship under head coach Simon McMenemy was seen as a success and played an important role in football in the country. The national team along with Laos had to qualify for the tournament. The Philippines advanced from the group stage for the first time in the history of the tournament. They did not concede a single defeat and their win against defending champions Vietnam in the group stage in particular was considered as one of the biggest upsets in the history of the tournament. The match, which would later be referred by local Filipino fans as the \\"Miracle of Hanoi\\", is also considered as the match that started a football renaissance in the country where basketball is the more popular sport. In the knockout stage, they had to play both their designated home and away games against Indonesia in Jakarta due to the unavailability of a stadium that passes AFF standards. The Philippines lost both games to end their campaign. The following year, the Michael Weiß became the Philippines head coach. The Philippines has not made an appearance in the World Cup. However, the national team managed to qualify for the 2012 edition of the AFC Challenge Cup, the first time since qualifiers were introduced and also recorded their first ever victory in the FIFA World Cup qualification, beating Sri Lanka 4–0 in the second leg of the first preliminary round. Kuwait finished the Philippines' World Cup qualification campaign after winning over them twice in the second round. The Filipinos grabbed their best finish in the cup when they were ranked third in the 2012 edition, with a loss from Turkmenistan in the semi-finals, and a victory against Palestine in the third place playoff. In the national team's 2013 season, they capped off the year by finishing 127th in the FIFA World Rankings as their new all-time high. The Philippines won two minor competitions, both in the Philippine Peace Cup. Since winning the 2012 Peace Cup, for the first time in 99 years, the national team earned their first international title after winning all of their games. Also in 2013, they retained the title after a win over Pakistan. In late 2016 the Philippines jointly hosted the group stage of the 2016 AFF Championship with Myanmar though they fail to progress from the group stage like they did in the past three editions. Though the national team failed to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia, they secured qualification for 2019 AFC Asian Cup after defeating Tajikistan, 2–1 at home in their final qualifier match. United Football League In the 2014 season, the United Football League is divided into two divisions, with nine teams in Division I and 12 teams in Division II. The 2009 UFL Cup was created to determine the composition of teams that will be playing in the league. However, new teams that did not participate in the 2009 UFL Cup will automatically join Division II. Division I clubs will face their opponents three times (formerly twice) for league play, which it will run a month longer than the previous year's league. Meanwhile, the rule will not apply for Division II teams, as they retain the double round robin format. After the home and away fixtures are concluded, a league table will be used to determine which teams will be champions, relegated, or promoted. When a club places first in the standings in Division I, they will become champions. However, if they rank first in the standings in Division II, they will be the winners and will receive promotion to Division I. If the team places last in the table in Division I, they will be automatically relegated to Division II. Every season, the UFL regularly organizes a promotion-relegation playoff match, in which the second rank team in Division II and the eighth-placed team in Division I will face off in a two legged match. The winning team will be determined by an aggregate score. If the Division I team wins the series, they will retain their place in Division I. If the Division II team wins, they will receive a promotion to Division I and the losing team will be relegated. In October 2016, it was reported that the 2016 season will be last UFL season to give way to the upcoming Philippines Football League (PFL) that is slated to begin in 2017. =Qualification for men's Asian competitions= In the AFC President's Cup, the winner of the PFF National Men's Club Championship will qualify to participate in the competition. In the 2013 AFC President's Cup, Global qualified because they were the champions of the 2012 United Football League, but all teams in the league were from the National Capital Region Football Association. The PFF decided that the National Men's Club Championship will serve as the qualifiers for the Philippines' club representative to the 2014 President's Cup. National teams The Philippine national men's football team represents the Philippines in men's international football. The national team is referred to as the \\"Azkals\\" - a word that is similar to Filipino term Askal meaning street dog. In addition, there are other youth national teams that represent the country in other competitions such as the Philippines national under-23 football team, also known as the Philippine Olympic team, the Philippines national under-19 football team, and the Philippines national under-17 football team. The Philippines national futsal team represents men's international futsal, and the Philippines national beach soccer team in men's international beach soccer. The women's team, also known as the \\"Malditas,\\" represents the country in women's international football and is eligible to qualify for the Olympics. The Malditas captured a third-place (bronze) finish in the 1985 Southeast Asian Games and has competed in the AFC Women's Asian Cup. Stadiums :For a list of football stadiums in the Philippines with Wikipedia articles, see :Football venues in the Philippines, and List of football stadiums in the Philippines. The Rizal Memorial Stadium in Manila is the national stadium of the Philippines, as well as the home venue of the national team. It has served as the main stadium of the 1954 Asian Games and a former venue for the United Football League. Established in 1934, the stadium has a capacity of 12,873. Another stadium, Panaad Stadium in Bacolod, is an alternative home stadium for the Philippines with 20,000 seats. The Emperador Stadium in Taguig, the main stadium of the UFL, has an all-weather football pitch made of artificial turf, developed by real estate developer Megaworld Corporation and constructed by All Asia Structures, Inc. The University of Makati Stadium, another former UFL venue, is the first football stadium built by a local university, and has a capacity of 4,000. Iloilo Sports Complex is the host of home matches from Iloilo F.A.. It hosted an international competition in the group stages of the 2013 AFC President's Cup. In 2014, the Philippine Sports Stadium was opened in Bulacan, which is also the largest stadium in term of capacity in the Philippines.

She is widely known for having a prosthetic tail. Winter is the subject of the book Dolphin Tale, and the 2011 film of the same name. Winter was found in the coastal waters of Florida on December 10, 2005. She was caught in a crab trap, which resulted in the loss of her tail. Winter was then taken to the Clearwater Marine Aquarium, where she has been housed for 14 years. The loss of her tail caused Winter to swim unnaturally, with her tail moving side to side instead of up and down. As a result, Winter was fitted with a silicone and plastic tail that enabled her to swim normally. Winter has become a highly popular attraction at the aquarium. She lives in her pool with two other dolphins, Hope and P.J., the former of which is the subject of Dolphin Tale 2.  Injury and discovery  Winter was found in the ropes of a crab trap on December 10, 2005, in Mosquito Lagoon of the coastal waters of Florida. At the time of her rescue, she was estimated to be around two months old. Winter received her name because she was found in December, traditionally considered a winter month; even though the exact date of her rescue falls within the American definition of autumn. The rope in which Winter was entangled cut off the supply of blood to her tail, causing it to naturally detach from her body. She was spotted and caught by a small fishing boat and the Hubbs-SeaWorld Research Institute stranding team (with assistance from the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute), who brought her to the Clearwater Marine Aquarium.  Prosthetic tail  Irish prosthetist Kevin Carroll and a team of experts took a year and a half designing and testing a tail for Winter, eventually settling on a simple silicone and plastic tail in 2007. A gel-like sleeve was used under the tail, in order to prevent it from irritating Winter's skin. In Winter's case, however, both the flukes and the caudal peduncle had been severed, making the task much more difficult. Lessons learned from treating Winter have also been applied to human amputees. Carroll used the same gel sleeve concept to ease painful prosthetic limbs for United States Air Force Senior Airman Brian Kolfage, who lost both legs and his right hand in a 2004 mortar attack in Iraq.  Criticism  Dr. Naomi Rose, the senior scientist for the Animal Welfare Institute, has argued that the aquarium is unfit to house dolphins for long periods of time. She also asserts that Winter's quality of life is extremely poor, to the point that she would be better off euthanized. After personally observing the dolphin, Rose commented that Winter does not wear her prosthetic for long periods of time due to discomfort, and that she exhibits concerning behaviors such as logging in one place for extended periods of time. Rose proposed that the aquarium's purpose shifted from rescue to pure display and that Winter was suffering to serve as an inspirational symbol for people with disabilities. Dana Zucker, the former Chief Operating Officer at the aquarium, said that they were initially “doing some good things” for Winter, but that she was “not seeing those things happen now.\\" In popular culture Winter has become the most popular attraction at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium. She is viewed as an inspiration to children and adults with medical conditions and disabilities. Brock Mealer (brother of Michigan Wolverines player Eliot Mealer), who was paralyzed in a car accident, met Winter in December 2010. The event attracted significant press coverage. Books and Nintendo games have been published about Winter. In 2009, Winter's story was told by Craig Hatkoff in a children’s book titled Winter’s Tail: How One Little Dolphin Learned to Swim Again. The book was published by Turtle Pond Publications and Scholastic. Hatkoff's short book was adapted into an interactive storybook on the Nintendo DS, under the same title. A film based on Winter's story, titled Dolphin Tale, was released September 23, 2011. The film's main protagonist is a young boy who is played by Nathan Gamble. It also stars Harry Connick, Jr., Ashley Judd, Morgan Freeman, Kris Kristofferson, Kurt Yaeger, and Cozi Zuehlsdorff. Winter portrayed herself in the film. Several modifications were made to the Clearwater Marine Aquarium to accommodate her, including a new 80,000-gallon pool. The film was shot at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium, and other locations in Pinellas County, Florida. A sequel, Dolphin Tale 2, was released in theaters on September 12, 2014. The movie focuses on Hope, the dolphin who now lives with Winter.

He was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council between 1852 and 1856. He was also a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for two periods between 1856 and 1857 and again between 1861 and 1864. Early life Holroyd was the son of a London merchant. He was initially educated at Ripon Grammar School and then took medical degrees at the University of Edinburgh and Christ's College, Cambridge. After practicing as a physician in London for a short period he entered Lincoln's Inn and was called to the bar. While studying law he traveled extensively in the Middle East, became proficient in Arabic and was the first Englishman to visit Kurdufan. He exposed the continuing horrors of the slave-trade in Sudan. Holroyd emigrated to the antipodes in 1843 and commenced practice as a solicitor and barrister. Holroyd was a master in equity of the New South Wales Supreme Court between 1866 and 1881 and an acting justice in 1879. While on the bench, he was accused of displaying \\"extraordinary behaviour\\" but this was considered to be a product of his short temper rather than evidence of misconduct. Holroyd was an alderman and the first mayor of Prospect and Sherwood Municipal Council (subsequently called Holroyd City Council), a leading Freemason and a trustee of Sydney Grammar School and St. Paul's College, Sydney. He developed a large property called \\"Sherwood Scrubs\\" in the area. The former local government area of Holroyd City Council and the suburb therein also called Holroyd, were named in his honor in 1927. His property there \\"Merrylands\\" also gives its name to the suburb of that name. Colonial Parliament In 1851, prior to the establishment of responsible self- government, Holroyd was elected to the semi-elective Legislative Council. He represented the electorate of Western Boroughs (including Bathurst and Carcoar) until the granting of responsible self-government in 1856. Subsequently, at the first election under the new constitution he was elected to the Legislative Assembly as the member for the same seat. He was defeated by 6 votes at the next election in 1858. Holroyd re-entered parliament as one of the two members for Parramatta at an 1861 by-election caused by the resignation of James Byrnes. However, Byrnes defeated him at the subsequent general election. He then retired from political life. Government Holroyd was the Secretary for Public Works in the first government of James Martin. He held this position for 15 months but resigned after being accused by William Arnold of accepting a bribe to appoint an associate to the bench of magistrates. A parliamentary commission found no truth in this accusation.

History The route was originally designated as FM 473 on July 9, 1945, as a short route connecting US 87 in Comfort to Nichols Ranch 4.7 miles to the east. This route was extended several times: to 4.7 miles east of Nichols Ranch on February 25, 1949, to Sisterdale on July 14 of that year, to RM 474 on December 18, 1951, and to US 281 on December 17, 1952 (replacing FM 1622).

(A) grasshopper, (B) honey bee, (C) butterfly (D) mosquito. Bembix rostrata female using its labrum in sucking the blood out of a fly. The labrum is a flap-like structure that lies immediately in front of the mouth in almost all extant Euarthropoda. The most conspicuous exceptions are the Pycnogonida, which probably are chelicerate-relatives. In entomology, the labrum amounts to the \\"upper lip\\" of an insect mouth, the corresponding \\"lower lip\\" being the labium. The evolutionary origin, embryogenesis and morphological development of the labrum have proved to be by far the most controversial and challenging topic in the study of arthropod head structures. Embryonic nature and origin of the labrum The labrum is innervated in crustaceans and insects from the tritocerebrum (the back of the brain). However, in development, its embryonic primordium often appears at the anterior of the head and migrates backwards towards its adult position. Furthermore, it often appears as a bilobed structure, with a set of muscles, nerves and gene expression in many ways similar to that of an appendage. This evidence has been used to suggest that the labrum is in fact a highly reduced appendage. Its tritocerebral innervation from the rear of the brain has suggested to some workers that, if an appendage, it is the appendage of the segment anterior to the first antenna, but this is disputed by others who argue that the presence of a well- developed appendage in at least crustaceans in this segment (the second antenna, corresponding to the intercalary segment of insects) rules this out. The most obvious choice for this is the segment whose ganglion is the protocerebrum, which in extant Euarthropoda bears no appendage (apart from the eyes). If the labrum really is an anterior appendage that has migrated to the posterior, then it may be homologous to the \\"antennae\\" of onychophorans which seem to be innervated from a very anterior part of the brain, in front of the eyes. It has even been suggested that the labrum belongs to an even more obscure segment that lies in front of the ocular one.Roonwal Nevertheless, many workers continue to be highly skeptical about the appendiculate nature of the labrum, preferring to see it as it appears, i.e. as an outgrowth of the body wall just in front of the mouth. Most subsequent work in the first decade of the 21st century has tended to increase support for the impression that the labrum is indeed appendiculate in origin. Evidence of varied origin and nature, though not qualitatively uniform in all Arthropoda, shows a trend in favour of such interpretations. For example, there has been progress on lines that increasingly suggest similarities between the networks of regulatory genes in the embryogenesis of the labrum and of segmental appendages of the trunk. There do remain difficulties however; the labrum develops in median tissues rather than the lateral sources expected of paired appendages and is part of an anterior nonsegmental tissue. It accordingly has been suggested that the now common genetic network evolved in either the labrum structure or in the trunk appendages and in either case, subsequently was redeployed elsewhere to form the other structure. Another line of evidence arose from a study of the external morphology during the embryogenesis of members of the Mecoptera, an order regarded as resembling the common ancestors of the Endopterygota. It too suggests that the labrum derives from paired appendages.

He was born into a wealthy family of merchants and landowners in San Luis Province. In 1803 he became a lieutenant in a volunteer regiment of the provincial cavalry. In 1806 he marched to Buenos Aires under the command of the viceroy Rafael de Sobremonte to fight against the British invasion. Though he arrived too late to join in the reconquest of the city, he aided in the defense of the city the following year.Vicente Cutolo, Nuevo diccionario biográfico argentino, 7 volúmenes, Ed. Elche, Bs. As., 1968-1985. In 1810 he participated in the provincial militia in support of the Revolution of May. He commanded a contingent of 225 San Luis soldiers, who joined with the Army of the North. He participated in the battles of Tucumán, Salta, and Vilcapugio. He was apparently wounded in the latter, because he did not figure in any of the later activities of the Army of the North, and returned to San Luis. Later he joined the Army of the Andes, but took no part in the famous Chilean campaign, as he was committed to the defense of the border against the Ranquel. In 1819 he helped to put down a royalist mutiny among the officer corps. For many years Videla remained posted to the border. He was involved in a notable incident in 1822 in which he repelled an invasion, and the following year he advanced into the \\"desert\\" of the interior in order to collect intelligence on the military capabilities of the Ranquel and Pehuenche people. He took part in the Unitarian Revolution of 1829, and upon its failure he retreated to Córdoba Province under the protection of Colonel Juan Gualberto Echeverría. The following year, after participating in the Battle of Oncativo, he returned to his native province in order to support the governments of his brothers Ignacio and Luis. Early in 1831 he fought against Facundo Quiroga in the Battle of Río Quinto under the command of Colonel Juan Pascual Pringles.Antonio Zinny, Historia de los gobernadores de las Provincias Argentinas, Ed, Hyspamérica, 1987. He withdrew his forces to Mendoza Province, where he joined up with the army of José Videla Castillo, who confronted Quiroga in the Battle of Rodeo de Chacón. After the battle Videla fled south and was taken prisoner. Other prisoners alleged that he had attempted to gain his freedom by betraying his comrades to the Federales. Whatever the truth of these accusations, he remained imprisoned. A few weeks later, in the middle of March, Quiroga learned of the assassination of his friend José Benito Villafañe, who had been returning to Chile, and decided to exact vengeance: he ordered the execution of 26 officials, almost all of whom were prisoners taken at Río Quinto or Rodeo de Chacón. Among these was Blas Videla. He died in Mendoza. Blas Videla is today best known as the great- great-grandfather of Jorge Rafael Videla, the dictator of Argentina between 1976 and 1981.Materiales del informe \\"Nunca más\\"  References   Bibliography  * Núñez, Urbano J., Historia de San Luis, Ed, Plus Ultra, Bs.

Environmentally, it serves to reduce air temperatures in the city, and also forms a basin which prevents floods at times of high-rainfall. Economically, it is extremely important for the city, generating a large annual income from tourism. The ecological reserve is currently under threat from a government proposal to build a viaduct that will cut into the reserve, resulting in large loss of local flora and fauna. The proposal has drawn widespread criticism from critics, including architects, university professors, environmental groups and various non-governmental organisations. History The first moves to protect the ecosystems of the Cocó river were in March 1977 when the park was declared a public good. On 5 September 1989 a state decree created the “ecological park of Cocó” which was later expanded in 1993 to occupy an area of , making it one of the largest urban parks in South America. Social importance for the city The park of Cocó has been cited as an important part of the solution to many of Fortaleza’s most chronic social, health and environmental issues. One study cited, by the University of Delaware,http://ag.udel.edu/udbg/sl/humanwellness/Human_Benefits.pdf shows that easy access to parks can reduce obesity and diabetes through opportunities for exercise. Another study in Chicago showed that vegetated spaces also cut crime by half.http://ag.udel.edu/udbg/sl/humanwellness/Human_Benefits.pdf Environmental importance Vegetated areas such as Cocó also provide relief from the “heat island effect” caused by the heat-trapping quality of asphalt, concrete, and building materials. Air under a tree’s canopy can be as much as 5–10 °F cooler compared to full sun, with the underlying pavement up to 36 °F cooler.http://ag.udel.edu/udbg/sl/humanwellness/Human_Benefits.pdf The park is also an area of protection for the extremely important and globally threatened Mangrove ecosystem,http://www.fortaleza.ce.gov.br/turismo/parque-do-coco which includes various threatened and endemic species of plant and wildlife, of extremely high importance for urban research on these species. Importance for the economy and tourism As one of the biggest urban parks in South America, Cocó represents one of the main opportunities for tourists to experience the beautiful local flora and fauna, while still remaining accessible from other tourism hotspots in the city, such as Beira Mar. According to Lonely Planet: “It's Fortaleza's most popular recreational park, and organizes activities to promote environmental awareness in its visitors\\" http://www.lonelyplanet.com/brazil/the- northeast/fortaleza/sights/outdoors/parque-ecologico-coco From Lonely Planet's Website: \\"A boat tour along the Río Côco offers tourists and nature-lovers an opportunity to fully appreciate the park's wildlife and unique flora. Visitors can also walk along the park’s various nature trails to get a closer look at the park’s ecological biodiversity\\".http://www.lonelyplanet.com/brazil/the- northeast/fortaleza/sights/outdoors/parque-ecologico-coco Importance for education and culture The park also represents an extremely important resource for education within the city,http://www.fortaleza.ce.gov.br/turismo/parque-do-coco offering a space for many educational activities, and giving the city’s children access to nature which would be otherwise impossible. The park also contains football pitches where local adults and children organise games every weekend, including tournaments. The park is also host to various cultural attractions, including an amphitheatre which offers concerts and various other cultural events.http://www.fortaleza.ce.gov.br/turismo/parque-do-coco Threat of degradation The Ecological Reserve of Coc has been gradually and constantly encroached upon by various development projects, which have drawn criticism for lack of transparency and negative environmental impacts. Such projects include the “Iguatemi” shopping centre, and a road which cuts through the park. The latest project which will encroach on the ecological reserve, which has attracted widespread criticism, proposes the development of a viaduct which will cut into the ecological reserve. Within the proposition is a re- planting program in which exotic species of trees will be introduced into the local ecosystem to compensate for the local species that will be cut down to clear the viaduct's path. Critics, including architects, university professors, environmental groups and various non-governmental organisations, cite the lack of transparency and due process in the conception of the project, and the damage which will be caused to the unique nature of the park. The viaduct, according to these groups, judging from similar projects,http://www.opovo.com.br/app/opovo/opiniao/2013/08/28/noticiasjornalopiniao,3118715/viadutos- e-o-parque-do-coco.shtml will make the city more unpleasant, result in increases in crime in the area, and result in a decrease in local commercial and cultural activity in the area, as well as ecological degradation.http://www.opovo.com.br/app/opovo/opiniao/2013/08/28/noticiasjornalopiniao,3118715/viadutos- e-o-parque-do-coco.shtml Those who own property in the area, according to Paulo Angelim, president of the real estate sectoral chamber of the state of Cear, can expect a 20% decrease in its value.http://www.opovo.com.br/app/colunas/opovoeconomia/2013/08/28/notopovoeconomia,3118641/espanhois- na-briga-pelo-mercado-de-infraestrutura.shtml Various alternative projects have been proposed in order to resolve the city’s transport problems, which involve, among other things, increasing investment in public transport and cycle-lanes, and thus reducing the need for people to rely on private cars, which currently result in chronic traffic problems and greatly increased pollution which result in a decrease of the quality of life of the city’s residents.
