SLHs serve as a transitional environment between such programs and mainstream society. Many SLHs also accept people who are in recovery from substance abuse but have not recently completed a rehabilitation program. Description Sober living houses (SLHs) are \\"alcohol- and drug-free living environments for individuals attempting to maintain abstinence from alcohol and drugs\\". They are typically structured around 12-step programs or other recovery methodologies. Residents are often required to take drug tests and demonstrate efforts toward long-term recovery. Most SLHs serve only one gender. SLHs catering solely to young people are known as Sober Colleges. Some SLHs offer intensive outpatient services, including on-site medical care. These homes are often staffed in shifts by psychiatric nurses and licensed clinical social workers, who provide residents with 24-hour supervision and centralized recovery care. SLHs may be certified or governed by Sober Living Coalitions or Networks. However, \\"because there is no formal monitoring of SLHs that are not affiliated with associations or coalitions, it is impossible to provide an exact number of SLHs.\\" Sober living is seen in greater detail in Sober House, a spin-off of Celebrity Rehab, which documents alumni of Celebrity Rehab as they enter such facilities. VH1, which airs both shows, describes sober living thus: > A sober living house is an interim step on the path to sobriety where people > recovering from addiction can live in a supervised and sober environment > with structure and rules, i.e. mandatory curfews, chores and therapeutic > meetings. This can, however, invite corruption when certain people who have > never had a position of authority before decide to play God. In this show, > celebrity addicts, most of whom have spent the better part of their lives in > the throes of addiction, will learn how to essentially start their lives > over from the ground up. In many cases, successfully maintaining sobriety > requires patients to alter everything about their previous lives when they > were actively addicted to alcohol and other drugs. This could include > changing jobs, eliminating friends and even abandoning loved ones who are > deemed toxic to their sobriety.\\"Sober House 2 With Dr. Drew - Peep the Cast\\" > vh1.com, February 25, 2010 In some areas, sober homes have been linked to fraudulent insurance scams. This has prompted the proposal of bills that would regulate advertising and require registration for new homes. Resident requirements Each individual SLH will have different requirements for the residents, but many will have these typical requirements: # No drugs, alcohol, violence, or overnight guests # Active participation in recovery meetings # Random drug and alcohol tests # On-time guest fee payments # Involvement in either work, school, or an outpatient program # General acceptance by peer group at the SLH Results SLHs have been shown to improve recovery outcomes when utilized in conjunction with 12-step programs. Residences providing a highly structured schedule of activities tend to dramatically improve the likelihood of long-term sobriety. In some cases, sober living homes will contract with licensed drug rehab centers and therapists as a means for providing an even greater level of care. These types of sober livings do tend to charge higher fees, however, they are often able to provide a very affordable alternative to what would otherwise constitute high-priced inpatient treatment.

These devices allow a signal to be distributed to multiple destinations without ground loops or signal degradation. They are used for a number of common engineering tasks, including multiple amplification, cable television, splitting monitor and front of house mixes, and \\"tapping\\" a signal prior to sending it through effects units to preserve a \\"dry\\" signal for later experimentation. Audio distribution amplifier An Audio Distribution Amplifier also known as: a press feed; a pool feed; a media feed; press box; or an ADA, takes a single audio feed, usually a line input, but it may be a microphone input, and outputs multiple line or microphone outputs. This can be done using a passive feed, where the signal is split among the outputs, or as an active feed where the outputs are amplified. The primary use of the Audio Distribution Amplifier is to share a single audio feed with multiple members of the press pool. Thus the names press feed, pool feed and media feed.Description of than early Media Pool Feed http://vvc.ca/about- us/history/#mediafeed Video distribution amplifier A Video Distribution Amplifier (also known as a distribution amp or VDA) takes a video signal as an input, amplifies it, and outputs the amplified video signal to two or more outputs. It is primarily used to supply a single video signal to multiple pieces of video equipment. It adjusts the amplitude of a video signal to compensate for loss of signal in a video distribution system. Extending the distance of the video signal is the main purpose of the VDA. There are VDAs built for all video formats, NTSC, ATSC, QAM16, QAM32, QAM64, Composite Video and Component Video. Their construction and capabilities can be simple; accept input signal, amplify, then output. Others can be more sophisticated that allow remote control from a control station, allow adjustment of the gain, equalization, and provide status of the input and output signals through Ethernet networks.

The novel details the lives of the Holbrook family, depicting their struggle to survive during the 1920s. Yonnondio explores the life of the working-class family, as well as themes of motherhood, socioeconomic order, and the pre-depression era. The novel was published as an unfinished work. Summary The novel begins in a small Wyoming mining town, where Jim Holbrook works in the coal mine. As the narrative progresses, the reader discovers that Jim drinks heavily and beats Anna and their children. Mazie follows Jim into town one evening and is nearly thrown down a mineshaft by the deranged miner, Sheen McEvoy. Mazie is saved by the night watchman, and instead McEvoy falls down the shaft to his death. Mazie immediately develops a fever, and the Holbrooks make plans to move east in the spring. Anna takes on a variety of short-term employment to financially prepare for the move. Jim is involved in a mine explosion, attributed to the carelessness of the new fire boss, and goes missing for five days. When Jim returns, it is with a firm resolve to remove his family from the town. In the spring, the Holbrooks leave the mining town, traveling across Nebraska and South Dakota, where their wagon is briefly immobilized by a storm. At their South Dakota tenant farm, the scene is pastoral and the Holbrooks are initially optimistic about the farm's prospects. For the first time, the family is healthy and well-fed, and Mazie and Will begin attending school. Mazie begins to take an interest in education and befriends the learned Old Man Caldwell next door, who passes on some books to Mazie when he dies, though Jim promptly sells them. As the winter approaches, Jim realizes that after a year of working the land, the family remains in debt. With the arrival of winter, the Holbrooks no longer have enough food. Anna becomes pregnant and ill, and after a marital dispute, Jim leaves the family, returning after ten days. After the birth of Bess in the following March, the family leaves the farm and moves to Omaha, Nebraska. They take up residence in a city slum near a slaughterhouse. The smell from the slaughterhouse makes the children ill and Anna is no longer able to control them at home. Mazie becomes dreamy and detached, fantasizing about the farm as an escape from the horrors of the city. Jim gets a job in the sewers, and he and Anna are unable to support their family. Anna suffers a miscarriage and is bedridden for several days. When she regains mobility, Anna begins taking in laundry to supplement Jim's income, though Jim explicitly disapproves. Jim gets a job at the slaughterhouse, where he earns a little more money, and he buys fireworks for the family on the Fourth of July to celebrate. When she is excluded from the celebration, Mazie becomes acutely conscious of the social and political implications of her gender. During a heat wave, Anna continues to work alone, canning fruits to feed the family through the winter, while the children run the streets and scavenge in the dump. The novel terminates in the Holbrook apartment, with Anna singing to Ben. Bess enthusiastically bangs a jar lid against the floor, and the family listens to the radio together for the first time. Characters Mazie Holbrook: Jim and Anna's eldest daughter. Although she is just six and a half years old at the beginning of the novel, she assumes many responsibilities in the house. She helps her mother start the fire, cook and care for her little brothers and sister. Her character changes as events progress in the novel, and as she becomes aware of her social position. Her own way of escaping the harsh reality is portrayed in her daydreaming and imaginary trances. She believes that stars are ‚Äúlamps in houses up there, or flowers growing in the night\\" (46). According to most critics, had the novel been completed, Mazie would have been the revolutionary character in the narrative when she grows. Anna Holbrook: Mazie's mother. She believes that education is the only way for her children to achieve upward mobility in society; she tells Mazie, ‚ÄúAn edjication [education] is what you kids are going to get. It means your hands stay white and you read books and work in an office\\" (4). The violence she experiences from her husband is in part reflected in the violent attitude she displays towards her children as she shouts at and beats them constantly. In some parts of the novel, she is an active housewife, always busy with canning food or doing laundry. However, when she gets sick due to a miscarriage, she is usually sleeping and the house and kids are left unattended to. Jim Holbrook: He is the patriarch of the Holbrook family. In his attempt to make ends meet, he moves from one job to another, first, a coal miner, next, a farmer, and finally a meat packer. He heads to the bar and gets drunk, as most other workers do, to escape from reality. The financial stress on the family is reflected on Jim's violent attitude towards his wife and kids: ‚ÄúHe had nothing but heavy blows to the children and he struck Anna too often to remember\\" (9). However, in some parts of the novel, he shows care to his sick wife and plays with his children. Will and Ben Holbrook: Mazie's younger brothers. Will is attached to Mazie in the beginning of the novel. However, as he grows a little older, he wants to be independent and to have his own friends, secret adventures and gadgets. Ben is weak in body and suffers from lung disease especially when the family moves to the smelly, unclean area next to the packing houses. Jimmie and Bess Holbrook: The youngest son and daughter in the family. Although her role is very limited in the novel, Bess closes the unfinished novel with an optimistic tone when she grabs a jar lid and bangs it enthusiastically against the floor. Major themes The Pre-Depression Era: Though this novel was written during the Great Depression, the main plot of the story takes place during the 1920s. Though the themes of the great depression are visible in the family's struggles and tribulations, as Burkom and Williams put it, Yonnondio actually represents the 1920s more realistically than The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald which shows the life of the stereotypical flappers of the time. By exploring the lives of the working class, the novel portrays a ‚Äúrealistic depiction of the squalid conditions in which the unknown of America‚Äôs working class miraculously endure.\\"Burkom and Williams 50 Had the novel been completed, it would have more precisely represented the depression era via the characters planned involvement in the proletarian movement. Motherhood: Motherhood is a central theme throughout Yonnondio because the main perspective, that of Mazie, is watching and commenting on her mother, Anna. As Deborah Rosenfelt put it, the novel focuses on: ‚Äúthe unparalleled satisfaction and fulfillment combined with the overwhelming all-consuming burden of motherhood.‚ÄùRosenfelt 79 Mazie watches Anna work tirelessly as a wife and mother, giving her health and happiness up for the benefit of her children. To accomplish her goal, Anna finds herself doing whatever is necessary (working extra jobs, finding alternative food sources, and ruining her health) no matter how extreme. To Mazie, motherhood is seen as a great sacrifice a mother gives to her children; yet, there are times when her responsibilities overlap causing the opposite effect. Due to the many chores and financial obligations of Anna, the children are often left to wander about freely without supervision, because Anna is mentally unable to care for them, putting them into danger. Nightmares: This aspect of the novel revolves around the idea of living in constant fear of not having food or enough money, not being able to escape their lives, or dying in the coal mines. The characters are in a constant state of worry and frustration which begins from the first sentence: ‚Äú[t]he whistles always woke Mazie‚Äù (1). Each day they are reminded, awoken to the sound of death from the mines: the likely fate of every male worker in the town. Mazie, as a girl, also has a close encounter of being consumed by the mine when a miner tries to throw her into a cavern. According to Bonnie Lyons: ‚Äúthe miner imagines the mine as a ravenous woman [. . .] [and] the fact that the miner sees woman as devourer rather than nurturer demonstrates the extremity of his condition, a result of the economic and social conditions in general.‚ÄùLyons 150 The characters are caught in a nightmare caused by their circumstances‚Äîleading to the next theme. Capacity vs. Circumstances: One of the major ideas of the novel is that the Holbrook family's behavior is not instinctive, but an outgrowth of their living situation: their circumstances. These include poverty, education, working conditions, patriarchy and space; that is to say, with a few changes, their lives could be greatly improved, and violence and despair would decrease. This theme also refers to the novel itself which was to have the children grow up to become activists and escapee their drudgery. Mazie, and her brother, were: ‚Äúto go west [. . .] become organizers [. . .] [and write about] the experiences of her people.‚ÄùRosenfelt 72 The circumstances of Olsen's life caused the novel to be compiled in the 1970s left in its unfinished state. Style and genre A fragmentary and experimental work that is at once feminist, modernist, and proletarian, Yonnondio provides a unique example of the synthesis of two distinct but concurrent literary traditions: the proletarian socialist-realist aesthetic advocated by the political left of the 1930s and the experimental Modernism of mass culture. Yonnondio‚Äôs unusual aesthetic represents a blending of these two discordant traditions, with the long passages of near-realism typical of the proletarian literary movement juxtaposed with intermittent, sharply contrasting interjections of poetic stream of consciousness. While Yonnondio has typically been marketed as a work of fiction, much of the narrative is derived from Olsen‚Äôs own childhood experiences, and critics have situated Olsen‚Äôs approach to writing between a process of recording and one of transforming reality, suggesting that Olsen‚Äôs fidelity to fact is better described as a fidelity to essential fact, with form and pattern never imposed, but rather, exposed.Rose 122 Allusions and references Yonnondio means lament for the lost. Lament for the aborigines . . . the word itself a dirge . . . No picture, poem, statement, passing them to the future Yonnondio! Yonnondio!‚Äîunlimn‚Äôd they disappear; To-day gives place, and faces‚Äîthe cities, farms, factories fade; A muffled sonorous sound, a wailing word is borne through the air for a moment, Then blank and gone and still, and utterly lost. From Walt Whitman‚Äôs ‚ÄúYonnondio‚Äù This is the opening quote, placed after the dedication page, of the novel. The first seven lines of Whitman's poem are removed (leaving only five lines) to direct the quote to relate to the topic of the book‚Äîto the people of America and not the original subject the aborigines. The first line is a compilation of Olsen's own words defining the original poem's intention and part of the missing first line of the original poem. The quote not only references the characters but also the novel itself‚Äîin that the end of the book was lost. Publication history Olsen was just 19 years old when she began writing Yonnondio: From the Thirties in 1932. She managed to publish a portion of the first chapter in a 1934 issue of Partisan Review under the title ‚ÄúThe Iron Throat‚Äù. However, due to her pregnancy with her second child, her political activities and employment, she set aside the drafts of the unfinished books only to find them 40 years later while searching for another manuscript. Olsen put together the numerous drafts and old papers she found in order to present this unfinished novel. She notes that although she had to make decisions as to where different scenes belonged and whether to include some drafts, she did not add to or rewrite any parts of the novel. The unfinished novel was published in 1974. The book has been published by different publishing houses including Faber and Faber (1974), Delacorte Press (1974), Dell Publishing (1979), Virago Press Ltd (1980), Delta (1988), Bantam Doubleday Dell, and University of Nebraska Press (2004). Criticism and analysis Much literary criticism has been produced about Yonnondio since its publication in 1974. Critics have focused on a large variety of issues ranging from socialist- feminist portrayals of film in the novel to a diverse spectrum of various psychological concerns.Robe 162-77 MacPherson, for instance, has looked extensively at the ways in which Olsen's characters‚Äô representations portray complicated issues of class in relation to psychological escapism.MacPherson 263-71 Other Marxist-feminist criticism has also been produced including Rosenfelt's essay ‚ÄúFrom the Thirties: Tillie Olsen and the Radical Tradition.‚ÄùRosenfelt 371-406 Rosenfelt worked directly with Olsen while writing this article and she looks at the many ways in which Olsen's biography directly relates to her works of fiction, especially Yonnondio. By comparing Yonnondio with Agnes Smedley‚Äôs Daughter of Earth, Rosenfelt reveals the ways in which female sexuality is downplayed in the novel. Rosenfelt suggests this occurs as a direct result of Olsen‚Äôs readings of communist theory, much of which was surprisingly conservative and patriarchal in its attitudes towards women in the 1930s. Rosenfelt also argues that the Holbrook children (especially Mazie) are explicitly socialized into accepting traditional, limiting views of sex and gender. Rosenfelt links the cruel behaviors of Anna (her abuse of her children) directly back to the inevitable result of living within a patriarchal, capitalist regime. Other notable criticism has been produced regarding Olsen‚Äôs representations of Jewishness in Yonnondio. Lyons has argued that, although somewhat sparsely portrayed, Olsen‚Äôs own Jewish background is uniquely represented within the characterization of Anna during her recollections of her grandmother, and also her numerous candle-lighting rituals.Lyons 144-57 Lyons links Anna‚Äôs practices with the behaviors of Eva in Olsen‚Äôs famous short story \\"Tell Me a Riddle.\\" The scholar Anthony Dawahare has notably written on the book‚Äôs \\"dialectical and utopian consciousness\\" as it relates specifically to \\"the authorial voice.\\" Dawahare's primary argument concerns the level of capitalist exploitation exhibited within the consciousnesses of the Holbrook family. He recognizes the crucial role Yonnondio plays in representing the resurrected ideals concerning certain dialectical, utopian philosophies that were increasingly being revived during the mass labor movements occurring in the U.S. during the era of the Great Depression.Dawahare 262 Thus, this article is useful for both its philosophical and its historical arguments.

Prize Bingo is a game derived from standard Bingo games which is particularly popular in UK seaside resorts. Rather than winning cash prizes as per normal bingo, Prize Bingo instead offers points to the winner of each game which can be redeemed in a dedicated shop near to or within the Prize Bingo area although some games reward players with free games or tokens. Prize Bingo is usually found in UK amusement arcades, particularly in seaside resorts such as Blackpool. Essentially, a prize bingo installation is a set of linked slot machines. According to the Gambling Commission regulations, prize bingo sessions should have the maximum stake of ¬£1 and a prize worth no more than ¬£70 - per game, no more than ¬£500 of prizes per game and no more than ¬£500 in stakes per game. Early forms of prize bingo had a 'ball machine' - this mixed up colour-coded balls with each number on and the machine would release numbers when a button was pressed, these would be announced by the caller and put aside, being returned to the 'pool' when the game had finished, usually via some kind of mechanical device. However, in the last few decades, these installations (if they are still open) have been converted to electronic operation, with most systems now being controlled by some kind of computer. This has many benefits over traditional methods, including less electromechanical equipment to service, and more importantly, the opportunity for faster games, with the winner being automatically verified by computer, rather than having to shout their numbers out for the caller to check. This article is mainly concerned with the modern electronic systems.  How to play  The game is usually played via dedicated consoles connected to a central console where the Caller sits. Players can join a game by inserting coins into the slot on their console. Every console has a different order of numbers. Numbers are generated at random and The Caller reads them out. Most UK Prize Bingo installations have 75 numbers spread out across three different cards. The standard stake (usually 20p) enables two cards to be played while an extra 10p enables the third (usually gold) card to be played as well, increasing the chance of winning. If a player has activated all three cards, they have every number on one of the cards. The aim varies depending on the individual establishment and the caller. Often, the aim is to cross off five numbers in a line on the same card diagonally, horizontally or vertically OR to cross off the four corner squares on the same card. Some games may be a certain type of line only or no corner squares. Bonus games are also played sometimes where if you create a line in a certain position, you win a special prize. If there are not many players then the caller may decide to play a full-house game instead of a line. This takes longer and thus means less payout for the operator. Often, these settings are designed to be 'foolproof' so the prize amount, bonuses and game types are automatically selected by the computer (which can be configured by the arcade managers for optimum financial gain) depending on the number of players and how many credits remain on the player's machines. The caller usually just has to literally call the numbers and press a button to advance the numbers. While the consoles are fitted with sliders for players to cover up the numbers being read, unlike most derivatives of Bingo, Prize Bingo is usually configured so that the computer detects as soon as somebody has a winning combination and ends the game automatically, without the need for any intervention from the player. If more than one player has a winning combination, the prize is shared. Some games though require the player to press a button when they have a claim and only then will the computer check it and end the game (or reject it if the player has made a mistake). As well as being announced verbally, most prize bingo establishments feature a TV monitor or several that shows the last called number and how many numbers have been called. In addition to this, the consoles often have a small LED display that shows this information when a game is in progress or the number of remaining credits when there is no game in progress. Prize bingo establishments also usually feature a 'floorwalker', whose job it is to supply change, deal with machine malfunctions and sometimes to offer hospitality, such as refreshments with the aim of encouraging customers to keep playing. Some arcades also give out 'free play' vouchers, these are nearly always only valid after a certain time - again, these are intended to get customers to return. Prizes The majority of prize bingo setups automatically release a 'token' (a round metal coin) into the player's winnings tray when they have made a valid win. The number of tokens won each time depends on how many people were playing and which card had the winning line ('Gold cards' typically pay double the wins of an ordinary card). These tokens can be collected and redeemed for prizes in the bingo hall's prize shop or put back into the machine as credits, although it is rare for them to have any monetary value. Bingo number slang As Prize Bingo is mainly played for fun unlike more serious forms of bingo, slang names for numbers are commonly used. On a Prize Bingo board, the numbers are usually colour-coded: *1 - 15: Red *16 - 30: Yellow *31 - 45: Blue *46 - 60: White *61 - 75: Green The caller usually reads out the colour then the number, i.e. \\"Red on its own number 1\\", \\"Green seven and five seventy five\\", \\"Yellow two and four, a Duck At The Door\\"  Odds of winning  With Prize Bingo, somebody is guaranteed to win every game. While some establishments will not operate Prize Bingo until a certain number of people are there, the more people are playing, the less chance you have of winning. It is a random game of luck with no skill involved, however players can increase their chances of winning by playing more cards, such as the 'gold card' available on many setups. The most common type of prize bingo operating software allows the caller to appear to 'shuffle' the numbers. Random numbers flash up on the screen. Whether this actually randomises the numbers or just encourages customers to think that they may have more luck with the 'new' numbers is unknown. Known Prize Bingo locations =United Kingdom= While prize bingo a part of the traditional British seaside holiday, the number of places it can be played is declining. It is often more profitable for amusement arcades to replace prize bingo installations with high-jackpot fruit machines. None are known to exist south of Great Yarmouth except in Dawlish, Devon. The prize bingo hall in Clarence Pier, Southsea, Hampshire has closed and so have several others. Blackpool, one of the more successful seaside resorts still has several arcades with prize bingo as does Skegness in Lincolnshire. Some of these are only open during the summer months while others are open all year. Most of the arcades in Southend on Sea once had a prize bingo area but now only one remains, a manual setup, in Happydrome at the Kursal end of the 'Golden Mile'.

The play ran briefly on Broadway in 1983. Overview The play takes place in a theatre where the main character Himself is about to speak to the assembled group about his life of celebrity as \\"The Man Who Had Three Arms\\". The other two actors of the play, The Man and The Woman, play, variously, two people who are introducing Himself, the parents and wife of Himself, and the manager of Himself. In the first act, Himself describes his transformation from a successful family man to a person who is horrified to discover that a third arm is growing from between his shoulder blades. In the second act, Himself describes being on the celebrity circuit and all that entails‚Äî‚Äúmoney, sex, adulation‚Äù‚Äîwhile he grows more and more in debt. His wife leaves him. He falls apart in front of the audience only to deal with a final surprise. The play contains harsh satire of the Catholic Church, the excesses of the culture of celebrity, and the shallowness of parent/child relationships, and involves some interaction between the lead character and the audience. It also contains quite a bit of humor and occasional vulgar language. Productions The play was commissioned for the New World Festival of the Arts in Miami, Florida. The play premiered at the Coconut Grove Playhouse, Florida, in June 1982. Directed by Albee, the cast was Robert Drivas, Patricia Kilgarriff, and William Prince.Horn, Barbara Lee. \\"' The Man Who Had Three Arms' Productions and Credits\\", Edward Albee: A Research and Production Sourcebook, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003, , pp. 51-52 The play had a tryout at the Goodman Theatre, Chicago in October 1982, with Drivas, Kilgarriff, and Wyman Pendleton.Bottoms, Stephen (ed.) \\"Chronology\\" The Cambridge Companion to Edward Albee, Cambridge University Press, 2005, , p. xx The play premiered on Broadway at the Lyceum Theatre on April 5, 1983 and closed on April 17, 1983 after 8 previews and 16 performances.

Excerpt\\" Theatre Journal, (jstor.org) Vol. 41, No. 3, Performance in Context (Oct., 1989), pp. 407-410 It was directed by Dr. Lynn Morrow and starred Edward Fernandez.Gehman, Geoff. \\"In Some Ways, 'Three Arms' Needs A Hand Theater Review\\" The Morning Call, November 19, 1988 (Mr. Albee was in residence during the production period.) Dr. Morrow then presented the production in Edinburgh, Scotland, in August 1989, where it won a \\"Fringe First\\" award. Critical response Frank Rich reviewing the production for The New York Times wrote that it \\"isn't a play - it's a temper tantrum in two acts... One of the more shocking lapses of Mr. Albee's writing is that he makes almost no attempt even to pretend that Himself is anything other than a maudlin stand-in for himself, with the disappearing arm representing an atrophied talent.\\"Rich, Frank. \\"Stage: Drama by Albee, 'Man Who Had 3 Arms'\\" New York Times, April 6, 1983, , p. C15 The Christian Science Monitor reviewer wrote: \\"The Man Who Had Three Arms could well be the bitter complaint of a playwright whose earlier great success has been followed by a wounding decline in popular and critical response. In this respect, the play is a sad spectacle. Yet it offers passages of eloquence and emotional power. Furthermore, in attacking the world, Himself has been well armed with the Albee arsenal of articulate attack weapons.\\"Beaufort, John. \\"Satiric allegory from Edward Albee; 'The Man Who Had Three Arms' Play by Edward Albee. Directed by Mr. Albee.\\" csmonitor.com, April 14, 1983 The play ran for only 16 performances - at least one of which was booed during the curtain call.

The planetarium at Harewood consisted of three linked geodesic domes designed by Amelia Y'Mech, one of which one was dedicated to the planetarium itself while the others were used as the main entrance, with a high climbing frame and a 3D theatre featuring 'A Poets Journey through Space', a locally made 3D production with poetry by Ian Macmillan, graphics by Vex films and produced by Richard Everiss. The planetarium was privately funded until it was sold to Bradford College, funded by the Regional Development Fund in April 2008.

Stars and planets were projected onto a negative pressure screen inside the dome by a Carl Zeiss ZKP4 star projector.

PT-658 is a prime example of US Navy motor torpedo boat development during World War II. PT-658 was in the last group of four boats delivered from the 36-boat contract NObs-1680, October 1944 for PT-625 to PT-660. Delivered and accepted on July 31, 1945, she was fitted with all of the latest armaments and design modifications as a result of lessons learned from previous contracts and battlefield experience. In this way, PT-658 is a showcase of the final form that motor torpedo boats would take by the end of World War II. PT-658 was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 4, 2012. Of three PT boats listed on the National Register, she is one of 2 maintained in operating condition.PT-305, at The National WWII Museum in New Orleans, has been restored to operating condition as of March 2017, but it not (yet) listed in the National Register. PT-657 is operating in a non-historical configuration as the charter fishing boat Malahini out of San Diego. Service history PT-658 was one of a group of PT boats assigned to MTB Squadron 45 in April 1945, for transfer to the USSR under Lend-Lease. By the time she was completed on July 30, 1945, this transfer had been cancelled. PT-658 was transported to Bremerton on the deck of LST-375 from New Orleans along with PT-657, PT-659, and PT-660, arriving on September 25, 1945. PT-658 was then stationed at Port Hueneme, California, where on August 27, 1946, she was reclassified as a Small Boat and renumbered C105343 to serve as a missile range patrol boat. On December 3, 1948, she was reclassified as Floating Equipment. PT-658 was then transferred to Naval Air Station Point Mugu, reclassified as RCT-13, and used for patrolling the Point Mugu missile test range for stray craft into the missile landing area, and for towing targets. Also during this period, PT-658 served twice a week as a high speed transport, carrying men and supplies to the USAF D.E.W. Radar Station on Santa Rosa Island, off the coast of Los Angeles in the Channel Island Group. PT-658s survival has been attributed to her completion late in the war, and that she was never sent overseas. On June 30, 1958, PT-658 was sold to a private individual in the Oakland and Alameda, California area and renamed Porpoise. The private owner changed very little of her structure during the time he owned her. In 1993, she was donated by the late owner's estate to the veterans of Save the PT Boat, Inc. of Portland, Oregon. PT-658 was transported from Alameda to Portland in May 1994 by the 144th Transportation Unit of the Washington National Guard on the deck of the US Army Logistics Support Vessel . Restoration A dedicated group of PT Boat veterans formed the organization Save the PT Boat, Inc., a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. The group restored PT-658 to her original 1945 configuration between 1995 and 2005. PT-658 is now fully functional and afloat, one of only two restored US Navy PT Boats that are operational today. (The second, PT-305, was the beneficiary of some leftover parts collected by the PT-658 restoration team.) PT-658s restoration includes (non-functional replicas of) a full armament of four Mark 13 Torpedoes, two twin .50 caliber Browning M2 machine guns, a 40 mm Bofors cannon, two 20 mm Oerlikon cannon, two eight-cell Mark 50 Spin Stabilized 5 inch Rocket Launchers, two Mark 6 TNT depth charges, and a 60 m M2 mortar. She has three working Packard Model 5M-2500 V12 gasoline engines. PT-658 Heritage Museum is located in Portland, Oregon at the Swan Island Industrial Park. She is moored to Pier 307 of Vigor Industrial Shipyard as of October, 2013. Visitor access is provided via the marked Gate 18 at 5555 N. Lagoon Avenue. The PT-658 Heritage Museum is open to the public every Monday, Thursday and Saturday 9am to 4pm for visitors. She has been moved into the new boathouse and the group continues to raise money for ongoing projects such as deck replacement, charthouse repair, and bottom replacement. Money is also being raised for final boathouse improvements and to build a PT-658 Heritage and Education Center. In May 2010, replacement of the deck was completed in time for various summer festivals and shows. Funding raised for additional restoration work included a $14,000 grant from the Oregon Cultural Trust, awarded in July 2010. When originally launched in 1945, PT-658 wore a camouflage paint scheme, (specifically, Camouflage Measure 31-20L) and this was restored in early 2011. In July 2011, two Mark 50 eight-cell rocket launcher mounts were added to the port and starboard bow. In May 2012, an original SOA Radar mast (obtained on loan from PT Boats Inc. of Germantown, Tennessee) was installed along with an appropriately sized radar dome, signal generator and waveguide. Simultaneously, the 40mm Bofors cannon mount was improved with the addition of an ammunition clip holder/loader handrail to the rear of the mount, along with adjustable seats and authentic aerial spider type gunsights. Further equipment additions added by the crew in 2014 include authentic IFF dipole antennae on the chart house and radar mast, and a US M2 60mm mortar on the starboard side of the bow.

As a four-year-old in 1991 he was one of the leading racehorses in North America, winning the Santa Anita Handicap, Pimlico Special, San Antonio Handicap, San Pasqual Handicap and San Carlos Handicap. He was also the winner of the 1991 American Championship Racing Series. Background Farma Way was a brown horse bred in Kentucky by Mr. & Mrs. C. D. Callaway III. He was sired by Santa Anita Derby winner Marfa out of the Diplomat Way mare, Fine Tribute, a descendant of the very important sire, Nearco. Farma Way was originally trained by Neil Boyce but was later transferred to D. Wayne Lukas. Racing career Farma Way lost his first four starts. After he ran second in the Hollywood Futurity, Boyce put him in the turf Baldwin Stakes, which was a surface change and resulted in a win. In his fourth year, the colt won the Santa Anita Handicap and set a 1 3/16 mile track record for Pimlico Race Course in winning the 1991 Pimlico Special. His time of 1:52 2/5 also equalled the North American record for 1 3/16 miles on dirt set by Riva Ridge in 1973 at Aqueduct Racetrack. As of May 2017, their record still stands. His headstrong ways, however, were his undoing and the cause of a 2-year dispute between jockey Gary Stevens and Farma Way's trainer, D. Wayne Lukas. Farma Way got into a duel with Jolie's Halo, and Stevens could not rate him, allowing Festin to win a race in which Farma Way was favored. When Lukas berated Stevens in public after the race, Stevens instructed his agent to refuse any Lukas mounts. It was two years before Stevens rode for Lukas again. Stud record Retired to Balla Vista Farm, in California, Farma Way was a successful sire. Some of his progeny include graded stakes race winners Birr, Cobra King, Dontbotherknocking, Rob N Gin, and Ruby Surprise. Farma Way had to be put down on November 18, 1999, after fracturing his hind leg in a paddock accident.

The game has drawn wide attention for its ability to simulate the development of a species on a galactic scope, using its innovation of user-guided evolution via the use of procedural generation for many of the components of the game, providing vast scope and open-ended gameplay. Spore is a god game. The player molds and guides a species across many generations, growing it from a single-celled organism into a more complex animal. Eventually, the species becomes sentient. The player then begins molding and guiding this species' society, developing it into a space-faring civilization, at which point they can explore the galaxy in a space ship. Spores main innovation is the use of procedural generation for many of the components of the game, providing vast scope and open-endedness. Wright said, \\"I didn't want to make players feel like Luke Skywalker or Frodo Baggins. I wanted them to be like George Lucas or J. R. R. Tolkien.\\" During the 2007 Technology Entertainment Design (TED) conference, Wright added that he wanted to create a \\"toy\\" for kids to inspire long-term thinking, stating, \\"I think toys can change the world.\\" History and development Net Spore history] Spore was originally a working title, suggested by Maxis developer Ocean Quigley, for the game which was first referred to by the general public as SimEverything. Even though SimEverything was a first choice name for Wright, the title Spore stuck. Wright adding it also freed him from the preconceptions another Sim title would have brought, saying \\"...Not putting 'Sim' in front of it was very refreshing to me. It feels like it wants to be breaking out into a completely different thing than what Sim was.\\" Wright was inspired by the Drake equation and the 1977 film Powers of Ten when developing Spore. Spore's development began in 2000, around the time that development began for The Sims Online. The earliest version was inspired by the SETI Project, as Wright admitted, \\"The original concept was sort of a toy galaxy you could fly around and explore.\\" Spore's design documents were published in an issue of Wired in 2004 as a layout portraying the cycle of evolution, unbeknownst to the magazine and the general public at that time. At the 2005 Game Developers Conference (GDC), Spore was first revealed and demonstrated to the public during a speech on procedural generation. It was officially unveiled two months later at E3 2005, the industry's annual trade show. GDC 2006 featured two Spore related talks, Building Community Around Pollinated Content in Spore and Spore: Preproduction Through Prototyping. A video released on YouTube shows \\"unedited footage of Spore that will be going to TV networks covering E3 2006\\", and includes an overhauled creature editor, a first look at the texturing tools, as well as glimpses at other aspects of the game. Such things were discussed on G4's Attack of the Show numerous times. Will Wright has said that the game was also influenced by many TV shows, films and toys, such as Lego and Star Wars. By E3 2007, the game's look had changed again, with major changes to the graphical style. The Sporepedia was inspired by Web 2.0. Net Spore history] At the DICE Summit, Wright playfully introduced four designers according to their design team personas, dubbing designer and senior art director Quigley as The Scientist, Chaim Gingold as The Toymaker, Jenna Chalmers as The Mastermind, Alex Hutchinson as The Cowboy, and himself as The Traffic Cop. Quigley revealed at the Summit the difficulty of making the editors (the creature and vehicle editors in particular) extremely accessible, stating it was like \\"art directing a million incompetents... [Gamers] don‚Äôt have good sense as to what makes a good character, so you have to put in all these techniques and tools, so when they do something, it looks good.\\" The New York Times reported a projected development cost of twenty million United States dollars on October 10, 2006. In April 2007, Civilization IV lead designer Soren Johnson joined Maxis to work on Spore. Soon after, some video game sites theorized that this news indicated that the release of Spore might slip to 2008. A projected 2008 release was revealed three weeks later at an EA conference call, corroborating the speculation that a significant amount of development was still left to be completed. In a GameVideos interview with Garnett Lee, Wright explained, \\"I credit him with, basically, you know, being able to present [the Civilization phase] that has that many, ah, strategic possibilities but not have it being overwhelming from a gameplay mechanic sense.\\" By July 2007, the game was a complete, fully featured alpha build undergoing closed play testing. On August 23, 2007, a closed door demonstration of a playable build was featured at Games Convention 2007 in Leipzig, Germany. At the 2008 DICE Summit, Electronic Arts CEO John Ricitiello stated, \\"It's probably the greatest creative risk maybe going on in the game industry today...I believe it's going to be one of the greatest franchises in our industry and will rival World of Warcraft or The Sims or Rock Band. It's going to be right up there.\\" Promotion and advertising were ramped up in May and June 2008, as the YouTube Spore channel opened, new trailers focusing on each phase along with developer interviews were released, and the Creature Creator was released, allowing players to upload their creations to the revamped official site. Will Wright announced at E3 2008 that National Geographic would do a television documentary on Spore, as scientists use the game to explain real-life biological, physical, and evolutionary science; this is the same documentary that will be included with Spore: Galactic Edition. He also announced a partnership with SETI, taking part in the Celebrating Science 2008 activity on July 16, 2008, where Spore betas were available for play.Electronic Arts E3 2008 press conference On August 14, 2008, Spore was declared to have gone gold. =Gameplay changes= The gameplay itself had numerous changes during development. The most striking was the shift in realism, from the gritty depiction of cellular and animal life in the GDC 2005 debut, to the current iteration of a more round, softer edged depiction of the creatures. The most visible change was in the cellular phase, which transformed the unicellular organisms into strange insects with cartoonish, human-like eyes, which were used \\"to make it cute\\", according to Wright during the 2007 TED seminar. According to Wright, the Spore development team was broken into two camps, the \\"Cute\\" camp that wanted to skew the game's focus towards a The Sims-type of game, and the \\"Science\\" camp that wanted to keep the game as realistic as possible. The final version was more or less a compromise between the two; Wright stated, \\"We ended up with a very nice balance of the two factors.\\" Another constantly changing aspect was the number of phases in the game. Initially, in 2005, the game consisted of seven phases: Cell, Underwater, Creature, Tribe, City, Civilization and Space. During the annual Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences DICE Summit on February 7, 2007, a slide was displayed (see image, right) which listed a total of eight phases. The Underwater phase had been removed, and Molecular was added (which was likened to Tetris). Furthermore, the Space phase was split into Terraform and Galactic phases; terraforming represented a limited form of power to slowly change planets within one's own system, whilst the galactic phase represented a more god-like power upon the acquisition of the interstellar space drive: being able to travel outside of one's solar system. The 2007 TED seminar in March 2007 displayed only five phases. The Molecular and Cellular phases had been condensed into one Cell phase. The City stage had been removed, and from Wright's demonstration it appears that the stage has been assimilated into the start of the Civilization phase. Furthermore, the two last phases were condensed back into the single Space phase. In Wright's 2005 demonstration, the creature with which he began looked remarkably similar to his earlier microbe. This led many people to believe that the creature was based upon the microbe's appearance. However, in a 2006 video from E3, narrated by a senior programmer, it was said that the player will initially begin as a slug-like animal. The narrator further stated the reason for this was to allow for more player creativity. This created uncertainty as to which method would be used in the final game; particularly as a later video demonstrated the essence of the cell creature emerging from a pond. The 2007 TED Presentation in March 2007 again depicted a legless, slug-like creature emerging from the water, leaving a trail of slime in its wake. The cellular phase was renamed as the tide pool phase,Spore.com \\"About\\" page then called the cell phase months later. The final phases: Cell, Creature, Tribal, Civilization and Space were the five available stages at the final release of Spore. Two notable locomotive abilities for the creatures were also the subject of speculation during the long development: Flight A flying creature was seen briefly in the GDC 2005 demo, but for a long time since that appearance, it was unknown whether it would be possible to make flying creatures in the game, though it is now known that it is. Many Maxis-developed default Spore creatures feature feathers and wings, and it is now known that they are functional and not simply decorative. Wing types include butterfly-like wings, as seen in the IGN Evolution video, bat-like wings, and bird-like wings. In a Gadgetoff 2007 seminar demonstration, Wright made a bird-like creature with large, feathered wings; but it only flapped its wings and did not fly. However, on February 13, 2008, a hands on preview revealed that wings still give creatures the ability of limited flight. The Creature Creator and subsequent videos revealed that creatures have a limited form of flight: gliding. A creature's ability to stay aloft was dependent on two factors: the jumping ability (to get in the air) and gliding ability (how slow the descent is). Swimming Similarly, the underwater phase featuring swimming creatures had vanished since its appearance in the original 2005 GDC demo, which led to fears that it may have been cut. However, in the July 2006 issue of PC Gamer (UK) their preview of Spore suggested that players would not only be able to create aquatic creatures, but would be able to develop them into a fully underwater civilization.PC Gamer UK, July 2006, issue 163, page 31 More recently, in the SXSW 2007 demo, each phase has a mentioned text goal on the screen and the stated goal of the tide pool phase is \\"become large enough to move onto land\\", by implication omitting a creature-underwater phase. The opening Flash player cinematic of the official site does feature underwater evolution of a creature, so it is possible that the underwater phase is simply a part of the larger tide pool phase. During the SXSW 2007 demo, Will Wright said that the underwater phase was on the verge of being cut out. However, he has also said that, if cut, underwater civilizations would be one of the first things to add via an expansion pack. Though the final version of Spore released to stores had indeed proven the underwater phase had been cut, it is still possible for the player's creature to swim above water. If the player swim too far into the sea, then they get eaten by a sea monster, which is probably the present-game Maxis creature, Battered Feesh. =Release date delays= The game had undergone numerous delays to its release date throughout its development, having appeared at three straight E3 shows with the promise of a release that year. On May 8, 2007, Electronic Arts CEO John Riccitiello said that the release of Spore is \\"right on the bubble with Q4 [January‚ÄìMarch 2008], if not, for Q1 fiscal 09 [April‚ÄìJune 2008]\\". CFO Warren Jenson stated that the game will not be included in the company's financial plan for its current fiscal year, which ends March 31, 2008. Later that year, on August 1, 2007, Riccitiello reaffirmed his previous statements in another conference call, saying the release \\"is sort of squarely targeted against March, April, May of next year\\", but cautioning that \\"intellectual properties like this and games like these are so large and so complex that we chose not to put it in our fiscal year guidance because these things are pretty hard to predict, and the outcomes can be volatile [‚Ä¶] So our best guess right now is Q1 of next fiscal, but we're not actually providing guidance for next fiscal at this point.\\" Maxis VP Patrick Beuchner revealed on July 10, 2007 during a G4TV interview that the Nintendo DS and mobile phone versions would ship the same day as the PC version. In October, Wright stated that Spore would be ready in roughly six months (around April 2008). Wired News gave Spore the second place in its annual list of vaporware awards‚Äîthat is, an award to projects that have been prolonged too much already. Gamasutra reported on January 29, 2008 that Spore might be delayed until fall or winter 2008. Two days later, EA CEO John Riccitiello stated that Spore would be released sometime before the holidays. On February 12, 2008, Electronic Arts announced in an official press release that the official release date would be September 5, 2008 for Europe and September 7, 2008 for North America. Later it was announced the full version of the game was due to be released on September 4, 2008 in Australia and Nordic regions, but Australian stores prematurely broke the street date on September 1, 2008. =Spore Creature Creator= The Spore Creature Creator was released several months before 'Spore's' release, which allowed users to create creatures for the game prior to its release. =Spore Comic Creator= The Spore team worked on a partnership with a comic creation software company to offer comic book versions of a personalized Spore story. Comic books with stylized pictures of various creatures, some whose creation has been shown in various presentations, can be seen on the walls of the Spore team's office. The utility was revealed at Comic-Con International on July 24, 2008 as the Spore Comic Creator, which would use MashOn.com and its e-card software. =Platform announcements= Microsoft Windows, Nintendo DS and mobile phone versions of the game were initially confirmed. Wright expressed the desire to release the game on other platforms, such as seventh generation consoles, the PlayStation Portable and the Apple Macintosh. In a GameSpy interview, Wright stated, \\"Well, actually we are going to go on all platforms, but we will come out on PC first. We will even come out on cell phones and stuff.\\" In a Videogamesblogger.com interview, Wright said that the game will take different forms on the different consoles. As for the Wii, Wright also said that it offers a lot of creative opportunities so the Wii may receive a different game. On October 26, 2007, Wright expressed a desire to develop for the Wii because the console was his \\"favorite platform\\" (though he did not elaborate any plans for a Wii version), in what was called an \\"off-the-cuff\\" statement; as of February 13, 2008, no official announcement from Electronic Arts has been forthcoming.GameSpot, Oct. 26, 2007. In a February 12, 2008 interview with N'Gai Croal, Wright talked briefly about the Wii version and how they plan on making the Wii controller a factor in that version of the game. In addition, representatives by EA and Maxis confirmed in an interview that a Wii version of Spore was in the early design process. Electronic Arts announced on January 15, 2008 that the Mac OS X version would be released on the same day as the PC version. The announcement was timed to coincide with the MacWorld Conference & Expo 2008, which showed Spore running on Macs. On February 13, 2007, the Nintendo DS and mobile phone versions were revealed to be spinoffs of the main game to be released on the same day as the main version, and each focusing on a single phase of gameplay. The Nintendo DS version was titled Spore Creatures, a 2D story-based RPG based in the Creature phase in which the gamer plays a creature kidnapped by a UFO and forced to survive in a strange world, with elements of Nintendogs. The mobile phone version of Spore, called Spore Origins, was based on the tide pool phase, in which players try to survive as a multicellular organism, with gameplay similar to flOw. On March 6, 2008, an iPhone version was demonstrated at Apple's iPhone SDK press event, though there was no commitment to ship such a product given at that event. The iPhone-Spore demo made use of the device's touch capabilities and 3-axis accelerometer.Live coverage of the iPhone Software Roadmap announcement Electronic Arts confirmed on March 31, 2008 that Spore would be receiving post-release expansion packs. Only one expansion pack has been revealed so far, called \\"galactic adventures\\" . It will include an adventure editor, as well as many new items and the ability for a player to go down to a planet's surface. =Special edition= On June 24, 2008, the Spore: Galactic Edition was announced. This special edition game is priced at $79.99, and includes a \\"Making of Spore\\" DVD video, a \\"How to Build a Better Being\\" DVD video, by National Geographic Channel (not included in all countries), a \\"The Art of Spore\\" hardback mini-book, a fold-out Spore poster and a 100-page Galactic Handbook. Procedural generation Spore extensively uses procedural generation, rather than individual objects. Wright mentioned in an interview given at E3 2006 that the information necessary to generate an entire creature would be only a couple of kilobytes, according to Wright, who presented the following analogy: \\"think of it as sharing the DNA template of a creature while the game, like a womb, builds the 'phenotypes' of the animal, which represent a few megabytes of texturing, animation, etc.\\" In Spore, all creature animations are made on the fly. \\"The game automatically knows how to animate your creature based on how you put it together. For example, if you give your creature four equine legs, you can logically expect it to gallop around like a horse.\\" In Wright's first public demonstration of Spore, he created a tripedal reptilian creature in the creature editor (this creature was dubbed the Willosaur by fans, after Wright, and became one of the mascots for the game, appearing prominently in the game's first trailer.). The game then determined how a lizard with three legs and a prehensile tail should walk. Other animations of the lizard including hunting, eating, swimming, dragging objects, mating, playing a drum and dancing, all of which were procedurally generated based on the model that the player created. Wright then revealed several pre-made creatures which moved realistically, despite their exotic design: large, insectile creatures with multiple heads and six legs, Tweety Bird the SUV: a walking bird whose massive head caused it to tilt while turning, and a dog-like creature with a set of unusually branching limbs. Wright also humorously demonstrated a creature that looked like a Care Bear (claiming it would be a vicious carnivore), indicating that players could create animals similar to those found in nature or popular culture. This also applied to vehicles such as space ships, as demonstrated in the Gadgetoff video, in which Wright was seen piloting a UFO similar to the USS Enterprise. Chris Hecker, who worked on Spore (including its early prototypes), gave a presentation at GDC 2005 and Futureplay entitled \\"Why you should have paid attention in multivariable calculus\\", in which he describes the mathematics of an implicit surface and various methods to apply texture projections to such surfaces. Sean O'Neil worked as a consultant for Maxis \\"to assist with R&D; involving dynamic generation and rendering of a fractal-based world\\". He maintains a website with a demonstration of procedural planet generation and a simulation of dynamic atmospheric scattering. Wright noted that he hired a handful of demoscene programmers and artists because of their familiarity with procedural generation. An example of software they used was ParticleMan, which simulated gravitational attraction between particles in a cloud, which would be incorporated into the space phase. It helped orchestrate such gravitational dynamics as orbits, nebula formation, star formation and particle streams from sources like pulsars and black holes. ParticleMan was developed internally at Maxis by Jason Shankel and uses the GLUT OpenGL app kit developed by Mark Kilgard and the GLUT-based GLUI UI library developed by Paul Rademacher. The official site allows users to sample a number of Spore prototypes, which include ParticleMan, SPUG, City Maze, and other software, all under 1000KB in size, save the 20MB Space, and the 45mb Gonzago. =Technologies= Will Wright names the demoscene as a major influence on Spore, which is largely based on procedural content generation developed by many demoscene veterans. Specifically, as the demoscene was originally limited by the hardware and storage capabilities of their target machines (16/32 bit home computers such as the Atari ST and the Commodore Amiga ran on floppy disks), they developed intricate algorithms to produce large amounts of content from very little initial data. Wright showed pictures from demoparties like Assembly demo party to great applause at GDC 2005. On August 9, 2007, SIGGRAPH 2007 featured a seminar titled Spor(T), including segments Player Driven Procedural Texturing, Creating Spherical Worlds, Fast Object Distribution, and Rigblocks: Player- Deformable Objects, given by Spore development team members Andrew Willmott, Ocean Quigley, Henry Goffin, Chris Hecker, Shalin Shodhan and David DeBry. Andrew Willmott has made available slides and videos from the seminar detailing the techniques. Frank Gibeau, president of Electronic Arts' Games Label announced that Electronic Arts may use the underlying technology of Spore to develop eclectic software titles, such as action, real-time strategy and role-playing video games, focusing on player-creation concepts. Gibeau stated, \\"What's so beautiful about Spore is that it's extremely malleable... you could take it to different platforms, like (Web-page) flash games, the PlayStation 3, the Xbox 360, Nintendo's Wii. It really travels well to other platforms.\\" Music The music for the game was designed by Brian Eno, an artist famous for his work with ambient music. Eno has worked with Kent Jolly and Aaron McLeran to implement a simple piece of software in Spore called \\"The Shuffler\\", which procedurally generates fragments for the soundtrack from a number of samples, based on the programming language Pure Data. Eno appeared in the aforementioned June 2006 lecture to give a talk alongside Wright at the Long Now Foundation. In January 2007, Eno confirmed his involvement in a lecture given at the Berlin University of the Arts. Eno was involved with Wright and Spore at least as early as June 2006.

Langsdorf (October 23, 1909 ‚Äì November 18, 2002) was the founding president of California State University, Fullerton (then known as Orange County State College).  Background  William B. Langsdorf (1909-2002) was born in Denver, CO but grew up in Pasadena, CA. He completed his B.A. and M.A. degrees at Occidental College and his Ph.D. in history at the University of California, Berkeley. He taught history at Occidental for several years before becoming an administrator at Pasadena City College. He served as assistant principal at Pasadena City College from 1939 to 1950 and then as principal (president) from 1950 to 1959. At the time Langsdorf accepted the appointment as the first president of Orange County State College (January 19, 1959), the institution existed in name only. It had no campus, faculty, administration, or staff.  Establishing Orange County State College  = 1959-1965 = Langsdorf faced a number of challenges when he accepted the appointment as the first president of Orange County State College (later to become California State University, Fullerton). These included finding temporary quarters to house the administrative offices of the new college, as well as finding people to fill the administrative positions. Temporary quarters also had to be found to house the soon to be hired faculty, and the first classes to be offered by the college. A 228-acre tract of land in the northeast corner of the city of Fullerton had been identified for the permanent campus; however, title to various portions of the land was held by several different owners. It would take close to two years before the state could acquire all of this land for the campus. Langsdorf was able to obtain the use of one floor of an old building owned by the local community college, Fullerton College, that had been moved to the campus of Fullerton High School to house the administrative offices. He also was able to obtain an agreement to use space at the recently opened Sunny Hills High School campus in north-west Fullerton to house faculty and classes until temporary buildings could be constructed at the permanent campus site. Langsdorf quickly recruited an administrative staff that included Executive Dean Dr. Stuart McComb who had been Superintendent of the Pico Rivera School District, Dean of Instruction Dr. Gerhard Ehmann who had been president of Glendale Community College, Finance Officer Jack Lyons from the San Francisco State College Foundation, Dean of Students Dr. Earnest A. Becker from Pasadena City College, and Librarian Dr. Earnest Toy, Jr. from Riverside City College. At the time the state colleges in California were under the nominal control of the California state department of education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction. However, in practice, the individual state colleges enjoyed a considerable degree of autonomy. This gave Langsdorf the opportunity to select the academic direction of the new college. Most of the existing state colleges had been established as teacher-training institutions, though by 1959 segments of the faculties at many of these colleges were pressing to widen their academic roles. By 1959 Orange County was changing rapidly. Housing tracts and new industry, including a number of high-technology industries, were springing up throughout the county as agricultural land was sold off to developers. Langsdorf recognized that the new college would need to offer more than teacher education if it was to serve the needs of its service area. Teacher education would be a significant part of the mission of Orange County State College, but only a part of its mission. The founding faculty members hired by Langsdorf to head the divisions of the new college represented a broad range of academic disciplines. They included Seth Fessenden (Speech), E.C. Newsom, Miles D. McCarthy (Science), Lawrence de Graaf (History), Lester Beals, Barbara Hartsig (Education), and William Alamshah (Philosophy) along with Librarian Toy. The liberal arts thus became a key component in the education of all students in the new college regardless of their individual degree interests. With the initial administrators and faculty members in place along with a five-person clerical staff, Orange County State College opened its doors to 452 students at Sunny Hills High School on September 21, 1959, nine months after Langsdorf became president. At the same time planning began for the growth of the student body and the development of the permanent campus. Langsdorf organized all of his administrators and faculty members into a Faculty Council The Senate Forum- Vol. 2 No. 3-March 1988 to advise him on these issues. He delegated to the Faculty Council significant responsibility for the development of academic policy for the new college, as well as seeking their advice regarding the physical development of the new campus. Though a few other California state colleges had academic senates at this time, this level of collegial governance was unique among the state colleges. When the California State College System was established following the development of the Master Plan for Higher Education in California in 1961, both the requirement that all students complete a core general education program firmly based in the liberal arts and the principle of collegial governance in the development of academic policies that were pioneered by Langsdorf at Fullerton became system-wide cornerstones. Construction began on 12 temporary buildings on the permanent campus site in March 1960. These were ready for occupancy by the Fall 1960 semester. At the time state funds for permanent buildings were driven by formulas based on FTES (full-time equivalent students). State planners projected that enrollment at the Fullerton campus eventually would reach approximately 35,000 FTES, so Langsdorf and his staff were faced with the challenge of creating facilities on the 238 acre site that would be able to accommodate that level of enrollment. Their solution was to delay completion of the first permanent building for four years, so that the new college's enrollment could grow. In addition, though the building was intended to eventually house the mathematics and science programs, it was designed in such a way that it initially could house almost all the academic programs of the college. The resulting structure, the Letters and Science Building (later renamed McCarthy Hall), which opened in the Fall of 1963 was a six-story building with a full basement with a total of about 300,000 sq. ft. of floor space. The next two permanent buildings built were the Music-Speech-Drama Building, which was completed in December 1964, and the Physical Education Building opened in September 1965. Langsdorf and his staff selected these for construction before other buildings on the campus master plan, because the state formulas were more generous for buildings that housed these activities. = 1966-1970 = The period from 1959-65 was marked by a high level of cooperation between Langsdorf and his administrators and faculty members, relatively strong support from state agencies, budgets that were sufficient to fund the new construction and additional faculty positions needed to keep up with a rapidly growing campus. The number of students had grown from 466 at the opening of classes in 1959 to 4,971 during the 1964-65 academic year. The corresponding FTES had grown from 180 to 3149 during the same period. The second half of Langsdorf tenure as president presented much more severe challenges. The faculty was becoming more numerous and more diverse. The \\"old guard\\" faculty members viewed the college as primarily a teaching institution, while the \\"new turks\\" wanted more attention paid to research and scholarship in retention, tenure, and promotion decisions. This led to some contentious Faculty Council elections. State college faculty also were becoming concerned about compensation and working conditions, and the issue of collective bargaining was raised on many campuses including Fullerton. In addition, state budget problems began to affect funding for the state colleges. These problems were felt most severely on campuses like Fullerton that were experiencing rapid growth in enrollment. The Fullerton campus was adding about 1000 FTES each year from 1966 through 1970. As a result, Langsdorf and his administrators were under pressure to keep the campus building plan on schedule, and to continue to add new members to the faculty. This pressure increased when Ronald Reagan took over as governor in 1967. Reagan proposed reducing the budget for the state colleges and for cutting faculty salaries to cope with the state budget problems. Nevertheless, Langsdorf and his staff were able to complete a number of building projects. The campus library was opened in 1966, the campus Commons opened in 1967, the Humanities and Social Science Building was completed in 1969, and the art building was completed in 1969. In addition construction was begun on the Engineering complex and on a building to house campus administrative offices and the School of Business Administration and Economics. Parking also was a major problem on the largely commuter campus. There were fewer than 4,000 parking spaces to accommodate the 1967 enrollment of 10,750 students. This problem was relieved substantially when the system Board of Trustees began issuing revenue bonds to fund parking facilities on the campuses. Parking fees for students, staff, and faculty were used to pay off these bonds. National events also were becoming much more turbulent with issues related to the counterculture, civil rights, the draft, and the Vietnam War coming to the forefront at this time. Unrest related to these issues affected many college and university campuses across the country during the second half of the decade. However, the Fullerton campus did not feel the full force of this trend until nearly the end of the decade. Nevertheless, Langsdorf and his administration had to cope with these issues. The student population on the campus was overwhelmingly white at this time. In 1967 there were only five black students enrolled, and the numbers of Native American, Asian-American, and Hispanic students also were very small. Following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in April 1968, the campus established a program to recruit and support more minority students. Langsdorf obtained funds to hire a director for this \\"New Education Horizons\\" program, which in 1969 became part of a state-funded equal opportunity program (EOP). The first major incident that attracted significant public attention - and a State Senate investigation - was a student production of Michael McClure's allegedly pornographic play, The Beard, which was staged on campus during the fall semester of 1967. State Senators James E. Whetmore (R. Fulleron) and John G. Schmitz (R. Tustin) criticized Langsdorf for approving tenure for Professor Edwin Duerr, who allowed students in one of his classes to stage the play. Later Republicans in the State Senate attempted to force the firing of Duerr and to withhold funding from the state college system, but their bills failed in the Assembly. This incident forced Langsdorf to defend academic freedom in the college. In the late sixties chapters of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and the Student Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam (SMC) were formed on the campus. However, the Fullerton campus did not experience any major disturbances until the spring semester of 1970. At the invitation of the campus, Governor Ronald Reagan gave his first speech on a public college campus at Fullerton on February 9, 1970. This appearance drew a substantial number of protestors to the campus, and Reagan's speech was interrupted several times by hecklers. Arrest warrants for disturbing the peace were issued for two of the hecklers, Bruce Church and Dave MacKowiak, who coincidentally were leaders of SDS and SMC. This led to a sit-in by several hundred students in the Letters and Science Building on February 25, 1970, who demanded that the campus drop its disciplinary proceedings against the two arrested students. Police cleared the students from building and relative calm returned to the campus until March 3, 1970, when a major disturbance took place in the campus quad when protestors interrupted campus disciplinary hearings for Church and MacKowiak. Approximately 90 police officers responded to a request for assistance from acting president L. Donald Shields. At the time, Langsdorf was with his wife who was undergoing surgery at UCLA hospital. Police arrested 19 students and cleared the Quad. Eventually the number of students arrested either for heckling Reagan or for participating in the March 3rd confrontation with police totaled 37. Students held daily meetings on the Quad and posted banners around the campus following the March 3rd confrontation. However, there were no major incidents or disruption of campus activities until late April when students began selling a book of pictures of the earlier confrontation on campus. The inside of the dust jacket for the book showed a graphic picture of several people protesting in the nude. This led to further arrests., and to the occupation of the Performing Arts Building by a group that included both anti-war activists and members of the counter- culture. The occupation was tolerated by the administration for a week. Then the administration ordered the removal of this group of protesters. It was found that this group included many individuals who were under the influence of drugs, and that significant damage to door locks and musical instruments had taken place. This was the last major campus disruption. At the time L. Donald Shields was acting president. Langsdorf was under doctor's orders to rest because the strain of campus events was affecting his health. Shortly thereafter Langsdorf resigned as campus president, and became Vice Chancellor for Adademic Affairs at the California State College Chancellor's Office in Long Beach.  Later years  Langsdorf served as president of Cal State Fullerton from 1959 to 1970 when he transferred to the Cal State System's Chancellor's Office in Long Beach and became Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs. Langsdorf's tenure at Fullerton marked a period of enormous growth for the institution. During Langsdorf's tenure as president the enrollment grew from a few hundred students to more than 15,000 students, and from less than 200 FTES to more than 10,000 FTES. This also was a period of extensive construction that transformed the college from a small collection of temporary buildings on of orange groves to a campus with several permanent facilities including the Letters and Science Building (now McCarthy Hall), a performing arts building, a visual arts center, a library, a humanities building, and a large physical education and athletics complex that included a gymnasium, swimming pool, tennis courts, and athletic fields. In 1974 the Administration- Business Administration Building was renamed Langsdorf Hall in President Langsdorf's honor. Langsdorf died at the age of 93 in 2002.

Early life Strausz (pronounced strooss) was born to a well-to-do family in Budapest, Hungary, as evident by his educated abilities. During the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, he served as a lieutenant under Gen. Art√∫r G√∂rgey, surrendering with him at Vil√°gos (now ≈ûiria, Romania) in 1849. He was taken prisoner by the Russians, then released into custody of the Austrians for service in the Austrian army in Italy. However, he and several others deserted, seeking refuge first in Hamburg, then in London, UK, in 1850. On 18 April 1851, he arrived in the United States at the port of Boston, Massachusetts, with a letter of introduction to Edward Everett. He was supposedly also acquainted with Daniel Webster. He worked briefly for an architectural firm in Boston, but did not receive adequate compensation. By the end of the year, he was working for the US Coast Survey. Personal life in America He met and married the former Annie Young (1837‚Äì1889) of Washington, D.C., one of the daughters of Noble Young, M.D. They had one son, Philip H. (1861‚Äì1907) prior to the war, and a few other children after the war: Minnie, Julian, Alex Jr. (1872‚Äì1915), Louisa and Henry (1877‚Äì1922). Philip would later attend West Virginia University between 1881 and 1883, and earned his medical degree from New York University's Bellevue Hospital Medical College in 1885. His years of medical service included serving on the American Volunteer Medical Corps' Yellow Fever Experts in 1888. He was married to the former Lida Davis, and they had two children. Upon his death in Toledo, Ohio, he was buried in Oak Grove Cemetery, Morgantown, West Virginia. Alex Jr. would later become an auditor for various railway companies in Texas, the Philippines and Mexico City. He married the former Mary Hattie Hubbard of Florida. He died from medical complications and never recovered from surgery while working in the Philippines. They had two children, Fenton Egbert who died of a brain tumor (1900‚Äì1910) and Mary Helen (1912‚Äì2011) in St. Louis, Missouri. Upon Alex Jr.'s death, Mary Helen Hubbard Strausz took her four- year-old daughter to Los Angeles, California and eventually remarried. Mary Helen Strausz married Louis Paul Crespi (1931), from the family of Father Cresp√≠ who built the California Missions with Father Jun√≠pero Serra, and had one child Shirley Louise Crespi (1932‚Äì2002). Shirley Louise Crespi married Kenneth Elden Pepping (1929‚Äì2012) and they had two daughters. Henry Noble \\"Harry\\" Strausz would serve in the 6th Ohio Infantry during the Spanish War, and later became a dentist in New Orleans, Louisiana. He married the former Olive Agnes Pratt of Ohio. They had one son, Julien. Strausz's in-laws were notable. Dr. Young had five surviving children, Albert, Annie, Elizabeth, Minna and Ellen. Elizabeth married Felix Nemegyei, another Hungarian revolutionary and refugee. Minna married Col. Edward Field, son of Richard Stockton Field. Ellen married Gen. Harry C. Egbert. Sons-in-law to the last couple included Gen. Charles E. Kilbourne and Adm. Yates Stirling, Jr. Shuter's Hill Brewery In 1858, he partnered with John Klein to set up Shuter's Hill Brewery, which is located at the base of Shooter's Hill in Alexandria, Virginia, close to Hooff's Run, where King and Duke Streets now extend. This venture introduced lager beer to Virginia. In 1860, he sold out his interest in the company for US$2,000. U.S. Coast Survey In 1851, he joined the U.S. Coast Survey as a draughtsman. This post was secured by Edward Everett. He participated in one significant campaign in the American Civil War: the Vicksburg Campaign. =Vicksburg= As the Mississippi Campaign focused on Vicksburg, Admiral David Dixon Porter required updated and accurate navigational charts of the area in November 1862. In December 1862, Porter sent Strausz to reconnoiter the riverside defenses of that city. Under a flag of truce, he was able to sketch out the battery positions, convincing Porter of the impracticality of attacking the place by water alone. He was active during the venture of Steele's Bayou of March 1863 until Porter decided to call it off. It was during this time that he met and become good friends with Julius H. Kroehl. In June 1863, he was detached to survey the Confederate works from Lauman's extreme left until it would meet up with survey teams of McClernand's Corps. He came down with malaria, and would have to recuperate for several months. =Other USCS activities= * Leader, Hydrographic party around New Bern, North Carolina, in 1864. * Member, Hydrographic party in the Hudson River, New York, in 1864. * Member, Hydrographic party along the coast of Maine, until November 1864. * Leader, Hydrographic party on the San Juan River, Nicaragua, in 1865. Post-War =Wilmington= In 1867, taking advantage of the building surge in Wilmington, North Carolina, Strausz and his family relocated there. He partnered with Lawson E. Rice to form the Cape Fear Building Co. A few structures that he either designed or built still remain and are listed in the National Register of Historical Places. These places are the Strausz House, the Hasell-Parsley House, the William A. French House, the Temple of Israel and the Tileston School. These can be viewed at https://web.archive.org/web/20070907152117/http://wwwtmpapps.nhcgov.com/LIB/PortCityArch/Search.asp. He was also building railway cars. =Irondale= In 1878, a fellow √©migr√© and brother-in-law, Col. Felix de Nemegyei, hired him when he briefly lived in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to manage the Irondale Furnace near Independence, West Virginia, producing wrought iron. Both their wives were also sisters. He continued to live and work there until 1885, when the plant was closed down. The primary causes were the increasing competition from Bessemer steel and workers' demand for higher wages. In 1879, he provided a statement to Sophia Kroehl on the nature of her late husband's illness to be included in her pension application. =Palatka= In 1885, he and his family relocated to Palatka, Florida, buying near the St. Johns River. He was the secretary and treasurer of the Palatka Milling Company. He also served as superintendent of schools from 1889 to 1892. Annie Young Strausz is buried along with one small son in West View Cemetery in Palatka, Florida. It is believed they died of the yellow fever epidemic that struck about that time. In 1890, he responded again to Sophia Kroehl's request for a statement. Shortly thereafter, he retired and left for Toledo, Ohio. =Retirement= Already widowed, he lived with his eldest son, Philip, who had established himself as a physician, and his family. He lived there until his death in 1905. His place of burial is undetermined at this time. References Allen, Dave. (2006). \\"The Ante- Bellum Iron Industry in Western Virginia: Col.

It is part of the Evergreen Public Schools school district. While the campus is located within the proper city limits of Vancouver, it has a Camas area zip code. The campus was completed in July 2007. Union High School's principal is Griffin Peyton. The school colors are black, silver, and red. The school's mascot is the Titan. About Union opened in the fall of 2007 with students consisting of only freshmen, sophomores, and a handful of juniors. The original Union High School was founded in 1910. James Blair was the first principal. It is the fourth high school built in the Evergreen School District - Evergreen High School was the first, Mountain View High School was second, and Heritage High School was the third. The four high schools share one football stadium, McKenzie Stadium, which is adjacent to Evergreen High School. The school and campus were developed with the concept of utilizing contemporary educational technology. The design collaboration for the school won it a 2007 Community Development Department Community Pride Design award. In June 2010 Newsweek magazine listed Union High School in its annual list of ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Best High Schools,‚Äù which includes 1,600, or about 6 percent, of the nation's high schools. UHS was listed 572nd nationally and 8th out of 32 high schools listed in the state of Washington. Sports The Union football team is one of the school's most prominent athletic teams. They had a record of 6-3 in their first year without seniors. In 2008, the undefeated Titans lost to Bellevue High School in the 3A state championship game. The Titans won 3A GSHL league titles in 2008, and 2009. The Titans earned 2nd place 4A GSHL titles in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 and finished 1st in 2017 and 2018. In 2018 the undefeated Titans beat Lake Stevens High School 52-20 in the 4A state championship, receiving their first state title in football. Union's wrestling team are five-time Clark County champions, five-time GSHL league champions, six-time district champions, and three-time regional champions. In 2011, Titan wrestling took the team title at the prestigious Pacific Coast Championships, and in 2012 and 2014 they won state trophies, placing 4th and 3rd respectively. Union's individual state champions include Clint Coulter (2010), John \\"Junior\\" Godinho (2014), Alex Barfanger (2014) and two-time state champs Dan Snediker and Ethan Rowton. The cheer squad also placed 2nd at state. Union's track and field has seen many accomplishments in its short history. In its first year, the track team finished second at state. The Union Titans softball team were league, district and regional champs, and then took 3rd in state. The Union Titans boys' basketball program is among the finest in the state, having won or competed in state championships nearly every year. The 2017 varsity boys' team won 2nd place in the state's 4A division. The Union Titans girls' golf team won the 3A league and district titles in 2010. In the 4A classification they took district in 2011, and league and district titles in 2012. The Union girls soccer team won the 4A GSHL league and district championship in 2019. They had an undefeated season in 2019 and they advanced to the state quarterfinals. Campus The Union High School Campus has five different site-built buildings which house the four different academic academies and the Student Commons, and a large modular unit. The five campus buildings are the Leadership and Business building (100), the Engineering and Environmental Sciences building (200), International Studies and Athletics building (300), the Visual and Performing Arts building (400), and the Student Union (500). The last building (600) is a multi-use building housing such programs as American Sign Language and Dance. Each building excluding the Student Union contains the basic core classes including math, general science, and English. Each building also contains specialty classes specific to that building. Every classroom throughout all the buildings has a common set of technology resources installed, including a video projector, a document camera, and speech amplification system for teachers. Union High School also features wireless hot spots which cover the entire campus. Students can use the campus Wi-fi system to connect to their student district computer account, and access school computer resources, to work on school assignments without the need to check into a school computer lab. Academics Union follows the Small Learning Communities model of learning environment. Students may choose a thematic focus community, such as performing arts or math and sciences, which allows them to better focus on areas of interest. UHS Band The Union High School Band Program is directed by Adam Morell and Timothy Siess. Since its first year with 120 students, the program has grown to serve over 200 students and offers a wide variety of musical opportunities. The program includes Concert Band, Symphonic Band, 2 Jazz Ensembles (I & II), Percussion Ensemble, Chamber Music/Wind Ensemble, Football Band, Basketball Band, Marching Band, Pit Orchestra, and instrument choirs. Students in the program are active in honors ensembles such as the Portland Youth Philharmonic, All- State and All-Northwest ensembles/orchestras. Student-run ensembles and solos compete at state championships at Central Washington University every year, often winning 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place in the state. Union Band has won awards for being among the highest average GPA band programs in the state. The program's fundamental emphasis continues to be excellence on and off the stage. =Program highlights= * 2016 Music for All National Festival \\\\- one of 16 bands in the country selected as a \\"featured ensemble\\" * 2013 National Association for Music Education NW Division Conference Performance * 2012 Music for All National Festival \\\\- one of 16 bands in the country selected as a \\"featured ensemble\\" * 2010, 2011, 2013, 2016, 2017 and 2019 Portland Rose Festival Starlight Parade Champions * 2012 and 2014 Portland Rose Festival Grand Floral Parade Champions * 2010 Midwest Clinic Performance * 2010 WMEA State Conference Performance * 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2016 and 2017 Washington State Champions, Large Percussion Ensemble * 2010, 2011, 2012, 2016 Washington State Champions, Small Percussion Ensemble * Best Jazz Ensemble, 2010-2013 Oregon Jazz Festival, 2008 and 2014 Vancouver BC Heritage Festival, 2011 Seattle Heritage Festival, 2009 San Francisco Heritage Festival UHS Choir The Union High School Choir program is directed by Mikkel Iverson, previously the choral director at Evergreen High School.

The engine was not as popular as the VI, due in no small part to the Great Depression, and only a small number were built. Experiments with supercharging led to the related BMW IX. Design and development The main change from the VI to the VII was the addition of a 0.62 ratio propeller reduction gearing system, allowing the engine to run at higher RPM, and thus higher power settings, while still efficiently driving the same propellers. A more minor change was the movement of the magnetos from the back of the cylinder banks to the front, which allowed easier access for maintenance, (similar changes to the original six-cylinder BMW V led to the BMW VIII). The crankcase was offered in aluminum alloy or Elektron. Operational history The engine was first built in 1928 and passed its acceptance tests in June 1930. Only a few examples of the BMW VII went into operation, in the single-engined version of the Junkers Ju 52, for example, and in the Dornier Wal which Wolfgang von Gronau flew around the world in 1932. The VII was also used for forced-aspiration experiments with a \\"mixture blower\\" (a radial fan located behind the carburettor); this led in due course to the development of the BMW IX aircraft engine.

Ceravision is the inventor of High Efficiency Plasma (HEP) lighting technology, a new and unique genre of electrodeless lamps, driven by radio frequency (RF) and particularly suited to medium and high power commercial applications.\\"Switched on to a bulb that lasts\\", The Sunday Times\\"Everlasting Light\\", The Economist HEP lighting technology is ideally suited for a number of high-output commercial lighting applications. Ceravision has exploited the ability to use various doses to efficiently deliver tailored spectra for particular applications. The company has launched an HEP plasma grow-light for the horticulture and hydroponics markets that delivers the blue-light, UV-A and UV-B missing from most available grow-light spectrums in the market. However, HEP plasma lighting technology lends itself to several other high- output applications including lighting for: reptile houses; artificial coral growth; insect breeding; TV film and studio; and ultra-violet (UV-C) water sterilisation. Electrodeless lamp Electrodeless lamps have been recognized, since Nikola Tesla filed a patent in 1894, as having a number of advantages: * No electrodes to break - so potentially very long life * No chemical degradation of the electrodes - so much lower lumen loss and discoloration during life * No reactive chemicals in the light engine to cause material stress and reduced life. The inherent problems with constraining the radio waves within the lamp and minimising RF power have been successfully overcome. Developments Earlier incarnations, such as the sulfur lamp, had been very large. The invention took advantage of the high dielectric constant of ceramic to create a very small waveguide to constrain and focus the radio waves. Though the resulting lamp was small and produced a large number of lumens per watt at the bulb, the lamp efficiency was low since 80-85% of the light generated is trapped inside the opaque ceramic waveguide. Ceravision's invention was a clear quartz waveguide and integrated lamp, which forms a single piece construction. The generated light can now be collected because the waveguide is optically clear, giving excellent lamp lumens per watt. The integrated burner and waveguide, which is source of light, is very small meaning that it is possible to design exceptionally efficient luminaires. HID (high intensity discharge) luminaires have typical utilization efficiencies of 75%. Fluorescent lamp luminaires have efficiencies of 70% - meaning that 25% and 30% respectively of the light produced by the lamp is wasted. The ionCORE range has utilization efficiencies of more than 90%. The burner is integrated into the thick walled quartz waveguide, high powers from 100 - 5000W's are possible without damage to the lamp. The second issue - long life, low cost RF generation has been solved using a combination of a magnetron with a specialized controller. Magnetrons are manufactured in large volumes for use in microwave ovens and are able to produce RF power at low cost. The historic problem with magnetrons had been their short life (the life of a microwave magnetron was typically c.2,000 hours). Ceravision has developed a method of extending the life of magnetrons to over 40,000 hours. Ceravision has an agreement with Toshiba to develop high efficiency magnetrons.\\"Ceravision and Toshiba Electronics Sign Development and Supply Agreement to Advance High Efficiency Plasma Technology\\", PR Newswire The lamp consists of four integrated elements; a quartz RF resonator and integral plasma burner (lamp), a transition unit (the system which couples the RF source to the resonator), a magnetron, and an AC power supply. The resonator and integrated burner contain an inert gas and metal halide salts. Microwave energy ionizes the gas to form the plasma which combines with the metal halide to vaporize the metal halide salts and produce the light.

He is known for Morera's theorem in the theory of functions of a complex variable and for his work in the theory of linear elasticity. Biography =Life= He was born in Novara on 18 July 1856, the son of Giacomo Morera and Vittoria Unico.According to Somigliana (1910, p. 573; 1910a, p. 605): these commemorations include also a list of Morera's published works. According to , his family was a wealthy one, his father being a rich merchant. This occurrence eased him in his studies after the laurea:According to and to Somigliana (1910, p. 573; 1910a, p. 605). however, he was an extraordinarily hard worker and he widely used this ability in his researches.According to and , while not particularly inventive, he nevertheless approached many difficult questions, introducing original views that simplified considerably the theories he worked on. After studying in Turin he went to Pavia, Pisa and Leipzig: then he went back to Pavia for a brief period in 1885, and finally he went to Genova in 1886, living here for the next 15 years. While being in Genova he married his fellow-citizen Cesira Fa√†.See and From 1901 on to his death he worked in Turin:There is a discrepancy between the statement of source and the ones of sources , , : the former one refers that he lived in Genova for 14 years, while the others quantify the duration of the same period as 15 years. The version of the second group of references has been adopted, also on considering that Vito Volterra went to Rome in 1901. he died of pneumonia on 8 February 1909. and refer that he died in few days, notwithstanding his strong constitution. =Education and academic career= Francesco Siacci, who tutored Giacinto Morera in the early stage of his career. He earned in 1878 the laurea in engineering and then, in 1879, the laurea in mathematics, both awarded him from the Politecnico di Torino:According to and . According to , the title of his thesis in the mathematical sciences was: \\"Sul moto di un punto attratto da due centri fissi colla legge di Newton\\".\\"On the motion of a point attracted by two fixed centers according to Newton's law\\". Somigliana (1910, p. 573 and 1910a, p. 605) does not say if it was published as his first paper : however, the title is the same and the dates nearly coincide. In Turin he attended the courses held by Enrico d'Ovidio, Angelo Genocchi and particularly the ones held by Francesco Siacci: later in his life, Morera acknowledged Siacci as his mentor in scientific research and life.According to , who uses precisely the Italian respectful title \\"maestro\\". Somigliana (1910, p.574 and 1910a, p. 605) and refer also that it was Francesco Siacci who guided Morera towards the study of rational mechanics. After graduating, he followed several advanced courses: he studied in Pavia from 1881 to 1882According to and . under Eugenio Beltrami, Eugenio Bertini reports \\"Eugenio Berbini\\" (see also ) which is obviously a typo. and Felice Casorati. In 1883 he was in Pisa under Enrico Betti, Riccardo de Paolis and Ulisse Dini: a year later, he was in Leipzig under Felix Klein, Adolph Mayer and Carl Neumann.According to reference . Since Adolph Mayer and Felix Klein were teaching in universities outside Leipzig, it is not clear from the reference if the courses Morera attended to in Germany were privately held or were advanced university courses. Nevertheless, states precisely these dates, names and places, as does . In 1885 he went in Berlin in order to follow the lessons of Hermann von Helmholtz, Gustav Kirchhoff, Leopold KroneckerOnly cites Kronecker as one of his teachers. and Karl Weierstrass at the local university: later in the same year, he went back to Italy, briefly working at the University of Pavia as a professor in the then newly established \\"Scuola di Magistero\\".According to . The \\"Scuola di Magistero\\", literally \\"Teaching School\\", was a particular University school aimed to the training of teachers. In 1886, after passing the required competitive examination by a judging commission, states that the examination was \\"onorevolmente vinto\\" which literally means \\"won in honorable way\\", perhaps alluding to a honorable mention awarded to him by the examining commission. he became professor of rational mechanics at the University of Genova: he lived there for 15 years, serving also as dean and as rector.Precisely, according to he served the University of Genova as dean for the periods 1891‚Äì1892 and 1896‚Äì1897, and as rector in the two years following his last dean mandate. In 1901 he was called by the University of Turin to hold the chair of rational mechanics, left vacant by Vito Volterra. In 1908 he passed to the chair of \\"Meccanica Superiore\\"\\"Higher Mechanics\\": the locution identifies an advanced course on rational mechanics. and was elected dean of the Faculty of Sciences.. =Honours= He was member of the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei (first elected corresponding member on 18 July 1896, then elected national member on 26 August 1907)According to the yearbook of the academy, p. 494. and of the Accademia delle Scienze di Torino (elected on 9 February 1902).Cossa (1902, p. 252) also describes briefly his election ceremony to resident member, i.e. \\"socio residente\\". refers that also the Kharkov Mathematical Society elected him corresponding member during the meeting of the society held on 31 October 1909 (Old Calendar), being apparently not aware of his death. =Tracts of his personality and attitudes= Carlo Somigliana, close friend and biographer of Giacinto Morera. In his commemorative papers, Carlo Somigliana describes extensively Morera's personality: states that they were friends for more than twenty years and also colleagues from 1901 onward, talking about their scientific researches almost every day. In and he complains about the pain of commemorating him, nevertheless aiming to do this in order to widespread the knowledge of his personality and work. according to him, he was a devoted friend and precious colleague,See and . capable of serenely judging men and facts.See , and . Somigliana exactly states that he possessed \\"Serenit√† nel giudicare uomini e cose\\". On the very personal level, he remembers him s a cheerful person and a witty talker.According to Somigliana (1910, p. 580; 1910a, p. 610) and . His intelligence is described as sharp and penetrating,See , and . his mind as uncommonly lucid, goes further stating also that \\"(nella sua mente) non- trovavano mai posto idee vaghe o incomplete\\" (English translation: \\"(in is his mind) confused and incomplete ideas did not find any place\\"). himself as possessing analytic and critical abilities and being versatile, capable to grasp and appreciate every kind of manifestation of the human intellect.See and . Nevertheless, Somigliana also states that he was not interested in any scientific or other kind of field outside of his own realm of expertise.This was a consequence of his particular opinions, again according to Somigliana (1910, p.580; 1910a, p. 610): he excluded, and almost feared, everything not being classifiable as complete strictly scientific knowledge. himself, in the inaugural address as the rector of the University of Genova, after quoting a statement attributed to Peter Guthrie Tait,\\"Schivate la scienza popolare, essa √® tanto pi√π perniciosa, quanto pi√π pretenziosi sono quelli che la diffondono\\" (English translation: \\"Beware of popular science, it is as much as pernicious, as pretentious are the ones who spread it\\"), as also reported by Somigliana (1910, p. 580; 1910a, p. 610). revealed the reason behind his views: \\"In science, the one who has a sound and solid knowledge, even in a narrow field, holds a true strength and he can use it whenever he needs: the one who has only a superficial knowledge, however wide and striking, holds nothing, and indeed he often holds a weakness pushing him towards vanity\\".The exact words of are:-\\"Nella scienza chi ha cognizioni salde e profonde, in un campo anche ristretto, possiede una vera forza e all'uopo sa giovarsene; chi invece ha solo cognizioni superficiali, anche molto estese ed appariscenti, possiede nulla, anzi spesso ha in s√® un elemento di debolezza, che lo sospinge alla vanit√†\\". Acknowledged as honest, loyal and conscientious,See , and . good- tempered and with a good intellect,See . his simple manners earned him affection even when performing the duties of dean and rector at the University of Genoa.Again according to . Also describes him as a man of high moral value, and ascribes to such qualities the reason of his success in social relations and in performing his duties as a civil servant. However, despite of being successful in social relations, he did not cured nor appreciated much appearances and was not interested in activities other than teaching and doing research: consequently, he was not well known outside the circle of his family and relatives and the circle of his colleagues. He did not make a display of himself, careless of being not acknowledged by everyone for his true value: he also had a serious conception of life and strongly disliked vanity and superficiality. According to Somigliana, his entire life was devoted to the higher unselfish ideal of scientific research: and also remarks that only his beloved family shared the same attentions and cares he reserved to his lifelong ideal. Work =Research activity= According to Somigliana, he was not particularly inventive: he did not create any new theory since this was not his main ability.See . Instead, he perfected already developed theories:See . nearly all of his researches appear as the natural result of a deep analysis work on theories that have already reached a high degree of perfection, clearly and precisely exposed.See . He had an exquisite sense for the applicability of his work, derived from his engineering studies,According to , his first university studies were in the field of engineering, as briefly detailed in the \\"Education and academic career\\" subsection of this entry. and mastered perfectly all known branches of mathematical analysis and their mechanical and physical applications.See and . He authored more than 60 research works: nearly complete lists of his publications are included in the commemorative papers , and . In particular classifies Morera's work by assigning each publication to particular research field: this classification is basically adopted in the following subsections.However, Maggi's terminology is not strictly followed: a modern terminology is used when needed in order to ease the comprehension. Complex analysis A curve in a domain , as required by the statement of Morera's theorem. Morera wrote eight research works on complex analysis:According to 's classification, these works belong to \\"analytic function theory\\" i.e. \\"Teoria delle funzioni analitiche\\". the style he used for their writing probably inspired Somigliana the quotation introducing the \\"Research activity\\" section.According to himself, \\"Tipiche fra quelle sue numerose note, brevi e concettose, sono alcune che riguardano la definizione di variabile complessa\\", i.e. (English translation) \\"Typical examples of his numerous brief and pregnant notes, are some dealing with the definition of a complex variable\\". Morera's theorem, probably the best known part of his scientific research, was first proved in the paper . gives a short account of the history of the theorem, and refers also to the later paper . There Morera defines holomorphic functions using his theorem, and then derives some interesting consequences. The theorem states that if, in the complex plane ‚ÑÇ, the line integral of a given complex‚Äìvalued function satisfies the equation :\\\\oint_C f(z)\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}z = 0 for every closed curve in a given domain , then is holomorphic there. Differential equations This section includes all his works on the theory of differential equations, ordinary or partial ones: classifies this contributions as works in the theory of the equations of dynamics, in the theory of first-order partial differential equations and in the theory of exact differential equations.He precisely names this section \\"Equazioni della Dinamica, equazioni alle derivate parziali del primo ordine ed equazioni ai differenziali totali\\". He wrote twelve papers on this topic: the results he obtained in these works are well described by . In the paper he gives a very brief proof of a transformation formula for the Poisson brackets first proved by √âmile L√©onard Mathieu, while in the paper he simplifies the proof of a theorem of Francesco Siacci which is substantially equivalent to Lie's third theorem: the paper is concerned with the Pfaff problem, proving a theorem on the minimum number of integrations to be performed in order to solve the problem. Equilibrium of continuous bodies in elasticity theory classifies four of his works within the realm of elasticity theory: his contribution are well described by and by in their known monographs. The works within this section are perhaps the second best known part of his research, after his contributions to complex analysis. Mathematical analysis classifies four of his works under the locution \\"Questioni varie di Analisi\\".An English translation reads as:-\\"Various topics in mathematical analysis\\". Potential theory of harmonic functions His contribution of this topics are classified by under two sections, named respectively \\"Fondamenti della teoria della funzione potenziale\\"Literally, \\"fundamentals of the theory of the potential function\\" . and \\"Attrazione dell'elissoide e funzioni armoniche ellissoidali\\".\\"Attraction by an ellipsoid and ellipsoidal harmonics\\" . The work deals with the definition and properties of ellipsoidal harmonics and the related Lam√© functions. Rational mechanics and mathematical physics includes in this class twelve works:He classifies those works exactly as \\"Questioni varie di Meccanica e di Fisica matematica (Various topics in Mechanics and Mathematical Physics)\\" . his first published work is included among them. Varia: algebraic analysis and differential geometry This section includes the only two papers of Morera on the subject of algebraic analysisAccording to . and his unique paper on differential geometry:According to . they are, respectively, the papers , and . =Teaching activity= References , and do not say much about the teaching activity of Giacinto Morera: SomiglianaSee . describes once his teaching ability as incisive. However, his teaching is also testified by the lithographed lecture notes : according to the OPAC, this book had two editions, the first one being in 1901‚Äì1902.This first edition is the one which , and refer to.

With an estimated net worth of US$3.2 billion at the time of his death, according to Forbes, Sherman was the 12th-wealthiest Canadian. Another publication, Canadian Business, stated his fortune at CAN$4.77 billion, ranking him the 15th richest in Canada. Sherman, a University of Toronto graduate with a doctorate in engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, got his start in the pharmaceutical business in the 1960s, when the estate of his uncle Louis Lloyd Winter let him run Empire Laboratories, the late uncle's drug company. This eventually led Sherman to form Apotex, where he earned a reputation among both competitors and government regulators for extreme combativeness, often including litigation. His four cousins, who were supposed to have received 5 percent stakes in Empire, later sued Sherman unsuccessfully over his sale of Empire. In 1971 he married his wife Honey, who would later rise to prominence in Canadian philanthropy, serving on the boards of several prominent charities. The two were found slain in their home late in 2017 by unknown assailants, according to the Toronto Police, who are investigating the case. In April 2019, the police said they had a \\"working theory\\" of the case and an \\"idea of what happened\\", and as of April 2020 the investigation was \\"active and ongoing\\". Early life and education Sherman was born into a Jewish family in Toronto to Herbert Dick \\"Hyman\\" Sherman (1906‚Äì1952), a business partner for a zipper company, and Sara \\"Sarah\\" Sherman (n√©e Winter; 1910‚Äì1971), an occupational therapist after her husband's death. His grandparents from both sides had fled persecution of Jews in Russia and Poland. His father died from a heart attack when Bernard was 10. He won a national physics contest while attending the Forest Hill Collegiate Institute and graduated with top marks. In 1958, he entered the University of Toronto's engineering science program at age 16, believed to be the youngest to do so until Madeline Zhang in 2016 who entered at the age of 14. He wrote later that he chose that program specifically because it was reputedly the university's hardest. The same year, he signed up for a Canadian Army organized student militia. During summers, he worked for his uncle Louis Lloyd Winter, at his Empire Laboratories, then Canada's largest wholly owned pharmaceutical company,Parke Davis v. Empire Laboratories [1963], 41 C.P.R. 121; Parke, Davis & Co. v. Empire Laboratories Ltd., [1964] S.C.R. 351 as a driver, primarily picking up urine samples for pregnancy tests. When his uncle would travel, Sherman often helped watch over the operations. He graduated from the University of Toronto with the highest honours in his class, and received the university's Governor General's Award for his thesis. He enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to begin doctoral studies in engineering. In 1967, he completed a PhD in astrophysics from MIT. Career Sherman later recalled that his interest in business as career was piqued when he was 10. One day his father brought him to work at his zipper factory in downtown Toronto, and gave Sherman some zippers to count and box. He later wrote that his father was surprised at how well he did, filling \\"more than would have been done in the same time by any of his paid staff\\". He also recalled feeling insulted when his father counted them. In 1967, after completing his PhD, Sherman purchased the Empire Group of Companies from the executor of the estate of his aunt and uncle, Beverley and Louis Lloyd Winter, as both had died 17 days apart in November 1965, leaving four orphaned young children: Paul Timothy, Jeffrey Andrew, Kerry Joel Dexter, and Dana Charles. Empire had been the first to secure the compulsory rights to manufacture Hoffmann-La Roche's Valium (diazepam) in Canada, and was one of Canada's largest manufacturers of Pfizer's Vibramycin (doxycycline), Upjohn Company's Orinase (tolbutamide), and the dietary sweetener saccharin.Globe and Mail, November 24, 2007 The estate allowed Sherman to buy a majority stake in the company and run it only on the condition that the four Winter children be allowed to work for the company when they reached 21, with the option to buy 5 percent stakes in the company two years later, with 15-year royalties on four of its patented products. The agreement would be voided if Sherman sold Empire. That voiding happened in 1969. Sherman worked out a deal to swap shares with Empire's largest customer that put it in control of the company. In 1970 he invested in New York's Barr Laboratories with US-based partners, became its largest shareholder and served as Barr's president. He would eventually control a third of Barr's stock. Barr won the first rights to manufacture generic versions of Eli Lilly's Prozac. Today, Barr Laboratories' is a part of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, the world's largest generic drug maker, following Teva's acquisition of Barr Pharmaceuticals in 2008. In January 1972, Sherman and Ulster Limited sold Empire Laboratories to the Quebec-based Canadian operations of publicly traded International Chemical and Nuclear (ICN) of California, for 57,000 shares (Valeant Pharmaceuticals). This transaction voided his arrangement with the Winter estate. A year later, Sherman started Apotex with a few former Empire Laboratories' personnel; it was incorporated in 1974. This privately owned and Sherman-controlled company claims to be Canada's largest Canadian-owned pharmaceutical manufacturer. Sherman also became involved in Nutraceutical manufacturing and other businesses, founding NION (National Institute of Nutrition) with Richard Kashenberg. He later sold the company to Schiff and continued on to Apotex. By 2016, Apotex employed over 10,000 people as one of Canada's largest drug manufacturers, with over 260 products selling in over 115 countries. Revenues were about $1.5 billion annually. =Other businesses= Sherman also personally invested in other, non-pharmaceutical businesses. Often these had dubious prospects, and turned out to be fraudulent schemes or run by people later accused of fraud. Sherman's associates felt he was often too generous and trusting with them, failing to do proper due diligence. \\"He always saw the best in people,\\" an unidentified longtime friend told MacLean's. \\"Which wasn't a great thing all the time.\\" A yacht-chartering company he put money into turned out to be a fraud that had never bought any yachts. Later he bought a majority stake in a company that sold a nutritional supplement marketed by American Kevin Trudeau. In 1996, when U.S. regulators began investigating the fraud claims that have since led to Trudeau's imprisonment, Sherman sold half his stake to the Apotex Foundation. For 15 years Sherman also partnered with Frank D'Angelo, a fruit-juice maker who was trying to branch out into other businesses. The two produced the Cheetah Power Surge energy drink and started Steelback Brewery; when D'Angelo Brands went bankrupt in 2007, Sherman lost CAN$100 million. He put his son in charge of the company, and continued backing D'Angelo's next venture, filmmaking, even after D'Angelo was arrested on sexual assault and obstruction of justice charges, later dropped, in 2009. Sherman's money financed all eight films D'Angelo made through 2013. In the late 2010s, Sherman worked with another man later convicted of fraud, Shaun Rootenberg. The two had been introduced by a mutual friend, Myron Gottlieb, cofounder of Cineplex Odeon, who had met Rootenberg in prison following his conviction for fraud in the collapse of Livent. Rootenberg persuaded Sherman to invest in his development of an online trivia game; later Sherman filed suit against Rootenberg alleging the latter had simply pocketed the money. Personal life Sherman married Honey Reich in 1971, a fellow University of Toronto graduate born in Austria, to Polish Jewish, Holocaust survivors. They had four children, a son, Jonathon, and three daughters, Lauren, Alexandra and Kaelen. While Sherman socialized regularly with Honey, he was known to his friends and family as a workaholic. At the social events they attended, she was more outgoing, while he often kept to himself and discussed mainly his businesses. The Sherman family frequented a ski club on winter weekends, but while Honey and the children availed themselves of the trails, Barry remained in the lodge poring over documents. Similarly, he did not play golf and would spend vacations, where others went to do so, reviewing business material. Even as his fortune grew, he drove his cars until they reached an advanced state of disrepair; a friend worried that one, a Ford Mustang, was so decrepit it was leaking carbon monoxide into the passenger compartment. For his 50th birthday, Honey gave him a red sports car with a bow on it in front of assembled guests. He asked her to take it back, and she did. =Philanthropy= Sherman, with his wife, donated a record $50 million to the United Jewish Appeal, and other Jewish charities, despite Sherman himself being an atheist. They provided funds to build a major addition to the geriatric Baycrest centre, and to other Toronto-area community centres in Ontario. The couple were also major donors to the United Way. As well, the Apotex Foundation had sent over $50 million worth of medicine to disaster zones since 2007. Sherman personally often loaned money to Apotex employees who needed help. After his death, MacLean's found that Sherman himself, through one of the many companies he controlled, had made large donations to several of the foundations he had set up in his or Apotex's name. Under Canadian tax law, this entitled him to an equivalent tax credit. The foundations were then allowed to loan him back money, and did, loaning him almost the total of the $6 million he gave, an unusually high amount for Canadian private foundations that loaned out their money. The leader of a private charity watchdog group said Sherman was \\"using his foundations as a piggy bank\\" and called on Parliament to change the law. Reputation and personality Sherman had a mixed reputation, or what the National Post called \\"Two Legacies\\". Toronto Mayor John Tory said \\"Barry and Honey were kind, good people\\" and Sherman was widely praised for his philanthropic giving. On the other hand, Morton Shulman, a physician and former member of the Ontario Parliament from a similar background as Sherman who late in his life fought him over drug development, called him \\"the only person I have ever met with no redeeming features whatsoever\\". A Bloomberg writer reporting on Sherman's death said that some rival generic drug company executives used \\"unprintable\\" language to describe him. Sherman was called \\"a deplorable human being\\" in reference to his business practices, by University of Ottawa law professor Amir Attaran who claimed that he gouged Canadians with high drug prices: \\"Canadians pay more for generic drugs than almost every other country. He sought to manipulate our system to enrich himself and impoverish Canadian patients who used his drugs\\", he said. He accused Sherman of crossing intellectual property rights ethical lines to \\"fight as many as 100 battles at a time in court to challenge drug patents and make way for Apotex's generic prescriptions\\" with little end benefit to consumers. By contrast, Sherman saw Apotex as a force for good. \\"If we're thieves, we're Robin Hoods\\", he said. As told in Jeffrey Robinson's 2001 book \\"Prescription Games: Money, Ego and Power Inside the Pharmaceutical Industry\\", Sherman himself acknowledged the long-running conflict between Apotex and the major pharmaceutical companies over drug patents, saying \\"The branded drug companies hate us. They have private investigators on us all the time. The thought once came to my mind: why didn't they just hire someone to knock me off?\\" Reportedly private investigators working for the German company Bayer AG, one of the world's largest drug companies, considered planting illegal drugs in Sherman's car during an operation to lure Apotex employees into informing on whether the Canadian company was knowingly infringing Bayer's patents. =Litigation= Apotex was also much more likely than other Canadian companies to respond to adverse regulatory decisions by suing the government agencies involved. At the time of Sherman's death, his company had filed an estimated 1,200 cases against the government in Federal Court; a spokesman for Health Canada, named as a defendant in dozens of Apotex's suits, complained that the company's litigiousness had cost Canadian taxpayers millions of dollars in legal fees. \\"It was intimidating to come back from lunch and find an urgent memo on your desk saying you‚Äôve got to get over to Federal Court because Sherman was at it again,\\" recalled Michele Brill-Edwards, former Healthcan head of drug regulation. \\"He quickly demonstrated that in fact you can bully the government and you can intimidate.\\" One of Apotex's lawsuits, over the company's application to make a generic version of the antidepressant Trazodone, took 30 years until the Federal Court of Appeal ruled that the government had mishandled it. Sherman himself once told employees that Apotex was primarily a legal company that sold medications on the side. After his death, Maclean's wrote: \\"He was a billionaire driven to litigation less by money than something more primal: a sense of righteous certitude that propelled him to prevail at any cost.\\" Competitors and the government were not the only targets of Apotex and Sherman's litigation. In the 1990s, following an extension of patents that made generic drugs less profitable to produce, the company began exploring making branded drugs of its own. One of them was deferiprone, a potential treatment for the blood disorder thalassemia. Trials were overseen by U of T hematologist Dr. Nancy Olivieri at The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto. By 1998 she had serious concerns as to whether the drug was effective or safe, and broke a confidentiality agreement with Apotex to publish them. The company responded by attempting to damage her reputation and sue her; U of T took the company's side rather than risk the loss of a $20 million donation for a planned research center and removed Olivireri from her position as head of a research program on hemoglobin disorders. Eventually she regained it after years of her own litigation; the incident helped inspire John le Carr√©'s novel The Constant Gardener. In 2011, the Winter children (his cousins) sued Sherman alleging he never paid royalties and equity in Apotex, contending Sherman had used the proceeds from the 1972 sale of their late father's business Empire to buy Apotex in 1973. The cousins sought a 20 percent interest in Apotex or damages of $1 billion. Sherman responded by withdrawing millions of dollars in financial assistance to his cousins. The cousins' contended that Sherman \\"had offered the financial assistance in the first place in order to make the cousins dependent on him, and to keep them from learning about their rights to the business\\", an allegation Sherman denied. In September 2017, an Ontario Superior Court justice ruled against the cousins, saying the case was \\"wishful thinking, and beyond fanciful.\\" At the time of the judgement, a lawyer for the cousins said they would appeal, though no appeal occurred, and Sherman died a few months later. In 1996, after the Shermans' North York home was completed following five years of construction, the couple was dissatisfied with the work done on it. In particular, they claimed that the garage, a structure with a tennis court on top and a basement lap pool and hot tub, was faulty; Barry called it a \\"disaster\\". He and his wife filed 12 separate suits against all the contractors; ultimately they would recover almost the entire estimated $2.3 million cost of building the house through favourable judgements. A partial draft of his unpublished memoir, called Legacy of Thoughts, was submitted as part of Sherman's motion for summary judgment in the lawsuit brought by his orphaned cousins. He described the manuscript as his observations on philosophy, Canadian politics and the pharmaceutical industry. Sherman did not believe in God, free will, altruism or morality. \\"I find no inconsistency in holding intellectually that life has no meaning, while at the same time being highly motivated to survive and to achieve\\", he once said. Barry Sherman was targeted by the Canadian wing of the Jewish Defense League, a group on the FBI's terrorist list, and had been sued by Israel's largest generic-drug maker, Teva. =Lobbying= Sherman was also known for the vigor of his lobbying efforts. When Brian Mulroney's government passed a law in 1993 that extended patent protection for brand-name drug makers, Sherman complained that it would be destructive to smaller generic drugmakers and began supporting Jean Chr√©tien and the Liberal Party, who had promised to review the law if they took power. He also donated millions of dollars to U of T for a research center, contributions he withdrew when the letters they wrote to the government opposing the new regulations did not result in those regulations being withdrawn. In 2006, still unsatisfied, Sherman supported the campaign of Joe Volpe to become Liberal leader. He and other Apotex executives gave $108,000 to Volpe's campaign, all giving the legal maximum of $5,400. This caused some controversy when some of those donations were found to have come from minor children of the executives, although ultimately Elections Canada ruled that no laws were broken. At the time of his death, Sherman, legally registered as a lobbyist, was under investigation because of a fundraiser he had held for Justin Trudeau in April 2015, allegedly contrary to Canada's lobbying rules. Sherman filed a lawsuit in May 2016, attempting to quash the investigation before it was finished, a legally unprecedented move in Canadian history. \\"There is basis to conclude that Mr. Sherman is in breach of ... the Lobbyists' Code of Conduct as a consequence of his involvement in the organization of a fundraising event for the (Liberal Party),\\" according to Phil McIntosh, director of investigations at the Office of the Lobby Commissioner. If that had been proven, Sherman would have been banned from lobbying for five years. Death In 2017, the Shermans decided to sell their longtime home on Old Colony Road in North York and move to a new one they were building in Forest Hill, closer to downtown Toronto, where they would have as neighbours many of the people they socialized and did business with. Honey, who according to Frank D'Angelo had initiated the move, had purchased a corner lot in November 2016; the Shermans planned to demolish the existing house on the site. Plans for a replacement on file with the city called for a house with features such as a central swimming pool with retractable skylight and living quarters for staff. The 15 variances required, including the house's depth, more than twice that allowed in the city's zoning, and a car stacker in the garage, were approved in June 2017. Construction of the house, and Sherman's ultimately successful effort to recover legal fees from the Winters after their suit was decided in his favour, preoccupied the couple later in the year. They put the North York home on the market, asking almost $7 million, at the end of November, even though construction had not started on the Forest Hill house. On December 12, Honey missed a meeting of the Baycrest Centre Foundation board, without notifying them beforehand, which was unusual for her. Reached by email, she said she was \\"dealing with some stuff\\". The next day the couple met at Apotex headquarters late in the afternoon, where they went over some design changes to the new house in Barry's office. Honey was planning to leave for a holiday vacation in Miami a few days later; Barry was to join her a week later. It was the last time they were seen alive. Later that evening, after returning home, Sherman sent his Apotex staff a routine email about a drug the company was developing. He did not call anyone during that night, which they said was unusual because he frequently suffered from insomnia. The next day he did not show up at Apotex; again this was out of the ordinary for him. The next morning, December 15, neither Barry nor Honey was expected to be at home in the morning. The cleaning staff had already let themselves in with a recently installed lockbox when a pair of real estate agents arrived around mid-morning with a couple interested in the property. After showing them around the main story, the agents took the couple downstairs to the lap pool and hot tub. There they discovered on the floor next to the pool Barry and Honey's bodies. Both of their necks were tied with leather belts to a metal railing slightly over a metre high around the pool. Barry was seated, his legs crossed, on the pool deck; Honey was on her side with a bruise on her face. Coats pulled down over their shoulders restraining their arms; they were facing away from the water and fully clothed. On the second anniversary of the case, the Toronto Star reported that the positions the bodies were found in nearly matched those of two 1970s-era \\"junk\\" sculptures of human figures posed sitting on speakers in the basement. Barry's right leg was crossed over his left, just like one, however Honey's legs were not in front of her as those on the corresponding sculpture had been. The Star also reported that Honey's cell phone was found in a bathroom that according to friends she never used, suggesting she might have gone there in an attempt to summon help but was overpowered in the process. Similarly, Barry's gloves, as well as paperwork related to an inspection of the house, were left on the floor just outside the garage door, on the way to the basement pool. A window had been left open to allow a recently painted room to air out, and a basement door was unlocked, as apparently the Shermans frequently left it. Someone who may have known this, as well as the interior layout of the house, may have been able to escape through a neighboring back yard after the crime, police said. =Investigation= The police were called. The deaths were treated as \\"suspicious\\" and the Toronto Police Service Homicide Squad took the lead in the investigation, because it was \\"most experienced in dealing with sudden unexpected deaths\\". Post-mortem examinations showed the cause of both deaths was \\"ligature neck compression\\", which is ligature strangulation caused by binding or tying. Ligature strangulation is usually distinguished from hanging by the strangling force being something other than the person's own body weight. Toronto Police Service had previously told the news media that there was no indication of forced entry into the Sherman home and that their investigation did not include a search for any suspects. Although there was no note left by the deceased, police sources told the Toronto Star on December 15 or 16, 2017, that they were \\"probing the possibility that they were a murder‚Äìsuicide\\". In response, friends noted that the house had nine entrances and both Barry and Honey would have been likely to let someone in who asked for help, no matter the time of day, even if they barely knew the person or they were a complete stranger. The Sherman children issued a statement urging the police to conduct a thorough criminal investigation and chastised the police for leaking a murder-suicide theory. They also contacted Toronto lawyer Brian Greenspan to retain a private investigator to look into the deaths. He hired Tom Klett, a retired Toronto Police detective who has worked in the homicide, drug, and intelligence bureaus. The family also hired Dr. David Chiasson, the retired chief forensic pathologist for Ontario, to conduct another autopsy. In January 2018, the Toronto Star published an exclusive report based on anonymous sources from the family's investigation team who said that the deaths were murders: the couple was strangled by belts after their hands were tied. These investigators had not yet gained access to the Sherman home. \\"People providing information for this story are not identified as they were not authorized to discuss the case,\\" according to the Star. When contacted by a reporter, a Toronto Police spokesman reiterated the position that they were treating the deaths as \\"suspicious\\". On January 26, Toronto Police advised the news media that their investigation concluded that the couple had been killed in a targeted attack. At the time, they would not discuss any possible suspects, but planned to interview everyone who had access to the home prior to the deaths via the lockbox that was previously installed by the real estate agent. The police investigation has encountered resistance at Apotex headquarters, with a police spokesman saying \\"Legal complexities in some executions have been challenging given the litigious nature of Barry Sherman's businesses, in particular the search and seizure of electronics in Barry Sherman's workspace at Apotex\\". The police investigation was still continuing in September 2018 when detectives obtained seven search warrants in addition to the 21 previously obtained. Detective Dennis Yim told a court that \\"investigators are methodically reviewing material and pursuing different investigative avenues\\". In late October 2018, lawyer Brian Greenspan announced that the family had offered a $10 million reward in the couple's homicide investigation for any information that leads to the arrest and prosecution of a suspect. At the same time, he complained about the police investigation, claiming that it had failed to collect important evidence. Police Chief Mark Saunders later told the news media that a forensic pathologist has been working on the case, in addition to over 50 officers, interviewing 200 witnesses and collecting over 2,000 hours of video surveillance from neighbouring homes. When asked if police would be willing to work with the independent experts to be convened by Greenspan, Saunders said he would if the group were to be accepted in a court proceeding. By October 2018, police had obtained 37 warrants related to the investigation. On April 25, 2019, the Toronto Police said they had a \\"working theory\\" of the case, and an \\"idea of what happened.\\" At the end of 2019, the private investigators working for the family closed their investigation. The following month, Star reporter Kevin Donovan, who had just published a book, The Billionaire Murders about the case, disclosed that investigators had revised their timeline of the case. While previous statements had suggested police believed the couple had been killed early on December 15, they now said the murders had occurred two days earlier, within hours of the Shermans returning home on the night of the 13th. =Possible suspects= No suspects or persons of interest have as yet been publicly identified. That has not stopped speculation about who might have been responsible, particularly given Sherman's many business associates with criminal records and those who had been angered by his actions. He himself had acknowledged that an attempt could be made on his life. \\"For a thousand bucks paid to the right person, you can probably get someone killed\\", he told Jeffrey Robinson in an interview for his book in the late 1990s. \\"Perhaps I'm surprised that hasn't happened.\\" At the time of the homicides Sherman had just won a ruling that the Winters owed him $300,000 in legal fees, less than he had asked for, for their lawsuit, itself dismissed three months earlier. After telling Bloomberg that he'd been informed he was a \\"prime suspect\\" and consulting with his lawyer, Kerry Winter allowed that he had not only the motive to kill his cousin but the opportunity, since he was working at the time as a construction supervisor and could set his own hours. He admitted to The Fifth Estate that he had imagined killing Sherman but says that he did not, and was watching Peaky Blinders on Netflix, then attending a Cocaine Anonymous meeting that night. Also mentioned as possibly having a motive to kill Sherman is Frank D'Angelo, given the long history between the two and the latter man's checkered legal history. In his interview with Bloomberg, he said \\"The worst thing that could have happened to Frank D'Angelo is Barry dying\\" and expressed regret that he had not been able to save a man he regarded as a close friend. He believed that \\"somebody came to make Barry an offer he couldn't refuse, and he refused\\". Legacy In June 2019, persons close to the Shermans said Barry had planned to give to charity or invest much of his fortune. Trustees for the Sherman family fought to keep details of the estate secret. In Canada, court documents and related proceedings‚Äîincluding files that deal with an estate after death‚Äîare public. An Ontario Superior Court judge applied a \\"protective order\\" to the file, but media in Canada appealed and won. The family appealed to the Supreme Court.

It extends for as a two-lane road from an intersection with U.S. Route 11 (US 11), NY 3, and NY 12 in downtown Watertown to a junction with NY 342 in the town of Le Ray. The route passes through mostly rural areas, with the exception of a dense commercial district around the highway's west end. NY 283 is one of three routes directly connecting Watertown's Public Square to Fort Drum; the others are US 11 and NY 3, which loosely parallel NY 283 between the two locations. The portion of the route outside of the Watertown city limits was originally maintained by Jefferson County as part of County Route 52 (CR 52), a highway extending from Watertown to Felts Mills. CR 52 became a state highway in 1979 and was designated as part of NY 283 in the 1980s, with the route continuing west over locally maintained streets to serve downtown Watertown. The portion of the route within Fort Drum was given to the post by the early 1990s, at which time NY 283 was truncated to its current length. Route description NY 283 eastbound in Watertown NY 283 begins in downtown Watertown, where it meets US 11, NY 3, and NY 12 at the city's Public Square. The two-lane route departs US 11 and NY 12 at a 45-degree angle and maintains a northeasterly routing through a commercialized part of the city as Factory Street. It parallels the southern bank of the Black River to the eastern edge of the downtown district, where the highway crosses the waterway by way of Sewalls Island and becomes known as Pearl Street. On the opposite riverbank, NY 283 serves another brief stretch of businesses before leaving the city limits and entering the town of Pamelia. Here, the line of commercial properties gives way to open, rolling fields as the route heads northeastward across the southern part of the town. The highway serves little more than a handful of isolated homes and businesses before curving slightly northward at the Pamelia‚ÄìLe Ray town line. Across the town line in Le Ray, NY 283 continues to run across largely undeveloped rolling terrain, passing a small number of scattered residences. Most of these lie on the outskirts of the small hamlet of Calcium, located to the northwest of NY 283 on US 11, which loosely parallels the former through Pamelia and Le Ray. NY 283 remains on a northeasterly track to the vicinity of Fort Drum, where the route bends eastward ahead of a rural junction with NY 342 at the western edge of the military reservation. NY 283 terminates here while Pearl Street continues into the post as a four-lane divided highway named Pearl Street Road. History NY 283 eastbound in Le Ray The part of Pearl Street outside the Watertown city limits was originally maintained by Jefferson County as part of CR 52, which continued east from NY 342 on Pearl Street Road and Gray Street to an intersection with NY 3 in the hamlet of Felts Mills. On August 1, 1979, ownership and maintenance of CR 52 was transferred from the county to the state of New York as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. The new state highway was designated NY 283 in the 1980s. The designation also continued west into Watertown along city- maintained portions of Pearl and Factory streets to Mill Street. By 1993, maintenance of Pearl Street within Fort Drum was turned over to the military reservation. NY 283 was truncated to end at NY 342 at the western limits of the post while the piece of Pearl Street between the Fort Drum limits and Felts Mills was redesignated as NY 971V, an unsigned reference route in length.

History  It was Wales' only long-term, mature-student residential education college and was established in 1927 by Thomas Jones, Deputy Secretary to the Cabinet under four prime ministers including David Lloyd George and Stanley Baldwin, to continue the work of Workers' Educational Association in a residential environment, with Ben Bowen Thomas as its first warden. Plas Wernfawr was acquired at a knock-down price from a seller sympathetic to the project to be the base for the college. Starting with just six students, mostly from the South Wales Coalfield area, numbers increased to 30 in the 1930s, 70 in the 1960s, serving the whole of Wales. Then, with Ieuan Jeffries-Jones as warden, Coleg Harlech began offering a two-year diploma course validated by the University of Wales, which became a preparation for university education for those who had missed out on earlier education: it became well known as a \\"second chance\\" college, often for people who, for economic or social reasons, never had a first chance. By the 1980s and 1990s, higher education institutions generally were growing, and expanding access opportunities wider than before. This began to threaten Coleg Harlech‚Äôs niche, and ultimately Coleg Harlech, once funded as a unique institution in Wales, came under the funding regime with other further education colleges, and became less distinctive.‚ÄùMiraculousy Unfolding Possibilities‚Äù:Coleg Harlech and Residential Adult Education, 1927‚Äì2007 in England (ed.), 2007 Coleg Harlech always had a close association with the WEA and merged with WEA (North Wales) in 2001 to become Coleg Harlech Workers' Educational Association North Wales (CHWEAN); CHWEAN subsequently evolved via two further mergers into Adult Learning Wales, which operated the site until its sale in 2019. The college's residential students were once supported financially by bursaries from the Welsh Government, previously the Welsh Office, but as access to higher and further education widenened and the college's provision became less distinctive, these came to an end, in effect bringing about the termination of residential courses. In February 2017 it was announced that Coleg Harlech would be closing as an adult education site at the end of the academic year. It was sold to local businessman Leslie Banks Irvine in April 2019, but then put on sale again in September that year as four properties with a total asking price of around ¬£630,000. = Name = The institution has always been named, simply, Coleg Harlech: there is no ‚ÄòEnglish version‚Äô of the name even though it translates as 'Harlech College'.  Buildings  = Plas Wernfawr = The campus is centred on Plas Wernfawr, a house originally built in 1907‚Äì08 for George Davison, and designed in Arts and Crafts style by the radical architect George Henry Walton. The building is in simple classical style, built of dressed blocks of local grey stone. The east front demonstrates strong horizontal lines, formed by two rows of sash windows, a projecting dentilated string course at eaves height forming the base of a pediment which contains a central oculus.Haslam, Orbach and Voelker 2009 ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Buildings of Wales: Gwynedd‚Äô‚Äô Pevsner Architectural Guides, Yale University Press, p. 615Gwynedd Archaeological Trust, Historical Environment Record PRN 35122 Walton also laid out the garden.

The forecourt and garden structures on the inland side are listed Grade II. = Art collection = Plas Wernfawr once held a collection of artworks which had been donated or purchased by the college over the years.The Public Catalogue Foundation (2013) Oil Paintings in Public Ownership in North and Mid-Wales, pp. 203‚Äì206 However, a financial crisis at the college in 2013 forced the sale of these artefacts and many rare books from the college library. = Theatre = The Great Hall, part of Walton's original design, was destroyed by fire in 1968. It was replaced by a Brutalist theatre building, designed by Colwyn Foulkes & Partners. The theatre building was opened as Theatr Ardudwy in 1973 but subsequently changed its name to Theatr Harlech. It was operated by a separate body from the college until the Coleg closed its doors to learners in 2017. = Other buildings = The campus also includes a Gymnasium built c. 1970 to designs by Colwyn FoulkesGwynedd Archaeological Trust, Historical Environment Record PRN 35127 and an Amenity Centre, designed in 1985 by the Percy Thomas Partnership.Gwynedd Archaeological Trust, Historical Environment Record PRN 35128 Other buildings including a concrete tower block once used for accommodation and Wern Fach, once the Warden's residence.

He belongs to the group of theologian- jurists known as the School of Salamanca (otherwise identified as Spanish Late Scholasticism). Life Alfonso de Castro entered, at the age of 15, the Franciscan Order and quickly became known as a good preacher. After his studies of theology and philosophy at the University of Alcal√° which was established in these years, he became professor at the famous University of Salamanca, where, next to Luis Carvajal and Francisco de Vitoria, he founded the \\"Renaissance of Theology\\". According to his commitment in Bruges in 1532 against the doctrine of the Lutherans, he became counselor of emperor Charles V and of the Spanish king Philip II. As he took part in the Council of Trent in 1545-47 and again in 1551-52 he appeared to advocate both the Spanish- imperial interests and the Catholic faith. Philip II, whom Castro accompanied in 1553 and 1554 to his marriage in England, nominated him in 1557 as Archbishop of Santiago de Compostela, but Castro did not assume that office. In his last years, Castro acted as a preacher in Antwerp. Works In his works Castro attended himself, basically, to the defense of \\"true faith\\" through criminal law. He gave enormous systematic impulses to the criminal law, so that in Spanish literature he was called the \\"father and founder of criminal law\\" - padre y fundador del Derecho Penal. Outside of Spain, however, Castro remains nearly unknown. His first work, Adversus omnes haereses libri XIV (Paris 1534, Antwerp 1556), an alphabetical encyclopedia of heresy, collocates more than 400 species of this crime. This became one of the foundations of persecution of heretics in the 16th and 17th centuries. It was translated into the French language in 1712. Castro second opus, De iusta hereticorum punitione libri III (Salamanca 1547), dedicated to emperor Charles V, made him renowned as \\"flagellum of heretics\\" (azote de herejes). With theological and juristic principles therein he tried to define the golden mean between Pharisaic damnation and craven sufferance of heresy, the form of reversal to \\"true faith\\", the punishment of obstinacy and the socio-religious causes of heresy. The equalisation of heresy and magics is the subject of Castro's short commentary on the \\"Malleus Maleficarum\\" with the title De impia sortilegarum, Maleficarum, & Lamiarum haeresi, earumque punitione Opvscvlvm (Lyon 1568). He held that magics as a sort of heresy should be punished by death by fire. The pact with the demons, which is against Catholic faith, should clearly be explored. Castro's chief work in criminal law, however, may be his last publication, De potestate legis poenalis libri duo (Salamanca 1550, Reprint Madrid 1961). This work in detail deals with the notion of the criminal laws (in the meaning of \\"lex\\"), with nature and purpose of penalty and with the relations of delict and penalty. Castro therein presents not only the prescription of analogy and the principle of restrictive interpretation in criminal law, but, with his own radicalness, he acuminates the notion of penalty (poena) completely to the penalty for guilt, and, accordingly and for the first time in history, fits penalty with moral blame. His notion of penalty survives through the canonists Martin de Azpilcueta and Diego de Covarubias y Leyva in secular criminal law. After his death the collected works were published in Paris 1565 in four volumes.

The film follows two energy drink salesmen who are ordered to perform 150 hours of community service as punishment for various offenses. For their service, the two men work at a program designed to pair kids with adult role models. The film stars Seann William Scott, Rudd, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Bobb'e J. Thompson, Jane Lynch and Elizabeth Banks. Plot Danny and Wheeler are salesmen who promote an energy drink called \\"Minotaur\\" in an attempt to encourage schoolchildren to stay off drugs. While Wheeler loves the job, Danny views it as a pointless, dead-end job, causing him to be depressed and jaded. Danny's uncouth behavior also results in the collapse of his relationship with his girlfriend Beth, who breaks up with him after he impulsively proposed to her. After an awry presentation at an elementary school, the duo find their Minotaur truck being towed, as they were parked in a no-parking zone. Danny drives their truck free of the tow truck, damaging it and nearly running over a security guard and crashing into a statue. Danny and Wheeler are arrested and charged with assault and disorderly conduct. Beth strikes a deal with the judge in which the guys have to log 150 hours of community service over the next 30 days, in lieu of 30 days in jail. They are to complete their service with Sturdy Wings, a big brother-big sister program led by Gayle Sweeny, a recovering addict. Gayle is aware of their court mandate and warns them that if they fail to meet her requirements they will be sent to prison. Wheeler is paired up with Ronnie Shields, a vulgar young boy who has driven away all the other \\"Bigs\\" he has been paired with. Danny is assigned Augie Farks, a shy teenager obsessed with medieval live action role-playing games. Danny is unable to find common ground with Augie, while Ronnie takes a disliking to Wheeler. Danny considers giving up and choosing the jail sentence, but Wheeler insists that if they go to jail, they will get raped. They gradually bond with their \\"littles\\"; Ronnie and Wheeler share the experience of having been abandoned by their fathers, while Danny learns about Augie's medieval fantasy realm. Ronnie takes an interest in Wheeler's favorite band, Kiss, and discovers that Wheeler shares his obsession with female breasts, which Wheeler teaches him to control. Danny and Augie bond when they realize that they are both involved in the Sturdy Wings program against their will. Danny joins Augie's live action role playing game Live Action Interactive Role-playing Explorers (LAIRE) and unsuccessfully reconciles with Beth, who explains she must commit to the break-up because \\"it is for the best\\". However, their good luck is short-lived. When Augie manages to sneak up on the King of LAIRE, Argotron, the King lies and tells everyone that he killed Augie. Defending Augie, Danny confronts and shoves the King, getting Augie and himself banned from LAIRE permanently. Later, Danny insults Augie's mother and her boyfriend for refusing to support Augie's hobby, earning their hatred. As soon as Augie's parents kick Danny out of their house, Danny retorts, \\"I'd be psyched if he was my kid.\\" Meanwhile, Wheeler takes Ronnie to a party and leaves him unsupervised, resulting in Ronnie walking home alone and a series of angry messages from Ronnie's mother, Karen, on Wheeler's cellphone. Ronnie and Augie's parents ask Sturdy Wings for new mentors, and Danny and Wheeler are expelled from the program, thus failing to complete their community service. Beth says that she will defend Danny and Wheeler in court, but cannot make any promises, as they will most likely be sent to jail. Danny and Wheeler argue and go their separate ways. Danny convinces King Argotron to allow himself and Augie to fight in the much- awaited battle royale. Wheeler gets permission from Karen to hang out with Ronnie after he gets out of jail, and earns Ronnie's forgiveness. However, the King secretly warns the other members of Augie's LAIRE \\"country\\" of Xanthia that allowing Augie to fight with them will lead to severe retribution in the game. They call Augie to tell him he is too much of a liability and he has nowhere to turn. To form a new LAIRE country, Danny and Augie need four members and matching costumes. Danny asks Wheeler and Ronnie to join them. They arrive with Wheeler's Kiss costumes and a Kiss-themed Minotaur truck, naming their new country \\"Kiss-My-Anthia\\". After a betrayal by his former Xanthian allies, Augie finally duels with the king, defeating him. Sarah, a hidden player who goes by Esplen in LAIRE, attacks and defeats Augie; she is crowned the new queen and chooses Augie as her king-consort. Augie's parents forgive Danny. Impressed with having seen that Wheeler and Danny care for the children, Gayle clears their names with the judge. Danny serenades Beth with a rendition of the Kiss song \\"Beth\\" and they happily reconcile.

During promotion for the film Knocked Up, Paul Rudd revealed that shooting on Big Brothers was on hiatus while the script was being retooled. News was later revealed that Rudd was commissioned to write a new draft of the script and David Wain had signed on to direct. Wain later revealed the film was now titled Little Big Men. UniversalPictures.com listed the film under the final title Role Models, which made its release on November 7, 2008. It was pre-screened at the University of Maryland's Hoff Theater on October 30, 2008 to positive accord. A running gag in the film is a song entitled \\"Love Take Me Down (to the Streets)\\", which is claimed by Martin to be by the band Wings. In the initial scene at the Sturdy Wings building, Martin begins singing the song, which he claims is \\"one of their hits from the '70s\\", a fact which Danny denies. This is a minor recurring joke throughout the film. During the credits, the song plays and is listed on the film soundtrack as being performed by \\"Not Wings.\\" The song was written by Charles Gansa, a composer who worked on the film, and A. D.

The deceased is shown above the central niche in front of a table of offerings, and inscriptions listing offerings for the deceased are carved along the side panels. A false door, or recessed niche,\\"The term false door (also ka-door, false- door stela, fausse- porte, Scheintiir) denotes an architectural element that is found mostly in private tomb structures of the Old Kingdom (mastabas and rock-cut tombs): a recessed niche, either in the western wall of the offering chamber, or in the eastern tomb facade. It imitates the most important parts of an Egyptian door, but the niche offers no real entrance to any interior space. Such fictitious doors are also attested in other architectural contexts\\" in is an artistic representation of a door which does not function like a real door. They can be carved in a wall or painted on it. They are a common architectural element in the tombs of ancient Egypt, but appeared possibly earlier in some Pre-Nuragic Sardinian tombs. Later they also occur in Etruscan tombs and in the time of ancient Rome they were used in the interiors of both houses and tombs. Mesopotamian origin Egyptian architecture was influenced by Mesopotamian precedents, as it adopted element of Mesopotamian Temple and civic architecture. Nancy H. Demand is Professor Emerita in the Department of History, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana. These exchanges were part of Egypt- Mesopotamia relations since the 4th millenium BCE. Recessed niches were characteristic of Mesopotamian Temple architecture, and were adopted in Egyptian architecture, especially for the design of false doors in Mastaba tombs, during the First Dynasty and the Second Dynasty, from the time of the Naqada III period (circa 3000 BCE). It is unknown is the transfer of this design was the result of Mesopotamian workmen in Egypt, or if temple designs appearing on imported Mesopotamian seals may have been a sufficient source of inspiration for Egyptian architects. Ancient Egypt A false door from the First Intermediate Period The ancient Egyptians believed that the false door was a threshold between the worlds of the living and the dead and through which a deity or the spirit of the deceased could enter and exit. The false door was usually the focus of a tomb's offering chapel, where family members could place offerings for the deceased on a special offering slab placed in front of the door. Most false doors are found on the west wall of a funerary chapel or offering chamber because the Ancient Egyptians associated the west with the land of the dead. In many mastabas, both husband and wife buried within have their own false door. =Structure= A false door usually is carved from a single block of stone or plank of wood, and it was not meant to function as a normal door. Located in the center of the door is a flat panel, or niche, around which several pairs of door jambs are arranged‚Äîsome convey the illusion of depth and a series of frames, a foyer, or a passageway. A semi-cylindrical drum, carved directly above the central panel, was used in imitation of the reed-mat that was used to close real doors. The door is framed with a series of moldings and lintels as well, and an offering scene depicting the deceased in front of a table of offerings usually is carved above the center of the door. Sometimes, the owners of the tomb had statues carved in their image placed into the central niche of the false door. =Historical development= The mortuary complex of Djoser at Saqqara shows the palace fa√ßade motif from which the false door motif is derived. The configuration of the false door, with its nested series of doorjambs, is derived from the niched palace fa√ßade and its related slab stela, which became a common architectural motif in the early Dynastic period. The false door was used first in the mastabas of the Third Dynasty of the Old Kingdom (c. 27th century BCE) and its use became nearly universal in tombs of the fourth through sixth dynasties. During the nearly one hundred and fifty years spanning the reigns of the sixth Dynasty pharaohs Pepi I, Merenre, and Pepi II, the false door motif went through a sequential series of changes affecting the layout of the panels, allowing historians to date tombs based on which style of false door was used. After the First Intermediate Period, the popularity of the false doors diminished, being replaced by stelae as the primary surfaces for writing funerary inscriptions. =Inscriptions= False door of Senenmut, the steward of Queen Hatshepsut. New Kingdom, 18th Dynasty, 1480-1460 BCE. From Western Thebes, Egypt. Neues Museum, Berlin The side panels usually are covered in inscriptions naming the deceased along with their titles, and a series of standardized offering formulas. These texts extol the virtues of the deceased and express positive wishes for the afterlife. For example, the false door of Ankhires reads: The lintel reads: The left and right outer jambs read: Prehistoric Sardinia Pre-Nuragic false door topped with bull horns, from Putifigari Carved or painted Pre- Nuragic false doors appear in about 20 tombs mostly located in northwestern Sardinia, an example being some of the Domus de Janas of the necropolis of Anghelu Ruju, which are variously datable from the Ozieri to the Bonnanaro cultures of Pre-Nuragic Sardinia (c.3200 ‚Äì 1600 BCE). These false doors, apparently resulting from a strong Eastern influence, usually appear on the back wall of the main chamber, and are represented by horizontal and vertical frames and a projecting lintel. Sometimes the door is topped with painted or carved U-shaped bull horns, inscribed inside each other in a variable number.Monte Siseri o S'Incantu - Putifigari. neroargento.com Unlike the Egyptian ones, the meaning of pre-Nuragic false doors is less clear. It has been argued that these represents the passageway to the afterlife that definitively separate the deceased from the living loved ones, also preventing a possible return. Alternatively, it is possible that these false doors are simply clues of the plan of the corresponding former house of the deceased. Etruria Tomb of the Charontes, Monterozzi necropolis, Tarquinia In Etruscan tombs the false door has a Doric design and is always depicted closed. Most often it is painted, but on some occasions it is carved in relief, like in the Tomb of the Charontes at Tarquinia. Unlike the false door in ancient Egyptian tombs, the Etruscan false door has given rise to a diversity of interpretations. It might have been the door the underworld, similar to its use of the ancient Egypt. It could have been used to mark the place where a new doorway and chamber would be carved for future expansion of the tomb. Another possibility is that it is the door of the tomb itself, as seen from outside. In the Tomb of the Augurs at Tarquinia two men are painted to the left and right of a false door. Their gestures of lamentation indicate that the deceased were considered to be behind the door. Ancient Rome Fresco of a false door in the Roman Villa Poppaea Painted doors were used frequently in the decoration of both First- and Second style interiors of Roman villas. An example is the villa of Julius Polybius in Pompeii, where a false door is painted on a wall opposite a real door to achieve symmetry.

Topf and Sons () was an engineering company, founded in 1878 in Erfurt, Germany by Johannes Andreas Topf (1816‚Äì1891). Originally, it made heating systems and brewing and malting equipment. Later, the company diversified into silos, chimneys, incinerators for burning municipal waste, and crematoria. During World War I it made weapons shells, limbers (carts for carrying artillery) and other military vehicles. In World War II it also made weapons shells and aircraft parts for the Luftwaffe.Sch√ºle, Annegret (2017) J.A Topf & S√∂hne: ein Erfurter Familieunternehmen und der Holocaust.

Topf & S√∂hne's main competitor in making concentration camp ovens was the Berlin firm , founded in 1887. At its peak Topf & S√∂hne was the largest company of its type in the world. It sold its products globally; as far afield as Russia, Asia, North and South America, Australia, and New Zealand. In the 1940s, less than 2% of its total business came from its concentration camp contracts.Stiftung Gedenkst√§tten Buchenwald und Mittelbau-Dora (2005)The engineers of the \\"final solution\\".

In addition to Auschwitz and Auschwitz II‚ÄìBirkenau, Topf & S√∂hne also built crematoria ovens for Buchenwald, Dachau, Mauthausen-Gusen, Mogilev ghetto, and the Gross-Rosen concentration camp. Out of the five ovens at Dachau concentration camp, four were made by H. Kori and one by Topf & S√∂hne. In all, Topf built 25 crematoria ovens which had a total of 76 incineration chambers (called 'muffles') for concentration camps. H. Kori built 42 single chamber ovens at various camps.Schule, Annegret (ed.) (2017) Industrie und Holocaust: Topf & S√∂hne ‚Äì Die Ofenbauer von Auschwitz. Berlin: Hentrich und Hentrich Verlag. Epithets such as 'the engineers of the final solution' and 'the technicians of mass murder' have been applied to T√∂pf & S√∂hne, because, to a greater extent than its competitors, it used its considerable expertise to assist the Nazi regime to make mass execution into an efficient, industrial process. Without its complicity, the SS site managers of Auschwitz would not have had the ability on their own to plan and build the crematoria, which were an essential part of the mass murder process. From 1941, Topf & S√∂hne used forced labour in its factory, as did many other German firms in the Nazi period. At least 620 foreigners were forced to work for the company. These people received wages, but they were paid 25‚Äì30% less than the German employees. After the war, the company was confiscated and nationalised by the Soviet administration. The company's history was not fully researched until after German reunification in 1990.Topf and Sons memorial site. The site and its history .

Retrieved 12 July 2017 Early history An 1891 advert for a Topf & S√∂hne patented brewery heating system, listing companies who had bought some of the 600 units already sold. When Johannes Topf founded the firm on 1 July 1878 he was already 62 years old. He owned his own brewery and had also worked in the fuel technology industry. He established the new company to sell a system for heating brewing coppers which he had invented and patented. He had four sons: Gustav (1853‚Äì1893); Albert (1857‚Äì1896); Max Julius Ernst, known as Julius (1859‚Äì1914) and Wilhelm Louis, known as Ludwig, (1863‚Äì1914). A fifth son died in childhood. He founded the firm against the advice of his sons, although the younger two sons, Julius and Ludwig, joined him. By 1885 J.A. Topf & S√∂hne was producing heating, brewing and malting systems and working collaboratively with other firms to sell products all over Germany and beyond. The two older brothers also joined the company in the late 1880s, but they both died by the mid-1890s; Gustav, aged 40 and Albert, aged 39. Johannes Topf died in 1891, and in 1904 Julius Topf stepped down to become a sleeping partner due to ill health, leaving Ludwig managing it on his own. The company began manufacturing incinerators for burning municipal waste and, from 1914, crematoria for local authorities, due to the increasing acceptability of cremation as a means of body disposal. By 1914, it was one of the largest firms of its type in the world, employing over 500 staff and exporting to 50 countries.Montag, Andreas (27 January 2016) Erfurter Firma Topf & S√∂hne Techniker der Todesfabrik in Mitteldeutsche Zeitung. Retrieved 1 August 2017. Ludwig Topf was wealthy and successful, but committed suicide in February 1914, aged 51, due to the stress of running the business. His brother Julius died of blood poisoning later the same year. With the second generation of the Topf brothers all dead, Else Topf (1882‚Äì1940), Ludwig's widow, became the owner. The firm's senior managers already had a lot of independence and operations continued without any major upheaval. It prospered during World War I due to contracts for weapons shells and military vehicles. Third generation Ludwig and Else Topf had three children: Johanna, known as Hanna, (1902‚Äì?); Ludwig (1903‚Äì1945), and Ernst Wolfgang (1904‚Äì1979). When their father died, the two sons, aged 10 and 9, were sent away to a boarding school. The brothers later became the owners and managers of the firm during the Nazi period. After leaving school, Ludwig studied machine engineering at the Technische Hochschule Hannover, now the University of Hannover. After graduating from Hannover, he spent a further five years at Leipzig, Berlin and Rostock universities, studying a wide range of subjects, including economics, law, and sociology. Ernst also studied at Hannover, but took business studies. He returned Erfurt to do two six-month internships, one in a bank and another in a malting company. He then joined Ludwig in Leipzig, studying at the Handelshochschule, now the Leipzig Graduate School of Management, graduating in 1929. In 1929, Ernst was employed at Topf & S√∂hne, and in 1931 Ludwig also joined the firm. In the early 1930s, due to the economic crisis of the Weimar Republic, the company lost business to such an extent that by Spring 1933 it was in danger of bankruptcy. Because of this, at the end of 1932, the brothers were made redundant. They were banned from the company site, due to a rift with their mother, who would not speak to them, and because of political problems. Elsa Topf was also estranged from her daughter, whose marriage she disapproved of. This was happening against a backdrop of rising Nazism. The Nazi party first gained seats in the German parliament in 1928. In the 1932 elections they became the second largest party; Hitler became chancellor in March 1933.Kolb, Eberhard (2005) The Weimar Republic. London/New York: Routledge The influence of Nazi staff within the firm also grew. The Topf brothers wanted to return and manage the firm, but at a company works council meeting on 30 January 1933, they were labelled \\"Judengenossen\\" (friends of Jews) and not suitable to lead the company. Else Topf supported this stance. The brothers, like their father, did have many good relationships with Jewish friends, neighbours and business contacts. However, for appearances sake, they were persuaded to join the Nazi party, in April 1933. The ambitious engineer Kurt Pr√ºfer joined at the same time. They were then permitted to return and were appointed joint managers, with Ludwig as the technical manager, and Ernst as the business manager.

Retrieved 6 August 2017. Kurt Pr√ºfer, the head of Topf & S√∂hne's small crematoria department, was the main oven designer. He developed a two-muffle transportable oven in September 1939, which was delivered to Dachau concentration camp in November 1939. A 'muffle' is the incineration chamber where the body is put. In order to improve the speed at which bodies burned, the muffles were internally joined, resulting in the ashes of individual bodies being mixed. This was illegal, but all subsequent multi-muffle ovens built for the concentration camps were designed in the same way. A further four, single-muffle ovens were built at Dachau by Topf & S√∂hne's competitor H. Kori. Initially, Buchenwald camp, which opened in July 1937, sent bodies to the local Weimar city crematorium. From April 1938 to March 1939, 90% of all cremations at Weimar came from Buchenwald. The unusually high numbers looked suspicious, so the SS wanted their own on-site facilities, although it was illegal for crematoria to be outside of local authority control.Zimmerman, John C. (1999)Body Disposal at Auschwitz: The End of Holocaust Denial. Retrieved 6 August 2017. A Topf transportable, double- muffle oven was delivered in winter 1939/40, and two, three-muffle stationary ovens were ordered. As with all Topf & S√∂hne stationary ovens, the parts were made in the factory in Erfurt, and the firm's staff went on site to build them, often spending months at the camps. One staff member, Martin Holich, spent almost 12 months in 1942‚Äì43 installing and repairing equipment at Auschwitz-Birkenau. The muffles of the concentration camp ovens were smaller than those for civil crematoria, because no space for a coffin was needed, which saved both space and fuel. Pr√ºfer later designed ovens with muffles large enough for multiple bodies to be burned simultaneously. Later, in Topf & S√∂hne's instructions on using the ovens, they advised adding bodies to the muffles at 20-minute intervals as the previous body burned down. Bodies were often pushed in four, five or even six at once.Auschwitz-Birkenau Crematoria: Civilian Ovens Comparison (2016). Emory Center for Digital Scholarship. Retrieved 6 August 2017. In addition to making ovens for Buchenwald, Auschwitz and Dachau, Topf & S√∂hne also supplied a transportable double-muffle oven and a stationary double-muffle oven for Mauthausen-Gusen, a triple-muffle oven at Gro√ü-Rosen and a four-muffle oven at Mogilev ghetto. It is also thought that they supplied transportable ovens to at least one of the Nazi euthanasia institutions, in which a total of over 70,000 physically and mentally disabled people were murdered in 1940 and 1941. =Auschwitz I and II= From August 1940 to May 1942, Topf & S√∂hne built three double-muffle ovens at Auschwitz Camp I. In October 1941, the SS placed an order for five three-muffle ovens for the new Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp (Auschwitz II), where it was initially estimated that over 1000 people per day would die. The SS were holding 125,000 Soviet prisoners of war in Auschwitz II, and it was calculated that with the use of the new ovens, they could all be killed and disposed of in about four months. The first transport of Jews arrived at Auschwitz II on 15 February 1942. To deal with the increased demand for body disposal, Topf & S√∂hne installed a further two 8-muffle ovens in September 1942. An additional five triple-muffle ovens were installed at Auschwitz II by mid-March 1943.Holocaust Education & Archive Research Team (2007)Auschwitz Concentration Camp. The Gas Chambers & Crematoria Mass Extermination. Retrieved 6 August 2017. It was calculated that all four of Auschwitz II's crematoria had the capacity to cremate a total of 8000 bodies per day, although the actual numbers were usually lower. From 1942 until spring 1944 about 1000 people per day were transported to Auschwitz, although not all of them were killed. In the summer of 1944, almost 440,000 Hungarian Jews were transported to the camp and during this period up to 9,000 bodies per day, and sometimes as many as 10,000 per day, were cremated in the ovens, as well as in outdoor burning pits. Crematorium IV was out of use from May 1943, after only two months of service, because it developed cracks. From March 1943 until November 1944, nearly 1 million people were murdered and disposed of at the camp. Observations, innovations and patent applications In December 1939, a patent application was made for Pr√ºfer's double-muffle transportable cremation unit, although it was not approved, possibly because of the legal problem of ash mixing. On 26 October 1942, the engineer Fritz Sander, Pr√ºfer's manager, applied for a patent for what he called a \\"continuous operation corpse incineration oven for mass use\\". This was a four-storey oven designed for Auschwitz II. The idea was that the bodies would be loaded by a type of conveyor belt and the heat of the bodies already in the oven would ignite them, thus, after an initial heating period, it would remain in continuous operation without the need for any further fuel ‚Äì the heat of burning corpses would keep the apparatus running. Pr√ºfer and Sander, who disliked each other and competed with one another, disagreed about how well the device would work in practice. It was never built.Topf & Sons as Partners of the SS. The Patent Application on Topf & Sons Remembrance Site website . Retrieved 6 August 2017. =Gas chamber exhaust fans= Auschwitz gas chamber, 2003 In early 1943, the Topf & S√∂hne fitter Heinrich Messing installed exhaust fans in the Auschwitz II crematoria and also in the gas chambers. Initially, the process of gassing prisoners and then letting fresh air into the gas chambers lasted several hours, but after the exhaust fans were installed this was reduced to about an hour, thus reducing the turn around time. =On site observations= Topf & S√∂hne engineers and other staff visited the concentration camps many times, not only to install and repair equipment, but also to observe processes to help make them more efficient. Before crematoria II, III and IV at Auschwitz II were officially put into operation, on 5 March 1943, in the presence of high-ranking SS officers from Berlin, camp authorities and Topf & S√∂hne staff, a test of crematorium II was held to measure the speed at which bodies could be disposed of. Those present observed the bodies being put in the ovens and burned. They used stop-watches to time the process and took notes. On 13 March 1943 the engineer Karl Schultze and Heinrich Messing witnessed a test sample of 1,492 Jews from Krak√≥w Ghetto being killed in the gas chambers at Auschwitz II and then cremated. Karl Schultze later gave a full report about this to Ludwig Topf. Messing, who was a communist, not a Nazi, spent from January to June 1943 working at the camp. In an interview given in 2005, his daughter Hildegard who was 16 in 1943, said she would never forget him saying on his return, \\"If what I have seen comes out, we will all be wading up to our knees in blood\\".Hillebrand, Peter (13 June 2005) Auf Montage in Auschwitz in taz.archiv. Retrieve 7 August 2017. Use of forced labour From 1941 until the end of the war at least 620 people were engaged as forced labour (German:Zwangsarbeiter). Most of them came from France, Italy, the Soviet Union and Belgium. There were also small numbers of Poles, Dutch, Croatians and Czechs. The majority of the French, Soviets and Italians were prisoners of war. Barracks that could accommodate 52 Zwangsarbeiter were built on the Topf & S√∂hne factory site. The Zwangsarbeiter had to work 56 hours per week in comparison with the 42 hours worked by German employees, although they were paid 25‚Äì30% less. In addition, deductions were made for food and accommodation, and other costs. Abuse is known to have occurred; the camp manager, Wilhelm Buchr√∂der, a Nazi, was dismissed in 1944 by Ernst Topf for beating Zwangsarbeiter, although it is reported that his successor also mistreated them.

Retrieved 12 July 2017 The US Army's Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC) started to investigate Topf & S√∂hne within a few days of the Buchenwald liberation, and took company documents. =Ludwig Topf= On 27 April 1945, Ludwig Topf organised a meeting with company's works council at which it was agreed that the line to be taken with investigators was that workers and management knew that the ovens were delivered to concentration camps, but that they did not know the details of what was going on. Topf committed suicide on 31 May 1945, by cyanide poisoning. A senior engineer, Kurt Pr√ºfer, was arrested the day before, and Topf was warned that he was about to be arrested himself. He left a suicide note claiming that he and his brother were innocent and that he was the 'opposite' of a Nazi, but he thought he would be used as a scapegoat anyway. He was unmarried and had no children. He had a reputation as a womaniser and was living with his secretary, 19 years his junior, at the time of his death. =Ernst Wolfgang Topf= At the end of June 1945, Ernst Topf travelled to an insurance company in Stuttgart, then in the French occupied zone, to collect a 300,000 Reichmark life insurance payout that was due following his brother Ludwig's death. Erfurt was handed over to the Soviet administration on 3 July, and Soviets would not give Topf permission to return. From October 1945 he went to live in the town of Gudensberg, in the district Fritzlar-Homberg, in the American zone, where his niece, the daughter of his sister Hanna, was working for the American military administration. In 1951 Topf founded a new company, in Wiesbaden, to make crematoria and refuse incinerators. He used the old family firm's name, J.A. Topf & S√∂hne, hoping to capitalise on its good reputation prior to World War II. However, his business never did well. After the truth about the concentration camps was exposed, Topf & S√∂hne's involvement was quite widely known. Topf moved the company to Mainz in 1954. There was further bad publicity when the book Macht ohne Moral ('Power without Morals') was published in 1957.Schnable, Raimund (1957) Macht ohne Moral. Eine Dokumentation √ºber die SS. Frankfurt-am-Main: R√∂derberg- Verlag The book contains photographs of piles of bodies and crematoria at various concentration camps. It also includes transcripts of two documents from the original Topf company, making its collaboration with the SS clear. The company went bankrupt in May 1963. Topf's wife Erika, aged 52, died in April 1963. They had two children. Investigations into Ernst Topf A poster from the North Rhine-Westphalia state elections 1947, with the slogan \\"For a quick and just denazification vote CDU\\" Topf, now living in the American occupied zone, was arrested by the American CIC on 25 March 1946. He was held in custody and interrogated for two or three weeks and then let go. He maintained that the ovens they had delivered to the concentration camps were standard equipment, of the same type that they made for city crematoria for civilian use and claimed that if they had refused to work with the SS they would have been severely punished. Later, in December 1946, because of his membership of the Nazi party, the Fritzlar-Homberg Spruchkammer, a German civilian denazification court, started investigating Ernst Topf. About 8.5 million Germans had been members of the party and the Spruchkammer were set up to investigate them. Topf was required to provide two sworn witness statements regarding his non-Nazi political leanings ‚Äì two employees of Topf & S√∂hne provided these and vouched for him. The Spruchkammer had difficulties in getting evidence, partly due to a lack of co-operation between American officials and officials in Soviet occupied Erfurt. In March 1948 the Spruchkammer in Wiesbaden, where Topf had moved to, took over his files. This closed at the end of 1949 and Topf's file was handed over to the Wiesbaden state prosecutors office, where investigations into him as an accessory to murder for his role in the Holocaust began. However, important witness statements were lost and Soviet authorities in Erfurt were no longer interested in assisting with the case. The investigation was suspended in 1951. In 1959 the state prosecutors in Frankfurt reopened investigations into Topf. Two further legal proceedings followed in 1962 but neither resulted in a formal charge. Topf died in 1979. He never made any apology for Topf & S√∂hne's involvement with the Nazi regime. =Staff= Kurt Pr√ºfer (1891‚Äì1952), a senior engineer and the main designer of the ovens, was initially arrested by the American CIC on 30 May 1945 and interrogated. He was released three weeks later and returned to work. On 1 March 1946 the firm was given a large contract for malting and brewing equipment by the reparations department of the Soviet military, however a few days later, four engineers of the firm were arrested. These were Kurt Pr√ºfer, Fritz Sander (1876‚Äì1946), Karl Schultze (1900-died after 1955) and Gustav Braun (1889‚Äì1958). Braun, also a qualified engineer, was the factory's production manager.The Technology of Murder on Facinghistory.org. Retrieved 22 July 2017.

Retrieved 22 July 2017. He is quoted as saying during the interrogations \\"I was a German engineer and key member of the Topf works and I saw it as my duty to apply my specialist knowledge in this way in order to help Germany win the war, just as an aircraft construction engineer builds airplanes in wartime, which are also connected with the destruction of human beings.\\" Over the next two years, the other three men remained in custody and were interrogated in Germany and in Moscow, where, on 17 April 1948, they were sentenced to 25 years in a Russian labour camp. That was the highest sentence that could be given without having a full trial. Pr√ºfer died in October 1952 of a stroke while in prison. In 1955 Schultze and Braun were released early. =Nationalisation of company= As Ernst Topf was now in western Germany and his brother Ludwig was dead, Topf & S√∂hne was declared an \\"ownerless company\\" and in 1946 it was taken over by the state and renamed \\"Topfwerke Erfurt VEB\\". It was made a subsidiary of VVB NAGEMA, a group of East German state-owned engineering companies. In 1952 it was renamed \\"NAGEMA VEB Maschinenfabrik \\"Nikos Belojannis\\", after a Greek communist who had been an inmate in a German concentration camp in Greece. The company's crematoria department was closed in 1955 and in 1957 it stopped production of all forms of combustion machinery and was renamed VEB Erfurter M√§lzerei- und Speicherbau (VEB EMS), (Erfurt Oasthouse and Granary Construction). It was privatised in 1993 after German reunification and it went bankrupt in 1996. After German reunification =Property claim= After German reunification in 1990, over 2.5 million claims were made for restitution of property that had been confiscated during the Nazi period, or by the East German government.Blacksell, M. (1996) Settlement of property claims in former East Germany. New York: Geographical Review, vol.2, 1986 (Apr 1996) p. 198-215. Some descendants of the Topf family made a claim for the former family villa and factory in Erfurt which had been made state property. It was refused in 1992, because property confiscated during the Soviet occupation period could not be claimed. However, the family made a further claim for financial compensation.

The motto \\"Stets gern f√ºr Sie besch√§ftigt, ...\\" (\\"Always happy to be at your service, ...\\") is painted in large letters on the outside of the restored building. This bland valediction (complimentary close) was often used at the end of letters Topf & S√∂hne sent to the SS, in which details of orders for concentration camp ovens were discussed. Film =The Big Denial documentary= In 2007 the Dutch broadcaster VPRO made a television documentary about Topf & S√∂hne called The Big Denial as part of the In Europe series. It includes archival footage from the 1930s and 40s, and footage of the ruins of the Topf family villa in 2007 and the Erfurt factory site and administration building before it was restored as a memorial site. It is available on YouTube, non-professionally cut into three parts. It is in Dutch and German, with English subtitles. * The Big Denial. Part 1 (11:03 min) * The Big Denial.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for nine seasons in the American League with the St. Louis Browns, Cleveland Indians, and Philadelphia Athletics. In 250 career games, Zoldak pitched 929‚Öì innings and posted a win‚Äìloss record of 43‚Äì53, with 30 complete games, five shutouts, and a 3.54 earned run average (ERA). Although an average hitting pitcher in his major league career, posting a .175 batting average (50-for-286) with just 16 runs and 11 RBI, he was a very good fielding pitcher, posting a .984 fielding percentage with only four errors in 258 total chances. Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, Zoldak began his professional career in the low-level minor leagues, working his way up despite being released from his first team. The St. Louis Browns acquired him in 1944 and placed him on their major league roster. He debuted on May 23, and spent the next four years as a spot starter, working both as a starting pitcher and relief pitcher. He was traded to the Cleveland Indians in 1948, and helped lead the team to the 1948 World Series. After two more years with Cleveland, he was traded to the Philadelphia Athletics, the organization he originally started with, and played two seasons there. After a short minor league stint in 1953, he retired from the game, and died in 1966. Early life and career Zoldak was born on December 8, 1918 in Brooklyn, New York. He was raised by his mother, and worked at her confectionery shop, both while he was growing up and during the baseball offseason. He attended Eastern District High School, and took up the game of baseball at McCarren Park, as his high school did not have a baseball team. He began his professional career with the Palatka Azaleas in 1938, and threw 13 innings in two games. He was released afterwards, and played college baseball for the Fordham Rams baseball team while also playing some semi-professional baseball for a team in Cedarhurst, New York. Zoldak was signed by Philadelphia Athletics owner Connie Mack before the 1941 season, ending his college baseball career and restarting his professional one. In 1941, Zoldak played for the Selma Cloverleafs and Williamsport Grays, pitching in 12 combined games. The following season, he spent the full year with Williamsport. In 32 games, he won and lost 11 each, and finished the year with an ERA of 2.54 in 177 innings pitched. The following year, he remained in the Eastern League with the Elmira Pioneers due to the Williamsport team choosing not to field a team until the conclusion of World War II. In 36 games for Elmira, Zoldak won 20 games, lost 11, and had a 2.73 ERA in 244 innings pitched. Major league career On February 17, 1944, Zoldak was traded along with Barney Lutz to the St. Louis Browns for Frankie Hayes, as the Athletics wanted a veteran to add to their roster, while the Browns wanted the two prospects as they were classified as 4-F, and would be available to the team for the duration of the war. He impressed the Browns coaching staff in spring training, and as a result was named to the opening day roster. Zoldak made his major league debut on May 13, and was used as a reliever during his first season, pitching in 18 games and earning an ERA of 3.72. The Browns made it to the 1944 World Series, but Zoldak did not see any action. He played in 26 games during the 1945 season, earning a 3-2 record with an ERA of 3.36. In his final appearance of the season on September 29 against the Cleveland Indians, he was given the opportunity to start a game opposite Bob Feller. In a six-inning game shortened by rain, Zoldak and the Browns won, 2-1. Entering the 1946 St. Louis Browns season, manager Luke Sewell was reluctant to turn Zoldak into a starter, but eventually gave him the nod. His first two starts were both victories, one of which was a complete game shutout against the Chicago White Sox, which gave him credit for three of the Browns' first eight wins of the season. He pitched in 35 games over the season, 21 of them starts, and ended the year with a 3.43 ERA, a 9-11 record, and a career-high 51 strikeouts. Unlike the previous season, Zoldak was slow to start in 1947, not winning his first game until June 22 against the Washington Senators. He finished the season similar statistically to 1946: he played in 35 games and started 19, and had a record of 9-10 and a 3.47 ERA. During the offseason, Cleveland Indians owner Bill Veeck offered $100,000 for Zoldak, but were turned down, and he remained on the Browns to begin the 1948 season. Zoldak was projected to be the team's opening day starting pitcher against the Cleveland Indians, who had planned for him; instead he was used in relief and Fred Sanford was named the starter the day of the game. After spending the first two months of the season with the Browns, where he went 2-4 record in 11 games, he was traded to the Cleveland Indians on June 15, 1948, who added pitcher Bill Kennedy to go with their original offer of $100,000, a move which Bill Veeck called \\"a case of begging for him on our knees.\\" For the Indians, he served both as a relief pitcher and a fifth starting pitcher as he did with the Browns. On August 18, he faced his former team, and threw a complete game shutout, defeating the Browns, 3-0. A month later, he won two back-to-back games against the Detroit Tigers, both in extra innings. During his time with the Indians, he went 9-6 with a 2.81 ERA in 23 games, 12 of them starts. He was on the Indians roster for the 1948 World Series and warmed up for all six games in the Indians' bullpen, but was never called upon to pitch; he was one of two on the roster who did not see any action in the World Series. Zoldak was moved to a relief role full-time for the 1949 Cleveland Indians season due to a lack of depth with the departures of Ed Klieman and Russ Christopher. On July 27, Zoldak managed to hit his only career home run against the New York Yankees off Ed Lopat. However, the game was rained out, and the only home run of his career was erased. In 27 games that season, Zoldak had a 1-2 record with a 4.25 ERA. Zoldak had struggled in spring training the prior year due to both being out of shape and a lack of pitching control, but was impressive enough in 1950 after losing the weight and regaining his control that manager Lou Boudreau decided to put him in the starting rotation to begin the year. He pitched poorly in his first starts, and was placed back in the bullpen for the rest of the year; Indians management considered demoting him to the minor leagues, and would have been sent to the San Diego Padres in May if not for the intervention of Johnny Berardino, who wanted to play on the west coast and agreed to a demotion instead. Zoldak spent the full season with Cleveland, and had a 4-2 record and a 3.96 ERA in 33 games. Later life As the 1951 season began, Zoldak was part of a three-way trade. On April 30, 1951, he was traded to the Philadelphia Athletics along with Ray Murray, which also involved the Chicago White Sox. Manager Jimmy Dykes brought Zoldak onto the Athletics with the intention of putting him in the starting rotation in place of Lou Brissie, who had been sent to the Indians in the same trade. On July 15, Zoldak pitched a one-hitter against the Chicago White Sox in what was called \\"the greatest game of his career\\", and followed that up with a complete game against the Indians, allowing one run in nearly ten innings of work. In 26 games for the Athletics, 18 of them starts, he had a 6-10 record and a 3.16 ERA. Before the 1952 season began, manager Dykes planned on giving Zoldak more rest between starts to try to maximize what he could provide for the team, as he had been growing tired when overused during the season. Zoldak pitched in 16 games in 1952, and had a 0-6 record and a 4.06 ERA. On February 2, 1953, the Athletics released Zoldak unconditionally, considering him expandable due to the team having 20 pitchers on their spring training roster. He was given a tryout with the Toronto Maple Leafs, but after salary negotiations fell through he signed with the Seattle Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League. Zoldak pitched briefly for the Rainiers, appearing in two games before being released by the team; he retired from the game after his release. After retiring, he became a box office man, working at sporting events as well as shows on Broadway. Zoldak, who never married, died of lung cancer on August 25, 1966, leaving behind his mother and three siblings, and is buried in the Cemetery of the Holy Rood in Westbury, New York.

Berkeley municipal law prohibits removing any coast live oak with a trunk larger than six inches within city boundaries, but city boundaries do not include the university and the university further claimed an exemption to the city law as a state agency. The university's actions sparked three lawsuits, as well as a tree sit-in that ran from December 2006 to September 2008, when the trees in question were finally cut down. The grove Campus map, with the approximate location of the grove marked in blue. The oak grove sits at the base of California Memorial Stadium and at the time of the controversy consisted of about 90 trees: 65 oaks, including 38 coast live oaks, 25 pittosporum, 8 redwoods, 5 pines and 1 or 2 cypress, cedar, pepper and yew trees. Anywhere from two to five of the oaks predated the 83-year-old stadium. According to Lech Naumovich, a conservation analyst for the California Native Plant Society, \\"This is one of the most outstanding examples of oak woodland in an urban interface, and the last remnant of coast live oak woodland ecology in the Berkeley lowlands.\\" Naumovich also said that the grove provided sustenance for over 300 animal species, among them squirrels, acorn woodpeckers and deer. It is illegal to cut down mature coast live oaks in the City of Berkeley. However, the University claims an exception as its property belongs to the state and is not within the city's jurisdiction. The University claimed that most of the trees were planted in 1923 as part of a landscaping project. The university further stated that of the 44 trees slated to be cut down \\"only two or three predate memorial stadium.\\" Training facility The proposed Student Athlete High Performance Center (SAHPC) will be four stories tall, with of space. The University says the SAHPC is needed to provide safer facilities for the 350 people who work and train at California Memorial Stadium. The City of Berkeley claims that the facility will be unsafe because of its proximity to the Hayward Fault Zone, and supporters of the grove pointed out that if the University believes the stadium is currently unsafe, it should move all staff to another location immediately, and cease holding football games until the stadium is repaired. The University claims the SAHPC will cost over $125 million, and will require the removal of dozens of coast live oaks. According to materials published by the University, funding for the SAHPC will not come from either the state or the University's regular operating budget. Instead, a separate campaign has been organized to raise the money for SAHPC from private donors. Grove supporters asked the university to consider other locations on campus that would not require removing trees, which University administrators considered but rejected as being too far from the stadium. Tree-sit The tree-sitters' camp as of July 8, 2008. The tree-sit was initiated and led by Zachary RunningWolf, a community activist and former Berkeley mayoral candidate. RunningWolf said that construction of the athletic center would be \\"a hate crime; we call it Guant√°namo Berkeley\\". He also has said that the Illuminati and the Masons are conspiring to build the center because \\"the grove is at the intersection of compass lines connecting the Haas School of Business (money) with Alcatraz (state violence) and the Lawrence Berkeley lab that gave America nukes\\". The protest ran from December 2, 2006, to September 9, 2008, and was the longest urban tree-sit ever. In September 2007 the university reported that there had been 155 violations and 98 arrests or citations in connection with the protest. By April 5, 2008, the protest had also generated more than 200 police reports, most of which were filed against the protesters. As of November 2007 the university had spent $125,000 for private security guards at the grove, $100,000 in covering costs incurred by the University of California Police Department (UCPD) that were not part of their normal on-duty operations, and $117,000 in building two fences around the grove. As of April 5, 2008, the cost to UCPD had reached $300,000. =Burial grounds= Berkeley Memorial Stadium oak grove and protest banner reading \\"Native Burial Grounds\\" On February 16, 2007, RunningWolf produced an archaeological survey document stating that the proposed location of the athletic center was \\"an area producing burials\\". The document had been provided by an anonymous sympathizer. A San Francisco Examiner article from 1925 was included with the survey document that indicated that Leslie Spier, an assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Washington, had unearthed three bodies in the area and believed the remains were part of an American Indian burial site. The article also indicated that bodies had been unearthed during the original construction of the stadium, but did not say if they were believed to be American Indian remains. There is some confusion as to which site the skeletons came from as the survey document covers both the stadium site and Faculty Glade, which is located 200 yards away. The Save the Oaks Foundation claims as many as 18 burials have been discovered at the stadium site. RunningWolf stated that University administrators did not make this fact clear in the environmental impact report filed for the project. The University responded that the report did state that there was high chance of archaeological sites within the planned area of construction. University administrators stated that they would perform a subsurface, archaeological test after a court-ordered injunction was lifted. The test would determine if the site contained remains of historical importance. Although RunningWolf claimed that California Senate Bill 18 would prevent further construction on the site, the University stated that the presence of remains would not stop them from building the athletic center. Larry Myers, executive secretary of the Native American Heritage Commission confirmed that California law does not outlaw construction on burial grounds. While federal laws require that descendants and the local Native American Heritage Commission must oversee any removal of remains from a site, the laws do not prevent construction on sites once the remains have been removed. Kent Lightfoot, a curator at the University's Phoebe Hearst Museum of Anthropology, said that there was no clear ethnic identification of the skeletons, nor evidence that they were part of a larger burial grounds and not simply isolated skeletons. Lightfoot went on to say that the only known artifact recovered near the skeletons was a Mexican coin from the second quarter of the 19th century. Some American Indian leaders expressed anger at the plans to build on the site. Corrina Gould, an Ohlone Indian, said that the site was sacred to the Ohlone. Malcolm Margolin, the author of The Ohlone Way said that the site was a likely spot for an Ohlone village. Indian leader Wounded Knee, of the Ohlone tribe, expressed anger with the planned construction, saying the site was being desecrated. However, Andrew Galvan, an Ohlone tribe member who collaborates with the university on research, stated that he was unaware of any proof of an Ohlone burial site in the grove. The California Oak Foundation amended their lawsuit to reflect the presence of the remains. =Nude photo shoot= On March 17, 2007, more than 100 people took part in a nude photo shoot by Jack Gescheidt with the oak trees as part of his TreeSpirit Project. Although the participants were told by UCPD that they would be arrested for public indecency, no arrests were made. =Tree-sitters remove branches= On July 16, 2007, UCPD reported that a redwood and a cedar in the grove had been damaged. The police suspected the tree-sitters of causing the damage during the construction of their sleeping platform. A spokesman for the protesters said that the platform was constructed in such a way as not to cause damage to the trees. RunningWolf responded by saying that the tree-sitters had in fact removed the branches, but had done so for preservation purposes. RunningWolf said the redwood, which had its top removed by the protesters, was already dead and that the other branches removed were also dead. RunningWolf said that \\"We have a professional arborist with us along with my (Native American knowledge) of how to help the tree regenerate after pruning the degenerative material off the tree\\". The UCPD in turn claimed the trees were trimmed to allow more room for platform construction. RunningWolf denied that the trees were cut to make room for platforms, saying that doing so would be \\"against our way of life\\". RunningWolf also stated that those responsible for cutting the trees had already left the grove due to the high turnover of protesters in the branches. The university's landscape architect and grounds services manager both agree that while pruning was not necessarily bad for the trees, removing the top of the redwood was bad practice as the tree would grow back weakly attached branches. =The first fence= On August 29, 2007, a chain link fence was constructed around the protesters. The fence was erected to prevent confrontation between the protesters and the sellout crowd of 72,516 people (17,000 of them from Tennessee, the opposing team) that were expected to attend the opening game of the California Golden Bears' football season. Protesters responded with shouts and promises to make it difficult for the UCPD to guard the fence. The protesters claimed the fence was erected not to protect them, but to starve them out. Some have drawn comparisons between the building of the fence, and the attempted take back of People's Park in 1969, in which the California National Guard was called in to remove protesters. Initially the police did not allow food and water to be passed over the fence to the tree sitters, but started to allow the deliveries by the evening. Two men were arrested following scuffles with police. Around 200 additional people joined hands around the fence in support of the tree sitters. The fence cost the University between $10,000 and $12,000 to build. Despite the fence more protesters took up spots in the trees. The California Oak Foundation challenged the construction of the fence in Hayward court, saying it violated a previous court order banning construction on the site. Judge Barbara Miller ruled that the fence was not in violation of her previous court order. =Eviction judgment= On September 12, 2007, the University announced that it would seek a restraining order to remove the protesters. The university claimed that the camp was a fire hazard because of two propane burners used to heat food. The university also claimed that falling containers of human excrement constituted a health hazard. Although RunningWolf denied the allegations of propane tanks being used, one was visible from the ground and four other protesters confirmed that they used them. On October 1, 2007, Alameda County Superior Court Judge Richard Keller ruled after a 90-minute hearing that the sit-in was illegal, that the First Amendment rights of the protesters were not violated as they were free to use them elsewhere, and that the university had a right to keep people off its property. Protesters who attended the hearing vowed to continue their protest regardless of the five days of jail time and $1000 fine that could be imposed upon them. Although the initial ruling was targeted against only protester David Galloway, on October 29, 2007, Judge Keller extended his ruling to apply to \\"all other persons acting in concert or participating with (the protesters)\\". The UCPD stated that even with the ruling they did not yet intend to remove the protesters. =The second fence= Police fences surrounding the Berkeley Memorial Stadium oak grove. On November 8, 2007, a second chain link fence was constructed around the oak grove. According to the University, the second fence was erected to protect and separate the tree sitters from the fans attending the Golden Bears' last home football game of the season, against the University of Southern California. The away fans numbered more than at the Tennessee game that prompted the construction of the first fence, with 20,000 fans showing up from Los Angeles. In a letter to Alameda County Superior Court Judge Barbara Miller the University stated that the new fence was the first step in removing the tree-sitters \\"without unnecessary risk\\" to either the protesters or UCPD. The new fence was placed an average of from the previous fence, with standoffs for barbed wire, although initially the wire was not mounted. The protesters were still allowed to have supplies brought to them. The fence was constructed in preparation for Judge Miller's ruling as to whether construction of the athletic center may proceed, which at the time was expected sometime after November 14, 2007. This date however was postponed, and a final ruling was handed down on June 18, 2008. Although the new fence was constructed to allow the UCPD to control entry into and out of the grove, protesters were still able to access their platforms by climbing a nearby telephone pole on city property. Barbed wire addition On November 15, 2007, gaps in the fence that had been left to allow access to Memorial Stadium for California's final home game were filled in, and barbed wire was mounted around the top. The completed fence cost the university $80,000; the University administrators claim the project did not come from funds allocated for research or education. =Protesters' supplies removed= Protester supplies and information near the Berkeley Memorial Stadium oak grove. On February 19, 2008, a university-hired contractor climbed the oaks and began removing items that could fall from the trees, as well as the ropes used to climb from tree to tree and hold supplies and tarps and platforms used as shelter. The UCPD described it as an effort to clean up the area while there were only four or five protesters present‚Äîfar fewer than normal. Supporters of the tree-sitters said the university intentionally chose to remove the supplies on a day on which rain was forecast in order to leave the protesters exposed to the elements. The university stated at the time that they intended to leave the protesters in place until a final court ruling on the building of the center. On June 17, 2008, the university once again hired contractors to remove some of the protesters' platforms, lines, and other infrastructure. The operation was started the day before a final ruling on the athletic center was expected in order to prevent more protesters from ascending the trees once the ruling was announced. One protester was removed from the trees and arrested after she allegedly bit one of the contractors. She was charged with assault, battery, resisting arrest, providing false information, trespassing and refusing to leave. One contractor was punched twice in the face during the operation. The protesters threw human urine and feces at the contractors and police throughout the day. Despite the actions of the university, about a dozen protesters remained in the grove. On June 18, 2008, around 200 peopled gathered around the oak grove as the university continued to remove the infrastructure set up by the protesters. Two more protesters were arrested, one for vandalism after he cut a tie linking police barricades together and one for attempting to grab a cutting tool out of the hands of one of the contractors. =Outside resupply prohibited, university begins to provide food and water= The university cut off outside resupply of the protesters on June 19, 2008. The university claimed in a letter to the Berkeley City Council that to the best of their knowledge the protesters had sufficient food and water and that the university would take action to maintain the health and safety of the protesters should they not come down. In response to the cutting off of supplies the City Council voted to send two city officials to the grove to check on the welfare of the protesters on June 24, 2008. The two officials, the Assistant City Manager and the Assistant Fire Chief, reported to the City Council on June 25, 2008, the protesters did indeed have sufficient food and water, and would refuse any supplies offered by the UCPD. Later that same day Mayor Tom Bates and City Manager Phil Kamlarz met with university officials to discuss the health of the tree-sitters. In response to the university's removal of some of the protesters from the grove and cutting off of supplies to the remaining protesters, attorneys for the tree-sitters asked Judge Richard Keller to order that food and water be allowed to be sent to the protesters. Judge Keller ruled on June 30, 2008, that while his previous restraining order against the tree-sitters remained in force, the university would need to take precautions to prevent endangering the protesters. Judge Keller stated that the university had no need to take aggressive action, and if they continued to take actions that endangered the protesters he would \\"become more aggressively involved\\". Judge Keller also ruled that the university did not have to provide food or water for the protesters as they were free to obey his previous order and come down at any time. Prior to Judge Keller's ruling, on June 26, 2008, the university began supplying water to the remaining tree-sitters. The university provided of water in twenty-four bottles. On June 27, 2008, the university began providing the tree sitters with of energy bars per protester and of water daily. =Some protesters come down, another arrives= On June 25, 2008, two protesters voluntarily descended from the trees. Both were arrested for violation of court orders and promptly released from jail as part of an agreement made between them and the UCPD. The two stated they did not leave because of lack of supplies and were confident that the remaining protesters would remain until they won. On July 1, 2008, four more protesters left the grove, leaving three protesters still in the trees. At 11:00 pm three of the tree-sitters were seen on the ground, at which point the UCPD arrested one of them for trespassing and violating a court order, causing the other two to take refuge in a nearby tree. Assistant Police Chief Mitch Celaya talked to the two tree-sitters for a couple of hours, at which point they agreed to come down. One of the protesters who was talked down did so with the condition that they would be allowed to make a video statement. Another protester came down later in the day after indicating that she might have an undetermined medical condition that would require treatment. RunningWolf said that she collapsed three times once she was on the ground. RunningWolf blamed the conditions on the long exposure to the elements, lack of food and water, and lack of sleep due to the lights the police set up surrounding the grove and the noise from the generators needed to power them. The university said they were happy that their strategy to get the tree-sitters to leave the grove was working. RunningWolf said that the remaining protesters would remain in the trees until at least 2008-07-17, when Judge Miller was expected to make a final ruling. On July 6, 2008, new protester Jeff Muskrat, carrying a pack with supplies, scaled the fences surrounding the grove and joined the three remaining tree- sitters. Jeff Muskrat climbed the fence after a message was posted on indybay.org that called for \\"'Ninja's' with climbing experience to break the lines and sneak into the grove\\". The new protester said that he had not previously been a member of the tree-sit, but supported their goals and so drove down from Oregon to join them. On July 14, 2008, Jeff Muskrat climbed down from the trees due to a death in his family. He was subsequently arrested for violating a court order, trespassing, vandalism, and possession of marijuana. His arrest outraged supporters of the protesters who thought the agreement with police had been that he would not be held in custody. The university however stated that they had told the people holding the protester that they had no objection to him being released once charged, which was expected to happen later that day. The university, which had been providing of energy bars per protester per day while preventing outside supply of the tree- sitters, said they would increase the amount to while also taking the new protester into account. The new rations were provided in the form of United States Coast Guard rations, and not the Clif Bars that had been previously provided. While the new rations were described as less palatable, the university stated they still met daily nutritional needs. =Protest at Chancellor Birgeneau's residence= University house, Chancellor Birgeneau's on campus residence. At around 5:00 p.m. on July 20, 2008, between thirty and fifty people marched from the oak grove to the university house, the on- campus home of the University's Chancellor Robert J. Birgeneau. They then dug a hole two feet in diameter on the chancellor's lawn and planted a six-inch oak seedling. The seedling had been raised over the past year from an acorn that had fallen from one of the trees in the grove. Six protesters were arrested for trespassing, vandalism and conspiracy. One of the six was charged with battery after she allegedly hit a police officer on the head with a bamboo pole. The police were looking for a seventh person in connection with the protest. RunningWolf said the tree had been meant as an olive branch. =The university removes branches= Workers from the University removing tree limbs. On August 21, 2008, university contractors were brought in to trim branches off of the tree in which the protesters were residing. They removed twenty-two branches from the redwood tree that the protesters were living in, and four branches from two live oaks nearby. The contractors removed all the branches below in an attempt to make it difficult for more protesters to ascend the tree, and to free up some UCPD officers ahead of the beginning of the fall semester. RunningWolf accused the university of violating Judge Miller's order preventing construction on the site. The university responded by saying that they had informed Judge Miller at 9:00 a.m. that morning of their plans to remove the branches, including an affidavit from a horticulturalist and pictures of the branches to be removed. The university further states that the court order allows them to conduct limited pruning for safety and security reasons. =Grove cut down= On September 4, 2008, an Appeals court agreed to hear an appeal, but declined to issue a new injunction. On September 5 and 6. 2008, the majority of the grove was cut down by the University with the exception of one tree that contained the remaining protesters. =Tree-sitters descend= Starting at 8:00 a.m. on September 9, 2008, contractors hired by the university began constructing a scaffolding around the tree occupied by the tree-sitters. At the same time the UCPD began to move cherry pickers into position around the tree. The cherry pickers were topped with fabric panels to shield the contractors against anything thrown by the tree-sitters as the scaffolding was constructed. While the scaffolding was under construction, UCPD Chief Victoria Harrison and Assistant Chief Mitch Celaya negotiated with the tree-sitters from a large metal basket suspended from a crane. At noon the scaffolding reached the level of the tree-sitters platform, at which time the tree-sitters platform was dismantled and thrown to the ground to allow the scaffolding to continue. At 12:42 p.m. the scaffolding was completed, with a railing around the highest platform. The UCPD then mounted the scaffolding and began to remove the protesters' supplies. The tree-sitters agreed to come down at 1:01 p.m. after the university agreed to involve the community in addressing future land use issues. The four tree- sitters were arrested once they came down, although the university said they did not expect to file felony charges. Five protesters were also arrested on the ground and charged with offenses including battery and resisting arrest. After the tree-sitters were removed, the university denied that it had made any concessions. The tree that the protesters had occupied was cut down around 5:00 p.m. Court cases In addition to the tree sit-ins, the University has been sued by three parties to prevent construction of the facility: The California Oak Foundation, which wants to save the trees, the City of Berkeley, which is concerned with site safety, and the Panoramic Hill Association, which worries about increased traffic loads. The California Oak Foundation amended their lawsuit to reflect the presence of the possible American Indian remains at the site in June 2007. The three cases were consolidated and began September 19, 2007. =Initial lawsuit= The initial lawsuit was handled by Alameda County Superior Court Judge Barbara Miller. She handed down an initial ruling on June 18, 2008, and another ruling on July 22, 2008. Judge Miller's July 22, 2008, ruling was thought to be a final ruling, but an appellate court ruled on August 7, 2008, that the trial with Judge Miller was still ongoing. Judge Miller confirmed her earlier ruling as final on August 26, 2008. The University's settlement offer On September 4, 2007, the University offered a settlement proposal to the Berkeley City Council, under which all trees in the grove would still be chopped down and which would decrease parking in the stadium area even further. The settlement also offered to replace each removed tree with two newly planted trees and one large nursery oak, but did not state where these new trees would be planted. The University also offered a promise to schedule no more than eight football games and seven other events drawing more than 10,000 people a year at the stadium and promised to not plan events that require additional sound amplification other than the built-in stadium system. The university also offered to construct the new athletic center and retrofit the current stadium concurrently to make the stadium earthquake safe more quickly. The settlement was rejected by the Berkeley City Council with a vote of seven against, one for, and one abstaining. City Attorney Manuela Albuquerque opposed the settlement offer because she said she did not \\"consider the offer to be serious\\". Judge Miller tours the site On October 4, 2007, Judge Miller, in a rare if not unprecedented move, visited Memorial Stadium and the oak grove. Judge Miller was escorted by three police officers as well as attorneys for both sides and a group of journalists. Judge Miller was shown the stadium, the locker rooms and current training facilities, as well as the proposed construction site. Judge Miller was also taken to an alternate site at the southwest side of campus, and then to Golden Gate Fields in Albany. Golden Gate Fields was suggested as an alternate site for the football program in the environmental impact report the university filed. Both sides expressed confidence that having Judge Miller visit the site would help their side in the lawsuit. Initial ruling On June 18, 2008, Alameda County Superior Court Judge Barbara Miller released her ruling in the lawsuit brought by the California Oak Foundation, the City of Berkeley. and the Panoramic Hill Association. Both the university and the protesters claimed that the 129-page ruling supported their side. Judge Miller found that the proposed center did not \\"as a whole\\" violate the Alquist Priolo Special Studies Zone Act because it would not be built on a fault line. However, Judge Miller also ruled that some parts of the proposed project are alterations to California Memorial Stadium. By state law the value of these alterations can not exceed half the current value of the stadium. The University's estimate of the stadium's value is $593 million, while the attorney for the California Oak Foundation claims the stadium's current value is \\"near zero\\". =Response= On June 24, 2008, the plaintiffs handed in their proposal for the final ruling, as requested by Judge Miller in her initial ruling. They argued that the plans for an athletic center should be canceled if the university can not show that they could retrofit the stadium while complying with the Alquist Priolo Special Studies Zone Act. The plaintiffs also state that the university should drop plans to hold non-football events at the stadium, as this would be the only way to prevent excessive noise and traffic congestion. The university asked Judge Miller on July 1, 2008, to lift a seventeen-month-old injunction preventing construction on the site of the grove, arguing that the university had satisfied all safety issues and was bearing severe economic hardship due to the delays. The plaintiffs argued that the injunction should only be lifted if the university could provide a lawful project. Judge Miller scheduled a hearing on July 17, 2008, to discuss the request. Intermediate ruling On July 22, 2008, Judge Miller handed down what was thought to be her final ruling. Judge Miller ruled that the University's amended proposal satisfied environmental and seismic safety requirements. Judge Miller also ruled that her previous injunction against construction on the site would be lifted in seven days, on July 29, 2008, allowing the university to remove the trees and begin construction. Judge Miller ruled that the plaintiffs would have to pay 85% of the university's court costs, split evenly among the three parties, not including attorney fees. The university claimed that each day of delay cost $47,000 in additional security and increases in construction costs. Appeal begins and is sent back Judge Miller specifically allowed her injunction to stand for seven days to allow time for appeals to be filed. The appealing parties had to show that Judge Miller was faulty in her ruling and explain why a further injunction should be imposed. The automatic extension allows for both sides to prepare material for their arguments in the appeals case. The plaintiffs also asked for a writ of supersedeas and an immediate stay from the Court of Appeals. The Berkeley City Council met on July 25, 2008, to determine their response to the ruling, and decided to take no action. The Council required five votes to approve the appeal, but fell short of this number. The meeting started with public comments from almost one hundred residents, the vast majority of which were in favor of appealing. Those opposed to appealing included the Berkeley Chamber of Commerce. Mayor Tom Bates said he was encouraged by the university's assurances that they would move forward with seismically retrofitting Memorial Stadium soon. The announcement by the council was met by shouts of \\"Shame! Shame!\\" from the supporters of the protesters. The lawsuit was estimated to have cost $300,000, with an appeal expected to add roughly $60,000 more to the cost. The Chamber of Commerce and the Downtown Berkeley Association both cited the high cost of the lawsuit as a reason not to appeal the ruling during their arguments in front of the City Council. The council had until September 21, 2008, to decide whether to join the appeal, but ultimately did not do so. Both the California Oak Foundation and the Panoramic Hill Association filed notices to appeal on July 24, 2008, which extended the injunction for twenty days, until August 13, 2008. On August 13, 2008, the appellate court dismissed the appeal because they considered the trial with Judge Miller to still be ongoing, ruling that because there had been no \\"final determination of the rights of the parties\\" and that the 30-day window Judge Miller had granted for the university to alter their plans had not ended that the case was not ready for appeal. Because the appellate case was not going to go forward, they also denied a request by the petitioners to extend the injunction through the duration of the appellate case. However, they ruled that the injunction should stand until Judge Miller finalized her ruling. Final ruling On August 26, 2008, in a three line ruling, Judge Miller confirmed her previous intermediate ruling. The university agreed not to begin construction until an appellate court ruled on whether to continue the injunction. =Appellate lawsuit= Seismic improvements underway on the west side of Memorial Stadium in April 2009 The plaintiffs filed another appeal on August 28, 2008. As with the previous appeal the California Oak Foundation and the Panoramic Hill Association filed notices to appeal, while the Berkeley City Council declined to join. On September 4, 2008, the state appeals court agreed to hear the appeals, but declined to extend the injunction, which allowed the university to begin cutting down the grove. Reactions Many Berkeley students and residents have expressed disapproval of the protest, while others approve. A poll for the local CBS affiliate showed that Berkeley residents were evenly divided on the issue. 43% of respondents sided with the University while 41% sided with the protesters, with a margin of error of 4.6%. In 2006 more than 600 Berkeley students joined a Facebook group dedicated to opposing the removal of the oaks. A similar number of students joined a Facebook group \\"Students Against Hippies in Trees\\", to oppose the protest. An editorial in the UC Berkeley student newspaper, The Daily Californian, found fault with all sides in the conflict. They blamed the university for not communicating with the city and citizens, the California Oak Foundation for ignoring the larger issues of deforestation while focusing on just a few trees, the Panoramic Hill Association for reverting too quickly to lawsuits, and the tree-sitters for needlessly prolonging the protest once a court-ordered injunction was delivered.

The music and lyrics were written by Goodall, and the book was co-written by Goodall and Joanna Read. Unlike the novel, which is set in the French Revolution, the musical is set in the 1917 Russian Revolution, and the \\"two cities\\" of the title are not London and Paris but rather London and St. Petersburg. However, the underlying story is the same: a love triangle between the young Lucy Mannersly and the two men who fall in love with her, torn between their loyalties to her and to their native countries as they become caught up in the politics of the war-torn times they live in. Production The musical first ran from the 5th to 30 September 2006 at Salisbury Playhouse, SalisburyCatchpole, Kevin.\\"Review:'Two Cities'\\" britishtheatreguide.info, 2006 of which Read was the artistic director at the time. Though the possibilities of its transfer to the West End had been suggested, a series of negative reviews on its gala night meant no such transfer took place and as yet no revival performance has occurred. The original cast included Rosalie Craig as Lucy Mannersley, with Glyn Kerslake as Dr. Manislav; David Ricardo-Pearce as Sydney Carton and Ben Goddard as Yevgeny Irtenev.Bates, Lesley.\\"'Two Cities'\\" thestage.co.uk, 13 September 2006  Development  Two Cities was the result of a partnership between Goodall and Read that had begun several years before in 2003, when Read staged a production of Goodall's musical The Hired Man, based on the novel by Melvyn Bragg. The production was a huge success and won a TMA Award for Best Musical. During its production, Goodall had hinted that he might be interested in writing a new song for the revival, a chance Read had \\"enthusiastically accepted\\", as Goodall said. After the success of the production, Goodall says he \\"would have been mad not to try and work with her again, this time on a new piece.\\" The first piece Goodall suggested as source material for the musical was Cyrano de Bergerac, being a story about self-sacrifice for the sake of an unrequited love. However, Goodall had misgivings about taking this further, partly due to the impracticality of having to radio mike a singer with a prosthetic nose, and partly because he did not like Roxanne's self-centred decision to choose the \\"good-looking halfwit\\" Christian above Cyrano himself. Instead, they settled on a similar story of self-sacrifice, that of Charles Dickens' Sydney Carton. The major departure from Dickens' novel was the decision to focus the story on the Russian Revolution of 1917 rather than the French Revolution of 1789-1799. Goodall claims he was worried that if he kept the story set during the French Revolution that it would begin to bear too much resemblance to the musical Les Mis√©rables, so he made the alteration. He explained that the Russian Revolution is \\"roughly as close to our time as the storming of the Bastille was from Dickens'.\\" Many other changes crept in during the development process, but Goodall affirms that \\"the underlying compassion of Dickens' story has been, I hope, faithfully retained.\\" There were also various changes made during the development of the musical. Originally, in contrast to the novel, Goodall was going to have Dr. Manislav locked up for sixteen years rather than eighteen, but in the final version of the musical this was changed. There were also several changes to the lyrics as things progressed. The original version of \\"The Night School of Subversion\\" was very different musically, having a much more upbeat, almost circus-esque sound, and actually never featured the lyric that was to become the song's title. Lucy originally had a solo song called \\"Gentleman One, Gentleman Two\\", but this was replaced with a different song, \\"Just Suppose\\".  Synopsis  Prologue The opening song, \\"Mirom Gospodu Pomolimsya\\", sung by the whole company, sets the scene before a church in St. Petersburg in 1895. Dr. Manislav is summoned to the scene by Yana, the old servant of the villainous Count Irtenev. The Count has raped a young girl and Manislav has been summoned to help her. Appalled at the way people turn a blind eye to such crimes just because the perpetrator is one of the nobility, Dr. Manislav speaks out against the injustice (\\"Testimony\\") but is simply arrested and locked up for trying to speak out against the ruling classes. Act One The scene changes to the East End of London eighteen years later, in 1913. The prostitutes Dulcie and Enid describe the squalor of the lives they lead (\\"On Petticoat Lane\\") when the rich young Lucy Mannersley emerges from a theatre with her ward and guardian, Peter Stryver. They bump into a friend of Stryver's, the lawyer Sydney Carton, who is familiar with Dulcie and Enid. Stryver tells Lucy that he has discovered that her father, Dr. Manislav, is still alive, in prison in St. Petersburg. Realising she must go and rescue him, Lucy prepares to set out for Russia with Stryver. In St. Petersburg, the young student Kralena is thrown in prison for printing pamphlets inciting rebellion against the ruling classes. He vows that one day he shall see the workers take control, while Dr. Manislav, lying on the floor of the cell, reflects again on the injustice of his being silenced for trying to do the right thing (\\"One Day...\\") Lucy arrives with Stryver and arranges for her father's release, though Manislav seems to be delirious and doesn't recognise her. Kralena curses the aristocratic airs and graces of people like Lucy, and once they have gone, he again sings of how he shall one day seize power (\\"One Day...Reprise\\"). At the docks, a young peasant girl named Natalya sells her wares to the passing strangers, many of whom ignore her (\\"Departures\\"). However, one individual buys a locket from her. This man is Yevgeny Irtenev, the son of Count Irtenev. He explains to Yana that he has to leave to escape the anger of the working classes and says goodbye to her (\\"Irtenev and Yana's Farewell\\"). Lucy and Stryver, meanwhile, are having trouble with customs officials. Irtenev, posing as an Englishman named Edward Ireton, helps them to get past and onto the ship. As the ship sets sail back to England, Lucy sings to her father, trying to calm him in his absent, delirious state. Yevgeny/Edward and the whole company join in the song as they will the boat on towards England (\\"West and Safety Bound.\\") Lucy later speaks to Edward on the boat, and he expresses fear about going to a strange place he does not know. Edward is then approached by a Russian woman named Tatiana, who tries to sell him counterfeit gems and precious jewels from his homeland of Russia, but Edward refuses to give in to such temptation (\\"Precious Matryoshkas.\\") The boat eventually arrives at the docks in Harwich, where Lucy again tries to comfort her father by singing (\\"West and Safety Bound Reprise.\\") Meanwhile, Tatiana reports Edward to a policeman, claiming he is a Russian spy. Edward pleads his innocence, but is taken away. Lucy resolves to help him. Meanwhile, in Russia, Kralena arrives at an abandoned warehouse, where two of the Communist revolutionaries, Alexei and Sergei, welcome him to their dark world (\\"The Night School of Subversion,\\") asking him if he has what it takes. In the courtroom back in England, Sydney Carton arrives to defend Edward, apparently suffering from a dreadful cold. He questions Tatiana as to how she could be so certain that Edward was the man she thought he was, and she confesses not to know exactly what the spy she was looking for looks like. Throwing off his disguise, Sydney demonstrates that he bears an uncanny resemblance to Edward, thereby proving that it was easy for Tatiana to be mistaken in her assumption. Edward is released. Back in Russia, Alexei and Sergei take Kralena to the home of the local Police sergeant and urge him to blow the house up. Kralena is horrified but eventually does the horrific deed. Gleefully, the two revolutionaries welcome him to their movement (\\"The Night School of Subversion Reprise.\\") After the trial back in England, Lucy is very thankful to Sydney, and he feels an affection for her, but sees her obvious preference for Edward. Going home, Sydney sings sadly of the wasted life he has led pursuing women and always drinking, reflecting on the bleakness of his future. In St. Petersburg, Kralena joins the song, singing of how horrified he is at what he is done (\\"At the Last Trumpet.\\") The next day at Dr. Manislav's house, Sydney arrives to help Manislav arrange his will. When Manislav hears that Edward's real name is Irtenev, he becomes delirious again and goes into a sort of fit. Sydney helps him and leads him outside. Left alone with Lucy, Edward confesses his feelings for her, and asks her to marry him. With time suddenly frozen, Lucy sings alone, imagining her life with Edward and weighing up the choice in her mind (\\"Just Suppose.\\") However, before she can tell Edward her decision, Sydney returns and breaks the tension. In Russia, meanwhile, Count Irtenev speaks to Yana, claiming that the talk of a revolution is just ridiculous rumours that will never come to fruition. He also expresses his deep disappointment in his son for fleeing the country. Back in England, Dr. Manislav plays chess with Stryver and explains his disapproval of the relationship between Lucy and Edward. Stryver sings back at him, making a case that they should not blame Edward for his father's faults (\\"Bad Blood.\\") Back again at the Irtenev estate, Count Irtenev catches a young, starving boy stealing from him and orders him to be thrown in the lake. The final scene is all enacted through the song \\"Angelica, Arkangel\\", sung by the whole company. Edward tells Lucy his memories of childhood, while Sydney sings with Dulcie, eventually deciding to give up his self-pity and move to Australia where he can find a new life. Dr. Manislav and Stryver again sing together of the \\"bad blood\\" inherent in Edward. Lucy marries Edward and Kralena instigates a revolution, culminating in the execution of rich nobles such as Count Irtenev. Act Two In the streets of St. Petersburg in 1917, Kralena leading the people in revolution and smashing the world of the old elite (\\"A New Russia.\\") In England, Edward and Lucy are now married and have a daughter, Lily. Edward receives news from Yana telling of how his father has been killed and the revolutionaries have taken control. He tells Lucy that he must return to Russia to help. Kralena, meanwhile, has seized the Irtenev estate as his headquarters and sings \\"One Day...Reprise\\" as they capture Yana and force her to be their slave. Enid and Dulcie now sing and welcome us to the coastal resort of Paradise Sands (\\"On Paradise Sands,\\") singing of how soldiers come here on leave for a brief taste of happiness. Lucy and Stryver, who has been blinded fighting in the War, arrive and Lucy speaks bitterly of Edward's decision to return to Russia, claiming that \\"that country robs me of my family.\\" On a Baltic ferry towards Russia, Edward sings of his fears of what he may find when he returns home. Lucy, meanwhiles, bumps into Sydney on a train, who has come back to England to fight in the War. Joining in the song, Sydney confesses the love he has held for Lucy since he met her. She tells him that she is flattered, but cannot feel the same way, as she is married and has a daughter. As the song reaches its climax, Edward returns home to find the place a hellish nightmare, and Sydney and Lucy kiss (\\"Home.\\") They are disturbed by the arrival of Clusper, a major who knows Sydney. When Lucy has gone, Sydney decides to help Lucy in whatever way he can and asks Clusper to get him shipped out to Russia so he can rescue Edward for her. Edward arrives on the Irtenev estate and is immediately captured by Kralena and his men. He tries to plead his case that he is just a traveler, but when they threaten to kill Yana he confesses that he is indeed the son of Count Irtenev (\\"Capture.\\") Back at the English seaside, Lucy expresses concern for Edward, but Stryver stops her, telling her that he is sorry for all the times in the past that he upset or offended her. Meanwhile, the revolutionaries put Edward on trial (\\"Trial & Testimony.\\") He claims to be innocent, though Tatiana appears and levels accusations at him of being a foreign spy. Kralena summons the priest who was there when Dr. Manislav wrote his testimony, and reads it out as the words of Dr. Manislav explain the crimes of Edward's father. Condemned by Manislav's words, Edward despairs as he is led away to the old slaughter house to await execution. Sydney arrives in St. Petersburg and pleads with the officer in charge to let him go into the city and find Edward. However, the officer forbids it, saying he must stay in the British Consulate and be on a troop ship in the morning. However, another soldier, Barker, feels sorry for Sydney, and agrees to lead him to the slaughter house to find his friend. Stopping outside the ruined church, Sydney encounters Yana, caring for an injured young boy, as the company sings \\"Resurrection and Life.\\" Back in England, Lucy asks her father to tell her about her childhood in Russia. Dr. Manislav refuses, saying that that life is far behind them and they must move on (\\"Fairy Tales and Ghosts.\\") Sydney and Barker arrive at the slaughter house, where Edward and Natalya are kept prisoner. While Barker and the guard stay outside drinking, Sydney gets Natalya to help him switch clothes with Edward. Delirious, Edward barely recognises Sydney and leaves in a daze as the drunken Barker leads him out, believing him to be Sydney and taking him towards the troop ship. Left alone with Natalya, Sydney confesses that for the first time he feels he has done something honourable. Natalya sings to Sydney and explains her own tragic story (\\"The Sorrow of my Fate\\"). As the guards arrive to take Sydney to execution, he sings a reprise of \\"Home\\" that is taken up by the whole company as he is led away to be killed and Edward returns home to his wife and daughter.

Most of the reviews from the press, such as from The Times and The Guardian were quite negative. The Times critic found the acting and singing uninspiring, but found most grievances with the musical itself, feeling that it was, despite the change of setting, strikingly similar to Les Mis√©rables, even down to the nature of some of the songs. The Guardian reviewer wrote \\"But Goodall's music, although often beautiful and sometimes clever - particularly in the way that much of the second-act music mirrors the first - lacks any big numbers, and Read's book and production lack any impetus at all.\\"Gardner, Lyn.\\"Review:'Two Cities'\\" The Guardian, 13 September 2006 A West End transfer never occurred.

He is the author of Making Sense of Illness, and Unnatural History: Breast Cancer and American Society. Personal life Aronowitz was born in Brooklyn New York City in 1953 to Nat and Eve Aronowitz. He grew up with his older brother and sister. He attended Samuel J. Tilden High School, until he graduated at the age of 16. He currently resides in Lower Merion where he lives with his wife of 30 years and his two children. Education and professional life Aronowitz studied linguistics before receiving his M.D. from Yale. After a residency in Internal Medicine, he received training in the history of medicine as a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Clinical Scholar. He taught at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and practiced medicine at Cooper Hospital before arriving at Penn in 1999. At Penn, Dr. Aronowitz also holds a joint appointment in the Department of Family Practice and Community Medicine. He was the founding director of the Health and Societies Program, and co-directs the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Health & Society Scholars Program, a post-doctoral and research program focused on population health. He is currently in the midst of a project on the history of health risks in American medicine and society, for which he is the recipient of an Investigator Award in Health Policy from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Books Aronowitz‚Äôs first book, Making Sense of Illness: Science, Society, and Disease (Cambridge University Press, 1998) explores changing disease definitions and meanings in the 20th century. The Washington Post's review said: \\"Making Sense of Illness succeeds as both a medical monograph and a book for the lay reader because it speaks to such deep matters of health and health care delivery, and accomplishes its task in relatively jargon-free language. This is a book for the thinking reader\\". His second book, Unnatural History: Breast Cancer and American Society was published in October 2007 by Cambridge University Press. The publisher offers this summary: In the early 19th century in the United States, cancer in the breast was a rare disease. Now it seems that breast cancer is everywhere. Written by a medical historian who is also a doctor, Unnatural History tells how and why this happened. Rather than there simply being more disease, breast cancer has entered the bodies of so many American women and the concerns of nearly all the rest, mostly as a result of how we have detected, labeled, and responded to the disease. The book traces changing definitions and understandings of breast cancer, the experience of breast cancer sufferers, clinical and public health practices, and individual and societal fears.

The main facade is five bays wide with a projecting central bay that rises to a gabled peak above the main roof line. Most windows are set in openings topped by heavy segmented-arch hood mouldings. The house was completed in 1861, and was from 1863 to 1865 home to Franklin Hough. Hough was one of the first people in the nation to articulate significant concern for the state of its forests, observing that forestry products had declined in New York in the 1850s and 1860s. In 1876, he was appointed the first federal government official responsible for overseeing the nation's forests. The organization he established eventually became the United States Forest Service.

W. Griffith for Biograph in 1910. Plot The film opens upon two sisters (Martha, played by Mary Pickford, and Millie, played by Gertrude Robinson) standing in a field of daisies. Millie plucks the petals off of one to divine whether he loves me... he loves me not. The girls part ways; Martha's next stop is the vegetable patch in which a lanky farmhand diligently labors with a shovel. She passes up the farmhand's polite offer to become sweethearts and promptly steals away to town to get her palm read by a woman fortuneteller. There, a mustachioed gypsy catches her eye, and he tells her a fortune in which he \\"plans her future to his liking\\". The pair run off together, crossing a brook into which he saves her from falling. They arrive at a waterfall where he \\"induces her to believe his prophecy must be true\\". After that brief exchange, Martha jubilantly skips home, passing the lanky farmhand who pays her no heed. Arriving at the homestead, she immediately resolves to return to the waterfall. At their second meeting, the gypsy greets Martha with open arms and after some animated entreaties she meets his embrace. In a brief cutaway, Millie looks for Martha at the orchard, but can't find her. Martha reluctantly bids the gypsy adieu‚Äîafter she is gone, he laughs and struts confidently. Martha's stealthy return escapes the notice of Father and Millie who are sitting on the porch of the homestead. They seem to accept the explanation of her absence when she motions to the second story of the house. Martha then talks Millie into getting her own fortune read and they slip away, hand in hand, over a rough-hewn fence, through the field of daisies, and into town. While the fortuneteller is examining Millie's palm, Martha is distracted by one of the townswomen. The crafty gypsy then swoops in and charms Millie into accompanying him to the romantic waterfall. When Martha returns to the fortuneteller's tent, Millie is nowhere to be found. Millie, in the meantime, has bounced home and back to the waterfall, where the gypsy bids her to sit on a conveniently-placed bench. Martha wanders back to the waterfall (via the orchard), where she is horrified to find the gypsy with his arm around Millie and observes them long enough to witness him kiss Millie on the cheek. Heartbroken, Martha returns to the orchard to weep. To complicate things, Father departs the homestead and his route takes him by the waterfall where he discovers his daughter in close personal contact with the gypsy. In a fit of rage, the old man tears the gypsy from his daughter and reproves him wildly. Father raises his cane to strike the gypsy, but the gypsy impulsively fells him with a two quick blows to the torso. Aghast at what he's done, the gypsy escapes just as two passersby arrive on the scene. The gypsy flees through the field of daisies as a growing mob of farmhands set out looking for him. After passing through an overgrown field and over the brook, the gypsy arrives at the orchard. Martha, unaware of his wrongdoing, yields to his pleading and successfully conceals him in a barrel underneath potatoes she empties out of a bushel basket. After the farmhand posse passes, and just as Father is recovering with the help of Millie and a passerby at the waterfall, the gypsy emerges from the barrel and bids the jilted Martha a hasty and perfunctory farewell. The posse eventually catch up with the gypsy back at the fortuneteller's wagon, where they warn him in no uncertain terms to leave town, which he does with a bindle over his shoulder. The dejected Martha, sitting on some wooden steps leading up from the road, looks up to find the posse marching the gypsy out of town. She wanders off to the vegetable patch where she finds solace in the arms of the lanky farmhand she had rejected earlier. The film concludes in the field of daisies where Millie abandons another round of petal plucking to walk off arm-in-arm with a strapping farmhand who appears out of the blue. Cast * Clara T.

The park, which opened in 1995, has been built atop a former hazardous waste site that has been rehabilitated under an adaptive reuse program that was spearheaded by S. Marston Fox and the Fox Point Civic Association. Fox Point State Park is open for year-round use from 8:00 am until sunset. The park offers recreational opportunities on biking and pedestrian trails with picnic facilities, a playground and volleyball and horseshoes facilities. Fox Point State Park is just off Interstate 495 and is the northern terminus of Delaware's Coastal Heritage Greenway. History Building and picnic tables at Fox Point State Park. The creation of Fox Point State Park is largely the result of one man's dream. S. Marston Fox spent the last twenty-five years of his life working to transform a stretch of land along the Delaware River in northern Wilmington. The land on which Fox Point State Park sits was created by land fill by the Pennsylvania Railroad along its right of way on the bank of the Delaware River. The railroad was seeking to create additional industrial land for potential customers. Mr. Fox began his efforts to stop the filling process in 1958, and sought to have the land turned over to the people as public use land. The four mile (6.4 km) stretch of shoreline was not turned over to New Castle County until the late 1970s. Mr. Fox died in 1982, after which his crusade was taken up by David Ennis and Eugene Snell of the Fox Point Civic Association. The state of Delaware acquired the land in 1990 and began the process of remediating the hazardous waste site. The soil at Fox Point State Park had been contaminated by industrial waste and sewage sludge. Environmental specialists were called in to construct the park in such a way that the health of employees and visitors would not be threatened. Funds provided by the State of Delaware's Hazardous Substance Cleanup Act were designated to use a commonly employed strategy to contain waste a landfills: a cap system. The cap system plan called for an impermeable layer of plastic to cover the of contaminated land. Layers of clean fill, sand, gravel and topsoil were placed atop and underneath the protective plastic. The park was expanded when more remediation was performed in 2008. Following Tropical Storm Henri in 2003, the housing development of Glenville was flooded and most of its homes were condemned. Working with the Federal Highway Administration, the state removed 130,000 cubic yards of clean soil from Glenville in order to transform the site into restored wetlands to prevent future flooding. The clean soil was then transported to Fox Point where it was used to cap additional acreage. The project was awarded Delaware's Governors Excellence Award and the Federal Highway Administration's Environmental Excellence Award. The Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control continues to monitor and maintain the environmental protections at Fox Point State Park Sections of the park that have not undergone the remediation process are surrounded by mesh fences and are off limits to visitors, although more of the park land will be remediated and opened to the public in the future. Recreation Walking path at Fox Point State Park. Fox Point State Park's location along the Delaware River provides visitors with several scenic vistas and a view of the working river. The skyline of Philadelphia can be seen to the north and the Delaware Memorial Bridge can be viewed to the south. The park is near the shipping channel of the Delaware River and barges, container ships and tankers pass by regularly. There are several signs on the shore of the river that provide information about the various watercraft that can be seen navigating the Delaware River. In addition to the vistas, visitors to the park have access to extensive picnic facilities, volleyball courts, horseshoe pits, and a playground. Fox Point State Park is the northern terminus of the Coastal Heritage Greenway, which stretches from Wilmington south along the shore of Delaware Bay to Cape Henlopen State Park. It is also the eastern terminus of the Northern Delaware Greenway. Fox Point State Park is located on the Atlantic Flyway. This brings a wide variety of migrating birds to the park. Future development Plans for further development include extensive remediation of the affected soils. Once the polluted soil is protectively contained, additional park infrastructure is planned. A loop with fitness stations will be built. The area on the inside of the loop will be planted with a wide variety of wildflowers. This should lessen the environmental impact and cut down on maintenance costs. Plans for the construction of a multi-purpose building have been written, along with plans for an amphitheater, children's garden, and boat launch.

Moss co-authored the novel The Spike with Arnaud de Borchgrave; it became a best seller in 1980.The New York Times, \\"Behind the best sellers Arnaud de Borchgrave and Robert Moss\\", 22 June 1980. Moss became a full-time writer and published a series of best-selling suspense novels including Moscow Rules and Carnival of Spies. =Interest in dreaming= In 1986, Moss felt the need to get away from the commercial fast track and moved to a farm in upstate New York, where he started dreaming in a language he did not know that proved to be an archaic form of the Mohawk language. Helped by native speakers to interpret his dreams, Moss came to believe that they had put him in touch with an ancient healer ‚Äì a woman of power ‚Äì and that they were calling him to a different life.Robert Moss, The healing power of ancient iroquoian dreamways, Shaman's Drum 64, 2003, pages 54‚Äì65. Out of these experiences he wrote a series of historical novels and developed the practice he calls Active Dreaming, an original synthesis of contemporary dreamwork and various methods of journeying and healing. A central premise of Moss's approach is that dreaming isn't just what happens during sleep; dreaming is waking up to sources of guidance, healing and creativity beyond the reach of the everyday mind.Robert Moss, The Secret History of Dreaming, New World Library, Novato (California), 2009, page x. He introduced his method to an international audience as an invited presenter at the conference of the Association for the Study of Dreams at the University of Leiden in 1994.Robert Moss, Newsletter of the ASD Conference, University of Leiden, the Netherlands, 1994 =Core techniques of active dreaming= * The \\"lightning dreamwork\\" process, designed to facilitate quick dream-sharing that results in helpful action; the use of the \\"if it were my dream\\" protocol encourages the understanding that the dreamer is always the final authority on his or her dream. * Dream reentry: the practice of making a conscious journey back inside a dream in order to clarify information, dialogue with a dream character, or move beyond nightmare terrors into healing and resolution. * Tracking and group dreaming: conscious dream travel on an agreed itinerary by two or more partners, often supported by shamanic drumming. * Navigating by synchronicity: reading coincidence and \\"symbolic pop-ups\\" in ordinary life as \\"everyday oracles\\".Robert Moss, The three \\"only\\" things: Tapping the power of dreams, coincidence and imagination (New World Library, Novato (CA), 2007, pages 81‚Äì88 and 149‚Äì157).

US Govt. New York: Dover Publications Inc. 203 pp. . is a venomous pit viper species endemic to Mexico. Description Adults are short and exceedingly stout, commonly growing to in total length. The snout is rounded with a sharp canthus. At midbody there are 23-27 rows of dorsal scales that are strongly keeled, tubercular in large specimens. The ventral scales are 121-135, while the subcaudals are 26-36 and mostly single. The eye is separated from the labial scales by 3-4 rows of small scales. The color pattern consists of a tan, light brown or gray ground color that is overlaid with a series of around 20 dark brown or black rhomboid blotches. The lower tips of these blotches often connect with spots on the flanks to form narrow crossbands. The top of the head is dark with oblique postorbital stripes, below which the side of the head is a lighter color. The belly is whitish, occasionally with dark brown blotches. These snakes have sometimes been mistaken for young bushmasters (Lachesis muta), but can easily be identified by their lack of a specialized tail tip. Geographic range Found in eastern Mexico from San Luis Potos√≠ southeastward on the Atlantic versant and lowlands. Found in various types of forest, including cloud forest and rain forest at altitude. The type originally lacked locality information, but apparently \\"Mexico\\" was filled in some time later. A restriction to Teapa, Tabasco, Mexico, was proposed by Burger (1950). Metlapilcoatlus mexicanus and Metlapilcoatlus occiduus were both formerly considered subspecies. Conservation status This species is classified as Least Concern (LC) on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (v3.1, 2001). Species are listed as such due to their wide distribution, presumed large population, or because it is unlikely to be declining fast enough to qualify for listing in a more threatened category. The population trend is stable. Year assessed: 2007. References Further reading * R√ºppell, E. 1845.

Wartime career Maingard was studying in London in 1939 at the outbreak of the Second World War and volunteered for the British Army. After an unrewarding period in the infantry, Maingard joined the Special Operations Executive F section in 1942. He was parachuted into occupied France in April 1943 to join the 'Stationer' circuit run by Squadron Leader Maurice Southgate, initially as radio operator but soon was second-in-command in the circuit, arranging the delivery of weapons, supplies and personnel to the maquisards of the French Resistance. Southgate was arrested by the Gestapo in May 1944 and sent to the Buchenwald concentration camp. Maingard was fortunate not to be arrested with him. Southgate's courier, Pearl Witherington and Maingard were with Southworth the day he was arrested, but Witherington said that Maingard was worn out and that he needed to take the afternoon off.

Kaspar married Anne de Rov√©r√©a. He participated in the Naples campaign of Charles VIII of France in 1494.

Kaspar led the first contingent of 150 Swiss mercenaries hired by Pope Julius II, entering the Vatican on 22 January 1506 (considered the foundation date of the Pontifical Swiss Guards). Under Pope Leo X, Kaspar von Silenen's company was one of six Swiss and Grisons mercenary units, totalling 1,800 men, sent to Rimini in the War of Urbino of 1517. They were supposed to help defend the city against the Duke of Urbino until reinforcements could arrive. They were quartered outside the main city walls, in Borgo San Giuliani, because the garrison commander, condottiere Guido Rangoni, was reluctant to let a large mercenary force enter the city. In the evening of 4 August, there were reports of a large enemy force approaching, and Rangoni invited the mercenaries inside, but Kaspar refused due to the late time of the evening, saying his men were already \\"full of wine\\". The enemy arrived in the early morning of 5 August and managed to enter the Borgo unnoticed, and killed many of the mercenaries in their sleep.

Like the Sound's previous records, the album was not commercially successful, but the band largely considered it to be their best work.  History  By 1987, the Sound were solid veterans in the music industry; they had, for instance, already passed through two record labels (Korova and Statik), released four studio albums (1980's Jeopardy, 1981's From the Lions Mouth [sic], 1982's All Fall Down and 1985's Heads and Hearts), one EP (1984's Shock of Daylight) and one live album (1985's In the Hothouse).  Background  Thunder Up was recorded at Elephant Studio in London. Adam Brent Houghtaling, author of This Will End in Tears, wrote that with Thunder Up, \\"the aggression evident on [the Sound's] earlier releases had largely calmed into a more polished guitar pop\\".  Release  Thunder Up was released in 1987 by Play It Again Sam. The album and its subsequent tour precipitated the band's breakup in early 1988.  Reception  The album was well received immediately on release by The Big Takeover, who acknowledged it as a \\"stunning, moving juggernaut\\". Critical appraisal from the mainstream press the work has largely been absent, although it was championed by Melody Maker upon release: \\"The Sound, by refining their despair, simply amplify their magnificence and magnify the intensity of expression\\". Thunder Up was a favourite among Sound members. Drummer Michael Dudley named it as one of his favourite Sound albums (along with Propaganda), while Graham Bailey called it the band's \\"crowning glory\\". In a 1988 interview, frontman Adrian Borland said, \\"Ultimately I find Thunder Up the very best album, because it sounds like the band 'live' in the studio and, in a way, it actually was\\".

Order of battle Nationalist: *The 34th Army Communist: *4th Column of Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Field army Campaign In early July, 1946, nationalist commander-in-chief of the 2nd War Zone, Yan Xishan, ordered the nationalist 34th Army under his command to attack communists from Jiexiu (‰ªã‰ºë) to help Hu Zongnan's attacks on the communists. The nationalists planned to annihilate their communist enemy in the regions of Hongdong and Zhao (Ëµµ) City in southern Shanxi. However, Hu Zongnan, the nationalist commander-in-chief of the 1st War Zone was soundly defeated by the communists in the Wenxi-Xiaxian Campaign by late July, 1946, and was forced to retreated to Yuncheng and Wenxi (ÈóªÂñú) regions to regroup and thus could not support Yan Xishan's effort. Communists accordingly launched their Northern Shanxi Campaign to further expand their victory. In order to reinforce nationalists in northern Shanxi, Yan Xishan had to redeploy his troops from southern Shanxi, which provided the excellent opportunity for the enemy to strike in the vast region from Lingshi (ÁÅµÁü≥) to Hongdong along the Datong-Puzhou Railway. The communist commanders were quick to seize the opportunity, and struck on August 14, 1946, after marching from Jiang (Áªõ) county and Quwo (Êõ≤Ê≤É) county in secret on August 9 and August 10 respectively. The campaign progressed exactly as communists had planned and ended in their predicated victory. In addition to annihilating more than 10,000 nationalist troops, the victorious communists also succeeded in taking counties / towns including Hongdong on August 16 (killing more than a thousand nationalist troops in the process), Zhao (Ëµµ) City on August 17 (killing more than three thousands nationalist troops in the process), Huo (Èúç) county on August 24, Lingshi (ÁÅµÁü≥) on August 28, and Fenxi (Ê±æË•ø) on August 29. The communists ended the campaign on September 1, 1946 when they took Wealthy Family's Beach (Fu Jia Tan, ÂØåÂÆ∂Êª©). As a result of the defeat, over 130 km stretch of area along the southern section of Datong-Puzhou Railway had fallen into the enemy hands, resulting the linkage between Yan Xishan's 2nd War Zone and Hu Zongnan's 1st War Zone was completely severed, thus making future operations more difficult. Five important local cities / towns were lost to the communists, where they would obtain plenty of supplies. Nationalists were also forced to be on the defensive for sometime after Datong-Puzhou Campaign, while communists took the opportunity to consolidate their gains.

Communist western Hunan Military Sub-District formed the Northern Front Bandit Eradication Command, and made plans with other communist forces in adjacent regions under the direction of communist Hunan Military District. On October 15, 1950, communists attacked the nationalist stronghold in the Dragon (Èæô) Mountain in multiple directions. After more than twenty days of fighting, more than four thousand bandits were annihilated in the northern part of the Dragon (Èæô) Mountain by two battalions of the 421st Regiment of the communist 141st Division. In the meantime, communist troops of the communist Enshi Military Sub-District killed over nineteen hundred bandits of the nationalist Anticommunist Salvation Army of Huan-Hubei-Sichuan Border Region in the Dragon (Èæô) Mountain. Another twelve hundred bandits also surrendered. The commander of the nationalist Anticommunist Salvation Army of the Huan-Hubei-Sichuan Border Region, Qu Boping (ÁûøÊ≥¢Âπ≥), with only several bodyguards left was eventually forced to surrender to the communists on November 1950 with the remaining survivors. To the southwest of the Dragon (Èæô) Mountain, the other band of bandits was also badly mauled by the attacking communists in the border region of Sichuan ‚Äì Hunan. As the nationalist survivors attempted to flee into Sichuan, they were beaten back by the communist forces of the communist Youyang Military Sub- District. The 2nd Battalions of the 422nd Regiment of the communist 141st Division launched a mop up operation with the help of other communist units and succeeded in killing more than nine hundred bandits.

The remnant of the nationalist Temporarily Organized 5th Division fled to the north of Yongshun (Ê∞∏È°∫) County, where they were surrounded by units of the 421st Regiment and units of the 423rd Regiment of the communist 141st Division, and units of the Independent Regiment of communist Enshi Military Sub-District. In the battle at Nine Dragons (‰πùÈæô) Mountain, Cao Zhenya (ÊõπÊåØ‰∫ö), the commander of the nationalist Temporarily Organized 5th Division was killed and the surviving fifteen hundred nationalist guerrillas were completely annihilated. The campaign concluded with communist victory and in addition to annihilating over ten thousand bandits, including more than a hundred and ten nationalist commanders, the communists also managed to capture over seven thousand guns.

The territory that made up the modern country of Ukraine was part of the Russian Empire with a notable southwestern region administered by the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the border between them dating to the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Ukraine's role in the prelude to the war However, as the border did not undermine the ethnic composition of Europe, both Empires towards the latter 19th century, on the tide of rising national awareness of the period attempted to exert their influence on the adjacent territory. For the Russian Empire, viewed Ukrainians as Little Russians and had support of the large Russophile community among the Ukrainian and Ruthenians population in Galicia. Austria on the contrary supported the late-19th century rise in Ukrainian Nationalism. Western Ukraine was a major standoff for the Balkans and the Slavic Orthodox population it harboured. A Balkan war between Austria-Hungary and Serbia was considered inevitable, as Austria-Hungary‚Äôs influence waned and the Pan-Slavic movement grew. The rise of ethnic nationalism coincided with the growth of Serbia, where anti-Austrian sentiment was perhaps most fervent. Austria-Hungary had occupied the former Ottoman province of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which had a large Serb population, in 1878. It was formally annexed by Austria-Hungary in 1908. Increasing nationalist sentiment also coincided with the decline of the Ottoman Empire. Russia supported the Pan-Slavic movement, motivated by ethnic and religious loyalties and a rivalry with Austria dating back to the Crimean War. Recent events such as the failed Russian-Austrian treaty and a century- old dream of a warm water port also motivated St. Petersburg. Religion also played a key role in the standoff. When Russia and Austria partitioned Poland at the end of the 18th century, they inherited largely Eastern-rite Catholic populations. Russia went to great lengths to revert the population to Orthodoxy, often peacefully (see Synod of Polotsk), but at times forcibly (as took place in Chelm)Himka, John Paul. (1999). Religion and Nationality in Western Ukraine. McGill-Queen's University Press: Montreal and Kingston. pp. 32-33. The final factor was that by 1914, Ukrainian nationalism had matured to a point where it could significantly influence the future of the region. As a result of this nationalism and of the other main sources of Russo-Austrian confrontations, including Polish and Romanian lands, both empires eventually lost these disputed territories when these territories formed new, independent states according to Ivan Rudnytsky. Outbreak Eastern Front on the verge of conflict in 1914 The Russian advance into Galicia began in August 1914. During the offensive, the Russian army successfully pushed the Austrians right up to the Carpathian ridge effectively capturing all of the lowland territory, and fulfilling their long aspirations of annexing the territory. Ukrainians were split into two separate and opposing armies. 3.5 million fought with the Imperial Russian Army, while 250,000 fought for the Austro-Hungarian Army. Many Ukrainians thus ended up fighting each other. Also, many Ukrainian civilians suffered as armies shot and killed them after accusing them of collaborating with opposing armies (see Ukrainian Austrian internment). Ukraine after the Russian Revolution of 1917 February 1918 article from The New York Times showing a map of the Russian Imperial territories claimed by Ukraine People‚Äôs Republic at the time, before the annexation of the Austro- Hungarian lands of the West Ukrainian People's Republic Special edition of the L√ºbeckischen Anzeigen, Headline: Peace with the Ukraine (February 9, 1918) Map of the Lemko, West- Ukrainien & Hutsul claims (1918) During World War I the western Ukrainian people were situated between Austria-Hungary and Russia. Ukrainian villages were regularly destroyed in the crossfire. Ukrainians could be found participating on both sides of the conflict. In Galicia, over twenty thousand Ukrainians who were suspected of being sympathetic to Russian interests were arrested and placed in Austrian concentration camps, both in Talerhof, Styria and in Terez√≠n fortress (now in the Czech Republic). The brutality did not end with the end of the First World War for Ukrainians. Fighting actually escalated with the beginning of the Russian Revolution of 1917. The revolution began a civil war within the Russian Empire and much of the fighting took place in the Ukrainian provinces. Many atrocities occurred during the civil war as the Red, White, Polish, Ukrainian, and allied armies marched throughout the country. There were couple of attempts during this period when the Ukrainians successfully established their own state. One was with the capital in Kyiv and the other in Lviv, but neither one of them gained enough support in the international community and they both failed. The 1919 Treaty of Versailles secured the Ukrainian land after other European countries. In the west, Galicia and western Volhynia were left to Poland. The Kingdom of Romania stayed the Bukovina province. Czechoslovakia secured former lands of the Austria-Hungary, Uzhhorod and Mukachevo. The remaining central and eastern Ukrainian provinces were left to the brotherly Soviet Union. As a result of World War I and the Russian Civil War, Ukrainians saw as their attempt to attain a statehood crumbled in favor of other countries when 1.5 million had lost their lives while fighting for it. With the end of World War I the Ukrainian national movement went underground.

The campaign was fought during the Chinese Civil War in the post-World War II era in western Hunan Province, and resulted in a PLA victory. This campaign was part of Campaign to Suppress Bandits in Central and Southern China. Prelude After most part of Hunan had fallen into communist hands, the surviving nationalist troops joined bandits in the period from June 1950 - September 1950 in western Hunan to continue their anticommunist struggles and reorganized into the Anticommunist National Salvation Army totaling more than 23,000 troops, controlling regions with more than a million population. After communists secured central Hunan, they turned their attention to western Hunan and begun to plan the complete eradication of bandits in the region. A total of more than 40,000 troops were mobilized, mostly from the Hunan Military District of the communist Central and Southern China Military Region. Troops of the communist 47th Army, 136th Division, and other communist detachments in the adjacent provinces including that of Sichuan, Hubei and Guizhou were assigned to two commands, the northern command and the southern command, respectively commanded by the communist Western Hunan Military District commander-in-chief Cao Lihuai (ÊõπÈáåÊÄÄ) and deputy commander-in-chief Liu Xianquan (ÂàòË¥§ÊùÉ). Campaign The campaign was fought in two stages, with the first stage lasting from October 15, 1950, to November 15, 1950. The communists amassed a total of ten regiments to first attack bandits in northern region of western Hunan based in the Dragon (Long, Èæô) Mountains. After ten days of continuous attacks, the local bandits were completely annihilated. A half- month-long mop-up operation continued, finally resulting in the annihilation of over four thousand bandits. In the south, on October 20, 1950, communists took the town of Suining (Áª•ÂÆÅ) and Jing (Èùñ) County occupied by the bandits and surrounded over six thousands bandits by cutting off their escape route to the north. After fierce battles which ended on November 15, 1950, over 5,500 bandits were annihilated, and Jiang Xieqin (ËíãÁáÆÁê¥), the local nationalist commander-in-chief of the Third Front Army of the Southern China Anticommunist National Salvation Army, was captured alive. The second stage of the campaign begun in mid-November 1950. Communists deployed a total of eleven regiments, seven of which were assigned to conduct local mopping up operations. Another four communist regiments attacked and took regions including Nine Dragons Mountain (Jiulongshan, ‰πùÈæôÂ±±), Phoenix (Âá§Âá∞), Mayang, (È∫ªÈò≥), Huang (ÊôÉ) County, and Passage (Tongdao, ÈÄöÈÅì), and by the end of December 1950, the local bandits were completely annihilated. The campaign concluded with communist victory and the complete elimination of the problem of bandits that plagued western Hunan for several centuries.

He was good at perspective but later took up portrait painting with Michiel Jansz van Mierevelt. Van Vliet started out with architectural painting, particularly the painting of church interiors. Before him, architectural painting had been pioneered by Pieter Saenredam, who introduced innovative techniques of perspective. By mid century, architectural painting gained great popularity.

Previously to his career as an artist, Aguilera was awarded the sixth Dan in Kung Fu when he was just 26 years old. Biography Aguilera was born in Catia, one of the poor neighborhoods surrounding Caracas. His mother died at birth and he was raised by his grandmother and other relatives. At age 6, he was making a living as a shoe polisher while attending primary school. After graduating from high school in 1978 from the Colegio San Agustin, Julio studied at the Instituto Pedag√≥gico de Caracas. Aguilera was inclined towards the arts since he was in primary school, and he began painting at a young age after a local painter gave him a handful of used brushes and half-empty tubes of oil paint.Julio Aguilera: A Venezuelan Artist Makes His Mark in North America Ed McCormack. Gallery & Studio, March, 2005 However strong, his artistic inclinations had to take a back seat for several years while Aguilera struggled to move out of the slums. During this time, he painted mostly for enjoyment, giving away his canvases to friends and relatives while he made his way through school. While at the Instituto Pedag√≥gico, Julio enrolled himself in the academy of Chan Lee Kam Fai, one of Venezuela's most renowned martial arts training academies., unbeknownst Julio, he would later become the future president of the Venezuelan Federation of Chinese Martial Arts and the International Hung Sing Choy Li Fat Chan Kim Fay. This decision temporarily separated him from his artistic career due to the success he would enjoy as a martial artist. In July, 1978, Aguilera earned the black belt in the Choy Lay Fut Kung-Fu style, and during that and the following year he participated in several international competitions and exhibitions, including the Muay Thai World Championship in Manila, Philippines, the Barehand Championship in China and the International Martial Arts Open of Puerto Rico, which he won in 1979. From that year until 1981, he stayed on the Caribbean island, working as a trainer in Santurce, until he was handpicked to co-develop in Venezuela Top Spa Gym at the time the most successful gym in Caracas, located in Las Mercedes sector of the city. Two years later, he was part of the Venezuelan Martial Arts team at the 1983 Pan American Games in the same city. In 1983, Aguilera met and married Janice Tuohy, an American choreographer working in the local theater and TV industry. With Touht he opened a multidisciplinary academy with dancing and languages training directed by Touht herself and other Venezuelan professionals such as Anita Vivas, Antonio Drija and Betty Kaplan. The academy didn't last a year and in 1984, Julio and his wife moved to the United States. After a brief stay in New York City, in 1985 Julio moved to Diamond Bar, California, and opened another martial arts academy under the name \\"Eagle Lighting\\". This time, the business was a success and in a few years he opened other branches in Marina del Rey, San Jos√© and Sacramento. It was while he taught Martial Arts in California that he won the Bare Hand Kung- Fu World Championship in August 1987. That same month, he was awarded the 6th Dan in China Kung-Fu, I Ching Kung-Fu by the International Kung Fu Federation. Despite all those achievements, Aguilera retired from Martial Arts in 1987, closed down the academies and moved to New York City with his wife. During the following years he flirted with corporate America and the tried opening a few businesses himself, but the Californian success didn't repeat in New York City, where he divorced Janice Touht in 2001. During his years in California, Julio always kept a studio inside the academy, where he painted with lukewarm success. After the several failed business ventures, he began painting professionally around 1997. That year, he bought fifty canvases and in three months developed what is known as the Blue Series. Aguilera promoted these pieces through web forums and the Venezuelan Consulate in New York, and by 2000 his work had been exhibited in Spain, Argentina and Venezuela in sold-out shows. After a show in the Venezuelan Consulate in 2003, Julio was appointed as the Venezuelan Cultural Attach√© in New York City, a position he held until 2006. At the same time, he became the General Manager of the El Nuevo Cojo Ilustrado a Hispanic general interest magazine based in Harlem, and started to experiment with bronze, producing a series of statues from his studio in New Jersey. About his art, critics are uniform about Aguilera's style. He's unashamed about the influence of Picasso and other Spanish master like Goya, El Greco and Vel√°zquez. And according to the art critic Ed McCormack, Managing Editor of Gallery & Studio Magazine, \\"more than any other artist in the Hispanic Diaspora, Aguilera has brought new blood, so to speak, to that still vital tradition, which came to encompass not only the spirit of Spain but all the antique cultural booty that the canny old pirate, Picasso, looted from France Italy and the North.\\"Julio Aguilera's Passionate Bid for the Mantle of the \\"Old Man\\" Ed McCormack.

The term Blue Card was coined by the think tank Bruegel, inspired by the United States' Green Card and making reference to the European flag which is blue with twelve golden stars. The Blue Card proposal presented by the European Commission offers a one-track procedure for non-EU citizens to apply for a work permit, which would be valid for up to three years, but can be renewed thereafter. Those who are granted a blue card will be given a series of rights, such as favourable family reunification rules. The proposal also encourages geographic mobility within the EU, between different member states, for those who have been granted a blue card. The legal basis for this proposal was Article 63(3) and (4) of the Treaty of Rome (now Article 79 TFEU). Proposal The blue card proposal was presented at a press conference in Strasbourg on 23 October 2007, by the President of the European Commission Jos√© Manuel Barroso and Commissioner for Justice, Freedom and Security Franco Frattini. Barroso explained the motives behind the proposal as: The EU's future lack of labour and skills; the difficulty for third country workers to move between different member states for work purposes; the conflicting admission procedures for the 27 different member states, and the \\"rights gap\\" between EU citizens and legal immigrants. The proposal was presented along with another proposal, COM(2007)638, which includes a simplified application procedure and a common set of rights for legal third-country workers. The name 'blue card' is chosen to signal potential immigrants that the blue card is the European alternative to the US Green card. The colour blue is the predominant colour of the European Union. International reaction Shortly after the proposal was presented, it received heavy criticism from governments of developing countries, for its perceived functionality in snatching up talented workers. South African Minister of Health Manto Tshabalala-Msimang pointed to the fact that several African countries already suffer from the migration of skilled health workers and said that this proposal might worsen the situation. Moroccan international economic law professor Tajeddine El Husseini went further, saying that this \\"is a new form of colonisation, of discrimination, and it will be very hard to find support for it among southern countries\\". A 2011 thesis by A. Bj√∂rklund on Possible Impacts of the EU Blue Card Directive on Developing Countries of Origin through Migration of Skilled Workers with a focus on the Republic of Mali concludes that skilled Malian migrants in general seem to depart with the intention at the outset to return to their home country after a certain period of time, bringing with them significant human capital in the forms of skills, experience, information and a different view on methods of working. During their stay abroad, remittances from expatriates often represent an important source of income to the country of origin. Approval On 20 November 2008 the European Parliament backed the introduction of the blue card while recommending some safeguards against brain drain and advocated greater flexibility for EU Member States. Many of these suggestions, though, were ignored in the subsequent legislation which was passed on 25 May 2009. Some compromises were made, as \\"Member States to set quotas on Blue Card holders or to ban them altogether if they see fit.\\" The Blue Card rules also could run into problems with the European Permanent Residency Directive. Some EU Member States are not in compliance with implementing the EU Blue Card program. Despite having been warned in July 2011, Austria, Cyprus and Greece have not yet transposed the rules of the Blue Card Directive, which should have been implemented before 19 June 2011. Implementation As of August 2020, European countries vary wildly in the amount of issued Blue Cards. Cyprus, Greece and Netherlands have not yet issues any cards, while Germany had issued 27,000, followed by France with 1,500. Even years after the transposition deadline passed, some Member States (such as Spain and Belgium) have yet to fully enact the law or give the rights fully promised in the directive. Already, think tanks have presented ideas designed to supplement the Blue Card and its weaknesses. HBS Discussion Paper Germany had enacted the Blue Card legislation partially as of April 2012 focusing on language skills and areas of need such as engineering, mathematics and IT. As of 1 January 2014, Germany had given out 7,000 Blue Cards. 4,000 of these were given to foreigners who were already living in Germany. However, as of 1 January 2018, Germany is still unable to issue Blue Cards for workers that are eligible due to experience. A dedicated EU Blue Card section was added to the EU Immigration Portal on 7 June 2016. The site provides country-specific information to potential Blue Card applicants. It states that only EU Member State authorities may issue Blue Cards and warns against any unofficial application sites which may contain incorrect information or charge for their services. Requirements To apply for a Blue Card, applicants must: * prove 'higher professional qualifications' (education of 3+ years, or relevant work experience of 5+ years) * fulfill the legal requirements, for regulated professions * work as a paid employee - the EU Blue Card does not apply to self-employed work or entrepreneurs * have the necessary travel documents and health insurance * have a work contract or binding job offer in an EU country for at least one year, * with a salary of at least 1.5 times the average gross annual salary paid in the Member State After obtaining the Blue Card, the applicant must not change jobs for 2 years, and may not work in other EU countries for 18 months.

She was arrested in the front parlor after attempting to vote in the 1872 Presidential Election. She resided here until her death. The house was purchased for use as a memorial in 1945, and declared a National Historic Landmark in 1965. and It has been documented in the Historic American Buildings Survey. The Susan B. Anthony House is located at 17 Madison Street in Rochester. Access to the house is through the Susan B. Anthony Museum entrance at 19 Madison Street. Today the Susan B. Anthony House is a learning center and museum open to the public for tours and programs from 11-5 Tuesday through Sunday, except major holidays. Its full name is the National Susan B. Anthony Museum & House. The Visitor Center and Museum Shop are located in the historic house next door, 19 Madison Street, which was owned by Hannah Anthony Mosher, sister of Susan and Mary Anthony. The mission of the Susan B. Anthony House is to keep Susan B. Anthony's vision alive and relevant. The house hosts an annual celebration of Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which gave women the right to vote. In 2011, the New York Times reported that the museum at the house had sold a large quantity of \\"a $250 handbag made of fake alligator that was inspired by one of Anthony‚Äôs own club bags, similar to a doctor‚Äôs bag,\\" noting that for Anthony, \\"a bag was not a fashion statement but a symbol of independence at a time when women were not allowed to enter into a contract or even open a bank account.\\" Papers and memorabilia about the suffrage movement were donated to the house at the request of Carrie Chapman Catt, Susan B. Anthony's successor as President of the National American Woman Suffrage Association. They are held by the River Campus Libraries of the University of Rochester. The House's president wrote to \\"decline\\" President Donald Trump's August 2020 pardon to Anthony, on the principle that to accept a pardon would wrongly \\"validate\\" the trial proceedings in the same manner that paying the $100 fine would have. ‚óè File:PERSPECTIVE VIEW OF NORTH AND WEST ELEVATIONS - Susan B.

Early career Wood was born in Petersburg, Virginia. He attended Randolph- Macon College from 1925 until entering the United States Military Academy in 1926. Upon graduating on June 12, 1930, he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Coast Artillery Corps. During World War II, Wood served in the Mediterranean theater, advancing through the grades from captain to colonel. As a lieutenant colonel, he served in the G-3 section of the Fifth Army staff under Major General Alfred M. Gruenther, future NATO supreme commander. Following the war, he attended the National War College and served as a military aide to Secretary of Defense James Forrestal. NATO In 1951, Wood was assigned to the Advanced Planning Group charged with creating Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE), the NATO headquarters organization. The chief of the Advanced Planning Group was now-Lieutenant General Alfred Gruenther, who was still using Wood as his \\"personal dog robber\\", or staff troubleshooter, so Wood took the job of staff secretary as it seemed to them to be the best control point. \\"General Gruenther is an extremely able staff officer,\\" Wood later observed. \\"I learned more about staff work in the 5th Army and SHAPE from him than I ever did at Leavenworth Command and General Staff School.\\" As staff secretary, Wood dealt with a diverse set of issues ranging from critical tasks such as helping the planning group organize itself while concurrently working out the nature and organization of the command as a whole, developing the necessary infrastructure, and transitioning the previous planning groups into the actual command headquarters organization; to comparatively trivial tasks such as devising the SHAPE logo and mottoThe SHAPE insignia: A corporation by a Parisian designer, an Irish Lawyer (*1750) and General Eisenhower and rescheduling the SHAPE activation date to avoid April Fool's Day. Following SHAPE's activation on April 2, 1951, Wood continued to serve as secretary of the staff at SHAPE headquarters until May 1952, when he was promoted to brigadier general and assigned as Chief of the Defense Annual Review Team for the U.S. Mission to NATO and the European Regional Organization (USRO). In July 1953, he was assigned as deputy defense advisor to the United States Ambassador to NATO in Paris, France. Senior positions In January 1956 he was appointed deputy commanding general of the U.S. Army Antiaircraft Artillery and Guided Missile Center at Fort Bliss, Texas,Oozlefinch Award and became commanding general of Fort Bliss and commandant of the Antiaircraft Artillery and Guided Missile School on May 1, 1956. On July 1, 1957, Wood was assigned as the Army's Deputy Chief of Research and Development, working on a variety of projects including antimissile weapons and germ and gas warfare systems. He served on the Army Aircraft Requirements Review Board, also known as the Rogers Board, which was established on January 15, 1960, by the Army Chief of Staff to review the Army Aircraft Development Plan and the related industry proposals. The Rogers Board's members included Major Generals Hamilton H. Howze, Thomas F. Van Natta, Alva R. Fitch, Richard D. Meyer, Ernest F. Easterbrook, and chairman Lieutenant General Gordon B. Rogers; and its results prefigured the more influential Howze Board on airmobility. In 1960, he was promoted to lieutenant general and assigned as commanding general of the Army Air Defense Command (ARADCOM) in Colorado Springs, Colorado, assuming command on August 1, 1960. Director of Military Assistance On September 1, 1962, he succeeded General Williston B. Palmer as director of the military assistance program in the office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, with rank of full general. The Director of Military Assistance supervised the operational details of arms transfer to NATO allies and other friendly countries, as guided by the State Department. As chief of staff of the foreign military aid program, he was considered to be on the same level as the chiefs of staff of the Army, Navy, and Air Force and of comparable military rank, but without a seat on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. When Wood retired, the position was downgraded to three stars and eventually its title was changed to deputy assistant secretary of defense (international security affairs) for military assistance and sales. Retirement Wood retired on September 1, 1965, but was recalled to active duty on February 1, 1968, to serve as Director of the Overseas Base Requirements Study Group, a special interdepartmental study group planning future overseas military base locations. Upon completion of this assignment, he returned to the retired list on March 31, 1969. He subsequently served on a presidential task force on international development and consulted for the Research Analysis Corporation in McLean, Virginia. He married the former Sarah Thomas on September 4, 1930. He died on July 8, 1986, and was survived by his wife and one daughter. His awards and decorations include the Distinguished Service Medal, Legion of Merit (2), and the Purple Heart. He attended the Coast Artillery School, the Command and General Staff School, the Armed Forces Staff College, and the National War College.

In 2007, he was crowned the North America's Strongest Man, an event that featured six Canadian and six American strongman athletes. Jessen won this title again in 2008. Paulin first entered the Canadian Strongmen spotlight in 1999 in which he first reached the Canada's Strongest Man finals and finished in 9th place. Paulin received most of his training with the help of Girard and often shared the same training routine. It was in 2002, that Paulin first reached the World Stage by finishing second in Canada's Strongest Man and repeated the same feat in 2003 and 2004. In 2003, Jessen qualified for the finals for the first and only time at the World's Strongest Man competition, eventually finishing in 8th place. In 2004, Girard suffered a major foot injury which kept him sidelined from the main competition for nearly two years. Paulin took advantage of Girard's absence in 2005 to become Canada's Strongest Man for the first time and reaching the world stage for the third time in four years. However, Paulin did not reached the Grand Finals of the competition. In 2006, after successfully defending the Canadian crown, Paulin participated for the fourth time in the World Strongest's Man Competition held in China but finished in 5th position of his group during the first round. His group included former World's Strongest Man Mariusz Pudzianowski. In 2007, after finishing second behind Dominic Filiou in Canada's Strongest Man, Paulin qualified for the World's Strongest Man competition for the third year in a row and fifth time in six years after winning the North America's Strongest Man competition which was held in his hometown during the Gatineau Hot Air Balloon Festival. Paulin, finished ahead of American competitor Brian Shaw by way of a tie-braker after both finished the competition with 83 points In that event, Hugo Girard who attempted a comeback withdrew from the competition due to another injury. Jessen was scheduled to compete at the 2008 inaugural Fortissimus strongman event, but withdrew and officially retired from international strongman competition.

After being pressured by their record label to release a more commercially successful album, since their previous records failed to attract the attention of the public, The Sound rebelled and recorded All Fall Down, which has been called \\"distinctly uncommercial\\". The album was poorly received by critics and led to the termination of The Sound's contract with WEA. No singles were released from the album.  Background  On the album, Andy Kellman of AllMusic opined, \\"there was no attempt at making a hit. [...] The Sound responded to label demands and simmering internal pressures with a record that challenged devout fans as well.\\" Drummer Mike Dudley said of the album: > We thought [the label wasn't] giving us the support that we were due and > that if they really wanted a commercial album, they had got to put plenty of > money behind it, which with both Jeopardy and From the Lions Mouth they > hadn't really done [...] So when they turned around and said, 'The solution > is for you to write more commercial songs', we thought, 'Fuck you', and went > ahead and produced All Fall Down.  Release  All Fall Down was released in 23 October 1982. No singles were released from the album. It failed to chart in the UK and received a negative response from critics. WEA were displeased with the album and decided not to promote it, and The Sound's contract with them was terminated.  Reception  All Fall Down received a negative critical reception upon its release. Johnny Waller of Sounds panned the album, writing, \\"This is the album The Sound should never have made, didn't need to make, could have made in their sleep [...] [it] adds virtually nothing to the minimalist passion of Jeopardy and the following, more impressively structured From the Lions Mouth and, as such, is virtually worthless\\", concluding the review with \\"Look in the mirror, Adrian, before you all fall down\\". A favourable review came from Trouser Press, which said, \\"The black, clashing music makes the challenging LP an acquired taste, an ambitious, admirable exploration of the downside\\".

The town is between Punta Piedras hill to the north and Punta del Marqu√©s to the south. Punta del Marqu√©s, a geographical landmark on San Jorge Gulf, reaches a height of , and extends into the sea for . The area was first populated at least 9,000 years ago, and was first recorded by Captain Robert FitzRoy during his voyage on HMS Beagle in the early 1830s (best known for its impact on the naturalist Charles Darwin). The municipality was established on July 24, 1948, as part of a nature conservation effort in the area during the administration of President Juan Per√≥n. It was named for the Marquess Francisco Everardo Tilly y Paredes, a captain of the Spanish Armada who defeated Portuguese forces on the R√≠o de la Plata, in 1795; is \\"roadstead\\" and also \\"inlet\\" in Spanish. The municipality is home to a growing population, which reached 6,208 in the 2001 Census, and has doubled every decade since 1980; its estimated population, per the provincial statistical bureau, was 9,226 in 2008. A beach resort city, Rada Tilly became one of the main recreational spots for visitors from nearby Comodoro Rivadavia, a city to the north. Many people living primarily in Comodoro Rivadavia also own second homes in Rada Tilly. These second homes serve the purpose of a lake home or a cabin for many residents; thus providing an escape from the busy city life of el centro in Comodoro. Municipal beach The main attraction of the city is its coastline, extending for , covered in fine sand. This uninterrupted geographical feature allows for the enjoyment of numerous leisure activities such as football, beach volleyball, and walking, as well as windsurfing, kitesurfing, diving, snorkeling, trekking, motocross, and mountain bicycling. Landsailing (three-wheeled carts with a sail attached to them that move with the force of the wind) is a popular spectator sport in Rada Tilly, and the 2008 Landsailing World Cup was held on these beaches. Rada Tilly features one of the longest Seabee seawalls in the world, comparable to that at Blackpool South Shore [UK], but comprising smaller units. The beach is very flat and is very wide at low tide. It is also quite dynamic, with back beach elevation varying by as much as 3m, depending on the season [as derived from photos on Panoramio]. The production techniques evolved by Corporacion Tecnologica Argentina produced over 500 units per shift. Rada Tilly is also a popular fishing destination, and the wide range of fish includes salmon, hake, and sea bass, among others.  Wildlife and vegetation  Punta del Marqu√©s From a lookout point on Punta del Marqu√©s, opened at the site in February 1986, a natural reserve for sea lions can be observed. Other fauna include oysters and seagulls, which frequent the area's coast to feed. Among the variety of flora found along Punta del Marqu√©s are local species such as u√±a de gato, zampa, Adesmia, malaspina, duraznillo, and coiro predominate.

He first appeared in Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!. He is the smallest and youngest of all the boxers in the games, being only 17 years old across all Punch-Out!! games. His signature attack is the \\"Star Uppercut\\". His design was changed for the SNES Super Punch-Out!!, but reverted to his original design in the Wii title. In the NES and Wii games, Little Mac is accompanied by Doc Louis, his trainer. In addition to his own series, Little Mac has made multiple cameo appearances in and out of video games; video games include Captain Rainbow, Fight Night Round 2 and the Super Smash Bros. series, while he appeared in a variety of comic books, including those created by Valiant Comics. Little Mac has received positive reception since his debut and has been regarded as one of the best protagonists in video games by multiple publications. Appearances Little Mac first appeared in the NES video game Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!, a sequel to the arcade game Punch-Out!!. He has appeared as the main protagonist in every Punch-Out!! game since. His next appearance was in Super Punch-Out!! for the Super NES, which gave him a drastically different design. Most recently in his series, he appeared in the Wii video game Punch-Out!!. Little Mac has made multiple cameo appearances. His first was in the GameCube version of Fight Night Round 2, where his SNES incarnation is featured as a playable character alongside the ability to play the entire SNES game. He appeared in the Wii video game Captain Rainbow, which featured a variety of obscure Nintendo characters, as an \\"overweight has- been\\". Mac also appeared as an Assist Trophy in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, assisting players who summoned him. Little Mac joined the playable roster in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, where he is a fighter who is fast and strong on the ground, but is substantially weaker in the air. A mechanic unique to Little Mac is the Power Meter, drawn from the arcade titles, which builds as Mac deals and receives damage. When the meter is full, Mac gains access to the K.O. Uppercut. Little Mac makes a return appearance in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Little Mac's green headgear is featured as downloadable content in the Wii game Animal Crossing: City Folk, which players could put on their characters in the game. The game Abobo's Big Adventure, a fan game which features numerous Nintendo characters, featured Little Mac as its final boss. Little Mac is also featured as the protagonist in the Punch- Out!! stories featured in Valiant Comics' Nintendo Comics System. He appears in the stories \\"The First Fight\\", \\"Outsiders\\", and \\"Fox and Hounds.\\" Mac also makes a cameo in the prologue short of the Captain N comic books. Concept and creation Little Mac has traditionally been depicted as Caucasian with black hair; he usually wears a black tank top, green shorts, and green boxing gloves. He was originally going to be named Peter Punch, but this was changed before the game's debut.Sheff, David. \\"Game Over: How Nintendo Conquered the World. Vintage, 1994. P 312. . He is 17 years old, 140 centimeters tall (170 cm in the Wii version), and hails from The Bronx. This makes him the shortest and youngest boxer in all of the Punch-Out!! games. In the NES game, players took control of Mac against the taller opponents, where Mac could only dodge in various directions, block, and perform stomach punches, uppercuts, and the \\"Star Uppercut\\". Mac can perform the Star Uppercut by collecting stars, which are obtained by attacking opponents in specific ways. Mac has a stamina meter; if it runs out, he turns pink and must be given time to recover. If he is knocked down, players must mash the A button to make him stand up. The identity of the player character in Super Punch-Out!! is the source of contention; Bryce Holliday, one of the main developers of the Wii version of Punch-Out, states that the player character in Super Punch-Out is not Little Mac. However, during the North American and European Virtual Console releases of the SNES title, Nintendo of America and Europe have claimed that Little Mac is in the SNES game.Wii Shop Channel details for Super Punch-Out!!. Retrieved on March 30, 2009. The history section of the official website for the Wii version of Punch-Out!! also states that the character is Little Mac.Official Punch-Out!! (Wii version) website of America According to Nintendo of America, the SNES title takes place after the events of the NES and Wii titles of the series; Little Mac looks different because he was given a makeover, and his repertoire has expanded since separating from Doc Louis, including the \\"Knockout Punch\\" and the \\"Rapid Punch\\". Boxer Paulie Malignaggi portrayed Little Mac in an American commercial for the Wii version of Punch-Out!! Before the SNES Super Punch-Out!! was finished and released, some screenshots and video footage of the prototype seen in gaming magazines showed him with a different look compared to his final version seen in the finished and released version. and two official television commercials Instead of using stars to do powerful attacks, Little Mac builds up a strength meter by doing well against his opponents, like in the arcade versions of Punch-Out!!. It will lower when he is hit or when the opponent blocks his attack. He was voiced in Punch-Out!! for Wii by Matt Harty, a sound designer for Next Level Games. Unlike his opponents, his design in Punch-Out!! for Wii has not changed much. They specifically kept him as a silent protagonist due to how similar the Wii game is to the NES game as well as the tradition of silent Nintendo protagonists such as Kirby, Link, and Ness. The designers also wanted Mac to be an avatar for the player. They were originally going to allow players to upgrade Little Mac's abilities; however, they felt that it would take away from the challenge of overcoming opponents, as well as diminish peoples' interests in Little Mac. In 2009, he was portrayed by former professional boxer Paulie Malignaggi in an American commercial for Punch-Out!! on the Wii. In an interview, Malignaggi commented that he was asked to play a \\"young Italian-American guy, good looking with a cocky attitude and a heavy New York accent\\". The Wii game adds a multi-player mode, where a second player can take control of an alternate Mac. In this mode, either player can transform into Giga Mac, a larger and more powerful version of Mac. Giga Mac's name was planned to be \\"Big Mac\\" in keeping with the \\"little\\" in Little Mac's name, but this was changed to avoid comparison to McDonald's Big Mac. Reception Since his appearance in the Punch-Out!! series, Little Mac has received generally positive reception, and is regarded as a major Nintendo character. GameSpot featured him in a user poll as part of the \\"all time greatest video game hero\\" contest. Nintendo Power listed Little Mac as their 11th favorite hero, stating that he taught gamers that more intimidating foes can be overcome by patience, persistence, and \\"pattern recognition\\". GamesRadar listed him as the 68th greatest video game hero, and called him the \\"definition of an underdog hero\\", due to fighting much larger opponents than himself. GamesRadar's Mikel Reparaz listed Mac's Star Uppercut as one of the most satisfying uppercuts in video games. However, Little Mac has also received criticism. Both his updated design and Doc Louis' absence were listed by NintendoWorldReport's Neal Ronaghan as weak points of Super Punch-Out!! In their list of the top five racist video games, 1UP.com listed the Punch-Out!! franchise, and referred to Little Mac as the \\"Great White Hope\\" relative to the stereotypical character designs of his opponents. The Escapists Sumantra Lahiri wrote that Little Mac was the only boxer in the game who did not have a \\"negative stereotype associated with him\\". After being a long-time requested inclusion within the Super Smash Bros. series, Little Mac made his debut in the series in Super Smash Bros. Brawl as an \\"Assist Trophy\\", a non-playable character that assists the fighter who summoned them. The series' subsequent installments, Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, transitioned Mac into a full-fledged playable character. In addition to using his updated design from the Wii version of Punch-Out!!, his Giga Mac transformation from that same game is also featured as his \\"Final Smash\\", a one-use special move that can only be activated upon breaking a \\"Smash Ball\\". Little Mac also appears as a playable character in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, although his Final Smash has been modified like other transformation-esque Final Smashes. Little Mac's reputation as an underdog has also made its way into the Smash fanbase, as his moveset in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate has been met with harsh criticism as he is one of the easiest characters to defeat once off stage, but maintains one of the best ground games in the entire series, leaving fans polarized about his playstyle. Prior to his inclusion in the Super Smash Bros. series, Gamasutra's Kyle Orland commented that Little Mac's absence from it was \\"mind-boggling\\". The qualities listed included his popularity, fighting ability, and \\"retro cred\\"; Orland felt that it did not make sense to feature characters such as Ice Climbers and Mr. Game & Watch instead of Mac. IGN's Lucas M. Thomas and Matt Casamassina expressed disappointment that Little Mac was not playable in Brawl, and suggested that perhaps series creator Masahiro Sakurai could not think of a good moveset for him. Little Mac has also been featured in a number of merchandise items and collectibles. As part of a \\"boxing challenge\\" held by Nintendo at its Nintendo World store in Rockefeller Plaza, Nintendo awarded, in part, a training sweatshirt similar to Little Mac's. Nintendo also released a pair of Little Mac-signed green boxing gloves on Amazon.com, which were contained in a wood frame and casing. The band Game Over created a song called \\"Little Mac's Confession\\", which follows Little Mac's \\"crushing KO\\" against Mr. Dream.

Early life and education Nowell was born in Salt Lake City, Utah. When he was four years old, his parents divorced and he and his mother moved to Southern California. That same year (1948), his mother married Robert Williamson King and she had Claude's name legally changed to Claude Rex King. When he was young, Claude was given the nickname \\"Corky\\" which was how he was known to friends and family. Up until 1959, Nowell lived in Monrovia, California. Then his family moved to Tustin, California, where he graduated from Tustin High School in 1962. He went on to attend Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa and earned an Associate of Science in Construction Technology. Nowell moved back to Salt Lake City in 1964 and legally changed his name back to Claude Rex Nowell. He attended Brigham Young University and graduated from the University of Utah.  Career  =Founding of Summum= In 1975, Nowell founded Summum following an experience he describes as an encounter with highly intelligent beings. The purpose of Summum is to share with others the information he received from his encounter and to provide an environment for those on a path of spiritual development. In 1980, Nowell legally changed his name to Summum Bonum Amon Ra as a representation of his spiritual path. =Pyramid and winery= In 1978, Nowell began construction of a pyramid that would be used as a winery to produce Summum Soma Nectar. Despite Utah's strict liquor laws and the rigid controls it places on alcoholic beverages, a Utah law allowed him to establish the winery provided the wine was used for religious purposes. The winery was established in 1980 and is one of very few in the state of Utah. The Soma Nectar is also referred to as Nectar Publications and are used in a practice of meditation for the purpose of developing mystical potentials. =Modern mummification= Through Summum, Nowell re-introduced mummification in a modernized form and at one point was a licensed funeral director in the state of California. Nowell has been referred to as \\"the father of modern mummification,\\" and the mummification services offered by Summum have received attention in international publications. The process begins with the body's submersion in fluids for 77 days and is complex, requiring about 1,000 hours of labor over six months. Those wishing to be mummified write a \\"spiritual will\\" outlining where they hope their soul will go in the next lifetime, to be read to their body at least once a day during its 77 days of submersion. The first human to undergo the mummification process was Nowell himself, who died in January 2008. His body is encased inside a bronze mummiform (casket) that is covered in gold and stands inside the group's pyramid. =Summum philosophy and litigation= Since founding Summum, Nowell, under the name of Summum Bonum Amen Ra, has authored books published by Summum that delve into the organization's philosophy. In one of the books, Ra outlines principles upon which the Summum philosophy is based. Summum has requested that monuments displaying these principles, known as the \\"Seven Aphorisms\\", be placed next to Ten Commandments monuments in city parks. In one case, where the city of Duchesne, Utah rejected the request, Summum filed a lawsuit on the basis of freedom of speech and discrimination. The city opted to relocate its monument rather than allowing Summum to erect its monument, rendering the lawsuit moot and leading to its dismissal. Another lawsuit, Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, was unanimously decided by the Supreme Court against Summum. The case could have national implications and could potentially impact many of America's cities.  Personal life  Nowell was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He had two children. Upon Nowell's death in 2008, he became the first human to be mummified using Summum techniques.

Choices & connections: an introduction to communication. 2nd ed., Bedford/St. Martins, 2017. These displays can be through facial expressions, gestures and body language, volume and tone of voice, laughing, crying, etc. Affect displays can be altered or faked so one may appear one way, when they feel another (i.e. smiling when sad). Affect can be conscious or non-conscious and can be discreet or obvious.Batson, C.D., Shaw, L. L., Oleson, K. C. (1992). \\"Emotion\\". Differentiating affect, mood and emotion: Toward functionally based conceptual distinctions. Newbury Park, CA: Sage. The display of positive emotions, such as smiling, laughing, etc., is termed \\"positive affect\\", while the displays of more negative emotions, such as crying and tense gestures, is respectively termed \\"negative affect\\". Affect is important in psychology as well as in communication, mostly when it comes to interpersonal communication and non- verbal communication. In both psychology and communication, there are a multitude of theories that explain affect and its impact on humans and quality of life. Theoretical perspective Affect can be taken to indicate an instinctual reaction to stimulation occurring before the typical cognitive processes considered necessary for the formation of a more complex emotion. Robert B. Zajonc asserts that this reaction to stimuli is primary for human beings and is the dominant reaction for lower organisms. Zajonc suggests affective reactions can occur without extensive perceptual and cognitive encoding, and can be made sooner and with greater confidence than cognitive judgments.Zajonc, R. B. (1980). Feelings and Thinking: Preferences need no Inferences. American Psychologist, 35(2), pp. 151‚Äì175 LazarusLazarus, R. S. (1982). Thoughts on the Relations between Emotions and Cognition. American Physiologist, 37(10), pp. 1019‚Äì1024 on the other hand considers affect to be post-cognitive. That is, affect is elicited only after a certain amount of cognitive processing of information has been accomplished. In this view, an affective reaction, such as liking, disliking, evaluation, or the experience of pleasure or displeasure, is based on a prior cognitive process in which a variety of content discriminations are made and features are identified, examined for their value, and weighted for their contributions.Brewin, C. R. (1989). Cognitive Change Processes in Psychotherapy. Psychological Review, 96(45), pp. 379‚Äì394 A divergence from a narrow reinforcement model for emotion allows for other perspectives on how affect influences emotional development. Thus, temperament, cognitive development, socialization patterns, and the idiosyncrasies of one's family or subculture are mutually interactive in non- linear ways. As an example, the temperament of a highly reactive, low self- soothing infant may \\"disproportionately\\" affect the process of emotion regulation in the early months of life.Griffiths, P. E. (1997). What Emotions Really Are: The Problem of Psychological Categories. The University of Chicago Press: Chicago Non-conscious affect and perception In relation to perception, a type of non-conscious affect may be separate from the cognitive processing of environmental stimuli. A monohierarchy of perception, affect and cognition considers the roles of arousal, attentional tendencies, affective primacy,Zajonc, R. B. (1980).

Press within the sensing and processing of preferences and discrimination. Emotions are complex chains of events triggered by certain stimuli. There is no way to completely describe an emotion by knowing only some of its components. Verbal reports of feelings are often inaccurate because people may not know exactly what they feel, or they may feel several different emotions at the same time. There are also situations that arise in which individuals attempt to hide their feelings, and there are some who believe that public and private events seldom coincide exactly, and that words for feelings are generally more ambiguous than are words for objects or events. Affective responses, on the other hand, are more basic and may be less problematic in terms of assessment. Brewin has proposed two experiential processes that frame non-cognitive relations between various affective experiences: those that are prewired dispositions (i.e., non- conscious processes), able to \\"select from the total stimulus array those stimuli that are casually relevant, using such criteria as perceptual salience, spatiotemporal cues, and predictive value in relation to data stored in memory\\",Brewin, C. R. (1989). Cognitive Change Processes in Psychotherapy. Psychological Review, 96(45), pp. 379‚Äì394 and those that are automatic (i.e., subconscious processes), characterized as \\"rapid, relatively inflexible and difficult to modify... (requiring) minimal attention to occur and... (capable of being) activated without intention or awareness\\" (1989 p. 381). Arousal Arousal is a basic physiological response to the presentation of stimuli. When this occurs, a non-conscious affective process takes the form of two control mechanisms; one mobilization, and the other immobilization. Within the human brain, the amygdala regulates an instinctual reaction initiating this arousal process, either freezing the individual or accelerating mobilization. The arousal response is illustrated in studies focused on reward systems that control food-seeking behavior.Balliene, B. W. (2005). Dietary Influences on Obesity: Environment, Behavior and Biology. Physiology & Behavior, 86 (5), pp. 717‚Äì730 Researchers focused on learning processes and modulatory processes that are present while encoding and retrieving goal values. When an organism seeks food, the anticipation of reward based on environmental events becomes another influence on food seeking that is separate from the reward of food itself. Therefore, earning the reward and anticipating the reward are separate processes and both create an excitatory influence of reward-related cues. Both processes are dissociated at the level of the amygdala and are functionally integrated within larger neural systems. Affect and mood Mood, like emotion, is an affective state. However, an emotion tends to have a clear focus (i.e., a self-evident cause), while mood tends to be more unfocused and diffused. Mood, according to Batson, Shaw, and Oleson (1992), involves tone and intensity and a structured set of beliefs about general expectations of a future experience of pleasure or pain, or of positive or negative affect in the future. Unlike instant reactions that produce affect or emotion, and that change with expectations of future pleasure or pain, moods, being diffused and unfocused, and thus harder to cope with, can last for days, weeks, months, or even years.Schucman, H., Thetford, C. (1975). A Course in Miracle. New York: Viking Penguin Moods are hypothetical constructs depicting an individual's emotional state. Researchers typically infer the existence of moods from a variety of behavioral referents.Blechman, E. A. (1990). Moods, Affect, and Emotions. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates: Hillsdale, NJ Positive affect and negative affect represent independent domains of emotion in the general population, and positive affect is strongly linked to social interaction. Positive and negative daily events show independent relationships to subjective well-being, and positive affect is strongly linked to social activity. Recent research suggests that \\"high functional support is related to higher levels of positive affect\\".Blechman, E. A. (1990). Emotions and the Family. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates: Hillsdale, NJ The exact process through which social support is linked to positive affect remains unclear. The process could derive from predictable, regularized social interaction, from leisure activities where the focus is on relaxation and positive mood, or from the enjoyment of shared activities. Gender Research has indicated many differences in affective displays due to gender. Gender, as opposed to sex, is one's self-perception of being masculine or feminine (i.e., a male can perceive himself to be more feminine or a female can perceive herself to be more masculine). It can also be argued, however, that hormones (typically determined by sex) greatly affect affective displays and mood. Affect and child development According to studies done in the late '80s and early '90s, infants within their first year of life are not only able to begin recognizing affect displays but can begin mimicking the displays and also begin developing empathy. A study in 2011 followed up on these earlier studies by testing fifteen 6-12 month old infants' arousal, via pupil dilation, when looking at both positive and negative displays. Results showed that when presented with negative affect, an infant's pupil will dilate and stay dilated for a longer period of time when compared to neutral affect. When presented with positive affect however, the pupil dilation is much larger, but stays dilated for shorter amount of time. While this study does not prove an infant's ability to empathize with others, it does show that infants do recognize and acknowledge both positive and negative displays of emotion.Geangu, Elena, et al. Infant Pupil Diameter Changes in Response to Others' Positive and Negative Emotions. PLoS ONE, vol. 6, no. 11, 2011, doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0027132 In the early 2000s over the period of about seven years, a study was done on about 200 children whose mother had \\"a history of juvenile-onset unipolar depressive disorder\\" or simply, depression as children themselves. In the cases of unipolar depression, a person generally displays more negative affect and less positive affect than a person without depression. Or, they are more likely to show when they are sad or upset, than when they are excited or happy. This study that was published in 2010 discovered that the children of mothers that suffer from unipolar depression, had lower levels of positive affect when compared to the control group. Even as the children grew older, while the negative affect began to stay the same, the children still showed consistently lower positive affect. This study suggests that \\"Reduced PA [positive affect] may be one source of developmental vulnerability to familial depression...\\" meaning that while having family with depression, increases the risk of children developing depression, reduced positive affect increases the risk of this development. But knowing this aspect of depression, might also be able to help prevent the onset of depression in young children well into their adulthood.Olino, Thomas M., et al. \\"Developmental trajectories of positive and negative affect in children at high and low familial risk for depressive disorder.\\" Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, vol. 52, no. 7, June 2010, pp. 792‚Äì799., doi:10.1111/j.1469-7610.2010.02331.x. Disorders and physical disabilities There are some diseases, physical disabilities and mental health disorders that can change the way a person's affect displays are conveyed. Reduced affect is when a person's emotions cannot be properly conveyed or displayed physically. There is no actual change in how intensely they truly feel emotions, there is simply a disparity between emotions felt and how intensely they are conveyed. These disorders can greatly affect a person's quality of life, depending on how intense the disability is. =Flat, blunted and restricted affect= These are symptoms in which an affected person feels an emotion, but does not or cannot display it.Raquel E Gur, Christian G Kohler, J Daniel Ragland, Steven J Siegel, Kathleen Lesko, Warren B Bilker, Ruben C Gur; Flat Affect in Schizophrenia: Relation to Emotion Processing and Neurocognitive Measures, Schizophrenia Bulletin, Volume 32, Issue 2, 1 April 2006, Pages 279‚Äì287, https://doi.org/10.1093/schbul/sbj041 Flat being the most severe in where there is very little to absolutely no show of emotions. Restricted and blunted are, respectively, less severe. Disorders involving these reduced affect displays most commonly include schizophrenia, post traumatic stress disorder, depression, autism and persons with traumatic brain injuries.Pedersen, T. (2016). Flat Affect. Psych Central. https://psychcentral.com/encyclopedia/flat-affect/ One study has shown that people with schizophrenia that experience flat affect, can also experience difficulty perceiving the emotions of a healthy individual.Raquel E Gur, Christian G Kohler, J Daniel Ragland, Steven J Siegel, Kathleen Lesko, Warren B Bilker, Ruben C Gur; Flat Affect in Schizophrenia: Relation to Emotion Processing and Neurocognitive Measures, Schizophrenia Bulletin, Volume 32, Issue 2, 1 April 2006, Pages 279‚Äì287, https://doi.org/10.1093/schbul/sbj041 =Facial paralysis and surgery= People who suffer from deformities and facial paralysis are also physically incapable of displaying emotions. This is beginning to be corrected though, through \\"Facial Reanimation Surgery\\" which is proving not only to successfully improve a patient's affect displays, but also bettering their psychological health.Dey, Jacob K., et al. \\"Facial Reanimation Surgery Restores Affect Display.\\" Otology & Neurotology, vol. 35, no. 1, Jan. 2014, pp. 182‚Äì187., doi:10.1097/mao.0b013e3182a1ea8a. There are multiple types of surgeries that can help fix facial paralysis. Some more popular types include fixing the actual nerve damage, specifically any damage to the hypoglossal nerve; facial grafts where nerves taken from a donor's leg are transplanted into the patient's face; or if the damage is more muscular versus actual nerves, muscle may be transferred into the patient's face.Hadlock, Tessa A., Mack L. Cheney, and Michael J. McKenna. \\"Facial reanimation surgery.\\" Surgery of the ear and temporal bone. Philadelphia (PA): Lippincott Williams and Wilkins (2005): 461-72. Strategic display Emotions can be displayed in order to elicit desired behaviors from others. People have been known to display positive emotions in various settings. Service workers often engage in emotional labor, a strive to maintain positive emotional expressions despite difficulties in working conditions or rude customers, in order to conform to organizational rules. Such strategic displays are not always effective, since if they are detected, lower customer satisfaction results. Perhaps the most notable attempt to feign negative emotion could be seen with Nixon's madman theory. Nixon's administration attempted to make the leaders of other countries think Nixon was mad, and that his behavior was irrational and volatile. Fearing an unpredictable American response, leaders of hostile Communist Bloc nations would avoid provoking the United States. This diplomatic strategy was not ultimately successful. The effectiveness of the strategic display depends on the ability of the expresser to remain undetected. It may be a risky strategy since if detected, the person's original intent could be discovered, undermining the future relationship with the target. According to the appraisal theory of emotions, the experience of emotions is preceded by an evaluation of an object of significance to that individual. When individuals are seen to display emotions, it serves as a signal to others of an event important to that individual. Thus, deliberately altering the emotion display toward an object could be used make the targets of the strategic emotion think and behave in ways that benefit the original expresser. For example, people attempt to hide their expressions during a poker game in order to avoid giving away information to the other players, i.e., keep a poker face.

It was directed by , with the screenplay by Gennady Tsyferov and Genrikh Sapgir. Losharik tells the story of a circus animal composed of brightly coloured juggling balls, created as a juggler wishes that he was a lion tamer. The name of the character, and thus the title of the film, is a portmanteau of the Russian words for horse, \\"loshad\\" and small ball, \\"sharik\\" . Though friendly, Losharik is dismissed by the other circus animals for not being real. Dejected, Losharik gives away the balls that make up his form to children. When the children attend the circus, they demand the return of Losharik, giving back the balls which reform Losharik. The film was a favourite of both adults and children, though Ufimtsev claimed to be disappointed that he could not \\"fully realize his plan\\". For the production, art director Tamara Poletika and animator Yuri Norstein visited circus rehearsals for inspiration. The finished film, released by Soyuzmultfilm in 1971, has since been analysed for its themes, particularly in the context of Soviet culture. Two children's books have appeared using the character of Losharik, and the name became a nickname for a submarine of the Russian Navy which, like the animated character, used connected spheres in its construction. Plot A juggler in a circus dreams of one day becoming a lion tamer. As he juggles, the wooden juggling balls come together to form a live three-legged horse-like creature, which introduces itself as \\"Losharik\\", a portmanteau of the Russian words for horse, \\"loshad\\" () and small ball, \\"sharik\\" (). The good-natured animal plays with the juggler. Seeing this, the ringmaster offers the juggler a chance to appear as a lion tamer, with the circus's lion and tiger. When the lion and tiger see Losharik, they dismiss him as not being a real animal. The disheartened Losharik leaves the circus and disassembles itself, giving the balls that make up its form to children. The juggler, now the circus's lion tamer, appears in the ring and performs the routine with the lion and tiger. The children in the audience start to call for Losharik. Confused, the circus staff point out that Losharik is not a real animal, but the children cry that Losharik is kind, and therefore the most real of all. The lion and tiger leave, and the children throw the balls they had received into the ring, reassembling Losharik. Losharik and the juggler reunite, to the delight of the audience. Production Yuri Norstein was the animator for the film The film, with a run time of 10 minutes and 18 seconds, was made by Soyuzmultfilm and directed by , an actor who had studied under Aleksey Dmitrievich Popov, and who had made his career in animation. Losharik was an early collaboration with illustrator Tamara Poletika, with whom he worked on a number of films between 1971 and 1976. The choice of subject involving toys and games was a common theme of Soviet children's animation, and its mainstay between the 1950s and 1980s. Earlier examples involving toys imbued with their own life included 1950 film ', and Leonid Amalrik and 1953 film '. The co-author of the screenplay, Genrikh Sapgir, had also translated the poems of Soviet Jewish poet , one of which was animated in 1968 as ' by director Nikolay Serebryakov, depicting an elderly woman who finds a magic ball of wool in a snowstorm, and knits a world that takes on its own life. The screenplay was by Gennady Tsyferov and Genrikh Sapgir, with as the art director, and Yuri Norstein as the animator. The score was composed by , while Rina Zelyonaya provided the voice of Losharik. For accuracy in the depiction of circus life, Poletika and Norstein visited a circus and observed its rehearsals. Poletika would later recall that she asked in the studio if anyone wanted to attend them with her, and only Norstein agreed to. Details such as the acrobat's routine, and the stage curtains in the circus, would be used in the animated film. According to Poletika, the suggestion for Losharik having three legs rather than four came from the prominent art director Lev Milchin, and that the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow had asked for two of the film's preliminary sketches. Despite being popular with both children and adults, and described as \\"a poignant story about a dream, striving for perfection, and betrayal\\" Ufimtsev \\"claimed that he could not fully realize his plan, and the result upset him.\\" Themes Cultural historian David MacFadyen observes that the film addresses a number of themes prominent in Soviet society. The formation of Losharik from the individual wooden juggling balls represents the coming together of small parts into a 'social' whole. This harmonious creation is disrupted by the criticism of the lion and tiger in the film, resulting in Losharik's dissolution. The creature is restored when the children, acknowledging its kindness and sacrifice, express their demands for its return. Losharik is formed, disassembled, and reformed \\"by literal surrender to the world's social emotions.\\" The film emphasises \\"affective variety and multiplicity\\", making use of crosscuts to \\"show fragmented events or a diversity of characters\\". The juggler's dreams of being a lion tamer are depicted with two dimensional cutouts, differentiating it from the 'real world', depicted with three dimensional puppets. Camera angles are used to demonstrate different points of view, such as a low angle as when the juggler is shown \\"finally understanding his animal's increasingly humble sense of reality.\\" The lion and tiger in the film are expressions of a \\"dogmatic body moulding the world\\", contrasting with Losharik, an \\"ideologically open, shifting body\\". Legacy Genrikh Sapgir, co-author of the screenplay, wrote a poem, also called \\"Losharik\\", published in 1974. It tells a similar story of a circus animal made up of coloured juggling balls. The character also appeared in Gennady Tsyferov's children's book Losharik and Other Fairy Tales (), published in 2014. The creation of the name Losharik as a portmanteau appeared in a similar form with the 2003 animated series Smeshariki (), released in English as Kikoriki. This combined the Russian word smeshnye, meaning \\"funny\\", with shariki, as with Losharik, meaning small balls. This referred to the design of the characters, which depicted animals as rounded balls. Losharik became the nickname of the Project 210 submarine built by Sevmash between 1988 and 2003, the name referring to the unique design of its pressure hull, consisting of seven interconnected spheres.

In federated information repositories, data storage resources are virtualized as composite storage sets and operate as a federated environment. Federated information repositories were developed to mitigate problems arising from data proliferation and eliminate the need for separately deployed data storage solutions because of the concurrent deployment of diverse storage technologies running diverse operating systems. They feature centralized management for all deployed data storage resources. They are self-contained, support heterogeneous storage resources, support resource management to add, maintain, recycle, and terminate media, track of off-line media, and operate autonomously. =Automated data management= Since one of the main reasons for the implementation of an federated information repository is to reduce the maintenance workload placed on IT staff by traditional data storage systems, federated information repositories are automated. Automation is accomplished via policies that can process data based on time, events, data age, and data content. Policies manage the following: *File system space management *Irrelevant data elimination (mp3, games, etc.) *Secondary storage resource management Data is processed according to media type, storage pool, and storage technology. Because federated information repositories are intended to reduce IT staff workload, they are designed to be easy to deploy and offer configuration flexibility, virtually limitless extensibility, redundancy, and reliable failover. =Data recovery= Federated information repositories feature robust, client based data search and recovery capabilities that, based on permissions, enable end users to search the information repository, view information repository contents, including data on off-line media, and recover individual files or multiple files to either their original network computer or another network computer.

Clubs  Jack Donohue PS has a variety of clubs ranging from the school council. to digital media club and many more. The Student Council is the student body head of the school, planning many of the fundraisers, dances and activities at the school. It is made of representatives from each age group, and the executive council which is made up of 2 police officers from the school. The intermediate students are the ones that take the lead, for example the chairs, vice chairs, secretary, treasury and publicist. Mrs. Purchase supervises the Student Council. Another club is the Student Ambassadors, made up of students in grades 6, 7 and 8 who apply at the beginning of the year, to demonstrate that they are able to lead activities and be good role models throughout our school. Mrs. Manchen is the teacher who supervises the Ambassadors. They host many activities for primary students, such as Let's Play, Let's Read and tutoring.

Where intermediate students meet at 8:00 am in the mornings before school to practice for performances, such as holiday concerts and Novemberence day concerts. JDPS, also has started both student and teacher book clubs. Mrs. Cardill and Mrs. Tranton supervise the student book club. And hopefully we will have another book club coming up soon! Solar Power Cars is a club run by Mrs. Purchase that meets after school, so that it the students can learn about solar power cars and create their own, at the end all their hard work pays off and they compete their cars in a race. A club that is used by some of the intermediate students is the EMME club. EMME stands for Early Morning Math and English, which means that students are able to come in the mornings and work on homework and projects. This is always useful when you need extra help or time for the completion of your schoolwork. Although is often used as an excuse to come inside the school early on cold and rainy days.  Music  Mr. Stephen Eisenhauer is the music teacher for the school. He leads and conducts the junior, senior, concert and jazz bands, the guitar club, the senior choir, and strings club. The strings club is a new ensemble at the school this year and consists of a full string quartet! Mrs. Meghan Schuler also plays in the club as a violist. Over 250 students are involved in the music program at JDPS, and several teachers and parents. School trustee Cathy Curry plays in the concert band. Stephen Eisenhauer is a composer, guitarist, pianist, and singer, currently living and working in Ottawa, he has previously lived and worked in Montr√©al. His early music training included lessons in piano, ‚Äòcello, voice and organ. At McGill University, he completed a B.Mus. in vocal music and an M.A. in music theory. His choral experience began as a choirboy at Christ Church Cathedral in Ottawa, and he continues to be active in several choirs, as a soloist and chorister.

Jack Donohue puts on a musical every year. This musical is being run by Mr. Stephen Eisenhauer and Mrs. Dana Mercer. The name they use is the Jack-in-the-Box Players. Mr. Eisenhauer is also the composer of the school song. Musical Ensembles Mr. Eisenhauer coordinates many of the musical programs at Jack Donohue. He runs the musicals along with Mrs. Mercer, (which, again, will be opening in April) but other than that he coordinates all of the beautiful music performed by the intermediate students. Here are some of the musical ensembles, coordinated by him: The first ensemble is Concert Band, which is a mixture of grade 7 and 8 students. But this ensemble doesn't start until later in the year because Mr. Eisenhauer has to wait until the students are at the appropriate level to play the music. That is why during Term 1, the bands split up into a grade 7 band and a grade 8 band, they perform at the multiple concerts during the year, with music that is very graceful and that cheers up the crowd. The second ensemble is Concert Choir, this is made up of grades 6, 7 and 8 students, who love to sing. Mr. Eisenhauer finds the appropriate music, and the choir spends one recess every week practicing their songs. During the year, they too perform their songs during the concerts. The strings club is made up of a group of violin students. Mr. Eisenhauer often plays the 'cello in this group, and his wife (Mrs. Schuler) often plays the viola. The guitar club is for any grades 6, 7 or 8 students who own a guitar. They learn many fun songs and then rock out at the concert! Mr. Eisenhauer likes to sing because he is a rock star! There is also a Primary Choir, this is made of over 100 grade 1, 2, and 3 students. They sing many very cheerful songs that talk about various topics. This group was coordinated by Mrs. Skinner. (Who is unfortunately no longer at Jack Donohue)  Sports  The school has boys and girls teams in soccer, Canadian football, volleyball, bordenball, track and field, and basketball. The school has won many titles, which includes the sports Borden ball, volleyball, track and soccer.

Since her introduction, IGN heavily praised the character, citing her gameplay and stating approval for the contrast of her design against other female characters in the series. Other sources stated similar, with some such as Edge and Game Informer describing her as the best new character introduced in the game or its predecessor, Soulcalibur III. Conception and design Hilde's look derived from the development team's desire to make a fully clothed \\"sexy\\" female character for Soulcalibur IV, and encasing her in armor as a result. Her characteristics and personality were developed after deciding what weapons she would use, a spear and short sword. While fully armored, they endeavored to keep her appearing feminine, shaping the appearance of the armor thus and giving \\"peeks\\" of her figure beneath it. When it was pointed out to lead animator Yusuke Shibata that her short sword and related attacks appeared to display her femininity, he agreed, though added that her spear was another matter entirely. After developing her appearance and character model, her backstory was developed by a team led by Yoshihiro Nakagawa, and during this process they worked out how to tie Hilde into the plot of the series. In interviews, Soulcalibur IV director Katsutoshi Sasaki has called Hilde \\"the 'most alluring'\\" female character in the title, designed as an opposite to characters such as Ivy and characters that \\"always have their boobs popping out\\". He added that he felt that as gaming became more accepted, characters similar to Hilde would become more common. Hilde appears as a slender woman with long, red hair. Her primary appearance encases her fully in form-fitting body armor, with red and black fabric underneath. A wolf's head, the character's family symbol, extends from the right pauldron and covers her helmet's visor, while the left pauldron is covered by red fabric, fastened to the center of her breastplate's collar underneath a large brooch. Beneath the armor, a red coat covers her torso, the tail of which extends past her waist. Her alternate character design consists of a long, blue dress, extending to her feet and neck, exposing her shoulders and angled towards her right leg. White gloves, shoes, and stockings cover her arms and legs, while a darker colored sash surrounds her waist and midsection, too angled to the right. In video games Hilde is the daughter of the king of Wolfkrone, a fictional European kingdom under assault by series antagonist Nightmare's forces. After her father was driven insane into a Malfested by the Evil Seed event brought upon by the cursed sword Soul Edge (which took place seven years before the events of Soulcalibur IV), Hilde was forced to take the throne of Wolfkrone despite her young age. She took the responsibilities to protect her people and lead her armies in the front lines against Nightmare. As a desperate measure, Hilde seeks the Sword of Resurrection, Soul Calibur, to bring back an ancient king who once restored peace to the world.Namco Bandai Games America. Namco Bandai. Retrieved on 2008-08-01 Eventually, both Nightmare and Soul Edge are destroyed for good by Soul Calibur, wielded by Hilde's friend, Siegfried, thus ending the long-term war. However, the Wolfkrone is still at turmoil, and Hilde must search for a new land for her people to settle. Throughout seventeen years, Hilde goes from nation to nation to search for territory, where she also became a mother of two children. Eventually, the Wolfkrone manages to find a land and live at peace, but Hilde is alarmed by Siegfried that an army of malfested have challenged wars upon the kingdom. Thus, Hilde allies herself with Siegfried's group of mercenaries, Schwarzwind, to defend her kingdom, regardless of the possibility that she might lose her life in the process. She returns in Soulcalibur VI as the first DLC fighter of the 2nd season pass. In the new timeline, the mysterious Aval Organization where the new character Gr√∏h belongs to had been a sworn allied force to Hilde's home kingdom for generations. In Soulcalibur: Broken Destinys Gauntlet storyline, a non-canon side story set after the events of Soulcalibur IV, the plot revolves around Hilde and her ally Cassandra, who search for ingredients to develop a potion to cure Hilde's father. To this end they force the protagonist to assist them, and later recruit another person, Dampierre, after Hilde is briefly kidnapped. Gameplay Sasaki described her fighting style as revolving around her dual weapons, comparing her to previous series character Cervantes but with the combination of her spear and short sword weapons allowing for both long distance and close-quarters combat. Control of her weapons is mapped to different inputs from the player's controller, allowing the attacks to be combined and create different horizontal and vertical strikes. However, as a result at long range Hilde's attacks become limited to entirely linear strikes. Several of her attacks can also be \\"charged\\" by holding controller inputs, a feature unique in the series to the character. Doing so results in a stronger blow, but also creates a window of vulnerability due to the delay, negatable by performing the controller input during other attacks. Hilde's strongest attack, Mystic Star and Moonlight Dance, can be triggered through this method and will be both unguardable and do a high amount of damage if they hit the opponent, though at the cost of a twenty-five second delay while charging the attack. Promotion and reception Hilde is visible on both Soulcalibur IV arcade joysticks for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. To explain the new features of Soulcalibur IV, Namco released an omake manga featuring Hilde and Cassandra. Written in a humorous tone, Cassandra, representing a veteran of the series, \\"taught\\" Hilde about the game's features, while introducing the audience to aspects of Hilde's character. Hilde was featured in a promotional comic bundled with the North American release of Soulcalibur IVs Premium Edition. Drawn by Udon Entertainment for DC Comics, it served as a prelude to the events of the game. IGN stated her armored appearance makes her more alluring, as well as commented on her gameplay. They additionally listed Hilde as one of the series' top ten fighters at number ten. They cited her as a fierce opponent and \\"hell of a lot of fun to control\\", adding \\"...we tend to sit up and take notice when a new character shows promise...we expect she'll stick around for the long haul.\\" In a similar list, Complex enlisted the 20 best characters from the series, ranking her the 17th best character. Comparison was also made to the other female characters in the game such as Ivy, calling it a \\"stark contrast\\". Additional praise was given in their review of Soulcalibur IV, stating an approval of her design combined with her personality, and a preference for her over the game's unlockable characters. Other publications have also praised the character. Game Informer called her the best of any of the new characters introduced in either Soul Calibur III or IV. Edge described her as the best of the new characters in Soulcalibur IV, calling her fighting style a worthy rival to another series character, Kilik. iafrica.com described her as the \\"standout newcomer\\" of the title, describing her fighting style as unusual and \\"unwieldy to watch\\", but easy to get into. Ars Technica also called her a standout addition to the game, describing her fighting style as good for skilled players. Good Game described her as an interesting character, and further named her \\"the hottest [...] girl in the game\\". Shacknews stated that her combination of close and long range attacks made for \\"a refreshingly dynamic fighting style\\". Topless Robot named her one of the \\"11 Most Dignified Videogame Heroines\\", suggesting that her presence in the game was added to offset the other female characters and praising the lack of \\"ridiculous romantic contrivances\\" in her character background. Neoseeker praised her design an \\"unbelievably awesome outfit\\", adding that despite the lack of exposed skin, \\"she will win you over\\". GameDaily featured her as one of their \\"Babes of the Week\\", stating approval for her contrast to the other females,Babe of the Week: SoulCalibur IV's Hilde. GameDaily.

The achieved effect is that of death metal's trademark combination of growled vocals and highly distorted detuned guitar riffing with elements reminiscent of 1970s hard rock and heavy metal. Notable examples include Entombed, Gorefest, Carcass, Six Feet Under, Pungent Stench and the Fernando Colunga Ultimate Experience.  History  While the \\"death 'n' roll\\" tag was first associated with Entombed, Daniel Ekeroth associates the style with a previous group called Furbowl.Ekeroth, 2008, p. 264. After Entombed's breakthrough release, Wolverine Blues, the band became associated with what the music press dubbed as \\"death 'n' roll\\", a label which has followed Entombed's career ever since. Another noteworthy death 'n' roll release is Soul Survivor, Gorefest's 1996 effort. This album showed more than a passing nod to classic rock. Proof of that influence was the club tour organized by the band that same year, where Gorefest played songs by AC/DC, Black Sabbath and Deep Purple. Gorefest broke up after their last 1990s album, Chapter 13, which continued the trend started in Soul Survivor (Gorefest reformed seven years later). Two of its members currently play in Live & Dangerous, a Thin Lizzy tribute band from the Netherlands. Confronted with the \\"death 'n' roll\\" label in interviews, the death metal acts it usually is attached to react with skepticism. Entombed's LG Petrov made the following statement, regarding this issue: \\"We see it as Entombed music, if people see that as death 'n' roll so be it. We just laugh, death 'n' roll, why not? When we write songs, we aren't thinking it has to be a particular style.\\" When questioned about their mixture of death metal and rock and roll, Gorefest's Frank Harthoorn replied: \\"Strange, everyone has always mentioned this death n' roll thing. To me it's just metal, plain and simple. I don't believe our influences are different from other bands.\\"  Further reading  * Ekeroth, Daniel (2008). Swedish Death Metal.

He returned on December 5, 2014. He is the son of Claudia Zacchara (originally believed to be his sister) and Gino Soleito. Until its reveal in 2012, he was believed to be the son of mobster, Anthony Zacchara, who turned out to be his biological grandfather. Conception =Casting and reception= Brandon Barash first appeared in the contract role of Johnny Zacchara on September 18, 2007. Barash revealed that he auditioned for the role with costar Julie Marie Berman (Lulu Spencer). Brandon Barash ranked at #9 on Daytime Confidential's list of the \\"Top 10 Newcomers of 2007.\\" The post applauded Barash for being one of the most talented newcomers and sharing chemistry with all of his costars. In July 2008, Barash ranked at #25 on TV Guide's list of \\"Soap's Sexiest Men.\\" In the spring of 2012 rumors began circulating that Barash had been let go from the series. The speculation was so strong that some of Barash's own cast mates began to express concern and support when fans started a petition to save the actor's job on Twitter. The show's newly installed executive producer, Frank Valentini later took to Twitter himself to dispel the rumors of Barash's firing. After almost a year of denying rumors, Barash revealed at a fan event in late January 2013 that he had filmed his last scenes. Barash finally confirmed his departure via Twitter on March 5, 2013. On November 10, 2014, representatives at ABC confirmed Barash's return to the series in an unknown capacity, though, believed to be a story-dictated arc return. He returned to the show on December 5, 2014, and he later finished his stint on February 10, 2015. In October 2015, it was announced that Barash will return once again to the series, airing on December 8, 2015. Barash vacated the role of Johnny once again on January 26, 2016. =Characterization= Upon his introduction in 2007, the character of Johnny is described as the volatile loose canon son of mob boss, Anthony Zacchara (Bruce Weitz). The handsome, troubled, Johnny, described as a \\"bad boy with a good heart\\" is torn between staying loyal to his family and trying to maintain a sense of normalcy so that he can have a love life. During an interview with BuddyTV, Barash admitted that playing Johnny often felt like playing two roles. \\"There are so many layers to Johnny. You see one thing on the exterior, but there's so much going on underneath all that.\\" An interview with Soap Town USA listed the similarities between Barash and his character as \\"handsome, driven, well-layered and well-spoken.\\" Barash also described Johnny as \\"brooding\\" and that Johnny always carries the weight of the world on his shoulders. As of 2008, Barash observed Johnny as being \\"volatile\\" and almost \\"childish\\" in a lot of ways. Johnny is both sure and unsure of what he wants in life. Storylines Johnny Zacchara arrives in Port Charles and meets Lulu Spencer and the two begin a flirtatious relationship. His guardian is his father's lawyer, Trevor Lansing, who covered up the fact that Johnny's father Anthony murdered his mother Maria because Anthony was jealous of the bond between mother and son. Although Lulu's friends disapprove, they continued to see each other, and Johnny proved his love for her when he protected her against his father at the Black and White Ball. After Anthony is paralyzed, Johnny takes the throne of the Zacchara empire, until Trevor calls upon Johnny's sister Claudia to town, and the siblings join forces and fight Sonny Corinthos's organization, which leads to Lulu being caught in dangerous situations. Lulu breaks up with Logan and hooks up with Johnny, despite Claudia's disapproval. As friction develops between the two organizations, Johnny and Claudia arrange for Sonny to be shot but Sonny's son, Michael, is shot in the crossfire, leading the siblings to cover up the botched hit. Johnny and Claudia lose hold of the empire when their father returns from his incarceration in an asylum. Soon after, Lulu kills Logan in self-defense and Johnny and Maxie cover it up as Johnny tells Claudia it was him who killed Logan. When put on trial, Johnny is threatened with the death penalty, and Claudia perjured herself on the stand, resulting in Johnny's acquittal. Although Lulu is put in a mental health facility, the couple continue to bond but Johnny continually \\"treats her like a fragile piece of glass\\", a perspective that led to ending their relationship. Although Claudia marries Sonny as a business deal that Johnny disapproves, he soon learns that she is pregnant with Sonny's son and that as long as she is, Sonny can't hurt her if he learns of her involvement in Michael's shooting. As retaliation for Claudia marrying Sonny, he dates Sonny's friend and ex, Olivia Falconeri, despite Claudia and Sonny's disapproval. After leaving the mob once, he returns to the Corinthos organization as a favor for Claudia. The chemistry he shared with Olivia proved to be genuine and he fell passionately in love with her, despite objections from Sonny and Claudia. When Michael Corinthos kills Claudia to save his newborn sister, Johnny believes Sonny is the person who killed her. He also discovers Olivia's son Dante Falconeri is an undercover cop posing as Dominic Perelli, a member of Sonny's criminal organization. Johnny also learns that Sonny is Dante's father, and when Sonny shoots Dante, Johnny helps comfort Olivia while he recovers. When Sonny is put on trial for the murder of Johnny's sister Claudia (Sonny's wife), Johnny takes the stand in order to push Sonny's buttons and show his abusive side. He testifies to Sonny's continual verbal abuse towards Claudia, particularly on the night of her death, and says that Claudia was constantly in fear of him. After Sonny's son Michael Corinthos confesses, Sonny is released and Johnny begins his rampage against Sonny's organization; stealing his allies, his shipments and his money in order to provoke him and torture him or what he did to Claudia. Sonny's daughter Kristina Davis starts to harbor great resentment toward her father, blaming him for Michael being sent to prison. She recruits Johnny to pretend that they are going out and are sexually intimate as a way to torment her father. Johnny soon realizes that Kristina is going too far, and convinces her to end the charade, telling her that she doesn't hate Sonny as much as she says, and that she is making the same mistakes Claudia did. As Johnny is about to take Kristina home, the two are caught in a car bomb planted by Max and Milo on Sonny's orders; fortunately, both survive with minimal injuries, and Johnny vows to stay away from Kristina. On August 27, 2010, Sonny shoots Johnny in self-defense, but Detective Ronnie Dimestico hides Johnny's gun to make it appear as though Sonny had tried to kill him. However, Jason and Dante find proof that Johnny was attacking Sonny. On September 14, 2010, Sonny and Johnny finally proctor a peace agreement. On December 3, 2010, Johnny shoots someone working for Jerry Jacks, before being shot by Jason. He has Ethan get Lisa Niles to save him. Johnny blackmails Lisa with the syringe she used to try to kill Robin so that she will help him with his gunshot wounds. On January 26, 2011 Johnny is beat up by Shawn Butler, one of The Balkan's mercenaries. He is found by Lulu and she takes him to his apartment. On February 21, Johnny and Lisa had sex in his apartment for the first time. Eventually, fed up with Robin and Lisa's constant squabbling over the syringe, Johnny calls them both to his apartment and arranges a scavenger hunt for it. When Lisa's search nearly causes her to lose her job at General Hospital and delays her greatly, she turns to Johnny for help. Johnny, however, reveals that it wasn't really about the syringe, but to try to get her to finally get over her obsession with Patrick and move on with her life. When Patrick finds out about this, he insists to Johnny that Lisa is too far gone to be helped and just as deranged as Claudia. On April 22, 2011 Johnny finds his father Anthony Zacchara out of prison and living in his apartment. In May 2011 Johnny helps Michael and his girlfriend Abby Haver find the hitwoman his father ordered to kill Abby's ex-boyfriend Brandon. On June 9, 2011 Johnny agrees to help Lisa (who is on the run for the attempted murder of Robin Drake) get out of the country to start her life over. Johnny later learns that Lisa has taken people hostage at the hospital and learns his father Anthony Zacchara help her to do so. Johnny has also begun pushing Ethan Lovett to admit that he has feelings for Kristina. He still taunts Sonny whenever he catches them together which has caused Sonny to pull a gun on him and almost kill him until Olivia intervenes. In November 2011 Johnny begins to flirt with PCPD detective Delores who is investigating the murder of Lisa Niles. Johnny and Anthony argue over Claudia on the anniversary of her murder. On January 23, 2012 Sonny reveals to Johnny that he is really the biological son of Gino Soleito and that Claudia, whom he'd spent his whole life believing was his sister, was actually his biological mother. At the charity event in February 2012 at the Metro Court, Sonny announces to everyone that Claudia was Johnny's mother. Sonny is arrested for shooting out Anthony Zacchara's tires, causing the car accident that killed Cole Thornhart and Hope Manning. Johnny agrees to help Detective Delores Padilla find her sister's killer in exchange for information on the case, and also blackmails Steve Webber with what he did in Memphis. In March 2012 Johnny begins a sexual relationship with Carly Corinthos Jacks and in April 2012 the couple goes public with their relationship. However, Johnny sleeps with Connie (Kate's alternate personality) while Sonny walks in and later Carly. Carly, betrayed by Johnny, seduces Sonny, but Sonny backs off. Sonny tells Carly he thinks there is more to the story with Kate. Carly later dumps Johnny. Later on, Johnny buys a recording contract for Starr after Starr reveals her original producer was a crook and used the money from the record deal for adult films. Johnny shoots and kills Anthony after revealing that Johnny was the one who caused the accident that killed Hope and Cole and had Kate's alter Connie take the fall. After a long time of giving Carly roses and flowers, Johnny gives her a nice, expensive bracelet that Carly had shown him, and with a lot of thought, Carly finally forgives him. In his head, he can hear his dead father, Anthony, talk to him and is going a bit crazy after he buys half of The Haunted Star for a night club, a partnership with his ex- girlfriend, Lulu. Carly says once there's a special bond between two people, it never really goes away, but she knows he really wants this night, and she really trusts him, but Lulu's police officer husband is not happy with it. Johnny is now being haunted by Anthony Zacchara and Hope Manning-Thornhart for their deaths (he shot Anthony point blank and got rid of his corpse, and killed Hope -along with her father- when he shot out Anthony's tires). Kate's alter Connie blackmails Johnny into marrying her and announces it at Sonny and Kate's wedding in October 2012. Johnny confessed to the murder in January 2013 and revealed that Todd switched Sam Morgan's baby with Tea Delgado's. Johnny is sentenced to 20 years in Pentonville Penitentiary but before being transferred he gives Starr Manning his share of the Haunted Star.

Sikh History is around 500 years and in that time the Sikhs have developed unique expressions of art and culture which are influenced by their faith and synthesize traditions from many other cultures depending on the locality of the adherents of the religion. Sikhism is the only religion that originated in the Punjab region with all other religions coming from outside Punjab (with the possible exception of Punjabi Hinduism since the oldest Hindu scripture ‚Äì the Rig Veda ‚Äì was composed in the Punjab region. Some other religions, like Jainism, may also claim to have originated in Punjab since Jain symbolism has been found among artifacts of the Indus Valley Civilization). All the Sikh gurus, many saints and many of the martyrs in Sikh history were from Punjab and from the Punjabi people (as well as other parts of the Indian Subcontinent). Punjabi culture and Sikhism are mistakenly considered inseparably intertwined. \\"Sikh\\" properly refers to adherents of Sikhism as a religion, strictly not an ethnic group. However, because Sikhism has seldom sought converts, most Sikhs share strong ethno- religious ties as therefore it's a common stereotype that all Sikhs share the same ethnicity. Many countries, such as the U.K., therefore misconcievingly recognize Sikh as a designated ethnicity on their censuses. The American non- profit organization United Sikhs has fought to have Sikh included on the U.S. census as well, arguing that Sikhs \\"self-identify as an 'ethnic minority'\\" and believe \\"that they are more than just a religion\\". Cultural societies of the Sikhs There is a common misconception that all Sikhs belong to the Punjab region. The religion's birthplace of Punjab itself has been called \\"India‚Äôs melting pot\\",the Crafts of the Punjab and many other parts of Northern India due to the heavy influence of invading cultures, such as Mughal and Persian, that mirrors the confluence of rivers from which the region gets its name(from Persian,\\"panj\\" ŸæŸÜÿ¨ meaning \\"five\\" and \\"-ƒÅb\\" ÿ¢ÿ® meaning water thus meaning land of the five waters). Thus, Sikh culture is to a large extent as a result by groups of various cultures uniting together, thus forming a unique one. Sikhism has forged a unique form of architecture which Bhatti describes as being \\"inspired by Guru Nanak‚Äôs creative mysticism\\" such that Sikh architecture \\"is a mute harbinger of holistic humanism based on pragmatic spirituality\\".The magnificence of Sikh architecture The keynote of Sikh architecture is the Gurdwara which is the personification of the \\"melting pot\\" of Indian cultures, showing both Mughal, Aryan and Persian influences. The reign of the Sikh Empire was the single biggest catylst in creating a uniquely Sikh form of expression, with Maharajah Ranjit Singh patronising the building of forts, palaces, bungas (residential places), colleges, etc. that can be said to be of the Sikh Style. The \\"jewel in the crown\\" of the Sikh Style is the Harmandir Sahib. Sikh culture and identity is heavily influenced by militaristic motifs, with Khanda being the most obvious; thus it is no surprise that the majority of Sikh artifacts, independent of the relics of the Gurus, have a military theme. This motif is again evident in the Sikh festivals of Hola Mohalla and Vasakhi which feature marching and practicing displays of valor respectively. The art, culture, identity and societies of the Sikhs has been merged with different locality and ethnicity of different Sikhs into categories such as 'Agrahari Sikhs', 'Dakhni Sikhs' and 'Assamese Sikhs'; however there has emerged a niche cultural phenomenon that can be described as 'Political Sikh'. The art of prominent diaspora Sikhs such as Amarjeet Kaur NandhraTextile artist Amarjeet Kaur Nandhra and Amrit and Rabindra Kaur Singh ('The Singh Twins'),Singh Twins Art Launches Liverpool Fest is partly informed by their Sikh spirituality and influence. Culture of Sikh communities Although the Indo-Aryan Sikhs form the majority of the Sikh population, the Sikh community is varied and includes people who speak the Pashto language, the Brahui language, the Telugu language and many more. The many communities following Sikhism is detailed below. All of these communities belong to one single world of khalsa which count all as one. =Afghani Sikhs= The Sikhs of Afghanistan have a unique culture which has elements of the culture of Afghanistan. =American Sikhs= Harbhajan Sing Puri is credited with raising awareness of Sikhism amongst the non Asian community of the United States of America.

The community traces its origins to the times of Maharaja Ranjit Singh who took his army to Assam and put some influence of the religion towards the locals.

Agrahari Sikhs, also known as Bihari Sikhs, have existed for centuries in Bihar and Jharkhand. Bihari Sikhs share their culture with the local Bihari community. The men generally wear the local dhoti and women wear the Sari. They also celebrate cultural festivals such as the Chath festival.Calcutta Mosaic: Essays and Interviews on the Minority Communities of Calcutta : edited by Nilanjana Gupta, Himadri Banerjee, Sipra Mukherjee =Dakhni Sikhs= Dakhni Sikhs are from the Deccan Plateau in India located within the states of Telegana and Andhra Pradesh.Zee New 18 10 2011 The traditional dress of women is the sari.

Their traditional dress includes the Punjabi Salwar Suit, Punjabi Tamba and Kurta, Punjabi juti and Patiala salwar. In addition to the Sikh festivals using the Nanakshahi calendar, Punjabi Sikhs observe traditional Punjabi festivals using the Punjabi calendar. =Sindhi Sikhs= In addition to celebrating Sikh festivals, Sindhi Sikhs celebrate cultural festivals such as Cheti Chand, the Sindhi new year. Sindhi Sikhs speak the Sindhi language. =South Indian Sikhs= There are Sikh communities in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra who converted to Sikhism centuries ago. The Sikhs comprise Banjara and Satnami. The process of blending the religion into southern India for the Sikligars began at the time of 10th Sikh Guru Gobind Singh, who came to the Deccan and died in 1708 at Nanded (Maharashtra). It all came by the Sikligars as they cane to southern India as expert arms-making camp followers of the tenth Guru. Sikligar is a compound of the Persian words \`saiqal\` and \`gar\` meaning a polisher of metal. The traditional occupation of the Sikligars is crafting kitchen implements. Banjaras are a nomadic tribe who traditionally travelled with merchandise and are found across a large swathe of northern India, as well as in the south. Sikh Banjaras too travelled with armies of the past supplying them with provisions.  Gallery  File:Dasam.Granth.Frontispiece.BL.Manuscript.1825-1850.jpgA frontispiece to the Dasam Granth.

The period spans the same time as the \\"Development inwards\\" (Desarrollo hacia adentro) period in Chilean economic history. Carlos Ib√°√±ez and Arturo Alessandri Palma Headed by Colonel Marmaduque Grove, left-wing troops deposed the September Junta in the 1925 coup, and handed power to General Pedro Dartnell as interim president, with the hope of recalling Arturo Alessandri Palma from exile. Dartnell, however, decided to form another junta, the January Junta, which ended with Alessandri's return on March 20, 1925. Alessandri had a new Constitution drafted, and approved in a referendum by 134,421 voters on August 30. The Constitution, which was promulgated on September 18, 1925, reinforced presidential powers over the legislature. Furthermore, Alessandri created a Central Bank, initiating the first rupture with classical liberalism's laissez faire policies.Intervenciones militares y poder factico en la politica chilena (de 1830 al 2000) , Luis Vitale, 2000 (p. 38) Alessandri's second government began with the support of left-wing and radical groups. However, this second group began to distance itself from the President. In March 1925, Alessandri's government repressed a demonstration, leading to the Marusia massacre (500 deaths), soon followed by La Coru√±a massacre. Henceforth, Alessandri encountered opposition from his own Minister of Defence, Colonel Carlos Ib√°√±ez del Campo who had also participated to the January 1925 coup and also enjoyed support from the masses. Alessandri wanted to run only one official candidate in the presidential election ‚Äî himself ‚Äî while Ib√°√±ez gave his support to a manifesto drafted from various political parties which called on him to run as a candidate. This crisis led to the cabinet's resignation. Ib√°√±ez then published an open letter to the President, recalling him that he could only issue decree through his approbation, as he was the only minister of the cabinet. Alessandri then decided to nominate Luis Barros Borgo√±o as Minister of Interior, and resigned a second time from the presidency on October 2, 1925. This break with the working classes caused Alessandri to try to maintain a right-wing-radical alliance until 1937, when it took a turn towards the left. =Emiliano Figueroa Larra√≠n (1925‚Äì1927)= Alessandri's resignation prompted Ib√°√±ez to convince the parties to find a common candidacy, as required by Alessandri. Emiliano Figueroa Larra√≠n, the candidate of the Liberal Democratic Party, was thus chosen as the governmental candidate, and was elected in October 1925 with nearly 72% of the votes, defeating Jos√© Santos Salas from the Social Republican Worker's Union. Alessandri had been confronted by increased opposition from his popular Minister of Defence, Ib√°√±ez. Both had struggled over the purging of the justice apparatus, Ib√°√±ez opposing in particular the President of the Supreme Court, Javier √Ångel Figueroa Larra√≠n, who was Emiliano's brother. In February 1927, Ib√°√±ez succeeded in being designated as Minister of Interior (who, in case of a vacancy in the presidency, would be designated Vice President of Chile - in the Chilean context effectively the designated acting President), and in convincing President Figueroa to resign in April 1927. Ib√°√±ez thus took his place as Vice President and called for elections. He ran against communist El√≠as Lafertte, and won in May 1927 with 98% of the vote. =Carlos Ib√°√±ez (1927‚Äì1931)= Carlos Ib√°√±ez's administration remained popular until the outbreak of the Great Depression in 1931. He exercised dictatorial powers, and did not dislike being compared to Benito Mussolini. He suspended parliamentary elections, instead naming politicians to the Senate and Chamber of Deputies himself. Freedom of press was restricted, 200 politicians were arrested or exiled (among whom Alessandri and his former ally Marmaduque Grove), the Communist Party was proscribed, and the workers' movement strongly repressed. Before these actions, Congress and the parties remained silent, and delegated broad executive powers to Ib√°√±ez through the decretos con fuerza de ley (decrees with force of law, DFL)--basically, the executive could pass legislation without a vote of Congress. Ib√°√±ez found in his Minister of Finances, Pablo Ram√≠rez, the support he needed. In 1929, General Ib√°√±ez requested to the parties a list of the candidates to the general elections, in order to select himself who would be allowed to present himself. He then went to the Termas de Chill√°n resort, and there selected members of both houses. Thereafter, the following legislature became known as the Congreso Termal. His popularity, however, was helped by massive loans from American banks, which helped to promote a high rate of growth in the country. He launched important public works, ordering the construction of canals, bridges, prisons, ports, the facade of the presidential palace La Moneda, and the secondary presidential residence at Castillo Hill in Vi√±a del Mar, and increased public spending. He also reformed the police, by merging the Fiscal Police, the Rural Police, and the Cuerpo de Carabineros in 1927 into the Carabiniers of Chile, and appointed himself as their first Director General. Ib√°√±ez also created the Chilean Air Force, LAN Airlines and the COSACH (Compa√±√≠a de Salitres de Chile, saltpeter company). On an international level, Ib√°√±ez signed the Treaty of Lima with Peru in June 1929, in which Chile agreed to return Tacna Province --which had been seized during the War of the Pacific-- to Peru in exchange for financial compensation. His popularity lasted until after the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the effects of which began to be felt in Chile at the end of 1930, leading to an abrupt fall in the prices of saltpeter and copper, upon which the Chilean economy was strongly dependent. At that point all loans were halted and recalled. Without an influx of foreign currency, Chile was heavily affected by the Great Depression. Furthermore, the United States and European countries began to implement high tariffs in a return to protectionism. In a few weeks, unemployment in the northern mines affected tens of thousands of people. In 1931, the flow of international credit was stopped, pushing the state to quasi-bankruptcy. Although Ib√°√±ez's government increased export taxes to 71% and established restrictions on exit of devises, he did not manage to restore equilibrium to the balance of trade, leading to a depletion of the gold reserves. On July 13, 1931, he named a \\"Cabinet of National Salvation\\" (Gabinete de Salvaci√≥n Nacional) including Pedro Blanquier and Juan Esteban Montero. The combination would be lethal, as when Blanquier, on one hand, revealed the catastrophic state of the finances, Montero was relaxing press censorship, leading to an immediate popular reaction to the revelations. Ib√°√±ez's lavish public spending did nothing to alleviate the situation, and his opponents, primarily the exiled Grove and Alessandri, began to plan a comeback. Several conspiracies attempted to remove him from power, one by Alessandri, Marmaduque Grove and two other people (which led to their exile to Easter Island), and another in September 1930 in Concepci√≥n. A great wave of public unrest followed, during which students of the University of Chile and of the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile initiated demonstrations, soon joined by physicians and lawyers. The police forces killed more than ten people, leading to Ib√°√±ez's resignation on July 26, 1931, and his subsequent exile on the following day. Before leaving, Ib√°√±ez delegated his office to the president of the senate, Pedro Opazo, who in turn resigned in favor of Interior Minister Juan Esteban Montero, a member of the Radical Party, who was proclaimed the new president by Congress. = The Socialist Republic (1931‚Äì1932) = March in support of the proclamation of the Socialist Republic of Chile, in front of La Moneda Palace (June 12, 1932) Meanwhile, Alessandri had returned to Chile, and the presidential campaign began, with Alessandri running against Juan Montero. The October 1931 Presidential election was this time won by the Radical candidate Montero, elected with 64% of the votes, defeating Alessandri, the candidate of the Liberals (35%). A short time after his investiture in December 1931, President Montero was confronted by the Escuadra uprising, during which revolutionaries took some military ships and sank them in the Bay of Coquimbo. Although the mutiny was peacefully resolved after the rebels' surrender, the fragility of the new government was exposed to the public. On June 4, 1932, planes from El Bosque Air Base fled over the presidential palace, La Moneda, leading to the resignation of Montero's cabinet. The putsch's leaders, Marmaduque Grove, Carlos D√°vila and Eugenio Matte, proclaimed the Socialist Republic of Chile. The military junta dissolved Congress, ordered to the Caja de Cr√©dito Popular banking institution to return pawned objects to their owners and decreed three days of closure of the banks. The new junta was however deeply divided, and on June 16, 1932, less than two weeks after the coup, Carlos D√°vila deposed Grove and Matte and deported them to the Easter Islands. D√°vila proclaimed himself \\"provisional President\\" on July 8, 1932. However, the real kingmaker, the Armed Forces, were not favourably disposed to D√°vila's Socialist tendencies, and on September 13, 1932 forced him to hand over power to his Minister of Interior, General Guillermo Blanche Espejo, who was a supporter of the ex-President Carlos Ib√°√±ez. General Espejo, who was not keen on organizing elections, was then forced, under the threat of a mutiny from the garrisons of Antofagasta and Concepci√≥n, to hand over power to the President of the Supreme Court, Abraham Oyanedel, who called for elections. Tired of political instability, the Chilean people voted for the only person who would ensure public order, the center-right candidate Arturo Alessandri, who obtained 54% of the votes in the October 30, 1932 presidential election, defeating his still-exiled opponent Marmaduque Grove, who obtained 18%. =Arturo Alessandri (1932‚Äì1938)= In order to see off the threats of a coup, Alessandri relied on the republican forces, trusted to repress any revolts and to not get involved in politics. They were created shortly before Alessandri's return, as a consequence of the civil movement. They functioned in secret and then publicly, marching in a great parade May 7, 1933 in front of the President, who saluted them. They disbanded in 1936, having considered their mission complete. The President asked the Parliament on several occasions to vote for a state of constitutional exception, resulting in actions such as the famous burning of the 285th issue of the satirical magazine Topaze, which published a caricature of Alessandri he considered offensive. Such precautions were not without reason, especially considering the appearance of new violent movements, such as the Nazi-inspired National Socialist Movement of Chile of Jorge Gonz√°lez von Mar√©es. In 1934, the rural rebellion of Ranquil was crushed, 477 workers and Mapuches being killed during the Ranquil Massacre in the upper Bio-Bio River, which had recently been opened for Chilean and foreign settlers of the occupation of the Araucania.Levantamiento campesino en Ranquil, Lonquimay In the economic sphere, the recovery from the crisis of 1929 was begun with the work of Treasury Minister Gustavo Ross, a pragmatic liberal who implemented a \\"development inwards\\" approach to growth. With respect to nitrates, he dissolved COSACH and created COVENSA (Corporation of Nitrate and Iodine Sale), a multi-faceted distributor rather than a producer. He balanced the fiscal deficit with new taxes and resumed payment of the external debt, with losses for holders of Chilean bonds. When the government achieved a surplus, they focused on public works, most notably the construction of the National Stadium in Santiago, inaugurated in December 1938.  The Radical Governments (1938‚Äì1952)  The Radical Party's ideology was rooted in the principles of the 1789 French Revolution, upholding the values of liberty, equality, solidarity, participation and well-being. It had been created in the middle of the 19th century as a response to the conservative liberals then in power, and mainly represented the middle classes. It finally succeeded in gaining power as part of the Popular Front left-wing coalition, although its cabinets were fragile due to constant parliamentary instability. =Pedro Aguirre Cerda (1938‚Äì1941)= The first Radical President, Pedro Aguirre Cerda, was a teacher and lawyer from the University of Chile, a perfect example of the socio-economic classes supporting the Radical Party. He was elected in 1938 as the candidate of the Popular Front, under the slogan \\"Gobernar es educar\\" (\\"to educate is to rule\\"). He narrowly defeated the conservative candidate Gustavo Ross, mostly because of the political backlash caused by the Seguro Obrero Massacre which followed an attempted coup d'√©tat by the National Socialist Movement of Chile (MNS), intended to take down the rightwing government of Arturo Alessandri and place Ib√°√±ez in power. The fascist MNS had merged into the Alianza Popular Libertadora coalition supporting Carlos Ib√°√±ez, but after the attempted coup, Ib√°√±ez opposed Ross, lending indirect support to Cerda. Pedro Aguirre Cerda promoted the development of technical-industrial schools as a means to promote the training of technicians for the nascent industrialization of the country. He also created thousands of new regular schools and the expanded the university system to cover the whole of the country. A strong earthquake shook Chile on January 24, 1939, killing more than 30,000 people and destroying much of the infrastructure. Cerda's cabinet thereafter created the Corporaci√≥n de Fomento de la Producci√≥n (CORFO) to encourage an ambitious program of import substitution industrialization through subsidies and direct investments as well as launching important public works. At the same time, the Empresa Nacional del Petr√≥leo (ENAP) oil state company was created, as well as ENDESA electricity company, the Compa√±√≠a de Acero del Pac√≠fico (CAP) steel holding and the Industria Azucarera Nacional (IANSA) sugar company. This was the basis for the industrialization of Chile. The German‚ÄìSoviet Non Aggression Pact of 1939 during the Second World War led to the dismantling of the left-wing coalition, as the Comintern then abandoned the Popular Front strategy and anti-fascism in favour of advocating peace with Germany. However, following the invasion of the Soviet Union by Nazi Germany, the Chilean Communist Party joined again the government. During Cerda's first year he had to face the military opposition to his plans, which boiled over with the Ariostazo in August 1939, led by General Ariosto Herera and Ib√°√±ez. The leaders of the attempted putsch, in particular General Herera, were strongly influenced by Italian fascism: Herera had served in Italy as a military attach√© in the 1930s. Cerda also campaigned for a Nobel prize for Gabriela Mistral, a campaign which achieved its objective under his successor, Juan Antonio R√≠os. On September 3, 1939, 2,200 Spanish Republican refugees landed in Valpara√≠so on board of an old cargo ship, the Winnipeg, whose journey had been organized by the Special consul for Spanish emigration in Paris, the poet Pablo Neruda. In 1941 due to his rapidly escalating illness, Cerda appointed his minister of the Interior, Jer√≥nimo M√©ndez as vice-president, and died soon after, on November 25, 1941. =Juan Antonio R√≠os (1942‚Äì1946)= The left-wing coalition remained intact after President Cerda's death, united by a common opponent, General Carlos Ib√°√±ez del Campo. The Democratic Alliance (Alianza Democr√°tica) chose as its candidate a member of the conservative wing of the Radical Party, Juan Antonio R√≠os, who defeated Ib√°√±ez in the February 1942 election, obtaining 56% of the votes. R√≠os' presidency was marked by parliamentary instability, caused by rivalries between different political tendencies in his cabinet, and the renewed influence of Congress. The Chilean Communist Party opposed R√≠os who had initially chosen neutrality and refused to break off diplomatic relations with the Axis Powers, while the right-wing accused him of complacency regarding the Left. At the same time, the Chilean Socialist Party accused him of being too laissez-faire regarding big business and criticized him for not passing labour legislation to protect workers. In 1944, the Radical Party presented a series of proposals to Rios, which he deemed unacceptable. Those included the break-off of relations with Francoist Spain - diplomatic and especially economic pressure had caused him to finally break off relations with the Axis Powers in January 1943 - the recognition of the USSR and a cabinet exclusively composed of Radicals. By breaking off relations with the Axis, President R√≠os made Chile eligible for the United States' Lend- Lease program, and obtained loans necessary to help Chile's economic recovery. The close relations that developed with the United States were, however, problematic for him at home. Furthermore, his refusal to implement the Radical Party's propositions caused the resignation of all of the Radical ministers, leaving the President without a party. These internal divisions partly explained the right-wing success during the 1945 legislative elections, which were a debacle for the Socialists and the Communists, who obtained close to no seats in Parliament. The Radicals themselves lost a number of seats. Furthermore, the repression of riots on Plaza Bulnes in Santiago, leading to several deaths, gave further ammunition to critics of the President, and led to the resignation of members of the cabinet. Finally, shortly after the war, in October 1945, his entire cabinet resigned in protest of a state visit he made to Washington, DC. Economically, he faced labor unrest at home, brought about, in large part, by the drop in copper prices worldwide. Faced with terminal cancer, he gave up his presidential powers in January 1946 in favour of his Minister of the Interior, Alfredo Duhalde V√°squez, who acted as Vice- President until his death on June 27, 1946. =Gabriel Gonz√°lez Videla (1946‚Äì1952)= Senator Pablo Neruda For the second time in five years, a presidential election was held on September 4, 1946, opposing the Radical candidate Gabriel Gonz√°lez Videla to the physician Eduardo Cruz-Coke as representative of the Conservative Party, Bernardo Ib√°√±ez for the Socialist Party and Fernando Alessandri Rodr√≠guez for the Liberal Party. The Radicals, who had chosen a member of its left-wing as their candidate, did not succeed in reviving the Democratic Alliance left-wing coalition, as the Socialist Party decided to go it alone for the elections. However, the Radicals did ally themselves with the Communists, with the poet and Communist senator Pablo Neruda leading Gonz√°lez's electoral campaign. Commemorative stamp on the Declaration on the Ant√°rtica Chilena Province. Gonz√°lez was elected with 40% of the votes against 29% for the conservative candidate, Cruz Coke, and 27% for the liberal candidate Alessandri Rodr√≠guez. Since Gonz√°lez did not reach the necessary 50%, he had to be confirmed by Congress. He was duly confirmed on October 24 that year, following various negotiations between the parties, which led to the creation of a composite cabinet, including liberals, radicals and communists. Once in the presidency, Gonz√°lez had a fallout with the communists. Following the municipal elections, during which the Communist Party greatly increased its representation, the PCC demanded more cabinet seats, which Gonz√°lez refused to grant. On the other hand, afraid of the success of the PCC, the Liberal Party withdrew from the cabinet. In June 1947, incidents during a strike affecting public transport in Santiago led to several casualties and the proclamation of a state of siege in the capital. In August and October 1947, various strikes occurred in the coal mines in the South, jeopardizing the government. Finally, President Gonz√°lez's travel to the region succeeded in restoring tranquility. A few days afterwards, the miners of Chuquicamata initiated another strike, prompting Gonz√°lez to make increasing use of emergency laws. Finally, under the pressure of the United States, Gonz√°lez enacted a Law of Permanent Defense of the Democracy (Ley de Defensa Permanente de la Democracia, aka known as Cursed Law, Ley Maldita) which outlawed the Communist Party and banned more than 20,000 persons from the electoral registers. The detention center in Pisagua, used during Iba√±ez's dictatorship (and which would also be used during Pinochet's dictatorship), was re-opened to imprison Communists, Anarchists and revolutionaries, although no detainee was executed this time. Prominent Communists, such as senator Pablo Neruda, fled into exile. He also broke off diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact states. A pro-communist miners' strike in Lota was brutally suppressed. Demonstrations against what the communists called la ley maldita (\\"the damned law\\") led to the declaration of martial law, but were successfully repressed. Gonz√°lez's new supporters, who approved of his anti- communist stance, were the two right-wing parties, the conservatives and the liberals. He assembled a new cabinet made up of conservatives, liberals, radicals, some socialists, and members of the small Democratic Party. Gonz√°lez's tough stance against social movements led to protests, allegedly in an intent to repeat the events of the Bogotazo in Colombia. However, these were quickly repressed, while Gonz√°lez's government also had to confront, from the right, an attempted military coup which aimed at bringing back Carlos Ib√°√±ez to power, the Pig Trotters conspiracy (complot de las patitas de chancho), thus named because the coup leaders met in a restaurant which specialized in this Chilean dish. He immediately ordered an investigation and the arrest of the coup leaders, including the head of the operation, General Ram√≥n Vergara. Ib√°√±ez, however, was absolved of all responsibility. In the parliamentary elections of 1949, the pro-government parties triumphed. However, the unity between right-wing parties and radicals and socialists did not last long. Radicals were unhappy with the economic policies of the right- wing Finance Minister, Jorge Alessandri, no matter how successful they were in controlling inflation. When a protest by government employees broke out in 1950, the radicals immediately declared their support for the protesters' demands. The right-wingers responded by resigning from Gonz√°lez's cabinet. By losing the liberal and conservative support, Gonz√°lez lost the pro-government majority in Congress. He was of course unable to achieve much thereafter, but he did manage to make significant improvements in women's rights. Gonz√°lez's he appointed the first female cabinet minister and the first female ambassador, and created the Oficina de la Mujer. Despite this political, social and economical instability, Gonz√°lez's government did achieve some important successes, including the complete integration of women in political life, the remodeling of the city of La Serena, the development of an Antarctic policy with the creation of the Ant√°rtica Chilena Province ‚Äì Gonz√°lez was the first chief of state of any nation to visit Antarctica, and the Gonzalez Videla Antarctic Base was named after him - and the determination along with Peru and Ecuador of the of the Exclusive Economic Zone.  Start of mass politics (1952‚Äì1964)  Chile undertook an important economic transition after World War II. Due to the protectionist policies of the Radical Governments and of their predecessors, a quite diverse, although not that strong, national industry had developed in the country, leading to a deep renewal of the economical and social structure of Chile. For the first time, agriculture ceased to be the primary productive sector, and was replaced by the secondary sector (in particular by mining) and a primitive service sector. On the other hand, the 1952 presidential election displayed the Chilean political field as divided between three sectors, including the emerging centrist Christian Democrat Party which had the support of a large spectrum of personalities. Furthermore, for the first time, women were granted the right to vote and stand for election. =Carlos Ib√°√±ez (1952‚Äì1958)= Four main candidates ran in the 1952 presidential election. On the right, the Conservative and Liberal parties endorsed the centrist Arturo Matte; the Socialist Party ran Salvador Allende, his first campaign for the presidency, while the Radicals supported Pedro Enrique Alfonso. Finally, General Carlos Ib√°√±ez again ran for the presidency as an independent. He promised to \\"sweep\\" out political corruption and bad government with his \\"broom\\" and was nicknamed the \\"General of Hope\\". Apart from his criticisms of the traditional political parties, he remained vague in his proposals and had no clear position on the political spectrum. He was elected on September 4, 1952 with 47% of the vote, and after Congress' ratification of his election, was invested on December 4, 1952. Ib√°√±ez's first issue was the 1953 legislative elections, which he hoped would bring him a parliamentary majority. He was mostly supported by the right-wing Partido Agrario Laborista (PAL) and, in a lesser measure, by dissidents of the Socialist Party, who had formed the Popular Socialist Party, and some feminist political unions -- the feminist Mar√≠a De la Cruz was his campaign manager, but she then refused a ministerial office. He formed an initial cabinet which included contradictory figures, but despite this initial fragility, managed to win some successes in the 1953 elections. Despite the latter, he was still at the mercy of an unified opposition. Ib√°√±ez's second term was a very modest success. By that time he was already old and ailing, and he left government mostly to his cabinet. Elected on a program promising to put an end to chronic inflation in the Chilean economy, Ib√°√±ez decided to freeze wages and prices, leading to stagnation of economic growth and in turn a relative increase in civil unrest. Inflation, however, continued, skyrocketing to 71% in 1954 and 83% in 1955 . Helped by the Klein-Sacks mission, Ib√°√±ez managed to reduce it to 33% when he left the presidency. During his term, public transport costs rose by 50% and economic growth fell to 2.5%. Now much more of a centrist politically, Ib√°√±ez won the support of many left-wingers by repealing the Ley de Defensa de la Democracia (Law for the Defense of Democracy), which had banned the Communist Party. However, in 1954, a strike in the copper mines extended itself to all of the country. Ib√°√±ez tried to respond by proclaiming the state of siege, but the Congress not only opposed this executive measure: it put immediately an end to it. Some Chileans continued to support an Ib√°√±ez dictatorship. These iba√±istas, most of whom were young army officers inspired by the Argentine caudillo Juan Domingo Per√≥n, created the L√≠nea Recta (Straight Line) group and the PUMA (Por Un Ma√±ana Auspicioso) to establish a new dictatorship. Ib√°√±ez met with these conspirators, but ultimately his typical lack of trust ended the plans for a self-coup. A scandal rocked the Ib√°√±ez administration and the Armed Forces when the press revealed Ib√°√±ez's meetings with these conspirators. At the end of his presidency, Ib√°√±ez also clashed with the Federaci√≥n de Estudiantes de la Universidad de Chile (FECh) students' union because of his decision to increase the public transport fares. 20 people were killed and many more injured during demonstrations in April 1957. =Jorge Alessandri (1958‚Äì1964)= This succession of problems led the Partido Agrario Laborista (PAL) to withdraw from Ib√°√±ez's government, leaving him isolated. On the other hand, the Radicals, Socialists and Communists organized the Frente de Acci√≥n Popular (Front for Popular Action), presenting a common candidate to the presidency, Salvador Allende. Obtaining 29% of the votes in the 1958 presidential election, he was narrowly defeated by the former Minister of Finances and son of the former President Arturo Alessandri Palma, Jorge Alessandri Rodr√≠guez, who obtained 32% of the vote. Alessandri's election was narrowly ratified at the Congress by a right-of- center coalition. For the second consecutive time, the President of Chile was not a \\"traditional politician\\" figure. Alessandri's narrow victory made the 1960 municipal elections decisive. Although the liberal-conservative coalition did not win these elections, it succeeded in having a decent score enough to face the left-wing opposition. Alessandri continued to receive their support after the 1961 legislative elections, while the Radical Party entered the governmental coalition, leading the President to have control of both Chambers of Parliament, something which had not occurred in recent times. Despite these electoral successes, Alessandri's tenure had to face two successive earthquakes, one on May 21, 1960, day of the inauguration of the parliamentary session, and another the following day, known abroad as the Great Chilean earthquake, causing local tsunamis and leading to 2,000 to 5,000 dead. Cities such as Puerto Saavedra, Valdivia, Osorno, Puerto Montt and Ancud were the most affected. Valdivia had to be completely evacuated following landslides threatening to block the outflow of Ri√±ihue Lake, leading to the Ri√±ihuazo damming project. Thousands of volunteers helped survivors in rebuilding local infrastructures, while the United States, Cuba, Brazil, France, Italy and other countries sent international aid. Chile's situation forced the state to accept the US conditions for the receiving of aid via John F. Kennedy's assistance plan for Latin America, the Alliance for Progress, including the first steps of the Chilean land reform. The disaster led to renewed inflation, and consequently to important strikes during 1961, followed by copper miners, teachers, physicians, banks and ports. Despite this, the country was retained as the host for the 1962 FIFA World Cup, initially awarded to the country in 1956. In the 1963 municipal elections, the liberal-conservative coalition lost many seats, while the Christian-Democrats and the FRAP (Socialists and Communists) made major gains.  From the Christian-Democracy to the Popular Unity  For the first time in fifty years, a major new party appeared on the Chilean political scene, the Christian Democrat Party. On the right, the liberal-conservative coalition merged into the National Party, opposed to all progressive change within and outside of the political scene. =Eduardo Frei Montalva (1964‚Äì1970)= In the September 1964 presidential election, three candidates stood: Julio Dur√°n on the right, representing the Democratic Front of Chile, a center-right coalition gathering the Liberal Party, the Conservative Party and the United Conservative Party which had participated in Alessandri's cabinet; Eduardo Frei Montalva for the Christian Democrat Party, and finally Salvador Allende for the FRAP left-wing coalition, unifying the Socialist Party and the Communist Party. Fearing a victory of the Marxist candidate Allende, especially in the context of the United States embargo against Cuba decided in 1962, the CIA directly spent three million dollars to support the Christian Democrats during the electoral campaign, mostly through radio and print advertising aimed at raising the \\"Red Scare\\" again.CIA Reveals Covert Acts In Chile, CBS News, September 19, 2000. Accessed online 19 January 2007. Eduardo Frei Montalva, who had been Minister of Public Works in 1945 in Juan Antonio R√≠os's cabinet supported by the left-wing Democratic Alliance, and presidential candidate in 1958, was elected in this atmosphere, six years later, with the slogan \\"Revoluci√≥n en Libertad\\" (\\"Revolution in Liberty\\"). He won 56% of the votes, defeating Allende who received 39% of the vote, while the right-wing Liberal-Conservative candidate Julio Dur√°n obtained less than 5%. Frei was sworn in on September 18, 1964. Frei's administration began many reforms in Chilean society. \\"Promoci√≥n Popular\\" (Social Promotion), \\"Reforma Agraria\\" (agrarian reform), \\"Reforma Educacional\\" (education reform), and \\"Juntas de Vecinos\\" (neighborhood associations) were some of his main projects. He also took measures to rationalise drug supply. Furthermore, in 1966, the Rapa Nui of Easter Island gained full Chilean citizenship. Easter Island had been annexed in 1888 by Chile. However, until 1953 the island had been rented to the Williamson-Balfour Company as a sheep-farm, while the surviving Rapanui were confined to the settlement of Hanga Roa and the rest of the island managed by the Chilean Navy, until its opening to the public in 1966. =Salvador Allende (1970‚Äì1973)=  See also  * Presidents of Chile timeline  References  20th century in Chile History of Chile Former member states of the United Nations Former polities of the Cold War ","title":"Presidential Republic (1925‚Äì1973)"},{"id":"13255887","text":"James Andrew \\"Jack\\" Beall (October 25, 1866 ‚Äì February 11, 1929) was an American politician. He represented Texas in the United States House of Representatives from 1903 to 1915. Early years Beall was born on a farm near Midlothian, Texas to Richard Beall and Adelaide Pierce Beall. He attended the county schools and then taught school in 1884 and 1885. He was graduated from the law department of the University of Texas at Austin, in 1890, and was admitted to the bar the same year and commenced practice in Waxahachie, Texas. Public service Beall was a member of the Texas House of Representatives, 1892‚Äì1895. He served in the Texas Senate, 1895‚Äì1899, and was elected as a Democrat to the 58th Congress, and to the five succeeding Congresses, March 4, 1903 ‚Äì March 3, 1915. In Congress, he was chairman, Committee on Expenditures in the Department of Justice (62nd Congress). He was not a candidate for renomination in 1914. Along with members of the southern delegation to Congress, Beall was opposed to William Jennings Bryan on the latter's 1909 support of Prohibition, citing the Texas preference of handling the matter on local levels. On July 4, 1911, Congressman Beall spoke before a crowd of 1,500 at Meriden, Connecticut for that city's Independence Day celebration. The crowd found him \\"charming\\" and \\"eloquent\\" as he spoke of the nation's history, his faith in God, and of the heroes of the old South. Later years After leaving Congress, Beall moved to Dallas, Texas, in 1914, and became a law partner with M.D. Templeton and Tony B. Williams. In 1923, he became a senior law partner of Beall, Watson, Rollins, Burford and Ryburn. Beall became president of the Dallas Union Trust Company in 1927. He served as president of the Texas Electric Railway from 1921 until his death. Personal life and death In 1898, he married Patricia Martin of Waxahachie.

It is a locked room mystery and features his series detective, Sir Henry Merrivale, assisted by Scotland Yard Inspector Humphrey Masters. Plot summary Marcia Tait is a Hollywood star who has come to England to make a historical film. She is found beaten to death in the Queen's Mirror pavilion, the 17th-century trysting place of King Charles II and his mistresses.

Sir Henry Merrivale lends a hand to Inspector Masters in the investigation, but is too late to stop the second murder before Merrivale solves the case. Literary significance and criticism \\"Sir Henry Merrivale is caught up in the murder of a wilful actress; it's done inside a pavilion, snow is on the ground, and there are crowds of candidates for her favors and for the role of murderer. ... The telling is done in Carter Dickson's usual long and diffuse talk which he thinks conversation; oddities are added for pseudo suspense; people shout, whirl, say What! in italics, and generally the thing is irritation unrelieved even by a second murder.\\"Barzun, Jacques and Taylor, Wendell Hertig.

Prior to the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, KGMB was asked to broadcast music in order to provide long-range guidance to a flight of Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses on their way to Hawaii from the mainland. Ironically, the Japanese aircraft picked up the same transmissions and used them for guidance while they approached the islands. During the attack, KGMB dispatched reports to CBS Radio, which in turn were cited on-air by John Charles Daly, who anchored the network's coverage of that day's news. On Valentine's Day, February 14, 1980, the call letters were changed to KSSK, for \\"Kiss Radio\\". For many years the station was home to Hal \\"J. Akuhead Pupule\\" Lewis, better known as Aku. After his death in 1983, the station moved afternoon personality Michael W. Perry to the morning slot and paired him with morning show substitute (while Aku was ill) Larry Price, a former National Football League player and head coach of the University of Hawaii Rainbow Warriors football team. The duo were known as \\"Perry & Price\\". In 1993, New-Tex Communications bought both 590 KSSK and FM station KXPW for $7.5 million, and changed the FM station's call letters to KSSK-FM.\\"Stations in the U.S: Hawaii: Waipahu\\", Broadcasting Yearbook (1995 edition), page B-113.

The full name of the Brigade is the 17th Separate Kryvyi Rih Tank Brigade. It was formerly known as 17th Guards Tank Division. The Brigade is located in Kryvyi Rih. History The current unit's history stems from the 174th Rifle Division, which became the 20th Guards Rifle Division in 1942. The 20th Guards Rifle Division fought at the Battle of Stalingrad, Krivoi Rog, Odessa, Budapest, and Vienna. It was with the 57th Army of the 3rd Ukrainian Front in May 1945. The history of the postwar 17th Guards Tank Division traces back to the 20th Guards Rifle Division which was active in 1945. It became the 25th Guards Mechanized Division in 1945,Drogovoz 2003, p. 393 and in 1957 37th Guards Tank Division at Constanza with the 1st Guards Army. The division moved to Kryvyi Rih in 1958 and was subordinated to the 6th Guards Army. In 1960, its 69th Separate Tank Training Battalion was disbanded. On 19 February 1962 the Missile Battalion and the 129th Separate Equipment Maintenance and Recovery Battalion was activated. On 11 January 1965 the 37th became the 17th Guards Tank Division, a designation it would retain until the fall of the Soviet Union. In 1968 the 26th Separate Guards Sapper Battalion became an engineer-sapper battalion. The 44th Separate Chemical Defence Battalion was activated from the chemical defence company in 1972. The 1055th Separate Material Supply Battalion was formed from the separate motor transport battalion. In June 1989, the 1158th Anti-Aircraft Missile Regiment was transferred to East Germany, and was replaced by the 1069th Anti-Aircraft Missile Regiment of the 47th Guards Tank Division. The 25th and 92nd Tank Regiments of the mobilization 58th Tank Division replaced the division's 216th Guards and 224th Tank Regiments in June 1990. During the Cold War, the division was maintained at 60% strength. Still designated a tank division as of Decree N 350/93 (August 21, 1993), when Colonel Ivan Svidi, Commander of the 17th Tank Division, 6th Army Corps, Odessa Military District, became a major-general. In accordance with Decree 925/98, of 23 August 1998, Division commander Serhiy Andriyovych Harbuz was promoted to Major General. In September 2003 the division was downsized into a brigade. After the 6th Army Corps was disbanded in 2013, the brigade became part of Operational Command East. On 18 November 2015 its honorifics \\"Red Banner Order of Suvorov\\" were removed as part of an Armed Forces-wide removal of Soviet awards and honorifics. The Kryvyi Rih battle honour, through, remained because Kryvyi Rih is located in Ukraine. On 22 August 2016, its Guards title was removed. 15 personnel from the brigade were awarded state orders and decorations for actions of bravery under the colours in the Donbass War to date. During the Second Battle of Donetsk Airport, the word cyborg () was used to refer to the Ukrainian defenders of the airport. It was first applied to these soldiers online, and spread from there into the Ukrainian media. It refers to the way that the airport defenders were able to fend off constant attacks by DPR forces in close quarters with little sleep or support, just as science-fiction cyborgs are \\"indestructible half-men, half-machines\\", or \\"superhuman\\".

S. Anderson. It stars Jason Statham, Tyrese Gibson, Ian McShane, and Joan Allen. Though referred to as a remake of the 1975 film Death Race 2000 (which in turn is based on Ib Melchior's short story \\"The Racer\\") in reviews and marketing materials, director Paul W. S. Anderson stated in the DVD commentary that he thought of the film as something of a prequel. A remake had been in development since 2002, though production was delayed by disapproval of early screenplays, then placed in turnaround following a dispute between Paramount Pictures and the producer duo Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner (the latter was the producer without Cruise in the film). Death Race was acquired by Universal Studios, and Anderson re-joined the project to write and direct. Filming began in Montreal in August 2007, and the completed project was released on August 22, 2008. The film received mixed reviews from critics. Three direct-to-video films in the series were then released: Death Race 2 (2010), Death Race 3: Inferno (2013) and Death Race: Beyond Anarchy (2018).  Plot  In 2012, the collapse of the US economy and the subsequent increase in crime rates leads to the rise of privatized prisons. One such prison is Terminal Island Penitentiary, whose warden, Claire Hennessey, earns profits by broadcasting a vehicular combat racing series on the internet. Throughout the season, Terminal Island inmates battle each other in specially modified cars on a track cut into the grounds. Towards the end of a race, a masked driver nicknamed Frankenstein is nearing the finish line, pursued by his rival Machine Gun Joe. His navigator, Case, reports that all of his defensive equipment has malfunctioned. Against her protests, Frankenstein refuses to let Joe finish first. Case ejects herself out of the car just before Joe destroys it as it crosses the finish line. Industrial worker and ex-con Jensen Ames struggles to support his family. When the steel mill he works at is closed, he returns home to his wife Suzy and their new-born daughter, Piper. A masked assailant knocks him unconscious. Jensen wakes up with a bloodied knife in his hand, Suzy dead nearby, and policemen storming into his home and arresting him. He is sentenced to life imprisonment, while Piper is placed in foster care. Six months later, Jensen is transferred to Terminal Island Prison. Hennessey's right-hand man Ulrich calls Jensen to her office. She tells him that Frankenstein died from his injuries after the previous race, and offers to let Jensen go free if he drives Frankenstein's car to win one more race. Jensen accepts the offer and meets Frankenstein's maintenance crew consisting of Coach, Gunner, and Lists; they soon explain to Jensen that Hennessey assigned him to become Frankenstein in order to rebuild the profits and audience of \\"Death Race\\", which has halved since Frankenstein's \\"disappearance\\". On the first day of the three day race, Jensen meets Case. During the race his vehicle's defensive equipment again mysteriously malfunctions. Jensen is distracted and blindsided by Joe when he sees Pachenko perform the same hand gesture at him as the masked assailant, causing Jensen to realize it was Pachenko that killed his wife. Jensen confronts Pachenko and attacks him after the race - prompting Pachenko to admit that Hennessey ordered him to frame Jensen, so she can have a replacement for Frankenstein. On the second day, Jensen threatens to eject Case unless she tells the truth about the malfunctions. Case admits that she had sabotaged Frankenstein's car to keep him from winning and leaving Death Race, in exchange for her release papers. Shortly afterward, Jensen catches up to Pachenko's car, slamming it head-on into a concrete barrier. Jensen exits the car and breaks Pachenko's neck. By the end of the second race day, all racers except Jensen and Machine Gun Joe are killed. Hennessey orders Ulrich to plant a bomb underneath Jensen's car in case he wins, knowing that she can always find another person to impersonate Frankenstein. Jensen, who has realized that Hennessey has no intention of letting anyone win the competition, approaches Joe after the race, suggesting they talk. On the final race, Jensen and Joe collaborate, destroying and driving through a weakened wall. Hennessey activates the bomb, not knowing that it was removed and disassembled by Coach. She then orders helicopters to pursue, though Jensen jumps out of the car as Case takes his place. Case is captured while Joe and Jensen escape on a freight train. Hennessey is later seen opening a present, revealing the bomb she had planted on Jensen's car. Coach detonates the bomb, killing Hennessey and Ulrich. Six months \\"and 2000 miles later\\", Joe and Jensen, reunited with Piper, are shown working in Mexico as mechanics, and are soon reunited with Case. Cast Production In March 2005, following the success of Alien vs. Predator (2004), director Paul W. S. Anderson revealed that he was directing a remake of Death Race 2000 (1975) entitled Death Race 3000 at Paramount Pictures based on a script by J. F. Lawton. The remake would be produced by the producer pair Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner. Anderson described the remake as a riff on the first film. \\"It's not a straight remake at all. The first movie was an across-America race. This will be an around- the-world race. And it's set further in the future, so the cars are even more futuristic. So you've got cars with rockets, machine guns, force fields; cars that can split apart and re-form, a bit like Transformers. Cars that become invisible,\\" the director explained. Comingsoon.net reported that \\"Paul saw his film almost as a prequel if anything; almost the genesis of the Death Race\\", though the film is referred to primarily as a remake in reviews and marketing materials. Two years later, Roger Corman, the producer of Death Race 2000, elaborated that he had an option agreement with producer Tom Cruise, and that Cruise would portray the lead role. The director said that Cruise had not been happy with the first two screenplays and that a third one was underway. In June 2006, producer Jeremy Bolt reported that Anderson would direct the remake of Death Race 2000 after completing Resident Evil: Extinction (2007). The producer described the remake's new tone: \\"We've basically taken the idea of reality television and extended it twenty years. So it's definitely a comment on society, and particularly reality television, but it is not as much a parody or a satire as the original. It's more straight.\\" The following August, Paramount ended its relationship with Cruise/Wagner Productions, and Death Race was placed in turnaround. According to reports, when the project was discovered available, Universal Studios acquired it. Cruise and Wagner resumed their roles as producers, and Anderson returned to write and direct the film. In April 2007, actor Jason Statham entered negotiations to star in Death Race, with production slated to begin in late summer or early fall. Anderson described that Death Race would take place in a prison, and that the film would be \\"super-violent\\" like its predecessor. \\"It has little echoes of the original ‚Äì a lot of people get run down, but rather than having the points system, which had no pay off anyway, it's a pure race. It's more like Gladiator, with the last person standing ‚Äì or driving, winning,\\" explained the director. Filming on Death Race began in Montreal in August 2007. Reception =Critical response= The film drew generally mixed reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives it a 42% rating based on reviews from 159 critics, with an average rating of 4.79/10. The website's critical consensus states, \\"Mindless, violent, and lightning-paced, Death Race is little more than an empty action romp.\\" Metacritic reports a rating of 43 out of 100 based on reviews from 23 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews.\\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore during opening weekend gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on a scale ranging from A+ to F. Robert Koehler of Variety called Death Race \\"as hard as metal and just as dumb\\" and criticized it for removing the humor of Death Race 2000. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun- Times gave the film half a star (out of four), calling it \\"an assault on all the senses, including common.\\" Keith Phipps of the A. V. Club said the film is \\"ideal for those who want to watch a bunch of cars blow each other up, without having to think about it all that much.\\"Death Race review, Keith Phipps, The A. V. Club The Onion Marc Savlov of the Austin Chronicle called Death Race \\"one of the most boring drags of all time.\\"Death Race review, Marc Savlov, Austin Chronicle Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle called the film \\"an ill-advised and severely wussified remake.\\"Death Race review, Peter Hartlaub, San Francisco Chronicle Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News gave the film one and a half stars (out of four), calling it \\"junk\\", and saying that \\"the chases are pretty cool, but there's absolutely nothing else to see.\\"Death Race review, Elizabeth Weitzman, New York Daily News A positive review came from Nathan Lee of The New York Times, who said that \\"the movie is legitimately greasy, authentically nasty, with a good old-fashioned sense of laying waste to everything in sight.\\"Death Race review, Nathan Lee, The New York Times James Berardinelli of ReelViews awarded Death Race a score of two and a half stars (out of four), saying that it's \\"weak when it comes to things like plot, character, and acting, but it's very good at provoking visceral reactions.\\"Death Race review, James Berardinelli, ReelViews =Box office= The film grossed $75,677,515, of which $36,316,032 was from North America. Release  The film was originally scheduled for release on September 26, 2008, but was moved to August 22, 2008. =Home media= The DVD and Blu-ray were released in the United States on December 21, 2008. There was also an unrated edition released. The Blu-ray version of the movie features a Digital Copy of the film. In the DVD commentary, Anderson further elaborates on his thought of the movie as a prequel more than a remake. Music The score to Death Race was composed by Paul Haslinger and conducted by Tim Davies. Haslinger recorded the string portion of his score with the Hollywood Studio Symphony at the Sony Scoring Stage. The soundtrack was released on August 19, 2008. Prequels and sequel The film is followed by two direct-to-video prequel films Death Race 2 (2010) and Death Race 3: Inferno (2013); both take place before this film and were filmed in South Africa. The films were directed by Roel Rein√©, and star Luke Goss, Tanit Phoenix, Danny Trejo and Ving Rhames all appeared in the prequels. Lists and 14K are the only returning characters and are portrayed by Frederick Koehler and Robin Shou, respectively. A fourth film is a direct-to-video sequel to the first film, titled Death Race: Beyond Anarchy (2018).

Career Rom was born to a poor family in Mons, Belgium, in 1859 and entered the Belgian Army at the age of 16. He subsequently worked as a customs official before leaving Belgium for the new Congo Free State in 1886 as one of the few hundred whites working in the colony's administration. Receiving a series of rapid promotions, Rom commanded the station at Stanley Falls (now Boyoma Falls) and was eventually promoted District Commissioner of Matadi. He later transferred to the colonial military, the Force Publique, where he served as a captain. He was praised for his conduct during the Congo Arab War (1892‚Äì94) in which he personally negotiated the surrender of an Arab stronghold. After retiring from the Force Publique, he worked as an official for the Compagnie du Kasai in central Congo. Rom became most famous for the alleged brutality of his administration in the Stanley Falls area. According to contemporary reports from white missionaries, Rom had used the severed heads of 21 Congolese to decorate the flower beds of his house at Stanley Falls. He is also said to have kept a gallows permanently in place at his station. As the literary scholar Peter Edgerly Firchow argued, however, displaying severed heads was not unusual in contemporary Central African society: Still working for the Compagnie du Kasai, Rom died in Brussels in 1924. In popular culture It has been argued that Rom served as the inspiration for the character of Mr. Kurtz, an ivory trader who features prominently in Joseph Conrad's 1899 novella Heart of Darkness. Among those who have made this argument are Adam Hochschild who argued in King Leopold's Ghost that Rom and Conrad may have met in 1890. Other scholars have rejected this. Rom notably features as the main antagonist in the 2016 film The Legend of Tarzan, in which he is portrayed by the Austrian actor Christoph Waltz.

It is the centre for the production of clay dolls, often referred to as Krishnanagar clay dolls. Geography =Location= Ghurni is located at on the banks of the Jalangi River. It can be reached from Kolkata by either train () or bus (). Krishnanagar City is part of Kolkata Suburban Railway on the Sealdah ‚Äì Naihati ‚Äì Ranaghat ‚Äì Krishnanagar line. Journey time is 2¬Ω hours and one can return the same day. Cycle rickshaws, buses (town service) are available for travel within the city. Note: The map alongside presents some of the notable locations in the subdivision. All places marked in the map are linked in the larger full screen map. All the four subdivisions are presented with maps on the same scale ‚Äì the size of the maps vary as per the area of the subdivision. History The old name of Krishnanagar was Rewe. In the early 17th century Bhabananda Majumdar founded the royal family of Nadia. Later, Maharaja Rudra changed the name to Krishnagar. In 1757, Maharaja Krishnachandra (1710‚Äì1783) helped the British East India Company against Siraj ud-Daulah in the Battle of Plassey. He was a patron of the arts, including literature and music, and supported the production of clay dolls. In 1728 he brought families of potters from Dhaka and Natore and settled them in Ghurni, then a village. Clay dolls In an article, the Bangalore-based newspaper Deccan Herald writes, ‚ÄúWe have clay dolls, toys and even clay sculptures in different parts of India. But there has been nothing to match the clay doll artisans of Krishnanagar in the Nadia district of West Bengal. The creations of these artists are displayed in most of the handicraft museums of the world. In India, we have a large display of these dolls in the Shankar‚Äôs Doll Museum in New Delhi. One look at the clay dolls and we are amazed at the reality with which the artist has displayed the character of the model. A horse rearing to gallop to a placid dog licking its lips after a hearty feed.‚Äù Krishnanagar clay dolls are unique in their realism and the quality of their finish, ‚Äò...they truly represent a breakaway from the traditional form. Fruits, fish, insects, animals, birds, and of course the entire pantheon of gods and goddesses, and even the ubiquitous Donald Duck and other popular comic strip characters, faithful copies of real-life, down to the minutest detail. Realistic recreations of everyday life, work, mood and character- farmers, weavers, rag pickers, basket makers, umbrella makers - are yet other specialties of Krishnanagar dolls.‚Äô Exhibitions of Krishnagar dolls have been held in London, Paris and Boston. Ghurni clay models have won medals and certificates at international exhibitions. =Bronze casts= Some of the Ghurni artists have studied in art colleges in France and Italy, but theirs is a talent passed down through generations. Kartik Chandra Pal prepared clay models of statues of Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore. Based on his clay models bronze castings were made and have found pride of place in Washington DC and Moscow and were inaugurated by Bill Clinton and Mikhail Gorbachev, respectively. =Changing times= The clay modellers of Ghurni have fallen on bad days. The decline of feudal zemindari culture and loss of their patronage have adversely affected them. They are finding new patrons amongst NRIs, many of whom are acquiring clay models in large numbers. Tastes are also changing. Even ten years ago, the demand was for clay models of the great poets and traditional icons such as Rabindranath Tagore and Kazi Nazrul Islam. Now, they are losing out. The demand has shifted and so have the artists to the ‚Äòhottest pin-up idols of cricket‚Äô, Sourav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid. Even saints and religious leaders like Ramkrishna Paramhansa, Baba Loknath, and Sai Babas, have lost out in popularity to these cricketers. The flourishing market abroad of fibreglass models, have forced some of the clay modellers of Ghurni to change the base material of their craft, although they lack the infrastructure for making fibre glass models. Fibreglass is more durable and easy to mould. The number of master craftsmen is decreasing as members of the younger generation are switching over to more lucrative trades or more paying professions. In 2007, the number of master craftsmen staying at Ghurni dwindled to 10, most of them aged.

Ludwig Heinrich Christian Geyer (21 January 1779 ‚Äì 30 September 1821) was a German actor, playwright, and painter. Life and career Born in Eisleben, he was the stepfather of composer Richard Wagner, whose biological father had died some six months after his birth. According to Wagner's biographer Glasenapp, Geyer married Wagner's mother Johanna Rosine (n√©e P√§tz) after Wagner's birth; for his first few years Richard went under the surname Geyer. However it is possible that Geyer and Johanna did not marry legally, as no record of the marriage has been found.Gutman (1990), p.7 and note. In his 'Autobiographic Sketch' Wagner describes him as 'a comedian and a painter; he was also the author of a few stage plays, of which one, ... The Slaughter of the Innocents, had a certain success'. On his deathbed, according to Wagner, Geyer asked his mother 'has he perchance a talent for music?'.Wagner, Richard, tr. W. Ashton Ellis (1993) The Art-Work of the Future and other Works Lincoln and London Geyer grew up in Artern and attended gymnasium in Eisleben. He started studying jurisprudence at the University of Leipzig but had to quit in 1799 when his father died after an accident. Geyer turned his hobby to his profession and earned the living expenses for his family by selling small portrait paintings. In 1801 he came back to Leipzig where he met Friedrich Wagner who cared for him like a father. It was at his advice that Geyer went to the stage. He performed in little theaters in towns such as Magdeburg, Braunschweig, Stettin and Breslau. In Magdeburg he became a Freemason.Richard Wagner - sein Leben und seine Werke (www.internetloge.de) In 1809 Geyer joined the well known Secondasche Gesellschaft in Leipzig, whose members were given the rank of court actors. Friedrich Wagner died after the Battle of Leipzig of typhus and Geyer married his widow. In 1814 his theatre company became part of the royal ensemble in Dresden where he made a friendship with Carl Maria von Weber. In 1815, Geyer's daughter Augusta C√§cilie was born, who later married the publisher Eduard Avenarius and was the mother of Richard Avenarius and Ferdinand Avenarius. Later in life, in the course of preparing his autobiography, Mein Leben, Wagner received from his sister C√§cilie a cache of letters written by Geyer that led him to believe that Geyer was his biological father, and possibly (and incorrectly) to believe that Geyer was Jewish;Gutman(1990) 4-5 the correspondence was subsequently lost or, some have suggested, destroyed by Wagner.Conway, David (2002), \\"'A Vulture is Almost an Eagle' ...

The first American production was staged by the Rochester Community Players of Rochester, New York, in April 2005. The name is an ironic reference to the characters, who frequent the Irish pubs of Kilburn High Road in the Kilburn district of London, an area renowned for its large Irish population. The back-story Six young Irish working men immigrate to London in the early 1970s. Like so many of their generation, they spend their lives in manual labor jobs digging ditches or construction work. They intended to stay only a little while, make some money and return home as successful men, but that day never seemed to arrive. Now, twenty-something years later, still in London, five of them gather in the side room of a pub in an informal wake for one of them who has died. All are in their late-40s or early-50s. All but one (who had split off from the group years earlier and established a successful construction company of his own) are broken from lives of hard work and harder drinking. The entire play takes place in one afternoon and evening at that pub, as the characters drink to their fallen friend the only one to make it home, albeit in a coffin. Secrets are revealed and lies are uncovered. The play was adapted into a motion picture, Kings, directed by Tom Collins, and premiered at the Taormina Film Festival (Italy) June 2006.

His work was widely published and contributed iconic representation of the working population of the Australian bush as self- sufficient rugged and laconic. Early life Carter was born to Percy and Doris Carter in August 1928 in Melbourne. Jeff's parents were successful merchants and Jeff attended Melbourne Boys High School. By the time he matriculated in 1946, his three major passions were clear ‚Äì photography, writing and travel. He began taking photographs while still at high school. His first photos were taken with a Kodak Box Brownie, given to him as a 13th birthday present.Obituary 6 November 2010 Career In 1946, Carter set off to travel around Australia with his camera and typewriter and made a living selling his stories and photographs to a wide range of Australian and international newspapers and magazines including Paris Match, People, Pix, Walkabout and The Australian Women's Weekly. He was later also commissioned by National Geographic.\\"In the aftermath of war there was a widespread distaste for glamorised, idealised images perceived to be far removed from contemporary life. The work of Jeff Carter can be seen as typical in this respect in its emphasis on unadorned reality. In 1946, equipped with a camera and typewriter, the young Carter began his extensive travels around Australia. His project was conceived in the spirit of honest reportage‚Äìhe describes himself as a photographer of the poor and unknown‚Äìand he often spent considerable amount of time in getting to know the workers and residents he photographed in carious outback Australian communities. Carter's photographs and stories were subsequently published in numerous Australian and international magazines.\\" The curator of the 2011 retrospective of Carter's work, Sandra Byron, said his photographs were \\"deceptively simple because they were extremely well crafted, wonderful images\\", and that he was an important figure in Australian documentary photography. From 1949‚Äì54, Carter was editor of Outdoors and Fishing magazine; he then resigned to travel in rural and outback Australia as a freelance photo-journalist. He wrote and illustrated 17 books based on his experiences.WorldCat His most widely held book outside Australia is People of the Inland. [Adelaide]: Rigby, 1966. OCLC 901968. Carter's other books include: The Life and Land of Central Australia (1967); Outback in Focus (1968); Stout Hearts and Leathery Hands (1968); Surf Beaches of Australia's East Coast (1968); Four-Wheel Drive Swagman (1969); Wild Country (1974); Jeff Carter's Great Book Of The Australian Outdoors (1976); All Things Wild (1977); and Jeff Carter's Guided Tours Of The Outback (1979). At the time of his death in 2010 he was in the final stages of compiling a book of photographic works produced in collaboration with his granddaughter. Carter also produced a three-volume series of semi-autobiographical novels, Snowmaidens, which remained unpublished at the time of his death. Carter is quoted as saying that he was influenced by writers such as Upton Sinclair, John Steinbeck and Edgar Snow. Television From 1972‚Äì74, Jeff Carter directed and filmedHenri Mallard, Frank Hurley, Geoffrey Powell, Edward Cranstone and Axel Poignant were earlier Australian photographers who also worked in film. the television series Wild Country for the Seven Network. The series was edited by Roger Whittaker and Jeff's daughter Karen, and was screened internationally, including at the annual television festival MIP in Cannes, France. An episode won awards for Best Documentary, Best Director and Best Editing at the 1974 Australian Film Institute Awards, and another episode won several awards at the annual television festival MIP in Cannes, France. From 1981‚Äì85, he was head teacher of photography at the Wollongong campus of the National Art School. Collections and exhibitions His photographs are in the collections of the Art Gallery of NSW, the National Gallery of Victoria, the National Gallery of Australia, the National Library of Australia (over 450 photographs), the Art Gallery of South Australia, the National Museum of Australia, and the Powerhouse Museum.

A collection of his black and white studies was published as Jeff Carter: Retrospective Sydney: New Holland, 2005, Filmmaker Catherine Hunter joined Carter on a road trip in June 2010 to western New South Wales, revisiting bush characters he had first photographed back in the 1950s. The result was a half-hour documentary, Inland Heart: The Photography of Jeff Carter. Themes As a photographer, Carter concentrated on the unglamorous and unprivileged aspects of Australia, with a focus on the working lives and conditions of ordinary Australians.\\"Jeff Carter gave a perfect summary of the qualities that 'real' Australians possessed when he described two timber-workers he photographed as: ‚Äòhardworking, upstanding, proud and honest craftsmen‚Ä¶nation builders‚Ä¶worthy of respect. Carter himself has been praised as ‚Äòone able to capture the essence of what it is to be Australian‚Äô, a view equally applicable to Dupain.\\" During his early travels, his experiences as an itinerant bush worker, fruit picker, side show \\"urger\\" for a travelling boxing troupe, drover, road worker, and mill hand, brought him in contact with the people who would be the subjects of his photographs. These early years of his career filled him with admiration for those making their livings in some of the toughest environments in Australia. Throughout his career, Carter has produced series that show the progression of events over time. Concentrating on rituals and process, they comprise evocative images. Personal life In 1947 at the age of 19, Jeff Carter married Frances Oscar, a motorcycle rider in a circus sideshow and had two children, daughter, Karen Siobhan Carter, and son Thor. In 1952 he began a de facto relationship with Mary Thompson-Read-Young (known as 'Mare').

Palazzo Vai, where the campus is located Interior of palazzo Vai The Monash University Prato Centre is a teaching and research centre in Tuscany. It is located in an 18th-century palace, the Palazzo Vaj, in the historical centre of Prato. It was opened on 17 September 2001, as part of Monash University's internationalisation policy. It was established with the assistance of the local government of Prato, the region of Tuscany and prominent Italian- Australians Rino and Diana Grollo.http://www.monash.edu.au/pubs/monmag/issue23-2009/inbrief/old- school.html The Centre aims to develop Australia's links with Europe, through research collaboration, seminars and conferences, and as a centre of study for Australian students.History and aims It is now the largest Australian institution of its kind in Europe. The Centre's patron is Sir James Gobbo, AC, an Australian jurist who was the first Governor of Victoria of Italian descent.  Location  Prato is a city and comune in Tuscany. It is 24 km from Florence, accessible by road or a 20-minute train ride. It is a centre of Italy's textile industry and of the slow food movement. It is home to around 180,000 people, making it the second largest city in Tuscany and the third largest in Central Italy, after Florence and Rome. In addition to Monash, other educational institutions in Prato include Il Polo Universitario \\"Citt√† di Prato\\" (a branch of the University of Florence).Prato Situated at Via Pugliesi 26, the Monash Prato Centre occupies the Palazzo Vaj, an 18th-century palace in the town's historical centre. Certain parts of the building are believed to be even older, as 15th century frescoes have been discovered on one of the Palazzo's outer walls. The name Vaj (pronounced vai in Italian) comes from the family which originally owned the building in the 18th century. From 1875 to 1999, the palazzo was a prestigious club for local businessmen, largely used for gaming. The modern interior was largely created in the 1950s by the famous Italian architect Italo Gamberini and is heritage-listed by the Italian Government.  Activities  The Prato Centre hosts students from Monash who complete part of their degree at the Centre. The main academic areas offered by the Centre are law, art and design, music, history, international relations and Italian. This entails hundreds of Monash students being hosted by the Centre throughout the year. Classes are conducted by academics from Monash University, as well scholars from the University of Florence, Osgoode Hall Law School, King's College London and various experts working within the law, social sciences and the arts.Units and Dates 2008 The Centre is popular among Monash students, because it enables them to study overseas without having to transfer to a foreign university. The Centre also holds major international conferences, organised by both Monash and other academic institutions. Additionally, it regularly hosts a range of guest speakers for students, staff and the local community. The Centre also has an Artist-in-Residence program. Since the establishment of the Prato Centre, more than 12,000 students and researchers have studied and worked there.http://www.monash.edu.au/pubs/monmag/issue23-2009/inbrief/old- school.html  Centre Directors  * Professor Bill Kent (2000‚Äì2004) * Dr Annamaria Pagliaro (2005‚Äì2008) * Professor Loretta Baldassar (2009‚Äì2011) * Dr Cecilia Hewlett (2012-)  Notable faculty  Each year, staff from across the world visit the Centre to teach the various courses on offer.

He is considered one of the pioneers of animal sculpture in the nineteenth century. Early life M√™ne was born on 25 March 1810 in Paris, France. As a teenager he worked for his father, a metal turner. By 1837 he was casting his bronze sculptures in his own foundry.Mackay, James, The Animaliers, E. P. Dutton & Co., Inc, 1973 Career The Accolade by Pierre- Jules M√™ne (1851)‚Äîiron version of unknown origin M√™ne produced a number of animal sculptures, mainly of domestic animals including horses, cows and bulls, sheep and goats which were in vogue during the Second Empire. He was one of a school of French animali√®res which also included Rosa Bonheur, Paul- Edouard Delabrierre, Pierre Louis Rouillard, Antoine-Louis Barye, his son Alfred, son-in-law Auguste Ca√Øn and Fran√ßois Pompon. His work was first shown in London by Ernest Gambart in 1849. M√™ne specialized in small bronze figures which explains why none of his works exist as public statuary. His work was a popular success with the bourgeois class and many editions of each sculpture were made, often to decorate private homes. The quality of these works is high, comparable to Barye's. M√™ne enjoyed a longer period of success and celebrity than his contemporaries. He is considered to have been the lost-wax casting expert of his time. The lost-wax casting method is sometimes referred to as the cire perdue method. =Copies, forgeries and reproductions= Because M√™ne was so prolific and because so many editions of his works were made, his work is sometimes undervalued in the current market, and forgeries and reproductions of his works abound. However, original pieces cast during his lifetime continue to bring good prices at auction. Russian foundries are known to have copied M√™ne's work. These castings can be recognized by the appearance of a small plaque, inscribed in Cyrillic, most often found on the underside of the base of the sculpture. After M√®ne's death in 1879, the Susse Freres foundry acquired the rights to reproduce his models and produced posthumous proofs marked \\"Susse foundeur √©diteur, Paris\\". Death and legacy M√™ne died on 20 May 1879 in Paris, France. He is remembered as one of the finest, and certainly the most prolific, animalier sculptors of all time.

Bayerische Infanterie-Division) was a unit of the Royal Bavarian Army, part of the Imperial German Army, in World War I. The division was formed on March 3, 1915, and organized over the next few weeks.10\\\\. Bayerische Infanterie-Division (Chronik 1915/1918) It was part of a wave of new infantry divisions formed in the spring of 1915. The division was disbanded in August 1918 and its assets distributed to other units. The division was formed primarily from the excess infantry regiments of existing divisions which were being triangularized. The division's 20th Bavarian Infantry Brigade was formerly the 1st Bavarian Infantry Brigade of the 1st Bavarian Infantry Division. The 16th Bavarian Infantry Regiment also came from the 1st Bavarian Infantry Division; the 6th Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment came from the 5th Bavarian Reserve Division; and the 8th Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment came from the 4th Bavarian Infantry Division. Combat chronicle The 10th Bavarian Infantry Division initially served on the Western Front, entering the line on the Somme in March 1915. It remained on the Somme into 1916 and fought in the Battle of the Somme in June and July 1916. It was then transferred to the Eastern Front, arriving in Galicia in August. It then fought in the Romanian campaign, fighting in Bukovina and Transylvania. From February to May 1917, the division served on the Galician front under the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army against the Russian Army, where it engaged in several assault troop (Sto√ütrupp) operations. It then returned to the Western Front, arriving in Alsace at the end of May and remaining in the line there for several weeks. It then fought in the battles in Flanders known generally as the Battle of Passchendaele. In October 1917, the division left the line and returned to the Eastern Front, deploying along the Upper Styr and Stokhod rivers but reportedly seeing no action. In late November, it went back to the Western Front, and went into the line in Lorraine until May 1918. It then fought near Soissons for the next several months and in the Second Battle of the Marne. On August 6, 1918, the division was dissolved, with its assets distributed to other units. Allied intelligence rated the division as second class.Histories of Two Hundred and Fifty-One Divisions of the German Army which Participated in the War (1914-1918), compiled from records of Intelligence section of the General Staff, American Expeditionary Forces, at General Headquarters, Chaumont, France 1919 (1920), pp. 194-196.

Robert Schumann compared this scherzo to a Byronic poem, \\"so overflowing with tenderness, boldness, love and contempt.\\" According to Wilhelm von Lenz, a pupil of Chopin, the composer said that the renowned sotto voce opening was a question and the second phrase the answer: \\"For Chopin it was never questioning enough, never soft enough, never vaulted (tombe) enough. It must be a charnel-house.\\" Huneker exults, \\"What masterly writing, and it lies in the very heart of the piano! A hundred generations may not improve on these pages.\\"  Structure  The beginning is marked Presto and opens in B flat minor. However, most of the work is written in D flat major.

It makes use of the [O III] Œª5007 forbidden line found in all planetary nebula (PNe) which are members of the old stellar populations (Population II). It can be used to determine distances to both spiral and elliptical galaxies despite their completely different stellar populations and is part of the Extragalactic Distance Scale.  Procedure  The distance estimate to a galaxy using the PNLF requires discovery of such an object in the target galaxy that is visible at Œª5007 but not when the entire spectrum is considered. These points are candidate PNe, however, there are three other types of objects that would also exhibit such an emission line that must be filtered out: HII regions, supernova remnants, and LyŒ± galaxies. After the PNe are determined, to estimate a distance one must measure their monochromatic [O III] Œª5007 luminosity. What remains is a statistical sample of PNe. The observed luminosity function is then fitted to some standard law. Finally, one must estimate the foreground interstellar extinction. The two sources of extinction, are from within the Milky Way and the internal extinction of the target galaxy. The first is well known and can be taken from sources such as reddening maps computed from H I measurements and galaxy counts or from IRAS and DIRBE satellite experiments. The later type of extinction, occurs only in target galaxies which are either late type spiral or irregular. However, this extinction is difficult to measure. In the Milky Way, the scale height of PNe is much bigger than that of the dust. Observational data and models support that this holds true for other galaxies, that the bright edge of the PNLF is primarily due to PNe in front of the dust layer. The data and models support a less than 0.05 apparent magnitude internal extinction of a galaxy's PNe.  Physics behind process  The PNLF method is unbiased by metallicity. This is because oxygen is a primary nebular coolant; any drop in its concentration raises the plasma's electron temperature and raises the amount of collisional excitations per ion. This compensates for having a smaller number of emitting ions in the PNe resulting in little change in the Œª5007 emissions . Consequently, a reduction in oxygen density only lowers the emergent [O III] Œª5007 emission line intensity by approximately the square root of the difference in abundance. At the same time, the PNe's core responds to metallicity the opposite way. In the case where the metallicity of the progenitor star is smaller, the PNe's central star will be a bit more massive and its illuminating ultraviolet flux will be a bit greater. This added energy almost precisely accounts for the decreased emissions of the PNe. Consequently, the total [O III] Œª5007 lumonisity that is produced by a PNe is practically uncorrelated to metallicity. This beneficial negation is in agreement with more precise models of PNe evolution. Only in extremely metal- poor PNe does the brightness of the PNLF cutoff dim by more than a small percentage. The relative independence of the PNLF cutoff with respect to population age is harder to understand. The [O III] Œª5007 flux of a PNe directly correlates to the brightness of its central star. Further, the brightness of its central star directly correlates to its mass and the central star's mass directly varies in relation to its progenitor's mass. However, by observation, it is demonstrated that reduced brightness does not happen.

Grief counseling is a form of psychotherapy that aims to help people cope with the physical, emotional, social, spiritual, and cognitive responses to loss. These experiences are commonly thought to be brought on by a loved person's death, but may more broadly be understood as shaped by any significant life-altering loss (e.g., divorce, home foreclosure, or job loss). Grief counselors believe that everyone experiences and expresses grief in personally unique ways that are shaped by family background, culture, life experiences, personal values, and intrinsic beliefs. They believe that it is not uncommon for a person to withdraw from their friends and family and feel helpless; some might be angry and want to take action. Some may laugh while others experience strong regrets or guilt. Tears or the lack of crying can both be seen as appropriate expressions of grief. Grief counselors know that one can expect a wide range of emotion and behavior associated with grief. Some counselors believe that in virtually all places and cultures, the grieving person benefits from the support of others.Nadeau, Janice Winchester: Families Making Sense of Death. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage, 1998 Further, grief counselors believe that where such support is lacking, counseling may provide an avenue for healthy resolution. Grief counselors also believe that where the process of grieving is interrupted, for example, by the one who is grieving having to simultaneously deal with practical issues of survival or by their having to be the strong one who is striving to hold their family together, grief can remain unresolved and later resurface as an issue for counseling.  Counseling  Grief counseling becomes necessary when a person is so disabled by their grief; and, so overwhelmed by their loss that their normal coping processes are disabled or shut down.Neimeyer, Robert: Lessons of Loss: A Guide to Coping. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1998 Grief counseling facilitates expression of emotion and thought about the loss, including their feeling sad, anxious, angry, lonely, guilty, relieved, isolated, confused, or numb. It includes thinking creatively about the challenges that follow loss and coping with concurrent changes in their lives. Often people feel disorganized, tired, have trouble concentrating, sleep poorly and have vivid dreams, and they may experience the change in appetite. These too are addressed in counseling. Grief counseling facilitates the process of resolution in the natural reactions to loss. It is appropriate for reaction to losses that have overwhelmed a person's coping ability. There are considerable resources online covering grief or loss counseling such as the Grief Counseling Resource Guide from the New York State Office of Mental Health. Grief counseling may be called upon when a person suffers anticipatory grief, for example, an intrusive and frequent worry about a loved one whose death is neither imminent nor likely. Anticipatory mourning also occurs when a loved one has a terminal illness. This can handicap that person's ability to stay present whilst simultaneously holding onto, letting go of, and drawing closer to the dying relative.Rando, Therese A.: Clinical Dimensions of Anticipatory Mourning. Champaign, IL: Research Press, 2000 Joanne Jozefowski in 1999 through The Phoenix Phenomenon: Rising from the Ashes of Grief summarizes five stages to rebuild a shattered life. * Impact: shock, denial, anxiety, fear, and panic. * Chaos: confusion, disbelief, actions out of control, irrational thoughts and feelings, feeling despair, feeling helpless, desperate searching, losing track of time, difficulty sleeping and eating, obsessive focus on the loved one and their possessions, agony from imagining their physical harm, shattered beliefs. * Adapting: bringing order back into daily life while you continue to grieve: take care of basic needs (personal grooming, shopping, cooking, cleaning, paying bills), learn to live without the loved one, accept help, focus on helping children cope, connect with other grieving families for mutual support, take control of grieving so that grief does not control you, slowly accept the new reality. * Equilibrium: attaining stability and routines: reestablish a life that works alright, enjoy pleasant activities with family members and good times with friends, do productive work, choose a positive new direction in life while honoring the past, learn how to handle people who ask questions about what you‚Äôve been through. * Transformation: rethinking your purpose in life and the basis for your identity; looking for meaning in tragic, senseless loss; allowing yourself to have both painful and positive feelings about your loss and become able to choose which feelings you focus on; allowing yourself to discover that your struggle has led you to develop a stronger, better version of yourself than you expected could exist; learning how to talk with others about your heroic healing journey without exposing them to your pain; becoming supportive of others trying to deal with their losses.  Grief therapy  There is a distinction between grief counseling and grief therapy. Counseling involves helping people move through uncomplicated, or normal, grief to health and resolution. Grief therapy involves the use of clinical tools for traumatic or complicated grief reactions.Jacobs, Shelby, Carolyn Mazure, and Holly Prigerson. Diagnostic Criteria for Traumatic Grief. Death Studies 24 (2000):185‚Äì199 This could occur where the grief reaction is prolonged or manifests itself through some bodily or behavioral symptom, or by a grief response outside the range of cultural or psychiatrically defined normality.Worden, J. William. Grief Counseling and Grief Therapy, 2nd edition. New York: Springer, 1991 Grief therapy is a kind of psychotherapy used to treat severe or complicated traumatic grief reactions, which are usually brought on by the loss of a close person (by separation or death) or by community disaster. The goal of grief therapy is to identify and solve the psychological and emotional problems which appeared as a consequence. They may appear as behavioral or physical changes, psychosomatic disturbances, delayed or extreme mourning, conflictual problems or sudden and unexpected mourning. Grief therapy may be available as individual or group therapy. A common area where grief therapy has been extensively applied is with the parents of cancer patients. = Controversies =  Efficacy and iatrogenesis  At present (as of 2008), a controversy exists in the scholarly literature regarding grief therapy's relative efficacy and the possible harm from it (iatrogenesis). Researchers have suggested that people may resort to receiving grief therapy in the absence of complicated (or abnormal) grief reactions and that, in such cases, grief therapy may cause a normal bereavement response to turn pathological. Others have argued that grief therapy is highly effective for people who suffer from unusually prolonged and complicated responses to bereavement. In March 2007, an article in the APS journal, Perspectives on Psychological Science, included grief counseling and grief therapy on a list of treatments with the potential to cause harm to clients. In particular, individuals experiencing \\"relatively normal bereavement reactions\\" were said to be at risk of a worse outcome (i.e, an abnormally prolonged or difficult grieving process) after receiving grief counseling. The APS journal article in turn has been criticized in the British Psychological Society's publication the psychologist as lacking scientific rigour.\\"When therapy causes harm\\", by Christian Jarrett, the psychologist, Volume 21, Part I, January 2008.  Validity of \\"complicated grief\\"  Some mental health professionals have questioned whether complicated grief exists. New diagnostic criteria for \\"complicated grief\\" have been proposed for the new DSM, the DSM-V. One argument against creating a classification for \\"complicated grief\\" holds that it is not a unique mental disorder. Rather it is a combination of other mental disorders, such as depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and personality disorders. Empirical studies have been attempting to convincingly establish the incremental validity of complicated grief. In 2007, George Bonanno and colleagues published a paper describing a study that supports the incremental validity of complicated grief.http://faculty.tc.columbia.edu/upload/gab38/2007_Bonanno,Neria,Mancini,Coifman,Litz,&Insel.pdf; The paper cautions, \\"the question of how complicated grief symptoms might be organized diagnostically is still very much open to debate.\\" As this is a current debate in the field, new research on this topic is likely to appear in the scientific literature. Trauma counseling Anticipating the impact of loss or trauma (to the extent than anyone can), and during and after the events of loss or trauma, each person has unique emotional experiences and ways of coping, of grieving and of reacting or not. Sudden, violent or unexpected loss or trauma imposes additional strains on coping. When a community is affected such as by disaster both the cost and sometimes the supports are greater. Weeping, painful feelings of sadness, anger, shock, guilt, helplessness and outrage are not uncommon. These are particularly challenging times for childrenKathleen Nader, K. Understanding and Assessing Trauma in Children and Adolescents Measures, Methods, and Youth in Context. Routledge, 2007 who may have had little experience managing strong affects within themselves or in their family. These feelings are all part of a natural healing process that draws on the resilience of the person, family and community. Time and the comfort and support of understanding loved ones and once strangers who come to their aid, supports people healing in their own time and their own way. Research shows that resilience is ordinary rather than extraordinary.The Road to Resilience, APA Pamphlet http://www.apahelpcenter.org/dl/the_road_to_resilience.pdf The majority of people who survive loss and trauma do not go on to develop PTSD. Some remain overwhelmed. This article addresses counseling with complex grief and trauma, not only complex post-traumatic stress disorder but those conditions of traumatic loss and psychological trauma that for a number of reasons are enduring or disabling. For example, where an adult is periodically immobilised by unwelcome and intrusive recall of the sudden and violent deathRynearson E.K, Editor: Resilience and Intervention Beyond the Crisis, Routledge, 2006 of a parent in their childhood. =The post-trauma self= Because of the interconnectedness of trauma, PTSD, human development, resiliency and the integration of the self, counseling of the complex traumatic aftermath of a violent death in the family, for example, require an integrative approach, using a variety of skills and techniques to best fit the presentation of the problem. The post-traumatic self may not be the same person as before.Wilson J.P, The Posttraumatic Self Restoring Meaning and Wholeness to Personality, Routledge, 2005 This can be the source of shame, secondary shocks after the event and of grief for the lost unaltered self, which impacts on family and work. Counseling in these circumstances is designed to maximize safety, trauma processing, and reintegration regardless of the specific treatment approach.Julian D. Ford, Christine A.

Generally a motion system is made up of a set (or stack) of linear and rotational stages. A linear stage moves in a straight line, while a rotation stage moves in a partial or full circle. A stage can either be manually controlled with a knob control, or automated with a motion controller. A motion system generally is computer controlled and can perform fast, reliable, repeatable, and accurate positioning of loads. Most systems will support motion in X and Y directions, which is referred to as an XY stack. Often either a Z axis (up/down motion) or R axis (rotational motion) is placed on top of the XY stack. For automated stages, a scale can be attached to the internals of the stage and an encoder used to measure the position on the scale and report this to the controller, thereby determining the precise position of the stage.

His main areas of study are the psychology of morality and moral emotions. Haidt's main scientific contributions come from the psychological field of moral foundations theory, which attempts to explain the evolutionary origins of human moral reasoning on the basis of innate, gut feelings rather than logical reason. The theory was later extended to explain the different moral reasoning and how they relate to political ideology, with different political orientations prioritizing different sets of morals. The research served as a foundation for future books on various topics. Haidt has written three books for general audiences, including: The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom (2006) explores the relationship between ancient philosophies and modern science; The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion (2012) examines how morality is shaped by emotion and intuition more than by reasoning, and why differing political groups have different notions of right and wrong; and The Coddling of the American Mind: How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas Are Setting Up a Generation for Failure (2018), co-written with Greg Lukianoff, explores the rising political polarization and changing culture on college campuses, and its effects on mental health. Haidt has attracted both support and criticism for his critique of the current state of universities and his interpretation of progressive values. He has been named one of the \\"top global thinkers\\" by Foreign Policy magazine, and one of the \\"top world thinkers\\" by Prospect magazine. He is among the most cited researchers in political and moral psychology, and is considered among the top 25 most influential living psychologists.  Biography  Haidt is Jewish and was born in New York City, raised in Scarsdale, New York.By George Eaton 2 January 2019 New Statesman His grandparents were immigrants from Russia and Poland. = Education and career = Haidt received a BA in philosophy from Yale University in 1985, and a PhD in psychology from the University of Pennsylvania in 1992. He then studied cultural psychology at the University of Chicago as a postdoctoral fellow, supervised by Jonathan Baron and Alan Fiske (at the University of Pennsylvania), and cultural anthropologist Richard Shweder (University of Chicago). At Shweder's suggestion, he visited Orissa, India, to continue his research. In 1995, Haidt was hired as an assistant professor at the University of Virginia, where he worked until 2011, winning four awards for teaching, including a statewide award conferred by the Governor of Virginia. In 1999, Haidt became active in the new field of positive psychology, studying positive moral emotions. This work led to the publication of an edited volume, titled Flourishing, in 2003. In 2004, Haidt began to apply moral psychology to the study of politics, doing research on the psychological foundations of ideology. This work led to the publication in 2012 of The Righteous Mind. Haidt spent the 2007‚Äì2008 academic year at Princeton University as the Visiting Professor for Distinguished Teaching. In 2011, Haidt moved to New York University Stern School of Business as the Thomas Cooley Professor of Ethical Leadership. In 2013, he co-founded Ethical Systems, a non-profit collaboration dedicated to making academic research on ethics widely available to businesses. In 2015, Haidt co-founded Heterodox Academy, a non-profit organization that works to increase viewpoint diversity, mutual understanding, and productive disagreement. In 2018, Haidt and Richard Reeves co-edited an illustrated edition of John Stuart Mill's On Liberty, titled All Minus One: John Stuart Mill‚Äôs Ideas on Free Speech Illustrated (illustrated by Dave Cicirelli). Haidt's current research applies moral psychology to business ethics.  Research contributions  Haidt speaking at the Miller Center of Public Affairs in Charlottesville (March 19, 2012). Haidt's research on morality has led to publications and theoretical advances in four key areas. = Moral disgust = Together with Paul Rozin and Clark McCauley, Haidt developed the Disgust Scale, which has been widely used to measure individual differences in sensitivity to disgust. Haidt, Rozin, and McCauley have written on the psychology of disgust as an emotion that began as a guardian of the mouth (against pathogens), but then expanded during biological and cultural evolution to become a guardian of the body more generally, and of the social and moral order. = Moral elevation = With Sara Algoe, Haidt argued that exposure to stories about moral beauty (the opposite of moral disgust) cause a common set of responses, including warm, loving feelings, calmness, and a desire to become a better person.Algoe, Sara B. and Jonathan Haidt. 2009. \\"Witnessing excellence in action: The 'other-praising' emotions of elevation, gratitude, and admiration.\\" Journal of Positive Psychology 4:105‚Äì27. Haidt called the emotion moral elevation,Haidt, Jonathan. 2003. \\"Elevation and the positive psychology of morality.\\" Pp. 275‚Äì89 in Flourishing: Positive Psychology and the Life Well-lived, edited by C. L. M. Keyes and J. Haidt. Washington, DC: American Psychological Association. as a tribute to Thomas Jefferson, who had described the emotion in detail in a letter discussing the benefits of reading great literature.Jefferson, Thomas. [1771] 1975. \\"Letter to Robert Skipwith.\\" Pp. 349‚Äì51 in The Portable Thomas Jefferson, edited by M. D. Peterson. New York: Penguin. Feelings of moral elevation cause lactation in breastfeeding mothers,Silvers, J., and Jonathan Haidt. 2008. \\"Moral elevation causes lactation.\\" Emotion 8:291‚Äì95. suggesting the involvement of the hormone oxytocin. There is now a large body of research on elevation and related emotions. = Social intuitionism = Haidt's principal line of research has been on the nature and mechanisms of moral judgment. In the 1990s, he developed the social intuitionist model, which posits that moral judgment is mostly based on automatic processes‚Äîmoral intuitions‚Äîrather than on conscious reasoning. People engage in reasoning largely to find evidence to support their initial intuitions. Haidt's main paper on the social intuitionist model, \\"The Emotional Dog and its Rational Tail\\", has been cited over 7,800 times. = Moral foundations theory = A simple graphic depicting survey data from the United States intended to support moral foundations theory. In 2004, Haidt began to extend the social intuitionist model to identify what he considered to be the most important categories of moral intuition. The resulting moral foundations theory, co-developed with Craig Joseph and Jesse Graham, and based in part on the writings of Richard Shweder, was intended to explain cross- cultural differences in morality. The theory posited that there are at least five innate moral foundations, upon which cultures develop their various moralities, just as there are five innate taste receptors on the tongue, which cultures have used to create many different cuisines. The five values are: # Care/harm # Fairness/cheating # Loyalty/betrayal # Authority/subversion # Sanctity/degradation. Haidt and his collaborators asserted that the theory also works well to explain political differences. According to Haidt, liberals tend to endorse primarily the care and equality foundations, whereas conservatives tend to endorse all foundations more equally. Later, in The Righteous Mind, a sixth foundation, Liberty/oppression, was presented.  Non- academic works  Haidt has authored three non-academic books for general audiences, related to various subjects in psychology and politics. = The Happiness Hypothesis = The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom (2006) draws on ancient philosophical ideas in light of contemporary scientific research to extract potential lessons and how they may apply to everyday life. The book poses \\"ten Great Ideas\\" on happiness espoused by philosophers and thinkers of the past‚ÄîPlato, Marcus Aurelius, Buddha, Jesus and others‚Äîand considers what modern scientific research has to say regarding these ideas. = The Righteous Mind = The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion (2012) draws on Haidt's previous research on moral foundations theory. It argues that moral judgments arise not from logical reason, but from gut feelings, asserting that liberals, conservatives, and libertarians have different intuitions about right and wrong because they prioritize different values = The Coddling of the American Mind = The Coddling of the American Mind: How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas Are Setting Up a Generation for Failure (2018), co-written with Greg Lukianoff, expands on an essay the authors wrote for The Atlantic in 2015. The book explores the rising political polarization and changing culture on college campuses and its effects on mental health. It also explore changes in childhood, including the rise of \\"fearful parenting,\\" the decline of unsupervised play, and the effects of social media in the last decade. =\\"The Elephant and the Rider\\"= One widely-cited metaphor throughout Haidt's books is that of the elephant and the rider. His observations of social intuitionism‚Äîthe notion that intuitions come first and rationalization second‚Äîled to the metaphor described in his work. The rider represents consciously controlled processes, and the elephant represents automatic processes. The metaphor corresponds to Systems 1 and 2 described in Daniel Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow. This metaphor is used extensively in both The Happiness Hypothesis and The Righteous Mind.  Political views  Haidt describes how he began to study political psychology in order to help the Democratic Party win more elections, and argues that each of the major political groups‚Äîconservatives, progressives, and libertarians‚Äîhave valuable insights and that truth and good policy emerge from the contest of ideas. Since 2012, Haidt has referred to himself as a political centrist.Goldman, Andrew, interviewer. July 27, 2012. \\"A Liberal Learns To Compete.\\" The New York Times. Retrieved July 27, 2020. Haidt is involved with several efforts to help bridge the political divide and reduce political polarization in the United States. In 2007, he founded the website CivilPolitics.org, a clearinghouse for research on political civility. He serves on the advisory boards of Represent.Us., a non-partisan anti-corruption organization; the Acumen Fund, which invests in companies, leaders, and ideas that are changing the way the world tackles poverty; and braverangels.org, a bipartisan group working to reduce political polarization. In 2019, Haidt argued that there is a \\"very good chance American democracy will fail, that in the next 30 years we will have a catastrophic failure of our democracy.\\"  Reception  While himself an atheist, Haidt has argued that religion contains psychological wisdom that can promote human flourishing, and that the New Atheists have themselves succumbed to moralistic dogma. These contentions elicited a variety of responses in a 2007 online debate sponsored by the website Edge. PZ Myers praised the first part of Haidt's essay while disagreeing with his criticism of the New Atheists; Sam Harris criticized Haidt for his perceived obfuscation of harms caused by religion; Michael Shermer praised Haidt; and biologist David Sloan Wilson joined Haidt in criticizing the New Atheists for dismissing the notion that religion is an evolutionary adaptation. David Mikics of Tablet magazine profiled Haidt as \\"the high priest of heterodoxy\\" and praised his work to increase intellectual diversity at universities through Heterodox Academy. In 2020, Peter Wehner wrote in The Atlantic that \\"Over the past decade, no one has added more to my understanding of how we think about, discuss, and debate politics and religion than Jonathan Haidt.\\" He added that, \\"In his own field, in his own way, Jonathan Haidt is trying to heal our divisions and temper some of the hate, to increase our wisdom and understanding, and to urge us to show a bit more compassion toward one another.\\"  Publications  = Books = * 2002.

After being activated as a National Guard division, it was quickly redesignated the 38th Division. The 17th Division was reestablished in 1918 as a war service (National Army) division. The 17th Division included the 33rd Infantry Brigade (September 1918 ‚Äì February 1919), with the 5th and 83rd Regiments, and the 34th Brigade with the 29th and 84th Regiments.McGrath, 2009, p. 167.

He has written more than 30 books with a variety of US, UK and Japanese publishers and has been nominated for both the Eisner and Harvey book awards, and won a medal in the Japanese government's 'International Manga Award', 2016 (the first British person to receive that award). Biography Growing up in Edinburgh, Wilson was deeply inspired to create comic books at an early age by the comic 2000 AD. He largely focused on writing poetry and short stories while studying Sociology and Psychology at Glasgow Caledonian University and a postgraduate in Anthropology at Edinburgh University. He later graduated as a lecturer in those subjects from the University of London (UCL). He mixed teaching with working on documentary films for British television until deciding to return to focus on his first love, comic books. In 2014 he was listed among the 'Ten Great Scottish Graphic Novel Creators' by the Scottish Book Trust. Wilson's first published comics story came out in 1998 in a book and display of an exhibition of comic art in London. Although around half of his books are 'western' style graphic novels, he often works with Japanese and Chinese artists on manga style books, being ideally placed to do so as he now lives in Japan. He is influenced by the Gekiga movement writers, Yoshihiro Tatsumi, Yoshiharu Tsuge, Matsumoto Masahiko. His first Japanese language work came out in Summer 2008 on the Japanese keitai manga network (comics on cell/mobile phone). Making him perhaps the first British comic book writer to have his work available on Japanese mobile phones. He is also the only British comic book writer, so far, to have a multi-book deal with the Kodansha publishing group in Japan. He edited the groundbreaking collection of indie style manga, 'AX: alternative manga', for Top Shelf Publications - which was highly praised by critics ('Top ten books of 2010' of Publishers Weekly, nominated for a prestigious Harvey Award) and noted as the most important such collection of manga yet published. But his main influences remain British and American comics, such as creators Alan Moore, Grant Morrison, Eddie Campbell and Harvey Pekar. Wilson's work is equally split between original stories and adaptations of existing work into comic book form. Several of his books have been adaptations for the UK publisher Classical Comics. This has involved working with a range of well-known artists adapting 19th-century novels into comic books that stay close to the original in plot and historical accuracy. Including 'A Christmas Carol' (with Judge Dredd, Wonder Woman and Dr Who artist Mike Collins, and with sales so far of more than 20,000 copies), 'Sweeney Todd', Oscar Wilde's 'A Canterville Ghost' and 'Wuthering Heights' (with esteemed artist John M Burns of 2000AD, Look and Learn, etc). Wilson has attempted to do comic books that are different from the normal superhero/fantasy brands, working with a variety of 'non-comic book' organisations in the process, such as a British museum, the UK arts council, the Global Institute for Tomorrow, Bristol University, Asia Literary Review, the Norwegian People's Alliance, the British and American Humanist Associations, Basic Income groups and the activist charity War on Want. His book with War on Want, 'Iraq:Operation Corporate Takeover' was reported on by a variety of mainstream agencies across the world, such as Reuters, CCTV in China, Austrian Radio and several middle eastern magazines. His book 'Parecomic' has an introduction by Noam Chomsky, who is also in the book several times - Chomsky's first official connection with a graphic novel. His book contrasting science and religion, Goodbye God?, was made with the participation of English philosopher Stephen Law of the University of London and an introduction by Prof. Lawrence Krauss. In May 2019 his book 'The Many Not the Few' with artists Robert Brown (published by New Internationalist and the British Union GFTU) was launched in the UK parliament building, the House of Commons. This is the first time a comic book has had a launched event in the House of Commons. Shadow chancellor, John McDonell, and Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, attended - with both making well received speeches in support of the book. His work has been translated into Japanese, Chinese, French, Spanish, Korean, Croatian, Indonesian, Czech, Turkish, Swedish and Italian. Recent or current projects include: an unusual illustrated version of the Chinese classic 'Tao Te Ching' and 'The Garden' with new British publisher Liminal 11. Wilson is a regular guest at comic book festivals, schools and colleges where he gives talks and workshops about comics and alternative manga. He also occasionally writes newspaper articles for places such as The Japan Times, the London Economic, the Herald and his own article website 'Radical Fun'. 2008 New York Comic con Guests at nycomiccon.com Awards and recognition * 2008 Wilson's version of A Christmas Carol, with artists Mike Collins and David Roach, in The Sunday Times 'Ten Best Books of the Year' * 2010 AX: alternative manga, edited by Wilson, nominated for the prestigious Harvey Award. * 2012 Wilson's version of Wuthering Heights, with John M Burns, nominated for the 'Stan Lee Excelsior Awards' in 2012, by over 170 schools in the UK. * 2012 Wilson's version of A Christmas Carol, with Mike Collins and David Roach, won gold medal in the 2012 'Language Learner Literature Awards'. * 2013 Wilson's version of 'Sweeney Todd', with Declan Shalvey, wins the JABICA award of the 'Stan Lee Excelsior Awards'. * 2014 Wilson listed among the 'Ten Great Scottish Graphic Novel Creators' by the Scottish Book Trust. * 2015 The anthology of stories about WW1 Wilson was part of, 'To End All Wars', was nominated for 'Best Anthology' in the 2015 Eisner awards. * 2015 Cold Mountain, with Akiko Shimojima, won an award in the national 'China Animation and Comic Competition' (in the category of 'Best Overseas Comic'). * 2016 Lafcadio Hearn‚Äôs \\"The Faceless Ghost\\", with Michiru Morikawa, on recommended reading list, 'Great Graphic Novels for Teens', of the library association,USA. * 2016 Lafcadio Hearn‚Äôs \\"The Faceless Ghost\\", with Michiru Morikawa, won a medal in the 2016 'Independent Book Publishers Awards', USA. * 2016 Lafcadio Hearn‚Äôs \\"The Faceless Ghost\\", with Michiru Morikawa, nominated for an Eisner Award, the top award for comic books in the USA. * 2016 Secrets of the Ninja, with Akiko Shimojima, won a medal in the 'International Manga Awards' of the Japanese Government. * 2018 Portraits of Violence, with Dr Brad Evans, won a medal in the 2018 'Independent Book Publishers Awards', USA.

As of 2007, the river is in the news because of the possibility that it might merge with the Jamuna River, which could lead to major changes in the geography of the region. Etymology In the later part of the 18th century, movements against the British Raj erupted in North Bengal. Two of the major centers of the Fakir- Sanyasi Rebellion were Bogra District and Rangpur, located on two sides of the Bangali River. Whether this was the reason that prompted the name Bangali (the people of Bengal) is still unknown.  Geography  The Bangali River originates as a distributary of Teesta River in Nilphamari District. The river flows as the Ghaghot River from its source to Gaibandha, where it splits into two branches --one moves towards the west as the \\"Ghaghot\\" and empties into the Karatoya River at Sherpur, Bogra District; the other section of the Bangali River flows to the south and subsequently breaks into two sections in Bogra. These two sections join the Jamuna and Karatoa. There are a number of distributaries of the Bangali River such as the Belal, Manosh, Modhukhali, Ichamoti, and Volka among others. These distributaries often dry up in the winter season. Recently, with a gradual decrease in the flow of the Teesta River, the Jamuna has become the main source of water for the Bangali River. Some scientists, including former executive director of the River Research Institute, Abdul Wajed, consider the Jamuna to be the primary source of the river. Similar to other rivers in the region, the Bangali undergoes several divisions and receives multiple tributaries. According to the Bogra District Gazetteer, the Bangali River flows through Sariakandi Upazila to the south east and reaches Chou-Ghata. Thereafter, at Jurigacha, it splits into two major branches. The western branch named Hal-Halia flows towards the south passing across Bogra, Sherpur and Dhunat Upazila. The eastern branch continues as the Bangali River through Dhunat Thana. At Bathuabari in Dhunat, the two branches meet again and the conjoined flow continues by the name of \\"Fuljhur\\", which turns towards the west near South Pantabari and arrives at a place called Kachari Kallyani. The name of the stream changes here to Khanpur Mohona which soon drains into the Karatoa. From there, the combined Bangali‚ÄìKaratoa flows by Modhiabagh, Himabari and Sherpur. Very cool river.  History The present-day streams of Jamuna and Teesta were created after a massive flood in 1787. The flood had a major impact on the geography of rivers in the region; several rivers changed course, and the changes continued for the next forty years. Prior to the flood, the Brahmaputra River used to pass through Mymensingh and Bhoirob Bazaar to meet the Meghna River. After 1787, the Brahmaputra changed its course to drain into the Padma River. Along with changes in course, the Jamauna and Teesta also gave rise to new distributaries in the aftermath of the 1787 flood. It is speculated that the Bangali River was born out of those changes of course of the Jamuna and Teesta. Concerns Scientists are concerned about the current condition of the Bangali River. According to the \\"Pani Unnoyon Board\\" (Water Development Board), every year the Jamuna moves closer to the Bangali as a result of erosion of its banks. As of 2007, a stretch of only separates the two rivers, an alarming sign for the continued existence of the Bangali River. Engineers worry that if these two rivers merge, an area of 1,000 square kilometres and of Bogra and Sirajganj will be completely submerged under water. Water would destroy the Bogra‚ÄìNagarbari road and eventually cause the Bangabandhu Bridge over the Jamuna to be ineffective. It would increase annual flooding in the floodplain of Bangali River.

When buxom hostess Dagmar appeared on Sinatra's CBS-TV show on April 7, 1951, Columbia Records A&R; head Mitch Miller became intrigued by the comic chemistry he perceived between the unlikely duo. With that in mind, songwriter Dick Manning (who would later compose such hits as \\"Fascination\\") penned \\"Mama Will Bark\\", which featured off-key talking/singing by Dagmar and sound effects of dogs barking. Miller produced the session on May 10, 1951, and the song was released the following month. \\"Mama Will Bark\\" is commonly cited as an emblematic low point in Sinatra's troubled later years at Columbia.

The Tour Championship was first played at the course in 1998. The 2019 Tour Championship and FedEx Cup champion is Rory McIlroy. All proceeds from operations at East Lake Golf Club‚Äîmore than $20 million to date‚Äîgo to support the East Lake Foundation, which has helped transform one of the nation's worst public housing projects into a thriving community. History =Early years= Old postcard of the course at East Lake. The Atlanta Athletic Club (AAC) was formed in 1898 and due to its popularity it gained 700 members in only four years. The director of the club's athletic program was John Heisman, the famous football coach for whom the Heisman Trophy is named. In 1904 the AAC bought property at East Lake to build a country club which included a golf course. Course architect Tom Bendelow was asked to lay out the course. Bobby Jones age 9 shown playing golf at his home course at East Lake. The course's first holes were built in 1906 and were initially only seven holes, then nine. In the summer of 1907, the course was expanded to 17 holes, and later that year the 18th hole was built to complete it. Also in 1907, the first significant tournament was hosted at East Lake, the Southern Amateur, won by Nelson Whitney. In 1908, Tom Bendelow opened his \\"No. 2\\" course at East Lake. In 1913, famed golf course architect Donald Ross redesigned the course at East Lake. The new plan provided for each of the nine holes to conclude at the clubhouse. Ross also redesigned the No. 2 course in 1928. A tragic fire destroyed the original clubhouse at East Lake in 1925. Following the fire, famed architect Philip Shutze, who is known for constructing the famous Swan House in Buckhead, was hired by the club to build East Lake's present day two- story Tudor style clubhouse. Stewart Maiden golfing at East Lake Golfer Bobby Jones is said to have played his first and last games of golf at East Lake. Jones won golf's Grand Slam in 1930, claiming the U.S. Amateur, U.S. Open, British Amateur and British Open titles in the same year. Jones's father, \\"Colonel\\" Robert P. Jones, served as the president of East Lake from 1937‚Äì42 and as a director for 38 years. Bobby Jones himself also served as president of East Lake on 1946‚Äì47. Other notable East Lake players around the same time were amateurs Watts Gunn, Perry Adair, Charlie Yates and Alexa Stirling Fraser many of whom were assisted by East Lake's golf professional Stewart Maiden. In 1963, East Lake hosted the 15th biennial Ryder Cup where Arnold Palmer served as the playing captain of the winning US Team. =Redevelopment= East Lake began a downward slope when the surrounding neighborhood deteriorated in the 1960s and became victim to suburban flight. The Atlanta Athletic Club became a part of this when it sold the No. 2 course to developers and moved to its current home in Johns Creek. The original course and clubhouse were saved by a group of 25 members, led by Atlanta businessman Paul Grigsby, who purchased them and created East Lake Country Club in 1968. In 1970, the East Lake Meadows public housing project was built on the site of the No. 2 golf course and became a center for poverty, drugs and violence. Middle-income homeowners fled the surrounding neighborhood, replaced by low-income renters. By the 1980s, East Lake became a mostly forgotten golf course in a seemingly hopeless neighborhood. This all changed in 1993 when a local charitable foundation headed by Tom Cousins purchased East Lake with the intent to restore it as a tribute to Bobby Jones and the club's other great amateur golfers. The East Lake Foundation was also created and has used the renovation as a catalyst for revitalizing the surrounding community. In 1994, Rees Jones, son of golf course architect Robert Trent Jones, restored Donald Ross' original golf course design at East Lake to its current layout. In 1998 the Tour Championship was hosted at East Lake for the first time. In 2005 East Lake was named the permanent home of the Tour Championship. East Lake has hosted the tournament 16 times since 1998.  Today Jordan Spieth and Henrik Stenson on the 17th Green during the 2015 Tour Championship =Golf with a Purpose= All of the profits from East Lake Golf Club go to support the East Lake Foundation which in turn helps to support the health, education, safety and productivity of the East Lake neighborhood. Because of this, East Lake Golf Club's motto is \\"Golf with a Purpose\\". Based on the success of the East Lake model, a new organization, Purpose Built Communities, was established in 2009 to help fight concentrated segments of poverty in communities throughout the United States. Today, Purpose Built Communities is present in 14 cities in the US. =Charlie Yates Golf Course= In 1998 East Lake's No. 2 golf course was transformed into the Charlie Yates Golf Course, a 9-hole \\"executive\\" public course that provides golf education to children living in the city of Atlanta. The course was rated one of the top 10 short range courses in America by Golf Range Magazine and all profits from the course go to benefit the East Lake Foundation. Charlie Yates was an East Lake golfer who won the British Amateur at Royal Troon Golf Club in 1938. Charlie grew up on Second Avenue, the street which separated East Lake's main course from its No. 2 course. His boyhood hero was Bobby Jones, whom he knew and played with on the course at East Lake. =The Tour Championship= East Lake Golf Club is home to the Tour Championship Since 2004 East Lake Golf Club has been the permanent location of the Tour Championship, the finale of the PGA Tour Playoffs and the FedEx Cup. The Tour Championship is also one of the largest supporters of the East Lake Foundation. =East Lake Cup= In May 2015 it was announced that East Lake would be the site of a new collegiate golf tournament, the East Lake Cup. In partnership with the Golf Channel the East Lake Cup invites the top men's and women's teams from the previous season to compete in a match play championship each November. The tournament is broadcast on the Golf Channel. The inaugural East Lake Cup was played November 2 and 3, 2015. The champions of the first year's tournament were Illinois (men's) and USC (women's). The 2016 the tournament added a day of stroke play to the competition with Illinois winning on the men's side and Duke winning on the women's side. The men's and women's winners of the 2017 East Lake Cup were respectively Vanderbilt University and the University of Southern California. The 2018 winner's were Auburn for the men's side and USC on the women's side.

Prime Earth (Earth-616) *Victor von Doom is a disfigured super-genius. Doom creates a suit of power armor and various inventions in his efforts of world domination and the destruction of Reed Richards. *Kristoff Vernard is the adopted son and heir-apparent to Victor von Doom. Following the apparent murder of Dr. Doom by Terrax, Doom's robots took Kristoff, and brainwashed him, also implanting him with Doom's mental patterns and detailed memories. Vernard believes himself to be the original Dr. Doom, and assumes the role, ambitions, and responsibilities of the Latverian ruler. Alternative universe depictions =1602= In Neil Gaiman's alternative- universe tale, Marvel 1602, Dr. Doom is \\"Count Otto von Doom\\", also known as \\"Otto the Handsome\\". A mastermind genius of physics and even genetics, Von Doom keeps the Four of the Fantastick imprisoned in his castle, continually tapping Richard Reed for knowledge. The Four eventually escape during an attack on Doom's castle by the other heroes of the time, which also leads to the scarring of his face. Otto von Doom returns in 1602: The Fantastick Four, in which he plans to visit a city beyond the edge of the world, believing they have knowledge that could restore his face. He kidnaps William Shakespeare to record these events. =2099= Doom (Victor Von Doom) is a Marvel Comics anti-hero featured in the Marvel 2099 comic book Doom 2099. The character is based on Doctor Doom, created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. The comic was written by John Francis Moore for its first two years and by Warren Ellis for its third. =Age of Apocalypse= In the Age of Apocalypse, Victor von Doom is an agent of the Human High Council and the Head of Security. His facial scar is the result of a mutant uprising in Latveria. Like his 616 counterpart, Von Doom remains a ruthless and ambitious man, though he does not express his counterpart's goal to rule the world. =The End= Cover for Fantastic Four: The End #1. Art by thumb In Alan Davis' mini-series, Fantastic Four: The End, Dr. Doom appears as a four-armed cyborg with little of his humanity left. Doom breaks during the \\"mutant wars\\" and is now a killing machine, focused on the deaths of the Fantastic Four. He engages in final battle with the Four and is killed in an explosion when his powers react with those of Franklin and Valeria Richards. Doom is later revealed to be alive and conquers the Negative Zone after killing Annihilus and obtaining his power rod and immortality. =The Last Fantastic Four Story= Dr. Doom is seen trying to destroy the Adjudicator, however he and his robotic planes are shown to disintegrate and he is last seen cheering the Fantastic Four (even though he will find a way to destroy them). How he survived remains unknown. =House of M= In the House of M continuity, Doom is still the ruler of Latveria, his mother is still alive, he is married to Valeria, and he has adopted Kristoff. Reed Richards's test flight still encounters cosmic radiation, but rather than empowering Reed, Sue and John Jameson, who went up instead of Johnny Storm, the three of them are killed by the cosmic radiation. Ben Grimm survives, but his intelligence is reduced. This inspires Doom to create the Fearsome Four, consisting of himself, the It(Grimm), the Invincible Woman (Valeria), and the Inhuman Torch (Kristoff). Due to Doom's arrogance and his brutality towards Grimm, the It betrays the team; Valeria and Kristoff are killed, his mother is kidnapped, and Doom is left broken, but preparing his revenge. He genetically mutates himself to study and advance technologies and mysticism to better himself to be perfect, and transforms his skin into liquid metal and can form weapons from his hands. =Mini-Marvels= Doctor Doom makes shortly cameos in Mini-Marvels. In the \\"Classic Mini Marvels\\" section, there's a short story about him in which he tries to read Marvel's comics. He can be seen in \\"Civil Guards\\" as one of the doctors that are experimenting with Spider-Man's body. The Avengers also have a photo of Doom in their house, as shown in \\"World War Hulk\\". =MC2= In the Fantastic Five series, Doom is revealed to be held captive by the Sub-Mariner for ten years, after the destruction of Atlantis. Doom manages to escape, and uses the same device he once employed to imbue Terrax with the Power Cosmic on his Doombots- unable to use it on himself as his human body would be destroyed from the strain-, and attempts to take over the world. Taking advantage of Doom's desire to prove himself superior, Reed Richards challenges Doom to a psychic duel, using a device that will send the loser's mind to the Crossroads of Infinity. The two are so evenly matched that both are sent to the Crossroads - although Namor notes that it is possible that Reed sacrificed himself to try to save Doom - leaving their bodies as empty shells, although Reed's teammates note that there is always a possibility that the two shall return so long as their bodies remain alive. =Iron Man= In an alternative future set in 2093, where a reborn King Arthur rules a renewed Camelot aided by Merlin, Doom and Iron Man are drawn to the future to oppose a plan to destroy most of Earth's population. While Iron Man confronts his descendant- wielding Excalibur in order to even the odds against his foe's upgraded armor- Doom meets his future double, who relies on technology to extend his lifespan and has allied with the future Iron Man in order to use his mobility to complete his plan. Doom rejects his future self by pointing out that he would never do such a thing, for even if he seeks power, he always watches the cost of it, and knows that nothing he seeks could be worth such an affront to his dignity. He then kills the older Doom.Iron Man #250 =Marvel Zombies vs. The Army Of Darkness= In more of an anti-hero role, the Earth-2149 version of Doom is still ruler of Latveria. Doom has fortified his castle to defend against the infected superheroes and refuses help from Nick Fury, and takes in refugees for the purpose of repopulating the planet once the situation is resolved. To the disgust of his allies, it is revealed Doom has only chosen the hardiest breeding stock of the Latverian survivors; there are no elderly people or children.Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness #4 He creates a makeshift portal that will allow escape into other dimensions, should the zombie plague doom the planet. Doom is forced to vaporize the mutant Dazzler and the zombified Enchantress after the latter infects the former, but is then attacked by the zombified Marvel superheroes and infected by Reed Richards, who had infected himself and his teammates on purpose.Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness #5 Shortly before he turns, a \\"dying\\" Doom heroically uses his portal to allow the refugees escape to another reality. Despite his defenses, the zombies breaks through once more. With only himself and Ash Williams remaining, he reveals he has been infected by the virus, and cannot go through the portal himself. Though tempted to eat Ash, he resists, as he considers Ash to have allowed him revenge against Reed Richards, allowing the man to escape, even giving him the ability to choose one of many realities. As Ash escapes through it, Doom ultimately destroys the device, trapping himself with the zombies. Having witnessed Doom saving the refugees by using his portal for their escape, the zombified Thing suddenly attacked Doom. He is later seen in New York, as a zombie who attempts to devour Galactus before engaging in battle with the zombified superheroes who succeeded in absorbing Galactus' cosmic powers before him, presumably being killed by them off-screen.Marvel Zombies #1 - 5 (2006) =Amalgam Comics= In the Amalgam Comics community, Dr. Doom was combined with DC's Doomsday to create Dr. Doomsday. =Mutant X= In the Mutant X universe, Doom is a superhero and leader of his own super-team. =Earth-X= In the dystopian future of Earth-X, Doctor Doom has killed the Invisible Woman and the Human Torch, but died in the process. Reed Richards took his place as ruler of Latveria and also wears his armor. =Old Man Logan= In the alternative Wolverine centric future where the supervillains of the Marvel universe finally won and divided America up amongst themselves. Doom has his own area of land called New Latveria. He is seen for only a few panels dressed in all grey standing atop a cliff watching a now old Logan and Hawkeye driving the spider buggy built by the Human Torch. It is believed that Clyde Wyncham has taken on the role of Doom.http://marvel.com/catalog/?id=12981 =God Emperor Doom= God Emperor Doom is the most powerful version of Doctor Doom with power of The Beyonder and other heroes. During Secret Wars, Doctor Doom steal the power of The Beyonder and become God Emperor Doom. =Combat Colin= Doctor Doom made an appearance in Marvel UK's Combat Colin strip. A superheroes convention is attacked by the robotic Steamroller Man. After Combat Colin and his sidekick Semi-Automatic Steve defeats the robot, its controller is revealed to be Doctor Doom, who explains that after years of being defeated by American superheroes he thought (wrongly) he could stand a chance against some incompetent Brits. The final panel shows Doom back in his lair, surrounded by newspaper cuttings detailing his past defeats and wondering how he would do in a fight with Thomas the Tank Engine.Transformers UK #270-271 =Spider-Man: Life Story= In Spider-Man: Life Story a reality in which the Marvel superheroes aged in real time and started their careers the same year as their publication, Doctor Doom has taken over Earth as a result of the Civil War between Captain America and Iron Man and a resistance being formed to combat him composed of those that didn't die or disappear entirely.Spider-Man Life Story #6: All My Enemies =Ultimate Marvel= Doctor Victor von Doom's Earth 1610 doppelg√§nger, Victor van Damme. In the Ultimate Marvel universe, Doctor Doom is Victor van Damme, a direct descendant of Vlad Tepes Dracula. Victor is introduced as part of the Baxter Building, a government think-tank of young geniuses, which counts among its students Reed Richards and Susan Storm. He works to help Reed Richards develop a teleporter to the \\"N-Zone\\", but reprograms its coordinates without telling anyone. This causes the accident that gave the Ultimate Fantastic Four their powers, though Victor maintains that the original Richards programming was so bad that even he couldn't fix it, and that it was this that led to the accident. van Damme is caught in the same accident, and his flesh was changed into a metallic hide (with a somewhat reduced ability to perceive tactile sensations and pain), clawed hands, his legs transmogrified into demonic goat-hooved legs, and he re-appeared on Earth in Copenhagen. Initially, he assumes that he himself was the only one who had been transformed by the accident. Reed speculates this to be the result of Doom's own arrogance causing him to assume that only he was 'worthy' of such a transformation. Doom denounces Reed as a 'freak' during their initial confrontation when he finally learns what Reed's powers are. For a time, he is the charismatic leader of a small micronation called \\"Free State\\", \\"Freezone\\", or \\"The Keep\\", a Permanent Autonomous Zone located in Copenhagen, Denmark, where citizens lived without rent in a shanty town under squatter's rights, and were given free comforts and necessities in exchange for loyalty to Doom. There, a dragon tattoo was given to new settlers, incorporating microfibers that interfaced with the brain and acting as a mind control device. However, the Fantastic Four eventually freed them from Doom's control during their first battle, and all subsequently left, although they were unable to imprison Doom due to his diplomatic immunity as a result of his citizenship. During the Namor fiasco, the mother of Sue and Johnny Storm returned to New York. After the adventure, it was revealed that she possesses a similar dragon tattoo. After the collapse of the Keep, Doom returned to Latveria, and in six months turned the country around. Latveria went from being a Third World nation to the ninth-richest country in the world. While seemingly happy, the citizens of Latveria are bearers of Doom's Dragon tattoos. He is revered by the citizens, who refer to him as \\"the good doctor\\". In the same story arc, he switches bodies with Reed Richards in order to gain a life he felt was rightfully his, though leaving Reed with the wealth and control of Latveria; in his own form of honor, he felt this made him better than Reed, who he blamed for sullying his reputation with his claims that Doom's calculations were the ones at fault. This turned out to be part of his scheme to gain recognition by doing what Reed couldn't do -- specifically, saving Johnny Storm's life from an alien parasite that he himself had summoned. Reed, having studied Doom's magical texts, returns to New York to battle the concurrent threat of the zombie Fantastic Four from an alternative universe, and absorbs the parasite, but it attempts to possess his mind. Reed defeats the zombie Fantastic Four and is willing to lose himself in the dimensions to erase the zombie threat, but Doom switches their bodies back and does so himself. His last request is to be remembered as the one who saved the world. However this was not granted. Doom seemed reappeared in issue six of Ultimate Power, a crossover between the \\"Ultimate Universe\\" and the universe of the revamped Squadron Supreme, seemingly intent on taking over the Supremeverse. In issue eight, it is revealed to be simply a Doombot (the first seen in the Ultimate Marvel continuity). Dr. Doom is seemingly later seen in Ultimates 3 as the one controlling Ultron. It is noted however, that, starting in \\"Frightful\\" and through his Ultimate Power and Ultimates 3 appearances, his 'goat legs' are not present and he resembles his regular 616 counterpart. As to why his former look has been abandoned is yet to be revealed. The Thing supposedly killed Victor in his Latverian home as retribution for Doom's causing the events of Ultimatum; however' Doom later reveals that while in the zombie universe he had Sue and Johnny Storm's mother, Mary Storm, in disguise ruling in his absence. This was who The Thing unknowingly killed.Ultimate FF #5 The Ultimate version of Reed Richards, calling himself the Maker appears to for all intents and purposes have taken over the role of Doctor Doom ‚Äì right down to his facial scarring. This may have been done to show how similar the two really are. More recently, the Parliament of Doom (an organization constituted by numerous Doctor Dooms of alternative universes led by the Victor von Doom of Earth-616) fought the Fantastic Four in an alternative past of Earth-616, being one of the Doctor Dooms present very similar to Ultimate Doctor Doom, with features such as goat-hooved legs. It is yet unknown if that Doctor Doom is in fact from the Ultimate Universe or an alternative version of that reality. Following the events of Cataclysm, Phil Coulson and Danny Ketch reveal that the real Victor (who once again has his goat-hooved legs) was being held captive by S.H.I.E.L.D. before it disbanded. He is released and forced to join the Future Foundation alongside Invisible Woman, Falcon, and Tony Stark.Ultimate FF #1 When the time-displaced young X-Men are transferred into the Ultimate Marvel universe by accident, Doom captures and brainwashes the younger Beast to serve him, requiring the displaced X-Men to join forces with the new Ultimate Spider-Man and the Ultimate Marvel X-Men to rescue him. Later on, it is revealed that Doom has teamed up with Hydra to \\"save\\" the world from corrupt governments. He captures Miles Morales and Jessica Drew, hoping to exploit their DNA to create an army of super soldiers. The All-New Ultimates come to rescue him, but Miles escapes with a power he was not aware he had, defeating Doctor Doom and all of Hydra single-handedly, before the sky turns red and the image of another Earth appears in the sky.Miles Morales: Ultimate Spider-Man #12 Powers and abilities Ultimate Doom is a scientific genius, though unlike Richards he approaches science as an art rather than as a system. While the Fantastic Four's powers are compared to the four classical Greek elements, Doom has attained the power of one of the additional Chinese elements, metal - his body is almost completely solid metal, possessing no discrete internal organs, somewhat similar to Colossus (though Doom cannot switch back to a flesh-and-blood form). In his first post- transformation encounter with the Fantastic Four, he expelled the remains of his internal organs as a poisonous gas. He can grow and fling porcupine-like volleys of metal spikes from his forearms, and also possesses a regenerative power, but he cannot heal any wound caused by his own body. Thus, the scar Reed made on Doom's face remains, because it was done with one of his own spikes. Doom exhibits super strength as well, as he is able to break the arms off the zombie version of Ben Grimm.Ultimate Fantastic Four #30-31 The creature Doom summoned selected his body as the most powerful it could find, passing up Thor and Thing. The Ultimate Universe's Doom is also an accomplished sorcerer. Richards discovers that Johnny did not get the life form inside him from the Negative Zone. Rather, Victor \\"summoned\\" the creature inside Johnny. Later, Doom used sorcery to exchange minds with Richards. He proved powerful enough to fight with the Zombie Galacti and survive. Originally, in Ultimate Marvel Team-Up, Doom (visually identical to his normal Marvel self) was presented as President and \\"his holiness\\" of a theocratical Latveria. The country was said to be impoverished and starving, and Doom had declared a holy war (though without any open conflict) on the United States.Ultimate Marvel Team-Up #4Ultimate Marvel Team-Up #14 This would be ignored and retconned away in later Ultimate Marvel titles. =Warlock= On the original Counter Earth, Victor Von Doom is a genius, but not a villain. He appears in the original Warlock series. Von Doom's armor is now represented only by the metallic mask and the green hood/cape is gone. He is referred to as \\"the most famous egghead in the country\\",Warlock #5 the \\"like spirit- brother\\"Warlock #6 of Reed Richards, and \\"a man as dedicated to counter- Earth's survival as Earth's Von Doom is to its enslavement\\".Warlock #7 He and Reed Richards are mentioned in passing in Marvel Premiere #2 and Warlock #2 as scientists without any sort of super-powers. In Warlock #6, it is told how Von Doom and Richards had been roommates, friends and lab partners in college. After Von Doom's disfiguring accident, Richards' emotional support prevented him from becoming a villain. When Richards and his three companions hijacked a spaceship in order to be the first humans in space, Von Doom unsuccessfully attempted to talk him out of it. Though all of the counter \\"fantastic four\\" were exposed to cosmic radiation, it was only Richards that was affected due to the interference of Man-Beast though the effects only became apparent ten years later when he became the Brute due to \\"latent cosmic radiation - and a mysterious guiding hand\\". In Warlock #5-7, Victor Von Doom was employed at the Livermore Valley Lab in California where he worked on \\"Earth-Corer-1\\", a vehicle designed to tunnel into the Earth. He warned the president of a massive earthquake that would be caused by a nuclear bomb test. The resulting earthquake accidentally activated \\"Antipersonnel missiles, nicknamed deathbirds\\" which began killing people indiscriminately. Von Doom was able to destroy them with Adam Warlock's help, using one of his inventions called the \\"deactivator\\". He died while helping Adam Warlock stop the Brute from absorbing all of Counter-Earth's geothermal energy, turning him back into Reed Richards. =What If?= In What If Doctor Doom had become a Hero?, Victor heeds Reed Richards warnings that his machine to contact his mother is dangerous, and with Reed's help corrects the device's faults and learns of his mother's plight in Hell. As in the real world he seeks the hidden sect of monks, but now becomes a force for good known simply as Doom. He frees his mother from Hell, by magic and then liberates Latveria from Count Ruffalo, marrying his beloved Valeria shortly afterwards. However, the evil demon Mephisto, enraged at losing the soul of Doom's mother, traps the monarch's entire nation in a glass ball, saying he will free them if to replace his mother's soul, Doom chooses to give either Valeria's or his own. Doom agonises over this choice, but his ambition and pride are still stronger than his love and he chooses Valeria. Though still a force for good in the years to come, Doom spends each Midsummer's Eve (as he did for his mother's soul in the regular universe) battling demons in exchange for Valeria's soul.What If Vol 1 #22 In What If Doctor Doom Were Sorcerer Supreme? A young Victor Von Doom does not stay with the hidden sect of monks in the Himalayas but continues on to find the Ancient One. The Ancient One immediately sees Doom's vast potential and hopes that by taking him on as a student he can teach Doom humility and channel his talent away from evil. Doom's fellow student, Mordo, is threatened by Doom's vastly superior talent and plans to kill off the competition. Doom easily turns the table on Mordo and plants a small bomb in his skull as insurance against further treachery. The Ancient One fears that Doom is growing into a dangerous power and so decides to conclude their relationship by taking Doom to the Mephisto's realm to rescue Doom's mother. Later Doom dies and transfers his memories into Doctor Strange (in this universe he is only a surgeon).What If Vol 2 #52 In What if Doctor Doom had Become the Thing?, Recounting his college days, Doom again listens to Reed when he tells him of the flaw in his machine and becomes Reed's friend after this, but in this reality he is simply using Reed to further his own goals. During the construction of Reed's rocket, Doom notices the flaw in the shielding, but tells no-one, instead creating armor to protect himself. However, the armor actually absorbs and amplifies the cosmic rays, turning Doom into the Thing. Donning a cloth covering and the mask of his armor, he tries to kill Reed, believing him to be at fault. During the fight, Doom causes Ben Grimm (who never became Reed's test pilot and joined the army to assist in the Gamma Bomb Project, preventing Rick Jones from entering the test site) to be outside during the gamma bomb malfunctioning. The ensuing radiation exposure turns Ben into a hulk-like being who, calling himself \\"Grimm\\", beats back Doom, forcing him to flee.What If Doctor Doom Had Become the Thing? #1 In What If: Secret Wars, Doom is made aware of the Beyonder's survival by the Enchantress and kills him. He returns to Earth and defeats various threats to his power such as the Inhumans, Eternals and the remaining superheroes, with Tony Stark and Dr. Strange being the last opponents. He establishes a \\"paradise\\" on Earth by eliminating global warming, poverty, war and providing a device for unlimited energy. Next, he deals with cosmic threats and defeats the united forces of the Skrull, Kree, Shi'ar, Technarchy, Badoon and Brood. While in space, he obtains the Infinity Gems by defeating the Elders of the Universe. He uses them to release his mother's soul from Mephisto's captivity. Eventually, he comes in conflict with the Celestials, but defeats them after a 407-year-long battle. Earth has suffered from the conflict and Doom uses his remaining power to restore it. He rejoins humanity to aid and guide them to become a powerful force, introducing himself as simply \\"Victor\\" rather than Doom.What If: Secret Wars #1 In What If: Iron Man: Demon in an Armor, Tony Stark is Doom's college roommate rather than Reed Richards, inspiring Doom to develop a machine that allows him to transfer his mind into Stark's body while leaving Stark trapped in his body with no memory of his past. While Doom uses Stark's connections and company to establish himself, the amnesic Stark- believing himself to be Doom- works to rebuild his life, creating his own company and forming his own reputation from the ground up. This culminates in a confrontation between the two wearing early versions of their respective armours- Doom having developed a green-and-silver Iron Man armour while Stark has created Doom's costume with gold and a red cloak-, during which Doom reveals the truth about their switch, only for Stark to reject the offer to switch back because Doom has destroyed the name of Tony Stark while Doctor von Doom has developed an honourable reputation. =Earth-111= In this reality, visited by Ben Grimm while attempting to recover the coordinates of the Ultimate Nullifer, divided between the subconscious minds of four alternative Johnny Storms, Doom was the leader of the 'Challengers of Doom' consisting of himself, Reed Richard, Sue Storm, and the Hulk-, with Latveria having been destroyed in an unspecified past disaster and Doom relocating to New York to become a hero.Fantastic Four vol. 2 #47 When Galactus came to Earth and landed in Russia, Doom dismissed it as a hoax, prompting Grimm to note that this Doom was more arrogant than the version he knew as the Doom of Earth-616 was at least willing to listen to even his enemies if the situation was serious enough rather than dismiss their views as automatically irrelevant.Fantastic Four vol. 2 #48 =Earth-1191= Unlike most Dooms this version is portrayed as an old, senile man with delusions of retaining his old authority and physique- seen by Layla Miller as a natural 'evolution' of Doom's inability to accept that he might be the reason for his failures-, although with periods of lucidity in which, while physically decrepit, he is still as smart and devious (and in turn, dangerous) as ever. Currently he's been taken in by Layla Miller and Madrox who hope that he can aid them in traveling back to their present.X-Factor #47 After finding and reactivating a time machine provided by the future X-Men, Doom, while in another lucid moment, betrays them, ordering the time travelling \\"Cortex\\" to use his abilities to \\"Destroy all the mutants\\".X-Factor #49 Doom also is able to take control of the heavily cyberized Cyclops though his cybernetic implants, forcing Cyclops' daughter Ruby to take him down. After this battle, Doom vanishes.X-Factor #50 =Original Guardians of the Galaxy/Earth-691= In the alternate 31st century of the original Guardians of the Galaxy, designated as Earth-691, Doom is revealed to have somehow managed to place his brain inside the adamantium skeleton of Wolverine at some unknown point in the past, hiding this fact with a perfect replica of his original armor, cloak, hood, and simulated flesh intended to give the appearance that he has managed to prolong his life to unnatural lengths. He eventually comes face to face with Rancor, a descendant of Wolverine, and offers to become her ally, though he secretly intended to use her as a pawn for his own gain, while she intends to slay him on her quest to determine what happened to Wolverine. During their battle, Doom reveals himself to be in control of Wolverine's skeleton, heavily modified with cybernetics and missing half of one of the claws, which had eventually come into the possession of Rancor. Rancor manages to strike at one of Doom's robotic eyes, forcing him to retreat. Doom is not seen again in this reality. = Identity Wars = When Deadpool, Spider-Man and Hulk went to another universe, Deadpool found Death wish who looked like Deadpool but the red part of his costume were green. Deadpool and Death wish started hanging out with each other and having a lot of fun, until Wade Wilson of this universe named Death mask came in and killed Death Wish who was revealed to be the Victor von Doom of this universe went crazy. Then Deadpool vowed revenge against Death Mask for killing Death Wish and killed all of the members of Death Mask's group. After that Deadpool defeated Death Mask by throwing a bomb at him, which knocked him out. Deadpool started impersonating Death Mask until him and the other Heroes went back to their universe.Incredible Hulk Annual #1 = Marvel Two-In-One (2017) / Earth-TRN667 = When the Thing and the Human Torch search the multiverse for the missing Richards' family, their first new universe visited is a world where the Thing died in the Fantastic Four's first battle with Galactus. This universe's Doctor Doom saved Earth by transferring his mind into Galactus, with the result that Earth has been spared but Doom's hunger for power has led him to devour every other planet in the universe. With the help of Earth-TRN667 Reed Richards and Emma Frost, they are able to defeat him by transferring his mind into Emma Frost's body, while she becomes the Life Bringer.Marvel Two-In-One #5-6 = Venomverse = In Venomverse, Doom was consumed by the Poisons and became their second in command after Poison Thanos.

The division was formed on March 24, 1915, and organized over the next few weeks.11\\\\. Bayerische Infanterie-Division (Chronik 1915/1918) It was part of a wave of new infantry divisions formed in the spring of 1915. The division was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I. The division was formed primarily from the excess infantry regiments of existing divisions that were being triangularized. The division's 21st Bavarian Infantry Brigade was formerly the 4th Bavarian Infantry Brigade of the 2nd Bavarian Infantry Division. The 3rd Bavarian Infantry Regiment also came from the 2nd Bavarian Infantry Division; the 22nd Bavarian Infantry Regiment came from the 3rd Bavarian Infantry Division; and the 13th Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment came from the 5th Bavarian Reserve Division. Combat chronicle The 11th Bavarian Infantry Division initially served on the Eastern Front, where it fought in the Gorlice-Tarn√≥w Offensive, seeing action at Przemy≈õl, Lemberg, and Che≈Çm (Cholm) and advancing to the western edge of Pripyat Marshes by August. The division was then transferred south and participated in the Serbian Campaign. It was in reserve in Syrmia from November 1915 to February 1916, and was then transferred to the Western Front. From March to May 1916, it fought in the Battle of Verdun, and then returned to the Eastern Front to help stop the Brusilov Offensive. After fighting in the Battle of Kovel, the division went to the Romanian front, where it remained until January 1917. Again it was transferred to the Western Front, initially serving in Upper Alsace. It then fought in the Second Battle of the Aisne, also known as the Third Battle of Champagne (and to the Germans as the Double Battle on the Aisne and in Champagne). It also saw action in the Battle of Passchendaele. It remained in the line on various parts of the Western Front until the end of April 1918, when it went to the Belgian/Dutch border. The division then fought in the Third Battle of the Aisne and remained in the line near Soissons, seeing action in the Second Battle of the Marne. It then went to Flanders, where it remained until the end of the war. Allied intelligence rated the division as first class.Histories of Two Hundred and Fifty-One Divisions of the German Army which Participated in the War (1914-1918), compiled from records of Intelligence section of the General Staff, American Expeditionary Forces, at General Headquarters, Chaumont, France 1919 (1920), pp. 206-210.

Early life Warren was born in New York City on January 29, 1864. He was one of nine children born to George Henry Warren I (1823‚Äì1892) and Mary Caroline (n√©e Phoenix) Warren (1832‚Äì1901). His siblings included Lloyd Warren, who was also an architect, and George Henry Warren II, a stockbroker who was the father of Constance Whitney Warren. He was a cousin of the Goelets and Vanderbilts and the grandson of U.S. Representative Jonas Phillips Phoenix. In 1883, he enrolled at Columbia University to study architecture, but only stayed for one year. He was shown on official Columbia University records as a member of the class of 1885 of the School of Mines, Columbia University. From 1884 until 1894, Warren spent ten years at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. There he studied under Honor√© Daumet and Charles Girault, and met fellow architecture student Emmanuel Louis Masqueray, who would, in 1897, join the Warren and Wetmore firm. Career Catholic University of Leuven Library designed by Warren and built from 1921‚Äì1928. Warren returned to New York in 1894, and began practicing as an architect. One of his first clients was the lawyer Charles Delevan Wetmore. After their successful collaboration, Warren convinced Wetmore to become his partner and they organized Warren and Wetmore with Warren as the architect and Wetmore responsible for the business side of the firm. During World War I, Warren was involved in organizing the Comit√© des √âtudiants Am√©ricains de l'√âcole des Beaux-Arts Paris; a student-run charity in support of the French cause. He also supported actively the claims of Italy in the Adriatic, during and after the war. He was an intimate friend of Gabriele d'Annunzio, and was appointed diplomatic representative in the United States of the \\"Free State of Fiume\\". He was the author of Les Justes Revendications de l'Italie: la Question de Trente, de Trieste et de l'Adriatique. Many of his addresses, delivered 1914-1919, were published and widely distributed. Warren retired in 1931, but occasionally served as consultant. Warren took particular pride in his design of the new library building of the Catholic University of Leuven, which was finished in 1928. The library was severely damaged by British and German forces during World War II, but was completely restored after the war. Two of the firm's major works were the construction of Grand Central Terminal and of the Biltmore Hotel, both in New York City. Personal life In 1884, Warren was married to Charlotte Augusta Tooker (1864‚Äì1951) in Newport, Rhode Island. Charlotte was the eldest daughter of Gabriel Mead Tooker, a prominent New York lawyer and member of Mrs. Astor's famous Four Hundred. Together, they are the parents of: * Charlotte Augusta Warren (1885‚Äì1957), who married William Greenough in 1907. * Gabrielle Warren (1895‚Äì1971), who married Reginald Bulkeley Rives (1890‚Äì1957), a nephew of George Rives and Edward Bulkeley, in 1917. * Whitney Warren Jr. (1898‚Äì1986), who was a horticulturalist and patron of the arts. Warren Jr. was referred to as \\"an overly rich bachelor operating in San Francisco\\" who traveled around the world. In 1927, Warren and his brother George each inherited $2,314,143 from the estate of their uncle, Lloyd Phoenix. Warren died after a nine-week illness on January 24, 1943 at New York Hospital in New York City. At the time of his death, Warren resided at 280 Park Avenue in New York City and was a member of the Knickerbocker Club, the Racquet and Tennis Club, and the Church and South Side Sportsmen's Clubs. After a service at St. Thomas Church, Fifth Avenue, he was buried at Island Cemetery in Newport. His widow died in 1951 and was buried alongside him in Newport. =Legacy= In 1917, Warren received the Medal of Honor from the American Institute of Architects for the firm's work.

Previously he served in the Nevada Assembly from 1994 through 2001. Nolan served as minority whip in the assembly, and in 2001 and 2003 was elected to be the assistant majority leader of the Nevada Senate. During his tenure in the senate, Nolan focused on issues such as healthcare, transportation, \\"reasonable property taxation,\\" child and victim protection, workers compensation, public safety, and homeland security. In addition to his leadership roles with the Nevada Legislature, Nolan held leadership positions in two national legislative organizations; the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) and the National Conference of State Legislators (NCSL). ALEC awarded him with its national legislator of the year award in 2008. In 2010, Nolan lost his re-election bid, losing in the primaries to Elizabeth Halseth. Las Vegas Review-Journal \\"Democrats Given High Marks\\" 6/13/2011 The campaign against Nolan focused on a May 2010 incident in which Nolan was caught on tape offering to make it \\"very financially beneficial\\" if Jaime Anderson Lawes \\"told the truth\\" regarding a 2008 rape case involving her ex-husband, Gordon Lawes, he 20 and her sister, who was 16 years old at the time. The age of sexual consent in Nevada is 16. Gordon Lawes who contended the sex was wrong however consensual, was eventually convicted and sentenced to at least 10 years in prison. Senator Nolan himself was subpoenaed by the public defender and testified as a character witness, and it was revealed that both had played for the same hockey team. Nolan had defended his actions, saying that his political opponents focused on one message, while the other two messages \\"were of me imploring this woman\\" to voluntarily come forward and tell the truth. A legal opinion by the Nevada Legislative Counsel Bureau and review by the Nevada Ethics Commission determined Nolan violated no laws or ethics standards by his actions. Nolan knew both Jaime Anderson and her sister through Lawes and indicated that he was convinced the sex was consensual and both women were lying. Nolan added, \\"I realize my tactics in this case were somewhat unorthodox, but I never have really cared to be politically correct...what he did was wrong in every sense of the word but not illegal.\\" The Nevada Supreme Court ultimately reversed Lawes conviction citing several procedural errors by the prosecution and court in obtaining the conviction.

She sends Steve downstairs to mail her insurance premium having sprained her foot. He runs into his old girlfriend Isobel Kimble Grayson (Gail Patrick) and learns that she has just moved into the apartment building, one floor below. On the way up, the elevator gets stuck. While they are getting out, Steve is half-strangled and struck several times in the head becoming woozy. Isobel takes him to her apartment to recover where she plies him with numerous strong drinks. Though she is now also married, she makes it clear that she would not mind renewing their relationship, but Steve is hopelessly in love with his wife. When he returns to his apartment in a disheveled state, he neglects to mention his encounter with Isobel but then it becomes evident in a way which looks bad for him; later, while Susan is running an errand for her mother across town, Steve skips out from the dull chore of minding Mrs. Cooper on a pretext to meet Isobel and chew the fat. However Mrs. Cooper finds out and tells her daughter, putting Steve in an awkward spot. Now jealous, for revenge, Susan calls Isobel's husband 'Pinky' (Donald MacBride) and suggests that they pretend that they are seeing each other. He agrees, but Susan goes to the wrong apartment, that of world champion archer Ward Willoughby (Jack Carson). He is puzzled but has no objection to being romanced by a beautiful woman. When Susan learns her mistake, she has difficulty extricating herself from Willoughby's apartment. They are seen by Steve and Isobel, resulting in much confusion. Things are finally cleared up, but then Susan is led to believe that Steve was alone with Isobel in her apartment for three hours while she was out. Susan decides to get a divorce, despite Steve's pleas. She hides in Arizona with her meddling mother. Willoughby follows, to better his acquaintance with Susan. The night before the divorce hearing, Steve's lawyer, George Renny (Sidney Blackmer), spots Susan at a party and tells his client. Steve crashes the gathering but is unable to change Susan's mind. A chance remark by Steve gives Renny an idea ‚Äì a divorce can be delayed if one of the parties is insane. Steve does his best to act nutty, even pushing his mother-in-law into the pool. However, he had been so eccentric in the past, that everyone (with the exception of one stranger, an older man, who he refers to as 'General Electric Whiskers') just believes he is drunk. Nonetheless, Renny gets the divorce judge to agree to a thirty-day delay to have Steve examined by the City Lunacy Commission. When he realizes that he has gone too far, Steve tries to convince the members that he is sane; but the head of the board, Dr. Klugle (Vladimir Sokoloff), turns out to be the one person Steve hoodwinked at the party. As a result, he is committed to a sanitarium. Steve escapes by tricking the head of the rest home, Dr. Wuthering (Sig Ruman). He returns to his apartment building one step ahead of the police, who now consider him a homicidal maniac. Steve dodges Willoughby and hides with Isobel's help. He then disguises himself as his \\"sister\\" by putting on some clothes from Isobel's apartment and shaving his mustache. He finally reaches Susan, only to have Mrs. Cooper and Willoughby show up soon afterwards. When Mrs. Cooper inadvertently confirms Steve left the apartment building to just talk to Isobel at a bar down the street on the night of their anniversary, Susan finally believes her husband and decides to bunk-in with the \\"sister\\" and take \\"her\\" to Saskatchewan in the morning.

Frash√´ri, using Dine's connection to the Legaliteti, requested that Kupi join the government. Kupi agreed after the Albanian partisans began attacking Kupi's territory. However, the Germans refused to accept Dine and Mehdi Frash√´ri's proposed cabinet or Frash√´ri's choice to succeed Fuat Dibra, who died in February, as Regent. Dine and Frasheri proposed that a Gheg coalition should be formed. The plan was to coordinate Ballist and Zogist strength and, in cooperation with the Germans, drive back the Communists. At the same time, they hoped to convince the Allies that they were acting on behalf of an independent Albania and therefore deserved, if not direct Allied support, at least a respite from active Allied resistance. Initial military operations against the partisans were seemingly quite successful. Germans and Zogist forces, without directly cooperating, managed to drive the partisans from Mati at the end of July. Mehmet Shehu forces that controlled Debar, forced the partisans to retreat for the time being. However, the Allied forces began dropping supplies to partisan territory and helping them rebuild a new offensive. The Ballist-Zogist gamble had failed. A series of ominous international events during the last days of August made it abundantly clear to even the most pro-German Albanians that the German occupation of Albania would soon end. The German elite within Albania grew wary of Dine and Frasheri. Martin Schliep and Josef Fitzthum where enraged after discovering Dine's contact with the Allies, replaced him with Ibrahim Bi√ßak√ßiu on 29 August 1944.

Biography =Early life= Born in 1905, Ibrahim Bi√ßak√ßiu was the son of Aqif Pasha Bi√ßak√ßiu of Elbasan. His family helped in the Independence of Albania and it was through his family's influence that he grew up with the same ideology and beliefs. =World War II= In 1943, together with Bedri bey Pejani and Xhafer Deva, he helped found a national committee of twenty-two Albanian and Kosovo Albanian leaders, which declared Albania independent from fascist occupation and which elected an executive committee to form a provisional government. =Prime minister= Following a week of negotiations, Ibrahim Bi√ßaku agreed to lead a new and small government after Fiqiri Dine. Although Bi√ßaku was the perfect friend of Germany, his reign was nevertheless quite incompetent. This was mainly because Germany was on the brink of defeat and the Albanian partisans were moving out, ready to strike. Tirana paper noted that he had headed the provisional executive committee exactly one year earlier, prior to the construction of the Mitrovica government. Bi√ßaku had become, once again, the front man for the Germans. It was noted that Bi√ßaku would occasionally play Ping-Pong with Ambassador Schliep (de). =After the war= Despite many of the Ballists fleeing Albania after the Communists announced their victory, Bi√ßak√ßiu, like Father Anton Harapi and Cafo Beg Ulqini, chose not to leave and decided that he would rather die in his country of birth than on foreign soil. He was arrested by communist forces in Shkodra on 6 December 1944 and was sentenced to life in prison at the Special Court in Tirana on 13 April 1945. He spent most of his years in prison in Burrel and was released on 5 May 1962 in Elbasan. In his last years he was given a job as a public restrooms cleaner in his city of Elbasan.

He served as Prime Minister of Albania during the Italian occupation from December 4, 1941 to January 19, 1943. Early life He was born Mustafa Asim Merlika, son of Mehmed. His family was Bektashi. His father was a local administrator of the lands of Essad Pasha, who from his side sponsored the education of Mustafa. According to Albanian sources he studied at the local R√º≈ütiye, then in Yannina, before going to the today's Faculty of Political Science, Ankara University (\\"Mekteb-i M√ºlkiye\\") which he finished in 1910. According to Turkish author √áankaya, he studied at the local school in Elbasan, then in Mercan idadisi in Istambul before entering the M√ºlkiye. There he learned Turkish and French. Ottoman and Albanian politics (1910‚Äì1924) As a student in the Ottoman capital he joined the Revolutionary League (\\"Cemiyet-i ƒ∞nkƒ±labiye\\") against the autocracy of Sultan Abdul Hamid II. After the Young Turk Revolution he worked for supporting the Albanian language at the M√ºlkiye, and posted articles in the liberal press against the Committee of Union and Progress using the signature \\"Asim Cenan\\". Contrary to what Essad Pasha had in mind for him, instead of becoming Kaymakam he preferred a career in education. In 1910 he was appointed secretary of the administration, in the Ministry of Public Education in Istanbul. A year later he was appointed director of the Public Education for the Sanjak of Elbasan, Manastir Vilayet. After participating as a volunteer in Ottoman army during the Italo-Turkish War in 1912, he joined the Albanian Independence movement. Merlika-Kruja participated in the Assembly of Vlor√´ of 28 November 1912, and his name appears in the list of signatories of the Independence Act. In 1913 he joined the Ministry of Education and in 1914 became an adviser of the Ministry of Public Education. In 1918 he participated in the Congress of Durr√´s, favored an Italian protectorate over Albania, and was elected Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. According to Sejfi Vllamasi's (1883‚Äì1975) memories, there Kruja would be the main opponent of the Congress of Lushnj√´ event together with Fejzi Alizoti, Myfit Libohova, and Sami Vrioni. These include the assassination of the Prefect of Durr√´s (and delegate to Lushnj√´) Abdyl Ypi (1876-1920) by Sul M√´rlika, himself cousin of Kruja, the prohibition of Kruj√´ delegates to join the congress, the attempts to stop the delegates of Committee for the National Defence of Kosovo, as well as failed attempts of Fejzi Alizoti and Myfid Libohova to stop other delegates from north and south of the country even involving Italian militia. In 1921 he was elected to the Albanian parliament where he belonged to a progressive trend, openly opposing Ahmet Zogu's clan, and close with connections to the Committee for the National Defence of Kosovo which would be officially banned by Zogu later. In 1922, he was involved in a coup d'√©tat attempt against the government of Xhafer Ypi together with the north-east Dibra clan of Cen Elezi and Elez Isufi, and had to temporarily flee from Albania to Yugoslavia. He was placed in an internment camp there. Kruja asked permission to visit Vienna for personal reasons and was granted temporary pass-out. He did not return to Yugoslavia, breaking his agreement and placing himself in the \\"black list\\" of the Yugoslav authorities. In 1924 he was appointed prefect by Noli's government. Exile As an active participant of the June Revolution in 1924, he had to flee the country and moved to Zadar, Vienna, and later settled in Switzerland. There he joined the KONARE (\\"Revolutionary National Committee\\") established by Noli. During these exile years, Kruja would be pro-Italian and prominent Zog opponent, keeping also ties with the \\"Bashkimi Komb√´tar\\" (\\"National Union\\") organization and other exile personalities as Hasan Prishtina, Sejfi Vllamasi, Ali Klissura, Qazim Mulleti, Aziz √áami, Rexhep Mitrovica, etc. World War II On August 4, 1939, after the personal union of Albania to the crown of Italy, Merlika-Kruja was appointed as a Senator within the Italian Kingdom until August 25, 1944, when he resigned. During his tenure he was a member of the Foreign Affairs, Trade and Customs legislature. He is remembered for the public speech held on December 24, 1942, in response of the Anthony Eden's statement in accordance with the communique of the Greek government in London (in exile) which stated that Britain and US would not recognize any border changes established by the Fascists, and that neighboring countries would have the right to claim parts of Albania at the end of the war. Following the Axis occupation of Yugoslavia (in which Kosovo was occupied by Albania), the Albanian authorities under Mustafa Kruja forcibly expelled 70‚Äì100,000 Serb ethnics. Fascist Italy colonized Kosovo and Macedonia with 70,000 Albanians, who carried out religious persecution in the form of damaging and confascating churches and monasteries, and exilement and murder of Orthodox priests. In June 1942, he held a public speech in which he said that Serbs would be sent to concentration camps or killed., : In the spring of 1944 he escaped by boat from Albania to Italy and from there to Egypt. There he met an old rival of his, the Albanian King Ahmed Zogu. After World War II he lived in France. During the last exile period he would join the political organization in exile created by Dr. Ismail Verlaci, Kapidan Gjon Markagjoni and Ndue Gjon Marku of which Albanian publicist and writer Ernest Koliqi (1903‚Äì1975) was a member. This organization was named \\"Independent National Bloc\\" and was formed on 6 November 1946, in Rome. The last years of his life were spent in the United States where he died in a hospital in Niagara Falls, New York. Work During his life, Kruja would write articles to many Albanian journal within and outside Albania, including Il Corriere delle Puglie (1914), Albanian newspaper of Rome Kuvendi (\\"The Assembly\\") (1918), and Mbrojtja Komb√´tare (\\"The national defense\\") published in Vlora between 1920 and 1923. Since after World War I he worked on a voluminous dictionary of Albanian language. He continued with intellectual studies till the end of life, some of them published in periodicals and books, and some of them being published lately by his descendant after the fall of communism in Albania.

However, there is a controversy about the possible location of Sravasti.Majumdar, Dr. R.C., p. 429 Early history The Karatoya, known as Phuljhur rises in the Baikunthapur jungles in the extreme north-west of Jalpaiguri district (West Bengal, India) and forms for some distance the boundary between Dinajpur and Rangpur districts. It, then, meanders through Rangpur and Bogura. In the south of Bogura district, it receives the Halhalia and the united stream is then known as Phuljhur. It leaves Bogura at Chanda kona and flowing in a southerly direction past Raiganj and Shujapur is joined by the Ichhamati at Nalka. The Phuljhur then flows south past the important village of Ullapara, a few miles below which it joins the Hurasagar at Narnia after a course of about in this district. After this junction, it takes the name of Hurasagar and passing close by Shazadpur and Hera joins the Jamuna near Bera. The Karatoya is mentioned in the Puranas and had a high repute for sanctity. It was the eastern boundary of the old kingdom of Paundravardhana, the country of the Paundras which it separated from Kamrupa. It is shown in Van Den Brouk's map of Bengal (C, 1660) as flowing into the Ganges and in fact. before the destructive floods of 1787 it brought down to the Atrai and to the Ganges a great volume of Teesta water. Since the main stream of the Teesta was diverted to the east in 1787, the Karatoya and the Phuljhur have gradually silted up. and they are at the present day rivers of minor importance. One channel, which joins the Baral, east of Pabna. is still called indifferently the Buri Teesta or old Teesta and the Karto or Karatoya. Traces of an old channel, for which the name of the Karatoya is claimed, are also pointed out in the Chatmohar thana, where it appears to have been obliterated by the Baral. Etymology The name of the river is formed of two Sanskrit words kar (hand) and toa (water), signifying, in Hindu mythology, that the river was formed by the water which was poured on the hands of Shiva, when he married Parvati. Changes in the course of rivers Dr. M A Wazed Miah bridge over Karatoya river in Kanchdaha, Rangpur. Great changes have taken place in the course of some of the rivers in Bengal and the adjoining areas, during the period since 1500 AD. Although positive evidence is lacking, similar changes can be assumed in the remoter past. The Karatoya is one of the rivers that has changed over the years. The map (right) shows the main rivers in North Bengal and adjoining areas. Not shown are numerous tributaries and distributaries, which connect the main rivers, and allow the main rivers to change course. Therefore, the river-system pattern undergoes continuous changes. Such changes have not been reflected in the map. Moreover, many of the rivers have local names for sections of the course, adding to the complexity of the river system. Tectonic disturbances have broken up the Karatoya into four distinct parts. The northern part, called the Dinajpur-Karatoya, is the main source of the Atrai. It rises in a marsh in Baikanthapur in Jalpaiguri district, but also receives water from underground streams. In Khansama upazila its name changes to Atrai. Near Birpur Upazila, Bangladesh (25¬∞54'02.0\\"N 88¬∞43'32.6\\"E) its divided into Dhepa River and Atrai River. In a second section, the Dinajpur-Karatoya was connected with the Rangpur-Karatoya north of Khansama, but very little water now passes down that channel. The upper part of Rangpur-Karatoya originates in the Jalpaiguri district and is known as the Deonai-Jamuneshwari up to Gobindaganj upazila. In a third section, the Jamuneshwari-Karatoya flows south-southeast to Gobindaganj upazila, where the main stream turns east through the Katakhali and falls into the Bangali River. The portion of the former river passing through Shibganj upazila is dry most of the year. It effectively separates the Rangpur-Karatoya from the Bogra-Karatoya, which flows south past Bogra town till it joins the Bangali to make Phuljhor river, which falls into the Hoorasagar. The fourth part, the Pabna-Karatoya, is a moribund river bed near Handial. Various other channels are also pointed out as parts of the Old Karatoya. =Teesta= Van den Brouck's map Rennel's map The Teesta earlier ran due south from Jalpaiguri in three channels, namely, the Karatoya to the east, the Punarbhaba in the west and the Atrai in the centre. The three channels possibly gave the name to the river as Trisrota (possessed of three streams) which has been shortened and corrupted to Teesta. Of these three the Punarbhaba joined the Mahananda. The Atrai passing through a vast marshy area known as Chalan Beel joined the Karatoya and the united stream joined the Padma near Jafarganj. In the destructive floods of 1787, the Teesta forsook its old channel and rushing south-east it joined the Brahmaputra. In the Siyar-al-Mutakhkhirin it is recorded that the Karatoya was three times the size of the Ganges when Bakhtiyar Khilji invaded the northern parts of Bengal in 1115. In Ven den Brouck's map of Bengal, prepared in 1660, the Karatoya is shown as a large channel. Rennel made a survey between 1764 and 1777 and his maps are one of the earliest authentic maps of Bengal in existence. In these maps Teesta is shown as flowing through North Bengal in several branches--Punarbhaba, Atrai, Karatoya etc. All these streams combined lower down with the Mahananda, now the westernmost river in North Bengal, and taking the name of Hoorsagar finally discharged into the Ganges at Jafarganj, near modern Goalundo. The Hoorsagar river is still in existence being the combined outfall of the Baral, a spill channel of the Ganges, the Atrai, the Jamuna or Jamuneswari (not the main Jamuna through which the Brahmaputra now flows), and the Karatoya, but instead of falling into the Ganges, it falls into the main Jamuna, a few miles above its confluence with the Padma at Goalundo.Majumdar, S.C., Chief Engineer, Bengal, Rivers of the Bengal Delta, Government of Bengal, 1941, reproduced in Rivers of Bengal, Vol I, 2001, p. 45, published by Education department, Government of West Bengal. =Kosi= The Kosi (Kausiki), which now flows through the north-eastern Bihar and joins the Ganges at a point much higher up than Rajmahal, originally ran eastward and fell into the Brahmaputra. The channel of the Kosi, therefore, must have been steadily shifting towards the west, right across the whole breadth of North Bengal. There was a time when the Kosi and the Mahananda joined the Karatoya and formed a sort of ethnic boundary between people living south of it and the Kochs and Kiratas living north of the river.

It was first published in October 1962 in Galaxy Magazine, and since reprinted in several compilations and omnibus editions. The main characters are Jestocost, a lord of the Instrumentality of Mankind and C'mell, a beautiful cat-derived \\"underperson\\" (an animal given human speech and form but no rights, while retaining some of its inherent genetics -- for example, C'mell's father held the long-jump record at the time) who works as a \\"girly- girl\\" (similar to an escort) at the main spaceport. Plot summary The story revolves around Jestocost's ambition to help the oppressed underpeople gain rights without upsetting the established social order. While debating how to make contact, Jestocost telepathically accesses C'mell's thoughts during the funeral of her athlete father, and overhears her call for help to someone named E-telly-kelly. After awkwardly questioning her later (which she at first mistakes for a crude pass), he is permitted to make contact with the E'telekeli, an eagle-derived underperson unknown to the Instrumentality with immense telepathic powers, who may be the leader of the underpeople. Jestocost and the E'telekeli agree to a scheme in which C'mell will pretend to be a witness to illegal smuggling. When this case is brought before the assembled Lords of the Instrumentality C'mell provides manufactured evidence which causes the Instrumentality's computer system, the Bank, to display probable smuggling routes and hideouts on the Bell, the Bank's three-dimensional display system. While this is going on, C'mell remains surreptitiously in physical contact with Jestocost. This allows him to telepathically relay the images on the Bell to the E'telekeli. The images appear too quickly for a normal human mind to interpret, but the E'telekeli is able to do so. Since C'mell's \\"evidence\\" proves worthless the Lords dismiss her angrily, but the information stolen from the Bank and Bell provides the underpeople with details about the main human checkpoints and a list of safe havens where they can hide from the Instrumentality while seeking rights. Their plan has required C'mell and Jestocost to work closely together, and C'mell (working for the first time with a human who respects her intelligence) has fallen in love with Jestocost, but he has suppressed his own feelings as a distraction, and they separate when the plan succeeds. They only meet again once, many years later when the underpeople are well on their way to achieving their rights. Their discussion is friendly, but C'mell is privately saddened by Jestocost's lack of romantic feeling toward her. Ultimately, during Jestocost's life, underpeople achieve a lower-grade citizenship, for which their efforts were partly responsible. The story of Jestocost and C'mell never becomes public, but a folk song among the underpeople entitled \\"The Ballad of Lost C'mell\\" tells a poetic and partial version of the events. On his deathbed, many years after C'mell has died of old age, Jestocost has a brief telepathic conversation, apparently with the E'telekeli's successor, in which he learns that she never loved anyone but him. The telepathic underperson assures Jestocost that his name will be linked with C'mell's forever in history and folklore. Connections to other works Smith's novel Norstrilia is partly a sequel to this story (it is set a few years after the main part of the story, includes all of the main characters, and is concerned with some of the same issues). C'mell also appears in Smith's story \\"Alpha Ralpha Boulevard\\", which takes place earlier in terms of chronology and order of publication.Review of We The Underpeople collection C'mell's adventures take place during the early years of the Rediscovery of Man. According to J. J. Pierce's conjectural timeline of the Instrumentality (included in We, the Underpeople and other collections of Smith's stories) this seems to be some time between AD 15,000 and 16,000. \\"The Ballad of Lost C'Mell\\" was included in The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume Two, a collection of the 22 greatest science fiction novellas published before the introduction of the Nebula Awards in 1965, as selected by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America. Note: The M of C'mell is often capitalized in the title of the story (as in this article) but in the text it is uncapitalized. The name \\"C'mell\\" is derived from that of Smith's (real name Paul Linebarger) pet cat, Melanie. The title was not the one that Smith originally gave the story, but was derived from the text by Galaxy magazine's then-editor Frederik Pohl. This was one of a number of Smith's story-titles that Pohl changed for publication because he disliked the originals. Pohl's replacement titles are all derived from the texts of the stories in order to retain the character of Smith's writing.

Locals have an important role to build the union, protect and improve terms and conditions of employment of the membership and protect individual rights. Each local elects a president, at least one vice president, a secretary and a treasurer. The Local president is ultimately responsible for everything that goes on in that local. In CSEA's State and Private Sector Divisions, locals assist individual members with grievances, notices of discipline, collective bargaining and so forth. In CSEA's Local Government Division these activities are often conducted at the Unit level. Units are subdivisions of the locals of which they are a member, and have the same basic structure as locals; a president, one or more vice presidents, a secretary and a treasurer. The Unit president is ultimately responsible for everything which transpires in the unit, and is directly responsible to the local. The unit has the same basic responsibilities as the local: to build the union, to protect and improve the terms and conditions of employment of its membership and to protect the rights of individual unit members. In practice, this means that the unit negotiates and polices the collective bargaining agreement, assists members who have possible contract grievances or who have received notices of discipline, and communicates both with its own membership and with the local of which it is a member.

It has been inscribed into the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites since December 14, 2001, and is one of the anchor points of the European Route of Industrial Heritage. The first coal mine on the premises was founded in 1847, and mining activities took place from 1851 until December 23, 1986. For decades, starting in the late 1950s, the two parts of the site, Zollverein Coal Mine and Zollverein Coking Plant (erected 1957‚àí1961, closed on June 30, 1993), ranked among the largest of their kinds in Europe. Shaft 12, built in the New Objectivity style, was opened in 1932 and is considered an architectural and technical masterpiece, earning it a reputation as the \\"most beautiful coal mine in the world\\". History =1847‚Äì1890= Zollverein Coal Mine was founded by Duisburg-born industrialist Franz Haniel (1779‚Äì1868), who needed coke for steel production. Test drilling in the Katernberg region had revealed a very rich seam of coal. In 1847, Haniel founded a company he named bergrechtliche Gewerkschaft Zollverein (Mining Law Labor Union Zollverein). There was a mining law (Bergrecht) in Prussia to encourage the exploitation of natural resources. The law called for the creation of a special form of corporation, designated a 'labour union' (Gewerkschaft) but in fact a capitalist company. Haniel named his after the German Customs Union (Zollverein), established in 1834. Haniel distributed the shares of the new company amongst the members of his family and the owner of the land on which the future mine would be constructed. The sinking of Shaft 1 began on February 18, 1847, with the first coal layer being reached at a depth of 130 meters. The first mining activities started in 1851. Shaft 2, which was sunk at the same time as Shaft 1, was opened in 1852. Both shafts featured visually identical stone towers and shared a machine house. This concept was to be adapted by many later twin-shaft coal mines. Starting in 1857, charcoal piles were used to produce coke. In 1866, these piles were replaced by a modern cokery and machine ovens. In 1880, the sinking of another shaft, Shaft 3, began in neighboring Schonnebeck. It had a steel framework to support its winding tower and was opened in 1883. By 1890, the three shafts had already achieved an output of one million tons, making Zollverein the most productive of all German mines. =1890‚Äì1918= Since the coal, iron and steel industries of the Ruhr area flourished in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the mine was extended significantly. Between 1891 and 1896, the twin Shafts 4 and 5 were built on the edge of He√üler (nowadays a suburb of Gelsenkirchen). These each had special lifts for extraction of coal, and the transportation of miners, and had ventilation ducts. Another shaft, number 6, was opened in 1897. By 1897, Zollverein had long suffered from many mining accidents due to firedamp caused by ventilation problems. To resolve these problems, additional ventilation-only shafts, close to the existing mining shafts, were opened: in 1899 Shaft 7 was opened near Shaft 3, in 1900 Shaft 8 was opened near Shafts 1 and 2, and in 1905 Shaft 9 was opened near Shaft 6. Years of continuous renovation and further expansion followed. After the construction of ventilation shafts 7, 8, and 9, the old Shafts 1 and 2, and their cokery, were renovated, and one of their twin towers was taken down and replaced by a modern steel framework. In 1914, Shaft 10 and a new cokery were opened, and Shaft 9 was converted from a ventilation shaft to a working shaft. By the eve of the First World War, Zollverein's output had risen to approximately 2.5 million tons per year. =1918‚Äì1932= In 1920, the Haniel family, who had been the owners of Zollverein until then, started cooperating with Ph√∂nix AG, a mining company that subsequently took over the management of the site. Under Ph√∂nix's management, several of the shafts were again modernized, and an eleventh shaft was opened by 1927. When Ph√∂nix merged into Vereinigte Stahlwerke in 1926, Zollverein came under control of Gelsenkirchener Bergwerks-AG (GBAG) which started closing most of the now elderly coking plants. =Shaft 12= Former boiler house of Shaft 12 in the typical Bauhaus style with red steel trusses. Today it houses the Red Dot Design Museum. Zollverein, 1949 In 1928, the GBAG voted for the construction of a totally new twelfth shaft designed as a central mining facility. When in the shaft opened in 1932, it had a daily output of up to 12,000 tons, combining the output of the four other existing facilities with 11 shafts. Schacht Albert V√∂gler, as the highly modern shaft was named after the director general of the GBAG, was designed by the architects Fritz Schupp and Martin Kremmer and quickly gained notice for its simple, functional Bauhaus design with its mainly cubical buildings made of reinforced concrete and steel trusses. The shaft's characteristic Doppelbock winding tower in the following years not only became the archetype of many later central mining facilities but also became a symbol of German heavy industry. The winding tower of Shaft 12 with inscription Zollverein has become a well-known symbol of Essen and the whole Ruhr area. Whilst this symbol may have slowly been forgotten when German heavy industry started diminishing in the second half of the 20th century, it was this shaft and especially its characteristic winding tower that were to become a symbol of the Ruhr area's structural change. =1932‚Äì1968= In 1937, Zollverein employed 6900 people and had an output of 3.6 million tons, the majority of which was contributed by the new 12th shaft. The other shafts were not entirely closed, and some, such as Shaft 6, even received new winding towers (though in comparison to Shaft 12 they were far inferior). On the premises of the old coking plant of Shafts 1, 2 and 8, a small facility of 54 new ovens was opened with a yearly output of 200,000 tons of coke. Zollverein survived the Second World War with only minor damage and by 1953 again placed on top of all German mines with an output of 2.4 million tons. In 1958, Shaft 1 was replaced by a totally new building; the complete reconstruction of the 2/8/11 shaft facility from 1960 until 1964 was again planned by Fritz Schupp. However, these renovations were to last only until 1967, when 11 shafts were closed, leaving Shaft 12 the only open one. Zollverein coking plant. Shaft 12 thus became the main supplier of the new central coking plant from 1961 with its 192 ovens, which was again designed by Fritz Schupp. After an expansion in the early 1970s, Zollverein placed among the most productive coking plants worldwide with around 1,000 workers and an output of up to 8,600 tons of coke a day on the so-called dark side. The white side of the plant produced side products such as ammonia, raw benzene and raw tar. In 1968, Zollverein was handed over to Ruhrkohle AG (RAG), Germany's largest mining company. =1968‚Äì1993= December 23, 1986: Final working day RAG began a further mechanization and consolidation of mining activities. In 1974, Zollverein was joined into a Verbundbergwerk (joined mines) with nearby Bonifacius and Holland coal mines in Kray and Gelsenkirchen, respectively. In 1982, Gelsenkirchen's Nordstern coal mine also joined that Verbund. The Fl√∂z Sonnenschein coal layer in the north of the Zollverein territory was the last layer in which mining activities took place on Zollverein territory, starting in 1980. The output of Verbundbergwerk Nordstern-Zollverein was approximately 3.2 million tons, but this did not prove profitable enough and a complete closure of the Zollverein site was voted for in 1983. When it closed, Zollverein was the last remaining active coal mine in Essen. Whereas the coking plant remained open until June 30, 1993, mining activities in Shaft 12 stopped on December 23, 1986. Although it is the central shaft of the Cultural Heritage site, Shaft 12 cannot be visited as it continues being used as the water drainage for the central Ruhr area together with Shaft 2. =1993- = Zollverein is one of the settings for the 2014 Pulitzer Prize winning novel All the Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr. Zollverein appeared as a \\"Wonder\\" in the video game Civilization VI, representing the Ruhr Valley. =Becoming a monument= As with most sites of the heavy industries that had been closed down, Zollverein was predicted to face a period of decay. Surprisingly, the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) bought the coal mine territory from the RAG immediately after it had been closed down in late 1986, and declared Shaft 12 a heritage site. This went along with the obligation to preserve the site in its original state and to minimize the effects of weathering. In 1989, the city of Essen and NRW founded the Bauh√ºtte Zollverein Schacht XII that should take care for the site and which was replaced by the Stiftung Zollverein (Zollverein Foundation) in 1998. After it had been closed down in 1993, the coking plant was planned to be sold to China. The negotiations failed and it was subsequently threatened to be demolished. However, another project of the state of NRW set the coal mine on a list of future exhibition sites resulting in first gentle modifications and the cokery also became an official heritage site in 2000. On its 25th session in December 2001, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) declared both the sites of Shafts 12 and 1/2 and the cokery a World Heritage Site. =Ruhr Museum= The Ruhr Museum in the former Coal Washery, located on the UNESCO World Heritages Site Zollverein, is the regional museum of the Ruhr Area. In its permanent exhibition the Ruhr Museum presents, with over 6,000 exhibits, the fascinating history of one of the largest industrial regions of the world, from the formation of coal 300 million years ago to the current structural change towards the Ruhr Metropolis. The Ruhr Museum has extensive collections on the geology, archaeology, industrial and social history as well as photography of the Ruhr Area. In addition to its permanent exhibition, the Ruhr Museum regularly shows special exhibitions and offers a diverse programme with workshops, guided tours, excursions, lectures, movie nights, audio guides and the museum bag for families.

He was a son of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and, following his father's death in 2011, he was described as an emerging leader within the group. Early life and family Hamza was believed to have been born in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, sometime in 1989.https://rewardsforjustice.net/english/hamza_bin_laden.html In January 2001, Hamza, his father and other family members attended the wedding of his brother Mohammed bin Laden in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar.Adam Robinson, Bin Laden: Behind the Mask of the Terrorist, p. 271 Video footage shot in Ghazni province in November of the same year shows Hamza and some of his siblings handling U.S. helicopter wreckage and working alongside the Taliban. In March 2003, it was claimed that Hamza and his brother Saad bin Laden had been wounded and captured in Ribat, Afghanistan. This claim eventually proved false. Hamza married a daughter of Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah when he was 17 years old. In August 2018, The Guardian quoted Hamza's uncles as saying he had married a daughter of 9/11 hijacker Mohamed Atta. However, Hamza's brother Omar bin Laden denied the report. Al-Qaeda activities In a 2005 video titled The Mujahideen of Waziristan, Hamza is shown participating in an al-Qaeda assault on Pakistani security forces in the south Waziristan tribal region between Afghanistan and Pakistan. In September 2007, it was reported that he was again in the tribal belt which encompasses the Pakistan/Afghanistan border region taking a senior role with al-Qaeda forces. In July 2008, a translation of a poem said to be written by Hamza was made available, which had been published on(2009) an extremist Islamic Web site. In the poem Hamza wrote \\"Accelerate the destruction of America, Britain, France and Denmark.\\" In response British MP Patrick Mercer dubbed Hamza bin Laden the Crown Prince of Terror. Hamza bin Laden was implicated in the 2007 assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. However, according to an interrogation of former al-Qaeda spokesman Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, Hamza was under house arrest in Iran when Bhutto was assassinated and was not released until 2010.http://kronosadvisory.com/Kronos_US_v_Sulaiman_Abu_Ghayth_Statement.1.pdf On 14 August 2015, he released an audio message for the very first time. He called upon followers in Kabul, Baghdad and Gaza to wage jihad, or holy war, on Washington, London, Paris and Tel Aviv. It was reported on 11 May 2016 he had released an audio message focused on the issues of Palestine and the Syrian Civil War. He said the \\"blessed Syrian revolution\\" had made the prospect of \\"liberating\\" Jerusalem more likely. \\"The Islamic umma (nation) should focus on jihad in al-Sham (Syria) ‚Ä¶ and unite the ranks of mujahedin,\\" he said. \\"There is no longer an excuse for those who insist on division and disputes now that the whole world has mobilised against Muslims.\\" In July 2016, media reported that he had issued an audio message threatening the United States in revenge for his father's death. In the 21-minute speech entitled \\"We Are All Osama\\", he said \\"We will continue striking you and targeting you in your country and abroad in response to your oppression of the people of Palestine, Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Somalia and the rest of the Muslim lands that did not survive your oppression,\\" Hamza said. \\"As for the revenge by the Islamic nation for Sheikh Osama, may Allah have mercy on him, it is not revenge for Osama the person but it is revenge for those who defended Islam.\\" In May 2017, a recording by Hamza bin Laden was published by As-Sahab, encouraging terrorist attacks against Western targets. It is rumored he pledged allegiance to Jama'at Ansar al-Furqan in Bilad al Sham in 2017. In the light of his growing influence within al-Qaeda, the United States classified Hamza bin Laden as Specially Designated Global Terrorist in January 2017. This effectively put him on a blacklist aimed at restricting his movement and economic abilities. In May 2017, a video was released in which he calls on his followers to attack Jews, Americans, Westerners and Russians, via lone wolf attacks using any means possible. On 28 February 2019, the United States Department of State offered a reward of up to US$1 million for information leading to the identification or location in any country of Hamza bin Laden. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia announced on 1 March 2019 that it had revoked bin Laden's citizenship through a royal decree signed in November 2018. May 2011 raid Hamza was the son of Khairiah Sabar of Saudi Arabia, one of bin Laden's three wives who were living in the Abbottabad compound. Osama bin Laden's last home, in Abbottabad Interrogation of the surviving wives of Osama bin Laden by Pakistani intelligence after the raid on the Abbottabad compound revealed Hamza was the only person missing. He was not among those killed or injured. The raid conducted by the SEAL team was thorough: infrared technology, as well as ground troops, remained confident nobody inside the compound had escaped. There were no hidden exit tunnels from the compound. In a letter confiscated in the raid, written by bin Laden and addressed to his \\"Chief of Staff\\" Atiyah Abd al-Rahman, bin Laden mentions his desire that Hamza would be educated in Qatar as a religious scholar so that he could \\"refute the wrong and the suspicions raised around Jihad.\\" The same letter revealed that Hamza did not escape the raid because he was not even present in Abbottabad. Letters from the compound also confirmed that Osama was apparently grooming Hamza to be his heir, following the death of Hamza's older brother Saad in a 2009 US drone strike. Death On 31 July 2019, The New York Times and other news organizations quoted unnamed American officials as saying that bin Laden was said to have been killed in the first two years of the Trump administration, which began on January 20, 2017. At the time, intelligence agencies were unable to confirm his death and, in February 2019, the U.S. State Department issued a $1 million reward for information leading to bin Laden's whereabouts.

Ezarik's video focused on the unnecessary waste of paper, as the detailed bill itemized all data transfers made during the billing period, including every email and text message. Stories of unexpected billing issues began to circulate in blogs and the technical press after the Apple iPhone's heavily advertised and anticipated release, but this video clip brought the voluminous bills to the attention of the mass media. Ten days later, after the video had been viewed more than 3 million times on the Internet and had received international news coverage, AT&T; sent iPhone users a text message outlining changes in its billing practices. The information technology magazine Computerworld included this incident in its list of \\"Technology's 10 Most Mortifying Moments\\".  Background  Apple released the iPhone in the United States with a software \\"lock\\" so it could only be used on the AT&T; Mobility network. After purchase, buyers activated their iPhone's AT&T; service contract using the Apple iTunes software, during which buyers had the ability to choose their billing preference; however, if no option was specified during activation, AT&T; defaulted to detailed billing. Detailed billing itemized every data transfer, including background traffic for e-mail, text messaging, and Web browsing. This generated a large number of entries on the detailed bills. After a month's time, as early adopters started receiving their first monthly bills, stories of unusually large and expensive iPhone bills began to circulate. The 300-page bill was exceptional, but other heavy users received 50- to 100-page bills. One of the first to attract wider attention was from Ben Kuchera, gaming editor for the technology-related website Ars Technica, who described his 34-sheet, double-sided bill and another 104-page bill sent to a colleague, writing, \\"While many of us have had smart-phones for some time, we've never seen a bill like this.\\" However, it was the release of Justine Ezarik's video that acted as a catalyst to bring widespread media attention to this aspect of the iPhone story.  Video  Justine Ezarik and her iPhone, in a case, in 2008 Justine Ezarik, then a 23-year-old Pittsburgh-area graphic designer and sketch comedian, who video blogged under the name iJustine, received her 300-page bill on Saturday, August 11, 2007 and decided to use it as a prop for a self-produced video shot in a coffee shop. She posted the edited one-minute clip to several popular Internet video hosting services by the following Monday. In the first week, the video received over 500,000 total views on YouTube, 350,000 views on Revver, 500,000 views on Break.com and 1,100,000 views on Yahoo Video, as self-reported by the four popular Internet video sites as of August 22. Total views were reported to exceed 8 million by the end of 2007. Ezarik said she earned $2,000 from the video from Revver. Portions of the video were also televised along with one-on-one interviews with Ezarik by several national and local news programs in the United States, including CNN, Fox News Channel, WTAE-TV, and WPXI-TV. ABC News Now also included independent reporting by an ABC News Radio reporter in their video interview. Ezarik's Internet video commentary focused on the unnecessary waste of paper billing. In the video she highlights the physical size of the bill, not the amount due. \\"I have an iPhone and I had to switch to AT&T.; So, that's wonderful. Well, I got my first AT&T; bill, right here in a box,\\" she says at the start of the video. The rest of the video, set to the distinctive music used in American iPhone television commercials, shows her opening the box and flipping through the pages in fast motion. The clip ends with the on-screen caption, \\"Use e-billing. Save a forest.\\" Her other comments also followed along the same lines. In a blog posting, she wrote, \\"Apparently, they give you a detailed transaction of every text message sent and received. Completely unnecessary.\\" She told a USA Today reporter, \\"This is so silly, there's no reason they need to send you this much information.\\" Ezarik is a heavy user who typically sends and receives tens of thousands of text messages a month, which generated an exceptionally long, $275 bill ‚Äì 300 double-sided pages that had to be sent in a box with postage charges of $7.  Reaction  The original iPhone. = Company = AT&T; Mobility, the mobile phone service provider for the iPhone, said through spokesman Mark Siegel that the size of this bill was exceptional. \\"We're not sending lots of boxed bills to customers,\\" he told USA Today. He said that the billing is the same for all AT&T; mobile users, but the popularity and functionality of the iPhone gave it new visibility. \\"It's no different than with any other bill for any other device or any other service that we offer.\\" Later, on August 18, AT&T; issued a statement saying: \\"Our customers have the option of receiving a bill that is detail-free. Also, we have for years encouraged our customers to switch to online billing because it is convenient, secure, and environmentally friendly.\\" Then, on August 22, AT&T; announced via text message to iPhone users that it was removing itemized detail from paper bills. Ezarik responded, \\"Looks like they may have got the message,\\" in response to AT&T;'s action. Company spokeswoman Lauren Garner claimed public reaction was not the reason for the company's switch from detailed to summary billing, saying, \\"This was something we planned all along.\\" = Industry = AT&T; may not have anticipated the downstream effects of iPhone customers' high data usage. As a result, AT&T; call centers were flooded with complaints about the size of the bills. Internet reporter Dana Blankenhorn stated that the size of the bill illustrated a problem with the telephone companies' \\"event based\\" or connection-oriented business model and used it to argue for open spectrum in a radio frequency spectrum auction in the U.S. scheduled for 2008. He contrasted how telephone billing considers every action a separately billable event, while the Internet model is based on a flat fee for best-effort delivery in connectionless mode transmission. The information technology magazine Computerworld reported on the incident, saying the company's \\"extraordinarily detailed billing process resulted in some users receiving bills that ran dozens or even hundreds of pages long.\\" It published the gaffe in its list of \\"Technology's 10 Most Mortifying Moments\\". = Environmental = Rob Enderle, a Silicon Valley tech analyst, also echoed Ezarik's environmental activism, saying, \\"AT&T; should get a new tagline ‚Äì use AT&T;, kill a tree.\\" The USA Today story was also titled \\"How many trees did your iPhone bill kill?\\" According to blogger Muhammad Saleem, Apple's aim to have 10 million iPhone users by the end of 2008 would require the logging of about 74,535 trees annually, assuming an average 100-page monthly bill. An editorial in The Blade, an independent newspaper in Toledo, Ohio, called the detailed billing \\"absurd and environmentally wasteful\\". = Security = One security conscious commenter on the Engadget consumer electronics blog addressed the privacy implications of the oversize bills given the limitations of personal paper shredders, by speculating on whether it would be more practical to dispose of these large bills by burning them to protect personal information. An editor for the libertarian monthly Reason also speculated about the usefulness of the detailed information to government investigators. The original Ars Technica blog posting, on the other hand, dismissed privacy concerns, showing that the detail pages do not contain sensitive information.  Other outsized iPhone bills  Press accounts of this story also included related details and comments: * The founder of a Tampa, Florida think tank received a 42-page bill and told a reporter, \\"It's ridiculous.\\" * An Oak Harbor, Ohio teacher called his 52-page bill \\"the biggest phone bill I've ever gotten in my life\\". * A partner of a Macintosh consulting firm called his bill \\"60 pages of nothingness\\". * A business consultant from Virginia received a 62-page bill and asked a reporter, \\"Why would you send bills that large?\\" * A software company owner near Seattle, Washington posted on his blog a picture of a Maltese dog sitting on his 127-page bill spread out on the floor. and asked, \\"Has anyone on the Apple Environmental Team seen an AT&T; bill?\\" * \\"The Packet Rat\\" columnist wrote in Government Computer News that his wife received a 150-page boxed iPhone bill and commented, \\"OK, how many trees did they have to kill to send out the first month's bills?\\"  See also  *Customer proprietary network information  References   External links  * , Justine Ezarik's video, on YouTube * Justine Ezarik's blog entry regarding the August 13, 2007 iPhone bill * from WTAE-TV News, Pittsburgh * news story from WTAE-TV News IPhone Mobile phone culture Viral videos 2007 YouTube videos Internet memes introduced in 2007 ","title":"300-page iPhone bill"},{"id":"13257631","text":"Kusatsu Station (ËçâÊ¥•ÈßÖ) is the name of two train stations in Japan: * Kusatsu Station (Hiroshima) * Kusatsu Station (Shiga) ","title":"Kusatsu Station"},{"id":"13257649","text":"Ky≈´j≈çmae Station (ÁêÉÂ†¥ÂâçÈßÖ, literally \\"in front of ballpark station\\") may refer to the following train stations in Japan: * Ky≈´j≈çmae Station (Kochi), in Aki, K≈çchi * Ky≈´j≈çmae Station (Okayama), in Kurashiki, Okayama * Kiry≈´-Ky≈´j≈ç-Mae Station, in Kiry≈´, Gunma * Seibu-Ky≈´j≈ç-mae Station, in Tokorozawa, Saitama ","title":"Ky≈´j≈çmae Station"},{"id":"13257681","text":"Joseph Edward Willard (May 1, 1865 ‚Äì April 4, 1924) was an American politician, philanthropist, and diplomat.

S. Seward Institute is the secondary school in the Florida Union Free School District in Orange County, New York, United States. It is located along Main Street (NY 17A/94) in the village of Florida and referred to locally as just \\"Seward\\". The student body consists of grades 6-12, drawn from Florida and surrounding portions of the towns of Chester, Goshen and Warwick. The school gets its name from Samuel S. Seward, who settled in the region in the early 19th century and established both a medical practice and a mercantile business. Seward was also active in politics, serving as a member of the New York State Assembly in 1804 and, for many years, as a judge in the Orange County Court. In 1846, Seward started the school with an endowment of $20,000. One of his sons, William Henry Seward, attended one of the institute's predecessors for a time, and later began a career in public service that culminated in the purchase of Alaska while Secretary of State. A memorial to him is located on Main Street in front of the school. Athletics With the smallest population of any secondary school in Orange County, Seward is the rare American public high school that does not field a football team in the fall. Despite this, the Spartans have had very successful sports teams over the years, winning state titles in baseball (1999), boys basketball (2003) and girls soccer (1987, 2007 and 2008), making Seward the smallest school in New York to win state titles in three different sports. In June 2009, they won their first softball section title. In the fall of 2009 they created their first varsity volleyball team.

Naylor kicked sixty goals in his debut season, including nine in the first semi-final against Claremont, but the Second World War caused the WANFL to revert to an underage competition for three seasons. Owing to military service in Darwin Naylor did not wear the red and white again until 1946,Devaney, John; Full Points Footy‚Äôs WA Football Companion; pp. 261-262. when he scored 131 goals to head the WANFL goalkicking for the first of six occasions.

In 1952, however, Naylor asserted himself as one of the greatest goalkickers in the history of Australian Rules with a tally of 147 goals, which beat George Doig's 1937 record of 144.

Carluccio is a two-time Emmy-nominated filmmaker who is best known for documenting obscure pockets of urban society and the creative process. His documentary project Battle Sounds, is considered to be the first film to document the Turntablism movement in the 1990s. He is the inventor and co-designer of TTM, Turntablist Transcription Methodology, a notation system for DJ scratching. Carluccio's short films have aired nationally and internationally. In a 20-year span, John created over 500 short films as an on-staff producer/director for TV and digital networks, Current TV, BRIC TV, and Dubspot Music School, and for clients such as W.K. Kellogg Foundation, Native Instruments, and Sozo Artists via his production company CINQUA  Creative Documentary Agency. In 2019, he directed his first feature-length documentary, Maurice Hines: Bring Them Back ‚Äî Grand Jury Prize Winner (Metropolis) at DOC NYC 2019 and Grand Jury Prize Winner 'Best Documentary\\" at The American Black Film Festival 2020. He lives and works in Brooklyn, N.Y., and is married to writer/producer Tracy E. Hopkins.  Early life  John Carluccio grew up in Teaneck, N.J., and went to Teaneck High School. He was the recipient of the 1987 Pratt National Talent Scholarship, a five-year, full-tuition scholarship for the Pratt School of Architecture. At Pratt, he excelled in art and design and he was a DJ at the college radio station, WPIR. He worked various jobs including a movie projectionist, ice cream man, an architectural draftsman and a barista at the Angelika Film Center in New York City. =Brother Collaboration= In 1993, post college, he worked alongside his younger brother Paul Carluccio, a student at NYU Tisch School of the Arts. Carluccio story-boarded, sound edited and even acted in his brother's student films. This soon led the brothers to Madison Square Garden, where they worked as Fan-cam directors for the New York Knicks, New York Liberty and New York Rangers. In a newly created role with MSG's in-house video team, the brothers vetted and recruited the most enthusiastic sports fans and celebrities to appear live on the arena's Jumbotron. The Carluccio brothers eventually landed roles in creating original content for MSG, recording off-site events and firmly establishing themselves as a creative team for sports videos. John worked with MSG events from 1996 to 2005, including two years as a cinematographer shooting live-action basketball from the court floor.  Turntablism / Hip-Hop DJing  =Battle Sounds: Hip-Hop DJ Documentary= While studying at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, N.Y., in 1988 Carluccio began frequenting underground DJ battles in New York City. An experimental art student at heart, Carluccio soon became immersed in record collecting, noise collage and scratching. In the summer of 1994, he rallied his friends Rio Valledor, Jon Mark Bagnall and brother Paul Carluccio to begin production on the Battle Sounds: Hip-Hop DJ Documentary. Battle Sounds was a documentary project recorded primarily from 1994 to 1997. The project captures the grassroots DJ culture movement at a pivotal time in its evolution. Carluccio and his team recorded over 200 hours of material in New York City, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, San Francisco and London. He interviewed over 50 key contributors to the early turntablist scene, including well-known DJs and hip-hop producers DJ Premier, Kid Capri and Pete Rock; underground DJ battle stars DJ QBert, DJ Mix Master Mike, DJ Rob Swift, DJ Roc Raida, DJ Babu, DJ Craze, DJ Quest and DJ 8-Ball; scratch pioneers DJ Grand Wizzard Theodore, DJ Grand Mixer DXT, DJ Jazzy Jeff and DJ Cash Money; and recording artists that many of these DJs sampled heavily, including jazz artist Bob James and rocker Billy Squier. Pulling from his five-hour rough cut, Carluccio created a 60-minute excerpt reel for Battle Sounds' premiere at the coveted Whitney Museum of American Art Biennial Exhibit. The Battles Sounds: 1997 Whitney Biennial Cut was later released on VHS and distributed at underground record stores. Over the next 20 years, the independent documentary took on a cult following, and was duplicated and shared internationally. Unfortunately, beyond the two versions, ‚ÄúThe Whitney Cut‚Äù and an earlier VHS release titled X-ersize #1, a film about the X-Men DJ crew, audiences never had the chance to see the full scope of the project. Financial obstacles and the massive amount of music clearances required by TV and film distributors at the time prevented the project from being completed in the way it was envisioned. = After Battle Sounds= Through the Battle Sounds project, Carluccio gained credibility in the DJ community and continued to collaborate with turntablists for many years to come. From 1996 to 2001, he produced The Battle Sounds Turntablist Festival, an open and non-competitive DJ event in New York City. While documenting X-Pressions, the X-Ecutioners‚Äô first studio recording in 1997, Carluccio recognized the need for a musical arrangement and conduction tool. So he designed the first version of TTM, Turntablist Transcription Methodology, a notation system for DJ scratching. In 1998, he co-founded and produced Hop-Fu, a live turntablist scoring of a kung fu film. The project still tours today and has played at film festivals and cultural institutions around the world. In 2001, Carluccio appeared in and was the associate producer for the feature film Scratch. He has photographed the DJ and turntablism scene for magazines, including Vibe, The Fader and Wax Poetics. In more recent years, he has collaborated with DMC Champion DJ Shiftee on a series of videos for Native Instruments, and in 2013 he produced and co-hosted a livestreaming turntablist series titled Stylus Sessions for Dubspot Music School. =TTM Inventor= In 2001, Carluccio was named by Time Magazine one of the next 100 Innovators in music for his TTM, Turntablist Transcription Methodology. The TTM notation system has aided and elevated the communication and collaboration among DJs, turntablists, musicians and producers. It is the industry standard of musical notation for turntablists worldwide. The TTM booklet created by Carluccio, industrial designer Ethan Imboden and DJ Rae Dawn (Raymond Pirtle) continues to be downloaded and shared, and turntablist enthusiasts have translated versions of the booklet into Italian, French and Spanish.  Short Films  = Independent = In 2000, Carluccio directed The Price of Getting Up, a short film that documented the attempted police shutdown of ‚ÄúStreet Market,\\" a collaborative installation with graffiti artists Barry McGee, Todd James and Stephen Powers (ESPO) at Deitch Projects in New York City. The film was part of a DVD-zine project titled MOVE that he produced with fellow Brooklyn filmmakers Joey Garfield and Gabor Stibinger. MOVE documented fashion, art, politics and dance, including a rare interview with dance pioneer Don Campbell. Carluccio has collaborated with artist/designer Ari Saal Forman multiple times, including an experimental sneaker talk-show pilot titled Sneaker Geeks (2003) ‚Äî featuring Forman, Kenny Meez, ESPO and designers Dee and Ricky. Continuing his work with Forman, in 2010 he released the short film Cease & Desist, aka Ari Can't Talk About It, which explored sneaker collector culture, color trends and copyright infringement when Forman transformed the lively branding of Newport cigarettes into a limited run Nike-like sneaker. The short film premiered at Slamdance in 2010. = Current TV, 2006-2009= Carluccio was a producer/editor/shooter for Current TV, a national cable television network and web platform.

From the 10th-century Codex Vigilanus. Ariamir (died before 566) was the Suevic King of Galicia, with his capital at Bracara, from 558/9. The bishops of the First Council of Braga recorded Ariamir as the king who summoned them and under whose auspices they deliberated. Because the bishops mention theirs as being the first Nicene synod to be held in Galicia in a long while, Ariamir is sometimes assumed to have been the king who led the conversion of his people from Arianism to orthodoxy and thus to have lifted the ban on Nicene councils. The conversion of the Suevi to Catholicism, however, is presented very differently in the primary records, of which the minutes of the council of Braga are the only contemporary ones. Specifically, the minutes of the council--which met on 1 May 561 (in the era of the province 599, the third year of his reign, anno tertio Ariamiri regis)--state explicitly that the synod was held at his orders, ex praecepto praefati gloriosissimi Ariamiri regis, and the bishops allude to him as \\"our most glorious and pious son\\" (gloriosissimus atque piissimus filius noster). Based on the dating clause, Ariamir's reign can be said to have begun between 2 May 558 and 1 May 559. While his Catholicism is not in doubt, that he was the first Catholic monarch of the Sueves since Rechiar has been contested.Thompson, 86. It has also been suggested that Ariamir was the same person as Theodemir, who is mentioned by Isidore of Seville in connection with the Suevic conversion and Martin of Dumio. He is likewise also said to have been a son of Chararic, a king mentioned by Gregory of Tours in connection with the conversion and Martin of Tours. It is likely, however, that Chararic and Theodemir must have reigned after Ariamir, since Ariamir must have been the first Suevic monarch to lift the ban on Catholic synods and it is inconceivable that a Catholic monarch could have continued the ban for \\"a long time\\".Thompson, 87. On the other hand, some scholars see the conversion of the Suevi as progressive and stepwise and regard Ariamir's lifting of the ban on synods as the second step following Chararic's public conversion.Ferreiro, passim. Aside from the council held in his name, nothing else is known of Ariamir except that he was probably succeeded sometime between the end of May 561 and the year 566 by Theodemir.

Plot Ranger Steve (John Rhys- Davies) sits by a campfire, telling a story about the Davis family. John Davis (William Hurt) is flying a water plane over a valley called Sasquatch Valley with his two daughters Khristy and Maggie. Khristy tells Maggie that a Sasquatch means Bigfoot and Maggie wonders if there are any Bigfoot in the valley. Khristy tells her that Bigfoot is a myth. They finally arrive at their new home and there are pine cones all over the house. At the end of the day everything is cleaned up and everyone goes to bed. Maggie hears something in the shed outside. She finds a small bigfoot in the shed. Maggie trips and falls and the small bigfoot runs away. In the morning John, Maggie, and Khristy go to John's new job. They meet Dave (Joe Alaskey) the boss of the plant. A new dam is going to be built in a river that will provide power for the area. Meanwhile, Cletus McNabb and his sidekick Dawg the dog want to catch a bigfoot. That night Maggie goes outside again to look for the bigfoot. She finds him again and chases the bigfoot way out into the forest. She loses him and it starts to rain. The bigfoot comes back with his mother (June Foray) and takes her into a secret cave under a waterfall. Maggie finds out that the new dam will flood their home. The bigfoot takes Maggie home. The next morning Maggie tries to tell John and Khristy but they don't believe her. Once John goes to work Maggie and Khristy meet Ranger Steve he says that John asked him to check up on them. Once he leaves Maggie tries to tell Khristy that bigfoot is real but Khristy does not believe her. Mad, Maggie runs to go find them. Khristy follows her and they finally come to the cave. Cletus McNabb and Dawg see them go into the cave and sets up a plan to catch one of the bigfoot. John goes back to the house and looks everywhere for his daughters. When John goes out into the forest he runs into bigfoot and they take him to the cave. Now John knows that the bigfoot are in danger so they plan a way to stop the cave from flooding. They pile up all of the pine cones in the valley and grinding them up into pulp. They take the pulp into the cave and cover the cracks in the cave with it. Now they wonder if the walls will cave in so they have to move them out. They move them high up in the snowy mountains in another cave. Cletus and Dawg go into the cave to catch one of them but the caves close in and the cave floods and Cletus and Dawg get out. Up in the mountains the Davis family say goodbye to the bigfoot. At the end of the credits Dawg gets mad at Cletus and moves in with the Davises.

Contrary to the word's implication, a road's design speed is not necessarily its maximum safe speed; that can be higher or lower. TOC Geometric features The design speed chosen for a highway is a major factor in choosing superelevation rates and radii of curves, sight distance, and the lengths of crest and sag vertical curves. Roads with higher travel speeds require sweeping curves, steeper curve banking, longer sight distances, and more gentle hill crests and valleys. Lower speed roads can have sharper curves, less banking, less sight distance, and sharper hill crests and valleys. Speed limit variance from design speed While a road's design speed is sometimes used to determine an initial speed limit, it is an imperfect measure of the maximum speed at which a motor vehicle can be operated for reasons including: * It is only a theoretical or laboratory measurement created before a road is even built. * Design speed is not necessarily road's maximum safe speed. As highway design incorporate a signiÔ¨Åcant factor of safety, drivers can travel faster than design speed without difficulty when good weather conditions are present. * The highest design speed for a road or segment is the design speed of its least favorable part. For example, given a road segment with a 60 mph design speed except for a curve with a 45 mph design speed, the entire segment would have a 45 mph design speed. In reality, the road may have a 45 mph advisory speed on the curve and higher safe operating speeds elsewhere. * The design speed may be higher than legislated speed limit caps, so it would not be legal to sign some roads at their design speeds.http://www.mynorthwest.com/category/local_news_articles/20100907/WSDOT- says-roads-can't-support-90-mph-freeway- passes/http://tti.tamu.edu/documents/0-5544-1.pdf * It is based on the capabilities of vehicles and roadways that existed at or before the design speed was determined. Vehicular and roadway technologies generally improve over time. Therefore, as time elapses from when a roadway's original design speed was determined, it is increasingly likely that a design speed will underestimate the maximum safe speed. Recognizing the limitations on the use of the design speed for speed limit determination, \\"operating speeds and even posted speed limits can be higher than design speeds without necessarily compromising safety\\" and \\"arbitrarily setting lower speed limits at point locations due to a lower inferred design speed is neither effective nor good engineering practice.\\" Evolution The concept of design speed is evolving. The definition in the 1994 edition of the AASHTO Green Book, was \\"the maximum safe speed that can be maintained over a specified section of highway when conditions are so favorable that the design features of the highway govern. The assumed design speed should be a logical one with respect to the topography, the adjacent land use, and the functional classification of highway.\\" A majority of US states used this definition. In 2004, the first sentence was changed to \\"a selected speed used to determine the various geometric design features of a roadway.\\" This reflects the fact that meeting a minimum design speed is not enough to ensure a safe roadway. Recently, the concept of design consistency has been used instead of minimum design speeds. This attempts to connect driver's expectations about the roadway with the roadway design. It uses driver behavior models to predict vehicle speeds on highway segments, and compares the predicted speed on adjacent segments. Significant reductions in speed from one segment to the next are flagged as locations where drivers may end up driving too fast for road conditions. A major shift in philosophy is also taking place regarding design speed of urban and suburban streets. Highway engineers would measure the prevailing speed on a road, round up to the next multiple of 5 mph, and design the road for that speed, assuming that it would be safe. Recent research and design practices have focused on using the street design to influence drivers to choose a speed appropriate for the neighborhood. This speed has been called the \\"target speed,\\" and is ideally equal to the speed limit. Factors When roads are planned, the selected design speed may be based on or influence several factors, including: * geometric design of road features * planned operating speed * legislated speed limit caps * anticipated traffic volume * the road's functional classification See also *Assured clear distance ahead *Geometric design of roads *Operating speed *Solomon curve *Speed limit *Stopping sight distance *Traffic calming References Road transport ","title":"Design speed"},{"id":"13257978","text":"Grant High School is a public secondary school situated in Mount Gambier, South Australia.

This method is popular among the photonic crystal community as a method of solving for the band structure (dispersion relation) of specific photonic crystal geometries. PWE is traceable to the analytical formulations, and is useful in calculating modal solutions of Maxwell's equations over an inhomogeneous or periodic geometry. It is specifically tuned to solve problems in a time-harmonic forms, with non-dispersive media. Principles Plane waves are solutions to the homogeneous Helmholtz equation, and form a basis to represent fields in the periodic media. PWE as applied to photonic crystals as described is primarily sourced from Dr. Danner's tutorial.http://www.ece.nus.edu.sg/stfpage/eleadj/planewave.htm The electric or magnetic fields are expanded for each field component in terms of the Fourier series components along the reciprocal lattice vector. Similarly, the dielectric permittivity (which is periodic along reciprocal lattice vector for photonic crystals) is also expanded through Fourier series components. : \\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon_r} = \\\\sum_{m=-\\\\infty}^{+\\\\infty} K_m^{\\\\epsilon_r} e^{-i \\\\vec{G}.\\\\vec{r}} : E(\\\\omega,\\\\vec{r}) = \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^{+\\\\infty} K_n^{E_y} e^{-i\\\\vec{G}.\\\\vec{r}} e^{-i\\\\vec{k}\\\\vec{r}} with the Fourier series coefficients being the K numbers subscripted by m, n respectively, and the reciprocal lattice vector given by \\\\vec{G}. In real modeling, the range of components considered will be reduced to just \\\\pm Nmax instead of the ideal, infinite wave. Using these expansions in any of the curl-curl relations like, : \\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon(\\\\vec{r})} abla \\\\times abla \\\\times E(\\\\vec{r},\\\\omega) = \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\omega}{c} \\\\right)^2 E(\\\\vec{r},\\\\omega) and simplifying under assumptions of a source free, linear, and non-dispersive region we obtain the eigen value relations which can be solved. Example for 1D case For a y-polarized z-propagating electric wave, incident on a 1D-DBR periodic in only z-direction and homogeneous along x,y, with a lattice period of a. We then have the following simplified relations: Band structure of a 1D Photonic Crystal, DBR air-core calculated using plane wave expansion technique with 101 planewaves, for d/a=0.8, and dielectric contrast of 12.250. : \\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon_r} = \\\\sum_{m=-\\\\infty}^{+\\\\infty} K_m^{\\\\epsilon_r} e^{-i \\\\frac{2\\\\pi m}{a}z} : E(\\\\omega,\\\\vec{r}) = \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^{+\\\\infty} K_n^{E_y} e^{-i\\\\frac{2\\\\pi n}{a}z} e^{-i\\\\vec{k}\\\\vec{r}} The constitutive eigen equation we finally have to solve becomes, : \\\\sum_n{\\\\left( \\\\frac{2\\\\pi n}{a} + k_z \\\\right)\\\\left( \\\\frac{2\\\\pi m}{a} + k_z \\\\right) K_{m-n}^{\\\\epsilon_r} K_{n}^{E_y}} = \\\\frac{\\\\omega^2}{c^2}K_{m}^{E_y} This can be solved by building a matrix for the terms in the left hand side, and finding its eigen value and vectors. The eigen values correspond to the modal solutions, while the corresponding magnetic or electric fields themselves can be plotted using the Fourier expansions. The coefficients of the field harmonics are obtained from the specific eigen vectors. The resulting band-structure obtained through the eigen modes of this structure are shown to the right. =Example code= We can use the following code in Matlab or GNU Octave to compute the same band structure, % % solve the DBR photonic band structure for a simple % 1D DBR. air-spacing d, periodicity a, i.e, a > d, % we assume an infinite stack of 1D alternating eps_rair layers % y-polarized, z-directed plane wave incident on the stack % periodic in the z-direction; % %parameters d=8; %air gap a=10; %total periodicity d_over_a = d/a; eps_r =12.2500; %dielectric constant, like GaAs, % max F.S coefs for representing E field, and Eps(r), are Mmax=50; % Q matrix is non-symmetric in this case, Qij != Qji % Qmn = (2*pi*n + Kz)^2*Km-n % Kn = delta_n / eps_r + (1 - 1/eps_r)(d/a)sinc(pi.n.d/a) % here n runs from -Mmax to + Mmax, freqs=[]; for Kz=-pi/a:pi/(10*a):+pi/a Q=zeros(2*Mmax + 1); for x=1:2*Mmax+1 for y=1:2*Mmax+1 X=x-Mmax; Y=y-Mmax; kn=(1 -1/eps_r)*d_over_a.*sinc((X-Y).*d_over_a) + ((X-Y)0)*1/eps_r; Q(x,y)=(2*pi*(Y-1)/a + Kz).^2*kn;% -Mmax<=(Y-1)<=Mmax end end fprintf('Kz = %g ',Kz) omega_c=eig(Q); omega_c=sort(sqrt(omega_c));%important step. freqs=[freqs; omega_c.']; end close() figure() hold on idx=1; for idx=1:length(-pi/a:pi/(10*a):+pi/a) plot(-pi/a:pi/(10*a):+pi/a,freqs(:,idx),'.-') end hold off xlabel('Kz') ylabel('omega/c') title(sprintf('PBG of 1D DBR with d/a=%g, Epsr=%g',d/a,eps_r)) Advantages PWE expansions are rigorous solutions. PWE is extremely well suited to the modal solution problem. Large size problems can be solved using iterative techniques like Conjugate gradient method. For both generalized and normal eigen value problems, just a few band-index plots in the band-structure diagrams are required, usually lying on the brillouin zone edges. This corresponds to eigen modes solutions using iterative techniques, as opposed to diagonalization of the entire matrix. The PWEM is highly efficient for calculating modes in periodic dielectric structures. Being a Fourier space method, it suffers from the Gibbs phenomenon and slow convergence in some configuration when fast Fourier factorization is not used. It is the method of choice for calculating the band structure of photonic crystals. It is not easy to understand at first, but it is easy to implement. Disadvantages Sometimes spurious modes appear. Large problems scaled as O(n3), with the number of the plane waves (n) used in the problem. This is both time consuming and complex in memory requirements. Alternatives include Order-N spectral method, and methods using Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) which are simpler, and model transients. If implemented correctly, spurious solutions are avoided. It is less efficient when index contrast is high or when metals are incorporated. It cannot be used for scattering analysis.

As interest on mortgages is compounded, early payments diminish the period needed to pay off the mortgage, and avoid a quotient of compounded interest. In addition, acceleration may refer to a clause in a mortgage note (See Acceleration clause) that allows the mortgage holder to declare the entire debt of a defaulted mortgagor due and payable. A commonplace method of mortgage acceleration is a so-called bi- weekly payment plan, in which half of the normal calendar monthly payment is made every two weeks, so that 13/12 of the yearly amount due is paid per annum. Commonplace too, is the practice of making ad hoc additional payments. The agreements associated with certain mortgages preclude or penalize early payments. Types  Financial institutions and intermediaries offer products such as mortgage-linked checking accounts, and home equity line of credit loan facilities advertised as being capable of assisting in achieving mortgage acceleration, and available at a range of premiums. The claim made is that by using a particular type of loan in a particular way (often following a ‚Äúprogram‚Äù), the borrower can cut many years off the mortgage without making additional repayments ‚Äì or similarly, that although additional payments are made, the savings increase significantly due to the use of a particular loan and/or strategy. The concept usually involves a type of loan that allows the borrower to use the loan as their day-to-day transaction account. This loan may refinance the entire mortgage, be in addition to the mortgage (requiring regular transfers to the mortgage) or in some cases involves an ‚Äúoffset‚Äù account, that sits separately to the mortgage but offsets interest on any deposit against the mortgage interest. A lender can also require that a borrower pay the remaining balance on a loan if certain requirements aren't met. This can be found in the \\"acceleration clause\\". Promoters Promoters can profit from the sale of software, providing ‚Äúmonitoring‚Äù or ‚Äúsupport‚Äù, or from commissions from referrals to lenders. Examples are usually presented that show huge savings on the mortgage. These examples may be based on the borrower's estimate of their regular expenditure, or on an ‚Äúexample‚Äù family. An underestimate of real expenditure (by the promoter or the borrower) leaves additional amounts in the mortgage (or related account) in the example, and the example therefore shows significant savings. However, the presentations represent that the savings are primarily due to the type of loan account and the way it is being used.

History Moscow University was founded on January 25, 1755 by a decree of the Empress Elizaveta Petrovna on the initiative of the great Russian scientist Mikhail Lomonosov. In 1755 Moscow University had three faculties namely Philosophy, Jurisprudence and Medicine. The establishment of Moscow University in 1755 had a great value for offering medical education in Russia. According to the original plan suggested by Mikhail Lomonosov, the medical faculty was supposed to teach chemistry, natural history, botany, zoology, agronomics and anatomy. Semen Gerasimovich Zybelin, the well-known professor of medicine in the past, was amongst the first group of student from the faculty. In the 19th century, the development of medical and scientific activity in the medical faculty continued. The medical faculty received bases for clinical training and many new departments were created namely anatomy, physiology and pathology, therapy, pharmacology, medical literature, surgery, obstetrics and veterinary medicine. The medical school was a progenitor of scientific and medical society in Russia. With the great participation and contribution of professors from the medical faculty, numerous medical journals and textbooks were created. This tradition continued until 1930, the medical faculty operated independently and separated from the main body of the university. It became the first Moscow state medical institute. Nowadays the institute named as Moscow Medical Academy named after I.M. Sechenov. In 1992, the Faculty of Basic (or Fundamental) Medicine was created by an order of the rector of Moscow State University, Professor V.A.Sadovnichy. Departments The faculty mainly composed of twelve departments: *Therapy- Professor V. E. Nonikov (head) *Surgery - RAMS member, Professor N. N. Malinovsky (head) *Pharmacology - Professor O. S.

The complex will be situated near the intersection of Lomonosovsky and Michurinsky Avenues. The clinic is plan to be of both scientific and clinical value assisting researchers in their studies and providing many opportunities for medical practise to students, professors and staff as well as residents. The complex will include a polyclinic with treatment-and- diagnostics section serving 400 patients a day, a hospital with 300 beds and administrative building, a learning unit, an operational unit, etc. The total area of the complex is planned to be 44000 square metres. The modern architecture of the FBM building is supposed to fit into the traditional look of MSU buildings and the residential area nearby. Separate constructions will be connected by means of covered passages, and a park for patients. Three separate entrances on the premises of the complex will allow to separate the flow of patients, visitors and medical students. Short-term programs These programs are basically for students from overseas. The duration of short-term programs which are composed of clinical practise and medical research, can last from two to ten months. For postgraduate students, the faculty offers a special biomedical research under the supervision of related specialists.

Early life Martha Louise Morrow was born in Charlotte, North Carolina, the daughter of Frank Morrow and Hattie Morrow. Foxx became partially blind in infancy, from an eye disease. She entered the Governor Morehead School for the Blind as a young child, until her family moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania when Foxx was eleven. There she was enrolled in the Overbrook School for the Blind, later beginning college at Temple University. After her first year she moved to Piney Woods, Mississippi to begin her career. In the summers after starting there she attended West Virginia State College, University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison and the Hampton Institute, where she completed her bachelor's degree.

Laurence C. Jones, who founded the Piney Woods School in 1909, said of Foxx, \\"She ministered, not only to their intellectual needs, but to their moral and spiritual needs as well.\\" Jones described Foxx's relationship to her charges as like that of a mother. She taught students domestic skills, how to make mats and cane seating, and music. \\"She developed in all her students‚Äô self- reliance so that they could eagerly look forward to the time when they could support themselves out in the world,\\" Jones said. As early as 1920 music groups performed across the South and Eastern U.S. on tours to gain support for the school. Jones asked Foxx to help organize a blind quartet known as the Cotton Blossom Singers, who recorded for Alan Lomax in 1937, and after their graduation became famous as the nucleus of the Five Blind Boys of Mississippi. Foxx retired from her job as principal in 1969, saying \\"I've enjoyed everything connected with teaching. It has been my whole life\\". =Teaching methodology= Foxx‚Äôs teaching philosophy embraced a very modern dynamic of learning outside the walls of the classroom and of incorporating nature into lessons. She often took the children into the surrounding woods to hunt for plums and to pick wild berries. Ernestine Archie, a graduate of the school's first class of 1934, recalled Foxx‚Äôs determination that the visually handicapped students be allowed to enjoy outings just as the sighted students did and that their senses of touch, taste, sound and smell made up for the deficiency in sight. Archie recalled how the dynamic teacher also claimed that these forays into nature sharpened the blind students‚Äô \\"sixth sense,\\" honing their spirits as well as their minds. Utilizing what at the time were progressive techniques, Foxx taught her students to read Braille and special large-print books. = Honors and awards = Foxx received the 1942 Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) Drama Award, which came with a cash grant to fund fine arts instruction. In 1969, she was named Outstanding Teacher of the Year by the Mississippi Teachers Association. In 2013, she was inducted into the America Printing House for the Blind's Hall of Fame. In Rankin County, Mississippi, there is a historic marker about Foxx, placed in 2009 near the site of Piney Woods School. Personal life Martha Louise Morrow married Alexander Foxx in 1937.

A typical performance runs approximately 35 minutes. Movements The sonata consists of four movements: Mood and character The English pianist and Schubert specialist Imogen Cooper has described the G major sonata as \\"one of the rare completely serene sonatas that he wrote,\\" adding, \\"Of course, as ever with him, there are contrasting passages which become stormy and a little bit dark, but the overall mood is one of peace and luminosity, in a way that the G Major string quartet, written a few months before, was most definitely not\\". She noted further that \\"the last movement has tremendous wit in it ‚Äî and one or two moments of great poignancy, as if a cloud suddenly covered the sun, and then the sun comes out again\\".Imogen Cooper interview on BBC Radio 3, included in broadcast of Schubert piano recital on May 1, 2009 The opening theme of the third movement is remarkably similar to the second theme of the first movement of Schubert's second Piano Trio both in rhythm and in note progression. Peter Pesic commented on Donald Francis Tovey's observation that Schubert used a \\"circle of sixths\\" series of key signatures in the fourth movement of this sonata, in the sequence G ‚Üí E ‚Üí B = C ‚Üí G = A. Sviatoslav Richter stated that this was his favourite Schubert sonata.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVhxqEN9j7k#t=19m41s He is notable for his extremely slow interpretation of the first movement,Stephen Johnson reports on the 21-CD 'authorised' edition : \\"The first movement of Schubert's G major Sonata, D 894, is breathtakingly slow - the opening hardly seems to move at all. Richter's argument is that Schubert's marking, Molto moderato, refers to the quaver beat, not the dotted crotchet. In pure musicological terms, I don't imagine many Schubertians will be convinced, yet somehow Richter's concentrated, intensely absorbed playing persuaded me to suspend disbelief\\". and solemn account of the work, making the whole sonata usually last over 45 minutes in total.

She was built by the Oregon Shipbuilding Corporation of Portland, Oregon in 1942 with the hull number 580, and operated by United States Lines, New York City and homeported in Portland. For her role of sailing in dangerous waters, she was armed with one 5in, one 3in and four 20mm guns. She was named for the founder of East Portland. Sinking =Last voyage= She spent barely half a year in service, transporting goods for the Allies, from Port Said to the United States, via Suez and Durban. On her last sailing, in early 1943, she was carrying 1086 tons of bottles, medicine, propellers and personal effects. She was at Suez on 18 February, departing there for Durban. At just after 8 o'clock in the evening on 8 March James B. Stephens was travelling unescorted when she was spotted and torpedoed by U-160 commanded by Georg Lassen about northeast of Durban. Her Master, John Edward Green Jr., had been steaming a nonevasive course at a speed of . =Torpedoed= One torpedo struck on the port side of the James B. Stephens, impacting between the #2 and #3 hatches. The explosion ignited the fuel oil stored in the double bottoms and she began to rapidly sink by the bow. A second torpedo struck her ten minutes later which again hit her on the port side, this time by the #4 hatch, and this time broke the ship in two. Both sections remained afloat, but the ship was ablaze until the following morning. The eight officers, 35 crewmen and 20 members of the US Navy Armed Guards began to abandon ship after the first torpedo hit, striking out from the ship in four lifeboats and three rafts. The explosion of the second torpedo overturned the motor lifeboat and also blew three men from another boat into the water. The other lifeboats were able to pick up all of the men in the water, with the exception of one of the Armed Guards, Vane Irvin Vanderpool, who was not wearing a life jacket and could not swim, and who drowned before he could be rescued.U.S. Navy Armed Guard Killed and Wounded on U.S. and foreign ships during World War II On 11 March, an aircraft spotted one of the boats and directed the ASW naval trawler HMS Norwich City to it. 19 survivors were picked up by the trawler and transported to Durban. 30 survivors were later picked up by the light cruiser the next day and taken to Durban. The remaining 13 survivors were rescued six days after the attack by a South African Air Force crash boat one mile (1.6 km) off Durban, after they were spotted by another aircraft. =Aftermath= An Allied warship sank the stern section of the James B. Stephens with gunfire, and a British warship attempted to take the fore section in tow to Durban, but it sank whilst under tow in heavy seas. Of a total complement of 63, 62 had been rescued and only one was lost. The Boatswain, Edward F.

History  Developed by Sherman and Marian McClellan in 1969, the oscillator is computed using the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the daily ordinal difference of advancing issues (stocks which gained in value) from declining issues (stocks which fell in value) over 39 trading day and 19 trading day periods.  How it works  The simplified formula for determining the oscillator is: :Oscillator = (\\\\text{19-day EMA of advances minus declines}) - (\\\\text{39 day EMA of advances minus declines}) where advances is the number of the NYSE listed stocks which are traded above their previous day close and \\"declines\\" is the number of the NYSE listed stocks traded below their previous day close. * Difference between advances and declines shows whether we have more advancing or more declining stocks on the NYSE. Dominance of the advancing stocks is considered as bullish Breadth sentiment and higher number of declining stocks is considered as bearish Breadth sentiment * By applying 19-day and 39 day EMAs to the difference between advances and declines we define shorter-term (19-day) and longer-term (39-day) Breadth sentiment. * By calculating McClellan Oscillator as the difference between 19-day EMA and 39-day EMA of advances minus declines, we apply MACD principle to Breadth sentiment - to see changes in shorter-term Breadth sentiment. Therefore, crossovers of McClellan Oscillator and zero center around which it oscillates line would have following meaning: * When McClellan Oscillator crosses above zero line it tells us that \\"19-day EMA of advances minus declines\\" crossed above \\"39-day EMA of advances minus declines\\" which indicates that an increase in the number of advancing stocks on the NYSE Exchange is strong enough to consider it as a signal of possible up-move on the NYSE index. * When McClellan Oscillator crosses below zero line it tells us that \\"19-day EMA of advances minus declines\\" crossed below \\"39-day EMA of advances minus declines\\" which indicates that an increase in the number of declining stocks on the NYSE Exchange is strong enough to consider it as a signal of a possible down-move on the NYSE index.McClellan Oscillator in the MarketVolume's technical analysis reference guide  McClellan Summation Index  The McClellan Summation Index (MSI) is calculated by adding each day's McClellan oscillator to the previous day's summation index. By using the summation index of the McClellan oscillator, you can judge the markets overall bullishness or bearishness. MSI properties: * When above zero it is considered to be bullish (positive growth). * When below zero it is considered to be bearish (negative growth). The Summation index is oversold at ‚àí1000 to ‚àí1250 or overbought at 1000 to 1250.Illustrative description by McClellan Publications of the McClellan Oscillator The number of stocks in a stock market determine the dynamic range of the MSI. For the NZSX (one of the smallest exchanges in the English-speaking world) the MSI would probably range between (‚àí50 ... +50), the 19 and 39 constants (used for the US exchanges) would have to be revised. For the NZSX a MSI moving-average mechanism might be needed to smooth out the perturbations of such a small number of traded stocks.

In form, it is a prosimetrum, in which passages of prose alternate with verse passages in various classical meters. The philosophical basis of the work is the Platonism of contemporary philosophers associated with the cathedral school of Chartres‚Äîone of whom, Thierry of Chartres, is the dedicatee of the work. According to a marginal note in one early manuscript, the Cosmographia was recited before Pope Eugene III when he was traveling in France (1147‚Äì48).Peter Dronke, ed., Cosmographia, by Bernard Silvestris (Leiden: Brill, 1978), p. 2. Synopsis The work is divided into two parts: \\"Megacosmus\\", which describes the ordering of the physical universe, and \\"Microcosmus\\", which describes the creation of man. =Megacosmus= 1 (verse): Natura (Nature) complains to Noys (Divine Providence; Greek ) that Hyle (Primordial Matter; Greek ), although held in check by Silva (the Latin equivalent of hyle), is chaotic and unformed and asks that Noys impose order and form on the confused matter. 2 (prose): Noys reveals her status as the daughter of God and asserts that the time is right for Natura's plea to be granted. She then separates out the four elements of fire, earth, water, and air from primordial matter. Seeing that the results are good, she begets the World Soul, or Endelechia, as a bride for Mundus (World). Their marriage is the source of life in the universe. 3 (verse): This long poem in elegiac couplets presents the results of the ordering of the universe. Ether, the stars and sky, the earth, and the sea have become distinguished, and the nine orders of angels attend on the God who exists outside the universe. There follows a catalogue of the stars and constellations, along with the planets and their natures. Then the earth and its creatures are described, with catalogues of mountains, beasts, rivers, plants (which are treated in particular detail), fish, and birds. 4 (prose): The relationships between the powers operating in the universe are analyzed. All things under the heavens form part of a cosmic cycle, controlled by Natura, which will never cease, since its maker and cause are eternal. Hyle is the basis, whom the rational plan of God and Noys has ordered in an everlasting system, although subject to time: \\"For as Noys is forever pregnant of the divine will, she in turn informs Endelechia with the images she conceives of the eternal patterns, Endelechia impresses them upon Nature, and Nature imparts to Imarmene [Destiny; Greek ] what the well-being of the universe demands.\\"Winthrop Wetherbee, trans., The Cosmographia of Bernardus Silvestris (New York: Columbia UP, 1973), p. 90. =Microcosmus= 1 (prose): Noys displays the created universe to Natura and points out its various features. 2 (verse): With the work of Noys, Silva has recovered her true beauty. Noys (still speaking to Natura) declares herself proud of the harmony she has brought to the universe. 3 (prose): Noys says that for the completion of the cosmic design, the creation of man is needed. For this it is necessary that Natura seek out Urania (the celestial principle) and Physis (the material principle). Natura sets forth and searches through various regions of the heavens. When she reaches the outermost limit of the heavens, she encounters the Genius whose responsibility it is to delineate the celestial forms on the individual objects of the universe. He greets Natura and points out Urania, whose brightness dazzles Natura. 4 (verse): Urania agrees to descend to Earth and collaborate in the creation of man. She will take with her the human soul, guiding it through all the heavens so that it may become acquainted with the laws of fate and learn the rules that govern its behavior. 5 (prose): To gain the sanction of the divine powers, Natura and Urania travel outside the cosmos, to the sanctuary of the supreme divinity, Tugaton (the Good; Greek ), whose favor they pray for. They then descend, one by one, through the planetary spheres. 6 (verse): Having reached the lower boundary of the sphere of the Moon, where the quintessence meets the terrestrial elements, Natura pauses to look about her. 7 (prose): Natura and Urania see thousands of spirits. Urania tells Natura that, in addition to the angels who dwell beyond the created universe and in the heavenly spheres, there are spirits below the Moon‚Äîsome good, some evil. 8 (verse): Urania bids Natura to review the totality of the universe and note the principles of divine concord that it manifests. 9 (prose): Natura and Urania descend to Earth and reach a secluded locus amoenus (called Gramision or Granusion‚Äîthe readings of the manuscripts are disputed). There they meet Physis, accompanied by her daughters Theorica (Contemplative Knowledge) and Practica (Active Knowledge), who is rapt in contemplation of created life in all its aspects. Suddenly, Noys appears. 10 (verse): Noys explains that Natura, Urania, and Physis can collaborate to complete the creation by fashioning a creature who participates in both the divine and earthly realms. 11 (prose): Noys assigns Urania, Physis, and Natura specific tasks in the creation of man, providing a model for each. Urania, using the Mirror of Providence, is to provide him with a soul derived from Endelechia; Physis, using the Book of Memory, is to provide him with a body; and Natura, using the Table of Destiny, is to unite the soul and the body. 12 (verse): Natura summons her two companions to begin the work. Physis, however, is somewhat angry, since she sees that matter is ill-suited for the fashioning of a being that requires intellect. Urania assists her by eliminating the evil taint from Silva and containing the matter within definite limits. 13 (prose): Physis‚Äîmaking use of the imperfect aspects of Silva that had (somewhat uncertainly) submitted to the will of God and had been left over from the rest of creation‚Äîfashions a body. The four humors are described, along with the tripartite division of the body into the head (seat of the brain and the sensory organs), the breast (seat of the heart) and the loins (seat of the liver). 14 (verse): The powers of the senses and the brain, heart, and liver are detailed. The organs of generation will prevent human life from wholly passing away and the universe from returning to chaos. Platonic background The ultimate source for much of Bernardus' allegory is the account of creation in Plato's Timaeus, as transmitted in the incomplete Latin translation, with lengthy commentary, by Calcidius. This was the only work of Plato's that was widely known in western Europe during the Middle Ages, and it was central to the renewed interest in natural science among the philosophers associated with the school of Chartres: > Chartres ‚Ä¶ would long remain the fertile soil in which this conception [of > man as microcosm] would grow, and this the more as the Timaeus, itself > constructed upon the parallelism between microcosm and macrocosm, became a > central preoccupation of teaching at Chartres. This was the first age, the > golden age, of Platonism as such in the West, an age which found in the > Timaeus an entire physics, an anthropology, a metaphysics, and even a lofty > spiritual teaching.Marie-Domenique Chenu, \\"Nature and Man‚Äîthe Renaissance of > the Twelfth Century\\", in Nature, Man, and Society in the Twelfth Century, > trans. Jerome Taylor and Lester K. Little (Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1968), > p. 30. From the Timaeus Bernardus and the Chartrian thinkers, such as Thierry of Chartres and William of Conches, adopted three fundamental assumptions: \\"that the visible universe is a unified whole, a 'cosmos'; that it is the copy of an ideal exemplar; and that its creation was the expression of the goodness of its creator\\".Winthrop Wetherbee, Platonism and Poetry in the Twelfth Century: The Literary Influence of the School of Chartres (Princeton: Princeton UP, 1972), p. 30. Thierry had written a Tractatus de sex dierum operibus, in which he had essayed to elucidate the biblical account of creation \\"iuxta physicas rationes tantum\\" (\\"purely in terms of physical causes\\");Raymond Klibansky, \\"The School of Chartres\\", in Twelfth-Century Europe and the Foundations of Modern Society, ed. Marshall Claggett, Gaines Post, and Robert Reynolds (Madison: U of Wisconsin P, 1961), p. 8. and this perhaps accounts for Bernardus' dedication of the Cosmographia to Thierry. Along with the Timaeus and Calcidius' commentary, Bernardus' work also draws on Platonic themes diffused throughout a variety of works of late antiquity, such as Apuleius' philosophical treatises, Macrobius' commentary on Cicero's Dream of Scipio, the Hermetic Asclepius, the De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii of Martianus Capella, and Boethius' Consolation of Philosophy. In addition to their Platonic elements, the latter two works would have provided models of the prosimetrum form;F. J. E. Raby, A History of Secular Latin Poetry in the Middle Ages (Oxford: Oxford UP, 1934), vol. 2, p. 8. and Macrobius' commentary had authorized the use of allegorical (fabulosa) methods in philosophers' treatment of certain subjects, since \\"sciunt inimicam esse naturae apertam nudamque expositionem sui\\" (\\"they realize that a frank, open exposition of herself is distasteful to Nature\\").Macrobius, Commentarii in somnium Scipionis, ed. James Willis (Leipzig: Teubner, 1970), p. 7. The translation is that of William Harris Stahl in Macrobius, Commentary on the Dream of Scipio (New York: Columbia UP, 1952), p. 86. Reception That the Cosmographia survives, in whole or in part, in about fifty manuscriptsAndr√© Vernet, \\"Bernardus Silvestris et sa Cosmographia\\", √âcole nationale des chartes: Positions des th√®ses 1937 (Nogent-le-Rotrou, 1937), pp. 172‚Äì73. indicates that it enjoyed a good deal of popularity in the Middle Ages. Scholars have traced its influence on \\"a wide variety of medieval and renaissance authors, including Hildegard of Bingen, Vincent of Beauvais, Dante, Chaucer, Nicholas of Cusa, and Boccaccio‚Äîwhose annotated copy of the work we possess\\".Brian Stock, Myth and Science in the Twelfth Century: A Study of Bernard Silvester (Princeton: Princeton UP, 1972), p. 12. In particular, Bernardus' conceptions of Natura and Genius would be echoed and transformed in the works of Alain de Lille, in the Roman de la Rose, in Chaucer's Parlement of Foules, and in Gower's Confessio Amantis.See, passim, George D.

History Boundary Creek Bridge on the Wallaville railway line, 1920 Walla Provisional School opened circa 1883 and closed circa 1893. In 1887, of land were resumed from the Walla pastoral run. The land was offered for selection for the establishment of small farms on 17 April 1887. In 1896 the Gin Gin co- operative sugar mill opened at Wallaville. During the cane crushing season from July to December the population of the town doubled with an influx of mill workers and cane cutters. Wallaville State School opened on 22 November 1909. The Wallaville railway line was opened in 1920 and connected Wallaville with Goondoon on the Mount Perry railway line and then via North Bundaberg railway station to the North Coast railway line. The line was built to transport sugar cane and timber. In 1929, an existing cane train bridge over the Burnett River was converted to be suitable for use by cars. As well as being convenient for local use, it also allowed those travelling between Brisbane and Rockhampton to bypass Bundaberg, which shortened the journey by . It was funded by a local committee and was officially opened on 12 October 1929 by the Member for Burrum William Brand. The bridge proved popular but soon the maintenance costs become too much for the local volunteers to fund so in 1934 they sought financial assistance from the local Isis Shire Council. However, as the other side of the Burnett River was in the Kolan Shire, the Isis Shire Council sought to spread the cost across both shires. This lead in 1934 to a request to the Queensland Government to fund a new more permanent road bridge. While the issue of funding remained unresolved, the lack of maintenance was taking its toll with the bridge and its approaches being described as \\"a bit of a nightmare\\" with recommendations to drive via Bundaberg instead. The Queensland Government approved ¬£11,825 for the construction of a new bridge in September 1938; however, construction was delayed due to a shortage of steel. The bridge was finally opened on Saturday 11 May 1940 by Harry Bruce, the Queensland Minister for Public Works, who outlined his vision for a highway from Coolangatta to Cooktown (of which the present day Bruce Highway from Brisbane to Cairns forms the major part). The new Wallaville bridge was a low-level concrete bridge long (). On Sunday 5 June 1932 the Bishop of Rockhampton Romuald Denis Hayes consecrated a new Roman Catholic Church in Wallaville. In the 1950s, a new bulk sugar terminal was built without a rail link so sugar was transported from Wallaville by road instead of rail, leading to the closure of the railway in June 1964. The railway track was sold to the sugar mill to build cane tramways around Wallaville. The sugar mill closed in 1974 but the sugar cane was transported by rail to the Bingera sugar mill north of Bundaberg by connecting the Wallaville tramway network with those in the Bingera and Fairymead districts. Wallaville Bridge 1999 In the mid-1990s, a weir was proposed for the Burnett River approximately downstream of the Wallaville Bridge. Being a low-level bridge, the flooding of the Burnett River was already resulting in bridge closures of 2‚Äì3 days every 2‚Äì3 years and the higher river levels created by the weir would raise the river level to within a metre of the bridge deck, increasing the likelihood of closures due to flooding as well as accelerating the deterioration of the bridge itself due to the higher humidity levels under the bridge. If the proposed stage 2 of the weir proceeded (increasing the height of the weir by a further 2 metres), the bridge would be permanently underwater. Additionally the existing bridge was old and the geometry of its alignments were not of an acceptable standard for a major highway (there was a sharp bend on the southern side approach). The outcome was to recommend that a new high-level bridge be constructed upstream of the existing bridge. Construction commenced in December 1997. On 5 July 1999, the Tim Fischer Bridge was opened by the Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer. The bridge () and the associated new section of highway to access it cost $28 million.

Thus, based only on hearing, the sound can be determined to be in one of said locations, as opposed as to the left, or to the right. In stereo mixing of sound a phantom center is often created, by the use of panning. Even though there is no center speaker, vocals could appear to come from precisely between the two speakers, provided the listener is located in the sweet spot.

It was home to Gerrit Smith (1797-1874), a 19th-century social reformer, abolitionist, and presidential candidate, and his wife, Ann Carroll Fitzhugh. Smith established an early temperance hotel on his estate, and it was a widely known stop for escaped slaves on the Underground Railroad. The surviving elements of the estate were declared a National Historic Landmark in 2001. The estate is now managed by a nonprofit organization, and is open for tours from June to August. Description and history The Gerrit Smith Estate is located on the west side of the hamlet of Peterboro, on about of land (a remnant of what was once a estate) bounded by Peterboro Road, Oxbow Road, and Oneida Brook. The estate was, in its heyday, a virtual village unto itself, with as many as 30 buildings, including the mansion house, secondary residences, and a hotel. The property is today much reduced: its Federal period mansion was destroyed by fire in the 1930s, the hotel had a short-lived existence (1827-1859) before it was torn down on Gerrit Smith's orders, and numerous other outbuildings have also been demolished or lost to decay. The principal surviving buildings of historical significance that remain are the Peterboro Land Office with an attached smokehouse, designated on the National Register of Historic Places on its own, a 19th-century barn, and an adjacent building that was probably the laundry. The estate was established by Peter Smith, one of Madison County's early white settlers, in the early 19th century. Smith acquired a large tract of land from the Oneida people, with whom he had previously engaged in the fur trade. From this estate, he managed vast holdings of real estate (over all over the state), and lent his name to both the hamlet of Peterboro and the encompassing township of Smithfield. Smith's son Gerrit took over this business in 1819, and eventually applied the family wealth to a wide variety of progressive causes. Principal among these were the abolition of slavery and the temperance movement. Smith attempted unsuccessfully to make Peterboro a dry community, opening what is believed to be the first temperance hotel in the nation on the estate. The hotel was ultimately a failure, and Smith razed it in the late 1850s. The estate was also widely known as a safe haven for escaped slaves making the trek to Canada on the Underground Railroad, and was a meeting place for suffragist organizations.

She was the first female editor of the Chicago Tribune. He was the great-grandson of Joseph Medill, owner of the Chicago Tribune and mayor of Chicago. Patterson graduated from West Point in 1944. He served during World War II, achieving the rank of captain in the United States Army. In April 1944 his engagement was announced to Dorothy Marie Clarke (born May 4, 1922). They had first met in a grade school run by St. Augustine Catholic Church in Ossining. Her father was a prison guard at Sing Sing and he had 14 siblings. They were married on June 10, 1944 in the Catholic Church. In 1949 Patterson joined the Daily News as a reporter in the Washington, DC bureau. After working for nearly a decade in various positions, he became vice president and assistant managing editor of the Daily News in 1958. The couple never had children. They divorced in 1968.

Gamesville was acquired in 1999 by Web portal Lycos for $232 million in stock. Gamesville‚Äôs tagline was \\"Wasting your time since 1996\\".  History  Founded on a minimal capital base, Gamesville operated not just as a games provider but as a targeted marketing operation, offering free games and prizes to members as a way to attract large numbers of users while tailoring their proprietary games to meet the demands of advertisers. To play, members must provide demographic information; in turn, members would receive targeted ads based on the demographics provided. Gamesville pioneered the use of interstitial advertising as a method of monetizing game players. Gamesville's first game, The Bingo Zone, enabled hundreds of people to compete against one another in real time, for free, and win up to $20 by getting a bingo. Initially, Kane was skeptical of launching a free online bingo game because bingo is traditionally associated with the elderly rather than the prized demographics most advertisers seek. However, on the day Gamesville.com launched in April 1996, the Wall Street Journal ran a story about Gen Xers playing bingo in bars, and Kane is quoted as saying, \\"It was as if God had whispered to us.\\" Over the years, additional free games with cash prizes were added, including card, trivia, puzzle, and several bingo variants. This approach attracted many visitors: In August 1999, Gamesville.com was the \\"stickiest\\" site on the Internet with eBay in second place.  Lycos  In November 1999, internet portal Lycos announced that it would spend $270 million in stock to acquire Gamesville.com, which at that time had approximately 2.2 million registered users. Gamesville leveraged its relationship with Lycos to obtain the rights to produce the first (and to date, the only) online version of the popular television game show The Price Is Right in 2002 although the license was dropped after one year. In 2002, Monster.com profiled Gamesville's Rewards Manager, Josh Yeager, citing him as holding one of the Top 10 Coolest Jobs on the Internet. Yeager estimated that he sent out between 1,000 and 2,500 prize checks weekly, indicating that \\"some days I feel like the Bob Barker of the Internet, other days like Santa Claus himself.\\" There is in fact more truth to this statement than at first glance, as Gamesville, for a brief time in 2002, had hosted the exclusive Internet game rights to The Price Is Right. Over the years, Gamesville developed several games without prizes including a multiplayer online version of Spite and Malice and an online version of Spider Solitaire. Drifting away from its focus on prizes caused the number of visitors to Gamesville.com to slowly but steadily decline. Skilljam In an attempt to reinvigorate the Gamesville site, Lycos entered into a year-long integration with Skilljam starting in 2006; purportedly the integration was designed to provide premium \\"best in class skill and casual free games for cash prizes, combined with exclusive games content not available anywhere else\\" to Gamesville players. However, instead, the integration with Skilljam only hastened the decline in traffic to Gamesville. In April 2007, Lycos issued a public apology, announcing an end to the Skilljam partnership and a promise to return the site to its roots. The relaunch of the site included new premium games from WorldWinner and new download games provided by Oberon Media. A Tripod.com blog was also integrated into the site under the title \\"The Gamesville Blog\\". This blog is now powered by WordPress. After the relaunch of Gamesville, traffic to the site steadily increased, although not to its former heights. Notable products In March 2007, Gamesville launched Magic 21, a variant of blackjack, where multiple players compete to win a cash jackpot worth up to $4,999. The game is notable because it is the first proprietary jackpot game developed by Lycos/Gamesville since 2002's \\"The Price Is Right\\". In July 2007, Gamesville launched a new avatar system enabling users to create 2D representations of themselves for use in Gamesville games. Gamesville currently holds \\"best avatar\\" contests in the Gamesville Blog. On May 28, 2008, Gamesville relaunched Bingo Zone with a new design, a chat game called Dickie's Bonus Balls, and progressive cash prizes. Notable intellectual property Gamesville has several trademarks and patents in its portfolio, most notably US Patent 6,012,984, ‚ÄúSystems for providing large arena games over computer networks‚Äù.

A \\"tadbhava\\" is a word with an Indo-Aryan origin (and thus related to Sanskrit) but which has evolved through language change in the Middle Indo-Aryan stage and eventually inherited into a modern Indo-Aryan language. In this sense, tadbhavas can be considered the native (inherited) vocabulary of modern Indo- Aryan languages. Tadbhavas are distinguished from tatsamas, a term applied to words borrowed from Classical Sanskrit after the development of the Middle Indo-Aryan languages; tatsamas thus retain their Sanskrit form (at least in the orthographic form). This can be compared to the use of borrowed Classical Latin vocabulary in modern Romance languages. Both tadbhavas and tatsamas are also distinguished from de≈õi (\\"local\\") words, a term applied to words that have a non-Indo-Aryan source, typically Dravidian, Austro-Asiatic, or Tibeto- Burman. at pp. 67-69. In the modern context, the terms \\"tadbhava\\" and \\"tatsama\\" are applied to Sanskrit loanwords not only in Indo-Aryan languages, but also in Dravidian, Munda and other South Asian languages. at p. 272.  Tadbhavas in Indo-Aryan languages  Modern Indo-Aryan languages have two classes of words inherited from Sanskrit. The first covers words which have come to these languages from Old Indo-Aryan through Prakrit and Apabhra·πÉ≈õa; these are the inherited tadbhava words, showing an unbroken chain of language evolution from Old Indo-Aryan to the modern form. A second class of Sanskrit- derived words in modern Indo-Aryan languages covers words which have their origin in Classical Sanskrit and which were originally borrowed into Prakrit or Apabhra·πÉ≈õa as tatsamas but which, over the course of time, changed in form to fit the phonology of the recipient language; such words are often called ardhatatsamas or semi-tatsamas by modern linguists. These stand apart from the tatsamas, which are borrowings left relatively unchanged from Sanskrit. Tadbhava, tatsama and semi-tatsama forms derived from the same Indo-Aryan root sometimes coexist in modern Indo-Aryan languages. For example, the reflexes of in Bengali include Sanskrit borrowings in tatsama and semi-tatsama form in addition to the inherited tadbhava form . Similarly, Sanskrit exists in modern Hindi as a semi-tatsama and an inherited tadbhava form (via Prakrit ) in addition to the pure tatsama . In such cases, the use of tatsama forms in place of equivalent tadbhava or native forms is often seen by speakers of a language as a marker of a more chaste or literary form of the language as opposed to a more rustic or colloquial form. at p. 766. at p. 390. Often, however, a word exists only in one of the three possible forms, that is, only as a tadbhava, tatsama or semi-tatsama, or has different meanings in different forms. For example, reflexes of the Old Indo-Aryan word exists in Hindi both as a tatsama and as a tadbhava. However, the tatsama word means \\"heart\\" as in Sanskrit whereas the tadbhava means \\"courage\\". = Tadbhavas in Odia languages = Odia words are divided into native words (desaja), those borrowed from Sanskrit (tatasam) and those adapted with little modification from Sanskrit (tatbhaba). The 17th century dictionary Gitabhidhana by Upendra Bhanja, Sabda Tattva Abhidhana (1916) by Gopinath Nanda, Purnachandra Oriya Bhashakosha (1931) by GC Praharaj containing 185000 Words, Promoda Abhidan (1942) containing 150000 words by PC Deb and Damodara Mishar classified the Odia words as de≈õi, tatsama or tadbhava. Those Odia words are derived from Odia verbal roots, and the Odia verbal roots are derived from Sanskrit verbal roots; these Odia words are called Tatabhaba Krudanta words. For example, \\"kandana\\" is derived from Odia \\"dhatu kanda\\" which is derived from Sanskrit \\"kranda dhatu\\".  Tadbhavas in other South Asian languages  In the context of Dravidian, Austro-Asiatic, and Tibeto-Burman languages of South Asia, the terms \\"tatsama\\" and \\"tadbhava\\" are used to describe words which have been borrowed from Sanskrit either unmodified (\\"tatsama\\") or modified (\\"tadbhava\\"). Tadbhava as used in relation to these languages, therefore, corresponds more accurately with the categories of tatsama and semi-tatsama used in relation to the vocabulary of modern Indo-Aryan languages. All Dravidian languages contain a proportion of tadbhava and tatsama words, possibly exceeding over half of the vocabulary of literary Kannada, Telugu and Malayalam, with Tamil being less Sanskritised. Because of their non-Indo-Aryan origin, the native, inherited vocabulary of Dravidian, Austro-Asiatic, and Tibeto-Burman languages of South Asia would be classified as \\"de≈õi\\".

To date it has not been officially released outside Japan, although it has been unofficially subtitled in English and German and released on DVD with Region 0 coding. TOKYO 10+01 is heavily influenced by the 2000 Japanese film Battle Royale, to which it makes numerous references. The plot involves eleven strangers who are forced to play a game with a set time limit or face death. Each assigned a number from 1 through 11, they are fitted with bracelets containing poisonous hypodermic needles as opposed to Battle Royale's explosive collars. Whenever a player dies, a death announcement naming them and stating how many players remain is flashed onscreen. Two actors who respectively portrayed characters in both Battle Royale and its 2003 sequel, Battle Royale II: Requiem, also appear in TOKYO 10+01: Masanobu And≈ç, who played the character Kazuo Kiriyama in Battle Royale, and Natsuki Kato, who played the character Saki Sakurai in Battle Royale II. Kato's appearance alongside Ando in this regard is largely coincidental however, as Battle Royale II was released eleven months after TOKYO 10+01. Plot In Neo Tokyo in 2XXX A.D., eleven strangers, each with various criminal backgrounds, awaken in a deserted warehouse where they are confronted by the mysterious Mr. K, the manager of the Black Papillon Foundation. They are told that they have been brought together to participate in a game conceived of by The Baron, the leader of the organization, in which they have to reach his mansion within eleven hours. The reward for this is 300 million yen and the chance to start their lives over by also expunging their criminal records. Each participant is fitted with a bracelet on their left wrists which has a timer indicating how much time is left in the game, and an alarm system. The latter is triggered when \\"hunters\\", who work for the Black Papillon Foundation and are armed with non-lethal laser guns which will knock the participants out of the game when they are shot, come within 50 meters. The bracelets also contain hypodermic needles which will inject the wearers with a lethal poison if they attempt to take the bracelets off or time runs out, thus forcing them all to play the game or face death. Mr. K's black butterfly tattoo on his left wrist, which all of The Baron's children have. This is also the logo of the Black Papillon Foundation, and is featured in the film's title sequence. Unarmed and after being divided into three teams, the game starts. The first indication that things are not what they seem occurs shortly into the game when Big Mac is shot and killed by some hunters, revealing that the players must now try to survive against opponents with real firearms. The three teams then split up and pursue separate routes. Fake manages to get hold of a gun that Snake stole from a hunter and thus take control of his team. The team of Jingi, Oolong and Jasmine encounters hunters after emerging from a tunnel, whom they fight and defeat, but are also killed. Ace, Micro, and Tall succeed in hotwiring a car thanks to Micro's technical expertise, but Ace is killed by a hunter. Fake decides to kill a member of his team, but the arrival of some hunters and Coco's quick thinking result in his apparent demise, while Prince is shot and falls to his death. Micro meanwhile succeeds in deactivating the dead Ace's bracelet, revealing a black butterfly tattoo on his wrist that both he and Tall also have. Hunters soon arrive however and kill them during an ensuing car chase. Coco and Snake manage to evade additional hunters, but Coco is wounded. With less than an hour left in the game and when the two are alone, she reveals why she hates men, but that she is glad that men like Snake exist. She gives him her compact as a token of remembrance before taking a bullet meant for him fired by Fake. Snake then confronts Fake with the revelation that except for him (Snake), all of the participants in the game have a black butterfly tattoo on their wrists, marking them as The Baron's children although they had different mothers. Fake is soon killed by a hunter and after slipping his bracelet off, Snake reaches The Baron's mansion as the last player left. Here he is greeted by Mr. K, and it is revealed that the two colluded in order to enable Mr. K to take over the Black Papillon Foundation, while Snake would be delivered the man with a crescent-shaped scar on his forehead who killed his parents years ago. Believing this man to be The Baron, Snake confronts him only to find him dead and no scar on his forehead. Mr. K then shoots Snake and reveals that he himself is also one of The Baron's children, making him the eleventh player in the game and explaining the film's title. Mr. K rigged the game set up by his father by adding actual deaths as a factor to kill off his siblings, and he also turns out to be the very man with the crescent-shaped scar who Snake seeks vengeance against. Mr. K then apparently shoots and kills Snake. Snake however, survives his wounds and later that night infiltrates a bizarre costume party that Mr. K is attending. He confronts and kills Mr. K, revealing that his life was saved by Coco's compact which he had in his jacket pocket and deflected a potentially fatal bullet just before he himself is shot and killed by Mr. K's bodyguards.

Kriaras (Greek: ŒïŒºŒºŒ±ŒΩŒøœÖŒÆŒª Œì. ŒöœÅŒπŒ±œÅŒ¨œÇ; 28 November 1906 ‚Äì 22 August 2014) was a Greek lexicographer and philologist. He was Emeritus Professor of the School of Philosophy at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. He was a student of Jean Psychari and the practice and ideology of demotic Greek. Early life and education Kriaras was born in Piraeus in Attica, Greece in 1906 to a family of Cretan origin and spent his early childhood on the island of Milos, the southwesternmost of the Cyclades. In 1914 his family moved to Chania, Crete, where he completed his secondary education. He studied at the University of Athens from 1924, where he graduated from the School of Philosophy in 1929. Professional life Kriaras worked in the medieval archives of the Academy of Athens, where he started in 1930. He was appointed principal in 1939. While working at the Academy he carried out post-graduate research, his work included periods in Munich (1930) and Paris (1945He moved to France in December 1945 along with many other Greek intellectuals on the RMS Mataroa voyage.‚Äì1948). Some of his research was on Erot√≥kritos the early 17th century romantic epic which represents the high point of renaissance literature in Crete. This work was published in 1938 as Essays concerning the sources of Erot√≥kritos (ŒúŒµŒªŒµœÑŒÆŒºŒ±œÑŒ± œÄŒµœÅŒØ œÑŒ±œÇ œÄŒ∑Œ≥Œ¨œÇ œÑŒøœÖ ŒïœÅœâœÑŒøŒ∫œÅŒØœÑŒøœÖ) for which he was awarded his doctorate by the University of Athens. In 1950 he was elected to the chair of Medieval Greek Philology at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. In addition to the main courses on his subject, he taught medieval Greek history and modern Greek philology until 1968 when his political views resulted in his dismissal by the right wing military junta. His writings cover a wide field. Probably his most important work has been the Lexicon of Medieval Greek Demotic Literature 1100-1669 (ŒõŒµŒæŒπŒ∫œå œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒºŒµœÉŒ±ŒπœâŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒÆœÇ ŒµŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒÆœÇ Œ¥Œ∑ŒºœéŒ¥ŒøœÖœÇ Œ≥œÅŒ±ŒºŒºŒ±œÑŒµŒØŒ±œÇ 1100-1669), published since 1968 and now supplemented with a 2-volume condensed edition. In 1997 he entrusted his medieval lexicon and its associated archives to the Centre for the Greek Language (Thessaloniki). His Greek Dictionary of the Modern Demotic Language, Written and Oral (ŒùŒ≠Œø ŒµŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫œå ŒªŒµŒæŒπŒ∫œå œÑŒ∑œÇ œÉœçŒ≥œáœÅŒøŒΩŒ∑œÇ ŒµŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒÆœÇ Œ¥Œ∑ŒºŒøœÑŒπŒ∫ŒÆœÇ Œ≥ŒªœéœÉœÉŒ±œÇ, Œ≥œÅŒ±œÄœÑŒÆœÇ Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÄœÅŒøœÜŒøœÅŒπŒ∫ŒÆœÇ) (1995) is the most authoritative modern Greek monolingual dictionary. Kriaras worked on, and promoted research in, the problems related to medieval and modern Greek philology, lexicography and comparative grammatology, with his heart in the demotic language and the movements connected with its promotion. In 2006, in recognition of his work and to mark his 100th birthday, he was awarded the \\"Golden Aristotle\\" by the University of Thessaloniki. Death Kriaras died on August 22, 2014 in Thessaloniki, Greece from a heart attack, aged 107.

It would allow tax credits for education expenses. On February 15, 2007, Rep. Paul introduced the Act again in the House, this time with an initial three co-sponsors, Tom Feeney (R-FL), Bobby Rush (D-IL), and Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI). The bill was designated H.R. 1056 and was referred to the Ways and Means Committee. The bill has since gained three more co-sponsors, Roscoe Bartlett (R-MD), Patrick McHenry (R-NC), and Jeff Miller (R-FL). Summary of bill The bill says that it will \\"amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow individuals a credit against income tax for tuition and related expenses for public and nonpublic elementary and secondary education.\\" The tax credit was originally $3,000 in past versions of the bill, and in 2007 the proposed tax credit was increased to $5,000 per child in school. While the tax credit could be used to pay private school tuition, it could also be used for any school-related expenses for those whose children attend public school or donate to extracurricular activities or for those whose child attends home school. Qualified expenses would include tuition or fees, a personal computer, books, supplies, or transportation. History Paul noted when introducing the bill originally that the state of Arizona had introduced similar tax credits, and the state found that it had increased resources available for education as a result. He said, \\"The Arizona experience is further proof that putting control of education resources into the hands of the American people through education tax credits is the best way to improve education. Tax credits allow parents and other concerned citizens to devote more of their resources to education, and allow the American people to work with educators to ensure that all children have the opportunity to receive a quality education that suits each child's unique needs.\\" The bill has been introduced in what Congressman Paul has described as the \\"Education Freedom Package,\\" along with the Education Improvement Tax Cut Act, which would allow a $3,000 credit for donations to schools or scholarship programs, and the Teacher Tax Cut Act, which would allow a $1,000 tax deduction to be taken by all teachers. The bill has been referred to as \\"pro-homeschool,\\" and the Home School Legal Defense Association has \\"strongly lobbied\\" for and endorsed the bill in 2003, 2001 and as far back as 1997. In 1999, the Minnesota Libertarian Party announced plans to pass a Minnesota version of the bill as part of an announced legislative agenda. As part of his 2008 presidential campaign, Paul said that if elected President, he would pass the Family Education Freedom Act. Past versions Paul introduced this bill in other versions in other sessions of Congress. *105th Congress: H.R. 1816 *106th Congress: H.R. 935 *107th Congress: H.R. 368 (2001) Introduced January 31, 2001 :This version was co-sponsored by Bartlett, Charlie Norwood (R-GA), and Bob Schaffer (R-CO). *108th Congress: H.R. 612 (2003) Introduced February 5, 2003, referred to Ways and Means *109th Congress: H.R. 406 (2005) :This version was initially co- sponsored by Bartlett, Tom Tancredo (R-CO), Sensenbrenner, Marilyn Musgrave (R-CO), and Mario D√≠az-Balart (R-FL)Family Education Freedom Act of 2005 and eventually gained 10 co-sponsors.

The family name was changed to Cossgrove shortly after this. Throughout David Cossgrove's formative years, he was educated at Tokomairiro, while his father ran a flax mill at Akatore. After completing teacher training at the East Taieri School, Cossgrove taught at Sandymount School, on the Otago Peninsula between 1874 and 1880. He was responsible for a rising roll and introducing elementary science to the curriculum.Sandymount School, Centennial of Inauguration 1870‚Äì1970 (Pamphlet) While teaching at Sandymount, he married Selina/Celina Robertson in February 1875 in the Otago Peninsular Parish, Dunedin.

Biography = Early life, family background, and education = She was born on September 25, 1930, in Warsaw, Poland, where her father, Vicomte Bertrand Jochaud du Plessix, was a French diplomat ‚Äì the commercial attach√©. She spent her early years in Paris, where a milieu of mixed cultures and a multilingual family (French father and Russian mother) influenced her. Her father, then a sub-lieutenant in the Free French Air Force died in 1940, shot down near Gibraltar. Her mother, Tatiana Iacovleff du Plessix, (1906‚Äì1991) had come to France as a refugee from Bolshevik Russia, and ended an engagement to Vladimir Mayakovsky in 1928, before marrying du Plessix. During her widowhood, she once again became a refugee, escaping occupied France via Lisbon to New York in 1940 or 1941 with Francine and Alexander Liberman (1912‚Äì1999). In 1942, she married Liberman, another White Russian √©migr√©, whom she had known in Paris as a child. (During his love affair with Liberman's mother, her uncle, Alexandre Yacovleff, had recruited Tatiana to keep the boy occupied.) He was a noted artist and later a longtime editorial director of Vogue magazine and then of Cond√© Nast Publications. The Libermans were socially prominent in media, art and fashion circles. For the first six months in the United States, young Francine lived with her mother's father (whom she had never met) in Rochester, New York, while her mother settled in. She grew up in New York City and was naturalized a U.S. citizen in 1952. She was a scholarship student at Spence School, where she fainted in the library from malnutrition. Her mother learned that she had not been eating the meals the housekeeper prepared for her. She attended Bryn Mawr College for two years, and earned a B.A. in philosophy at Barnard College in 1952.

It is the first musical society in Luqa, founded in 1880.  History  = Early years = In 1880 Mro. Vincezo Camilleri founded the l'Unione Philharmonic Society known as L-Banda Unjoni. Mro. Camilleri lived in the village of Luqa and he was a musician by profession. He was married to a Luqa girl named Maria Grazzja n√©e Fava and had five children. On Mro. Camilleri's own initiative he gathered a number of youths in Luqa and started to teach them music and how to play an instrument. This was the birth of the first musical organisation in Luqa. It was in this year that Mro. Vincenzo Camilleri composed the first musical piece called Marcia L'Unione 1880. In 1883 when Mro. Vincenzo Camilleri was satisfied that the young guys he taught music were ready to go public, he retired and left the direction of the band in the hands of his son Mro. Gavino Camilleri. From there onwards, the society grew and became strong establishing itself as one of the best philharmonic societies in Malta. In 1930, the society celebrated its 50 years since its foundation. = War and post-war years = Unfortunately during World War II the activities of the band were suspended. Malta was heavily bombarded by Axis forces during the war, and the village of Luqa was targeted due to its proximity to RAF Luqa, one of Malta's main airfields. The premises of L'Unione Philharmonic Society were destroyed by aerial bombardment, resulting in the loss of many riches, including historic documents and music scores. After the war life at the village of Luqa slowly returned to normal and the society began its activities again. The band got up on its feet again and it quickly re-established itself in the Maltese musical arena. The society also was growing in the manufacturing of pyrotechnics and it was gaining a good reputation in the pyrotechnic art. The St. Andrews Fireworks Factory was established as part of the L'Unione Philharmonic Society and the factory had very able men who were highly talented in the art of fireworks. In 1980 the society celebrated its 100 years of existence. A number of celebrations were carried out to mark this important event. It was also the year when the current conductor took the baton for the band. = 1997 - The year the Society went international = It was November 1997 when the band left the island of Malta to go to Amalfi in Italy to perform. This was the first time the l'Unione Philharmonic Society performed outside Malta. The society took active part in the celebrations of the feast of St. Andrew. The feast of St. Andrew is solemnly celebrated in Amalfi. The band played at the start of the procession, during the procession and at the end. The interesting part of the event was the merry band march executed in streets of Amalfi at the early hours of the morning to announce to the people that it was the feast of St. Andrew. The band also performed a musical concert in the evening at a church in Amalfi. On the same journey the band attended an audience with the pope, the late John Paul the Second and played inside sala Nervi for the pope. The pope was so delighted that he invited the band near him on the stage. The band also played in Piazza San Pietro at the Vatican. =Present day= In 2005 the Society celebrated its 125 years of existence and for the occasion there were a number of celebrations. The Society publicized a book on its history through the years. This was published in Maltese and its title was Hal Luqa u L-Banda taghha L-Unjoni. The author is Francis Galea, a renowned Maltese writer and history researcher. In 2007 and 2014 the St. Andrew Fireworks Factory won the Maltese Ground Fireworks competition. In 2014 the St. Andrew Fireworks Factory also won the National (aerial) Fireworks Festival making it a double win in just a few days and adding more honours to the Society. This day the Society has around 50 of its own musicians, reared and thought by the music teachers of the society. Around 12 of those 50 have an age range between 12 years and 16 years. There is also a good number of students learning to play to eventually join the society in the near future. Recently the Maltese Archbishop Emeritus, His Excellency Paul Cremona, paid a visit to our society. It was a memorable event where His Excellency was impressed how much the society developed in its 126 years of existence. The Archbishop's great grandfather, Vincenzo Cremona, was one of the earliest presidents. To mark this event a bust of Vincenzo Cremona was unveiled by the Archbishop and his father in the presence of the Archbishop's family and the members of the society. In 2017 the Union Philharmonic Society, produced a marvelous concert at the President's Palace in San Anton. In the closing speech, President Marie Louise Coleiro Preca stated that the Union Philharmonic Society, \\"makes an honour not only to the village of Luqa but also the Maltese Islands.\\" Society's Presidents *Vincenzo Camilleri (Founder) (1880-1883) *Nikola Sammut (1883-1899) *Vincenzo Cremona (1899-1900) *Nikola Sammut (1900-1923) * Joseph Azzopardi (1923-1942) *Joe Azzopardi (1942-1947) *James Ciappara (1947-1949) *John Azzopardi (1949-1953) *Joseph Mary Azzopardi (1953-1957) *Noe' Spiteri (1957‚Äì1960) *Carmel Spiteri (1960‚Äì1965) *George Borg (1965-1971) *Saviour Schembri (1971‚Äì1989) *Innocent Camilleri (1989‚Äì1993) *Salvu Spiteri (1993-2001) *Noel Camilleri (2001‚Äì2014) *Joseph Piscopo (2014‚ÄìPresent) Principal Conductors *Vincenzo Camilleri (1880-1883) *Gavino Camilleri (1883-1889) *Geatano Grech (1889-1904) *Orlando Crescimanno (1904-1912) *Emanuel Spiteri (1913-1920) *Vincenzo Costa (1920-1921) *Salvatore Mallia (1921-1937) *Joseph Casapinta (1937-1938) *Charles Xuereb (1938-1945) *Joseph Ablea Scolaro (1945‚Äì1979) *Charles Zammit (1979‚Äì2010) *John David Zammit (2010‚Äìpresent) References *  External links  *L'Unione Philharmonic Society official website Maltese musical groups Musical groups established in 1880 1880 establishments in Malta Luqa ","title":"Unione Philharmonic Society"},{"id":"13258797","text":"Thinking Maps are a set of techniques used in primary and secondary education (\\"K-12\\"). There are eight diagram types that are intended to correspond with eight different fundamental thinking processes. They are supposed to provide a common visual language to information structure, often employed when students take notes. Thinking Maps are visual tools for learning, and include eight visual patterns each linked to a specific cognitive process. Teachers may apply Thinking Maps in all content areas and all grade levels. The eight map types are: ; Circle Map: used for defining in context ; Bubble Map: used for describing with adjectives ; Flow Map: used for sequencing and ordering events ; Brace Map: used for identifying part/whole relationships ; Tree Map: used for classifying or grouping ; Double Bubble Map: used for comparing and contrasting ; Multi-flow map: used for analyzing causes and effects ; Bridge map: used for illustrating analogies By linking each thinking skill to a unique and dynamic visual representation, the language of Thinking Maps becomes a tool set for supporting effective instructional practice and improving student performance. Teachers and students, therefore, independently apply thinking skills for their own learning while also having a common visual language for cooperative learning. By having a rich language of visual maps based on thinking processes, learners are no longer confused by poorly organized brainstorming webs or an endless array of static graphic organizers. They are enabled to move from concrete to abstract concepts, think with depth, and directly apply their thinking to complex tasks.  General information  Thinking Maps are a specific set of graphic thinking organizers used in K-12 classroom settings, or \\"visual teaching tools that foster and encourage life- long learning,\\" as well as a tool that provide students with the skills to be \\"successful thinkers, problem solvers, [and] decision makers\\" (Thinking Maps Inc., Pamphlet). What Dr. Mark Davidson says is that the \\"one common instructional thread that binds together all teachers, from prekindergarten through postgraduate, is that they all teach the same thought processes\\" (Thinking Maps Inc., Pamphlet). For example, the thought process of classification might be taught in kindergarten by sorting or grouping, whereas classification in the upper grades might be taught as categorizing a main idea and details. Although we refer to classifying items, concepts, or ideas in different ways with different aged students, the thought process in its entirety is considered classification. With this belief that all teachers, no matter the grade level, teach the same thought processes, these common set of visual organizers was created by Dr. David Hyerle as a type of language to be used across grade levels, content areas, and disciplines so that \\"students could learn more effectively and more efficiently.\\" Thinking Maps were also created so that these graphic organizers would \\"become a familiar part of students' education that it would remain an effective learning tool throughout their academic careers ‚Äì and beyond\\" (Thinking Maps Inc., Pamphlet).  History  In 1970, Innovative Sciences, Inc. (ISI) was founded by Charles Adams in order to \\"improve the thinking and problem-solving abilities of the work force\\" (Thinking Maps, Inc., 2011). Over the next eighteen years, ISI created a variety of developmentally appropriate materials, or \\"content-based thinking skills,\\" for schools based on research from student reading performance and different educational teaching models (Thinking Maps, Inc., 2011). In 1988, David Hyerle wrote Expand Your Thinking, which was the first resource where his Thinking Maps were published, and at that point, he began training educators to use his Thinking Maps (Thinking Maps, Inc., 2011). In 1994, test results indicated that \\"Thinking Maps significantly affect[ed] standardized and qualitative measures of student performance\\" (Thinking Maps Inc., 2011). After more success and schools nationwide piloting Thinking Maps, ISI changed its name to Thinking Maps, Inc. in 2004 to \\"better promote its mission\\" (Thinking Maps, Inc., 2011). Today, thousands of teachers across America have been trained in using and implementing Thinking Maps in their classrooms. Thinking Maps are also being promoted in the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia (Thinking Maps, Inc., 2011).  Educational theory  In his text Curriculum as Conversation, Applebee (1996) states that a \\"curriculum provides domains for conversation, and the conversations that take place within those domains are the primary means for teaching and learning. Through such conversations, students will be helped to enter into culturally significant traditions of knowledge-in-action\\" (p. 37). When looking at Applebee's (1996) ideas of \\"knowledge-in-action\\" and social learning, a connection with Hyerle's Thinking Maps is apparent. When students produce Thinking Maps, conversations among the students and their Maps occur, which is where the real learning takes place. Students are able to \\"illustrate\\" and explain their thought processes through Maps, while other students listen, ask questions, agree and/or disagree. Social learning starts when the teacher realizes that his or her classroom needs to be based on a learning community of able and willing learners, where each student has a vital role in the everyday learning by participating and adding to the conversation, which is where Thinking Maps can aid, scaffold, and support. Moffitt's theory of integrated language arts is widely seen through the use of Thinking Maps. Thinking Maps are products of reading, writing, listening, and speaking, and the aspects of listening and speaking are parts of the thinking processes that students use to explain themselves. Although the same eight Thinking Maps are used across grade levels, the Maps are developmentally appropriate for each age and coincide with Moffitt's developmental principle. In second grade, a teacher may use the Flow Map to sequence the stages and life cycle of a butterfly, while a high school chemistry teacher may use the same map to sequence the changing of an element from the periodic table. One teacher uses the map to illustrate a concrete idea, while another teacher uses the map to illustrate an abstract idea. When looking at the overarching theories of education, Thinking Maps fall into the Postmodern Constructivism theory. In the Postmodern Constructivism theory of education, learners often use their prior experiences, and when using one of the eight fundamental thought processes and Thinking Maps, learners often do use their background knowledge to continue constructing new meaning and knowledge (Sherman, 2000). Students are also encouraged to create and form their own opinions after self- reflection and creating Thinking Maps, as well as to engage and discuss their individual maps with their peers, even if their ideas differ. Another aspect of the Postmodern Constructivism theory of education that is seen by the use of Thinking Maps is that they promote critical thinking and problem solving (Sherman, 2011).  Research and rationales  In his book Student Successes With Thinking Maps, Dr. David Hyerle (2011) provides a plethora of reasons and research as to why Thinking Maps are beneficial tools for the classroom. Hyerle states that using the eight Thinking Maps promote metacognition and continuous cognitive development for students across their academic careers, as well as adds an artistic and kinesthetic component for students who learn effectively with that specific multiple intelligence (Hyerle, 2011). Lesson objectives can be covered in less time and with greater retention when using Thinking Maps, teachers can determine their students' background knowledge before teaching a unit or area of study, and student performance can be tracked over time in an accurate manner, too (Thinking Maps, Inc., 2011). Through his research, Dr. Hyerle (2011) also found that Thinking Maps help close the achievement gap, as they \\"can help students [below grade level] self-regulate their own learning and be more successful in the game of school because Thinking Maps serve as a device for mediating thinking, listening, speaking, reading, writing, problem solving, and acquiring new knowledge.\\" The thought processes that educators hope to instill in students are represented similarly throughout the curricula, and integrated thinking and learning across disciplines is promoted (Thinking Maps, Inc., 2011). As fidelity and accountability are also huge aspects in the education field, the idea that Thinking Maps as a school-wide initiative for use of a common instructional and learning tool and as a shared language among teachers and students is one of Hyerle's (2011) main ideas for the use of this support curriculum. In Villalon and Calvo's (2011) Concept Maps as Cognitive Visualizations of Writing Assignments, concept maps are discussed as a means of scaffolding university-aged students' ideas in writing, as well as their metacognitive skills. In their study, Villalon and Calvo evaluated a new Concept Map Mining tool, which was used in an \\"e-learning environment\\" that automatically generated maps using students' written work (p. 16). The Concept Map Mining tool was used to look at a collection of annotated essays written by undergraduate college students (p. 16). Villalon and Calvo (2011) found that \\"Cognitive Visualizations [such as Concept Map Mining] provide quality feedback because they make the author's thinking visible, making explicit the mental model learners are using‚Ä¶Within the writing process, providing automatic feedback in the form of [Cognitive Visualizations] allows learners to reflect on their own work and their own mental models that guided its construction, facilitating the development of metacognitive skills\\" (p. 23). Villalon and Calvo's (2011) study illustrates that the use of concept maps are beneficial to even the oldest of learners in a college setting, and although precise Thinking Maps were not used in this study, the idea of a graphic organizer to \\"map out\\" thought processes is universal. In Thinking with Maps, Elisabeth Camp (2007) investigates how individuals think and how thinking is related to language. Camp (2007) states that \\"‚Ä¶thinking in maps is substantively different from thinking in sentences\\" (p. 155). This concept supports Hyerle's (2011) idea that Thinking Maps possess an artistic and kinesthetic component, where students can feel free to express their ideas in a \\"drawing,\\" or map, instead of using complete written sentences. Thinking Maps support learners who thrive with the artistic and kinesthetic multiple intelligences of learning. David Hyerle (1996) reports numerous success stories with the use of Thinking Maps in his article Thinking Maps: Seeing is Understanding. After teachers participated in a year-long professional development in the use and purpose of Thinking Maps, as well as integrated the maps into their curriculum during this training year, the \\"teachers agreed that the maps had successfully helped students develop their thinking processes and their ability to organize ideas, improved the quality and quantity of their writing, and also motivated them to learn. Further, the maps benefited the teachers by helping them organize content and assess student learning\\" (p. 88). Hyerle (1996) also reported that the educators who gave Thinking Maps the highest ratings at the end of the year were those who taught English Learners (Spanish-speaking students), as Thinking Maps \\"enabled their students to transfer patterns of thinking from Spanish into English, to focus on learning, and to build vocabulary\\" (p. 88). In Designs of Concept Maps and Their Impacts on Readers' Performance in Memory and Reasoning While Reading, Jeng-Yi Tzeng (2010) investigates the effect of Thinking Maps on students' performance of \\"cognitive operations.\\" In the study, Tzeng had students read two opposing history articles that \\"argued from different perspectives about a historical incident\\" that occurred in Taiwan (p. 133). The results of the study indicated that the focus and design of the concept maps may \\"influence the formation of mental representations, and that this may be facilitative or constraining in regard to the readers' memory formation and reasoning about the reading materials.\\" With regards to the maps' designs, Tzeng uncovered that this can impact a student's memory and/or understanding of a text, which poses as a negative aspect of the maps themselves. In conclusion, by linking each thinking skill to a unique and dynamic visual representation, the language of Thinking Maps becomes a tool set for supporting effective instructional practice and improving student performance. Teachers and students, therefore, independently apply thinking skills for their own learning while also having a common visual language for cooperative learning. By having a rich language of visual maps based on thinking processes, learners are no longer confused by poorly organized brainstorming webs or an endless array of static graphic organizers. They are enabled to move from concrete to abstract concepts, think with depth, and directly apply their thinking to complex tasks. See also  References  * Applebee, A. N. (1996).

The documents were collected and published in Paris in the 19th century, and include documents in Latin, Greek, Arabic, Old French, and Armenian.Recueil des historiens des Croisades publi√© par les soins de l'Acad√©mie des inscriptions et belles-lettres, 16 vols (Paris: Imprimerie royale, 1841-1906). The documents cover the entire period of the Crusades, and are frequently cited in scholarly works, as a way of locating a specific document. When being quoted in citations, the collection is often abbreviated as RHC or R.H.C.. Images of the documents can be viewed in some major libraries. The 1967 reprint of the entire collection by Gregg Press can also be found in major libraries, and there are also full-text PDF files available online, which have been made available by the Biblioth√®que Nationale de France Gallica project. Documents can be downloaded in their entirety, or stepped through page by page, with both the original text, and a French translation.  Presentation  According to the introductory ReportRapport sur la publication du Recueil des historiens des croisades, 1844 (read on Gallica). to the first volume of the Western Historians, this collection brings up to date the previous collection published in 1611 by Jacques Bongars under the title Gesta Dei per Francos,Catalogue BnF. due to \\"the discovery of many literary and historical monuments which Bongars could not have suspected the existence\\", including those published in the collections of Duchesne, Archery, Mabillon, Mart√®ne and many other foreign compilers. The editors of this collection have chosen to consider 1291 as the end date of the Crusades, since the fall of Saint-Jean-d'Acre completed the ruin of Christian institutions in Palestine. So historians posterior to the middle of the fourteenth century are not included. Were also excluded works more literary than historical, like novels on the Crusades, and also the narration related to the conquest of Constantinople by the French and the Venetians, because they did take almost no part in the events of Palestine. Neither was included Joinville's Histoire, because the commission of the Acad√©mie des inscriptions et belles-lettres did class this author among France's general historians.

Through their thirty years in the recording industry, the group has affiliated with at least ten different record labels. Fredrick formed the band in 1987 after earning his Ph.D. in English from University of California, Santa Barbara. After recording St. Valentine and releasing it on eskimo, Fredrick's own label, violinist J'Anna Jacoby joined the group and the two of them formed the nucleus of the band until she left the group in 2003. The Black Watch has recorded and toured consistently throughout its history except for a brief period in 1997 when the band broke up. During this hiatus, Fredrick wrote The King of Good Intentions, a semi-autobiographical novel about an indie rock band. The band recorded a CD of the same title intended as a companion piece to the novel, although the planned publication of the novel was cancelled when the publisher folded. In 2008, guitarist and singer Steven Schayer (formerly of the Los Angeles band Clay Idols, and New Zealand band The Chills) joined, and Fredrick wrote and published a book of fiction, The Knucklehead Chronicles. In 2013, The band released The End of When on Pop Culture Press Records. Fredrick's novel The King of Good Intentions was finally published, and soon after, its sequel, and the band issued Sugarplum Fairy, Sugarplum Fairy (largely recorded by Fredrick without the band) and Highs and Lows in 2015. The band signed with Atom Records to release Witches!, and the digital EP Paper Boats. In 2019, the band issued a compilation of their early vinyl-only releases, The Vinyl Years, a career-spanning best-of 31 Years of Obscurity: the Best of the black watch 1988-2019, as well as another studio recording, Magic Johnson.

It delineates and defines the individual and collective rights of Indigenous peoples, including their ownership rights to cultural and ceremonial expression, identity, language, employment, health, education and other issues. It \\"emphasizes the rights of Indigenous peoples to maintain and strengthen their own institutions, cultures and traditions, and to pursue their development in keeping with their own needs and aspirations\\".Frequently Asked Questions: Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. It \\"prohibits discrimination against indigenous peoples\\", and it \\"promotes their full and effective participation in all matters that concern them and their right to remain distinct and to pursue their own visions of economic and social development\\".United Nations adopts Declaration on Rights of Indigenous Peoples United Nations News Centre, 13 September 2007. The goal of the declaration is to encourage countries to work alongside indigenous peoples to solve global issues, like development, multicultural democracy and decentralization. According to Article 31, there is a major emphasis that the indigenous peoples will be able to protect their cultural heritage and other aspects of their culture and tradition in order to preserve their heritage from over- controlling nation-states. On Thursday, September 13, 2007 the United Nations voted by a vast majority of 144 in favor (4 against, 11 abstained) of the Declaration. Since 2007, the four countries voting against have reversed their position and now support the Declaration. As of February 2020, the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Indigenous Peoples describe (A/RES/61/295) as \\".. the most comprehensive international instrument on the rights of indigenous peoples. It establishes a universal framework of minimum standards for the survival, dignity and well-being of the indigenous peoples of the world and it elaborates on existing human rights standards and fundamental freedoms as they apply to the specific situation of indigenous peoples.\\" As a General Assembly Declaration, UNDRIP is not a legally binding instrument under international law. According to a UN press release it does \\"represent the dynamic development of international legal norms and it reflects the commitment of the UN's member states to move in certain directions\\"; the UN describes it as setting \\"an important standard for the treatment of indigenous peoples that will undoubtedly be a significant tool toward eliminating human rights violations against the planet's 370 million indigenous people, and assisting them in combating discrimination and marginalisation.\\" UNDRIP codifies \\"Indigenous historical grievances, contemporary challenges and socio-economic, political and cultural aspirations\\" and is the \\"culmination of generations-long efforts by Indigenous organizations to get international attention, to secure recognition for their aspirations, and to generate support for their political agendas.\\" Canada Research Chair and faculty member at the University of Saskatchewan University of Waterloo Ken Coates argues that UNDRIP resonates powerfully with Indigenous peoples, while national governments have not yet fully understood its impact. History The groundwork toward this declaration began in 1923 and 1925 with the works of Haudenosaunee Chief Deskaheh and MƒÅori T.W. Ratana, who attempted to bring issues of Canada and New Zealand's failure to uphold treaties to the League of Nations, United Nations' precursor. Issues of Indigenous Peoples on a world scale began to be reevaluated in 1982 with the establishment of the Working Group on Indigenous Peoples, formed by the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). Their goal was to create an over arching document that would help protect the rights and privileges of Indigenous Peoples throughout the world. The Declaration went through numerous drafts from 1994-2006, and a version had already been recommended by the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action in 1993.Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, Part II, paragraph 29 On Thursday, September 13, 2007 the United Nations voted by a vast majority of 144 in favor (4 against, 11 abstained) of the Declaration. In May 2016, Canada officially removed its objector status to UNDRIP, almost a decade after it was adopted by the General Assembly. By 2016, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States of America, who had also voted against the Declaration, had reversed their positions and expressed support. Purpose Due to the past and ongoing violence and abuse of Indigenous individuals and peoples, the UN created this non-legally binding declaration as an aspiration for how Indigenous individuals and peoples should be treated. This declaration is a resolution, meaning it is not a law bearing document. Indigenous peoples are not considered political nation-states and do not have access to international law protection through the international court of justice. Article 40 states that Indigenous peoples have the right to fair procedures for the resolution of conflicts and disputes with countries or other parties, because Indigenous people cannot use the International court of justice, UNDRIP has no indication of which judicial power indigenous peoples are to bring disputes to. The declaration‚Äôs purpose is not to create new rights but rather the UNDRIP addresses topics such as Indigenous reconciliation in regards to restoring and protecting culture, traditions, indigenous institutions and the pursuit of self-determined development. Content The Declaration is structured as a United Nations resolution, with 23 preambular clauses and 46 articles. In most articles, an aspiration for how the State should promote and protect the rights of indigenous people is included (see Provision for further explanation). Major themes of the articles include: * Rights of self- determination of indigenous individuals and peoples (Articles 1 - 8; 33 -34) ** The difference is between the individual and people‚Äôs group * Rights of indigenous individuals and people to protect their culture through practices, languages, education, media, and religion (Articles 9 - 15, 16, 25, and 31) * Asserts the indigenous peoples‚Äô right to own type of governance and to economic development (Articles 17 - 21, 35 -37) * Health rights (Article 23 -24) * Protection of subgroups ex. elderly, women, and children (Article 22) * Land rights from ownership (including reparation, or return of land i.e. Article 10) to environmental issues (Articles 26 -30, and 32) * Dictates how this document should be understood in future reference (Articles 38 - 46).United Nations. General Assembly. United Nations Declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples. New York: United Nations, 2007. 1-15. = Provisions = The opening and Article 2 of the Declaration provide that ‚Äúindigenous peoples are equal to all other peoples‚Äù (source). Besides asserting the rights that indigenous individuals and peoples‚Äô have as other peoples, there are Articles (23 of the 46) pointing to how States should interact with the declaration. Most of the articles point to States working in conjunction with the indigenous peoples. Some measures countries are suggested to take are * to return land (article 26), ceremonial objects (article 12), and human remains (article 12) * To place ‚Äúprogrammes for monitoring, maintaining, and restoring the health of indigenous peoples‚Äù (article 29 ) * To protect and uphold the rights of indigenous individuals and peoples (subpoint in many articles; see Declaration) Negotiation and adoption The Declaration was over 25 years in the making. The idea originated in 1982 when the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) set up its Working Group on Indigenous Populations (WGIP), established as a result of a study by Special Rapporteur Jos√© Ricardo Mart√≠nez Cobo on the problem of discrimination faced by indigenous peoples. Tasked with developing human rights standards that would protect indigenous peoples, in 1985 the Working Group began working on drafting the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The draft was finished in 1993 and was submitted to the Sub-Commission on the Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, which gave its approval the following year. During this the International Labour Organization adopted the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989. The Draft Declaration was then referred to the Commission on Human Rights, which established another Working Group to examine its terms. Over the following years this Working Group met on 11 occasions to examine and fine-tune the Draft Declaration and its provisions. Progress was slow because of certain states' concerns regarding some key provisions of the Declaration, such as indigenous peoples' right to self-determination and the control over natural resources existing on indigenous peoples' traditional lands.Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples: Adopted by the Human Rights Council on 29 June 2006 United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. The final version of the Declaration was adopted on 29 June 2006 by the 47-member Human Rights Council (the successor body to the Commission on Human Rights), with 30 member states in favour, 2 against, 12 abstentions, and 3 absentees.UN Human Rights Council adopts documents on disappearances and indigenous peoples United Nations News Centre, 29 June 2006. The Declaration (document A/61/L.67) was then referred to the General Assembly, which voted on the adoption of the proposal on 13 September 2007 during its 61st regular session.Indigenous rights outlined by UN BBC News, 13 September 2007.

Against: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United States. All four member states that voted against have their origins as settler colonies of the United Kingdom, and have large non-Indigenous immigrant majorities and Indigenous populations. Since then, all four countries have moved to endorse the declaration in some informal way in which it would not actually become binding law pleadable in court. Canada, under a Conservative Party leadership made official public statements against the application of the UN DRIP in Canada, e.g. : \\"Indian Affairs Minister Jim Prentice has stated publicly that the Declaration conflicts with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms but has never substantiated this extraordinary claim.\\". However, the Liberal Government elected to leadership in 2015, has unequivocally indicated Canada's support for the UN DRIP and is working on amending Canada's laws accordingly.

Reaction =Support and compromises = In contrast to the Declaration's initial rejection by Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States over legal concerns (all 4 countries later switched their positions to accepting the declaration as a non-legally-binding document), United Nations officials and other world leaders expressed pleasure at its adoption. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon described it as a \\"historic moment when UN Member States and indigenous peoples have reconciled with their painful histories and are resolved to move forward together on the path of human rights, justice and development for all.\\" Louise Arbour, a former justice of the Supreme Court of Canada then serving as the UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights, expressed satisfaction at the hard work and perseverance that had finally \\"borne fruit in the most comprehensive statement to date of indigenous peoples' rights.\\" Similarly, news of the Declaration's adoption was greeted with jubilation in AfricaAfrica: Jubilation as UN Approves Indigenous Peoples Declaration AllAfrica.com, 13 September 2007. and, present at the General Assembly session in New York, Bolivian foreign minister David Choquehuanca said that he hoped the member states that had voted against or abstained would reconsider their refusal to support a document he described as being as important as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Aprueba ONU declaraci√≥n de derechos ind√≠genas El Universal, 13 September 2007. Bolivia has become the first country to approve the U.N. declaration of indigenous rights. Evo Morales, President of Bolivia, stated, \\"We are the first country to turn this declaration into a law and that is important, brothers and sisters. We recognize and salute the work of our representatives. But if we were to remember the indigenous fight clearly, many of us who are sensitive would end up crying in remembering the discrimination, the scorn.\\" Stephen Corry, director of the international indigenous rights organization Survival International, said, \\"The declaration has been debated for nearly a quarter century. Years which have seen many tribal peoples, such as the Akuntsu and Kano√™ in Brazil, decimated and others, such as the Innu in Canada, brought to the edge. Governments that oppose it are shamefully fighting against the human rights of their most vulnerable peoples. Claims they make to support human rights in other areas will be seen as hypocritical.\\" Australia The Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies formally acknowledges and upholds the principles of the Declaration in both their Collection Access and Use PolicyAIATSIS Collection Access and Use Policy, AIATSIS website, , retrieved 12 February 2015 and their Guidelines for Ethical Research in Australian Indigenous Studies.Guidelines for Ethical Research in Australian Indigenous Studies, AIATSIS website, , retrieved 12 February 2015 =Criticism, defiance and \\"aspirational\\" nullification = Prior to the adoption of the Declaration, and throughout the 62nd session of the General Assembly, a number of countries expressed concern about some key issues, such as self-determination, access to lands, territories and resources and the lack of a clear definition of the term \\"indigenous\\". In addition to those intending to vote against the adoption of the declaration, a group of African countries represented by Namibia proposed to defer action, to hold further consultations, and to conclude consideration of the declaration by September 2007.\\"United States Joins Australia and New Zealand in Criticizing Proposed Declaration on Indigenous Peoples' Rights\\" The American Journal of International Law, Vol. 101, No. 1 (January 2007), pp.211‚Äì213. Ultimately, after agreeing on some adjustments to the Draft Declaration, a vast majority of states recognized that these issues could be addressed by each country at the national level. The four states that voted against continued to express serious reservations about the final text of the Declaration as placed before the General Assembly. All four opposing countries later changed their vote in favour of the Declaration. Australia Australia's government opposed the Declaration in the General Assembly vote of 2007, but has since endorsed the Declaration. Australia's Mal Brough, Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, referring to the provision regarding the upholding of indigenous peoples' customary legal systems, said that \\"There should only be one law for all Australians and we should not enshrine in law practices that are not acceptable in the modern world.\\" Marise Payne, Liberal Party Senator for New South Wales, further elaborated on the Australian government's objections to the Declaration in a speech to the Australian Senate:Matters of Urgency: United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Senate Hansards, 10 September 2007. *Concerns about references to self-determination and their potential to be misconstrued. *Ignorance of contemporary realities concerning land and resources. \\"They seem, to many readers, to require the recognition of Indigenous rights to lands which are now lawfully owned by other citizens, both Indigenous and non- Indigenous, and therefore to have some quite significant potential to impact on the rights of third parties.\\" *Concerns over the extension of Indigenous intellectual property rights under the declaration as unnecessary under current international and Australian law. *The potential abuse of the right under the Declaration for indigenous peoples to unqualified consent on matters affecting them, \\"which implies to some readers that they may then be able to exercise a right of veto over all matters of state, which would include national laws and other administrative measures.\\" *The exclusivity of indigenous rights over intellectual, real and cultural property, that \\"does not acknowledge the rights of third parties ‚Äì in particular, their rights to access Indigenous land and heritage and cultural objects where appropriate under national law.\\" Furthermore, that the Declaration \\"fails to consider the different types of ownership and use that can be accorded to Indigenous people and the rights of third parties to property in that regard.\\" *Concerns that the Declaration places indigenous customary law in a superior position to national law, and that this may \\"permit the exercise of practices which would not be acceptable across the board\\", such as customary corporal and capital punishments. In October 2007 former Australian Prime Minister John Howard pledged to hold a referendum on changing the constitution to recognise indigenous Australians if re-elected.

On 3 April 2009, the Rudd Government formally endorsed the Declaration.Experts hail Australia‚Äôs backing of UN declaration of indigenous peoples‚Äô rights , UN News Centre Canada The Canadian government said that while it supported the \\"spirit\\" of the declaration, it contained elements that were \\"fundamentally incompatible with Canada's constitutional framework\\", which includes both the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and Section 35, which enshrines aboriginal and treaty rights. In particular, the Canadian government had problems with Article 19 (which appears to require governments to secure the consent of indigenous peoples regarding matters of general public policy), and Articles 26 and 28 (which could allow for the re-opening or repudiation of historically settled land claims). Former Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development Chuck Strahl described the document as \\"unworkable in a Western democracy under a constitutional government.\\" Strahl elaborated, saying \\"In Canada, you are balancing individual rights vs. collective rights, and (this) document ... has none of that. By signing on, you default to this document by saying that the only rights in play here are the rights of the First Nations. And, of course, in Canada, that's inconsistent with our constitution.\\" He gave an example: \\"In Canada ... you negotiate on this ... because (native rights) don't trump all other rights in the country. You need also to consider the people who have sometimes also lived on those lands for two or three hundred years, and have hunted and fished alongside the First Nations.\\" The Assembly of First Nations passed a resolution in December 2007 to invite Presidents Hugo Ch√°vez and Evo Morales to Canada to put pressure on the government to sign the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, calling the two heads of state \\"visionary leaders\\" and demanding Canada resign its membership on the United Nations Human Rights Council. On 3 March 2010, in the Speech From the Throne, the Governor General of Canada announced that the government was moving to endorse the declaration. \\"We are a country with an Aboriginal heritage. A growing number of states have given qualified recognition to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Our Government will take steps to endorse this aspirational document in a manner fully consistent with Canada‚Äôs Constitution and laws.\\" On 12 November 2010, Canada officially endorsed the declaration but without changing its position that it was 'aspirational'. Anishinabek spiritual leader, Chief William Commanda (1908-3 August 2011) was honoured at the 21st annual week- long First Peoples' Festival held in Montreal from 2‚Äì9 August 2011, celebrating Canada's 2010 adoption of the U.

In December of 2015, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission listed ratifying UNDRIP as one of its national \\"calls to action\\" in its final report. In 2016, Canada officially adopted and promised to implement the declaration fully. Speaking at the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada minister Carolyn Bennett announced, \\"We are now a full supporter of the declaration, without qualification. We intend nothing less than to adopt and implement the declaration in accordance with the Canadian Constitution.\\" Bennett described the Declaration as \\"breathing life into Section 35 [of the Canadian Constitution] and recognizing it as a full box of rights for Indigenous Peoples in Canada.\\" In July 2016, Kwakwaka‚Äôwakw Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould gave a speech that stated that \\"adopting the UNDRIP as being Canadian law are unworkable\\", due to its incompatibility with the Indian Act, the current governing statute. The federal government pledged on 21 June 2017 to rename its National Aboriginal Day to be consistent with the terminology used by the Declaration. In September 2017, British Columbia's provincial government announced that it will govern in accordance with the principles outlined in the Declaration. On October 24, 2019, it announced that it will amend its legislation to conform to UNDRIP. BC is the first province in Canada to start implementing legislation in accordance with the UNDRIP. The British Columbia (BC) provincial government is the first Canadian province to start bringing its legislation in alliance with the UNDRIP by implementing the BC Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People‚Äôs Act. The ongoing process of implementation is intended to propel reconciliation forward in BC. The provincial government has been working with the Assembly of First Nations, First Nations Summit and Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs, headed by First Nations Chiefs of BC to employ UNDRIP principles . The legislation was originally put forth by Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation Scott Fraser (politician), under John Horgan‚Äôs New Democratic Party government. The Legislative Assembly of British Columbia notes the purpose the Act are as follows: (a) to affirm the application of the Declaration to the laws of British Columbia; (b) to contribute to the implementation of the Declaration; (c) to support the affirmation of, and develop relationships with, Indigenous governing bodies. As of November 2019, the BC government has committed to putting almost per year aside for First Nation communities, in order for them to invest in their own self-governance and cultural revitalization; the province has also dedicated to invest in First Nations communities language revitalization. Additionally, they have implemented Grand Chief Edward John's recommendations to decrease the amount of Indigenous children taken from homes and put in care. New Zealand New Zealand delegation at the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. New Zealand endorsed the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in April 2010. In 2007 New Zealand's Minister of MƒÅori Affairs Parekura Horomia described the Declaration as \\"toothless\\", and said, \\"There are four provisions we have problems with, which make the declaration fundamentally incompatible with New Zealand's constitutional and legal arrangements.\\" Article 26 in particular, he said, \\"appears to require recognition of rights to lands now lawfully owned by other citizens, both indigenous and non-indigenous. This ignores contemporary reality and would be impossible to implement.\\"MƒÅori Party‚Äôs head in the clouds New Zealand government press release, via scoop.co.nz, 14 September 2007. In response, MƒÅori Party leader Pita Sharples said it was \\"shameful to the extreme that New Zealand voted against the outlawing of discrimination against indigenous people; voted against justice, dignity and fundamental freedoms for all\\". On 7 July 2009, the New Zealand government announced that it would support the Declaration; this, however, appeared to be a premature announcement by Pita Sharples, the current Minister of MƒÅori Affairs, as the New Zealand government cautiously backtracked on Sharples' July announcement. However, on 19 April 2010, Sharples announced New Zealand's support of the declaration at a speech in New York.New Zealand Statement Before 9th Session of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues United States Speaking for the United States mission to the UN, spokesman Benjamin Chang said, \\"What was done today is not clear.

The U.S. mission also issued a floor document, \\"Observations of the United States with respect to the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples\\", setting out its objections to the Declaration. Most of these are based on the same points as the three other countries' rejections but, in addition, the United States drew attention to the Declaration's failure to provide a clear definition of exactly whom the term \\"indigenous peoples\\" is intended to cover.Explanation of vote on the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples United States Mission to the United Nations press release, 13 September 2007. On 16 December 2010, President Obama declared that the United States would \\"lend its support\\" to the Declaration. The decision was announced during the second White House Tribal Nations Conference, where he said he is \\"working hard to live up to\\" the name that was given to him by the Crow Nation: \\"One Who Helps People Throughout the Land.\\" Obama has told Native American leaders that he wants to improve the \\"nation-to-nation\\" relationship between the United States and the tribes and repair broken promises. Today, there are more than 560 Indian tribesFederal Register, Volume 78, Number 87 dated May 6, 2013 () in the United States that are recognized at the federal level, with some additional sixty-plus tribes recognized at the state level. Many had representatives at the White House conference and applauded Obama's announcement. The Obama administration's decision came after three consultation meetings with Native Americans and more than 3,000 written comments on the subject. The support of the government also included several interpretations of the meaning of the Declaration. In the view of the United States government, the Declaration advances \\"a new and distinct international concept of self-determination specific to indigenous peoples,\\" which is not the same as the existing concept in international law. The statement also interprets free, prior and informed consent, \\"which the United States understands to call for a process of meaningful consultation with tribal leaders, but not necessarily the agreement of those leaders, before the actions addressed in those consultations are taken.\\" United Kingdom Speaking on behalf of the United Kingdom government, UK Ambassador and Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Karen Pierce, \\"emphasized that the Declaration was non-legally binding and did not propose to have any retroactive application on historical episodes. National minority groups and other ethnic groups within the territory of the United Kingdom and its overseas territories did not fall within the scope of the indigenous peoples to which the Declaration applied.\\"GENERAL ASSEMBLY ADOPTS DECLARATION ON RIGHTS OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES; at www.un.org The UK position was also allegedly intended to prevent formal appeal of Canadian decisions to UK courts: Canadian indigenous peoples never accepted the 1982 constitution in which such appeal (regarding early treaties made with the Crown of the British Empire) was cut off. Under the prior 1867 constitution, 1920s Dominion of Canada and earlier law, which continue to apply to these peoples and treaties, the UN DRIP allegedly could have been pleaded in a UK court in conflicts between treaty and Canadian law. Calls to pursue this approach have been common among Canadian natives. Finland Finland signed the International Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples when it was originally put forward.

In May 2014, the country formally endorsed the UNDRIP.Don't Cry for Us Ukraina! (Ukraine) , International Committee for Crimea, Inc Pacific Island states Ten UN member states in the Pacific, all with indigenous majorities, were absent from the assembly at the time of the vote: Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu. It is unclear whether this represents the equivalent of deliberate abstention, or whether the country delegations were absent for some other reason. The constitutions of these states typically make mention of \\"indigenous inhabitants\\" and accommodate customary laws in at least part of their modern legal systems. The constitution of Papua New Guinea, for example, has an explanatory section on the \\"underlying law\\" being based on custom, while Sch.1.2. says that \\"custom\\" means \\"the customs and usages of indigenous inhabitants of the country ...\\" (emphasis added). It may be the case, therefore, that the governments of these states took the position that their own legal systems offered sufficient protection to their own indigenous peoples. There has been no suggestion at any time since decolonisation commenced in the 1960s and the present that indigenous people are absent from any of the ten countries. Nonetheless, Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu are among countries in this group plagued by land grabbing in recent years. Pacific land grab among worlds worst says expert, ABC Radio Australia Researchers have warned that as much as 12% of the land surface of Papua New Guinea has been leased without informed consultation and consent from landowners, typically suppressing customary rights for 99 years., On Our Land: Modern Land Grabs Reversing Independence in Papua New Guinea, Oakland Institute 2013 Given that land grabbing was in 2016 ruled to lie within the remit of the International Criminal Court,, International Criminal Court extends remit to land grabbing, Scottish Legal News, 19 September 2016 it is a reasonable conclusion that legal systems in the Pacific, unsupported by UNDRIP, have insufficient built-in safeguards for the protection of indigenous rights. There are also significant implications in the extractive sector for these states not having signed UNDRIP. Mining companies that are members of the International Council on Mining and Metals commit to respect the ICMM's position statement on indigenous peoples. However, ambiguity surrounds how or if member companies recognise when they are dealing with indigenous peoples. For example, Barrick Gold lists only its operations in North and South America as lying on indigenous land, yet operates in Fiji and Papua New Guinea (where a subsidiary has operated the Porgera gold mine since 2007)., Barrick Gold, \\"Indigenous Peoples\\", accessed 3 February 2017. Another member, Newmont Mining, said in its 2011 Sustainability Report, Beyond the Mine: the journey towards sustainability, 2011 edition. that it had been conducting mining exploration in Papua New Guinea for three years, yet its disclosures do not show how activities in this country may have followed the ICMM's Indigenous Peoples and Mining Good Practice Guide, first published in 2010.

History  Before the community of Baby Island Heights was platted, the waterfront along the community was a well-known fishing hotspot for salmon. This attracted several well-known early-20th-century Seattle businessmen to the area, including Virgil Bogue, Eddie Bauer, and Thomas Moore, all of whom built cabins in the present-day community. In 1924 the Baby Island (fishing) Resort opened and attracted people to the community for more than 30 years. During the summer of 1936 the Civil Service Corps hacked a road through the forest to the community greatly improving automobile access to Langley, WA. It wasn't until 1946, when public electricity was finally brought into the area, that growth started to take place. Many of the present-day homes in the community were built between the late 1940s and the early 1970s. http://www.oldcamano.net/babyisland.html  Present day  Baby Island Heights is currently home to about 200 residents, almost half of which are seasonal.

After the German use of such vessels had been identified as a weakness that could be exploited to break the Enigma code, Lauenburg was captured and sunk on 28 June 1941. The Royal Navy acquired important German code books and parts of an Enigma machine. Early life Lauenburg had been built in 1938 as a fishing trawler, named after the town of Lauenburg, and with the identification number 'PG 532'. She operated out of Geestem√ºnde for her owners, H. Bischoff & Co, of Bremen. She was acquired by the Kriegsmarine in 1940, and entered naval service in November, having been converted into a weather ship, retaining the name Lauenburg. In her new guise she carried a crew of between 19 and 21, as well as eight meteorologists. She was to be used to provide detailed weather reports for naval units, including Germany's U-boat fleet. The weather ships and Enigma The British cryptologist Harry Hinsley, then working at Bletchley Park, realised at the end of April 1941 that the German weather ships, usually isolated and unprotected trawlers, were using the same Enigma code books as were being used on U-boats. The trawlers, which transmitted weather reports to the Germans, were being sent naval Enigma messages. Although the weather ships did not transmit enciphered weather reports on Enigma machines, they needed one to decode the Enigma signals transmitted to them. Hinsley realised that if the code books could be captured from one of these trawlers, the naval Enigma system could be broken, with British intelligence able to decipher messages to U-boats and discover their locations. The problem remained that if the navy were to attempt to capture one of the weatherships, the German crew would have time to throw their Enigma settings into the sea before they were boarded. Hinsley instead reasoned that the following month's Enigma settings would be locked in a safe aboard the ship and could be overlooked if the Germans were surprised and forced hastily to abandon ship. The Admiralty despatched seven destroyers and cruisers to the northeast of Iceland at the beginning of May 1941. The target was M√ºnchen, one of the weather ships operating in the area. The weather ship and the Enigma settings for June 1941 were captured and naval Enigma messages transmitted during June 1941 were quickly deciphered. Halfway through June 1941 the Germans replaced the bigram tables used in Enigma. This would have resulted in a codebreaking blackout unless further settings could be captured. Hinsley and the Admiralty were concerned that capturing another weather ship might alert the Germans to their vulnerability and cause them to immediately alter them. It was eventually decided to take the risk and on 25 June 1941, the light cruiser and the destroyers , and , were despatched from Scapa Flow to capture the codebooks from Lauenburg, another weather ship operating north of Iceland, which Hinsley had selected.Wetterbeobachtungs-Schiff Lauenburg Capture and sinking of Lauenburg Lauenburg is sunk by Royal Navy gunfire At around 7pm on 28 June, a lookout aboard Tartar sighted Lauenburg off Jan Mayen which opened fire. Lauenburg's crew quickly abandoned the ship in two lifeboats. Minutes later, Tartar steamed alongside and a boarding party seized Lauenburg and a large amount of material was collected, then the Allied warships sank Lauenburg with gunfire; confirmation of the sinking was sent by radio, but the boarding was specifically not mentioned so that listening Germans would not suspect the recovery of Enigma materials.Dr. Mark Baldwin, \\"The Enigma Machine\\", presentation to the BCS Tayside & Fife Branch, Abertay University, 26 August 2019 The recovered material allowed further understanding of the Enigma codes and resulted in faster decoding of encrypted messages, as well as providing an up-to-date set of codes.

Missouri is known throughout the Midwest for its largely laissez-faire approach to alcohol regulation, in sharp contrast to the very strict alcohol laws of some of its neighbors, like Kansas and Oklahoma. History of Missouri alcohol laws The packaging plant at the Anheuser-Busch headquarters in St. Louis Nicknamed the \\"Show Me State\\" for Missourians' well-known \\"stalwart, conservative, noncredulous\\" attitude toward regulation in general,Missouri Secretary of State - State Archives - Origin of \\"Show Me\\" slogan this tendency always has been readily visible with regard to the state's alcohol laws. Missouri's laissez-faire approach to alcohol regulation also stems from its position as the leading alcohol-producing state in America, well known for wine production in the Missouri Rhineland and for beer production in St. Louis by Anheuser-Busch, which produces Budweiser. Anheuser-Busch is the principal advocate of keeping Missouri's alcohol laws as lax as they are.\\"Anheuser ends opposition to .08 in Missouri,\\" Modern Brewery Age, January 22, 2001 But these laws have generally always been this way. During the height of the temperance movement in the late-19th century and early-20th century before nationwide prohibition, Missouri never implemented its own statewide prohibition.Kenneth H. Winn, \\"It All Adds Up: Reform and the Erosion of Representative Government in Missouri, 1900-2000,\\" published by the Missouri Secretary of State Actually, the voters of Missouri rejected prohibition in three separate initiative elections in 1910, 1912, and 1918.Ira M. Wasserman, \\"Prohibition and Ethno-Cultural Conflict: the Missouri Prohibition Referendum of 1918,\\" Social Science Quarterly, Volume 70, pp. 886-901. When temperance crusader Carrie A. Nation entered a bar in Kansas City in April 1901 and began to smash liquor bottles with her hatchet, she was promptly arrested and fined $500 ($12,926 in 2010 dollarsThe Inflation Calculator ), which her judge stayed as long as she agreed to leave Missouri and never return.\\"Mrs. Nation Barred from Kansas City,\\" The New York Times (April 16, 1901) The Missouri General Assembly did ratify the 18th Amendment in 1919, but only after it already had received enough previous ratifications to become part of the Constitution. During Prohibition, political boss Tom Pendergast ensured that the national prohibition law would not affect Kansas City's liquor industry and saloons.Allan May, \\"The History of the Kansas City Family,\\" Crime Magazine, October 10, 2002 Kansas City's federal prosecutor, who was on Pendergast's payroll, never brought a single felony prosecution under the Volstead Act.Ken Burns, \\"Kansas City, a Wide Open Town,\\" from Jazz, PBS, 1997 Effectively, thanks to Pendergast, prohibition did not affect Kansas City. This atmosphere led the editor of the Omaha World-Herald to remark, \\"If you want to see some sin, forget about Paris. Go to Kansas City.\\" An 1857 Missouri statute left all liquor regulation to localities, including the question whether to go dry, except the collection of licensing fees.\\"Anti- saloonists win: St. Louis must close her saloons on Sunday\\", 'The New York Times', May 8, 1888 As a result, despite the lack of statewide prohibition, by the end of nationwide prohibition in 1934 half of Missouri's counties had gone dry. Immediately, though, Missouri enacted its first Liquor Control Law, which repealed and superseded those local laws.11 CSR ¬ß 70-1.010(1) (Missouri Secretary of State - Code of State Regulations)Annotations to Mo. Rev. Stat ¬ß 311.010 This was the first time Missouri had any statewide control of liquor.\\"For Missouri Prohibition; Senate Passes Resolution Submitting Constitutional Amendment to People\\", The New York Times, May 6, 1909 Today, Missouri has no dry jurisdictions whatsoever. Before state alcohol regulation began in 1934, many Missouri cities, including both St. Louis and Kansas City, had banned Sunday liquor sales.\\"Kansas City Lid Padlocked: Not a Saloon Opened on Sunday Either on the Missouri or Kansas Side\\", The New York Times, July 2, 1906 Missouri's original 1934 Liquor Control Law prohibited Sunday sales of beverages with more than 5% alcohol by volume, but this restriction was lifted entirely in 1975.Missouri Attorney General's Opinion 39-77 For 2013, the annual \\"Freedom in the 50 States\\" study prepared by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University ranked Missouri third in the nation in alcohol freedom, noting Missouri's \\"alcohol regime is one of the least restrictive in the United States, with no blue laws and taxes well below average.\\"  What constitutes \\"intoxicating liquor\\"  Unlike many states, the alcohol laws of Missouri do not differentiate between types of alcohol based on the percentage of alcohol in a given beverage. Missouri's Liquor Control LawMo. Rev. Stat. Chapter 311 covers any \\"alcohol for beverage purposes, alcohol, spiritous, vinous, fermented, malt, or other liquors, or combination of liquors, a part of which is spiritous, vinous, or fermented, and all preparations or mixtures for beverage purposes, containing in excess of one-half of one percent by volume.\\"Mo. Rev. Stat. ¬ß 311.020 Thus, the Liquor Control Law covers any type of alcoholic beverage which contains more than 0.5% alcohol by volume. Until recently, there was a separate regulation for beer containing at least 0.5% alcohol by volume and at most 3.2% alcohol by weight, which was classified as \\"nonintoxicating beer\\" (rather than a liquor) and was subject to a separate law from the Liquor Control Law.Mo. Rev. Stat Chapter 312 For a long time, however, the Nonintoxicating Beer Law was rarely invoked, as the Liquor Control Law's permissive sale provisions for any alcoholic beverage made so- called \\"three-two beer\\" a rarity in Missouri. The Missouri General Assembly repealed it in August 2009. The Liquor Control Law now controls all alcoholic beverages containing more than 0.5% alcohol by volume. Any beverage containing less than 0.5% alcohol by volume (including low alcohol beer) is expressly exempt from all alcohol regulation in Missouri (including age restrictions), and is subject only to ordinary food safety laws.Mo. Rev. Stat. ¬ß 312.020 Liquor sales =Off-premises sales= A bar in Downtown Kansas City advertising \\"Liquors by drink or package,\\" meaning that it is licensed as both a bar and liquor store. Missouri has no specific state limitations on the places where alcohol may be sold \\"off-premises\\" (i.e. for consumption elsewhere). As a result, Missouri is famous in the region for grocery stores, drug stores, and even gas stations throughout the state which sell a wide variety of beer, wine, and liquor. As long as it is not located within of a school or church,Mo. Rev. Stat. ¬ß 311.080 virtually any retail business (including a vague and undefined \\"general merchandise store\\") which obtains the proper licenses from the Division of Alcohol and Tobacco Control and local authorities may sell any type of alcohol.Mo. Rev. Stat. ¬ß 311.200 State law even forbids a local option and prohibits cities and counties from banning the off-premises sale of alcohol.Mo. Rev. Stat. ¬ß 311.170 Missouri does, however, limit the hours of retail alcohol sales to between 6:00 AM and 1:30 AM Monday through Saturday,Mo. Rev. Stat. ¬ß 311.290 and - for an additional license fee - between 9:00 am and 12:00 midnight on Sunday.Mo. Rev. Stat. ¬ß 311.293 Most municipalities, including St. LouisCity of St. Louis Rev. Code of Ordinances ¬ß¬ß 14.03.030-040 and Kansas CityKansas City Code of Ordinances ¬ß¬ß 10-333 and 10-104 have enacted local laws following the state law, which prohibit the retail sale of liquor between 1:30 AM and 6:00 AM Tuesday through Saturday, and between midnight on Sunday and 9:00 AM the following morning. No Missouri law prohibits establishments from holding both off-premises and on-premises licenses. As a result, some businesses are licensed to sell liquor both \\"by the drink\\" (individually for consumption on premises) and \\"by the package\\" (by the container for consumption off premises). Effectively, these are bars which double as liquor stores. In these places, off-premises sales are allowed until 1:30 a.m., even in those in St. Louis and Kansas City specially licensed to serve liquor by the drink until 3:00 a.m. (on-premises sales may continue until 3:00, but off-premises sales must cease by 1:30). =On-premises sales= Generally, the hours for sales of liquor by the drink (for consumption on the premises) are the same as liquor by the package: between 6:00 AM and 1:30 AM Monday through Saturday, and - again for an additional fee - between 9:00 AM and midnight on Sunday. State law allows incorporated cities to prohibit the on-premises sale of liquor by public referendum,Mo. Rev. Stat. ¬ß 311.110 although no city in Missouri ever has held such a referendum. The on-premises sale of liquor is allowed throughout the state, without any limitation except for the hours when sale is permitted. Since 1981, properly licensed establishments with certain levels of annual revenue in Kansas City,Mo. Rev. Stat. ¬ß 311.174 Jackson County, North Kansas City, St. Louis,Mo. Rev. Stat. ¬ß 311.176 and St. Louis CountyMo. Rev. Stat. ¬ß 311.178 have been permitted to sell liquor by the drink between 6:00 AM and 3:00 AM Mondays through Saturdays, and between 9:00 AM and 3:00 AM on Sundays. Shipping Except for wine, Missouri places no limitations on the interstate shipping of alcohol into the state, as long the alcohol is in a quantity less than five gallons, has been lawfully manufactured in its source jurisdiction, and is shipped to a person who is at least 21 years of age.Mo. Rev. Stat. ¬ß 311.410Mo. Rev. Stat. ¬ß 311.420 There are no quantity limits whatsoever for shipments which are entirely within Missouri or which are made by licensed Missouri alcohol retailers. =Bulk shipments= To ship alcohol into Missouri in quantities greater than five gallons, both the commercial carrier doing the shipping and the sender itself must obtain a \\"transporter's license\\" from the Missouri Department of Revenue and pay the necessary licensing fees. Additionally, for such shipments, the commercial carrier must be generally licensed to do business by the Department of Economic Development. In practice, ordinary commercial shippers like FedEx and UPS have the necessary licenses. =Special regulations for wine shipments= An alcohol retailer licensed in Missouri or in any other state which has similar, \\"reciprocal\\" wine-shipping laws may ship up to two cases of wine each year to any Missouri resident over the age of 21, provided that the wine is for personal use and not for resale.Mo. Rev. Stat. ¬ß 311.462 Such a delivery is deemed not to be a sale in Missouri. Otherwise, for direct shipments of wine from a winery, a wine manufacturer licensed in Missouri or any other state can obtain a \\"wine direct shipper license\\" from the Division of Alcohol and Tobacco Control which lets that manufacturer ship up to two cases of wine per month to any person in Missouri who is at least 21 years of age.Mo. Rev. Stat. ¬ß 311.185 Unlike shipments under the \\"reciprocal\\" provision, for shipments under this provision, the wine manufacturer must use a licensed alcohol carrier. Open container =Driving= Skyline of St. Louis, Missouri, where, as in most of Missouri, passengers (but not drivers) may possess open containers and drink openly in moving vehicles Although a driver is prohibited from consuming alcohol while driving,Mo. Rev. Stat. ¬ß 577.017 Missouri has no general open container law for vehicles, a characteristic which Missouri shares only with the states of Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Mississippi, Virginia, and West Virginia.United States Department of Transportation - Open Container Law Conformance Any non-driving vehicle passenger thus is permitted to possess an open container and consume alcohol in Missouri while the vehicle is in motion, although 31 smaller municipalities, the largest being Columbia, Independence and St. Charles, have local open container laws.Justin Roberts, \\"Missouri State and Local Open Container Laws,\\" University of Missouri Institute of Public Policy, June 2005 The metropolises of St. Louis (except St. Charles) and Kansas City (except Independence) have no local open container laws, and thus the state law (or lack thereof) governs. This makes it possible for a passenger to drink legally through the entire trip across Missouri on Interstate 70 between Downtown Kansas City and Downtown St. Louis, only closing the container while passing through the city limits of Independence, Bates City, Columbia, Foristell, and St. Charles. As a result of having no state open container laws, under the federal Transportation Equity Act for the 21st century of 1999, a percentage of Missouri's federal highway funds is transferred instead to alcohol education programs each year.23 U.S.C. ¬ß 154 Since 1999, the Missouri General Assembly has considered several bills which would have created open container regimens satisfying the federal law, but each one \\"failed due to weak legislative support.\\" Anheuser-Busch leads opposition to enacting a passenger open container law. =In public= Missouri also is one of only six states (along with Georgia, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada, and Pennsylvania) which has no state law prohibiting drinking in public, although an establishment selling liquor by the drink ordinarily may not permit a patron to take unfinished liquor off the premises.Mo. Rev. Stat. ¬ß 311.101 Restaurant and winery patrons, though, may take unfinished bottles of wine out of the restaurant or winery, provided that the containers are closed and placed in sealed bags. Missouri has no state public intoxication law either, unlike many other states, and state law expressly prohibits local jurisdictions from enacting any law \\"which authorizes or requires arrest or punishment for public intoxication or being a common or habitual drunkard or alcoholic.\\"Mo. Rev. Stat. ¬ß 67.305 It is a misdemeanor in Missouri, however, to be both intoxicated and disorderly or to consume or offer any alcoholic beverage specifically in any school, church, or courthouse.Mo. Rev. Stat. ¬ß 574.075 Consumption and offering in courthouses is permitted, though, at social functions after business hours when authorized by the court. Despite the lack of a general state law prohibiting drinking in public, nearly all municipalities, including both St. LouisCity of St. Louis Rev. Code of Ordinanes ¬ß 14.05.010 and Kansas City,Kansas City Code of Ordinances ¬ß 50-152 do prohibit drinking in public. St. Louis, however, does allow picnickers in public parks to consume alcohol without limitation.City of St. Louis Rev. Code of Ordinances ¬ß 14.05.010(a) =Special allowance for open containers in public in Kansas City= Downtown Kansas City, Missouri, where open containers have been allowed in the street in certain areas since the spring of 2008 In 2005, anticipating Kansas City's new Power & Light District, a nine-block shopping, bar, and restaurant entertainment district in Downtown Kansas City, and after lobbying by the Cordish Company of Baltimore (the District's developer), the Missouri General Assembly passed a new law specifically allowing patrons of any \\"entertainment district\\" in Downtown Kansas City to remove any alcoholic beverage from any establishment in the district and carry it openly throughout the district, provided that the beverage is in a plastic cup marked with the logo of the establishment at which it was purchased.Mo. Rev. Stat. ¬ß 311.086 Kansas City Code of Ordinances ¬ß¬ß 10-134 and 10-135Rick Alm, \\"Drinking to be allowed on street in Power & Light District,\\" The Kansas City Star, July 27, 2005 The City Council later legalized the possession of an open container in any portion not open to vehicular traffic of the Power & Light District, Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts, the Crossroads Arts District, the 18th and Vine Historic District, the Liberty Memorial, Crown Center, and the Union Hill neighborhood.Kansas City Code of Ordinance ¬ß 10-134(c) The Power & Light District opened in the spring of 2008, and no law prohibits drinking there \\"in the street.\\" It is one of only a few places in the United States where open containers are allowed in public. DUI Like every other state in the United States, driving under the influence is a crime in Missouri, and is subject to a great number of regulations outside of the Liquor Control Law.Mo. Rev. Stat. Chapter 577 Missouri's maximum blood alcohol level for driving is .08% for persons over the age of 21Mo. Rev. Stat. ¬ß 577.012 and .02% for minors and adults under age 21.Mo. Rev. Stat. ¬ß 311.325 Ordinarily, DUI is a misdemeanor in Missouri, although the third DUI conviction becomes a felony.Mo. Rev. Stat. ¬ß 577.023 Refusal to take a chemical test (i.e. breathalyzer) when so requested by a law enforcement officer who has probable cause will result in a one-year suspension of the suspect's driver's license.Mo. Rev. Stat. ¬ß 577.041 Minors and alcohol in Missouri =Drinking age= Missouri's drinking age has been 21 since 1945. That is, Missouri law prohibits minors from possessing or purchasing alcohol. Thus, when the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984 came into effect on January 1, 1985, Missouri was in no danger of losing federal highway funds. A minor in possession (MIP) of alcohol or a business or person which furnishes alcohol to a minor is guilty of a misdemeanor, although for sellers there are numerous defenses and exceptions.Mo. Rev. Stat. ¬ß 311.310 Missouri is one of six states, however, with a unique exception which allows a minor to be furnished alcohol by his or her parent or guardian. Of course, if a parent or guardian purposefully intoxicated his or her child, it would be a form of child abuse. Rather, this sort of law allows parents to let their children have a small amount of liquor with a meal, at social gatherings, in religious services, or otherwise use alcohol in moderation. Additionally, although Missouri prohibits minors from possessing or purchasing alcohol, it is one of 20 states (and the District of Columbia) which have no specific law prohibiting the consumption of alcohol by minors. In 2005, though, the Missouri General Assembly amended the Liquor Control Law to prohibit any minor from having a blood alcohol level higher than .02%. This new law has been referred to as \\"Possession by Consumption\\". It remains unclear how the provision permitting family consumption, the lack of a specific consumption prohibition, and the new \\"minor under the influence\\" law will work together. Any teen can consume alcohol as long as they do not get caught with the alcohol in their possession if searched by a police officer. This means you can not get arrested if you are intoxicated but not breaking the law in some other way, ex. driving. Special expungement for MIP Since 2005, Missouri law has had a special method of expungement for a person who pleaded guilty to or was convicted of being a minor in possession of alcohol one time in Missouri. If more than a year has passed since said person turns twenty-one, and said person has had no other MIP expungements and has had no other alcohol-related law enforcement contacts (like drunk driving or violating the terms of a liquor license), then all records of the case can be completely deleted upon proper application to the Circuit Court of the county in which the person was charged.Mo. Rev. Stat. ¬ß 311.326 =Fake ID= In Missouri, it is only a misdemeanor punishable by up to a $500 fine for a person under 21 to represent by virtue of displaying a fake ID that he or she is over 21 for the purposes of purchasing or possessing alcohol.Mo. Rev. Stat. ¬ß 311.320 Additionally, it constitutes a separate misdemeanor under the Liquor Control Law if the minor reproduced or altered the ID himself,Mo. Rev. Stat. ¬ß 311.329 punishable by up to one year in prisonMo. Rev. Stat. ¬ß 558.011 and/or a fine of up to $1,000.Mo. Rev. Stat. ¬ß 560.016 The forgery of an identity document is a separate felony in Missouri,Mo. Rev. Stat. ¬ß 570.090 punishable by up to seven years in prison and/or a fine of up to $5,000 (or if financial gain was made, up to the amount of that financial gain). Possession of forgery instruments also is a felony with the same prospective punishments as that of ordinary forgery.Mo. Rev.

It is defined as the force (in tons or kilonewtons (kN)) exerted by a vessel under full power, on a shore-mounted bollard through a tow-line, commonly measured in a practical test (but sometimes simulated) under test conditions that include calm water, no tide, level trim, and sufficient depth and side clearance for a free propeller stream. Like the horsepower or mileage rating of a car, it is a convenient but idealized number that must be adjusted for operating conditions that differ from the test. The bollard pull of a vessel may be reported as two numbers, the static or maximum bollard pull - the highest force measured - and the steady or continuous bollard pull, the average of measurements over an interval of, for example, 10 minutes. An equivalent measurement on land is known as drawbar pull, or tractive force, which is used to measure the total horizontal force generated by a locomotive, a piece of heavy machinery such as a tractor, or a truck, (specifically a ballast tractor), which is utilized to move a load. Bollard pull is primarily (but not only) used for measuring the strength of tugboats, with the largest commercial harbour tugboats in the 2000-2010s having around of bollard pull, which is described as above \\"normal\\" tugboats. The worlds strongest tug is Island Victory (Vard Brevik 831) of Island Offshore, with a bollard pull of . Island Victory is not a typical tug, rather it is a special class of ship used in the petroleum industry called an Anchor Handling Tug Supply vessel. Resistive force is roughly ¬Ω water density times velocity square times area of ship wet surface: R={1\\\\over2}d \\\\times v^2 \\\\times A Background Unlike in ground vehicles, the statement of installed horsepower is not sufficient to understand how strong a tug is - this is because the tug operates mainly in very low or zero speeds, thus may not be delivering power (power = force x velocity; so, for zero speeds, the power is also zero), yet still absorbing torque and delivering thrust. Bollard pull values are stated in tons (written as TBP) or kiloNewtons (kN).Note the inherent conflict: the SI unit of force is the Newton. Even accepting ton as a unit of force, the value of a ton or tonne can mean anything between 8.89 kN and 10.00 kN, depending on the definition used. Estimated horsepower is equal to total resistance times velocity divided by 550. in the English system units, HP = {R\\\\times v\\\\over550} Measurement Values for bollard pull can be determined in two ways. =Practical trial= Figure 1: bollard pull trial under ideal (imaginary) conditions This method is useful for one-off ship designs and smaller shipyards. It is limited in precision - a number of boundary conditions need to be observed to obtain reliable results. Summarizing the below requirements, practical bollard pull trials need to be conducted in a deep water seaport, ideally not at the mouth of a river, on a calm day with hardly any traffic. * The ship needs to be in undisturbed water. Currents or strong winds would falsify the measurement. * The static force that intends to move the ship forward must only be generated by the friction between the propeller discharge race and the surrounding water. If the ship were too close to a wall, the measurement would be falsified. * The ship must be in deep water. If there were any ground effect, the measurement would be falsified. The same holds true for propeller walk. * Water salinity must have a well-defined value, as it influences the specific weight of the water and thereby the mass moved by the propeller per unit of time. * The geometry of the towing line must have a well-defined value. Ideally, one would expect it to be exactly horizontal and straight. This is impossible in reality, because ** the line falls into a catenary due to its weight; ** the two fixed points of the line, being the bollard on shore and the ship's towing hook or cleat, may not have the same height above water. * Conditions must be static. The engine power, the heading of the ship, the conditions of the propeller discharge race and the tension in the towing line must have settled to a constant or near-constant value for a reliable measurement. * One condition to watch out for is the formation of a short circuit in propeller discharge race. If part of the discharge race is sucked back into the propeller, efficiency decreases sharply. This could occur due to a trial that is performed in too shallow water or too close to a wall. See Figure 2 for an illustration of error influences in a practical bollard pull trial. Note the difference in elevation of the ends of the line (the port bollard is higher than the ship's towing hook). Furthermore, there is the partial short circuit in propeller discharge current, the uneven trim of the ship and the short length of the tow line. All of these factors contribute to measurement error. Figure 2: bollard pull trial under real conditions =Simulation= This method eliminates much of the uncertainties of the practical trial. However, any numerical simulation also has an error margin. Furthermore, simulation tools and computer systems capable of determining bollard pull for a ship design are costly. Hence, this method makes sense for larger shipyards and for the design of a series of ships. Both methods can be combined. Practical trials can be used to validate the result of numerical simulation. Human-powered vehicles Practical bollard pull tests under simplified conditions are conducted for human powered vehicles. There, bollard pull is often a category in competitions and gives an indication of the power train efficiency. Although conditions for such measurements are inaccurate in absolute terms, they are the same for all competitors. Hence, they can still be valid for comparing several craft.

It was formed just prior to the Soviet invasion of Manchuria and was active from August 5, 1945, until October 1, 1945. History Shortly after its creation, the 2nd Far East Front was committed to the fighting against the Japanese First and Fifth Area Armies and the Japanese Fourth Army in Manchuria, Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands. In Manchuria, soldiers of the front swiftly crossed the Amur and Ussuri rivers, destroying all Japanese resistance. On August 20, the front's 15th Army took Harbin. Later, the 2nd Red Banner Army entered the Kalochzhan and Lyunchzhen regions, the 15th Army entered the Sansin region, and the 5th Rifle Corps entered the Boli region. The Japanese armies failed to offer significant resistance in these regions, and by August 20, they began to surrender and move into Soviet captivity. On August 11, elements of the 16th Army began an offensive in Southern Sakhalin and by August 18 they had captured most of the island. From August 19 to 25 the front conducted amphibious assault operations near the port of Kholmsk, and combined amphibious and airborne assault operations near the port of Korsakov. By August 25, Soviet forces had captured the administrative centre of Sakhalin, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk. By early September, Japanese forces ended their resistance, but due to slow Soviet advances on Sakhalin, the planned operation on the Japanese island of Hokkaid≈ç was never carried out. Meanwhile, an operational group composed of the 101st Rifle Division captured the Kurile Islands. On 1 October 1945, by a directive of the Stavka VGK dated 10 September 1945, the Front was disbanded and reorganised as the Far Eastern Military District (2nd Formation). Composition August 1945 The 2nd Far Eastern Front included the following units on 9 August 1945: * 2nd Red Banner Army * 5th Rifle Corps * 15th Army * 16th Army * 10th Air Army * Kamchatka Defensive Region **101st Rifle Division **198th Rifle Regiment **5th, 7th Rifle Battalions * Amur Military Flotilla * North Pacific Military Flotilla See also *Soviet Far East Front References Far East Front, 2nd ","title":"2nd Far Eastern Front"},{"id":"13259204","text":"is a Japanese aristocratic kin group.Papinot, Jacques Edmond Joseph.

The site is believed to be inhabited by snakes, and the area usually contains a representation of Naga Raja (King of the Snakes) and other Naga Devatas (snake deities), where offerings and rites are performed during special ceremonies.This is a Hindu ritual performed by the sects like the Bunts and Nairs, and all castes hold the Sarpa Kavu in reverence, with access forbidden to the area unless for due ceremonies. Origin Mythology says that Kerala was created from the Arabian Sea and given to the Brahmins (Namboothiris) as a \\"donation\\" by Parasurama to save himself from the sins of killing numerous kshathriya kings. The land was full of forests and poisonous snakes were found in plenty. So the Brahmins refused to stay there. Parasurama requested Lord Shiva to provide a solution. Shiva told Parasurama to start worshipping Anantha and vasuki the kings of snakes. Parasurama did so and Anantha advised him to start snake worship in Kerala and provide some forest especially for snakes in the form of Sarppakkavu (Snake forests). Parasurama later installed the idols of Anantha and Vasuki at Vettikkottu (near Kayamkulam in Alappuzha district) and Mannarassala(near Harippadu in Alappuzha district) and started worshipping them. The Brahmins also worshipped Anantha and Vasuki and the pleased snake gods made Kerala suitable for living. Other usage Sarpa Kavus even help in soil and water conservation besides preserving its rich biological wealth. The ponds and streams adjoining the groves are perennial water sources. These are the last resorts to many of the animals and birds for their water requirements, especially during summer. Sacred groves also enrich the soil through its rich litter composition. The nutrients generated thus are not only recycled within the sacred grove ecosystem but also find their way into the adjoining agroeco systems.

She was torpedoed and sunk with the loss of some 3,700 lives on 27 September 1944. History Ural Maru was a combined cargo/passenger vessel owned and operated by Osaka Shosen (the predecessor to Mitsui OSK Lines). She was completed in 1929 by the Mitsubishi Nagasaki Shipyards and was in regularly scheduled service between Kobe and Osaka in Japan and the port of Dairen in the Kwantung Leased Territory on the Asian mainland. Ural Maru made her first voyage on 12 April 1929. Her civilian career was relatively uneventful, although she was damaged in Osaka by a typhoon in 1934 In 1937, after the start of the Second Sino- Japanese War, Ural Maru was requisitioned by the Imperial Japanese Army and converted into a hospital ship from 13 October 1937 to February 1938, returning sick and wounded soldiers from the front back to Japan. Ural Maru was briefly returned to commercial service, but was requisitioned again by the Imperial Japanese Army in November 1941, and used primarily as a military transport to carry troops and military supplies from the Army‚Äôs primary staging area of Hiroshima in Japan to various ports in southeast Asia, including Saigon, Singapore, the Philippines, Rabaul, Rangoon and Palau in the initial stages of the war. In February 1943, she was converted to a hospital ship again, and was painted white with a large red cross, as per international regulations. On 3 April 1943, when evacuating 50 wounded soldiers from Guadalcanal, Ural Maru was bombed by USAAF Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers and lightly damaged. She managed to return to Osaka, where the damage was much publicized. [A differing record of the bomber type may be found in the Unit Diary (held in the Australian War Memorial Canberra) of 2/1 Australian Hospital Ship \\"Manunda\\". In the diary there is a \\"Special Report\\" received 5 April 1943 which stated that a USAAF B-24 (Liberator) bomber from 321st Squadron, 90th Bomber Group, had on 3 April bombed and damaged Hospital Ship \\"Ural Maru\\" off New Hanover Island in the Bismark Group (300 km N-W of Rabaul)]. Contemporary Japanese press labeled the attack on a clearly marked hospital ship carrying civilians as a war crime. In response to the Australian protest against the sinking of the hospital ship Centaur, the Japanese had lodged a counter-protest about attacks on, and the sinking of a number of their own hospital ships, including the Ural Maru. On her last voyage, Ural Maru had departed Singapore bound for Takao in Taiwan and had called on Kuching and Miri in Japanese-occupied Sarawak, where she loaded Japanese wounded, nurses and a number of \\"comfort women\\". In addition there were ten unusual passengers ‚Äì Indian National Army cadets of Indian origin on their way to Japan for military training. Only one of them, Bishan Singh, died in the sinking. One of the survivors, Ramesh S. Benegal, went on to become an officer in the Indian Air Force in independent India and retired as an Air Commodore. He provided a first-person account of the sinking of the Ural Maru in his book \\"Burma to Japan with Azad Hind - A War Memoir\\". The complement of passengers is also based on his account.Benegal; The INA cadets on board the Ural Maru were: (Malayans of Indian parentage) Narayanan, Bishan Singh, Navaratnam, Ghosh, Robert Prosper, Ranjit Das; (Burmese of Indian parentage) Benegal, Gandhi Das, Dutta, Bimol Deb. Ural Maru was torpedoed in the South China Sea and sunk on 27 September 1944 by the American submarine approximinately west of Luzon at coordinates ()Jordan As narrated by Ramesh S Benegal in his book, it was around eight in the morning when they were about to start their breakfast, when there was a loud explosion. The uneaten bowls of soup fell over and there was another explosion some distance away from the ship. Then they heard sirens and screaming. He exited hastily to the deck. He saw a thick cloud of smoke billowing from another ship of the convoy about a mile away; but the smoke was so thick that the ship was not visible. The Ural Maru began to list. He was unaware about the extent of damage but soon it was announced on the loudspeakers to prepare to abandon ship. The passengers began to help each other to put on their life jackets. As the list increased the crew shouted for everyone to abandon the ship immediately. There was a mad scramble for a lifeboat and two or three people got in when it began to be lowered. The list was making things difficult and someone cut the rope and the lifeboat plunged down. It spilled the passengers into the sea and sank. With the lifeboat gone panic stricken passengers near the rails jumped overboard. The ship was now almost vertical and the propellers had come out of the water and were still churning. Many who jumped landed on the propellers or parts of the keel of the ship. A nurse was trying to crawl along the nearly vertical deck when wooden rafts secured at the other end of the deck broke loose and came crashing down on her. Her scream prompted Benegal and his friend Narayanan to jump into the sea. They managed to swim to a wooden raft about eight to ten inches thick and six feet square with rope loops around the sides. This raft had a couple of people aboard, and Benegal and Narayanan joined them to await rescue. He had barely boarded the raft when there was a loud \\"whoosh\\" and he turned around and saw the ship half overturn and disappear into the sea.

Early life Abu Risha was born in 1969 and is three years older than his brother Abdul Sattar Buzaigh al-Rishawi. He is a member of the Dulaim tribe. Career =Anbar Awakening= On 13 September 2007, his brother Abdul Sattar Buzaigh al-Rishawi was killed along with two of his bodyguards by a roadside bomb near his home in Ramadi, Anbar, Iraq. Sheik Ahmed was selected to take over as leader of the Anbar Salvation Council by the Sheiks of Anbar province.Alissa J. Rubin-Sunni Sheik Who Backed U.S. in Iraq Is Killed-New York Times The Sheik met with President Barack Obama both before and after the 2008 Presidential Election. As of November 2008, Abu Risha had a newspaper entitled Sahwat al-Iraq (Iraq's Awakening). =Politics= The Iraq Awakening and Independents National Alliance, a political coalition led by Abu Risha, was the most successful political coalition in the 2009 Anbar governorate election, winning 8 of 29 seats. The Iraqi Salvation Council under the leadership of Shaykh Ahmed Abu Risha has just joined the newly created the Iraqi Unity Alliance, along with over 26 political parties, the most important ones, Iraqi Constitutional Party with former Interior Minister Jawad al-Bulani, Shaykh Ahmed al-Samarai, President of the Sunnis Waqf or Council, National Independent Assembly with Shaykh Omar Hechel, Saadoun al-Dulaimi, a former Minister of Defense, and so many others, because the list is still open for others to join the Alliance. The Alliance went on to fare poorly at the 2010 parliamentary election, winning only 2.66% of the vote, and 4 seats. The Alliance seemed to lose most votes to the Iraqi National Movement, led by Ayad Allawi. The Alliance's poor showing has been blamed on the Awakening Movements failure to deliver rapid economic improvements, and of Sunni Arab's turning away from the party due to Abu Risha's closeness to Nour al-Maliki prior to the election. Abu Risha joined forces with other pro-Sunni protest and pro-Federalism groups, joining the Uniters List for the 2013 Anbar governorate election. The List was the most successful single party, although lost seats when compared to how the composite members fared in the 2009 election. Although he supports the protest movement, Abu Risha opposes the creation of a Sunni Federal region similar to that of Iraqi Kurdistan. Positions Abu Risha has been critical of Iranian interference in Iraq. Following his takeover of the Anbar Salvation Council after the death of his brother, the Sheikh criticised what he described as Iranian pressure on Prime Minister Nour al-Maliki, although he shied from criticizing Maliki himself. He has accused Iran as interfering in Iraqi affairs, and of using religion as a weapon with which to pursue their own national interests. He has also accused the de-Baathification committee as being a weapon of Iranian interests in Iraq. He has criticised US disengagement from Iraq under President Barack Obama as being equivalent to the US handing Iraq over to Iran. In 2010 Abu Risha described the Sahwa, of which he is a major leader, as transitioning from the original armed movement that had fought al-Qaeda into a secular and liberal political movement that respects all religions and freedoms. Abu Risha has been critical of Islamists and religious parties in Iraq, stating that Iraqi's don't need anyone to tell them about their religious affairs, but instead desire good and stable lives, and a government that respects the rights of religions and minorities. Abu Risha has instead supported secular and nationalistic parties. He has supported movements to let more Syrian refugees into Iraq, stating, ‚ÄúWe are Muslims, they are Muslims. We are Arabs, they are Arabs, and we are happy to help them.‚Äù Support for Sunni protesters and tension with Maliki Abu Risha has been supportive of the 2012‚Äì2013 Iraqi protests. Following the killing of 5 rock throwing demonstrators by Iraqi soldiers in January 2013, Abu Risha read a statement at Fallujah's main square announcing that tribal leaders had given the government one week to bring the perpetrators of the shooting to justice. Abu Risha claimed that if this demand was not met then he promised to \\"launch jihad against army units and posts in Anbar\\". In response the Iraqi government removed his protective detail in late January 2013, although Anbar tribes offered to ensure his security instead. Abu Risha's tense relationship with Nour al-Maliki and support for the protest movement led to the Iraqi government supporting the re-election of the Sahwa leadership in February 2013. Sheikh Wissam al-Hardan was then elected over Abu Risha, in a re-election Abu Risha condemned as being imposed by the government. He has claimed that the Mukhtar Army was created and operates with the government's consent, and that despite government calls for the arrest of the group's leaders, he claims that if the government wanted to arrest the group's leadership they would have acted far sooner. He has denounced the creation of the Mukhtar Army, which claims to exist to protect Shiites, claiming that the Iraqi Army is capable of protecting Iraq's Shiite population, and that instead the aim of the Mukhtar Army is to frighten and intimidate Sunni protesters. Abu Risha has also criticized the Iraqi government for neglecting the Sahwa militia's, accusing the government of failing to pay the salaries of militia members and of not providing the militias with arms. The government has in turn accused Abu Risha of supporting al-Qaeda militants in Iraq, claims which Abu Risha denies, especially given that he has lost 26 members of his family, including his brother, in the fight against al-Qaeda in Iraq.

The term \\"cut-away\\" is used frequently in the film, in reference to parachuting and also in reference to life in general.Buchanan 2003, p. 93. Cutaway stars Tom Berenger, Stephen Baldwin, Dennis Rodman, Maxine Bahns, Ron Silver, Casper Van Dien and Thomas Ian Nicholas. This was Dennis Rodman's third film. Plot When U.S. Customs Agent, Victor \\"Vic\\" Cooper's (Stephen Baldwin) personnel file is reviewed, it shows that he struggles to disassociate his undercover identities from his real one. Despite the file's recommendation that he not return to active duty, he is cleared for work by Lieutenant Brian Margate (Ron Silver). His first action back is a raid on a Bimini-based seafood importer, who Cooper believes is smuggling drugs. He is embarrassed to find only shrimp on the aircraft, and the pilot goes free. Because Cooper personally witnessed drugs being loaded onto the aircraft, he realizes that the only way that they could have been offloaded during the flight is via parachute. He visits a random drop zone and pretends to be interested in taking lessons. Star (Maxine Bahns) shows him around and introduces him to the jump team that runs the camp. Cooper and Star begin flirting immediately, and he enjoys his lessons. She explains how most people there have \\"cut away\\" from their old lives to focus just on skydiving. The term also refers to cutting away from your main chute to use your reserve. Cooper gets Lt. Margate to approve more undercover work, and he visits the Army jump team for some tips from their leader Delmira (Casper Van Dien). When he returns to the dive camp much improved, Randy \\"Turbo\\" Kingston (Dennis Rodman) is skeptical of Cooper and remains aloof. As Cooper's dives improve, the leader of the team, Red Line (Tom Berenger) takes an interest in him. Eventually, Cooper is allowed to join the team. As his proficiency increases, he is able to enter the formation faster, which moves him further back in the roster towards Red Line, who always comes out last because he is the fastest diver. This causes internal tension, as well as hurting his romance with Star. Eventually, Turbo can no longer stand to see Cooper moving closer to his position in front of Red Line. During one dive, Red Line makes Turbo and Cooper fight to see who is the fastest. Turbo goes into a nose dive to move at maximum speed, but he breaks his neck when he plows into the team formation. With Turbo dead, Cooper is elevated to Red Line's second in command, which means that he has to take on Turbo's responsibility with helping Red Line raise money to fund the team. Red Line takes him on a job with the Bimini seafood importer. Prior to landing on Bimini, Cooper and Red Line jump out of the aircraft. They retrieve the drugs which are hidden just off the runway. Meanwhile, the pilot loads her official cargo and clears customs. Cooper and Red Line sneak back on the aircraft with the drugs, and then they dive off the aircraft again to a buyer's house. They pick up enough money to fund 100 more dives. Cooper and Red Line go on a series of jumps like this, until they end up at one where the FBI has a sting operation in place. When the FBI raids the party where Cooper and Red Line have arrived with the drugs, Lt. Margate's team moves in. In the ensuing gun fight, Red Line and Lt. Margate end up facing each other with guns drawn. Cooper tackles Red Line, and they jump off the roof together. Red Line is severely injured though, but Cooper forces the team to move forward to the Nationals, where the Army team is waiting to beat them again. Though badly impaired, Red Line manages to jump with the team, and they are competitive through the first few rounds, until a bad mistake leaves them needing a world record time to beat Army. Before the final jump, Red Line moves Cooper into his position, and the team records a 9.90 second formation jump, establishing a world record and winning the Nationals. As they are floating to the ground, Cooper reveals his identity and arrests Red Line. Not surprised at the news, Red Line stoically cuts away from his main chute and falls to the ground. Cooper mourns over Red Line's body, and walks away from Lt. Margate towards his dive team.

Background =1918‚Äì1939: Historical background= In the aftermath of the Russian Revolution of 1917, Latvia declared its independence on November 18, 1918. After a prolonged War of Independence, Latvia and Soviet Russia (the predecessor of the Soviet Union) signed a peace treaty on August 11, 1920. In its Article 2 Soviet Russia \\"unreservedly recognises the independence and sovereignty of the Latvian State and voluntarily and forever renounces all sovereign rights (...) to the Latvian people and territory.\\" The independence of Latvia was diplomatically recognised by the Allied Supreme Council (France, Great Britain, Italy, Japan, Belgium) on January 26, 1921. Other states followed the suit. On September 22, 1921 Latvia was admitted to membership in the League of Nations and remained a member until the formal dissolution of the League in 1946. On February 5, 1932, a Non-Aggression Treaty with the Soviet Union was signed, based on the August 11, 1920 treaty whose basic agreements inalterably and for all time form the firm basis of the relationship of the two states. =Relevant treaties between USSR and Latvia= Before World War II, the Republic of Latvia and USSR had both signed and ratified following treaties: ;Kellogg‚ÄìBriand Pact :August 27, 1928 Kellogg‚ÄìBriand Pact renouncing war as an instrument of national policyKellogg- Briand Pact at Yale University ;Non-aggression treaty :Latvia, USSR on February 5, 1932League of Nations Treaty Series, 1934, No. 3408, pp. 123‚Äì125 and 127 ;The Convention for the Definition of Aggression :On July 3, 1933 for the first time in the history of international relations, aggression was defined in a binding treaty signed at the Soviet Embassy in London by USSR and among others, Latvia.Aggression Defined at Time magazineLeague of Nations Treaty Series, 1934, No. 3391. :Article II defines forms of aggression.

In light of the German advance in the east, the Soviet government demanded an Anglo-French guarantee of the independence of the Baltic states, during their negotiations for an alliance with the Western Powers. The Latvian and Estonian governments, ever suspicious of Soviet intentions, decided to accept a mutual non-aggression pact with Germany. The German-Estonian and German-Latvian Non- aggression pacts were signed in Berlin on June 7, 1939 by Latvian foreign minister Vilhelms Munters and Joachim von Ribbentrop. On the next day Adolf Hitler received the Estonian and Latvian envoys, and in course of this interviews stressed maintaining and strengthening commercial links between Germany and Baltic states. Ratifications of the German-Latvian pact were exchanged in Berlin on July 24, 1939 and it became effective on the same day.

The Soviet Union did not officially admit the existence of these protocols until, under pressure from the Baltic SSRs, on December 24, 1989, the Congress of the USSR People's Deputies officially recognized the secret deals and condemned them as illegal and invalid from their inception.Jerzy W.

Page 521. = Invasion of Poland = Nazi Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939.Per Hitler's request, the Soviets transmitted coded messages to support the invading German airforce. France and Britain, which were obligated by treaty to protect Poland, responded with notes of protest requesting the Germans withdraw. Following French-British indecision, Britain acted alone moving forward with a two-hour ultimatum at 9:00am on September 3, which France was then forced to follow, issuing its own ultimatum. Nevertheless, despite declarations that a state of war now existed with Germany, the inter-Allied military conferences of September 4‚Äì6 determined there was no possibility of supporting an eastern front in Poland. France subsequently requested Britain not bomb Germany, fearing military retaliation against the French populace. It was determined to do nothing, so as to not provoke a transfer of German forces to the western front.

Smith, Page 24, During talks in Moscow, on October 2, 1939, Stalin told Vilhelms Munters, the Latvian foreign minister: \\"I tell you frankly, a division of spheres of interest has already taken place. As far as Germany is concerned we could occupy you.\\"latvians.com: The Story of Latvia: The Tragedy of 1940 The Baltics took this threat seriously. The government of Estonia accepted the ultimatum signing the corresponding agreement on September 28. 1939; Latvia following on October 5, 1939; and Lithuania shortly thereafter, on October 10, 1939. In Latvia's case it was signed by Latvian Minister of Foreign Affairs Vilhelms Munters and Soviet Commissar of Foreign Affairs Vyacheslav Molotov. Ratifications were exchanged in Riga on October 11, 1939, and the treaty became effective on the same day. It was registered in League of Nations Treaty Series on November 6, 1939.League of Nations Treaty Series, vol. 198, pp. 382-387. Articles of the treaty were: * Article 1 provided for military cooperation between the parties in case of an attack by a third party. * Article 2 obliged the Soviet government to assist the Latvian government in providing armaments. * Article 3 permitted the Soviet government to establish military and naval bases on Latvian territory. * Article 4 obliged the Soviet and Latvian governments not to engage in military alliances against the other party. * Article 5 stipulated that the political and economic systems and the sovereignty of both parties shall not be affected by the treaty. * Article 6 dealt with ratification, and stipulated that the treaty shall remain in force for ten years, with an option to extend it for further ten years. As Latvian National Foundation says the agreement called for Latvia to: * lend bases to the Soviet Union at LiepƒÅja, Ventspils, and Pitrags until 1949; * build special airfields for Soviet requirements; and * grant the stationing of Soviet military garrisons totalling 30,000 troops.These Names Accuse: Historical Introduction, Part 2 At face value, this pact did not impinge upon Latvian sovereignty.

On March 12, 1940, faced with the prospect of a complete Soviet takeover, Finland signed the Moscow Peace Treaty with the Soviet Union. Finland retained its independence, but was forced to cede 11% of its territory and lease the Hanko Peninsula to the Soviet Union as a naval base for 30 years. In June 1941, hostilities between Finland and USSR resumed in the Continuation War. 1940‚Äì1941: The first Soviet occupation =Political background= Apparent escape from Finland's fate may have led to a false sense of security for Latvia. Four months before the arrival of Soviet troops in Latvia, Vilhelms Munters, addressing an audience at the University of Latvia on February 12, 1940, stated, \\"We have every reason to describe the relations existing between Latvia and the Soviet Union as very satisfactory. There are people who will say that these favourable conditions are of a temporary nature only, and that sooner or later we shall have to reckon with internal-political and foreign- political pressure on the part of the Soviet Union. The foundation on which they base these prophesies is a secret of the prophets themselves. The experience of our Government certainly does not justify such forebodings.\\"Zalts, Alberts Zalts (ed.). Latvian Economic Review, No. 2(18) April 1940. Latvian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Riga. With Soviet failure in Finland sealed for the moment, it was little more than a month after Munters' positive expressions that Molotov, speaking on March 25, 1940, essentially announced Soviet intentions to annex the Baltic States, stating, \\"... the execution of the pacts progressed satisfactorily and created conditions favourable for a further improvement of the relations between Soviet Russia and these States.\\" Improvement of the relations being a euphemism for Soviet takeover. In March and April 1940, immediately after Molotov's speech, the Soviet press commenced attacks on the Latvian government. Next, the NKVD orchestrated a series of strikes in Riga and LiepƒÅja. When those failed to develop into a general strike, the Soviets blamed that failure on the \\"irresponsible element which spoils the good neighbourly relations.\\" Fearing Soviet action, on May 17, 1940, the Latvian government secretly issued emergency powers to the Latvian minister in London, KƒÅrlis Reinholds Zari≈Ü≈°, designating Alfreds Bilmanis, the Latvian minister in Washington, as his substitute. =Soviet invasion= Schematics of the Soviet naval military blockade of Estonia and Latvia in 1940.

November 7, 1940 May Day rally in Riga, 1941 On May 28, 1940, the Lithuanian Minister in Moscow received a note from Molotov which dealt with the alleged kidnapping of two Soviet soldiers in Vilna. The Lithuanian government sought to clear up this matter by a Soviet-Lithuanian commission under the terms of the mutual assistance pact. Moscow rejected this proposal and cut off further discussion, soon showing and rapidly playing their hand: * On June 12, 1940, the order for a total military blockade on Estonia to the Soviet Baltic Fleet is given: according to the director of the Russian State Archive of the Naval Department Pavel Petrov (C.Phil.) referring to the records in the archive Pavel Petrov at Finnish Defence Forces home page documents published from the State Archive of the Russian Navy * June 14, 1940: While world attention is focused on the fall of Paris to Nazi Germany a day earlier, Molotov accuses the Baltic countries of conspiracy against the Soviet Union and delivers an ultimatum to Lithuania for the establishment of a government the Soviets approve of. On the same day, the Soviet blockade of Estonia went into effect. According to eyewitness accounts pieced together by Estonian and Finnish investigators, two Soviet bombers downed Finnish passenger airplane Kaleva flying from Tallinn to Helsinki carrying three diplomatic pouches from the U.S. legations in Tallinn, Riga and Helsinki.

Soviets delivered ultimatums to Estonia and Latvia, to be answered within 6 hours, demanding: (1) the establishment of pro-Soviet Governments which, under the protection of the Red Army, would be better capable of carrying out the Pacts of Mutual Assistance; (2) the free passage of Soviet troops into Estonia and Latvia in order to place them in the most important centers and to avoid possible provocative acts against Soviet garrisons. Unable to resist on their own, with no external assistance available, under threat of the bombing of cities and heavily outnumbered, Latvia and Estonia capitulated. * June 17, 1940: Soviet troops invade Latvia and occupied bridges, post/telephone, telegraph, and broadcasting offices. * June 17, 1940: Andrey Vyshinsky, Deputy Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union (and prosecutor of Joseph Stalin's show trials in 1937‚Äì1938), introduces himself to President KƒÅrlis Ulmanis as Soviet special envoy. =Loss of independence= Soviet orchestration of events continued following the invasion, complete with protestors, who had arrived with the Red Army troops, organizing mass marches and meetings in order to create the impression of popular unrest: * June 19, 1940: Vishinski visits Ulmanis again, this time, to deliver the list, pre- approved by Moscow, of the new members of the cabinet of the Latvian government. * June 20, 1940: Ulmanis forced to approve pro-Soviet government which takes office.

Your Lithuania along with the other Baltic nations, including Finland, will have to join the glorious family of the Soviet Union. Therefore you should begin now to initiate your people into the Soviet system, which in the future shall reign everywhere, throughout all Europe; put into practice earlier in some places, as in the Baltic nations, later in others.\\" * July 5, 1940: Decree issued announcing new elections; the Latvian democratic parties organize under the National Committee and attempt to participate. * July 9, 1940: Vilis LƒÅcis, the Soviet-appointed Minister of Internal Affairs, orders the National Committee shut down, its most prominent members deported.

The ballots held following instructions: \\"Only the list of the Latvian Working People's Bloc must be deposited in the ballot box. The ballot must be deposited without any changes.\\" The alleged voter activity index was 97.6%. Most notably, the complete election results were published in Moscow 12 hours before the election closed. Soviet electoral documents found later substantiated that the results were completely fabricated. Tribunals were set up to punish \\"traitors to the people.\\" those who had fallen short of the \\"political duty\\" of voting Latvia into the USSR.

Latvia was incorporated as the 15th Republic of the Soviet Union. Aside from Germany, no Western nation recognizes the annexation as legitimate de jure. Accurate numbers for the losses the Soviets inflicted on Latvia are not available. They have been estimated at 35,000 dead from military action, executions, or deportation. Many more found refuge abroad. These losses all began during the first Soviet occupation. This has also been referred to, in Latvian, as \\"Baigais Gads\\" (Year of Terror). (This term was also used in anti-Soviet propaganda of the period‚Äîthese two uses should not be confused or allied in purpose. Baigais Gads is also a title of an openly antisemitic, false account of the events of the year penned by Pauls Kovalevskis, a Nazi sympathiser, in 1942.) Further mass deportations and killing were planned, however the German invasion of Soviet territory brought a halt to this. A Lithuanian government official claims to have seen a document envisaging the removal of 700,000 from Lithuania. =Soviet terror= Plaque commemorating the Victims of Soviet NKVD in Bauska, Latvia. The Soviet authorities, having gained control over Latvia, immediately imposed a regime of terror. Hundreds of men were arrested, including many leaders of the Republic of Latvia. Tribunals were set up to punish \\"traitors to the people.\\" Under arrest and liable to prompt liquidation were Latvia's President KƒÅrlis Ulmanis and Foreign Minister Vilhelms Munters. Immediate confiscation of property and execution within 24 hours was decreed for diplomats abroad who refused to recognize the new regimes and return to Latvia. Later orders expanded the list of repressions, including anyone related to someone in hiding from the government or who had fled abroad‚Äîwhich act made them a traitor to the state. On June 22, 1940, all three Baltic parliaments passed initial resolutions on the nationalization of land, followed in Latvia by a Bill of Land Reform a week later. Initially, a maximum of 30 hectares of land could be used by a family, reduced during the second Soviet occupation to 15‚Äì20 hectares. The June deportation took place on June 13 and June 14, 1941, estimated at 15,600 men, women, and children, and including 20% of Latvia's last legal government. Approximately 35,000 total (1.8% of Latvia's population) were deported during the first Soviet occupation. Stalin's deportations also included thousands of Latvian Jews. (The mass deportation totalled 131,500 across the Baltics.) According to the Serov Instructions, the deportations were swift and efficient and came in the middle of the night. Deportees were given an hour or less to get ready to leave. They were allowed to take with them their belongings not exceeding 100 kg in weight (money, food for a month, cooking appliances, clothing). The families would then be taken to the railway station. That was when they discovered that the men were to be separated from the women and children: \\"In view of the fact that a large number of deportees must be arrested and distributed in special camps and that their families must proceed to special settlements in distant regions, it is essential that the operation of removal of both the members of the deportee's family and its head shall be carried out simultaneously, without notifying them of the separation confronting them ... The convoy of the entire family to the station shall be effected in one vehicle and only at the station of departure shall the head of the family be placed separately from his family in a car specially intended for heads of families.\\" The trains were escorted by a NKVD officer and military convoy. Packed into barred cattle cars, with holes in the floor for sanitation, the deportees were taken to Siberia. Many died before even reaching their final destination because of harsh conditions. Many more perished during their first winter. A number of Latvians who managed to avoid deportations decided to hide in the forests, where anti-Soviet units were organized. When Nazi Germany attacked Soviet Union, those rebels immediately went into collaboration with Nazi Germany.Chris Bellamy. The Absolute War. Soviet Russia in the Second World War, page 196. Vintage Books, New York 2008. Aftermath =Occupation of Latvia by Nazi Germany 1941‚Äì1944= Residents of Riga welcome the arrival of Nazi troops The Soviet-German war cut short this first year of Soviet occupation. The Nazi offensive, launched June 22, 1941, just over a week after the mass deportations were executed, entered Riga on July 1, 1941. This disrupted documented NKVD plans to deport several hundred thousand more from the Baltic states on June 27 and 28, 1941. With memories of the mass deportations of a week before still fresh, the German troops were widely greeted at their arrival by the Latvians as liberators. The Latvian national anthem played on the radio, and, as Chris Bellamy wrote: \\"the [anti-Soviet] rebellion broke out immediately after the news of Barbarossa\\". The majority of ethnic Latvians who had been forced to serve in the Red Army deserted from their units, and soon afterwards attacked the NKVD. On July 2, 1941, a unit of Latvian deserters captured the town of Sigulda, and three days later, Latvian rebels took control over another town, Smiltene, also blocking the strategic road to Pskov. Latvians did not only desert en masse from regular Red Army units, they also escaped from military training camps, which were part of the Soviet mobilization plan. Among other battles with retreating Soviet units, Bellamy mentions Limba≈æi (July 4), Olaine (July 5), and Al≈´ksne (July 9). All these locations were captured by Latvian rebels before the first Wehrmacht units appeared in the area. Nazi Germany, however, had no plan or desire to restore autonomy to Latvia, even though they ordered Colonel Alexander Plesners to oversee formation of the Latvian Defence Forces. On July 8, the Germans announced that wearing of non-German uniforms was banned. Also, rebel units were ordered to disarm. Jewish fears of the Nazis‚Äîwhich had led some to look upon the Soviet occupation as a measure of security‚Äîwere to prove tragically well founded. By July 10, 1941, German armed forces had occupied all of Latvia's territory. Latvia became a part of Nazi Germany's Reichskommissariat Ostland ‚Äì the Province General of Latvia (Generalbezirk Lettland). Anyone who was disobedient to the German occupation regime as well as those who had co-operated with the Soviet regime were killed or sent to concentration camps. In 1939 Generalplan Ost was drawn up by Nazi Germany covering eastern countries. As regards Latvia, it was determined that the population of around 2,000,000 should be reduced by 50%, those remaining being considered worthy of \\"Germanisation\\". Accordingly, Jews, Romani people, communists, army officers, politicians, and other intellectuals all found themselves being rounded up. Further reductions in the civilian population would be achieved through the creation of food shortages, resulting in mass starvation. =Second Soviet occupation 1944‚Äì1991= The Riga Offensive was part of the larger Baltic Offensive on the Eastern Front during World War II. It took place late in 1944, and drove German forces from the city of Riga. Latvia was again occupied by the Soviet Union from 1944 to 1991. Under the Soviet occupation thousands of Latvians were deported to Siberian camps, executed or forced into exile. Many Latvians fled in fishermen's boats and ships to Sweden and Germany, from where until 1951 they drifted to various parts of the Western world (mostly Australia and North America). Approximately 150,000 Latvians ended up in exile in the West. According to approximate estimates, as a result of World War II the population of Latvia decreased by half a million (25% less than in 1939). In comparison with 1939 the Latvian population had diminished by about 300,000. The war also inflicted heavy losses on the economy ‚Äì many historic cities were destroyed, as well as industry and the infrastructure. In July 1989, following the dramatic events in East Germany, the Latvian Supreme Soviet adopted a \\"Declaration of Sovereignty\\" and amended the Constitution to assert the supremacy of its laws over those of the USSR. On August 23, 1989 political demonstration Baltic Way took place. Approximately two million people joined their hands to form an over 600 kilometre long human chain across the three Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania).This demonstration was organized to draw the world's attention to the common historical fate which these three countries suffered. In March 1990 candidates from the pro-independence party Latvian Popular Front gained a two-thirds majority in the Supreme Council in democratic elections. On May 4, 1990, the Latvian Council declared its intention to restore full Latvian independence. Soviet political and military forces tried unsuccessfully to overthrow the Latvian government. On August 21, 1991, Latvia claimed de facto independence. International recognition, including that of the USSR, followed. The United States, which had never recognized Latvia's forcible annexation by the USSR, resumed full diplomatic relations with Latvia on September 2, 1991.Background Note: Latvia at US Department of State In February 1992, Russia agreed to start withdrawing its troops from Latvia.RUSSIA, LATVIA AGREE ON TROOP WITHDRAWAL Deseret News.

Image:BALTICO_RIGA.jpgSoviet troops in Riga, October 1944 File:PlakƒÅts.Latvijas PSR ƒ£erbonis.Himnas vƒÅrdi.jpgSoviet propaganda poster in Latvia, 1945 Historical Soviet version of events \\"The Spirit of Great Lenin and his victorious banner inspire us for the Great Patriotic War\\" (Stalin) : Up to the reassessment of Soviet history that began during the Perestroika, which led to the official condemnation of the 1939 secret protocol by the Soviet government, the Soviet position on the events of 1939‚Äì1940 is summarised as follows: The Government of the Soviet Union suggested to the Government of the Republic of Latvia that they conclude a treaty of mutual assistance between the two countries. Pressure from the Latvian working peoples forced the Latvian government to accept this offer. A Pact of Mutual Assistance was signed1939 USSR-Latvia Mutual Aid Pact (full text) allowing the USSR to station a limited number of Red Army units in Latvia. Economic difficulties, dissatisfaction with the Latvian government policies \\"that had sabotaged fulfillment of the Pact and the Latvian government\\" and political orientation towards Nazi Germany led to a revolutionary situation culminating in June 1940. To guarantee fulfillment of the Pact, additional Soviet military units entered Latvia, welcomed by the Latvian workers who demanded the resignation of the bourgeoisie Latvian government and its fascist leader, KƒÅrlis Ulmanis.Concise Encyclopedia of the Latvian SSR That same June, under the leadership of the Latvian Communist Party, the Latvian workers held demonstrations, and on that day, the fascist government was overthrown, and a People's Government formed. Elections for the Latvian Parliament were held shortly thereafter in July 1940. The \\"Working People's Union\\", created by an initiative of the Latvian Communist Party, received the vast majority of the votes.Great Soviet Encyclopedia The Parliament adopted the declaration of the restoration of Soviet power in Latvia and proclaimed the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic. The parliament then declared Latvia's wish to freely and willingly join the USSR, adopting a resolution to that effect. That request was approved by the Supreme Soviet of the USSR and Latvia became a constituent republic of the USSR. Conflicting versions of history Welles Declaration, condemning the 1940 occupation by the Soviet Union of Latvia and the two other Baltic states, and refusing to recognize their annexation as Soviet Republics The issue of the Soviet occupation, its motives and consequences, remains a bone of contention between the Baltic states and Russia. At the core lie different versions of the historical events during World War II and after: the Latvian (shared also by Estonia and Lithuania and widely espoused by Western historical scholarship) and the Soviet one, which continues to be supported and defended by the government of Russia. According to the European Court of Human Rights, the Government of Latvia, the United States, and the European Union, the occupation of Latvia by the USSR in 1940, and its subsequent re-incorporation in the Soviet Union in 1944, was illegal. According to this account, the lawful government of Latvia was overthrown in 1940 and Soviet rule was imposed by force. Subsequently, the Soviet Union conducted large-scale and systematic actions including murder and mass deportations against the Latvian population. Rigged elections were organized in which only Soviet-supported candidates were permitted to run;A Historical Dictionary of European National Groups; p238 results were accidentally released to the Western press in London before the elections were even complete. As reported by Time in 1940, those who had failed to have their passports stamped for voting Latvia into the USSR were allowed to be shot in the back of the head by Soviet NKVD, The country remained occupied by the Soviet Union until restoration of its independence in 1991. The 48 years of Soviet occupation and annexation of the Baltic States was never recognized as legal by the Western democracies. The United States especially applied the earlier-adopted Stimson Doctrine to the issue of the Baltic states, leading to its becoming an established precedent in International Law. While the Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union condemned the annexation of Latvia and the other Baltic states prior to the dissolution of the USSR,The resolution passed December 24, 1989, stated the annexation had been \\"in conflict with the sovereignty and independence of a number of third countries.\\" Kohen, M. Secession: International Law Perspectives, Cambridge University Press, 2006 the Russian Federation, the legal successor state of the USSR, does not recognize the forcible occupation of Latvia by the Soviet Union. Specifically in reference to Latvia, the Russian Duma passed a resolution to \\"remind the deputies of the Latvian Saeima that Latvia's being a part of the Soviet Union was grounded by fact and by law from the international juridical point of view.\\"Reported in Pravda on Friday, November 19, 1999. This declaration states the incorporation of Latvia into the USSR was legal according to the laws of the Soviet Union and according to international law (de jure). The government of Russia further maintains that the Soviet Union liberated Latvia from the Germans in 1944.

After placing 2nd to Belgium's Raymond Ceulemans three times (1970, 1972 and 1973) in the UMB World Three-cushion Championship, Kobayashi turned things around and defeated Ceulemans for the world title in 1974. With this win, he ended Ceulemans' 10-year reign as champion. Kobayashi later admitted that he had been taping on camera Ceulemans' performances in a 1969 tournament in Tokyo in order to study the Belgian's playing style. A decade later, he won it again at the expense of Ludo Dielis. He defended it unsuccessfully the following year, losing to Ceulemans again. For more than three decades, he was the only Asian native (not counting Sang Lee who represented the United States at the time) ever to win a World Three-cushion Championship. Two other players from Japan were close to achieving a world title but both were not very fortunate. This was until Ryuuji Umeda, another Japanese, won the title in 2007.

The vessel, named for a mountain on Formosa, was initially used as a troop transport. The vessel was then turned over for use for the transportation of prisoners of war (POWs) from the Philippines to Manchuria, China or Japan. On October 24, 1944 the ship was torpedoed by an American submarine and sank. Of the 1,781 POWs aboard, all of them escaped the sinking ship but were not rescued by the Japanese. In the end, only nine of the prisoners survived the sinking. Description Arisan Maru was a Type 2A freighter that measured , was long overall and between perpendiculars with a beam of . The vessel was powered by steam turbines turning one propeller. The vessel had three holds, with No.2 hold being . The vessel was designed for the transportation of raw materials such as coal and nickel. Service history Arisan Maru was constructed by Mitsui at their yard in Tamano, Japan with the yard number 376. The freighter was completed on 22 June 1944 and owned by Mitsui Senpaku. The vessel was named for a mountain in Formosa and was first assigned to transport 6,000 troops of the Kwantung Army from Pusan, Korea to Okinawa. The vessel was then ordered to transport POWs from the Philippines to Manchuria, China, or Japan. Three tiers of bunks were installed that were separated by . On October 11, 1944, Arisan Maru embarked 1,782 Allied POWs at Manila, a mix of military personnel and civilian detainees. Detained Allied personnel were being evacuated from the Philippines and due to Allied air raids, they were quickly loaded onto the ship, with more people placed in the one hold than could be reasonably accommodated. Each POW was given eight five-gallon oil cans for their waste, which quickly overflowed due to a number of men afflicted by dysentery. The POWs suffered through unsanitary conditions, extreme heat within the hold () and a lack of water. Arisan Maru then departed Manila and sailed south to the west coast of Palawan. During this time an escape attempt led to a POW death, and four other POWs died of sickness. There, along the Palawan coast, Arisan Maru waited for several days while Allied air raids hit Manila. Then, on October 20, the freighter returned to Manila. =Final voyage= On October 21, Arisan Maru departed Manila for the final time, joining convoy MATA-30 heading for Takao. The convoy was composed of 13 merchant vessels, three destroyers as escorts and one fleet supply ship. Arisan Maru was one of the slowest ships in the convoy, capable of making no more than . On October 23, the destroyers began picking up signals from American submarines. Roughly west of Cape Bojeador, Luzon, the convoy was ordered to break up due to the sheer number and to sail at fastest possible speed for Takao (modern day Kaohsiung Taiwan) due to the American submarine threat. On October 24, 1944, Arisan Maru, by then traveling alone, was hit by a torpedo from , at about 5 p.m. in the No.3 hold. The ship buckled amidships, the engines stopped and the aft mast fell, but the freighter stayed afloat. She finally sank around 7:40 p.m at . In response to the torpedo, the destroyers and attacked and sank Shark. After dealing with the American submarine, the two destroyers returned to Arisan Maru to look for survivors. No POWs were killed by the torpedo strikes and nearly all were able to leave the ship's holds but the Japanese did not rescue any of the POWs that day, only Japanese. Only nine of the prisoners aboard survived the event. Five escaped and made their way to China in one of the ship's two lifeboats. They were reunited with U.S. Forces and returned to the United States. The four others were later recaptured by Imperial Japanese naval vessels, where one died shortly after reaching land.

In 1973, he graduated from East Tennessee State University with a Bachelor of Science degree, and in 1975 he earned his master's degree when he graduated from Eastern Kentucky University. Political views and sponsored legislation In August 2007, Gary Odom sponsored a bill that made \\"doctor shopping,\\" the practice of obtaining multiple prescriptions of the same or similar drugs from multiple doctors, a felony for patients on TennCare. He introduced a bill that would have required hunters to have permission of homeowners before firing weapons on private property and within of someone's home, and after that was rejected by a House subcommittee, he introduced a bill to authorize local governments to regulate hunting. In February 1998, he sponsored a bill that allowed Tennessee's 51 parks to put up voluntary donation boxes. He voted against a bill that would have amended the Tennessee State Constitution to state that abortion is not included as a right to privacy in Tennessee. He was opposed to one aspect of Nashville, Tennessee's tree ordinance, which required 14 tree units, or about 28 small trees, to be planted per paved acre. Another option for large trucking companies was to make a payment to the city's tree fund, and a friend of Gary Odom owed the city's tree fund $191,000 as a result. He stated the ordinance is impractical for large industrial sites such as the lot Western Express owns.

He succeeded his father as king of Cyrene in 530 BC and was ruler until he was killed by Cyrenaean exiles around 515 BC. Ancestry Arcesilaus was the son of the fifth Cyrenaean King, Battus III and queen Pheretima. His sister was Ladice, who married the Ancient Egyptian Pharaoh Amasis II. Although his maternal grandparents are unknown, his paternal grandparents were the queen Eryxo and king Arcesilaus II. First reign and exile When his father died in 530 BC, Arcesilaus became the new king. In 525 BC, Arcesilaus made an alliance with the King Cambyses II of Persia. Cambyses had recently conquered Egypt and added the country to his empire. Herodotus describes his character as a ‚Äògreat rumpus‚Äò. About 518 BC, Arcesilaus could no longer accept the Cyrenaean constitutional changes introduced by his late father and the Greek lawmaker, Demonax, and demanded the restoration of his ancestral rights. He was supported by his mother. In the civil struggles that followed, Arcesilaus was defeated and fled to the Greek island of Samos, while his mother fled to the court of king Euelthon in Salamis, Cyprus. Pheretima sought troops from the king of Salamis, but he refused to agree to her request. In Samos, Arcesilaus recruited men for his army by promising to grant them land in Cyrene. Once he got his army together, he travelled to the oracle at Delphi to consult about his future in Cyrene. The priestess stated to him that his family would have a kingship in Cyrene for eight generations under four rulers named Battus and four rulers named Arcesilaus. She advised him to make no attempt to keep power beyond that period. She also advised him to be careful in how he treated the Cyrenaean citizens and that if he were cruel to them, they would go against him. Arcesilaus subsequently ignored the priestess' advice. Restoration and death Arcesilaus returned to Cyrene with his army and was able to regain power, driving his political opponents out of Cyrene and into exile. His supporters received their land, but out of fear of a backlash (and ignoring the oracle‚Äôs advice), Arcesilaus left Cyrene and went to the Cyrenaean town of Barca, whose governor, Alazir, was his father-in-law. While in the marketplace in Barca with his father-in-law, some Cyrenaean exiles recognised Arcesilaus. The exiles approached the two men and killed them. Arcesilaus was buried near his paternal ancestors in Cyrene. Arcesilaus was succeeded by his mother, who ruled Cyrene until her death later in 515 BC. After her death, she was succeeded by Arcesilaus's only son, Battus IV.

It is believed that Crassus adopted the future consul Marcus Licinius Crassus Frugi from the Calpurnius Piso family.Ronald Syme, \\"Piso Frugi and Crassus Frugi\\", Journal of Roman Studies, 50 (1960), pp. 12-20 Military career Crassus was a Roman general, who fought first with Sextus Pompey and Mark Antony before defecting to Octavian. Octavian then appointed him as his colleague as consul for 30 BC, even though Crassus had not been praetor, the office that was traditionally a prerequisite for the consulship. Dispatched to Macedonia in 29 BC, he moved against the Bastarnae, a tribe of mixed ethnicity (Scythian, Dacian, and Germanic) who had crossed the Danube and threatened Roman allies in neighboring Thrace. He drove them back toward the Danube and finally defeated them in pitched battle, killing their King Deldo in single combat.Cassius Dio 51.23.3 ff. By Roman tradition, he was thus entitled to the Spolia opima, but Octavian blocked the privilege, apparently wishing to downplay the successes of individual generals in favor of his own prestige. Crassus likewise did not receive the agnomen of Scythicus to commemorate his victory.\\"Legio III Scythica\\" . However, Octavian eventually did grant him a triumph upon his return to Rome. Notably Octavian had left Rome to travel round the Western provinces of the Empire by the time the triumph took place and history does not record any further deeds of Crassus.Syme, The Augustan Arstocracy (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1986), pp. 273-275 See also * Licinia (gens) References 1st-century BC Romans Ancient Roman generals Licinius Crassus, Marcus (724 AUC) Marcus (consul 724 AUC) Senators of the Roman Republic Year of birth unknown Year of death unknown ","title":"Marcus Licinius Crassus (consul 30 BC)"},{"id":"13259577","text":"Fritillaria uva-vulpis is a bulbous perennial plant belonging to the genus Fritillaria and native to eastern Turkey, north-western Iraq and western Iran.\\"Botanica.

Flowering Fritillaria uva-vulpis Dormant bulb of Fritillaria uva-vulpis in autumn The plant is very similar to Fritillaria assyriaca which, however, has stolons on the stem, a flower with a more greenish tinge and a slightly flaring mouth and tends to grow at higher altitudes. Cultivation The fox-grape fritillary was introduced by Polly and Paul Furse to Britain from Iran.Anna Pavord, Bulb. 222 It needs hot and dry summers, and fertile, humus-rich soil. In Britain, it is best kept in pots. The bulb spreads readily by grains, which need several years before they reach flowering size. The bulbs should be planted 10 cm deep. In Britain, it flowers in April. The plant is easy to grow, provided it is not out-competed by its neighbours.

Mamia III Gurieli (), also known as Mamia the Great Gurieli (·Éì·Éò·Éì·Éò ·Éí·É£·É†·Éò·Éî·Éö·Éò, Didi Gurieli) or the Black Gurieli (·É®·Éê·Éï·Éò ·Éí·É£·É†·Éò·Éî·Éö·Éò, Shavi Gurieli) (died 5 January 1714), of the western Georgian House of Gurieli, was Prince of Guria from 1689 to 1714. Involved in civil wars plaguing western Georgia, he became King of Imereti three times in the years of 1701, 1711‚Äì1712, and 1713‚Äì1714. After his first reign as king for a year in 1701, he abdicated the throne of Imereti, being unable to tolerate the influence of his father-in-law Giorgi Abashidze. Subsequent periods of his royal career was the result of a feud with Giorgi VII of Imereti. Mamia died while still sitting on the throne of Imereti, which then reverted to his rival Giorgi VII.  Accession and early rule in Guria  Mamia was a younger son of Giorgi III Gurieli and Tamar Chijavadze. On Giorgi's death at the battle of Rokiti against King Alexander IV of Imereti in 1684, Mamia joined his brothers in exile in Akhaltsikhe under the protection of its Ottoman governor Yusuf-Pasha. In the subsequent infighting between Mamia's elder brother Kaikhosro and his paternal uncle Malakia, the former lost his life, while the latter was deprived of his sight. Eventually, in 1689, at the request of Guria's nobility, Mamia was summoned from Akhaltsikhe and installed as prince-regnant with the pasha's support, while the blinded Malakia was made Bishop of Shemokmedi by the new Gurieli ruler. In 1690, Mamia hosted Giorgi XI, the exiled king of Kartli and a foe of Alexander IV of Imereti, but soon became suspicious of his nobles' loyalty to the guest and began a crackdown on the suspected opposition, forcing Giorgi to relocate to the Ottoman-controlled Gonio. In the incessant power struggles in Imereti, Mamia originally supported his father-in-law Giorgi Abashidze, but, in 1699, he helped Abashidze's estranged son-in-law, King Simon, return from his exile in Kartli and recover the crown of Imereti. In return, Simon agreed to divorce Abashidze's daughter Anika and marry Mamia's sister. Abashidze, supported by the Mingrelian regent Giorgi Lipartiani, marshaled his troops on the borders of Guria and requested that Gurieli kill Simon, promising to make Mamia king of Imereti. Gurieli refused to do that himself, but allowed Abashidze's agents to shoot Simon dead in a bathroom in 1701.  First reign in Imereti and Ottoman invasion  Pursuant to his promise, Abashidze made Mamia king of Imereti, if in name only. Abashidze controlled royal domains, revenues, and nobility, while Mamia had to sell his Gurian subjects in slavery to meet his own expenses. Later that year, Mamia felt compelled to abdicate and retire to Guria. Abashidze made himself king of Imereti and, thus, a suzerain of Guria and Mingrelia. In 1703, Guria as well as the rest of western Georgia faced a major invasion by the Ottoman Empire. Eager to tighten a loosening grip over their Caucasian subjects, the Ottomans mounted a large-scale invasion, with the intention to eliminate the sovereignty of Guria and limit that of Imereti. A revolt of the troops bound to Georgia forced the Ottomans to withdraw from Georgia's interior, but the coastal area around Batumi was permanently lost for Guria.  Second and third reigns in Imereti  By 1707, the unity imposed by Abashidze on western Georgia crumbled. In 1709, Abashidze and his Mingrelian allies were defeated by his rival Giorgi VII, who enjoyed the Ottomans' support. Giorgi then raided and ravaged Guria in response of Mamia's support of Abashidze. Giorgi's corrupt rule soon became intolerable to the Imeretians; in October 1711, Mamia secured the support of the nobles of Mingrelia, Racha, and Lechkhumi and reestablished himself as king of Imereti, leaving Guria to his son Giorgi IV Gurieli. During his tenure, he banned slave-trading and opened schools in Guria. Both Giorgi VII and Giorgi Abashidze took refuge with King Vakhtang VI of Kartli, who attempted to end the feud. Abashidze returned to his estates in Imereti. The deposed king Giorgi went to Akhaltsikhe and conspired with Zurab Abashidze, Giorgi Abashidze's nephew, who had been dispossessed by Mamia. In June 1712, Giorgi VII and Zurab Abashidze secretly invaded the district of Argveti and inflicted defeat on Mamia and Giorgi Abashidze at Chkhari. Gurieli fled to Racha and then to Kartli, where he was hosted in Tskhinvali by Vakhtang VI's son Bakar. Supported by the government of Kartli, Mamia made his way to Guria. In November 1713, Mamia Gurieli, joined by Dadiani, the duke of Racha, Giorgi Abashidze, and the Lechkhumians, defeated King Giorgi at Kutaisi and forced him into flight to Akhaltsikhe. Mamia died two months later, on 5 January 1714 and Giorgi VII was restored once again. Mamia's remains were taken to Guria and interred at the Shemokmedi Monastery.  Family  Mamia Gurieli was married twice. He first wed, in 1698, Elene, daughter of Giorgi Abashidze. Their marriage was repudiated in 1711 and Mamia married Tamar (died 1716), daughter of Papuna I, Duke of Racha, and former wife of Prince Papuna Chkheidze. After the death of Mamia, she married his husband's rival King Giorgi VII of Imereti, but died shortly after the marriage and was buried at Gelati. Mamia had seven children, four sons and three daughters: * Prince Giorgi IV Gurieli (1702‚Äì1726), Regent in Guria (1711‚Äì1714), Prince of Guria (1714‚Äì1726), King of Imereti (1716); * Prince Kaikhosro III Gurieli (died c. 1751), rival Prince of Guria (1716); * Prince Nikoloz (died 1755), Bishop of Semokmedi c. 1719; * Prince Levan, rival regent in Guria (1711‚Äì1713); * Princess Tamar (died 1742), who was married to Giorgi IV Dadiani from 1710 to 1714 and Giorgi VII of Imereti from 1716 to 1720; * Princess N., wife of Aslan-Pasha of Akhaltsikhe; * Princess N., wife of Giorgi Shervashidze, Duke in Guria.

Born Peter Hesketh, he changed his name by Royal assent to Hesketh-Fleetwood, incorporating the name of his ancestors, and was later created Baronet Fleetwood. Predeceased by an older brother, he inherited estates in west Lancashire in 1824. Inspired by the transport developments of the early 19th century, he decided to bring the railway to the Lancashire coast and develop a holiday resort and port. He hired architect Decimus Burton to design his new town, which he named Fleetwood; construction began in 1836. Hesketh-Fleetwood was instrumental in the formation of the Preston and Wyre Railway Company and with his financial support, a railway line was built between Preston and Fleetwood which opened in 1840. Hesketh- Fleetwood married twice and had several children, most of whom died in infancy. His new town flourished, but the expense of building it left him close to bankruptcy and forced him to sell most of his estates including Rossall Hall, which had been his family home. He left Lancashire and died in London, succeeded by his son Louis. Early life and family Peter Hesketh- Fleetwood painted by William Charles Ross in 1826 Peter Hesketh was born in 1801 at Wennington Hall, in Wennington, near Lancaster, the second son of Robert and Maria (n√©e Rawlinson) Hesketh. He had an older brother, Edward, a younger brother, Charles, and a younger sister, Anna. He was descended (through his paternal grandmother) from the Fleetwood family who had owned the large Rossall estate in West Lancashire for over 200 years. Robert inherited the estate in 1819 on the death of his elder brother, Bold, and the family relocated to the manor house, Rossall Hall, on the Fylde coast. On Robert's death in 1824, the estate passed to Peter, his elder brother Edward having predeceased him in 1820. By that time the family's land extended from Heysham in the north, to North Meols, near Southport, in the south, and encompassed most of the Fylde. Hesketh was educated, along with his younger brother Charles, at Trinity College, Oxford. Although Charles was a studious young man, who planned to enter the church on graduation, Peter had an active social life in both Oxford and London. He holidayed in southern resorts including St Leonards-on-Sea, a new development in Sussex, where he admired the work of architect James Burton. He became close friends with Burton's son Decimus, who was also an architect. The two men were involved in the formation of London's Athenaeum Club and Burton designed the club's building in Pall Mall. Hesketh received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1823 and his Master of Arts degree in 1826. That same year, he married Eliza Debonnaire Metcalfe, the daughter of Sir Theophilus Metcalfe, 2nd Baronet, commonly known by her middle name. Debonnaire's father gave the couple a house in Dover, but they also spent time at the Rossall estate. The couple were very close to Charles and his new wife Anna, and their sister Anna, and her husband Thomas Knowlys. Charles was ordained in 1828 and as patron of St Chad's Church in Poulton-le-Fylde, Peter presented his brother with that curacy. Hesketh enjoyed looking after the Rossall estate (which had no steward or agent), but struggled to keep on top of finances; he was an indulgent landlord. He became an enthusiastic member of the Lancashire Agricultural Society and was concerned about the fate of local farm workers who were losing their jobs because of increased mechanisation. Hesketh was gradually becoming more interested in the lives and conditions of the working classes. The Heskeths' first child, Anna Maria (known as Maria to distinguish her from three close relatives named Anna), was born in 1827. Three more children‚Äînamed Metcalfe Bold, Debonnaire and Frances‚Äîall died in infancy. In 1831 Hesketh changed his name by royal licence to Hesketh- Fleetwood, incorporating the better-known family name of his ancestors into his own. Debonnaire contracted tuberculosis and died in early 1833. Shortly before Debonnaire's death Hesketh-Fleetwood contracted scarlet fever. This was followed by erysipelas, a bacterial infection so severe that it necessitated the removal of one of his eyes. At the end of the year, the Rossall estate was severely flooded and suffered damage costing about ¬£3,000 to repair. Hesketh- Fleetwood subsequently spent very little time at Rossall. In 1837 in Belgium, Hesketh-Fleetwood married Virginie Marie Garcia, the daughter of a Spanish nobleman. Maria, his daughter with Debonnaire, contracted tuberculosis and died in 1838 at Regent's Park, aged 11. She was interred in a glass coffin in the family vault at St Chad's, Poulton. Around the same time as Maria's death, Virginie gave birth to a son, Peter Louis. In 1841, on the death of his aunt, Anna Maria Hesketh, Hesketh-Fleetwood succeeded to Tulketh Hall in Preston. Politics Hesketh was appointed High Sheriff of Lancashire in 1830. In 1831 he was invited to stand as a Tory Party candidate for the constituency of Preston. He had similar views to Tory statesman Robert Peel and readily agreed to stand. Hesketh-Fleetwood opposed monopolies, slavery and capital punishment and was in favour of reforming the Corn Laws. At the 1832 general election, he was elected‚Äîalong with his friend, Henry Smith-Stanley‚ÄîMember of Parliament for Preston, in the first parliament following the Reform Act. He made his maiden speech to parliament in 1834. Queen Victoria came to the throne in 1837, and in June the following year Hesketh-Fleetwood was knighted in the Coronation honours list and created Baronet Fleetwood. He remained MP for Preston until the 1847 general election, although towards the end of his parliamentary career he was recorded as a Liberal MP. In 1840 he translated Victor Hugo's pamphlet, The Last Day of a Condemned Man, with a foreword entitled \\"Observations on capital punishment\\" that made clear Hesketh- Fleetwood's abolitionist stance on the issue. Development of Fleetwood As a student holidaying in coastal towns, Hesketh had become aware of the lack of resorts in Lancashire. He was concerned that the working classes of Lancashire could not afford to travel south for their holidays as wealthy people like him could. The number of railways in Great Britain steadily increased in the first half of the 19th century, and Hesketh was impressed by the arrival in 1828 of the steam locomotive in Lancashire. As High Sheriff of Lancashire, he attended the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway on 15 December 1830. The event filled him with great excitement at the idea of bringing the railway to the coast and enabling Lancashire mill workers to take day-trips to the seaside. As he discussed the idea with his brother Charles, Hesketh soon realised that day-trippers would need certain facilities that were not yet available, and decided that a new town would need to be built. He initially planned to site his town and railway terminus near the village of Thornton, but it was not close enough to the coast for his liking. He eventually decided on Rossall Point, a small peninsula north of Rossall Hall, at the mouth of the River Wyre, which was then an uninhabited rabbit warren. Although bleak and waterlogged, the area had views of Morecambe Bay and the Lake District. Hesketh was influenced in the early planning stages by his friends, including mill owners Samuel Fielden and Benjamin Whitworth. They pointed out that mill workers would not wish to make day trips to the seaside all year round, and wondered how the people of the new town would be occupied during the winter months. They encouraged Hesketh to build a new port; because charges at Liverpool were on the rise, and there were no reasonable alternatives for Manchester mill owners, both Whitworth and Fielden agreed that they would make good use of a port on the Fylde coast. Hesketh soon found that he was not the only one thinking of extending the railway, or of building a new port. He had competition from the residents of Lytham, a village about south of Rossall, at the mouth of the River Ribble. They were already planning the formation of the Preston Port Company; Hesketh acted quickly and applied to the official railway committee to have a port built on the River Wyre. The committee agreed to hear all applications. Charles met Frederick Kemp, a land agent newly arrived in Poulton from his native Essex, and introduced him to his brother, who was on the lookout for a steward or agent. Kemp, well-dressed and charming, made a good impression on Hesketh, who employed him immediately. At the meeting of the railway committee Hesketh put forward a persuasive argument. Despite opposition from the Lytham contingent the committee decided that Rossall Point was the best place for the railway terminus to be built, and the Railway and Port Company was formed. In the early 19th century it was thought that steam locomotives would be unable to negotiate hilly terrain, and that Lake District hills like Shap Fell would prevent the railway from reaching Scotland. The Fylde terminus would have even more importance than Hesketh had hoped, providing a sea link for passengers from London to travel on to Scotland. Initially Hesketh had considered naming his new town New Liverpool or Wyreton, but after changing his name to Hesketh-Fleetwood in 1831 he decided to call it Fleetwood. With a new career in parliament to prepare for, he readily handed over financial management of the project to his manager, Frederick Kemp. Fleetwood architect Decimus Burton After Debonnaire's death in 1833, Hesketh-Fleetwood immersed himself in his development plans. Southport, a town he owned much of, was becoming a popular sea bathing resort, and Hesketh-Fleetwood organised the construction of a promenade. He was becoming concerned over delays on the part of the Railway and Port Company and decided to get on with building Fleetwood. He hired his old friend Decimus Burton, who had become a successful architect, and together they discussed what buildings would be required. Hesketh-Fleetwood wanted a church, docks, housing, a gas office, a school and a hotel. Burton agreed that a hotel would be important for passengers to spend the night before travelling on to Scotland. Because those passengers would be arriving from Euston railway station in London, Hesketh-Fleetwood decided to call the hotel the North Euston Hotel. Burton's plans were ready by 1835. In 1835, still frustrated by the lack of activity on the part of the Railway and Port Company, Hesketh- Fleetwood organised the formation of the Preston and Wyre Railway Company to raise the funds required to bring the railway to Fleetwood. The estimated cost was ¬£122,000. The company obtained Royal assent to start construction, with an underwritten guarantee from Hesketh-Fleetwood. The following year Hesketh- Fleetwood and Burton oversaw the marking out of Fleetwood's first street, and the first railway lines were laid. By 1838 it had become clear that construction costs for the town were spiralling out of control. To make matters worse, the railway's engineer informed Hesketh-Fleetwood that the cost of the railway was expected to exceed ¬£300,000. The company had also sold far fewer shares than had been hoped. Frederick Kemp was collecting rents and rates from tenants, and Hesketh-Fleetwood repeatedly asked him for money to pay some of the mounting bills. Kemp, a more forceful character than his employer, kept claiming that there was no money. Hesketh-Fleetwood turned to his brother Charles and asked him to get ¬£4,000 out of Kemp. Charles was more assertive, but Kemp said that the money had been spent on workers' wages and produced yet more invoices that needed to be paid. During Hesketh-Fleetwood's many absences from the Fylde, Kemp managed to involve himself in a number of enterprises in the town, to his own financial advantage. The railway was taking longer than expected and, with mounting debts, Hesketh-Fleetwood grew increasingly depressed and began to withdraw from society. Construction of the railway was finally completed in 1840, and in July the Preston and Wyre Railway opened. The following year St Peter's Church was finished, and Hesketh-Fleetwood appointed as vicar the Rev. St. Vincent Beechey of Hilgay in Norfolk. Also in 1841, the North Euston was the fourth hotel to open in the town. Steamer services opened to the Isle of Man, Whitehaven, Ardrossan and Belfast. Fleetwood initially flourished, but Hesketh-Fleetwood had run out of money and was compelled to take out mortgages. He lost the ¬£75,000 he had invested in the Preston and Wyre Railway Company owing to a lack of accounts. Kemp claimed that Hesketh-Fleetwood owed him money, but Kemp refused to explain his book-keeping. In the face of enormous debts Hesketh-Fleetwood sold his estates at Blackpool, Southport, Meols Hall, and Tulketh Hall. Charles bought the Churchtown estate, where he and his wife had been living, from his brother. In 1844 Hesketh-Fleetwood auctioned off his personal possessions from Rossall Hall and left Lancashire. The Rev. St. Vincent Beechey had set up the Northern Church of England School for boys. Close to bankruptcy, Hesketh- Fleetwood leased the buildings at Rossall Hall to the school for six years, with the option to buy it after nine for ¬£7,000. Thereafter, the school was called Rossall School. Fleetwood continued to grow without its principal investor, albeit slowly. As a port, it soon faced competition from Lytham and Preston. In 1847 Queen Victoria and Prince Albert travelled through Fleetwood on their way to London from Scotland, but that year saw the decline of the town's importance on the route to Scotland. More powerful locomotives were now able to travel over hilly terrain, and the railway was extended over Shap Fell all the way to Scotland; Fleetwood was no longer needed as a sea link. Later life and death Grave, Kensal Green Cemetery Hesketh-Fleetwood moved to London with Virginie and their son Louis. He rarely visited Lancashire again, and in 1847 he retired from politics. The family spent some time living in Virginie's home country, Spain. In 1861 Hesketh-Fleetwood expressed an intention to return to politics, but was prevented from doing so by his failing health. He died at his home in Piccadilly, London on 12 April 1866, following a lengthy illness. He is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery. His son Rev. Peter Louis Hesketh-Fleetwood (1838‚Äì1880) succeeded to the baronetcy, which became extinct on his death. What was left of Hesketh-Fleetwood's land in Lancashire was bought by the Fleetwood Estate Company in 1875.

The Sea-Dweller's integrated helium escape valve. The Rolex Oyster Perpetual Date Sea-Dweller is a line of diver's watches manufactured by Rolex, with an underwater diving depth rating of 1,220 meters (4 000 ft) and up to 3,900 metres (12,800 ft) for the Sea- Dweller Deepsea model. Launched in 1967 with a diving depth of 610 metres (2 000 ft), the Sea-Dweller features a gas escape valve, developed by the brand specifically for watches, which allows the helium trapped in the watch while decompessing to be released at a given pressure during decompression, while preserving the watch case's water resistance. Today's Sea-Dweller models are available in steel or steel and yellow gold, and have a 43 mm case. The Deepsea model comes in a 44 mm case in steel and is equipped with the brand's patented Ringlock system, which was designed to provide a higher degree of pressure resistance. History During the 1960s, the needs of professional divers working at great depths led to the development of the first 'ultra water resistant' tool watches designed for conducting safe diving operations at 300 m+ (1,000 ft+) depths. The Rolex Sea-Dweller reference 1665 was developed in the second quarter of 1967 but became available to the public only in 1971. The delay was probably caused by issues with obtaining the patent for the helium escape valve. The first Sea-Dweller models made between April and June 1967 did not feature a helium release valve. In late 1967, an archeological diver named T. Walker Lloyd approached Rolex with the idea for the valve as watches used in saturation diving experienced problems during decompression. Helium atoms inside a pressure chamber can work their way inside a watch. During decompression, the pressure inside the chamber can decrease more rapidly than the pressure inside the watch case. This can, in some cases, cause the watch crystal to pop off. The helium-release valve allows helium to escape from the case during decompression preventing damage to the watch. The original idea for using a one-way valve came from Robert A. Barth, a US Navy diver who pioneered saturation diving during the US Navy Genesis and SEALAB missions led by Dr. George F. Bond. The very first valve prototype was given to Dr. Ralph Werner Brauer, a professor for physiology at Duke University and director of the Wrightsville Marine Biomedical Laboratory of the University of North Carolina Wilmington. Brauer tested the watch during a series of Physalie dives at the Comex Hyperbaric Center in Marseille, FrancePerezcope ‚Äì The Sea-Dweller Chronicles: Genesis Of The Decompressing Watch. In the past, it was wrongly assumed the Sea-Dweller was developed in cooperation with Comex S.A. industrial deep-sea diving but the French company became a partner of Rolex only in late 1971. The first version of the Sea- Dweller was the so-called \\"Single Red\\" with a depth rating of .

Later Sea-Dweller versions made in 1969 had an increased depth rating of and so-called Double Red dials. Most Sea-Dweller watches incorporate a helium escape valve for saturation diving. Early Sea-Dwellers, however, did not always have the valve. Until the 2017 introduction of the reference number 126600, Sea-Dweller's were also distinguished by the absence of the date magnifier (\\"cyclops\\") present on most other Rolex models as it was impossible to attach a cyclops with Ultraviolet (UV) light curing adhesive at the top of a watch crystal exposed to the pressure encountered at its test depth. The Sea-Dweller diving watch range has been standard issue for Comex divers since 1977.

They wore Rolex Sea-Dwellers. In 1992, Comex diver Theo Mavrostomos achieved a record of of seawater (msw) in an onshore hyperbaric chamber. He took 43 days to complete the dive. The watch used during this scientific record dive, where a hydrogen-helium-oxygen (hydreliox) gas mixture was used as breathing gas, was a Rolex Sea-Dweller 16600 with a depth rating. Rolex used this achievement in advertising campaigns.Comex S.A. HYDRA 8 and HYDRA 10 test projects DEEP-DIVING- EXPERIMENTSCOMEX Watches by Guill@ume and Delgado Technology: Dry run for deepest diveAdvertisements referring to Comex divers using Rolex watches The complexity, medical problems and physiological limits, such as those imposed by high pressure nervous syndrome, the accompanying high costs of professional saturation diving to extreme depths and the development of deep water atmospheric diving suits and remotely operated underwater vehicles in offshore oilfield drilling and production effectively ended the need for ever deeper, non-atmospheric manned intervention in the ocean. These practical factors make watch depth ratings of more than marketing curiosities.

Reign An illegitimate son of Alexander IV of Imereti, George was declared, with the approval of the Ottoman government, a rightful king of Imereti by the loyal party of nobles in 1702, though it was not until 1707 that he was able to wrest the crown from the usurper Giorgi-Malakia Abashidze (George VI). In October 1711, a noble revolt deposed him in favor of Mamia III Gurieli who forced George to retire to Kartli, eastern Georgia. Later, with the support of the Turkish pasha of Akhaltsikhe, he defeated Mamia at the Battle of Chkhara in June 1712. Deposed again in November 1713, George resumed the throne upon Mamia‚Äôs death in January 1714, only to be forced, in 1716, by the rebellious nobles led by Prince Bejan Dadiani into exile to Constantinople. George succeeded in garnering the Ottoman support, and regained the crown in 1719. Yet, his reign proved to be short-lived; in February 1720, he was assassinated by the plotters led by Prince Simon Abashidze. Family George VII was married four times. His first wife was Rodam, daughter of George XI of Kartli whom he married in 1703 and divorced in 1712. George then married his second wife, Tamar, a daughter of Giorgi-Malakia Abashidze, ex-wife of Prince Giorgi Nizharadze, and repudiated the union in 1713 (she would marry her third husband Prince Merab Tsulukidze in 1714).

It is located in the Sapna valley in the district of Dohuk and the historical region of Barwari. In the village, there is a church of Mar Gewargis and shrine of Mart Shmuni. The Nestorian Monastery of Mar Abraham of Shamrah was located near the village, and was abandoned in the 14th century. History A Nestorian Assyrian community at Mangesh is attested in the 10th- century Life of Rabban Joseph Busnaya. The village was plundered by Kurds in 1712. A significant proportion of the population of Mangesh was converted to Chaldean Catholicism by Mattai Shem øon, Chaldean Catholic Archbishop of Amadiya, in 1791, and 13 villagers subsequently entered the Rabban Hormizd Monastery between 1808 and 1827. However, a Nestorian community may have persisted into the early 19th century. In 1850, 150 Chaldean Catholic families inhabited Mangesh, and were served by three priests and one functioning church as part of the diocese of Amadiya. The number of Chaldean Catholics in the village had grown to 1100 by 1913, with four priests and one church. There were 230 households in 1920. Mangesh was inhabited by 1195 people in 1947. At the onset of the First Iraqi‚ÄìKurdish War in 1961, there were 600 families, but attacks by Barzani Kurds forced many to flee, and the population decreased to 959 people by 1965. The village recovered, and around the time of the war's end in 1970, 1390 people inhabited Mangesh. In 1989, Kurdish families were forcibly resettled in Mangesh by the Iraqi government, until which point the village was solely inhabited by Assyrians who spoke Chaldean Neo-Aramaic. As a consequence of the Iraqi Al-Anfal campaign in the late 1980s, agricultural lands in the sub-district were abandoned. On 13 December 1997, seven unarmed Assyrian civilians from Mangesh were ambushed by Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK) militants, and six were killed in the attack. On 21 December, the National Liberation Front of Kurdistan denied the PKK was responsible for the deaths, and instead claimed the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) had orchestrated the attack; the sole survivor of the attack died of her wounds on 26 December. In the period from 1950 to 1997, over forty people from the village were assassinated. Agricultural lands in the sub-district abandoned during the Al-Anfal campaign were re-cultivated between 1998 and 2002. The Supreme Committee of Christian Affairs constructed 180 houses, restored the church, and provided infrastructure for the village in the 2000s. The Assyrian General Conference reported its representatives were threatened by armed KDP members at Mangesh in December 2005. In September 2013, Assyrians of Mangesh reported that they suffered from persecution and intimidation from the Kurdistan Regional Government, and were coerced into supporting the KDP. Mangesh became a place of refuge for 77 Syriac Orthodox families from the vicinity of Alqosh who had fled the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant offensive on 6 August 2014. Prior to the arrival of the refugees, the village was inhabited by roughly 300 Assyrian families. By September, Assyrian refugees from Bakhdida and Yazidis had also fled to Mangesh, and the school was converted into a temporary shelter.

He was installed as regent of Guria by his father, Mamia III Gurieli, then the king of Imereti, in 1712. In 1716, he seized the crown of Imereti, but was forced to abandon the enterprise later that year. Returning to Guria, his rule was challenged by a faction of local nobility, which included his mother Elene and brother Kaikhosro III Gurieli. He was finally able to crush the opposition after making peace with Bezhan Dadiani, Prince of Mingrelia.  Early rule  Giorgi was the eldest son of Mamia III Gurieli, Prince of Guria, and Elene, daughter of Prince Giorgi Abashidze. When Mamia seized the throne of Imereti in October 1712, Giorgi was made by his father as regent of Guria to the opposition of his younger brother, Levan. On Mamia's death on 5 January 1714, Giorgi Gurieli became prince-regnant. In 1716, the Imeretian opposition led by Bezhan Dadiani, Prince of Mingrelia, and Prince Zurab Abashidze invited the Ottoman troops in their successful bid to depose King Giorgi VII of Imereti, the late Mamia Gurieli's rival, and crowned Giorgi Gurieli as king at Kutaisi. His reign lasted for only three months; the dethroned king Giorgi VII's Rachian supporters ambushed and looted Gurieli's treasure, bound to Kutaisi, at Salominao, while a Gurian escort were captured and sold in slavery. The alarmed Gurieli fled Kutaisi back to Guria, while Imereti was divided by Dadiani, Abashidze, and the duke of Racha.  Coup in Guria  Back in his native principality, Giorgi Gurieli faced a coup engineered by his own mother, Elene, on whose instigation Dadiani, Abashidze, and the duke of Racha intervened with their troops to expel Giorgi and replace him with his younger brother, Kaikhosro III Gurieli, the unfrocked monk and Elene's favorite son. Giorgi fled to Akhlatsikhe under the protection of an Ottoman pasha. There he met his exiled predecessor as king of Imereti, Giorgi VII, who married Gurieli's sister Tamar. Akhaltsikhe's own power struggle deprived the two Giorgis of any meaningful support. Gurieli moved to Erzurum and, with the troops provided by the local pasha, quickly reconquered Guria, forcing his mother and brothers into exile. The leading nobles of Guria, such as Eristavi and Bezhan Nakashidze did not welcome Giorgi's comeback and invoked Bezhan Dadiani's military aid to put Gurieli into flight to Batumi. Dadiani looted Guria and left. Gurieli was able to resume his reign and made peace with Dadiani. He then moved against his estranged nobles, expelled Eristavi, and took away Giorgi Nakashidze's wife, a daughter of Dadiani, as his own mate with her father's consent. Giorgi Gurieli died in 1726. He was succeeded by his son, Mamia IV Gurieli.  Family  Giorgi Gurieli was married twice, first to Elene (Mariam), daughter of Prince Abashidze or, according to Cyril Toumanoff, of Giorgi Shervashidze, Eristavi of Guria. After the couple's divorce in 1717, Giorgi married Khvaramze, daughter of Bezhan Dadiani and former wife of Prince Giorgi Nakashidze. After Gurieli's death, Khvaramze married Shoshita III, Duke of Racha.

She is best known for her contributions to the Ar tonelico, Shadow Hearts and Umineko no Naku Koro ni games, as well as anime adaptations of Umineko no Naku Koro ni, Akatsuki no Yona and Tales of Symphonia. Shikata's music is known for its ethnic feel and complex vocal chorus work. In a single Shikata song, there may be as many as 200 separate vocal tracks recorded for it. Biography Shikata was born in Tokyo. She first developed an interest in music when she was very little, after constantly singing with her mother. She was first interested in songs from Minna no Uta, and later when she learnt the piano classical music. In 2001, she formed the independent label Vagrancy, associated with the d≈çjin music scene that makes independent music game releases. She originally had no intention of singing, but felt dissatisfied with creating songs just from synthesiser sounds. Later in the year, she released her debut EP, Midori no Mori de Nemuru Tori, through her site. In the next few years, she released many works through her site, mostly instrumental albums performed with a music box. Her first full-length album Haikyo to Rakuen (2003) topped the charts at Japanese independent music download site Muzie for 24 months. In the same year, she worked on the soundtrack for the independent game \\"Hanakis≈ç,\\" her first major game-related work. In 2004, she held her first ever live tour. In 2005, she debuted as a major label artist under the Hats Unlimited label run by violinist Taro Hakase. Her association with the label led to Shikata working on many game soundtracks, such as Shadow Hearts: From the New World and Ar tonelico: Melody of Elemia. Shikata continues to work with the Ar tonelico franchise today, releasing music for both the second and third games. Her second major-label album, Raka, was released in 2006. It featured several songs from games (two songs used in Hanakis≈ç, as well as a rearrangement of the opening theme song from Ar tonelico, ). It was her first top 40 album, ranking at #34 on the Oricon albums chart. (subscription only) In 2007, Shikata became associated with the d≈çjin soft game Umineko no Naku Koro ni, releasing an EP featuring music from the game (including the eponymous theme song). This was her first top 30 release. In 2009, her third album Harmonia broke the top 20. In 2009, Shikata made her first moves into singing for anime, with her first single \\"Katayoku no Tori\\" being used as the opening theme song for the anime adaptation of Umineko no Naku Koro ni. In 2010, her second single, \\"Inori no Kanata\\", was used as the ending theme song for Tales of Symphonia (Tethe'alla Version). In 2014, she composed the soundtrack for the anime television series Cross Ange.

Movement was first postulated by structuralist linguists who expressed it in terms of discontinuous constituents or displacement.Concerning the terminology of movement, see Graffi (2001). Certain constituents appear to have been displaced from the position where they receive important features of interpretation. Concerning the interpretation of features as the motivation for movement, see Carnie (2013:393ff.). The concept of movement is controversial; it is associated with so-called transformational or derivational theories of syntax (e.g. transformational grammar, government and binding theory, minimalist program). Representational theories (e.g. head- driven phrase structure grammar, lexical functional grammar, construction grammar, and most dependency grammars), in contrast, reject the notion of movement, often addressing discontinuities in terms of feature passing or persistent structural identities In their seminal (and eponymous) exposition of HPSG (1992), Pollard and Sag especially emphasize how graph reentrancies‚Äîor \\"coreferencing\\"‚Äîin the typed feature structures of (e.g.) unification-based grammars are fully sufficient with regard to replacing the role of movement/trace mechanisms. instead. Examples Movement is the traditional \\"transformational\\" means of overcoming the discontinuities associated with wh- fronting, topicalization, extraposition, scrambling, inversion, and shifting, e.g. See for instance Roberts (1997:35f.) and Haegeman and Gu√©ron (1999:32) for an introduction to the concept of movement. ::a. John has told Peter that Mary likes the first story. ::b. Which story has John told Peter that Mary likes _? \\\\- Wh-fronting ::a. We want to hear that one story again. ::b. That one story we want to hear _ again. \\\\- Topicalization ::a. Something that we weren't expecting occurred. ::b. Something _ occurred that we weren't expecting. \\\\- Extraposition ::a. You will understand. ::b. Will you _ understand? \\\\- Inversion ::a. She took off her hat. ::b. She took her hat off _. \\\\- Shifting The a-sentences show canonical word order, and the b-sentences illustrate the result of movement. Bold script marks the expression that is moved, and the blanks mark the positions out of which movement is assumed to have occurred. Each time, movement takes place in order to focus or emphasize the expression in bold. For instance, the constituent which story in the first b-sentence is the object of the transitive verb likes, the canonical position of an object being immediately to the right of the verb. By fronting the object as a wh-expression, it becomes the focus of communication. The representation of movement The examples above use a blank to mark the position out of which movement is assumed to have occurred. Blanks are just one means of indicating movement, however. Two other means are traces and copies. In transformational grammar, movement has been signaled by a trace t since at least the 1970s proposal by Noam Chomsky, See Chomsky (1975) for an early example of the use of traces to mark movement. e.g. ::b. Which story1 has John told Peter that Mary likes t1? \\\\- Movement indicated using a trace Subscripts help indicate the constituent that is assumed to have left a trace in its former position, the position marked by t.For examples of t used in this manner, see for instance Ouhalla (1994:63) and Haegeman and Gu√©ron (1999:172). The other means of indicating movement is in terms of copies. Movement is actually taken to be a process of copying the same constituent in different positions, deleting the phonological features in all but one case.See Chomsky (1995) concerning the copy theory of movement. Italics are used in the following example to indicate a copy that lacks phonological representation: ::b. Which story has John told Peter that Mary likes which story? \\\\- Copy indicated using italics While there are various nuances associated with each of these means of indicating movement (blanks, traces, copies), for the most part, each convention has the same goal, which is to indicate the presence of a discontinuity. Types of movement Within generative grammar, various types of movement have been discerned. Two important distinctions are A-movement vs. A-bar movement and phrasal vs. head movement. =A-movement vs. A-bar movement= Argument movement (A-movement) displaces a phrase into a position where a fixed grammatical function is assigned, such as in movement of the object to the subject position in passives:See for instance Ouhalla (1994:161f.) and Radford (2004:176ff.) concerning the distinction between A- and A-bar positions. ::a. Fred read the book. ::b. The book was read _ (by Fred). \\\\- A-movement Non-argument movement (A-bar movement or A'-movement), in contrast, displaces a phrase into a position where a fixed grammatical function is not assigned, such as movement of a subject or object NP to a pre-verbal position in interrogatives: ::a. You think Fred loves Mary. ::b. Who do you think _ loves Mary? \\\\- A-bar movement ::a. You think Fred loves Mary. ::b. Who do you think Fred loves _? \\\\- A-bar movement The A- vs. A-bar distinction is a reference to the theoretical status of syntax with respect to the lexicon. The distinction elevates the role of syntax, locating the theory of voice (active vs. passive) almost entirely in syntax (as opposed to in the lexicon). A theory of syntax that locates the active-passive distinction in the lexicon ‚Äì i.e. the passive is not derived via transformations from the active ‚Äì will reject the distinction entirely. =Phrasal movement vs. head movement= A different partition among types of movement is phrasal vs. head movement. Concerning head movement, see for instance Ouhalla (1994:284f.), Radford (2004:123ff.) and Carnie (2013:289ff.). Phrasal movement occurs when the head of a phrase moves together with all its dependents in such a manner that the entire phrase moves. Most of the examples above involve phrasal movement. Head movement, in contrast, occurs when just the head of a phrase moves, whereby this head leaves behind its dependents. Subject-auxiliary inversion is a canonical instance of head movement, e.g. ::a. Someone has read the article. ::b. Has someone _ read the article? \\\\- Head movement of the auxiliary verb has ::a. She will read the second article. ::b. Will she _ read the second article? \\\\- Head movement of the auxiliary verb will On the assumption that the auxiliaries has and will are the heads of phrases ‚Äì of IPs (inflection phrases), for instance ‚Äì the b-sentences are the result of head movement, whereby the auxiliary verbs has and will move leftward without taking with them the rest of the phrase that they head. The distinction between phrasal movement and head movement relies crucially on the assumption that movement is occurring leftward. An analysis of subject-auxiliary inversion that acknowledges rightward movement can dispense with head movement entirely, e.g. ::a. Someone has read the article. ::b. _ Has someone read the article? \\\\- Phrasal movement of the subject pronoun someone ::a. She will read the second article. ::b. _ Will she read the second article? \\\\- Phrasal movement of the subject pronoun she The analysis shown in these sentences sees the subject pronouns someone and she moving rightward (instead of the auxiliary verbs moving leftward). Since these pronouns lack dependents, i.e. they alone qualify as complete phrases, there would be no reason to assume head movement. Islands and barriers to movement Since it was first proposed, the theory of syntactic movement yielded a new field of research aiming at providing the filters that block certain types of movement, also called locality theory.See Manzini (1992) for illustrations of different types of locality theories. Locality theory is interested in discerning the islands and barriers to movement. It strives to identify the categories and constellations that block movement from occurring. In other words, one wants to understand why certain attempts at movement fail, e.g. ::a. You think that Mary visited Peter before calling Fred. ::b. *Who do you think that Mary visited Peter before calling _? ‚Äì Attempt fails to move Fred/who out of the adjunct before calling Fred. ::a. Your picture of Fred was funny. ::b. *Who was your picture of _ funny? \\\\- Attempt fails to move Fred/who out of the subject NP your picture of Fred; note that \\"Who was your funny picture of?\\" or, more formally but less idiomatically, \\"Of whom was your funny picture?\\" are acceptable. ::a. You like Bill's ideas. ::b. *Whose do you like _ ideas? \\\\- Attempt fails to move Bill's/whose out of the object NP Bill's ideas (but \\"Whose ideas do you like?\\" is acceptable). The b-sentences are now all disallowed due to locality constraints on movement. Adjuncts and subjects are islands that block movement, and left branches in NPs are barriers that prevent pre-noun modifiers from being extracted out of NPs. Feature passing Syntactic movement is controversial, especially in light of movement paradoxes. Theories of syntax that posit feature passing reject syntactic movement outright, that is, they reject the notion that a given \\"moved\\" constituent ever appears in its \\"base\\" position below the surface, i.e. the positions marked by blanks, traces, or copies. Instead, they assume that there is but one level of syntax, whereby all constituents only ever appear in their surface positions ‚Äì there is no underlying level or derivation. To address discontinuities, they posit that the features of a displaced constituent are passed up and/or down the syntactic hierarchy between that constituent and its governor.The classic article that rejects movement, and presents and defends an approach to discontinuities in terms of feature passing (the slash feature) is Gazdar (1981). The following tree illustrates the feature passing analysis of a wh- discontinuity in a dependency grammar.The dependency tree produced here to illustrate the concept of feature passing is consistent with the DG analysis of discontinuities in Gro√ü and Osborne (2009). ::Feature passing 1 The words in red mark the catena (chain of words) that connects the displaced wh- constituent what to its governor eat, the word that licenses its appearance.The catena unit is presented and discussed at length in Osborne et al. (2012). The assumption is that features (=information) associated with what (e.g. noun, direct object) are passed up and down along the catena marked in red. In this manner, the ability of eat to subcategorize for a direct object NP is acknowledged. By examining the nature of catenae like the one in red here, the locality constraints on discontinuities can be identified. Traces =The existence of traces= As mentioned above, movement analyses of discontinuities often posit the existence traces. A trace is what is left behind in a position in which the moved constituent appeared at some deep level of syntax or some point in the derivation before surface syntax. Hence instead of the blank used above to mark the base position of a constituent that is moved, a t (t = trace) is used, e.g. :a. You like eating porridge. :b. What do you like eating t. Traces are considered primarily in Chomskian transformational grammar and its various developments. They are distinguished from other empty syntactic categories, commonly denoted PRO and pro. More details and examples can be found in the article on empty categories. =Wanna contraction= A well-known argument that traces are real comes from wanna contraction.For a discussion of wanna contraction as a source of support for the existence of traces, see for example Radford (1997: 269ff.) Syntactic Theory and the Structure of English: A Minimalist Approach, CUP 1997, p. 269ff. The contraction of want to into wanna is possible in some contexts, but not in others: ::a. Who does Vicky want to vote for t? ‚Üí Who does Vicky wanna vote for? ::b. Who does Vicky want t to win? ‚Üí *Who does Vicky wanna win? One way to explain this contrast is to assume that the trace left behind by the extraction of who in the second example blocks the contraction of want and to. Without the trace, this explanation would not be available. The validity of this argument based on wanna contraction and similar arguments has been called into question by linguists favoring non-transformational approaches.Sag and Fodor (1994) argue at length against the observations that have been put forward in favor of traces. Consider, for instance, that other types of contraction are possible despite the putative presence of a trace, e.g. The examples are taken from Sag and Fodor (1994) ::a. Who does Kim think t is beneath contempt? ‚Üí Who does Kim think's beneath contempt? ::b. Who does Kim think t will be late? ‚Üí Who does Kim think'll be late? ::c. What does Kim imagine t has been happening? ‚Üí What does Kim imagine's been happening? In these cases, contraction of the wh-word and auxiliary verb is easily possible despite the putative presence of the trace. What these examples suggest is that wanna is not transformationally derived through contraction, but rather it is a lexical item in its own right that subcategorizes for a bare infinitive. It is, then, similar to other apparent contractions such as aren't and isn't, which upon scrutiny cannot be transformationally derived, but rather must also lexical items in their own right.

The school receives feeder students from Ripley Middle School.  History  In the summer of 1913, Ripley High School was established, and in the following school year, 23 students were enrolled. In order to uphold its legal right to exist as an educational institution, it had to combine with the grade school in the following year due to an extremely low number of students. In 1917, better efforts were made to build the school, and additional rooms were made accordingly. In 1918, however, the infamous Spanish flu pandemic swept across America, and health authorities suspended the school, locking the doors until January 1, 1919. In the autumn of the same year, the school succeeded in voting for the construction of a new building, but it wasn't finished until 1922. Classes continued in that building for almost twenty- eight years until the present building was constructed in 1950, and it has steadily increased since then with additional buildings. In 2002, the Main Building of the school received a multimillion-dollar facelift.

She has been portrayed by Katherine Kelly Lang since the series's debut in March 1987. The character is part of the original four central characters and actors (including her onscreen double-decade long love and husband, Ridge Forrester, and his parents Stephanie and Eric). Over the years, she has developed into a business woman working at Forrester Creations and a mother to five children: Rick, Bridget, Hope, R.J., and Jack. Her character is described as having \\"emerged as the show's quintessential heroine, always in turmoil and forever symbolic of true love and destiny prevailing.\\" The character has also had long-time rivalries with Stephanie Forrester and Dr. Taylor Hayes. In addition to Ridge (whom she married eight times), Brooke has had relationships with Ridge's stepfather, Eric Forrester, Ridge's two half-brothers, Thorne Forrester and Nick Marone, her son-in-law Deacon Sharpe, her brother-in-law Bill Spencer, Jr., and several others, including marriages to Whip Jones and Grant Chambers. Character creation and casting Katherine Kelly Lang debuted as the character in 1987, and continues to portray the role today. In 1987, she was briefly replaced by Catherine Hickland while Lang was on sick leave; in 1997, Sandra Ferguson filled in for a small amount of time during Lang's maternity leave. In 2012, Lang announced that she had signed a two-year contract with the series, ensuring her stay until 2014. Character development Lang, who is known for her ready smile and engaging manner, has confessed to sometimes calling Ronn Moss (Ridge) his onscreen name, Ridge; \\"Sometimes I just call him Ridge out of habit\\" she has confessed to the Sydney Morning Herald. Lang said of the ongoing plots and twists in the relationship: \\"Ridge and Brooke will always be connected [but] the heart of the drama is what happens when true love is thwarted.\\". During an interview with Who! On January 29, 2008, actress Katherine Kelly Lang was asked \\"What do you like about your character Brooke Logan?\\", Lang stated \\"I like that she doesn't give up, no matter how depressed she may be or the bad things that she may be going through, she always bounces back\\", highlighting the continuing resilience within the character. She also said \\"I think she has a real grasp of things, even though she still doesn't have her love life under control but, hopefully, that will come together too,\\" and at the end of the way she wants her character to be \\"Happy\\". In mid-2010, Taylor's (Brooke Forrester's nemesis) daughter Steffy Forrester began going after Hope Logan (Brooke's now teen daughter)'s boyfriends. This re-ignited both Taylor and Brooke's rivalry and began a new generation rivalry. Bradley Bell stated on this: \\"is exciting to see Brooke and Taylor in the more maternal roles. Brooke has a daughter -- miraculously -- who is sweet and a virgin. She is just a darling; and Taylor has a daughter who is trouble. She knows how to manipulate men and she is very sexual [Like Brooke]\\". Of the character's \\"accidental\\" infidelity with her daughter's (Hope) boyfriend Oliver Jones, Lang stated: \\"She was excited and high on her hormones\\" during an interview with Michael Fairman. Hope began to become more like her mother when she became more sexual in her relationship with Liam's half-brother, Wyatt Spencer. And the fact that she was dating two half brothers, Liam and Wyatt, at the same time, just as Brooke did with Nick Marone and Ridge Forrester. Ivy Forrester kept stating Hope is a lot like Brooke and so did Stephanie. Storylines =Backstory= Brooke is the eldest of the Logan sisters. She studied chemistry during her early days in college. Brooke is the daughter of Beth and Stephen Logan, the elder sister of Donna Logan (Jennifer Gareis) and Katie Logan (Heather Tom), and the younger sister of Storm Logan (played by William deVry at the time of the character's death in 2008). She worked for her family's catering business who often served rich pillars of the community (including the Forrester family). =1987‚Äìpresent= Brooke and Ridge met when she asked her mother to help cater a Forrester party so she could meet Ridge. She fell instantly in love with the handsome playboy Ridge, who was engaged to be married to Caroline Spencer. After finding out that Ridge had spent the night with Alex, Caroline collapsed at the wedding and broke it off with Ridge. Caroline was raped shortly after that, and Brooke shortly befriended her after visiting her at the hospital. Brooke was so smitten with Ridge that she broke off her engagement to David, a police officer, because even her brother knew she would never be happy on a cop's pay. Hiding a letter Ridge wrote to Caroline spilling his heart to her and telling her he loved her, Brooke conspired with Thorne to keep Ridge and Caroline apart. Caroline became engaged to Thorne and Brooke and Ridge fell in love with each other, with Brooke becoming pregnant. Ridge and Caroline hid their true feelings for each other. Once Brooke lost the baby in a tragic miscarriage, Ridge broke off the relationship with her and began one with Caroline again. Caroline broke it off with Thorne after admitting she was still in love with Ridge, and they quickly married. A devastated Brooke turned to Eric for comfort and ended up pregnant, so Eric married her. After the death of Caroline Ridge met and fell in love with Taylor Hayes, the doctor who cared for Caroline. Despite this, Ridge was still involved with and loved both women, Brooke and Taylor, while Taylor herself was also involved with Brooke's brother Storm. Brooke created the wrinkle-free formula BeLieF for design house Forrester Creations and celebrated with Ridge by making love on the lab floor. Brooke and Ridge were intimate again when they believed that Eric wanted Stephanie back thanks to a forged letter from Stephanie. In the end however, Ridge chose Taylor as he did not want to be the cause of the end of Brooke and his father's marriage, and hoped if he chose Taylor, Brooke would stay with Eric. On the wedding day of Ridge and Taylor, Brooke ran to find them thinking she was pregnant with her and Ridge's child, when in fact she was pregnant with her and Eric's second child, Bridget. A paternity test was later conducted, with Sheila Carter tampering with the results and having everyone believe Ridge was the father; it would be years later before the truth about Bridget's true parentage was revealed. When Ridge wouldn't leave Taylor, Brooke dated attorney Connor Davis, who informed Brooke she had a legal right to the BeLieF patent. Furious when Ridge tried to sweet-talk her out of her rights, Brooke obtained 51% of Forrester Creations and appointed herself CEO, even slapping Stephanie, who struck Brooke first. Brooke created a men's line, putting Ridge at the helm; Brooke fell into the pool and knocked herself unconscious when Ridge playfully shoved her. After Taylor was presumed dead in a plane crash, Brooke became engaged to psychiatrist James Warwick, but accepted Ridge's proposal instead. Brooke finally married Ridge in a lavish beach ceremony, then honeymooned with him in Morocco, where they were guests of Prince Omar Rashid. Once home, Brooke cared for Ridge when he was blinded in a lab accident and was horrified to learn that the hospital volunteer treating Ridge was actually Taylor, who had been saved by Omar but held prisoner in his palace. Brooke tried to keep Taylor's existence from Ridge, but when the truth came out, Brooke learned her marriage to Ridge was invalid. Brooke heaved a sigh of relief when Ridge asked Taylor for a divorce, clearing the way for Brooke to remarry Ridge. Brooke later had a short marriage to a man named Grant Chambers in 1997; after giving him a friendly kiss, causing Ridge to propose to Taylor at a fashion show, Brooke rebelled by marrying Grant. However, their marriage was never legal due to a fraudulent sea captain who performed the ceremony. In 1998, Taylor became pregnant with her and Ridge's child; however, she told everyone the baby belonged to Thorne after seeing Ridge in bed with Brooke. In reality, a drunken Ridge had fallen into bed with Brooke while visiting her at her home, though he end things with Brooke before they could fully make love. Brooke later became interested in Thorne and overcame obstacles with him and his then wife, Macy. Macy was killed in a car accident, which Brooke survived. Thorne and Brooke parted ways, and she turned her attention back to Ridge, who was still married to Taylor. Brooke was later tricked by the Forrester family into traveling to Paris to keep away from the happily married Taylor and Ridge (who had since had twins, Steffy and Phoebe). After she came back, Brooke had an affair with her daughter Bridget's husband, Deacon Sharpe. Bridget was disgusted by this, and later Brooke gave birth to a daughter named Hope Logan as a result of the scandalous affair. Briefly during the pregnancy, she married a Forrester co- worker Whip Jones to cover up her adulterous affair. When Taylor was murdered by Sheila Carter, Ridge and Brooke found their way back to one another. Sheila returned and later held Ridge, Brooke and the Sailor who arrived in L.A., Nick Marone hostage for ransom. Ridge was briefly presumed dead after falling into a fire pit, and Brooke slept with Nick while mourning. Ridge returned and Brooke later fell pregnant and gave birth to R.J. (Ridge Junior) Forrester. The baby was initially thought to be her and Nick's child, but later proved to be her and Ridge's. When Taylor returned from the dead In 2005, Stephanie Forrester faked a heart attack and asked for her dying wish to be Ridge and Taylor's reunion. Brooke moved out of Ridge's life, and began a relationship with Nick in 2006. She faced complications as Nick was also in an on-again, off-again relationship with her daughter Bridget. She and Nick divorced for the sake of Bridget's ill- fated pregnancy (the baby was stillborn). In 2007, Brooke tried to interfere with Ridge's relationship with Ashley Abbott. She left town after being practically pushed out by Stephanie, who had supported Ashley and Ridge's relationship. Brooke started to go after Nick again. When Taylor and Nick (together now) decided to have a baby, they needed an egg donor. After baby Jack was born, it was revealed that Brooke was the biological mother of the baby and the eggs were hers through a mix up. Taylor had an emotional breakdown and recovered, and decided to share Jack with Brooke so that the child could have a biological connection. In 2009, Taylor and Brooke began to fight for Ridge's affections once again after Taylor's relationship with Brooke's much younger son Rick. Taylor and Ridge married; however, he returned to Brooke shortly after. In 2010, Brooke repeated history, as she had once done with Deacon and Bridget, when she accidentally had sex with Hope's then-boyfriend, Oliver Jones, and like Bridget, Hope forgave her. In 2011, Brooke and Thomas, while on a business trip to promote Thomas Forrester' Taboo men's line at Forrester Creations, ended up stranded on an island. While stranded, Brooke and Thomas ingested poisonous berries as a means of survival. The berries planted the idea that Brooke and Thomas had slept together. When they returned home safely, Stephanie teamed up with Thomas together to come up with the lie that he and Brooke had sex on the island, in order to break up her marriage with Ridge. This allowed Ridge and Taylor to nearly remarry, until Stephanie revealed the truth, allowing Ridge to reunite with Brooke. Ridge proposes to Brooke in Italy. Stephanie offers to organise the wedding at her house; it was a simple ceremony with only family as guests. Ridge and Brooke leave for their honeymoon after the speeches have taken place. While on their honeymoon, Brooke is in touch with Deacon via text, and Ridge finds out, but when he asks Brooke about it, she denies it. Ridge tells Brooke he can no longer take the lies and tells her he will not be returning home with her. Brooke arrives home without Ridge to deal with Katie. When Katie, who is suffering from post-partum depression, walks out on the marriage, Brooke and Bill, Katie's husband, grow closer and share a kiss. When Katie's back, she forgives the two. Brooke and Bill collaborated to re-launch the Brooke's Bedroom line at Forrester Creations. Brooke and Bill spend time together and Brooke tries to help Bill with the distance in his marriage to Katie. Katie is upset at their growing closeness despite their reassurances that nothing was going on. Eventually Brooke and Bill begin an affair, but after sleeping together they decide to break things off for Katie's sake. After suffering worrying symptoms, such as a fever and not sleeping well, Brooke decides to visit her doctor. The doctor says that its menopause and that they will have to run tests. When Brooke gets the test results back, she is shocked to discover that she is pregnant with her and Bill's baby. Hurt and deeply upset, she turns to Eric, who's in a relationship with Taylor, and asks him to say the baby is his. In this way she hopes to keep her indiscretion from Katie and hide her pregnancy from Bill. Eric refuses and urges her to come clean to both Katie and Bill. Taylor who has suspected that Brooke and Bill were having an affair finds out about the pregnancy. At a surprise birthday party for Brooke, Taylor tells the guests including Katie about the affair. By that time, Brooke's body had mysteriously \\"absorbed\\" the pregnancy according to her doctor and she was hoping it would never come out. In 2013, Katie goes missing shortly after giving birth to Will, and suffering from post-partum depression. Bill tracks Katie down in Aspen, Colorado, and Brooke helps him search for Katie. Brooke and Bill begin to act on their feelings for each other, hiding it from Katie, until Taylor found out. At a party for Brooke‚Äôs birthday, Taylor exposes Brooke and Bill‚Äôs affair in front of the Forrester, Logan and Spencer families, resulting in Katie screaming at Bill and Brooke. Brooke later criticised Katie when she decided to use her divorce with Bill to gain control of Spencer publications. Brooke reconnected with Bill in Monte Carlo, then traveled with him to Aspen, where he nearly fell from a cliff. As a result, Bill re-evaluated his recent decisions, and later returned to Katie. However, this did not last as Katie discovered that Bill was only trying to regain control of his company. Ridge returned to LA (now played by Thorsten Kaye), and the two reunite and almost remarry. However, Katie fainted at their wedding, and later revealed that she did it in order to stop the wedding due to her developing feelings for Ridge. Katie and Ridge have a brief relationship, and Brooke becomes jealous when Ridge proposes to Katie, giving her a red string instead of an engagement ring. Brooke helps Bill regain control of Spencer Publications, and the two go to the UAE to marry. However, Ridge arrives in time to stop the wedding with a picture of Bill in bed with Quinn Fuller. Bill exacted revenge on Ridge by having Justin throw him out of a helicopter. After disappearing briefly, Ridge returns with an impaired memory and had lost his design ability. Brooke was later furious when Ridge began having an affair with Caroline Spencer, Rick‚Äôs then-wife. Brooke then finds herself caught between two men ‚Äì Bill and Deacon, who had recently returned to LA to be a part of Hope‚Äôs life. Brooke then leaves LA for three months to work in Milan, Italy. Upon returning, she decides that she wants to be with Ridge, but he rejects her to marry Caroline. Brooke then turns to alcohol, and Deacon helps her deal with it by attending AA meetings with her. Brooke‚Äôs alcoholism resulted in her acting strangely at Bill and Katie‚Äôs second wedding, and also began raising suspicions from Quinn, who was then involved with Deacon. Quinn found out about Brooke and Deacon‚Äôs affair, and slapped her to the floor. Brooke then crashed Deacon and Quinn‚Äôs wedding by bringing Hope in via Skype in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the ceremony. Brooke and Ridge became closer after he revealed to her that he had a vasectomy, and that Thomas was the biological father of Caroline‚Äôs baby, Douglas. Katie decided to make amends with Brooke by offering her a job at Spencer Publications, which resulted in Bill and Brooke re-igniting their feelings. Bill and Brooke began to raise suspicions, causing Katie to begin drinking excessively. After Ridge manipulates Eric into kicking Rick, Maya and Nicole out of the Forrester Mansion, Brooke allows them to stay. Brooke began to resurrect her feelings for Bill but did not want to have an affair with him while married to Katie. Katie then found out about Brooke and Bill‚Äôs affair, resulting in a complicated divorce, with Katie receiving $50 000 000 from Bill, and the two sharing custody of Will. Bill promised Brooke his 12.5% stake in Forrester Creations, which Brooke would sell to Ridge in order to help him remove Quinn from the company. However, on the day of Brooke and Bill‚Äôs wedding, on Halloween 2016, Ridge stopped the wedding and won back Brooke after Bill left her at the altar. Ridge then proposed to Brooke at Stephanie‚Äôs grave, and eventually the two found their way back to each other. In March 2017, the Forrester and Spencer families traveled to Sydney, Australia for Liam and Steffy‚Äôs third wedding. Ridge and Brooke decided to get married there as well, until Brooke discovered Quinn and Ridge kissing at a beach. Originally determined to tell Eric, Ridge and Quinn manipulated Brooke into keeping quiet, but broke off her engagement with Ridge. Brooke stayed in Sydney while everyone else returned to LA, and was comforted by Bill. Bill and Brooke finally marry in May 2017, and honeymooned in Paris. Their marriage ends when Bill confess to Brooke about burning Spectra Fashions, and that he punched Liam. Steffy convinces Brooke not to leave Bill, and that he is sorry. Brooke almost goes back to him until Bill almost killed Liam and Sally when Bill torn down the newly repaired Spectra Fashions building for his skyscraper. Ridge then wins Brooke back and marries her in 2018 at the Forrester mansion, with Stephanie's picture hanging on the fireplace. Stephanie's voice talks to Brooke at her wedding and tells her that she is proud of her becoming a better woman. Brooke tells Stephanie that she missed her every day and especially on her wedding day. Brooke's daughter Hope (Annika Noelle) faced a tragedy when her granddaughter Beth, was stillborn and her marriage to Liam Spencer ended. Brooke later learns that her brother Storm has a daughter named Flo Fulton, and that she gave her daughter Phoebe to Steffy to raise. Brooke happily welcomes Flo into the family. When Ridges son Thomas(Matthew Atkinson) returns after Caroline passed away, he starts to pursue Hope and manipulates her into marrying him. Brooke disprove of their relationship because of Thomas's past with Rick and is worry about Hope because she still loves Liam and is still grieving over Beth. However when Ridge tells Brooke that Douglas told Liam, Steffy, and Hope that Beth is alive, Liam would not let it go and believes Douglas. Ridge assures Brooke that Douglas may have been confused, and has not check up on Liam with losing Beth. Also Ridge tells Brooke Liam stormed out of her house when he saw an error on Phoebes birth certificate, and wanted to talk to Flo. Brooke and Ridge then storms over to Forrester Creations, to get answers from Flo about Phoebe. Flo and her mother Shauna are there and Brooke asks Flo about Liam's assumptions about Phoebe being Beth. Flo confesses that she is not Phoebe's birth mother, but Hope is the birth mother. Brooke angrily demands Flo to tell her how Steffy has her granddaughter. Flo revealed that Dr. Reese Buckingham (Hopes doctor) owed people a lot of money from a gambling debt and that he needed the money fast or they would kill Zoe (Buckingham's daughter). Flo goes into detail that Reese stole Beth from hope when she passed out from labor, and that he switched Beth with another baby who was stillborn. Also Reese made Hope and Liam believe that the baby they were holding was Beth, and had Flo give Steffy Beth and collect the money from Taylor for the adoption for his debt. Flo tells Brooke and Ridge that Taylor had no idea what Reese was doing, and that she wanted to give Steffy a daughter for her to raise.

It is a private sector hospital, and is located in the New Territories. It provides a very wide range of services. Tsuen Wan Adventist Hospital is subject to international healthcare accreditation - for many years it has been surveyed and accredited by the UK's QHA Trent Accreditation, and more recently it has also been assessed by Joint Commission International from the US, although as of 2010 not any more. History In 1960, Dr. Harry Willis Miller was asked by the Seventh-day Adventist Church to establish a hospital in Hong Kong. Now Dr. Miller was no stranger to local Chinese. In 1925 he established the Shanghai Sanitarium and Hospital in China, a country he first visited in 1903. Mr. Tong Ping Yuen, a friend of Dr. Miller and the owner of the South Seas Textile Factory, donated a floor. With the help of the Medical and Health Department, a land grant was secured from the Government. The Jockey Club provided funds for the ground floor. Equipment was funded by the American Government. The Hospital was officially opened in May 1964. Owing to a shortage of funds, it was five years later, in June 1970, that the hospital building was completed with the generous donation from the American Government.

The Deeds was written between about 1315 and 1320 on Cyprus and presents a history of the Crusader states and the Kingdom of Cyprus from 1132 down to 1309 as well as an account of the trials of the Templars in 1314.Minervini 2006. It is divisible into three parts and the third, which is the original work of the compiler, is the most important source for the final years of the Kingdom of Jerusalem and one of only two eyewitness accounts of the fall of Acre in 1291.Crawford 2016, p. 1. Author All that can be known of the anonymous author/compiler must be derived from the text of the Deeds itself. The designation Templar of Tyre, implying that the author/compiler was a member of the Knights Templar resident in Tyre, has long been recognised as ungrounded. It was based on his evident association with Guillaume de Beaujeu, master of the Templars from 1273 until 1291, and his long residence in Tyre between 1269 and 1283. In fact, he is unlikely to have been a Templar knight himself since he would have been arrested along with all the other Templars in Cyprus in 1308.Crawford 2016, pp. 2‚Äì7. The author was born about 1255 and would have been no more than fifteen years of age when he was a page of Margaret of Antioch-Lusignan in 1269. He served her as a page for one year and was present at her wedding in Tyre to John of Montfort in 1269. As Margaret was the sister of King Hugh III of Cyprus, it is likely that her pages were drawn from the Cypriot nobility and that \\"Templar of Tyre\\" was born in Cyprus to a lesser noble family. The author was fluent in Arabic and translated letters from the Egyptian sultan al-Ashraf Khalil to Guillaume de Beaujeu into French. Text The Deeds is preserved in a single Cypriot manuscript (MS Torino, Biblioteca Reale, Varia 433) that was copied in 1343 for the head of the Mimars family by his prisoner, John le Miege, in the castle of Kyrenia. Both the beginning and end of the text are missing. The text probably originally began with Creation, but in its present state it begins in 1132. Likewise, the narrative ends abruptly in mid-1309 but originally extended a little further. Probably it did not go further than 1321, almost certainly no further than 1324. The three divisions of the work are based on different sources. The first, which takes the narrative down to 1224, is derived from the Annales de Terre Sainte. The second, which covers the years 1223‚Äì1242 and the War of the Lombards, is derived from the History of the War between the Emperor Frederick and Sir John of Ibelin by Philip of Novara and also contains five poems written by Philip on the war. The third makes use of the Estoire d'Eracles, which it calls the Livre dou conquest, to fill in the period down to 1270, after which the compiler makes use of his own memory and oral testimony to write an original account of the final years of the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the following two decades on Cyprus. Although the surviving text is cut off in mid-1309, it does contain a detailed report on the trial of the Templars in 1314.

He is perhaps best known for his appearances as \\"Officer Clemmons\\" on the PBS television series Mister Rogers' Neighborhood from 1968 to 1993. Early life and education Clemmons in Oberlin College's 1967 yearbook Clemmons was born in Birmingham, Alabama and raised in Youngstown, Ohio. When it was discovered that he had an excellent singing voice, he began performing locally at church functions. He became choir director of his church at the age of 10. His first songs were the spirituals of pre-Civil War America, passed down to him by his mother. He soon branched out across genres, singing with various community groups. For a while, he was the lead singer of a rock 'n' roll group called the Jokers. Clemmons received a Bachelor of Music degree from Oberlin College, and a Master of Fine Arts from Carnegie Mellon University. He also received an honorary degree of Doctor of Arts from Middlebury College. Metropolitan Opera  In 1968, Clemmons won the Metropolitan Opera auditions in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He went on to Cleveland, Ohio, where he won a position in the Metropolitan Opera Studio. He sang there professionally for seven seasons, performing over 70 roles with companies including The New York City Opera, Los Angeles Civic Light Opera, and Washington Civic Opera. Clemmons sang with numerous orchestras, including the Cleveland Orchestra, the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, and the Philadelphia Orchestra. In 1976, he won a Grammy Award for a recording of Porgy and Bess; he performed the role of \\"Sportin' Life\\" over 100 times. Mister Rogers' Neighborhood Mister Rogers and Officer Clemmons having a foot bath in 1969. For 25 years, Clemmons performed the role of Officer Clemmons, a friendly neighborhood policeman, in the \\"Neighborhood of Make-Believe\\" on the children's television show Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. In the neighborhood itself, Clemmons ran a singing and dance studio located in the building diagonally across the street from Mister Rogers' house. He was one of the first African Americans to have a recurring role on a kids' TV series, and his presentation ‚Äì as both a beloved neighbor to Mister Rogers and as a respected authority figure ‚Äì has been described as a ground-breaking message in race relations. For example, in 1969, when African- Americans were not permitted to swim in community pools alongside white people, Mr. Rogers invited Officer Clemmons to cool his feet with him in a small, plastic wading pool. Mr. Rogers lent Officer Clemmons a towel to dry his feet and then used the same towel to dry his own feet, breaking a well- known color barrier. Clemmons told the story of how he became \\"Officer Clemmons\\" on StoryCorps. The Harlem Spiritual Ensemble In the late 1980s, Clemmons had an experience singing spirituals with a friend that left him profoundly moved. The experience led him away from operatic performance toward an earlier love: traditional spirituals: > I was enjoying the singing of these spirituals .... I was giving artistry in > a way ‚Äì I was giving my art in a way that I had not felt it was so important > as when I was singing Mozart ‚Äì or when I was singing Schubert ‚Äì or Donizetti > or Bellini .... I began to ask Fred Rogers why there was no professional > ensemble that sang spirituals comparable to a Haydn Society or a St. Cecelia > Society or a Handel Society or Bach. When he was unable to find a society like the one he envisioned, Clemmons decided to create one: The Harlem Spiritual Ensemble was dedicated to preserving the American Negro Spiritual. Middlebury College From 1997 until his retirement in 2013, Clemmons was the Alexander Twilight Artist in Residence and director of the Martin Luther King Spiritual Choir at Middlebury College in Middlebury, Vermont. He \\"played the role of professor, choirmaster, resident vocal soloist, advisor, confidant, and community cheerleader\\". He is also well known in the Middlebury community for his superb rendition of the Star Spangled Banner, which he sings at the Middlebury College men's basketball games. Writing and arranging On May 15, 2020, Clemmons published his autobiography, Officer Clemmons: A Memoir. Clemmons actively writes across genres for a variety of age groups. Currently, he is writing a children's story entitled ButterCup and the Majic Cane and a volume of poetry entitled A Place Of My Own. Some of his published works include a volume of spirituals named Songs for Today and a stage musical called My Name Is Hayes based on the life of Roland Hayes. He also commissioned a choral work composed of spirituals entitled Changed My Name, arranged by Linda Twine. Personal life While attending Oberlin College, Clemmons realized that he was gay, but remained closeted, fearing disapproval from his religious family and the community. In 1968, Fred Rogers told Clemmons that while his sexuality did not matter to him personally, Clemmons could not be \\"out\\" and continue appearing on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, because of the scandal that would arise. In the late 1960s, Rogers and others suggested that Clemmons get married as a way to deal with his sexual orientation, which he did. His marriage to wife Carol did not work out, and Clemmons divorced in 1974 so that he could live openly as a gay man. Rogers remained personally supportive of Clemmons, but required him to avoid any indication of his homosexuality ‚Äì such as the earring he began to wear as a signifier ‚Äì on the program. Rogers later revised his counsel to Clemmons as countless gays came out more publicly following the 1969 Stonewall riots. Rogers even urged Clemmons to enter into a long-term, stable gay relationship, and he always warmly welcomed Clemmons' gay friends whenever they visited the television set in Pittsburgh. Clemmons lives and works in Middlebury, Vermont, where he is the Emeritus Artist in Residence of Middlebury College. He is a member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, the national fraternity for men in music.

It provides wilderness protection to thousands of small islands, rocks, reefs, headlands, marshes, and bays totaling 371 acres (150 ha) spanning 320 miles (515 km) of Oregon's coastline. The areas are all managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The six National Wildlife Refuges‚Äîthree marine, and three estuarine‚Äîare from Tillamook Head south to the California-Oregon border. The marine refuges are Three Arch Rocks, Oregon Islands, and Cape Meares. The estuarine are Bandon Marsh, Nestucca Bay, and Siletz Bay. Except for Tillamook Rock Light and its surrounding rock, all the islands are closed to public access. Boats must remain at least 500 ft (150 m) away, and aircraft must maintain at least clearance. Three Arch Rocks National Wildlife Refuge Three Arch Rocks National Wildlife Refuge was the first National Wildlife Refuge west of the Mississippi River. The refuge has provided protection for Oregon's largest seabird nesting colony of more 230,000 birds since October 14, 1907. Three Arch Rocks consists of 15 acres (6 ha) in three large and six small rocks located about a half mile (1 km) offshore from Oceanside. It is one of the smallest designated wilderness areas in the U.S., but features the largest colony of breeding tufted puffins and the largest common murre colony south of Alaska. It is the only northern Oregon pupping site for the threatened Steller sea lion. = History = The refuge was established by President Theodore Roosevelt after being persuaded by two young conservationists‚ÄîWilliam L. Finley and Herman Bohlman‚Äîwho studied and photographed Three Arch Rocks from Oceanside beginning in 1901. They recorded hunters killing dozens of sea lions at a time for skin and oil, and sportsmen shooting seabirds purely for sport. Due to a scarcity of regional chicken farms at the time, seabird eggs were priced at up to a dollar per dozen, encouraging egg harvesting and reducing the bird colony population. Finley and Bohlman suggested a wildlife refuge to Roosevelt for protecting dwindling populations and ensure survival of seabird and marine mammal populations. Roosevelt declared the refuge in 1907. = Access = The islands are closed to public access. Boats must remain at least 500 feet (150 m) away during summer months, and aircraft must maintain at least clearance.

However, good viewing is possible from Coquille Point in Bandon and other locations suggested by the Oregon Coast Birding Trail. Cape Meares National Wildlife Refuge Cape Meares National Wildlife Refuge protects one of the last remaining coastal old growth forests. This Oregon refuge set on Cape Meares has provided protection since 1938 for Sitka spruce and western hemlock, some more than 200 feet (60 m) tall and hundreds of years old. The conditions are ideal habitat for several threatened bird species, including bald eagles and peregrine falcons‚Äîthe latter once at the brink of extinction. A pair of peregrine falcons has resided here since 1987. The Oregon Coast Trail passes through the center of this headland refuge where interpretive displays describe its many inhabitants. It is possible to see migrating gray whales, three types of scoter, western grebe, and common loons. A wildlife viewing deck provides a seasonal view into the aerie of a falcon pair. Three Arch Rocks National Wildlife Refuge and Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge are easily seen from the cape. Also, Cape Meares Light, and an Oregon state park are adjacent.

Last expanded in 1999, it now has 889 acres (360 ha) in two units: Bandon Marsh and Ni-les'tun. Bandon Marsh is popular for hunting, fishing, clamming, birding and photography. The refuge protects the largest tidal salt marsh in the Coquille River estuary. The mudflats are rich in clam, crab, worm, and shrimp and attracts migrating shorebirds, waterfowl, coho salmon, as well as the California brown pelican. More common shorebird species include western and least sandpiper, semipalmated plover, black-bellied plover, Pacific golden plover, red phalarope, whimbrel, dunlin. The Ni-les'tun unit is a habitat restoration project which will eventually benefit fish and wildlife. In consists of intertidal and freshwater marsh, and riparian land. It also protects a 4,500-year-old Native American archaeological site of the Coquille Indian Tribe. There are several overlooks, as well as access for hunters, birders, fisherman, and clammers. State and federal regulations are in effect. The marsh is located just north of Bandon, on the east side of the Coquille river across from Bullards Beach State Park. Nestucca Bay National Wildlife Refuge Nestucca Bay National Wildlife Refuge supports one tenth of the world's dusky Canada goose population. The refuge contains at least seven types of habitat, including tidal marsh, tidal mudflats, grassland, woodland, pasture, forested lag‚Äîa transition between raised peat bog and mineral soil‚Äîand freshwater bogs, including the southernmost coastal sphagnum bog habitat on the Pacific Coast. The sphagnum bog provides habitat for many interesting and unusual species, such as the insect-eating sundew plant and the bog cranberry. Scientists have discovered many layers of sand and peat under Neskowin Marsh indicating a long history of tsunami activity which carries sand from the coastal sand dunes. These might be the best record of tsunami activity within the Cascadia subduction zone. The refuge was established in 1991, and is located on Nestucca Bay at the confluence of the Nestucca and Little Nestucca rivers, ranging 3 to 5 miles (5 to 8 km) south of Pacific City. Across the bay to the west is Nestucca Spit and Robert W. Straub state parks. The refuge is closed to all public use, except during two special events: one in February and one in October. A viewing area is planned for construction, probably in 2008. Siletz Bay National Wildlife Refuge Siletz Bay National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1991 primarily to return salt marsh to its natural state. Formerly it had been diked and crossed with ditches to create pasture for dairy cow grazing. More than 9,300 ft (2.8 km) of dikes were removed and a quarter mile (500 m) of ditch were filled to initiate restoration. Salt-starched skeleton trees are visible along both sides of U.S. Route 101 (which runs through the refuge) from the time when the salt marsh was diked. Red-tailed hawks and bald eagles are often visible roosting on these snags. Abundant great blue heron and great egret live nearby. The refuge is located on Siletz Bay, immediately south of Lincoln City where the Siletz River enters the bay. It is closed to all public use, except during special events.

It is one of six National Wildlife Refuges comprising the Oregon Coast National Wildlife Refuge Complex. The Oregon Islands provides wilderness protection to 1,853 small islands, rocks, and reefs plus two headlands, totaling spanning of Oregon's coastline from the Oregon‚ÄìCalifornia border to Tillamook Head. There are sites in six of the seven coastal counties of Oregon. From north to south they are Clatsop, Tillamook, Lincoln, Lane, Coos, and Curry counties. (Douglas County is the only coastal Oregon county not included in the refuge.) History The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was created in 1935 by the federal government. Haystack Rock off Cannon Beach was added to the refuge in 1968, and then became a wilderness area in 1978. The first mainland addition to the refuge came in 1991 when Coquille Point near Bandon was added. In 1999, the shipwreck of the New Carissa near Coos Bay spilled oil that killed some birds at the refuge. Wildlife and access View from the south, Oregon Islands NWR View of seabird colonies from the Crook Point Unit of Oregon Islands NWR It is a sanctuary for nesting seabirds of thirteen species‚Äîsome of the most important nesting seabird colonies in the U.S. Over 1.2 million individuals nest in colonies here, more than on the California and Washington coasts combined. The most prevalent species are common murres, tufted puffins, rhinoceros and Cassin's auklets, pigeon guillemots, Leach's storm-petrels, several species of gulls, and Caspian terns. Four species of pinniped breed, molt, and rest on these lands, including harbor seals, Steller and California sea lions. The southern portion of the refuge provides the greatest number of breeding and pupping sites for Steller sea lions in the U.S. outside Alaska. Except for Tillamook Rock Light and its surrounding rock, all the islands are closed to public access. Boats must remain at least away, and aircraft are asked to maintain at least clearance. However, good viewing is possible from Coquille Point in Bandon and other locations suggested by the Oregon Coast Birding Trail. The area is managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.

He was a prolific writer, editor of nine periodicals, university professor, and member of numerous societies and organizations. His most notable works of fiction include the novel Pragiedruliai (Cloud Clearing) and the narrative Dƒódƒós ir dƒódienƒós (Uncles and Aunts) about the ordinary village folk. Born to a family of Lithuanian peasants, Tumas was educated at a gymnasium in Daugavpils (present-day Latvia) and Kaunas Priest Seminary. He began contributing to the Lithuanian press, then banned by the Tsarist authorities, in 1889 or 1890. He was ordained as a priest in 1893 and posted to Mitau (present-day Jelgava, Latvia). In 1895, he was reassigned to Mosƒódis in northwestern Lithuania. There he organized the publication of Tƒóvynƒós sargas and the book smuggling into Lithuania. His brother Jonas was caught with the banned publications and was sentenced to three years in prison and two years of exile. Due to his Lithuanian activities and short temper, Tumas quarreled with his superiors and was frequently moved to increasingly more remote parishes. However, in 1906, bishops of Samogitia and Vilnius agreed to allow Tumas to move to Vilnius to work as an editor of the daily Vilniaus ≈æinios published by Petras Vilei≈°is. He edited the newspaper only for a couple of months but remained in Vilnius as editor of Viltis, co-founded with Antanas Smetona. This new cultural newspaper hoped to unite conservative Catholic clergy and more liberal intelligentsia for the common good of the Lithuanian nation. After publishing an article critical of the Diocese of Vilnius for suppressing the Lithuanian language in favor of the Polish language, Tumas was exiled to Lai≈æuva in 1911. In 1911, together with Konstantinas Ol≈°auskas, he toured Lithuanian American communities collecting donations for the construction of the headquarters of the Saulƒó Society. During World War I, Tumas moved to Riga and edited Rygos garsas. As a member of the Lithuanian Society for the Relief of War Sufferers, he organized relief for Lithuanian refugees. In 1917, as one of the founders of the Party of National Progress, he attended political conferences in Petrograd, Kiev, and Stockholm advocating for full independence of Lithuania. He returned to Vilnius in 1918, but moved to Kaunas after the city was captured by Poland. He edited Tauta, published by the Party of National Progress, and ran in the elections to the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania, but largely withdrew from politics when he was not elected. He became rector of the Church of Vytautas the Great and organized its reconstruction. From 1922 to 1929, he taught a course on the Lithuanian literature during the era of the Lithuanian press ban (1864‚Äì1904) at the University of Lithuania. Tumas published several works on writers' biographies and amassed a large collection of material (manuscripts, correspondence, photos, etc.) about the writers. On the basis of this material, he organized a literary archive at the university. Biography =Early life and education= Tumas' memorial in his native Malei≈°iai Tumas was born in the village of north of Svƒódasai into a peasant family that owned 24 dessiatins of land. He was the youngest of ten children, but only he and four siblings survived to adulthood. Tumas was born at midday of the Nativity of Mary (O.S. 8 September). His mother, aged 45, took all this as a sign that he should become a priest. At age five, Tumas received his Confirmation from bishop Motiejus Valanƒçius in Kaunas. He completed his elementary school studies in within two years, which was faster than any other student. However, his knowledge was poor ‚Äì he had very good memory and could repeat material without understanding it. Nevertheless, in fall 1881, he managed to pass entrance exams to the gymnasium in Daugavpils which accepted about 50 students out of 150 applicants. After four years of study, his parents urged him to transfer to the Kaunas Priest Seminary, but he decided to finish the studies and started earning a living by giving private lessons. Long studies followed by private lessons to make a living negatively impacted Tumas' health and he frequently contracted respiratory illnesses. During this time he developed an interest in Russian classic literature, particularly biographies and memoirs. His favorites were autobiographical novels Childhood, Boyhood, and Youth by Leo Tolstoy. He also read Sergey Aksakov, Ivan Turgenev (A Sportsman's Sketches), Gleb Uspensky, Mikhail Zagoskin, Ivan Goncharov, Nikolay Dobrolyubov, Dmitry Pisarev, and other authors. The gymnasium students organized and Tumas participated in illegal groups to read and discuss various banned, mostly socialist, publications. Lithuanian introduced Tumas to Au≈°ra (Dawn), the first Lithuanian-language periodical that was printed in Tilsit, East Prussia, due to the Lithuanian press ban. However, Tumas did not adopt socialist worldview and there were too few Lithuanians to develop any kind of Lithuanian activities. After repeating the final year for the second time, Tumas graduated the gymnasium in 1888. After graduation, Tumas had to choose university or priest seminary. He doubted his calling for priesthood and considered studying veterinary in Saint Petersburg. His family's wishes and his poor health decided that he applied to the Kaunas Priest Seminary. He had no particular calling for the theology studies and especially struggled with Latin: before entering the seminary, he knew no Latin and there were no Lithuanian or Russian dictionaries, thus he had to use a Polish‚ÄìLatin dictionary but he did not know Polish either. Lithuanian language was taught by Kazimieras Jaunius who provided little practical knowledge but inspired his students. Lithuanian students, including Tumas, organized a secret society with a goal of translating and publishing various Lithuanian religious texts. It became known as the Society of Saint Casimir when one of its members obtained relics of Saint Casimir, the patron saint of Lithuania. Catholic periodical ≈Ωemaiƒçi≈≥ ir Lietuvos ap≈ævalga (Samogitian and Lithuanian Review) appeared in October 1889 and Tumas contributed articled on Catholic and Lithuanian topics. His first contribution to the Lithuanian press was a correspondence to either Varpas in 1889 or ≈Ωemaiƒçi≈≥ ir Lietuvos ap≈ævalga in 1890. Due to a bout of tuberculosis, Tumas interrupted his studies in early 1890 and returned to his native Malei≈°iai for vacation and treatment for a year and a half. During that time, he continued to write for ≈Ωemaiƒçi≈≥ ir Lietuvos ap≈ævalga. He returned to the seminary and concentrated on his studies, graduating in fall 1893. During the summer 1893, Tumas traveled to Mosƒódis in an attempt to persuade Kazimieras Pakalni≈°kis, editor of ≈Ωemaiƒçi≈≥ ir Lietuvos ap≈ævalga, to soften his criticism of the secular intelligentsia. He was ordained as a priest on 28 November 1893 in Kaunas Cathedral by bishop . At some point, he also joined the Third Order of Saint Francis. =Publisher of Tƒóvynƒós sargas= Tumas in 1894 Tumas was first sent by the Diocese of Samogitia as vicar to Mitau (present-day Jelgava, Latvia), away from Lithuanian-speaking areas. However, Mitau already had a vicar, who moved from Il≈´kste without diocese's approval. Therefore, Tumas received a very cold welcome from local priests. He worked as a chaplain of a prison and a private gymnasium, and struggled with Polish-language sermons. In Mitau, Tumas found a group of Lithuanians, including linguist Jonas Jablonskis and attorney Antanas Kri≈°ƒçiukaitis, and often attended their gatherings. Jablonskis approved his first more serious literary experiment ‚Äì a translation of one of the short stories by Henryk Sienkiewicz ‚Äì and published it in Varpas. Dean Piotr Walent disapproved such meetings and wanted to control Tumas' activities, but Tumas refused to obey. Their conflict continued until the dean was deported to Simbirsk in January 1895. At the same time, 23 other priests implicated in the case were deported to other locations in Russia. Tumas was not satisfied with his posting in Mitau and, after reading a poem by Maironis in spring 1895, sent an emotional letter to the bishop requesting a reassignment. He received a reply in a week, but did not get a new posting until four months later. In summer 1895, Tumas was assigned as a vicar and a teacher of religion to Mosƒódis. He devoted his efforts to the Lithuanian press. In collaboration with priests Felicijonas Lelis and Kazimieras Kazlauskas held in the Kretinga Monastery, Tumas established the monthly magazine Tƒóvynƒós sargas (Guardian of the Fatherland) in January 1896. Due to the Lithuanian press ban, it had to be printed in East Prussia and then smuggled into Lithuania. Tumas almost single- handedly edited the magazine from the December 1897 to the April‚ÄìMay 1902 issue. While it was a Catholic publication, it was relatively more liberal than ≈Ωemaiƒçi≈≥ ir Lietuvos ap≈ævalga. It attempted to reconcile the Catholic dogma with the Lithuanian National Revival. While the newspaper promoted the Lithuanian identity (faith, language, culture) and opposed various Russification policies, it did not support political resistance against the Tsarist regime and in general accepted the existing social and political order. In October 1896, Tumas' brother Jonas was arrested in Priekulƒó for transporting a suitcase full of booklets printed by Tƒóvynƒós sargas. The police also seized letters that implicated others in the book smuggling operation, but Tumas managed to bribe police officials and destroy the letters. Tumas was searched, interrogated, dismissed from his job as a teacher, and sentenced to five years of exile by the Governor-General of Vilnius. His friends, particularly former classmate , encouraged him to flee to United States, but Adomas Jak≈°tas who was deported for five years to Ustyuzhna persuaded him to stay. The Ministry of the Interior did not approve the sentence and it was reduced to a year of house arrest. His brother, caught red handed, could not avoid the punishment and served three years in the Kresty Prison and two years of exile in Bessarabia. In August 1898, Tumas was transferred to Kuliai. It was a convenient location for Tumas' illegal work ‚Äì it was remote but also close to the Prussia‚ÄìRussia border ‚Äì and he organized a distribution point for the banned Lithuanian press. A local farmer would smuggle the books across the border, Tumas would hide them in the large clergy house until book smugglers such as Jonas Krik≈°ƒçi≈´nas picked them up for further distribution. To help the distribution, Tumas decided to split Tƒóvynƒós sargas into two parts ‚Äì the first part contained more dangerous political topics and thus could bring harsher sentences, while the second part contained more innocent practical articles on farming, etc. and thus attracted less interest from the police. This magazine was geared towards the common folk and Tumas yearned for a magazine for the intelligentsia. To that end, he published five issues of ≈Ωinyƒçia (Treasury of Knowledge) in 1900‚Äì1902. It was a cultural, not political magazine. Tumas was an avid reader. A surviving list of books owned by Tumas in 1899 shows 433 books, acquired since 1894. The list did not include any of the illegal Lithuanian publications and thus should be longer. =Troubles with the superiors= In 1900, someone wrote an angry article to ≈™kininkas (Farmer) about Duke , owner of the Rietavas Manor. Ogi≈Ñski suspected that its author was Tumas and complained to bishop , who reassigned Tumas to near Kur≈°ƒónai in July 1901. Tumas had to leave Tƒóvynƒós sargas in care of Antanas Milukas, though continued to be actively involved in its publication and officially resigned as editor in the first issue of 1902. In Micaiƒçiai, Tumas began organizing a charitable society that would maintain a shelter for the poor. His work, commenced without the proper approval of his superiors, and deeply pro-Lithuanian attitudes upset priests from Viek≈°niai, Kur≈°ƒónai, and ≈†akyna. They wrote complaints to bishop Paliulionis. Church of St. John of Nepomuk in Vadaktƒóliai where Tumas worked in 1902‚Äì1905 One of the complaints attacked a translation of a short catechism by Roch Filochowski published by Tumas in 1898 with counterfeited publication data (supposedly, published in 1863 at the Zawadzki Press in Vilnius). The complaint protested that the catechism also counterfeited its approbation (supposedly, by bishop Motiejus Valanƒçius) and that it replaced various Polish loanwords and barbarisms with Lithuanian equivalents. In another complaint, Tumas was attacked for insisting that fellow priests spoke Lithuanian among themselves. As a result, Tumas was reassigned to a small and poor church in north of Vadaktai in May 1902. In October 1902, the Samogitian consistory, presided by suffragan bishop , debated complaints against Tumas, including that he was a leader of the Lithuanian National Revival, that he published an illegal Lithuanian newspaper and that he traveled widely soliciting contributions and donations to this newspaper. He was largely cleared of the charges, but was put on probation. He was to cease activities not directly related to his clerical duties and was prohibited from printing anything or traveling anywhere without an approval of the bishop. Tumas, isolated in Vadaktƒóliai under a watchful eye of fellow priests and police, was still able participate in Lithuanian activities. For example, in 1903, he published a translation of an invitation to the Lithuanian nobility to join the National Revival by Adomas Jak≈°tas in Dirva- ≈Ωinynas (Soil-Reference Book) and continued to care for the finances of Tƒóvynƒós sargas. He remained in Vadaktƒóliai despite his friends' suggestions of ways to improve his station ‚Äì Antanas Milukas urged to emigrate to United States where he could become a parish priest in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, Andrius Dubinskas suggested moving to Riga or Saint Petersburg, and Jak≈°tas proposed to pursue an advanced degree in theology. =Russian Revolution of 1905= Postcard of Tumas () The outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War forced the Tsarist government to make concessions to ethnic minorities and the Lithuanian press ban was lifted in April 1904. He met the news with plans for a publication on ethnography, one of his many interests boosted by a visit from Finnish ethnographer . He published a call in Vilniaus ≈æinios (News of Vilnius) for the publication to be edited by Jonas Jablonskis, but the plans remained unrealized. During the Russian Revolution of 1905, before the Great Seimas of Vilnius in December 1905, he visited all Lithuanian dioceses (Samogitia, Vilnius, and Sejny) as well as the Saint Petersburg Roman Catholic Theological Academy organizing the priests. At the seimas, he was elected to its presidium, but resigned giving up his seat to Pranci≈°kus B≈´ƒçys. He delivered a speech promoting non-violent resistance to the Tsarist regime and cited the example of Finland. At the seimas, priests organized the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Union, predecessor of the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party, and Tumas petitioned bishop Eduard von der Ropp to remain in Vilnius as union's representative, but the bishop rejected the request. Tumas returned to Vadaktƒóliai and organized a local chapter of the union. He also proposed regulations protecting manor workers ‚Äì some of the ideas were later incorporated into a national law, drafted by Mykolas Krupaviƒçius, Minister of Agriculture from 1923 to 1926. Upon learning of such activities, bishop Paliulionis urgently reassigned Tumas to Sidabravas in December 1905 and to Stakiai in March 1906. Due to the relocation, he skipped the election to the first Russian State Duma. He was also arrested before moving to Stakiai, but released on bail. He helped Vincas Mickeviƒçius-Kapsukas, future Soviet revolutionary, hide from the Tsarist police. In Stakiai, which was particularly remote ( to the nearest school and to the nearest town), Tumas mostly took care of the church's farm and organized a purchase of phosphate fertilisers for the entire village to use. =Vilniaus ≈æinios and Viltis= Petras Vilei≈°is, the publisher of the daily Vilniaus ≈æinios (News of Vilnius), suffered financial difficulties and searched for ways to increase the newspaper's circulation. He enlisted the clergy to help the newspaper and they searched for a new editor among the priests. The younger priests advocated for Tumas, particularly given his editorial experience with Tƒóvynƒós sargas. Reluctantly, bishops Paliulionis and von der Ropp agreed to transfer Tumas to Vilnius to work on the newspaper. He was promised a monthly salary of 75 rubles, but he was hesitant to take the offer. He cautioned that he was arrogant, short-tempered, and held strong convictions and opinions. He penned a declaration of principles that he would try to adhere to as the new editor. Vilniaus ≈æinios was to be a liberal nationalist Catholic publication advocating for the Lithuanian autonomy within the Russian Empire. It would not be socialist, but it would treat all social classes equally. It would defend the Catholic faith as the foundation of the order and morality and the Lithuanian nation as an equal to others. Tumas left Stakiai in February 1907 and edited the newspaper until it briefly stopped the publication in April 1907. During that short time, Tumas wrote many articles on various topics, including on education, art, economy. Tumas (right) transfers Viltis to its new editor Fabijonas Kemƒó≈°is (left) in 1911 When Vilniaus ≈æinios was briefly discontinued due to financial difficulties, Tumas and his co-editor Antanas Smetona organized the publication of Viltis (Hope), a new newspaper that hoped to unite conservative Catholic clergy and more liberal intelligentsia for the common good of the Lithuanian nation. Tumas traveled across Lithuania agitating priests to support the endeavor and managed to sign up 179 shareholders who each agreed to contribute 100 rubles annually to the trust company set up to publish the newspaper. The first issue appeared in October 1907. While Smetona was influential setting the ideology, he had a full-time job at the Vilnius Land Bank and thus Tumas handled most of the day-to-day workings of the publication. Published three times a week, Viltis concentrated on cultural matters as opposed to politics or news reports, paying particular attention to the Lithuanian language and folk culture as well as issues in art, science, education, and morals. Tumas wrote reviews of literary and scientific works. Tumas was also active in Lithuanian cultural life in Vilnius. He was a board member of the Lithuanian Scientific Society and gifted some of his personal book collection to its new library. He was also a member of the and participated in the cultural R≈´ta Society. In July 1910, Tumas traveled as a correspondent to the official opening of the Grunwald Monument in Krak√≥w during the celebration of the 500th anniversary of the Battle of Grunwald. His critical article was published in the Ukrainian newspaper . He contrasted the celebration, attended by many dignitaries, with Estonian and Latvian Song Festivals and concluded that the Grunwald celebration did not sufficiently involve all social classes. The Polish press responded by attacking Tumas and accusing him of anti-Polish attitudes. Viltis had a permanent column to report on the situation of Lithuanian Catholics in the Diocese of Vilnius and in particular on their fight for the Lithuanian- language church services. In November 1910, Tumas published an article listing known churches where Lithuanian-language services were removed by orders of , administrator of the Diocese of Vilnius while Bishop von der Ropp was in exile. This caused much controversy and, in February 1911, bishop assigned Tumas to Lai≈æuva in northern Lithuania. Effectively, it was an exile and also meant his departure from Viltis. His place was taken by other priests, Fabijonas Kemƒó≈°is and later Juozas Dabu≈æis. Various Lithuanian groups sent letters protesting the removal of Tumas-Vai≈ægantas to Viltis for three months. =Exile to Lai≈æuva= Tumas arrived to Lai≈æuva on 1 March 1911. Just three months later, in May, priest Konstantinas Ol≈°auskas invited him to visit Lithuanian American communities and collect donations for the construction of the headquarters of the Saulƒó Society which organized Lithuanian schools in the Kovno Governorate. Aboard the SS Kronprinzessin Cecilie they arrived to New York on 5 July. They toured 55 Lithuanian American communities for three months and collected about $19,000 () or 34,000 rubles. More donations were collected in Lithuania and the headquarters, a three-storey brick building at a cost of 155,000 rubles, was completed in ≈Ωaliakalnis in 1914. Upon the return, Tumas visited variousl Lithuanian towns and delivered over thirty speeches against emigration to the United States sharing stories of the difficult conditions and poverty of Lithuanian Americans. In 1912, these lectures were published as a separate booklet by the Society of Saint Casimir. In 1912, Tumas was offered to move to Riga to work as an editor of Rygos garsas (Sound of Riga) and encouraged to run for the Russian State Duma. However, he refused in part due to debts and ill health. He did participate in the Duma elections, helping to elect Lithuanian candidates, including Martynas Yƒças. During 1912, Tumas suffered from a depressive episode or neurasthenia. He also nursed his nephew Kazys Mƒóginis who died of tuberculosis in spring 1913. After his death, Tumas' attention shifted from journalism to literary work. He collected his previous works, edited them for style and language, and published in various Lithuanian newspapers hoping to publish them as separate booklets. In August 1913, Tumas, as a correspondent of Viltis, participated in the opening of the Estonia Theatre in Tallinn. When a conflict with the conservative clergy forced Antanas Smetona to resign from Viltis in September 1913, he established a new publication Vairas (Rudder) to continue the same ideology as the original Viltis. Tumas contributed his best works to Vairas with only a few submissions to Viltis. =During World War I= In summer 1914, , editor of Rygos garsas and former contributor to Tƒóvynƒós sargas, visited Tumas in Lai≈æuva and offered him to become co-editor of the newspaper published in Riga. At the time, about 50,000 Lithuanians lived in Riga. New bishop supported the effort and even found a priest that would buy Tumas' farm so that he could repay his debts. Tumas arrived to Riga in December 1914 and lived at the clergy house of the Our Lady of Sorrows Church. He was promised a salary of 30 rubles a month for his editorial work, but due to financial difficulties did not receive it. Rygos garsas was a four-page newspaper published twice a week. Bikinas edited news and political articles, while Tumas edited articles on cultural and societal matters. To address war-time demand for news, the publication frequency was increased to three times a week and the circulation reached 13,000 copies. Tumas (sitting), Martynas Yƒças (left) and Jurgis Savickis (right) in Stockholm in 1918 With the German attack in the Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes in February 1915, Lithuanian war refugees began arriving to Riga. Tumas and others organized refugee relief ‚Äì opening shelters and soup kitchens, providing clothes and basic medical care, finding employment. Tumas and Pranas Ma≈°iotas became representatives of the Lithuanian Society for the Relief of War Sufferers. In his fundraising efforts, Tumas met with various Latvian activists, including JƒÅnis ƒåakste and Alberts Kviesis, future Presidents of Latvia. In five months, Lithuanians in Riga raised 10,314 rubles and helped some 4,000 refugees. When, as a result of the Great Retreat, German army took control of Lithuania in September 1915, the Lithuanian Society for the Relief of War Sufferers split into two sections ‚Äì one remained in Vilnius and the other evacuated to Saint Petersburg. Tumas was invited to become the general manager of the Saint Petersburg section, but quickly relinquished the duties as he was ill-suited for an office job. Instead, he traveled across Russia visiting Lithuanian refugees in Tambov, Crimea, Kursk, Tver, and elsewhere. He also wrote and published fiction works (four booklets in 1915‚Äì1916) and translated booklets for children (three works in 1917). During the summer 1916 vacation in Voronezh, Tumas delivered a series of lectures Lithuanian teachers on Lithuanian writers and literature and planned on publishing the lectures as a separate book. Lithuanians became more politically active, particularly after the February Revolution, working to secure Lithuania's future after the war. Together with and , both former contributors to Viltis, Tumas established the Party of National Progress in 1916, but it became publicly active in early 1917. The party essentially adopted the same ideology as Viltis ‚Äì represent the middle (nationalist) road between socialists and Christian democrats. In February 1917, Tumas was elected to the Council of the Lithuanian Nation, which aspired to become an authoritative body that could represent all Lithuanians and their political objectives. The council decided to organize a political conference, known as the Petrograd Seimas, in June 1917. Tumas traveled to Riga to help elect six representatives of the Party of National Progress to the Seimas (in total, the party had 20 representatives at the Seimas) and to Mogilev to convince not to hold a separate Catholic conference. The Seimas was a raucous affair with passionate disagreements whether Lithuanians should demand full independence or autonomy within the Russian Empire. Tumas and other members of his party called for full independence. Their resolution won by a narrow margin of vote, but the opponents could not accept it and withdrew from the Seimas splintering the Council of the Lithuanian Nation. It was a severe blow to Tumas and his life-long work to unite Lithuanians for the common good of the Lithuanian nation. Tumas was delegated to the Congress of the Peoples of Russia organized by the Ukrainian Central Rada in Kiev in September 1917. Lithuanians, represented by nine men, including Augustinas Voldemaras and Antanas Tumƒónas, were the only participating ethnic group to demand full independence. Upon return, together with Stasys ≈†ilingas and , he was sent to the Lithuanian Conference in Stockholm in October 1917. The conference approved the resolution adopted by the Vilnius Conference, recognized the Council of Lithuania as the legitimate representative of the Lithuanian nation, and reiterated Lithuania's desire for full independence. Tumas decided not to return to Russia, but instead travel back to Lithuania. The required paperwork took seven months and Tumas devoted most of his time to writing Pragiedruliai. =In independent Lithuania= Newspaper editor and political activities Tumas in 1928 wearing the cross of the Samogitian Capitulum and the Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas Tumas returned to Vilnius in May 1918. He started writing articles for Lietuvos aidas (Echo of Lithuania), eventually taking over as editor from Petras Klimas, and attending the sessions of the Council of Lithuania as a guest. At the outbreak of the Lithuanian‚ÄìSoviet War, many Lithuanian institutions evacuated to Kaunas but Tumas remained in the city. He was a member of the Lithuanian delegation to Vincas Kapsukas, leader of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic, in attempt to find a modus vivendi. Vaclovas Bir≈æi≈°ka, the Commissar of Education, supported Lithuanian activities and employed Tumas as a translator of educational books. Only one by was actually published. Tumas contracted typhus and was ill when Polish army captured Vilnius during the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War in April 1919. Upon recovery, he edited and helped publish ' (Independent Lithuania). In his articles, he harshly criticized the new Polish administration, in particular before it enforced censorship. Several of his articles attacked Polish priest Stanis≈Çaw Maciejewicz, a deputy of the Polish Legislative Sejm. Maciejewicz accused Tumas of libel and initiated a case in the ecclesiastical court of the Diocese of Vilnius, but later abandoned it. In early 1920, Antanas Smetona invited Tumas to Kaunas to become editor of Tauta (Nation) published by the Party of National Progress. He moved to Kaunas in March 1920 and ran in the elections to the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania. He visited five volosts and delivered eight speeches, but was not elected and largely withdrew from politics. He continued to support Antanas Smetona and the Lithuanian Nationalist Union for which he was frequently criticized by the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party. On 11 November 1923, during an intermission at the Kaunas City Theatre, Tumas publicly addressed Aleksandras Stulginskis, President of Lithuania, asking him to pardon Smetona, who at the time served a prison sentence for criticizing the government. The play was canceled and Tumas received a public reprimand from the bishop and a symbolic one-day house arrest for public disturbance from the Kaunas District Peace Court. Tumas submitted clemency requests on behalf of many others, including . Tumas joined the Lithuanian Riflemen's Union and became temporary editor of its magazine Trimitas. In January 1921, eleven older Lithuanian activists, including Kazys Grinius, Jonas Jablonskis, and Maironis, decided to publish an irregular publication with their memoirs of the Lithuanian National Revival and other articles on the history of Lithuania. Tumas became the editor of M≈´s≈≥ senovƒó (Our Past) and with funding from the Ministry of Education published five volumes (865 pages) in 1921‚Äì1922. It was the ninth and last publication edited by Tumas. However, he continued to contribute articles to numerous, including social democratic, newspapers. Church rector and university docent Tumas restored the Church of Vytautas the Great and was its rector from 1920 to 1933 In March 1920, Tumas also became rector of Church of Vytautas the Great. It was his ninth and last parish. The church, funded by the Grand Duke Vytautas, was devastated during World War I and needed extensive repairs. Tumas solicited donations, hired workers for repairs and artists Paulius Galaunƒó, Petras Kalpokas, for decoration. The church was reconsecrated on 15 August 1920 by Adomas Jak≈°tas, but repairs continued for years. It was not a parish church, but Tumas was often asked to perform weddings, baptisms, last rites. Many requested his services, because he was more lenient and accommodating. For example, in 1921, he wed poet at the break of dawn since dawn was a key symbol in Vaiƒçi≈´nas' poetry. In ten years, from 1920 to 1930, Tumas wed 1,375 couples. He resigned from the church due to poor health in January 1933 and delivered the last sermon on 16 February. Over the years, Tumas had collected information on Lithuanian writers and literature. In 1921‚Äì1922, he lectured on topics in Lithuanian literature at the Higher Officers' Courses and a teachers' courses. He was also invited to teach at the War School of Kaunas, but refused due to lack of time. Tumas was invited by Vincas Krƒóvƒó-Mickeviƒçius to teach at the newly established University of Lithuania. He started with a lecture on the poetry of Maironis in the fall 1922 semester. His lack of higher education was an obstacle and he was promoted to docent only in June 1924. He taught a course on the Lithuanian literature during the Lithuanian press ban (1864‚Äì1904). He chose to discuss different writers every semester instead of a more systematic chronological or thematic approach. He lectured not only on the well-known (such as Antanas Baranauskas or ≈Ωemaitƒó) but also on virtually forgotten authors. He retired from the university in March 1929 due to poor health (throat and lung issues made it difficult to speak for long periods of time). The university awarded him a pension and an honorary doctorate. He returned to the university for the spring 1932 semester when he taught a class on Lithuanian women writers. Other public work and death Tumas in his study in 1931 Tumas was instrumental in establishing a literary archive at the university that collected writers' manuscripts, correspondence, photos, etc. Tumas donated most of his personal collection to this archive, officially established in March 1923. In 1924‚Äì1926, Tumas worked as a reviewer of books and educational materials for the Ministry of Education. During that time he reviewed 66 works. He also contributed biographical articles to Lietuvi≈°koji enciklopedija, the first Lithuanian-language encyclopedia. Tumas frequently traveled across Lithuania and internationally, including to Italy in 1931 and to Latvia and Sweden in 1932. In addition to his paid jobs, Tumas was very active in Lithuanian cultural life ‚Äì he was chairman, treasurer, or board members of various Lithuanian societies, committees, and commissions, about 20 different organizations in total. He was a member of the Lithuanian Riflemen's Union and was awarded its Riflemen's Star. He was a member and, for a period, secretary of the Lithuanian Catholic Academy of Science and treasurer of the book publishing company Universitetas. In 1932, he was elected chairman of the Lithuanian Writers' Union. He actively supported and was elected as honorary member of , a nationalist student organization at the university, and was spiritual adviser to Young Lithuania, youth organization of the Lithuanian Nationalist Union. He received numerous visitors asking him for donations, loans, or personal recommendations. Despite all of these activities, he still found time to write works of fiction, though his ability to write longer works was impeded. In independent Lithuania, Tumas' efforts and works received official recognition. He was promoted as honorary canon of the Samogitian Capitulum in April 1921. He was awarded the Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas (2nd degree) on 15 May 1928, and the Order of Vytautas the Great (2nd degree) in 1932. He also received the Latvian Order of the Three Stars (2nd degree). Tumas supervised the construction of the villa of his nephew-in- law Petras Klimas in ƒÑ≈æuolynas and spent his last months there. In January 1933, Tumas was diagnosed with vitamin B12 deficiency anemia caused by colitis. In early March, he was diagnosed with bronchitis which grew into pneumonia. He spent the last week bedridden and died in the evening of 29 April 1933. He was buried at the Church of Vytautas the Great. His funeral, a grand public affair attended by many dignitaries, was a subject to one of the first documentaries produced in Lithuania. Works =Fiction= Last page of Tumas' last will dated 14 January 1933 Tumas began writing works of fiction in 1897. They were first published as a separate booklet Vaizdeliai (Scenes) in 1902. He signed by the pen name Vai≈ægantas, the name of a god of flax and hemp in the Lithuanian mythology mentioned by Jan ≈Åasicki. Until 1915, he wrote several cycles. Scenos vaizdai (Stage Scenes) was a cycle of plays poking fun at the shortcomings of the ordinary village folk (first published in 1906 and 1915). Auk≈°taiƒçi≈≥ vaizdeliai (Scenes of Auk≈°taiƒçiai) was a cycle of autobiographical short stories. Alegorij≈≥ vaizdai (Allegorical Scenes) included political and didactic stories (first published in 1916). Karo vaizdai (Scenes of War) were written during World War I and focused on the effects of war on the civilian population (first published in 1915). The best known story from this period is Rimai ir Nerimai (The Rimas and Nerimas Families), a tragicomedy depicting a comic rivalry between two families that is brought to an end by a common tragedy (their sons are mobilized into the Imperial Russian Army and killed in the war). He wrote the two-volume (first volume in two parts devoted to Samogitia, the second volume to Auk≈°taitija) epic novel Pragiedruliai (Cloud Clearing) in 1917‚Äì1920. It depicts the Lithuanian National Revival, social and economic transformation in rural Lithuania, and the resistance, sometimes subconscious, to the Tsarist regime by the ordinary villagers ‚Äì from improved agricultural methods to sending children to school, reading prohibited Lithuanian literature, and becoming interested in politics. The novel does not have a linear plot or structure. From separate scenes, pictures of nature, ethnographic descriptions of festivals or clothing, local legends and folktales, the novel builds a mosaic of the spiritual pulse of the nation ‚Äì its languishing memory of serfdom, spreading education, improving economic conditions, maturing political involvement, developing national consciousness. Lithuanians are depicted as one large family working towards the same goal. The novel has a large cast or characters, including Lithuanian peasants, industrious Jews, Polonized gentry, Russian administrators. The final scenes of Gondingos kra≈°tas depict a double marriage that contains borrowed elements from Pan Tadeusz by Adam Mickiewicz. Overall, it is a rather optimistic work that, while acknowledging painful setbacks and individual sacrifices, celebrates the cultural progress. While it is considered the best work of Tumas and was quickly added to school curriculum, not everyone praised it. For example, Liudas Gira considered it to be boring, confusing, and difficult to understand, particularly for the urban residents. After Lithuania's independence in 1918, Tumas' fiction turned from public to individual life. His novel Dƒódƒós ir dƒódienƒós (Uncles and Aunts), published in 1920‚Äì1921, explores three tragic lives. Mykoliukas, the younger son, sacrifices everything, including his love for Severija, for his elder brother and his family. He works the brother's farm essentially as a slave, earning nothing of his own, and is compared to Saint Isidore the Laborer. Severija marries Rapolas, an older man working as supervisor at a local manor. After the Emancipation reform of 1861, Rapolas loses his job and, unable to earn his own farm due to his laziness, moves in with his brother. He dies after accidentally eating rat poison. Severija works hard trying to earn her and her husband's keep at the unwelcoming home of her brother-in-law. After her husband's death, she is left all alone and starts abusing alcohol. The novel was adapted into a film, Tas prakeiktas nuolankumas (The Damn Submissive) in 1970. After his retirement from the University of Lithuania, Tumas was able to devote more time to fiction. Didactic novel ≈†eimos vƒó≈æiai (Tracks of a Family; 1929) looks into a family of Lithuanian intellectuals and their choices between an \\"empty\\" life of a cushy job and romantic love or a \\"meaningful\\" life of work for the Lithuanian nation. It was meant to become the third volume of Pragiedruliai. Short story I≈°gama (Freak; 1929) tells a true story from Tumas' childhood ‚Äì a boy who liked to daydream and maybe could have become an artist, but his father beat him and called him a freak for being different and not interested in farm work. The boy ran away from home and was killed trying to steal horses. Nebylys (Mute; 1930) deals with a love triangle that turns two childhood friends into rivals and enemies. It ends with the murder of one of the friends, katorga for the other, and insanity for their love interest. The story was adapted into a theater play in 1970 and a TV play in 1980. Tumas' last major work, ≈Ωemaiƒçi≈≥ Robinzonas (Samogitian Robinson; 1932), explores the life of Vincas, an energetic orphan who builds a prosperous farm with his own hands. But his family is infertile and he starts drinking alcohol. Vincas tries public work ‚Äì construction of a church and serving as a starshina of his volost ‚Äì to no avail. Unlike many other writers of the period, Tumas did not dwell on the heroic past (i.e. romantic nationalism) and instead focused on the present-day. His characters and plots were borrowed directly from his own experience or from witnesses. His characters often struggle with worldly passions (e.g. alcoholism, sexual desire, greed). Tumas, while depicting everyday life, expressed deeper romantic ideas and ideals. One of the key ideas is public service and hard work ‚Äì those who sacrifice their narrow self-interests and passions and diligently work for their families or the public good find meaning and salvation, while others fall to misery and degradation. Thus work becomes a greater moral virtue. The narrator, Tumas' alter ego, often interrupts the story to offer his emotional and expressive judgement or opinion. While Tumas considered himself to be a romantic writer, his works combine elements of various styles (romanticism and realism, fiction and non-fiction). His writing style is thick and heavy, verbose, full of Lithuanian folk motives and wit. He tried to use the standard Lithuanian instead of his native Auk≈°taitian dialect, but he freely coined neologisms and used dialects and loanwords when he wanted to be more expressive. His peculiar style is often described with the adjective vai≈æganti≈°kas. As a unique writer, Tumas is usually not discussed when discussing general trends in the Lithuanian literature but receives considerable critical attention. =Non-fiction= Tumas was a prolific writer. He edited and published 19 volumes of his collected works. Since 1994, the Institute of Lithuanian Literature and Folklore has been working on publishing his collected works. 24 volumes were published by 2015 with 30 volumes planned in total. He wrote on a variety of topics in various genres (e.g. editorials, feuilletons, reviews), often producing several articles day. He wrote more than 150 obituaries of Lithuanian priests alone. In total, Tumas contributed articles to more than 80 different periodicals. In addition, Tumas wrote thousands of letters, only 700‚Äì800 of which survive. Tumas worked on publishing various religious literature. In 1898, he translated and published a short and simple catechism by Roch Filochowski. In 1904, it was republished for the third time. He published a collection of sermons by priest Antanas Bortkeviƒçius in 1901 and a work on teetotalism by bishop Motiejus Valanƒçius in 1915. He translated, but did not publish, a textbook on the study of the Gospel of Mark by Baron . He also assisted Juozapas Skvireckas with the first full Bible translation into Lithuanian (raised funds, proofread manuscripts, wrote an introduction). In 1929, he translated and published two further works by Valanƒçius ‚Äì polemic writings on Eastern Orthodoxy and autobiography. From the early years, Tumas collected manuscripts and biographical data of various Lithuanian writers and whenever possible published them. For example, poetry of is known only from materials published by Tumas. He published obituaries and other biographical articles on Antanas Strazdas, Vincas Kudirka, Jonas Bili≈´nas, Kazimieras Jaunius, Maironis, and many others. These informal studies became impetus for his university career. His university lectures were published in various newspapers and magazines, eleven separate booklets in 1924‚Äì1925, and four- volumes in 1929. However, these studies were not systematic ‚Äì Tumas grouped topics haphazardly, without regard to chronology or author's style, covering some authors in detail while skipping others entirely. He focused on biographies and not on literary works. Since he knew or worked with many of them, he provided many irrelevant anecdotal stories. Tumas himself considered his lectures not a history of the Lithuanian literature, but only material for such history. In 1919, he published a travel book Aplink BaltijƒÖ (Around the Baltic Sea). It was based on articles he published promoting the idea of a federation with Latvia, Estonia, Sweden, or Finland. In 1925, he published Jaunam veikƒójui (To the Young Activist) with twenty essays on religious and public work. These essays could be classified as pastoral theology ‚Äì friendly, informal, practical advice from Tumas to young priests without citations to theological works or the Bible. Legacy Vai≈ægantas was known for encouraging younger authors and celebrating any accomplishments or signs of progress, and is sometimes referred to as \\"the diamond hunter\\" (deimanƒçiuk≈≥ ie≈°kotojas) even if some of those diamonds would quickly turn out to be simple gravel. He is remembered as an energetic activists who lived according to the motto \\"love and be loved\\". In 2016, Seimas (Lithuanian parliament) declared 2019 the year of Tumas (it will be his 150th birth anniversary). In April 1934, a year after Tumas' death, Vytautas Magnus University allotted three rooms to a museum dedicated to Tumas. This museum, directed by Vincas Mykolaitis-Putinas, preserved Tumas' archives, furniture, household items, and library of more than 2,000 volumes. When the university was closed in 1942, Mykolaitis-Putinas took some of the photos and manuscripts to Vilnius University and the rest were purchased by the Maironis Museum. The items were held in storage until 1997 when a museum dedicated to Tumas was established in the Kaunas apartment where he lived and worked from 1920 until 1933. It is visited by about 4,500 people annually. Prior to becoming a museum, the apartment was used as a clergy house and its last resident was Riƒçardas Mikutaviƒçius. Former granary in Ustronƒó, now a museum dedicated to Tumas and book smugglers In 1987‚Äì1991, a museum dedicated to Tumas and book smugglers was established in Ustronƒó, Panevƒó≈æys District Municipality. It occupies a former granary that was used by the Gar≈°viai Book Smuggling Society to hide illegal books. Tumas visited the granary while he worked in Vadaktƒóliai in 1902‚Äì1905. Monuments to Tumas were unveiled in Svƒódasai in 1937, in his native Malei≈°iai in 1989, and in Bir≈°tonas in 2016. The house where Tumas was born did not survive in its original location ‚Äì it was sold in 1914 and moved to the nearby Kalviai village. There have been suggestions of purchasing the surviving house, moving it back to Malei≈°iai, and establishing a memorial museum. He was a subject of several monographs, including by Aleksandras Merkelis (published in 1934, republished in 1955 and 1989) focusing on his biography and activities, by Aldona Vaitiek≈´nienƒó (1982) and Algimantas Radzeviƒçius (1987) focusing on his literary works, by Nijolƒó Lietuvninkaitƒó (2015) focusing on his personal library. A collection of his letters to the Klimai family was published in 1998; Aistƒó Kuƒçinskienƒó completed her PhD thesis on Tumas' letters in 2016. A book with memoirs and essays about Tumas was published in 2009 (editor Alfas Pakƒónas). In 1994, Kostas Ostrauskas published monodrama Vai≈ægantas. Over the next two decades it was performed by actor Ferdinandas Jak≈°ys over a thousand times. Schools named after Tumas are located in Roki≈°kis (1933‚Äì1958 and since 1989), Radvili≈°kis (since 1993), Svƒódasai (since 1989), Kaunas (since 1999). About 24 streets in Lithuania, 15 in cities and 9 in towns, are named in honor of Tumas, including central streets in Plungƒó and Tauragƒó. Since 1991, Svƒódasai hosts annual literary events at the end of September. Since 2002, during these events, the Lithuanian Writers' Union and the present a joint Juozas Tumas-Vai≈ægantas Award to writers that successfully combine and balance writing fiction and journalist work. On 20 September 2019, celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Juozas Tumas-Vai≈ægantas, a monument for him and his dog Kaukas was unveiled near the Church of Vytautas the Great in Kaunas, Lithuania.

It forms a superspecies with the Palearctic short-toed snake eagle Circaetus gallicus and the black-chested snake eagle Circaetus pectoralis. This bird seems to be declining in numbers and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated it as a \\"vulnerable species\\". Description The bird has a wingspan of . A large snake eagle with grey-brown upperparts, including the head and chest, contrasting with white underparts barred with brown and white vent. It has a black bill and large, bright yellow eyes with long pale grey, unfeathered legs. Juveniles are all dark. Behaviour Normally seen on a prominent perch such as a telegraph pole or dead tree, as it is a sit-and-wait hunter, rather than in flight but generally behaviour is poorly known. The diet mainly consists of snakes and other small vertebrates. It breeds in November to March in West Africa in a small stick nest at up to in the top of a tree. The clutch is usually a single egg. Incubation period is probably around 45 days with a fledging period which may be a further 70 days. Habitat Open woodlands, wooded savanna and cultivation. Distribution In a narrow band from Guinea-Bissau, Senegal and Gambia through southern Mali and Burkina Faso, Niger, northern Nigeria and Cameroon, southern Chad, Central African Republic and South Sudan. It has been recorded in Uganda but its status is uncertain in Kenya.BirdLife International (2013) Species factsheet: Circaetus beaudouini. Downloaded from on 20/10/2013 There may be some nomadic movements, it appears to move southwards during the dry season and northwards during the rains.Brown, Urban & Newman 1982 The Birds of Africa Volume 1, Academic Press Status This bird is nowhere common and has been little studied. The total population is thought to be between 3,500 and 15,000 individuals. It is threatened by the results of the rising human populations in the Sahel regions. This brings about more deforestation, increase in the area under cultivation and an associated increase in the use of pesticides, overgrazing, urbanization and increased hunting pressure. Raptors are seeing declines in their populations and this species appears to be decreasing in numbers and is categorised as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Taxonomic note Along with the black-chested snake eagle often treated as a subspecies of the short-toed eagle because of reports of mixed pairings and because Beaudouin's snake eagle is intermediate in plumage between short-toed eagle and black-chested snake-eagle. However, plumage differences are significant enough for all three to be currently regarded as three separate species within a single superspecies.

The number of students are over 5,000. There are classes from grade 1 to 13. 366x366px History Inspired by Guru Dev Rabindranath Tagore a great writer, artist and an educationist of India, and his university at Shanthi Niketan later called Visva Bharathi University, Mr. Wilmot A. Perera, a revolutionary educationist and a politician of Sri Lanka, decided to establish a similar institution in Ceylon, and invited Gurudev Tagore to lay the foundation stone for the institution, which Tagore named Sri Palee (place where the goddess of fine arts lives). This was laid on 20 May 1934, in Horana. At present, the principal, 140 academic staff and 20 non-academic staff operate at the college. The education medium is Sinhala and English medium is being introduced. English is taught as secondary language in all classes. Sri Palee is like any other government school in the island and subjects are taught according to the government curriculum. Science, mathematics and commerce streams are available at secondary educational level. College founder The founder of Sri Palee College was a proprietor planter - Mr. Wilmot A. Perera. His father was Abraham Perera who was known as the King of Rubber in Raigam and Pasdun Counties and was the richest person in the area as he got a massive income through rubber due to an agreement between a British company and him. Wilmot A. Perera was born on 12 June 1905. He was educated at Cyril Jansze College at Panadura and later at Royal College Colombo. He thought of studying archaeology, but after his father's demise he was compelled to look after his properties and became a planter. He became a successful planter and married Esme Perera Abeywardena, a lady from a wealthy family in Galle, and a grand daughter of the late Sir Charles Henry de Soysa, philanthropist. As a planter he had to mingle with labourers in estates and the people of the area. He could see the grievances of poor people and their struggle to live. He truly felt sorry for these people and made surveys to discover the reasons for their hardships. As a result of this effort he wrote the book Problems of Rural Ceylon. To find solutions for those problems he established for the first time a rural development society in Raigam Korale. He also believed in free education for the sons and daughters of the poor. To make all his ideas a reality he established Sri Palee College at Horana in Sri Lanka, based on the model of Shanthi Niketan in West Bengal, India. He was the first to start giving a midday meal to the pupils. As a Leftist, Wilmot Perera was involved in the \\"Suriyamal\\" movement during the World War II period and later became a Member of Parliament for the Matugama electorate in the 1st general election in 1947. He won the same electorate in 1952 as well. In 1957 he became the first Sri Lankan ambassador to China. He was the chairman of the Wilmot A. Perera Salaries commission. He died in 1973. Upasanaya/Assembly This is a tradition of the college. Students come for the assembly which is held in an open area with a small stage surrounded by large trees called Upasana Maluwa [assembly ground]. After the assembly pupils walk as Upasana Perahara [assembly procession] through the path around the Upasana Maluwa. In this Perahera four pupils walk in a row, singing the school anthem. At the end of the Upasana Perahera, students stop above the Upasana Maluwa, in front of the Nimaline Hall (school office) and sing the national anthem. After the national anthem they go to their classes.

It was named in the honor of Hephaistos, Greek god of metallurgy, whose cult was maintained on the island. It was once the capital of the island (8th to 6th centuries BCE), of which only the ruins remain. The Greek theater dates from between the late 5th and early 4th century BCE. It underwent reconstruction from 2000 to 2004, and in 2010 the first theater play (Sophocles' Oedipus Rex) was played after 2500 years. The theatre has capacity of 200 people in the main area, and additional 1000 outside. History According to the historian Herodotus, the cities of the island of Lemnos, Hephaestia and Myrina, were inhabited by Pelasgians. These Pelasgians had promised to return the island to the Athenians if on any occasion Athenian ships, pushed by the north winds, managed to arrive in less than nine days from Athens to the island. Many years later, the Athenians under Miltiades the Younger made the crossing in eight days. The Pelasgian inhabitants of Hephaestia left the island but those of Myrina resisted and were besieged until they surrendered, around the year 500 BCE. The town was recorded by later writers, including Pliny the Elder, Ptolemy, and Stephanus of Byzantium. Coins of Hephaestia survive. Discovery In August and September 1926, members of the Italian School of Archaeology at Athens conducted trial excavations on the island.A short account of their excavations appeared in the Messager d'Ath√®nes for January 3, 1927. The overall purpose of the excavations was to shed light on the island's \\"Etrusco-Pelasgian\\" civilization. The excavations were conducted on the site of the city of Hephaistia (i.e. Palaiopolis) where the Pelasgians, according to Herodotus, surrendered to Miltiades of Athens. There, a necropolis () was discovered, revealing bronze objects, pots, and over 130 ossuaries. The ossuaries contained distinctly male and female funeral ornaments. Male ossuaries contained knives and axes whereas female ossuaries contained earrings, bronze pins, necklaces, gold-diadems, and bracelets. The decorations on some of the gold objects contained spirals of Mycenaean origin, but had no Geometric forms. According to their ornamentation, the pots discovered at the site were from the Geometric period. However, the pots also preserved spirals indicative of Mycenaean art. The results of the excavations indicate that the Early Iron Age inhabitants of Lemnos could be a remnant of a Mycenaean population and, in addition, the earliest attested refer to Lemnos is the Mycenaean Greek ra-mi-ni-ja, \\"Lemnian woman\\", written in Linear B syllabic script.Palaeolexicon, Word study tool of ancient languages References External links * The Figure Stone of Hephaistia on Lemnos Ancient Greek archaeological sites in Greece Cities in ancient Greece Lemnos Buildings and structures in the North Aegean Theatres in Greece Populated places in the ancient Aegean islands Former populated places in Greece Ancient Lemnos ","title":"Hephaestia"},{"id":"13260152","text":"Sher-e-Jalandhar is a Premier Hockey league team based in Jalandhar, Punjab.

In addition, the museum gave lectures on the subject, and related subject matters, to the general public. Overseen by the Board of Trade, Department of Science and Art, the museum grew to challenge (in its areas of expertise) the previous monopolisers of scientific study and instruction in Ireland, Trinity College Dublin and the Royal Dublin Society. The museum had an education faculty of sorts which was divided into two separate institutions, and they were both largely dissimilar in their areas of academic focus. The abolition of the museum was recommended in 1862, with several parties claiming that it should be ultimately reorganised to be broader in scope, to encompass all areas of science related to agriculture and industry, rather than simply relating to the mining subject matter. As a result of this recommendation, the museum was abolished to make way for the Royal College of Science for Ireland, which was wider in sight. The document detailing and authenticating the abolishment of the museum was appointed in February 1866, and was signed in July of the same year.

By November 2006, it acquired four Serbian socially owned companies that were unproductive at the time: small kiosk retail chains \\"Duvan, \\"Politika prodaja\\", \\"Borba\\" and \\"Duvan promet\\". It was a result of joint enterprise of \\"EMI Denmark Holding\\" (majority owned by Serbian businessman Stanko Subotiƒá), \\"D Trade d.o.o.\\" and German media company WAZ- Mediengruppe. According to at the time CEO of the company Sretko Vukoviƒá, in 2006 \\"Futura plus\\" already had annual revenue of 105 million euros. Also, as of 2006, \\"Futura plus\\" had 1,200 kiosk retail stores and 15% market share for kiosk retail stores, which were mostly selling tobacco cigarettes, electronic payments and print newspapers. The first outlet store under brand \\"Minut2\\" was opened in January 2007, with a total of 20 operated stores nationally by August of the same year. In 2008, WAZ Media Group left \\"Futura Plus\\" immediately after the Serbian Prosecution raised accusations against Subotiƒá, selling its 50% of shares in ownership structure. By 2009, \\"Futura plus\\" became indebted company. On 4 June 2009, it minimized the distribution of the Veƒçernje Novosti daily by lowering the number of distributed copies to 2,240 copies from the usual 54,000 copies per day. This followed the decision of Novosti to appeal in court for the payment of Futura Plus's outstanding debt towards the editor. It was claimed that the outstanding 90-days past due debt towards the company reached 53 million Serbian dinars. At the same time, it was claimed that the total debt of Futura Plus to the Media Association of Serbia companies (including non-past due) was at 180-250 million Serbian dinars. The \\"Media Association of Serbia\\" made a decision to suspend all print media sales and halt the distribution of its editions to Futura Plus as of 14 September 2009. The decision was made jointly by Politika, Novosti, Ringier Srbija, Color Press Group, Press, Adria Media, Dnevnik and Ekonomist. The decision was reached after it was concluded that the company was endangering the activities of the print media in Serbia due to the considerable outstanding debt to the members of the association. On 12 November 2009, despite enormous debt of RSD 900 million, print newspapers of all mentioned companies returned to \\"Futura plus\\" distribution. =2011‚Äìpresent= In 2011, \\"Centro ≈°tampa Holding\\" acquired majority share in bankrupted \\"Futura plus\\" for 27.66 million euros.

He played for the in 2003, before moving to the in 2005 where he spent the bulk of his career. Career A native of the town of Bethlehem in the Free State province, Bismarck du Plessis made his debut for the Sharks in Super Rugby (then the Super 12) in 2005. As he plays hooker and played in the same team as South Africa's past captain, John Smit, for much of his career he had been a backup to Smit; however, this changed when Smit moved to tighthead prop. Before Smit's change of position, Du Plessis nonetheless played in Super Rugby and the Currie Cup whenever Smit was unavailable, and in 2007 was selected to play for South Africa in the Tri Nations Series. He made his debut for South Africa as a substitute in the same game against Australia in Sydney in which his older brother, Jannie, who was in the starting XV, also made his Springboks debut. The Du Plessis brothers became the 23rd set of brothers to earn caps for South Africa at rugby union. Following an illness to Pierre Spies, Bismarck du Plessis was called into South Africa's squad for the 2007 Rugby World Cup; his brother Jannie was a later addition to the squad, replacing BJ Botha, who injured a knee in South Africa's final pool match against the USA. During the 2008 end-of-year Test series, the Springboks moved Smit to tighthead in order to accommodate both him and the younger, faster Du Plessis in the front row together; this change has continued through the 2009 Super 14 season and into the Boks' 2009 Test season. After South Africa's second game of the 2008 Tri Nations Series, against New Zealand, Du Plessis was cited for an eye-gouge on New Zealand's Adam Thomson. At the subsequent disciplinary hearing, which was the first of his career, the judicial officer found that his action had been \\"careless\\", not deliberate, and imposed a three-week suspension, a significantly lower penalty than the three-to-six months' suspensions routinely imposed for deliberate eye-gouging. 2012-2015 Du Plessis was selected for the 2011 Rugby World Cup along with his brother Jannie. He came off the bench against Wales in which South Africa won 17-16. He then won a man of the match performance in June 2012 against England in the second test and also scored a try as the Springboks won 36-27 thanks to a late try from right winger JP Pietersen. During the 2013 Rugby Championship, Du Plessis received two yellow cards in a match against New Zealand and was then issued a red card. The IRB later admitted an error in one of the yellow cards. This red card was later overturned by the IRB and struck from Du Plessis' record.\\"Rugby Championship: Referee Romain Poite admits to yellow card error - ESPN Scrum\\".

He was a low-ranking samurai who was adopted by the Katsu family in order to marry the only Katsu daughter, Nobuko. Kokichi's father, Otani Heizo, was a minor official in the shogunate. His half brother, Otani Hikoshiro, was twenty-five years older than Kokichi. After their father's retirement as family head, Hikoshiro became responsible for all the family; he was a noted calligrapher and Confucian scholar and was twice distinguished as district administrator within the sh≈çgun's domain. By contrast, Katsu Kokichi led a life of idleness, never achieving an official post and supplementing his small (41 koku) income by dealing in swords, among other things. The other things, contrary to samurai-class ideals, included acting as a security guard and lending money at high interest. When Kokichi's son Rintaro (later to become the famous naval commander Katsu Kaish≈´) was fifteen, Kokichi retired as family head, passing on that duty to young Rintaro. During his last days, Kokichi wrote an autobiography (one of the few surviving from pre-Meiji Japan) titled Musui Dokugen (\\"Musui's Story\\"), narrating his life and adventures in a style much like that of the picaresque novel. This book is an excellent description of low life in Edo during the late Tokugawa shogunate. Katsu Kokichi died in Edo in 1850, three years before Commodore Matthew C. Perry reached Japan.

It was also called the Thesean Synoikismos and the Feast of Union, and celebrated Theseus as founder of Athens and the goddess Athena as the city's patron goddess. The festival was celebrated in the month of Hekatombeion on the 16th. A two-day festival, on the 15th and the 16th was held every second year. The name of the festival comes from the word synoecism (or synoikismos, Greek: œÉœÖŒΩ–æŒπŒ∫ŒπœÉŒºœåœÇ), which means the merging of smaller communities into one larger community. Athenian myth recorded two synoecisms: first the establishment by King Cecrops of the original twelve cities of Attica, and then merger of these twelve cities into a single Athenian state by the mythological King Theseus, with its political centre in Athens. The Synoikia festival celebrated this act of Theseus. During the festival, ewes and bullocks were sacrificed to Zeus Phratrios (of Brotherhood). The festival was organised and paid for by the phylobasileis, representatives of the original four Athenian tribes, which had otherwise fallen out of use after the reforms of Cleisthenes in 508 BC. After the Athenian victory over the Persians in the first Greco-Persian War and the subsequent rebuilding and resettling of the city-state, the Synoikia festival became even grander than before. Athena and Theseus, known as the \\"divine and heroic patrons\\" of the city, were glorified and worshipped more vigorously. These two figures became linked with one another, and rituals and rites that were once attributed to only one of these figures became intertwined between these two characters. Some ‚ÄúThesean elements [from] festivals‚Ä¶[were] infused with ceremonies belonging to [Athena, and vice versa]... even those not connected with the Synoikia.‚Äù In 374 BC, in honour of a short-lived armistice during the Boeotian War, the Athenians added a ‚Äúbloodless‚Äù sacrifice to Eirene, the goddess of peace. While this festival was celebrated by the Athenians, there were not many indications that showed that the other demes in Attica, outside of Athens, held Synoikia. This festival is not present in either the Marathonian and Erchian calendrical inscriptions ‚Äî where the Marathonian calendar was for the Marathon Tetrapolis (consisting of the demes Marathon, Oinoe, Probalinthos, and Trikorynthos), and the Erchian calendar was for the deme of Erchia.

On September 8, 2007, Vansteelant was hit by a car during training on his bike. He suffered a broken leg, facial injuries, a torn spleen and damage to lungs and heart. In the days after the accident, he seemed to recover well and was getting close to leaving the intensive care section of the hospital in Roeselare on September 13. But one day later, Vansteelant suffered a cardiac arrest. Despite receiving CPR in time, he died of a pulmonary embolism in the early morning. Vansteelant's achievements included World Junior title in 1997, ITU World standard distance (10 km-40 km-10 km) champion in 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004, ITU World long distance champion in 2000, 2001, 2005, 2006 and ETU European champion in 1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2007. In 2001 he won all three titles in the same season. Vansteelant also won the Powerman Duathlon World long distance (10 km-150 km-30 km) championship in 2005 and 2006. He was awarded the 'Sport Jewel of Flanders' in 2003, Flanders' highest honour to award a sportsman. Benny‚Äôs younger brother, Joerie, has continued the Vansteelant tradition and has also had considerable success in elite Duathlon, including four world titles.

Living Snakes of the World in Color. New York: Sterling Publishers. 480 pp. . Bothriechis aurifer is a venomous pit viper species found in Mexico and Guatemala. No subspecies are currently recognized. Description Adults generally grow to less than in length, but sometimes to over . The body is relatively slender with a prehensile tail. The scalation includes 1-5 intersupraocular scales, 8-12 supralabials, 9-13 infralabials and 18-21 (mode 19) rows of dorsal scales at midbody. The second supralabial is fused with the prelacunal to form a lacunolabial and the interrictals number 16-21. Males have 148-167 ventral scales and 58-64 subcaudals (mostly undivided), while females have 152-162 ventrals and 48-61 subcaudal scales. The color pattern consists of a green ground color overlaid dorsally with a series of yellow blotches that are bordered in black. Between the botches, an irregular, often broken, dorsal stripe can be seen. The yellowish green belly is often lighter than the dorsum. On the head, a dark postocular stripe is present. The iris is usually yellowish-green, sometimes bronze, with black specks or reticulations. Over 90% of all specimens have the usual dark dorsal pattern, but a few are uniform green and have no postocular stripes. The juvenile coloration includes a pale lime green ground color and a colorful tail tip. Geographic range Found in Mexico in the mountains of eastern Chiapas, and in northern Guatemala. Occurs in cloud forest at 1200‚Äì2300 m altitude. The type locality given is \\"Cob√°n, [Alta] Vera Paz, Guatemala.\\" Conservation status This species is classified as Vulnerable (VU) on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species with the following criteria: B1ab(iii,v) (v3.1, 2001). A species is listed as such when the best available evidence indicates that the extent of occurrence is estimated to be less than 20,000 km¬≤, the population to be severely fragmented or known to exist at no more than 10 locations, and that a continuing decline has been observed, inferred or projected in the area, extent and/or quality of habitat and in the number of mature individuals. It is therefore considered to be facing a high risk of extinction in the wild.

The MDO is both a religious order and an order of ministry (or in other words, an order of clerics regular). One distinctive feature of the Methodist ecclesiology is that a deacon has a permanent ministry and remains as a deacon ‚Äì it is not a transitional step toward becoming a presbyter. The diaconate is seen as an equal but offering something different from that of the presbyteral ministry. Currently the order reports to have about 280 deacons, who follow a common Rule of Life. History of the Order Wesleyan Deaconesses and the Wesley Deaconess Order were founded by the Rev. Thomas Bowman Stephenson in 1890. Deaconesses began to work overseas from 1894 following a request for a deaconess to serve in South Africa.Graham, D., Relations between the Wesley Deaconess Order and the Missionary Society, accessed 26 December 2016 The Conference of the Methodist Church of 1998 admitted all existing members of the Methodist Diaconal Order into Full Connexion.Constitutional Practice and Discipline of the Methodist Church [of Great Britain], 2016 Form of address Formerly, deaconesses were addressed as Sister, but since the admission of men to the order, and once it became an order of ministry as well as a religious order, all members are now officially titled \\"Deacon\\". The term \\"deaconess\\" is no longer used. Habit There is no formal habit or uniform for a Methodist deacon: some deacons may decide to wear what is regarded as ‚Äòtraditional dress‚Äô for the MDO ‚Äì a navy blue suit and a white shirt of blouse, particularly for formal occasions, while others may feel that they would prefer to wear the polo shirts and sweat shirts commissioned by the MDO particularly if the circumstances are less formal. Deacons are permitted to wear clerical shirts; however, these must be navy blue or white and deacons must wear the diaconal order badge they were presented with at their Ordination. Deacons are presented with a pectoral cross at their ordination. The cross of the MDO is an important identifier for Methodist deacons.

Britain had been at war with France for a decade and was on the brink of losing the Napoleonic Wars, when Barbauld presented her readers with her shocking Juvenalian satire. She argued that the British empire was waning and the American empire was waxing. It is to America that Britain‚Äôs wealth and fame will now go, she contended, and Britain will become nothing but an empty ruin. She tied this decline directly to Britain‚Äôs participation in the Napoleonic Wars: :And think‚Äôst thou, Britain, still to sit at ease, :An island Queen amidst thy subject seas, :While the vext billows, in their distant roar, :But soothe thy slumbers, and but kiss thy shore? :To sport in wars, while danger keeps aloof, :Thy grassy turf unbruised by hostile hoof? :So sing thy flatterers; but, Britain, know, :Thou who hast shared the guilt must share the woe. :Nor distant is the hour; low murmurs spread, :And whispered fears, creating what they dread; :Ruin, as with an earthquake shock, is here (lines 39‚Äì49) This pessimistic view of the future was, not surprisingly, poorly received; \\"reviews, whether in liberal or conservative magazines, ranged from cautious to patronizingly negative to outrageously abusive.\\"McCarthy and Kraft, 160. Barbauld, stunned by the reaction, retreated from the public eye; in fact, she never published another work within her lifetime. Even when Britain was on the verge of winning the war, Barbauld could not be joyous. She wrote to a friend: \\"I do not know how to rejoice at this victory, splendid as it is, over Buonaparte [sic], when I consider the horrible waste of life, the mass of misery, which such gigantic combats must occasion.\\"Qtd. in Le Breton, 132. Everard Green noted that \\"In her own time, the idea that the United States ‚Äì then still mainly reckoned a minor and peripheral power ‚Äì would one day eclipse the mighty British Empire was greeted with scorn. Indeed, at the time when the poem was written, Britain was yet to reach its zenith as a world power. Yet what Barbauld predicted did come to pass, though very much later - not due to the Napoleonic Wars, but due to the Second World War.\\"Dr. Everard Green, Prophets Who Look in Distant Mirrors, pp. 79‚Äì80 See also *Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction Notes Bibliography *Le Breton, Anna Letitia.

Biography Ayhan I≈üƒ±k was born Ayhan I≈üƒ±yan on 5 May 1929 in the Konak district of ƒ∞zmir. He was the youngest of six children. He lost his father when he was just six years old. In his posthumously published memoirs, I≈üƒ±k described his father as follows: \\"The most significant thing I remember about him is the way he smelled. I loved his hugging me before I went to bed. Once he took me fishing and carried me on his back on our way home since I was exhausted. That is all I can remember about him. I have always tried to force myself to remember more of him; unfortunately I couldn't.\\" He attended school in ƒ∞zmir and Istanbul, where they moved after I≈üƒ±k's elder brother attended university. He liked going to school. He once noted that his teachers in high school included such significant writers of Turkish literature as Mahir ƒ∞z, Salah Birsel and Rƒ±fat Ilgaz. He was a sociable boy and made many friends in Istanbul. Some of his friends from school became important individuals as well. After high school, I≈üƒ±k attended the painting department of the State Fine Arts Academy. He was a good painter and he joined a group of young painters who called themselves \\"The Ten,\\" since they were then fellow painters. Their goal was to create a synthesis of Eastern and Western values in the medium of painting while one of their secondary intentions was to make close contact with the art of the common man, a goal he would achieve later as an actor. I≈üƒ±k took first place in the contest, and his film career began. He first played the leading role in a historical film called \\"Yavuz Sultan Selim ve Yeni√ßeri Hasan\\" (Selim I and Janissary Hasan) directed by Orhan Murat Arƒ±burnu. After that, I≈üƒ±k met √ñmer L√ºtfi Akad and the two made a film series called \\"ƒ∞ngiliz Kemal\\" (English Kemal), which was an action thriller. In 1952, Akad directed a very significant film called \\"Kanun Namƒ±na\\" (In the Name of the Law), in which I≈üƒ±k played the leading role mutually with G√ºlistan G√ºzey, the femme fatale of Turkish cinema in the 1950s. The film was an extraordinary drama about ordinary people, which brought the film great success. People loved the film, but they loved the young leading actor, Ayhan I≈üƒ±k, more. Film after film, year after year, I≈üƒ±k's fame grew. People wanted to see him. Osman Seden, his producer at that time, says that I≈üƒ±k began working in the films produced by Seden for TL 1,000 in the early 1950s, while he would be paid TL 100,000 in the early 1960s. However, Ayhan I≈üƒ±k was not satisfied with his lot and visited many countries including Italy and Iran in order to find new possibilities and contacts to market Turkish films. Though paid at the highest level in Turkey, I≈üƒ±k's average fee for a hit film was less than one-10th of the fee paid to a leading actor in the U.S. The film Bitter Life, directed by Metin Erksan, was a second triumph for I≈üƒ±k. This was again a dramatic and bloody love story, which would become a trademark for I≈üƒ±k's movies. Star- cinema loves actor-actress pairings. Though I≈üƒ±k worked with most of the best leading actresses of his time, his films with Belgin Doruk occupy a special place. People adored both as if they were a real and perfect couple. The \\"K√º√ß√ºkhanƒ±m\\" (Mademoiselle) film series was the outcome of this pairing and all were box-office hits. The pair made 11 films in a row. Akad and some film critics said that I≈üƒ±k's best role was in the \\"K√º√ß√ºkhanƒ±m\\" series, which were romantic comedy films. I≈üƒ±k's films with T√ºrkan ≈ûoray provided a different kind of pairing. The two worked together in \\"Acƒ± Hayat,\\" 1962 and \\"Otob√ºs Yolcularƒ±\\" (Bus Passengers), 1961. Neither had a happy ending and both were realistic. \\"Otob√ºs Yolcularƒ±\\" was a political thriller while \\"Bitter Life\\" was a social drama. Death I≈üƒ±k died in 1979 at the age of 50, which shocked his family, friends and fans. He was known for his disciplined and calm living free from any scandals. He lived a kingly life as much as the social and economic conditions of the filmmaking business allowed him to, and died as \\"the king without a crown,\\" as the press used to call him.

Laid down as M13, she was named after the French field marshal of the Napoleonic Wars Michel Ney. After service in the First World War, she became a depot ship and then an accommodation ship. Between 1922 and 1947, she was renamed three times, becoming successively Vivid, Drake and Alaunia II. She was broken up in 1957. Design Designed for inshore operations along the sandbank-strewn Belgian coastline, Marshal Ney was equipped with two massive naval guns. Originally, these guns were to have been stripped from one of the battlecruisers and after they were redesigned. However, the guns were not ready, and guns intended for the battleship were used instead. The diesel engines used by the Marshal Ney-class ships were a constant source of technical difficulty, hampering their use. Marshal Ney in particular was‚Äîin the words of Jane's Fighting Ships‚Äî\\"practically a failure\\", on account of her MAN diesel engines being so unreliable. A contemporary description of the engines by Admiral Reginald Bacon, commander of the Dover Patrol from April 1915, shows how fault-prone they were: :\\" Reliability both in officer and a ship is the first thing that an Admiral values. The Marshal Ney, judged by this standard, was a hopeless sinner; but her officers and men made up for her deficiencies. Her engines not infrequently exploded when asked to start; her engine-room was scarred as if by shrapnel from the fragments of burst cylinder heads, and the escapes of the engine-room staff were miraculous. Her Chief Engineer, Mr. Swan, stuck to the engines like a Trojan and almost overcame their bad habits; and really, when talking to him, you were almost converted to the opinion that just one little alteration would make them start next time the ship was required. Added to this, when they did not burst, they usually would not start, and when once started no one liked to stop them for fear of not being able to start them again. But, without exaggeration, the more they burst and the worse they behaved, the more Mr. Swan loved them and the more cheery Captain [Hugh J.] Tweedie became.\\" Service Assigned to the Dover Patrol, Marshal Ney served with her sister ship . Following her poor sea trials and continued poor operational performance off the Belgian coast, it was decided to remove her 15 inch guns and place them in the hull of a new monitor. Her 15 inch turret was removed at Elswick in January 1916, where it was re-engineered to fire up to an increased angle of 30 degrees. The turret was then shipped to Belfast and fitted to . Terror would soon launch, and join the Dover Patrol together with her sister, . Marshal Ney was then rearmed with a single gun and four guns, all of which had been taken from . However, another refit in 1916 to 1917 saw the 9.2 inch gun removed for use ashore in France. In the large gun's place her 6 inch armament was increased to six BL 6-inch Mk XI naval guns, which had been removed from . After her refit, Ney was relegated for service as a moored guardship at The Downs. She engaged German destroyers during a raid on Ramsgate in April 1917. During 1919, Marshal Ney was used as a base ship at Queenborough, before being disarmed and becoming a depot ship at Fort Blockhouse from 1920. Renamed Vivid in July 1922, she then served as an accommodation ship for the stoker training section at Devonport, where she remained until 1957. She was again renamed Drake in January 1934, and Alaunia II in 1947. Fate She arrived at Thos W Ward's shipyard at Milford Haven on 6 October 1957 for breaking up.

It is a subspecies of the silvereye (Zosterops lateralis), though sometimes considered a full species. It is endemic to Lord Howe Island in the Tasman Sea, part of New South Wales, Australia. Description The Lord Howe silvereye is sometimes treated as a full species. It differs from the nominate subspecies by being more robust, with larger feet and claws, a longer and heavier bill, with much olive-green on flanks, rump and lower back, and with canary yellow under-tail coverts.Hindwood, p.72.Schodde & Mason, p.688. Distribution and habitat The Lord Howe silvereye is restricted to Lord Howe Island, where it widely distributed through the native subtropical rainforest as well as around homes and gardens.Schodde & Mason, p.688.Hutton. Behaviour =Breeding= The bird builds a small cup-shaped nest of palm fibre, grass and spider webs, in which it lays a clutch of 2-4 small eggs in spring and summer.Hutton. =Feeding= The silvereyes glean insects from leaves and flowers, as well as eating small seeds, nectar and fruits, particularly guava and will come into gardens and houses, in which people may feed them mince meat and food scraps. Status and conservation The population of the Lord Howe silvereye has been estimated at about 5,000 breeding birds and stable. It is considered Vulnerable because of the restricted size of the population and area of its distribution.Garnett & Crowley, pp.608 and 633.

It depicts the daily life of a fictitious Italian daily newspaper Il Giornale (The Journal). The newspaper caters to a conservative, fascist, borgeouis public and its chief- editor Bizanti tries in all manners to give a right-wing slant even to the most trivial news items, while at the same time edulcorating and desensitizing the thornier issues, such as unemployment, police brutality and so on. The whole editorial staff is thrown in a tantrum when a young girl is found raped and killed, going as far as soliciting death penalty nostalgias (capital punishment has been abolished in Italy since the fall of Fascism) and to actually derail the investigation leading the police to a false culprit: a young left-wing student which becomes the \\"ideal\\" scapegoat for the newspaper's prejudiced readership.

The Venomous Reptiles of the Western Hemisphere. 2 volumes. Ithaca and London: Comstock Publishing Associates. 870 pp. 1,500 plates. . Bothriechis rowleyi is a species of pit viper, a venomous snake in the subfamily Crotalinae of the family Viperidae. The species is endemic to Mexico. There are no subspecies that are recognized as being valid. Etymology The specific name, rowleyi, is in honor of American ornithologist John Stuart Rowley, who was one of the collectors of the holotype.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Bothriechis rowleyi, p. 228). Description Bothriechis rowleyi is slender and green with a prehensile tail. Adults grow to a total length (including tail) of at least Geographic range Bothriechis rowleyi is found in Mexico in southeastern Oaxaca and northern Chiapas. It occurs in cloud forests at altitude. The type locality given is \\"a ridge that extends northward from Rancho Vicente, Colonia Rodolfo Figueroa, approximately 5 miles west of Cerro Ba√∫l. The site is at an elevation of approximately , on the headwaters of the R√≠o Grijalva, roughly to the north and slightly to the east of San Pedero Tap√°natepec, in the Distrito de Juchit√°n, Oaxaca, Mexico.\\" Conservation status The species B. rowleyi is classified as Vulnerable (VU) on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species with the following criteria: B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii) (v3.1, 2001). A species is listed as such when the best available evidence indicates that the extent of occurrence is estimated to be less than , that estimates indicate the population to be severely fragmented or known to exist at no more than 10 locations, and that a continuing decline has been observed, inferred or projected, in the area, extent and/or quality of habitat. In addition, the area of occupancy is estimated to be less than . It is therefore considered to be facing a high risk of extinction in the wild.

It can be thought of as a real analogue of Hilbert's Nullstellensatz (which concern complex zeros of polynomial ideals), and this is this analogy that is at the origin of its name. It was proved by French mathematician and then rediscovered by the Canadian .

(Unlike , the \\"weak\\" form actually includes the \\"strong\\" form as a special case, so the terminology is a misnomer.)  Variants  The Krivine‚ÄìStengle Positivstellensatz also has the following refinements under additional assumptions. It should be remarked that Schm√ºdgen‚Äôs Positivstellensatz has a weaker assumption than Putinar‚Äôs Positivstellensatz, but the conclusion is also weaker. = Schm√ºdgen's Positivstellensatz = Suppose that R = \\\\mathbb{R}.

The store, founded in 1811 by Samuel Chappell as a store to commercialise Chappell & Co. pianos, nowadays commercialises a wide range of instruments including pianos, guitars, drums, brass, woodwinds, and bowed.  History  The musical instrument shop has been trading in London since 1811, when the original company, Chappell & Co., was founded. Chappell & Co. also published music, but in 1980 Chappell's piano manufacturing and retail business was sold to Kemble & Company who then continued to run the premises under the same name \\"Chappell of Bond Street\\". The publishing business of Chappell Music was later taken over by Warner Brothers becoming Warner Chappell Music. The Bond Street premises were completely refurbished in 1986 to mark the 175th year of trading. Kemble & Company, a family business, commenced building pianos in the early 1900s and developed into Britain's largest piano manufacturers, moving to a modern factory in Bletchley, Milton Keynes. In 1966 Kemble & Company became distributors for Yamaha electronic organs. As Yamaha became dominant in other product areas a joint venture company, Yamaha-Kemble Music (UK) Ltd, was set further to develop sales in the U.K. market of Yamaha pianos, electronic keyboards, guitars and hi-tech equipment. In July 2007 the minority Kemble family shareholding was bought out by Yamaha Corporation and the company was renamed \\"Yamaha Music (U.K.) Ltd\\" in autumn of 2007.Yamaha buys out Kemble family , MI Pro, July 10, 2007Cancellation of Joint Venture Contracts for Sales Subsidiaries in U.K. and Spain , Yamaha Global website, July 10, 2007 In 2010, Yamaha Music (U.K.) Ltd merged with Yamaha Music Europe GmbH; hence \\"Yamaha Music London\\" was established as Yamaha Music's own retail store and, as the only retail store owned and operated by Yamaha outside Japan, it is the European flagship store for Yamaha Music.Terms, Policies and procedures, Yamahamusiclondon.com In November 2006, the then Chappell of Bond Street store closed the 50, New Bond Street shop for the final time, reopening on November 11, 2006 at 152-160 Wardour Street. The new building is Grade II listed and has three retail floors. Although Yamaha (in its various guises) has owned the business since 1980, the store continued to use the Chappell name partly because the two biggest areas of the business ‚Äìsheet music and acoustic pianos‚Äì were so strongly associated with the name. However, in 2015, the company decided to place more emphasis upon the expansive selection of Yamaha musical instruments it carries, hence the decision to use the globally-known name \\"Yamaha\\" was made and the Chappell of Bond Street name retired.
