It was Moshfegh's debut. Originally published by Fence Books, it was reissued by Penguin Books in 2019.  Development  In an interview with The White Review, Moshfegh talked about her experience with writing McGlue: \\"McGlue was really a creative act of writing through spiritual possession. I mean, I wasn‚Äôt intellectualizing, I wasn‚Äôt thinking about plot. McGlue came out of me like some magical demon. And when that was over it was like, ‚ÄòOh, thank God.‚Äô  Plot  It's 1851. McGlue, a sailor, wakes up to find himself chained down in the hold of the boat he works on. He is too drunk to remember what happened, but everyone is saying he murdered Johnson. This doesn't make sense to McGlue, Johnson was his friend and he has no memory of killing him. But he does have a history of drinking too much and getting violent. Weeks, possibly even months, pass and McGlue's inebriation is replaced by agonizing withdrawals. In his disorientation he recalls the history of his friendship with Johnson and gradually recalls the events of the night he supposedly murdered him.  Literary significance and reception  A review in the Los Angeles Review of Books wrote, \\"Ottessa Moshfegh‚Äôs first novel reads like the swashbuckled spray of a slit throat ‚Äî immediate, visceral, frank, unforgiving, violent, and grotesquely beautiful.\\" It was selected by Rivka Galchen as the inaugural Fence Modern Prize in Prose. Discussing her choice, Galchen said this of McGlue, \\"A sextant of the psyche, McGlue works its grand knowing through the mouthfeel of language; it‚Äôs a sharply intelligent, beautiful, and singular novel. A scion of Nathaniel Hawthorne and Raymond Carver at once, Moshfegh transforms a poison into an intoxicant.‚Äù Novelist Brian Evenson said, \\"Here is the story of one man‚Äôs pursuit of self-destruction and his friend who drowns in his wake, brilliantly and desperately conveyed.

The Mughal general Asaf Khan I launched the attack with the permission of Akbar and easily defeated the Rani's forces, which could not withstand advanced Mughal artillery, at the Battle of Damoh. The Rani committed suicide during the battle and the young prince Vir Narayan died in action during the Siege of Chouragarh. The women trapped in the siege committed jauhar before Asaf Khan could take the fortress. Afterwards, Asaf Khan retained most of the spoils, including 800 of the thousand captured war elephants and many precious metals, for himself. He presented 200 war elephants to Akbar at Jaunpur on 13 July 1565, but soon feared retribution by the finance minister Muzaffar Khan and fled on 17 September 1565 to Ilahabad Subah.

After being expelled from Parliament in February 1769 following his election as MP for Middlesex in the 1768 general election, Radical journalist John Wilkes was repeatedly re-elected as MP for Middlesex in a series of three by-elections in February, March, and April 1769, with Parliament voiding each result. After the April by-election, the only one in which Wilkes's re-election had been contested, Parliament ordered the returns amended to transfer the seat to his defeated rival, Henry Luttrell. The events sparked a national controversy on Wilkes and the broader issue of democracy in Britain. By-elections of 1769 Radical journalist John Wilkes was elected MP for Middlesex, in modern Greater London, on an anti-government platform in the 1768 general election, but he was expelled from Parliament on 3 February 1769 on the basis that he had been an outlaw at the time of his election. A by-election was consequently held in Middlesex on 16 February, which resulted in Wilkes's re-election unopposed. Parliament voided the result, taking the view that his previous conduct rendered him unfit for office. Wilkes was then re-elected unopposed a second time on 16 March. The process was repeated, with Parliament voiding the March result and a third by-election being held on 13 April. This time, the government found a candidate to oppose Wilkes in the shape of Henry Luttrell, an Irish soldier who was a personal enemy of his. Two additional candidates also registered on this occasion: William Whitaker, a lawyer connected to the Rockingham Whigs, and David Roache, another Irishman. In the event, Wilkes defeated Luttrell by a margin of 1,143 votes to 296. =Table of results= =Amendment of returns= Upon Wilkes's third re- election, the House of Commons voided the result on 14 April after a contentious debate, and by a majority of 221 to 139 the following day ordered the returns to be amended to show Luttrell the victor. On 29 April, a petition by the freeholders of Middlesex was presented to the House stating that Luttrell could not sit as their representative \\"without manifest infringement of [their] rights and privileges\\". In response, Parliament's decision was reaffirmed by a motion on 8 May. Supporters of the motion argued that it was the freeholders who were attempting an injury by imposing an unsuitable person on the House, and \\"that those who obstinately and wilfully persevere in voting for an unqualified person, are to be considered as not voting at all\\". A subsequent petition was addressed to King George III on 24 May. Aftermath and significance Though Luttrell retained his seat for the next five years, the controversy raised Wilkes's political profile considerably. Edmund Burke, political philosopher and MP for Wendover at the time, described the affair as a \\"tragi-comedy acted by 'His Majesty's servants', at the desire of several 'persons of quality', for the benefit of Mr. Wilkes and at the expense of the Constitution\\". The Society of Gentlemen Supporters of the Bill of Rights was formed in February 1769 to support Wilkes after his first expulsion, and led a national petition campaign that garnered 60,000 signatures at a time when the total electorate numbered around 250,000. He was elected an alderman of the City of London, and then became Lord Mayor of London in 1774 before winning Middlesex again at the following general election that year. In 1782, the House of Commons finally expunged the orders and resolutions relating to the Middlesex affair from its records. The Middlesex controversy helped to promote democratic ideals in Britain. Supporters of Wilkes adopted general demands that included the exclusion of placemen from the Commons, yearly or triennial parliaments, and fair and equal representation. Wilkes's election campaign in April saw popular demonstrations in London, including a procession along Pall Mall. His organisation also developed the tactic of asking for pledges from sympathetic Members of Parliament and coordinating their votes, a practice that sparked a debate on the role of Members of Parliament relative to their electors.

He was an early exponent of the ecological approach to natural history recording. Early life Woodruffe- Peacock, always known by his middle name of Adrian, was born at Bottesford Manor, north Lincolnshire, on 23 July 1858, the son of Edward Peacock (1831‚Äì1915), farmer, antiquarian, historian, and author, and his wife, Lucy Ann Wetherell (1823‚Äì1887). He had 6 siblings. He was schooled at Edinburgh Academy (1870‚Äì73) and St Peter's School, York (1873). He then received private tuition in Lincolnshire until April 1877, when he was admitted to St John's College, Cambridge, to study mathematics, classics, science, and natural history. Shortage of money, poor health, and the decision to become an Anglican clergyman cut short his stay there. In 1879 he transferred to Bishop Hatfield's Hall at Durham University. At Durham, he indulged in extensive botanising, boating, and tennis; his social life being so time-consuming that there were complaints he regarded the university as a private club. He sat for the degree examination at Easter 1881, but \\"scratched\\", thinking that he had failed his Latin paper and choosing to make arrangements to leave before receiving the results. However, this did not affect his career as he had already obtained his licentiate of theology in December 1880, and was subsequently ordained deacon in December 1881, and then priest in December 1883. Following university he held curacies at Long Benton, Northumberland (1881‚Äì84); Barkingside, Essex (1884‚Äì85); Long Benton (1885‚Äì86); and finally at Harrington, Northamptonshire (1886‚Äì90). Ecology In 1891 he accepted the living at Cadney, 10 miles from his birthplace, where he stayed until 1920 and developed a reputation as a naturalist. This was a poor, sparsely populated parish; since Woodruffe-Peacock had to visit his widely scattered parishioners on foot, he became by inclination and necessity a tremendous walker, which afforded him the opportunity to make regular observations and to record the natural changes occurring over a limited area. His profile in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography notes that his routes contained some of the best observed and documented habitats in the country. Woodruffe-Peacock compiled a Critical Catalogue of Lincolnshire Plants (1894‚Äì1900), superseded by his Check-List of Lincolnshire Plants (1909), allegedly based on an analysis of half a million observations. He took a leading role in the foundation of the Lincolnshire Naturalists' Union in 1893, serving as organizing secretary in 1895 and president in 1905. He was the prime mover in establishing a museum for Lincolnshire, his extensive herbarium forming an integral part of its original collections and the foundation of the city and county museum's herbarium. He was elected a fellow of both the Linnean Society and the Geological Society in 1895. Among his achievements was the pioneering of the small-scale ecological survey. He also appreciated the mechanisms of dispersal, a neglected aspect of British ecology, which he approached through the careful study of microhabitats. As the result of \\"half a dozen visits\\" to a Lincolnshire beck during a dry summer when the water was low, he noted over 58 species growing, coming from the seeds he had dispersed by the stream. He was also a pioneer in plotting the distribution of plants. As early as 1894 he had 20,000 \\"place notes\\" on the distribution of plant species tabulated in his \\"Locality Register\\". He published an article, \\"A fox-covert study\\" in the Journal of Ecology, recently founded by botanist Arthur Tansley. The two eventually met on a field trip to Mildenhall in Suffolk and, surprisingly, since Tansley was an avowed atheist, became close friends. By this point Woodruffe-Peacock had been working on a detailed study, Rock-soil flora of Lincolnshire, for many years, and Tansley, impressed, offered to contribute ¬£300 towards its publication. Owing to poor health, Woodruffe-Peacock was never able to make the necessary revisions and only a small section was ever published, the rest of the manuscript passing into the archives of Cambridge University Library. According to Brian J. Ford, these extensive notes show him to be ahead of his time in his approach to natural history. Personal Woodruffe-Peacock was tall and broad in proportion, but his health did not match up to his stature: most of his life he suffered from chronic hay fever and rheumatism. In 1920, by now Rector of Grayingham, he suffered an emotional setback when his sister Mabel died. A combination of this, the pressures of his new appointment, and the disappointment of his magnum opus requiring so many revisions, saw his health break down. He died on 3 February 1922 and was buried in an unmarked grave beside his sister.

The pass was called the Newhall Pass, before the new pass was built. The Pass was designated a California Historical Landmark (No. 1006) on May 11, 1992. The cut provided a route in the pass between the San Gabriel Mountains and the Santa Susana Mountains ranges. It is located near the current interchange of the Interstate 5 and California State Route 14.californiahistoricallandmarks.com, Beale's Cut Stagecoach Pass The steep pass was made easier to cross with a deep slot-like road cut by Charles H. Brindley, Andr√©s Pico, and James R. Vineyard, to whom the State of California awarded a twenty-year contract to maintain the turnpike and collect tolls. Thus, the \\"San Fernando Mountain,\\" the most daunting obstacle along the Fort Tejon Road, the main inland route from Los Angeles to the north, was cut through. Butterfield Overland Mail, a stagecoach that operated mail between St. Louis, Missouri, and San Francisco, began using it directly. In 1861 a landowner and surveyor named Edward Beale was appointed by President Abraham Lincoln as the federal Surveyor General of California and Nevada. Beale challenged General Pico's loyalty to the new president and in 1863, Beale was awarded the right to collect the toll in the pass. Beale maintained rights to the cut for the next twenty years and so it became known as \\"Beale's Cut.\\" Beale used Chinese immigrants to do most of the work on the cut. Work was completed in 1863, but the LA Board of Supervisors accepted it as complete on March 5, 1864. The cut had major damage in the winter of 1861‚Äì62 and wagons could not get through the pass. In March 1862 soldiers under the command of Major Theodore Coult of the Fifth California Volunteer Infantry, repaired the cut and road. The Fifth California Volunteer Infantry headquarters were Camp Latham, California. The soldiers repaired the cut as ammunition wagons could not get to Fort Yuma, Arizona.Official Records of the War of the Rebellion, Washington, D.C., Government Printing Office, 1897LA Herald on March 5, 1862 Beale's Cut was eventually deepened to . It lasted as a transportation passage near present-day Newhall Pass until the Newhall Tunnel opened in 1910.elsmerecanyon.com, Beale's Cut Stagecoach Pass Beale's Cut appeared in many silent western movies. The location became a favorite of movie producers like John Ford and D. W. Griffith. In Ford's 1923 film Three Jumps Ahead, American cowboy star Tom Mix is filmed jumping over the pass, although it has been widely debated among film historians whether Mix himself made the jump, with any of a number of stuntmen claiming credit for it while some experts believe the jump was achieved purely through special effects. John Ford used the location in at least four films over a twenty-year period beginning as early as 1917. Beale's Cut Stagecoach Pass in 1870s Beale's Cut in 2003 Still in existence today, it is no longer passable by automobiles. It suffered a partial collapse during the Northridge Earthquake, on January 17, 1994, and now is about deep. It is visible from the Sierra Highway about one mile north from the intersection of The Old Road and Sierra Highway, just after the first bridge under SR 14. It lies between Sierra Highway and the new freeway, about a quarter-mile to the northeast of a stone marker. Beale's Cut is difficult to find today because it is fenced off and not close enough to the Sierra Highway to be easily seen. The pass originally discovered in August 1769 by Catalan explorer Gaspar de Portol√†, the pass today is named for Henry Newhall, a businessman in the area during the 19th century. In 1910 the Newhall Auto Tunnel was built a quarter-mile northwest of Beale's Cut. The tunnel was wide and two-way traffic through it was slow. The California Division of Highways decided to replace the tunnel; in July 1938 work started to remove the rock above the tunnel to create a four-lane highway. The road was first known as US Highway 6, then state Highway 14, and finally the present-day Sierra Highway. The cut for the tunnel is west of today's Highway 14.

While it considered invoking an option to opt out of its broadcast television contracts in 2017, the PGA Tour ultimately decided against doing so. Golf Channel (which, since the acquisition of NBC Universal by Golf Channel owner Comcast, is a division of NBC Sports) has served as the pay television rightsholder of the PGA Tour since 2007, and its current contract will also expire in 2021. Under the contracts, CBS broadcasts weekend coverage for an average of 20 events per-season, and NBC broadcasts weekend coverage for an average of 10 events per-season. Golf Channel broadcasts early-round and weekend morning coverage of all events, as well as weekend coverage of events not broadcast on terrestrial television, and primetime encores of all events. Tournaments typically featured in NBC's package include marquee events such as The Players Championship, the final three tournaments of the FedEx Cup Playoffs, and the biennial Presidents Cup event. The 2011 contract granted more extensive digital rights, as well as the ability for NBC to broadcast supplemental coverage of events on Golf Channel during its broadcast windows. Historical breakdown =1950s= NBC first began televising golf events after it was awarded the television rights to the U.S. Open in 1954. The tournament continued to air on NBC through the 1965 event, however NBC rebuffed a long-term deal to broadcast the event when the United States Golf Association (USGA) decided on a true contract in 1966. The network, however, did televise a handful of PGA Tour events over the following decades. For example, NBC's broadcast of the 1962 Tournament of Champions as the first color golf telecast. Five years later, NBC broadcast the Hawaiian Open Golf Tournament, which was the first live color sports transmission from Hawaii to the U.S. mainland. In the United Kingdom, the Open Championship was historically broadcast by the BBC‚Äîa relationship which lasted from 1955 to 2015. The BBC's rights to the Open had been threatened by the event's removal from Category A of Ofcom's \\"listed\\" events, a status which legally mandated that the Open be broadcast in its entirety by a terrestrial broadcaster. It had since been moved to Category B, meaning that television rights to the tournament could now be acquired by a pay television outlet, such as BT Sport or Sky Sports, as long as rights to broadcast a highlights programme are given to one of the main terrestrial broadcasters. CBS has televised the Masters Tournament in the United States every year since 1956, when it used six cameras and covered only the final four holes. While Augusta National Golf Club has consistently chosen CBS as its U.S. broadcast partner, it has done so on successive one-year contracts. Due to the lack of long-term contractual security, as well as the club's limited dependence on broadcast rights fees (owing to its affluent membership), it is widely held that CBS allows Augusta National greater control over the content of the broadcast, or at least perform some form of self-censorship, in order to maintain future rights. The club, however, has insisted it does not make any demands with respect to the content of the broadcast. There are some controversial aspects to this relationship. Announcers refer to the gallery as \\"patrons\\" rather than spectators or fans (\\"gallery\\" itself is also used), and use the term \\"second cut\\" instead of \\"rough\\" (however, the second cut is normally substantially shorter than comparable \\"primary rough\\" at other courses). Announcers who have been deemed not to have acted with the decorum expected by the club have been removed, notably Jack Whitaker and analyst Gary McCord. Whitaker referred to the gallery at the end of the 18-hole Monday playoff in 1966 as a \\"mob\\" and missed five years (1967‚Äì1971); McCord last worked on the Masters telecast in 1994, being banned that summer after using the terms \\"bikini wax\\" and \\"body bags\\" in his descriptions. There also tends to be a lack of discussion of any controversy involving Augusta National, such as the 2003 Martha Burk protests. However, there have not been many other major issues in recent years. Frank Chirkinian was known as the 'father of televised golf' for the impact he had on golf broadcasting. He came to the attention of CBS after he impressed with his direction of the 1958 PGA Championship. Recruited by the network, who had no one with expertise in the relatively new field of golf broadcasting, he went on to be executive producer of CBS's golf coverage from 1959 to 1996. During his time at CBS, he was nicknamed \\"The Ayatollah\\" for his brusque, uncompromising approach to directing broadcasts. Chirkinian was particularly well regarded for the coverage of the Masters Tournament that he oversaw for four decades, working closely with the management of Augusta National to ensure they were satisfied. Following his retirement, he remained a consultant to CBS for golf coverage. =1960s= ABC broadcast golf events for the first time in 1962 when it began televising the Open Championship as part of its anthology series Wide World of Sports. The network later gained the broadcast rights to the PGA Championship in 1965, and the U.S. Open in 1966. Chris Schenkel and Byron Nelson were the initial hosts of the tournament coverage. =1970s= Beginning in the mid-1970s, ABC Sports used Barry White's \\"Love's Theme\\" as the opening theme music for its live golf telecasts; this theme was finally retired midway through 1997 with the reorganization of ABC's golf coverage. A new generic sports theme was used through the broadcasts from 1997 to 1999; however, a distinct separate theme would close the broadcasts. From the WGC event at the end of 1999 through the 2003 season, another theme was introduced which was more authoritative and heroic in style than the previous theme. The closing music from 1997 was retained to close the broadcasts during this period. Additionally, the network's coverage of The Open Championship used its own distinct theme during this period. In 1975, Jim McKay and Dave Marr became the lead broadcast team on ABC, while Bob Rosburg joined the network as the first ever on-course reporter, and Peter Alliss joined as a co- anchor. =1980s= Beginning in 1982, ABC adopted its most well-known format of the Wide World of Sports era. The broadcast operated using anchor teams, in which an anchor and an analyst would call all of the action from the tower at the 18th hole, and the teams would be rotated on coverage after about a half- hour. Meanwhile, the three on-course reporters, which included Judy Rankin and Ed Sneed in addition to Rosburg, would be utilized when prompted by the anchor team. McKay and Marr would be the lead team, with Jack Whitaker and Alliss as the second team. Occasionally, Rosburg or Whitaker would host if McKay was unavailable, while Roger Twibell would take over the secondary team. After his 1986 Masters win, Jack Nicklaus would appear on ABC after the end of his round and served as an analyst for the rest of the telecast. Nicklaus held his position of entering the booth during the major championship telecasts through the period from 1992 to 1996. The USA Network began first and second round Masters coverage in 1982, Ratings For Each Round of The Masters Since '82 (First/Second Rounds Since '99) which was also produced by the CBS production team. This was the first ever cable coverage for one of the golf majors. Initially, the USA Network provided Thursday and Friday coverage for 2 hours live each day along with a prime time replay. On August 9, 1982, ABC purchased a 10% stake in the Entertainment and Sports Programming Network (ESPN) for $20 million; in exchange for the interest, ESPN gained the U.S. television rights to the British Open, which ABC had not been able to broadcast in its entirety. The purchase provided ABC the option of purchasing additional shares of up to 49% under certain conditions, which included the option to purchase at least 10% of Getty Oil's shares in the channel prior to January 2, 1984. In 1983, NBC televised the first Skins Game ever held, with Vin Scully and Ben Crenshaw serving as announcers for the tournament broadcast. From 1983 to 1989, Scully juggled duties for both golf and Major League Baseball telecasts for NBC, usually teaming with Lee Trevino. The only notable affiliate not to televise the first event was KYW-TV (now a CBS owned-and-operated station) in Philadelphia. In 1991, coverage of the Skins Game moved to ABC Sports, after NBC obtained the rights to broadcast Notre Dame college football games. After Vin Scully left NBC Sports following the network's loss of the Major League Baseball package to CBS, Bryant Gumbel, who was still co-hosting Today at the time, took over as NBC's primary golf anchor. In the United States, the Ryder Cup was first televised live at the 1983 matches in Florida, with ABC Sports covering just the final four holes of the singles matches. A highlight package of the 1985 singles matches was produced by ESPN, but no live coverage aired from England. In 1987, with the matches back in the United States, ABC covered both weekend days, but only in the late afternoon. Also in 1987, ABC provided approximately 2¬Ω hours of tournament coverage each on Saturday as well as Sunday. The network also previously covered the Sunday singles of the Ryder Cup in 1975 (with Jim McKay as the lead commentator) and 1979. In 1989, USA Network began a long association with the Ryder Cup, by televising all three days live from England, the first live coverage of a Ryder Cup from Europe. This led to a one-year deal for the 1991 matches in South Carolina to be carried by NBC live on the weekend, with USA Network continuing to provide live coverage of the first day. All five sessions were broadcast for the first time. The success of the 1991 matches led to a contract extension with USA and NBC through 1997, marking a turning point in the competition's popularity. For the European matches, the first two days were taped and aired on delay in the U.S. Another extension with USA and NBC covering the 1999‚Äì2003 (later moved to 2004) competitions increased the number of hours of coverage to include the entire first day and most of the second day. Tape delay was still employed for competitions from Europe. =1990s= In 1990, Roger Twibell took over as ABC's lead anchor, with Dave Marr as his analyst. Peter Alliss became sole anchor of the second anchor team. During this period, ABC acquired the rights to several non-major PGA Tour events, mostly important events such as The Memorial Tournament and The Tour Championship. 1990 would also mark the final PGA Championship to be broadcast by ABC. The American Century Celebrity Golf Classic was held in 1990 and sponsored by NBC, which broadcasts the second- and third-round coverage. The game NBC Sports Real Golf was unveiled at the 17th annual American Century Championship Celebrity Golf Event and promoted during NBC's broadcast of the event. NBC generally televised around five regular PGA Tour events per season at this time. In 1991, the network acquired the broadcast rights to the Ryder Cup. In 1991, NBC replaced Bryant Gumbel with Charlie Jones as their primary golf anchor and subsequently, Dick Enberg and (after the former left NBC Sports for CBS in the year 2000) Dan Hicks. When TBS took over the cable package for the PGA Championship in 1991, they increased the weekday coverage to 6 hours per day. TBS also added 2 hours of Saturday and Sunday coverage. Because inclement weather stopped play during the third round of 2012 PGA Championship on Saturday, TNT added coverage starting at 8a.m. ET on Sunday. For the 1991 PGA Championship, Bob Neal and Bobby Clampett anchored the TBS coverage. TBS also used golf instructor David Leadbetter, former LPGA player Donna Caponi, and NFL analyst Pat Haden for the 1991 PGA Championship coverage. For the 1992 PGA Championship, TBS installed Leadbetter as its lead analyst. Gary Bender and MLB analyst Don Sutton were also part of the TBS crew. In 1992, Brent Musburger, who had been heavily criticized for his hosting of golf coverage while with CBS, took over as ABC's host. Marr was dismissed from the network, while Twibell was reassigned to ESPN's golf coverage, although he occasionally hosted on ABC for a few lower- level tournaments. The format was also reorganized to more emphasize the on- course reporters. Steve Melnyk moved over from CBS to become lead analyst; however, Alliss would anchor for stretches during the telecast. Beyond the team in the booth, all of ABC's other voices were on the course, including Rankin, Rosburg and newcomer Mark Rolfing. In 1993, ABC used Peter Jacobsen as lead analyst; however, Jacobsen returned to playing in 1994 and Melnyk returned to the lead analyst position. The final round of the 1994 Masters was the final on-air assignment for Pat Summerall on CBS Sports. CBS had lost the rights to the National Football Conference to Fox (where Summerall and his broadcasting colleague, John Madden would soon move over to) prior to the 1994 NFL season. But much like Vin Scully did in 1982 after calling his final NFL game (the NFC Championship Game between the San Francisco 49ers and Dallas Cowboys), Pat Summerall stayed at CBS a couple more months so he could make the 1994 Masters his final broadcast for CBS, where he was a mainstay for over 30 years. CBS covered the first three Presidents Cups (1994, 1996 and 1998). Beginning in 2000, the American broadcast television rights moved over to NBC, who has held it ever since. On the weekday cable side, ESPN like CBS covered the first three President Cup. TNT then carried the Presidents Cup from 2000 to 2007; Golf Channel assumed those rights beginning with the 2009 event as part of its overall deal for PGA Tour cable rights. In 1995, USA expanded their Thursday/Friday Masters coverage to 2.5 hours each day. Also in 1995, NBC Sports acquired rights to the USGA championships, including the U.S. Open, from ESPN/ABC. ESPN retained rights to a portion of the weekday coverage, however, NBC was the dominant rights holder, including exclusive coverage of the weekend rounds. This took NBC's coverage to a new level and marked the first time in the modern era of television that the network had televised a major championship. NBC, the Yanni composed theme music, \\"In Celebration of Man\\", and its lead analyst Johnny Miller (who joined NBC in 1990) became synonymous with the U.S. Open, televising it for the next 20 years, through 2014. Beginning with the 1995 PGA Championship, Ernie Johnson, Jr. became the primary golf anchor for Turner. Dave Marr served as the lead analyst for TBS during their 1995 PGA Championship coverage. By the 1996 PGA Championship, Bobby Clampett once again assumed the lead Turner analyst role. Also for the 1996 PGA Championship, former LPGA player Mary Bryan moved over from CBS to join the TBS team. In May 1997, right after Tiger Woods won his first Masters, the PGA Tour announced a $400 million, four-year broadcasting sgreement for 1999-2002 with NBC, ABC, CBS, ESPN, USA and the Golf Channel.The PGA TOur's new television contract brings the green into play - Leonard Shapiro, 25 May 1997, The Washington Post On November 1, 1997, during the third round of the 1997 Tour Championship, ABC employees staged a one-day boycott after an employee was disciplined for drawing an obscene cartoon of Walt Disney Company chairman Michael Eisner (Disney had purchased ABC two years prior). ABC showed final round coverage of the 1996 Tour Championship in the broadcast window. After facing much criticism for its golf coverage, especially Jack Nicklaus' involvement and Brent Musburger's perceived lack of knowledge of the game, ABC decided to completely overhaul its visual presentation, becoming more in line with cable partner ESPN, while changing the format for its coverage to be more of the standard in line with the other networks, featuring a lead anchor team, announcers assigned to individual holes, and on-course reporters. Mike Tirico became the host, with Curtis Strange serving as lead analyst. Steve Melnyk, Peter Alliss and Ian Baker-Finch became hole announcers, while Bob Rosburg, Judy Rankin and Rolfing were the primary on-course reporters. To compensate the extra telecasts, ABC added several members to its broadcasting team. Rolfing left to return to NBC and was replaced by Billy Ray Brown. Gary Smith and Mark McCumber (who had worked for the network part-time in 1998) also joined as on-course reporters. Strange and Tirico worked every event, however the other members of the on-air broadcast team generally took weeks off, appearing on certain events. McCumber left ABC after 1999, followed by Smith after 2002; Rosburg began to drastically cut his schedule in 2003. Melnyk became an on-course reporter for the 2003 Tour broadcasts, replacing Smith. Brandel Chamblee replaced Melnyk as a hole announcer. Fox Sports partnered with Greg Norman in the early 1990s to create a world golf tour, which would have consisted of six events televised on Fox. However, PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem threatened to suspend any player participating in the events, and as a result created the World Golf Championships events, which were televised by CBS and ABC. Fox Sports bid for a portion of the television rights starting in 1999, but the PGA Tour declined the offer. Fox Sports Net served as a simulcast outlet for The Golf Channel's early round telecasts from 1999‚Äì2002. The Golf Channel had limited carriage, and FSN expanded the viewing audience, however the telecasts were complete Golf Channel telecasts and made no reference to Fox. From 1999 to 2002 and 2004 to 2006, ABC broadcast the Bob Hope Classic. CBS covered the Bob Hope Classic in 2003 due to ABC holding the broadcast rights to Super Bowl XXXVII, which overlapped with the tournament. Prior to 2007, USA Network and ESPN/ABC consistently covered all four courses used for the event, with the primary camera crew covering PGA West, although live coverage still emanated from the other courses. However, when Golf Channel took over the broadcast rights to the tournament, the network only assigned live coverage to PGA West (both the Palmer and Nicklaus courses). All other courses used did not receive live coverage at all, with the channel providingh only an hourly highlights package of each day's action from those courses. This has been the approach consistently taken by Golf Channel in regards to tournaments with multiple courses, including the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am and the Walt Disney World Golf Classic. Meanwhile, from 1999 to 2005, ABC broadcast Monday Night Golf, a series of seven match play golf challenge events, each of which involved #1 ranked World Golfer Tiger Woods. It marked the first time that a live golf event had been shown in prime time during the week in the United States. Monday Night Golf proved to be an initial success, drawing more viewers than the final round of the U.S. Open, and being second only to the final round of the Masters Tournament in terms of golf broadcasts. Ratings increased significantly for the second match, but declined rapidly for subsequent matches, and the event was finally discontinued after the 2005 edition. =2000s= In July 2001, the PGA TOur announced a four-year television contract for 2003-2006 estimated in $850 million.PGA agrees to $850-million television deal Larry Stewart, Los Angeles Times, 17 July 2001 Beginning in 2004, TNT as well as CBS, began broadcasting the PGA Championship in HDTV. In 2003 and 2004, both CBS and USA televised the Masters commercial-free. Bob Rosburg retired after 2003, while Steve Melnyk and Brandel Chamblee left ABC. Ian Baker-Finch and Peter Alliss remained hole announcers in 2004, while ESPN's Andy North joined Brown and Rankin as an on- course reporter. Strange left ABC Sports in June 2004 due to a contract dispute, and was replaced as lead analyst for the rest of the season mostly by Baker-Finch, who also served as lead analyst for ESPN during this time. For the rest of the season, ABC had several active PGA players substitute as analysts alongside Baker-Finch, including Hal Sutton and Fred Couples. Nick Faldo worked The Open Championship and caught the eye of ABC producers. When TNT took over the American cable package for the Open in 2003, they started providing 2 hours of early morning coverage on both weekend days prior to the start of ABC's air-time. During the 2006 Open Championship, Mike Tirico filled in for Ernie Johnson, Jr., who was undergoing chemotherapy. Tirico was also hosting ABC's coverage that week, leading to 11-hour shifts for him. In the past, TNT owned cable rights to the (British) Open Championship, as well as the Women's British Open and Senior British Open, from 2003 to 2009 (with ABC picking up weekend coverage), replacing (and ultimately being replaced by) ESPN. TNT also carried the biennial PGA Tour-managed Presidents Cup from 2000 to 2007; Golf Channel assumed those rights beginning with the 2009 event as part of its overall deal for PGA Tour cable rights. It was announced before the 2004 Tour Championship that Nick Faldo and Paul Azinger would become the lead analysts for ABC's tour coverage starting at the 2004 Tour Championship. The two, whose pairing was met with wide praise and acclaim by critics, had formerly been playing rivals and had gone head-to-head in both The Open Championship and the Ryder Cup. With Faldo and Azinger on board, Baker-Finch was moved back to being a hole announcer. The rest of the team remained intact, with the addition of Terry Gannon as an occasional host or hole announcer. In the spring of 2006, Judy Rankin was diagnosed with breast cancer, resulting in ESPN's Bill Kratzert replacing her as an on-course reporter while she sought treatment. In 2004, ABC cut away from the final round of the Buick Classic PGA Tour golf tournament at 7:00 p.m. Eastern and Central Time Zones to show a rerun of America's Funniest Home Videos. Three players were involved in a sudden-death shootout when ABC signed off from its coverage. The shootout round was seen on ABC stations on the West Coast until the end of the match. Since 2004, all of CBS's golf broadcasts outside of the Masters have featured super slow motion video of golfers' shots from a super slow motion camera used for swing analysis by Peter Kostis. The camera was known as \\"CBS Swing Vision\\" during its first year; it gained sponsorship from Konica Minolta the next season, an arrangement that has lasted over a decade. The feature was known as the \\"Konica Minolta SwingVision camera\\" in 2005, the \\"Bizhub SwingVision camera\\" from 2006 to 2008, and the \\"Konica Minolta Bizhub SwingVision camera\\" since 2009. The camera is actually provided by Tech Imaging Services, not Konica Minolta, which merely sponsors the feature to promote its Bizhub line of printers (Konica Minolta was previously well known as a still-image camera manufacturer but sold that product line to Sony in 2006). The cameras are present and used at the Masters, however they are not branded or sponsored. In 2005, CBS broadcast the tournament with high- definition fixed and handheld wired cameras, as well as standard-definition wireless handheld cameras. Meanwhile, USA increased the Thursday/Friday coverage to 3 hours. In January 2006, the PGA Tour announced a new set of television deals covering 2007 to 2012, increase the number of events covered by NBC Sports from five to ten. The deal also renewed broadcast deals for the Ryder Cup and the USGA Championships, including the U.S. Open. NBC is the only network which provide four days of major tournament coverage (CBS, which airs the Masters and the PGA Championship, only provides weekend coverage of its tournaments; starting in 2010, the Open Championship would not be aired live on a major broadcast network at all, with all four rounds airing on ESPN and ABC providing only edited highlights of the event). NBC carried the weekend coverage of the JELD-WEN Tradition in 2007, 2009 and 2010. Golf Channel covered the early rounds (and all four rounds in 2008 while NBC carried the Summer Olympic Games from Beijing). NBC carried a tape delayed broadcast of the World Series of Golf, which was held from May 13 to 16, 2007, on June 23 and 24 of that year; the 2008 event of the series, played from May 12 to 15, and was televised by CBS on June 28 and 29. Also in early 2006, it was announced that both ESPN and ABC would lose their respective television rights to the PGA Tour after that season. Mike Tirico was given the position as lead announcer for Monday Night Football; he left the golf team following the Deutsche Bank Championship in September. Gannon took over as lead host for the remainder of ABC's final season. Coinciding with the network's coverage of the Deutsche Bank event, ABC Sports was rebranded as ESPN on ABC as part of the cable channel's increased oversight of the network's sports division, with ESPN graphics being used on the ABC telecasts. Prior to 2007, ESPN and ABC shared some announcers, but the main ABC coverage team did not generally work on ESPN except for events that ABC had weekend rights to, in which case the full ABC team would work on ESPN's weekday telecasts. After losing PGA Tour rights following the 2006 season, what remained of ESPN and ABC's coverage team's merged, as did the production, with all ABC broadcasts being branded as ESPN broadcasts as part of ESPN on ABC. In 2007, CBS added \\"Masters Extra,\\" an hour's extra full-field bonus coverage daily on the internet, preceding the television broadcasts. In 2008, CBS added full coverage of holes 15 and 16 live on the web. The 2007 Masters was also the final event for USA Sports, which was dissolved into parent NBC Sports after the tournament. All future sports telecasts on USA would use NBC's graphics and personalities. Also in 2007, ESPN and ABC covered just the first two rounds of the US Open and the final two rounds of the Open Championship. Ian Baker-Finch and Nick Faldo both moved to CBS, while Billy Ray Brown moved to the Golf Channel. Andy North, Bill Kratzert and a fully healthy Judy Rankin became the on-course reporters for both ESPN and ABC. For the ABC telecasts of the Open, the 2006 booth team made a special return, including CBS's Faldo. Alliss and Terry Gannon served as hole announcers for the telecast. Meanwhile, The Shark Shootout was moved to December, and was broadcast live by both Golf Channel and NBC. The event was originally broadcast in the United States by sister cable channel USA Network, and CBS ‚Äì with USA broadcasting the first round on a tape-delayed basis, and CBS handling the second round live. The final round was not broadcast live to the entire country, as CBS' commitment to the NFL only allowed the round as it took place to air in the Eastern and Central Time Zones, with the rest of the U.S. seeing the event beginning at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time. In 2008, ESPN reorganized its golf coverage, obtaining the broadcast rights to The Masters from USA; all tournament coverage on both ESPN and ABC was identical, with the exception of the Masters telecasts, which were produced by CBS. Additionally, ABC telecasts did not use the experimental top- screen scoring banner that was used on ESPN's telecasts used in 2008 and 2009. Nick Faldo did not return as an announcer and was not replaced; Mike Tirico and Paul Azinger became the lead booth announcers. Curtis Strange returned to the network, joining Gannon and Tom Weiskopf as a hole announcer. North, Rankin and Kratzert remained on-course reporters; Alliss became an analyst for holes that Gannon was assigned to. ABC's final live telecast was the 2009 Open Championship, in which Tom Watson nearly won the championship at the age of 59. Watson had worked for ABC as a guest analyst at the previous year's Open and had been scheduled to do so again. =2010s= ESPN moved all live golf coverage to cable in 2010, with ABC being relegated to carrying a three-hour encore presentation of the day's Open Championship rounds starting at 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time. ESPN reorganized the broadcast team for its coverage that year with several additions and changes, however Mike Tirico and Paul Azinger remained the lead announcers through the end of ESPN's coverage of golf in 2015. In 2013, NBC reached a deal to extend its rights to the Ryder Cup and Senior PGA Championship through 2030, with Friday coverage of the Ryder Cup being assumed by Golf Channel. The Ryder Cup contract, which stipulated cable coverage air on USA, was still controlled by NBC even after it granted ESPN the rights to Friday cable coverage (normally the only day of the event covered on cable). However, in 2010, rain on Friday pushed the singles matches to Monday, necessitating that they air on cable. With NBC having granted only Friday rights to ESPN, the singles matches aired on USA, which would be the final golf telecast for the network. Four months later, NBC merged with Golf Channel, making Golf Channel NBC's primary cable outlet for golf. On August 6, 2013, Fox Sports announced a 12-year deal to broadcast the three open championships of the USGA: the U.S. Open, Women's Open, and Senior Open, beginning in 2015. Fox succeeded the USGA's long-term relationships with NBC Sports and ESPN. Fox, which has televised just one PGA Tour sanctioned event in its history (the unofficial CVS Charity Classic in 2011), paid $1 billion for full rights to all USGA championships. The Fox network airs the final two days of the U.S. Open, Women's Open, Senior Open, and Amateur, as well as late coverage of the first two days of the U.S. Open. The rest of the coverage airs on Fox Sports 1. Also, the final two days of the U.S. Open air on Spanish- language channel Fox Deportes.http://www.usga.org/articles/2015/02/fox-sports- announces-2015-usga-championship-broadcast-schedule-21474878643.html - 4 February 2015 On April 23, 2014, Fox Sports announced that Greg Norman would join Joe Buck as its lead golf commentary team. Buck and Norman worked together for the first time at the 2014 U.S. Open, where Fox produced studio programming that aired against ESPN and NBC's studio shows. In June 2015, the Fox family covered the U.S. Open for the first time, from Chambers Bay in University Place, Washington, southwest of Tacoma. Fox Sports 1 aired preview programming hosted by Holly Sonders on the Tuesday and Wednesday prior to the championship. On June 8, 2015, it was announced that NBC Sports had acquired rights to The Open Championship beginning in 2017 under a 12-year deal; after former broadcaster ESPN opted out of the final year of rights, NBC began coverage in 2016 instead. Early round coverage is aired by Golf Channel, which marked the first time ever that Golf Channel had ever broadcast one of the four Men's major golf championships. On May 3, 2016, NBC announced that Golf Channel would air the bulk of the men's and women's golf tournaments for the 2016 Summer Olympics, covering up to 300 hours of the tourney, with 130 of those hours live. Mike Tirico made his on-air debut with NBC during the 2016 Open Championship. The 2015 edition of the U.S. Open had a total of 38.5 hours of coverage in the United States, with 22 hours being on Thursday and Friday, and 16.5 hours being on Saturday and Sunday; the Fox Sports 1 cable network had a total of 16 hours of coverage on Thursday and Friday. The Fox broadcast network had a total of 22.5 hours of coverage Thursday through Sunday, with six hours Thursday and Friday, and 16.5 hours Saturday and Sunday. Fox utilized a number of new technologies during its production, including drone flyovers, a camera-equipped RC car for ground perspectives, and new graphics‚Äîincluding a live shot tracer, an augmented reality display of green contours, and a persistent top-5 leaderboard displayed in the bottom-right of the screen. Later in December 2015, ESPN returned live golf to ABC with the announcement that the final round of the CME Group Tour Championship on the LPGA Tour would be broadcast on the network. A scaled down version of the ESPN/ABC crew worked the event. ABC broadcast this event until 2018, as NBC took over their coverage the following year. In Australia, from 2015 Fox Sports Australia is the exclusive broadcaster of the U.S. Open until 2018. In January 2016, Greg Norman was let go by Fox in response to poor reception towards his performance during the U.S. Open and was replaced by former ESPN analyst Paul Azinger. The network's 2016 U.S. Open team: For the 2016 season, ESPN's golf production team disbanded, as Masters coverage was produced by CBS with CBS announcers. Also in January 2016, former CBS analyst David Feherty joined NBC to become a full-time contributor for its coverage and Golf Channel. Feherty already hosted a self-titled series for Golf Channel. Long- time ESPN personality Mike Tirico made his on-air debut with NBC during the 2016 Open Championship. NBC and Golf Channel broadcast the revived golf tournaments at the 2016 Summer Olympics, as part of NBC Olympic coverage. NBC staff served as the host broadcaster for the golf events on behalf of Olympic Broadcasting Services (OBS). The 2016 Ryder Cup was also televised in the United States NBC (along with Golf Channel), which planned to provide 170 hours of coverage. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the event was broadcast by Sky Sports; the broadcaster re-branded its Sky Sports 4 channel as Sky Sports Ryder Cup for the week of the event, and planned to broadcast 240 hours of coverage. Beginning in 2016, Sky Sports will have exclusive UK rights to The Open with the BBC showing a 2-hour highlights programme every night instead of live coverage. Sky's major event coverage is fronted by David Livingstone, expert analysis from Butch Harmon, on course commentary from Howard Clark, in-depth 18th hole interviews from tour coach and golfing expert, Tim Barter and main commentary from Ewen Murray and Bruce Critchley. Other golfers such as Peter Oosterhuis, Tony Johnstone, Thomas Bj√∏rn, David Howell, Richard Boxall, Jamie Spence, Mark Roe, Robert Lee, Ross McFarlane, Sandy Lyle, Colin Montgomerie, Paul McGinley, Philip Parkin and Ken Brown contributing to their coverage over the years. For the 2018 U.S. Open, Fox announced that they would be splitting their lead commentary booths into two teams. This was done in an effort to avoid the occasional logjam caused by a three-man booth, which had been Joe Buck with analysts Paul Azinger and Brad Faxon. Therefore, Azinger would now be paired with Buck, and Faxon would be paired alongside Shane Bacon. On October 10, 2018, it was announced that ESPN would replace TNT as the PGA Championship's cable partner beginning in 2020, with CBS remaining broadcast television rightsholder. This deal left TNT without any golf coverage. =2020s= In 2020, NBC renewed its rights to the PGA Tour through 2030 under an eight-year deal beginning in 2022. While NBC will still air an average of 8 tournaments per-year, coverage of the final three FedEx Cup playoff events will now alternate between CBS and NBC. On June 29, 2020, it was announced that Fox had withdrawn from its contract to carry USGA tournaments, and had sold the remaining seven years of the contract to NBC Sports through 2027. This was reported that the rescheduling of the professional championships caused by the COVID-19 pandemic was a factor in the decision, and that Fox had originally discussed working with NBC before negotiating the withdrawal instead.

The model seeks to answer the question of whether, by mandating expanded opportunities for minorities in the present, these policies are rendered unnecessary in the future. Affirmative action may lead to one of two outcomes: # By improving employers‚Äô perceptions of minorities or improving minorities‚Äô skills, or both, affirmative action policies would eventually cause employers to want to hire minorities regardless of the presence of affirmative action policies. # By dampening incentives for minorities, affirmative action policies would reduce minority skill investment, thus leading to an equilibrium where employers correctly believe minorities to be less productive than majorities, thus perpetuating the need for affirmative action in order to achieve parity in the labor market. Coate and Loury concluded that either equilibrium is possible under certain assumptions.  Model framework  The exposition of the Coate-Loury model follows the notes of David Autor. The authors make three assumptions as a starting point for their model: # The underlying skill distributions of minorities and non- minorities are the same. This skill distribution is modeled as a distribution of costs of obtaining a qualification. # Employers cannot observe qualifications but do observe noisy signals that are correlated with it. # Employers have rational expectations about worker qualifications and workers have rational expectations about employer screening. Thus, in equilibrium, employers beliefs about worker qualifications will be confirmed. And, similarly, workers will make investments consistent with the returns they will receive in the labor market for those investments. Employers are able to observe worker's identity \\\\mathcal{I} \\\\in \\\\\\\\{ B,W \\\\\\\\}, where the fraction of the population that is W is \\\\lambda, and a noisy signal of the worker's qualification level \\\\theta \\\\in [0,1]. Employers can assign workers to either Task 0 or Task 1, with only qualified workers being successful at Task 1. Employers get a net return x from assigning a worker to Task 1 of the form:x = \\\\begin{cases} x_{q} > 0, \\\\quad &(\\\\text{Worker Qualified}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ -x_{u} <0, \\\\quad &(\\\\text{Worker Unqualified}) \\\\end{cases}The ratio of net gain to loss r = x_{q}/x_{u}. The distribution of \\\\theta depends on whether or not the worker is qualified, which is assumed to not differ between B and W. Let F_{q}(\\\\theta) be the probability that the signal does not exceed \\\\theta, given that the worker is qualified; F_{u}(\\\\theta) is the probability that the signal does not exceed \\\\theta, given that the worker is unqualified. The corresponding probability density functions are f_{q}(\\\\theta) and f_{u}(\\\\theta). Let \\\\varphi(\\\\theta) = f_{u}(\\\\theta)/f_{q}(\\\\theta) be the likelihood ratio, and assume that it is non-increasing on \\\\theta \\\\in [0,1]. This implies that:F_{q}(\\\\theta) \\\\leq F_{u}(\\\\theta), \\\\quad \\\\forall \\\\theta \\\\in [0,1]Therefore, higher values of the signal are more likely if the worker is qualified. This implies that \\\\varphi(\\\\theta) has the monotone likelihood ratio (MLR) property. = Employers' decision rule = For a worker from group B or W, the fraction of qualified workers in the group is \\\\pi. Using Bayes' rule, the employer‚Äôs posterior probability that the worker is qualified, given the worker‚Äôs signal, is:\\\\begin{aligned} \\\\xi(\\\\pi,\\\\theta) &= {\\\\pi f_{q}(\\\\theta)\\\\over{\\\\pi f_{q}(\\\\theta) + (1 - \\\\pi )f_{u}(\\\\theta)}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= {1\\\\over{1 + {1-\\\\pi\\\\over{\\\\pi}} \\\\varphi(\\\\theta) }} \\\\end{aligned} The expected benefit of assigning a worker to Task 1 is:\\\\xi(\\\\pi,\\\\theta)x_{q} - \\\\left[1 - \\\\xi(\\\\pi,\\\\theta) \\\\right]x_{u}Then the employer will assign a worker to Task 1 if the return is positive, which implies that:\\\\begin{aligned} r &\\\\geq {1-\\\\xi(\\\\pi,\\\\theta)\\\\over{\\\\xi(\\\\pi,\\\\theta)}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\geq \\\\left({1-\\\\pi\\\\over{\\\\pi}}\\\\right)\\\\varphi(\\\\theta) \\\\end{aligned}Based on the MLR assumption, there exists a threshold standard s^{*}(\\\\pi) that depends on group membership, so that workers with \\\\theta > s^{*} are placed in Task 1:s^{*}(\\\\pi) = \\\\min \\\\\\\\{ \\\\theta \\\\in [0,1], \\\\quad r\\\\geq [(1-\\\\pi)/\\\\pi]\\\\varphi(\\\\theta) \\\\\\\\}This implies that a higher qualification rate of a group will lead to a lower threshold hiring standard s^{*}. = Workers' investment decision = The expected gross benefit to obtaining appropriate qualification for a worker is:\\\\begin{aligned} \\\\beta(s) &= \\\\omega\\\\left\\\\\\\\{[1-F_{q}(s)] - [1-F_{u}(s)] \\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\omega [F_{u}(s)-F_{q}(s)] \\\\end{aligned}where \\\\omega is gross benefit of being assigned to Task 1 and s is the passing standard. Given the assumption that employers have rational expectations, only the true probability that a worker is qualified should matter - not the employer's beliefs about the probability. Note that \\\\beta(s) is a single-peaked function with \\\\beta(0) = \\\\beta(1) = 0, since there would be no point to investing if all workers were assigned to Task 1 or no workers were assigned to Task 1. This implies that the gross benefit to investing will rise so long as the marginal probability of being assigned to Task 1 is increasing in s. To see this, note that the derivative of the gross benefit with respect to s is:{\\\\partial\\\\beta\\\\over{\\\\partial s}} = \\\\omega[f_{u}(s)-f_{q}(s)]This is only positive if \\\\varphi(s) > 1. Since the boundary points are equal to zero, it follows that \\\\varphi(s) must sometimes be above 1 and sometimes below 1 in the interval. Workers will invest if \\\\beta(s) \\\\geq c, so the share of workers investing will be G[\\\\beta(s)]. If G(\\\\cdot) is continuous and G(0)=0, it will have the property that when the gross benefit is rising in s, the net benefit should also be rising. = Equilibrium = An equilibrium is a fixed point of the aforementioned hiring and investment policies where beliefs are self-confirming, such that:\\\\pi_{i} = G\\\\\\\\{ \\\\beta[s^{*}(\\\\pi_{i})] \\\\\\\\}, \\\\quad i \\\\in \\\\\\\\{B,W\\\\\\\\}A discriminatory equilibrium (\\\\pi_{B} < \\\\pi_{W}) can occur whenever the equilibrium equation has multiple solutions. In this case, it is possible that employers will believe that members of B are less qualified than members of W, which will be confirmed by the investment behavior of members of B. Proposition 1 (p. 1226) proves that, under reasonable conditions, if a solution exists to the equilibrium condition, then at least two solutions will exist. At this point, there are several observations that can be made: # Group identity conveys information only because employers expect it to. # Stereotypes are inefficient sources of information. # No single employer could break the discriminatory equilibrium. # The employer's expected benefit from hiring a W worker exceeds that of hiring a B worker. = Affirmative action = Under the assumption that a discriminatory equilibrium exists, with the further assumption of no differences in skill distributions, an affirmative action policy can be easily rationalized. Coate and Loury consider the policy where the rate of assignment for B and W workers to Task 1 is equalized. Let \\\\rho(s,\\\\pi) be the ex ante probability that a worker is assigned to Task 1:\\\\rho(s,\\\\pi) = \\\\pi[1-F_{q}(s)] + (1-\\\\pi)[1-F_{u}(s)]And let P(s,\\\\pi) be the expected payoff from hiring this worker:P(s,\\\\pi) = \\\\pi[1-F_{q}(s)]x_{q} - (1-\\\\pi)[1-F_{u}(s)]x_{u}Under affirmative action, the employers' optimization problem is to solve:\\\\max_{s_{w},s_{b}} \\\\; (1-\\\\lambda)P(s_{b},\\\\pi_{b}) + \\\\lambda P(s_{w},\\\\pi_{w}), \\\\quad \\\\text{s.t.} \\\\; \\\\rho(s_{b},\\\\pi_{b}) = \\\\rho(s_{w},\\\\pi_{w})where the equality constraint on the ex ante probabilities is the affirmative action constraint. The equivalent Lagrangian \\\\mathcal{L} is:\\\\mathcal{L}(s_{b},s_{w},\\\\gamma;\\\\pi_{b},\\\\pi_{w}) = (1-\\\\lambda)P(s_{b},\\\\pi_{b}) + \\\\lambda P(s_{w},\\\\pi_{w}) + \\\\gamma \\\\left[ \\\\rho(s_{b},\\\\pi_{b}) - \\\\rho(s_{w},\\\\pi_{w})\\\\right]where \\\\gamma is the Lagrange multiplier. Proposition 2 (p. 1229) develops a condition for the existence of a nondiscriminatory equilibrium under affirmative action. In particular, if any group of workers facing standard s invest so that the fraction G[\\\\beta(s)] is qualified, then all equilibria are self-confirming:\\\\widehat{\\\\rho}(s) = \\\\rho\\\\left\\\\\\\\{s,G[\\\\beta(s)]\\\\right\\\\\\\\}In this case, the affirmative action policy would equate employers' beliefs about members of each group. = Patronizing equilibrium = However, it is not in general true that affirmative action under the model's assumptions leads to the nondiscriminatory equilibrium. If at s_{w} the employer lowered the threshold s' < s_{w}, then the fraction of workers investing would fall, and the employers' beliefs about the fraction who are qualified would not be satisfied. Therefore, a policy that lowered s_{w} would not be self-enforcing. Coate and Loury define an equilibrium where affirmative action constraint is permanently binding as a patronizing equilibrium, where employers are compelled to lower their hiring standards for members of B, relative to a member of W. Therefore, the following conditions hold in a patronizing equilibrium:s_{b}^{*} < s_{w}^{*}, \\\\quad \\\\pi_{b} < \\\\pi_{w}There are several possible negative effects on members of B from being trapped in a patronizing equilibrium: * Due to a lower standard, members of B find it optimal to invest less in skills acquisition, which then confirms employers' negative views * Despite being initially identical, reduced investment leads to a divergence between groups and the development of a negative stereotype Recalling the Lagrangian that was developed earlier, we may consider the first-order optimality conditions. Computing \\\\partial\\\\mathcal{L}/\\\\partial s_{i} and rearranging terms gives us:\\\\begin{aligned} r_{b}(\\\\gamma) &= {1-\\\\pi_{b}\\\\over{\\\\pi_{b}}}\\\\varphi(s_{b}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ r_{w}(\\\\gamma) &= {1-\\\\pi_{w}\\\\over{\\\\pi_{w}}}\\\\varphi(s_{w}) \\\\end{aligned}where the ratios of net gain to loss for each group are:r_{b}(\\\\gamma) = {x_{q} + \\\\gamma/(1-\\\\lambda)\\\\over{x_{u}-\\\\gamma/(1-\\\\lambda)}}, \\\\quad r_{w}(\\\\gamma) = {x_{q} + \\\\gamma/\\\\lambda\\\\over{x_{u}-\\\\gamma/\\\\lambda}}Given a shadow price of equality \\\\gamma, employers act as if they must pay the tax of \\\\gamma/\\\\lambda for each W assigned to Task 1 instead of Task 0, while receiving the subsidy \\\\gamma/(1-\\\\lambda) for each B put into Task 1 rather than Task 0. Therefore, employers generally respond to the affirmative action constraint by lowering the standard for B and raising it for W. Proposition 4 (p. 1234) shows that, under reasonable assumptions, the marginal productivity of B and W hires is not equated.

The South Philadelphia Shtiebel is led by Hadas Fruchter, and offers educational, community, and religious programming. The Shtiebel operated out of a storefront on E Passyunk Ave through March 2020 and has continued to offer full scheduling online and outside gatherings. Congregation History South Philadelphia's Jewish community flourished between the 1880s and World War II. Between Third and Eighth Streets, and from Spruce Street south to Oregon Avenue, the Jewish community numbered 150,000 at its height in the 1940s. South Philadelphia was home to more than 150 ‚Äúrowhouse Shuls‚Äù ‚Äî small synagogues located in rowhouses where often the rabbi lived upstairs, and prayer took place downstairs. The Shtiebel picked its organization's name in homage to this history. The number of South Philadelphia shuls decreased dramatically in the late 1960s and early 1970s with changes in neighborhood demography. In 2019 there were approximately ten active synagogues in Society Hill and South Philadelphia, with only two south of South Street. In recent years, South Philadelphia neighborhoods have attracted new residents including a growing number of Orthodox Jews. Hadas Fruchter was ordained by Maharat in June 2016 upon completion of the Maharat Semikha Program. She then served for three years as the assistant spiritual leader at Beth Sholom Congregation and Talmud Torah in Potomac, Maryland. With initial funding and support from Hillel International's Office of Innovation, private donors, and Start-Up Shul, an organization that helps build inclusive Orthodox institutions, Fruchter announced her plans in July 2018 to move to Philadelphia and open her own synagogue that \\"will look like a typical modern Orthodox congregation\\". Seeing the growing Jewish community in South Philadelphia and interest in additional local Jewish programming, Fruchter founded the South Philadelphia Shtiebel in 2019. The Shtiebel moved into a space at 1733 E Passyunk Avenue in March 2019, previously Philadelphia Scooters. The synagogue held its first prayer services on Friday night, July 19, 2019 with 80 in attendance. The Shtiebel was unable to hold indoor gatherings at in its storefront following Purim in March 2020 and through the COVID-19 pandemic in Philadelphia. All programming is currently offered online and limited services held in open outdoor spaces. In closing its location at 1733 E Passyunk Ave, the Shtiebel announced its plans to move into a larger physical location when indoor activities prove safe to resume.

He opened the first x-ray laboratory in the United States in Chicago, and had completed over 1400 x-ray examinations by 1896. His work was critical to the history of radiation protection. He was the father of Arthur Wolfram Fuchs (1895 - 1962), the inventor of the fixed kilovoltage technique of radiography.  Early life and education  Fuchs was born in Germany in 1865 to Julius and Wilhelmina Fuchs. The family emigrated to Chicago in 1870. He returned to Germany to study electrical engineering at the University of Berlin and graduated in 1889. He then went on to Paris to study at the Ecole des Beaux Arts. Upon returning to the United States, Fuchs completed his post-graduate work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston.  Radiography work  Shortly after Wilhelm R√∂ntgen's discovery of x-rays, Fuchs was traveling in Germany and was interested in the potential implications x-rays could have for electrical engineering. Meanwhile, in Chicago, Dr. Friedrich Cort Hamisch was also becoming interested in x-ray technology and had established a correspondence with R√∂ntgen. He set up an x-ray laboratory but eventually handed it over to Dr. Otto L. Schmidt, who placed Fuchs in charge of what was eventually known as the Fuchs X-ray Laboratory. Fuchs' son, Arthur Wolfram Fuchs, wrote in his personal correspondence that: > \\"[the laboratory\\" was a Mecca for physicians and manufacturers who wanted > information regarding the machinery to use and the technic of radiography. > He was, according to the men of his time, one of the outstanding > radiographers. it seemed that, for a time, no one could obtain the pictures > which he was able to make routinely. He was so wrapped up in his > experimental work that he would often sleep in his laboratory night after > night and week-ends.\\" Fuchs was called to Buffalo, NY to aid the dying President William McKinley after his assassination in 1901, even though no x-rays were ever ultimately used.  Early radiation protection  Fuchs realized the radiation damage from x-ray technology before it was acknowledged by the American Medical Association. His own extensive experimentation with x-rays resulted in severe Roentgen-Dermatitis, requiring the eventual amputation of his fingers and thumbs on both hands. Fuchs believed that \\"the damage must be seen to be insignificant compared to the good that follows from this wonderful discovery,\\" and came up with ideas to reduce the damage. On December 12, 1896, Fuchs made the following reasonable recommendations in Western Electrician: * Make the exposure as short as possible * Do not place the x-ray tube closer to the body than 12 inches (30cm). * Rub the skin carefully with Vaseline and leave a layer on the part that shall be exposed. He also added that: \\"The x-ray 'burn' is no more dangerous than normal burns... when the x rays encounter the skull for a longer period, the hair falls out but it grows back without any unpleasant after-effects.\\"  Death  Also suffering from metastatic cancer, Fuchs passed away after several operations on April 21, 1907.

The event, the purpose of which was to promote the idea that the \\"antifa\\" anti-fascist movement should be classified as \\"domestic terrorism\\", received national attention. The rally drew more counter-demonstrators than participants‚Äîwith at least one group urging its members in advance not to attend‚Äîand ended with the Proud Boys requesting a police escort to leave. Planning The rally was organized by talk show radio host and former InfoWars staffer Joe Biggs, who is based in Florida, to protest Portland-based antifascists, and to have antifa declared a domestic terrorist organization. Proud Boys chairman Enrique Tarrio was listed as an organizer on the event's Facebook page. Tarrio said the Proud Boys did \\"not [come] to Portland to cause problems,\\" but to support \\"innocent people, journalists and our brave law enforcement officers\\". Plans for the rally were confirmed as early as July 1, 2019, after protests held on June 29 resulted in clashes. Viral video of an incident on June 29 where conservative blogger Andy Ngo was assaulted by masked demonstrators led the Proud Boys to organize the rally. The city did not issue a permit for the event, which was planned to be held at Tom McCall Waterfront Park. Members of The Daily Stormer, and Oath Keepers were expected to attend. However, Oath Keepers backed out and \\"disavowed the rally for fear of being associated with white supremacists.\\" Members of Three Percenters militia, and the white supremacist American Guard, both designated as hate groups by the Southern Poverty Law Center, attended the event. Biggs promoted the event by posting a video online in which he carries a \\"Trump-themed\\" baseball bat and t-shirt with the text \\"Training to Throw Communists Out of Helicopters\\", in reference to the summary execution of political dissidents in Chile under Augusto Pinochet's military dictatorship. He told participants not to bring weapons or fight unless they were in \\"imminent danger\\". The president of Oath Keepers discouraged members from attending the rally or associating themselves with white nationalists. =Law enforcement= Portland mayor Ted Wheeler announced a \\"zero-tolerance approach\\" would be adopted and promised law breakers would be arrested. Organizers on both sides criticized his handling of the planned activities. Wheeler considered asking Governor Kate Brown to seek support from the Oregon National Guard. Danielle Outlaw, chief of the Portland Police Bureau, said officers were prepared, and the president of the Portland Police Association proposed arresting all people who demonstrate without a permit. Police worked with organizers on both sides \\"to achieve the goal of a safe event\\". The Portland Police Bureau said in advance of the rally that all 1,000 of its officers would be on duty. Federal, state, and other local law enforcement agencies provided assistance to prepare for the rally. Leading up to the rally, Biggs advocated for laws preventing protesters from wearing masks, and said, \\"I hope at the end of the day I can shake the cops' hands and say good job, nothing happened.\\" Six members of Patriot Prayer, including political activist Joey Gibson, were arrested days before the event. The Portland Police Bureau encouraged people to avoid Waterfront Park and visit other parts of the city. The Federal Bureau of Investigation planned to have a presence at the rally. Deployment of the National Guard was considered but avoided. =Reaction= Leaders of civil rights, community, and religious groups condemned the event's organizers and ideology, and approximately 100 people gathered at Pioneer Courthouse Square on August 14 to speak out against violence. Jo Ann Hardesty said, \\"You want to be hateful, stay home. Do not get on a plane, on a bus and come to Portland. We don't want you here. We never wanted you here. If you come, we will expose you to the light of day.\\" Wheeler, Outlaw, U.S. Attorney Billy J. Williams, and Joey Webber of the Portland Timbers also attended the August 14 rally. President Donald Trump monitored developments and tweeted, \\"Major consideration is being given to naming ANTIFA an 'ORGANIZATION OF TERROR.' Portland is being watched very closely. Hopefully the Mayor will be able to properly do his job!\\" Wheeler responded, \\"My job today is to be heads down and focused on maintaining the public safety here in Portland, Oregon. I'm focused on what's going on the ground here in my community... This is a potentially dangerous and volatile situation, and adding to that noise doesn't do anything to support or help the efforts that are going on here in Portland.\\" According to Business Insider, \\"The president's remarks quickly drew scrutiny for siding with the far-right.\\" Antifascist groups made plans to counter-protest. Popular Mobilization hosted \\"The Spectacle\\" to \\"downplay the far-right's rhetoric and inject the atmosphere with whimsy and 'joyful resistance'\\"; planned activities included a banana costume dance party, mask decorating, and dressing as the Pile of Poo emoji. Rose City Antifa issued a statement calling on counter-protestors to defend the city from a \\"far-right attack\\". Miles Thompson and his Unpresidented Brass Band, a 12-person marching band, planned to march with 50 counter protesters in banana costumes, hosting a \\"Banana Bloc Dance Party\\". Counter-protesters also organized a fundraiser to benefit Causa, based on the number of rally supporters; according to HuffPost, the organization \\"advocates for Oregon's Latino population at the state and national level, and helps protect local undocumented immigrants from deportation\\". Event Members of Proud Boys started gathering at the Morrison Bridge at approximately 9am, then started marching south an hour later. They held a prayer service underneath an American flag at Waterfront Park at approximately 10:30am. Officers maintained distance between opposing groups, keeping members of Proud Boys and other right-wing groups south of the Morrison Bridge and counter-protesters north of the bridge. Later, members of Proud Boys marched over Tilikum Crossing while counter-protesters crossed the Burnside Bridge. The demonstration was over by approximately 2:30pm. Crowd estimates varied. CBS News and the Portland Mercury reported there were 200 and 300 people attending in support of the rally, respectively. There were approximately 500 counter-demonstrators, according to Willamette Week. Police estimated there were approximately 1,000 protesters, and the Portland Mercury Alex Zielinski wrote, \\"At its peak, there were an estimated 300 right-wing protesters and 1,000 left-wing protesters in downtown Portland.\\" The event remained mostly calm. Police arrested 13 people, and confiscated weapons, including bear spray, poles, and shields. Gibson attended the rally. The president of the local NAACP affiliate was among the counter-protesters. According to Al Jazeera, \\"More than two dozen local, state and federal law enforcement agencies, including the FBI and the Federal Protective Service ... gathered in Portland to help police monitor the right- wing rally.\\" Proud Boys has pledged to return to Portland monthly until Wheeler \\"excises the alt-left groups from his city\\". =Impact= Some local businesses changed plans or closed for the day because of the demonstrations. Roses on the River, a 5K run and walk affiliated with the Portland Thorns, was relocated to the other side of the Willamette River to avoid potential conflicts. The Portland Streetcar Scavenger Hunt was postponed. Multiple Starbucks locations in downtown Portland closed for the day. Kells Irish Pub cancelled its annual \\"Summer Smoker\\" amateur boxing match. Two performances at Keller Auditorium took place as scheduled, but the venue hired increased security. The Portland Bureau of Transportation closed the northbound side of Southwest Naito Parkway from 9am to 4pm on the preceding Friday and following Monday. Prior to the event, TriMet said services would be altered as needed if law enforcement determined riders were at risk, and confirmed delays were expected. On the day of the rally, Southwest 2nd Avenue from Southwest Madison to Main streets was closed, as were the Hawthorne Bridge and SmartPark garage at 1st Avenue and Jefferson Street.

It was organized in late 2018 and launched in 2019 by the West Papuan representative to the United Nations and the US Congress, Herman Wainggai. History On December 14, 2018, the first meeting was held and the idea of establishing a Human Rights Center to document human rights abuse cases in West Papua came up. The idea was implemented one year later and was formally recognized by the United States government with the approval of the center as an official NGO on March 25, 2019. Objective The main objective of the Center is to help educate the world about the Human Rights issues in West Papua by highlighting the issues facing the West Papuan indigenous people and the Indonesian government. History of West Papua  West Papua was a colony of the Netherlands until 1962 when Indonesia claimed then Western New Guinea as part of Indonesia. The debate between the colonizer and the newly established country led to military combat. Indonesian forces launched a series of attacks against the Netherlands. However, the attacks were repelled by Dutch Forces. After failing to annex West Papua militarily, Indonesia turned to the United Nations. The UN helped broker a deal between them, and West Papua became part of the UN Mandate pending a national referendum. In 1969, the UN launched what many indigenous West Papuans claimed to be an unfair election known as the Act of Free Choice. Of the nearly one million indigenous West Papuans at the time, only 1025 people (less than 1% of the population) were handpicked to vote. The result of the election gave Indonesia the legal justification for its occupation of West Papua.  Mission  Indonesia formally occupied West Papua in 1969. The Indonesian government established military bases and police posts in major cities and towns in West Papua. A report published in July 2017 by Human Rights Papua stated that indigenous women were likely to suffer racial discrimination and physical abuse as a result of the occupation. The main objective of the Center is the collection and documentation of human rights abuses. Names and information associated with victims are recorded and maintained by the WPHRC. Inaction on the part of the US government has led scholars and critics to call for changes in US approach. Only with the US government's participation, the center believes, will changes be favorable to both sides. The Center documents human rights violations in three categories: human rights, religious rights and environmental rights.

Biography Grgo Iliƒá was born in Vare≈°, Ottoman Empire (central part of modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina). In 1752 he entered the seminary at the Franciscan monastery Kraljeva Sutjeska, and than went to study philosophy and theology in Italy. He returned to Kraljeva Sutjeska to teach novice friars, and became monastery vicar. He also served as ≈æupnik (vicar) in several ≈æupas (parishes) until 1774. He served as provincial minister of Franciscan province Bosna Argentina (official: Provincia OFM Exaltationis S. Crucis - Bosna Argentina) in two terms. Pope Pio VI appointed Iliƒá to the position of provincial minister first in 1783, a position he held only for one year from opposition within the provincial electoral plenary council, and than in 1793 for a second term, this time for life. In 1796 Grgo Iliƒá was named Bishop of Ruspe and auxiliary to bishop Augustin Boto≈°-Okiƒá (1784-1798). In 1798 Iliƒá became Apostolic vicar in Bosnia, one of the roles he performed for the rest of his life. Work influences and impact As a bishop he wrote and printed many pastoral-catechist works. In Filip Lastriƒá's work Od‚Äô uzame (Mleci, 1796) he published 14 of its speeches aimed at Bosnian common people: Kratko nadometnuƒáe u‚Äô knji≈æice Od‚Äô uzame O. fra Filipa iz Oƒáevje.

Kaiser testified about her involvement in the work of Cambridge Analytica before the UK Parliament and in private before the Mueller Investigation. Early life Kaiser was born in Houston and grew up in Lincoln Park on the North Side of Chicago. Her father worked in real estate development and her mother worked for Enron. She has a sister named Natalie. Kaiser attended elementary school in Chicago until she moved to attend Phillips Academy Andover in 2005, then went on to study at the University of Edinburgh, the City University of Hong Kong, the University of London‚Äôs Birkbeck College, and earned certificates of study at the World Bank Institute and US Institute of Peace. She later obtained her Doctor of Philosophy from Middlesex University. Career While she was studying at the University of Edinburgh, Kaiser took time off to work on Barack Obama's media team during his presidential campaign in 2007. She also worked for Amnesty International as a lobbyist appealing for an end to crimes against humanity. Between February 2015 and January 2018, Kaiser worked full-time for the SCL Group, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, as director of business development. During her time at Cambridge Analytica, Kaiser worked under senior management, including CEO Alexander Nix. Following the Facebook‚ÄìCambridge Analytica data scandal, Kaiser fled to Thailand. She later testified before the British Parliament about Cambridge Analytica and privacy threats posed by Facebook. In April 2018, Kaiser started a Facebook campaign appealing for transparency, called #OwnYourData. Kaiser is one of the subjects of the Netflix documentary The Great Hack, talking about her work with Cambridge Analytica. The documentary provides details about how Cambridge Analytica used data brokers and an online app to accumulate information on tens of millions of Facebook users, gathering data on a massive scale. Kaiser's memoir, Targeted: The Cambridge Analytica Whistleblower's Inside Story of How Big Data, Trump, and Facebook Broke Democracy and How It Can Happen Again, was published by Harper in October 2019. The book details how companies are illegally using data to influence people‚Äôs choices. In an interview with the BBC, Kaiser said she wanted Facebook to ban political advertising. In June 2019, Kaiser was appointed to the advisory board of Phunware, a tech company that collects smartphone location and user data. The company became involved in the Trump 2020 reelection campaign through a $3 million contract awarded by Brad Parscale's American Made Media Consultants. Kaiser resigned from the board and described the deal as a \\"grossly unethical conflict of interest\\". On New Year‚Äôs Day 2020, Kaiser began to release internal documents from Cambridge Analytica links to material on elections in Brazil, Kenya and Malaysia. In an online interview with Philippine media outlet Rappler on July 15, 2020, Kaiser revealed that former Senator Ferdinand \\"Bongbong\\" Marcos Jr, son of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr, had approached Cambridge Analytica with a request to do a \\"rebranding\\" of the family's image. She described the efforts of the Marcos family to rebrand their family image as an example of historical revisionism in a data-driven and scientific way. This request was said to have brought up heavy debate among the staff at Cambridge Analytica, but was nevertheless accepted by CEO Alexander Nix, as it was a financial opportunity. Rappler requested a comment from Marcos' spokesperson Vic Rodriguez, who replied on Thursday morning, denying the allegations brought up by Kaiser. Rodriguez branded the report as \\"patently fake, false, and misleading\\", denying that his party had never heard of Cambridge Analytica until their data breach scandal. He also accused Rappler of creating a \\"marketing ploy\\" to boost support towards the news outlet and stated that Marcos is considering legal options against Rappler for the report.

The original recipe dates back to the 16th century, when the Portuguese controlled the coastal areas of the country, known as \\"Bolo di Amor\\". The cake incorporates a mix of ingredients from Portuguese cakes, such as semolina, together with local Sri Lankan spices, such as nutmeg, cinnamon and cardamon.

Characteristics Love cake is made from semolina, cashew nuts, pumpkin preserve, butter, eggs, sugar, and honey flavoured with rose water and a variety of spices, including cinnamon, nutmeg and cardamon, creating a fragrant, sweet, lightly spiced cake with a moist chewy inside and a crunchy exterior.

Whitehouse Field, or Whitehouse Field, is a baseball venue in Harwich, Massachusetts, home to the Harwich Mariners of the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL). Opened in 1969, Whitehouse Field was named for Mr. B.F.C. Whitehouse and was dedicated in July of 1969 as part of Harwich's 275th anniversary celebration. The ballpark was built on land adjacent to what is now Monomoy Regional High School, and features a deep outfield fence with a symmetrical configuration. It is accessed via an extended woodland trail that opens into the tree-ringed clearing where the field is located. The press box/concession stand at Whitehouse Field As early as the 1920s, Harwich had a franchise in the CCBL, albeit originally a combined Chatham-Harwich team. The Mariners became Harwich's own team in 1930, and prior to 1969 played their home games at Harwich's Brooks Park. At the 1969 dedication ceremonies for Whitehouse Field, Mr. Whitehouse concluded his remarks by stoking Harwich's historic small-town border rivalry, turning to the Mariners players and exhorting, \\"Now go out there and beat Chatham!\\"Price, Christopher. Baseball by the Beach, Hyannis, MA: Parnassus Imprints, 1998, p.189. . In 1998, a new scoreboard was donated by former Major League Baseball commissioner Fay Vincent, Jr., in memory of his father, Fay Vincent, Sr. The commissioner had been a longtime summer resident of Harwich and a fan of the Mariners and the CCBL, and wished to honor his late father who had been the baseball captain at Yale University in 1931. The scoreboard was dedicated on July 6, 1998 as part of \\"Fay Vincent Night at Whitehouse Field\\", and has been billed by the CCBL as being \\"the largest scoreboard in New England south of Fenway Park\\". A 2008 grant from the Yawkey Foundation helped fund major upgrades to Whitehouse that included the installation of a new lighting system and protective netting. Whitehouse Field hosted the CCBL's annual all-star game and home run derby festivities in 1992, 2002, 2012 and 2018, and has seen the Mariners claim CCBL championships in 1983, 1987, 2008 and 2011. The ballpark has been the summertime home of dozens of future major leaguers such as Kevin Millar, Josh Donaldson, and DJ LeMahieu.

Blake made his championship debut for Donegal after Paul Callaghan sustained a groin injury during Donegal's championship win over Antrim in 1998. Blake won a Railway Cup in 2000.

He also featured in the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship quarter-final against Dublin. It was his best campaign and he credits the assistance of former Donegal goalkeeper Gary Walsh for his part in this. A persistent knee injury forced him to retire from inter-county football in May 2004. Donegal's manager at the time, McEniff (again), said of Blake's meeting with a surgeon: \\"when the test results came back it showed a lot of wear and tear behind the knee cap\\". Blake had worn a bandage on his knee before Donegal's 2004 Dr McKenna Cup final defeat to Tyrone. McEniff said: \\"I noticed it that day and it became apparent that he had a problem\\".

He was spotted at a scouting tournament organised by Nigerian agent Babawo Mohammed. In the tournament he was noticed as a quick, strong and skillful forward.

Firebird) is a 2004 drama/romance South Korean television series starring Lee Seo-jin, Lee Eun-ju, Jung Hye-young and Eric Mun. It aired on MBC from April 5 to June 29, 2004 on Mondays and Tuesdays at 21:55 for 26 episodes. It was about a couple who fell in love, but couldn't be together. They meet years later and their fortunes are switched. In the end they have a serious talk and decide that it is finally \\"the right time\\" for them to be together again. With average viewership ratings of 25.3% and a peak of 31.4%, Phoenix was among the top-rated Korean dramas that aired on MBC in 2004. All four lead actors received acting recognition at the 2004 MBC Drama Awards. This is the last TV appearance of actress Lee Eun-ju who committed suicide the following year. Synopsis Jang Sae-hoon is a poor, intelligent and hardworking college student on scholarship with a part-time job at a gas station. Lee Ji-eun is a strong-willed and impulsive girl whose father is the CEO of a textile company. Ji-eun falls in love with and pursues Sae-hoon, despite her family's strong opposition and his own misgivings about their different backgrounds. For fear that her family will succeed in breaking them apart, Ji-eun purposely gets pregnant with Sae-hoon's child so that they would be allowed to get married. After the wedding, spoiled Ji-eun is ill-accustomed to Sae-hoon's shabby living conditions, causing constant fights between the young couple. Ji-eun later suffers a miscarriage, which further drives a wedge between them. After losing the baby, Ji-eun becomes depressed and angry; she still loves her husband but is unable to communicate her feelings. Despite Sae-hoon's efforts to win her back, she shuts him out and allows herself to be convinced by her parents to file for divorce. Heartbroken, Sae-hoon takes the opportunity to leave for the US on a study grant/scholarship so that he can forget her. Upon hearing that Sae-hoon is planning to leave Korea, Ji-eun speeds to the airport to stop him. Her father drives close behind, hoping to intercept her. At a traffic stop during a red light, her father steps out of his car and tries to catch her attention, but a motorcyclist sideswipes him. Her father dies. Because of the fatal accident, Ji-eun never gets to the airport. At her father's funeral service, a company executive informs Ji-eun that her father's company has been taken over by rival Seo-Rin Group. Ji-eun's family has lost everything, they have no assets, no money. 10 years later... In a reversal of fortunes, Ji-eun is now the world-weary breadwinner of her family while Sae-hoon triumphantly returns to Korea as a highly paid executive of Seo-Rin Group. He is engaged to Yoon Mi-ran, a rich, beautiful woman who adores him. Mi-ran is in a wheelchair after being paralyzed waist-down in a car accident the year before which Sae-hoon blames himself for. While attending a fancy dinner party, Sae-hoon is shocked and disturbed to see Ji- eun as one of the waitresses. At the same party, playboy and Seo-Rin Group heir apparent Seo Jung-min tries to pick up Ji-eun and becomes seriously intrigued after she repeatedly turns him down. Unaware of the connection, Mi- ran invites her old high school friend Ji-eun to meet her fianc√© Sae-hoon. Despite their shock and unease, the exes try to spare Mi-ran's feelings by pretending they'd just met. But Mi-ran eventually finds out the truth about their previous relationship and she becomes wracked by jealousy and insecurity. She had been undergoing months of physical therapy, and during a session, discovers that she can walk again. Afraid that Sae-hoon is still in love with his ex-wife and that he would leave her once he knows that she can walk, Mi-ran conceals the truth from him and lies that she is still crippled, helpless and totally dependent on him, thereby assuring that he's tied to her by the bonds of guilt. Sae-hoon hires Ji-eun as his housemaid, initially for revenge, but finds he does not have the stomach for it. Instead he discovers the quietly proud, mature and capable woman the trials of life has molded her into and can't help but admire her. Feelings of impotent jealousy also rise to the surface at seeing her being wooed by Seo Jung-min. In an echo of her single-minded pursuit of Sae-hoon years ago, this time she is the one being relentlessly pursued by Jung-min while she tries to keep him at arm's length because she knows that Jung-min's father would never approve of her as a future daughter-in-law since she is divorced and poor. But despite Ji-eun's objections (and her still-complicated feelings for Sae-hoon), Jung-min proves the depth of his feelings for her and she eventually gives in to her attraction and agrees to become his girlfriend. She grows to care for him and they are happy for a time, and their relationship weathers several storms including Jung-min bitterly finding out that she was married to Sae-hoon. The more Sae-hoon continues to encounter Ji-eun at work (she is hired as a temp at Seo-Rin Group), the more he falls in love with her and realizes he never really got over her. Though he never acts on his feelings, Mi-ran senses them and manipulates him, Ji-eun and Jung-min. When Sae-hoon finally finds out that Mi-ran can walk and that she has been feeding him so many lies for so long, he breaks up with her for good. Mi-ran snaps and becomes increasingly obsessive and destructive. After countless crazy and vicious acts, Mi-ran commits suicide by swallowing a whole bottle of sleeping pills then calling Sae-hoon and Ji-eun to her side. She dies in Sae-hoon's arms as Ji-eun tearfully looks at what her old friend has become. It is later revealed that the so-called \\"accident\\" that took the life of Ji-eun's father was actually part of a setup masterminded by Jung-min's father. Mr. Seo had wanted to take over the Lee textile business at a very low price, so he arranged a hit-and-run accident that would cause Mr. Lee to stay in the hospital for a few days until the bidding ended (but Mr. Lee ended up dying from his wounds). Their relationship could not recover from such a blow, and Ji-eun breaks up with Jung-min. To save his father, Jung-min kidnaps Ji-eun to force Sae-hoon to give up proof of Mr. Seo's culpability in Mr. Lee's death. But Jung-min later comes to his senses and lets her go, and Mr. Seo is arrested but dies in the hospital before he is convicted. Jung-min then leaves for the US to start over. Three years later... Ji-eun is now a successful marketing brand manager, and Sae- hoon has built his own microchip company. They each go separately to Jeju island (where they first consummated their love), and reach the same spot at the same time. They have a serious talk and decide that it is finally \\"the right time\\" for them to be together again. Cast =Main characters= ;Lee Seo-jin as Jang Sae-hoon He was raised by his father, and grew up building up great ambitions for success and fame. Then he lost his father to a car accident and started working as a part-time job at a gas station to make his living. His life is a difficult one indeed, but he's a natural born genius, who has never missed a scholarship in school. One day out of the blue, a girl comes storming into his life. Her name is Ji-eun, a girl of a completely different background and character from Sae-hoon's. Knowing just too well of his harsh reality and of what waits for them ahead, he pushes her away. Ji-eun however, is keen to get his heart, and in the end, they get married. But as he expected, their marriage life was not rosy-colored and Ji-eun soon leaves him. After signing divorce papers, he gets on a plane heading for New York City and a \\"new life\\". After a series of all kinds of ups and downs, he accomplishes the \\"American Dream\\" and becomes a newly polished person, William Jang. Ten years have passed and he returns to Korea. Maybe it's a twist of their fate...he finds himself standing in front of her once again. But this time, he has someone, Mi-ran beside him. What's even worse, Mi-ran and Ji-eun are friends who studied together in Boston. Ten years ago, he really had nothing to offer her, but he loved her with all of his heart. Can he really let her go? ;Lee Eun-ju as Lee Ji-eun She has grown up having her way with everything. Her father is a successful CEO of a textile group and her mother is a hopeless and immature lady who only knows her luxurious world. With this background plus her beautiful looks, she's a reckless spoiled little brat. But she's also one lovable and attractive girl. She comes home from Boston for the holidays and as usual, she goes around acting like a spoiled princess. One day, Sae- hoon suddenly comes into her life and she falls for him. But naturally, her parents are not happy about poor orphaned Sae-hoon. Ji-eun doesn't give up and gets pregnant. She leaves her parents and her luxurious life behind and starts her life with Sae-hoon in a tiny room in a rundown neighborhood. But very soon, she wakes up to reality and starts to get tired of her life in destitution. As misery loves company, she has a miscarriage and realizes she can't die for love. She gives a point-blank \\"no\\" and leaves Sae-hoon. After their divorce, upon hearing that Sae-hoon is leaving Korea, she drives like crazy to the airport thinking it would be her last chance to get him back. But fate is cruel to her and takes her father away in a car accident when he follows her. With her father's sudden death and the fall of her family, hopeless Ji-eun picks up the phone and calls Sae-hoon who, without knowing her situation, coldly turns her down. Ten years later as a 32 years old divorc√©e, Ji-eun is a different person. With a manic-depressive mother and a trouble- making sister, she has now become the breadwinner of the family: this is a big change from the once reckless little brat who didn't even know how to turn on the stove. And another love comes knocking on her door. Jung-min is no doubt the perfect prince charming every girl would die for. Again she finds someone whom she desperately wants to get off her mind but whom she just can't forget. Then her ex-husband Sae-hoon turns up in front of her. And a twist of fate makes them meet as client and helper. ;Jung Hye-young as Yoon Mi-ran Daughter of a rich real estate agent, she grew up wealthy and has a carefree lifestyle, left to her own devices by her doting father. However, despite that she has always felt somewhat inferior to Ji-eun. Without knowing Sae-hoon was once married to Ji-eun, she gets to know Sae-hoon at one Christmas donation party. She also desperately falls for him and decides to make him hers, doing everything possible. She did manage to get Sae-hoon to be with her but this was due to a car accident. The accident makes left her unable to walk and getting around in a wheelchair. Feeling guilty and responsible for the accident, Sae-hoon decides to marry her. Things get more complicated when Mi- ran learns of Sae-hoon's ex-wife. She then becomes more obsessed with Sae-hoon in order not to lose him to her lifetime rival, Ji-eun. She even hides the fact that she can now walk again... ;Eric Mun as Seo Jung-min He's the prince charming of a huge conglomerate called Seo-Rin Group. He seems to have everything - the colorful background as the heir of Seo-Rin, perfectly good- looking face, gentleman-like manners, talent in every sports. Maybe it could even be said that the word \\"perfect\\" is made for this kind of person. When he graduated from a prestigious university in Boston with honors, people were putting highest hopes on him. However, he was not spared from a twisted fate... He can never forget the day when he lost his twin brother. Only if he had not shouted to his brother, \\"Come on, you can do better than that. Beat me!\\" He felt guilty about the accident ever since and as a form of self- punishment, he lives the life of a debauchee much to the consternation and fury of his father. Then fate brings him to Ji-eun... =Supporting characters= *Park Geun-hyung as Seo Moon-soo, Jung-min's father *Kim Bin-woo as Lee Young-eun, Ji-eun's younger sister *Lee Yoo-jin as Nam Bok-ja, Ji-eun's friend *Lee Kyung-jin as Jo Hyun-sook, Ji-eun's mother *Kim Byung-se as Kim Ho-jin, Sae-hoon's upperclassman *Han In-soo as Lee Sang-beom, Ji-eun's father *Shim Yang-hong as Mi-ran's father *Kim Boo-seon as Jung-min's stepmother *Kim Dong-hyun as Yeo-jin *Yoon Sung-hoon as Mi-ran's chauffeur *Yoon Yoo-sun as Dr. Ahn Ji-young, psychiatrist Music The theme song was \\"Fate\\" by Lee Seung-chul.

Morrison started against Clare and Meath (regular fixture, not the final) in the 2019 National Football League, completing both games. He did not feature in any further games, as Donegal won the National Football League Division 2 title. In April 2019, it was reported that Morrison had left the Donegal panel. He thus missed Donegal's 2019 Ulster Senior Football Championship title win. Morrison made one substitute appearance for Donegal in the 2020 National Football League, in the opening fixture against Mayo. Then the COVID-19 pandemic brought play to a halt. With play resuming locally in August, Morrison sustained another injury while performing for his club at Fintra during the 2020 Donegal Senior Football Championship (Round 3 of the League Stage) and was stretchered from the field of play.

Until September 2020, 25 confirmed rabies cases have been reported and 24 people have died.  Background and spread of the disease  According to the findings of Malaysia's Health Ministry through the statement of the department minister S. Subramaniam in 2017, the origin source of rabies outbreak in Sarawak is suspected to have originated from neighbouring West Kalimantan in Indonesia with large rabies outbreak having occurred in the area. The first casualties caused by the virus in Sarawak was reported on 4 July 2017 involving two children in Serian Division; a six-year-old girl and her four-year-old brother. This was followed by the deaths of a seven-year-old children on 13 July and a five-year-old victim four days after the death of the third victim, both from Serian District. In two years, the virus has taking the lives of 21 people; the 17th and 18th victims were a 26-year-old man from Batu Kawa and a 61-year-old woman from Pending who died on 31 May and 12 June in 2019. Another nine-year-old child victim was infected in August 2017 has been in the comatose state and treated at home. An 46-year-old man from Padawan who failed to inform the health authorities that he has been bitten by his puppy died on 7 August as the 19th victim while his eight-year- old daughter who was also bitten by the puppy are reported to be in good condition and currently under observation after the victim sent her earlier to a health clinic with her case was immediately referred to the Post Bite Clinic (PBC) at the Sarawak Hospital to receive the first dose of rabies vaccine. On 2 November 2019, a five-year-old child victim from Kuching died while undergoing intensive care after being unwell since 13 October with sore throat symptom where he was confirmed positive for rabies through infection from his pet dogs that were allowed freely to play with stray dogs and not vaccinated against the virus while a girl, who suffers severe neurological complications caused by the virus has been on life support equipment for the past two years. Further fatalities were recorded in March 2020 involving a 5-year-old girl from Sibu town who was attacked and bitten by dogs on the face. Despite being treated and given rabies vaccine, the girl died from rabies encephalitis on 25 March. On 20 May 2020, a 62-year-old man from within the same town of Sibu died after being bitten following a visit to relative's house. On 8 September, another death was reported involving a 51-year-old man from Penrissen Road in Kuching who had been hospitalised since 26 August.  Areas affected  Since the first case was reported in Serian Division, further eight divisions including Betong, Kapit, Kuching, Miri, Samarahan, Sarikei, Sibu and Sri Aman have been declared as rabies infected areas. One of the main causes of the spread to other divisions is resulted from irresponsible dog owner taking a dog out from a rabies-infected area without movement permit from the state veterinary authority as discovered in late 2018 with a case of man being compounded for bringing his dog to Limbang Division from Kuching. From 1 July 2018 until 30 May 2019, the Sarawak government had declared 62 areas in 11 divisions as rabies infection areas with only Limbang Division free from the virus.  Government and health authorities response  Bintangor warning of rabies outbreak. As a result of the first reported deaths in July 2017, the authorities began to declare a statewide rabies outbreak. In January 2019, the outbreak has been declared a Level 2 Disaster to enable all government agencies to pool resources in a concerted effort to mobilise and contain the spread of the disease with vaccination and removal of stray dogs and cats through phases starting from 1 March. With the ongoing outbreak, the federal government has contributed a total RM9.3 million for statewide anti-rabies operation in Sarawak including the dispatchment of various agencies both from state and the federal government including the State Disaster Management Committee (SDMC), armed forces, police, National Security Council, Civil Defence Force, Health Department and Department of Veterinary Services to jointly stop the spread of the virus. As stated by Malaysia's Deputy Health Minister Lee Boon Chye in 2019, the country Health Ministry will consider proposals from universities or the industrial sector to conduct medical science research on the treatment of rabies. On 4 July, Sarawak Research and Development Council (SRDC) entered into an agreement with Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS) to conduct research on quick diagnosis of rabies in the state. Local residence in the involved areas were urged to give out their full co-operation to eliminate the outbreak since there have been reports in the early phase that it is not well received by animal lovers and groups representing animal rights. The government then increased more awareness programmes, mass vaccination for pets and opening of animal bite clinics for people to seek medical attention and to be vaccinated for suspected of the virus infection after being bitten by animals. A total of 120,353 dogs from an estimate of 210,000 dogs have been vaccinated throughout the outbreak. With the growing awareness, the fourth phase operations for \\"targeted removal\\" carried out in Lundu, Bau, Padawan, Samarahan, Kuching, Serian and Simunjan went smoothly without interruption with a total of 6,725 stray dogs and 61 cats have been removed. The number of vaccination increases to over 150,000 in October 2019 through free anti-rabies vaccination provided by the government. The government also began to maintaining an immune belt along the Sarawak-West Kalimantan border where the rabies is believed to have spread from. A total ban on the movement of dogs both in and out of Sarawak along its border with Kalimantan was imposed on 23 August 2019 to curb the spread of the virus with Sarawak Deputy Chief Minister Douglas Uggah Embas expressed his disappointment to certain people who had been bitten by their pet dogs and cats but did not seek immediate medical treatment despite the many publicity campaigns, talks and statements with radio announcements and reminders have been delivered by the government. Nevertheless, the Sarawak Health Department with the co- operation of the Veterinary Services Department and the local councils are working together to mitigate new occurrences with the State Disaster Management Committee (SDMC) also has given the assurance that the outbreak in Sarawak is contained. Neighbouring Sabah have been on alert on the quick spread of the virus and began to maintaining a tight check on the movement of animals since the outbreak in Sarawak. The United States Embassy in Malaysia and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have raised a notice and Level 2 Alert on the outbreak in 2017. The government of Sarawak also collaborates with authorities in neighbouring Sabah, Brunei and Indonesia to contain the spread of the virus through information exchange and border control along with mass vaccination and targeted removal programmes to ensure the migration of animals is under control with the government promise it will continue to conduct annual dogs vaccination programmes and controlling dogs movement between Sarawak divisions until the state is declared rabies free.

She remained their for her PhD, working on optical neural network and optical data storage. During her doctorate she worked at the √âcole sup√©rieure d'optique. In her early career she worked alongside Margit Zacharias, a Professor of Physics at the Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies.  Research and career  In 1993 Denz was made Head of the Photorefractive Group at Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt. She moved to the University of M√ºnster in 2001, where she leads the Nonlinear Photonics Group. She founded the Centre for Nonlinear Science (CeNoS) at the WWU University of M√ºnster. She became Chair of Applied Physics and Head of the Institute in 2003. Denz develops modern optical methods for structuring light and matter; which includes optical data storage and systems for information processing. She developed a compact holographic data storage system in which data is imprinted on a liquid crystal display onto a laser beam. The laser beam is superimposed on a separated reference beam, with the information being encoded on a hologram. The information is read in parallel and can permit high data transfer rates. For digital data, holographic storage allows for improved security and encryption. She is interested in developing single crystal data storage systems, and uses them an switching elements such as optical transistors. She has worked on photonic crystals that use non-linear photorefractive materials. She demonstrated that optical induction could be used to produce quasicrystals, a chemical structure that has three-dimensional crystalline groups with spiral structures and defined defects. In CeNoS Denz uses nonlinear dynamics and chaos control, such as the control of cavity solitons and generation of slow light. In 2008 Denz began working with complex light fields; including non-diffractive and accelerating light fields, for the creation of holographic optical tweezers. She has used these light fields to manipulate nano and micro-scale particles. = Academic service = Denz has worked on activities promoting women in physics throughout her career. In 1993 she coordinated a travelling exhibition on women in physics, which started at Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt. She organised a three-year program called Light Up Your Life, which introduced girls to science projects and career options. Denz founded the Minster Experimental Laboratory (MExLAb), through which she took part in science programs in schools as well as a research oriented school lab. In 2011 Denz planned a university-wide MExLab, MExLab ExperiMINTe, MINT being the German equivalent of the acronym STEM.

It was built in 1928 as a private athletic club, was converted to office buildings in the 1960s, was converted to a city center in 1994, and became a homeless shelter and community medical facility in the 2010s.  Building  In its initial 1928 press coverage, the building touted a 13-story structure made of reinforced concrete with 96 bedrooms, two solariums, four handball courts, a gymnasium, swimming pool, lounge, dining room, grill, a separate dining room and lounge for women, and a separate entrance on A street for women. The construction cost was billed at (). However, later news articles reported the building as having 12 stories. The ziggurat-shaped building includes stenciled ceiling frescoes in the former dining room and a grand staircase that was restored in the latest remodel. Within the building are figures of Paris and Helen of Troy by sculptor Katherine June Stafford that will be restored or reconstructed.  History  In 1924, Colonel Ed Fletcher initiated the foundation of a club and put forth the money to begin its charter. Other members of letters of incorporation include George Marston, Claus Spreckels, Milton A. McRae, Ralph E. Jenney, with Colonel Fletcher presiding as the club's first president. During its inaugural week, there were invitations for dinner-dances and an open house for members and invited guests, drawing more than 10,000 people to the new club. Beginning with the Great Depression, the renamed San Diego Club ran into financial trouble. In the 1940s, the club's debts created doubt if it would continue, but it persevered into the 1960s. In the mid 1960s the building was converted to offices for Harcourt Brace Jovanovich after the club folded. After HBJ vacated the building, they donated the property to the city in the fall of 1993. In 1994 the City of San Diego and the Port of San Diego made arrangements with the World Trade Centers Association to establish a San Diego center located in the Athletic Club building, with the former two entities helping to bear the cost. The plan to convert the building into commercial properties was projected to generate nearly half a million dollars per year in revenue for the city. The city also moved some of its own staff, including a portion of the Parks and Recreation Department into the property. In 2010, the City of San Diego made public its proposed plans to use the San Diego Athletic Club building to provide housing for a portion of its homeless population. The plans called for support and services for up to 225 homeless residents. It also proposed selling the property for up to $10 million to the housing development agency or another government entity to run the program. In 2012 it was reported that Turner Construction Company spent $24 million to restore the building to its original state and make way for its use as a homeless shelter. The organization managing the project is Affirmed Housing, which paid the city $4 million for the property and arranged financing for the remainder. In addition to housing homeless residents, the center will provide a medical health clinic and a social services center.

(formerly Water-Gen) is an Israel-based global company that develops water-from-air solutions. History Founded in 2009 by Israeli entrepreneur and former combat commander Arye Kohavi and a team of engineers, Watergen was originally a startup conceived to provide easily accessible water to militaries worldwide. Following the company's acquisition in 2016 by businessman Michael Mirilashvili, Watergen shifted its focus tackling water scarcity and answering the needs of civilians following natural disasters. Watergen has since developed a line of products, suitable for different needs, from remote rural areas to commercial office buildings and private homes. It has been used around the world by armies as well as the public and private sectors in the United States, Latin America, India, Vietnam, Uzbekistan and the African continent. The company's main office is located in Petah Tikva, Israel. It has an affiliate company in the United States, \\"Watergen USA\\". Technology Water gen's patented GENius‚Ñ¢ technology is an energy-efficient atmospheric water generator (AWG), which generates water from air at 250Wh per liter. During the process, the air is drawn into the Watergen atmospheric water generator, where an air filter removes dust and dirt. Then, clean air is directed through Watergen's technology and undergoes a heat exchange and cooling process. At this temperature point, condensation occurs, and water is created. The water is then channeled through a multi-stage filtering system to remove impurities, add minerals, and maintain its health properties (when the water reaches its ideal quality, it is either stored in a built-in or external reservoir where it is kept fresh through continuous circulation or connected to the water grid of buildings, neighborhoods, and cities, delivering water directly to residents‚Äô taps). According to the company, GENius‚Ñ¢ produces up to five times more water per kilowatt than any other technology on the market, using just 250Wh per liter. It claims that the process is environmentally friendly, a renewable solution that reduces plastic waste and carbon footprint, and typically produces 4 liters of water for every kilowatt-hour of energy at the cost of 2-4 cents per liter. Products * Large Scale AWG - Watergen's Large Scale unit is an Industrial Scale Atmospheric Water Generator (AWG), designed for towns, villages, factories, off-grid settlements, and communities. Daily production is up to 4800 liters. * GEN-350 AWG - GEN-350 atmospheric water generator is a medium scale, mobile water generator aimed for fast deployment at all weather conditions. It is able to produce up to 900 liters of water a day, depending on the humidity and temperature. It is an ideal solution for schools, hospitals, commercial and residential buildings. * Emergency Response Vehicle - Watergen's Emergency response vehicle (ERV) is a customized heavy-duty truck that securely transports Watergen's units to provide clean drinking water-from-air in emergencies and natural disasters. It consists of GEN-350 and is powered by a diesel generator that ensures the system is mobile and operated in any location. * GENNY Home Appliances - GENNY is a water-from-air, energy-efficient generator, for home and office and can generate up to 27 liters of fresh drinking water per day. * Automotive AWG - Integrated water generation technology in private and public transportation, providing the driver and passengers with clean drinking water from the front seat and reducing the need to use bottled water. Awards and recognition Since its inception, Watergen has received praise for its work, including from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who hailed its technology for bringing water \\"to millions of people in Africa\\". Fox News host Liz Claman called it \\"one of the most magical innovations of the 21st century\\". In a 2018 competition conducted by Israel's Ministry of Economy and Ynet News, in celebration of the country's 70th year of independence, Watergen was selected as one of Israel's top 9 most influential inventions based on votes of over 50,000 participants. Over the years, the company has received the following awards: * 2020: Consumer Technology Association's Energy Efficiency Product of the Year; during the 2020 Smart Home Mark of Excellence Awards at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada.Israeli tech company making water from air gets top honor in Las Vegas. * 2019: Best of Innovation Award and Honoree recipient for Genny home/office water generator, by CES. * 2018: World Economic Forum Technology Pioneer * 2014: One of the 50 Most Innovative Companies, by Fast Company * 2014: Won The European Technology Innovation Leadership Award, Frost & Sullivan * Selected as one of Israel's most influential inventions by the Ministry of Economy and Industry References Specs 12kva Diesel generator uses between 1.2-3 liters of diesel per hour, average 2L/hr at 5.6 kW/h needed to operate Watergen GEN-M. 5600kWh at 350Wh per liter produces up to 16 liters of water.

Biographie  His father was a \\"Marchand-mercier\\" (entrepreneur). He is generally credited with being an autodidact. The painter, Charles Gabet (1793-1861), says that he had \\"no other masters but nature and the love of his art\\". Nevertheless, he is known to have frequented the studios of the painter Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes and the engraver, . His first exhibition at the Salon came in 1799 and he participated regularly for the remainder of his life, receiving a second-class medal in 1810 and a first-class medal in 1819. He was named a Chevalier in the Legion of Honor in 1825.Dossier @ the Base Leonore He was a prolific painter who travelled widely to work en plein aire; visiting the south of France, Savoy, Italy (which had a significant effect on his work), Belgium and the Tyrol. He strove to give his landscapes a historical feeling, in the Romantic style. His works were generally popular, but the fierce and caustic art critic, Th√©ophile Gautier proclaimed, after the Salon of 1833, that \\"As for Watelet and his like, it is impossible for them to be more worthless.

She served as deputy party secretary of Tsinghua University, and was a delegate to the First and Third National People's Congresses. She was the wife of the high-ranking Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leader Song Ping, a former member of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee.  Republic of China  Chen was born in September 1917 in Jinan, Shandong, Republic of China, with her ancestral home in Fuzhou, Fujian. In September 1936, she entered the Department of Civil Engineering of Tsinghua University, where she met her future husband Song Ping, a chemistry student and activist in the December 9th Movement against Japanese aggression in China. When the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937 and the Japanese army occupied Beijing, Chen and Song evacuated with Tsinghua University to Changsha in southern China, where she joined the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in December 1937. She later went with Song to the Communist headquarters in Yan'an. She studied at the CCP Central Party School and worked as Zhou Enlai's secretary in 1939. In 1940, Chen was sent by the Communist Party as a representative in the Kuomintang government in China's wartime capital Chongqing, and later Nanjing after the end of World War II. When the Chinese Civil War broke out, she was transferred to the Communist-held area in Northeast China, where she worked in education, including a stint as the principal of Harbin Girls' High School.  People's Republic of China  After the founding of the People's Republic of China, she returned to Tsinghua University in 1953. She worked for the next eight years at the university, successively as deputy dean, assistant president, and deputy party secretary. Future CCP general secretary and paramount leader Hu Jintao, then a Tsinghua student, was a prot√©g√© of hers and later promoted by her husband Song Ping. In 1961, she was transferred to Northwest China and served as vice minister of propaganda of Gansu Province. She returned to Beijing in 1981, and worked in the Research Office of the Secretariat of the Communist Party of China until her retirement in 1988. Chen was a delegate to the 1st National People's Congress in 1954 and participated in drafting the first Constitution of the People's Republic of China. She was also a delegate to the 3rd National People's Congress and the 7th Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).

It re-imagines the lives of Jack Sheppard, eighteenth-century English thief and jail-breaker, and his lover Edgeworth Bess.  Plot  The novel is structured as a story within a story. A 21st- century academic, Dr Voth, discovers a manuscript that claims to be the confessions of Jack Shepphard. The manuscript reveals that Shepphard (like Voth) is a transgender man, and describes his experience of transitioning gender. It also reveals that Bess is of South Asian (Lascar) descent and that she grew up in the Fens. The manuscript documents Shepphard's love affair with Bess, their criminal escapades, their memories of childhood, and their run-ins with authority. Voth's annotations to the manuscript begin as scholarly comments on its likely authenticity but soon become more personal, comically documenting his recent break-up and his difficulties at work. The novel offers satirical commentary on historical and contemporary political issues, including over-policing and surveillance, racism, the dredging of the Fens, and managerialism in 21st-century universities. In fictionalizing Shepphard's story, the novel continues a tradition established by Daniel Defoe, John Gay (The Beggar's Opera), Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill (The Threepenny Opera).  Critical reception  The novel was named a \\"book of the year\\" by the New Yorker, Huffington Post and Kirkus Reviews.

Here, by choosing securities that do not 'move' exactly together, the HM model shows investors how to reduce their risk. The HM model is also called mean-variance model due to the fact that it is based on expected returns (mean) and the standard deviation (variance) of the various portfolios. It is foundational to Modern portfolio theory. Assumptions  Markowitz made the following assumptions while developing the HM model: # Risk of a portfolio is based on the variability of returns from the said portfolio. # An investor is risk averse. # An investor prefers to increase consumption. # The investor's utility function is concave and increasing, due to their risk aversion and consumption preference. # Analysis is based on single period model of investment. # An investor either maximizes their portfolio return for a given level of risk or minimizes their risk for a given return. # An investor is rational in nature. To choose the best portfolio from a number of possible portfolios, each with different return and risk, two separate decisions are to be made, detailed in the below sections: # Determination of a set of efficient portfolios. # Selection of the best portfolio out of the efficient set. Methodology =Determining the efficient set= A portfolio that gives maximum return for a given risk, or minimum risk for given return is an efficient portfolio. Thus, portfolios are selected as follows: (a) From the portfolios that have the same return, the investor will prefer the portfolio with lower risk, and (b) From the portfolios that have the same risk level, an investor will prefer the portfolio with higher rate of return. Figure 1: Risk-return of possible portfolios As the investor is rational, they would like to have higher return. And as they are risk averse, they want to have lower risk. In Figure 1, the shaded area PVWP includes all the possible securities an investor can invest in. The efficient portfolios are the ones that lie on the boundary of PQVW. For example, at risk level x2, there are three portfolios S, T, U. But portfolio S is called the efficient portfolio as it has the highest return, y2, compared to T and U. All the portfolios that lie on the boundary of PQVW are efficient portfolios for a given risk level. The boundary PQVW is called the Efficient Frontier. All portfolios that lie below the Efficient Frontier are not good enough because the return would be lower for the given risk. Portfolios that lie to the right of the Efficient Frontier would not be good enough, as there is higher risk for a given rate of return. All portfolios lying on the boundary of PQVW are called Efficient Portfolios. The Efficient Frontier is the same for all investors, as all investors want maximum return with the lowest possible risk and they are risk averse. =Choosing the best portfolio= For selection of the optimal portfolio or the best portfolio, the risk-return preferences are analyzed. An investor who is highly risk averse will hold a portfolio on the lower left hand of the frontier, and an investor who isn‚Äôt too risk averse will choose a portfolio on the upper portion of the frontier. Figure 2: Risk-return indifference curves Figure 2 shows the risk-return indifference curve for the investors. Indifference curves C1, C2 and C3 are shown. Each of the different points on a particular indifference curve shows a different combination of risk and return, which provide the same satisfaction to the investors. Each curve to the left represents higher utility or satisfaction. The goal of the investor would be to maximize their satisfaction by moving to a curve that is higher. An investor might have satisfaction represented by C2, but if their satisfaction/utility increases, the investor then moves to curve C3 Thus, at any point of time, an investor will be indifferent between combinations S1 and S2, or S5 and S6. Figure 3: The Efficient Portfolio The investor's optimal portfolio is found at the point of tangency of the efficient frontier with the indifference curve. This point marks the highest level of satisfaction the investor can obtain. This is shown in Figure 3. R is the point where the efficient frontier is tangent to indifference curve C3, and is also an efficient portfolio. With this portfolio, the investor will get highest satisfaction as well as best risk-return combination (a portfolio that provides the highest possible return for a given amount of risk). Any other portfolio, say X, isn't the optimal portfolio even though it lies on the same indifference curve as it is outside the feasible portfolio available in the market. Portfolio Y is also not optimal as it does not lie on the best feasible indifference curve, even though it is a feasible market portfolio. Another investor having other sets of indifference curves might have some different portfolio as their best/optimal portfolio. All portfolios so far have been evaluated in terms of risky securities only, and it is possible to include risk-free securities in a portfolio as well. A portfolio with risk- free securities will enable an investor to achieve a higher level of satisfaction. This has been explained in Figure 4. Figure 4: The Combination of Risk-Free Securities with the Efficient Frontier and CML R1 is the risk- free return, or the return from government securities, as those securities are considered to have no risk for modeling purposes. R1PX is drawn so that it is tangent to the efficient frontier. Any point on the line R1PX shows a combination of different proportions of risk-free securities and efficient portfolios. The satisfaction an investor obtains from portfolios on the line R1PX is more than the satisfaction obtained from the portfolio P. All portfolio combinations to the left of P show combinations of risky and risk- free assets, and all those to the right of P represent purchases of risky assets made with funds borrowed at the risk-free rate. In the case that an investor has invested all their funds, additional funds can be borrowed at risk-free rate and a portfolio combination that lies on R1PX can be obtained. R1PX is known as the Capital Market Line (CML). This line represents the risk- return trade off in the capital market. The CML is an upward sloping line, which means that the investor will take higher risk if the return of the portfolio is also higher. The portfolio P is the most efficient portfolio, as it lies on both the CML and Efficient Frontier, and every investor would prefer to attain this portfolio, P. The P portfolio is known as the Market Portfolio and is also the most diversified portfolio. It consists of all shares and other securities in the capital market. In the market for portfolios that consists of risky and risk-free securities, the CML represents the equilibrium condition. The Capital Market Line says that the return from a portfolio is the risk-free rate plus risk premium. Risk premium is the product of the market price of risk and the quantity of risk, and the risk is the standard deviation of the portfolio. The CML equation is : : RP = IRF \\\\+ (RM ‚Äì IRF)œÉP/œÉM where, : RP = expected return of portfolio : RM = return on the market portfolio : IRF = risk-free rate of interest : œÉM = standard deviation of the market portfolio œÉP = standard deviation of portfolio (RM ‚Äì IRF)/œÉM is the slope of CML. (RM ‚Äì IRF) is a measure of the risk premium, or the reward for holding risky portfolio instead of risk-free portfolio. œÉM is the risk of the market portfolio. Therefore, the slope measures the reward per unit of market risk. The characteristic features of CML are: 1\\\\. At the tangent point, i.e. Portfolio P, is the optimum combination of risky investments and the market portfolio. 2\\\\. Only efficient portfolios that consist of risk free investments and the market portfolio P lie on the CML. 3\\\\. CML is always upward sloping as the price of risk has to be positive. A rational investor will not invest unless they know they will be compensated for that risk. Figure 5: CML and Risk-Free Lending and Borrowing Figure 5 shows that an investor will choose a portfolio on the efficient frontier, in the absence of risk-free investments. But when risk-free investments are introduced, the investor can choose the portfolio on the CML (which represents the combination of risky and risk-free investments). This can be done with borrowing or lending at the risk-free rate of interest (IRF) and the purchase of efficient portfolio P. The portfolio an investor will choose depends on their preference of risk. The portion from IRF to P, is investment in risk-free assets and is called Lending Portfolio. In this portion, the investor will lend a portion at risk-free rate. The portion beyond P is called Borrowing Portfolio, where the investor borrows some funds at risk-free rate to buy more of portfolio P. Demerits of the HM model 1\\\\. Unless positivity constraints are assigned, the Markowitz solution can easily find highly leveraged portfolios (large long positions in a subset of investable assets financed by large short positions in another subset of assets) , but given their leveraged nature the returns from such a portfolio are extremely sensitive to small changes in the returns of the constituent assets and can therefore be extremely 'dangerous'. Positivity constraints are easy to enforce and fix this problem, but if the user wants to 'believe' in the robustness of the Markowitz approach, it would be nice if better-behaved solutions (at the very least, positive weights) were obtained in an unconstrained manner when the set of investment assets is close to the available investment opportunities (the market portfolio) ‚Äì but this is often not the case. 2\\\\. Practically more vexing, small changes in inputs can give rise to large changes in the portfolio. Mean-variance optimization suffers from 'error maximization': 'an algorithm that takes point estimates (of returns and covariances) as inputs and treats them as if they were known with certainty will react to tiny return differences that are well within measurement error' . In the real world, this degree of instability will lead, to begin with, to large transaction costs, but it is also likely to shake the confidence of the portfolio manager in the model. 3\\\\. The amount of information (the covariance matrix, specifically, or a complete joint probability distribution among assets in the market portfolio) needed to compute a mean-variance optimal portfolio is often intractable and certainly has no room for subjective measurements ('views' about the returns of portfolios of subsets of investable assets) .

He is MƒÅori, of T≈´hoe descent. He is the first MƒÅori to win a Prime Minister's Science Prize. Academic career MƒÅtƒÅmua wrote his MA thesis on traditional T≈´hoe weaponry. His 2006 PhD at Massey Universitywas titled Te Reo PƒÅho: MƒÅori radio and language revitalisation. MƒÅtƒÅmua moved to the University of Waikato, rising to full professor of MƒÅori and Indigenous Studies.  Astronomy  MƒÅtƒÅmua's career in astronomy began in 1995 when as a university undergraduate he asked his grandfather Jim Moses (Timi RƒÅwiri MƒÅtƒÅmua) about Matariki, the MƒÅori New Year heralded by the rising of the Pleiades at dawn. Timi RƒÅwiri produced from a cupboard a 400-page manuscript written in Te Reo MƒÅori. The manuscript had been written over many years in the 19th century by Timi RƒÅwiri‚Äôs grandfather RƒÅwiri Te K≈çkau and father Te K≈çkau Himiona Te Pikik≈çtuku, who was a tohunga of T≈´hoe and NgƒÅti Pikiao. It was an astronomical record containing the names of 1000 stars and 103 constellations, as well as instructions for setting up a traditional house of astronomical learning or whare k≈çk≈çrangi. Timi RƒÅwiri told MƒÅtƒÅmua to share the knowledge it contained: \\"Knowledge hidden, he said, wasn‚Äôt knowledge at all.\\" MƒÅtƒÅmua has since written widely on Matariki, identifying the nine stars that MƒÅori perceived in the cluster, in contrast to the seven associated with the Pleiades in European tradition. His research has revealed that some of the MƒÅori astronomical lore recorded by ethnographer Elsdon Best is slated or incorrectly translated. The translation of the word Matariki to mean \\"little eyes\\" is one such error; the name in fact is derived from NgƒÅ mata o te ariki o TƒÅwhirimƒÅtea, the eyes of TƒÅwhirimƒÅtea, god of the winds. He has pointed out that the Matariki is often celebrated too early, when it is still below the horizon, as a result of a mismatch between the Gregorian solar calendar and the MƒÅori lunar/stellar calendar, where the dates for Matariki change every year. MƒÅtƒÅmua has been critical of the way Western scientific astronomy has ignored or belittled traditional MƒÅori knowledge. He intends to establish a MƒÅori observatory, based on a traditional observatory but incorporating modern knowledge and technology.  Science communication  MƒÅtƒÅmua regularly posts videos and podcasts on MƒÅori astronomy in both English and Te Reo MƒÅori, and has a large social media following: his Living by the Stars Facebook posts have over 20,000 followers, and his web series accumulated over one million views in four months. In 2019 he gave 21 presentations to a total audience of over 10,000 in New Zealand and Australia. On 30 June 2020 MƒÅtƒÅmua was awarded the 2019 Prime Minister's Science Communication Prize for his work writing and speaking about MƒÅori astronomy and Matariki.

The matches will be played under Twenty20 format and there will only be a women's tournament.  Background  The next Commonwealth Games will be held in 2022 in Birmingham, England, from 27 July to 7 August and will see 4,500 athletes taking part. Under Commonwealth Games rules, all core Commonwealth sports must be hosted but additional sports may be added by the local organising committee. In November 2018, the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) made a joint bid for a women's Twenty20 tournament to be included. In August 2019, the Commonwealth Games Federation announced that the bid had been successful after a vote of all 71 Commonwealth Games Associations with women's cricket being added to the 2022 programme along with beach volleyball and para table tennis. The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), as custodian of the Laws of Cricket, welcomed the move and hoped it would eventually lead to cricket's inclusion in the 2028 Summer Olympics.  Tournament  The tournament will be played in Twenty20 format with eight teams qualifying. Edgbaston Cricket Ground in Birmingham will be the venue for the matches. Though there were suggestions for matches to also be held at the County Cricket Ground, Derby, New Road, Worcester and Grace Road, Leicester, none of these were selected in the final confirmation.

History The barracks were built on the site of a swimming pool. The three-storey complex has two courtyards in the north and an open courtyard to the south. Facing towards the castle, the facade has an Avant-corps with round arches. The windows have a stone framing. The foyer and ballroom were designed with monumental stone pillars. Having been damaged during the war the building was repaired from 1948 to 1949, and from 1950 was used as a building for municipal schools. After Wiener Neustadt became a garrison again in 1956, the Austrian Army moved in on 14 September 1956. As the Feldj√§gerbataillon 1, which was moved to the barracks from Graz, was the first unit moved in, the barracks were referred to as Feldj√§gerkaserne. A few days after the first conscripts were moved into the barracks, the troops were moved to Burgenland in response to the revolution in Hungary, for border security. Between 15 and 20 December 1956, the Feldj√§gerbataillon was moved back to the barracks. During the following years, different units were stationed or set up here. On 20 December 1966, the barracks were officially named after the 18th-century Field Marshal Leopold Joseph von Daun as Daun barracks. Today the Daun barracks is run as a school battalion with two companies. Sources * : Kasernen, Soldaten, Ereignisse.

An offshoot of the Primitive Methodists, the Society used female and male preachers. Life Carr was born in Market Rasen in 1783 to a poor family. Rebecca, her mother, died when she was young and she was brought up as a Congregationalist by her aunt and her father, Tom, who was a builder. When she was eighteen her boyfriend died and she had a breakdown. At this point she became a Wesleyan, influenced by Zachariah Taft, who was a supporter of women in the church. Carr became known for her preaching and she would tour England evangelizing for Methodism. She was said to travel 300 miles in some months. In 1816 she went to hear Sarah Kirkland speak in Nottingham and she was attracted to Primitive Methodism. in 1818 she met Hannah Woolhouse and Sarah Eland. She and Eland returned to Carr's Lincolnshire where they created a revival. Carr was warned off allowing \\"ranters\\" into her meetings, but she reacted against this and went to Hull to join the Primitive Methodists. Woodhouse Chapel in Leeds In 1821 William Clowes was so successful in creating converts in Leeds that Carr, Sarah Ecland and Martha Williams were sent from Hull to join him. These new arrivals caused some problems as they were both popular and undisciplined moving from circuit to circuit as the will took them. Carr eventually founded the Female Revivalist Society in the poor area of Leeds. Her group would meet in cottages. In Morley the group caused a schism in the local Primitive Methodists as the women wanted to hear preachers from the Female Revivalists. In 1838 Carr and her friend Martha Williams published \\"A Selection of Hymns for the use of the Female Revivalist Methodists. A new edition, with additional hymns\\". Close up of Ann Carr's grave recording her as the \\"Foundress of the sect of Female Revivalists\\" When Carr died the financial problems of the church caused it to collapse. Martha Williams wrote her biography the same year as Memoirs of the life and character of Ann Carr: containing an account of her conversion to God, her devoted labours and her happy death. The monument that was placed on her grave recording her as the \\"Foundress of the sect of Female Revivalists\\" was recognised as part of a listed monument in Leeds in 1976.

In 1956 he testified to a United States Senate committee regarding an international communist conspiracy he alleged was underway, the objective of which was the admission of the People's Republic of China to the United Nations and the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and China. According to Cumby, this was to be partially accomplished through the brainwashing of American POWs prior to their repatriation to the United States; they would, in turn, create a nucleus of domestic support for China-friendly policies within the U.S. Early life and education Bert Cumby was born in Corinth, Mississippi. As an adolescent he became acquainted with Robert Church Jr., the president of Solvent Savings Bank and Trust and a member of the national board of the NAACP, who was mentoring his friend Lonnie Brisco. Cumby graduated from Fisk University and went to work as a funeral director. In the 1930s he spoke and wrote about politics; following a speech he gave to raise funds for the NAACP, the Pittsburgh Courier described him as an oratorical \\"wonder\\". In 1942 he left civilian employment and voluntarily enlisted in the United States Army. In a 1942 Detroit Free Press article, Cumby was quoted as saying his impetus for enlisting was because he \\"wanted to fight for a country that has done more for me than any country in the world\\". He was deployed to Europe and fought with the 92nd Infantry Division (Colored), seeing action in Italy as an infantry platoon leader. Cumby was an officer in the 92nd Infantry Division (Colored) during World War II. Pictured is Major General Edward Almond inspecting soldiers of the 92nd Division. Career =Military Intelligence Corps= After the war, Cumby was assigned intelligence duties and played an important role during the Korean War in the debriefing of returning American prisoners of war (POWs) following Operation Big Switch. He was later called before the United States Senate to answer questions of alleged communist indoctrination of American POWs, during which he testified to the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations that roughly one-third of all American POWs had collaborated \\"to some degree\\" with their North Korean and Chinese captors, often due to thought reform overseen by officers of the Soviet Army as part of an international communist conspiracy. According to Cumby, POWs were required to attend a series of twelve classes on Marxism-Leninism, while coursework beyond the twelfth lecture was voluntary. Those prisoners who elected to continue instruction were identified as a \\"core\\" element for the alleged indoctrination regime. Cumby also testified that, based on his analysis of the curricula of the advanced courses, he had concluded that the ultimate strategic vision of the People's Republic of China was to assume China's seat in the United Nations and to establish diplomatic relations with the United States. Cumby alleged that the pre-repatriation indoctrination of American POWs was intended to create a nucleus of post-war civilians who would advocate in the United States for these objectives. Cumby was among the interrogators of Claude Batchelor. He also provided testimony for the prosecution in the trial of a former POW for collaboration; to protect his identity he appeared in court with his face concealed and was referred to only as \\"Mr. X\\". Later in his career he was an instructor at the United States Army Intelligence Center and served as head of research for the Military Intelligence Corps. =U.S. Foreign Service= Cumby retired from the U.S. Army in 1961 at the rank of lieutenant colonel and entered the United States Foreign Service, holding overseas postings in Thailand and Spain. Personal life =Family= Cumby was married. With his wife, Esther, he had one biological son and also adopted an adolescent boy from Luxembourg, the adoption facilitated by the socialite and United States Ambassador to Luxembourg Perle Mesta. Esther Cumby was a high school classmate of Agatha Davis, the wife of Gen. Benjamin O. Davis Jr.; in his autobiography, Benjamin Davis described Bert Cumby as \\"a good friend\\". Esther Cumby, a third generation New Englander, was a schoolteacher by profession. Early in her career she volunteered to teach in a segregated school. According to Cumby, upon accepting the assignment, she \\"knew practically nothing of the separate schools for Negroes\\" and had volunteered \\"not because of any great race consciousness ... but because the pay scale was more attractive\\". =Retirement and death= Following his final retirement, Cumby remained active with the Association of Former Intelligence Officers. A resident of Silver Spring, Maryland, in 1976 he campaigned for the reelection of United States Senator John Glenn Beall Jr. He died of cancer at Walter Reed Army Medical Center at age 69.

Teaching in London and Oxford, he published extensively on the medieval German lyric and Old High German literature, and translated four of the major Middle High German verse narratives. Life Cyril Edwards was born in Neston, Cheshire, the son of William Henry Edwards, a gardener at the University of Liverpool‚Äôs Ness Botanic Gardens in the Wirral, and Edith Mary Edwards (n√©e Purchase). From Calday Grange Grammar School he went up to Oxford, graduating in 1970 with a degree in German from Jesus College. He went on to do research, completing a doctoral thesis on Konrad von W√ºrzburg under Ruth Harvey in 1975. In 1976 he took up a Lectureship in German at Goldsmiths College, University of London, where he taught Medieval German Literature and History of the German Language. At Goldsmiths he was responsible for organizing three conferences devoted to Interdisciplinary Medieval Studies, which brought together historians, literary scholars and linguists. He published over 30 journal articles and book chapters, with a particular focus on Minnesang and the Arthurian Romance. A number of his papers on Old High German literature were collected in the volume The Beginnings of German Literature: comparative and interdisciplinary approaches to Old High German. A characteristic feature of his scholarship was a concern with examining the original manuscripts of medieval texts, which led to visits to a wide range of libraries and archives in continental Europe. On a research trip to the Benedictine abbey of Kremsm√ºnster in Upper Austria, he identified a previously unrecognized manuscript page (Cod. 248) in the abbey's library as a song by the Minnes√§nger Heinrich von Morungen. This led to a series of publications on Morungen's songs, culminating in an edited volume devoted to the \\"Narcissus song\\" (MF 145,1). (At his death Edwards was preparing an edition and translation of a late 15th century housebook (Cod. 264) held by the Kremsm√ºnster Abbey.) In 1994, \\"despite his record of committed and successful teaching and his internationally recognised distinction in research\\", Goldsmiths made him redundant on \\"thematic grounds\\", a move which gave rise to protests from colleagues in the UK and overseas. Relocating to Abingdon in 1995, he became a lecturer in German at St Peter's College and Senior Research Fellow of the university's Faculty of Medieval and Modern Languages. In the following years he published translations of four of the great narrative poems of the Middle High German classical period: Wolfram von Eschenbach's Parzival, the Nibelungenlied and Hartmann von Aue's two Arthurian romances, Erec and Iwein. Both the Parzival and the Nibelungenlied translations were published in the Oxford World's Classics series. His interests and expertise went beyond the medieval: at Oxford he also taught German Cinema, and he contributed the article on Theodor Fontane to the Dictionary of National Biography. His later publications include two cook books and a book of poems. He was also a tiddlywinks player of some standing, representing both Oxford University and England, and at one point ranked 11th in the world. Cyril Edwards died of a heart attack, aged 71, on 15 July 2019 in Abingdon. Professor Nigel Palmer wrote, \\"Cyril was a remarkable figure, a lovable eccentric, a fine scholar with a wide range of cultural interests who had a difficult career. His translations have played an important part in keeping interest in medieval German literature alive in the English-speaking world.\\" Publications =Medieval literature= Books Selected articles  =Translations= Middle High German literature * **Paperback:  Modern works =Other works= * References Category:1947 births Category:2019 deaths Category:People from Neston Category:People educated at Calday Grange Grammar School Category:Alumni of Jesus College, Oxford Category:Academics of Goldsmiths, University of London Category:Academics of the University of Oxford Category:British medievalists Category:Germanists Category:British translators Category:German‚ÄìEnglish translators Category:20th-century translators Category:21st-century translators ","title":"Cyril Edwards"},{"id":"61504534","text":"Roberto Nicol√°s Fern√°ndez Fagundez (born 2 March 1998) is a Uruguayan professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Uruguayan Primera Divisi√≥n club CA F√©nix.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. History The Aldrich, Godfrey, and White Block was constructed and owned by three prominent Grand Rapids civic leaders: Moses V. Aldrich, Freeman Godfrey, and George H. White. Moses V. Aldfich was born in Macedon, New York in 1829, and came to Grand Rapids in 1855 to enter into partnership with his father-in-law in a manufacturing firm. The business thrived, and Aldrich went into banking and real estate, as well as serving as mayor of Grand Rapids for consecutive terms in 1868 - 1870. Freeman Godfrey was born in Vershire, Vermont in 1825, and worked as a contractor laying track for the railroads beginning in 1851. In 1856 he arrived in Grand Rapids to construct a line for the Detroit and Milwaukee Railroad (later the Detroit, Grand Haven and Milwaukee Railway), and in 1858 began work on the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad. In 1860, Godfrey opened a gypsum quarry in Grand Rapisd with his brother, and in 1865 bought a one-third share of a plaster quarry and mills owned by George H. White and Company. George H. White was born in 1822 and came to Grand Rapids from western New York in 1842. He began as a clerk and then partner in the general store of Amos Rathbone. The partners also owned land, and in the 1870s began developing in the city of Grand Rapids. In 1872, Moses V. Aldrich purchased the property where this building now stands from St. Andrew's Catholic Church for $56,000, which funded the church's move to what is now St. Andrew's Cathedral. Aldrich sold one-third of the property each to George H. White and Freeman Godfrey. The three men hired local architect John Grady to design a commercial block at the site. In 1874, the old St. Andrew's was demolished and the firm of Farr & Vincent began construction on the new commercial block. It was completed at the end of the year, and new tenants began moving in in 1875. The first tenants of the building included both business and residential renters. Residential spaces were discontinued in 1916. In 1948 the building was purchased by the Siegel Company, which sold women's clothing, and was renamed the Siegel Building. The building was redeveloped in 1999. Description The Aldrich, Godfrey, and White Block is four story Italianate structure post and beam construction, located on an entire city block with two main facades. The exterior brick walls are faced in Buena Vista sandstone on one main facade and in limestone on the other. The regularly spaced double-hing windows are separated by pilasters; windows on the fourth floor have pedimented hood moldings. The building is topped with an ornate projecting metal cornice. An entryway in one facade leads to the upper floors; above this are paired double-hung windows on each floor.

The movie is a remake of the 2014 Tamil film Jigarthanda, which itself was inspired by the South Korean movie A Dirty Carnival.https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/southern-movies-inspired- without-credit-heres-list-20556https://www.indiaglitz.com/the-thin-line- between-plagiarism--inspiration-tamil- news-111764.htmlhttps://scroll.in/reel/809831/revealed-why-indian-filmmakers- love-south-korean-films The film features Varun Tej, Atharvaa, Pooja Hegde, and Mirnalini Ravi. This film marks the Telugu debut of Atharvaa and Ravi. The movie was originally titled Valmiki but after several controversies and a court case, the title was changed to Gaddalakonda Ganesh.  Plot  In a cinema studio, an assistant director who aspires to become a film director named Abhilash, aka Abhi (Atharvaa) gets insulted by one of the directors, there he challenges that he will become a good director with a good film in a few days. Another producer (Raghu Babu) likes Abhi's hard work and suggests that he do a gangster movie. He decides to direct the biopic of a gangster. In search of a gangster, he finds the ruthless gangster named Gaddalakonda Ganesh, aka Gani (Varun Tej) lives in the town of Gaddalakonda. Abhi lands in Gaddalakonda and starts learning about Gani with the help of his friend Chintakayyi (Satya). Abhi traps Bujjama (Mirnalini Ravi), the granddaughter of Gani's chef (Annapoorna) and she falls in love with Abhi, who realises this and reciprocates her feelings. After some hilarious scenes, Abhi and Chintakayyi befriends Thuppaki, one of Gani's henchmen. Later the duo learns that the Thuppaki is helping Prabhakar, one of Gani's rivals to kill Gani for the position of Gani. However, Gani acknowledges this, plans and kill Thuppaki. Gani also kidnaps Abhi and his friend. Abhi says the truth and Gani feels happy that they were taking the biopic of him and he narrates the whole story including his criminal activities. From childhood, Gani starts beating people for money. Later he does settlements for M.L.A. Gani, also a fan of Sridevi. Later Gani falls for Sridevi aka Devi (Pooja Hegde), an computer student but she doesn't accepts him because of his aimless behaviour. Later she also reciprocates his feelings after he rescues her from ragging. But Devi's father refuses to accept their relationship due to the caste system. Devi and Gani decided to elope from Gaddalakonda and Gani refuses to kill someone for the M.L.A because he wants to leave behind his rowdyism. The M.L.A informs police about Gani's whereabouts. The police come to the railway station and beat up Gani while Devi's father threatens Devi to marry the bridegroom whom he chose, otherwise he will order police to kill Gani. Devi reluctantly marries to police officer who belongs to her caste. Another M.L.A, with the lawyer comes to the police station and says that Gani's M.L.A informs police of Gani's whereabouts. He then goes to his M.L.A and slits his throat in front of his mother (Supriya Pathak). Then Gani's mother complains against him. But Gani claims in court that his mother was mute. From that day onwards she refuses to speak with Gani. Now, Bujjama learns about Abhi and confronts the latter. In the party for Abhi returning to Hyderabad, Bujjama expected Gani to act as a protagonist in his biopic. Gani agrees against to Abhi's wishes. However Abhi changes his mind by listening the theatre operator's (Tanikella Bharani) words and his passion about directing a movie, but he can't do it due to his bad adaptation. Then Abhi appoints the acting coach Muni Manikyam (Brahmaji) for Gani and his gang. Later the acting coach praises Gani for his acting skill due to his ruthless behaviour and also the acting coach humiliated Gani and his gang while they were training. The shooting begins. The title of the film is Settimaar. By understanding the difficulties in directing the movie, Bujjama reconciles with Abhi. But things take a turn when Gani also changes his mind and falls for Bujjama. In the audio launch, Gani announced that he gifted a villa to Abhi and wants to marry Bujjama. The movie is released and opens with a tremendous response. At the same time, Abhi elopes with Bujjama. Gani comes to know about this and decides to kill Abhi. But meanwhile, Gani's craze increases due to his acting skills. The people who fear Gani are now asking for selfies with him and his autograph. The little daughter of Thuppaki, who also fears when Gani comes to fondle her, gives a kiss and praises his acting skills. Gani's mother who refused to talk to him in the past speaks to him. By seeing all these, Gani spares Abhi and Bujjama and gives up his rowdy carrier. Prabhakar's henchman (Subbaraju) asks him to include him in Gani's next movie which is being directed by Sukumar. Abhi's paternal uncle (Devi Prasad) takes Gani's criminal evidence (tape recorder and files) and hands it over to the D.C.P, who turns out to be Devi's husband. Devi takes the evidence (tape recorder) and grinds it in a blender. When the D.C.P asks Devi why she had ground the evidence, She replies that it's because the D.C.P couldn't keep his promise to not incriminate Gani for which in return Devi wouldn't think about Gani. This indicates that Devi still loves Gani. Later Devi also praises him. Abhi uses Gani's gang for threatening stars like Nithin to act in his film. Abhi marries Bujjama and Gani remains single.

Its former Hoffmann kiln was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1985 and is now operated as a museum under the name Ringovnen. History One of the farms in the village of Nive was in 1707 closed down by Queen Louise and the site was instead used for the establishment of a brickworks which was used for manufacturing bricks for the construction of Hirschholm Palace. The brickyard was after a while leased by master mason Lars Eriksen (born 1753). It returned to the crown after his death but was after a few years then leased by tanner Hans Peter Frode from Helsing√∏r. In 1765, it was ceded to J√∏rgen Birch in return for the payment of an annual fee \\"as long as the necessary materials for the operation of the brickyard was available at the site\\". The next owner was Jacob Kielskov. He was in 1781 exempted from payment of the annual fee since the operations were no longer profitable and was therefore discontinued. The brickyard changed hands many times over the next 80 years. In the 1840s, the continuous production of bricks was finally revived. The brickyard was modernized and a steam engine was installed in 1857. In 1862, Nivaagaard was acquired by Alfred Hage. Copenhagen was at the moment experiencing a major construction boom and with its strategic location on the coast north of the city, the brickyard proved a good investment. With the loss of Schlesvig in the Second Schleswig War, Denmark also lost control of many of its most important brickworks. A long kiln was constructed in 1869 and Hage commissioned Friedrich Eduard Hoffmann to construct a Hoffmann kiln in 1870. Hage also constructed a long pier which was used for the shipment of bricks to Copenhagen. Nivaagaard and the associated brickyard were after Hage's death in 1974 continued by his son Johannes Hage. He once again modernized the operations in 1918. Johannes Hage died in 1923 and left Nivaagaard to Den Hageske Stiftelse. The Hoffmann kiln remained in use until 1967. The brickworks closed in 1981.

It was released in 1989. Background Anything Goes has been presented in many different versions in the theatre, in the cinema and on record. The goal of John McGlinn's work on the piece was to present it as nearly as possible in accordance with Cole Porter's original wishes. His edition adhered to that of the musical's first performance in Boston on 5 November 1934, except that instead of presenting the Boston score's \\"There's no cure like travel\\" in full, he abbreviated it to \\"Bon Voyage\\", the version of the number that was performed at the musical's New York premi√®re sixteen days after its out-of- town try-out. Several of the show's original orchestrations had been lost, but McGlinn was able to recreate them at least approximately by soliciting the help of Hans Spialek, who, together with Robert Russell Bennett, had composed them. Spialek reproduced his and his colleague's work of half a century earlier as well as he was able to; the few passages that he left incomplete on his death were finished by Russell Warner and by McGlinn himself. The album includes the whole of \\"There's no cure like travel\\" in an appendix, as well as two numbers that were discarded during the show's rehearsal period. \\"Waltz down the aisle\\" was a mock-romantic duet intended for Act 1, Scene 6. \\"Kate the Great\\", meant to follow \\"Bon Voyage\\", was dropped because it was thought too risqu√©. Ethel Merman, the first Reno Sweeney, was reluctant to sing the line \\"She made the maid who made the room\\" lest its implication of lesbianism offend her mother. \\"Oh, baby,\\" Spialek recalled, \\"dat's a durr-ty song! Ettel vouldn't sing it!\\" Recording The album was recorded digitally in August 1988 in CTS Studios, Wembley, London.Porter, Cole: Anything Goes, cond. John McGlinn, EMI Records CD, CDC7 49848-2, 1989 Cover art The cover of the album was designed by FM Design, and features an illustration by Bob Murdoch. Critical reception =Reviews= Cole Porter in 1934, the year in which Anything Goes was composed Andrew Lamb reviewed the album on CD in Gramophone in December 1989, comparing it with recent cast recordings of stagings on BroadwayPorter, Cole: Anything Goes, Broadway cast, RCA CD, RD 87769 and in LondonPorter, Cole: Anything Goes, 1989 London cast, First Night Records/Pinnacle CD, CAST CD18. John McGlinn's disc, he wrote, was wholly different from its rivals. They were recordings of a production (common to both CDs) in which the musical's book had been reworked and its score reorchestrated, and into which numbers from other Cole Porter shows had been inserted. As in his version of Jerome Kern's Show Boat [see Show Boat (John McGlinn recording) for details], McGlinn had followed a philosophy of historical authenticity, striving to produce \\"[as] complete as possible a representation of the original material, with some interesting deleted material in an appendix.\\" As he explained in the lengthy booklet accompanying his CD, his disc was the fruit of musical archaeology in which he had dug up orchestrations from the show's birth in 1934 that had been lost for several decades. So intent was he on doing justice to the musical that when he came across a number which had been discarded before an orchestration of it had been undertaken, he had persuaded one of Porter's colleagues to orchestrate it from scratch, even though the musician in question, Hans Spialek, was 88 years old and afflicted with cancer. McGlinn's efforts had created an album that sounded radically different from the comparison discs. For one thing, his orchestra was bigger than theirs, with less prominent brass. More conspicuously, although his readings of \\"Bon voyage\\", \\"Where are the men?\\" and \\"There'll always be a lady fair\\" were animated, his tempos were usually slower than modern audiences were used to. This was not because of some whim of his - he had imitated the pacing of the show's earliest cast recordings. His musicians were almost all satisfactory. Kim Criswell was in no way inferior to Broadway's Patti LuPone or London's Elaine Page, and Cris Groenendaal likewise was the equal of his counterparts. McGlinn had been \\"inspired\\", too, when he had turned to the elderly Jack Gilford for the character part of Moonface Martin (although Pinnacle's Bernard Cribbins also deserved praise for his \\"clearly projected\\" version of the role). And \\"the Ambrosian Chorus sing and the London Symphony Orchestra play as though they were born to music such as this\\". The album's only defect was its casting of Frederica von Stade as Hope Harcourt - \\"Her soprano does really seem a shade too operatic for the piece\\". In sum, the RCA and Pinnacle discs were rewarding mementos of the production that they documented, and people who had last heard Porter's show in theatres in London or New York might find McGlinn's way with it initially disconcerting. But anyone who cherished vintage recordings of the work or who took the view that the orchestration of a musical was essential to its quiddity would \\"find this McGlinn version irresistible\\".Lamb, Andrew: Gramophone, December 1989, p. 1217 P. G. Wodehouse in 1930 Lamb revisited the album in Gramophone in October 1990, withdrawing the only criticism that he had levelled at it ten months earlier. \\"Frederica von Stade\\", he conceded, \\"is appropriately cast in a role originally assigned to an opera singer.\\"Lamb, Andrew: Gramophone, October 1990, p. 728 Roy Hemming reviewed the album on CD in Stereo Review in January 1990. John McGlinn, he wrote, had given listeners the chance to hear what vintage recordings of Anything Goes would have sounded like if their producers had had access to digital technology. Unlike the recent staging at Lincoln Center, his album was loyal to what Cole Porter had written. Transplants from other Porter shows were eschewed, and \\"Buddie beware\\" and \\"What a joy to be young\\", sometimes victims of the blue pencil, were included. His soloists had both strengths and weaknesses. The best of them were the \\"splendid\\" Cris Groenendaal as Billy and Frederica von Stade as a \\"gorgeously and unaffectedly\\" sung Hope. Their duet, \\"All through the night\\", and her \\"What a joy to be young\\" were without question the best two tracks on the album. As Reno Sweeney, the musical's most important role, Kim Criswell sang with \\"verve and clarity, but also with tones that too often become strident and whiny\\". Jack Gilford's great age had enfeebled his voice beyond the point where he could sing Moonface Martin's music adequately. Conducting, McGlinn was \\"the clear star of this production, holding everything together with a winning blend of light-handed snap, dash and genuine lilt.\\" His \\"spine-tingling\\" album was a \\"vivid, authentic superbly recorded\\" CD that was an example of how the classics of American musical theatre should be recorded.Hemming, Roy: Stereo Review, January 1990, pp. 111-112 The album was also reviewed in Opera Now in April 1991: \\"Cole Porter addicts, look no further.

Swiggy is based in Bangalore, India, and as of March 2019, was operating in 100 Indian cities. In early 2019, Swiggy expanded into general product deliveries under the name Swiggy Stores. In September 2019, Swiggy launched instant pickup and drop service Swiggy Go. The service is used for a diverse array of items, including laundry and document or parcel deliveries to business clients and retail customers.  History  In 2013, the two founders, Nandan Reddy and Sriharsha Majety, designed an e-commerce website called Bundl to facilitate courier service and shipping within India. Bundl was halted, and was rebranded to enter the food delivery market. At the time, the food delivery sector was in turmoil as several notable startups, such as Foodpanda (later acquired by Ola Cabs), TinyOwl (later acquired by Zomato) and Ola Cafe (later closed) were struggling. Majety and Reddy approached Rahul Jaimini, formerly with Myntra, and founded Swiggy and parent holding company Bundl Technologies in 2014. The company built a dedicated delivery network and grew rapidly, primarily driven by the focus on logistics and locking in key resources. In May 2020, Swiggy laid off 1100 employees during the Covid-19 pandemic. In August 2020, the company launched their groceries delivery platform called InstaMart.  Investments and acquisitions  In 2015, the company began attracting external investments. The first was a $2 million investment from Accel and SAIF Partners, along with an additional investment from Norwest Venture Partners. The next year, Swiggy raised $15 million from new and existing investors, including Bessemer Venture Partners and Harmony Partners. In 2017, Naspers led an $80 million funding round into Swiggy. Swiggy received $100 million from China-based Meituan-Dianping and Naspers in 2018 and a string of investments boosted the company's valuation to over a $1 billion. In February 2019, Swiggy acquired Bengaluru-based AI startup Kint.io. In April 2020, Swiggy received around $43 million funding which valued the company at $3.6 billion. Swiggy acquired Bangalore-based Asian food start-up 48East in 2017. Swiggy later acquired Mumbai-based Scootsy Logistics, a struggling food and fashion delivery service. It also went on to acquire a milk delivery start-up in Mumbai called SuprDaily in an all cash deal. In 2019, the company invested Rs 31 crore in Mumbai-based ready-to-eat food brand Fingerlix. Swiggy planned to transition Scootsy‚Äôs partners, fleet and nudge consumers to its app and shut Scootsy by June-end 2020.  Partnerships  Swiggy has partnered with Burger King to provide delivery services. It has also partnered with Google Local Guide to facilitate customer reviews, and with Sodexo to enable customers for paying through meal cards. Swiggy has partnered with Indifi Technologies to facilitate a financing program for partner restaurants. 'Swiggy Money' is a digital wallet launched by Swiggy in partnership with ICICI Bank. The costumers who do not have an account in the ICICI bank can also avail the services. It will allow the customers to store money to pay for the orders.https://cio.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/enterprise-services-and- applications/swiggy-launches-digital-wallet-in-tie-up-with-icici-bank/76723697 References Category:Online marketplaces of India Category:Indian companies established in 2014 Category:Retail companies established in 2014 Category:Transport companies established in 2014 Category:Internet properties established in 2014 Category:Online food ordering Category:Companies based in Bangalore ","title":"Swiggy"},{"id":"61505264","text":"Fancy Dress is a 2019 Indian Malayalam Language comedy film directed by Ranjith Saccariya and produced by Guinnes Pakru.

Life  Samuel Kunz was born on August 21, 1921, in Russia. Though an ethnic German, he served initially in the Soviet Red Army. After having been captured by the German Wehrmacht, he was given the choice to stay at the Chelm prisoner war camp or to cooperate with the Germans. Kunz chose to work with the Nazis and was sent to Trawniki, an SS training camp. There he met John Demjanjuk. After his training, Samuel Kunz was sent to Belzec extermination camp as a camp guard from January 1942 to July 1943. When the Nazis closed the Belzec camp, Kunz was transferred to the Flossenburg concentration camp where he remained until the liberation by the Allies.Samuel Kunz Trial International, Retrieved 13 August 2019 Kunz, who lived in Germany after the end of the Second World War, worked as a carpenter for the Federal Ministry for Regional Planning, Construction and Urban Development (today: Federal Ministry for the Interior, Building and Community) and received German citizenship.

A new enterprise Offices, depot entrance and gasholders, Courtenay Place 1879 Miramar plant November 1950 The gas company's promoters first met in December 1869 inspired by the proposals of local engineer J Rees George. The provisional board were W. B. Rhodes, C. J. Pharazyn, J. Johnston, F. A. Krull and T. M. Stewart. Pharazyn was made the first chairman and George the first manager and engineer. J. E. Nathan, W. H. Levin, Edward Pearce and A. P. Stewart joined the other promoters to make the first board of directors. It was empowered by the Wellington Gas Company Act 1870 to supply coal gas through pipelines and other facilities which might require breaking up Wellington's public streets and opening its drains.New Zealand Acts As Enacted The gasworks were erected on the northern or beach side of Courtenay Place by Tory Street and the town was first lit by gas on 21 April, 1871.The History Of Coal Gas In Wellington.

Evening Post 1 April 1919 Page 10 Marketing Ownership of a small block of shares entitled a domestic consumer to a substantial discount on their gas bill as well as a dividend. Accordingly the shares were very widely held. Manufacture Coal gas is manufactured by the process of destructive distillation of coal in a retort leaving a residue of coke. Destructive distillation of a tonne of coal can produce 400 m3 of coal gas, 700 kg of coke, 100 litres of liquor ammonia and 50 litres of coal tar. =Courtenay Place= At Courtenay Place the coal was shovelled by hand into horizontal retorts made of fireclay. Very hot fires distilled the coal gas from the coal inside the retort and left the glowing coke behind. Extraction of the coke by long iron rakes required the gas-worker to face the white hot coke and pull it out towards him with the rake. To be a gas-worker a man had to be strong physically and constitutionally and this part of the work was very arduous. =Miramar= Coal was shipped from mines at Newcastle, New South Wales and on the West Coast to a special coal wharf in Evans Bay. It was trucked by rail a short distance to the company's gasworks through a cutting in the concealing range of hills. Only a handful of men were required to work Miramar's retorts, vertical bottles of fireclay opened at both top and bottom when required. The coal went in automatically from overhead bunkers and stayed in the retort about twelve hours by which time all the gas had been driven out of it and the residue was pure coke or carbon. With vertical retorts there was no drawing out of the hot coke by iron rake. Instead, the gas worker operated a few levers, turned a handle, and away came a torrent of incandescent coke falling into an automatic conveyor under a heavy spray of water. The gas had to undergo several processes of cleansing and purification before it was added to the gasholder. It went first to the condenser where the gas passed through water which removed most of the tar. A big rotary extractor next took the remainder of the tar and the ammonia. Finally, to remove the sulphur, which comes through from the coal in the shape of sulphuretted hydrogen, the gas was pumped through water containing quantities of red oxide of iron. The automatic conveyors and other appliances were powered by electricity generated on site by three gas engines, other equipment was powered by separate small steam engines. Activities included the manufacture of cookers, bath heaters, washing coppers, arc lamps, gas fires, circulators, toasters etc. Electricity Electric light was introduced in 1890 but it seemed to have little effect on the growth of gas consumption. Natural gas Coal gas was replaced by natural gas first piped from offshore wells at Kapuni, Taranaki in 1970.

Seventeen of West Virginia's 34 state senators were up for election. West Virginia Senate districts each have two elected representatives. State senators serve staggered four-year terms in West Virginia, with one senator from each district up in even-numbered years corresponding to presidential election years (most recently held in 2016), and the other up in even-numbered years corresponding to presidential midterm years. Primary elections in the state were held on May 8. After the previous 2016 state elections, Republicans held a majority in the Senate, holding 22 seats to the Democrats' 12. The Republican Party had long been the minority party in the Mountain State, but the decline of the strength of coal worker unions, the Democratic Party's increasing focus on environmentalism, the unpopularity of President Barack Obama, and the increasing social conservatism of the Republican Party have helped the GOP solidify power in the state rapidly since 2000. Despite the high popularity of President Donald Trump within the state and his 42-point margin of victory there in 2016, the Democrats gained two seats in the West Virginia Senate in 2018. This can be attributed to the competitive U.S. Senate race at the top of the ticket (which was won by incumbent Democrat Joe Manchin), the increasing insulation of the West Virginia Democratic Party from the national Democratic Party (particularly on social issues, such as abortion), and a strong year for the Democratic Party nationally, in which they gained control of the U.S. House of Representatives.

The grand opening was held at 4:00pm on Tuesday, October 25, 1940. Facilities =Building and Dome= The building is a stone structure, being 31 feet by 45 feet in horizontal dimension, made of Credit Valley Limestone, and trimmed with Indiana Sandstone. The building was designed by local architect O. Roy Moore, and built by the Putherbough Company. The dome was fabricated by Perkin Elmer Corporation in New York, shipped in pieces, and assembled on site. =Telescopes=  The 254 mm refractor  The purple refractor The brass refractor telescope, finders, German equatorial mount, and pier were purchased from Perkin Elmer Corporation of New York for the sum of $7500 CDN. The objective is a crown and flint achromatic lens, the glass having been poured by Chance Brothers of England. The (then) U.S. firm Bausch and Lomb was first contracted to pour the glass for the objective lens, but because of the war effort was not able to fulfill its commitment. The best guess is that the lens was ground and polished by Halley Mogey (private family communication), the first employee of Perkin Elmer Corporation and son of famed telescope maker William Mogey. The telescope tube is brass, having a focal length of 4386mm, which yields a speed of f/17.2. The telescope is fitted with 25mm and 90mm finders. The 203 mm Schmidt camera When the large refractor was shipped to Canada, Perkin Elmer included the Schmidt camera at no extra charge, even though it was apparently not originally ordered. It is said that because of the war effort, Perkin Elmer was shifting its focus to military contracts and hence stopped its production of retail telescopes. The telescope is a classic Schmidt camera, having a 203 mm diameter corrector plate, with a 300 mm diameter spherical mirror (an 8\\"/12\\" design). A small sliding door in the side of the instrument allows the loading of a circular piece of photographic film, mounted in a film holder. The provenance of this camera is presently unknown. James Gilbert Baker of Harvard University was a consultant for Perkin Elmer in 1940 in which year he developed his own version of the camera, to be known as the Baker-Schmidt camera. He may well have had his hands on this particular instrument while he was a junior fellow at Harvard University at the time Perkin Elmer was founded in 1937 incorporated in Dec. 1939) The 300 mm Cassegrain reflector This telescope was purchased by William H. Wehlau in 1958 and was installed onto the refractor for the purpose of extending the photometric capabilities of the observatory. A new photometer was constructed and first deployed in 1960. The telescope has a 300 mm diameter parabolic mirror and has a focal length of 5232 mm, yielding a speed of f/17.2. The manufacturer of this instrument is not known. Gibbs Heliochronometer Gibbs HeliochronometerIn 1906 astronomer and engineer George James Gibbs applied for a patent for what he called a \\"Universal Equinoctial Mean Time Heliochronometer\\", basically a fancy sundial. In the same year he formed a partnership with Pilkington to sell the instrument as the Pilkington-Gibbs Heliochronometer. About 1,000 were made. The instrument at Western is stamped No. 953. A cam device on the instrument takes into account the equation of time, thereby converting local solar time to within about a minute of mean solar time. This instrument, along with a Ginko tree were presented to the university by the Arts Class of 1925, the first class to graduate from the newly finished University College building. The tree and heliochronometer were originally placed on the northeast lawn of University College. The heliochronometer was subsequently moved in front of Cronyn Observatory in 1952. After also being moved, the Ginko tree now thrives in its original location, turning a blazing yellow in about the first or second week of November. =Classroom= Building renovations of 1996 resulted in the replacement of the main floor foyer and two offices with a modern classroom that can seat approximately 70 people. =History rooms= For the celebration of the 75th anniversary in 2015, part of the basement of the observatory was converted into one 1940 historical period room and one science demonstration room. Since that time a 1967 Elginfield Observatory room as well as a William Colgrove historic workshop have been added. These are all open to the public during public events. Research While the observatory's prime vision was as an educational and outreach facility, some very important research publications came out of work done with the telescopes and other equipment at the observatory. =Variable stars= The important research work of William H. Wehlau, staff, and students could not be summarized better than the obituary written by Bill's last graduating PhD student, Professor Jaymie Matthews, when he wrote, after Bill's sudden death in 1995, \\"Bill laid the foundation for many of the astronomical period-searching techniques we take for granted today. His 1964 paper with Kam-Ching Leung (ApJ 139, 843) on the multiple periods of Delta Delphini was the first published use of Fourier integral techniques to interpret stellar light curves. The quality and quantity of data (25 nights of three-colour photometry) and sophistication of the fit (a sum of 6 cosines) would not be out of place in the modern literature on asteroseismology of Delta Scuti variables (see his paper in these Proceedings). In the next decade, Bill again was a pioneer; this time in stellar surface imaging through inversion of spectral line-profile variations into abundance and temperature maps of Ap stars. Such techniques are now widely used to analyse high-degree NRP in rapid rotators. By the 1980s, Bill's diverse interests in pulsation and spectral peculiarity converged in the rapidly oscillating Ap stars. He played key roles in the first detection of velocity oscillations in an roAp (rotating Ap) star and in translating optical-IR photometry of roAp pulsations into the first empirical atmospheric temperature profile for a star other than the Sun.\\" =Iris Photometry= A locally modified Becker iris photometer was housed in the kitchenette in the basement of the observatory. In 1964 Amelia F. Wehlau discovered a 1938 nova while using this photometer to study photographic plates of Messier 14 that had been taken by Helen Sawyer Hogg. The plates were taken with the 74\\" telescope at the David Dunlap Observatory and 72\\" telescope at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory between the years 1932 and 1963. The nova was only found on the 1938 plates taken at the David Dunlap Observatory. =Photometry= A photometer was deployed on the 254 mm (10\\") refractor roughly between the years 1957 and 1960. The first research from this instrument was the study of the brightness of Comet Arend-Roland by William and Amelia Wehlau, using data from 1957 and 1958. This combination of instruments was also used in the published search for variability in the stars Gamma Equulei and HD 149728, using 1958 and 1959 data from the refracting telescope. In 1960 a 300 mm (12\\") Cassegrain reflector (purchased in 1958) came online with a locally built photometer, and this combination of equipment supplanted the photometer on the refractor. The first published use was in the successful search for light variablility in the star HD 173650, published in 1962 and using data from the summer of 1960. In later work using data from this instrument, William Wehlau pioneered Fourier techniques of detecting multiple periodicities in stars. The ground breaking work was the paper \\"The Multiple Periodicity of Delta Delphinii\\", Ap.J., Vol.139,April 1964, co- authored with graduate student Kam-Ching Leung. =Post 1969= With the opening of the Elginfield Observatory in 1969 the use of Cronyn Observatory for research observing diminished. The last photometric observations published using Cronyn Observatory data was in 1995 in a paper by J. Bax, W.H. Wehlau and S. Sharpe. However, very active machine and electronics shops based in Cronyn Observatory supported the research work of Elginfield Observatory until the 1.2m telescope at Elginfield was mothballed in 2010. Public Outreach The prime vision of this observatory was as an educational facility for the university and the local community. Since its inception, Cronyn Observatory has held \\"public nights\\" for the community members, normally running every Saturday evening throughout the summer and currently also running twice a month throughout winter.. Large groups can also book a day or evening visit through the \\"Exploring the Stars Program\\", and finally private events for small groups are also available References Kingston, H.R., \\"The Hume Cronyn Memorial Observatory\\", JRASC Vol. 34, p. 95, 1940 Kingston, H.R., \\"The Opening of the Hume Cronyn Memorial Observatory\\", JRASC Vol. 34, p. 393, 1940 Wehlau, W.H., \\"Notes from Observatories: Hume Cronyn Memorial Observatory\\", JRASC Vol. 53, p. 190, 1959 Wehlau, W.H., \\"Canadian Scientists Report- V.

It is located at a distance of circa 150 million light years from Earth, which, given its apparent dimensions, means that NGC 1241 is about 140,000 light years across. It was discovered by William Herschel on January 10, 1785. It is classified as a Seyfert galaxy. NGC 1241 interacts with its smaller companion NGC 1242, forming a pair collectively known in the Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies as Arp 304.  Characteristics  NGC 1241 is a barred spiral galaxy seen at an inclination. It has two well defined dusty spiral arms, and thus is characterised as a grand design spiral galaxy. The bulge is boxy, characteristic of a barred galaxy, with the arms emerging from each end of the bar, with the north one appearing more tightly wound than the southern. The main arms branch into smaller ones. A circumnuclear ring with active star formation has been detected in the central region of the galaxy. It appears clumpy and inclined and measures 5.6 √ó 3.4 arcseconds in diameter, lying just inside the inner Lindblad resonance. A faint spiral pattern with leading arms has been found to emanate from it in PaŒ± emission, while in Ks and J band, the pattern appears trailing. NGC 1241 is one of the few galaxies with known trailing features in the nuclear regions, with the other being NGC 6902. Inside the circumnuclear ring was detected a bar like feature 1.6 arseconds long that is almost perpendicular to the main bar of the galaxy. The nucleus of NGC 1241 has been found to be active and it has been categorised as a type II Seyfert galaxy. The most accepted theory for the energy source of active galactic nuclei is the presence of an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole. The mass of the black hole in the centre of NGC 1241 is estimated to be 107.46 (29 million) . The star formation rate of NGC 1241 is estimated to be 3.07 per year based on the H-alpha flux.  Nearby galaxies  NGC 1241 forms a pair with NGC 1242, which lies at an angular separation of 1.6 arcminutes. NGC 1243 lies 3.1 arcminutes away, but it has been identified as a double star in our galaxy. According to Garcia et al. the pair of galaxies is part of a galaxy group known as LGG 84, which also includes the galaxies NGC 1247, MCG -02-09-006, and Markarian 1071. A more recent study placed NGC 1241 in the same group as the galaxies NGC 1185, NGC 1204, NGC 1214, NGC 1215, NGC 1238, and NGC 1247.

Dean of the National Gallery of Art‚Äôs Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts (CASVA) since December 2000, she previously held positions as Professor of Art History at Johns Hopkins University and director of the university‚Äôs Charles S. Singleton Center for Italian Studies at Villa Spelman in Florence.  Early life  Born on 11 August 1944, Cropper was educated at Wakefield Girls' High School, winning a place at Newnham College, Cambridge. After studying History (Part I) and Architecture and Fine Arts (Part II) she graduated with a BA (Hons), subsequently converted to an MA. She was awarded an English Speaking Union and Fulbright Fellowship for graduate study at Bryn Mawr College, Pennsylvania, where, in 1972, she completed her Ph.D dissertation on the Italian printmaker and draftsman Pietro Testa.  Career  Following a Leverhulme Fellowship at Clare Hall, Cambridge, and a visiting lectureship at Franklin & Marshall College, Cropper joined the Department of Art History at Temple University, Tyler School of Art. During her tenure at Temple University from 1973 to 1985, Cropper was a fellow and visiting scholar at a number of research institutions, including Harvard‚Äôs Villa I Tatti (1978‚Äì79, 1981), Johns Hopkins‚Äô Villa Spelman (1981), and the National Gallery of Art's CASVA as the Samuel H. Kress Senior Fellow (1984‚Äì85). Her first monograph, The Ideal of Painting: Pietro Testa‚Äôs D√ºsseldorf Notebook, was published in 1984 by Princeton University Press. This continued her line of scholarship linking early modern texts to the production and reception of works of art that included an influential article in the Art Bulletin on the ideal of female beauty and the vernacular style in Renaissance Italy. Awarded the Arthur Kingsley Porter Prize for the best article by a younger scholar, this study was included in the Art Bulletin's 2011 Centennial Anthology of articles that ‚Äúmade a difference to us as art historians and as people.‚Äù After two years as a visiting associate (1983‚Äì85), Cropper joined the faculty of the Department of the History of Art at Johns Hopkins University as professor in 1985, where she would direct the university's Charles S. Singleton Center for Italian Studies from 1987‚Äì2000. While at Hopkins, Cropper held a number of visiting appointments at various international institutions, including directeur d‚Äôetudes associ√© at the √âcole des Hautes √âtudes en Sciences Sociales (1990‚Äì91, 1997), Slade Professor at Cambridge University (1992‚Äì93), and visiting professor at the Coll√®ge de France (1996); as well as a visiting membership at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton (1989). In 1994, she was named the inaugural Andrew W. Mellon Professor at the Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts, National Gallery of Art. This two-year appointment was established with the support of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation in commemoration of the Gallery's fiftieth anniversary ‚Äúto enable a distinguished art historian to pursue a project of scholarly research.‚Äù In December 2000, following Henry A. Millon's retirement from the National Gallery of Art, Cropper was appointed as dean of the Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts. Her focus at the helm, as stated in an April 2010 Washington Post feature on the Center, has been to encourage the intellectual expansion of CASVA into a place that endeavors to study ‚Äúall of art and visual culture, for all of time, for all the globe.‚Äù Following the example of dean Millon, Cropper contributes to CASVA's research by undertaking a long-term project with an international team of scholars intended to provide access to primary research materials for the field. Her chosen project will result in a multi-volume critical edition and annotated translation of Carlo Cesare Malvasia's Felsina pittrice (Bologna, 1678), ‚Äúa history of painting in Bologna that both emulates and challenges Giorgio Vasari‚Äôs Lives (1550/1568).‚Äù Volumes One and Thirteen, devoted to the art of late medieval Bologna and the lives of Domenichino and Francesco Gessi, respectively, were published in 2012 and 2013. Published in 2017, Volume Two, Part Two (in two volumes), features the life of Marcantonio Raimondi but also includes the most detailed catalogue of prints published in Europe before the eighteenth century. Most recently, the life of Guido Reni was published in 2019 as Volume Nine. While heading CASVA, Cropper has also held a number of leadership roles within the national and international scholarly community. This includes professional service as Chair of the Advisory Committee for two Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, the Biblioteca Hertziana, Rome and Kunsthistorisches Institut, Florence, (2001‚Äì11), President of the Renaissance Society of America (2010‚Äì12), and Vice President of the American Philosophical Society (2016‚Äì19). She has served on several fellowship committees outside CASVA, including those for The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation Distinguished Achievement Award and the Cullman Center at the New York Public Library.  Scholarly interests  Cropper is interested in the relationship of theory to practice in the early modern period, and has been committed to an understanding of the role of literacy among artists, taking seriously their reasoning about their production. Her training at Cambridge with Michael Jaff√© and Francis Haskell established a strong sense of the value of studying the historiography of art history: her essays on Mannerism, and on works by such artists as Bronzino and Pontormo follow a fundamental concern with the relationship between history and criticism. Essays on beauty, both male and female, have expanded interpretation of Renaissance portraiture and the depiction of the model in relation to the beholder. The relevance of biography to artistic production is a focus of Cropper's research, whether into the difficult and disorderly life of Artemisia Gentileschi or the stoic persistence of Nicolas Poussin. The Malvasia project reveals the extraordinary importance of the documentation of social life and artistic production in 17th century Italy. Questions of imitation and originality lie at the heart of The Domenichino Affair (2005: Menzione speciale, Premio Salimbeni per la storia e la critica d‚Äôarte, 2006), in which the paradigm of novelty is examined as a distinguishing feature of the modern artistic condition. Domenichino was the first artist to be accused successfully of plagiarism, a charge that in itself was a symptom of changed cultural expectation in relation to the poetics of imitation. As Cropper has asserted, painters in 17th century Italy ‚Äúfaced the very problem of their relationship to tradition and authority and were for the first time compelled to claim their individuality in a historical continuum.‚Äù  Personal life  Cropper is married to Charles Dempsey, former chair and professor emeritus in the Department of the History of Art at Johns Hopkins University, who also specializes in Italian Renaissance and Baroque art. Cropper and Dempsey co-authored Nicolas Poussin: Friendship and the Love of Painting, which won the 1997 Jan Mitchell Prize for the History of Art and the 1998 Charles Rufus Morey Book Award of the College Art Association.

The church building and its adjacent cemetery were listed together on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019. History Norwegian immigrants came to Allamakee County starting in the early 1850s. Their numbers increased after the American Civil War beginning in the late 1860s and continuing into the 1880s. They established the first Lutheran church in the area in 1850. It is still in existence and is now known as Old East Paint Creek Lutheran Church. A second congregation, known as the West Paint Creek Church, was organized in 1857 because parishioners found it difficult to navigate the poor roads in the area. In 1880 a controversy over predestination erupted among Norwegian Lutherans and affected the congregations in the Paint Creek area. A small group broke away from the original churches in 1887 and formed two congregations known as the East Paint Creek Synod and West Paint Creek Synod churches. The subject of this article is the West Paint Creek Synod Church. To distinguish between the two groups, the original churches were renamed Old East Paint Creek Church and Old West Paint Creek Church. The Old West Paint Creek Church is still in existence and located to the south of this church building on Maud Road. Peter and Sophia Paulson deeded a little more than of land to the West Paint Creek Synod congregation in 1890. They built this frame Carpenter Gothic church building, completed in 1892. It features three lancet windows on the side elevations, a gable-front roof, and a central bell tower capped with a spire. The building exhibits Norwegian immigrant carpentry skills found in the Dutch lap siding, frame construction, paneled doors, pews, and flooring. The interior includes a wood-carved altar, altar rail, and pulpit in the chancel. The pews of native pine have an ornate cross carved on each side. The altar's reredos features a painting by itinerant Norwegian immigrant artist Herbjorn Gausta called Resurrection. The cemetery is located on the west side of the church, and there is a shed on the property that was built in 1938. West Paint Creek Synod Evangelical Lutheran Church and Cemetery The church building was the site of the local community's religious and social life. Its significance is found in its association with Norwegian and Norwegian-American architecture and social history.

She was also the daughter of painter Jules Richomme, and the wife of French writer Andr√© Beaunier.  Early life  Jeanne Richomme was born in Paris, the daughter of painter Jules Richomme. Her grandfather was engraver Th√©odore Richomme.  Career  Raunay's opera debut came in 1888, at the Paris Opera, when she sang Uta in Reyer's Sigurd. She joined the Theatre de la Monnaie in Brussels from 1895 to 1897, and was the first to sing Guilhen in D'Indy's Fervaal (1897). She joined the Op√©ra-Comique in Paris in 1898, where she was the first to sing Jeannine in Bruneau's L'Ouragan (1901). Other appearances by Raunay included roles in Tannh√§user, Faust, Fidelio, Iphig√©nie en Tauride, H√©rodiade, and Lohengrin. She was considered a beauty of the opera stage. \\"Blonde, graceful, radiantly beautiful and supremely elegant, Jeanne Raunay counts among the rare singers of real worth whose reputation owes nothing to vulgar r√©clame or to petty intrigue,\\" noted an American magazine of Raunay, in 1905. Raunay retired from opera when she married, but she continued singing in concert. In 1910, she sang at the first concert of the Soci√©t√© musicale ind√©pendante, with her friend Gabriel Faur√© as her accompanist. In 1923 and 1924 she gave joint recitals with pianist Marguerite Long, performing music by contemporary French composers such as Ravel, Debussy, and Faur√©. She taught singing later in life; among her students was Jeanne Manceaux, the older sister of composer Francis Poulenc. Several composers dedicated works to Raunay. When Faur√©'s complete song cycle La chanson d'√àve was published in 1911, it was dedicated to Raunay, who had sung much of the work in its premiere performances. Ernest Chausson dedicated his \\"Chanson perp√©tuelle\\" to her. Charles Bordes also dedicated a composition to her, when the song was published in 1914.  Personal life  Jeanne Raunay married twice. In 1889, she married a doctor, Albert Filleau. He died in 1895. She married French writer Andr√© Beaunier in 1908. Beaunier died in 1925. She died in 1942, aged 73 years.

It was located on University Avenue, just north of Osgoode Hall. It was the largest armoury in the country and trained over 250,000 soldiers to serve Canada in various wars. It was sold in 1961 to the Metropolitan Toronto government for a new courthouse building and demolished in 1963. History In the 1890s, the Government of Canada decided to consolidate all of the facilities in Toronto that were used to train and maintain local volunteers and professional militia regiments. =Construction= The new armoury building was designed by architect Thomas Fuller, then the Minister of Public Works. It was to be the largest armoury in Canada. The foundation was made of Kingston limestone and the walls were -thick. It was designed in the Romanesque Revival style with towers and castellations. Inside, there was a drill hall measuring , with a -high ceiling. The contract for the project was awarded in October 1891 to Major Saba Stewart of Ottawa for . Construction began soon after. The stones were cut in Belleville, causing the local Stonecutter's Association to complain about the work not being done in Toronto. The final cost of construction of the building was . An additional was spent on the building in 1894‚Äì95. =Grand opening= The Queen's Own Rifles marched to the new armoury in April 1894 to take possession, followed by the Governor-General's Body Guards. That month, the grand opening was announced. It was to be a three-day-military festival of competitions and displays. The tournament was open to all officers, non-commissioned officers and men of all militias in Canada. Competitions were held in \\"head and post\\", tent-pegging, sword versus sword, horse riding and jumping, wrestling on horseback, bayonet versus bayonet, cavalry melee and others. Displays included march pasts and musical rides were to all be part of the festival, for which a 3,000-seat set of bleachers would be constructed in the drill hall. The railways offered discount travel of return tickets for the price of one-way tickets. Admission prices ranged from 25 cents to $1 for seats and loges for $6. The patrons were the Governor-General of Canada Earl of Aberdeen and Lady Aberdeen; and George Kirkpatrick, the Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario; James Patterson, Minister of Militia and Defence; Major-General Ivor Herbert, commander of the militia; Sir Casimir Gzowski; and Warring Kennedy, the Mayor of Toronto and their wives. The official opening took place on May 17, 18 and 19, 1894. The first exhibition at the hall took place in June 1894, held by the Queen's Own Rifles. A nearly full-scale reproduction of the Midway Plaisance section of the Chicago World's Fair of 1893 was constructed, including the \\"Streets of Cairo\\", \\"The Moorish Palace\\", \\"Old Vienna\\", \\"Irish Village\\", \\"Turkish Theatre\\", \\"The Dahomeyan Village\\", \\"The Indian Village\\" and \\"Chinese Theatre\\". The scenery was painted by the scenic artists Sosman and Landis of Chicago at a cost of . The exhibition also included the \\"Congress of Beauties\\", a fashion show of international women's fashion as well as evening musical performances. The admittance fee was 25 cents, and an extra 5 cents for the villages displays. =Operation= North and west facades Henry Pellatt funeral at the Toronto Armories. The Armories was the site for the training of over 250,000 reservists. The soldiers served in the Boer War, World War I, World War II and the Korean War. In March 1919, approximately 18,000 people gathered at the Armories to welcome back the 58th Battalion, CEF, and the 2nd CMR battalion, composed of over 1,000 reservists from Toronto after World War I. The veterans had marched from North Toronto Station down Yonge Street then west to the Armories. They were greeted by John Hendrie, the Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario and Thomas Church, the Mayor of Toronto. The six regiments at the time of decommissioning: * 48th Highlanders of Canada * No. 5 Column, Royal Canadian Army Service Corps (RCASC) * The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada * 29th Field Artillery * 42nd Medium Artillery * The Governor General's Horse Guards The Armories was also used for civilian events, such as car shows and horse shows in the large drill hall. =Demolition= University Avenue and Armoury Street The Metro Toronto government, inaugurated in 1954, made plans for a new Metro Toronto Courthouse (now Toronto Courthouse) in the downtown, to complement the new civic square and City Hall complex that the City of Toronto government was planning. According to Metro Chairman Fred Gardiner, a search of the downtown found that the most suitable location was the Armories building. Metro began negotiations to purchase the property for million in 1960 to demolish the Armories and erect a million courthouse building. The purchase was delayed for a year after it was found that the City of Toronto had first right to purchase the facility after the Government of Canada had deemed it surplus. Opposition sprang up to preserve the Armories, similar to the opposition to the demolition of New Fort York. The \\"Preserve The University Avenue Armories Association\\" was formed to fight City Hall. It was composed of various Historical Societies. Public opinion was split on the merits of the building. Architects were in favour of keeping it on heritage merit. Architect Charles Dolphin called it a \\"great sturdy, colourful structure which you can learn to love and appreciate for what it is when you look at all those boxes we are putting up today under the guise of modernism.\\" Toronto Alderman Horace Brown called it an \\"ugly duckling\\" and \\"architectural monstrosity.\\" The six regiments housed in the armoury also opposed the decommissioning. The Association also had the support of the Royal Canadian Legion, Canadian Corps Association, Imperial Order of the Daughters of the Empire, Silver Cross Mothers, the Associated Historical Societies Committee, and many ex-serviceman's associations. Toronto City Council voted to waive its right on June 19, 1961, at the urging of Gardiner who warned that they \\"could make a mess of the square if they block the sale.\\" The Association planned to fight the demolition in the courts. In March 1962, The 48th Highlanders, Queen's Own Rifles and the artillery regiments agreed to the Toronto Board of Control proposal to build a new armoury at Queen Street East and Jarvis Street for a new Moss Park Armoury. The fight was lost and the building was demolished in 1963. Outside the new courthouse, a large plaque marks the spot of the armories building. A stone from the building was used as the cornerstone for the Moss Park Armoury and some stone was used at the Guild Inn. The various militia and regiments dispersed to various locations - the new Moss Park Armoury, the Falaise Barracks, the Richmond St Armoury, the Armoury building at Old Fort York and the new Forces Base at Downsview. The 48th Highlanders moved to temporary quarters at Fort York Armoury and are now at Moss Park Armoury. The Queen's Own Rifles, Canada's oldest regiment, took its stone fireplace and moved to the Richmond Street Armoury (87 Richmond St. East), along with the 29th Field Artillery. They eventually moved to Moss Park Armoury. The Governor General's Horse Guards and the 5th Column RCASC moved to Denison Armoury at Downsview. The 42nd Medium Artillery regiment moved to the Falaise Barracks on Lake Shore Boulevard at Spadina. The Moss Park Armoury opened in 1965. The new Toronto Courthouse opened in 1967.

On 17 May 2013, the Supreme Court of Cassation harshly criticized the Calderoli law, highlighting important questions of constitutional legitimacy and entrusting the Constitutional Court with a possible judgment of unconstitutionality.Porcellum, Cassazione invia atti a Consulta: \\"Premio maggioranza altera equilibri\\" On 4 December 2013 the law was declared unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court in reference to the majority prize awarded to the most voted coalition, without a minimum threshold to be reached in order for the prize to be taken, and the impossibility for the voter to provide a preference.La Consulta: il Porcellum √® incostituzionale  Main characteristics  = Proportional system and blocked lists = The law introduced a system based on the proportional electoral formula of the \\"whole quotient and the highest remnants\\" (Hare method), but with a substantially majority spirit due to the thresholds and the strong majority premium. It provided for a system of blocked lists, in which the voter could not express any preference vote. = Majority prize = It also provided for a majority prize, to be awarded nationally (excluding Aosta Valley) for the Chamber of Deputies, and in each region for the Senate of the Republic (excluding Aosta Valley, Trentino-Alto Adige and Molise). For the Chamber, it was established that to the list or coalition that obtained the majority of the votes but did not obtain the 340 seats, was assigned a further quota of seats beyond those already obtained, in order to reach this number. The 12 seats assigned to the Italians abroad constituency and the seat assigned to the Aosta Valley were assigned according to different rules: the relative votes were not calculated for the determination of the list or coalition of lists of relative majority and therefore did not contribute to triggering the majority premium. For the Senate, it was established that the list or coalition that obtained the majority of votes in the Region but did not receive 55% of the seats assigned to it, were assigned a further quota of seats, in order to reach that number. = Explicit programs and alliances = The law provided for the obligation, together with the presentation of electoral symbols, for each political force to deposit its program and to indicate its head. It also envisaged the possibility of mutual recognition between multiple lists, grouped together in coalitions. = Thresholds = To get seats in the Chamber, each party or list had to get at least 4% of the national votes while the coalitions had to get at least 10%. The lists linked to a coalition that exceeded the prescribed threshold participated in the allocation of seats if they exceeded 2% of the votes; the first party below this threshold within the same coalition also participated in the allocation of the seats. To obtain seats in the Senate, each party or list had to get at least 8% of the votes while the coalitions had to get at least 20%. The lists linked to a coalition that had exceeded the prescribed threshold, participated in the allocation of seats if they exceeded 3% of the votes. To protect the recognized linguistic minorities it was envisaged that the lists representing them, whether coalitioned or not, could still have access to the allocation of seats for the Chamber of Deputies obtaining at least 20% of the votes in the constituency in which they compete. For the Senate of the Republic, it was envisaged that 6 of the 7 seats due to Trentino-Alto Adige be assigned through uninominal colleges, maintaining in this single Region the mechanism envisaged by the previous election law.

She left school aged 15 and went to work as an assistant in a jewellery shop, later moving to Garrard & Co, jewellers, which had its own operatic group. In her spare time she took singing lessons with Topliss Green and Rodolpha Lhombino.

Her appearances with other companies included Scottish Opera, where she sung Fricka in Wagner's Die Walk√ºre, a role she reprised in Reginald Goodall's 1973 Ring Cycle.

In October 610, Heraclius the Younger reached Constantinople, executed Phocas, and was proclaimed as emperor, establishing the Heraclian dynasty of the Byzantine Empire. Background Various reasons may have contributed to the beginning of this rebellion, such as the atmosphere of terror and fear of purges in Phocas' military regime, avenging the death of Emperor Maurice in 602, personal ambitions of the Heraclii, the damaged reputation of Phocas. These were coupled with calculations in favor of the revolt, such as the distance of the Exarchate of Africa from Phocas in Constantinople, and the fact that Constantinople was relying on the grain and revenues from the Exarchate. The news of the Sasanian ruler Khosrow II's large-scale mobilization of forces to invade the eastern Byzantine territories, also ostensibly to overthrow Phocas and avenge Maurice's death, made the situation more favorable for this revolt in the west. The rebellion Heraclius the Elder first made himself and his son consuls, thus laying claim on the supreme power. The rebels attacked Egypt and Cyrenaica via land, while a naval assault was launched from North Africa against Constantinople, possibly via Sicily and Italy. The rebellion received support in most of Egypt and the central Mediterranean. Aftermath A revolt against the Heraclius' rule by Comentiolus, the brother of Phocas, was defeated after the assassination of the latter by patricius Justin in late 610 or 611. Heraclius the Elder died shortly after the success of the revolt.

V. Pandian and produced by T. Siva for Amma Creations. The film stars Rajkiran and Vanitha Vijayakumar in the lead roles, while Vinu Chakravarthy and Ganthimathi play supporting roles. The film had musical score by Karthik Raja.  Plot  The story of ‚ÄúManikkam‚Äù is based on the Tamil superstitious belief of yesteryear heroes, brave-hearts, warriors (‚Äúveerargal‚Äù) eventually becoming worshipped as sub-deities and believed to become ‚Äúprotectors‚Äù of villages. These are locally known as ‚Äúkaval deivangal‚Äù, or ‚Äúguardian gods‚Äù. Manikkam (Rajkiran) is a protector (kaaval) of many local villages, but he resides at a village in Vadipatti. Manikkam is believed to get the ‚Äúarul vakku‚Äù from the local Neethi Amman kovil and operates accordingly. Meanwhile, local villagers are terrorized by Karuvayan (Mansoor Ali Khan) and the gang from a local town called Vakkanoor. Karuvayan is a ruthless bandit that thrives on the livelihood of stealing from others and selling arrack. The heroine Savithri (Vanitha Vijayakumar) comes back home from London and resides with her grandmother (Jayanthi); Savithri‚Äôs ‚Äúthai maaman‚Äù Anandaraj is a local goon who also makes money illicitly and utilizes Karuvayan and the Vakkanoor gang to handle business. Manikkam has many brothers and sisters and while he is the ‚Äúkaaval‚Äù for many villages, he eventually becomes a ‚Äúkaaval‚Äù for Savithri‚Äôs village. Despite guarding villages, Manikkam has a responsibility of getting his 8 sisters married. On a stroll through the village with her grandmother, Savithri encounters the Karuppasamy kovil and asks why it is locked up; Savithri‚Äôs grandmother explains that 5 years ago during a festival, Anandaraj was angry that he did not get the ‚Äúparivattam‚Äù (a form of honor), so he ordered Karuvayan and Vakkanoor gang to kill the attendants and to lock the temple and ever since, nobody was able to attend the temple. Manikkam‚Äôs father Virumandi (Vinu Chakravarthy) resides in Usilampatti and ends up marrying a 16-year-old girl, disgracing the family once more (he is married to many wives) and ruining a proposal for one of his daughters. Disgusted, Manikkam confronts his father about the marriage and a war of words leads to Manikkam getting kicked out his house with his siblings and grandmother Gandhimathi joining him. Meanwhile, after Savithri meets Manikkam, her grandmother Jayanthi sends her to stay with Manikkam and his siblings, for her grandmother fears that she is not safe with Anandaraj around; when Anandaraj leaves town, she is hidden there. After learning more about Manikkam's soft nature, she eventually falls in love with him, desiring to marry him. One day Manikkam has an encounter with Karuvayan stealing from market merchants, and orders Karuvayan to give back the money he stole; this leads to a fight in which Karuvayan is beaten up by Manikkam. Savithri eventually expresses her love and desire to Manikkam, but Manikkam refuses as his obligations to getting his sisters married and village affairs are more important. Eventually Anandaraj finds out of Savithri‚Äôs love for Manikkam and threatens for her to marry him instead. When Savithri is again hidden with Manikkam's family, Anandaraj comes to find out, brings her back and locks her in a room. Savithri‚Äôs grandmother goes to the Neethi Amman kovil to tie a knot (wishful request) and Manikkam gets the word to free Savithri; Anandaraj confronts him with his goons and Manikkam defeats all of them. Eventually, Manivannan makes his way into the film as a criminal that was just released from the Palayamkottai jail; he eventually meets Karuvayan and they become friends. Karuvayan introduces Manivannan to Anandraj and they devise a plan to defeat Manikkam; Manivannan already had an aim to go after Manikkam‚Äôs father for marrying his 16 year old sister, so there was a mutual hatred toward Manikkam. Manikkam eventually marries off one of his sisters. The rest of his 7 sisters eventually get groom proposals, prompting a plan for a single marriage ceremony for all 7 girls. Meanwhile, Savithri‚Äôs village elders get the ‚Äúarul vaakku‚Äù to open the Karuppasamy temple and conduct the temple festival, with Manikkam supposedly being the one to lead the charge in that effort. This causes worry by his grandmother and siblings, knowing what happened when Anandaraj and the Vakkanoor gang killing anyone that tried to open up the temple, but Manikkam remained calm and moved forward since he received the arul vaakku. The night his sisters were getting married, Manivannan tricked Virumandi into stopping the wedding, but the grooms did not acknowledge his word and made it clear that they are marrying Manikkam‚Äôs sisters. After a big argument at the wedding, Savithri eventually talks sense into the wedding parties, which angers Manivannan and ends up stabbing her. Instead of going to the hospital, Savithri desires to see Manikkam as the temple festival is happening at the same night of the wedding. During the thiruvizha (festival), Manikkam gets into a trance and leads the way to open the temple. Anandraj, Karuvayan and Vakkanoor gang make their way into the crowd to stop Manikkam, but they were all beaten and killed, including Karuvayan and Anandraj. Manikkam successfully opens the Karuppasamy temple after 5 years and enters with other devotees, but the rest of the devotees outside were ambushed and slaughtered by more of the Vakkanoor gang that arrived onsite. Manikkam (still in the trance) gets word from a crying village elder about what Vakkanoor people did and then grabs the aruvaal (machete) and takes charge towards Vakkanoor. Meanwhile, the wives of the Vakkanoor bandits approach Manikkam‚Äôs mother (Srividya) and beg her to stop her son from slaughtering their husbands. Srividya eventually finds her son in a full trance, heading to Vakkanoor to go after the bandits; knowing that she cannot stop him, she talks as if she was the goddess and tells him to stop, which prompts Manikkam to completely stop, while he stands in full fury and anger; Pazhanichamy (local villager) informs Manikkam's mother of what Vakkanoor did and how Manikkam was going to serve justice; his mother realizes her fault and then runs back to her son, but not knowing where her path was, she falls into a well. Eventually his father Virumandi realizes his mistakes and falls at Manikkam's feet begging for forgiveness and eventually Savithri comes to him and dies at his feet. The movie ends with a large black statue of Manikkam in that same pose with the aruvaal and velkambu, as this is believed to be many years later and he is now adopted as a kaaval deivam like Karuppasamy, as this Tamil superstitious tradition passes on.
