Audeca or Andeca () was the last Suevic King of Galicia from 584 until his deposition in 585. He deposed Eboric and usurped the throne by marrying the young king's mother, Siseguntia (or Sisegutia), the widow of Eboric's father and predecessor, Miro. He consigned Eboric to a monastery. This action gave the Visigothic king Leovigild an excuse to invade the Suevic kingdom, which he did in 585. According to John of Biclar, \\"Leovigild devastated Galicia, deprived the captured King Audeca of his rule, and brought the people, treasure, and territory of the Suevi under his own power. He made Galicia a province of the Goths.\\"John of Biclar, Chronicon, 73, in Arias, p. 32.

To Isidore of Seville, his deposition meant the end of the Suevic kingdom, which had lasted 177 years from Isidore's starting point of 408: \\"the kingdom which they [the Sueves] held in idle lethargy, they have now lost at an even more shameful cost, although it may seem quite amazing that they had managed to retain up to the present day that which they have now given up without any show of resistance.\\"Isidore, Historia Suevorum, 68, in Arias, pp. 32-33.

He has been a contributor to genome database projects and the 2003 winner of the Benjamin Franklin Award.  Early life  Kent was born in Hawaii and grew up in San Francisco, California, United States.  Computer Animation  Kent began his programming career in 1983 with Island Graphics Inc. where he wrote the Aegis Animator program for the Amiga home computer. This program combined polygon tweening in 3D with simple 2D cel- based animation. In 1985 he founded and ran a software company, Dancing Flame, which adapted the Aegis Animator to the Atari ST, and created Cyber Paint for that machine. Cyber Paint was a 2D animation program that brought together a wide variety of animation and paint functionality and the delta-compressed animation format developed for CAD-3D. The user could move freely between animation frames and paint arbitrarily, or utilize various animation tools for automatic tweening movement across frames. Cyber Paint was one of the first, if not the first, consumer program that enabled the user to paint across time in a compressed digital video format. Later he developed a similar program, the Autodesk Animator for PC compatibles, where the image compression improved to the point it could play off of hard disk, and one could paint using \\"inks\\" that performed algorithmic transformations such as smoothing, transparency, and tiled patterns. The Autodesk Animator was used to create artwork for a wide variety of video games.  Involvement with the Human Genome Project  In 2000, he wrote a program, GigAssembler, that allowed the publicly funded Human Genome Project to assemble and publish the first human genome sequence. His efforts were motivated by the research needs of himself and his colleagues, but also out of concern that the data might be made proprietary via patents by Celera Genomics. In their close race with Celera, Kent and the UCSC Professor David Haussler quickly built a modest cluster of 50 commodity personal computers running the Linux operating system to run the software. In contrast, Celera was using what was thought then to be one of the most powerful civilian supercomputers in the world. Kent's first assembly on the human genome was released on June 22. Celera finished its assembly three days later on June 25, and the dual results were announced at the White House on June 26. On July 7, 2000, the Santa Cruz data was made publicly available on the World Wide Web while the research paper describing this publicly funded genome was published in February 2001 special issue of Nature, in parallel with Celera's results in the journal Science. In 2002 Tim O'Reilly described Kent's work as \\"the most significant work of open source development in the past year\\". While all of Kent's genomics software is open source in the sense that the source code can be downloaded and read for free, and all of the software can be freely used for academic, nonprofit, and personal use, some of it requires a license, either from UCSC or from Kent Informatics Inc., for commercial use. After GigAssembler, Kent went on to write BLAT (BLAST-like alignment tool) and the UCSC Genome Browser to help analyze important genome data. Kent continues to work at UCSC primarily on web tools to help understand the human genome. He helps maintain and upgrade the browser, and has worked on comparative genomics, Parasol, a job control management software for the UCSC kilocluster, and the ENCODE Project.

When Mott first arrived he was being chased by Zenelle, a female alien from a species infamous throughout the galaxy for devouring their mates after the wedding night. Zenelle left behind a trail of spores as she tracked Mott through the city, exposure to which caused the beatniks to mutate into disgusting, warty versions of themselves. Zenelle fell in love with one of these mutants and carried him away, much to the relief of Mott. Blaming Madman for their deformity, the Mutant Street Beatniks remained bitter enemies until several of them discovered that their deformation was simply the first stage of their mutation, which gave them super powers such as elasticity. Discovering these powers cleared up their skin condition, so they no longer hate Madman and have formed a super-hero team calling themselves The Atomics. Around this time, their missing comrade returned from space, revealing that Zenelle had actually fallen in love with him to the degree she went against her culture and refused to eat him. Because of the different time-flow between Snap City and Zenelle's planet, when their comrade returned he brought with him his teenage son, the product of his union with Zenelle.

The painters of vedute are referred to as vedutisti. Origins This genre of landscape originated in Flanders, where artists such as Paul Bril painted vedute as early as the 16th century. In the 17th century, Dutch painters made a specialty of detailed and accurate recognizable city and landscapes that appealed to the sense of local pride of the wealthy Dutch middle class. An archetypal example is Johannes Vermeer's View of Delft. The Ghent architect, draughtsman and engraver Lieven Cruyl (1640‚Äì1720) contributed to the development of the vedute during his residence in Rome in the late 17th century. Cruyl‚Äôs drawings reproduce the topographical aspects of the urban landscape.Lieven Cruyl‚Äôs veduti (or city views) 18th century The River Thames from Richmond House: a classic veduta by Canaletto, 1747 As the itinerary of the Grand Tour became somewhat standardized, vedute of familiar scenes like the Roman Forum or the Grand Canal recalled early ventures to the Continent for aristocratic Englishmen. By the mid-18th century, Venice became renowned as the centre of the vedutisti. The genre's greatest practitioners belonged to the Canal and Guardi families of Venice. Some of them went to work as painters in major capitals of Europe, e.g., Canaletto in London and his nephew Bernardo Bellotto in Dresden and Warsaw. In other parts of 18th-century Italy, idiosyncratic varieties of the genre evolved. Giovanni Paolo Pannini was the first veduta artist to concentrate on painting ruins. The Dutch painter Gaspar van Wittel (who worked in Rome, where he was known as Vanvitelli) and others painted veduta esatta, i.e. exact vedute, which was a topographically accurate depiction of a cityscape or monument and in which the human and animal figures played a secondary role. His collaborators included Hendrik Frans van Lint, who would become one of the leading vedute painters in the first half of the 18th century.Edgar Peters Bowron, Joseph J. Rishel, Art in Rome in the Eighteenth Century, Philadelphia Museum of Art; Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, 2000, p. 236-237 Through his more realistic representation in the vedute he executed at the end of the 17th century and beginning of the 18th century, the Flemish painter Jan Frans van Bloemen anticipated developments during the 18th century, when there was a shift away from the classically oriented Roman landscapes of French vedute painters in Rome such as Gaspard Dughet.Christine van Mulders and Alain Jacobs. \\"Bloemen, van.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 5 Dec. 2014 The Quattro Fontane Looking Toward Santa Maria Maggiore by Lieven Cruyl In later developments of the vedute, Pannini's veduta morphed into the scenes partly or completely imaginary elements, known as capricci and vedute ideate or veduta di fantasia.Rudolf Wittkower, Art and architecture in Italy: 1600-1750, Penguin Books, 1980, p. 501 Giambattista Piranesi was the foremost master of vedute ideate etchings. His topographical series, Vedute di Roma, went through many printings. 19th century Antonio Reyna Manescaualt=330x330px In the later 19th century, more personal \\"impressions\\" of cityscapes replaced the desire for topographical accuracy, which was satisfied instead by painted, and later photographed, panoramas. There was a sizeable community of √©migr√© artists active in Venice, such as Antonietta Brandeis, the Spanish painters Mart√≠n Rico y Ortega, Mariano Fortuny, Antonio Reyna Manescau and Rafael Senet and the Peruvian painter Federico del Campo. These artists responded to the large international market for their city views of Venice, and they made such big names for themselves through this genre that they painted nothing but Italian views. Demand for Federico del Campo's views, particularly from English tourists, was so strong that he painted several views multiple times,Federico del Campo, Peruvian, Gondolas by the Doge's Palace, Venice at Sotheby's and the same can be said of Reyna Manescau, that repeated the same urban landscapes in many occasions with minimal variations.

Plot summary  The cosmic hero Quasar receives a distress call from a colony of the alien Rigellians in deep space. The character arrives to find the colony destroyed and a single survivor, the superhero Jack of Hearts, who is in a coma. Quasar summons all nearby members of the superhero team the Avengers, and the Thunder God Thor, the Titanian Eternal Starfox, heroines Tigra and Photon, and outsider Moondragon respond. When the heroes arrive on the planet, Moondragon scans Jack's mind and detects a single word: Infinites. The heroes are then attacked by thousands of robots, and eventually retreat via ship into space as the artificial life forms seem to be forming from the planet itself. Moondragon continues to scan Jack's mind and learns the robots' purpose is to break down the entire planet into a molten mass. The planet's crust is breached by the robots and as it becomes molten ore, Jack of Hearts wakes and states that the master of the robot hordes has arrived. A spatial rift opens, and a being the size of a planet emerges. The Avengers‚Äîat microscopic size compared to the entity‚Äìbreach its head and attempt to reach the brain to learn more and possibly neutralize it. As the Avengers battle more of the same robots within the entity, Tigra watches as it shapes the molten ore into a cylinder. Several more beings of the same size and scope arrive, bearing similar cylinders, which Tigra assumes are former planets. The group fuses with the cylinders to form a huge circular ring that clamps the star close to the original planet the Avengers visited. Another spatial rift opens and an even larger hand appears and begins to drag away the entire galaxy. The characters retreat from the entity, now part of the colossal ring. Moondragon determines the entire construct is called a Walker, and being dragging away the galaxy an Infinite. She suggests summoning the cosmic entity Eternity to stop the act. Quasar is able to call Eternity, and the entity wrestles with the hand before travelling with the Avengers to the Dimension of Manifestations, where cosmic entities converse. The Infinites claim they are rearranging galaxies to improve the flow of energy, and Eternity advises them that this would be fatal to all affected life forms. The Avengers each make a case for the sanctity of life. The Infinites explain that they were ignorant of the fact that life could exist on planets. They abandon their plan, and one of them sacrifices itself to restore all destroyed planets. The Avengers are transported back to the now recreated Rigellian colony, which is a paradise as animal life has yet to appear.Avengers Infinity #1 - 4 (Sep. - Dec. 2000) References External links  Avengers Infinity at the Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators * Avengers Infinity at the Marvel Database Project * Avengers Infinity #1 Review, Comics Bulletin ","title":"Avengers Infinity"},{"id":"3511039","text":"The Piute Range is located in the Mojave Desert, primarily in northeast San Bernardino County, California, United States, with a north portion in Nevada.

Biography In 1989, Wise earned a Ph.D. in paleontology from Harvard University. In addition, he has an M.A. in geology from Harvard University and a B.A. in geology from the University of Chicago. In 1998, Robert Schadewald described Wise as influential on \\"modern creationism as it is practiced at its higher levels.\\" Starting in fall 2009 he has been the director of Truett McConnell University's newly created Creation Research Center in Cleveland, Georgia. Between August 2006 and May 2009 he taught at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary as director of the school's Center for Theology and Science, a job in which he was preceded by intelligent design advocate William Dembski.

Despite believing that science supports his position, Wise has written that: As a young child interested in science, Wise tentatively adopted an old Earth creationist point of view after doing a science fair project on the geologic column, but was not completely satisfied with that decision: Later, as a sophomore in high school, he took a newly purchased Bible and a pair of scissors and cut out every verse which could not be interpreted literally if scientific determinations on the age of the earth and evolution were true. He pursued this task with a flashlight under the covers of his bed for several months; at the end, he had removed so much material that \\"with the cover of the Bible taken off, I attempted to physically lift the Bible from the bed between two fingers. Yet, try as I might, and even with the benefit of intact margins throughout the pages of Scripture, I found it impossible to pick up the Bible without it being rent in two.\\" Wise decided to reject evolution instead of Biblical literalism, deciding: Biologist and popular atheist author Richard Dawkins called Wise a truly honest creationist because he is willing to accept creationism even if he admitted \\"all the evidence in the universe\\" was against it. Dawkins, referring to Wise's testimony, criticized what he perceived as intellectual dishonesty: Books * Kurt Wise, Faith, Form, and Time: What the Bible Teaches and Science Confirms About Creation and the Age of the Universe.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Los Angeles Angels and San Diego Padres. Weaver was drafted in the first round (12th overall) in the 2004 Major League Baseball draft by the Angels out of Long Beach State. He was a three-time All Star, and twice led the American League in wins. He is the younger brother of former pitcher Jeff Weaver. Early years Weaver grew up in Simi Valley, California, and attended Simi Valley High School. College career Weaver attended college at California State University, Long Beach. Weaver went 37‚Äì9 during his baseball career at Long Beach State. In his final season of 2004, he became the top pro pitching prospect in the country, going 15‚Äì1, with a 1.62 earned run average (ERA), 213 strikeouts and just 21 walks in 144 innings. After the 2004 season, he won the Golden Spikes Award as the top amateur baseball player in America, the Dick Howser Trophy as the national collegiate baseball player of the year, the Roger Clemens Award as college baseball's top pitcher, and was named starting pitcher on the All-American first team by Baseball America. A 2004 Los Angeles Times called him dominating, describing his pitching as overwhelming \\"batters with a fastball between 89 and 94 mph, a sharp slider and an improving curveball all thrown with the same three-quarter arm delivery. He also has a fiery streak that is revealed with a fist pump or yell after a strikeout that ends an inning or a long at-bat.\\" The article compared him to 2001 college pitching sensation Mark Prior. Professional career =2004 draft and minor leagues= Weaver was originally speculated to be one of the top three overall draft picks in 2004; however, the bonus demands of his agent, Scott Boras, turned off several teams. On draft day, Baseball America asked \\"Where In The World Is Jered Weaver Going? That is the $10.5 million question. No team is claiming him as a possible first-round pick, and there's no sense that a club is lying in the weeds on him. He and adviser Scott Boras don't seem to be backing down from a reported desire for Mark Prior money, and he could slide through the entire first round altogether.\\" Weaver was drafted in the 1st round (12th pick overall) by the Angels in the 2004 Major League Baseball Draft. The Angels scouting director Eddie Bane said he did not know until two minutes before the draft that he'd definitely get the opportunity to choose Weaver. Bane told Baseball America about their scouting, \\"We did our homework. We started when Jered first got to Long Beach. I watched him in intrasquad games back in January. All our guys had seen him. We didn't back off because of reports in the paper. We do our stuff privately. We were prepared if he was there at 12 to take him.\\" However, negotiations did not proceed smoothly. Talks broke down multiple times. Boras and client Weaver held out until the last minutes before the May 2005 deadline, becoming the longest holdout in draft history. Weaver received a $4 million signing bonus, less than the $10.5 million originally sought and also less than a $7‚Äì8 million range mentioned in the media just months before signing. Weaver's ascent to the major leagues was quick. He made his MLB debut on May 27, 2006, a total of just 361 days after signing with the club. He spent just over one month in Single-A before being promoted to Double-A where he would finish 2005 3‚Äì3 with a 3.98 ERA. In 2006, Weaver moved up to Triple-A Salt Lake where he dominated hitters. MiLB wrote of Weaver's success, \\"It's fairly common for prospects to struggle in their first exposure to Triple-A ball, but the 23-year-old Weaver dominated the Pacific Coast League almost immediately, posting a 6‚Äì1 record with a 2.10 ERA in 12 games for the Bees.\\" Angels management were impressed enough to call Weaver up when ace Bartolo Col√≥n was on the disabled list. =Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim= 2006‚Äì2007 He made his MLB debut on May 27, 2006, starting against the Baltimore Orioles. He pitched seven shutout innings, striking out five, and earned the victory. This was followed with three more consecutive victories. Despite his success, when Bartolo Col√≥n returned from the disabled list, Weaver was bumped out of the rotation and sent back down to the minors. He was recalled to the majors on June 30, 2006, when the Angels designated Weaver's brother Jeff for assignment. Weaver continued his impressive performance, at one point lowering his ERA to 1.12 after six starts. He won his first nine decisions at the start of his major league career, tying the American League record set by Whitey Ford in 1950. Weaver recorded his first loss on August 24, 2006, when he lost to the Boston Red Sox, despite allowing only one earned run in seven innings pitched, a home run to David Ortiz. He finished the season with an 11‚Äì2 record and a 2.56 ERA and placed fifth in the American League Rookie of the Year Award voting.\\"Baseball Awards Voting for 2006\\". Baseball-Reference.com. Weaver warming up in the bullpen in 2008. 2008 On June 28, 2008, he and Jos√© Arredondo combined to no-hit the Los Angeles Dodgers over eight innings, but still lost the game 1‚Äì0. This was only the fourth time in major league history that a no-hit bid was unable to go nine innings because of the home team winning the game, and the first as a combined effort. Because they did not pitch nine innings, it is not officially considered a no-hitter.Peters, Ken. June 28, 2008. \\"Dodgers Beat Angels Without a Hit\\". Yahoo! Sports. Weaver made his first career relief appearance against the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park in Game 3 of the 2008 ALDS. He recorded the win in the bottom of the 12th inning in order to keep the Angels, who previously were down 2‚Äì0 in the series, hopes of winning the series alive. 2009 On June 14, 2009, Weaver had his first complete game shutout against the San Diego Padres. On June 20, 2009, Weaver started for the Angels against the Los Angeles Dodgers. The opposing starter was his older brother Jeff Weaver. This was the first pitching matchup between brothers since 2002 when Andy and Alan Benes matched up and only the 15th such game since 1967.Brotherly love: Weavers set to match up The Dodgers won 6‚Äì4, with Jeff getting the win and Jered taking the loss.Dodgers' Weaver wins battle of brothers Weaver was awarded the inaugural Nick Adenhart Pitcher of the Year award, named after Jered's teammate, for best pitcher on the Angels roster. 2010 Weaver reached a deal with Angels management for a $4.265 million salary for the 2010 season to avoid going into arbitration. During Spring Training, he added a two-seam fastball to his repertoire after instruction from teammates Scot Shields and Joel Pi√±eiro. After the departure of John Lackey to the Boston Red Sox through free agency, there was some uncertainty over who would assume the role of the club's ace. Many expected that position to be filled by Weaver, who said, \\"Sure, I'd love to have that role. But I really don't like to think about it. I just try to improve every year, and this year is no exception.\\" Weaver was the Angels' Opening Day starter, beating the Minnesota Twins at Angel Stadium on an ESPN national broadcast. On July 6, despite not having been initially selected, Weaver was chosen to replace CC Sabathia on the American League roster for the 2010 All- Star Game due to the latter's ineligibility to pitch. He joined Torii Hunter as the only Halos representing the host club for Angel Stadium's third Mid- Summer Classic, though he did not pitch in the game. The All-Star selection was well-deserved, as Weaver posted the best season of his short big league tenure thus far. Weaver was the major league strikeout champion with 233, besting Mariners ace F√©lix Hern√°ndez by a single strikeout. He also posted career-bests in innings pitched (with 224.1), ERA (3.01), and WHIP (1.07). Weaver's success was not reflected in his win-loss record, however, as he went 13‚Äì12 due in part to poor run support. Despite the uncertainty over the role earlier in the season, Weaver embraced and ably fulfilled his new responsibility as the team's ace in 2010. He finished 5th in AL Cy Young award voting. 2011 Weaver picked up right where he left off the 2010 season, serving as the Angels' ace along with co-ace Dan Haren. Weaver posted a 6-0 record and a 0.99 ERA in his first six starts, setting a major league record for first pitcher to reach 6 wins by April 25. Weaver struck out a career-high 15 batters on April 10, 2011, in a game against the Toronto Blue Jays. Weaver became the second pitcher in major league history to win his sixth game in just his team's twenty-third game, which tied him with Randy Johnson in 2002.Weaver 4-hits A's in Angels' 5-0 win ‚Äì MLB ‚Äì Yahoo!

In July, Weaver's fellow players elected him to his second All-Star Game. On July 11, manager Ron Washington announced that Weaver would start the 2011 All-Star Game for the American League.2011 All-Star Game: Roy Halladay will counter Jered Weaver as starter ‚Äì ESPN In his one scoreless inning of work at the All- Star Game, Weaver had one strikeout (Carlos Beltr√°n), one walk (Matt Kemp) and no hits. On July 31, in a game against the Detroit Tigers, Weaver gave up a solo home-run to Carlos Guill√©n who watched the home-run and then stared at Weaver as he flipped his bat, upsetting Weaver. Weaver exchanged words with Guillen as he made his trot around the bags, and the home plate umpire issued warnings to both dugouts. The first pitch to the next batter, Alex Avila, was thrown just over Avila's head. Avila ducked, and Weaver was immediately ejected from the game by home-plate umpire Hunter Wendelstedt, along with Angels Manager Mike Scioscia. Weaver was suspended for six games because of the incident. In August 2011, Jered Weaver signed an $85 million contract with the Angels for 5 years. Weaver finished the 2011 season with an 18‚Äì8 record and a 2.41 earned run average, which was edged out by Justin Verlander's 2.40 for the American League lead and was the lowest ERA by an Angel since Chuck Finley's 2.40 in 1990. He finished 2nd in the AL Cy Young Voting. 2012 Starting off the 2012 season, Weaver pitched a four-hit shutout against Kansas City Royals on April 6. Shortly thereafter, he recorded his first official career no-hitter on May 2 against the Minnesota Twins. Weaver allowed only two baserunners ‚Äì Chris Parmelee reached on a passed ball after a strikeout in the second inning, and Josh Willingham walked in the seventh, he struck out nine and walked only the one batter. On May 28, Weaver sustained a lower back injury after following through on a pitch and was subsequently placed on the 15-day disabled list. Nearing the end of the season and with the Angels still in contention for a postseason spot, Weaver for the first time in his career won his twentieth game, on September 28 against the Texas Rangers. 2013 Weaver during a game on the road in 2012 On April 7, 2013, Weaver suffered a fractured left elbow following a base hit by Mitch Moreland of the Texas Rangers. Weaver dodged the line drive by Moreland and ended up injuring the elbow as he rolled on the mound. He was placed on the 15-day disabled list the next day after he left the game. He returned on May 29, 2013 against the Los Angeles Dodgers pitching 6 innings with 7 strikeouts. 2014 Weaver finished the 2014 season with a record of 18-9 while having a 3.59 ERA in 213.1 innings pitched. 2015 The 2015 season was a tough one for Weaver as he suffered his first losing season in his career (7-12 in 26 starts) while also registering a then career-high ERA (4.64). Throughout the season, Weaver suffered continued decrease in velocity, clocking in under 86 mph. He led the major leagues in bunt hits allowed, with seven.2015 Major League Baseball Baserunning/Situ  Baseball-Reference.com =Los Angeles Angels= 2016 In his final season before free agency, Weaver continued to struggle with velocity and command, ending with the highest ERA of his career (5.06). He narrowly avoided another losing season, however, going 12-12. He had the lowest ground ball percentage among major league pitchers (28.8%).Major League Leaderboards ¬ª 2016 ¬ª Pitchers ¬ª Dashboard  FanGraphs Baseball =San Diego Padres= On February 19, 2017, Weaver signed a one- year, $3 million contract with the San Diego Padres. 2017 Weaver made his debut with the Padres on April 6, giving up four runs in five innings and taking a loss against the Los Angeles Dodgers.Padres vs. Dodgers - Box Score - April 6, 2017 - ESPN He later went on the disabled list with a hip injury. On August 16, Weaver announced his retirement. Weaver made nine starts in his final season, and went 0‚Äì5 with a 7.44 ERA and 23 strikeouts in 42 innings. Pitching style Weaver began his windup standing on the extreme third base side of the pitcher's plate, and strode slightly toward the third base side. This, combined with his 6'7\\" height and long arms, created a pitch traveling at a sharp angle to home plate, making pitch detection more difficult, especially for right-handed batters. Weaver's arsenal consisted of six pitches: * Four-seam fastball (Gyroball) (84-88 mph) * Two-seam fastball (83-87 mph) * Slider (78-81 mph) * Curveball (67-72 mph) * Changeup (75-80 mph) * Cutter (83-87 mph) His two-seamer was his most-commonly thrown pitch, especially to left-handed hitters. He used the two-seamer, his curveball, and his changeup to get ahead against left-handers. Weaver typically only threw his slider and four-seamer to lefties when there was a 2-strike count. He also used the changeup with two strikes, but not the curveball. Against right- handers, Weaver used the four-seamer and slider most of the time, and rarely used his curveball. His slider was effective in two-strike counts because of its high tendency to get swings and misses (42% of swings through the first two months of the 2012 season). Personal life On February 9, 2007, Weaver and his brother had their jerseys retired by Simi Valley High School in a basketball game between Royal High School and Simi Valley. Weaver was the cover athlete of MVP 07: NCAA Baseball, in his college uniform. Weaver and his girlfriend of nine years, Kristin Travis, got married in November 2011. Both are active supporters of Special Olympics Southern California and Weaver serves as a Sports Ambassador for the organization. On July 5, 2013, Kristin Weaver gave birth to their first child, a son named Aden David Weaver in honor of Jered's late friend and teammate Nick Adenhart. Weaver's wife also gave birth to a daughter in 2014. While playing for the Angels, Weaver would write the letters \\"NA\\" on the back of the pitcher's mound in memoriam of Adenhart after his death in 2009.

She felt in love with the Spanish doctor while discussing the war that the US was launching against Spain to conquer Cuba (1889).

History The shopping centre was built in the early 1970s in an area that was historically boggy ground, on the outskirts of the medieval town (hence the name). It was once occupied by the Franciscan Friary known as Greyfriars, Nottingham, which was dissolved in 1539.

The centre underwent a major cosmetic refurbishment in 1988. Redevelopment Nottingham City Council, owners of the leasehold on the centre, had as of 2013 been attempting to encourage development at Broadmarsh for \\"almost two decades\\". Their 2002 development brief called for a development that \\"respects the urban grain of the City Centre, with clear streets and urban blocks of buildings to provide for legibility, separate identity and future flexibility\\" with a clear north‚Äìsouth route linking Nottingham's Old Market Square and railway station, stating, \\"This route must take the form of a pedestrianised public street.\\" In November 2002, plans to demolish the existing shopping centre, car park, and adjoining Broadmarsh bus station were approved. In April 2007, a plan nearly identical to that proposed in 2002 was approved. The three-year redevelopment plan would have involved the demolition of much of the centre, the car park, and the adjoining bus station. In November 2011, it was announced that Capital Shopping Centres (CSC), owners of the Victoria Shopping Centre, just north of the city centre, had bought Westfield's stake in Broadmarsh. The purchase prompted an investigation by the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission, which was concerned the company's monopoly over the city's shopping centres could negatively impact competition. In February 2013, CSC changed its name to Intu Properties plc. The new owners wished to start an already planned development of the Victoria Centre, but Nottingham City Council insisted that Broadmarsh must be their \\"priority\\" and offered ¬£50 million towards its redevelopment. The deputy leader of Nottingham City Council said the council would withhold planning permission for the development of the Victoria Centre until they \\"see bulldozers going into the Broadmarsh Centre\\". A new plan for a limited redevelopment of some of the centre received planning approval in June 2015. The plans included the retention of most of the fabric of the 1970s' mall and existing tenants, including Boots, Wilko and BrightHouse, with some cosmetic updating. A nine- screen cinema was to be constructed at a remodelled south-eastern corner, along with new leisure and restaurant spaces. Drury Walk was planned as \\"Bridlesmith Square\\", providing a new area outside intu Broadmarsh, targeted at upmarket brands. Counter to the 2002 Development Brief, the new walkway between the city centre and station was planned to be within the existing enclosed shopping mall, under a new glass roof. Construction company Sir Robert McAlpine were given the contract to start work on the long-awaited redevelopment of the centre with phased demolition of the Broadmarsh centre starting in October 2019 Due to the COVID-19_pandemic, redevelopment work was halted in March 2020. Despite a relaxation of rules allowing construction projects to continue, contractors failed to return to the site in May 2020. with equipment and scaffolding being removed in June 2020, and the centre being closed by Intu citing safety concerns. Work was halted in June 2020, owing to the owners Intu Properties going into administration. By early July 2020 the part-demolished shopping centre had closed and the site was handed back to the freeholder, Nottingham City Council. On 6 August 2020, it was announced that the centre would be completely demolished at a cost of ¬£8 million.

No, I don't wanna see that,\\" with the sound of a Zenith Space Command mechanical ultrasonic TV remote accompanying the channel suddenly switching to show a US Senate hearing conducted by (fictional) Senator Hummel, portrayed by Peter Lawford, who asks a series of organized crime figures various questions to which they invariably reply: \\"I refuse to answer on the grounds it may tend to incriminate me.\\" Every few seconds, the screen showing the hearing switches through non-broadcasting channels to another broadcast channel which is screening Preminger's black- and-white 1965 feature, In Harm's Way, and through more non-broadcasting channels to other channels which have one spurious commercial after another. The initial ad depicts an attractive blonde declaring, \\"now you too can be beautiful and sexually desirable like me instead of being that fat, disgusting, foul-breathed, slimy, wallowing sow that you are\\", the second has another intensely smiling blonde stating that \\"maybe we blondes do have more fun\\" and the third ad depicts a drunken slob swilling beer and belching, interspersed with an image of a pig with beer foam around its snout, while an unseen announcer exclaims: \\"feel big, drink pig!\\" After another switch to In Harm's Way, Channing's voice is again heard, complaining, \\"no, Harry, I don't like films on TV. They always cut them to pieces.\\" Additional channel changes produce more images of the beer pig, then another scene from In Harm's Way, followed by an ad for \\"Fat Cola\\", with three generously proportioned middle- aged women, wearing bathing suits, beach hats and carrying little parasols, gyrating to the jingle, \\"You'll never lose your man if you drink fat cola, you'll never have to worry about losing him\\", then an ad showing a boy and a girl, both about six years old, dressed like adults at a picnic setting, next to a dog resembling Our Gang's Pete the Pup (Pete's trademark circular ring around the eye is here drawn at a sharply oblique angle), with all three vigorously emitting smoke from long cigarettes held in their mouths, while happy young voices sing the jingle: \\"Puff, puff, puff, puff, puff, if you want to have a girly, you must puff, puff, puff.\\" The following ad shows a family, including small children, standing in front of their house, all holding guns, with the father declaring, \\"...get a gun for everyone in your family ‚Äî remember, for family fun, get your gun\\", while the next ad, for \\"New Daisy Chain Deodorant,\\" has a male voice followed a female voice singing ever more insistently, \\"I want my deodorant, I want my deodorant...\\" Next, a balding, mustachioed pitchman presents a fast-talking spiel that if you're bothered by \\"dandruff, athlete's foot and the common cold, cancer, birth defects, mental illness, ringworm, poison ivy, tooth decay, acne, measles, brain tumor, smallpox, syphilis, plague, influenza, hepatitis and St. Vitus Dance, well, you're in luck, friend. Pick a pack of Peter's perfidious pink pacifying placebo pills...\\" At that point Jackie Gleason, Carol Channing and Arnold Stang are shown sitting in front of the TV, with Gleason and Channing at war, each with a Zenith Space Command mechanical ultrasonic remote control, switching the channel to and away from the Senate hearing. Gleason and Stang subsequently go to the kitchen and, as they come out, the TV screen shows combative 1960s TV personality Joe Pyne commenting on the hearings: \\"...and, as one witness follows another, Senator Hummel is getting the same answer Senator Kefauver got in 1950 and 1951...\\" =Storyline= Tony Banks (Jackie Gleason), a retired mob \\"torpedo\\" (hitman), now settled with wife Flo (Carol Channing) and daughter Darlene (Alexandra Hay), worries about his daughter's new hippie boyfriend Stash (John Phillip Law), and his own paternity of Darlene. A father-and-son pair of mob bosses, Hechy (Cesar Romero) and Angie (Frankie Avalon), bring Tony the news that top mobster \\"God\\" (Groucho Marx) wants him to carry out one last job ‚Äì liquidating his old pal, \\"Blue Chips\\" Packard (Mickey Rooney), before Packard can testify before the US Senate's Crime Commission. Tony refuses, but upon discovering another old friend, Harry (Arnold Stang), shot through the head, goes along with God's wishes and, now wearing a convict's striped outfit, finds himself in the island prison of Alcatraz, a futuristic, high-tech institution where Packard is held under top- level protection. In Tony's absence, Stash and his friends, who have been charged with vagrancy, are invited by Flo to stay at their house. She visits Angie (as does Darlene, also seeking to find out what happened to her father) to persuade him to either cancel the job, or take her to God (who's living without a country, on a yacht in international waters) so she can ask personally. Angie won't take Flo, but he will take Darlene, who nonetheless insists on bringing Stash along. God takes a liking to Darlene, as does God's tall, supermodel-like black mistress (Luna) to Stash, but both are frustrated in their pursuit. One of Tony's cellmates turns out to be a draft dodger called Fred the Professor (Austin Pendleton), an electronics wizard who has renounced technology, but makes an exception in rigging a television set to allow Banks the opportunity of cell-to-cell communication with Packard. Banks realizes he can't kill his old friend, and, as a result, will probably never leave the prison. He writes his wife with the news, on stationery borrowed from Fred, while ignoring Fred's admonition not to lick the envelope and discovering the hard way that all the stationery is soaked with LSD... enough to send the whole prison on a bad trip. One of the inmates, Leech (Michael Constantine) says, \\"Hey, maybe if I take some of that stuff, I wouldn't have to rape anybody anymore.\\" Fred guides Tony through the resulting acid experience, helping him come to terms with his worries about Darlene and his past while plotting their escape. Darlene and Stash spend the night aboard God's yacht, with Stash getting word back to Flo and his friends about their location, and a coded plea for help. As the hippies mount a rescue, Tony and Fred build a makeshift balloon from discarded freezer bags and garbage cans, dump the whole supply of stationery into the prison's lunch, and fly out of the prison as everyone below begins to freak out. As it happens, both the hippies (led by Flo, who sings \\"Skidoo\\" as they storm the yacht) and the balloon arrive on God's hideaway at the same time. Feeling trapped, God adopts a stooped \\"Groucho posture\\", skulks into a closet in his cabin and closes the door. Flo and Tony are last seen as Flo pulls Tony toward a bed in one of the yacht's empty side cabins, while in the main cabin, God's Skipper (George Raft), holding open a copy of Gabriel Vahanian's 1961 book (widely read during counterculture era), The Death of God, performs a marriage ceremony between Angie and God's Mistress, who then proceeds to become overly affectionate with surprised best-man/father-figure Hechy, as the dismayed Angie tries to separate them. Behind them, another ceremony, performed by a hippie \\"minister\\" named Geronimo (Tom Law, the brother of John Phillip Law), using the Skipper's Death of God book, joins \\"this brother and this sister\\" (Stash and Darlene) \\"in holy union.\\" Next, in calm waters, a small sailboat, with sails decorated in large psychedelic designs of the words \\"LOVE\\" and \\"PEACE\\", holds two occupants ‚Äì Fred the Professor and God, both dressed in Hare Krishna / transcendental meditation garb. Nilsson's voice is heard singing \\"I Will Take You There\\" as they smile beatifically while sharing a lit joint and, after taking a puff, God murmurs, \\"...mmm, pumpkin.\\" =Epilogue= As the final scene becomes a freeze-frame shot, Otto Preminger's familiar accented voice is heard intoning, \\"Stop!, we are not through yet, and before you skidoo, we'd like to introduce our cast and crew...\\" The entire credit sequence (all cast, crew, and copyright information) is then sung by Nilsson, with various asides (\\"and Luna as God's Mistress, well you know-oh what I mean\\"... \\"arranged and conducted by George Tipton, a very good friend\\"... \\"Visual consultant and titles by Sandy Dvore and, what's more, they were executed by Pacific... ahem, how's your popcorn?, copyright em, see, em, el, ex, vee, eye, eye, eye [MCMLXVIII] by Sigma Productions Incorporated, your seat's on fire\\").

What's The Point? The Legendary 1971 Animated Feature on DVD in Bright Lights Film Journal, Issue 44, May 2004 Pop culture buffs have noted that three cast members, Frank Gorshin (The Riddler), Burgess Meredith (The Penguin) and Cesar Romero (The Joker), played recurring villains in the 1966‚Äì68 Batman television series, which broadcast its final episode in March, nine months before Skidoo's release. The film's then- futuristic costume designer, Rudi Gernreich, also made an acting appearance on Batman and, in one 1966 two-part episode, Otto Preminger, himself, portrayed another of the show's recurring villains, Mr. Freeze (in the character's first appearance on the show, he was played by George Sanders and, when seen for the third time, by Eli Wallach). After Preminger saw him perform with The Committee, an uncredited Rob Reiner was brought in to \\"write scenes for hippies\\".Rabin, Nathan. \\"Random Notes ROB REINER\\" (A.V. Club, April 13, 2011) The scenes on God's yacht were shot on John Wayne's yacht, Wild Goose, the former US Navy minesweeper USS YMS-328. Wild Goose was used extensively with scenes shot from the exterior and in the wheel house, cabins, engine room, upper and lower decks. Part of the movie was filmed at the South San Francisco City Hall.https://www.tiki-toki.com/timeline/entry/871439/South-San-Francisco- History/https://newspaperarchive.com/oakland-tribune-sep-14-1968-p-5/  Release and reception = Critical reception = Skidoo was a notorious bomb, failing both with critics and at the box office, but in the years since its release it has seen a rise in appreciation by film critics. In 1973 Jonathan Rosenbaum said he valued the film as an \\"endlessly fascinating aberration... [it] enlists a legion of Fifties TV corpses into an amalgamation of every conceivable Hollywood genre.\\" In his 2011 review of the DVD in his New York Times column, Dave Kehr framed the film as the product of Preminger being \\"politically aligned with the kids... but culturally bound to the grownups\\", which \\"allows his ambivalence to fester into an across-the-board caricature... The result is a finely controlled mess, one of the most uncomfortably evocative films of its time.\\" = Later releases = Less than two months after Skidoo's December 19, 1968 release, the February 15, 1969 episode of Hugh Hefner's syndicated talk-variety series, Playboy After Dark, featured, among other guests in a group setting, Otto Preminger (wearing a Nehru jacket), Nilsson (performing music and songs from Skidoo) and Carol Channing. Clips from the episode were included in the 2006 documentary, Who Is Harry Nilsson (And Why Is Everybody Talkin' About Him)? The movie received some belated attention in the late 1970s when it was screened at San Francisco's Roxie Cinema and in the 1980s when seen on cable TV. New York City's Museum of Modern Art periodically exhibits a 35mm print, and it also screened at the USA Film Festival in Dallas in 1997 and had a Los Angeles showing in 2007 at the American Cinematheque. On January 4‚Äì5 and July 11‚Äì12, 2008, paired with another counterculture-themed feature, 1967's The Love-Ins, Skidoo was seen as an installment of Turner Classic Movies' Friday night‚ÄìSaturday morning TCM Underground series. Each film features a brief appearance by then-famous/notorious chain-smoking, \\"tough-guy\\" syndicated TV talk show host Joe Pyne, who died of lung cancer in March 1970 at age 45. Olive Films released the film on DVD in its original aspect ratio on July 19, 2011.

Forced out of New York City following her parents‚Äô divorce, Amelia takes setbacks in stride‚Äîfor the most part. Reggie Grabinsky Leader and founder of G.A.S.P. (Gathering of Awesome Super Pals), Reggie Grabinsky is a fun-loving, silly guy with a loose grasp on reality. However he can be something that might be considered mature when he needs to. Rhonda Bleenie Rhonda Bleenie is a smart, stubborn, and loud girl. She is friends with Amelia because of geography and nothing else. She was well known for her hairstyle until she adapted a more down-to-earth look, as well as her unabashed love for Reggie. Pajamaman Being the most popular kid in class, being dirt poor, never speaking, and never changing out of his ‚Äúfootie‚Äù pajamas requires the magic of this man...Pajamaman. How does he do it? Pajamaman is a loyal friend, a great listener, and cute as a button. Though 'PM' is the shy, silent type, one can always know what he's thinking by checking out the symbol on his jammies. Tanner Clark Amelia‚Äôs Aunt Tanner is a friend, a confidant, and a mentor. She‚Äôs Amelia‚Äôs Jiminy Cricket. That is, if Jiminy was a Rock ‚ÄòN Roll hipster hottie, instead of, y‚Äôknow, a bug.

But there is always the chance of a big-time comeback tour. Amelia‚Äôs mom and dad Typical average parents who are going through a divorce. Amelia‚Äôs mom is a bit too overwhelmed to completely connect with her daughter at times but her love for Amelia is evident. She uses care and caution when approaching potentially unsettling moments, like telling Amelia that they are moving (again) and breaking the news that she is going out on a date. Amelia‚Äôs dad also loves his daughter unconditionally, but struggles to be an active part of her life, given his infrequent visits and the miles that separate them. A bit depressed from the collapse of his marriage and the dwindling popularity of the company he promotes (he‚Äôs marketing director for Softee Chicken, a once- popular kids‚Äô franchise), he still maintains a semi-cordial relationship with his ex (that is when he doesn't think Amelia is around). Ninja Kyle Leader of G.A.S.P.‚Äôs arch-rivals, the Park View Terrace Ninjas, Kyle comes off as an arrogant jerk, taking great delight in embarrassing (even humiliating) other kids. But Kyle‚Äôs jerk-like tendencies may be rooted in something deeper - a genuine affection for Amelia, who reluctantly gets past Kyle‚Äôs tough exterior, and even agrees to be his ‚Äúdate‚Äù to their first school dance. It is difficult to understand how Amelia could ignore Kyle's awful behavior, and it can only be guessed that Kyle's occasional moments of humanity make it difficult for her to remember the worse things he's done. He was injured in a fall at the climax of \\"True Things\\" and reappears in \\"Her Permanent Record\\" in which he has not completely recovered from his injuries after he broke his leg. He also started to reconnect with Amelia and become friends again after the accident.

The campus is set on of wooded land. The roughly 4000 undergraduate students (full-time and part-time students combined) are taught by a full-time staff of over 150 professors and teaching assistants. Several degree options are available at Penn State Abington. Students may start any of 160 Penn State baccalaureate programs at the Abington campus and complete them at another Penn State campus, including the main University Park campus. Two associate degree programs, 19 baccalaureate degree programs, and several continuing education programs designed for adult students are also available.http://abington.psu.edu/about-penn-state-abington Degree programs at Abington The athletics program has been granted full NCAA Division III status. History The Penn State Abington campus was originally developed in the early twentieth century as a private girls' school. It had been founded in 1850, as the education of girls began to receive attention and new institutions were established. It was located at two previous sites before this campus was developed. The school was founded by teachers Mary Bonney and Harriette A. Dillaye as The Chestnut Street Female Seminary in Philadelphia, serving girls from the ages of 12 through 18. It had a classical curriculum comparable to that of male seminaries of the time. With increasing enrollment and expansion to lower grades, by 1883 The Chestnut Street Female Seminary needed to find a campus that could accommodate the larger student body of nearly 100 students annually. In 1883, banker Jay Cooke suffered financial hardship and needed a way to pay off his debts. He learned that Bonney and Dillaye were seeking expansion space for their school, which continued to attract new students. He recruited them to lease his mansion in Cheltenham Township, Pennsylvania, outside Philadelphia, for an annual rental of $15,000. Cooke had his mansion built in 1863. A successful banker, he had helped finance Union operations during the American Civil War. He named his estate Ogontz, in honor of a Native American chief from the Sandusky, Ohio area. During his childhood, Cooke had spent much time with Chief Ogontz and greatly admired the man. The seminary was renamed as The Ogontz School for Girls after its move that year to Cooke's mansion and estate. Bonney and Dillaye appointed two associate principals, Frances Bennett and Sylvia Eastman, to take on some of the responsibility for operations. The school had about 100 pupils annually.\\"The Ogontz School for Girls, 1850-1950\\", Abington College Library, Penn State Abington, collections Students at the Lares Building at Penn State Abington, during Common Break on April 22, 2003. By 1900 Bennett had retired, and Sylvia Eastman became the sole principal. She encouraged Abby A. Sutherland, the headmistress, to develop her management skills. Later Eastman arranged to sell the school to her for four equal payments. In 1916, Sutherland completed her purchase of The Ogontz School under this agreement. She had worked at the school since 1902, when she was hired as an English teacher. She had already taught for eight years, three of them after graduating from Radcliffe College at Harvard University. The school continued to attract more students and, in 1916, Sutherland began looking for a larger site. She planned to add lower-school classes for younger girls. She sold the school's property in Cheltenham Township, and bought of land in what Sutherland called the \\"beautiful park section in the hills of Rydal.\\" When the school operations were moved to Abington Township, only the main building, known today as the Sutherland Building in her honor, had been completed. Soon after the move, the Rydal School, was constructed on the grounds in order to accommodate additional elementary grades. This structure is known today as the Rydal Building. In this early twentieth-century period, Amelia Earhart, was studying as an upper school student, preparing to attend Bryn Mawr. She was the only alumna in the early years to become internationally known for her own achievements. She established her renown as a solo airplane pilot in the early aviation days. She was lost in 1937 on an around-the-world flight. Earhart did not graduate from the Ogontz School, leaving months before the ceremony in order to enlist as a nurse's aide at Spadina Military Hospital in Toronto, Canada. Penn State Abington's campus is largely wooded, as shown in this picture of students relaxing during \\"Spring Fling,\\" an annual campus-sponsored event. . =Penn State Abington= Changing mores reduced demand for this all- girls private school. In 1950 Sutherland donated the property and all facilities in Abington to Pennsylvania State University. Furnishings included a painting by Thomas Moran, an American artist to whom Jay Cooke had advanced money in 1873. The arrangement The campus became a site for some classes of Penn State and was known as Penn State Ogontz, after the private school's best-known name. In 1995, this facility was renamed as Penn State Abington- Ogontz, to emphasize its relationship with the surrounding community. On July 1, 1997, the Penn State Ogontz campus was designated as a Penn State college and was renamed Penn State Abington. Athletics Penn State Abington, known athletically as the Nittany Lions, is a full member of the NCAA Division III and participates in the North Eastern Athletic Conference (NEAC) and the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC). Penn State Abington sponsors 13 intercollegiate sports. Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, soccer and tennis; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, tennis and volleyball. Facilities During Penn State Abington's orientation program, incoming students participate in skit \\"Freshmen Feud.\\" Penn State Abington features a large library, modern laboratories, and computer facilities. Recreational areas include tennis courts, basketball courts, and baseball and soccer fields. The major buildings on campus include the Sutherland, Lares, and Woodland buildings. (Only the first two predate the acquisition by Penn State.) Rydal is another of the original Ogontz buildings. Later buildings constructed by Penn State are Springhouse, Cloverly, and Hillcrest. There are also a Conference Center and an Athletics Building. The Sutherland Building was built in 1915, and served as the original main building for The Ogontz School for Girls. Today it is a classroom building, and features a lecture hall, academic and student offices, academic advising spaces, a post office (cash only), and a tutoring facility. It had an indoor swimming pool but it did not meet current standards and the space was converted for use as a lecture hall. It also had a solarium, an addition adopted from Jay Cooke's mansion Ogontz. Rydal houses multiple classrooms and the campus security offices. As part of the Ogontz School, it was used for lower-school classes. The Lares building, renovated in 2002, has served as host for entertainers such as Stevie Starr. The Lares Union Building was built in 1923 as the personal residence of Abby A. Sutherland, president of the Ogontz School. It has been adapted by Penn State Abington to serve as the student union building; its facilities include a cafeteria (managed by Culinart), bookstore (Barnes & Noble college), and a banquet room and multi-purpose room (\\"Lubert Commons\\"). It is used for student programs, student organization and government offices, the Office of Student Engagement & Leadership, the Career Development Center, and the Intersection. The Woodland Building was constructed after the campus became part of Pennsylvania State University. This building features classrooms and a lecture hall, laboratories, a computer lab, and academic offices. It also features Penn State Abington's library, with a collection of nearly 60,000 volumes. The library is available for use by students, faculty, staff, alumni, and residents of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Springhouse houses a single classroom and storage. The Conference Center has classrooms. Cloverly houses offices and the counseling unit. Hillcrest is used only for storage. Athletics houses the athletic department and a gym. Also available are a multi-use field and tennis court (along with nearby facilities - Huntingdon Field) used by the athletic teams. In 2017, Penn State Abington opened its first on-campus housing nearby, known as Lion's Gate, planned to house roughly 400 freshman. This establishes the campus as residential and not only for commuters. This college is also planning to construct a new student union and a new academic building within the next decade. An outdated campus building will be demolished to make way for a new building. References *Map of Penn State Abington campus.

It was originally published between 1981 and 1984 in Marvel Superheroes, #377‚Äì388, The Daredevils, #1‚Äì11 and The Mighty World of Marvel, volume 2, #7‚Äì13. The story features Alan Davis's first work with the Captain Britain character. It also features the only mainstream Marvel Universe work by Alan Moore, who took over writing of the storyline one-third of the way through the saga (Marvel Super-Heroes #387) when David Thorpe (who began the storyline) abruptly left the series. It officially designated the mainstream Marvel Universe with the label 616 and introduced many concepts regarding the Marvel Multiverse, such as the Captain Britain Corps and Saturnyne. Plot =Earth-238= The Crooked World Storyline spun directly out of the events of the Black Knight strip in Hulk Weekly. After that story (called The Otherworld Saga) Captain Britain and his companion, the elf called Jackdaw, are dispatched by Merlyn back home to Captain Britain's Earth from the Otherworld, which is in another dimension. During this journey through dimensions, Captain Britain's costume changes and Jackdaw gains a superhero costume, and he and Jackdaw find themselves on Earth. However, the pair found that this Earth is not quite as Captain Britain knew it. They have various weird encounters, including fighting a monster made out of junk and a group of insane Alice in Wonderland-themed villains called The Crazy Gang and the mysterious Saturnyne and her henchmen, the Avant Guard. During the course of his adventures he discovers he is on an alternate Earth called Earth-238 which is under the control of Sir Jim Jaspers, the leader of The Crazy Gang and a powerful mutant with the ability to warp and change reality. Captain Britain discovers that Jaspers was a British MP who had been in charge of regulating and eventually eliminating the superheroes of Earth-238. To carry out this massacre of this world's superheroes, Jaspers had created The Fury (whose name is another reference to Alice in Wonderland), an incredibly powerful creature able to destroy any super powered person with the exception of Jaspers himself. Jaspers had become insane, a side-effect of his reality warping powers, and altered this Earth to fit his own insane ideas, hence why Captain Britain had not recognised this world. After seeing The Fury kill Jackdaw and Saturnyne flee this Earth, Captain Britain is confronted by Jaspers and is killed by The Fury. Captain Britain however, is reconstructed in an improved form from virtually nothing by Merlyn and returned to his Earth, which is called Earth-616.This story is the first where the \\"mainstream\\" Marvel continuity is described as happening on Earth 616 After moving back into Braddock mansion and meeting his old enemy, Slaymaster, in a battle in the streets of London he discovers that Saturnyne has been placed on trial for her part in the Earth 238 disaster after a battle with The Special Executive. Returning with The Special Executive to act as a witness for Saturnyne, the Captain encounters various alternate versions of himself (later to be called the Captain Britain Corps) and sees the destruction of Earth 238 to stop the Jaspers Warp spreading from that reality. =Earth-616= Eventually returning home with The Special Executive and Saturnyne (who has been exiled) in tow, Captain Britain is confronted by Captain UK in Braddock Manor. Captain UK is his analogue from Earth 238 who was sent to Earth 616 during The Fury's massacre of her Earth's superheroes. Captain UK warns him that his world's Jim Jaspers plans to regulate his planet's heroes as his Earth 238 counterpart had. As they discuss this they are attacked by The Fury, who has managed to escape the destruction of its reality and has come to Earth-616 to complete its mission to kill every superhero. Captain Britain and The Special Executive (Captain UK is unable to fight as she is still scared after seeing The Fury kill her husband on Earth-238) battle The Fury and several of The Special Executive are killed but they manage to defeat The Fury for the time being. The Special Executive leave Earth to return to their own world, this leaves Captain Britain, Captain UK, Saturnyne, Betsy Braddock, her lover Tom Lennox and Alison Double (these last three are all powerful telepaths) to confront the threat of Jaspers on their own. Jaspers is elected British Prime Minister and his promises to outlaw super humans is carried out by S.T.R.I.K.E. Concentration camps are built to imprison and execute super humans but Captain Britain and his companions remain free but in hiding. Jaspers has also shown signs of the same powers his Earth-238 version showed and this world begins to slowly alter, warping reality darkly. Shortly after Jaspers election, the Vixen, one of his former allies, enters his office with two henchmen in an attempt to stop Jaspers by assassinating him. However, he quickly disposes of the two henchmen by warping their bodies horribly and then uses his reality warping ability to transform the Vixen into a real vixen, a female red fox. Immediately after this, Captain Britain decides to confront Jaspers (it is revealed that Merlyn had tested him on Earth-238 against a lesser version of Jaspers to prepare him for this greater menace) but he leaves his companions who are later discovered by Jaspers henchmen. Tom Lennox is killed; Betsy Braddock and Alison Double are captured, leaving Captain UK and Saturnyne to flee. Captain Britain battles Mad Jim Jaspers in 10 Downing Street but Jaspers proves too powerful for him. However The Fury enters the battle, beating Captain Britain before tackling Jaspers himself in a battle which distorts reality itself. During Captain Britain and the Fury's battle, Jaspers takes his time to create an Earth-616 version of the Crazy Gang out of the Earth's soil. Captain Britain would later run into the Crazy Gang on a few occasions in later comics. While it was the Earth-238 Jaspers who constructed the Fury and had programmed it so it couldn't kill him, the Fury recognised that the Jaspers it was now facing was not its creator but an alternate reality counterpart. Thus its rules did not apply to the Earth-616 Jaspers and the Fury attacked him by incinerating him, something that Jaspers was able to undo with his powers. Also observing this battle were Saturnyne and Captain UK, who had now been convinced to wear her costume by Saturnyne. The Fury eventually beats Jaspers by transporting him into an interuniversal void (where he couldn't use his reality warping powers since there was no reality to warp) and used Jaspers moment of surprise to fry his brain with a powerful electric shock, but is itself nearly destroyed in the process. Captain Britain takes advantage of this and attacks The Fury, nearly defeating it but The Fury still proves too powerful for him. However, recalling the death of her husband, Captain UK attacks The Fury and tears it apart in a fit of rage and anger. The Fury is defeated and wouldn't resurface until many years later, in Uncanny X-Men No. 445, where it appears to have regenerated and attacked the X-Men. Captain Britain, Captain UK and Saturnyne are then transported to Otherworld by Roma, Merlyn's daughter. Merlyn had died during the battle between The Fury and Jaspers and Roma had transported Captain Britain, Captain UK and Saturnyne for Merlyn's funeral. During their time at the funeral, Roma reveals that Merlyn had used Captain UK as bait to draw The Fury to Earth-616 and help defeat Jaspers. Roma shows them that Earth is returning to normal and transports Captain Britain and Captain UK (Saturnyne returns to her own world) to Darkmoor on Earth-616. The story ends with both Captains sharing a kiss and heading their separate ways. Sequel A sequel to this story is told in the X-Men: Die by the Sword (2007), which brought the death of Roma and the end of the New Excalibur title. Collected editions The story was originally reprinted in 1995 as a seven issue mini-series called \\"X-Men Archives: Captain Britain\\". The mini-series reprinted the story in full colour for the first time. In 2002, the colourised version of the story was collected as a trade paperback. The trade paperback, simply titled \\"Captain Britain\\", omits the opening chapters of the storyline as written by writer Dave Thorpe, starting with Alan Moore's first issue on Captain Britain. Though Alan Moore gave his blessing over the reprinting of the arc, he later rescinded it when Marvel omitted crediting Alan Moore as co-creator for several characters introduced in the arc (most notably the Special Executives and the Fury). Later publications corrected this omission. Marvel has announced plans to release an Alan Moore/Alan Davis \\"Omnibus\\" hardcover of their respective works on Captain Britain. As such, the omnibus will feature the full and complete version of the \\"Jasper's Warp\\" storyline. The opening of the story, written by David Thorpe was collected as part of \\"Captain Britain: Legacy of A Legend\\" in 2016. () Die by the Sword was also collected in April 2008 ().

It caused 12 deaths and $400 million (2001 USD; $ USD) in damage when it hit Baja California in late September.Diapositiva 1 Meteorological history The tropical wave that later produced Juliette first produced Tropical Depression Nine in the Atlantic Ocean. Forming in the Caribbean Sea, the depression dissipated over Central America on September 20, a day after formation. By early on September 21, the remnants of Nine had re- organized in Pacific, and was then upgraded into a tropical depression. Six hours later, the depression was upgraded into a tropical storm. However, the storm was not named Juliette until later that day, when the storm was operationally believed to have formed (which came after reports from a Hurricane Hunter aircraft). In an environment of light wind shear, meteorologists predicted the new system to reach hurricane intensity within two days. Within off the coast of Guatemala, the system moved generally west- northwest over the next five days, paralleling the Mexican Riviera. While a major decrease in thunderstorm activity initially inhibited intensification it became better organized on September 22. By the afternoon of September 23, Juliette had become a hurricane, with maximum sustained winds reaching 75 mph (120 km/h). Upon becoming a hurricane, infrared imagery suggested that the hurricane had developed a pinhole eye. Forecasters were also expecting Juliette to reach major hurricane status, Category 3 or higher on the Saffir- Simpson Hurricane Scale. Steadily moving west, the storm underwent rapid deepening. By 1800 UTC September 23, Juliette had reached Category 2 status, with winds of 100 mph (145 km/h). Shortly thereafter, the hurricane intensified directly into a Category 4 storm, bypassing the Category 3 stage, an unusual occurrence for a tropical cyclone. In all, Juliette had intensified 60 mph (130 km/h) in 18 hours. After reaching its initial peak as a low-end Category 4 hurricane, microwave and Hurricane Hunter data indicated that Juliette underwent an eyewall replacement cycle. Subsequently, Juliette weakened into a Category 3 hurricane on September 24 and then into a high-end Category 2 system with 110 mph (160 km/h) winds; however, by September 25, Juliette had completed the cycle and quickly regained major hurricane status. The hurricane developed very cold cloud top temperatures. along with a classic structure of an intense hurricane and a very well-defined eye. A large hurricane, Juliette reached its peak intensity of 145 mph (230 km/h) and on the same day. Around that time, Reconnaissance Aircraft reported a minimum central pressure of 923 mbar. Hurricane Juliette with three simultaneous eyewalls on September 26 Shortly after its peak, a strong trough of low pressure brought Hurricane Juliette northward where the cyclone moved over cooler water temperatures. While Juliette initially maintained well-defined banding features and an impressive upper-level outflow, another eyewall replacement cycle took its toll on the storm; this time three centric eyewalls formed compared to the normal two, a very rare occurrence. Moving much farther east than anticipated, an eye was no longer visible on satellite imagery by September 27. Juliette slowed its forward motion as it continued north- northwestward and weakened to a tropical storm on September 28. Even though thunderstorm activity decreased markedly, Tropical Storm Juliette maintained a well-defined atmospheric circulation and a large area of gale-force winds. A small area of warm waters near the Baja California Peninsula allowed the storm to re-strengthen into a hurricane early on September 29 as convection increased. At this time, computer models suggested two distinct possibilities of the storm's path. Some suggested Hurricane Juliette might move inland while others expected the hurricane to parallel the peninsula. Meandering offshore, the center soon became difficult to locate. The low-level circulation became exposed from the deep convection as increased vertical shear again took its toll on Juliette, and the storm hit Baja California near Cabo San Lucas as a minimal tropical storm at 0000 UTC September 30. Although scientists noted the possibility of slight re-intensification over the Gulf of California, Juliette's low level circulation remained as it crossed the peninsula, and it restrengthened in the northern Gulf of California as the circulation became better defined. Lacking deep convection, it drifted westward, where, after making a landfall in northeastern Baja California, it finally dissipated early on October 3. Preparations Not long after Juliette was designated as a tropical storm on September 21, the Government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning for areas between Salina Cruz and Acapulco and a tropical storm watch for areas west of Acapulco to L√°zaro C√°rdenas, Michoac√°n. Later that day, the warning was updated to include areas through Zihuatanejo and a watch through Manzanillo, Colima. Once Juliette turned westward and no longer posed a threat to the country, all watches and warnings were discontinued by the afternoon of September 22. However, due to the system's slow, erratic track on September 23, a hurricane watch and tropical storm warning was issued for areas between L√°zaro C√°rdenas and Cabo Corrientes. These advisories remained in place through the afternoon of September 25, by which time Juliette had picked up forward momentum and tracked northwestward. By September 26, the hurricane threatened land once more, prompting watches and warnings for the Baja California Peninsula. Initially, only a tropical storm watch was issued for the southern tip of Baja California Sur but, as the storm neared the peninsula, more extensive advisories were declared. By the morning of September 27, a hurricane warning covered much of both coasts of Baja California Sur as the storm was forecast to track directly through the state. The following day, a tropical storm warning was issued for areas between Mazatl√°n and Yavaros in Sonora but, this was discontinued later that day. As the storm stalled offshore and weakened, all hurricane warnings were replaced with tropical storm warnings which were later canceled once Juliette weakened to a tropical depression. Forecasters also noted the possibility of moisture spreading into the Southwestern portion of the United States. Impact =Southern Mexico= Along coastal areas around Acapulco, the storm brought heavy rainfall and strong winds. Offshore, one fisherman was killed by the storm after he set sail directly into it. In Guerrero, heavy rains triggered flash floods that washed out two bridges and destroyed 20 homes. As rains continued to fall over the following days, mountainsides gave way, producing landslides which killed seven people. Strong winds also uprooted trees and downed power lines in several states. Additionally, two fishermen were listed as missing after venturing out into swells produced by Juliette. Throughout Michoac√°n, an estimated 1,000 people were left homeless by the hurricane. =Baja California Peninsula= Storm total rainfall for Juliette As Hurricane Juliette stalled just off the coast of Baja California Sur, it produced prolonged heavy rainfall in the region. A large swath of the state, along the eastern coast, received more than of rain and areas along the southern tip reported more than . A maximum of fell in Cauda√±o, the highest known total ever recorded from a tropical cyclone in the state. The extreme rainfall led to widespread flooding and mudslides across the state. Along the southern tip of the peninsula, roughly 3,000 people were stranded after their town was isolated by flood waters. About 800 more people had to be evacuated due to the state of their homes. Damage from the floods were widespread in the area, with more than 9,000 people reported damage to their property from the storm. At least two people were killed across the peninsula in storm-related incidents. Damage from Hurricane Juliet was estimated at $400 million (2001 USD; $ USD). =Southwestern United States= Late in Juliette's life and in her aftermath, the remnants brought strong thunderstorm activity to the American Southwest, knocking down trees and power lines in southern California. Rainfall in the United States peaked at 0.9 inches in Patagonia, Arizona. Aftermath and records Following the significant damage across southern states, Mexican authorities and the army deployed transport and rescue aircraft along with medical teams and emergency supplies. As reports of damage began to come out of Baja California Sur, the state governor declared the entire area a disaster zone. At its peak, Juliette attained a minimum pressure of 923 mbar (hPa; 27.26 inHg), ranking it as the fifth-strongest Pacific hurricane on record, along with Olivia in 1994. However, in subsequent years, five other storms have surpassed it and the storm now ranks as the tenth-strongest in the basin. At the time, it held the record for having the lowest barometric pressure of any Category 4 hurricane in the region, a record shared with Olivia; it has since been surpassed by Odile in 2014 with a minimum pressure of 918 mbar (hPa; 27.23 inHg) .

It is the third entry in their Parodius series, itself a parody spin-off of their Gradius series. Gameplay Arcade version screenshot, showing two players fighting the mini- boss of the second stage. To the bottom are the player's power meters, to the top are their score and life count. Gokuj≈ç Parodius is a horizontal-scrolling shooter, and a parody of the Gradius series of games. Players select one of eight playable characters to progress through the game with; these include: the Vic Viper, the starship from Gradius; TwinBee, the protagonist of his self-titled series; Pentarou, the penguin from Antarctic Adventure; Tako, a hat-wearing octopus; Hikaru, a Playboy bunny girl riding a rocket; Mambo, a mute sunfish; Michael, a stern angel pig; and Koitsu, a stickman riding a paper airplane. Each of these characters feature their own unique set of weapons, all being modified after the standard Gradius weapons. As in the Gradius games, players can unlock new weapons and abilities by collecting power capsules dropped by certain types of enemies, which will highlight an option on the player's \\"power meter\\" ‚Äî collecting additional capsules will give the player access to more powerful weapons. Some enemies will also drop bells from the TwinBee series that can also yield other abilities; the player can select which ability they want by firing additional shots at the bells to change their color. The game spans a total of seven stages, each gradually increasing in difficulty. These stages feature strange, often humorous themes to them, such as a UFO catcher machine, giant cookie-like castles, and Las Vegas-esc casino parlors. Stages also feature bosses at the end that must be defeated to progress, often paralleling those found throughout the Gradius series; one boss in particular pays tribute to the Big Core ship from the original Gradius, with its core being an enormous traffic light and firing road signs at the player. Some bosses and stage designs are also parodies of those in other shooters, such as R-Type, Xevious, Galaga and Thunder Force. The soundtrack consists of remixes of well-known classical music, as well as tracks from Gradius and other Konami games such as TwinBee. Development Gokuj≈ç Parodius was created by programmer and planner Tokuda Tsukasa, alongside designer Jujiro \\"\\"Shuzilow.ha\\" Hamakawa, sound designer Kazuhiro Senoo, and Konami Development Section 2 chief Masahiro Inoue. Shuzilow was previously a character designer in the animation industry, and had worked on both Detana!! TwinBee (1991) and Gaiapolis (1993). After completing work on Parodius Da, Tsukasa turned to producing games for home consoles, namely the PC Engine and Sharp X68000. He was eventually offered a chance to return to Konami's arcade division, to where he began thinking of ideas for what kind of game he wanted to make next; he worked almost exclusively on the Parodius series, and after noticing that employees were interested in a new game in the series, Tsukasa's boss requested that he work on another Parodius as an \\"anniversary\\" title, as a way to announce his return to the arcade industry. Tsukasa was also annoyed by the fact that arcades in Japan were mostly filled with fighting games, and felt that a new shooting game would help make it stick out. One of the first things that the development team focused on was the character roster. Tsukasa originally planned to have the game's roster be made up of six characters; his boss suggested it should be increased to eight, as most fighting games at the time had large character rosters. Tsukasa wanted the character selection to have a focus on living creatures instead of generic ships or fighter craft. Mambo, the ocean sunfish, was based on the MSX2 game Space Manbow, while the rocket-riding bunny girl Hikaru was added to please otakus. The stern-eyed angel pig Michael was made after thinking of how to make a pig character appear cute. The stickman Koitsu was based on an idea that Tsukasa had, where he tried making several small character sprites that moved around in action poses; the paper airplane was added to give him something to fly on, as Tsukasa felt it was weird to have him pilot a ship or other mecha design. Shuzilow recalls having difficulty animating Koitsu due to his paper-thin character design. Koitsu's shield was also originally made of fire, before being abruptly changed to a giant condom. The team also experimented with modifying the characters themselves, such as giving them fewer Options or increasing the hitboxes of projectiles; the Vic Viper, for instance, originally would have a strong hatch shield that could withstand multiple bullets without breaking, but be instantly shattered by a single laser. The difficulty of the game was said to be higher than previous Parodius games. The \\"YOU LOSE\\" game over message was added right before the project deadline to intentionally frustrate the player, a concept shared by fighting games. The \\"Semi-Auto\\" playmode was added to make players mostly unfamiliar with shooters able to play it more easily; Tsukasa had previously used this concept in the Super Famicom conversion of Gradius III. Shuzilow designed most of the in-game bosses; when designing the stage 4 boss \\"Crazy Core\\", he envisioned it to originally be a generic robot-like character with traffic lights, but after making further additions to its design made it what he called \\"absurd and unrecognizable\\". Eliza, the mermaid-like boss in the second stage, was created to attract salarymen to the game with her sex appeal; it is believed that she is also based on the Dobkeratops, the first stage boss from R-Type. Shuzilow claims his favorite boss to design was the pillow-like capsule boss from the fifth stage, nicknamed \\"mizumakura\\" during production; it was created to be easy for bad players, as it shoots out power capsules as its \\"attack\\". The stage 6 boss, a Geisha sporting bunny ears, is a homage to the biwa player enemy from Namco's Genpei Toma Den. Senoo composed the soundtrack, being his first video game project. He wanted to give the soundtrack the feeling of an American variety show, in contrast to the Japanese-like compositions in Parodius Da!. The development team worked with the Japanese Society for Rights of Authors, Composers and Publishers (JASRAC) organization to select pieces of classical music they felt were suitable for the game. Senoo was also a major fan of the soundtrack for Gradius, and was largely inspired by a CD he had that featured remixes of well-known Gradius tracks. The game's subtitle, translating to Pursue the Glory of the Past, was chosen by Tsukasa to express his wish that the Japanese arcade game industry to go \\"back to its roots\\" instead of being filled with mostly fighters. Release Gokuj≈ç Parodius was ported to the Super Famicom on November 25, 1994 in Japan. Two significant differences between the console and arcade version were added characters: Goemon/Ebisumaru from Ganbare Goemon, Dracula- Kun/Kid-D from Kid Dracula and Upa/Rupa from Bio Miracle Bokutte Upa and the alternating two player mode. In addition, Hikaru and Akane gets a Tailgun, Boomerang Shot from Thunder Cross, another shooter game by Konami, and a Shield instead of the Spread Bomb, the Carrot Shot and a force field (named \\"Star\\") that they get in the arcade version (as well as on the Deluxe Pack released for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn). Similarly, Mambo and Samba are given Homing Missiles, the Reflect Shot (which gives them two options when chosen), Grade Up and a Shield instead of the Bubble Missile, the Control Laser, Search Laser and a force-field (named \\"Barrier\\"). Gokuj≈ç Parodius was also ported along with Parodius Da! on Gokuj≈ç Parodius Da! Deluxe Pack for PlayStation in 1994 and Sega Saturn in 1995. This compilation was released in Japan and Europe. The European release was released as Parodius, with Parodius Da! simply titled Parodius and Gokuj≈ç Parodius as Fantastic Journey. It was also released for mobile phones and included in Parodius Portable on the PlayStation Portable, with some songs replaced by classical/folk songs. Reception Gokuj≈ç Parodius was a commercial success, with Game Machine reporting that it was the fourth most-successful arcade game of June 1994. Edge magazine listed it as the fifth most-popular PCB arcade game. German publication Maniac commended the game's variety in levels, character selection and humor, as well as its usage of classical music. They favorably compared it to the R-Type series for its gameplay, and recommended it for fans of the Gradius series. Mega Fun magazine praised the Super Famicom version's humor, \\"pleasing\\" visuals and gameplay, although they disliked its occasional slowdown and graphical flicker. The Sega Saturn and PlayStation versions, included in Gokuj≈ç Parodius Da! Deluxe Pack, were met with a similarly positive response. Famitsu commended the version's accurate portrayal of the arcade original, while also applauding its responsive controls and colorful visuals. GameFan recommended the game to Gradius and shooter fans for its gameplay, multiplayer mode and humor, expressing hope in it being released in North America. Maximum said that it is virtually identical to the arcade and PlayStation versions and has very pleasing gameplay, visuals, and music, but is outdated compared to contemporary Saturn games. They summarized, \\"Konami's first effort [at a Saturn game] has a lot to commend it, but when there are epics such as Panzer Dragoon stretching the shooting genre, it's clear that Parodius is not in the same league.\\" In a 2015 retrospective review of the Parodius series, Hardcore Gaming 101 commended Gokuj≈ç for its humor, multiplayer, soundtrack and interesting level designs. They also applauded the Super Famicom version's accurate portrayal of the original arcade game, liking its graphics, music and additional characters.

The strike line of a bed, fault, or other planar feature, is a line representing the intersection of that feature with a horizontal plane. On a geologic map, this is represented with a short straight line segment oriented parallel to the strike line. Strike (or strike angle) can be given as either a quadrant compass bearing of the strike line (N25¬∞E for example) or in terms of east or west of true north or south, a single three digit number representing the azimuth, where the lower number is usually given (where the example of N25¬∞E would simply be 025), or the azimuth number followed by the degree sign (example of N25¬∞E would be 025¬∞). The dip gives the steepest angle of descent of a tilted bed or feature relative to a horizontal plane, and is given by the number (0¬∞-90¬∞) as well as a letter (N,S,E,W) with rough direction in which the bed is dipping downwards. One technique is to always take the strike so the dip is 90¬∞ to the right of the strike, in which case the redundant letter following the dip angle is omitted (right hand rule, or RHR). The map symbol is a short line attached and at right angles to the strike symbol pointing in the direction which the planar surface is dipping down. The angle of dip is generally included on a geologic map without the degree sign. Beds that are dipping vertically are shown with the dip symbol on both sides of the strike, and beds that are level are shown like the vertical beds, but with a circle around them. Both vertical and level beds do not have a number written with them. Strike and dip of the beds. 1-Strike, 2-Dip direction, 3-Apparent dip 4-Angle of dip Strike and dip Strike line and dip of a plane describing attitude relative to a horizontal plane and a vertical plane perpendicular to the strike line Another way of representing strike and dip is by dip and dip direction. The dip direction is the azimuth of the direction the dip as projected to the horizontal (like the trend of a linear feature in trend and plunge measurements), which is 90¬∞ off the strike angle. For example, a bed dipping 30¬∞ to the South, would have an East-West strike (and would be written 090¬∞/30¬∞ S using strike and dip), but would be written as 30/180 using the dip and dip direction method. Strike and dip are determined in the field with a compass and clinometer or a combination of the two, such as a Brunton compass named after D.W. Brunton, a Colorado miner. Compass-clinometers which measure dip and dip direction in a single operation (as pictured) are often called \\"stratum\\" or \\"Klar\\" compasses after a German professor. Smartphone apps are also now available, that make use of the internal accelerometer to provide orientation measurements. Combined with the GPS functionality of such devices, this allows readings to be recorded and later downloaded onto a map. Any planar feature can be described by strike and dip. This includes sedimentary bedding, faults and fractures, cuestas, igneous dikes and sills, metamorphic foliation and any other planar feature in the Earth. Linear features are measured with very similar methods, where \\"plunge\\" is the dip angle and \\"trend\\" is analogous to the dip direction value. Apparent dip is the name of any dip measured in a vertical plane that is not perpendicular to the strike line. True dip can be calculated from apparent dip using trigonometry if the strike is known. Geologic cross sections use apparent dip when they are drawn at some angle not perpendicular to strike.

Home men's and women's basketball and volleyball games are held in the gymnasium, the team nickname being the Gaels. Many athletic camps for youths also use the gym, primarily in the summer, and other on-campus events, such as the Baccalaureate mass, are also held there. Banners commemorating successful seasons, championships and post-season appearances for all Saint Mary's sports hang on the back wall. At well-attended games, the court-level bleachers opposite the benches are reserved entirely for students. Common criticism of the gym, including by students, is its age and size. It is one of the smaller gyms in the West Coast Conference. The seating is mainly along two sides, running along the long sides of the court. Behind one basket is a large wall, and behind another a handful of elevated, VIP seats. Seating is mostly bleacher-style, not stadium style. However, many feel that the small size of the gym adds to the intensity of the crowd at sold-out games, when the cheers of 3,500 fans are amplified due to the small space. Because of this, McKeon Pavilion is considered by many to be one of the tougher gyms to play in for an opposing team. Current athletic director Mark Orr has said there are design plans that would knock out the front and back walls of the gym, adding 1,000 seats, but there is not yet funding for the project. With gym renovations years away, the college has made several upgrades to the facility. Prior to the 2005-2006 season new floors were installed. Before the 2006-2007 season, the lower level reserved seating (directly behind the benches) was changed from bleachers to stadium-style seats with backs. The bleachers in the student section (also known as Gaelforce) - opposite the benches - were painted dark blue. Large banners were hung from the railings separating the upper and lower seating sections, reading \\"Saint Mary's College\\" behind the reserved seating and \\"Gaelforce\\" behind the student section. In the 21st century, the arena's culture has increasingly reflected the Gaels' strong Australian connections, with at least one Australian player on the men's basketball roster in each season since 2001‚Äì02 (among them current NBA players Patty Mills and Matthew Dellavedova) and a program record of seven in the 2016‚Äì17 season. The student section has been filled with Australian flags, a large Australian flag is now prominently displayed on a back wall of the arena, and the student section regularly responds to big plays with the \\"Aussie, Aussie, Aussie\\" chant. In recent memory, the gym has seen the 2001 women's basketball team and the 2005 men's basketball team reach the NCAA Tournament. The women's volleyball team has also achieved much success, reaching the post-season in 2004-2006. During the 2004‚Äì2005 season the men's basketball team posted a 15‚Äì1 record in their home gym en route to a bubble NCAA tournament berth. On January 8, 2005, the men's basketball team defeated West Coast Conference powerhouse Gonzaga University 89‚Äì81 in McKeon, ending a 17-game losing streak against the Zags and handing Gonzaga its first conference loss in 17 games. It opened January 21, 1978. It is the largest enclosed arena in Contra Costa County. In 2019, the name was changed to University Credit Union Pavilion.

In 2002, after initially being caught diluting several doses of chemotherapy drugs, he pleaded guilty to intentionally diluting 98,000 prescriptions involving multiple types of drugs, which were given to 4,200 patients, and was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison.  Early life and education  Courtney was born in Hays, Kansas. His father was a traveling minister based in Scott City, and described Courtney as an \\"ideal son.\\" He played the trombone at Wichita South High School. Courtney graduated from the School of Pharmacy at University of Missouri‚ÄìKansas City in 1975.  Adult life  In 1986, Courtney became the owner of Research Medical Tower Pharmacy in Kansas City, where he had worked for some time. He primarily mixed intravenous drugs. Before his arrest, Courtney served as a deacon at Northland Cathedral, an Assemblies of God megachurch in Kansas City. In 1992, he and his first wife divorced; Courtney retained custody of their two daughters. His second marriage lasted four or five days and was later annulled. In 1994 his third wife, Laura Courtney, gave birth to twins. In August 2001, the same month he was arrested, Courtney held total assets worth $18.7 million.  Dilution fraud  In 1990, Courtney began purchasing pharmaceuticals on the gray market and using them to fill prescriptions at his pharmacy. In time he began diluting prescriptions to increase profits. Both practices were illegal. In 1998, Eli Lilly sales representative Darryl Ashley noticed Courtney was selling three times the amount that he'd bought of the cancer drug Gemzar. Lilly initiated an internal investigation but found no evidence of illegality and closed the investigation without further action. In early 2001, several nurses in the office of Dr. Verda Hunter (now Hicks), an oncologist in Courtney's building, noticed that several of Hunter's patients weren't experiencing the debilitating side effects that are normally the case with chemotherapy regimens. They voiced their concerns to Ashley, who wondered if Hunter's patients were actually getting the full prescribed dose. When he reviewed the utilization records, he discovered the same problem that he'd seen in 1998; Courtney appeared to be selling Gemzar for $20 per vial less than what the drug was worth at the market, appearing to take a substantial loss. Combined with the lack of side effects, it led Ashley to suspect that Courtney might be diluting the drugs. Ashley said years later that if he was right, Courtney was committing \\"a hideous crime.\\" Hunter also noticed that many of her patients were only suffering mild side effects, and their condition didn't seem to be improving. Hunter had medication that had been supplied by Courtney tested. The results showed that the sample contained less than one-third of the drug prescribed. Upon receiving the test results back, Hunter immediately cut ties with Courtney and notified the FBI. Investigators with the FBI and FDA initially didn't believe that a pharmacist would do something so egregious; pharmacists have long been among the most trusted professionals in the country and the world. They initially hoped there was an innocent explanation. However, when Hunter showed them the test results, they realized that she was telling the truth. Hunter submitted seven additional samples for testing by the FDA's forensic chemistry lab. Tests on those samples revealed that they only contained a fraction of the prescribed dosage‚Äìas little as 15 percent, and at most 39 percent. They immediately knew that they had to move quickly. While health care fraud cases normally take years to build, the investigators knew they didn't have that long. They spared no expense to stop Courtney, considering it a matter of public safety. Investigators believed that Courtney took a base dose of chemotherapy drugs and split it between three prescriptions, then sold them to oncologists for the same price as a full dose. He took advantage of the fact that oncologists are usually concerned mainly with chemotherapy's effects on the body, not the amount of the dose. While he was supposed to prepare infusions with $3,000 worth of chemotherapy drugs, the solutions he prepared were equivalent to only $700, turning a significant profit. Even with damning evidence that Courtney was diluting drugs, federal prosecutors asked the FBI and FDA to establish a chain of custody in order to get probable cause for an arrest. Prosecutors believed that since there were other pharmacists in the building, they needed to tie any diluted drugs directly to Courtney and show he was the only one who was diluting drugs. With With this in mind, investigators persuaded Hunter to help them in a sting operation. Hunter gave Courtney several prescriptions for fictitious patients. Courtney mixed the drugs, initialed the infusion bags, and personally took them to Hunter's office. Federal agents had them tested at the FDA lab. The samples contained less than 30 percent of the prescribed dosage, and in some cases contained no detectable chemotherapy at all. Agents believed that giving patients infusions with no active drugs was no different than giving them saline solution. On August 13, 2001, federal agents raided Research Medical Tower Pharmacy. They told Courtney that they were investigating a pharmacist, and needed to get information about who prepared the chemo infusions for Hunter's patients. Courtney acknowledged he'd prepared them‚Äìand thus unwittingly confessed to diluting drugs. On August 14, federal agents told Courtney that he was the target of the investigation, and shut his pharmacy down. On August 15, Courtney surrendered to authorities and was charged with one count of adulterating and misbranding drugs. Investigators reported that before turning himself in, Courtney gave $80,000 in cash, and more than 100 doses of Prozac to his wife. The news of Courtney's arrest sent the Kansas City area into a panic. The FBI urged anyone who had ever received chemotherapy infusions from Courtney to come forward. Faced with the mounting evidence, Courtney gave investigators a list of three medications that he diluted, and a list of 34 affected patients. He claimed to have only started diluting drugs a few months ago, a claim no one believed. He openly admitted he did it to pay off a $1 million donation to the Northland Cathedral building fund. On August 23, 2001, Courtney was indicted on 20 counts of tampering with consumer products and adulterating and misbranding drugs. Many patients and survivors wanted him charged with murder, as did federal investigators. While the FBI and FDA believed he was essentially a serial killer, federal prosecutors believed a murder charge would be hard to prove since many patients were suffering from late-stage cancer. Additionally, onocology experts told the FBI that there was no way to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the diluted chemotherapy directly contributed to patients dying. Courtney also was named as a defendant in approximately 300 suits for fraud and wrongful death. In one case a jury awarded the plaintiff, Georgia Hayes, a total of $2.2 billion in damages. Although Hayes knew she would likely never see that money because his assets had been frozen, she wanted to send a message that this type of deceit was not worth the cost. Eli Lilly and Bristol Myers-Squibb were named in several of the civil suits. Eli Lilly ultimately settled the suits for $48 million, while Bristol Myers-Squibb paid $24 million. Facing the prospect of life in prison if convicted at trial, on February 20, 2002, Courtney pleaded guilty to 20 federal counts of tampering and adulterating the chemotherapy drugs Taxol and Gemzar. He also acknowledged that he and his corporation, Courtney Pharmacy Inc., had weakened drugs, conspired to traffic in stolen drugs and caused the filing of false Medicare claims. Prosecutors sought a plea deal because they believed it was the only way to get to the bottom of his scheme. According to law enforcement estimates, as well as his own confession, from 1992 to 2001 Courtney diluted 98,000 prescriptions from 400 doctors, which were given to 4,200 patients. Courtney admitted to diluting 72 different kinds of drugs. Besides chemotherapy treatments, he admitted diluting medications for diabetes and AIDS patients, as well as fertility treatments. He subsequently admitted that he began diluting drugs as early as when he began his career in 1975‚Äìas he put it, \\"whatever I could dilute, I did dilute.\\" Over the course of his career, he earned over $19 million, a figure that FBI agent Melissa Osborne called \\"blood money.\\" On December 5, 2002, Courtney was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison. In 2008, an episode of American Greed, entitled \\"Deadly ‚Ñû For Greed\\", recounted Courtney's crimes, trial and conviction. In 2020, an episode of Oxygen's License to Kill, entitled \\"Deadly Pharmacist,\\" chronicled Courtney's misdeeds. Courtney, Federal Bureau of Prisons inmate number 14536-045, started his sentence at Gilmer Federal Correctional Institution near Glenville, West Virginia before being transferred to Englewood Federal Correctional Institution near Littleton, Colorado. His earliest possible release date had been November 20, 2027, when he will be 75 years old. However, on July 6, Courtney was released from prison seven years early due to the COVID-19 pandemic; he will serve the remainder of his sentence on house arrest in Trimble, Missouri.

Born in rural Virginia, he served in the Confederacy during the American Civil War and, later, as a civilian scout for the US Army during the Indian Wars. Before his untimely death, Texas Jack became a legendary figure in the American Old West as a Western showman performing dramas on the stage throughout the country, and was immortalized in dime novels published around the world. Early life Omohundro was born in Palmyra on the Pleasure Hill farm in Fluvanna County, Virginia, on July 26, 1846, to John Burwell and Catherine Baker Omohundro of Anglo-American ancestry. He attended grammar school in Fluvanna and at an early age showed a strong skill in hunting and fishing.Omohundro (1950), p. 512. At the start of the American Civil War, Omohundro attempted to join his older brother, Orville, in the Confederate Army. He was twice refused for his age, but was allowed to serve as a courier at the headquarters of the Virginia Militia under Major General John B. Floyd. Because of his youth and knowledge of the countryside, he became known as the \\"Boy Scout of the Confederacy\\". In February 1864, at the age of 17, he successfully enlisted as a private in Company G of the 5th Virginia Cavalry, part of the Army of Northern Virginia, and was soon serving directly in General J.E.B. Stuart's command as a courier and scout. At the Battle of Yellow Tavern, he delivered a scouting report to Stuart only minutes before the general was killed in battle. During the Battle of Trevilian Station, Omohundro was wounded and admitted to the Confederate States General Hospital in Charlottesville on June 20, 1864. After recovering from his injuries, and a short leave home, he returned to his company and scouted under the command of General Lunsford L. Lomax. Following the Third Battle of Winchester, the 5th Virginia Cavalry was consolidated with the 15th Virginia Cavalry, where Omohundro scouted under General Fitzhugh Lee during the last months of the war.Omohundro (1950), pp. 513‚Äì515.Logan (1954), pp. 9‚Äì18. Cowboy, hunting, and scouting career After the Civil War, Omohundro left Virginia at age 19 for Florida. After a short time, he moved on to Texas, arriving at the Taylor Ranch near Brazos, where he began working as a cowboy participating in cattle drives, notably on the Chisholm Trail. After one drive across Arkansas to a meat-poor Tennessee, he was given nickname \\"Texas Jack\\" by the locals. On another drive, Omohundro found a five-year-old boy orphaned after a Native American raid killed his family. He brought the boy to safety in Fort Worth, and the boy later took the name Texas Jack Jr. in homage, going on to run the Texas Jack's Wild West Show and Circus in 1903 in South Africa.Yagoda (2000), p. 58. In 1869, Texas Jack moved to Fort Hays, Kansas, where he met California Joe Milner and Wild Bill Hickok, the latter being sheriff of Ellis County at the time. Later that year, Jack met and befriended William F. \\"Buffalo Bill\\" Cody, who was working with the 5th U.S. Cavalry at Fort McPherson, and Jack was hired as a scout and trail guide during the Indian Wars.Logan (1954), pp. 31‚Äì33; 45. Special permission had to be obtained as the U.S. government did not generally permit the employment of ex- Confederate soldiers. During the Battle of Summit Springs, Texas Jack captured his well-known white horse from Indian Chief Tall Bull. Texas Jack moved to Cottonwood Springs, Nebraska, where, aside from his work as a scout for the government, he made a lucrative living leading hunting expeditions for American and foreign parties, which were popular at the time. Notably, Texas Jack, together with Cody, led the highly publicized royal hunt of 1872 with Grand Duke Alexei of Russia and several American military figures, including General Philip Sheridan, General George Armstrong Custer, and Colonel James W. Forsyth.Cody (1920), p. 230. Later in 1874, Texas Jack guided the Earl of Dunraven though Yellowstone and Geyserland.Dunraven (1917), p. 50. In 1876, Texas Jack led Sir John Rea Reid and his party on a hunt around the Bighorn Mountains and Sweetwater country. Acting Ned Buntline, Buffalo Bill Cody, Giuseppina Morlacchi, Texas Jack Omohundro In December 1872, Omohundro and Cody debuted the first Wild West show, Scouts of the Prairie, in Chicago written and produced by Ned Buntline.Hall (2001), p. 54. Texas Jack's performance was well-received by critics and featured the first rope act performed on the American stage.Logan (1954), p. 73. The show starred Giuseppina Morlacchi, a dancer and actress from Milan, Italy, who was performing in the theater circuit with her Morlacchi Ballet Troupe when she was invited to join Scouts of the Prairie with the group.Barker (1984), p. 130. Texas Jack and she fell in love and were married on August 31, 1873, at St. Mary's Catholic Church in Rochester, New York. In 1873, Buntline left, and Wild Bill Hickok joined the group to headline in a new play called Scouts of the Plains. Hickok did not enjoy acting, often hiding behind scenery, and in one show, he shot the spotlight when it focused on him. He was released from the group after a few months. Desiring a lighter tour schedule, Texas Jack parted ways with Cody, and in 1877, he formed his own acting troupe in St. Louis, known as the Texas Jack Combination featuring Morlacchi, Arizona John Burke, Modoc War scout Donald McKay, trick-shot Maud Oswald, and several Sweetwater and Warm Spring Indians. In May of that year, he debuted Texas Jack in the Black Hills, written by Harry Seymour, to rave reviews. Other plays the combination performed included The Trappers Daughter, Life on the Border, and The French Spy. Dime novels Beadles Dime Novel In the late 19th century, dime novels depicting frontier life were becoming common, and Texas Jack became a popular subject of these stories. The dime novels, printed on inexpensive wood pulp paper and costing five to ten cents each, were published weekly or monthly. One of the first of these novels was titled Texas Jack; or The White King of the Pawnees, written by Ned Buntline, and first appeared in 1872. Texas Jack's popularity grew as he was featured on covers by publishers including Beadle's New York Dime Library, the Nickle Library, Log Cabin Library, DeWitt's Ten Cent, Street and Smith, and others. Many of these stories were written by the prolific author Prentiss Ingraham. Omohundro wrote articles in newspapers across the country recalling his hunting and scouting stories, and is credited as having authored one dime novel titled Ned Wylde, the Boy Scout for Beadle and Adams in 1876.Johannsen (1950), p. 217. In 1900, Joel Chandler Harris wrote On the Wing of Occasions, a series for the Saturday Evening Post, that featured Texas Jack and the Confederate Secret Service in a fictional plot to kidnap President Lincoln. At the time, the stories caused some outrage since it associated Texas Jack with John Wilkes Booth, and after publication, Harris received several letters objecting to Texas Jack's portrayal and attempts to clear his name.Harris (1900), p. 4.Harris; Wooten (1918), p. 427. In 1906, Verlagshaus f√ºr Volkslitteratur und Kunst, Berlin, published a series of dime novels in German, titled \\"Texas Jack, Der Grosse Kundschafter\\" (Texas Jack, the Great Scout). Inspired by Omohundro, the stories are of the fictional Jack Hawkins, an orphan who becomes a scout and cowboy in the American West engaging in skirmishes with Indians and opium smugglers, while some stories are set during the Mormon War and in Maximilian's Mexico. In Germany, the novels were republished in three subsequent series, and they were translated into eight languages - French \\"Texas Jack, la Terreur Des Indiens\\" (Texas Jack, the Terror of the Indians), Swedish \\"Texas Jack, Amerikas mest ber√∂mde indianbek√§mpare\\" (Texas Jack, America's Famous Indian Fighter), Finnish, Danish, Polish, Dutch, Portuguese, and Italian. In 1966, \\"Lion\\", a weekly comic by Fleetway, published a series about Omohundro titled \\"Texas Jack\\", which was released in the United Kingdom and Australia after earlier success they had with other Western-themed comics such as \\"Cowboy Comics\\", \\"Buffalo Bill\\", and \\"Kit Carson\\". Unlike earlier dime novels, they were formatted like comics, and the stories were illustrated using panels.Kibble-White (2005), pp. 157‚Äì161. In 1972, the \\"Lion\\" comics were translated into Spanish and reissued with new cover art by the Roll√°n publishing house of Madrid for distribution in Spain. Death and legacy The grave of Texas Jack in Evergreen Cemetery Texas Jack and Morlacchi settled in Massachusetts with a home in downtown Lowell and a small farm in Billerica. In the spring of 1880, after several performances in the region, the couple decided to sojourn in the silver-mining town of Leadville, Colorado. There, Omohundro became acquainted with Horace Tabor and briefly joined Tabor's Light Cavalry, a local militia formed to keep order in the newly founded town.Logan (1954), p. 183. A few months after arriving, Texas Jack contracted a cold, which developed into pneumonia, and he died weeks later. The funeral was well- attended, and he was given full military honors, with several military companies in attendance firing a three-volley salute as his flag-draped coffin was lowered into the ground. His final resting place is Evergreen Cemetery in Leadville. Shortly after Texas Jack's death, Morlacchi returned to their home in Lowell. She never toured again.Logan (1954), p. 190. After several years, the grave fell into disrepair, and a traveling group of comedians raised funds to provide for its upkeep. In 1908, while passing through Leadville, Cody visited the cemetery and commissioned a granite grave marker for his old friend, mistakenly listing Texas Jack's age as 39 years.Omohundro (1950), p. 523. In 1980, the Texas Jack Association was formed to preserve and promote Texas Jack's memory. In 1994, Texas Jack Omohundro was inducted into the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in the Hall of Great Western Performers.

It is one of three endemic deer species in the Philippines, although it was not recognized as a separate species until 1983. An estimated 2,500 mature individuals survived worldwide as of 1996, according to the IUCN, although it is uncertain of how many of them still survive in the wild. The diet of the deer, which consists of a variety of different types of grasses, leaves, and buds within the forest, is the primary indicator of its habitat. Since 1991 the range of the species has severely decreased and is now almost co-extensive with that of the Visayan warty pig. In April 2009 an expedition team of British and Filipino mountaineers and scientists discovered evidence of two separate groups of deer in the North Negros Natural Park. These signs (scat and feeding sites) are believed to be the first scientific evidence of the deer's activity for over 25 years. It is estimated that an estimated 300 animals survive on the island of Negros. Conservation efforts are currently underway with the intention of preserving the remaining population of the species but are poorly funded and supported. In 2012, the Negros Interior Biodiversity Expedition camera trapped the centre of the North Negros Natural Park and gained the first photos take in the wild of the species. Description Female specimen in captivity Young male The deer is small and short-legged yet it is the largest endemic species of deer among the Visayas. Adults range from long from the head to the base of the tail, in shoulder height and in weight. This species is easily distinguished from other species of deer in the Philippines by the distinctive \\"A\\" pattern of beige spots which dot its deep brown back and sides. Other distinctive features include cream underparts and white fur on the chin and lower lip. The animal's head and neck are brown, but lighter than the body, and the eyes are ringed with paler fur. Males are larger than females and have short, thick, bumpy antlers. Behavior and ecology =Habitat= The species' range once covered the shoreline up to at least 2,000 m above sea level. Its habitat is in dense cogon grassland, and primary and secondary forest. Most of its habitat consists of areas where its diet of young shoots of cogon grass and young low-growing leaves and buds are plentiful. Besides areas that are dense in vegetation, it could also thrive in places it could graze. They may also visit burnt-out forest clearings for the floral ash. Due to the now restricted range of the deer, it is impossible to ascertain the preferred habitat of the species. =Breeding= The deer breed from November to December, although mating could begin earlier. Males have a roaring call to attract females. Reports mostly mention a single calf with a mated pair, although conclusive evidence on the number of young is not available because of the rarity of sightings. Calves are born after a gestation period of around 240 days. Weaning takes place at six months and the calves are mature from 12 months. Conservation This species is fully protected under Philippine law. Hunting and forest clearances as a result of logging activities and agricultural conversion are thought to be the causes of a devastating drop in the numbers of the deer (a 1991 survey found that the deer was present in only 5% of its former range). Despite this, the deer still exist in the more remote areas, specifically in the protected habitats of Mt. Canlaon National Park, North Negros Forest Reserve, Southern Candoni, and West Panay Mountains (a proposed National Park). In 1990, the Philippine Spotted Deer Conservation Program was set up to facilitate the conservation of the species. Some of the deer have been held in captivity in Mari-it Conservation Centre in Panay, two breeding centers in Negros, and in a number of European zoos. Since 1987, Silliman University Mammal Conservation Program, through the Center for Tropical Studies (CENTROP), has been engaged in the deer's captive breeding. The success of the program has led some of the captive-bred to be released in the interior forests of southern Negros, particularly in the interior of Basay, Negros Oriental. =Threats= Deforestation has greatly contributed in the decline of the deer. Hunting, both by locals and sport hunters has also made an impact; subsistence hunting, sales of venison to local markets and speciality restaurants, and live trapping for the pet trade have all contributed to the species' dwindling numbers. Isolation and reduction of population is likely to have led to some herds becoming moribund. While cross- breeding with R. mariannus has been observed in captivity, the lack of a common range means this is unlikely to be a problem in the wild. Due to the severe pressures faced by the deer, the IUCN has twice listed it as an endangered species: firstly in 1994 (when it was de-listed within the year) and again in 1996 (which listing has continued until the present). The limited numbers of the animal in the wild (at least 300, down from almost 1,600) has led to the belief that prospects for its survival are bleak. Rediscovery On April 2009, footprints and animal droppings belonging to the creature were found in the North Negros Natural Park by a scientific team of six British, five Filipinos, and one Irishman, who were studying the biodiversity of the park. The team, who were from Negros Interior Biodiversity Expedition, estimate that less 300 members of the species survive. The team discovered a set of footprints beside a river three days into the expedition. The distance between these footprints and a half-eaten set of young palm trees, which were found three days later, indicated that two groups of deer might be present in the nature preserve. Subsequently, the team found small piles of 20 to 30 pellets with a trail of deer footprints leading away. Because \\"other species such as the Visayan warty pigs and civet cats have distinctly different scat\\", the team were confident that the pellets belonged to the deer. This was the first evidence of a live wild population of the deer for more than ten years. The team was thrilled by their success, although one of the expedition leaders, Craig Turner, admitted \\"this discovery confirms [the deer] are surviving, but doesn't tell us they are thriving\\". Besides the deer, other species discovered were some unusual plants, including ground orchids and pitcher plants, and many bird and frog species. Specimens were sent to the cities of Bacolod and Dumaguete for further analysis. The animal was later featured in a front-page story in the Philippine Daily Inquirer on 24 May 2009 in the story \\"The World's Rarest Deer Still Roam Negros\\". In the story, the British Ambassador declared the find \\"an exciting discovery\\". The expedition team is reportedly set to present their findings to the Royal Geographical Society. Researchers involved in the expedition commented that \\"more protection\\" of the deer and similar endangered species in the park [is needed] \\"in order to assure their survival\\". They also said in the statement that \\"Philippine forests still harbor many rare and unique species, found nowhere else in the world\\". The expedition was sponsored by several environmental institutions and foundations, which are interested in promoting and protecting the biodiversity, present within the United Kingdom as well as in the Visayas in the Philippines, such as the Negros Forests and Ecological Foundation Inc., Silliman University, Coral Cay Conservation, and the Zoological Society of London. In 2013, there were reports of sightings in the Southern Candoni region, indicating Silliman's releases in Basay have successfully expanded north.

Zuroff, the director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center office in Jerusalem, is the coordinator of Nazi war crimes research worldwide for the Wiesenthal Center and the author of its annual \\"Status Report\\" on the worldwide investigation and prosecution of Nazi war criminals which includes a list of \\"most wanted\\" Nazi war criminals. Early life Born in New York City, Zuroff moved to Israel in 1970 after completing his undergraduate degree in history (with honors) at Yeshiva University and high school studies at Yeshiva University High School for Boys. He obtained an M.A. degree in Holocaust studies at the Institute of Contemporary Jewry of the Hebrew University, where he also completed his Ph.D., which chronicles the response of Orthodox Jewry in the United States to the Holocaust and focuses on the rescue attempts launched by the Vaad ha-Hatzala rescue committee established by American Orthodox rabbis in 1939. In 2000, Yeshiva University Press and KTAV Publishing House published his study of the history of the Vaad ha-Hatzala, which was awarded an Egit Grant for Holocaust and Jewish Resistance Literature by the Israeli General Federation of Labor (Histadrut) and also received the 1999-2000 Samuel Belkin Literary Award for the best book published by a Yeshiva University alumnus in the field of Jewish studies. Career =Simon Wiesenthal Center= In 1978, he was invited to be the first director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, where he played a leading role in establishing the Center‚Äôs library and archives and was historical advisor for the Center‚Äôs Academy award-winning documentary Genocide. He returned to Israel in 1980, where he served as a researcher for the U.S. Justice Department‚Äôs Office of Special Investigations. His efforts assisted in the preparation of cases against numerous Nazi war criminals living in the United States. He rejoined the Wiesenthal Center in 1986 and uncovered the postwar escape of hundreds of Nazi war criminals to Australia, Canada, Great Britain and other countries. He continued to coordinate the center's international efforts to bring Holocaust perpetrators to justice. These efforts have influenced the passage of special laws in Canada (1987), Australia (1989) and Great Britain (1991) which enable the prosecution in those countries of Nazi war criminals. Since the fall of Communism and the collapse of the Soviet Union, Zuroff has played a major role in the efforts to convince Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia and other post-Communist societies to confront the widespread complicity of their nationals in the crimes of the Holocaust and to prosecute local Nazi collaborators. His public advocacy on these issues has been instrumental in the submission by Lithuania and Latvia of indictments (Lileikis, Gim≈æauskas, Dailidƒó) and/or extradition requests (Kalƒìjs, Gecas) against local Holocaust perpetrators. In 1993, Zuroff was appointed by the then Foreign Minister Shimon Peres to serve on the joint Israeli-Lithuanian commission of inquiry established to deal with pardons issued by the authorities of Lithuania, which had recently regained independence, to people suspected of Nazi war crimes, which has succeeded to date in achieving the cancellation by the Lithuanian authorities of approximately 200 rehabilitations granted to individuals who had participated in the murder of Jews during the Holocaust. In 2000 he claimed to have exposed the rehabilitations granted by the government of Latvia to alleged Nazi war criminals and has led the efforts to cancel these pardons. Zuroff played an important role in the exposure, arrest, extradition and prosecution of Dinko ≈†akiƒá, the former commandant of the Ustasha concentration camp Jasenovac. In early October 1999, ≈†akiƒá, who lived for more than 50 years in Argentina, was sentenced in Zagreb to 20 years‚Äô imprisonment (which was the maximum penalty under Croatian law at the time) for his crimes in the first-ever trial of a Nazi war criminal in a post-Communist country. Zuroff in Novi Sad on the 70th anniversary of the Novi Sad Raid. In his book Occupation: Nazi-Hunter; The Continuing Search for the Perpetrators of the Holocaust (KTAV; Hoboken, 1994), Zuroff chronicles the belated efforts to prosecute Nazi war criminals in western democracies and explains the rationale for such efforts several decades after the crimes. The book was published in German by Ahriman Verlag. Starting in June 1999, Zuroff's activities as a Nazi-hunter were the subject of five television documentaries. The first, entitled The Nazi-Hunter, was produced by ZDF (German Channel 2) in 1999; the second, entitled The Last Nazi-Hunter, was produced by SWR (German Channel 1-regional station) in 2004 and the third, The Final Hunt for the Nazis, by France 3 (Channel 3), was broadcast in December 2005.In 2009, the BBC produced \\"The Search for Dr. Death which followed Zuroff to South America in search of Dr. Aribert Heim, who committed horrendous crimes as a doctor at Mauthausen. In 2012, Israeli Channel 10 broadcast the documentary film, \\"Tzayad ha-Natzim ha-Acharon (The Last Nazi-Hunter). =Operation Last Chance= In 2002, together with Aryeh Rubin, the founder of the Targum Shlishi Foundation of Miami, Florida, Zuroff launched Operation Last Chance, which offers financial rewards for information which will facilitate the prosecution and punishment of Nazi war criminals. To date, the project has been initiated in Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia (all in 2002); Poland, Romania, Austria (2003); Croatia, Hungary (2004) and Germany (2005). On January 15, 2008, the prize was increased from $10,000 to $25,000. His second book on the hunt for Nazi war criminals, Chasseur de nazis (Paris: Michel-Lafon, 2008), written together with French journalist Alexandre Duyck, continues with the story of the renewed efforts spearheaded by Zuroff to hold Holocaust perpetrators accountable, especially in the wake of the breakup of the Soviet Union and the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe, and focuses on the results achieved by \\"Operation: Last Chance\\". That book was published in Serbian by the Zavod za udzbenike publishing company under the title Lovac na naciste in 2009 and in Polish by Wydawnictwo Dolnoslaskie under the title Lowca Nazistow in 2010. Zuroff almost completely rewrote the French book about Operation Last Chance in a volume published in English in 2009 by Palgrave Macmillan: Operation Last Chance: One Man's Quest to Bring Nazi Criminals to Justice. That book was published in German by Prospero Verlag in late 2011 under the title Operation Last Chance; Im Fadenkreuz des \\"Nazi Jaegers\\" and updated versions were published in 2012 in Serbian, Hungarian, and Finnish. In 2013, Propero Verlag published an updated German version. More recently, Romanian and Croatian versions of the book were published. In 2006, his exposure in Budapest of convicted but unpunished Hungarian gendarme war criminal Dr. S√°ndor K√©p√≠r√≥, who was said to be among the officers responsible for the mass murder of approximately 2,000 civilians in the city of Novi Sad, led to a criminal investigation against him, with his trial opening on May 5, 2011. A lawsuit by K√©p√≠r√≥ against Zuroff for libel, was denied. On July 18, 2011, the first-degree judgment declared S√°ndor K√©p√≠r√≥'s innocence, but the prosecution appealed against the sentence. Kepiro died in early September 2011, before the appeal was heard. Charles Zentai, who is accused of murdering an 18-year-old Jew, was located by Zuroff and the Hungarian government asked for his extradition from Australia to stand trial in Budapest. Magyar H√≠rlap - Megbukott a n√°civad√°sz}} Aribert Heim Zuroff, continued the hunt for the Nazi war criminal Aribert Heim after Simon Wiesenthal died in 2005. On July 6, 2008, Zuroff headed to South America as part of a public campaign to capture Heim. He elaborated on July 15, 2008 that he was sure Heim was alive and the groundwork had been laid to capture him within weeks. In fall 2009, his hunt for Aribert Heim, who committed war crimes in the Mauthausen concentration camp, was the subject of a BBC documentary entitled The Search for Dr. Death, and a fifth documentary Tzayad ha-Natzim ha-Acharon (The Last Nazi-Hunter), was broadcast on Israeli Channel 10 on Holocaust Memorial Day in 2012. Zuroff was lukewarm in his reaction to the reported death of Heim in Cairo in 1992. He observed in February 2009 that: Zuroff concedes, however, that Heim had undoubtedly lived in hiding in Egypt. Aribert Heim had reportedly killed \\"hundreds of inmates at the Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria by injecting gasoline into their hearts and performing surgery and severing organs without anaesthesia\\" notes Zuroff. In a 2011 interview he called Heim, \\"his biggest failure.\\" In the light of fresh revelations about the extent to which the CIA and West German intelligence co-operated with Nazi criminals after the war, Zuroff said he thought it quite possible that Heim worked for West German intelligence and that this may have been the reason that he was never prosecuted.Paterson, Tony (May 10, 2011). \\"Time is short in the last Nazi hunters quest for justice\\". The Independent. =Publications and other activities= Over the years Zuroff has published more than 450 articles on various topics relating to the Holocaust, as well as other issues of concern in the Jewish world. His publications have appeared in scholarly journals such as Yad Vashem Studies, Simon Wiesenthal Center Annual, Jewish Political Studies Review, and American Jewish History, as well as in the Los Angeles Times, Sueddeutsche Zeitung (Germany), die Tageszeitung (Germany), Profil (Austria), Boston Globe, Jerusalem Post, Tikkun, Jerusalem Report, Maariv, Haaretz, Yediot Achronot, The Jewish Chronicle, Eretz Acheret, and other publications. Zuroff has lectured extensively to audiences all over the world regarding the efforts to bring Nazi war criminals to justice. During the years 1992-1999, he served in the Education Corps of the Israeli Defense Forces (reserves) and lectured to thousands of soldiers about his work. In 1995 and 1996, Zuroff was invited to Rwanda to assist the local authorities in their efforts to bring to justice the perpetrators of the genocide which took place in that country in spring 1994, and he has served as an official advisor to the Rwandan government. On March 4th, 2020, Zuroff was invited to the Tennessee Holocaust Conference at The First Baptist Church in Greeneville, Tennessee, giving a lecture to approximately one-thousand children, educating them about the horrors of the holocaust and how he helped arrest Nazis that fled from their punishment after the war. Honors In recognition of his efforts as a Nazi-hunter and Holocaust scholar, Zuroff was nominated by Serbian President Boris Tadiƒá and the members of parliament of the Democratic Party of Serbia as a candidate for the 2008 Nobel Peace Prize. On January 22, 2009, he was granted the honorary citizenship of the Serbian city of Novi Sad, in appreciation for the exposure of S√°ndor K√©p√≠r√≥, who allegedly helped organize the murder of the city's Jews. On January 15, 2010, Zuroff was decorated with the Order of Duke Trpimir by Croatian President Stjepan Mesiƒá for special contributions against historical revisionism and for the reaffirming of antifascist foundations of the modern Republic of Croatia. On February 16, 2017, the President of Serbia Tomislav Nikoliƒá awarded the Gold Medal for Merit to Dr. Efraim ZuroffSerbian President Awards Efraim Zuroff Gold Medal for \\"exceptional achievements\\" and his \\"selfless dedication to defending the truth about the suffering of Jews, and also Serbs, Roma and other nations during World War II\\".Nazi hunter awarded gold medal by Serbian president Personal life He has four children and 14 grandchildren.

Early life Born in the Southern German city of Esslingen am Neckar, Mohr was the fourth child of lamb farmer August Ludwig Mohr (1795-1833) and Dorothea Catharina Friederica (n√©e Walker). The first three years of school, Mohr spent at the boys' school (paedegogium) of his home town. In 1833 the family moved to nearby Denkendorf where August Mohr founded a mustard and vinegar factory. Later that year, on September 10, August Mohr suddenly died at the age of 38. Early in life, Mohr worked in the family business. He developed an interest in botany through his great-uncle, a forester at the Denkendorf convent, and his uncle's son, a student at the agricultural college in Hohenheim. Through the self-study of several books on botany, Mohr furthered his knowledge in this area and developed a taste for natural science. Following his mother's wishes, he attended the Polytechincal school in Stuttgart in autumn of 1842. There he studied chemistry under Professor Hermann von Fehling and learned the plant world of the tropics in the greenhouses of the imperial court garden where his childhood friend, Wilhelm Hochstetter, was an apprentice. After finishing his studies, Karl was invited on a trip to Surinam by the explorer August Kappler. In November 1845 the two departed from the port on the island of Texel aboard the ship \\"Natalie.\\" After a dangerous voyage, they reached New Guinea in mid-March 1846. From Paramaribo they went into the interior of the country, where Mohr collected plants for European florists and herbariums. Severe fever attacks struck Mohr and tied him to a sick bed for several months, so he felt compelled to follow the advice of the doctors and returned home in November 1846. Back home, the botanist Professor Hochstetter (father of Mohr's friend Wilheim) arranged a job for Mohr as chemist in his son's factory in Brno. In April 1847, Mohr assumed his new position, which he soon lost when the factory closed during the revolution of 1848. Mohr left Brno and traveled with his brother Paul Heinrich, who had been living in London for some time. They met in August 1848 and decided to immigrate to the United States. In the United States The brothers reached New York City by ship and went to Cincinnati where Mohr worked for a while in a German chemical company. On 3 March 1849, hit with gold fever, he set out with a group of 50 men for the gold mines of California, where they searched for gold on the slopes of the Sierra Nevada (US) in the Yuba Valley. The strenuous work of a gold miner and the continuous standing in cold water worsened his health. So, in December 1850, he traveled back to Cincinnati. On this trip, he met Duke Paul Wilhelm of W√ºrttemberg, who was returning from an expedition. After Mohr worked for a short time as a farmer in Indiana, he moved to Louisville and married a countrywoman from Zweibr√ºcken, Sofie Roemer, on 12 March 1852. In Louisville he again met several friends from W√ºrttemberg and made contact with several German pharmacists. Here Mohr again found more time for his botanical studies, which were supported by the Swiss paleobotanist and bryologist Leo Lesquereux. For health reasons, Mohr decided in 1857 to go south of the United States and worked as a pharmacist in Vera Cruz and Orizaba, Mexico. He wanted to become independent, but the Mexican Revolution forced him to return again the United States. Back in the United States At the end of 1857, he opened the first German pharmacy in Mobile, Alabama whose business development was hurt by the outbreak of the American Civil War. The confederate government tasked him with examining the medicines for their army. During the course of the war, his pharmacy was destroyed once, but he immediately built it up again. Despite these troubled times, Mohr continued his botanical work and contributed a collection of mosses from southern Alabama to Lesquereux's 1884 work Mosses of North America. In his pharmacy laboratory, Mohr began examination of fertilizers and minerals, as well as exploring the woods of Alabama for commercial timbers and other valuable natural resources. The results of this work was publicized in 1879 under the title \\"The Forests of Alabama and Their Products\\". On behalf of the Department of Agriculture in Washington, D.C., who took notice of Mohr's work, he undertook a wide-reaching forest-botanical study. Aside from this, he was busy working for Harvard University and other institutions, giving talks at large congresses and conducting a topographical examinations of north Florida in 1882. All this work demanded so much from him that his now-grown son had completely taken over the pharmacy since Mohr's health had been overstrained by his exploration work. He was given an honorary doctoral degree by the University of Alabama in 1893 in recognition of his work. In 1900, he moved to Asheville, North Carolina, where he worked on the large Biltmore Herbarium while compiling his beloved \\"Economic Botany of Alabama\\", about weeds, medicinal-, poisonous- and commercial-plants. He died on July 17, 1901. Mohr wrote many articles and botanical works which appeared in the German-language Pharmaceutische Rundschau in New York. Legacy His publication Plant Life of Alabama, which took over 40 years, was at the same time his most meaningful work. It appeared in Montgomery two weeks after his death, and is significant for the economic development of the southern states. On the occasion of the 100-year anniversary of the geology department of the University of Alabama in 1948, Charles Theodore Mohr's life and work were recognized along with other predominant explorers, as he was a pioneer in his field of expertise for America.

Simonds, was an American landscape designer. He preferred the term 'landscape gardener' to that of 'landscape architect'. A number of Simonds' works are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Early life and education Simonds was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan on November 11, 1855 where he developed a love of nature through his explorations of its woods. From 1874-1878 studied civil engineering at the University of Michigan and, briefly, architecture with William Le Baron Jenney. Career In 1878, Simonds joined Jenney's architectural practice in Chicago. His first project was Graceland Cemetery where he learned naturalistic English-style landscape design. Through Jenney's tutaledge, he learned how to use native plants in landscape design, an unusual practice at the time. He studied local woods, hydrology, and topography leading him to be credited with the creation of the Prairie Style along with Jens Jensen, and Walter Burley Griffin. In 1880, Graceland was increasingly deferring to Simonds about the amount of work and money required to develop the property's eastern section before Jenney which led to ending Jenney's involvement in the project. This led to Simonds establishing the firm of Holabird & Simonds to carry out the work. In 1881, Martin Roche, who had also worked in Jenney's office, joined them as a third partner. In 1883, Simonds left the firm to concentrate solely to become the superintendent at Graceland. His work at Graceland led him to be called the \\"dean of cemetery design.\\" In 1897, he left his position at Graceland but continued to be their landscape consultant for the rest of his career. In 1900, the cemetery was awarded a silver medal at the Exposition Universelle in Paris for its landscape and later a Medal of Honor by the Architectural League of New York in 1925. In 1888, Ossian Cole Simonds' first project after Graceland was to create a site plan for Fort Sheridan which was to include a parade ground for drills. Simonds used a natural ravine to boarder the meadow created for the purpose. A scenic drive was incorporated into the plan which showcased natural vistas and brick and stone officers' housing. The effect of the plan was lauded as picturesque and charming. In 1899, he was a founding member of the American Society of Landscape Architects, and served as its president in 1913. In 1903, Simonds formed Simonds and Company and was awarded the redesign and extension of Chicago's Lincoln Park with Bryan Lathrop and Francis T. Simmons. The plan was to double the parks 275 acres by extending it into Lake Michigan and later extended it north approximately 1,000 acres. To update the older sections, he incorporated winding pathways and facilities so as not to compromise the landscape. He relied on natural topography to create naturalistic \\"rooms\\" and scenic meadow vistas. He also designed golf courses, Belle Meade, city parks, town plans, universities including Iowa State and the University of Maryland, residences, and private estates around the country. In 1920, Simonds authored Landscape Gardening. In the book, he lays out his approach to landscape design which looks to nature to inform the design. This included the use of native plants, the use of greenways, and warning of urban sprawl. He also founded the Chair of Landscape Design at the University of Michigan (U of M). In 1929, he was honored with a master's of arts from U of M. Simonds died November 20, 1931 after an extended illness in Chicago.

It lies about ten miles north by north-east of York. History The village is mentioned twice in the Domesday Book as Hotun in the Bulford hundred. Before the Norman invasion the manor was split between several land owners. Those named included Ligulf, Northmann, Thorkil, Thorsten and Thorulf. Afterwards some of the land was retained by the Crown and others given to Count Robert of Mortain who installed Sir Nigel Fossard as lord of the manor. Soon after this, the land was in the possession of the Bulmer family. Bertram de Bulmer built the first castle in the village during the reign of King Stephen. After the civil war between Stephen and Matilda, the castle and manor were seized by the Crown before being held for the king by the Mauley family. The manor eventually came into the possession of the Nevill family in the 14th century until 1480, when they were surrendered to the Crown. Various grants of land were made up to the 17th century when possession is recorded as belonging to Sir Thomas Ingram. The Ingram family, by way of various marriages, maintained lordship until 1904, when it passed to Hon. Edward Frederick Lindley Wood. =Topynomy= The name is derived from the Old English words hoh and tun, together meaning settlement on a projecting piece of land. The prefix of Sheriff is thought to arise because it was once held by Bertram de Bulmer, the Sheriff of York, who died in 1166. =Castles= Sheriff Hutton Castle In 1140, during the reign of King Stephen, a motte-and- bailey castle was built here in the Forest of Galtres by Bertram de Bulmer, the remains of which can be seen to the south of the churchyard. Those remains have been designated Ancient Monument status. The extant remains of the stone Castle at the western end of the village were built by John, Lord Neville in the late fourteenth century. It fell into disrepair during the reign of King James I. It is a Grade II Listed Building. The Neville Castle was used by Richard III to house his nephew Edward, Earl of Warwick and his niece, Elizabeth of York. Governance The village lies within the Thirsk and Malton (UK Parliament) constituency. The village gives its name to the District ward of Ryedale District Council. It also gives it name to the Hovingham and Sheriff Hutton electoral division of North Yorkshire County Council in which it sits. The local Parish Council is made of six members. An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward stretches south east to Flaxton with a total population taken at the 2011 Census of 1,729. Geography The nearest settlements are West Lilling to the south, Thornton- le-Clay to the south east and Farlington to the north east. The 2001 UK Census recorded the population as 1,038, of which 842 were over the age of sixteen years. There were 448 dwellings, of which 239 were detached. The population at the 2011 Census was 1019. Amenities =Economy= There are a diverse range of small to medium size businesses in and around the village from traditional building and contracting to small IT firms. There are also two public houses. The village is served by the York to Malton bus route via Castle Howard. =Sports= The Village Hall provides facilities for Badminton as well as other multi-function events. There is a Tennis Club with two hard courts on North Garth Lane. The Bowls Club have a green and clubhouse next to the Cricket Ground. Sheriff Hutton Cricket Club have their pavilion and clubhouse next to the Village Hall grounds. Religion St Helen and the Holy Cross, Sheriff Hutton The parish Church is dedicated to St Helen and Holy Cross and was built in the early 12th century. It is a Grade I Listed Building. The chancel was added in the 13th century and there were other rebuilding work carried out in both 14th and 15th centuries. An alabaster cenotaph with an effigy of a child was long regarded to depict Edward of Middleham, son of Richard III and Anne Neville, but is now thought to be an earlier work and depicts one of the Neville family. There is also a Methodist church in the village near the school. Wesleyan and Primitive Methodist chapels were built in the 19th century. Education There is a school in the village, Sheriff Hutton Primary School, and is within the catchment area of Easingwold School for secondary education. The village had a school attached to the early Wesleyan chapel which was built in 1855, but no longer in use. In 1873, the wife of the lord of the manor paid for the building of a National School in the village.

Early life and career Stewart was born in Sydney and died at Bathurst, New South Wales and was a descendant of a line of Bathurst landed gentry. He spent much of his childhood in Europe attended secondary school in Australia and enrolled The Leys School in Cambridge in 1930, at the age of 17, then attended Cambridge University the following year. His mother died in January 1932, leaving him ¬£7000. He visited Bagdad, Damascus, Aleppo and Baalbeck on his way to England in 1932. He married Eleanor Neal in England on 1 July 1935 and the two travelled Australia for a visit. James won a Wilkins Fellowship, which he used for them both to travel to the Near East with a short stay in Cyprus. They arrived in Istanbul in January 1936, and they spent time digging and collecting. War service and first marriage Jim volunteered to join the British army in May 1940 and requested to be posted in Cyprus. Prior to leaving England for a short trip to Australia with Eleanor he left ¬£300 for the publication of his work and bequeathed his massive personal library to the Cyprus Museum. He reported for duty at Haifa on 30 January 1941, but was captured by the end of the year and spent out the war as a German prisoner of war and after the war. After liberation by American troops he returned to England in April 1945. Move to Australia and marriage In 1947 Stewart made what was intended to be a two-week visit to Australia via Cyprus, but there met Dorothy Evelyn (Eve) Dray (born August 1914), who grew up in Cairo and shared his interest in Cyprus having made her first trip in 1926 then returned after completing her education in 1937. Stewart arranged for Eve to come to Australia as his ‚Äòtechnical assistant‚Äô. Academic career in Australia and second marriage Stewart obtained a position at the Sydney University, where he lectured in the History department, at the Nicholson Museum, becoming the first person to teach archaeology at an Australian university. He lobbied for the establishment of a Department of Archaeology, which was created in 1948. Stewart divorced Eleanor and married Eve in 1951, and they moved to Mount Pleasant at Bathurst, where he had his own laboratory and library. Stewart was appointed Professor of Near Eastern Studies in 1960 but died just 18 months into his tenure on 6 February 1962. Eve worked for nearly fifty years after his death to complete her husband's work.

Distribution, habitat and abundance Members of this family range from the intertidal zone to a depth of , but overall mostly and in the Southern Ocean mostly . The highest species richness is in the Southern Ocean south of the Antarctic Convergence, followed by deep parts of the Pacific Ocean, with only a few elsewhere, including the Magellanic region, Indian Ocean, Atlantic Ocean (both north and south) and Mediterranean Sea. In tropical and warm-temperate regions they only occur in deep, cold waters. The vast majority are generally slow-moving and benthic, but can move fast for short distance and a few species are pelagic or semi-pelagic. The family includes both species that are widespread and species with small ranges (typically restricted to an island, seamount or ridge), and very common species and rare species. Their abundance is often directly related to the epifauna abundance: Where the epifauna is rich and diverse, so are Epimeriidae. A few species have been kept, bred and studied in cold-water () aquariums by scientists. Appearance and behavior They are relatively large amphipods, with adults of the various species ranging from in head-and-body length. They are typically white, yellowish, orange, pinkish, red or purplish, and some have quite striking colour patterns. Some have a spiny crest along their mid-back and spines on their sides, which may serve as a protection against fish or serve as a \\"disruptive shape\\" (similar to disruptive colouration) that camouflages the amphipod. Most species are predators or scavengers that feed on bethic invertebrates (such as small crustaceans, brittle stars, sea cucumbers, sponges, cnidarians and polychaetes), or suspension feeders that take plankton (such as diatoms, radiolarians and foraminifers). Some are opportunistic feeders that will take a wide range of prey-types, while other species are specialists on one or a few prey types, like hydroids. Epimeria parasitica is a parasite on sea cucumbers. The newly hatched young resemble miniature versions of the adults (there is no larvae stage). They may climb onto their mother and stay with her for a period, but in other species they leave immediately. Taxonomy and genera Two genera are placed in this family by the World Register of Marine Species. A few others were formerly included, but are now regarded as subgenera (not full genera) or placed in other families (Actinacanthus in family Acanthonotozomellidae and Paramphithoe in family Paramphithoidae). *Epimeria Costa, 1851 *Uschakoviella Gurjanova, 1955 With more than 80 described species, Epmeria is by far the most diverse genus in the family, has been the target of several studies and is considered among the most iconic taxa in Southern Ocean. Nevertheless, many aspects of their life is poorly known, several new species have been described in the last decade and it is likely that undescribed species remain. There is only a single species in the genus Uschakoviella.

The electoral roll has a population of around 400 measured at 519 in the 2011 census.  History  The village appears in the Domesday Book as Rascill and its derivation is believed to be Ra (Roe Deer) and Skelf (Shelf). This implies that at the time, Roe Deer were present on the shelf of land where Raskelf now stands. The village was originally in the Wapentake of Bulmer and is now in the Hambleton District of North Yorkshire. The village itself is split into two, 'The Green' and the main village which are about 400 yards apart. It is situated just off the A19, 2.5 miles (4 km) north west of Easingwold, 15 miles (24 km) north of York and 9 miles (15 km) south of Thirsk. It can be reached by either travelling from Easingwold, turning left at the roundabout at the top of Long Street, along Raskelf Road, or directly from the A19 (just after the Easingwold bypass travelling north), or from Helperby which connects Raskelf to the Boroughbridge/Harrogate areas of North Yorkshire. St Mary's, a 12th-century church is notable for being the only church in Yorkshire to have a wooden tower. The church is in the Parish of Easingwold with Raskelf in the Diocese of York. In 1623, Ralph Reynard and Mark Dun, were accused and convicted of the murder of a yeoman by the name of Fletcher. Along with Fletcher's wife, they were executed.  Transport  Buses provide a Mondays only working from Raskelf to Boroughbridge and back. Service 29 goes to York 6 times daily with only 4 return workings. Most of these services start in Easingwold. Bus 30X runs from Thirsk to York via Raskelf seven times daily Mondays to Saturdays. There are no buses through Raskelf on Sundays.  Railway Station  Raskelf railway station was ¬Ω mile (0.8 km) to the west of the village itself. It was opened in 1841 by the Great North of England Railway, which was in itself a line built by the North Eastern Railway to connect York with Newcastle. The station was closed to passengers in 1958 and closed completely in 1964. It was the last station on the East Coast Main Line before the north and south to east junction with the Thirsk and Malton Line. The line is still open today and the site of the station is where Hag Lane crosses over the railway. Raskelf station was 13 miles and 28 chains (22 km) north of York and 8 miles and 51 chains (14 km) south of Thirsk.

Caplan Limited) was a department store in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Caplan's began as a small dry goods shop in 1897, and operated over time at various locations throughout Ottawa. In 1916, the store moved to Rideau Street, where it grew into a department store and went on to become a retail landmark in the city. Sam Caplan, born in 1898, ran the store for many years, and became a noted figure in Ottawa's business and Jewish communities. Along with Ogilvy's, Freimans and Murphy-Gamble, Caplan's was one of the local department stores that dominated Ottawa retailing for much of the twentieth century. In fact, Ottawa was unique among larger Canadian cities, as its local department stores were sufficiently successful to discourage the expansion of most national chains (including Eaton's, the Bay, and Simpson's) into the city until the 1950s. In 1967, Caplan's acquired Shaffer's Limited, a neighbouring clothing store on Rideau Street, and another longtime Ottawa retailer. The acquisition allowed for the further expansion of Caplan's premises and its customer base. However, retailing trends over the subsequent decade and a half did not favour independent department stores such as Caplan's. The construction of the Rideau Centre across the street from the Caplan's store further reduced sales, and Caplan's closed on July 28, 1984 after more than 80 years in business. Sam Caplan had died one year earlier, and did not witness the closing of his eponymous store. After the closure of the store, 1960s-era building extensions and design features were removed to reveal turn-of-the- century commercial fa√ßades that had been largely preserved. Shopping centre and office uses were proposed for the Caplan's site, but never reached the construction stage. In 2000, Ottawa City Council approved the construction of a cinema on the site, but that project also did not proceed. The city resisted subsequent efforts by the landowner to demolish the old Caplan's store fa√ßade, although neglect eventually lead to the fire marshall ordering its demolition in November 2003. As the site was located in a heritage conservation district protected under the Ontario Heritage Act, the city was able to secure the condition that a replica of the Rideau Street elevation be reconstructed as part of any future redevelopment on the site. The former Caplan's warehouse, built in 1920 on King Edward Street, was transformed in 1969 into an off-site theatre studio of the National Arts Centre. Today, it serves as \\"La Nouvelle Sc√®ne\\", a francophone theatre venue.

It lies on the A19 approximately halfway between Easingwold and Thirsk and about south east of the county town of Northallerton. History Thormanby is derived from the Old Norse personal name of Thormothr / √û√≥rm√≥√∞r (Tormod in modern Norwegian) and the suffix bi meaning \\"Thormothr's farm\\". The name Thormothr means \\"Thor's gift\\" (i.e. \\"mind\\" and \\"courage\\"). The village is mentioned twice in the Domesday Book of 1086 as \\"Tormozbi\\" in the Yarlestre Hundred. Before the Norman Conquest most of the land in the parish belonged to the manor of Earl Morcar, with a small areas owned by Arkil and Gamel. Following Domesday the manor passed to the Crown and, along with the smaller areas of land, was granted to Robert Malet. It eventually passed into the Nevill family, lords of the manors of Sheriff Hutton and Raskelf, who held it until the 15th century. It passed through several other families during the next 250 years until it came down to the Dawnay family in 1721. From that date it followed the descent of the manor of Sessay. Most of the land in the village was owned by the Viscounts Downe of Wykeham, but much of this was sold in 1918 with the disposing of the Sessay Estate. William Page in his A History of the County of York North Riding states: \\"According to tradition there was once a castle here. It is also said that in the rebellion of the Earl of Northumberland in 1569, the royal forces encamped on Thormanby Carr on their way to Maiden Bower near Topcliffe.\\" In 1870‚Äì72, John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales described Thormanby as: > a parish in Easingwold district, N. R. Yorkshire; 1¬æ mile SW of Husthwaite > Gate railway station, and 4¬º NNW of Easingwold. It has a post-office under > Easingwold. Acres, 958. Real property, ¬£1,042. Pop., 147. Houses, 24. The > living is a rectory in the diocese of York. Value, ¬£216.* Patron, > alternately Viscount Downe and Sir G. Cayley, Bart. The church is good. > Charities, ¬£6. There were three inns throughout the 17th century and 18th century, but only the Black Bull Inn public house remained until recent years. In 1999 the landlord of the Black Bull, Robert Medd, intended to close the pub, saying \\"the pub is sometimes more like a morgue,\\" and \\"sells just 16 pints a day.\\" Residents opposed his application to convert the pub through a belief that the village needed a \\"focal point\\". Governance The village lies within the Thirsk and Malton UK Parliament constituency. It is also within the Easingwold electoral division of North Yorkshire County Council and the Helperby ward of Hambleton District Council. Geography The parish contains , of which 454 are arable land and 383 grass. The nearest settlements are the hamlet of Birdforth to the north and the villages of Carlton Husthwaite, Hutton Sessay and Husthwaite, which are all within a radius of . The village lies at and elevation between and and is the highest point within the parish. The nearest major city is York, to the south-east. The Thirsk and Malton branch of the North Eastern Railway passes through the parish, but there is no station here. =Topography= The surface elevation is relatively consistent, varying in height from only to above the Ordnance Survey data. In the south there is an area of low-lying carr (landform) ‚Äì Sun Beck, Birdforth Beck and Ings Beck, which are part of the tributary system of the River Swale, drain the land and separate Thormanby from Sessay, Birdforth and Carlton Husthwaite respectively. Demography The first United Kingdom Census in 1801 recorded the population as 131. The highest recorded population in UK census returns was in 1852 when there were 154 people. By the time of the 1961 UK census, the population had fallen to 87. The 2001 UK census recorded the population as 112 of which 52.7% were male and 47.3% were female. Of those, 88.4% stated their religion as Christian, with the rest not stating a religion. The ethnicity of the parish was virtually 100% white British. There were 44 dwellings in the Parish. The 2011 UK census recorded the population as 138, an increase of 39.4% on the previous figures, of which 51.4% were male and 48.6% were female. Of those, 70.3% stated their religion as Christian, with the rest not stating a religion. The ethnicity of the Parish was virtually 100% white British. =Occupation history= The stacked column chart represents a simplified version of the 1881 occupational data, using the 24 'Orders' used in the published reports for 1881, plus an 'Unknown' category. Many of these categories combine 'Workers and Dealers' in different commodities, so it is impossible to distinguish workers in manufacturing and services. The graph shows that women had no significant occupation apart from domestic service, showing at approximately 31.5% of females. The most common occupation for males in the parish was agriculture, with approximately 74.2% of males being employed in this sector. Landmarks St Mary Magdalene Church, Thormanby The village church is dedicated to St Mary Magdalene and is a Grade II* listed building. It was built in the 12th century and has been subject to frequent changes up to 1955. The church stands a short distance east of the village on Church Lane. The village rectory is just south-west from the church. The Old Rectory is a Grade II Listed 18th-century Georgian residence, built in 1737 with a later addition of a schoolroom in 1786, and further alterations in 1837. It is now a bed and breakfast. Near the Rectory is a small redundant Wesleyan chapel, built in 1875, which has now been converted into a private house. West of the village, on Birdforth Beck, is Thormanby Mill. A red-brick 19th-century barn at Thormanby Mill is Grade II listed. At the north of the village, on the A19 near Birdforth Bridge, stands a Grade II-listed late 19th- century triangular cast iron mile post. Notable people Thomas Whytehead (1815‚Äì1843), was a Thormanby-born missionary and poet. He was the fourth son of Henry Robert Whytehead, curate of Thormanby. Harry Pasley Higginson (1838-1900) was born in Thormanby. He was the son of Revd John (1811‚Äì1895) and Mary Maria Hester Higginson (1815‚Äì1893). Higginson, who trained in Manchester, was involved in the discovery of dodo bones on Mauritius in 1865. He eventually settled in New Zealand where he became a prominent railway engineer and is commemorated in stained glass at the Wellington Cathedral of St. Paul, Wellington, New Zealand.

Cal Poly prevailed 70-69. On Oct. 11, 1962, Cal Poly hosted a preseason exhibition in Mott Athletics Center between the Los Angeles Lakers and San Francisco Warriors, the clubs' only exhibition to be played in-state that year. The Lakers, led by Jerry West and Elgin Baylor, defeated fellow Pro Basketball Hall of Fame member Wilt Chamberlain and his Warriors, 110-96. It was actually the Lakers' second preseason contest in Mott, as on Oct. 2, 1961, the Boston Celtics, led by Hall of Famers Bill Russell and Sam Jones, earned a 121-116 win before a near-capacity crowd. Jones scored a team-high 26 points in the win, while Russell added 21. (West scored 31 points in defeat, while Baylor added 25.) The facility underwent major renovations in 1998 by local construction firm Santa Margarita Construction Corp. The seating was completely redone and arena-style chair-backs were added to Mott Athletics Center in addition to upgraded heating and ventilation systems. Mott Athletics Center also contains the Cal Poly Mustangs trophy case, as well as the Mustang Hall of Fame. For the Cal Poly student-athletes, men's and women's locker rooms were renovated in 1999 and the athletics center also houses the Mustang Strength Complex, the Cal Poly Athletics Academic Resource Center, and offices for Cal Poly coaches. Named after Robert A. Mott (a physical education faculty member and department head from 1946-78), Mott Athletics Center hosted the 2005 Pac-10 Wrestling Championships, with the total attendance for the two-day event reaching 7,738. The Mustangs finished the meet in fourth place and crowned one individual champion, Vic Moreno at . In 1997, it marked the second time in three years an NBA team held its preseason camp at Mott Athletics Center. In 1995, the athletics center was the site of the 1995-96 Golden State Warriors training camp. Chris Mullin, Latrell Sprewell, B.J. Armstrong and No. 1 overall draft pick Joe Smith put on a show during an open practice to the public drawing a standing-room-only crowd of over 4,000. In 1997, the Sacramento Kings conducted their one-week camp at Cal Poly. Like the Warriors, the Kings opened doors to the public for an intrasquad scrimmage to conclude camp. Mott Athletics Center has been home to numerous NCAA playoffs (most recently in 2006, the first and the second rounds of NCAA Volleyball Tournament to sold-out crowds) and championships over the years, as well as hosting various concerts, exhibitions and sporting events. Names like Eddie Money, The Pretenders, The Doors, Ike and Tina Turner and Bill Cosby are a few of the names that have performed at Mott. In 1980, the men's basketball team hosted New Hampshire College (now Southern New Hampshire University) in a Division II NCAA Tournament Quarterfinal. During the 1998-99 season, it marked the first nationally televised game at Mott Athletics Center as ESPN2 carried a game between Cal Poly and Idaho. Several games have been broadcast live on Fox Sports West and ESPNU before capacity crowds. Mott Athletics Center underwent a comprehensive renovation in the summer of 2014, including a repainted court design, two new video boards and the implementation of new LED courtside rows.

The Matadome was renovated in 2014. With the renovation, the Matadome now has a capacity of 2,500. History and renovations The Matadome, unlike many other traditional stadia, is located within Redwood Hall, which hosts many kinesiology classes for Cal State Northridge. Contrary to the name, Redwood Hall, and by default the Matadome, is not a dome at all - the roof is flat. The Matadome was completed in 1962 and was officially opened on 30 November of the same year. The capacity of the Matadome has changed throughout the years. Before the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the Matadome had a capacity of over 3,000. The record attendance was 3,106 for a United States men's national volleyball team exhibition against Japan men's national volleyball team set on 2 November 1990, which was prior to the earthquake. After the earthquake, the upper section seats were removed to create more classroom space for Redwood Hall, and walls were put up to separate the Matadome from these new classrooms. Other renovations include the installation of a completely new floor in 1996 (with a redesigning in 2001), a drop-down scoreboard above half court in 1997, and chair-backed bleacher seats in 1998.

Most citizens are trilingual, speaking French and German in addition to the Germanic national language of Luxembourgish. Although its contributions to the arts are not largely known outside its borders, Luxembourg has a rich cultural history, especially in music, painting and photography. Its evolving museums, concert halls, theatres and galleries testify to its citizens' growing appreciation of culture. Arts =Painting= Rugby (1928) Jean-Baptiste Fresez and Nicolas Liez who both painted the City of Luxembourg and its surroundings were the country's most important 19th-century artists. Jean Jacoby, who was awarded two Olympic gold medals for his artwork and, above all, Joseph Kutter with his Expressionist landscapes and portraits, were notable during the first half of the 20th century. Kutter's brightly coloured painting of \\"Luxembourg\\", commissioned for the 1937 World Exposition in Paris reveals his mature Expressionist style, of which there is more than natural emphasis on how the houses appear to be stacked up one behind the other, how the buildings take on almost cubic contours and how the fortifications tower powerfully above the valley.Georgette Bisdorff, \\"Joseph Kutter\\" , Ons stad, No 73, 2003, p. 36.

Charles Bernhoeft (1859-1933) was a successful portrait and landscape photographer, publishing a number of luxurious albums, illustrated maps and several series of postcards. Contemporary photographers include the photojournalists Patrick Galbats, Yvon Lambert and Thierry Frisch. =Literature and poetry= Little is known of Luxembourg literature beyond the country's borders, partly because three languages are used, partly because many works assume a local readership. Furthermore, it was not until the 19th century that the literature of Luxembourg began to develop.Georges Hausemer, \\"About...

The architecture of Luxembourg extends back to the Treveri, a Celtic tribe that prospered in the 1st century BC. A few ruins remain from the Roman occupation but the most significant contributions over the centuries have been the country's castles and churches. Notable examples are the Vianden Castle and the Echternach Basilica. Today there is a veritable architectural boom as Luxembourg's economic prosperity provides a basis for developments in the financial, EU and cultural sectors with a number of world-class buildings. These include the Philharmonie Concert Hall, the Museum of Modern Art and the new European Investment Bank building.

Some 340 societies with over 17,000 individual members are currently represented by the organization.\\"Union Grand-Duc Adolphe\\", Luxemburger Lexikon, Editions Guy Binsfeld, Luxembourg, 2006. The two main venues for classical music in Luxembourg are the Philharmonie concert hall, home to the Philharmonie de Luxembourg orchestra, and the Grand Th√©√¢tre de Luxembourg with frequent performances of opera and ballet. Luxembourg's internationally recognized soloists include violinist Sandrine Cantoreggi, cellist Fran√ßoise Groben, pianists Francesco Tristano Schlim√© and Jean Muller, and singer Mariette Kemmer. Among its contemporary composers are Camille Kerger, Claude Lenners, Georges Lentz (although he lives mainly in Australia), Alexander Mullenbach and Marcel Wengler. Opera is frequently performed in Luxembourg City at the Grand Th√©√¢tre and in Esch-sur-Alzette at the Th√©√¢tre d'Esch as well as at the annual Wiltz festival. Brian Molko, singer/guitarist of rock band Placebo lived in Luxembourg for most of his life, where he learned to play various instruments such as guitar, piano and saxophone. Bassist Stefan Olsdal also lived there, the two of them met at school in Luxembourg but lost touch until they met again years later in London. One of the most influential Luxembourg bands of the last decades is Cool Feet, which performs old Luxembourgish songs. Luxembourg was a founding member of the Eurovision Song Contest and participated every year between 1956 and 1993, with the exception of 1959, although only eight of its 38 entries were performed by Luxembourgish artists. It won the competition five times (1961, 1965, 1972, 1973 and 1983), and hosted the contest four times (1962, 1966, 1973, and 1984). =Cinema= Cultural institutions Luxembourg City History Museum =Museums= The major museums are: * National Museum of History and Art (MNHA) * National Museum of Natural History (NMHN) * Luxembourg City History Museum * Museum of Modern Art Grand-Duc Jean (MUDAM) =Galleries= * Casino Luxembourg, forum for contemporary art in Luxembourg City * Villa Vauban, art museum Cuisine Judd mat Gaardebounen, served with boiled potatoes and Diekirch beer =Food= Luxembourg's cuisine has been influenced over the years by neighboring France, Germany, and Belgium. More recently, it has had influence from its many Italian and Portuguese immigrants. Luxembourg has many delicacies including its pastries, cheese, and fresh fish (brown trout, pike, and crayfish). Other delicacies include the Ardennes ham smoked in saltpeter, game during hunting season (such as hare and wild boar), small plum tarts in September (Quetsch), smoked neck of pork with broad beans (Judd mat Gaardebounen), fried small river fish (such as bream, chub, gudgeon, roach, and rudd), liver dumplings (Quenelle) with sauerkraut and boiled potatoes, black pudding (Tr√§ipen), sausages with mashed potatoes and horseradish, and green bean soup (Bouneschlupp). French cuisine is prominent on many menus, and to a lesser extent so are German and Belgian cuisines. =Alcohol= A number of white and sparkling wines are produced in Luxembourg, on the north bank of the Moselle, which has a winemaking history dating back to the Romans. Luxembourg is known for making several different kinds of wine including Riesling, Pinot gris, Pinot noir, Pinot blanc, Auxerrois, Rivaner, Elbling, Gew√ºrztraminer, and Cr√©mant de Luxembourg. Authentic Luxembourg wine can be identified by the National Mark. Luxembourg has a fair number of breweries, given its tiny size. Imported beer, however, is increasingly gaining control of the beer market in Luxembourg. During the 1970s and 1980s, over 600,000 hectoliters (almost 16 million US gallons) of beer were brewed each year. The peak was reached in 1976 when over 800,000 hectoliters of beer were brewed, and since then the amount has been decreasing. In 2001, production dropped below 400,000 hectoliters for the first time since 1950. Some beers are currently made in Luxembourg, including Battin Edelpils, the outstanding Battin Extra, Brasserie Battin, Bi√®re Blonde and others at the Restaurant Beierhaascht, Bofferding Lager, Brasserie Bofferding, H√©ngeschter, Cornelyshaff, Diekirch Premium, InBev-owned Brasserie de Luxembourg Mousel-Diekirch SA, Simon Dinkel and others at the Brasserie Simon. The Brasserie de Redang also brewed beer for five years, but closed in 2005. =Specialties= These are some specialties of Luxembourg: * Th√ºringer - Inexpensive, small sausages that taste like a spicy version of the German bratwurst. They are often sold by street vendors and at roadside stands. New regulations prohibit the use of the word \\"Th√ºringer\\" as it is now regionally protected and reserved to sausages produced in the German free state of Thuringia. They are now commonly referred to as \\"Grillwurscht\\" (L√´tzebuerger) or \\"Grillinger\\". * Bouneschlupp - A green bean soup. * Gromperekichelcher - A carefully spiced potato pancake with chopped onions and parsley, then deep- fried. They are available at roadside stands as well. * √âisleker Ham - Smoke- cured raw ham, said to look like the Italian Prosciutto crudo, sliced paper- thin and commonly served with fresh bread. * Kachk√©is (cooked cheese) - A soft cheese spread. * P√¢t√© - A spreadable paste, usually made of meat but vegetarian versions exist. * Quetschentaart - A plum tart; along with peach, cherry, and pear tarts, it is a typical dessert and can be found in any pastry shop or restaurant. Sports =Football= Football is the most popular sport in Luxembourg. Football in Luxembourg is governed by the Luxembourg Football Federation (FLF), which is a member of FIFA and UEFA. The FLF organises the men's, women's, and futsal national teams. The Luxembourg National Division is the premier domestic sports League in the country. Luxembourg was amongst the first countries in the world to be introduced to football, with the National Division being established in 1913, and the national team playing its first match in 1911. The game of football is the most popular sport in the whole country of Luxembourg (especially in the south), having developed earliest in the industrial Red Lands and Luxembourg City. Only once has the National Division been won by a team not from south of the country. Historically, Jeunesse Esch has been Luxembourg's most successful domestic club, having won the National Division on 27 occasions out of 93. Since 2000, the league has been dominated by F91 Dudelange, which has won the league on six of the past eight occasions. The national team, nicknamed D'Leiwen ('The Lions'), is one of the weakest in the world, not having ranked above 130th in the world since 2002. The team has only made one appearance at the European Championship in 1964, which the team achieved moderate success at the 1964 European Championship, when the side beat the Netherlands and almost progressed to the semi-finals. The most famous current Luxembourgian footballer is Jeff Strasser, who has made a successful career in the French and German Leagues. Luxembourg's most famous past players include Louis Pilot and Guy Hellers, both of whom also coached the national team after ending their playing careers. =Cricket= Traditional events The dancing procession of Echternach is a festival which takes place annually. Dancers process through the streets of Echternach. The procession was inscribed as the hopping procession of Echternach on the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2010.

Introduced in 1940, it was developed to provide accurate aiming information for antiaircraft artillery and was also used for gun laying systems and directing searchlights against aircraft. The radar was widely utilized by both Army and Marine Corps air defense and early warning units during World War II. By the end of World War II the system was already considered out of date, having been replaced by the much smaller and more accurate SCR-584 microwave-based system. Three soldiers of the United States Army operate a radar used by the 90th Coast Artillery (Antiaircraft, Semimobile, Colored) in Casablanca Development The Signal Corps had been experimenting with some radar concepts as early at the late 1920s, under the direction of Colonel William R. Blair, director of the Signal Corps Laboratories at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. While most of the Corps' efforts revolved around infra-red detection systems (a popular idea at the time), as well as a newer generation of sound detectors, they also maintained a small program of research on microwave radars based on the \\"beat principle\\", in which an aircraft would cause two signals to interfere. Low generator efficiency and a lack of ranging capability made these efforts impractical. In 1935 one of Blair's recent arrivals, Roger B. Colton, convinced him to send an engineer to investigate the US Navy's CXAM radar project. The navy's system traced its development from experiments conducted by Albert H. Taylor and Leo C. Young at the United States Naval Research Laboratory in the early 1920s. William D. Hershberger duly went to see what they had, and returned an extremely positive report. They decided to try to find a need for such a unit in order to gain funding, and eventually received a \\"request\\" by the Chief of Coast Artillery on February 1, 1936 for a gunlaying system with a range of 15,000 yards through rain, mist, smoke or fog. Gaining the support of James B. Allison, the Chief Signal Officer, they managed to gather a small amount of funding and \\"stole\\" some more from other projects. By December 1936 they had a working prototype, which they continued to work on and improve. On May 26, 1937 they were able to show the prototype in a convincing demonstration. After failing to find their target Martin B-10 bomber where it was supposed to be, they started \\"hunting\\" for it and found it 10 miles off course. The radar fed pointing data to a team operating a searchlight, and when it was turned on the bomber was seen to be centered in the beam. It was later learned that the target had been blown off course, making the demonstration all the more impressive. Development of this system was slowed to some degree when a long range early-warning radar became a higher priority and parts of the prototype were salvaged for the SCR-270 they were building. Nevertheless, the system entered production at Western Electric about the same time as the -270 in 1939. The radar entered service in 1940, and about 3100 were produced by the end of the war. Description Oscilloscope operators with range scope at left, azimuth scope in middle, and the elevation scope at right The SCR-268 antenna system consisted of a number of dipole elements arranged in three groups, each in front of a passive reflector, mounted on a large aimable cross. The cross consisted of a short upright pedestal sitting on top of a large base platform, mounting long cross-arms extending from the midpoint of the upright pedestal. The antenna system was about forty feet wide and ten feet high overall. Both the pedestal and the cross-arm could be rotated around their axis for aiming, in azimuth and altitude respectively. The left side of the cross arm, as seen from the back, contained a set of dipoles that were set to be sensitive in angle, while almost insensitive to elevation. It was arranged six dipoles wide and four dipoles high, each with its own reflector. On the far right side was a similar, but smaller, arrangement rotated 90 degrees in order to be sensitive in elevation and not angle. This portion was two dipoles wide and six dipoles high with corresponding reflectors. Finally in the \\"middle\\" of the cross, between the upright pedestal and the elevation antenna, was the broadcasting array which created a circular beam about 10 degrees wide. The three radar operators sat at consoles mounted on the pedestal just below the antenna cross-arm, each with their own oscilloscope display. One controlled the azimuth, another the elevation, and the third measured the range. Pointing the antenna was controlled by rotating large handwheels, the range being reported by a similar wheel. The accuracy of the antennas themselves was not very high, about 9-12 degrees, so simply rotating the antenna and looking for a maximum would not point it very accurately. To help with this the antennas were deliberately designed to have two directions of high sensitivity, or \\"lobes\\". Signals from both lobes were displayed, slightly separated, on the layer's displays. By adjusting the antenna until the returns from both were equally strong, accuracies of about one degree were possible. Range information was taken from the elevation array, and worked, as it did for most radars of the era, by triggering the trace on an \\"A-line\\" oscilloscope and read against a scale at the bottom. A second blip was also generated by equipment attached to the rangefinder's handwheel. By rotating the handwheel until the reference blip overlapped the one returned from the antenna, the timing could be read from the wheel. Range accuracy was about plus or minus 200 yards. The system also included two sets of \\"repeaters\\" that sent the directional information to a searchlight, and both the directional and range (as dialed in on the rangefinder's handwheel) to a gun. The accuracy was not enough for direct gunlaying, but in combination with a searchlight the gun's existing optical equipment could \\"fine tune\\" the radar's guidance. The radar operated at 205 MHz with a PRF of 4098 pulses per second of 6 ŒºS (microsecond) duration, with an inter-pulse time of 240 ŒºS. Radio waves (light) travel at about 0.093 miles/ŒºS round-trip, so the system had a maximum range (240 √ó 0.093). It broadcast about 75 kW of power, which was, in theory, more than enough to offer longer range. The radar was mobile, requiring four prime movers for support. Two towed the radar base and the antennas themselves, another pulled a K-34 trailer van providing power, and the fourth a van that converted the power to high voltage for the radio equipment. In total, including the trucks, the SCR-268 weighed 82,315 pounds. That the system was mobile at all was more a testament to the US's overwhelming industrial might than any quality of the radar itself. The SCR-268 was combined with the Sperry M-4 gun director to create automatic radar-controlled gun laying; however, the relatively long wavelength (1.5 meters) resulted in poor accuracy. This system was eclipsed by the SCR-584, which utilized a 3 GHz magnetron oscillator from Britain, completely automatic tracking, and the Bell Telephone Laboratories electronic M-9 gun director.Mindell, David A., \\"Automation's Finest Hour\\", IEEE Control Systems Magazine 15(6) The SCR-268 was one of the first radar sets to use lobe switching of its receiving antennas as a means to locate AA (anti-aircraft) searchlight beams on aircraft. Since it did not lobe-switch its transmitted signal it would be classed as one of the first LORO (lobe-on-receive-only) radars. Surviving examples There are no known surviving examples of this array.

It lies about three miles north-east of Easingwold. Remains of a Roman villa have been found in the area. The village is within the Howardian Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty History The village name may be derived from the Anglian personal name of Ulf combined with tun meaning habitation. There are the remains of a Roman villa nearby, consistent with the village's location near the junction of two old Roman roads. Articles from the site are located within the York Museum. The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book as Uluestan and at the time of the Norman invasion, the lands were owned by Gospatric, son Arnketil. Following the Norman invasion of Britain, the estates of Yearsley, Coxwold and Oulston fell into the hands of a Norman family whose previous seat of power had been in Montbray, Normandy. By 1158, however, these same lands had been given to another Norman lord whose family base had been Colleville on the Normandy coast. In return for receiving these lands, Thomas de Colville had to swear allegiance to Roger de Mowbray. Thomas de Colville‚Äôs estate included the manors of Yearsley, Coxwold and Oulston as well as other properties and land in York, Thirsk, Everley, Nunwick, Ripon, Kilburn and Upsland. The Colville shield is proudly displayed at one of the roof intersections in the twelfth century Norman church at Coxwold. A fourth Thomas Colville generously allowed John, the Prior of Newburgh, to live ‚Äúby suit of court‚Äù in his manor house at Oulston. In return for Thomas‚Äôs generosity, John (besides offering prayers) used his influence, in 1256, to arrange a special privilege for Thomas: Thomas would no longer be required, on behalf of the king, to carry out any legal or other administrative duties against his will.Yearsley: A Genealogical Story Part 1: The Early Years The lands were eventually passed to the Fauconberg family and thence to the Wombwell family, who resided at nearby Newburgh Priory Estate. There used to be a Wesleyan chapel in the village, which is now the village hall. It is a Grade II listed building. There are four sites in the area that are scheduled ancient monuments. They are: * a round barrow 500m WNW of Pond Head Farm at * a round barrow 350m NW of Pond Head Farm at * a section of cross ridge dyke and earthworks in Roman Plantation, Oulston Moor at * a section of cross ridge dyke and hollow way 200m NW of Pond Head Farm at Governance The village is part of the Thirsk and Malton UK Parliament constituency. It lies within the Stillington, North Yorkshire electoral division of North Yorkshire County Council. It also lies within the White Horse ward of Hambleton District Council.Ordnance Survey Open Viewer Geography According to the 1881 UK census, the population was 177. In the 2001 UK census the population was 102 of which 85 were over sixteen years old. Of those, 51 were in employment.

If considered as a folktale, the story is Aarne-Thompson type 565, the Magic Mill. It concerns Strega Nona (\\"Grandma Witch\\" in broken Italian) and her helper, Big Anthony. Big Anthony causes the title character's magic pasta pot to create so much pasta that it nearly floods and buries a town. The book, which is likely dePaola's best-known work, was published in 1975 and won a Caldecott Honor in 1976. It was one of the \\"Top 100 Picture Books\\" of all time in a 2012 poll by School Library Journal. Plot Set in Calabria, in southern Italy, the book focuses on the exploits of Strega Nona. She is a sort of witch doctor noted throughout her home village for her numerous successful remedies. She helps her fellow villagers with their troubles, most notably by curing headaches, helping single women find husbands, and ridding people of warts. Because she is getting old, Strega Nona employs the assistance of a young man named Big Anthony to do the household chores. Knowing that he pays little attention, Strega Nona informs Big Anthony of his duties carefully and clearly, adding only one restriction - never to touch her magic pasta pot. Big Anthony complies, but one night he secretly observes Strega Nona singing a spell to the magic pasta pot to produce large amounts of cooked pasta; the man is impressed, but unfortunately, he fails to notice that she blows kisses to the pot three times to stop the pasta production. Big Anthony tries to share his discovery with the townsfolk the next day, but he is laughed at and disbelieved. He vows to one day impress them by making the pasta pot cook by himself. He gets his chance two days later when Strega Nona leaves to visit her friend Strega Amelia and leaves the house in his care. The moment she is gone, Big Anthony gets out the pasta pot and successfully conjures up large amounts of pasta, which he then serves to the townsfolk. However, since Big Anthony cannot stop the pot from cooking, the pasta gradually covers Strega Nona's house and threatens to flood the entire town. Disaster is averted when Strega Nona returns and immediately blows the three kisses to stop the pot's cooking. The townsfolk want to kill Big Anthony, but Strega Nona intervenes, saying \\"the punishment must fit the crime,\\" and hands a fork to Big Anthony and commands him to eat all the pasta he has conjured. By nightfall, he is stuffed. Development Detail of title page of an early printing with incorrect \\"an old tale retold...\\" subtitle Although the cover and title page of early printings of the book stated that Strega Nona is \\"an old tale retold and illustrated by Tomie dePaola\\", in truth dePaola invented the character and the story himself. He wrote the words \\"Strega Nona\\" next to a doodle of a woman's head he drew in the early 1970s and later made her the main character in his story based on the Sweet Porridge fairy tale. Later printings of the book bear the accurate subtitle \\"an original tale written and illustrated by Tomie dePaola\\". In the Italian language, the word \\"strega\\" means \\"witch\\" and the word \\"nonna\\" means \\"grandmother\\". Just as \\"grandma\\" is a colloquial variation of \\"grandmother\\", \\"nona\\" is a colloquial variation of \\"nonna\\". Hence \\"Strega Nona\\" means \\"Grandma Witch\\". It is clear in the stories, mainly Strega Nona, Her Story, that Nona is the character's actual name. Other books Strega Nona and Big Anthony also appear in other books by dePaola, including: * Big Anthony and the Magic Ring (1979): Introduces Bambolona, \\"the baker's daughter.\\" * Strega Nona's Magic Lessons (1982): Big Anthony disguises himself as a girl and takes magic lessons from Strega Nona, who is also teaching Bambolona. * Merry Christmas, Strega Nona (1986): Strega Nona abandons her usual pursuits in order to prepare a Christmas dinner for the entire town. * Strega Nona Meets Her Match (1993): Her friend Strega Amelia sets up a modern cure shop which competes with Strega Nona's cure shop. * Strega Nona: Her Story (1996): Covers Strega Nona's life, telling the readers how she got the magic pasta pot and learned her magic (it all came from the help of her grandmother, Grandma Concetta). * Big Anthony, His Story (1998): Tells of his life since childhood and how his family noticed that Big Anthony simply does not pay attention. * Strega Nona Takes a Vacation (2000): Strega Nona goes on vacation and sends gifts of candy and bubble baths to Bambolona and Big Anthony. * Brava, Strega Nona!

It is named for the town of Ash Fork, and for Francis H. Bainbridge, a civil engineer and graduate of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), a member of the Rensselaer Society of Engineers, and an engineer for ATSF.According to material found in this PDF: Arizona Society of Civil Engineers 150th anniversary booklet, Bainbridge invented the steel dam and obtained a United States patent on it, No. 537,520, filed September 11, 1894 The dam has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1976. Background The ATSF and other railroads had to make special provisions for water supply in desert conditions, as non condensing steam locomotives The sort typically used in the United States, even in very arid conditions consumed a prodigious amount of water. The usual approach was to construct a dam to retain surface water, or to drill a series of wells, and store the water in a water tank. Railroad communities often grew up around these reservoirs or water stops. Ash Fork had been such a town from when the ATSF first arrived some years earlier although it had been a way point for stagecoach lines previously. Railroads in the U.S. and elsewhere had been leaders in structural development. The masonry arch bridges and viaducts of the early 19th century had given way to bridges made mostly of steel, with considerable economy of material, construction cost, and time, and Bainbridge speculated that similar savings might be possible for dams. This dam was a significant departure from the more typical masonry construction. Already familiar with the construction of the ATSF's many steel bridges, Bainbridge decided to see whether steel construction could replace masonry in dams as well. The dam's light weight and prefabricated components must have made assembly easy relative to the laborious job of quarrying and setting stone. Steel dams use relatively thin steel plates in contact with the water surface, with a framework of steel behind them transmitting the load to the ground. The plates are slanted upwards in the direction of water flow, so that the weight of the water puts compressive forces on the girders holding the plates up. This transmits force to the ground without the bending moment that a vertical wall of plates would engender. It was believed that these dams could be constructed faster and more cheaply than masonry dams. Location The dam lies about to the east of Ash Fork, in Johnson Canyon, and about west of Williams, Arizona. It is near the former U.S. Route 66 and Interstate 40. About a mile upstream lies Stone Dam, a masonry structure constructed 13 years later. The Grand Canyon Railway originates in Williams, branching from the ATSF main that this dam served, and runs northeast to the Grand Canyon. Construction details The dam was fabricated by the Wisconsin Bridge and Iron Company and shipped to the site in pieces for erection. Construction of the dam began in 1897 and was completed March 5, 1898, at a total cost of US$63,519 (equivalent to $ million today). The structure gets its scalloped appearance from 24 curved () steel plates that slope downstream. Loose and rigid plates are alternated to compensate for a temperature range from to . The central steel section is long, high, and weighs about . No spillway was provided; instead, the dam was designed to withstand overtopping of of water pouring directly over its crest. It holds about of water when full. History The dam is an Arizona Historic Civil Engineering Landmark. A professional journal wrote in 1902 that Ash Fork Dam \\"has so many novel features of an experimental character that it is specially interesting and instructive to the engineering profession.\\"cited in Holding Back the Waters - Dams as Water Resource Monuments by Joe Gelt In a survey in 1955, George LambLamb was a member of the American Institute of Steel Construction, and was cited in said \\"it appears to be in as good condition as if it was just built.\\" It is still in use, unlike the other two steel dams in the United States.Redridge Steel Dam stands empty although well preserved, and the Hauser Lake Dam in Montana failed within a year or so of construction The Kaibab National Forest (part of the United States Forest Service holdings) is now the owner of the dam, after acquiring it through a land exchange.http://ag.arizona.edu/AZWATER/arroyo/092dams.htm It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976 with a structure ID of #76000373.

It has a length of some 170m and runs from the Rue Guillaume Apollinaire to the Rue de l'Echaud√©. The street itself dates from 1800 although the land it runs over has a much longer history. Transportation The area is served by the following stations of the Paris M√©tro: * Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s (approx. 90 m from the westernmost end of the street) * Mabillon (approx. 100 m from the easternmost end of the street). History The Benedictine abbey was founded by Childebert, son of Clovis, in 543 to house relics brought from the siege of Saragossa the previous year. These included the tunic of Saint-Vincent and a cross of gold from Toledo; in consequence, the church and abbey were originally known as Saint-Vincent and Sainte-Croix. The church was founded somewhat later in 557 by Germain, Bishop of Paris, who was buried there in 576. A small market town grew up around the religious centre which became a place of pilgrimage and whose name changed to Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s (\\"of the meadows\\") in the 9th century. The Merovingian kings of France were also buried here ‚Äî the tombs all disappearing during the French Revolution. Around 1000 a new Romanesque church with three bell towers was built. Two of these were knocked down in 1821 due to their state of decomposition from the saltpetre in the gunpowder stored there during the French Revolution. The third bell tower still remains. Abbot's Palace (1586) Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s Abbey Church The abbot's palace (Palais Abbatial), commissioned by Charles de Bourbon in 1586, is still occupied (Nos 1-5). The abbot's garden also exists to this day and was the scene of one of the most sombre episodes of the French Revolution, the September Massacres of the 2nd to 5 September 1792. The street was built in 1800 by driving a way through the abbey grounds which had been taken over by the new Republic. The old refectory and part of the chapel were destroyed in the creation of the street which was initially known as rue de la Paix, became rue Neuve de l'Abbaye in 1809 and settled on its current name in 1815. As recently as 1951, that portion of the original street between Rue Bonaparte and Rue Saint-Beno√Æt was renamed Rue Guillaume Apollinaire after the poet Guillaume Apollinaire.

Its facade is a notable example of the Art Nouveau Guimard style, named from the architect Hector Guimard, which can also be seen in the 60 or so M√©tro entrances he designed. *The Square Laurent-Prache was opened to the public in 1901. It was created on that part of the ruins of the abbey where the house of Alphonse Daudet had stood. *A head of Dora Maar by Pablo Picasso, (started in 1918 and completed in 1941), as a memorial to his recently deceased friend Guillaume Apollinaire was installed in the Square Laurent-Prache on June 5, 1959 and has now been returned after a short sojourn in front of the Mairie d'Osny in the Val-de-Oise department.

It was founded as a television content production company on March 23, 1967 and found its broadcasts as an independent channel on July 10, 1998.Its main shareholder is Carlos Ardila L√ºlle. It produced Yo soy Betty, la fea, one of the most successful Colombian soap operas.  History  RCN Television was created as a television arm of the RCN Radio network. In 1967 RCN Radio took part in the bidding for spaces in the official television network, getting one hour a day which was split into two series: one made in Colombia named El Hogar (The Home) and the American television series Bewitched. In 1973 RCN Radio and its subsidiary RCN Television were purchased by Carlos Ardila L√ºlle, who three years later relaunched RCN as a television production company (or programadora) with several spaces into the official channels' schedule. RCN was the first company that broadcast a television program both live and in color, the 1980 Miss Colombia beauty contest; since that year RCN has held the rights to broadcast this event. = The 1980s = RCN produced television series with high remembrance among viewers like Cusumbo and El Taita in 1984, which was the first Colombian telenovela filmed in exterior locations. In August 1988, RCN became part of OTI Colombia, gaining the rights to broadcast the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup. Other members included Caracol, RTI, Producciones PUNCH, Producciones JES and Datos y Mensajes.\\"OTI plane√≥ bien su propio partido.\\" El Tiempo 18 July 1994:link = The 1990s = Along with Caracol TV and R.T.I. RCN became one of the major television production companies in Colombia, producing not only telenovelas, game shows, but also sports events and news. Nevertheless, the telenovelas gave to RCN an outstanding recognition, first in Latin America and in places as distant as Vietnam and Hungary. Among this productions were La Potra Zaina, Las Juanas and the international hit Caf√©, con aroma de mujer, which not only have been broadcast in several countries across the globe but have been remade several times, with Destilando Amor being the newest version. Within the telenovelas they produced in the 1990s, there were productions like La Otra Raya del Tigre, La Vor√°gine, La Casa de las dos Palmas, Azucar, Momposina and Hombres, all of them raising parts of the Colombian culture and showing it to the world. = Private Television Network = In 1995 the Colombian government opened up a bidding for two private television networks, each one operating with one channel. RCN took part of this bidding, getting one of the two licenses, the other went to Caracol TV. In 1997 RCN started construction on the infrastructure to launch the television channel. On 10 July 1998, RCN aired for the first time as a private channel. In this first stage, RCN launched two telenovelas -La Madre and Carolina Barrantes- and improved the news bulletins, nevertheless, in the first year, RCN -and Caracol- only had a fraction of the Colombian television audience, because the broadcasting infrastructure was not complete and the production companies which remained in the official channels launched a solid strategy to keep the viewers. In only the second semester of 1999 and the first one of 2000, RCN and Caracol got to beat the public channels, taking more of the 90 percent of the viewers. RCN's first hits were Francisco El Matem√°tico (\\"Francisco, the Math Teacher\\"), a teen-oriented series, which aired on Saturday nights, but thanks to its success was moved to prime time Mondays to Fridays, and El Fiscal (The Prosecutor), an action oriented series. Since the successes of Francisco El Matem√°tico and El Fiscal, RCN launched successful telenovelas which let it take the first place in the Colombian most watched networks: Me Llaman Lolita (\\"My Name is Lolita\\"), and Yo soy Betty, la Fea, that became the most successful telenovela ever in Colombia, topping Caf√© con aroma de mujer. Betty la fea has since had its format and storyline licensed by RCN to multiple broadcasters worldwide in several languages. Following the international trend, RCN launched in 2003 its first reality show: Protagonistas de Novela, which became the most watched show that year in Colombia, its second season, despite not getting as high ratings as the first season got, kept it in first place in the most watched shows in Colombia. Following Protagonistas de Novelas, RCN launched La Isla de los Famosos (a Colombian version of Survivor), which became the most watched show in RCN in 2004, and the second season named Una Aventura Pirata (A Pirate Adventure) got again the place of most watched show in Colombia. The RCN's telenovelas those years were perceived to be of only middling quality, not until with the launching of Los Reyes (a Colombian version of Argentinian series Los Rold√°n) and Fernando Gaitan's Hasta que la plata nos separe (Until the Money Divides Us) that a telenovela from RCN got high ratings to become the most watched show in Colombia. But despite those years the telenovelas did not put the network in the first place, the Colombian version of The X Factor did, becoming the number one show in Colombia in 2006, with two seasons, and a third and a fourth named Factor XS, where the competitors are kids instead of adults. RCN gained some criticism against the fact that the network was getting ratings from the use of kids in a reality show, but the parents of the kids dismissed this affirmation. RCN got a ratings hit with 2007 telenovelas Pura Sangre and La Hija del Mariachi, followed by the 2008 telenovelas, El √öltimo Matrimonio Feliz and Los Protegidos. In July 2008, RCN became the first TV network in Colombia to offer online domestic English-language news updates under the brand, \\"RCN News\\" and RCN News in English. The full news updates would air on RCN's international network, \\"TV Colombia\\" in the mornings. Near the end of 2010, \\"RCN News in English\\" was phased out and began to offer only English-language international news updates for RCN's sister network, \\"Nuestra Tele Noticias 24\\" under the brand \\"news.NTN24.com\\". Plans for the format change began to surface in July 2010 after the main producer Brian Andrews involuntarily left the country in May after doing a report in El Cerrito, Valle del Cauca. National press coverage followed the incident. By this time he had become nationally well-known not only for producing national English- language news updates but for having done voice-overs for on-air advertisements for RCN's coverage of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa as a lemur known as \\"Monocuco\\". He was known for saying \\"Monocuco, su avena y su pitillo, compadre\\" in broken Spanish. Teasers for the latest news update air during the midday \\"Noticias RCN\\" newscast during segment transitions. The teaser introduction is always in Spanish, while the teaser itself is in English. Even with the brand name and format changes, teasers continue to air during the \\"Noticias RCN\\" midday newscasts in an attempt to continue to compete in the Colombian TV market. Teasers however included \\"Noticias RCN\\" graphics but used a \\"news.NTN24.com\\" end card. Although \\"Nuestra Tele Noticias 24\\" is an international news channel, \\"news.NTN24.com\\" focuses more on headlines from the \\"Americas\\" with the motto of \\"Latin America‚Äôs News In English\\" Morning, afternoon and evening news updates were posted daily. News updates were recorded in Bogot√° and Miami with occasional updates from Berlin and New York City. Along with posting news updates on their website, \\"news.NTN24.com\\" relies heavily on their Facebook and Twitter pages to notify viewers on new updates. In February 2011, the brand name changed to \\"NTN24News.com\\" and the website layout changed to accommodate a larger video display showcasing the latest news update. As of late 2012, NTN24 News provides mostly news produced from wire services like Reuters and very little original reporting. Programming RCN presently operates on a 22-hour schedule of regular network programming, and its signal is the same throughout the country, with no regional variations in the schedule, which starts in the early morning (4:00 am) with reruns of previously aired telenovelas, the morning is covered with breakfast television (Muy Buenos D√≠as), with a break for news, and then religious programming (Cura Para el Alma), the news returns at 12:30 pm and the rest of the afternoon is taken by domestic and foreign telenovelas until 7:00 pm with the news bulletin, and at 8:00 pm the prime time starts with domestic telenovelas until 10:30 pm; the night schedule is occupied by news and editorial TV shows (i.e. La Noche).

He is best known for his emphasis on reclamation and conversion of former industrialized landscapes. Retired today, he was an adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and was also a visiting professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. Latz once noted in a foreword for the book Visionary Gardens by Ernst Cramer that the overall of landscape architecture could be applied in abstract rules. \\"The beauty of nature lies within the essence and effect of plants and materials.\\" Early life and education Peter Latz was born in Darmstadt and grew up in the Saarland as the son of Heinrich Latz, a German architect. After graduating from high-school he studied landscape architecture at the Technical University in Munich, and after taking his diploma in 1964, he joined the four year post-graduate education in town planning at the Institute of Urban Development and Regional Planning at the RWTH Aachen. Career Peter Latz and his wife, Anneliese, founded their landscape architecture office in Aachen and in 1968 in Saarbr√ºcken under the name Latz + Partner. Another firm for urban planning, system planning and landscape planning was set up and run between 1970 and 1976 in cooperation with fellow architect Conny Schmitz. Latz continues to practice landscape architecture and town planning, working with groups of architects, sociologists, and economists. Latz started teaching in 1968 as a lecturer at the Limburgse Akademie voor Bouwkunst (Limburg Academy of Architecture) in Maastricht. He became a full-time professor for landscape architecture at the Gesamthochschule Kassel in 1973 and was appointed as a professor at the Landscape Architecture and Landscape Planning Department at the Technical University of Munich in 1983 where he retired in 2008. Among his best known projects is the Landschaftspark Duisburg-Nord in the Ruhr region of Germany. The site of 230 hectares was formerly a very large steel mill. When it became derelict, Latz + Partner, the firm was commissioned to design the park after winning an international design competition with the master plan for the whole site in 1991. They decided to keep the main structures and to incorporate them into a postmodern landscape design. A series of gardens were planted within and around the ruins with the use of the traditional horticulture. Clipped hedges, knot gardens, parterres, bosquets and rose gardens had created a juxtaposition between this formal garden that is situated within a post-industrial site. Duisburg-Nord was a successful landscape garden because Latz had altered the relationship that humans had with the existing site. Because of this project Peter Latz is considered to be, along with American landscape architect Richard Haag, one of the international pioneers for the reclamation and conversion of former industrialized landscapes. The philosophy of his Latz + Partner firm focuses not only on quality but also on the technical competence and the know-how. Since the 1980s, the firm begins to gear towards the metamorphosis of postindustrial sites.

Playing career Before being drafted, Murray played hockey in the Western Hockey League, for the Regina Pats. He was never known as a scorer (peaking at 33 goals, 63 points), but made a name for himself for his hard work and willingness to stand up for his teammates, demonstrated by three 150 PIM-exceeding seasons. The New York Rangers took a chance on him, drafting him in the third round, 79th overall, in the 2001 NHL Entry Draft. He was a part of team Canada's silver medal team at the 2002 World Junior Hockey Championships. He played for the New York Rangers' AHL affiliate, the Hartford Wolf Pack, and was briefly called up for a 20-game stint, where he scored one goal and recorded 24 PIMs. At the start of the 2005‚Äì2006 season, he was traded by the Rangers to the Montreal Canadiens in exchange for left wing Marcel Hossa. He began the 2005‚Äì2006 regular season playing in the AHL for the Hamilton Bulldogs. He played 26 games, scoring a total of one goal and one assist while racking up 46 PIMs. His perseverance eventually convinced Habs GM Bob Gainey to call Murray up to fill in for injuries, and he would stay there for the rest of the season. He scored only five goals and six points in his 36 games as a Hab, along with 44 PIMs, but impressed the team and fans by his tireless work ethic and tough-as-nails style of play. Many fans believe his success caused Niklas Sundstr√∂m to be removed from the Canadiens' future plans, taking his spot on the fourth line alongside Steve B√©gin and Radek Bonk. Murray began the 2006‚Äì2007 season on the Canadiens' starting line-up but eventually lost his spot to the likes of Maxim Lapierre. On November 12, 2007, Murray was placed on waivers by the Canadiens and was claimed by the Florida Panthers. On July 18, 2008, Murray was signed to a one-year contract by the Phoenix Coyotes. On October 6, 2011, Murray was signed to a try-out contract with the St. John's IceCaps of the AHL. After establishing a role within the IceCaps to start the 2011‚Äì12 season, Murray was signed to a year-long contract on December 6, 2011. In his final professional season before retirement he finished the season as the IceCaps leader in penalty minutes and was awarded as the first ever winner of the fans choice award.

It lies south of Bedale. The population of the parish was estimated at 30 in 2015. At the 2011 Census the population was now included with the civil parish of Bedale, and not counted separately. The manor was owned by Auduid before the Norman Conquest. By 1086, it was held by Count Alan who also had many lands in the area and who owned the manor of Bedale. Count Alan and his family owned the parish for over two centuries and by the late 14th century, it was in a different family name. Firby was a Liberty of Richmondshire and within the bounds of East Hang wapentake in the North Riding of Yorkshire, it is now within Crakehall ward of Hambleton district. The gardens at Thorp Perrow lie just to the south of the village and are in the parish of Firby. Some names of places within Firby include: Firby Hall, Firby (Christ's) Hospital, John Clapham House, Firby Grange (a former subdivision of Jervaulx Abbey), Low Ash Bank and High Ash Bank, Mile House Farm and Manley Farm. Christ's Hospital was founded in 1608 and was originally four almshouses. The building is now grade II listed. Firby Hall Firby Hall, also grade II listed, was built in 1788 by Colonel Thomas Coores who fought in the American War of Independence. He demolished much of the village to build the house and the estate. Firby was the origin of the surname Firby. The name of the village derives from a personal name (Frithi) and the suffix By meaning village or farmstead.

The primary component of a blister pack is a cavity or pocket made from a formable web, usually a thermoformed plastic. This usually has a backing of paperboard or a lidding seal of aluminum foil or plastic. A blister that folds onto itself is often called a clamshell. Blister packs are useful for protecting products against external factors, such as humidity and contamination for extended periods of time. Opaque blisters also protect light-sensitive products against UV rays. Uses Blister packs are used to package products such as toys, hardware, medication, etc. Many blister packaging machines use heat and pressure via a die to form the cavity or pocket from a roll or sheet of plastic. In recent years, improvements in cold forming‚Äîspecifically allowing steeper depth/angles during forming, which minimizes the amount of material used for each cavity‚Äîhave helped this technology increase. The main advantages of the plastic-based blister pack are its more compact size compared to cold formed aluminum and its transparency to see the product. =Unit dose packaging of pharmaceuticals= Tablets in a blister Blister packs are commonly used as unit-dose packaging for pharmaceutical tablets, capsules or lozenges. Blister packs can provide barrier protection for shelf life requirements, and a degree of tamper resistance. In the US, blister packs are mainly used for packing physician samples of drug products or for over-the-counter (OTC) products in the pharmacy. In other parts of the world, blister packs are the main packaging type since pharmacy dispensing and re-packaging are not common. A series of blister cavities is sometimes called a blister card or blister strip as well as blister pack. The difference between a strip pack and blister pack is that a strip pack does not have thermo-formed or cold formed cavities; the strip pack is formed around the tablet at a time when it is dropped to the sealing area between sealing moulds. In some parts of the world the pharmaceutical blister pack is known as a push-through pack (PTP), an accurate description of two key properties (i) the lidding foil is brittle, making it possible to press the product out while breaking the lidding foil and (ii) a semi-rigid formed cavity being sufficiently collapsible to be able to dispense the tablet or capsule by means of pressing it out with the thumb. Breaking the lidding foil with a fingernail for the appropriate tablet will make the pressing out easier. The main advantages of unit-dose blister packs over other methods of packing pharmaceutical products are the assurance of product/packaging integrity (including shelf-life) of each individual dose and the ability to create a compliance pack or calendar pack by printing the days of the week above each dose. Blister packs are created by means of a form-fill-seal process at the pharmaceutical company or designated contract packer. A form- fill-seal process means that the blister pack is created from rolls of flat sheet or film, filled with the pharmaceutical product and closed (sealed) on the same equipment. Such equipment is called a blisterline. There are two types of blister machine' design: rotary and flat-plate, depending on the mechanism for sealing the lidding foil. =Consumer goods= A typical blister-packaged consumer good Other types of blister packs consist of carded packaging where goods such as toys, hardware, and electrical items are contained between a specially made paperboard card and clear pre-formed plastic such as PVC. The consumer can visually examine the product through the transparent plastic. The plastic shell is vacuum-formed around a mold so it can contain the item snugly. The card is colored and designed depending on the item inside, and the PVC is affixed to the card using heat and pressure to activate an adhesive (heat seal coating) on the blister card. The adhesive is strong enough so that the pack may hang on a peg, but weak enough so that the package can be easily opened (in theory). Sometimes, with large items, the card (cold seal card) has a perforated window for access. =Clamshell= A hinged blister is known as a clamshell, used for a variety of products. It can be used as a security package to deter package pilferage for small high-value items, such as consumer electronics. It consists of one sheet folded over onto itself and sometimes fused at the edges. They can be securely heat sealed, making them difficult to open by hand to deter tampering. A pair of scissors or a sharp knife is often required to open them (although these are often sold in similar packages). Trauma shears are also effective at opening packaging of this type. Care must be used to safely open some of these packages, as opening it without care can result in injury; 6,000 Americans are sent to the emergency room each year by injuries suffered in opening such packages. Wrap rage is sometimes the result. =Medical blister trays= Medical blister trays differ from pharmaceutical blister packs in that these are not push- through packs. The thermoformed base web is made of a thicker plastic sheet, generally between 500 and 1000 ¬µg and can not be collapsed, thus forming a solid tray. The lidding film provides a peel-open feature and is generally porous to allow sterilization (such as the Dupont medical Tyvek material). Such medical blister packs are used for sterile medical devices, used in hospitals. Methods =Thermoforming= In the case of thermoforming, a plastic film or sheet is unwound from the reel and guided though a pre-heating station on the blister line. The temperature of the pre-heating plates (upper and lower plates) is such that the plastic will soften and become pliable. The warm plastic will then arrive in a forming station where a large pressure (4 to 8 bar) will form the blister cavity into a negative mold. The mold is cooled such that the plastic becomes rigid again and maintains its shape when removed from the mold. In case of difficult shapes, the warm film will be physically pushed down partially into the cavity by a \\"plug-assist\\" feature. Plug-assist results in a blister cavity with more uniform wall distribution and is typically used when the cavity size and shape is larger than a small tablets and cables. =Cold forming= In the case of cold forming, an aluminum-based laminate film is simply pressed into a mold by means of a stamp. The aluminum will be elongated and maintain the formed shape. In the industry these blisters are called cold form foil (CFF) blisters. The principal advantage of cold form foil blisters is that the use of aluminum offers a near complete barrier for water and oxygen, allowing an extended product expiry date. The principal disadvantages of cold form foil blisters are: the slower speed of production compared to thermoforming; the lack of transparency of the package (a therapy compliance disadvantage); and the larger size of the blister card (aluminum can not be formed with near 90 degree angles). =Thermo Cold Forming= In Thermo-Cold Forming process, the first packing is done by thermo forming technique after which the product is re packed with a Cold forming package. Materials =PVC= The most basic material for the forming web is polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The principal advantages of PVC are the low cost and the ease of thermoforming. The main disadvantages are the poor barrier against moisture ingress and oxygen ingress. In the case of blister packaging the PVC sheet does not contain any plasticizer and is sometimes referred to as Rigid PVC or RPVC. In the absence of plasticizers, PVC blisters offer structural rigidity and physical protection for the pharmaceutical dosage form. On the other hand, the blister cavity must remain accessible by the push-through effect and the formed web may not be too hard to collapse when pressed upon; for this reason the PVC sheet thickness is typically chosen between 200¬µ to 300¬µ depending on the cavity size and shape. Most PVC sheets for pharmaceutical blisters are 250¬µ or 0.250 mm in thickness. Typical values for the Water Vapor Transmission Rate (WVTR or MVTR) of a 250¬µ PVC film are around 3.0 g/m2/day measured at 38 ¬∞C/90% RH and the Oxygen Transmission Rate (OTR) is around 20 mL/m2/day. In order to overcome the lack of barrier properties of PVC film, it can be coated with PVDC or laminated to PCTFE or COC to increase the protective properties. Multi-layer blister films based on PVC are often used for pharmaceutical blister packaging, whereby the PVC serves as the thermoformable backbone of the structure. Also, the PVC layer can be colored with pigments and/or UV filters. The European Pharmacopoeia (Ph Eur) references the requirements for PVC blister packs for pharmaceutical primary packaging in the monograph EP 3.1.11 \\"MATERIALS BASED ON NON-PLASTICISED POLY(VINYL CHLORIDE) FOR CONTAINERS FOR DRY DOSAGE FORMS FOR ORAL ADMINISTRATION\\". In order to be suitable for pharmaceutical blister packs, the PVC formulation also needs to comply with the US Pharmacopoeia <661>; EU food legislation; US 21.CFR and Japanese food contact requirements. =PVDC= Polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC) can be coated onto a PVC film to obtain very high moisture and oxygen barrier properties depending on the coating weight. PVDC coated blister films are the most common and prevailing barrier films used for pharmaceutical blister packs. PVDC coatings are also the most economical method for adding water barrier and oxygen barrier properties to a PVC film. PVDC blister films are available in 2 or 3 layer specifications referred to as duplex or triplex. Since the PVDC is applied by a coating process, the coating weight is expressed in grams per square meter (gsm). Duplex structures are typically PVC/PVDC films, ranging from 250¬µPVC/40gsmPVDC to 250¬µPVC/120gsmPVDC with WVTR from 0,65 to 0,25 g/m2/d and OTR from 1 to 0,1 cc/m2/d. For very deep draw thermoformed cavities, the triplex specifications are used : PVC/PE/PVDC, where the PE layer assists when forming deeper cavities. The PE (polyethylene) forms a soft intermediate layer between the rigid PVC and PVDC layers. Triplex specifications exists in similar coating weights as duplex specifications: 250¬µPVC/25¬µPE/40gsmPVDC up to 250¬µPVC/25¬µPE/120gsmPVDC. In order to obtain high barrier properties, PVDC is always applied using an emulsion coating process using a PVDC resin dispersed in water. The film producer applies the coating in several steps, drying-off the water between each coating station. PVDC grades are available in 2 types of polymer: (I) the historic grades offering medium to high barrier properties and (II) a super barrier coating grade offering the highest barrier. The SBC grade has over two times the barrier to moisture and oxygen per gram coating weight compared to the historic grades. The most common structures using the super barrier PVDC are triplex configurations 250¬µ PVC/25¬µ PE/120gsm PVDC up to 250¬µ PVC/25¬µ PE/180gsm PVDC, with WVTR of 0,11 down to 0,06 g/m2/day and available from various suppliers. =PCTFE= Polychlorotrifluoroethylene (PCTFE) can be laminated to PVC to obtain very high moisture barrier. Typical constructions used for pharmaceutical products are 250¬µ PVC film laminated to 15¬µ-150¬µ PCTFE film. Duplex structures are PVC/PCTFE and triplex laminates are PVC/PE/PCTFE. Deeper cavities can be formed by using the triplex structures with PE. Typical WVTR values are 0.06‚Äì0.40 g/m2/day. PCTFE films have the lowest water vapor permeation compared to all other plastic films used in blister packaging and have thermoforming properties similar to plain PVC though it is also the most expensive. Despite narrow thermoforming temperatures and required cooling steps PP is increasingly popular. This popularity is due in part to it not suffering the environmental liability that PVC suffers in discharging hydrochloric acid during incineration. Unplasticised PVC has good thermoforming properties but may not provide good moisture protection for some products. After the forming process a 250 ¬µm film will have a final thickness of 50 to 100 ¬µm in some deep drawn pockets. The reduction in thickness will result in an increase in WVT. =COC= Cyclic olefin copolymers (COC) or polymers (COP) can provide moisture barrier to blister packs, typically in multilayered combinations with polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), or glycol-modified polyethylene terephthalate (PETg). Cyclic olefin resins are generally amorphous and are noted for good thermoforming characteristics even in deep cavities, leading some to use COC in blister packaging as a thermoforming enhancer, particularly in combination with semicrystalline resins such as PP or PE. Films can be manufactured via coextrusion or lamination. WVTR values of commercial cyclic olefin-based pharmaceutical blister films typically range from 0.20 to 0.35 g/m2/day at 38 ¬∞C/90% RH. Unlike PVC and other common pharmaceutical barrier resins, cyclic olefin resins do not contain chlorine or other halogens in their molecular structure, being composed solely of carbon and hydrogen. Cyclic olefin resins are available which comply with pharmaceutical packaging guidelines in the US, Europe, and Japan. =Cold form foil= Cold form foil film (or cold-formed foil) is made of a 3-layer laminate: PVC/Aluminum/Polyamide. The PVC side is on the inside in contact with the product. Cold Form Foil blister pack =Lidding foils= Pharmaceutical blister packs are mostly closed by a push- through or peel-open lidding foil. The most common lidding foil with push- through features is 20¬µ hard tamper aluminum, which can be supplied pinhole- free from the producers. The lidding foil is coated with a heat-seal lacquer on the inside and a print primer on the outside. Benefits =Cost savings= Blister packaging is a cost-effective way of showcasing a product. Due to the nature of the material and design, it makes it more cost-effective than other types of packages that are on the market. There are several different types of blister packaging ‚Äì Face Seal, Trap, Mock, Slide and Interactive. Each one has its unique qualities and price points, from entry level to high end. =Advertising space= There is a wide range of colors and finishes that blister packaging can be constructed to feature. Manufacturers can use that to help make their products stand out on shelves. Blister packaging allows either the manufacturer or retailer to include promotional materials or advertisements to help build a brand and increase customer loyalty. =Clear product display= Blister packaging helps shoppers see product, further aiding in their purchase decision. More than half of shoppers believe it is important to see a product through its packaging. =Theft deterrent packaging= To prevent retail theft, packages are specifically designed so that the customer cannot ‚Äútouch and feel‚Äù the product. Clear, protective, and durable thermoformed plastic packaging enables the customer to fully view the product while maintaining the security of the product. Blister packaging can easily be sealed using heat sealing machinery. =Tamper evident= A tamper-evident package, according to the regulations of the Food and Drug Administration (21 CFR ¬ß 211.132), ‚Äúis one having one or more indicators or barriers to entry which, if breached or missing, can reasonably be expected to provide visible evidence to consumers that tampering has occurred.‚Äù In addition, the indicator or barrier must be ‚Äúdistinctive by design,‚Äù which means the tamper-evident feature is designed from material not readily available to the public. Therefore, it cannot be easily duplicated. The labeling must also include a description of the safety feature. For blister packaging, each tablet or capsule is individually sealed, so any form of tampering is immediately visible. The product label needs to include a statement similar to the following: ‚ÄúDo not use if blister is cut or broken.‚Äù See also * Heat sealer * Pharmacy automation * Skin pack * Ultrasonic welding * Wrap rage References Further reading * Yam, K.

It was particularly notable as having been one of the first Swedish brands to recognise and to use the power of mass media. The brand was originally made by the soap manufacturer Grumme & Son, acquired 1985 by pharmaceutical company Cederroth AB. The company made extensive use of press, film and signs, both enamel and neon. It is particularly known for the large advertisement sign which has been a prominent local landmark at Slussen in Stockholm since 1909. The Stomatol Sign, made from lightbulbs, not neon tubes, was the first animated advertisement sign in Sweden (one can see the toothpaste being squeezed out of the tube). It was originally placed on the Katarinahissen elevator, but was moved in 1933 to the roof of the nearby building at Klevgr√§nd 1 B. Technical problems have forced the electricity to be shut down between 1963 and 1972 and from 1981 until 1986. Many Stomatol film commercials were animated. At least ten of the commercials produced in and around 1930 were drawn by Arvid Olson and Victor Bergdahl, creator of Captain Grogg. Live action, near-feature quality ads were produced around that time by Kinocentralen and which starred popular Swedish comedic actor Thor Mod√©en. Mod√©en was well known for living a rather extravagant lifestyle, mostly paid for through his work for Stomatol. The brand's slogan was \\"Stomatol - the only way to obtain healthy and strong teeth!\\" Stomatol was also manufactured and sold in Norway. Stomatol toothpaste was first manufactured by Carl A. H√∏yers Stomatolfabrikk A/S i Oslo, which got the exclusive rights for the Norwegian market in 1896. They continued to make Stomatol until they were acquired by competitor Marwell Hauge i 1970, and the Stomatol brand name was discontinued in Norway some time after.

A fairly long-lived July Atlantic hurricane, Claudette began as a tropical wave in the eastern Caribbean. It moved quickly westward, brushing past the Yucat√°n Peninsula before moving northwestward through the Gulf of Mexico. Claudette remained a tropical storm until just before making landfall in Port O'Connor, Texas, when it quickly strengthened to a strong Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Forecasting of its path and intensity was uncertain throughout its lifetime, resulting in widespread and often unnecessary preparations along its path. Claudette was the first hurricane to make landfall in July in the United States since Hurricane Danny in the 1997 season. The hurricane caused two deaths and moderate damage in Texas, mostly from strong winds, as well as extensive beach erosion. Because of the damage, President George W. Bush declared portions of South Texas a Federal Disaster Area, allowing the affected citizens to apply for aid. Claudette also caused significant rainfall and minor damage in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo as a tropical storm, as well as minor damage on Saint Lucia before developing into a tropical cyclone. Meteorological history A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on July 1. It steadily organized as it moved westward, and resembled a tropical depression by July 7. However, surface reports and reconnaissance aircraft indicated the system did not have tropical characteristics, and remained simply a low-pressure system. The wave produced tropical storm-force winds as it moved through the Lesser Antilles on July 8, but did not acquire tropical characteristics until it reached the eastern Caribbean. Because it had tropical storm-force winds, the system was upgraded immediately to Tropical Storm Claudette after it developed a low-level circulation later on July 8. By early on July 9, while south of Puerto Rico, Claudette quickly strengthened over the warm waters of the Caribbean, and its strongest winds were just shy of the threshold for hurricane intensity. Possibly due to its fast forward motion, the storm became disorganized and weakened. Conditions briefly became more favorable over the western Caribbean, and Claudette reached hurricane status for six hours on July 10. Soon after, the storm encountered unfavorable upper-level winds and weakened back into a tropical storm. In response to a break in the subtropical ridge‚Äîa high-pressure ridge that often prevents tropical systems from moving northward‚Äîit turned to the west-northwest. Claudette made its first landfall at Puerto Morelos on the Yucat√°n Peninsula, on July 11, as a tropical storm with winds. Hurricane Claudette making landfall on Texas on July 15 Claudette wobbled to the northwest over the Gulf of Mexico and gradually restrengthened. Upper-level winds steadily decreased, and Claudette again became a hurricane late on July 14. Just prior to landfall, it strengthened quickly and picked up its forward motion in a more westerly direction, striking Port O'Connor, Texas, on July 15, as a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale with 90 mph (150 km/h) winds. Residents along and inland of the central Texas coast were caught off guard both by its intensity and its time of arrival. The hurricane was projected to make landfall in the evening hours of July 15, but instead came ashore before noon. Furthermore, some initial estimates suggested that Claudette had reached Category 2 status, with sustained winds of up to 100 mph (155 km/h); these were based on unofficial observations which were not backed up by official data. As slow as Claudette was to strengthen, it was also slow to dissipate over land. Inland hurricane warnings were issued for several counties away from the coastline and winds gusted to at Victoria Regional Airport. It maintained tropical storm intensity for over 24 hours after landfall, a rarity for such a weak storm; most tropical systems weaken rapidly after landfall, as they are separated from the warm waters that power them. The storm finally lost its low-level circulation early on July 17 over Chihuahua, although its rainfall and upper-level circulation crossed over Southern California and continued into the Pacific Ocean. Preparations Mexican officials issued a tropical storm warning 37 hours prior to the storm's landfall between Chetumal and Cabo Catoche, Quintana Roo. The warning was upgraded to a hurricane warning about a day before landfall, but was downgraded when Claudette weakened just 13 hours prior to its landfall in the Yucat√°n Peninsula. The Mexican government declared a state of emergency in the projected path of the storm, and declared an evacuation order for 1,500 citizens in Quintana Roo. There, residents remained calm during the evacuation. Tourists left nightclubs for supermarkets to stock up on, among other items, beer, which was banned at midnight. Schools were set up as shelters, while police forced tourists to remain in their hotels. The consistent variation in the path of Claudette caused uncertainty over the strength and location of its final landfall. On July 13, two days prior to Claudette's eventual landfall, the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch between Brownsville and Port O'Connor, Texas. By the next day, a hurricane warning existed from Baffin Bay to High Island, Texas, while a tropical storm warning extended from High Island to Intracoastal City, Louisiana. When it became apparent that Louisiana would not be affected significantly by the storm, the state's tropical storm warnings were canceled. In Texas, Galveston County officials recommended evacuations for western Galveston Island and Jamaica Beach, 24 hours prior to Claudette's projected landfall. The Emergency Phone Notification System notified citizens in the evening to avoid evacuating during the night. Many citizens heeded the evacuation suggestion, some of whom remembered the flooding from Tropical Storm Frances five years before. Hurricane Claudette also affected the oil industry. ExxonMobil, Chevron Corporation, ConocoPhillips, Royal Dutch Shell, Marathon Oil, Unocal Corporation, and Anadarko Petroleum all limited production and evacuated many of their workers. Chevron, which evacuated more than 1,800 workers, returned many of its workers on the day when Claudette made landfall. Unocal closed 23 rigs and platforms in the region. The combined closures stopped the daily production of per day of oil and of natural gas, which accounted for 15% of the total production in the Gulf of Mexico. Impact Rainfall totals from Claudette Outside of Texas, Hurricane Claudette caused little damage due to its low intensity. In total, damage estimates rose to $180 million (2003 USD, $198 million 2006 USD), and the storm caused one direct and two indirect deaths. One of the indirect deaths occurred from a man having a heart attack while surfing in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, while the second indirect death involved a woman being killed by a falling tree limb in Texas, after the storm had passed. =Caribbean Sea= Tropical Storm Claudette hitting the Yucat√°n Peninsula on July 11 As a tropical wave, Claudette dropped torrential rainfall and brought strong winds to the island of Saint Lucia. The George F. L. Charles Airport in Castries reported a wind gust of , while other parts of the island experienced nearly horizontal rainfall from the gusts. On the northern and eastern portions of the island, the strong winds ripped off roofs and downed trees across roadways. Overall, damage was light, and amounted to $1.1 million (2003 USD, $ USD). In the Dominican Republic, the outer bands of the storm caused moderate rainfall of up to in Santo Domingo. Winds gusted up to , knocking down trees, sign posts, and iron roofs. Also, flooding in metropolitan areas blocked traffic for cars and pedestrians. Banana and other fruit plantations in the southwestern portion of the country experienced severe damage, although exact damage totals are unknown. On Jamaica, the storm caused wind gusts of in Montego Bay. Forecasters predicted high tides, strong waves, and up to of rain on the island, although exact post-storm totals are not known. Many fishermen moved their boats from the water to safety, while a cruise line diverted three ships away from Claudette's path. In the Cayman Islands, where the storm remained away at its closest point, rainfall totals ranged from . On the south side of Grand Cayman, Claudette caused wave heights of around , while the western side received little precipitation. Also on Grand Cayman, the storm caused winds of , causing minor tree damage but little else. On Mexico's Yucat√°n Peninsula, Claudette lashed strong waves against the coastline at Canc√∫n, but overall caused light damage. While crossing the peninsula, the storm dropped moderate rainfall, including a total of in Canc√∫n. Winds were moderate, causing the Canc√∫n International Airport to delay several flights, though there were no cancellations. Overall, Claudette sank a few small boats and flooded a few streets in Canc√∫n, though damage was minor in the Yucat√°n Peninsula. =Texas= Palacios Upon making landfall on the central Texas coast, Claudette's storm surge reached a maximum height of in Galveston. Freeport reported a \\"storm tide\\"‚Äîthe overall rise of water over the mean low tide‚Äîof . Claudette produced moderate rainfall across southern Texas, peaking at in Tilden. On Matagorda Island, the local weather station measured winds of ‚Äîthe only official report of hurricane-force winds along the coastline. However, several offshore oil rigs reported winds of up to , and one unofficial reading in Seadrift indicated winds of . This report would suggest the storm was a low-end Category 2 hurricane, though this contradicted Hurricane Hunters' data, which pointed to a storm of a lesser intensity. Severe beach erosion occurred from High Island to Freeport, though large geo- tubes reduced the erosion on Galveston Island and the Bolivar Peninsula. The outer bands of the hurricane spawned two tornadoes. One was an F1 on the Fujita scale that caused damage to several buildings in Palacios, and the other damaged homes in Port Lavaca. Widespread flooding and gusty winds destroyed 204 houses along the southeast Texas coastline, most of which occurred in Matagorda County. In addition, the winds damaged 1,407 homes, with 144 of them being severely damaged. The wind also affected 147 businesses, of which 64 were either destroyed or severely damaged. Strong winds downed numerous power lines, leaving around 74,000 residents without power in the immediate aftermath. Overall, Claudette caused $180 million (2003 USD, $ USD) in damage in Texas and one death directly from a fallen tree during the storm. Also, the storm was indirectly responsible for another death, when a tree limb fell on a woman in the aftermath of the storm. Aftermath Beach erosion caused by Claudette On July 17, President George W. Bush declared 18 south Texas counties as a federal disaster area. Within 2 months of the storm, over 15,000 citizens registered for assistance. The government approved $34.8 million (2003 USD, $ USD) in aid, of which nearly half went to basic house repairs. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provided 75% of the $1.35 million (2003 USD, $ USD) debris removal cost, with the other 25% being covered through local agencies. FEMA also provided $1.26 million (2003 USD, $ USD) to repair geo-tubes on the Bolivar Peninsula in Galveston County. The geo-tubes, which protect buildings along coastal areas, were severely damaged by the hurricane. In western Texas, heavy rainfall of up to temporarily sparked widespread growth of wildflowers in a normally arid landscape. The rainfall restored the flow of the Rio Grande at Big Bend National Park, which had ceased in the area due to lack of rainfall. In addition, the precipitation increased the water level in the Amistad Reservoir by more than .

The film spawned two sequels by the Pang brothers, The Eye 2 and The Eye 10. There are three remakes of this film, including Adhu, made in 2004 in Tamil, Naina made in 2005 in Hindi and The Eye, a 2008 Hollywood production starring Jessica Alba. Plot Blind since the age of five, 20-year-old Hong Kong classical violinist Wong Kar Mun undergoes an eye cornea transplant after receiving a pair of new eyes from a donor. Initially, she is glad to have her sight restored but becomes troubled when she starts seeing mysterious figures that seem to foretell gruesome deaths. The night before her discharge from hospital, she sees a shadowy figure accompanying a patient out of the room and the next morning the patient is pronounced dead. Mun goes to see her doctor's nephew, Dr. Wah, a psychotherapist , about the strange entities that she has been seeing. He is skeptical at first, but as he gradually develops a closer relationship with her, he decides to accompany her on a trip to northern Thailand to find Ling, the eye donor. When they ask a village doctor about Ling and her family, he is unwilling to reveal anything but becomes more cooperative when Mun tells him that she sees what Ling used to see. Apparently, Ling had a psychic ability that allowed her to foresee death and disaster. However, her fellow villagers misunderstood her as a jinx and refused to trust her. Once, Ling tried to warn the people about an imminent disaster, but they drove her away in disbelief. When her vision came true, she felt guilty about the deaths and hanged herself. Ling's mother is both depressed and angry with her daughter and has never forgiven Ling for committing suicide, until one night Ling's spirit possesses Mun and attempts suicide. Ling's mother saves Mun and breaks down, saying that she has forgiven Ling and Ling's spirit leaves in peace. On the return journey, their bus is caught in a traffic jam and Mun sees hundreds of ghostly figures lumbering on the road. Believing that a catastrophe is approaching, she runs out of the bus and tries to warn everyone to leave, but no one understands her and think that she is insane. In fact, the traffic jam is due to a tank truck that has toppled over and is blocking the road. The truck starts leaking natural gas but nobody notices it. A driver restarts his engine and ignites the gas, causing a chain explosion. Dr. Wah saves Mun from death by shielding her with his body, but Mun is already blinded by glass fragments. In the epilogue, a blind Mun is seen roaming the streets of Hong Kong. Although she has lost her sense of sight again, she is happy that she now has the support and friendship of Dr. Wah.

It followed several earlier prototype systems, such as the NRL radar installed in April 1937 on the destroyer ; its successor, the XAF, installed in December 1938 on the battleship ; and the first RCA-designed system, the CXZ, installed in December 1938 or January 1939 on the battleship . Based on testing in January 1939, where the XAF was more reliable, the US Navy ordered RCA to build six XAF-based units for deployment and then shortly thereafter ordered 14 more.

Radar detection range of aircraft depends on altitude, size, and number of the target aircraft, as well as the radar's characteristics, such as transmitter power and receiver sensitivity. Surface ships are more difficult to detect due to a number of factors such as signal return from waves (called in general ground clutter), distance to the horizon (due to the curvature of the earth), elevation of the radar antenna, height of the target above the sea surface, and water vapor in the air. These factors serve to reduce the range at which a surface target can be detected when compared to aircraft. The CXAM is listed (in U.S. Radar, Operational Characteristics of Radar Classified by Tactical Application) as being able to detect single aircraft at and to detect large ships at .

Shaw (born July 25, 1943), generally known as Rick Shaw, served as insurance commissioner for the State of West Virginia from 1977 to 1985, under incumbent Governor Jay Rockefeller. Shaw was the first African American to serve as West Virginia insurance commissioner, and one of the first African Americans to head a West Virginia state agency overall. (Dr. Mildred Mitchell- Bateman was likely the first, becoming director of the West Virginia Department of Mental Health in 1962.) During his tenure as insurance commissioner, Shaw was primarily noted for his ability to speak to the common man, as he enjoyed traveling throughout the state to meet personally with industry workers and hear their concerns. This was especially important during a period in which West Virginia was experiencing one of the worst economic crises in the state‚Äôs history. Born in Clemson, South Carolina, to Lewis H. Shaw Sr., a minister and businessman, and Grace Williams, a homemaker, Richard Shaw graduated from South Carolina State University during the mid-1960s. He had wanted to attend a local primarily white college but was denied admission due to segregation. After college, Shaw moved to Washington, D.C., where he married Dr. Patricia Friday Shaw in 1966, then a Howard University graduate student. The Shaws later moved to Wheeling, West Virginia, where Richard found work with a prominent insurance corporation until his appointment by Governor Rockefeller in 1977. Shaw then moved to Charleston, West Virginia, the capital. At the end of Rockefeller‚Äôs tenure as governor, Shaw relocated again to Washington, D.C. with his family, at which time he became an ordained minister. (He should not be confused with a different Reverend Richard G. Shaw, who served as pastor of Georgetown Baptist Church from 1983 to 1990.) Reverend and Dr. Shaw have three children and three grandchildren.

Historically in the North Riding of Yorkshire, it lies on the River Leven. Stokesley is about two miles south of the Middlesbrough borough boundary and eight miles south of Middlesbrough town centre. Stokesley is between Middlesbrough, Guisborough and Northallerton in a farming area. Local attractions nearby include Great Ayton, Captain Cook's monument and Roseberry Topping in the North York Moors National Park. History Three Tuns Wynd leading from the High Street to North Road Stokesley was granted a charter to hold fairs in 1223 by Henry III. The Pack Horse Bridge crossing over the River Leven dates from the 17th century. Its large range of building types, including fine Georgian architecture has contributed to its character. Prominent historical features include the Mill Wheel, thought to represent the site of a mill recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086. Domesday also recorded \\"a church and priest\\" in Stokesley. There are three churches in Stokesley. One of these, the Church of St Peter and St Paul, is the oldest building in town, and it is just off the Market Plain. It has a medieval tower and chancel, a Georgian nave built around 1777, colourful 20th- century stained glass and woodwork carved by the Mouseman of Kilburn. Co- operative Food Supermarket in Stokesley before refurbishment The historic High Street is lined with independent small shops and restaurants. Other facilities include a leisure centre with a swimming pool, a recently-refurbished, medium- sized Co-operative Food supermarket, showground, camping site, health centre, industrial estate, library, police and fire stations. The town has four pubs (The Queen's Head, The White Swan, The Mill and The Spread Eagle). Stokesley is also the home of Quorn, produced by Marlow Foods. There are 80 grade II listed buildings (including Peaton Carr Farm, which is within the parish boundary), along with four Grade II* listed buildings of special architectural or historic interest. They are the former Barclays Bank, Handyside Cottage, the Manor House and the Old Rectory. The inaugural meeting of Stokesley Agricultural Society was held at the Golden Lion Hotel, now The Leven Hotel, in 1859. The hotel was also used as the law court for the area being placed between Middlesbrough and Northallerton. Stokesley Agricultural Show, first held in 1859, is held every year on the third Saturday in September. It is one of the largest one day shows in the north of England. A weekly market is held on Friday in the main square called the Plain. A farmers' market takes place on the first Saturday of each month. Stokesley Fair A four-day fair takes place in September in the town centre. The fair spans the full length of the high street and rides such as Speed Buzz, the Extreme, Vertigo, King Frog, Cyclone and various Crows rides attend. The fair begins on Wednesday evening and runs until the Saturday, opening all day on the Saturday at the same time as the annual agricultural show which takes place on the showground. Governance An electoral ward in the same name stretching north to Newby had a population at the 2011 Census of 5,537. Transport Stokesley Fire Station Stokesley Police Station Stokesley is served by the Arriva North East service 28a from Middlesbrough every hour and the 81 from Marske Estate every hour. Abbott's of Leeming run services 80/89, which run every two hours. The services operate six days a week towards Northallerton and Romanby via Osmotherley. Stokesley was served by rail and had a railway station and extensive sidings on the Northallerton to Stockton branch. The station closed to passengers in June 1954, pre-dating the large scale closures of the Beeching cuts. Goods facilities remained until August 1965 when the line closed completely. The station featured in British Transport Films' \\"A Farmer Moves South\\" in 1951. The nearest railway station is now at Great Ayton.  Education  Historic schools include Preston Grammar School in College Square: now a pizza takeaway. In 1918 it was closed for failing to reach the standards of an inspection; primarily caused by lack of funds. In general, children who passed exams at 11 years old, then went to Yarm Grammar School, with some Catholic pupils going to Middlesbrough under the old system. Stokesley Primary School was created in 1908 and extended in 1973. It has about 550 pupils. Stokesley School,http://stokesleyschool.org Stokesley School was opened in 1959The Buildings of England Yorkshire The North Riding, N. Pevsner, Penguin Books, 1966 for pupils between 11 and 18 was originally a secondary modern and became a comprehensive school in the 1970s. Later a sixth form college was incorporated.

It is a common feature of hemophilia. Causes It usually follows injury but occurs mainly in patients with a predisposition to hemorrhage such as those being treated with warfarin (or other anticoagulants) and patients with hemophilia. It can be associated with knee joint arthroplasty. It has also been reported as a part of hemorrhagic syndrome in the Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever, suggesting a viral cause to the bleeding in a joint space. Diagnosis Hemarthrosis is diagnosed through the methods listed below: A physical examination is the first step, the joints of the patient are moved and bent to study the functioning. Synovial Fluid analysis is another method to diagnose Hemarthrosis. It involves a small needle being inserted into the joint to draw the fluid. Reddish-colored hue of the sample is an indication of the blood being present. Imaging tests are normally done. The tests also include MRI, Ultrasound and X-ray test, which give better information about the joint inflammation. Treatment In hemophilia it may occur spontaneously, and recurrent hemarthroses are a major cause of disability in that patient group due to hemophilic arthropathy, requiring synovectomy, joint replacement and increased medical therapy to prevent further bleeding episodes. Reducing hemarthroses events using intravenous administration of blood clotting factor concentrate on a regular basis starting in early childhood, reduces joint deterioration and increases the person's quality of life compared to \\"on demand\\" treatment (treating after a bleed). The minimal effective dose and best dosage frequency have not been established. It is not clear, due to lack of sufficient data, if preventative therapy with clotting factor concentrate is also effective at reducing joint deterioration if treatment is started after joint damage has occurred.

A decoration in the shape of a pickle is hidden on a Christmas tree, with the finder receiving either a reward or good fortune for the following year. There are a number of different origin stories attributed to the tradition, including an origination in Germany. This theory has since been discounted, and it is now thought to be a German-American tradition created in the late 19th century. Description In the tradition, an ornamental pickle is placed on a Christmas tree as one of the Christmas decorations. On Christmas morning, the first person to find the pickle on the tree would receive an extra present from Santa Claus or would be said to have a year of good fortune. Berrien Springs, Michigan, which billed itself as the Christmas pickle capital of the world, held a pickle parade from 1992 until about 2003. Origins This tradition is commonly believed by Americans to come from Germany and be referred to as a Weihnachtsgurke, but this is probably apocryphal. . It has been suggested that the origin of the Christmas pickle may have been developed for marketing purposes in the 1890s to coincide with the importation of glass Christmas tree decorations from Germany. Woolworths was the first company to import these types of decorations into the United States in 1890, and glass blown decorative vegetables were imported from France from 1892 onwards. Despite the evidence showing that the tradition did not originate in Germany, the concept of Christmas pickles has since been imported from the United States and they are now on sale in the country traditionally associated with it. One suggested origin has been that the tradition came from Camp Sumter during the American Civil War. The Bavarian- born Private John C. Lower had enlisted in the 103rd Pennsylvania Infantry, but was captured in April 1864 and taken to the prison camp. As the story is told, on Christmas Eve he begged a guard for a pickle while starving. The guard provided the pickle, which Lower later credited for saving his life. After returning to his family, he began a tradition of hiding a pickle on their Christmas tree each year. Another origin which comes from Berrien Springs is a Victorian era tale of St. Nicholas saving two Spanish children who were trapped in a barrel of pickles by an innkeeper, which actually derives from a much more gruesome medieval legend involving a cannibalistic butcher butchering and storing a group of boys in a barrel and St. Nicholas miraculously restoring and resurrecting them.

The episode is an homage to A League of Their Own. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 7, 2002. Bob Uecker provided the voice of himself, Tom Kenny provided the voice of Abner Doubledeal, and Hank Aaron guest starred as himself and Hank Aaron XXIV.  Plot  A new pizza restaurant run by Cygnoids has moved in across the street from the Planet Express building. Leela convinces the others that they should go to greet their new neighbors. They find that the Cygnoids have much to learn about Earth customs. Fry tries to help them get adjusted, first by giving them advice on how not to make pizza (such as not using live bees as an ingredient, not crushing rats to make wine, and not letting their relatives live in the pizza oven when not in use) and then by suggesting that they learn how to play blernsball (the 30th century version of baseball as seen in \\"Fear of a Bot Planet\\"). The Planet Express staff and the Cygnoids form teams and go to a blernsball diamond in a nearby park. While playing blernsball with the Cygnoids, Leela's lack of depth perception causes her to injure opposing players by beaning them in the head. Gaining notice from Abner Doubledeal, the owner of the New New York Mets, who thinks that having a one-eyed woman repeatedly bean opposing players would be a good novelty act, she becomes the first female player to play professional blernsball. Leela sees herself as a pioneer for women in sports, but Jackie Anderson, a female star for a college blernsball team, tells her that Leela is an embarrassment who is making it harder for legitimate female athletes to be taken seriously. Leela is on the fast track to becoming the worst blernsball player ever and seeks help to prevent that by enlisting Hank Aaron XXIV, a distant relative of Hank Aaron, who is currently the worst blernsball player of all time. After taking his advice, she throws a strike and is delighted. During the last game of the season, the Cygnoids sell their pizza in the stadium and their franchise is bought by Fishy Joe. With the Mets leading in the bottom of the ninth inning and two out, Leela pleads to be put in the game, explaining that she has been training with Hank Aaron. The manager gives in and Leela pitches to Jackie Anderson, who is making her professional debut. Leela throws two strikes, but on the third pitch Jackie hits a grand slam and wins the game. Leela walks away, unhappy until Jackie tells her that she really was a role model after all, since she encouraged women to try harder than ever in order to prove that they were not as bad as her. Meanwhile, at the blernsball museum, Hank Aaron XXIV sadly leaves his post as the worst blernsball player ever (now occupied by a cardboard cutout of Leela), with the head of the original Hank Aaron consoling him by reminding him that he is still the worst football player ever. Broadcast and reception In its initial airing, the episode received a Nielsen rating of 3.0/9, placing it 89th among primetime shows for the week of April 1‚Äì7, 2002. Zack Handlen of The A.V.

Ethoxyquin is also used in some spices to prevent color loss due to oxidation of the natural carotenoid pigments. Regulation Ethoxyquin was developed by Monsanto in the 1950s. Ethoxyquin was initially registered as a pesticide in 1965 as an antioxidant used as a deterrent of scald in pears through post- harvest indoor application via a drench and/or impregnated wrap. As an antioxidant to control the browning of pears, ethoxyquin is approved in the United States and in the European Union. In the United States, it is approved for use as an animal feed additive and is limited as a food additive to use only in the spices chili powder, paprika, and ground chili. Ethoxyquin is not permitted for use as food additive in Australia nor within the European Union. Ethoxyquin is allowed in the fishing industry in Norway and France as a feed stabilizer, so is commonly used in food pellets fed to farmed salmon. Ethoxyquin is used in pellets fed to chickens on chicken farms. In 2017 the EU suspended authorization for use as a feed additive, with various dates between 2017 and 2019 for final allowance of sale of goods so that alternatives may be phased in.https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32017R0962 Safety Some speculation exists that ethoxyquin in pet foods might be responsible for multiple health problems. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has only found a verifiable connection between ethoxyquin and buildup of protoporphyrin IX in the liver, as well as elevations in liver- related enzymes in some animals, but no health consequences from these effects are known. In 1997, the Center for Veterinary Medicine asked pet food manufacturers to voluntarily limit ethoxyquin levels to 75 ppm until further evidence is reported. However, most pet foods that contain ethoxyquin have never exceeded this amount. In 2017, reports from the Swiss Department for regional affairs laboratory, service of consummation and veterinary affairs showed that farmed salmon often exceeded the set limits for ethoxyquin contamination by several orders of magnitude and that health effects of the chemical on the human body were not studied in sufficient detail. In 2013, researchers at the Department of General Genetics, Molecular Biology and Plant Biotechnology, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Poland, summarized the health effects of animals and humans exposed to varying levels of ethoxyquin observed in scientific studies. The summary includes: loss of weight, changes in liver, kidney, alimentary duct, urinary bladder and mitochondria, anemia, lethargy, discolored urine, skin, or fur, increase in mortality, detrimental effect on immunity, condition factor of final body weight in relation to body length of fish and inducement of allergies (contact exposure). =2015 EFSA review= A 2015 review by the European Food Safety Authority indicated that data to assess the safety of ethoxyquin as a feed additive for target animals, or its safety for consumers and the environment are lacking. The agency found one of its metabolites, ethoxyquin quinone imine, to be possibly genotoxic, and p-phenetidine, an impurity that could be present from the manufacturing process, to be possibly mutagenic. In response, feed manufacturers have taken steps to significantly reduce the amount of p-phenetidine in their products.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on August 10, 2003. The episode was written by Ken Keeler and directed by Bret Haaland, and it guest stars Dan Castellaneta, who reprises his role as the Robot Devil. Keeler was nominated for an Emmy Award for this episode, while the song \\"I Want My Hands Back\\" was nominated for an Annie Award. Set in a retro-futuristic 31st century, the series follows the adventures of the employees of Planet Express, an interplanetary delivery company. In this episode, Fry makes a deal to swap hands with the Robot Devil so he can better play the holophonor, an instrument he believes can help him express his true feelings for Leela. The episode contains several cultural references and it was well received by critics. At the time, this episode was the series finale, as Fox had not renewed the series for any further seasons. The episode was produced with this in mind and as such, it contains references to the series' ending and almost all of the series' recurring characters were added into the episode. However, the show returned on March 23, 2008, for a fifth season that consisted of four direct-to-DVD films. Seasons six and seven were then produced for Comedy Central before the series ended for a second time on September 4, 2013. Plot Bender discovers that Fry is attempting to play the holophonor so he can woo Leela. After a disastrous recital, Bender recommends Fry enlist the help of the Robot Devil to improve his holophonor skills. The Robot Devil strikes a deal with Fry to trade hands with any robot in the world. The Robot Devil uses a carnival wheel to select which hands Fry would trade with. It stops on the Robot Devil himself, much to his disbelief and horror. With his new, nimble hands, Fry becomes a skilled holophonor virtuoso. He is commissioned by Hedonismbot to write an opera. Fry, in an attempt to win Leela's heart, bases the opera on her life. Upset at getting the raw end of the deal, the Robot Devil decides he has to get his own hands back. He begs Fry, but Fry refuses, reminding him they made a deal. The Robot Devil tries to make a deal with Bender for his hands. When Bender refuses, the Robot Devil then makes another deal, in which he trades Bender a stadium air horn for his \\"crotch-plate\\" so that he can annoy people. When Bender uses the air horn on Leela, it causes her to go deaf. Leela refuses to tell Fry, afraid that Fry will stop writing the opera, so she attends the premiere pretending she can still hear the performance. During the intermission, the Robot Devil offers Leela robotic ears in exchange for one of her hands at a time of his choosing. Desperate to hear the opera, Leela accepts the offer. After the opera insults the Robot Devil, he interrupts and demands that Fry give him back his hands. When Fry refuses, the Robot Devil says that he will take Leela's hand in marriage. Fry decides that he has no choice but to trade the Robot Devil's hands back for his own. Because Fry can now no longer play so expertly, the entire audience storms out sans the sympathetic Leela, who requests that he finish as she wants to know how \\"it\\" ends. Playing an improvised finale, Fry produces crude, cartoonish images of himself and Leela. To a simplistic yet sweet bansuri tune, the created Fry and Leela kiss and then walk into the distance hand-in-hand. Production While this episode may not have been conceived as the final episode of the series, the production crew did include references to the series' likely ending, as the show had not been renewed by the end of production. The episode's opening subtitle was \\"See You On Some Other Channel\\", referring to the broadcast syndication that many shows enter after cancellation as this was the last episode at the time of production. That fall, the series aired on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim block, running until the end of 2007, and was bought by Comedy Central to air in 2008. New episodes started airing in 2010. Because this episode was being produced with the thought that it could be the final episode of the series, there was a concerted effort to include the entire cast of the show, and most of its recurring characters. Due to the ending of the series, and the loss of Katey Sagal's co-star John Ritter on and Katey Sagal on another show on which she was starring at the time, 8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter, there was difficulty in recording the final line of the episode, which is uttered by Sagal: \\"I want to hear how it ends\\". In the audio commentary, it is stated that it took nearly six months to record the line. Cultural references According to David X. Cohen, the episode's title comes from the saying \\"Idle hands are the Devil's playthings\\". In keeping with the episode's focus on classical music (opera in particular), the plot is loosely based on the story of Faust. The Holophonor was inspired by the Visi-Sonor, an instrument played by the Mule in Isaac Asimov's Foundation and Empire. In Robot Hell, the Robot Devil plays an iteration of \\"The Devil Went Down to Georgia\\" by The Charlie Daniels Band. Broadcast and reception Writer Ken Keeler was nominated for an Emmy Award in 2004 for \\"Outstanding Music and Lyrics\\" for the song \\"I Want My Hands Back\\" and for an Annie Award for \\"Music in an Animated Television Production\\". The episode was ranked number 16 on IGN's list of the top 25 Futurama episodes in 2006. Science Fiction Weekly rated the episode as their \\"A Pick\\" for its original airing in 2003, calling the episode a \\"superbly funny ending to the series\\". Dan Castellaneta's performance as the Robot Devil in this episode along with the episode \\"Hell Is Other Robots\\" has been described as a \\"bravura appearance\\". The episode was called an \\"instant classic\\" by a reviewer for the Asia Africa Intelligence Wire. In 2013, it was ranked number 2 \\"as voted on by fans\\" for Comedy Central's \\"Futurama Fanarama\\" marathon. References External links The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings at The Infosphere.

McCalla co-starred with actor Chris Drake. McCalla was also a \\"Vargas Girl\\" model for pin-up girl artist Alberto Vargas. Biography =Early life= Born in Pawnee City, Nebraska, she was one of eight siblings born to Lloyd, a butcher, and Nettie (n√©e Geiger) McCalla. The family moved often, settling in Des Moines, Iowa, in late 1939, when Lloyd began working for Condon Bros. meat dealers. The family lived at 1070 10th Street. The family moved to Marshalltown, Iowa, in November 1941, and to Omaha, Nebraska in September 1942, before returning to Pawnee City, where she completed high school. At age 17, she joined some of her siblings in Southern California, where she worked as a waitress and at an aircraft factory. In 1951, she married insurance salesman Patrick McIntyre, with whom she had two sons. McCalla was already a popular pinup model by 1952, when several other models and she appeared in the film River Goddesses, comprising voluptuous young women frolicking in Glen Canyon. Sheena McCalla publicity still, costumed for her most famous role McCalla recalled being discovered by a Nassour Studios representative while throwing a bamboo spear on a Malibu, California, beach, adding of her Sheena experience, \\"I couldn't act, but I could swing through the trees\\". Her 26-episode series aired in first-run syndication from 1955-56. The athletic McCalla said she performed her own stunts on the series, filmed in Mexico, until the day she grabbed an unsecured vine and slammed into a tree, breaking her arm. Her elder son, Kim McIntyre, once told the press he remembered watching his mother swinging from vine to vine and wrestling mechanical alligators. Following the one-season Sheena, McCalla appeared in five films from 1958 to 1962, and guest roles on the TV series Have Gun ‚Äî Will Travel and Route 66. =Later life and art career= McCalla and McIntyre divorced in 1957, and the following year, McCalla married English actor and James Joyce/Sherlock Holmes scholar Patrick Horgan. They divorced in January 1969. In 1982, McCalla, then living in Malibu, California, married Chuck Rowland, a national sales manager for an auto-glass firm, and moved with him to Prescott, Arizona, where she lived out her days. They separated in 1989. As an artist, she drew numerous oil paintings and collector plates, and sold prints of her work. She was a member of Woman Artists of the American West, and her work has been displayed at the Los Angeles Museum of Arts and Sciences. She made personal appearances at autograph conventions, appearing as late as 1996 in a faux-leopard Sheena costume. Death At age 73 in 2002, Irish McCalla died of a stroke and complications from her fourth brain tumor. She was survived by two sons, Kim and Sean McIntyre. Legacy * McCalla has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, at 1722 Vine Street. * As one writer described the effect of McCalla's signature character on girls growing up in that era, \\"Sheena was the only female portrayed on the tube who didn't conform to the fifties stereotype. Sheena was a real rugged individualist. Watching her struggle with a new adventure every week made me feel more capable at a time when everything was so unexplored. If she could handle the jungle, I felt sure that I could handle my world\\". * Asteroid 83464 Irishmccalla, discovered by astronomer Roy A. Tucker in 2001, was named in her memory.

The song was introduced in the Broadway production by Dorothy Sarnoff in the role of Lady Thiang, the King's head wife. In the 1956 film adaptation \\"Something Wonderful\\" was sung by Terry Saunders in the role of Lady Thiang: Saunders was the understudy for Sarnoff in the Broadway production and in 1952 had taken over the role when Sarnoff departed. \\"Something Wonderful\\" is sung by Lady Thiang to Anna Leonowens to persuade her to accept the King for what he is, despite his faults. In a sense, these lyrics have echoes of the song \\"What's the Use of Wond'rin'\\" from the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical Carousel, which also deals with the issue of women standing by their husbands despite all their faults. Musically, the heavy chords that punctuate the accompaniment bear some pre-echoes of the song \\"Climb Ev'ry Mountain\\" from The Sound of Music. This is notable because both these songs are inspirational songs sung by the earth-mother characters, who have similar singing voices. Both songs are also the last songs heard in their respective shows, even though \\"Something Wonderful\\" is played as an instrumental rendition to underscore the final scene of the King at his deathbed. In the film version of The King and I an unseen chorus sings the final verse of \\"Something Wonderful\\" as the film concludes.

She played a distant role in the 6 June 1862 naval action off Memphis, Tennessee, and subsequently took part in operations in the Yazoo River and in the Vicksburg Campaign. On 25 March 1863, while commanded by Colonel Charles Rivers Ellet, Switzerland joined the ram in an attempt to pass the Vicksburg fortress. Both ships were heavily hit by Confederate gunfire, with Lancaster being sunk. Despite her damage, Switzerland survived the trip and made a subsequent successful passage of the fortifications at Grand Gulf, Mississippi, on 31 March. She took part in operations on the Red and Atchafalaya rivers in May and June 1863. Later in the war, Switzerland was part of the Mississippi Marine Brigade. She was sold in October 1865 and was employed as a merchant steamer under the same name until about 1870. Switzerland was never commissioned as a Navy vessel.

Wilson was born in 1888 in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, to Robert and Lila Bryant. She moved to England with her father in 1890 following the death of her mother. In 1898, after the death of her father, she was taken to live with her maternal grandmother, Annie Malkin in Vancouver, British Columbia. She received her teacher's certificate in 1907, and for thirteen years taught in Vancouver elementary schools. In 1921 she married Wallace Wilson, President of the Canadian Medical Association and professor of medical ethics at the University of British Columbia. In 1980 she was hospitalized and suffering from a series of small strokes. The day before she died, she was in physical distress from passing a kidney stone. A doctor injected her with medication to ease the pain.  Writing career  In the 1930s Wilson published a few short stories and began a series of fictionalized family reminiscences which were later published as The Innocent Traveller (1949). Her first published novel, Hetty Dorval, appeared in 1947, and was followed, seven years later by Swamp Angel (1954), generally thought of as her most accomplished work. Her final book was Mrs Golightly and Other Stories (1961). Wilson is known as one of the first Canadian writers to truly capture the beauty of BC. She wrote often of places in BC that were important to her and was able to detail the ruggedness and magic of the landscape. Yet in 1958 at the University of British Columbia, in a talk entitled \\"An Approach to Some Novels,\\" Wilson stated that there was no school of 'Canadian novel-writing,' nor was one necessary. In her opinion, there were novels written in Canada by Canadians, but these were written with no prescribed formula for what would make a 'Canadian novel.' While Wilson was not overly patriotic in her writing, she did find environment to be very important to her characters. In fact, the connection to place is central in her writings to exploring relationships and the way people react to life. Wilson's characters are observed in relation to the environment. In Love and Salt Water, she states that \\"the formidable power of geography determines the character and performance of a people.\\" Wilson is the subject of one work of criticism, Ethel Wilson by Desmond Pacey, and two biographies, The Other Side of Silence: A Life of Ethel Wilson by Mary McAlpine and Ethel Wilson: A Critical Biography.

It was originally named Lancaster Number 3 then Kosciusko. In March through May 1862, she was purchased and converted to a ram by Colonel Charles Ellet Jr. to serve during the American Civil War as part of the United States Ram Fleet and the Mississippi Marine Brigade. Battle of Memphis After fitting out, she steamed down the Ohio river to join the United States Ram Fleet being organizing to counter Confederate rams in the Mississippi River. On 10 May the Confederate ram flotilla, known as the River Defense Fleet, attacked Union gunboats and mortar schooners at Plum Point Bend, Tennessee, sinking and forcing aground. A fortnight later all but one of the rams had joined the Union flotilla above Fort Pillow ready for action. As the ram fleet and western flotilla prepared to attack, General Henry Wager Halleck's capture of Corinth, Mississippi on 30 May, cut the railway lines which supported the Confederate positions at Forts Pillow and Randolph forcing the South to abandon these river strongholds. The Confederacy charged its River Defense Fleet with the task of stemming the Union advance down the Mississippi. The South's strategy called for a naval stand at Memphis, Tennessee. On the evening of 6 June, Flag Officer Charles Henry Davis arrived above the city with his ironclads. Before dawn the next morning the Union ships raised their anchors and dropped downstream by their sterns. Half an hour later the Confederate rams got underway from the Memphis levee and opened fire, beginning the Battle of Memphis. At this point Colonel Ellet ordered his rams to steam through the line of Flag Officer Davis' slower ironclads and run down the Confederate steamers. His flagship headed straight for , the leading southern ram. A moment before the two ships crashed, one of Colonel Lovells engines failed causing her to veer. The Union ram's reinforced prow smashed into Colonel Lovells side ripping a fatal hole in her side. When Queen of the West pulled free from Lovell she ran aground on the Arkansas shore. Meanwhile, Union ram crashed into foundering Colonel Lovell with a second blow which sent her to the river bottom with all but five of her crew. By then Davis' ironclads had steamed within easy range of the southern ships and began to score with the effective fire. In the ensuing close action, the Confederate River Defense Fleet was destroyed; all of its ships, except , were either captured, sunk, or grounded to avoid capture. Memphis surrendered to Flag Officer Davis. Battle of Vicksburg Ellet's rams on the Mississippi, Lancaster on the far left, circa 1860 On 19 June Lancaster and four sister rams got underway downstream from Memphis. Two days later she captured and sank a ferryboat used to transport Confederate troops from the West across the Mississippi. A week later, after the rams had moved down the river to a point just above Vicksburg, Mississippi, Ellet sent a party across the peninsula, formed by a bend in the river opposite the hillside town, to tell David Farragut, just below the fortress, that the Union had won control of the upper Mississippi. Farragut ran the gauntlet past Vicksburg's guns 28 June, and Flag Officer Davis joined him above the city with the western flotilla 1 July. During the coming months, Lancaster and her sisters of the ram fleet worked tirelessly to take Vicksburg. On 15 July Confederate ironclad ram raced down the Yazoo River and fought through the combined Union squadrons to shelter under the guns at Vicksburg. At the first sight of Arkansas, Lancaster cut her line; dropped down with the current; and strained to build up sufficient steam pressure to ram the southern ship. As her speed increased, Lancaster headed straight for Arkansas; but when she was a mere 100 yards from her quarry, a broadside from the ironclad opened up her steam lines and made her unmanageable. As Lancaster drifted downstream, Queen of the West caught her and towed her to safety. The following day ram came alongside and took Lancaster to Memphis for repairs. The sinking of Lancaster After she was back in fighting shape, the ram resumed operations on the Mississippi towing other ships against the swift current, performing reconnaissance work, and escorting Union supply ships and transports up and down the river. This vital task of protecting General Ulysses S. Grant's logistic lines was necessitated by stepped-up southern guerrilla activity and cavalry raids along the river banks. In mid-March 1863, Farragut returned to the river and managed to run two of his ships upstream past southern batteries at Port Hudson to blockade the mouth of the Red River which the Confederacy had used to funnel supplies and men from the West to Jefferson Davis‚Äô armies east of the Mississippi. He then requested Rear Admiral David Dixon Porter to send him reinforcements from the Western Flotilla to help with the task. In the wee hours of 25 March, two of Ellet's rams, and Lancaster, prepared to answer the call. They came within range of the hostile hillside guns just as the still hidden sun began to lighten the sky‚Äôs midnight blue. Bright flashes burst along the hilltops as Confederate cannon lashed out at the rams. A shell exploded in Lancasters steam drum and then a solid shot plunged into her stern and tore a great hole in her bottom. As the muddy Mississippi poured into her hull, Lancasters commander, Lieutenant Colonel John A. Ellet, ordered her crew to abandon the ship, and the ram sank hard by the bow.

K. Rowling. For members of the Order of the Phoenix, Dumbledore's Army, Hogwarts staff, Ministry of Magic, or for Death Eaters, see the respective articles. The Dursleys The Dursley family are Harry Potter's last living relatives. To ensure Harry's safety, Albus Dumbledore placed him in the Dursleys' care when he was a baby. The Dursleys live at Number 4, Privet Drive, Little Whinging in Surrey, England. They are all Muggles, and despise all things related to magic - and anything out of the ordinary in general - and the Wizarding World, especially the Potters. =Vernon Dursley= Vernon Dursley is Harry's uncle, having married his aunt Petunia. Vernon is described as a big, beefy man, looking somewhat like a walrus, with hardly any neck, and a large moustache. He is very much the head of his family, laying down most of the rules for Harry and doing most of the threatening, as well as spoiling Dudley. He is also the director of a drill-making firm, Grunnings, and seems to be quite successful in his career. He regularly reads the Daily Mail. Uncle Vernon and his wife have grudgingly raised Harry from an early age. He and Petunia were often hostile to Harry and never informed him about the magical world, including how his parents died; instead explaining it away as a car crash. Vernon detests Harry to the degree of locking him up as a form of punishment. During the summer of Harry's second year of Hogwarts, Vernon puts bars on Harry's window to keep him at 4 Privet Drive. His plan is soon thwarted by the Weasleys, who rescue Harry in their father's flying car. Vernon also has an aversion to imagination, to any references to magic, and anything out of the ordinary. When the Dursleys decide to leave Privet Drive to go into hiding, Vernon nearly shakes Harry's hand good-bye, though he ultimately does not bring himself to do it. In the film adaptation, he leaves without even a word to Harry although a deleted scene showing Dudley and Harry's reconciliation shows him saying \\"This is farewell\\". Vernon is portrayed by Richard Griffiths in the films. =Petunia Dursley= Petunia Dursley is Harry's maternal aunt, Lily Potter's older sister, Vernon's wife, Dudley's mother, Marge's sister-in-law. She is described as a bony woman with blonde hair that she passed down to her son, a \\"rather horsey\\" face and a very long neck, and spends most of her time spying on her neighbours. Her eyes are large and pale, quite unlike Lily's. Her entire family, except Lily, is made up of Muggles. According to Petunia, her parents were proud of having a witch in the family, but Petunia saw her sister as a freak. In fact, Petunia was envious and resentful of Lily's magical abilities and went so far as to write to Dumbledore, pleading to be allowed to enter Hogwarts. Dumbledore gently denied her enrolment. Afterwards, Petunia grew bitter towards the school and, by extension, towards the wizarding world in general. Petunia has more knowledge of the wizarding world than she is initially willing to admit. After the Dementors attack Harry and Dudley, Petunia states that she knows Dementors guard the wizard prison, Azkaban. When Harry and the rest of her family look at her strangely, she explains that she heard \\"that awful boy\\" telling Lily about them years ago. Harry assumes that the \\"awful boy\\" was his father, James, but in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, he learns via flashback memories that it was actually Severus Snape, who knew both Lily and Petunia when they were children. On one occasion, Petunia, but mostly her husband, almost throws Harry out of their house, but when she receives a Howler from Albus Dumbledore, she decides not to send the boy away due to the agreement she had made with Dumbledore (although she covers by claiming that her decision is based on what the neighbours might think if the Dursleys threw Harry out). Before the Dursleys leave Privet Drive to go into hiding, Petunia almost wishes Harry good luck, suggesting that she does feel a tiny sense of familial attachment to her nephew; however her self-imposed dislike of magic prevents her from doing so, and she leaves without a word. In the film version of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ‚Äì Part 1, she leaves Harry without showing any sentiment; however, in a deleted scene on the Blu-ray/DVD release, Petunia shows acknowledgment of the wizarding world, and ultimately deep sadness and remorse for the loss of her younger sister Lily, reminding Harry that she lost a sister as well. In Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, Petunia Dursley is mentioned as having died a few years after Harry's second son Albus Severus started studying at Hogwarts. Actress Fiona Shaw portrays Petunia in the films, with Ariella Paradise playing her as a child. =Dudley Dursley= Dudley Dursley is the child of Vernon and Petunia Dursley, and Harry's only cousin. Described as a very large, blond boy (though dark-haired in the films), Dudley is given his way in almost everything, and shows the symptoms of a spoiled brat. Dudley is a cold-hearted bully and the leader of a gang of thugs with whom he regularly beats up Harry and younger children on the flimsiest of excuses. For this purpose, he is described early in the first novel as the reason for Harry being friendless before enrolling at Hogwarts, as even though Harry was good at sports and got good grades, he was the favorite victim of Dudley's bullying, rendering classmates too scared to admit to liking him. He is only one month older than Harry, meaning that his birthday must be sometime in late June. The same year Harry starts at Hogwarts, Dudley is enrolled at his father's old private boarding school, Smeltings. In Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Dudley is given a pig's tail by Rubeus Hagrid which has to be removed at a private hospital in London. In Goblet of Fire, the Smeltings school nurse advises the Dursleys to put him on a strict diet. During the summer when this diet is enforced, the Weasleys arrive at Number 4, Privet Drive to pick Harry up for the Quidditch World Cup, and Fred Weasley \\"accidentally\\" drops a Ton-Tongue Toffee, which enlarges Dudley's tongue to four feet long before his hysterical mother reluctantly allows Arthur Weasley to shrink it. By the start of Order of the Phoenix, Dudley has been on his diet for a year, taken up boxing, and become a regional inter-school champion. In the fifth book, two Dementors attack Dudley and Harry in an alley. Dudley collapses, and Harry uses the Patronus to drive a group of Dementors away from himself and his cousin. Mrs. Figg, their neighbour, then comes running in and reveals she is a Squib by talking about Dementors. Harry and Mrs. Figg carry the shaken Dudley home, though Dudley is convinced that Harry made the Dementors appear in the first place. After the confrontation, Harry wonders what sort of bad memories Dudley could have relived, as Dementors force people to relive their worst experiences. Rowling later revealed, in an on-line chat, that Dudley's worst fear was seeing himself for who he really was: a cruel, selfish, violent bully with no feelings whatsoever for others, and this revelation shocked him to the core. The experience gives Dudley a more favourable impression of Harry, as seen in Deathly Hallows, when Dudley is the only member of the family to accept Harry: he shakes his hand and thanks him for saving his soul from the Dementor attack, and shows some concern for him when the Dursleys leave to go into hiding. In his appreciation of his cousin's belated gratitude, Harry says good-bye to him using Dudley's former nickname, \\"Big D\\". In the film version, however, there is no such sentiment as Dudley leaves Harry before he can say any final words; however, on the Blu-ray/DVD release, a deleted scene includes the reconciliation between the two cousins. Rowling revealed on her website that many people have asked her to include an adult Dudley with a wizarding child in the epilogue of Deathly Hallows, and that she herself considered it, but decided upon reflection that any \\"latent wizarding genes would never survive contact with Uncle Vernon's DNA\\" and thus she did not do so. Rowling says that Harry and Dudley would \\"stay on Christmas card\\" terms for the rest of their lives, and that Harry would take his family to visit Dudley's when they were in the neighbourhood, but it was something that James Sirius, Albus Severus and Lily Luna \\"would dread\\". However, Dudley's kids and Harry's occasionally would \\"get together while the adults sat in awkward silence\\". In Harry Potter and the Cursed Child it is also mentioned that adult Dudley sent Harry his baby blanket, the only surviving possession of Harry's from his parents. Dudley is portrayed by Harry Melling in the Harry Potter films. Melling had to wear a fat suit, as he lost a considerable amount of weight as the films progressed. =Marge Dursley= Marjorie Eileen Dursley is Vernon's older sister and described as physically resembling him; a large woman with hardly any neck and even a bit of a moustache, even though it is not as bushy as Vernon's. Though she is not a relative of Harry, he has been forced to call her \\"Aunt Marge\\" throughout his whole life with the Dursleys. Marge lives in the country, where she breeds bulldogs and because of her commitment to her animals, she rarely visits Privet Drive, to Harry's considerable relief. She adores her nephew, Dudley and treats Harry with contempt and cruelty. Though naturally an unpleasant and reprehensible person, Aunt Marge believes that Harry is a horrible boy, owing to Vernon and Petunia's lies, and delights in insulting both him and his dead parents. In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban after she insults Harry's parents, Harry loses his temper and inflates her, thus causing her to blow up like a monstrous balloon and float up to the ceiling. Marge is later rescued, changed back to normal, and the Ministry of Magic modifies her memory, so she would have no recollection of the incident. She also appeared in a memory in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix when Harry is chased up a tree by one of Marge's bulldogs. Pam Ferris appeared as Marge in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, in which she floats out of the house and into the sky after being inflated. Others =Bathilda Bagshot= Bathilda Bagshot is a noted historian in the wizarding world, and author of the book A History of Magic. She lives in the village where Harry was born, Godric's Hollow, and is an old family friend of Dumbledore, as well as being the Potters' neighbour and friend. Gellert Grindelwald is her great-nephew, which is why he comes to live in Godric's Hollow after being expelled from Durmstrang. Bathilda is a major source of information for Rita Skeeter's biography of Dumbledore, who extracts this information under the influence of Veritaserum; it is possible her memory is also modified following the \\"interview.\\"In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Chapter 18, it is revealed that Bathilda Bagshot was sent a copy of The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore accompanied by a note: \\"Dear Batty, Thanks for your help. Here's a copy of the book, hope you like it. You said everything, even if you don't remember it. Rita.\\" Harry decides to go to Godric's Hollow to get information from Bathilda, and because he wants to see his parents' grave. Hermione thinks that Dumbledore might have entrusted her with Gryffindor's Sword. Bathilda dies before Harry's arrival in Godric's Hollow, at the hand of Lord Voldemort, who enchants her decaying body to use as an outer skin for his snake, Nagini to wait for Harry. The snake is then instructed to subdue Harry when he arrives in Bathilda's house looking for the sword until Voldemort himself can get there to finish him off. Hazel Douglas plays Bathilda in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ‚Äì Part 1. =Frank Bryce= Frank Bryce is a reclusive Muggle World War II veteran who works as the caretaker of the Riddle family mansion in Little Hangleton. In 1943, the Riddles were murdered by Tom Riddle (later to become Lord Voldemort), and since Bryce had the keys to the large house where the deaths occurred, he was arrested and questioned in connection with the murders. As there was lack of evidence (because the bodies were unmarked as the Killing Curse leaves no sign of violence or damage on the victims) the police could not prove that the Riddles had been murdered, and were forced to release Bryce. However, the community of Little Hangleton was distrustful of Bryce. As a result, he lived out the rest of his life by himself, living on the grounds of the Riddles' estate, while still tending to the grounds. In the beginning of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Voldemort discreetly returns to the Riddle house. Bryce inadvertently overhears Voldemort's plan to kill Harry, initially thinking that Voldemort and Wormtail are spies, but before he can take action, Nagini reveals his presence to Voldemort, who kills him with the Avada Kedavra curse. He appears once more in the same book, during Harry and Voldemort's graveyard duel. The Priori Incantatem effect brings back an \\"echo\\" of Bryce from the tip of Voldemort's wand. Despite not knowing who he is, Bryce enthusiastically encourages Harry to keep fighting. Dumbledore states his belief in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince that the murder of Bryce was used to create Voldemort's presumably sixth and final Horcrux, implanted in Nagini. However, Rowling later said Voldemort used the earlier murder of Bertha Jorkins for this. Bryce is portrayed by Eric Sykes in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. =Crabbe and Goyle= Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle are Slytherin students in Harry's year; both of their fathers, Crabbe Sr and Goyle Sr, are Death Eaters. Due to their size and strength, the pair act as Draco Malfoy's minions and serve \\"to do Malfoy's bidding\\", especially to intimidate fellow students. Both are entirely lacking in introspection or curiosity, though Crabbe is shown to be significantly smarter than Goyle. They seem unable to make up their own minds or to see things their own way. Crabbe and Goyle make their first appearance as new Slytherin Quidditch Beaters in the opening match against Gryffindor in their fifth year; after Harry catches the Snitch, Crabbe vents his frustration by purposely hitting a Bludger into Harry's back and knocking him off his broom, for which he receives the light punishment of writing lines. They do not return to the team the following year, as they regularly serve as Malfoy's lookouts during his forays into the Room of Requirement. After Malfoy leaves the school following the death of Dumbledore just before the end of the term, Crabbe and Goyle are left in a state of loneliness. The three of them are reunited in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Both of them speak for the first time, Crabbe's voice being described as \\"oddly soft for someone with his huge frame\\" and Goyle's simply as a grunt. Crabbe has sided with the Death Eaters with more conviction than either Goyle or Malfoy, and becomes increasingly independent of Malfoy, well aware of the Malfoy family's falling out of favour with Voldemort. The pair have developed into surprisingly powerful wizards. Crabbe and Goyle are mentioned as having excelled in inflicting the Cruciatus Curse on other pupils who had received detentions under Amycus Carrow's direction: according to Neville Longbottom, it was \\"the first time they were the best in anything\\". During the fight for the Horcrux diadem with Harry, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger in the Room of Requirement, Crabbe defies Malfoy's order to not kill Harry and casually throws around the Avada Kedavra curse. Finally, he summons magical fire and turns the room into a blazing inferno, but it quickly rages beyond his control and leads to his death and the destruction of the Horcrux. Goyle is knocked unconscious during the ensuing fight, but is rescued, along with Draco, by Harry, Ron and Hermione. Jamie Waylett portrayed Crabbe and Joshua Herdman played Goyle in the first six films of the Harry Potter film series; only Herdman appears in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ‚Äì Part 1 and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ‚Äì Part 2, with Crabbe's role in the plot being replaced by Goyle, and Goyle being replaced by Blaise Zabini.Joshua Herdman & Louis Cordice to reprise Goyle and Zabini roles for Deathly Hallows ‚Äì Snitchseeker.com Forums =Gabrielle Delacour= Gabrielle Delacour is the only younger sister of Fleur Delacour. Her age in Goblet of Fire is estimated by Harry to be no more than eight, and this statement is reinforced when it is stated in Deathly Hallows that she is eleven. During the Triwizard Tournament, in which Fleur is the champion for Beauxbatons, Gabrielle along with Ron, Hermione, and Cho Chang is used as underwater \\"bait\\" for the champions to rescue. Unfortunately Fleur does not manage to rescue Gabrielle in time because she is held back by Grindylows and is forced to return to the surface, but Harry goes on to save her as well as his own hostage, Ron. Fleur hints in Half-Blood Prince that Gabrielle has developed a crush on Harry, since she \\"never stops talking\\" about him. Gabrielle and Ginny serve as bridesmaids at Bill Weasley and Fleur's wedding in Deathly Hallows. Her part-Veela heritage begins to develop as she matures and she is nicknamed \\"Fleur in miniature\\". She retains the crush on Harry at that time, causing Ginny to clear her throat loudly in mild jealousy when she throws him a flirtatious look. Gabrielle was portrayed by Angelica Mandy in the film adaptation of Goblet of Fire. Mandy reprised her role for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ‚Äì Part 1, but appeared only in background scenes and was uncredited. =Gellert Grindelwald= Johnny Depp in character as Gellert Grindelwald at San Diego Comic-Con 2018 promoting Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald Gellert Grindelwald () is a dark wizard who, on a list of \\"Most Dangerous Dark Wizards of All Time,\\" would be second only to Voldemort, according to Rita Skeeter's book The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore. His name is first mentioned in Philosopher's Stone on a Chocolate Frog card which notes that Dumbledore defeated Grindelwald in 1945. Grindelwald attended the wizarding school Durmstrang, from which he was expelled at age sixteen for his dangerous and evil experiments that nearly resulted in the deaths of some of his fellow students. He left the symbol of the Deathly Hallows on one of the walls in Durmstrang before departing. After Durmstrang, he went to live with his great- aunt Bathilda Bagshot in Godric's Hollow, where he met the young Dumbledore. In Deathly Hallows, it was revealed that Grindelwald had gone to Godric's Hollow to investigate the grave of the Peverell brothers (the original owners of the Hallows), but struck up a close friendship with Dumbledore, and the two planned to establish a new world order, where wizards would rule over Muggles \\"for the greater good\\". The phrase later became Grindelwald's excuse for the atrocities he committed in his reign of terror. They also planned to work together in their quest for the Hallows. Later Rowling claimed at a Q&A; session that she implied Dumbledore being once in love with Grindelwald, and thus he has 'lost his moral compass,' but she did not say whether those feelings were returned. However, Aberforth Dumbledore, Albus' younger brother, argued against these plans, because he feared their grand ambitions would leave his disabled, traumatised sister, Ariana, abandoned. Later the argument culminated in a three-way duel among Albus, Aberforth, and Grindelwald. Ariana was inadvertently killed by one of them. Grindelwald fled, fearing retribution and Albus ended his friendship with him. Grindelwald became master of one of the Deathly Hallows, the Elder Wand, by stealing it from the previous owner, the wand-maker Gregorovitch. Gaining the Elder Wand's immense power, he subsequently committed many terrible acts, terrorising Europe while avoiding Britain. It is revealed that Grindelwald's actions have caused many deaths that have greatly affected the students of Durmstrang, including Viktor Krum, whose grandfather was murdered by Grindelwald. After Grindelwald's rise to power, Dumbledore delayed meeting him again for several years due to his fear of being confronted with his sister's death and the fact that he himself might have been the one who accidentally killed her. Both wizards were highly intelligent and skilled in battle, and when their battle eventually occurred, those who witnessed it later said that no other wizarding duel ever matched it. Grindelwald, who at the time possessed the supposedly unbeatable Elder Wand, lost to Dumbledore. Since Dumbledore won the duel over Grindelwald, the Elder Wand transferred its allegiance to Dumbledore. After Dumbledore triumphed over Grindelwald, the defeated dark wizard was imprisoned in the top-most cell of Nurmengard. He remained there, growing emaciated and toothless through the ravages of the prison, until Deathly Hallows when Voldemort arrives, seeking the Elder Wand. Grindelwald, showing no fear of Voldemort and welcoming death, tells him that he never owned the wand, and an enraged Voldemort kills him. In the chapter \\"King's Cross\\", Harry suggests to Dumbledore that, by lying to Voldemort to prevent him from breaking into Dumbledore's tomb and taking the Elder Wand, Grindelwald may have been trying to atone for his crimes. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ‚Äì Part 1, young Grindelwald is portrayed by Jamie Campbell Bower while the older Grindelwald is played by Michael Byrne. In the film, unlike in the book, Grindelwald reveals to Voldemort the whereabouts of the Elder Wand. Grindelwald appears in the Fantastic Beasts film series, portrayed by Johnny Depp. In the film series storyline, Grindelwald and Dumbledore have made a blood pact in their youth to never harm each other which Grindelwald sports in a vial while seeking a means to indirectly kill his former friend. This led to him learning of a prophecy involving Dumbledore's assumed dead brother Aurelius. He first appears in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, though he is disguised for most of the story as the American Auror Percival Graves, played by Colin Farrell, while seeking out an Obscurus whom he learned to be Credence Barebone. In Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, Jamie Campbell Bower reprising his younger self, Grindelwald manages to win over Credence to faction while revealing his true identity as Aurelius. =Viktor Krum= Viktor Krum is a Seeker, a prodigy, for the Bulgarian national Quidditch team. He is well coordinated on a broom but slightly unbalanced on land. Though successful, Krum is unhappy and Hermione is one of the few who think him a nice person beneath the sullen exterior. In the Quidditch World Cup title game between Bulgaria and Ireland, he suffers a severe bloody nose during the match and catches the Snitch as quickly as he can to end it, which hands victory to Ireland because Bulgaria was trailing by 160 points at the time. Krum is named Durmstrang champion upon entering his name for the prestigious Triwizard Tournament. He is often viewed with suspicion by his peers due to Durmstrang's reputation for teaching the Dark Arts, while looked upon with admiration for his feats, mainly by giggling Hogwarts girls. Whilst competing in the Triwizard Tournament, he takes to visiting the Hogwarts library to try to talk to Hermione. He eventually gains the courage to ask her to the Yule Ball, a traditional formal dance associated with the Triwizard Tournament. Krum has to rescue her from the merpeople in the Great Lake for the Second Task, revealing his deep affection for her. Immediately afterward, he invited her to stay with him in Bulgaria and stated that he had \\"never felt this way about a girl before.\\" He becomes jealous of Harry when a slanderous news article by Rita Skeeter falsely states that Hermione is toying with both boys' affections, and confronts him about it. When he learns the truth, he and Harry become friendly, shortly before the appearance of a mentally incapacitated Bartemius Crouch Sr. Crouch's disguised son stuns Krum shortly afterward, to murder his father unnoticed. In the climax of the book, Krum, under the influence of an Imperius Curse cast by Barty Crouch Jr, uses the Cruciatus Curse on Cedric Diggory to eliminate any opposition for Harry to win the tournament, but is not arrested nor punished for this, as he was not in control of his own faculties. Krum briefly returns in Deathly Hallows, as a wedding guest of Bill and Fleur. He has a heated discussion with Xenophilius Lovegood, after he recognises a symbol that Xenophilius wears around his neck as the mark of Grindelwald; the symbol is later discovered to be the mark of the Deathly Hallows. His attitude suggests that he wants to get back together with Hermione, and he is disgruntled to see her dancing with Ron. Krum then asked Harry (who was disguised as a Weasley) whether or not Ginny Weasley was single, showing that he had his eye on her too. J.K. Rowling later stated that Krum eventually found love in his native Bulgaria. Stanislav Ianevski portrayed Krum in the film adaptation of Goblet of Fire. He made a brief appearance in Deathly Hallows, but his scenes were cut from the film. =Augusta Longbottom= Augusta Longbottom is Neville's paternal grandmother, introduced in Philosopher's Stone before Neville leaves for Hogwarts. She raised him from a young age after Neville's parents were tortured and permanently incapacitated (using the Cruciatus Curse) by a group of Death Eaters led by Bellatrix Lestrange. Early on, it is established that Neville is terrified of his grandmother, who is a very strict disciplinarian, a perfectionist, a staunch opponent of Voldemort and a no-nonsense witch, especially towards Neville, sometimes complaining he is not as gifted a wizard as his father. In Order of the Phoenix, Neville discloses that his grandmother fully supports Harry and Dumbledore's proclamations that Voldemort had returned, even going so far as to cancel her subscription to the Daily Prophet, because they keep toeing the Ministry of Magic line that Harry was lying. Later, Harry and his friends are visiting Arthur Weasley in St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries and meet Augusta and Neville who are visiting Frank and Alice (Neville's parents); Augusta explains to Harry's friends how Neville's parents got into that state. She reprimands Neville for failing to have already told his friends what happened to his parents, saying he should be \\"proud\\" to be their son for their bravery. In Half-Blood Prince, Augusta wants Neville to continue studying Transfiguration instead of Charms, which she considers a soft option. It is revealed by Minerva McGonagall that Augusta thinks like this because she failed her Charms O.W.L. McGonagall also writes a letter to Augusta telling her it's time that she \\"learned to be proud of the grandson she's got, rather than the one she thinks she ought to have\\"., chapter 9 Deathly Hallows is a definite turning point for the relationship between Augusta and her grandson. Towards the climax of the book, it is revealed that the Death Eaters targeted Augusta when Neville began acting as leader of the reformed Dumbledore's Army. The Ministry official John Dawlish is sent to arrest her; according to Neville, he was expecting an old woman living alone to be an easy target. However, the implications are that Augusta is actually an extremely capable witch, easily overpowering Dawlish and evading capture by the Death Eaters. She sends Neville an encouraging letter, which he keeps by his heart. Augusta arrives at the Battle of Hogwarts to assist her grandson. Bolstered by Neville's leadership of the D.A. during his seventh year at Hogwarts, Augusta ultimately becomes extremely proud of him. In the 2006 skit for the Children's Party at the Palace, it is revealed Augusta keeps a mousetrap in her bag. Neville explains that his grandfather placed a Fanged Gerbil in Augusta's bag in 1947, believing it would be funny. Augusta didn't agree with this, particularly after the gerbil bit her, and placed a mousetrap in her bag to prevent a repeat of this happening again. Augusta is portrayed by Leila Hoffman in the first film, appearing only in the background escorting Neville to the Hogwarts Express. =Xenophilius Lovegood= Xenophilius Lovegood is Pandora Lovegood's husband, Luna Lovegood's father, and the editor of The Quibbler, a magazine that often publishes stories about wild conspiracy theories or research on seemingly non- existent creatures. In Greek, his name means \\"one who likes that which is strange\\" (xeno meaning \\"strange\\" and philo meaning \\"liking\\" or \\"fondness\\"). He is introduced in Deathly Hallows as a guest at the wedding of Fleur Delacour and Bill Weasley, and is said to be a friend. He is described as eccentric looking, being slightly cross-eyed, with shoulder-length white hair the texture of candyfloss and wearing garishly coloured robes. Xenophilius wears the symbol of the Deathly Hallows around his neck as a way of showing his willingness to help other believers in the Hallows in their quest to obtain them. Later in the story, he explains to Harry, Ron, and Hermione the significance of the Deathly Hallows. Although initially one of the staunchest supporters of the anti-Voldemort, pro-Harry Potter movement through his magazine, Xenophilius later betrays the trio's location to the Death Eater- controlled Ministry of Magic in a bid to ensure the safe return of his kidnapped daughter. After an ensuing battle with Xenophilius and the Death Eaters, the trio escape and the Death Eaters arrest Xenophilius, which saves his reputation, as he is mentioned on the clandestine \\"Potterwatch\\" radio broadcast as a persecuted anti-Voldemort dissident, and the issue of The Quibbler in which he attacks Harry is buried under the ruins of his home and never distributed. Harry, Ron, and Hermione never reveal his attempted betrayal, which was motivated solely by fear for Luna's life. Welsh actor and singer Rhys Ifans portrays Xenophilius in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ‚Äì Part 1. =Teddy Lupin= Edward Remus \\"Teddy\\" Lupin is the orphaned only son of Remus Lupin and Nymphadora Tonks and godson of Harry Potter. He is named after Tonks' late father, Ted Tonks, and his own father, Remus. Teddy is a Metamorphmagus like his mother Nymphadora, and is not affected by his father's lycanthropy. He is mentioned in the final chapter of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows by Harry, who says that Teddy \\"comes round to dinner about four times a week\\". =Narcissa Malfoy= Narcissa Malfoy, born Narcissa Black to Cygnus Black III and Druella Rosier, is the youngest of three sisters, her older sisters being Bellatrix Lestrange and Andromeda Tonks. She is a cousin of Sirius and Regulus Black and an aunt to Nymphadora Tonks, Andromeda's daughter. Narcissa attended Hogwarts, where she was in Slytherin. She later married Lucius Malfoy, with whom she has one son, Draco, of whom she is extremely protective. Narcissa is first described as a tall, slim blonde who would have been attractive if not for \\"a look that suggested there was a nasty smell under her nose\\". Although Narcissa certainly seems to share the Blacks' and her husband's views on blood purity on the outside, her actions indicate she is far more concerned about the welfare of her family than helping Voldemort. Although Narcissa makes her first, very brief appearance in Goblet of Fire, where she attends the Quidditch World Cup with her husband and son, her role in the series first becomes important in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. At the beginning of the book, Narcissa and Bellatrix arrive suddenly at Snape's home. Narcissa is distraught, almost hysterical, with her husband imprisoned in Azkaban and her son forced to accept a difficult and dangerous assignment by Voldemort. She begs Snape to help Draco and asks him to make an Unbreakable Vow, to which he agrees. Narcissa also appears later in the novel, shopping with Draco for his new robes at Madam Malkin's. She and Draco bump into Harry, Ron and Hermione. Harry taunts Narcissa for her husband being sent to Azkaban, and in turn, she mocks his dead godfather, Sirius Black. Narcissa also says that \\"Harry will be reunited with dear Sirius before I am reunited with Lucius\\", showing that she believes Harry to die soon. Draco defuses the situation by leaving with his mother. In Deathly Hallows, Narcissa's home is being used (against her will) as the Headquarters for Voldemort and his Death Eaters and for confining several prisoners, including eventually, Harry, Ron, and Hermione. When this group escapes with the help of Dobby, Voldemort places Narcissa and her family under house arrest. In the climax of the book, the Malfoys are brought with the other Death Eaters to Hogwarts, when Voldemort invades the castle. When Voldemort casts a Killing Curse on Harry, Narcissa is ordered to verify his death. When she feels Harry's heart beating, she quietly asks him whether Draco is still alive at Hogwarts, a fact that Harry confirms. Knowing that she will not be free to search for her son unless she can return with the Death Eaters as part of a \\"conquering army\\", Narcissa lies to Voldemort and declares Harry to be dead. She is later seen at the end of the book, with her husband and son, unsure what to do and how to behave amidst the celebration of Voldemort's death. However, thanks to her lie to Voldemort, the Malfoys manage to avoid imprisonment in Azkaban. In the film series, Narcissa shows very little to no animosity towards Harry personally, only dueling him after he attacks Draco during the Battle of Malfoy Manor. Narcissa's question to Harry and subsequent lie to Voldemort are preserved in the film. Narcissa's reaction to the final battle is changed dramatically: she utterly ignores it, literally turning her back on the situation and taking Draco with her, with Lucius following after a moment. Narcissa is portrayed by Helen McCrory in the film series. McCrory was initially cast as Bellatrix Lestrange, but withdrew due to pregnancy; the role of Bellatrix went to Helena Bonham Carter. =Olympe Maxime= Madame Olympe Maxime is the headmistress of Beauxbatons, the French wizarding school. The character is introduced in Goblet of Fire when her school is invited to the Triwizard Tournament, with Fleur Delacour being elected as Beauxbatons' champion. When Harry is chosen as the fourth champion and second Hogwarts champion, she is angered and is about to leave the tournament, but she eventually agrees to stay. In Goblet of Fire, she is described as being elegant and wearing black satin robes, and having olive skin and handsome features, but being extremely tall. It is revealed that Madame Maxime's huge size is due to her half-giant background. She fiercely denies this, although she is around the same height as fellow half-giant Rubeus Hagrid. Upon first sight, Hagrid immediately takes a fancy to Madame Maxime, which he shows by attempting to groom himself properly and wearing his hairy brown suit when she is around. In Order of the Phoenix, Hagrid tells Harry, Ron, and Hermione that he and Madame Maxime visited the giants during that summer to get them on to the Order of the Phoenix's side. Unfortunately, they failed in their mission, because Voldemort also sent a group of Death Eaters to address the giants. When giants attack Hagrid, Madame Maxime defended him by using a conjunctivitis curse. Hagrid describes her spell work as \\"brilliant\\". She separates from Hagrid during the return journey, however, because he would not abandon his giant half-brother Grawp, who proves to be a highly taxing travelling companion. She returns to Beauxbatons alone. In Half- Blood Prince, Madame Maxime is among those paying respects at Dumbledore's funeral. Her last appearance is in Deathly Hallows, where she attends the wedding of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour. Frances de la Tour appeared as Madame Maxime in Goblet of Fire, and reprised the role in Deathly Hallows. =Cormac McLaggen= Cormac McLaggen is a Gryffindor student one year above Harry. He is introduced during the train journey to Hogwarts in Half-Blood Prince as a member of Horace Slughorn's Slug Club due to his uncle's close ties with the Ministry of Magic. Cormac is depicted as unsympathetic, and his Gryffindor bravery is both a strength and a flaw: he is foolhardy and proud, bordering on arrogant. Cormac goes up against Ron in trying out for the position of Keeper on the Quidditch team when Harry becomes captain, but Hermione secretly jinxes him with the Confundus Charm, causing him to miss his last save and thus helping Ron retain his spot. He starts Gryffindor's match against Hufflepuff after Ron is unable to play due to poisoning, but his debut is disastrous as he orders the team about instead of focusing on his own position, knocks Harry unconscious with a Bludger, and contributes to Gryffindor's lopsided 320‚Äì60 loss, thus earning him universal dislike among his housemates. He briefly becomes a pawn in the escalating tensions between Ron and Hermione, when Hermione invites him to Slughorn's Christmas party as her date, in retaliation for Ron's relationship with Lavender Brown. The plan backfires when she becomes exasperated with McLaggen's arrogant behaviour, and she leaves him stranded under the mistletoe and avoids him for the remainder of the party. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ‚Äì Part 1, Cormac is seen on the Hogwarts Express, and in Part 2 he is seen participating in, and surviving, the Battle of Hogwarts. Freddie Stroma played McLaggen in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ‚Äì Part 1 and Part 2. =Auntie Muriel= Muriel is a great-aunt of the Weasley children (on Molly's side). According to Ron, she is rude to just about everyone she meets. Harry first meets her in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows during Bill and Fleur's wedding. She is described as having bloodshot eyes and a large, feathery pink hat, making her look like a \\"badly tempered flamingo\\". She lends her beautiful goblin-made tiara to Fleur for the wedding. During the wedding, she starts an argument with Elphias Doge about Dumbledore's past and Rita Skeeter's The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore. In spite of her dislike for the late Dumbledore, Muriel offers support to the Order of the Phoenix, providing her house in The Deathly Hallows for Harry when the Order removes him from the safety of the Dursleys'. Later in the book, most of the Weasleys and several others hide in her house because they are targeted as blood traitors or Mudbloods. Matyelok Gibbs appears as Muriel in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ‚Äì Part 1, but during the film she is never identified. =Moaning Myrtle= Moaning Myrtle (born Myrtle Elizabeth Warren) is a ghost that haunts the first-floor girls' lavatory at Hogwarts. True to her nickname, she has a tendency to moan, sob, whine, wail and complain, especially upon the mention of death. Her constant moping and wailing causes plumbing problems in the lavatory she haunts. In Chamber of Secrets, it is established that the character is the ghost of a Muggle-born witch who died while a student at Hogwarts, fifty years before the events in the book. Myrtle was hiding in the first floor girls' lavatory to elude Olive Hornby, a classmate who perpetually tormented her about her glasses, when the Chamber of Secrets was opened and the basilisk emerged and killed her. Tom Riddle used her death to create his second Horcrux: his diary. After death, Myrtle haunted Olive everywhere she went, until Olive complained to the Ministry of Magic, which ordered Myrtle to return to Hogwarts. Myrtle has since sulkily haunted the same lavatory where she died, but despite her miserable disposition, she is often flirtatious with Harry. Myrtle assists Harry with his second task in the Triwizard Tournament in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. She tells Harry how to solve the puzzle of the golden egg that he retrieved in the first task, by opening it underwater. She is more upbeat and mischievous, and enjoys having Harry briefly to herself to boss around. He later meets her in the lake where she directs him to the merpeople's village. In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, she comforts Malfoy, who is worried about the task Voldemort has assigned him. After Harry near-fatally injures Malfoy with a Sectumsempra spell during a duel, Myrtle quickly spreads the news by screaming, \\"Murder! Murder in the bathroom!\\" Rowling revealed on her website that Myrtle was in Ravenclaw House and that her full name was Myrtle Elizabeth Warren. She added that the inspiration for the character was \\"the frequent presence of a crying girl in communal bathrooms, especially at the parties and discos of my youth.\\" Shirley Henderson plays Myrtle in the film versions of Chamber of Secrets and Goblet of Fire. The character was omitted from Half-Blood Prince. =Garrick Ollivander= Garrick Ollivander is the proprietor of Ollivanders, a prestigious shop which sells magical wands in Diagon Alley. Although Ollivander is generally presented as a genial elderly man, Harry is unnerved the first two times he meets him in the series because the wandmaker appears to admire what Voldemort could do with his original wand and, later, the Elder Wand. Despite his wands' popularity, he can easily remember the materials and attributes of every wand he has ever sold, as well as its owner. In Philosopher's Stone, Ollivander assists 11-year-old Harry in selecting his first wand. Finding Harry a particularly difficult customer to match, Ollivander finally selects an eleven-inch-long wand made of holly containing a phoenix feather (later revealed to have come from Dumbledore's phoenix, Fawkes), which is perfectly suited to Harry. Ollivander is intrigued that this particular wand would suit Harry, and reveals that Fawkes contributed only one other feather, to the wand being used by Voldemort. Ollivander appears in Goblet of Fire during the preliminary ceremonies of the Triwizard Tournament, where he acts as an expert judge for the Weighing of the Wands. In Half-Blood Prince, his shop has closed and is boarded up, and Ollivander himself is missing. The opening scene of the Half-Blood Prince film shows Mr Ollivander hooded and forcibly seized from his shop by three Death Eaters. In Deathly Hallows, Ollivander has been captured by Voldemort and imprisoned at Malfoy Manor with Luna, with whom he develops an affectionate relationship as the two strive to keep each other's spirits up. He is among those rescued from the manor by Dobby, after which, at Shell Cottage, he provides Harry and his friends with some useful information about the Elder Wand. He later goes into hiding at the home of Auntie Muriel and sends Luna a new wand as a gift. British actor John Hurt appeared as Ollivander in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone and reprised his role in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ‚Äì Part 1 and Part 2. His first name was revealed in Pottermore. It was also revealed that he is married and has a son and a daughter (the latter deceased). Some of the names of his wandmaker ancestors were also revealed: Geraint Ollivander (ancestor), Gerbold Octavius Ollivander (paternal grandfather), Gervaise Ollivander (father). =Pansy Parkinson= Pansy Parkinson is a Slytherin student who is described as pug- faced and frequently seen with an unnamed gang of Slytherin girls, acting as their leader, or at least spokeswoman. She is first mentioned in the Sorting in Philosopher's Stone, and makes her first appearance in Madam Hooch's flying class, during which she teases Parvati Patil for defending Neville Longbottom after Draco steals Longbottom's Remembrall. In Prisoner of Azkaban, she cries and follows Malfoy to the hospital wing after he is attacked by Buckbeak, and continues to fawn over him despite his deliberate exaggeration of the extent of his injury. They attended the Yule Ball together in Goblet of Fire. Throughout the series, Pansy regularly mocks Harry and his companions. She gives false information on Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid to Rita Skeeter, and openly voices criticisms of Hagrid to Umbridge in terms of her displeasure about his Care of Magical Creatures class and her difficulty in understanding his voice. She and other Slytherins also taunt the Gryffindor Quidditch players from the stands during a morning practice, notably teasing Angelina Johnson about her braided hair. During a Gryffindor-Slytherin match, which is also Ron's debut as the new Gryffindor Keeper, she conducts the Slytherin students as they sing a demeaning song entitled \\"Weasley is our King\\". Pansy has a slightly increased role in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. She is made a Slytherin prefect along with Malfoy, and later joins Dolores Umbridge's Inquisitorial Squad. When Dumbledore's Army flees the Room of Requirement following Dobby's revelation of an informant, Pansy searches the girls' bathrooms for escaped members and seizes Hermione's list of names as evidence. However, the Inquisitorial Squad members are jinxed in the midst of a student rebellion following Fred and George Weasley's departure from Hogwarts. Pansy is thereafter admitted to the hospital wing and misses a day's worth of lessons after sprouting a pair of antlers. Near the conclusion of Deathly Hallows, when Voldemort demands Harry's surrender to prevent the attack on Hogwarts, she advocates handing him to the Death Eaters, only for the other houses to collectively respond by standing up and pointing their wands at her. She eventually evacuates with the other Slytherins. Pansy was portrayed by Katherine Nicholson in the Philosopher's Stone and in the Chamber of Secrets, Genevieve Gaunt in Prisoner of Azkaban, Charlotte Ritchie in the Goblet of Fire, Lauren Shotton in Order of Phoenix, and by Scarlett Byrne in Half-Blood Prince, Deathly Hallows ‚Äì Part 1 and Part 2. =The Peverell brothers= The Peverell family is first mentioned in Half-Blood Prince as ancestors of Marvolo Gaunt, the maternal grandfather of Voldemort. In the final book of the series, they are revealed to be the original owners of the Deathly Hallows, which, according to The Tales of Beedle the Bard, they received from Death, although Dumbledore believed it is more likely that they created them themselves. The Peverell lineage continues through its living descendants, including Harry and his children. After Hermione saw the symbol of the Deathly Hallows on Ignotus Peverell's grave in Godric's Hollow, Harry recalled Marvolo Gaunt boasting that his ring held the Peverell coat of arms on it, thus realising that the three brothers were the Peverells. Harry deduces that he is descended from Ignotus, as the cloak is passed down through his family. Furthermore, Rowling has confirmed that Harry and Voldemort are indeed distant relatives because of their relation to the Peverells, as the majority of wizard families share common ancestry. Antioch Peverell was the eldest of the three Peverell brothers, and owner of the Elder Wand. He was killed in his sleep after bragging about the wand's invincibility, having won a duel with it. The murderer then stole the Elder Wand, thus initiating its bloody history. Cadmus Peverell was the middle of the three Peverell brothers, and owner of the Resurrection Stone. Using the Stone, he resurrected the girl he had once hoped to marry, who had died an untimely death. Though she had returned to the mortal world, she did not truly belong there and suffered. Driven mad by this, he killed himself to join her. The Stone was later embedded in a ring that ended up belonging to Marvolo Gaunt. Ignotus Peverell was the youngest of the three Peverell brothers, described in The Tales of Beedle the Bard as \\"the humblest and the wisest of the brothers\\". He was the owner of the Cloak of Invisibility, due to which, unlike his brothers, he avoided dying for many years, living a full and long life, and ultimately \\"greeting Death as a friend.\\" Harry deduces that his invisibility cloak is the original cloak owned by Ignotus. Unlike other cloaks of invisibility, it has never shown any kind of fading or damage despite the cloak being passed down through many generations of the Peverell family and ultimately to Harry. Harry is therefore a descendant of Ignotus Peverell. Both by birthright and by blood relations, Harry Potter is the rightful owner of the three Deathly Hallows, yet he decides to keep the Cloak only, returning the Elder Wand to Dumbledore's tomb after using it only to repair his own holly wand, and leaving the Resurrection Stone lost in the Forbidden Forest. In the film Deathly Hallows Part 2, Harry destroys the Elder Wand, snapping it in half and throwing the pieces off a bridge. =Madam Rosmerta= Madam Rosmerta is the landlady of The Three Broomsticks pub. She is described in the books as \\"a curvy sort of woman\\" with curly hair; several students‚Äîincluding Ron‚Äîhave a crush on her. In Prisoner of Azkaban, Madam Rosmerta is angered when Dementors are in Hogsmeade as their presence is scaring away many of her customers. Apart from hosting an informal meeting between McGonagall, Cornelius Fudge, Filius Flitwick, and Hagrid, she does not play a major role in the early part of the Harry Potter series. In Half-Blood Prince it emerges that in order to fulfil his mission to assassinate Dumbledore, Draco has managed to place Rosmerta under the Imperius Curse. He uses her to pass on a cursed necklace to Hogwarts student Katie Bell, who accidentally touches the necklace and is herself subjected to the very harmful curse intended for the Headmaster. Draco also commands her to send a bottle of poisoned mead to Horace Slughorn intending it to be a Christmas present for Dumbledore, after overhearing Hermione mentioning that the school security would not recognise something put in a mislabelled bottle, and knowing that a package from Rosmerta would not be checked. Malfoy communicates with Rosmerta through enchanted fake Galleons. After Harry and Dumbledore's adventure in the cave to retrieve a locket they believe to be one of Voldemort's Horcruxes, they apparate to Hogsmeade, where Madam Rosmerta alerts them to the presence of the Dark Mark above the school and gives them brooms on which they can travel rapidly back to Hogwarts, where Draco's plan can be brought to completion. Rosmerta is among those paying respects at Dumbledore's funeral. She is named after the Gaulish goddess Rosmerta, whose attributes include abundance and fertility. Julie Christie appeared as Madam Rosmerta in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. =Stan Shunpike= Stan Shunpike is the young, pimply conductor of the Knight Bus. He speaks with a Cockney accent and talks to Harry as he travels to London in the first part of Prisoner of Azkaban. He also appears briefly in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire at the Quidditch World Cup, boasting to a group of Veela, the Bulgarian team's official mascot, of his ambitious plans to become the next Minister of Magic. In Order of the Phoenix, he conducts the Knight Bus when Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, Ginny, Lupin, and Tonks take it to return to Hogwarts after the Christmas holidays. Stan mentions that he does not believe the media rumours about Harry being insane, though Harry interprets Stan's actions as not caring how insane someone is as long as he/she is famous enough to get into the papers. In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Stan is arrested on suspicion of Death Eater activity. Harry and Dumbledore, however, believe that he is almost certainly not guilty. Even so, Stan is kept in Azkaban in order for the Ministry of Magic to give the pretence that progress is being made in the capturing of Death Eaters. When the new Minister for Magic asks Harry to be a sort of mascot for the Ministry, Harry refuses on the grounds of the Ministry's actions at the time ‚Äì namely holding Stan under arrest. In Deathly Hallows, a \\"strangely blank\\" looking Stan is among the Death Eaters who pursue Harry during his escape from Privet Drive. Harry gives himself away to his attackers by attempting to only disarm Stan, as Harry believes him to be under the Imperius Curse, and is later reprimanded by Remus Lupin. Later on, when Harry, Ron and Hermione are captured in the forest by Fenrir Greyback, Ron attempts to pose as Stan only to be immediately disbelieved and told Stan has \\"put a bit of work their way\\" referring to turning in missing or wanted Muggle-borns. Stan was portrayed by Lee Ingleby in the film adaptation of Prisoner of Azkaban. =Rita Skeeter= Rita Skeeter is a reporter for the Daily Prophet and a correspondent for the Witch Weekly, who specialises in tabloid journalism, for which she is armed with such magical devices as the Quick- Quotes Quill. Rita is an unregistered Animagus, capable of transforming into a beetle to spy on unsuspecting victims for her stories, which she is revealed to have done multiple times in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. As a reporter who fabricates information to write an appealing story, she is a nuisance to Harry and his friends throughout Goblet of Fire, and a brief but reluctant ally in Order of the Phoenix. She is described as having curly blonde hair, jewelled spectacles, thick fingers with two-inch long nails painted crimson, a crocodile-skin handbag, and a heavy jawed face. Harry first encounters Rita when she interviews the Triwizard Tournament contestants for an article in the Daily Prophet, which turns out to be a highly falsified story on Harry himself. During the situations where Rita overhears information, the book subtly refers to her presence: Viktor Krum mentions that Hermione has a water beetle in her hair, and during the Yule Ball, she overhears Hagrid telling Madame Maxime that he is half-giant, Harry having noticed a beetle on a nearby statue. During a Divinations class, Harry falls asleep and hears an \\"insect clicking.\\" Rita prints an article that portrays Hagrid as dangerous, prompting letters from parents frightened by the idea of having a \\"ferocious\\" giant teach their children. When Rita encounters Harry, Ron, and Hermione in Hogsmeade, Hermione insults her. Rita, in revenge, then writes a nasty story about Hermione based on false rumours provided by Pansy Parkinson, making her out to be a plain but skilled witch who uses love potions to \\"satisfy her taste for celebrity wizards,\\" including Harry and Krum. Rita's last defaming article states that Harry is \\"disturbed and dangerous,\\" and uses comments from Draco and his Slytherin cronies as its basis. Ultimately, Hermione discovers the means by which Rita Skeeter spies on others and forces her to \\"keep her quill to herself for a full year\\", threatening to report her to the authorities as an illegal Animagus. Her last article discredits Harry and serves as the basis for Cornelius Fudge's refusal to believe Harry's story about Voldemort's return. It is also the start of the Ministry's smear campaign against Harry and Dumbledore.Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Chapter 36: The Parting of the Ways. In Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Hermione blackmails Rita by threatening to reveal that she is an Animagus and forces her to interview Harry about Voldemort's return. She then must submit her story to The Quibbler. Rita later makes a brief appearance in Half-Blood Prince, where Harry is infuriated to notice her clutching a notebook at Dumbledore's funeral. Although Rita does not make an appearance in Deathly Hallows, she is mentioned on numerous occasions throughout the novel, generally in a negative light in relation to her unauthorised biography of Dumbledore entitled The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore. The book depicts the former headmaster in an extremely negative light but is mostly based on truth, much to Harry's horror. It is implied that she gained some of her information in unethical or illegal ways., chapter 2, chapter 18 When asked on a web chat if Rita was still reporting, Rowling answered; \\"Naturally, what could stop Rita? I imagine she immediately dashed off a biography of Harry after he defeated Voldemort. One quarter truth to three-quarters rubbish.\\" and \\"Snape: Scoundrel or Saint?\\" It has been speculated that the fraught relationship between Rowling and the press was the inspiration for the author to develop the character. However, Rowling noted in 2000 that the character actually predates her rise to fame. 16 October 2000. Retrieved 30 October 2007. Rita was intended to be in Philosopher's Stone, as Rowling revealed in an interview: \\"you know when Harry walks into the Leaky Cauldron for the first time and everyone says, \\"Mr. Potter you're back!\\", I wanted to put a journalist in there. She wasn't called Rita then but she was a woman. And then I thought, as I looked at the plot overall, I thought, that's not really where she fits best, she fits best in Four when Harry's supposed to come to terms with his fame.\\"Transcript of interview with J.K. Rowling. BBC Newsround. 2000. Retrieved 25 October 2007. Miranda Richardson appeared as Rita in the film adaptation of Goblet of Fire as well as in Deathly Hallows. IGN's Joe Utichi called Rita his eighth favourite Harry Potter character, saying that she was \\"terrifyingly familiar\\". =Hepzibah Smith= Hepzibah Smith is introduced within Dumbledore's Pensieve, as part of a series of memories shown to Harry by his headmaster probing into Voldemort's past. She is described as having been an extremely wealthy, well-born old witch who enjoyed collecting antiques and collectibles. In the memory, Hepzibah wears long robes and gowns of pink, and when sitting upon her throne-like chair, she is described as giving the impression of a large \\"melting iced cake\\". She wears a large, elaborate, ginger wig upon her head and dabs her red cheeks with rouge. Tom Riddle, fresh out of Hogwarts and working for Borgin and Burkes, visits Hepzibah to make an offer for some goblin-made armour which she owns. He presents her with flowers and charms and flatters her. Enamoured of Riddle, Hepzibah shows him her most prized possessions ‚Äì a cup, owned by her ancestor Helga Hufflepuff, and a locket which once belonged to Salazar Slytherin, that she had purchased from Borgin and Burkes. Two days after the events of the memory occurred, Hepzibah died, and Hufflepuff's cup and Slytherin's locket were never found. =Andromeda Tonks= Andromeda Tonks is the mother of Nymphadora Tonks. Born Andromeda Black, she is a pure-blood witch, daughter of Cygnus Black and Druella Rosier and sister of Bellatrix Lestrange and Narcissa Malfoy. The middle sister, she was burned off the family tapestry in Number 12, Grimmauld Place by her aunt Walburga and estranged from the family because she married Ted Tonks, a Muggle-born wizard. She was Sirius Black's favourite cousin. Andromeda is responsible for giving her daughter the name \\"Nymphadora\\",, Chapter 3 a name like those typical of her family. She has a talent for household spells and cleanliness, lacked by her husband and daughter. She is not introduced until the beginning of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. She strongly resembles her sister Bellatrix, so much so that Harry thinks she is Bellatrix upon first meeting her, but Andromeda is kind looking and has soft brown rather than black hair. She and Ted are later tortured for information on Harry's whereabouts. For someone who is not a member of the Order of the Phoenix, the war with Voldemort and his followers exacts a very heavy toll on Andromeda: her husband, her daughter, her son-in-law and her sister are all killed. Rowling stated in an interview that after the war, Andromeda raises Teddy Lupin, her grandson. She is never seen in the films. =Ted Tonks= Edward \\"Ted\\" Tonks is a Muggle-born wizard who is described as a \\"fair-haired, big-bellied man\\". He marries Andromeda Black. Their marriage led to his wife's disownment by the rest of her strict pure-blood family. Ted and Andromeda are the parents of Nymphadora Tonks. Ted plays an active role in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Near the beginning of the novel, his home is a hideout for Harry and Hagrid, as the two are on the run from Voldemort. His home holds the Portkey that helps Harry escape to The Burrow. Later due to Ted's refusal to register as a Muggle-born, he is one of the Muggle-born wizards to flee the Ministry's new oppressive regime after the Death Eaters take over. During his flight, he meets the goblins Griphook and Gornuk, as well as Dean Thomas and Dirk Cresswell. Soon after, Ted is murdered by Snatchers who also kill Gornuk and Cresswell., Chapter 22 When Nymphadora gives birth to her and Lupin's son, they name him Teddy in honour of her father. =Oliver Wood= Oliver Wood is Captain and keeper of the Gryffindor Quidditch team in the first three novels and was first introduced in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. He is simply described as being big and burly. Wood is a talented and keen player and a born leader as captain, but also tends to act as a taskmaster due to his obsession with the game; he never cancels practices, poor weather conditions notwithstanding, and holds training sessions in early morning hours. Although Oliver is in general a nice person, he lacks tact. Oliver appears briefly in Goblet of Fire, when he excitedly introduces Harry to his parents at the Quidditch World Cup and announces that he joined the Puddlemere United reserve team. He is one of many Hogwarts students, past and present, who take part in the Battle of Hogwarts in Deathly Hallows, and is among the survivors of the first clash; Harry sees him assisting Neville Longbottom in carrying the body of Colin Creevey. He is four years above Harry in Gryffindor. Oliver Wood was portrayed by Sean Biggerstaff in the first two films and once again in the eighth film. =The Muggle Prime Minister = The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, referred to as the Muggle Prime Minister by wizards, receives a visit from Cornelius Fudge and Rufus Scrimgeour in the opening chapter of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. Using a series of flashbacks, Rowling describes how the Prime Minister is aware of the existence of the wizarding world, through several meetings with Fudge that include his first night as Prime Minister, the night in which Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban, the notification of the incident in the Quidditch World Cup and the announcement of the importation of dragons and a sphinx for the Triwizard Tournament, and finally the Azkaban mass break-out from the fifth book. Rowling intended to include the Prime Minister scene in earlier books, but she thought that it could not properly fit until the sixth book. In the first chapter of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, the Prime Minister recalls his day, during which one of his political opponents had been criticising him and his government for several catastrophes that have recently happened in Britain. Readers discover a little later during the discussion with Fudge, that these catastrophes are, in fact, the doings of Voldemort and his followers. He also discovers that he is protected by an Auror who now works in his office, Kingsley Shacklebolt. =The Weird Sisters= The Weird Sisters are a wizarding rock band. Their instruments include guitars, bass, lute, cello, bagpipes and drums. They are booked by Dumbledore to play at Hogwarts during the Yule Ball. In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire they are described as \\"all extremely hairy and dressed in black robes that had been artfully ripped and torn.\\" A full music video of the band playing at the Yule Ball is included as an extended scene on the Goblet of Fire film 2-disc DVD. In 2005, Warner Bros., the international distributor of Goblet of Fire was sued for trademark violations by members of a Canadian folk-rock band named The Wyrd Sisters.Canadian Group Sues Radiohead, Warner Bros. Over Use Of Name In 'Harry Potter' Flick Long-running folk group claims trademark infringement The term Weird Sisters is also used in William Shakespeare's play Macbeth to describe the three witches, and more closely contemporaneous with the Harry Potter novels, in Terry Pratchett's Discworld Cycle . The members of the band according to Wizards of the Coast Famous Wizard cards are: :*Heathcote Barbary ‚Äì rhythm guitar :*Gideon Crumb ‚Äì bagpipes :*Kirley Duke ‚Äì lead guitar :*Merton Graves ‚Äì cello :*Orsino Thruston ‚Äì drums :*Donaghan Tremlett ‚Äì bass :*Myron Wagtail ‚Äì lead singer :*Herman Wintringham ‚Äì lute They appear in the film version of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire played by the following real- life musicians: :*Jarvis Cocker (of Pulp) as Myron Wagtail ‚Äì vocals :*Jonny Greenwood (of Radiohead) as Kirley Duke ‚Äì lead guitar :*Jason Buckle (of All Seeing I) as Heathcote Barbary ‚Äì rhythm guitar :*Steve Mackey (of Pulp) as Donaghan Tremlett ‚Äì bass :*Steven Claydon (of Add N to (X)) as Gideon Crumb ‚Äì keyboards and bagpipes :*Phil Selway (of Radiohead) as Orsino Thruston ‚Äì drums They performed three songs (all composed by Cocker), entitled \\"Do the Hippogriff\\", \\"This Is the Night\\" and \\"Magic Works\\" during the Yule Ball. Children of the Potter family =James Potter= James Sirius Potter is the first-born child of Harry and Ginny, born two years before his brother Albus Severus. He was named after his paternal grandfather James Potter and his father's godfather Sirius Black, and he is described as being similar in character to both of his namesakes as well as his uncles, Fred and George Weasley, with a penchant for practical jokes and general misbehaviour. James is portrayed by Will Dunn in Deathly Hallows: Part 2. James Sirius Potter was born on 16 November 2004. =Albus Potter= Albus Severus Potter is Harry and Ginny's second-born child. Albus is said to look much like Harry and to be the only one of his siblings to have inherited Lily Potter's green eyes. He is named after Albus Dumbledore and Severus Snape, and would be eleven at the time of the epilogue. Albus is portrayed by Arthur Bowen in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ‚Äì Part 2. Albus is one of the main characters in the two- part stage play Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. He has been played in the West End production by Sam Clemmett, Theo Ancient, Joe Idris-Roberts, and Dominic Short. Albus Severus Potter was born in 2006. =Lily Potter= Lily Luna Potter is the daughter of Harry and Ginny, the youngest of their three children. Her name honours two women important to her parents‚Äîher paternal grandmother Lily Potter, and her parents' good friend Luna Lovegood.J.K.Rowling ‚Äì A Year in the Life; James Runcie; Independent Television (ITV); 2007 She is two years younger than her brother Albus Severus, making her around nine, and is close in age to her cousin Hugo. It is also stated that she has her mother's and possibly both of her own grandmothers' red hair. In the epilogue of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, she accompanied her parents as they escorted James and Albus Potter to Platform 9¬æ to the Hogwarts Express. Lily is portrayed by Daphne de Beistegui in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ‚Äì Part 2. Children of the Weasleys =Rose Weasley= Rose Weasley is Hermione and Ron's daughter and older child. Rose is introduced in the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows epilogue in which she is leaving for her first year at Hogwarts, as is her cousin Albus Severus Potter. According to Ron she inherited her mother's brains and ambition. Rose is portrayed by Helena Barlow in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2. She also features in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child; she has been played in the West End production by Cherrelle Skeete and Helen Aluko. =Hugo Weasley= Hugo Weasley is Hermione and Ron's son and younger child. He is close in age to Harry and Ginny's daughter and youngest child, Lily Luna Potter, and had not yet started at Hogwarts by the epilogue of Deathly Hallows. Hugo is portrayed by Ryan Turner in Deathly Hallows: Part 2.

Angiogenin is a potent stimulator of new blood vessels through the process of angiogenesis. Ang hydrolyzes cellular RNA, resulting in modulated levels of protein synthesis and interacts with DNA causing a promoter-like increase in the expression of rRNA. Ang is associated with cancer and neurological disease through angiogenesis and through activating gene expression that suppresses apoptosis.  Function  Angiogenin is a key protein implicated in angiogenesis in normal and tumor growth. Angiogenin interacts with endothelial and smooth muscle cells resulting in cell migration, invasion, proliferation and formation of tubular structures. Ang binds to actin of both smooth muscle and endothelial cells to form complexes that activate proteolytic cascades which upregulate the production of proteases and plasmin that degrade the laminin and fibronectin layers of the basement membrane. Degradation of the basement membrane and extracellular matrix allows the endothelial cells to penetrate and migrate into the perivascular tissue. Signal transduction pathways activated by Ang interactions at the cellular membrane of endothelial cells produce extracellular signal-related kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) and protein kinase B/Akt. Activation of these proteins leads to invasion of the basement membrane and cell proliferation associated with further angiogenesis. The most important step in the angiogenesis process is the translocation of Ang to the cell nucleus. Once Ang has been translocated to the nucleus, it enhances rRNA transcription by binding to the CT-rich (CTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCCCTC) angiogenin binding element (ABE) within the upstream intergenic region of rDNA, which subsequently activates other angiogenic factors that induce angiogenesis. However, angiogenin is unique among the many proteins that are involved in angiogenesis in that it is also an enzyme with an amino acid sequence 33% identical to that of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease (RNase) A. Ang has the same general catalytic properties as RNase A, it cleaves preferentially on the 3' side of pyrimidines and follows a transphosphorylation/hydrolysis mechanism. Although angiogenin contains many of the same catalytic residues as RNase A, it cleaves standard RNA substrates 105‚Äì106 times less efficiently than RNase A. The reason for this inefficiency is due to the 117 residue consisting of a glutamine, which blocks the catalytic site. Removal of this residue through mutation increases the ribonuclease activity between 11 and 30 fold. Despite this apparent weakness, the enzymatic activity of Ang appears to be essential for biological activity: replacements of important catalytic site residues (histidine-13 and histidine-114) invariably diminish both the ribonuclease activity toward tRNA by 10,000 fold and almost abolishes angiogenesis activities completely.  Disease  = Cancer = Ang has a prominent role in the pathology of cancer due to its functions in angiogenesis and cell survival. Since Ang possesses angiogenic activity, it makes Ang a possible candidate in therapeutic treatments of cancer. Studies of Ang and tumor relationships provide evidence for a connection between the two. The translocation of Ang to the nucleus causes an upregulation of transcriptional rRNA, while knockdown strains of Ang cause downregulation. The presence of Ang inhibitors that block translocation resulted in a decrease of tumor growth and overall angiogenesis. HeLa cells translocate Ang to the nucleus independent of cell density. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), translocation of Ang to the nucleus stops after cells reach a specific density, while in HeLa cells translocation continued past that point. Inhibition of Ang affects the ability of HeLa cells to proliferate, which proposes an effective target for possible therapies. = Neurodegenerative diseases = Due to the ability of Ang to protect motoneurons (MNs), causal links between Ang mutations and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are likely. The angiogenic factors associated with Ang may protect the central nervous system and MNs directly. Experiments with wild type Ang found that it slows MN degeneration in mice that had developed ALS, providing evidence for further development of Ang protein therapy in ALS treatment. Angiogenin expression in Parkinson's disease is dramatically decreased in the presence of alpha-synuclein (Œ±-syn) aggregations. Exogenous angiogenin applied to dopamine-producing cells leads to the phosphorylation of PKB/AKT and the activation of this complex inhibits cleavage of caspase 3 and apoptosis when cells are exposed to a Parkinson's-like inducing substance.  Gene  Alternative splicing results in two transcript variants encoding the same protein. This gene and the gene that encodes ribonuclease, RNase A family, 4 share promoters and 5' exons. Each gene splices to a unique downstream exon that contains its complete coding region.

He was one of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales. Early years and ordination John Kemble was born at Rhydicar Farm, St Weonards, Herefordshire, in 1599, the son of John and Anne Kemble. They were a prominent local recusant Catholic family, which included four other priests. John Kemble was ordained at Douai College, on 23 February 1625. He returned to England on 4 June 1625 as a missionary in Monmouthshire and Herefordshire. Pastoral work In normal times, despite harsh anti-Catholic laws, the extent of persecution depended upon the sympathies of local landowners. Around Hereford and Monmouth, where the Catholic Earl of Worcester (from 1642 Marquess) held sway at Raglan Castle, the old religion was for long periods practised with impunity, even after his own conversion to the Church of England. From 1622 there was even a Jesuit College at Cwm, Llanrothal, near Welsh Newton, which survived until 1678, though its existence was widely known, and was twice debated in the House of Commons. Upon Fr Kemble's return to Monmouthshire he served more than 50 years as an itinerant priest, winning admirers even among Protestants. Little is known of his work caring for his flock during these 53 years. The condition of Catholics had eased but priests still needed to perform their ministry discreetly. Based at Pembridge Castle, the home of his nephew, Captain Richard Kemble,\\"The Ven. Father John Kemble\\", The Tablet, 9 August 1902 he had seemed immune from prosecution. Titus Oates' plot The uneasy tolerance within which Father Kemble had operated was shattered by the Popish Plot of 1678. Titus Oates was a perjurer who concocted a plot in which the Anglican Charles II would be assassinated and his Catholic brother (later, King James II) installed as king in his place. When Oates' story was examined in detail the whole fraud was exposed, but it gave disgruntled Protestants and ambitious chancers an opportunity. Anti-Catholic politicians made cynical use of this \\"plot\\" to implicate English Catholics, particularly priests. A Monmouthshire man, William Bedloe, laid false information against the leading Catholics of the area.May, David. \\"The Life and martyrdom of John Kemble\\", St. Mary's, Monmouth 27 February 2009 Among the many Catholics caught up in the frenzy was Father John Kemble. Father David Lewis was apprehended at St. Michael's Church, Llantarnam. Arrest and execution Father Kemble was staying at Pembridge Castle, near Welsh Newton, when he was arrested on 7 December 1678. He was warned about the impending arrest but declined to leave his flock, saying, \\"According to the course of nature, I have but a few years to live. It will be an advantage to suffer for my religion and, therefore, I will not abscond.\\" He was arrested by Captain John Scudamore of Kentchurch. It is a comment on the tortuous values of the age that Scudamore's own wife and children were parishioners of Father Kemble. Kemble was kept in Hereford Gaol until the Spring Assizes of 1679. In April 1679 Father Kemble, now 80, was ordered to be taken to London to be interviewed about the plot. As the elderly priest had difficulty riding a horse, he was strapped like a pack to his horse on the way there. He was found to have had no connection with the alleged plot but found guilty of the treasonous crime of being a Catholic priest. He was sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered. He was returned to Hereford for the sentence to be carried out, and allowed to walk most of the way back. Before he was led out to his execution on 22 August 1679 Father Kemble insisted on saying his prayers and finishing his drink, and the assembled party joined the elderly priest in a final smoke and a cup of sack. The Herefordshire sayings, Kemble pipe and Kemble cup, refer to a parting pipe or cup. Before his death Father Kemble addressed the assembled crowd, pointing out that no association with the \\"plot\\" had been charged to him. The old priest went on to say: \\"The failure of the authorities in London to connect me to the plot makes it evident that I die only for profession the Catholic religion, which was the religion that first made this Kingdom Christian.\\" Consoling his distraught hangman, the priest is said to have whispered, \\"Honest Anthony, my friend Anthony, be not afraid; do thy office. I forgive thee with all my heart. Thou wilt do me a greater kindness than discourtesy.\\"\\"Walks\\", Hereford Times, 1 December 2011 Grave of John Kemble Kemble was allowed to die on the gallows before being drawn and quartered, thus he was spared the agony suffered by many of other Catholic martyrs of England, Scotland and Wales. He died on 22 August 1679 at Widemarsh Common, Hereford. His death was greeted with dismay in the locality, Protestants no less than Catholics praising him as \\"a great gentleman\\".Kenyon, J.P. The Popish Plot Phoenix Press reissue 2000 p.206 One of Kemble's hands is still preserved at St Francis Xavier Church in Hereford city centre. His body rests in the (Church of England) churchyard of St Mary the Virgin at Welsh Newton, and local Catholics make an annual pilgrimage to his grave. Sainthood Miracles were soon attributed to the saintly priest. Scudamore's daughter was cured of throat cancer, and Scudamore's wife recovered her hearing whilst praying at the Kemble's grave. John Kemble was beatified in 1929 by Pope Pius XI and canonized on 25 October 1970 by Pope Paul VI as one of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales.Walsh, Michael J., \\"John Kemble\\", A New Dictionary of Saints, Liturgical Press, 2007 Relatives Sarah Siddons as the Tragic Muse by Sir Joshua Reynolds (The Huntington, San Marino, California) The famous Kemble family are relatives of John Kemble. The family became almost a 'Royal Family' of the English stage in the nineteenth century. The most famous was Sarah Siddons, n√©e Kemble. It has been said that she was the finest English tragic actress ever. She was John Kemble's great-great grandniece. Other noteworthy members of the family, though not Catholics, were: Roger Kemble, Stephen Kemble, Charles Kemble, John Mitchell Kemble, Frances Anne Kemble who after spending time in the United States held strong anti slavery opinions, Adelaide Kemble and Henry Kemble. The actor John Philip Kemble was baptized a Catholic and spent some time at Douai.

The lake is formed by Terminus Dam on the Kaweah River. The river originates in the Sierra Nevada mountains and drains about into Lake Kaweah before flowing towards the San Joaquin Valley. From Lake Kaweah, the river flows toward the city of Visalia, splitting into the Kaweah River and St. Johns River as it flows west into the Tulare Lakebed. The lake has a capacity of . A project to raise the lake was completed in 2004. The lake now impounds an additional and downstream flood protection to downstream communities and agricultural land has been increased. Because its primary purpose is flood control, Lake Kaweah is maintained at a very low level or empty for most of the year, and generally only fills between May and June. Due to the limited capacity of the reservoir, large spills of floodwater often occur after large rain storms.

The pilot--and the airframe--feel temporarily \\"weightless\\" because the aircraft is in free-fall or decelerating vertically at the top of a climb. It may also occur during an excessively rapid entry into autorotation. This can have a disastrous effect on the aircraft, particularly in the case of helicopters, some of which need the rotor to constantly be under a non-zero amount of load.  Effects  In smaller airplanes Most smaller airplanes and gliders have no problems with 0g conditions. In fact, it can be enjoyable to have zero gravity in the cockpit. To produce 0g, the aircraft has to follow a ballistic flight path, which is essentially an upside down parabola. This is the only method to simulate zero gravity for humans on earth. In helicopters In contrast, low-g conditions can be disastrous for helicopters. In such a situation their rotors may flap beyond normal limits. The excessive flapping can cause the root of the blades to exceed the limit of their hinges and this condition, known as mast bumping, can cause the separation of the blades from the hub or for the mast to shear, and hence detach the whole system from the aircraft, falling from the sky. This is especially true for helicopters with teetering rotors, such as the two-bladed design seen on Robinson helicopters. This effect was first discovered when many accidents with Bell UH-1 and AH-1 helicopters occurred. These particular helicopters simply crashed without any obvious cause. Later, it was found that these accidents usually happened during low terrain flight after passing a ridge and initiating a dive from the previous climb. Articulated and rigid rotor systems do not lose controlling forces up to 0g, but may encounter this depending on their flapping hinge offset from the mast. However, dangerous situations, as with a teetering rotor, may not occur. On fixed-wing aircraft Low-g conditions can also affect fixed-wing aircraft in some instances, mainly by disrupting the airflow over the wings, making them difficult or impossible to control via the aerodynamic surfaces. The controllability of an airplane by the control surfaces only depends on airspeed. So, if one keeps airspeed, control is retained. Usually the controllability is even increased, because there is no need to produce lift. 0g forces are a minimal problem for fixed wing aircraft, but there are exceptions, including, but not limited to, airplanes with gravity-fed fuel systems. Use in space agencies To simulate 0-g conditions some space agencies uses a modified passenger aircraft to simulate a low-g condition. The ESA uses an Airbus A300, for example. NASA has the Vomit Comet. One upside down parabola simulates 0g for about 25 s.

In most scenarios, a deductive system is first understood from context, after which an element phiin T of a theory T is then called a theorem of the theory. In many deductive systems there is usually a subset Sigma subset T that is called \\"the set of axioms\\" of the theory T, in which case the deductive system is also called an \\"axiomatic system\\". By definition, every axiom is automatically a theorem. A first-order theory is a set of first-order sentences (theorems) recursively obtained by the inference rules of the system applied to the set of axioms.  General theories (as expressed in formal language)  When defining theories for foundational purposes, additional care must be taken as normal set-theoretic language may not be appropriate. The construction of a theory begins by specifying a definite non-empty conceptual class mathcal{E}, the elements of which are called statements. These initial statements are often called the primitive elements or elementary statements of the theory ‚Äî to distinguish them from other statements which may be derived from them. A theory mathcal{T} is a conceptual class consisting of certain of these elementary statements. The elementary statements which belong to mathcal{T} are called the elementary theorems of mathcal{T} and are said to be true. In this way, a theory can be seen as a way of designating a subset of mathcal{E} which only contain statements that are true. This general way of designating a theory stipulates that the truth of any of its elementary statements is not known without reference to mathcal{T}. Thus the same elementary statement may be true with respect to one theory but false with respect to another. This is reminiscent of the case in ordinary language where statements such as \\"He is an honest person\\" cannot be judged true or false without interpreting who \\"he\\" is, and ‚Äî for that matter ‚Äî what an \\"honest person\\" is under this theory.Haskell Curry, Foundations of Mathematical Logic, 2010. = Subtheories and extensions = A theory mathcal{S} is a subtheory of a theory mathcal{T} if mathcal{S} is a subset of mathcal{T}. If mathcal{T} is a subset of mathcal{S} then mathcal{S} is called an extension or a supertheory of mathcal{T} = Deductive theories = A theory is said to be a deductive theory if mathcal{T} is an inductive class. That is, that its content is based on some formal deductive system and that some of its elementary statements are taken as axioms. In a deductive theory, any sentence which is a logical consequence of one or more of the axioms is also a sentence of that theory. = Consistency and completeness = A syntactically consistent theory is a theory from which not every sentence in the underlying language can be proven (with respect to some deductive system which is usually clear from context). In a deductive system (such as first-order logic) that satisfies the principle of explosion, this is equivalent to requiring that there is no sentence œÜ such that both œÜ and its negation can be proven from the theory. A satisfiable theory is a theory that has a model. This means there is a structure M that satisfies every sentence in the theory. Any satisfiable theory is syntactically consistent, because the structure satisfying the theory will satisfy exactly one of œÜ and the negation of œÜ, for each sentence œÜ. A consistent theory is sometimes defined to be a syntactically consistent theory, and sometimes defined to be a satisfiable theory. For first-order logic, the most important case, it follows from the completeness theorem that the two meanings coincide. In other logics, such as second-order logic, there are syntactically consistent theories that are not satisfiable, such as œâ-inconsistent theories. A complete consistent theory (or just a complete theory) is a consistent theory mathcal{T} such that for every sentence œÜ in its language, either œÜ is provable from mathcal{T} or mathcal{T} cup {œÜ} is inconsistent. For theories closed under logical consequence, this means that for every sentence œÜ, either œÜ or its negation is contained in the theory. An incomplete theory is a consistent theory that is not complete. (see also œâ-consistent theory for a stronger notion of consistency.) = Interpretation of a theory = An interpretation of a theory is the relationship between a theory and some contensive subject matter when there is a many-to-one correspondence between certain elementary statements of the theory, and certain contensive statements related to the subject matter. If every elementary statement in the theory has a contensive correspondent it is called a full interpretation, otherwise it is called a partial interpretation.Haskell Curry, Foundations of Mathematical Logic, 2010, p. 48. = Theories associated with a structure = Each structure has several associated theories. The complete theory of a structure A is the set of all first-order sentences over the signature of A which are satisfied by A. It is denoted by Th(A). More generally, the theory of K, a class of œÉ-structures, is the set of all first- order œÉ-sentences that are satisfied by all structures in K, and is denoted by Th(K). Clearly Th(A) = Th({A}). These notions can also be defined with respect to other logics. For each œÉ-structure A, there are several associated theories in a larger signature œÉ' that extends œÉ by adding one new constant symbol for each element of the domain of A. (If the new constant symbols are identified with the elements of A which they represent, œÉ' can be taken to be œÉ cup A.) The cardinality of œÉ' is thus the larger of the cardinality of œÉ and the cardinality of A. The diagram of A consists of all atomic or negated atomic œÉ'-sentences that are satisfied by A and is denoted by diagA. The positive diagram of A is the set of all atomic œÉ'-sentences which A satisfies. It is denoted by diag+A. The elementary diagram of A is the set eldiagA of all first-order œÉ'-sentences that are satisfied by A or, equivalently, the complete (first-order) theory of the natural expansion of A to the signature œÉ'.  First-order theories  A first-order theory mathcal{QS} is a set of sentences in a first-order formal language mathcal{Q}. = Derivation in a first-order theory = There are many formal derivation (\\"proof\\") systems for first-order logic. These include Hilbert-style deductive systems, natural deduction, the sequent calculus, the tableaux method and resolution. = Syntactic consequence in a first-order theory = A formula A is a syntactic consequence of a first-order theory mathcal{QS} if there is a derivation of A using only formulas in mathcal{QS} as non-logical axioms. Such a formula A is also called a theorem of mathcal{QS}. The notation \\" mathcal{QS} vdash A\\" indicates A is a theorem of mathcal{QS}. = Interpretation of a first-order theory = An interpretation of a first-order theory provides a semantics for the formulas of the theory. An interpretation is said to satisfy a formula if the formula is true according to the interpretation. A model of a first-order theory mathcal{QS} is an interpretation in which every formula of mathcal{QS} is satisfied. = First-order theories with identity = A first- order theory mathcal{QS} is a first-order theory with identity if mathcal{QS} includes the identity relation symbol \\"=\\" and the reflexivity and substitution axiom schemes for this symbol. = Topics related to first-order theories = *Compactness theorem *Consistent set *Deduction theorem *Enumeration theorem *Lindenbaum's lemma *L√∂wenheim‚ÄìSkolem theorem  Examples  One way to specify a theory is to define a set of axioms in a particular language. The theory can be taken to include just those axioms, or their logical or provable consequences, as desired. Theories obtained this way include ZFC and Peano arithmetic. A second way to specify a theory is to begin with a structure, and let the theory to be the set of sentences that are satisfied by the structure. This is a method for producing complete theories through the semantic route, with examples including the set of true sentences under the structure (N, +, √ó, 0, 1, =), where N is the set of natural numbers, and the set of true sentences under the structure (R, +, √ó, 0, 1, =), where R is the set of real numbers. The first of these, called the theory of true arithmetic, cannot be written as the set of logical consequences of any enumerable set of axioms. The theory of (R, +, √ó, 0, 1, =) was shown by Tarski to be decidable; it is the theory of real closed fields (see Decidability of first-order theories of the real numbers for more).

Early life Wood was born in Glossop, Derbyshire, the son of Samuel Wood, a cotton manufacturer and his wife Annie. His father made his fortune in the cotton industry in Derbyshire during the late 19th century. Samuel Hill Wood was educated at Eton College and was a keen sportsman. He continued to run the cotton business. Cricket career Wood made his cricket debut for Derbyshire in the 1894 season, and became their captain in the 1899 season for three seasons. Wood was the only batsman to score 10 runs off one ball in a first-class game. In May 1900, when playing for Derbyshire against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), he struck a ball from Cuthbert Burnup and as a result of the netting and an overthrow clocked up ten ‚Äì a feat which was originally included in the Guinness Book of Records. Wood was a right hand batsman and played 54 innings in 24 first-class matches, with an average of 17.62 and a top score of 81 not out. He took no wickets in the 93 balls he bowled. Under his captaincy Derbyshire were fifteenth in the County Championship in 1899, thirteenth in 1900 and back to fifteenth in 1901.CricketArchive Football at Glossop Wood was chairman and owner of Glossop North End funding it up until World War I. His expenditure was estimated to be more than ¬£30,000 at that time. His efforts and enthusiasm led to the club being included in the enlarged Football League Second Division in 1898. He scoured the country for professional footballers and after only one season Glossop qualified as Second Division runners up and were promoted to the First Division.Beehive ‚Äì This Derbyshire They were relegated after a season and by 1914 Hill Wood severed his connection and Glossop later resigned from the Football League. Political career In 1910, Hill Wood was elected MP for High Peak, holding the seat until 1929. He changed his name to Hill- Wood by royal licence in 1912. In the First World War, he served in the Cheshire Regiment reaching the rank of Major. Announced in the 1921 New Year Honours, he was created a baronet on 25 January 1921. Arsenal chairmanship In 1929, after leaving parliament, he succeeded the disgraced Henry Norris as chairman of Arsenal, and presided over the club during its first period of success in the 1930s. He stepped down in 1936 but returned to the role after the Second World War, holding the post until his death in Westminster in 1949. In another field of sport, he owned two greyhounds who won the Waterloo Cup. Family Hill Wood married The Hon. Rachel Bateman-Hanbury, youngest daughter of Lord Bateman-Hanbury, in 1899 and had four sons: Basil, Wilfred, Denis and Charles. His son Denis and his grandson Peter Hill-Wood have also served as Chairmen of Arsenal, while his sons, Basil, Denis, Wilfred and Charles, and his brother-in-law David Brand, have all played county cricket for the Derbyshire County Cricket Club at various points in their history.

It may be that he was taken prisoner at Rye only a short time after landing in England and that he escaped. In 1583 he was described as a man of \\"about forty years of age, of average height, with a dark beard, a sprightly look and black eyes. He was a very good controversialist, straightforward, very pious, and pre-eminently a man of hard work.

His sentence this time was banishment and he was expelled on 15 September 1585 with some seventy-two other priests. Landing at Boulogne, he arrived at Rheims in France on 14 November 1585, but then immediately set out for England again. He was arrested at Winchester as he stepped out of his house, and this time taken to the Clink in London on 19 December 1585. This time, as was to be expected, he was not treated so lightly, especially since that year an Act had been passed which made it a capital offence to be a Catholic priest in England. The sentence of hanging, drawing and quartering was carried out at Tyburn, London on 8 October 1586. His fate was shared by two fellow priests, John Lowe and Robert Dibdale, and possibly his own brother, a layman. This latter fact is not certain and the forename is not in any case known.

In general, a dolly is a solid piece of metal, small enough to hold in one hand, with a curved or shaped face. Generally a dolly will have more than one surface, each with its own radius of curvature (much like a three-dimensional French curve), allowing the craftsman more flexibility in using the tool.  Common Types of Dollies  Most common types are called heel, toe, wedge or comma, general or track, and egg dollies. Egg dollies are often not included in hammer and dolly sets, but due to their unique shape they are very handy. * Heel- Has a long radius on one side and a flat on the other, hence they look like the heel of a shoe. One face is domed and that other is flat. * Toe- Has a short radius on one side and is twice as long as the heel. Similarly it has a domed and flat side also. * Wedge or \\"Comma\\"- It looks just like a comma, the narrow side makes it ideal for tight contours. * General Purpose or \\"Track\\"- Has many different surfaces and contours, easy to hold while dealing with substantial blows. * Egg- Rounded all over in different contours but on one side it does have straight edges and angles. A dolly can be used either as a hammer, shaping the metal to match the curve of the dolly, or as small anvil to provide a curved surface over which to dome or dish metal. They are commonly used to shape sheet metal in auto repair, especially in locations where it is difficult to swing a hammer. They can also be used as backers for upsetting metal. When used as a portable anvil, a dolly can be used to hold a rivet in position while it is being clenched with a \\"snapper\\". Such dollies are commonly cylindrical in shape, and rely on mass to work. The act of using it is known as holding up or holding on. Dollies can also be used in boat building, when clenching nails.

The term was coined by people who use mental health services in an attempt to empower those with mental health issues, usually considered a marginalized segment of society. The term suggests that there is a reciprocal contract between those who provide a service and those who use a service and that individuals have a choice in their treatment and that without them there could not exist mental health providers. History In the 1970s the term \\"patient\\" was most commonly used. Mental Health activists of the civil rights times recognized, as did many other groups seeking self-definition, that such labels are metaphors that reflect how identities are perceived and constructed (McDonald 206). In particular, in the mental health field they shape the nature of the relationship between the giver and receiver of psychiatric services, be it one with an emphasis on reciprocity or hierarchy (McLaughlin 2007). Users of psychiatric services repulsed the efforts of experts to define them and sought to develop ways to define themselves (Morrison 2000). In Australia, informal support groups of people who had recovered from episodes of mental ill health were formed during the first wave of moving patients out of psychiatric hospitals into the community in the 1960s. In the USA and other countries, radical movements to change service delivery and legislation began to be driven by consumers during the 1980s. Activists, such as Judi Chamberlain, pressed for alternatives to psychiatrist dominated and controlled systems of mental health provision. Chamberlain's On Our Own: Patient Controlled Alternatives to the Mental Health System (Chamberlain 1978) helped guide others intent on a more collaborative form of mental health healing. In the 1980s with some funding from NIMH, small experimental groups flourished. In 1985 at the First Alternatives Conference attendees agreed upon the term \\"consumer\\" reflecting the patients' choice of services (Bluebird). The term also implied assumptions of rationality and ability to make choices in one's own best interests rather than be a passive incapacitated recipient of \\"expert\\" attention (McDonald 2006). In the 1990s many consumer groups were formed, such as Self Help Clearing House and the National Empowerment Center. They continued to press for more peer involvement in alternatives treatments, pointing out that peers support and comfort, in contrast to therapists who attempt to change the behavior and thinking patterns of consumers (Bluebird). Contemporary Usage Today, the word mental health consumer has expanded in the popular usage of consumers themselves to include anyone who has received mental health services in the past, anyone who has a behavioral health diagnosis, or simply anyone who has experienced a mental or behavioral disorder. Other terms sometimes used by members of this community for empowerment through positive self-identification include \\"peers,\\" \\"people with mental health disabilities,\\" \\"psychiatric survivors,\\" \\"users,\\" individuals with \\"lived experience\\" and \\"ex-patients.\\" (See the Psychiatric survivors movement for more information). The term \\"service users,\\" is commonly used in the U.K. In the U.S. \\"consumer\\" is most frequently used by ex-patients and users of psychiatric and alternative services. One can view this term, \\"consumer,\\" neutrally as a person who receives psychological services, perhaps from a psychologist, a psychiatrist or a social worker. It can be impersonal term relating to the use in the health sector of a large economy. It suggests that the consumer expects to have some influence on service delivery and provides feedback to the provider. Used in its more activist sense, consumer groups aim to correct perceived problems in mental health services and to promote consultation with consumers. Consumer theory was devised to interpret the special relationship between a service provider and service user in the context of mental health. Consumer theory examines the consequences and sociological meaning of the relationship.

It is not just report generation from collected data; instead it is a method to internalize and improve an organization‚Äôs commitment to sustainable development in a way that can be demonstrated to both internal and external stakeholders.Global Reporting Initiative  History  Corporate sustainability reporting has a history going back to environmental reporting. The first environmental reports were published in the late 1980s by companies in the chemical industry which had serious image problems. The other group of early reporters was a group of committed small and medium-sized businesses with very advanced environmental management systems. Additionally, the tobacco industry adopted such reporting much earlier than the rest of the corporate world, in an attempt to attract new investors at a time when ethical investing was becoming increasingly popular. Non-financial reporting, such as sustainability and CSR reporting, is a fairly recent trend which has expanded over the last twenty years. Many companies now produce an annual sustainability report and there are a wide array of ratings and standards around. There are a variety of reasons that companies choose to produce these reports, but at their core they are intended to be \\"vessels of transparency and accountability.\\" Often they also intended to improve internal processes, engage stakeholders and persuade investors. An issue in sustainability reporting is whether and how much data related to environmental, social and corporate governance practices and impacts must be disclosed. As a matter of law, in the United States, the materiality principles controls whether a publicly traded corporation must disclose certain information, that is: ‚Äúa fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that the . . . fact would have been viewed by a reasonable investor as having significantly altered the ‚Äòtotal mix‚Äô of information available.‚Äù In this case, some authors have examined and applied several factors (including the percentages of managed investment assets that are screened for ESG criteria, plus the fact that over 90% of large publicly traded companies publish ESG data) and concluded that ESG data qualifies as being material. It has also been suggested that other organizations that issue securities may also be well-advised to also engage in sustainability reporting. In 2015, the United Nations set 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and SDG 12, Target 12.6 specifically encourages \\"companies to adopt sustainable practices and sustainability reporting\\".United Nations (2017) Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 6 July 2017, Work of the Statistical Commission pertaining to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (A/RES/71/313)  Initiatives  Organizations can improve their sustainability performance by measuring (EthicalQuote (CEQ)), monitoring and reporting on it, helping them have a positive impact on society, the economy, and a sustainable future. The key drivers for the quality of sustainability reports are the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), (ACCA) award schemes or rankings. The GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines enable all organizations worldwide to assess their sustainability performance and disclose the results in a similar way to financial reporting.

After Hurricane Katrina, the Archdiocese of New Orleans realized the need for a temporary school for displaced students from Catholic high schools in the devastated New Orleans area. Archbishop Rummel High School in Metairie, LA, volunteered to take on the monumental task of accepting 1300 more students to their campus. Rummel set up a platooning schedule, with traditional Rummel Students going from 6:30 to 12:30 every morning and Transition students going from 1:30 to 6:00 PM. Thus Archbishop Rummel Transition School (ARTS or Rummel T) was born. The school featured students from various Catholic schools along the Gulf Coast, including St. Stanislaus in Bay St. Louis, MS. A majority of the students were from Mount Carmel Academy, Dominican High School, Brother Martin High School, and Ursuline Academy. Academics Rummel T used a rotating schedule with three periods a day, eighty minutes each. Students took six classes, and the rotation was Day A (Periods 1,2,3) and Day B (Periods 4,5,6). Student's schedules were geared towards making the transition back to their home schools as easily as possible. Honors courses were available; however, no AP classes were scheduled, much to the dismay of AP students. Athletics Rummel T fielded several girls athletic teams, including volleyball, basketball, swimming, and cross country. The \\"Lady Raiders\\" advanced to third in the Division I state playoffs in volleyball, 4th in State in cross country, and 6th in State in swimming. Extracurriculars Rummel T also fielded an Academic Games squad. The day school also opened many of its activities to the Transition school; most notable was the campus ministry nights once a month. Also, a dance committee was formed to organize the \\"Homegoing Dance.\\" The committee hosted bakesales and even a day of Christmas Caroling to help fund the dance, which featured two local bands. Announcements A signature element of Rummel T was the afternoon announcements held at the beginning and end of each day. The day started with a traditional Rummel prayer that includes the tagline \\"Thank God Almighty I'm A Raider.\\" This became a running joke with the Transition students and even made it on one of the two Rummel T t-shirt designs. Every so often, \\"Mr. Gabe\\" would be joined by students making fools of themselves on the announcements, or Mr. Gabriel would poke fun at his fellow administrators. On one memorable occasion, an administrator scolded the ladies for not wearing their uniform socks appropriately, stating that their visible ankles were distracting the male students. Of note, this co-ed high school experience was new to most students, who otherwise attended single-sex schools. Media coverage Rummel T constantly made the news, as local news crews made expos√© after expos√© on life after Katrina, and the Archdiocese used the school to hold many of its press conferences. Louisiana governor (then a U.S. Representative) Bobby Jindal even paid a visit to the school to speak with the students. External links *Web page for the Rummel Raiders.

West Dallas is served by the Dallas West Branch of the Dallas Public Library at 2332 Singleton Blvd. Environmental history West Dallas originated as a community on the outskirts of Dallas. The community was founded in 1886. In 1909 the Thomas A. Edison School was built. Murphy Metals (later known as RSR Corporation), a secondary lead smelter processing company, opened a facility and in 1934 started operations at the site. The process of secondary lead smelting melts the collected lead materials or, lead scrap, into metallic lead that can then be used to cast into molds. Significant lead emissions can occur from poorly controlled refining, casting, and drossing operations. The city of Dallas annexed West Dallas into the city limits in 1954. Before that year, many residents lived in an area lacking the basic services because they resided outside the city lines. Then in 1956 a 3,500-unit public housing complex was to be built just north of the RSR lead smelter facility. The southern edge of the public housing complex was located from the lead smelter's property line. In 1968 the City of Dallas enacted an ordinance prohibiting more than 5 micrograms per cubic meter over a 30-day period. This act went unenforced because in the 1960s RSR Corp West Dallas facility released more than 269 tons of lead particles into the air each year. During that time few residents could afford the luxury of air conditioning, so in the summers they kept their doors and windows open to combat the heat, directly exposing them to the toxins in the air, even in their own homes. It wasn‚Äôt until 1972 that Dallas officials learned that lead could be finding its way into the bloodstreams of children who lived in West Dallas and the bordering community of East Oak Cliff. The Dallas Health Department then conducted a study of their own. They found children living near smelters had elevated levels of lead. Lead was able to reach their bloodstream through the air, soil and households in and around their living environments. In areas near smelters children had a 36 percent increase in blood lead levels. The city failed to take immediate action and in 1974 the city sued local smelters. The company agreed to pay $35,000 and install new pollution control equipment. This did little to resolve the problem because in 1983 the pollution equipment had still not been installed at RSR Corp. Pressure from the community on government agencies was beginning to rise. A citizens group appointed by the Dallas City Council, The Dallas Alliance Environmental Task Force, has this to say in a 1983 study > ‚ÄúWe believe the city had missed many opportunities to serve and protect the > community at large and two neighborhoods in particular in relation to the > lead problem we now address. It is clear that the State and Federal > governments have also failed in their opportunity to regulate and industry > of this type with regard to the general welfare of citizens.‚Äù Before that in 1981 public concern and pressure were raised after the West Dallas Boys Club had to suspend outside activity after one soil test showed the soil contained 36 times the level considered dangerous for children. The Club was later forced to close in 1983 due to high lead levels related to the years of operations of the RSR secondary lead smelter operation. After lengthy test and lawsuits and delayed clean-up action, partially government agencies fault, RSR Corp. was ordered by the Dallas Board of Adjusters to close the West Dallas facility. In the summer of 1985 an out-of-court settlement was reached between RSR Corp. and Fred Baron who represented 370 children and 40 property owners who were all affected by the lead emitted from RSR. The settlement was for 20 million dollars. However, with this settlement the land that the old RSR Corp facility used to sit on still contained large amounts of lead contamination dangerous to all ages of people. On May 1993 a proposal of the RSR Corp. site in West Dallas was sent to the National Priorities List, also named a Superfund site President Clinton‚Äôs administration then brought more publicity to the issue when in November 1993 an article written in The Progressive had this to say > ‚ÄúWest Dallas residents celebrated when the Clinton Administration declared > last May that they live in the largest lead-contaminated Superfund site in > the United States. Portions of one of the nation's biggest housing projects > and five schools, all located within five square miles of a now-defunct lead > smelter, are slated for cleanup (although Federal Environmental Protection > Agency records indicate as much as sixteen square miles of West Dallas are > contaminated).\\" For the residents who had been pushing for years and decades to solve the problem could lay their case to rest on September 28, 1994, when the EPA signed Preliminary Close Out Report for the RSR Corp. Superfund site stating all clean-up for all the units had been completed. The EPA then signed a Ready For Reuse document in May 2005 declaring the site ready for reuse or redevelopment The EPA reported that the clean-up resulted in direct lower lead blood leaves of children. The community also benefited by having 400 properties of commercial property eliminated of contamination.

Each main rotor is mounted on a vertical mast over the top of the helicopter, as opposed to a helicopter tail rotor, which connects through a combination of drive shaft(s) and gearboxes along the tail boom. The blade pitch is typically controlled by a swashplate connected to the helicopter flight controls. Helicopters are one example of rotary-wing aircraft (rotorcraft). The name is derived from the Greek words helix, helik-, meaning spiral; and pteron meaning wing. Design principles =Overview= The helicopter rotor is powered by the engine, through the transmission, to the rotating mast. The mast is a cylindrical metal shaft that extends upward from‚Äîand is driven by‚Äîthe transmission. At the top of the mast is the attachment point (colloquially called a Jesus nut) for the rotor blades called the hub.

Accessed: 10 April 2014. =Blades= The blades of a helicopter are long, narrow airfoils with a high aspect ratio, a shape that minimizes drag from tip vortices (see the wings of a glider for comparison). They generally contain a degree of washout that reduces the lift generated at the tips, where the airflow is fastest and vortex generation would be a significant problem. Rotor blades are made out of various materials, including aluminium, composite structure, and steel or titanium, with abrasion shields along the leading edge. Rotorcraft blades are traditionally passive; however, some helicopters include active components on their blades. The Kaman K-MAX uses trailing edge flaps for blade pitch control and the Hiller YH-32 Hornet was powered by ramjets mounted on the blade ends. , research into active blade control through trailing edge flaps is underway.Mangeot et al. New actuators for aerospace Noliac. Retrieved: 28 September 2010. Tips of some helicopter blades can be specially designed to reduce turbulence and noise and to provide more efficient flying. An example of such tips are the tips of the BERP rotors created during the British Experimental Rotor Programme. =Hub= The simple rotor of a Robinson R22 Robinson R44 rotor head The rotor head of a Sikorsky S-92 The simple rotor of a Robinson R22 showing (from the top): * The following are driven by the link rods from the rotating part of the swashplate. ** Pitch hinges, allowing the blades to twist about the axis extending from blade root to blade tip. * Teeter hinge, allowing one blade to rise vertically while the other falls vertically.

The basis of his design permitted successful helicopter development. In a fully articulated rotor system, each rotor blade is attached to the rotor hub through a series of hinges that let the blade move independently of the others. These rotor systems usually have three or more blades. The blades are allowed to flap, feather, and lead or lag independently of each other. The horizontal hinge, called the flapping hinge, allows the blade to move up and down. This movement is called flapping and is designed to compensate for dissymmetry of lift. The flapping hinge may be located at varying distances from the rotor hub, and there may be more than one hinge. The vertical hinge, called the lead-lag hinge or drag hinge, allows the blade to move back and forth. This movement is called lead-lag, dragging, or hunting. Dampers are usually used to prevent excess back and forth movement around the drag hinge. The purpose of the drag hinge and dampers is to compensate for acceleration and deceleration caused by the difference in drag experienced by the advancing and retreating blades. Later models have switched from using traditional bearings to elastomeric bearings. Elastomeric bearings are naturally fail-safe and their wear is gradual and visible. The metal-to-metal contact of older bearings and the need for lubrication is eliminated in this design. The third hinge in the fully articulated system is called the feathering hinge about the feathering axis. This hinge is responsible for the change in pitch of rotor blades excited via pilot input to the collective or cyclic. A variation of the fully articulated system is the soft-in-plane rotor system. This type of rotor can be found on several aircraft produced by Bell Helicopter, such as the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior. This system is similar to the fully articulated type in that each blade has the ability to lead/lag and hunt independently of the other blades. The difference between a fully articulated system and soft-in-plane system is that the soft-in-plane system utilises a composite yoke. This yoke is attached to the mast and runs through the blade grips between the blades and the shear bearing inside the grip. This yoke does transfer some movement of one blade to another, usually opposing blades. While this is not fully articulated, the flight characteristics are very similar and maintenance time and cost are reduced.  Rigid  The term \\"rigid rotor\\" usually refers to a hingeless rotor systemLandis, Tony and Jenkins, Dennis R. Lockheed AH-56A Cheyenne - WarbirdTech Volume 27, p.5. Specialty Press, 2000. . with blades flexibly attached to the hub. Irv Culver of Lockheed developed one of the first rigid rotors, which was tested and developed on a series of helicopters in the 1960s and 1970s. In a rigid rotor system, each blade flaps and drags about flexible sections of the root. A rigid rotor system is mechanically simpler than a fully articulated rotor system. Loads from flapping and lead/lag forces are accommodated through rotor blades flexing, rather than through hinges. By flexing, the blades themselves compensate for the forces that previously required rugged hinges. The result is a rotor system that has less lag in control response because of the large hub moment typically generated.Connor, R. Lockheed CL-475\\". Smithsonian National Air & Space Museum.

The rigid rotor system thus eliminates the danger of mast bumping inherent in semirigid rotors.Cox, Taylor. \\"Blades and Lift\\". Helis.com. Retrieved: 10 March 2007.  Semirigid  Semirigid rotor system The semirigid rotor can also be referred to as a teetering or seesaw rotor. This system is normally composed of two blades that meet just under a common flapping or teetering hinge at the rotor shaft. This allows the blades to flap together in opposite motions like a seesaw. This underslinging of the blades below the teetering hinge, combined with an adequate dihedral or coning angle on the blades, minimizes variations in the radius of each blade's center of mass from the axis of rotation as the rotor turns, which in turn reduces the stress on the blades from lead and lag forces caused by the Coriolis effect. Secondary flapping hinges may also be provided to provide sufficient flexibility to minimize bouncing. Feathering is accomplished by the feathering hinge at the blade root, which allows changes to the pitch angle of the blade.  Combination  Modern rotor systems may use the combined principles of the rotor systems mentioned above. Some rotor hubs incorporate a flexible hub, which allows for blade bending (flexing) without the need for bearings or hinges. These systems, called \\"flexures\\",FAA Flight Standards Service 2001 are usually constructed from composite material. Elastomeric bearings may also be used in place of conventional roller bearings. Elastomeric bearings are constructed from a rubber type material and provide limited movement that is perfectly suited for helicopter applications. Flexures and elastomeric bearings require no lubrication and, therefore, require less maintenance. They also absorb vibration, which means less fatigue and longer service life for the helicopter components. Swash plate Controls vary the pitch of the main rotor blades cyclically throughout rotation. The pilot uses this to control the direction of the rotor thrust vector, which defines the part of the rotor disc where the maximum thrust develops. Collective pitch varies the magnitude of rotor thrust by increasing or decreasing thrust over the whole rotor disc at the same time. These blade pitch variations are controlled by tilting, raising, or lowering the swash plate with the flight controls. The vast majority of helicopters maintain a constant rotor speed (RPM) during flight, leaving the angle of attack of the blades as the sole means of adjusting thrust from the rotor. The swash plate is two concentric disks or plates. One plate rotates with the mast, connected by idle links, while the other does not rotate. The rotating plate is also connected to the individual blades through pitch links and pitch horns. The non-rotating plate is connected to links that are manipulated by pilot controls‚Äîspecifically, the collective and cyclic controls. The swash plate can shift vertically and tilt. Through shifting and tilting, the non-rotating plate controls the rotating plate, which in turn controls the individual blade pitch. Flybar (stabilizer bar) A number of engineers, among them Arthur M. Young in the U.S. and radio-control aeromodeler Dieter Schl√ºter in Germany, found that flight stability for helicopters could be achieved with a stabilizer bar, or flybar. The flybar has a weight or paddle (or both for added stability on smaller helicopters) at each end to maintain a constant plane of rotation. Through mechanical linkages, the stable rotation of the bar mixes with the swashplate movement to damp internal (steering) as well as external (wind) forces on the rotor. This makes it easier for the pilot to maintain control of the aircraft. Stanley Hiller arrived at a similar method to improve stability by adding short stubby airfoils, or paddles, at each end. However, Hiller's \\"Rotormatic\\" system also delivered cyclic control inputs to the main rotor as a sort of control rotor, and the paddles provided the added stability by damping the effects of external forces on the rotor. The Lockheed rotor system used a control gyro, similar in principle to that of the Bell stabilizer bar, but designed for both hands-off stability and rapid control response of the hingeless rotor system. In fly-by-wire helicopters or RC models, a microcontroller with gyroscope sensors and a Venturi sensor can replace the stabilizer. This flybar-less design has the advantage of easy reconfiguration and fewer mechanical parts. Even though a real RC helicopter with flybar must keep a gyroscope on each axis. =Slowed rotor= Most helicopter rotors spin at constant speed. However slowing the rotor in some situations can bring benefits. As forward speed increases, the advancing rotor tip speed soon approaches the speed of sound. To reduce the problem, the speed of rotation may be slowed, allowing the helicopter to fly faster. To adjust the rotor lift at slower speeds, in a conventional design the rotor blades' angle of attack is reduced via a collective pitch control. Slowing the rotor instead can reduce drag during this phase of flight and thus improve fuel economy. Rotor configurations Most helicopters have a single main rotor but require a separate rotor to overcome torque. This is accomplished through a variable- pitch antitorque rotor or tail rotor. This is the design that Igor Sikorsky settled on for his VS-300 helicopter, and it has become the recognized convention for helicopter design, although designs do vary. When viewed from above, the vast majority of helicopter rotors turn counter-clockwise; the rotors of French and Russian helicopters turn clockwise. =Single main rotor= Antitorque: Torque effect on a helicopter With a single main rotor helicopter, the creation of torque as the engine turns the rotor creates a torque effect that causes the body of the helicopter to turn in the opposite direction of the rotor. To eliminate this effect, some sort of antitorque control must be used with a sufficient margin of power available to allow the helicopter to maintain its heading and provide yaw control. The three most common controls used today are the tail rotor, Eurocopter's Fenestron (also called a fantail), and MD Helicopters' NOTAR. Tail rotor Tail rotor of an SA 330 Puma The tail rotor is a smaller rotor mounted so that it rotates vertically or near-vertically at the end of the tail of a traditional single- rotor helicopter. The tail rotor's position and distance from the centre of gravity allow it to develop thrust in a direction opposite of the main rotor's rotation to counter the torque effect created by the main rotor. Tail rotors are simpler than main rotors since they require only collective changes in pitch to vary thrust. The pitch of the tail rotor blades is adjustable by the pilot via the anti-torque pedals, which also provide directional control by allowing the pilot to rotate the helicopter around its vertical axis, thereby changing the direction the craft is pointed. Ducted fan Fenestron on an EC 120B Fenestron and FANTAILAlpman, Emre and Long, Lyle N. \\"Understanding Ducted-Rotor Antitorque and Directional Control: Characteristics Part II: Unsteady Simulations.\\" Journal of Aircraft Vol. 41, No. 6, November‚ÄìDecember 2004. are trademarks for a ducted fan mounted at the end of the tail boom of the helicopter and used in place of a tail rotor. Ducted fans have between eight and eighteen blades arranged with irregular spacing so that the noise is distributed over different frequencies. The housing is integral with the aircraft skin and allows a high rotational speed; therefore, a ducted fan can have a smaller size than a conventional tail rotor. The Fenestron was used for the first time at the end of the 1960s on the second experimental model of Sud Aviation's SA 340 and produced on the later model A√©rospatiale SA 341 Gazelle. Besides Eurocopter and its predecessors, a ducted fan tail rotor was also used on the canceled military helicopter project, the United States Army's RAH-66 Comanche, as the FANTAIL. NOTAR Diagram showing the movement of air through the NOTAR system NOTAR, an acronym for NO TAil Rotor, is a helicopter anti-torque system that eliminates the use of the tail rotor on a helicopter. Although the concept took some time to refine, the NOTAR system is simple in theory and provides antitorque the same way a wing develops lift by using the CoandƒÉ effect.Frawley 2003, p. 151. A variable pitch fan is enclosed in the aft fuselage section immediately forward of the tail boom and is driven by the main rotor transmission. To provide the sideways force to counteract the clockwise torque produced by a counterclockwise-spinning main rotor (as seen from above the main rotor), the variable-pitch fan forces low pressure air through two slots on the right side of the tailboom, causing the downwash from the main rotor to hug the tailboom, producing lift and thus a measure of antitorque proportional to the amount of airflow from the rotorwash. This is augmented by a direct jet thruster which also provides directional yaw control, with the presence of a fixed-surface empennage near the end of the tail, incorporating vertical stabilizers. Development of the NOTAR system dates back to 1975 when engineers at Hughes Helicopters began concept development work. In December 1981, Hughes flew an OH-6A fitted with NOTAR for the first time.\\"NOTAR Fleet Marks 500,000 Flight Hours\\". American Helicopter Society. Retrieved: 25 February 2007. A more heavily modified prototype demonstrator first flew in March 1986 and successfully completed an advanced flight-test program, validating the system for future application in helicopter design.\\"The Boeing Logbook: 1983-1987\\". Boeing.com. Retrieved: 25 February 2007. There are currently three production helicopters that incorporate the NOTAR design, all produced by MD Helicopters. This antitorque design also improves safety by eliminating the possibility of personnel walking into the tail rotor. A predecessor (of sorts) to this system existed in the form of Great Britain's Cierva W.9 helicopter, a late 1940s aircraft using the cooling fan from its piston engine to push air through a nozzle built into the tailboom to counteract rotor-torque. Tip jets The main rotor may be driven by tip jets. Such a system may be powered by high pressure air provided by a compressor. The air may or may not be mixed with fuel and burnt in ram-jets, pulse-jets, or rockets. Though this method is simple and eliminates torque reaction, prototypes that have been built are less fuel efficient than conventional helicopters. Except for tip jets driven by unburnt compressed air, very high noise levels is the single most important reason why tip jet powered rotors have not gained wide acceptance. However, research into noise suppression is ongoing and may help make this system viable. There are several examples of tip jet powered rotorcraft. The Percival P.74 was under- powered and could not fly. The Hiller YH-32 Hornet had good lifting capability but performed poorly otherwise. Other aircraft used auxiliary thrust for translational flight so that the tip jets could be shut down while the rotor autorotated. The experimental Fairey Jet Gyrodyne, 48-seat Fairey Rotodyne passenger prototypes and McDonnell XV-1 compound gyroplanes flew well using this method. Perhaps the most unusual design of this type was the Rotary Rocket Roton ATV, which was originally envisioned to take off using a rocket- tipped rotor. The French Sud-Ouest Djinn used unburnt compressed air to drive the rotor, which minimized noise and helped it become the only tip jet driven rotor helicopter to enter production. The Hughes XH-17 had a tip jet-driven rotor, which remains the largest rotor ever fitted to a helicopter. =Twin rotors= Twin rotors turn in opposite directions to counteract the torque effect on the aircraft without relying on an antitorque tail rotor. This lets the aircraft apply the power that would have driven a tail rotor to the main rotors, increasing lifting capacity. Primarily, three common configurations use the counterrotating effect on rotorcraft. Tandem rotors are two rotors‚Äîone mounted behind the other. Coaxial rotors are two rotors mounted one above the other on the same axis. Intermeshing rotors are two rotors mounted close to each other at a sufficient angle to let the rotors intermesh over the top of the aircraft. Another configuration‚Äîfound on tiltrotors and some early helicopters‚Äîis called transverse rotors, where a pair of rotors are mounted at each end of a wing-type structure or outrigger. Tandem Boeing CH-47 Chinook Tandem rotors are two horizontal main rotor assemblies mounted one behind the other. Tandem rotors achieve pitch attitude changes to accelerate and decelerate the helicopter through a process called cyclic pitch. To pitch forward and accelerate, both rotors increase the pitch at the rear and reduce the pitch at the front (cyclic) keeping torque the same on both rotors, flying sideways is achieved by increasing the pitch on one side and reducing pitch on the other. Yaw control develops through opposing cyclic pitch in each rotor. To pivot right, the front rotor tilts right and the rear rotor tilts left. To pivot left, the front rotor tilts left and the rear rotor tilts right. All rotor power contributes to lift, and it is simpler to handle changes in the center of gravity fore-aft. However, it requires the expense of two large rotors rather than the more common one large main rotor and a much smaller tail rotor. The Boeing CH-47 Chinook is the most common tandem rotor helicopter. Coaxial Kamov Ka-50 of the Russian Air Force, with coaxial rotors Coaxial rotors are a pair of rotors mounted one above the other on the same shaft and turning in opposite directions. The advantage of the coaxial rotor is that, in forward flight, the lift provided by the advancing halves of each rotor compensates for the retreating half of the other, eliminating one of the key effects of dissymmetry of lift: retreating blade stall. However, other design considerations plague coaxial rotors. There is an increased mechanical complexity of the rotor system because it requires linkages and swashplates for two rotor systems. Also, because the rotors must rotate in opposite directions, the mast is more complex, and control linkages for pitch changes to the upper rotor system must pass through the lower rotor system. Intermeshing HH-43 Huskie Intermeshing rotors on a helicopter are a set of two rotors turning in opposite directions with each rotor mast mounted on the helicopter with a slight angle to the other so that the blades intermesh without colliding. This configuration is sometimes referred to as a synchropter. Intermeshing rotors have high stability and powerful lifting capability. The arrangement was pioneered in Nazi Germany in 1939 with Anton Flettner's successful Flettner Fl 265 design, and later placed in limited production as the successful Flettner Fl 282 Kolibri, used by the German Kriegsmarine in small numbers (24 airframes produced) as an experimental light anti-submarine warfare helicopter. During the Cold War, an American company, Kaman Aircraft, produced the HH-43 Huskie for USAF firefighting and rescue missions. The latest Kaman model, the Kaman K-MAX, is a dedicated sky crane design. Transverse Mi-12 Transverse rotors are mounted on the end of wings or outriggers perpendicular to the body of the aircraft. Similar to tandem rotors and intermeshing rotors, the transverse rotor also uses differential collective pitch. But like the intermeshing rotors, the transverse rotors use the concept for changes in the roll attitude of the rotorcraft. This configuration is found on two of the first viable helicopters, the Focke-Wulf Fw 61 and the Focke-Achgelis Fa 223, as well as the world's largest helicopter ever built, the Mil Mi-12. It is also the configuration found on tiltrotors such as the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey and the AgustaWestland AW609. = Quad rotor = Etienne Oehmichen, Paris, France, 1921 Source de Bothezat helicopter, 1923 photo A quad rotor or quadrotor comprises four rotors in an \\"X\\" configuration. Rotors to the left and right are in a transverse configuration while those in the front and to the rear are in a tandem configuration. An advantage of quad rotors on small aircraft such as drones is the opportunity for mechanical simplicity. A quadcopter using electric motors and fixed-pitch rotors has only four moving parts. Pitch, yaw and roll can be controlled by changing the relative lift of different rotor pairs without changing total lift.Markus Waibel. \\"Quadcopter, Hexacopter, Octocopter ... UAVs\\". IEEE Spectrum, 2010-02-19. The two families of airfoils are * symmetrical airfoils * asymmetrical airfoils Symmetrical blades are very stable, which helps keep blade twisting and flight control loads to a minimum. This stability is achieved by keeping the center of pressure virtually unchanged as the angle of attack changes. Center of pressure is the imaginary point on the chord line where the resultant of all aerodynamic forces are considered to be concentrated. Today, designers use thinner airfoils and obtain the required rigidity by using composite materials. In addition, some airfoils are asymmetrical in design, meaning the upper and lower surface do not have the same camber. Normally these airfoils would not be as stable, but this can be corrected by bending the trailing edge to produce the same characteristics as symmetrical airfoils. This is called \\"reflexing.\\" Using this type of rotor blade allows the rotor system to operate at higher forward speeds. One of the reasons an asymmetrical rotor blade is not as stable is that the center of pressure changes with changes in angle of attack. When the center of pressure lifting force is behind the pivot point on a rotor blade, it tends to cause the rotor disc to pitch up. As the angle of attack increases, the center of pressure moves forward. If it moves ahead of the pivot point, the pitch of the rotor disc decreases. Since the angle of attack of the rotor blades is constantly changing during each cycle of rotation, the blades tend to flap, feather, lead, and lag to a greater degree.\\"Rotorcraft Flying Handbook\\", page 2-1. FAA Limitations and hazards Helicopters with teetering rotors‚Äîfor example the two-blade system on the Bell, Robinson and others‚Äîmust not be subjected to a low-g condition because such rotor systems do not control the fuselage attitude. This can result in the fuselage assuming an attitude controlled by momentum and tail rotor thrust that causes the tail boom to intersect the main rotor tip-path plane or result in the blade roots contacting the main rotor drive shaft, causing the blades to separate from the hub (mast bumping). =Abrasion in sandy environments= Kopp‚ÄìEtchells effect When operating in sandy environments, sand hitting the moving rotor blades erodes their surface. This can damage the rotors and presents serious and costly maintenance problems. Abrasion strips on helicopter rotor blades are made of metal, often titanium or nickel, which are very hard, but less hard than sand. When a helicopter flies low to the ground in desert environments, sand striking the rotor blade can cause erosion. At night, sand hitting the metal abrasion strip causes a visible corona or halo around the rotor blades. The effect is caused by the pyrophoric oxidation of eroded particles, and by triboluminescence whereby impact with the sand particles produces photoluminesce. The combat photographer and journalist Michael Yon observed the effect while accompanying U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan. When he discovered that the effect had no name he coined the name Kopp‚ÄìEtchells effect after two soldiers who had died in the war, one American and one British. History A decorated Japanese taketombo bamboo-copter. The toy consists of a rotor attached to a stick. The first autogyro to fly successfully in 1923, invented by Juan de la Cierva. The use of a rotor for vertical flight has existed since 400 BC in the form of the bamboo-copter, an ancient Chinese toy.Leishman, J. Gordon. Principles of Helicopter Aerodynamics. Cambridge aerospace series, 18. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006. . pp. 7-9. Web extract The bamboo-copter is spun by rolling a stick attached to a rotor. The spinning creates lift, and the toy flies when released. The philosopher Ge Hong's book the Baopuzi (Master Who Embraces Simplicity), written around 317, describes the apocryphal use of a possible rotor in aircraft: \\"Some have made flying cars [feiche È£õËªä] with wood from the inner part of the jujube tree, using ox- leather (straps) fastened to returning blades so as to set the machine in motion.\\"Joseph Needham (1965), Science and civilisation in China: Physics and physical technology, mechanical engineering Volume 4, Part 2, page 583-587. Leonardo da Vinci designed a machine known as an \\"aerial screw\\" with a rotor based on a water screw. The Russian polymath Mikhail Lomonosov developed a rotor based on the Chinese toy. The French naturalist Christian de Launoy constructed his rotor out of turkey feathers. Sir George Cayley, inspired by the Chinese toy in his childhood, created multiple vertical flight machines with rotors made of tin sheets. Alphonse P√©naud would later develop the coaxial rotor model helicopter toys in 1870, powered by rubber bands. One of these toys, given as a gift by their father, would inspire the Wright brothers to pursue the dream of flight. Before development of powered helicopters in the mid 20th century, autogyro pioneer Juan de la Cierva researched and developed many of the fundamentals of the rotor. De la Cierva is credited with successful development of multi-bladed, fully articulated rotor systems. This system, in its various modified forms, is the basis of most multi-bladed helicopter rotor systems. The first successful attempt at a single-lift rotor helicopter design used a four-blade main rotor, as designed by Soviet aeronautical engineers Boris N. Yuriev and Alexei M. Cheremukhin, both working at the Tsentralniy Aerogidrodinamicheskiy Institut (TsAGI, the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute) near Moscow in the early 1930s. Their TsAGI 1-EA helicopter was able to fly in low altitude testing in 1931‚Äì32, with Cheremukhin flying it as high as 605 meters (1,985 ft) by mid-August 1932.video.Savine, Alexandre. \\"TsAGI 1-EA.\\" ctrl-c.liu.se, 24 March 1997. Retrieved 12 December 2010. In the 1930s, Arthur Young improved the stability of two-bladed rotor systems with the introduction of a stabilizer bar. This system was used in several Bell and Hiller helicopter models. The Hiller system variant using airfoiled paddles at the flybar's ends has been used in many of the earliest designs of remote control model helicopters, from their 1970s origins onwards to the very early 21st century. In the late 1940s, the making of helicopter rotor blades was a job that inspired John T. Parsons to be a pioneer of numerical control (NC). NC and CNC turned out to be an important new technology that later affected all machining industries.

Early life Peale was born in Chestertown, Maryland, the second child, after Charles, of Charles Peale (1709‚Äì1750) and Margaret Triggs (1709‚Äì1791). His father died when he was an infant, and the family moved to Annapolis. In 1762, he began to serve apprenticeships there, first in a saddlery and later in a cabinetmaking shop. After his brother Charles returned from London in 1769, where he had studied with Benjamin West, Peale served as his assistant and learned how to paint. Career Still Life with Vegetables Peale worked in his brother's studio until January 14, 1776, when he accepted a commission in the Continental Army as an ensign in William Smallwood's regiment. Within three months he was promoted to captain, and during the next three years fought in the battles of Long Island, White Plains, Trenton, Brandywine, Germantown, Princeton, and Monmouth. He resigned his army commission in 1779, and moved to Philadelphia to live with his brother. (One notable later collaboration, however, was in 1788 to make floats for Philadelphia's Federal Procession in honor of the newly drafted United States Constitution). At the outset of his career Peale painted portraits and still-life, and by the mid-1780s had established his reputation. At about this time, however, Charles turned over his own miniature portrait practice to him, and throughout the 1790s and early 19th century Peale devoted himself to miniature painting. Much of this work was watercolor on ivory. In 1795 Peale exhibited a still life of fruit along with nine miniatures and his family portrait at the Columbianum, a short-lived art academy in Philadelphia. Around 1810, as Peale's eyesight began to weaken, he gave up painting miniatures to turn to large portraits and still-life subjects that were greatly admired and widely exhibited in Philadelphia, Boston, and Baltimore. The total number of Peale's landscape paintings remains unknown, but he executed more than 200 watercolor miniatures on ivory, perhaps 100 still-life paintings, fewer than 70 oil portraits, and at least 8 history paintings. Personal life Margaretta Angelica Peale, one of the painter's daughters In 1782 he married Mary Claypoole (1753-1828), a daughter of James Claypoole and sister of portrait painter James Claypoole Jr., after which he established his own household and artistic career. Together, Mary and James were the parents of seven children, three of whom became accomplished painters in their own right, including:The Claypoole Family * Maria Claypoole Peale (1787‚Äì1866) also became a painter of still lifes, though of less distinction than her sisters. * James Peale Jr. (1789‚Äì1876), who married his cousin, Sophonisba Peale (1801‚Äì1878), daughter of Raphaelle Peale. * Anna Claypoole Peale (1791‚Äì1878), a miniaturist and still-life painter * Margaretta Angelica Peale (1796‚Äì1882), painter of trompe l‚Äôoeil subjects and tabletop fruit * Sarah Miriam Peale (1800‚Äì1885), a portraitist and still-life painter * Jane Ramsay Peale * Eleanor Peale.

It was developed by research scientists John Bardeen and Walter Brattain at Bell Laboratories in December 1947. They worked in a group led by physicist William Shockley. The group had been working together on experiments and theories of electric field effects in solid state materials, with the aim of replacing vacuum tubes with a smaller device that consumed less power. The critical experiment, carried out on December 16, 1947, consisted of a block of germanium, a semiconductor, with two very closely spaced gold contacts held against it by a spring. Brattain attached a small strip of gold foil over the point of a plastic triangle ‚Äî a configuration which is essentially a point-contact diode. He then carefully sliced through the gold at the tip of the triangle. This produced two electrically isolated gold contacts very close to each other. An early model of a transistor The piece of germanium used had a surface layer with an excess of electrons. When an electric signal traveled in through the gold foil, it injected holes (points which lack electrons). This created a thin layer which had a scarcity of electrons. A small positive current applied to one of the two contacts had an influence on the current which flowed between the other contact and the base upon which the block of germanium was mounted. In fact, a small change in the first contact current caused a greater change in the second contact current, thus it was an amplifier. The first contact is the \\"emitter\\" and the second contact is the \\"collector\\". The low-current input terminal into the point-contact transistor is the emitter, while the output high current terminals are the base and collector. This differs from the later type of bipolar junction transistor invented in 1951 that operates as transistors still do, with the low current input terminal as the base and the two high current output terminals are the emitter and collector. The point- contact transistor was commercialized and sold by Western Electric and others but was soon superseded by the bipolar junction transistor, which was easier to manufacture and more rugged. Forming A model of the first commercially available point-contact transistor While point-contact transistors usually worked fine when the metal contacts were simply placed close together on the germanium base crystal, it was desirable to obtain as high an Œ± current gain as possible. To obtain a higher Œ± current gain in a point-contact transistor, a brief high-current pulse was used to modify the properties of the collector point of contact, a technique called 'electrical forming'. Usually this was done by charging a capacitor of a specified value to a specified voltage then discharging it between the collector and the base electrodes. Forming had a significant failure rate, so many commercial encapsulated transistors had to be discarded. While the effects of forming were understood empirically, the exact physics of the process could never be adequately studied and thus no clear theory was ever developed to explain it or provide guidance on improving it. Unlike later semiconductor devices, it was possible for an amateur to make a point-contact transistor, starting with a germanium point-contact diode as a source of material (even a burnt-out diode could be used; and the transistor could be re-formed if damaged, several times if necessary).HOME-MADE TRANSISTORS: P B Helsdon, Wirless World, January 1954. Article starts \\"It is quite practicable to make point-contact transistors at home which compare quite well with those advertised by professional manufacturers.\\" Characteristics Some characteristics of point-contact transistors differ from the later junction transistor: *The common base current gain (or Œ±) of a point-contact transistor is around 2 to 3, whereas Œ± of bipolar junction transistor (BJT) cannot exceed 1 and the common emitter current gain (or Œ≤) of a point-contact transistor cannot exceed 1, whereas Œ≤ of a BJT is typically between 20 and 200. *Differential negative resistance. *When used in the saturated mode in digital logic, in some circuit designs (but not all) they latched in the on-state, making it necessary to remove power for a short time in each machine cycle to return them to the off-state.

There are also Warfare Officers and Logistics Officers (formerly called Supply Officers) supported by additional branches such as Medical or Dental Officers, or the Chaplaincy Service. Engineer Officers are responsible for the material condition of the various aspects of maritime platforms: Ships, Submarines and Naval Aircraft and as such lead teams of naval ratings to conduct preventive and corrective maintenance. Engineer Officers are responsible to the Captain for the operational capability of the platform and as such form part of the Command Team. Engineers are also widely employed in the Defence Equipment and Support and in the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence, supporting the Fleet or other elements of the British Armed Forces. Specialisations Four sub- branches of Engineer exist: =Marine Engineer= Marine Engineer Officers are responsible for the fabric of the ship or submarine, including its propulsion and steering systems, hotel and domestic services and damage control/ fire fighting equipment. =Weapon Engineer= Weapon Engineer Officers are responsible for the performance of onboard weapons, sensors, combat systems and communications systems. you must have a technical mind and an interest in electronics for this position. =Air Engineer= Air Engineers are responsible for the performance of fixed and rotary wing aircraft afloat and ashore. =Training Management= Training Management Officers are responsible for the management of training activities across the Royal Navy. Formed from the Instructor Officer branch, the role is predominantly a Human Capital function. However the position within the Engineer Branch reflects the high volume of engineering training carried out by the Royal Navy, with many Training Management Officers employed at HMS Collingwood and HMS Sultan. Training Engineer Officers entering the Royal Navy are required to be graduates with a suitably numerate degree, however some may have been sponsored with the Defence Technical Undergraduate Scheme at University of Portsmouth, Aston University, University of Birmingham, Loughborough University, Northumbria University, University of Newcastle upon Tyne or University of Southampton. Senior Ratings of the appropriate sub- specialisation may also be commissioned as Engineer Officers on the Senior Upper Yardman Scheme. New Entry training is undertaken at Britannia Royal Naval College where the courses vary slightly for new entry and SUY cadets. New Entry officers then undergo Common Fleet Time (4 months) where they learn the ropes in an operational warship using a syllabus common to all Officer specialisations; completing the Fleet Board to be permitted to continue to further training of Specialist Fleet Time attached to the department appropriate to their sub-specialisation. SUY Officers proceed directly to their specialist training waiving Fleet Time on the basis of their proven experience. Engineer Officers then undergo further training appropriate to their sub-specialisation. Weapon Engineers and Information Systems Engineers at HMS Collingwood, Marine Engineers and Aircraft Engineers at HMS Sultan and Training Managers at HMS Nelson. Training is structured and accredited by a number of professional bodies leading to the potential award of Chartered Engineer status.

Sudbury Downs held its last day of live racing on October 30, 2013. The facility has a Slot Parlor (with full service Bar) containing a large number of slot machines, although it is not a full casino. The Main building also includes a snack bar, Deli style sandwich bar and a Fine Dining restaurant that is open nights and special occasions. Location history Sudbury Downs was built on the farm of M√©d√©ric Bonin, which was settled in the mid 19th century by the Bonin family. The track is located in Boninville, which has now been amalgamated with Greater Sudbury. The history of this location can still be seen in places around Sudbury Downs. The land and its surrounding was transformed from a dense, Northern Ontario hardwood forest into farmland for much of the 19th century.

Description Tribal societies with social stratification under a single (or dual) leader emerged in the Neolithic period out of earlier tribal structures with little stratification, and they remained prevalent throughout the Iron Age. In the case of indigenous tribal societies existing within larger colonial and post-colonial states, tribal chiefs may represent their tribe or ethnicity in a form of self-government. The most common types are the chairman of a council (usually of \\"elders\\") and/or a broader popular assembly in \\"parliamentary\\" cultures, the war chief (may be an alternative or additional post in war time), the hereditary chief, and the politically dominant medicineman (in \\"theocratic\\" cultures). The term is usually distinct from chiefs at lower levels, such as village chief (geographically defined) or clan chief (an essentially genealogical notion). The descriptive \\"tribal\\" requires an ethno-cultural identity (racial, linguistic, religious etc.) as well as some political (representative, legislative, executive and/or judicial) expression. In certain situations, and especially in a colonial context, the most powerful member of either a confederation or a federation of such tribal, clan or village chiefs would be referred to as a paramount chief. This term has largely fallen out of use, however, and such personages are now often called kings. A woman who holds a chieftaincy in her own right or who derives one from her marriage to a male chief has been referred to alternatively as a chieftainess, a chieftess or, especially in the case of the former, a chief. History Arminius, a chieftain of the Germanic Cherusci tribe who defeated three Roman legions in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. Anthropologist Elman Service distinguishes two stages of tribal societies: simple societies organized by limited instances of social rank and prestige, and more stratified societies led by chieftains or tribal kings (chiefdoms). Historically, tribal societies represent an intermediate stage between the band society of the Paleolithic stage and civilization with centralized, super-regional government based in cities. Stratified tribal societies led by tribal kings thus flourished from the Neolithic stage into the Iron Age, albeit in competition with urban civilisations and empires beginning in the Bronze Age. An important source of information for tribal societies of the Iron Age is Greco-Roman ethnography, which describes tribal societies surrounding the urban, imperialist civilisation of the Hellenistic and Roman periods. After the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, tribal kingdoms were again established over much of Europe in the wake of the Migration period but they quickly turned into nobility-based feudalism afterwards. By the High Middle Ages, these had again coalesced into super-regional monarchies. Tribal societies remained prevalent in much of the New World. Exceptions to tribal societies outside of Europe and Asia were Paleolithic or Mesolithic band societies in Oceania and in parts of Sub-Saharan Africa. Europeans forced centralized governments onto these societies during colonialism, but in some instances tribes have retained or regained partial self-government and their lifestyles.

Tribal chiefs are known as sheikhs, though this term is also sometimes applied as an honorific title to spiritual leaders of Sufism. =Bolivia= The Afro-Bolivian people, a recognized ethnic constituency of Bolivia, are led by a king whose title is also recognized by the Bolivian government. =Botswana= In Botswana, the reigning kgosis of the various tribes are legally empowered to serve as advisers to the government as members of the Ntlo ya Dikgosi, the national House of Chiefs. In addition to this, they also serve as the ex officio chairs of the tribal kgotlas, meetings of all of the members of the tribes, where political and social matters are discussed. =Canada= The band is the fundamental unit of governance among the First Nations in Canada (formerly called \\"Indians\\"). Most bands have elected chiefs, either directly elected by all members of the band, or indirectly by the band council, these chiefs are recognized by the Canadian state under the terms of the Indian Act. As well, there may be traditional hereditary or charismatic chiefs, who are usually not part of the Indian Act- sanctioned formal government. There were 614 bands in Canada in 2012.Frequently Asked Questions About Aboriginal Peoples . Aadnc-aandc.gc.ca (2010-09-15). Retrieved on 2013-07-28. There is also a national organization, the Assembly of First Nations, which elects a \\"national chief\\" to act as spokesperson of all First Nations bands in Canada. =Ghana= The offices and traditional realms of the nanas of Ghana are constitutionally protected by the republican constitution of the country. The chiefs serve as custodians of all traditional lands and the cultures of the traditional areas. They also serve as members of the Ghanaian National House of Chiefs. =Nigeria= Although both the Nigerian traditional rulers and the wider chieftaincy aren't mentioned in Nigeria's current constitution, they derive their powers from various so-called Chiefs laws and are therefore legally recognized. The traditional rulers and select chiefs usually serve as members of each federating state's State Council of Traditional Rulers and Chiefs. =Oceania= The Solomon Islands have a Local Court Act which empowers chiefs to deal with crimes in their communities, thus assuring them of considerable effective authority. =Philippines= Apo Rodolfo Aguilar (Kudol I) serves as the chieftain of the Tagbanwa tribes people living in Banuang Daan and Cabugao settlements in Coron Island, Palawan, Philippines. His position is recognized by the Filipino government. =South Africa= Such figures as the king of the Zulu Nation and the rain queen are politically recognized in South Africa because they derive their status, not only from tribal custom, but also from the Traditional Leadership Clause of the country's current constitution. =Uganda= The pre-colonial states that existed in what is today Uganda were summarily abolished following independence from Great Britain. However, following constitutional reforms in 1993, a number of them were restored as politically neutral constituencies of the state by the government of Yoweri Museveni. Such figures as the kabaka of Buganda and the omukama of Toro typify the Ugandan chieftaincy class. =United States= Historical cultural differences between tribes Generally, a tribe or nation is considered to be part of an ethnic group, usually sharing cultural values. For example, the forest-dwelling Chippewa historically built dwellings from the bark of trees, as opposed to the Great Plains-dwelling tribes, who would not have access to trees, except by trade, for example for lodgepoles. Thus, the tribes of the Great Plains might have typically dwelt in skin-covered tipis rather than bark lodges. But some Plains tribes built their lodges of earth, as for example the Pawnee. The Pueblo people, meanwhile, built their dwellings of stone and earth. Political power in a tribe A chief might be considered to hold all political power, say by oratory or by example. But on the North American continent, it was historically possible to evade the political power of another by migration. The Mingos, for example, were Iroquois who migrated further west to the sparsely populated Ohio Country during the 18th century. Two Haudenosaunee, or Iroquois, Hiawatha and the Great Peacemaker, formulated a constitution for the Iroquois Confederation. The tribes were pacified by units of the United States Army in the nineteenth century, and were also subject to forced schooling in the decades afterward. Thus, it is uncommon for today's tribes to have a purely Native American cultural background, and today Native Americans are in many ways simply another ethnicity of the secular American people. Because formal education is now respected, some like Peter MacDonald, a Navajo, left their jobs in the mainstream U.S. economy to become chairpeople of their tribal councils or similar self-government institutions. Not all tribal leaders need be men; Wilma Mankiller was a well-known Chief of the Cherokee Nation. Also, though the fount of power might be the chief, he or she is typically not free to wield power without the consent of a council of elders of some kind. For example: Cherokee men were not permitted to go to war without the consent of the council of women. Tribal government is an official form of government in the United States, as it is in a number of countries around the world. Historically, the U.S. government treated tribes as seats of political power, and made treaties with the tribes as legal entities. Be that as it may, the territory of these tribes fell under the authority of the Bureau of Indian Affairs as reservations held in trust for the tribes. Citizenship was formerly considered a tribal matter. For example, it was not until 1924 that the Pueblo people were granted U.S. citizenship, and it was not until 1948 that the Puebloans were granted the right to vote in state elections in New Mexico. In Wisconsin, the Menominee Nation has its own county Menominee County, Wisconsin with special car license plates; 87% of the county's population is Native American. Mainstream Americans often find pride and comfort in realizing that at least part of their ethnic ancestry is Native American, although the connection is usually only sentimental and not economic or cultural. Thus, there is some political power in one's ability to claim a Native American connection (as in the Black Seminole). Economic power in a tribe Because the Nations were sovereign, with treaty rights and obligations, the Wisconsin tribes innovated Indian gaming in 1988, that is, on-reservation gambling casinos, which have since become a US$14 billion industry nationwide. This has been imitated in many of the respective states that still have indigenous American tribes. The money that this generates has engendered some political scandal. For example, the Tigua tribe, which fled their ancestral lands in New Mexico during the Pueblo revolt of 1680, and who then settled on land in El Paso County, Texas, has paid for a low probable return to the tribe because of the Jack Abramoff publicity. Many of the tribes use professional management for their money. Thus, the Mescalero Apache renovated their Inn of the Mountain Gods to include gambling as well as the previous tourism, lodging, and skiing in the older Inn. The Navajo nation defeated bids to open casinos in 1994, but by 2004 the Shiprock casino was a fait accompli.

He served as the Financial Commissary on √éle Royale (nowadays Cape Breton Island). commissary general of the ill-fated Duc d'Anville expedition and finally as the Intendant of New France. He was the last official ever to hold the latter position, losing it on the occasion of the conquest of 1760. He was subsequently accused of corruption and put on trial in France, and upon conviction was thrown into the Bastille for eleven months. Upon his release, Bigot was further sentenced to lifelong banishment. However, shortly after the judgement was made, Bigot escaped to Switzerland where he would live until his dying day.  Early life  Bigot was born at Bordeaux into a family that had attained nobility. He was the son of Louis-Amable Bigot (1663-1743), Conseilleur du Roi, Counsellor to the Parliament at Bordeaux and Receiver General to the King; by his wife, Marguerite de Lombard (1682-1766), daughter of Joseph de Lombard, Baron du Cubzagu√©s, Commissioner of the Marine at Guyenne and a representative of an old and powerful Guyenne family. His paternal grandfather had become rich from his commercial activities; his father had a successful legal career and held several important government positions. Bigot was to receive, as would befit a gentleman's son, \\"a good education which included legal studies.\\" Nothing is known for certain of Bigot's education, but historians believed he took a few courses in law at the Facult√© de Droit in Bordeaux. In 1723, at the age of twenty, when legal studies were normally completed, he used his influence within the French Royal Court to join \\"the commissary of the marine\\" as a chief scrivener. He served as a scrivener until 1728, when he was made a commissary. He became chief scrivener in 1729, and resident commissary of the Navy at Rochefort in 1732, at the age of 29. Rochefort was a port that saw many fleets kitted out and made ready for their voyages to the New World. This would be the last post that Bigot would hold in France for some time. As a young man in France, Bigot had an inordinate love for the gaming tables. The pressure he experienced from both his superiors and his creditors led him to accept a post as the financial commissary of the promising Acadian stronghold, Louisbourg. Another reason why he decided to accept this position, was because the Secretary of State of the Navy, the Count of Maurepas, had explained to him that \\"an intendancy in the ports of France cannot be expected if one has not served in the colonies.\\" This appointment, about which he was not too happy, became effective on 1 May 1739. He arrived at Louisbourg on the 9 September having come out on the same ship as the newly appointed governor, Isaac-Louis de Forant.  Louisbourg  Bigot wanted to impress his superiors in France. Thus, he began to attend to every aspect of the commissary's duties. He reorganized the bookkeeping and personally supervised operations in detail. In addition, Bigot avoided the conflicts with the governor that had marked the administrations of his predecessors. Bigot's reconstructed residence and storehouse at Fortress Louisbourg After Forant died in May 1740, Bigot befriended Fran√ßois Du Pont Duvivier and Louis Du Pont Duchambon, who were members of the pre-eminent military family in the colony. This friendship was marked by free use of patronage to the Du Pont family, who were beneficiaries of much of it. Payouts, sometimes amounting to thousands of livres, were made to this one family for things such as providing Bigot with boats to carry him about the island, even though the financial commissary had already been granted 1,200 livres annually to defray his transportation costs. This money came at the Crown's expense. Bigot was known for stealing money from the coffers of New France, as well as hiring out the King's workers and pocketing the money. By 1744, we see Bigot was an active central figure in the paying business of outfitting and supplying privateers. Preying on the ships of New England was an occupation that involved any number of Frenchmen located at Louisbourg, from the highest in the administration to the lowest of deck hands. In this business, Bigot, as it happened, was a keen supporter of the Du Pont brothers. For example, when Bigot was in partnership with Duvivier and Duquesnel and with Duvivier's brother Michel Du Pont de Gourville, \\"he held a quarter interest in the Saint-Charles, the total cost of which was 8,850 livres, and Bigot obtained another quarter interest in a larger vessel, the Brador, acquired and fitted out for 34,590 livres.\\" Also in 1744, Bigot found himself dealing with a mutiny at the Louisbourg garrison. The mutiny was quelled, apparently peacefully, with an amnesty. Bigot was not in charge of dealing with the uprising, and indeed it is unclear how he was involved, but as the official who controlled the finances, it seems likely that his r√¥le in ending the crisis was a key one. Maintaining supply links was a problem that Bigot, as financial commissary, had to deal with. However, supply had been a persistent problem for his predecessor, Le Normant. Moreover, between 1741 and 1743, Canada endured three consecutive crop failures. Sometimes supplies were also threatened by various events in Europe and North America. Bigot had no more success in solving the problems than Le Normant. Nevertheless, Intendant Gilles Hocquart asked Bigot for help. Although it was unorthodox, Bigot had no compunction about sending an agent, Fran√ßois du Pont Duvivier, to New England to secure fish, other foodstuffs and other goods from suppliers there when supplies from France or other French possessions seemed unreliable. Bigot was known for keeping the food supply at Louisbourg well stocked, even if he was dealing with France's foes. Indeed, the supply was threatened at one point with the outbreak of hostilities. New England was, of course, still ruled by the British in those days. When the crisis in Qu√©bec finally died down, Bigot ended up having enough food and fish to last the colony right through the winter. As a hedge against the threat of further crop failures, Bigot considered a variety of measures. In 1739, there was a proposal to build a warehouse that would store extra food in case of these crop failures. Bigot brought it up again a few years later. Furthermore, he also wanted to practise agriculture in the areas of √éle Royale that were potentially suitable, or on √éle Saint-Jean (Prince Edward Island), where the land appeared to him to be fertile. Nevertheless, Bigot never actually did find a permanent solution to this problem. Yet, the population never went hungry. Before the Siege of Louisbourg, Bigot warned Maurepas that an attack by the British was forthcoming. His warning was quite justifiable, for in April 1745, warships under Commodore Peter Warren instituted a blockade against Louisbourg. On 11 May 1745, American provincial troops commanded by William Pepperrell landed unopposed at Pointe Platte (Simon Point), 1.6 km west of Louisbourg. Unfortunately, on 26 May 1745 a unanimous decision was made at the war council that capitulation was the only option. Bigot returned to France on the Launceston, arriving at Belle-√éle on 15 July 1745.  Duc d'Anville expedition  After Louisbourg surrendered to the British, Fran√ßois Bigot returned to France only to find his hopes for a posting there dashed. It had been decided that Louisbourg along with the rest of Acadia was to be recaptured by a large expedition commanded by the duc d'Anville. Bigot was appointed commissary general for what became known as the Duc d'Anville expedition and sent to Rochefort to look after the garrison, and to outfit the invasion force destined, it was hoped, to win back some lost glory. This would be no easy task. He had to prepare about 1,100,000 rations of food for the mission. Bigot sailed with the expedition when it finally departed on 22 June 1746. The expedition was beset by storms and lost ships to British capture before it arrived at Chebucto, later to become Halifax, Nova Scotia. Illness devastated the soldiers and sailors of the fleet at Chebucto. Duc d'Anville died and there were rapid changes in command. Louisbourg could not be retaken and only a meager and unsuccessful siege of Annapolis Royal was mounted. Bigot watched as the whole undertaking that he had prepared with such effort unravelled. He, unlike many others, escaped from it with his life, if not all his belongings, back to France, but not before the ship that he was sailing on was wrecked on a shoal off Port-Louis. This latest d√©b√¢cle had its attendant consequences in France, and although Bigot was never actually prosecuted for any perceived failing on his part, he did spend the better part of the next two years endlessly writing reports about the failures. He came through the ordeal with his reputation intact, however.  Intendant of New France  Bigot was eventually sent to New France on 26 August 1748 to become the Intendant, much as it displeased him, for he had no wish to take up such an office. As the Intendant of New France, Bigot's tasks were to direct trade, finance, industry, food supplies, prices, policing, and other matters. His fundamental duty was to assist the Governor in the tasks of imperial expansion. Bigot showed much greater ability at one of the Intendant's traditional tasks, that of maintaining food supplies. Although his record was stained by a greedy attention to personal profit, Bigot fed the forces and the populace better than might have been expected in the hungry winters of 1751‚Äì1752, 1756‚Äì1757, and 1757‚Äì1758. The growing need to control the food supply was reflected in Bigot's many regulations for the distribution and pricing of grain, flour, and bread. History shows that \\"authorities managing food supplies, however vigorously and successfully, are usually seen as corrupt, arrogant, and ineffectual.\\" Hence, the word \\"Tyranny\\" springs to mind when reading the list of Bigot's decrees such as \\"directing people's movements and behaviour in detail, prescribing severe punishments for offenders, and relying in criminal cases on the stocks, the gibbet, the execution block and the tortures of the boot.\\" Nevertheless, tyranny of this type was standard French practice. Furthermore, many of Bigot's laws reflected a paternal effort to save the people of an unsettled frontier society from their own foolishness and lack of civic sense. Even more than previous intendants, he tried to prevent people from firing guns in towns, fighting in church doorways, dumping rubbish in streets and harbours and letting their livestock wander about unattended in the streets. He paved and maintained the streets of Qu√©bec with the proceeds of a tax of 30 or 40 livres a year on tavern-keepers, and tried to regulate traffic. Indeed, his authoritarian zeal went so far that Rouill√© and other ministers advised him \\"to leave more of the policing work to the courts.\\" But it was not in Bigot's nature to leave things to courts for he was, after all, an 18th-century naval officer attempting to run the colony as he might have run the naval installations at Brest or Rochefort, where he would rather have been. Amid accusations of fraud and favouritism, Bigot was recalled to France in 1754 to answer the charges. The next year, however, he was sent back to New France. For Fran√ßois Bigot, a posting to Qu√©bec was a kind of exile like a posting to any other remote bastion of the empire and he had to endure it for 12 years. Thus, it is surprising how well he performed his job as the Intendant of New France. L'Affaire du Canada The fraud of which Bigot was accused was not based upon mere forgery or underhanded ways of misusing funds; it was a system of private enterprise on a grand scale with the collaboration of most of the other colonial officials and many army officers and merchants working under the terms of personal understandings or even formal companies. This sort of corruption was a part of the political culture in Bourbon France, a way of life inevitably promoted by authoritarian governments and not changed until after the French Revolution, when new standards of honesty and new methods of control to enforce them were gradually imposed. Furthermore, Bigot's system of corruption was merely part of a viceregal court which he set up at Qu√©bec and which was essentially modelled on the royal court at Versailles: the magnificent social life with parties and lovely dinners in the midst of a wretchedly poor populace, as well as the preferment, employments, contracts, and business opportunities shared out among these tightly knit circles. The main difference between Bigot and the previous Canadian intendants was that his opportunities for enrichment were much greater at a time when more money was being spent in Canada than ever before. Bigot tried to get involved in every business and always asked for a percentage out of it. As such, while Bigot and dozens of officials and officers in Canada were making private fortunes, \\"the Canadian populace was suffering from inflated prices, food shortages, and occasional severe famines.\\" As a result, a serious economic crisis developed in which prices rose by 1759 to perhaps \\"eight times their pre-war level, and in the same year goods in Canada were estimated to cost about seven times more than in France.\\" Various reports of Bigot's commerce and corruption began to reach Versailles soon afterwards. Unfortunately, the inflation dramatically increased government expenses in Canada, and this expansion in turn increased the financial strain. In 1750 the colony cost the Crown a little more than \\"two million livres, in 1754 the cost more than doubled, and in a letter of 15 April 1759 the intendant reckoned that the bills of exchange for that year would amount to over 30 millions.\\" Considering that Bigot was spending less than the aforementioned before the war, one might imagine why the enormous demands of the later war years forced the ministry to investigate and then to prosecute the intendant whom they held responsible. Thus, it was big bills rather than tales of corruption, which brought the official wrath down on Bigot's head. During the Seven Years' War, government expenditures for Canada rose fivefold in four years, from 1755 to 1759. Fran√ßois Bigot and some of his associates, notably David Gradis, were accused of having stolen a great deal of it.  Fall of New France and consequences for Bigot  Fran√ßois Bigot is often seen as a man of marked mercenary tendencies. It was noted in his youth that he was rather fonder of gambling than most men, and superiors in the Navy even upbraided him for it. He was even later blamed for New France's loss to the British Empire during the Seven Years' War, although it seems unlikely that his, by some accounts fraudulent, schemes had anything to do with it. History records that France freely agreed at the peace negotiations to allow the British to keep New France in exchange for Guadeloupe. Nevertheless, France, seeking a scapegoat for its defeat in North America, obliged Bigot and his friends in a trial that became known as the \\"Canada Affair\\" to make good the sum of money that they had supposedly stolen. When the Seven Years' War began to go badly for France in 1757, the ruling faction of the Duc de Choiseul began to make changes and to look for scapegoats. It was fatally easy for the government to link Bigot's evident corruption with the inflation in Canada. By showing how the corruption and inflation were cause and effect, the Crown came up with an excuse for suspending payments on the Canadian bills of exchange. In view of the defeat at the Plains of Abraham it indeed seemed necessary to suspend payments, which might otherwise end up in the enemy's pockets. The crown was thus able to hide its own expected bankruptcy with a politically and morally necessary suspension of payments. By association, Bigot and the other officials from Canada were soon made to serve as scapegoats for the military and naval disasters as well as the financial ones. On 17 November 1761, Bigot and those associated, including his former business associates Cadet and P√©an were arrested. Their trial ensued, which ended with the judgement of 10 December 1763. Bigot's sentence was exile and the confiscation of all his property; heavy fines were imposed on all the convicted men.gallica.bnf.fr: \\"Arr√™t du conseil d'√©tat portant r√®glement pour les d√©clarations √† faire par les d√©positaires volontaires ou judiciaires des biens des nomm√©s Bigot, Varin et autres condamn√©s dans l'affaire du Canada\\", Paris: Imprimerie Royale, 1764gallica.bnf.fr: \\"Arr√™t du conseil d'√©tat portant prorogation jusqu'au 1er juillet prochain du d√©lai accord√© concernant les d√©clarations par les d√©positaires des biens des nomm√©s Bigot, Varin et autres condamn√©s dans l'affaire du Canada\\", Paris: Imprimerie Royale, 1764gallica.bnf.fr: \\"Arr√™t du conseil d'√©tat portant r√®glement pour le d√©p√¥t √† faire par les d√©positaires volontaires ou judiciaires des effets appartenant aux nomm√©s Bigot, Varin et autres condamn√©s en restitution au profit du roi dans l'affaire du Canada\\", Paris: Imprimerie Royale, 1764 Shortly after judgement was delivered on 10 December 1763, Bigot left for Switzerland. He changed his name to Fran√ßois Bar (de Barr), which was his brother-in-law's name, the Sieur de Barre (Bar). He stayed for some time at Fribourg and then went to Neuch√¢tel. On 18 March 1765 he secured permission to take up residence there, where he would live until his dying day. Fran√ßois Bigot died on 12 January 1778 at Neuch√¢tel; he was buried in the little Catholic church of Saint-Martin-L'√âv√™que in Cressier, a village nearby, as he had requested in his will: \\"I desire that my body be buried in the cemetery at Cressier without any pomp, just as the poorest person in the parish would be.\\" No portrait of Fran√ßois Bigot is known to exist. He is sometimes represented by an engraving made in 1855 by the French artist Charles Tamisier.Gravures dans l'Histoire des Canadiens-Fran√ßais The ruins of his residence and storehouse at Louisbourg was excavated and reconstructed in the 1960s by the Canadian Park Service and now forms a prominent museum component of the reconstructed Fortress Louisbourg national historic site which explores Bigot's role in the colony.\\"The Commissaire- Ordonnateur‚Äôs Property\\", Fortress of Louisbourg Association See also * Ang√©lique des M√©loizes referred to as the madame de Pompadour of Fran√ßois Bigot .

Described by Amnesty International as \\"perhaps Mexico's most famous investigative journalist and women's rights advocate\\", Cacho's reporting focuses on violence against and sexual abuse of women and children. Her book Los Demonios del Ed√©n (in English: The Demons of Eden) (2004) created a nationwide scandal by alleging that several prominent businessmen had conspired to protect a pedophilia ring. In 2006, a tape emerged of a conversation between businessman Kamel Nacif Borge and Mario Plutarco Mar√≠n Torres, governor of Puebla, in which they conspired to have Cacho beaten and raped for her reporting. Cacho is the winner of numerous international awards for her journalism, including the Civil Courage Prize, the Wallenberg Medal, and the Olof Palme Prize. In 2010, she was named a World Press Freedom Hero of the International Press Institute. Background Lydia Cacho Ribeiro was born in Mexico City to a mother of French-Portuguese origin who moved from France to Mexico during World War II and a Mexican engineer father. Cacho attributed her refusal to compromise to her mother, who was shocked by what she called Mexicans' willingness to \\"negotiate their dignity in exchange for apparent freedom\\". Her mother also taught her social awareness by taking Cacho along for grassroots community projects into poor neighborhoods. Cacho credits her father with teaching her discipline and toughness. Cacho lived briefly in Paris as a young woman, studying at the Sorbonne and working as a maid. At age 23, she nearly died from kidney failure. After her recovery, she began working for Canc√∫n newspapers, writing arts and entertainment stories. However, guided by her mother's feminism, Cacho soon began writing about violence against women. Shortly afterwards, in 1999, she was assaulted and raped by a man in a bus station bathroom who broke several of her bones. Cacho believes that the attack was a retaliation for her investigations. She continued her investigations, however, and the following year founded a shelter for battered women.  Los Demonios del Ed√©n  Lydia Mar√≠a Cacho Ribeiro In 2003, Cacho wrote articles on the sexual abuse of minors for the newspaper Por Esto including a note on a girl abused by a local hotel owner, Jean Succar Kuri.\\"A bote pronto: Lydia Cacho, periodista\\", Life & Style, November 2006, #27 Feeling that the local police had failed to act on the girl's complaint, the following year, Cacho published the book Los Demonios del Ed√©n (in English: \\"Demons of Eden\\") in which she accuses Kuri of being involved in a ring of child pornography and prostitution, based on official statements from his alleged victims and even a video of him (filmed with hidden camera). The book also mentions important politicians Emilio Gamboa Patr√≥n and Miguel √Ångel Yunes as involved, and accuses Kamel Nacif Borge, a Puebla businessman, of protecting Succar Kuri. After the book's release, Cacho was arrested in Canc√∫n by Puebla police and driven back to Puebla, 900 miles away. Cacho has stated that the arresting officers verbally abused her and hinted there was a plan to rape her. She was then imprisoned for a short time on defamation charges before being released on bail. On 14 February 2006, several telephone conversations between Nacif Borge and Mario Mar√≠n, governor of the state of Puebla, were revealed by the Mexico City daily La Jornada. In these conversations, before Cacho's arrest, Mar√≠n and Nacif Borge discussed putting Cacho in jail as a favour, and having her beaten and abused while in jail to silence her. The recording sparked widespread calls for Mar√≠n to be impeached. Cacho took the case of her arrest to the Supreme Court, becoming the first woman in Mexico's history to testify there. On 29 November 2007, the Court ruled 6 to 4 that Mar√≠n had no case to answer in Cacho's arrest, jailing and harassment, a case that The New York Times described as \\"a setback for journalistic freedom in Mexico\\". The United Nations Human Rights Council advised her to leave the country, recommended that she seek political asylum in another country, and offered her legal assistance and assistance in gaining access to international courts. While being held, Cacho was granted the Premio Francisco Ojeda al Valor Period√≠stico (Francisco Ojeda Award for Journalistic Courage). In May 2008, a few days before she was scheduled to testify at Kuri's trial, Cacho was almost killed when the lug nuts on one of her car's wheels were loosened.  Reporting on Femicides in Ciudad Ju√°rez  In 2006, Cacho reported on the hundreds of female homicides in Ciudad Ju√°rez. In 2020, Cacho was the host and executive producer of a bilingual podcast produced by Imperative Entertainment and Blue Guitar about the femicide in Ju√°rez. The podcast was released in English as The Red Note and in Spanish as La Nota Roja. A documentary on the same topic, entitled \\"Flowers of the Desert: Stories from the Red Note,\\" is scheduled to be released by Imperative Entertainment in 2021.  Awards and honors  In 2007, Lydia Cacho received the Amnesty International Ginetta Sagan Award for Women and Children's Rights, the IWMF (International Women's Media Foundation) Courage in Journalism Award, and the Oxfam Novib/PEN Award. The following year, she received the UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize. In 2009, Cacho was awarded the Wallenberg Medal from the University of Michigan for her work to bring to public attention to the corruption that shields criminals who exploit women and children. Cacho was a recipient of the PEN/Pinter Prize as an International Writer of Courage in 2010, which goes to writers persecuted for their beliefs. She was also named a World Press Freedom Hero of the International Press Institute. A year later, Cacho received The International Hrant Dink Award, presented to people who work for a world free of discrimination, racism and violence, take personal risks for their ideals, use the language of peace and by doing so, inspire and encourage others. She also won the Civil Courage Prize of The Train Foundation, which she shared with Triveni Acharya for efforts against \\"sex trafficking, domestic violence and child pornography\\", and the Olof Palme Prize together with Roberto Saviano. In 2017, Cacho was awarded the Distinguished Leadership Award for the Defense of Human Rights by the Inter-American Dialogue. Publications As of 2018, Lydia Cacho has written twelve books, ranging from poetry to fiction, and including a Manual to prevent child abuse, essays on gender issues and love, and her international best sellers about Sex trafficking, Human Slavery and the relationship between child pornography and child sexual abuse like Slavery Inc.: The Untold Story of International Sex Trafficking , published in the U.K. Her books have been translated into French, English, Dutch, Portuguese, Italian, German, Croatian, Swedish, and Turkish. * 2003, Mu√©rdele al coraz√≥n / Bite the heart , DEMAC, Spanish, * 2007, Esta boca es m√≠a‚Ä¶y tuya tambi√©n / This mouth is mine‚Ä¶ and Yours too , Planeta Mexicana, Spanish, * 2009, Con mi hij@ NO / With my child NO , Debolsillo , Spanish, * 2010, Esclavas del Poder: Trata sexual / Slaves Of Power , Grijalbo Mondadori, Spanish, * 2010, Los demonios del Ed√©n / The Demons of Eden , Debolsillo, Spanish, * 2013, El silencio es nuestro / The silence is ours , Artes de M√©xico y del Mundo, Spanish, * 2014, Slavery Inc.: The Untold Story of International Sex Trafficking , Soft Skull Press, English, * 2015, En busca de Kayla / In search of Kayla , Lydia Cacho y Patricio Betteo, Editorial Sexto Piso, ilustrado, Spanish, * 2016, Infamy , Soft Skull Press, English, * 2016, La ira de M√©xico / The wrath of Mexico , Editorial Debate, Spanish, * 2017, The sorrows of Mexico , Maclehose Press, English, * 2017, Ciberesp√≠as al rescate: en busca de Sam / Cyberspies to the rescue: In search of Sam , Spanish, See also *Censorship in Mexico#Attacks and threats against journalists *Human rights in Mexico *List of journalists and media workers killed in Mexico References External links *Lydia Cacho's blog 1963 births Living people People from Mexico City Mexican feminist writers Mexican women writers Mexican people of Portuguese descent Mexican people of French descent Mexican human rights activists Mexican women journalists Oxfam Novib/PEN Award winners ","title":"Lydia Cacho"},{"id":"3512391","text":"Located adjacent to the Arkansas River, Riverdale is a neighborhood of Little Rock, Arkansas, situated in the north-central area of the city.

They have been based out of Los Angeles, California since 2006. Their sound is characterized by a bombastic and frantic low end attack and are most mostly known for being a two piece band consisting of the duo of Warren and Willis. History The band released its first Tour EP and the vinyl version of their first album, Head for the Shallow, on January 25, 2005 through W√§ntage USA. The CD version of Head For the Shallow was released by Hydra Head Records, the first of a three album run. In late 2006, after relocating to Los Angeles, Jared and Coady both became members of The Melvins, first appearing on (A) Senile Animal. The tour, titled \\"the Double-Drumming Rock for Peace tour\\", featured Warren and Willis playing a set as Big Business before being joined by Crover and Osborne for a set as the Melvins. While on tour, Big Business played with David Scott Stone who would later play guitar and Minimoog Voyager on all songs from their 2007 release Here Come the Waterworks. After releasing Here Come the Waterworks to critical acclaim, Big Business was given an opening spot on the summer leg of the Tool tour. Toshi Kasai played guitar for Big Business throughout this tour. After the fall US tour ended, Big Business started recording material for the new Melvins album, entitled Nude With Boots, which was released on July 8, 2008. On March 9, 2008 Toshi Kasai was introduced onstage as the third member of Big Business. Both the band and Toshi verified this on their respective Myspace pages. Big Business released their third album Mind the Drift on May 12, 2009. The album, produced by Phil Ek, who has produced both of their previous albums. In October, 2010 after a year of not playing shows, they posted on their Myspace that they had added another guitarist Scott Martin (400 Blows, Crom), officially making them a \\"Power Quartet\\". They toured the summer of 2011 with Torche and Thrones. Big Business toured with Red Fang and American Sharks in the spring of 2014. In 2016 the release, Command Your Weather (2016) was issued by Joyful Noise Recordings / Gold Metal Records. Around 2016, Big Business began touring as a two piece once again without any specific announcement or press. Their latest release The Beast You Are was issued by Joyful Noise Recordings / Gold Metal Records. On April 13th, 2019 drummer Coady Willis appeared on the podcast Conan Neutron's Protonic Reversal to discuss the making of The Beast You Are and a general career retrospective for Big Business and other bands.

He helped launch the career of Jean Harlow, whom he married in July 1932; two months later, he was found dead of a gunshot wound, leaving what appeared to be a suicide note. Various alternative theories of his death have been proposed. Film producer Samuel Marx believed that he was killed by his ex-common-law wife Dorothy Millette, who jumped to her death from a ferry days afterward. Early life and career Bern was born Paul Levy in Wandsbek, which was then a town in the Prussian province of Schleswig-Holstein (now a district of the city of Hamburg). He was one of six children of Julius and Henriette (n√©e Hirsch) Levy, a Jewish couple. Julius worked as a clerk for a shipping company before opening a candy store. In 1898, Julius decided to move the family to the United States due to the rise of unemployment and anti-Jewish attitudes in Wandsbek. The family eventually settled in New York City. Julius Levy died in 1908. In 1920, Henriette Levy drowned herself, possibly as a threat to keep her beloved son from marrying. Bern pursued a career in acting on the stage and studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. He later adopted the stage name \\"Paul Bern\\". Bern soon realized he had little aptitude for acting and pursued other aspects of theater production. He worked as a stage manager for a time before moving to Hollywood in the early 1920s. He was initially a film editor before he worked his way up to scenario writing and directing for United Artists and Paramount Pictures. This led to his working full-time as a producer at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the major studio of the time. Bern eventually became the production assistant of Irving Thalberg and then a producer on the MGM lot in his own right. The star-studded film Grand Hotel, released six days after Bern's death, won the Best Picture Academy Award for 1931‚Äì1932. Bern and Thalberg produced the film, although neither was listed in the film credits (in the early 1930s MGM did not list their films' producers in their credits). The award was presented solely to Thalberg, however, since Bern, being deceased, obviously could not also accept it.Fleming 2009 p.203 Personal life While living in New York City, Bern lived with his common-law wife Dorothy Millette (who was born Adele Roddy). Bern financially supported Millette, who reportedly suffered from mental and emotional problems and ended up in a Connecticut sanatorium. Millette traveled to Los Angeles in September 1932, where she reportedly visited Bern on the night of his death. Her body was found in the Sacramento River two days after Bern's death. It was later determined that she had committed suicide by jumping from the Delta King steamboat. Bern met actress Jean Harlow shortly before the premiere of Hell's Angels in 1930. Bern was instrumental in helping Harlow's career, as he was the only person who took her seriously as an actress. The two struck up a friendship and eventually began dating. They announced their engagement in June 1932 and married on July 2, 1932. Death Note signed \\"Paul\\" discovered by police after his death, viewed by authorities as a suicide note Two months after marrying Jean Harlow, on September 5, Bern was found dead from a gunshot wound to the head in their home on Easton Drive in Beverly Hills, California. The coroner ruled his death a suicide. Police discovered a note at the scene that read as follows: > \\"Dearest Dear, > Unfortuately this is the only way to make good the frightful wrong I have > done you and to wipe out my abject humiliation, I Love you. > Paul > You understand that last night was only a comedy\\" Authorities viewed this as a suicide note signed by Bern. To the police, and before a grand jury, Harlow's only statement was that she \\"knew nothing\\". Harlow was made an executor of her husband's estate by the Californian judge. Harlow never publicly spoke on the matter. She died in 1937. Two thousand people attended Bern's funeral, held on September 9, 1932 at the Grace Chapel at Inglewood Park Cemetery. Conrad Nagel delivered the eulogy. Bern was cremated, and his ashes were interred in the Golden West Mausoleum at Inglewood Park Cemetery. =Investigation reopened, 1960= In the November 1960 issue of Playboy, screenwriter Ben Hecht questioned the official verdict of Bern's death, causing renewed interest in the case. Hecht suggested that Bern was murdered by an unnamed woman and that the investigation into Bern's death was a \\"suicide whitewash\\". Hecht went on to say that the explanation of Bern's suicide \\"would be less a black eye for their [MGM's] biggest movie making heroine. It might crimp her [Harlow's] box office allure to have her blazoned as a wife who couldn't hold her husband\\". The article prompted Los Angeles County District Attorney William B. McKesson to reopen the case, but McKesson later closed it, stating, \\"When I ordered the record check I assumed Hecht was still a responsible reporter. It now appears ... that he apparently was peddling a wild and unconfirmed rumor as fact.\\" =Alternative theories= In 1990, film producer Samuel Marx, a friend and MGM colleague of both Bern and Irving Thalberg, published a book giving a different version of Bern's death. Marx, at the time MGM's story editor (the head of the screenwriting department), said he had gone to Bern's house in the early morning of September 5, 1932, before the police were notified of the body's discovery, and had seen Thalberg tampering with the evidence. The next day, he had been among the studio executives who were told by Louis B. Mayer that the case would have to be ruled \\"suicide because of impotence\\" in order to avoid a scandal which would have finished Harlow's film career. Marx, after reviewing the evidence, concluded that Bern was murdered by his abandoned common-law wife Dorothy Millette, who then committed suicide by drowning, jumping overboard from the Delta King on the way from San Francisco to Sacramento, California.Marx, Deadly Illusions Selected filmography =Director= *Head over Heels (1922) *Open All Night (1924) *Flower of the Night (1925) *The Woman Racket (uncredited, 1930) =Producer= * Geraldine (1929) * Anna Christie (1930) =Writer= * Greater Than Love (1919) * The Marriage Circle (1924) * Men (1924) * Prince of Tempters (1926) * The Beloved Rogue (1927) * The Dove (1927) * Grand Hotel (1932) References Footnote * Samuel Marx and Joyce Vanderveen: Deadly Illusions (Random House, New York, 1990), re- published as Murder Hollywood Style - Who Killed Jean Harlow's Husband?

Founded by Peter des Roches with a grant of land from King John, the abbey's official year of inauguration was 1218. It acquired two daughter abbeys and a dependent priory. It also acquired a considerable range of estates, mostly concentrated within the region, and a number of churches, which it appropriated after being granted the advowsons. The abbey's manorial court records have survived in large part, portraying a discontented community, driven to many acts of resistance and at one point to challenge the abbey's very existence. The abbey played no great part in the affairs of its order, although it was represented at all levels. At least one abbot attracted serious criticism from within the order, which attempted to remove him. Its canons observed the Rule of St Augustine to a varying degree, with some serious lapses, at least in the late 15th century, when the order's visitor uncovered widespread sexual exploitation of local women. The abbey was moderately prosperous and survived the suppression of the lesser monasteries. It was dissolved in 1538. Foundation and early years Tomb of Peter des Roches in Winchester Cathedral. Halesowen Abbey originated in a grant of the manor of Halesowen in 1214 by King John to Peter des Roches, then Bishop of Winchester, intended to allow the Peter to found a religious house \\"of whatever order he pleased.\\" On 27 October of that year the king issued instructions through letters close to the Sheriff of Staffordshire to give the bishop full seisin of the manor and all that pertained to it. The following year John issued a charter confirming the manor in frankalmoin to the \\"canons of the Premonstratensian order resident at Hales\\" (apud Hales). However, the official date for the foundation of Halesowen Abbey, as given by the Premonstratensian order, is 1218, at least three years after the canons regular, known as \\"White Canons\\" because of their habit, had set up a community at Halesowen. Such apparent disparities were common with Premonstratensian houses and stem from religious and theological attitudes specific to the order.Cf for example Dale Abbey, where the stated date of the foundation, 15 August 1204, is at least five years later than the establishment of a successful Premonstratensian community at Dale. In monastic orders generally an abbey requires a chapter of at least 13, so that there can be an abbot or \\"father\\" and twelve canons.This rested on a typological view of Christ and the Twelve Apostles, and more anciently, the Twelve Tribes of Israel. Moreover, it seems likely that the Premonstratensians did not count an abbey as fully established until there was an abbey church to consecrate. Finally, several of the later abbeys were dedicated not simply to Mary, mother of Jesus, but specifically, as at Dale (Stanley Park) Abbey ad festum Assumptionis ‚Äî \\"for the Feast of the Assumption,\\"Gasquet, F. A. (1906) Collectanea Anglo-Premonstratensia Vol.2, p. 172, no. 357. so the abbey would not be inaugurated until the next occurrence of the festival (15 August) after the gathering of a sufficient number in church. All of this could lead to considerable delays. The basic facts about the foundation and dedication of an abbey were established in advance by Bishop Redman, abbot of Shap Abbey, before he carried out regular canonical visitations of Premonstratensian houses in 1478. The text of replies to his preliminary enquiries for that year's visitation of Halesowen: The acceptance of the abbot of Welbeck Abbey in Nottinghamshire as the father abbot of Halesowen, and its basis in a colonisation from that abbey on 6 May 1218, suggest a reason for the delayed formal foundation of the abbey. King John's confirmatory charter of 1215 had implied that there was already a Premonstratensian community at Halesowen, although it did not mention where the canons had come from. If there was an early Premonstratensian settlement of the site by 1215, it seems that a further colonisation from Welbeck was needed to bring the numbers up to the requisite level. Certainly substantial building work was being carried out in 1218, as Peter des Roches received a royal grant of ¬£17 3s. 4d. to meet the costs of it. Although the exact date of the foundation is nowhere stated, it is likely that Halesowen was consecrated on the Feast of the Assumption in 1218, early in the reign of Henry III. Building and possibly rebuilding continued for some years, as early in 1223 Brian de Lisle was instructed to have made for the bishop sixty copula de cablecio from the royal Forest of Kinver for the \\"refurbishment of his church of Hales.\\" Evidently the matter was considered important, as a second set of more detailed instructions were issued to Brian on 23 May, raising the possibility of buying the items ready- made. Although the Victoria County History account mentions the grant, it does not explain what the items actually were. Copula de cablecio suggests some sort of couplings or ties, possibly rafters, joists or other structural members. In connection with the grant of wood, instructions were also issued to Brian on 5 June to procure for the abbey, with minimal damage to the woodland, sufficient wood for four fires to melt lead, indicating that roof work was under way: rather than a repair, this was perhaps lead covering to replace an earlier, temporary roof. The status and possessions of Halesowen Abbey were confirmed by a charter of Henry III on 5 April 1227. In particular the grant of the manor of Halesowen was reiterated and it was made clear that the abbey was answerable to the bishop of Winchester and his successors as patrons.Calendar of Charter Rolls, 1227‚Äî57, p. 32. Daughter houses =Titchfield= Peter des Roches went on to found another Premonstratensian house, Titchfield Abbey in Hampshire. This was colonised with canons from Halesowen and given the same dedication as Halesowen.Gasquet, F. A. (1906) Collectanea Anglo-Premonstratensia Vol.3, p. 123. The date is given in some sources, including Victoria County History, as 1222, but the convent's reply to a question from Bishop Redman on the subject was that the foundation date was 1231,Gasquet, F. A. (1906) Collectanea Anglo-Premonstratensia Vol.3, p. 125, no. 578. which agrees with the foundation charter, dated the 16th year of Henry III.Dugdale, W. et al (eds.) (1846) Monasticon Anglicanum, Vol. 6.2, p. 921‚Äî2, no. 1. Redman's pro forma also elicited a confirmation that the abbot of Halesowen was the father abbot of Tichfield. =Talley= Ruins of Talley Abbey Talley Abbey () was about two decades older than Halesowen Abbey, founded towards the end of the 12th century by Rhys ap Gruffydd Originally it was subject to St. John the Baptist's Abbey, Amiens. It suffered greatly as a result of constant warfare in its first century. In 1291 the head of the order, William, Abbot of Pr√©montr√© Abbey, requested Edward I to assist the abbots of Halesowen and Newsham Abbey make a canonical visitation. This fitted well with the king's policy of bringing Welsh religious houses more closely under domination from England. The patron of Talley was Rhys ap Maredudd, one of the most intractable of the Welsh opponents of the English monarchy, who died in 1292. In a letter dated that year, the abbot of Pr√©montr√© refers to the will of the king and to the advantages and peace that would surround the abbey, as a result of his reassignment of Talley to Welbeck Abbey, making the abbot of the Nottinghamshire house and his successors the father abbots of the Welsh house. Uncertainty still surrounds the r√¥les played by Halesowen and Welbeck Abbeys in relation to Talley. Abbots of Halesowen played a part in three of four known visitations at Talley. In 1410 Antipope John XXIII granted an indult to Talley to prevent visitors requiring the canons to travel for more than a day to meetings: previously they had been travelling about 80 miles, despite the impoverishment of the abbey from constant incursions by armed bands. After an inquiry into the matter, the abbot of Welbeck resigned the paternity of Talley Abbey to Halesowen in a letter of 20 August 1414. A letter from Hubert, Abbot of Pr√©montr√©, dated 18 April 1475, explains to Bishop Redman that Talley Abbey was transferred to Halesowen because of the distance separating it from St. John the Baptist's Abbey in Amiens. A search of the documents had found no mention of Welbeck in this context, which suggests that its claim might have been based on a forgery. Despite the difficulties of travel, the abbot of Talley attended a provincial chapter meeting, covering all the order's abbeys in Britain and Ireland, at Lincoln in July 1476 In 1478 Redman's set questions preceding the visitation elicited the answer from the convent of Talley that Abbas de Hales-owen est pater abbas ‚Äî \\"the abbot of Halesowen is the father abbot.\\" Gribbin suggests that the questions, which were asked of all convents that year, were devised precisely because Redman was unsure of the situation at Talley. Nevertheless, a provincial chapter meeting, probably held in 1479 at Leicester, considered the \\"dubious paternity\\" of Talley, which was being investigated by Redman. In December 1485 Redman dealt with a canon who wanted to transfer from Cockersand Abbey to Talley and saw fit to bring the abbot of Welbeck into the process, perhaps to cover himself against future challenges. When Redman made a visitation of Talley Abbey in 1497 he met the abbot, not at the abbey in Wales but at Halesowen, and, as he was newly elected, received his vow of obedience to the abbot of Pr√©montr√©. Redman was sufficiently well-informed to order the abbot to attend to urgent repairs. It seems that the issue had been settled at last in favour of Halesowen. =Dodford= Halesowen Abbey absorbed the Augustine Dodford Priory in 1464, by letters patent of Edward IV.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1461‚Äî7, p. 321. At this point the convent of Dodford had dwindled to a single canon, Thomas Tipton, who was therefore the prior at the time of dissolution, and the king's reference to the \\"decrease of fruits and profits\\" makes clear that the priory was in financial difficulties. The priory was founded in the reign of Henry II but its oldest extant foundation document is an inspeximus charter, which also dates from the 16th year of Henry III, 1231‚Äì2.Dugdale, W. et al (eds.) (1846) Monasticon Anglicanum, Vol. 6.2, p. 944, Introduction and no.1. Although Brother Thomas Cooksey, a canon of Halesowen was consistently accorded the title \\"prior of Dodford\\" in 1488, 1491 and 1494, he was no more than the custos, keeper, of Dodford in 1497. Halesowen came to treat the former priory as a mere monastic cell and exploited its resources efficiently, bringing about a substantial increase in revenues. In 1500 neither Cooksey nor any other member of the community was named as responsible for Dodford, which had dwindled to the status of one of Halesowen's estates. In 1505 Cooksey reappeared as prior, at the head of a fictional Dodford community, which was simply a list of Halesowen's canons. In 1535 the demesne land and leases at Dodford together brought in the substantial sum of ¬£24 3s. 1d. Abbots of Halesowen =Abbots within the order= Based on similar tree diagrams in Holliday and Gasquet, and with reference to Gribbin. The chart lists Premonstratensian houses in England and Wales, in the late 15th century, except for Orford or Irford Priory a small Nottinghamshire house of canonesses which was of unknown affiliation. Both abbeys and priories were generally affiliated to the house that founded them, but this was not always so: in some cases paternity was attributed elsewhere or altered subsequently. Each abbey is linked by a solid line to the abbey of its \\"father abbot\\" in a row above. The line of paternity from Pr√©montr√© Abbey to Halesowen and beyond is highlighted with yellow boxes. Dependent priories are linked to the mother house with dashed lines. Dates of foundation are those given by convents when questioned by Bishop Redman in 1478, if available: otherwise, as estimated by Gasquet or the editors of Victoria County History. Floor tiles from Halesowen Abbey, as reconstructed by J. R. Holliday, showing an abbot, Nicholas, thought to be from the reign of Edward I. The lettering reads: ISTUD OPUS NICHOLAS MATRI CHRISTI DEDIT ABBAS VIGEAT ABSQUE CHAO MATER DONA NICHOLAO - This work Abbot Nicholas gave to the Mother of Christ that he might flourish without confusion. Halesowen's abbots were the main channel connecting the convent to the wider Premonstratensian or Norbertine order. The paternal links between abbeys provided a hierarchical structure of supervision and discipline. As Halesowen was a daughter house of Welbeck Abbey, it was subject to canonical visitation and correction by the abbot of the mother house. The abbot of Halesowen was himself \\"father abbot\\" to Titchfield and later to Talley and Dodford and was obliged to carry out annual canonical visitations and to supervise and formally confirm the election of their heads. In 1370, for example, Richard de Hampton, Abbot of Halesowen, provided John Thorny, newly elected as abbot of Titchfield, with a letter confirming his election, which he took to William of Wykeham, Bishop of Winchester and patron of both abbeys. This initiated the benediction of Thorny at the episcopal manor, a more intimate context than the cathedral. In 1390, Abbot Richard, now old, wrote a similar letter to secure the benediction of Thorny's successor, John Romsey. In 1420 Abbot John Poole of Halesowen travelled to Titchfield Abbey to perform two tasks: to attend to the confirmation and benediction of Richard Aubrey as abbot of the daughter hose and to carry out a canonical visitation. He was assisted by John Ultyng, Abbot of Dureford Abbey in Sussex, a short distance east of Titchfield.Dugdale, W. et al (eds.) (1846) Monasticon Anglicanum, Vol. 6.2, p. 935, no. 3. The visitation, signed off on 12 June, seems to have concentrated on accounting for Titchfield's assets and liabilities. There was no cash in the treasury and the debts came to ¬£62 0s. 6d., although the house was owed ¬£43 4s. The valuables in the sacristry and treasury were counted: one silver-gilt ciborium, two large silver-gilt chalices and twelve others, of which six were gilded, a large Gospel book adorned with various relics, a silver-gilt vessel set on feet and filled with relics, a large silver-gilt cross with images of Mary and St John, set on a large stand, and so on, to the 84 silver spoons. The livestock on various manors was also counted: 34 horses, 10 draught horses, 4 colts, 154 oxen, 7 bulls, 69 cows, 17 heifers (young cows), 10 bullocks (young and or castrated bulls), 28 yearlings, 29 calves, 381 muttons, 207 hurtis et muricis, 121 hoggets, 100 lambs, 17 boars, 24 sows, 33 pigs, 126 hogs (castrated male pigs, and 89 suckling pigs. It is possible this precise accounting was to establish a marker for the new abbacy. The order did not work solely through vertical, hierarchical structures. Even when the paternal links were invoked, major interventions almost always involved at least one other abbot: in the case of the attempt to remove Abbot Walter, it was the father abbot and two others. When an election was needed at Dale in 1332, the responsibility to supervise it fell naturally to the abbot of Newsham Abbey, the father abbot. However, he sent as his representatives the abbots of Halesowen and Langdon. Both were in the paternal line from Newsham, the oldest Premonstratensian house in England, although only two English abbeys were not. There were horizontal links of support and consultation which took form in the unique Premonstratensian circaria system, grouping abbeys in a region together. In its completed form, this placed Halesowen in the English Middle Circaria, which stretched from Lincolnshire to Shropshire, and beyond into South Wales. In 1311, when the English abbeys were caught between the demands of Pr√©montr√© and the king over the subsidies issue, they organised against Adam, the head of the order, on the basis of the circaria: the abbots of Croxton Abbey and Newsham wrote to all the Middle English abbeys to raise funds for an appeal to Rome, including Halesowen's 14 shillings in the list of required contributions. When war brought Pr√©montr√© into serious hardship in 1354, the abbot of Halesowen was chosen as one of the representatives of the English Middle Circaria to discuss the issue at Grantham. Abbots of Halesowen also sometimes took on similar representative functions at the Provincial Chapter, a triennial meeting of all the abbots of the order in Britain and Ireland, which always began with the selection of the definitors, a steering committee. Abbot Thomas Bridges of Halesowen is known to have taken this r√¥le at two consecutive chapters: at Grantham in 1492 and at Lincoln in 1495 Sometimes the abbot of Halesowen would attend the General Chapter of the order at Pr√©montr√©. In 1327, for example, with strict conditions in force designed to prevent the transfer of subsidies to Pr√©montr√©, abbots attending the meeting were forced to apply for permission and to specify the amount of money they were carrying. On 1 September orders were issued from Nottingham to Bartholomew Burghersh, the constable of Dover Castle, to permit the abbots of Halesowen and West Dereham Abbeys to cross the Channel with their entourages, with 20 marks each for expenses.Calendar of Close Rolls, 1327‚Äî30, p. 217. =Abbatial elections= Abbots played a crucial part in the installation of other abbots, although Premonstratensian houses elected their own abbots, so long as they could agree on the right man. There was no formal vote, as the process of election was expected to produce a candidate who was acceptable to all. The earliest election at Halesowen of which details are extant was one of those in which the canons could not agree. Held on 17 June 1322, it was supervised by Richard de Nottingham, Abbot of Welbeck and father abbot of Halesowen. He was assisted by the abbot of a house abbreviated to T, which narrows the possibilities to Tupholme Abbey or Torre Abbey. The election probably followed the resignation of Abbot Bartholomew. After celebrating the Mass of the Holy Spirit, the entire convent of the abbey retired with the two abbots to the chapter house, where they sang the Veni Creator Spiritus, \\"Come Creator Spirit.\\" After initial discussion the canons unanimously decided to accept an election by way of compromission, a commonly used procedure in which the decision was delgated to a panel chosen by the convent as a whole. This took place under the leadership of Henry, the prior of Halesowen. However, the issue proved intractable and the choice ultimately devolved on the abbot of Welbeck, acting in his pastoral capacity. He nominated Thomas de Lech, who was generally accepted. After singing the Te Deum with the chapter, Abbot Richard led them out into the choir of the abbey church, where he sat Thomas in the first choir stall, conferred paternal authority on him and installed him in the church and its possessions. The way of compromission was followed with greater success on 9 March 1486, after the death of Abbot John Derby. On this occasion the father abbot from Welbeck was accompanied by the abbot of Beauchief. It seems that the convent quickly agreed on a panel empowered to carry out the election: the subprior Thomas Bridge, Henry Edgbaston, Richard Hill, John Saunders, Thomas Cockseye and John Birmingham. They were given from 11:00 to 13:00 to make a decision. Before the time had elapsed, Richard Hill was authorised to make the announcement that Bridge had been elected abbot, to unanimous approval. The visiting abbots made a diligent examination of the process and could find nothing wrong with either the election or the man chosen, so took him into the church for installation in his seat. Over two centuries the essentials of the process did not change, although on 4 July 1505 it brought a very quick outcome, as there was little to discuss. Thomas Wilkinson, Abbot of Welbeck, was accompanied to Halesowen by the abbot of Dale, Richard Nottingham, after the death of Thomas Bridge. Once again, proceedings began with the Mass of the Holy Spirit and a procession to the chapter house, where Wilkinson solemnly warned any who were excommunicated, suspended or under interdict to withdraw before the election commenced. There followed an invocation of the Holy Spirit. It seems that Edmund Green, prior of Hornby, a small Lancashire dependency of Croxton Abbey, immediately emerged as favourite. After the convent and the visiting abbots had assured themselves that his reputation and holiness of life were of the required standard, Wilkinson and Nottingham approved, ratified and confirmed his election and affixed their seals to the election return. The convent and abbots moved back to the church and sang Te Deum laudamus. =Attempted deposition= The outstanding case of the deposition, or attempted deposition, of an abbot of Halesowen occurred in 1311, when Walter de la Flagge was abbot. In 1310 Abbot Adam of Pr√©montr√©, presumably acting on rumours or reports he had received, had instructed the abbots of Dale and Langdon to carry out a visitation of Halesowen Abbey, taking with them the abbot of Welbeck: they were to correct abuses and be prepared to force the resignation of the abbot if necessary. They were to use ecclesiastical powers to put down rebellion but were authorised to call in the secular arm if necessary. The situation was complicated by a conflict between the king and the Premonstratensian order over subsidies that the English abbeys were expected to remit to Pr√©montr√© Abbey: money that the king wanted to keep in the country. The king suspected that the visitation was a stratagem for extracting a subsidy and sent a copy of his prohibition of such payments to the abbots of Dale and Langdon on 7 May 1311. However, the visitation went ahead and the three abbots pronounced the abbot of Halesowen incontinent, uncooperative, incompetent and unfit to rule, on numerous grounds deserving of excommunication. Brother Lawrence, a deposed abbot of Bayham Abbey, whose offences were not quite defined, was condemned in the most verbose terms as a scandal to the faith. Brother Batholomew of Coventry was a confirmed liar. Brother Robert de Boudon was guilty of incontinence, conspiracy and violent disturbance of the peace. The prior, they reported, was the son of a cleric (which would have excluded him from the order without special permission), incapable of his office, an open conspirator, not trusted to hear confession by the canons. Joh Gorscote was in the same mould as the abbot. However, before the visitors could proceed against them, the accused produced the king's prohibition, claiming that it made them immune against their sentence. When the visitors persisted they were expelled from the abbey. They were even refused accommodation, at their own expense, at one of its granges or farms. They travelled to Dale where they assured themselves that the king's prohibition did not apply to visitations as such and, on the Nativity of Saint John the Baptist (24 June), pronounced their sentences. The abbot, prior, sub-prior, sacristan, precentor, cellarer and John of Gorscote were solemly and publicly excommunicated: members of the order were not to communicate with them until they were absolved by the abbot of Pr√©montr√©. To signal that this was not just the judgement of the two visitors commissioned by Pr√©montr√©, the abbot of Welbeck appended his seal to the document. It is not clear precisely what effect the visitation and the sentences had on the running of Halesowen Abbey. The next known election was not until 1314, when Barthlomew became abbot, so it is possible that the slippery Abbot Walter managed to remain in post for some years. Canons of Halesowen =Numbers= Number of canons, including abbot, at Halesowen Abbey as listed in the visitations, 1475‚Äì1500. The clerical population of England seems to have reached a peak by about 1300 and fell greatly during the Black Death. The number of Premonstratensians is thought to have fallen by a little under a third during this disaster. Poll tax returns for Halesowen show only 11 canons at the abbey in 1381. Redman's visitations gives lists of canons at not quite regular intervals for the last quarter of the 15th century. Numbers at Halesowen are given in the accompanying column chart. =R√¥les and responsibilities= The Premonstratensian canons of Halesowen were not monks and were able to take on a wide range of responsibilities both inside and outside their own religious house. Entering the community, sometimes as children, they would progress through a novitiate, under the tutelage of the novice master, until able to make their religious profession as full members, specifically as part of the convent of Halesowen. Alongside this, but distinct from it, was progression through the Holy orders in the Catholic Church: at that time generally acolyte, subdeacon, deacon and priest. The registers of Worcester diocese record some of these ordinations. For example, in the first week of Lent in 1373 William Horwood of Northfield, a canon of Halesowen, was ordained a subdeacon. On the vigil of Trinity Sunday 1419 Thomas Holder of Halesowen convent was ordained a subdeacon during a vacancy in the see by Nicholas Duffield, the abbot of Pershore, who had been recognised as bishop of Dunkeld by the Roman antipopes during the Western Schism. Bishop Redmand's visitation records show individual novices becoming canons and progressing through holy orders. In 1475 the abbey had six novices: Richard Wenlock, John Hales, Edward Clareley, John Seed, Richard Walsall and Richard Worfield. Three years later all their names are prefixed by the title Frater, \\"Brother,\\" indicating that they have made their profession and become full members of the convent. Hales had been appointed cantor or singer of the abbey, although neither he nor Wenlock is otherwise described: possibly both were now priests. Clareley and Seed had now been ordained deacons, with Clareley also made a sub-cantor; Walsall was a subdeacon; Worfield was an acolyte. The same reports give examples also of the r√¥les and responsibilities of the more established canons. John Derby stands at the head of the lists as abbot but next comes Richard Edgbaston, the prior of the abbey. In 1478 he was described also as cellarer, responsible for the abbey's supply of food and drink, and probably also the manager of its manorial court. He was also at that time the sacristan, who took care of the abbey's liturgical vessels and other ceremonial items. He seems to have been the abbot's confidant and factotum, a man trusted with a demanding and important range of tasks, so it no surprise to find him appointed to the panel who elected John Derby's successor in 1486. In both years his deputy in managing the day-to-day affairs of the convent was Thomas Nechel, the sub-prior. The same three canons were vicars of controlled churches in both 1475 and 1478: John Comber at Walsall, Richard Hill at Halesowen and John Hay at Clent. These were priests, exercising pastoral and liturgical functions at the three parish churches and their chapels. Comber is prefixed by the title Magister, Master, in 1475, suggesting academic credentials and in 1478 it is explained that he is in decretis bacca larius, a graduate in canon law, a distinction which he shares with the abbot. John Hay was vicar of Clent still in 1500, although his incumbency had been interrupted for some years: he was described as a former abbot. In 1475, one canon, Richard Harborne was described as a metrista, someone skilled in verse. In 1478 John Saunders is called a circator, one who patrolled the dormitories in a circuit to enforce discipline. This is ironic, as he was found guilty of incontinence and apostasy and sent to another abbey in the course of the visitation. Although the canons occupying them display a succession, the posts of responsibility varied hardly at all. In 1488 William Hales, a priest, was in charge of the infirmary and Thomas Cooksey, who had been accused alongside Saunders in 1478 but found innocent, made his first appearance as prior of Dodford Priory, which had been absorbed by the abbey some years previously. This report and that for 1482 are very unusual in giving the title Dominus, Lord or Master, to a number of canons other than the abbot, although others who are clearly priests are titled Frater, as usual. A number of the reports distinguish the priests clearly with the labels sacerdotes or presbiteri. =Diet= The commentary on the Rule of St Augustine recommends: \\"Subdue the flesh by fasting and abstinence from food and drink as much as your health permits.\\" In addition, it urges \\"let distribution of food and clothing be made by your superior.\\" As well as the Friday fast ordained for all believers, a 1464 bull of Pope Pius II obliged Premonstratensians to fast on Wednesdays and Saturdays, throughout Advent and for an extended Lenten period from Septuagesima to Easter. This meant that canons were to eat a meat-free diet most days of the year, so it not surprising that they stoutly defended their fishing rights. Food often became a point of contention and a focus of grumbling. The first extant report by Redman on Halesowen, dated 1478, found the canons complaining about the abbey's bread, which was said to insufficienti, non de frumento sed alliis granis confecto, ministris altaris Christi minus congruo et inhonesto: \\"inadequate, not made of wheat but produced from other grains, unsuitable for ministers of the altar of Christ and shameful.\\" The canons seem to have associated the bread they were offered with that consumed by and distributed to the poor. The Rule condemned murmuring but Redman thought the complaints justified and ordered that the baking of bread be improved and reformed. Ten years later he noted that the convent was using twenty modii (about 180 litres) of wheat and winter wheat each week to make its bread. As it was also using 60 animals a year for beef, 40 for mutton, 30 for pork and 24 for veal, although these large quantities must include an allowance for the many guests. An inventory made after the death of Abbot Thomas Bridge in 1505 found that at \\"Usmore\\" grange there were eight oxen waiting for the cellarer and four fat beefs for the abbey kitchen. It seems unlikely the canons of Halesowen were underfed. =Discipline and infractions= Redman's visitations found canons sometimes chafing against the discipline of the order. Their infractions of order's statutes illustrate the difficulties and demands of the religious life. In 1491 some canons were evidently dining off the premises and Redman strictly forbade eating and drinking in a secular house within a league (three miles or an hour's walk) of the abbey. Eating together as a community was part of cenobium, community or shared life, the term Halesowen Abbey used to describe itself. The Rule states: \\"No one may eat or drink out of the monastery without permission, for this is not in accord with monastic discipline.\\" However, Redman's concern was probably as much with company the canons were keeping during their extramural activities as with maintaining the common life. During the same visitation he ordered that Margery Cook and other women of bad reputation be put out of the abbey premises and not allowed back in. Chastity was a central requirement of the religious life and the Commentary on the Rule is particularly concerned with the male gaze \\"because the unchaste eye is the sign of the unchaste soul.\\" Breaches of chastity were not uncommon, although the penalty varied greatly. The fault for which John Saunders was condemned in 1478 was described as incontinence, or lack of control, invariably meaning a breach of chastity. In the case of Saunders and many others, but not always, this was paired with apostasy, which could mean no more than being absent without permission but might involve an almost total break with the religious life. Redman proposed to send Saunders for three years to Cockersand Abbey, a remote place in an exposed location overlooking the Irish Sea. At the special request of the abbot and canons, he agreed to reduce this greatly: to just eighty days at Dale Abbey in Derbyshire. Moreover, he arranged for Saunders' prompt return when visiting Dale just two days later. Even when severe punishments were actually imposed, they were often revoked at signs of penitence. Thomas Bromsgrove, a priest, was listed at Halesowen alongside Saunders in 1478. He must have got into trouble subsequently, as about 1480 he was at Welbeck Abbey, where he had been sent for apostasy. However, the abbot of Welbeck wrote to Halesowen asking that he return home soon, as he had shown himself submissive. The abbot of Halesowen wrote back in agreement. The leniency probably had divergent results. Saunders was present at the abbey in 1482, went on to become a trusted member of the convent, playing a central part in the election of the next abbot, and was prior by 1491. He was not mentioned in connection with the \\"enormities\\" of 1497. Bromsgrove is never heard of again so, if he did not die before the 1482 visitation, he must have left the order. Over the course of a quarter century Redman made many criticisms or suggestions on the finer points of the liturgy and occasional criticisms, not all justified, about the management of money and resources, but disciplinary matters were often relatively minor: in June 1494 he took up the tonsure at Halesowen, threatening serious penalties if it were not reformed in line with the order's statutes. He also enjoined silence about the visitation. =Enormities discovered= At the next visitation, on 30 August 1497, Redman reported that he had \\"discovered enormities.\\" He seems to have uncovering a substantial ring of canons abusing Halesowen women: the convent had considerable power over Halesowen people in general, as they were its servants and tenants. It was reported of Brother Richard Walsall that he went \\"above and beyond apostasy and disobedience, from the life of a child in its mother's womb being extinguished on his advice, to a very great insurrection of many of the younger men of Hales against the abbot.\\" Redman decreed that he should be imprisoned for ten years at Croxton Abbey in Leicestershire. Richard Bacon, the sub-prior and an important aide to the abbot, was involved in the plot against the abbot and was suspected of cohabiting with local women. He was sentenced to forty days of severe penance and to be transferred to St Agatha's or Easby Abbey in north Yorkshire for three years. Richard Hampton, Roger Wednesbury and Thomas Dudley did not deny their guilt and were sentenced to the same punishment: Hampton and Wednesbury at the Lincolnshire abbeys of Barlings and Newsham respectively, and Dudley at West Dereham Abbey in Norfolk. These three were almost certainly among the younger men who were encouraged in rebellion by Walsall: they are first mentioned together in the 1488 visitation, when all were still novices. The charges against Walsall mention many younger canons rebelling, which suggests rather more than three. Roger Walsall himself was considerably older: a novice in 1478. Bacon first appears, already a priest, in 1482: it could be that he is identical to Richard Wenlock, who was at the abbey in 1478 but subsequently disappears from view. If the five were prepared to procure abortions and to threaten open revolt to cover up their conduct, they were clearly ruthless men and it seems that more were involved to a lesser extent in their conspiracy. Despite the seriousness of the situation, a scandal was never likely because Redman's findings were secret, as he had stressed on his previous visit. It seems unlikely that the punishments he prescribed were carried out fully. There were \\"tearful appeals for mercy\\" on behalf of the five from Abbot Thomas Bridge, from the abbot of Talley, who was reporting to Redman at Halesowen instead of undergoing a visitation at his own abbey, and from their own brother canons. Redman consented to refer the matter to the next provincial chapter. The next visitation of Halesowen was on 17 May 1500, less than three years later. All five of the accused canons ‚Äî even Walsall who had been condemned to ten years of imprisonment ‚Äî were at this time resident at Halesowen Abbey and Bacon was sub-prior, as before. Lands and endowments =Manor of Halesowen= Jurisdictions The grant of the manor of Hales brought the abbey into existence and gave it its name. It was to continue as the main economic and political focus for the abbots and convent. Map of Shropshire (Detached) marked as blue, in the early 19th century. In the Middle Ages Dudley was part of Staffordshire. In 1086 Domesday Book listed the manor of Hala as part of the hundred of Clent in Worcestershire It had 77 householders: 42 villeins 23 bordars, 8 slaves, 2 female slaves, 2 priests and 4 riders. This made it a fairly large settlement by the standards of the time and the tenant-in-chief was Roger de Montgomery, the first Earl of Shrewsbury and a key confidant of William the Conqueror. The immense power of Roger and the importance of the manor to him led to its transfer to his county of Shropshire some time soon after the Domesday survey. Cradley, Warley Wigorn and Lutley, manors held by other lords but part of Halesowen parish, remained within Worcestershire. The rebellion of Robert de Bell√™me, Roger's second son, allowed Henry I to dismantle the dynasty's vast land holdings in the Welsh Marches and Midlands. He retained Hales in royal hands, so Henry II was in a position to make a gift of it to his sister Emma of Anjou, who had married Dafydd, the son of Owain, king of Gwynedd and Prince of Wales. Emma returned the estate to the Crown in the reign of her nephew Richard I but retained the rental income. The situation was confirmed by King John in 1200. There is no direct evidence that Owen, a son of Emma and Dafydd, ever held the manor but an inquisition in the Hundred Rolls for 1273 states that when John granted the estate to the abbey he had acquired it per escoetam cuisdam nomine Oweyn ‚Äî \\"through escheat of someone called Owen.\\" The name of the manor often took the suffix Owen or similar by the mid-13th century.The suffix \\"Owen\\" was generally separated or hyphenated until the 20th century. Cf Holliday's article, which still used the form \\"Hales Owen\\" in 1872. Earl Roger's action had ensured that Halesowen Abbey, throughout its existence, was in an exclave of the historic county of Shropshire enclosed by the boundaries of Staffordshire to the north and Worcestershire on the other three sides.Halesowen remained part of Shropshire until 1844, when it was transferred to Worcestershire. In 1974 it became part of the new West Midlands county in the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley. The royal administration seems to have been caught between ceremony and practicality in dealing with it, sometimes working through the Sheriff of Staffordshire or other notable royal servants, like Brian de Lisle. If this was confusing in relation to the manor, the residents of the wider parish of Halesowen, who looked to the abbey as their church, could be greatly inconvenienced, as it crossed the boundary of the enclave and included settlements that were undoubtedly in Worcestershire. In 1341 there were complaints that some were in danger of being taxed twice because they had been assessed by officials for both Shropshire and Worcestershire.Calendar of Close Rolls, 1341‚Äî3, p. 105. Also confusingly, the abbey, manor and parish were all within the bounds of the Diocese of Worcester but the abbey itself was not subject to it, as Premonstratensian abbeys were independent of the local ordinary. The parish church and the dependent chapels, however, were subject to the bishop. At some time in the reign of Henry III the abbey obtained a charter to \\"make a borough\\" at Hales. Burgages were established at a rent of 12d. The burgesses were to receive any or all of the customs and privileges enjoyed by the burgesses of Hereford, subject to their own decision, and to enjoy common pasture throughout the manor of Hales and common in a defined area of woodland. There was a considerable demand for burgages and this included tenants of the manor wishing to exchange their status for that of the free town. However, the borough seems to exercised little real independence and was not represented in the Parliament of England. In practice, the manorial and borough courts were indistinguishable, dealing with the same issues and having the same jurors. Growing discontent Medieval ploughing with a team of oxen. There is considerable evidence of poor relations and conflict between the abbots of Hales and their manorial tenants. The abbots seem to have exercised a \\"peculiar jurisdiction\\" over probate.The editor of VCH reports the abbots' jurisdiction over probate with implied doubt, as reported without citation by Treadway Russell Nash, an 18th century Worcestershire antiquarian. However, exactly the same is reported of Dale (Stanley Park) Abbey, where the abbot's jurisdiction over probate and marriage were inherited, asserted and exercised after the dissolution by lay lords of the manor, who took the title \\"lay bishop,\\" until the mid-19th century. The jurisdiction was rooted in the Premonstratensian privilege of independence from the local bishop. See . However, the foci of conflict were generally not related to the abbots' ecclesiastical authority but to their practices as landlord. In 1243, the tenants agreed to render to the abbey merchet, suit at the mill, except when it was clearly out of use, and various labour dues: six days' ploughing and six day's sowing in Lent, for each virgate of land. The abbot dispensed with 12¬Ω marks tallage which they owed, and promised that tallage would be applied at Halesowen only when it was imposed on the king's manors. He also confirmed their common of pasture. However, the tenants chafed at the authority of the manorial court and complained that its reach was, in some cases, arbitrary and could not be challenged in the king's courts. The eyre of 1255‚Äî6 heard that Abbas de Hales non permittit homines de Hales placitare vetitum namium in com[itatu]. Immo capet namium eorum et non vult eos deliberare per ballivos domini Regis ‚Äî \\"The Abbot of Hales does not allow the men of Hales to make a plea of vetitum namium (prohibited distraint)Vetitum namium, meaning prohibited or unjust distraint, was a technical legal term for an action to recover a distrained animal or other property that had been taken by the lord as security for the behaviour of the tenant. Generally the first resort when such an item was not returned when due was to ask the sheriff for replevin, or legal restitution. If this failed, the appeal to higher authority was called placitum vetitum namium, \\"plea of prohibited distraint.\\" Cf. Vetitum namium at TheLaw.com. The Halesowen tenants were concerned that prohibition of such an action logically gave the abbot total control over their property, as there was no external check on unjust appropriation of it. in the county. On the contrary he grabs the distrained items and doesn't want a decision via the officials of the Lord King.\\" The privileges of the \\"ancient demesne,\\" granted by King John's charter, allowed tenants to go to law against the abbot in his own court. They used the law to frustrate the abbot at every turn and the dependence of proceedings on compurgation or purging of guilt by oath tended to forge a solidarity among them. When an accused called on support in this way, it was said that he vadit legem - \\"waged law\\" or simply \\"went to law.\\" If this was held to prove their innocence they had fect legem ‚Äî made their law. The abbots' interpretation of their powers as lords of the manor invaded every corner of their tenant's lives. At a court held on 20 June 1274, for example, two men, John of Romsley and Nicholas Sewal, were given until the next court to decide whether or not they would marry the widows assigned to them by the abbey's cellarer, who managed the proceedings of the manorial court. Immediately afterwards, Roger Ketel of Illey was fined 4 shillings, a large sum, for retaining the abbot's heriot, a feudal relief or death duty. This was the conclusion to a fairly protracted dispute: at the court of 9 May he had been placed in day-to-day distraint, detention with no fixed limit in the abbey prison, because he refused to part with the payment due on his mother-in-law's death. The same measure had been applied to his guarantors and a man called Richard of Illey, whose part in the affair is unclear. Heriots were a significant source of income for the abbey: at least three were levied between Ketel's appearances, for the deaths of a husband, a sister-in-law and a daughter. Ketel and his family went on to defy the court on several occasions and he emerged as a leading figure in the tenants' resistance. The court of 3 June 1275 heard that he had failed to answer a summons to the previous session. He argued that he was essoined (had made a valid excuse) for that session, not only for routine attendance but for a special purpose for which the court had summoned him. He \\"made his law\\" by compurgation and escaped punishment. He was fined 5 shillings by the court of 11 March 1277 for giving false evidence in a case involving Thomas Ulf, a man from his own village, and the jury were fined, collectively, twelve shillings for believing him, presumably because they were all suspected of collusion. On 14 March 1278 his son, also Roger, was accused of raising the hue and cry to prevent the abbot's bailiffs taking away a distrained item, perhaps an animal. The issue, though minor, dragged on for some time, with a challenge to the evidence given against the son, and Roger senior repeating the offence. Portrait, thought to be of Edward I, in Westminster Abbey Legitimacy challenged During 1278 the tenants challenged the very basis of abbot's lordship over them. The abbot and convent petitioned the king in parliament to obtain help in their dispute with the men of the manor of Halesowen who, on the plea that from of old they had belonged to the royal demesne, were refusing to render their feudal customs and services. Towards the end of the year the abbot and some canons were assaulted at Beoley. It is unclear how this was related to their dispute with their tenants but Godfrey Giffard, the bishop of Worcester, considered it serious enough to instruct the deans of Warwick, Pershore, and Wick to excommunicate those responsible. It seems that a substantial number of tenants boycotted the abbot's court: Ketel's name is on a list of 21 essoins (excuses for absence) for the 20 November 1279 session that had to be stitched to the side of the record. Instead of rushing to the aid of the convent, Edward I had scented an opportunity to recover royal estates and had a writ of quo warranto issued, compelling the abbot to state under what authority he held the manor. The abbot was able to refer to King John's charter and Henry III's confirmation of 1127, settling the case. Ketel then faced a reckoning in the manorial court, where he was fined 100 shillings for his part in denying the abbot's authority in the king's court. He was allowed to pay in biannual installments of ten shillings, on the Nativity of Saint John the Baptist (24 June) and Christmas Day. The abbot portrayed himself as magnanimous in allowing Roger to keep his land, albeit at the lord's discretion, as a copyholder. Pledges from his neighbours at Illey show that he had support and he may have been bringing a test case. Conflict continued Medieval watermill with undershot wheel. Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS. Bodl. 764 Most of manor court's extant records date from the period after this vindication of the abbot's rights and resistance, sometimes apparently organised, sometimes teasing and playful, continued. The mill and the requirement both to use and to pay for it were innovations that the tenants resented: before the manor was granted to the abbey they had ground their own corn. Numerous tenants were presented at the manorial court for either persisting in grinding their own corn or using mills outside the manor. On one occasion in 1280 nine were presented at the same time, suggesting that there was an organised strike or boycott. Naturally, the nine included Roger Ketel and his friend William Ulf, who maintained that they were in the right and \\"made their law.\\" However, this seems to have been Ketel's last act of defiance. He died within a month of being confined in the stocks for a day and night by two of the abbey's officials, Robert Beley and William Sherburn. This must have happened between 1 July 1282, when he last attended court, in place of Nicholas Richardson, and 25 September 1282, when the abbot was negotiating with his widow, Matilda. His fine was halved to fifty shillings: up to that point nothing had been paid. Matilda made an installment of 9s. 4d., perhaps pointedly short of the ten shillings demanded, leaving 49s 8d. to pay. Related to the mills were the streams and pools, which the tenants persisted in treating as their own, poaching in the pools and \\"ing\\"For an explanation of this practice, see or damming the waterways to feed their families on fish, particularly trout. They argued their case stoutly when presented to the manorial court. In 1280, for example, four men were accused by Roger Hall, the abbot's overseer, of obstructing the flow of the stream to facilitate their fishing: they managed to turn the tables in court and Roger himself was fined. When in 1293 Nicholas Fitz William, a child, was accused of fishing in the forbidden sluices of the abbot's new mill, his flight from the scene was used as evidence of his guilt. However, he explained that he had fled because John, the abbot's bailiff had already struck him twice with his bow, breaking the weapon in the process, and he was afraid of a further drubbing. He was able to call on Roger Hall to give evidence and escaped punishment. The records for 1293 also show children at RomsleyAlthough Romsley was strictly a separate manor from Halesowen, it descended with it from the 12th century. The abbots refused to acknowledge that it was distinct and treated it as a member of Halesowen. Cf. cocking a snook at the abbot, even when he was displaying his most dread powers: infangthief and gallows, which together allowed him to hang felons from his own manor. Magpie on the Gallows, by Pieter Bruegel the Elder A fine of 2d. for the villagers is recorded with the account of the offence. Tensions were perhaps eased when, in 1327, the abbot agreed to commute labour services for a fixed rent. However, landlords' nerves were raw in the years after the Peasants' Revolt, even in areas well outside the main zone of activity in the south east of England. On 12 February 1387 a commission of oyer and terminer was issued on the news that \\"diverse bondmen and bond-tenants of the abbot at Romsley had refused their customs and services for their holdings and confederated by oath to resist the abbot and his ministers.\\"Calendar of patent Rolls, 1385‚Äî9, p. 317. The matter seems to have been treated very seriously, with a considered selection of landed gentry to investigate, reflecting the manor's ambiguous position: Robert Burgulon, a Staffordshire justice of the peace,Calendar of patent Rolls, 1385‚Äî9, p. 254. Thomas Lee, a Shropshire lawyer with previous experience of commissions to suppress rebellion, and John Russell, another lawyer and relative of the powerful Worcestershire landowner Sir John Russell of Strensham. It seems, however, that this was the end of major hostilities: there is no evidence that conflict continued into the next century, probably because the improved position of labourers brought about by the Black Death was now producing concrete improvements. =Small gains= Throughout the 13th century Halesowen Abbey made useful adjustments and small gains, some in outlying areas and some politically significant, to its landholdings. The abbey had a constructive relationship with the holders of neighbouring Frankley manor almost throughout the century. As early as John's reign, before the abbey's formal foundation date, Simon, lord of Frankley, came to an agreement with the convent about the boundaries of their lands along the River Stour, allowing the abbey to construct a mill pond on the river which extended into its own estates. The position of the respective manors seems to indicate that the agreement relates to lands held by the lords of Frankley within Halesowen manor: it seems that the abbey held lands in Frankley too. The de Frankley family seem to have had other estates in the region, including Trysull in Staffordshire. Later, in Henry III's reign, Simon granted the abbey a rent of four shillings for the souls of Rose, his wife, and Elicia, his mother. Simon's son Philip donated the labour services and other dues, including 12s. rent, of William de Stampes, one of his tenants. The abbey granted to Philip land in Frankley which had previously been held by the chaplain Ralph: Philip sublet this land, by 1257, to John Walerand, a cleric, giving the abbey permission to enter the property and distrain if the rent of 40d. went unpaid. and p. 25‚Äî6, no. 86. On 6 November 1276 Emma, Lady of Frankley, Philip's niece or granddaughter, confirmed a rent of 2s. from the land held by Hugh de la Rudinge in Frankley for the soul of her late husband, Anger de Talton. Emma died late in 1298, described by the inquisition post mortem in Worcestershire as the widow of Nicholas de Wheathampstead, a man who had witnessed the charter of Halesowen borough. Her Worcestershire lands were worth only ¬£8 3s. 9d. At Halesowen, in the reign of Henry III, Roger, son of Roger the Cleric, gave several plots of land and permission to build a mill pond and mill, on condition he was allowed to fish in the overflow water and have his corn ground free of charge. During the reign of Edward I John Lytelton, with assent of wife Lucy, granted the abbot and convent all the waste (uncultivated land) they were able to appropriate. John was the uncle of Thomas Lyttelton, who later became lord of Frankley, but it is unclear from his deed precisely which land he was offering to the abbey. =The Lenches= On 12 November 1227 Warin Fitz William and his wife Hawise conveyed to Halesowen Abbey 40 acres of land at Ab Lench. William Marshal, 2nd Earl of Pembroke quitclaimed to Halesowen Abbey the forty acres as well as common of pasture at Ab Lench for the souls of himself and his wife Eleanor, the king's sister. The abbey was to pay the annual rent of 4s at Inkberrow Castle. Subsequently, William granted the rent back to the abbot and canons. Eleanor, the king's sister, was a child of about twelve at the time of the grant: she was to be a living link between the leadership of the baronial opposition to successive kings, as she later married Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester. Almost immediately the abbey became locked in a conflict with local landowners. The abbot and convent were accused of encroaching on the common pasture by erecting buildings and possibly sowing crops. Roger of Lench, possibly the lord of the manor, and Stephen of Lench, initiated an assize of novel disseisin to prevent them, perhaps on behalf of the commoners. However, the abbot protected himself against complete loss by securing from the king on 18 September 1230 a mandate to the sheriff of Worcestershire to prevent his adversaries' demolishing his barns, which were full of seed corn.Close Rolls, 1227‚Äî31, p. 373. He was allowed until the following 2 February to complete the removal of the offending buildings. The small grant to an abbey on a far edge of the county may have had a political motivation but it was followed by other small donations in the Lenches, close to the Worcestershire/Warwickshire border. Around 1230 Roger Rokulf, lord of Church Lench, made several grants to Halesowen Abbey: a virgate of land with its messuage; seven perches of meadow on the way to Aceton (possibly Atch Lench to the south east); a man called Luke, with his chattels, messuage, garden and three selions of land at Church Lench. In 1272‚Äì3 the abbot of Halesowen conveyed for life a messuage and 3 carucates of land in Church Lench and a carucate of land in Ab Lench to Ralph de Hengham, who later became chief justice of the Common Pleas. =Harborne and Smethwick= The manor of Harborne was granted to Halesowen Abbey by Margaret de Redvers (later de Breaut√©), daughter of Warin II fitzGerold. She also granted the advowson of the church, a gift that led to much greater conflict than that of the manor(see below). The manor of Smethwick went with Harborne and was included in Margaret's grant: both were held under the overlordship of the bishop of Coventry and Lichfield. The date of the grant is not certain but it was probably by 1227, when Osbert de Parmentur, a villein, testified in a land dispute that the ten acres of land he held at Harborne were part of the free tenement of abbot of Halesowen. In May 1229 Abbot Richard of Hales sued Margaret to acquit him of the services he owed to the bishop for Harborne and Smethwick. She did not appear to answer the summons and the case was postponed. In January 1230 her attorney appeared in court to deny that she was the mesne lord, or intermediate holder of the land between the bishop and abbey: a claim which the abbot did not dispute. This was a fictitious claim to establish that the abbot was the lord of the two manors, holding them directly from the bishop: in 1284 the abbot of Halesowen was listed as holding one quarter of a knight's fee in Harborne and Smethwick of the bishop, for which he paid one mark, with no mention of a mesne lord. A collection of charters from the reign of Edward I suggest a lively market in development land around Harborne and Smethwick. Abbots Martin and Nicholas made several grants of land to John, son of Adam de Theshale. Most were in the wasteland between the manors and the rents were generally low. One plot next to the road from Weoley to Birmingham cost only one halfpenny per year. However, one plot cost 40s. and the rent was an additional 12d. annually. However, John seems to have made a success of developing his plots and on 14 April 1305 sold all his holdings in Harborne to Richard of Edgbaston and Emma, his wife, for ¬£55. =Rowley= Elizabeth of York, 16th century copy of a contemporary portrait. On Easter Tuesday 1331 John de Hampton granted the manor of Rowley to Halesowen Abbey. For this a canon would offer the full service for the dead daily for his soul and that of his wife Eleanor, his brother Richard, and for all their family, past, present and future.Dugdale, W. et al (eds.) (1846) Monasticon Anglicanum, Vol. 6.2, p. 928, no. 6. A charter of the same year, known from an inspeximus and confirmation of 28 May 1391,Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1388‚Äî92, p. 420 asserted that Edward III granted the manor of Rowley to the abbot and convent at an annual rent of ¬£10 6s. 8d. The point of the king's charter was not simply to confirm the grant of the estate but to assert and clarify his residual interest in it. The estate was to be held under a fee farm grant, not the usual frankalmoin, which meant that the abbey would always have to find the annual rent for it. Equally, on 20 September 1332, the king licensed the abbey to sublet the estate to tenants.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1330‚Äî34, p. 336 The rent paid by the abbot was available for the king to grant to whomever he pleased, and in 1337 he gave it to Alice Plomton, a lady in waiting to his own sister, Eleanor, Countess of Guelders, as an allowance, pending a fuller provision which he promised he would arrange later.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1334‚Äî37, p. 550 On 4 December the king issued a writ de intendendo, a formal notification to the abbot of Halesowen that he owed homage to Alice for the manor of Rowley. In 1486 the rent was one of a large number granted by Henry VIII to his wife, Elizabeth of York. =Warley= The manor of Warley was granted to Halesowen Abbey in 1337/8 by Joan Botetourt. The Calendar of the Patent Rolls has two entries for the initial gift, one a brief notice, dated 2 May 1337, of a licence that describes it as a gift in frankalmoin and intended to finance three canons who will celebrate mass daily in the abbey church for the royal family and Joan's own family.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1334‚Äî38, p. 425. The second, dated similarly, refers to the estate being alienated in mortmain and gives a little more detail about the conditions of the grant, stipulating six wax candles for Joan's anniversary and alms of 20 shillings to be distributed among the poor.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1334‚Äî38, p. 461. The complexities of subinfeudation meant that, in order to make the grant secure, Joan had to win the assent of other parties. The overlordship of Warley had long been held by the feudal barons of Dudley. When John de Somery, the last of his line to hold Dudley Castle, died without issue in 1322, his possessions passed to his sisters and co-heirs, Margaret, who had married John de Sutton, and Joan, the widow of Thomas Botetourte. Margaret and John de Sutton took Dudley Castle. It seems that the overlordship of Warley was divided between the two sisters. The terre tenants or lords of the manor at Warley were the Fokerhams. The charter of 1309 by which Richard Fokerham had acquired the entire manor from his father, William, is extant. A few days before Joan granted Warley to Halesowen Abbey, Richard Fokerham made a grant to Joan, described as Lady of Weoley. In it Richard refers to the manor of Warley as divided into moieties, one of which he inherited from John de Sutton, Lord of Dudley, and leases to Joan, the other of which he simply grants. In early August 1337 Richard quitclaimed the manor of Warley to the abbot and convent of Halesowen. After the Feast of the Assumption, in mid-August, John de Sutton also quit-claimed Warley to the abbot and convent. For this he was to receive the full benefit of their prayers, fasts, vigils, alms, psalms and masses and at death was to receive the same benefits as an abbot. The abbot and convent then granted the manor back to Richard Fokerham for life, to hold in full by service of a rose on John the Baptist's Day. On 23 August Joan obtained an inspeximus and confirmation that wrote into the public record the terms of her donation to the abbey, which were contained in an indenture or chirograph.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1334‚Äî38, p. 495‚Äî6. The abbey agreed that Joan and her successors should sponsor three canons, all at least 20 years of age, who would seek ordination as priests and then take up the chantry responsibilities envisaged by Joan. Each day they were to say mass as well as ' and ', vespers and matins for the dead, for Edward III, and for Joan and her family: she named in particular Thomas Botetourte, her sister Margaret and her nephew John. Substitutes were to be provided while the named canons were unordained or unavailable. Her annual obiit was to be celebrated with all the solemnity previously reserved for the founder of the abbey, Peter des Roches. 20 shillings was to be distributed to the poor in portions of one halfpenny, envisaging an attendance of 480. The canons of the abbey, on the other hand, were to receive a mark (13s. 4d.) each for attending. Six large wax candles, valued at a mark, were to be burned: two each at the altar, at her own tomb and at Margaret's. Joan was also to be mentioned at other commemorations of the dead. In accordance with the king's licence and their indenture, Joan issued a charter to the abbot and convent, granting them the manor of Warley and all that pertained to it, on the Sunday following the Feast of the Circumcision of Christ 1338. She must have died within weeks, as on 4 March the king had her heir, John Botetourt, in wardship and was presenting a parson to the church at Forton, Staffordshire on his behalf.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1338‚Äî40, p. 24. At some point after he came into his estates, her son varied the terms of Joan's grant to allow the abbot and convent to appoint one of the canons to the family chantry.Dugdale, W. et al (eds.) (1846) Monasticon Anglicanum, Vol. 6.2, p. 928, no. 9. The true donor in the grant of Warley appears to have been Richard Fokerham, who was expected to forgo his estate so that Joan could donate it, with nothing apparently in return. However, the token service of a rose was commonly used to disguise underlying financial transactions, especially when lands were encumbered. Medieval property transactions seldom refer to cash considerations, but it is possible that Richard retained Warley for his own lifetime only after the abbey and Joan offered a way to relieve him of heavy debts.In the Angevin period monasteries frequently expanded their holdings by working with Jewish lenders to acquire encumbered estates: see . This was common enough in the Midlands. (See the example of Cistercian Buildwas Abbey apparently working through the Jewish community of Hereford to acquire land: Close Rolls, 1231‚Äì 4, pp. 430-1. However, Jews never had a monopoly of rural credit and after the Edict of Expulsion of 1290 they had no share at all. As well as using Jewish lenders, Premonstratensian Dale Abbey employed a cleric, William of Southwell to find encumbered estates for them, sometimes using feoffment for a single rose to conceal money transactions. See: or partial and earlier online edition at =Granges and leases= Like most religious houses, Halesowen Abbey initially managed its demesne, through a network of granges. Although they might provide accommodation and administrative functions, granges were primarily storage facilities: the word \\"\\" is derived ultimately from Latin ' and, like \\"granary,\\" basically signifies a grain store. An early abbot's difficulties at Ab Lench. resulted from his unlawful attempt to establish a grange on common pasture. The court report of an incident at Romsley in 1271 makes clear that its granges were used to store grain for tenants, as well as for the canons' own consumption and for sale. Coming home on the night of 14 September de cervisia (\\"from the beer\\"), Nicholas was shut out of the house by his mother- in-law, Hawise. He broke in and assaulted Hawise, setting off a brawl in which a neighbour struck Nicholas with a cup and many others became involved. The incident was serious enough for an inventory to be made of the assets of the main culprits. This disclosed that Nicholas had a store of oats unknown quantity in Farley Grange This was just one of the abbey's granges. It was listed with Offmoor, Hamstead and Radewall Granges, Home Grange and New Grange in the Taxatio Ecclesiastica of 1291. Farley Grange also appears in a lease of 1415, along with Blakeley in Oldbury, Owley in Lapal, Radewall in Ridgacre, and Offmoor. Helle Grange is mentioned in the grant of the abbey lands to John Dudley. The 14th century brought economic challenges that stemmed from the demographic crisis, beginning with the Great Famine of 1315‚Äì1317, and greatly intensified from the middle of the century by the Black Death and ensuing outbreaks of plague. Despite the widespread suffering, labour rose in value in comparison with assets, especially land. Halesowen Abbey responded, like other major landowners, by leasing out more and more of its demesne to those who were in a position to cultivate it, and in some cases even selling land, initially in small transactions involving peasants. The Lyttelton charters give glimpses of this process, starting on 25 March (Lady Day) 1335 with the lifetime lease of a tenement at Ridgeacre and two other plots to John Weston of Coventry and his wife for eight shillings per year. At Michaelmas 1369 Abbot Richard de Hampton and the convent leased a plot in the manor of Halesowen to John atte Holt de Hulton for sixty years for a rent of eighteen pence. In January 1378 the abbot and convent of Halesowen granted the reversion of a house and lands to John Broun, Cristina his wife, and their heirs: this was the sale of a small estate, although the price is not stated in the grant. In May 1382 Thomas Wheatcroft of Harborne was allowed to lease various lands in Ridgeacre for six shillings and eightpence. With the new century the length of leases, where specified, increases considerably, although the transactions remain small at first. In April 1404 William Cockes of Halesowen was granted eighty-year lease on a house called Chyltonusplace for four shillings, but a provision was made that he or his heirs could sublet the place for an increase in rent to five shillings. Three years later William Caldewelle acquired three areas of land in Warley and elsewhere on a 99-year lease at a rent of six shillings. Slowly the pattern of tenure was being changed from one of villeins and cottagers to small farmers, with a corresponding change in the landscape. With a lease of 1415 the dealing in leases seems to attain an entirely new scale. A group of clerics and laymen, headed by John Porter, vicar of Kidderminster, took on five entire granges for a term of sixty years, but on puzzling terms: the indenture provided for Halesowen Abbey to pay to the vicar and churchwardens of Kidderminster ¬£400 over 20 years following the death of a named individual, Richard Russeby. The whole story is not apparent in the lease conditions, not least because Blakeley Grange, one of those apparently handed over to the consortium, was on the market again long before the term elapsed: a six-year lease to John de Walloxhale of Halesowen is extant, dating from February 1443. The date 1415 may be a clue to the purpose of the transaction: the king was about to launch the invasion of France that led to the Battle of Agincourt and religious houses had every reason to minimise their tax liability and their exposure to the levying of \\"voluntary\\" loans.The financial pressures are covered by . Tables of lay and clerical taxation are given in However, leases of major assets, and even of crops, to wealthy individuals did become normal during the abbey's final century. In May 1505 Abbot Thomas, Abbot and his house granted a lease to Sir William Lyttelton's steward, Richard Hawkys, of \\"the tythe barne of Illey, and all the tythe corne of almaner greynes, and the tythe hey of Melley felde and Melley medowe yn Illey, with all tythe corne and hey belonging to the Township and Elde of Illey.\\" This lease strictly related to the glebe of the parish church, rather than the abbey's own demesne. The Lady Day dealings of 1522 included a 60-year lease to William Green and his wife Joan of Radewall Grange and a pasture. Demesne land was not entirely leased out, as it was by some abbeys: Valor Ecclesiasticus in 1535 reported ¬£30 from the Halesowen demesne land and ¬£7 from Dodford Priory. However, most of the revenue sources are specified as either redditus (something rendered, rent) or firma (farm, a rented property or right), both indicating a yield from a leasing arrangement. Controlled churches In 1478 the convent at Halesowen Abbey stated that the abbey controlled three churches: the parish churches of Halesowen, Walsall and Clent. Behind this were tales of all the mistakes, competing claims, royal caprice, avarice and deceit that characterised medieval property transactions and made the apparently simple statement of fact a complex and nuanced interpretation of a chequered history. =Halesowen= The abbey had the advowson or patronage, the right to appoint a parish priest, at Halesowen, as it came with the manor. It had always belonged to the lord of the manor, except for a short time, when Dafydd and Emma held it and Dafydd gave it, with Emma's consent, to the abbot of Pershore Abbey. The abbot returned the advowson to King John when he recovered the manor for the Crown. The church was specifically included in John's gift of the manor to Peter des Roches. However, the gift did not include the tithes of the church, which went to the rector. To complete its control of the church the abbey needed to appropriate it, installing a vicar and making an allowance from the tithes to support him. The appropriation did not occur until 1270, when Bishop Godfrey Giffard ordained a vicarage worth ten marks, to be paid in equal installments at Michaelmas and Easter.Dugdale, W. et al (eds.) (1846) Monasticon Anglicanum, Vol. 6.2, p. 928, no. 5. However five years later Bishop Giffard had to resort to a mandate to compel the abbot and convent actually to set aside an allowance for the vicar. A papal bull of 12 October 1281 from Pope Martin IV regularised the situation, along with that of Walsall church. A letter of 14 October 1283 from the same pope confirmed the presentation by the abbot and convent of one of their own canons, Robert de Croule, as vicar of the church. The Taxatio Ecclesiastica of 1291 set the value Halesowen church at ¬£26. 13s. 4d.Halesowen at Taxatio. After reviewing all the documentation relating to the abbey's relationship with Halesowen church, starting with Peter de Roches' original grant, Adam Orleton, Bishop of Worcester, issued an inspeximus and confirmation on 4 January 1331. While the diocese of Worcester had no authority over the abbey itself, Halesowen church preceded the abbey and was subject to the diocese like any other parish church within it. A letter of 1313 from John de Wyke, Prior of the chapter at Worcester Cathedral, to the abbot of Halesowen relates that the prior has recently visited the appropriated parish church and requests that the customary procuration be paid within three days and also that the abbot also send the cope in which he received a benediction at the cathedral. A reference in the Worcester annals relating to 1232 makes clear that a payment of 20 shillings and the gift of the cope were expected from the newly elected abbot, who was presumably blessed in his capacity of patron of Halesowen parish church. The prior had requested his perquisites for eight years without success, as Walter de la Flagge had been abot since 1305, so it is not surprising that he ended his letter with the implied threat that he wished to avoid discord and litigation. Frankley church was dependent chapel of Halesowen church, although the advowson was contested by the monks of Dudley Priory until 1297, when they quitclaimed it to Halesowen after an unsuccessful legal challenge. In 1236 Ralph, its chaplain, confessed before a meeting of the convent and the Archdeacon of Kidderminster that had breached one of the central rights of the mother church, its monopoly of burials in the parish. He promised that it would not be repeated and passed on the offerings made at the burial to the cellarer of the abbey. =Other churches?= Victoria County History adds that by the dissolution Halesowen Abbey had also acquired the advowsons of the churches of Cradley, Warley Wigorn and Lutley but the details are puzzling. All three churches were within the parish of Halesowen, which suggests they were dependent chapels of Halesowen church. At Cradley, for example, there is a tradition of a chapel at a spot called Chapel Leasow, close to a manor house. A chantry of Brendhall, belonging to the chapel of St. Katherine the Virgin at Warley, is mentioned in a 1309 by which William Fokerham transferred the manor of Warley to his son. A rental of Halesowen Abbey, dated 1499‚Äì1500, mentions another chapel at Warley, St Michael's, next to Warley Grange, is mentioned. The three churches or chapels of Cradley, Warley and Lutley are mentioned together not only in the Valor Ecclesiasticus but also when their advowsons and lands were granted, together with all the estates of Halesowen Abbey, to Sir John Dudley in September 1538. The grant also refers to the vicarages and rectories of the churches, which suggests that they were independent, but the same vocabulary is used for St Kenelm's chapel, which was not: possibly all had been detached from Halesowen for the purposes of the sale. All three rectories faded out of existence after the dissolution of the abbey and the Church of England parish churches covering these areas are relatively modern institutions, not directly descended from their medieval precursors. =Walsall and Wednesbury= Walsall church and its chapels were granted to Halesowen Abbey by a charter of William Ruff. William was the lord of the manor of Walsall and the Rous, Ruff or RuffusThese are all versions or translations of the same name, signifying someone with red hair, like William the Conqueror's son William Rufus. Rouse or Rous is Middle English, while the other forms are from Latin. See family had held the manor since Henry II granted it to William's grandfather in 1159. The witnesses to his charter included P(eter des Roches), bishop of Winchester, William (de Cornhill), Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, and R(ichard), abbot of Welbeck.Dugdale, W. et al (eds.) (1846) Monasticon Anglicanum, Vol. 6.2, p. 927, no. 3. The Victoria County History account of the abbey places this around 1227, the time of Henry III's confirmatory charter of the abbey's estates. However, Bishop William's date of death is generally given as 1223, and the more recent VCH account of Walsall's churches gives an approximate date of 1220 which seems more plausible. The matter of the grant was much more problematic than it seemed at first. The church had been granted to the Bishops of Coventry by King John in 1200. It was probably seized by John in 1208, during his conflict with the Church, and its restoration may have been overlooked when the conflict was resolved in 1213 because the see of Coventry was then vacant. Pope Gregory IX, from a manuscript of c.1270 The Court of Common Pleas in session, manuscript c. 1460, in Inner Temple library. In January 1223 William Ruffus was summoned to the Court of Common Pleas to explain why he claimed the advowson of the church of Walsall, where Magister Serlo de Sunning, had been rector since he was installed by King John. Serlo alleged that William had waged a feud against him for some years, seizing his goods and money, harassing his servants, and costing him 200 marks in total. William testified that he did not claim the advowson but only the manor of Walsall: he recognised that the patron of the church was the king. Serlo pointed out that, as a cleric, he had tried to settle the matter with William in a church court but this had been prevented by a writ prohibe ne procedat. William offered trial by combat but the court was apparently disposed to favour Serlo, who was given an opportunity to challenge the writ blocking his resort to a church court. The evidence given by William is entirely inconsistent with his charter: if he did not hold the advowson of the church or even claim it, he could not grant it to Halesowen Abbey. The case seems to have petered out but in 1227 the court confirmed Serlo's position and stated bluntly that the church of Walsall was \\"a gift of the Lord the King.\\" Accordingly, Henry III's recognition of the grant on 15 June 1233, more than a decade after the event, was ambiguous.Calendar of Charter Rolls, 1227‚Äî57, p. 182. Although it acknowledged that Walsall church and its chapels had been given to Halesowen Abbey by William Ruffus, it was phrased as a grant from the king himself, rather than as a confirmation, suggesting that he believed that it was really his to give. Pope Gregory IX's confirmation, issued at Perugia on 16 July 1235 was even-handed, although it introduced a new emphasis: the grant was, he claimed, made by William, bishop of Coventry, with the consent of his chapters, by a gift of Sir William Rufus, with royal assent. Despite both royal and papal confirmations that the advowson of Walsall now belonged to Halesowen Abbey, whatever its previous status and whoever the donor, Henry III presented Osbert of Maidstone to the parish on 3 June 1245.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1232‚Äî47, p. 454. A few weeks later, on 15 July 1245 a further royal charter explicitly made a \\"gift\\" of the church to the abbot and canons from the king.Calendar of Charter Rolls, 1227‚Äî57, p. 287. The abbot began to prepare a bid to appropriate the church but ended the process when he realised that this was not the king's intention. The king's intention for Walsall became even less clear when he made Master Vincent rector of the church on 21 June 1247.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1232‚Äî47, p. 503. It was clear that the immediate requirements of the royal family took precedence, as Vincent was tutor of the king's half-brother, Aymer, who was newly in England, seeking benefices for himself and his household. The abbot gave his approval to the king's presentation, itself an assertion of his own right to choose the rector, and the king agreed later in the year that the abbot would present in future. The abbots were able to present Premonstratensian canons from Halesowen to the church and the records show that they always did so from about 1309 to the dissolution. Henry III now initiated the appropriation of the church and it was enacted by Bishop Roger Weseham on 30 December 1248.Dugdale, W. et al (eds.) (1846) Monasticon Anglicanum, Vol. 6.2, p. 927‚Äî8, no. 4. It provided for a vicarage worth 13 marks, including the net profits of the dependent chapels of Wednesbury and Rushall, and was not to become effective until the death or departure of Master Vincent. A papal confirmation had to wait until 1281, when Martin IV sent it from Orvieto with that for Halesowen itself. A decade later the Taxatio Ecclesiastica valued Walsall church at ¬£12.Walsall at Taxatio. This was evidently enough for Edward I to initiate a quo warranto in 1293, challenging the abbot of Halesowen to justify his patronage of the church. The abbot was able to produce the relevant documentation from the reign of Henry III, so the king's officials switched their attention to Wednesbury chapel, which the king denied was part of Walsall church. The jury found that Wednesbury was a mother church, and so not included in the grant with Walsall. The abbey paid ten marks to restore the situation, regaining the advowson of Wednesbury. Letters patent of 5 May 1301 confirmed not just the advowson of Wednesbury but the abbey's right to appropriate it.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1292‚Äî1301, p. 590 Although a vicarage worth 13 marks at Walsall had been provided for in 1248 it seems that it was not actually instituted until 1309, and this may be why the unbroken succession of Halesowen canons as vicars of Walsall begins in that year. In 1535, according to the Valor Ecclesiasticus, the last vicar, John Turner, had an income of almost ¬£11 from the church, while the tithes brought in ¬£10 for Halesowen Abbey.Dugdale, W. et al (eds.) (1846) Monasticon Anglicanum, Vol. 6.2, p. 929, no. 11. Although the abbey clearly regarded Wednesbury church as a dependent chapel, the king's commissioners evidently regarded it as a rectory in its own right because of the quo warranto of 1293, and they valued it separately at ¬£5 6s 8d. =Harborne: a temporary acquisition= Effigy of Bishop William Kilkenny, former rector of Harborne, in Ely Cathedral. Halesowen Abbey was granted the patronage of St Peter's Church, Harborne by Margaret de Redvers or Rivers, daughter of Warin II fitzGerold Warin had inherited Harborne manor, and with it the advowson of the church, from his father, Henry fitzGerold, who held the manor of the bishop of Coventry. In 1216 King John had ordered Thomas of Erdington, the sheriff of Staffordshire, to seize Harborne: part of a batch of confiscations into the hands of Thomas as a tactic in the First Barons' War. Warin died in 1218. The seizure of Harborne manor threw into question Maragaret's right to dispose of anything appertaining to it, including the advowson. Although Thomas had held Harborne only as part of his function as sheriff, he laid claim to it and the linked manor of Smethwick in 1221. In June 1222 the Court of Common Pleas made an investigation into whether Thomas of Erdington, now deceased, had seisin of Harborne on the day of the death, as this materially affected the inheritance of his son, Giles. Margaret attended the assize with her second husband, Fulk de Breaut√©, and neither objected to it. It seems that her grant of the advowson to Halesowen Abbey came some years later, probably after 1226, when Fulk died. It also seems that she gave the manor of Harborne itself to Halesowen Abbey around the same time. In January 1238 the abbot of Hales was involved in an assize of darrein presentment (an action to challenge the appointment of a cleric) over Harborne against the bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, Alexander de Stavenby. The case was said to involve the prebend of William of Kilkenny, a royal servant with a living at Lichfield Cathedral, who was then on a mission to the Roman Curia. It was respited to the Trinity term. There is great uncertainty about how the case arose, about William's connection with it, and how the bishop became involved at all, as he was the overlord at Harborne, not the lord of the manor. It is possible that the advowson had been bundled with other lands and rights into a benefice for William, although it is unlikely that he was actually a prebendary. However, the case must have gone against Halesowen, as the abbot was compelled to remit all claim to the advowson on 13 October 1238. In 1255, when William of Kilkenny gave up the post of Lord Chancellor to take up his duties as Bishop of Ely, Henry III presented his successor Henry Wingham to the church of Harborne. The king claimed to be acting as guardian of Baldwin de Redvers, 7th Earl of Devon, Margaret's grandson.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1247‚Äî58, p. 415. The appointment had to be cancelled, as the king discovered that a candidate had already been presented by Bishop Roger Weseham. He then obtained the advowson through an assize of darrein presentment and mandated Roger de Meyland, Weseham's successor, to institute Robert of Reading in the church on 28 March 1257.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1247‚Äî58, p. 546. As the advowson had now been reclaimed for the successors of Margaret de Redvers and Warin fitzGerold, it was open to the abbot of Halesowen to argue that Margaret's grant made the abbey the true patron of Harborne church. This he did in October 1260, by a plea that Baldwin should permit him to present a parson at Harborne, only to be told that a further presentation had been made by the bishop, this time with the assent of the Roman Curia. However, the abbot argued that the bishop's candidate, a Roman known as Henry de Ganio, had breached clerical celibacy by taking a wife called Sibilla and so the church was vacant. The bishop was ordered to enquire whether this was so and to report back by 12 November. This seems to have proved the abbot's point, and on 15 May 1261 Baldwin acknowledged the advowson of Harborne to be the right of the abbot and his successors. However, Henry did not simply disappear but continued to argue his case, with papal support, in the chapter of Lichfield Cathedral until 1279. This was accompanied by further wrangling between the abbey and the diocese, which led the abbot of Halesowen to give up all claims to the advowson in favour of the Dean of Lichfield and his chapter in 1278. =Clent= After Edward I's Statutes of Mortmain it became more difficult and expensive to make donations to religious houses and licences had to be secured in advance for a particular grant. On 24 March 1340 Edward III issued a licence for John Botetourte, lord of Weoley (also called Northfield), to alienate in mortmain the advowson of the parish church of Clent and Rowley and its chapels to Halesowen Abbey, along with two acres of land at Clent.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1338‚Äî40, p. 443 John had only just come of age and taken over his manors, including Weoley and Clent, which he inherited from Joan Botetourte. Victoria County History identifies John as Joan's son. Joan's grant of Warley to Halesowen Abbey in return for the establishment of chantries mentions John Sutton II who was the son of Margaret, her sister, but never mentions her own son by name, although he must have been about 19 years old at the time. Like Halesowen, Clent had been a royal demesne and its rents had gone to Emma of Anjou in the reign of Richard I, but John had granted it to Ralph de Somery, Baron of Dudley, in 1204, at a rent of ¬£4 13s. 4d. The rent was paid via the sheriff of Staffordshire: Clent was at that time in Staffordshire, one of a small number of Staffordshire parishes assigned to the diocese of Worcester instead of Lichfield. Joan had presented John Honeworth to the church of Clent and the chapel of Rowley as recently as 1332, and was wise enough to get her action ratified by the king, \\"notwithstanding any rights of the king therein, by reason of the lands of the said Joan or her ancestors having been at any time in the hands of him or his progenitors, or otherwise.\\"Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1330‚Äî4, p. 321. So John's right to use or dispose of the advowson was fairly well established. His charter to Halesowen Abbey was issued at Weoley after the king's licence, and he prefaced it by stating that it was \\"for the health of my own soul, and the souls of my ancestors and descendants.\\"Dugdale, W. et al (eds.) (1846) Monasticon Anglicanum, Vol. 6.2, p. 928, no. 8. The abbot and convent of Halesowen paid the trivial sum of half a mark (6s. 8d.) for a confirmation of the grant by Richard II in 1393.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1391‚Äî96, p. 249 The abbey moved quickly and appropriated Clent church in 1343. As justification, the abbot pointed to the high cost of hospitality, as Halesowen was on a main road, and the recent losses of income: there had been a major fire in the borough of Hales and a decline in veneration of the head of St Barbara one of the abbey's most important relics. John Botetourte confirmed the abbey's appropriation subsequently. The church had been worth ¬£18. 13s. 4d. at the Taxatio of 1291‚Äî2:Clent at Taxatio after the allowance for the vicar, the abbey was making ¬£5 6s 8d. in 1535. In 1467 the abbey was licensed by Edward IV to acquire property worth ¬£10 a year to support a chaplain and maintain the building at the chapel of St KenelmCalendar of Patent Rolls, 1467‚Äî77, p. 396. which seems to have been partly in Clent parish and partly in Romsley: the grant of the abbey lands to John Dudley refers to the church as \\"St. Kenelm in Kelmestowe and Ramesley\\" as well as to \\"St. Kenelm, Salop\\" The annual fair of St Kenelm, beginning on 17 July, was held in the chapel yard, and it is this that seems to have been in Romsley and thus Shropshire. The king's licence specified that the chapel was to be a chantry for the souls of the king and Elizabeth Woodville, the queen. It cost the abbey the very large sum of ¬£40. Dissolution and after =Suppression of the abbey= The Valor Ecclesiasticus of 1535 found that the net income of Halesowen Abbey was about ¬£280, the fourth highest among Premonstatensian houses in England and surpassed only by Torre, Croxton and Cockersand. This placed it well above the threshold of ¬£200, which would have brought dissolution as a lesser monastery in 1536. It seems, however, that Thomas Cromwell extracted from the abbey ¬£4 on 11 January 1536 and the same sum on 26 March 1537. The surrender of the abbey was signed and sealed in its chapter house by William Taylor, the last abbot, on 9 June 1538. It was handed over to Thomas Legh, who wrote a covering letter, confirming the dissolution, to Cromwell three days later, when he despatched the surrender to him. Some time that year or early in 1539 the moveable property, plate, lead, bells, and buildings of the abbey were sold and the receipts entered at the Court of Augmentations under the name of the \\"late commissioner,\\" John Freman. Some items were acquired for Halesowen church. ¬£2 13s. 4. was spent on the organ and a further ¬£2 on its repair and installation. A cross and an image of St kenelm were also purchases and 6d. was spent on transporting three cartloads of \\"stuff\\" from the abbey - possibly unsold material. =Disposal and dispersal of estates= The abbey's lands were granted Sir John Dudley on 1 September 1538 at a very favourable rent of ¬£28 0s. 15d. He granted the \\"mansion of the manor,\\" probably the remains of the abbey, to his servant George Tuckey. Already a successful and wealthy royal servant, Dudley went on the become the most powerful man in the England under Edward VI, acquiring the titles of Earl of Warwick and Duke of Northumberland. However, his estates were confiscated on his fall and execution at the accession of Mary and the abbey estates had divergent histories from that point, with the smaller estates tending to become dispersed through the operations of the market in land. Manor of Halesowen With the fall and execution of Dudley in 1553 the manor of Haleswen was one of the estates which his wife, Jane managed to retain. When she died in 1555 she left it to her sons, who were attainted for treason, the greater share, with the house and land to the value of 100 marks, going to Ambrose Dudley. Ambrose and Henry gave their shares to their younger brother Robert, with the king and queen apparently confirming a third of the manor at this point. Robert seems to have settled the manor on his wife, Amy, and the pair sold it in March 1558. The estate was first transferred for the sum of ¬£3000 to George Tuckey and Thomas Blount, who worked as an agent for Robert Dudley. Anthony Forster, another servant of the Dudley family, who sometimes accommodated Amy at Cumnor Place, also signed away any interest in Halesowen and Warley. On 3 November 1558, only two weeks before Queen Mary's death, Blount and Tuckey bought a licence for ¬£16 13s. 4d. to transfer the bulk of Halesowen manor to Sir John Lyttelton.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1557‚Äî58, pp. 440‚Äî1 There were two major exclusions: some lands around Oldbury retained by Amy Dudley and some lands previously left by Jane Dudley to Lord Hastings and his wife Katherine. Sir John Lyttelton was a Protestant, although always loyal to the state. He lived to the age of 80 and asked to be buried without pomp in Halesowen parish church. His son Gilbert refused to make provision for his family and his sons, headed by John, at one point imprisoned him in his own house to extort a proper settlement of his estates.John, a Catholic sympathiser, had received enough lands from his grandfather to make him independent of his father and succeeded to the main estates, including Halesowen, in 1599. However, only two years later he was implicated in the Essex Rebellion, condemned to death but reprieved, and died in prison. The fate of Halesowen manor once again hung in the balance, as the Lyttelton estates were forfeit to the Crown. However, his wife Meriel, daughter of Thomas Bromley, a former Lord Chancellor, managed to have the estates returned by James I on 17 June 1603, shortly after his accession. The disaster had left the family burdened by debt but Meriel patiently rebuilt its fortunes. As part of her retrenchment campaign, she had the weekly market and annual fair reinstated by a proclamation of the Borough of Halesowen on 13 June 1608. She claimed that the people of Halesowen had resorted to Sunday trading because the market and fair had lapsed. In May 1609 she was able to justify this by obtaining an exemplification of the various royal grants to Halesowen, including a grant by Edward I to the abbey of licence to hold a market every Monday, as well as a fair on St. Barnabas Day (11 June) and three following days. The manor and borough of Halesowen thus recovered some of the privileges formerly held by the abbey and the Lytteltons continued as the dominant landowners locally for more than three centuries. Other estates John Dudley was one of those who had profited from the improvidence of his second cousin, John Sutton, 3rd Baron Dudley. In 1537 he had acquired from him a package of estates and lordships around Dudley, including Dudley Castle itself. Although Dudley had paid ¬£4000, there was some sympathy for his relative, who became known as \\"Lord Quondam.\\" The unfortunate baron died in September 1553, shortly after the Duke of Northumberland's execution, and was succeeded by his son, Edward Sutton, 4th Baron Dudley. As she regarded him as one of her valued supporters, Queen May restored Dudley Castle to him, although she had earlier granted it to John Lyttelton, and rewarded him further with estates confiscated from John Dudley. Among these were Harborne, Rowley and Smethwick, all formerly important estates of Halesowen Abbey.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1554‚Äî55, pp. 22‚Äî3. Edward Sutton, 5th Baron Dudley, who succeeded to the title in 1586, was soon in deep financial difficulties and was pursued by the Privy Council for failure to maintain his family, as well as facing the Star Chamber over his violent feud with the Lytteltons. In 1604 he conveyed Harborne and Smethwick by fine of lands to Charles Cornwallis for ¬£400. The manor was described as containing 100 messuages, 10 cottages, 10 tofts, 100 gardens, 400 acres of land, 100 of meadow, 400 of pasture and 60 of woods. Cornwallis had a colourful political and diplomatic career as a member of the Blessed Parliament and ambassador to Spain, and spent a year in the Tower of London when his anti-Scottish views upset James I. Although a Suffolk man and a Norfolk landowner, he spent time at Harborne in his later years and died there in 1629. His eldest son, the essayist William Cornwallis, predeceased him so the manor of Harborne and Smethwick passed to his grandson Charles, who sold it to Thomas Foley in 1661. Thereafter the manor and its lands were sold on at intervals. By the early 20th century the lord of the manor was the Marquess of Anglesey and Lord Calthorpe a major landowner.Calthorpe is still remembered in the region by the park which bears his name, which he formally presented to Birmingham (although it was created by his father), and as the donor of the site for the University of Birmingham. John Dudley seems to have sold to William Scudamore the former Halesowen Abbey lands in Church Lench and possibly Ab Lench. William died in 1560 but his young son John Scudamore only came into his lands in 1563, after a wardship: he also inherited large estates from his grandfather in 1571. He and his son James were initially Catholic sympathisers but changed their allegiance and prospered as courtiers, representing Herefordshire in the Parliament of England over more than three decades, and becoming important patrons of the arts and science. However James predeceased his father and was succeeded as heir by his son John, who became a baronet in 1620 and in 1628 the first Viscount Scudamore. He sold the manor of Church Lench to William Keyt in 1627 and it remained with the Keyt baronets until the death of Sir William Keyt at his own hand, in a fire at his estate in Gloucestershire. Thereafter,the manor and lands were dispersed more rapidly through repeated sales. Notes Citations References   * At Hathi Trust.

The books were illustrated by Russ Nicholson and the maps supplied by Geoff Wingate. It was set in the author's own fantasy world of \\"Legend\\" which was also the setting for their Dragon Warriors role playing game. The world of Legend The world of Legend has noticeable parallels with Earth in the late 10th century AD, with strong elements of Christian, Greek, Roman, Norsemen and Arabian mythology. Crusaders of the 'True Faith' (an analogue of Christianity) have defeated the Ta'ashim people (an analogue of Islam) and conquered the Outremer. As the timeline approaches 1000 AD, Millennialist fever grips many. After emerging victorious from the Battlepits of Krarth (book 1), where a deadly contest is held every thirteen months, you - a hero (or a group of heroes) belonging to the True Faith - are involved in a bloody battle against a pack of werewolves (book 2). Having defeated the pack, you receive a jeweled scabbard from a dying harpist - it's the scabbard of the Sword of Life, dubbed Blood Sword in popular folklore. You will need to find the missing parts of the sword - first the hilt, then the blade - in order to slay the coming True Magi, who were killed in the Blasting - a major cataclysm - six hundred years ago, and now want to rule the world on their return. Only the Blood Sword, the bane of the undead, can stop them. So you travel to the northern land of Wyrd, where the Warlock- King guards the hilt from inside his Palace of Eternal Dusk. Then your journey takes you south (book 3), to Crescentium - the main port of the Outremer. There you will find several allies - among whom the assassin leader Hasan-i- Sabbah - who will help you find the blade. But your old enemy Aiken - a Yamatese warrior, known in the lands of the West by the name of Icon the Ungodly - will eventually find you, and after you defeat him for the second time Icon falls down to Sheol, the realm of the dead, taking the Blood Sword with him. So you will have to enter Sheol (book 4), a patchwork of hells from different mythologies, where a mysterious man who goes by the name of the Traveller takes you through a long journey which ends before archangel Azrael. Here you discover that the Traveller is no one else but Icon, your arch-enemy, whom you finally manage to kill, thus retrieving the Blood Sword. In the last book, while the Millennialist fever is engulfing the continent, you travel north once more to enter the citadel of Spyte, where the True Magi are going to reincarnate at midnight at the end of the millennium. You finally defeat them with the help of Karunaz, a Ta'ashim noble warrior, son of Hasan-i- Sabbah. It's now midnight of Winter's Eve, 999 AD - Judgment Day has come, and you are rewarded with eternal life in Paradise. Gameplay The book series differed from many of the Fighting Fantasy and Choose Your Own Adventure type books of the era by being designed for multi-player, co-operative play (though there was also a single-player option, and one player could control more than one character at a time). A party could consist of up to four players, with each player being either a Sage, Enchanter, Trickster or Warrior. Each of the classes was well-balanced and offered a different playing style from the others. Characters advanced in level, gaining power as the series progressed, and were carried forward from book to book, giving the experience of one long story. Each player was autonomous - often paragraphs would be for one player's eyes only, and he would be privy to some information that he was free to withhold from the rest of his party. =Combat= Combat took place on mini- maps consisting of squares, with players able to use tactical combat options to defeat their foes. This added a dimension of realism to the game, for players had to move to their enemies before fighting them, and if it were a surprise attack, their enemies would start near or next to them. Some mini- maps include a square for fleeing; if the players wish to flee from the battle, they must move to that square before turning to the appropriate paragraph. Sometimes there would be impassable obstacles on maps which characters would have to get around, or squares impassable to players but usable by monsters (e.g.: burning hot coals). =Classes= *Warrior: The typical hack-and-slash, honourable fighter. He can absorb and deal the most damage, but does not have any unique skills and must also act honourably or face penalties. *Trickster: A cunning and charismatic thief, albeit one with a heart. *Sage: A warrior-monk with mystical powers such as levitation and healing, as well as knowledge of ancient lore. There are many occasions when a Sage's wisdom is called upon to solve a problem or provide more information about something. *Enchanter: A mage who starts the game with a long list of spells. =Attributes= *Fighting Prowess: A measure of how powerful a fighter the character is. *Psychic Ability: An indicator of the character's resistance to attack spells and (in the case of an Enchanter) his or her aptitude for magic. *Awareness: The character's speed, dexterity and cunning. *Endurance: Measures the character's state of health; wounds are deducted from Endurance and if it reaches zero, the character dies. Books in the series The series consisted of five books: 1 : The Battlepits of Krarth \\"Every thirteen lunar months the Magi of Krarth hold a deadly contest to see which of them will rule that bleak and icy land. Teams of daring adventurers are sent down into the labyrinths that lie beneath the tundra, each searching for the Emblem of Victory that will win power for their patron. Only one team can survive. The others must die.\\" 2 : The Kingdom of Wyrd \\"From the Palace of Eternal Dusk, the Warlock-King holds his realm in thrall. His tyrannized subjects live in perpetual fear, for they know their evil monarch can see into the minds of others and slay them in their dreams. Only outsiders from beyond the boundaries of Wyrd may slay the tyrant - and they will need all the courage and skill that mortals ever can possess.\\" 3 : The Demon's Claw \\"Will you survive the perils of the desert city of Crescentium? The wandering ghouls and assassins? The half-human monsters? The dreaded Seven-in-One? For this is a land of sorcery and treachery - where you will encounter terrors and wonders more fabulous than you had ever dared imagine - the great Roc, the three wishes, the ship of the Pirate-King, the flying horse, the magic of the beautiful Psyche. And who shall win the Sword of Death, the Demon's Claw itself?\\" 4 : Doomwalk \\"Of all the desperate adventures, this is the most desperate - and the most vital. Only two years remain before the year 1000, when the Magi's power will have waxed full and the moment of their reincarnation will be at hand! All is not lost; if you can recover the fragments of the Blood Sword, the Magi can be opposed. But to do so, you must travel to the land of death...\\" 5: The Walls of Spyte \\"In the darkening sky above, five ominous stars have come into conjunction for the first time in 200 years. Out of the vault of the sky they cast their baleful influence across the frozen landscape. They are the disembodied spirits of the last of the Magi, seeing the return to the mortal world at midnight and ushering in a new era of terror. You wield the sole force in the world capable of destroying the Magi. The Sword of Life is mankind's only hope but it is no guarantee of victory. The Magi have had two centuries of exile to plan their reincarnation. To stop them you will need greater courage and strength than ever before!\\" External links *Hubertian Maps - The Lands of Legend *Advanced Dragon Warriors - new professions: Trickster, Warrior, Enchanter Gamebooks Series of books Fantasy gamebooks ","title":"Blood Sword (gamebook series)"},{"id":"3512447","text":"Bargoed railway station serves the town of Bargoed in the county borough of Caerphilly, South Wales.

Among other tracks, the album features Davis' interpretations of two contemporaneous pop songs: Cyndi Lauper's \\"Time After Time\\" and Michael Jackson's \\"Human Nature\\". During the recording sessions, bass player Darryl Jones introduced Sting to his longtime idol Miles Davis. Sting was startled when Davis asked him if he could speak French, and since he did, Miles asked him to translate the Miranda warning into French and yell it into the microphone against a backing track. It marked the ending of Davis's 30-year association with Columbia Records, although the label released the 1984 recording Aura in 1989, and would release many archival recordings in later years.

Life and work  De Silva was born in Zafra in the Spanish province of Badajoz. He served in the military in Flanders, and later was appointed governor of Badajoz. In 1612, Philip III, King of both Spain and Portugal, chose De Silva as his ambassador to the court of Shah Abbas, the Safavid monarch. Before he could reach Persia, however, De Silva was detained in Goa due to his strong disagreements with its Portuguese viceroy, and he did not arrive at his destination until October 1617. De Silva's embassy was Philip III's return to the two Abbas I had sent to him shortly before, one of them in the person of the Englishman Robert Shirley and the other in the ones of the Persian Dengiz Beg and the Portuguese Augustinian friar Antonio de Gouvea. During his stay in Persia, De Silva dealt with various diplomatic issues of importance, including the sealing of an alliance against the Ottoman Empire, a longstanding enemy of the three powers involved: Persia, Portugal and Spain. De Silva travelled extensively throughout Persia, visiting the cities of Shiraz, Qom and Isfahan among others. He went to see the ruins of Persepolis, and described its splendours in a vivid letter to Alfonso de la Cueva, marqu√©s de Bedmar. This letter made a great impression in the learned circles of Europe, and was quickly translated into Latin and English. In Isfahan he met the Italian traveller Pietro della Valle, who later went to Goa following the way De Silva had done to reach there. On his travels, De Silva had amassed a large collection of rare art objects; these he tried to take home with him to Spain when his sojourn ended in 1619. He wrote a full account of his travels under the title Totius legationis suae et Indicarum rerum Persidisque commentarii. It was translated into French by the Dutchman Abraham de Wicquefort in 1667. The original manuscript is preserved today in the National Library in Madrid, and was published completely for the first time there in 1903. De Silva's memoirs contain a great deal of detailed information relating to Persian geography, history and culture. He described, among many other things, the funerary practices of the Zoroastrians, the sport of organized bull-fighting in Persian towns, and the cultivation of date palms in southern Iran. His narrative is now regarded as a valuable source document on early 17th-century Persia. De Silva's return trip to Spain was eventful and frustrating. He reached Ormuz and Goa in 1621, and then, in 1622, Mozambique, but too late in season to round the Cape of Good Hope he had to go back again to Goa. When, after a long delay, he was able to re-embark for Spain. He died at sea before reaching his destination.

All compositions and arrangements are by Mikkelborg, who created the suite in tribute when Davis received the L√©onie Sonning Music Prize in December 1984, the year Decoy was released.A prestigious award, mostly given to classical composers and musicians; see official website . Miles Davis was the first non-classical musician to receive the prize, and was particularly happy to receive the prize when he learned that Igor Stravinsky was one of the earlier recipients.Prior to the concert, Miles Davis was announced to only play for the last ten minutes of the suite. He eventually played for over 40 minutes, also playing Cyndi Lauper and Rob Hyman's \\"Time after Time\\" and his own \\"Jean Pierre.\\"According to http://www.allmusic.com/album/r106102 Decoy was released in 1983. This was Miles Davis' final album released in his lifetime.  Background  The main theme consists of 10 notes, yielded by the letters \\"M-I-L-E-S-D-A-V-I-S\\" (see BACH motif, and Schoenberg hexachord \\"EsCHBEG\\", and the chart at Musical notes#Accidentals). It is introduced at the beginning over a sustained chord of these same notes. The following 9 movements of the suite represent the colours Mikkelborg sees in Miles's aura. The music is scored for an extended jazz big band, and the core of the band is formed by the Danish Radio's Big Band, featuring Niels-Henning √òrsted Pedersen, Thomas Clausen and Marilyn Mazur.It was during the Aura sessions that Davis became fascinated with Mazur's wide range of percussion talents, and he subsequently hired her for his touring band. Notable international guests such as John McLaughlin and Davis' nephew Vince Wilburn are featured.At the December 1984 concert, guitarist John Scofield ‚Äî then member of Davis' touring band ‚Äî was featured as guest. The sessions took place in Copenhagen in 1985 at Davis' own initiative, as he had been very honored and satisfied with the suite. It was the first time Miles Davis had recorded with a big band for over 20 years. Aura, however, is not a conventional big band jazz album. The music is perhaps best categorized as fusion jazz with a strong flavor of modern classical music, as many of the orchestral passages reveal Mikkelborg's inspiration from composers like Olivier Messiaen and Charles Ives.The 10-note opening theme is played freely against a dissonant background chord in a manner reminiscent of Ives' \\"The Unanswered Question\\". Although the album was recorded at Easy Sound Studios in Copenhagen in 1985, contractual issues delayed its release until 1989. The album won a Grammy Award in 1990 for Best Jazz Instrumental Performance.  Critical reception  Aura was well received by music critics. Allmusic editor Thom Jurek described its music as \\"an amalgam of classical impressionism, European new music, jazz, rock, electronic, and other genres.\\" He called the album Mikkelborg's \\"fine parting gift\\" for Davis and wrote, \\"As a tribute and separate orchestral work, it's quite moving and beautiful, full of moody interludes and evocations of nuance, color, texture, and dynamic. With Davis added, soloing in his trademark muted, rounded warmth, the music becomes almost breathtaking.\\" Wes Long of PopMatters called Aura \\"ruthlessly inventive\\", an \\"ever-moody masterpiece\\", and \\"quite possibly the last monumental effort\\" from Davis. Fred Kaplan of New York commented that the release emerged from an era of \\"mechanical rut\\" for Davis and called Aura \\"a jolting synthesis of jazz, rock, and Messiaen-influenced classical music that lit up a future path lamentably unfollowed.\\" Todd S. Jenkins of All About Jazz commented that the album \\"successfully blends Miles‚Äô electric style with the feel of his earlier big-band works with Gil Evans, another of Mikkelborg‚Äôs prime inspirations.\\" He wrote in conclusion, \\"Mikkelborg‚Äôs work offered Miles the chance to touch once more upon many of the phases his career had touched and then sailed past. If any post-Bitches Brew album by Miles should be considered essential, this is the one. Pure magic from beginning to end.\\" In Christgau's Record Guide: The '80s (1990), music critic Robert Christgau cited it as Davis' best release during the 1980s. In The New Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), music journalist Paul Evans called Aura \\"an adventurous and pointedly non-pop-oriented big-band suite\\".Evans et al. Brackett & Hoard (2004), p. 219.

Reynolds Tobacco Company. History Doral was introduced in 1969 and is available nationwide in the United States. Originally a premium brand, the cigarettes were re-branded in 1984 as a savings brand. This made Doral the officially first branded cigarette to be in the value-savings market. In 1984, The New York Times tested various \\"low tar\\" and \\"low nicotine\\" brands and the tests concluded that Doral King Size and Doral King Size menthol had 5 MG of tar, 0,4 MG of nicotine and 3 MG of Carbon monoxide. In 1999, it was reported that, due to R.J. Reynolds' sponsoring of various sport sponsorships, the brand was the third largest tobacco brand after Marlboro and Newport. In October 2014, it was reported that R.J. Reynolds might add another brand that had to be sold off to Imperial Tobacco (along with the Kool, Salem, Winston and Maverick brands) to secure the approval of the Federal Trade Commission to purchase the Lorillard Tobacco Company. This did not happen however, and R.J. Reynolds still sells the brand today. Doral currently receives limited support from R.J. Reynolds, as Pall Mall has taken over as the company's primary discount brand. Advertisement Vintage Zippo Cigarette Lighter Commemorating the 25th Anniversary of Doral Cigarettes R.J. Reynolds made various poster adverts to promote the Doral brand. Magazine advertisements were done in comic strip format; a memorable example had a lion tamer worried about what his Doral pack sang.

The male has a slate-blue bill which changes to bright-blue during the breeding season, hence the duck's common name. The male has deep chestnut plumage during breeding season, reverting to a dark grey. The female retains black plumage with brown tips all year round. The duck is endemic to Australia's temperate regions, inhabiting natural inland wetlands and also artificial wetlands, such as sewage ponds, in large numbers. It can be difficult to observe due to its cryptic nature during its breeding season through autumn and winter. The male duck exhibits a complex mating ritual. The blue-billed duck is omnivorous, with a preference for small aquatic invertebrates. BirdLife International has classified this species as Near Threatened. Major threats include drainage of deep permanent wetlands, or their degradation as a result of introduced fish, peripheral cattle grazing, salinization, and lowering of ground water.BirdLife Species Factsheet Taxonomy The blue- billed duck was described in 1836 by ornithologist John Gould. The specific name australis is derived from the Latin for \\"southern\\", hence Australian. Description The tail feathers for both the male and female are made up of thick, spine-like shafts. The tail is usually held flat on the surface of the water, or held erect when defensive. The male also holds the tail erect during courtship displays. The feet are quite powerful, which aids in swimming and diving. The duck sits low in the water in comparison to other ducks. During breeding season, apart from the aforementioned bright-blue bill, the male's head and neck are glossy black, and the back and wings are a rich chestnut. During the nonbreeding season, the head changes from its glossy black to black with grey speckles, and its body changes from chestnut to dark grey. Some males retain breeding plumage throughout the year. The female's plumage does not change throughout the year. Its head is dark brown, and the back and wings consist of black feathers with a light-brown tip, giving a mottled appearance, although the National Parks and Wildlife publication on O. australis refers to bands on each feather rather than a single feather-tip colouration. The female's bill is dark grey-brown, and its feet are grey-brown, while the male's feet are grey. Both sexes have brown irises. Immature blue-billed ducks resemble the adult female, though paler with a grey-green bill. Distribution and habitat The blue-billed duck is endemic to Australia's temperate regions. Its range extends from southern Queensland, through New South Wales and Victoria, to Tasmania. The species is also widespread in the south west of Western Australia. O. australis rarely appears on the New South Wales coastline except during times of drought. It is in greatest abundance in the Murray-Darling basin. The blue-billed duck is almost entirely aquatic. While they have been observed on land, they have difficulty walking, exhibiting a penguin-like gait. During non-breeding season, many ducks gather in flocks totalling several hundred, especially juveniles and younger adults, in open lakes or dams in autumn and winter, far from the shore. For the rest of the year, during breeding season, the blue-billed duck prefers deep, freshwater swamps, with dense vegetation including cumbungi Typha orientalis (broadleaf cumbungi) and Typha domingensis (narrow-leaved cumbungi); although it has appeared in lignum swamps in more coastal areas, especially in drier seasons. They have also occasionally been found in large rivers and saline water bodies such as billabongs. Ecology and behaviour The behaviour of O. australis depends on its breeding cycle. The ducks gather in large flocks on lakes during the winter while not breeding, although some mature adults remain in vegetative swamps and continue to breed. They will also fly more frequently, probably due to the open habitat, and escape threats by flying. While breeding, O. australis is secretive and wary, and it will swiftly and quietly dive under water if threatened, resurfacing a large distance away, rather than escape by flying. The blue-billed duck has a low quack, which is seldom heard. The courting repertoire of the male is very complex and elaborative. It includes such behaviour as rolling the cheek on the back, dab-preening (also sometimes performed by females), and sousing, where the head is thrown into the water in a prone position, and the back arched as if in spasm, with possibly the legs throwing spray above the body. After the courtship ritual, and a vigorous chase, copulation follows with the female completely submerged. The birds then separate and preen themselves. In preparation for laying eggs, the female builds the nest, at which time the male will mostly desert the female. =Diet= Oxyura australis is omnivorous, where invertebrates as well as seeds, buds, and fruit of emergent and submerged plants are eaten. The duck feeds underwater by sifting mud with its beak. O. australis does have a preference for small invertebrates, including molluscs and aquatic insects such as chironomid larvae, caddis flies, dragonflies and water beetle larvae. Its diverse range of food is reflective of a relatively abundant habitat. The chironomid larvae are quite common in inland cumbungi swamps, and therefore make up a large portion of the diet of O. australis during its breeding season. Blue-billed ducks can stay underwater for 10 seconds on average while feeding. =Reproduction= There is evidence that O. australis is partly migratory, with movement from breeding swamps of inland NSW to the Murray River during autumn and winter. Frith claims O. australis is the most migratory of all Australian ducks. Marchant and Higgins discredits this regular yearly migration, due to juveniles and young adults searching for new breeding grounds, especially on the fringes of the duck's range, with mature breeding adults often remaining. Indeed, experienced dominate adults are sedentary in breeding swamps since migration would expend energy that instead would be used for breeding. Year-long sedentary adult breeding is confirmed by the observation that the laying period of ducks in captivity is continuous, reflecting ‚Äúopportunistic breeding‚Äù. Any variation in non-captive laying is in accordance to water-levels and hence abundance of food, a fact in contrast to Frith's description of reproduction being tied to the months between September to November. Clutch size ranges from 3 to 12, the most common being 5 to 6, according to Marchant and Higgins. Large clutch sizes indicate two females laying eggs in the one nest. It appears that a female will sometimes parasitise another's efforts at incubation, described as ‚Äúfacultative parasitism‚Äù, by laying ‚Äúdump clutches‚Äù in nests other than her own. There is also some evidence of the duck laying its eggs in nests occupied by other water-birds. The incubation is 26 to 28 days. After hatching, the young remain in the nest for 1 day, and are then led by the female from the nest. The young are relatively independent of the parents, being able to feed themselves immediately. The female will protect her brood, including hatchlings from dump clutches of other females. At 8 weeks, ducklings are of a similar size to the parents. Within one year, most have full adult plumage. Yearlings in captivity were observed to be able to breed. Conservation Two substantial land uses combine to have a significant impact on the blue-billed duck. These are: the regulation of wetland ecosystems through drainage, flood mitigation and water harvesting; and vegetation loss due to clearing, overgrazing and salinity. Both result in smaller habitat sizes suitable to water birds. To counteract these impacts, the Department of Environment and Conservation has devised several strategies to increase the blue-billed duck's population. They include retaining sustainable water flows and developing salinity management plans and farm management plans. The Australian population of blue-billed ducks is estimated to be 12 000, although the creation of artificial wetlands such as water treatment works disguise the number occurring in natural wetlands. The blue-billed duck's vulnerable status has been de-listed for the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, although they are currently recognized as vulnerable in NSW, according to the Department of Environment and Climate Change NSW. The blue-billed duck is listed as threatened on the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act (1988).Department of Sustainability and Environment, Victoria Under this Act, an Action Statement for the recovery and future management of this species has been prepared.Department of Sustainability and Environment, Victoria In Victoria, the blue-billed duck is also listed as endangered on the 2007 advisory list of threatened vertebrate fauna within the state. Relationship with humans The health of wetland ecosystems can be determined by the abundance of waterbird species. A decline in bird numbers provides a warning that the natural ecological functioning of the freshwater system is at risk. Despite short term gains for farmers through permanent flooding, sustainability of wetland systems would decrease. Any long-term decrease in the population of waterbirds such as O. australis, which continue to breed yearlong, irrespective of drought conditions by seeking out suitable habitat, would make excellent indicators for wetland health. Any long-term decrease in the duck's population would therefore be caused by habitat loss through factors such as salinity and overgrazing more so than drought. Other comments More field research is needed into the average lifespan of O. australis in the wild; although, based on the high number of eggs in a clutch, and maturing 12 months after hatching would indicate a short life span of less than 10 years. Captive ducks were still breeding at 16 years. Further research into the accuracy of using O. australis as an indicator for habitat health, among other waterbirds, is needed, considering its ability to breed every season despite the effects of drought. Any long- term decrease in populations of O. australis would therefore more strongly reflect poor wetland ecosystem health, without the confounding effects of natural drought cycles.

Following the work of sexuality theorist Michel Foucault, the validity of an ancient Greek model for modern gay culture has been questioned.Blanshard, Alastair J. L. \\"Greek Love,\\" essay at p. 161 of Eriobon, Didier Insult and the Making of the Gay Self, transl. Lucey M. (Duke University Press, 2004 In his essay \\"Greek Love\\", Alastair Blanshard sees \\"Greek love\\" as \\"one of the defining and divisive issues in the homosexual rights movement. Historic terms As a phrase in Modern English and other modern European languages, \\"Greek love\\" refers to various (mostly homoerotic) practices as part of the Hellenic heritage reinterpreted by adherents such as Lytton Strachey; quotation marks are often placed on either or both words (\\"Greek\\" love, Greek \\"love\\", or \\"Greek love\\") to indicate that usage of the phrase is determined by context. It often serves as a \\"coded phrase\\" for pederasty,Halperin, David M., Winkler John J., and Zeitlin, Froma I., introduction to Before Sexuality: The Construction of Erotic Experience in the Ancient Greek World (Princeton University Press, 1990), p. 19 or to \\"sanitize\\" homosexual desire in historical contexts where it was considered unacceptable.Pulham, Patricia, Art and the Transitional Object in Vernon Lee's Supernatural Tales (Ashgate, 2008), p. 59. The German term griechische Liebe (\\"Greek love\\") appears in German literature between 1750 and 1850, along with socratische Liebe (\\"Socratic love\\") and platonische Liebe (\\"Platonic love\\") in reference to male-male attractions. Ancient Greece became a positive reference point by which homosexual men of a certain class and education could engage in discourse that might otherwise be taboo. In the early Modern period, a disjuncture was carefully maintained between idealized male eros in the classical tradition, which was treated with reverence, and sodomy, which was a term of contempt. Ancient Greek background Zeus carrying away Ganymede (Late Archaic terracotta) In his classic study Greek Homosexuality, Kenneth Dover states that the English nouns \\"a homosexual\\" and \\"a heterosexual\\" have no equivalent in the ancient Greek language. According to Dover, there was no concept in ancient Greece equivalent to the modern conception of \\"sexual preference\\"; it was assumed that a person could have both hetero- and homosexual responses at different times.Dover, Kenneth J., Greek Homosexuality (Harvard University Press, 1978, 1989) Evidence for same-sex attractions and behaviors is more abundant for men than for women. Both romantic love and sexual passion between men were often considered normal, and under some circumstances healthy or admirable. The most common male-male relationship was paiderasteia, a socially-acknowledged institution in which a mature male (erastƒìs, the active lover) bonded with or mentored a teen-aged youthSacks, David, A Dictionary of the Ancient Greek World (Oxford University Press, 1995) (eromenos, the passive lover, or pais, \\"boy\\" understood as an endearment and not necessarily a category of age Johnson, Marguerite and Ryan, Terry, Sexuality in Greek and Roman Society and Literature: A Sourcebook (Routledge, 2005), pp. 3‚Äì4; Anne L. Klinck, \\"'Sleeping in the Bosom of a Tender Companion': Homoerotic Attachments in Sappho,\\" in Same-sex Desire and Love in Greco-Roman Antiquity and in the Classical Tradition of the West (Haworth Press, 2005), p. 202; Jane McIntosh Snyder, The Woman and the Lyre (Southern Illinois University Press, 1989), p. 3.). Martin Litchfield West views Greek pederasty as \\"a substitute for heterosexual love, free contacts between the sexes being restricted by society\\".West, M. L.,Studies in Greek Elegy and Iambus, Walter de Gruyter and Co. (1974), page 75 Greek art and literature portray these relationships as sometimes erotic or sexual, or sometimes idealized, educational, non-consummated, or non-sexual. A distinctive feature of Greek male-male eros was its occurrence within a military setting, as with the Theban Band, though the extent to which homosexual bonds played a military role has been questioned.Leitao, David, \\"The legend of the Theban Band\\", in M. Craven Nussbaum and J. Sihvola, The Sleep of Reason: Erotic Experience and Sexual Ethics in Ancient Greece and Rome, Chicago University Press (2002), pp. 140‚Äì150 Some Greek myths have been interpreted as reflecting the custom of paiderasteia, most notably the myth of Zeus kidnapping Ganymede to become his cupbearer in the Olympian symposium. The death of Hyacinthus is also frequently referenced as a pederastic myth. The main Greek literary sources for Greek homosexuality are lyric poetry, Athenian comedy, the works of Plato and Xenophon, and courtroom speeches from Athens. Vase paintings from the 500s and 400s BCE depict courtship and sex between males. Ancient Rome In Latin, mos Graeciae or mos Graecorum (\\"Greek custom\\" or \\"the way of the Greeks\\") refers to a variety of behaviors the ancient Romans regarded as Greek, including but not confined to sexual practice. Homosexual behaviors at Rome were acceptable only within an inherently unequal relationship; male Roman citizens retained their masculinity as long as they took the active, penetrating role, and the appropriate male sexual partner was a prostitute or slave, who would nearly always be non-Roman.King, Helen, \\"Sowing the Field: Greek and Roman Sexology\\", in Sexual Knowledge, Sexual Science: The History of Attitudes to Sexuality (Cambridge University Press, 1994), p. 30. In Archaic and classical Greece, paiderasteia had been a formal social relationship between freeborn males; taken out of context and refashioned as the luxury product of a conquered people, pederasty came to express roles based on domination and exploitation.Pollini, John, \\"The Warren Cup: Homoerotic Love and Symposial Rhetoric in Silver\\", in Art Bulletin 81.1 (1999) Slaves often were given, and prostitutes sometimes assumed, Greek names regardless of their ethnic origin; the boys (pueri) to whom the poet Martial is attracted have Greek names.Joshel, Sandra R., Slavery in the Roman World (Cambridge University Press, 2010), pp. 78 and 95Younger, John G. Sex in the Ancient World from A to Z (Routledge, 2005), p. 38. The use of slaves defined Roman pederasty; sexual practices were \\"somehow 'Greek when they were directed at \\"freeborn boys openly courted in accordance with the Hellenic tradition of pederasty\\". Effeminacy or a lack of discipline in managing one's sexual attraction to another male threatened a man's \\"Roman-ness\\" and thus might be disparaged as \\"Eastern\\" or \\"Greek\\". Fears that Greek models might \\"corrupt\\" traditional Roman social codes (the mos maiorum) seem to have prompted a vaguely documented law (Lex Scantinia) that attempted to regulate aspects of homosexual relationships between freeborn males and to protect Roman youth from older men emulating Greek customs of pederasty. Bremmer, Jan, \\"An Enigmatic Indo-European Rite: Paederasty\\", in Arethusa 13.2 (1980), p. 288. By the close of the 2nd century BCE, however, the elevation of Greek literature and art as models of expression caused homoeroticism to be regarded as urbane and sophisticated.MacMullen, Ramsay, \\"Roman Attitudes to Greek Love\\", in Historia 31.4 (1982), pp. 484‚Äì502. The consul Quintus Lutatius Catulus was among a circle of poets who made short, light Hellenistic poems fashionable in the late Republic. One of his few surviving fragments is a poem of desire addressed to a male with a Greek name, signaling the new aesthetic in Roman culture.Cantarella, Eva, Bisexuality in the Ancient World (Yale University Press, 1992, 2002, originally published 1988 in Italian), p. 120Courtney, Edward, The Fragmentary Latin Poets (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1992), p. 75. The Hellenization of elite culture influenced sexual attitudes among \\"avant- garde, philhellenic Romans\\", as distinguished from sexual orientation or behavior,Halperin, David M., \\"The First Homosexuality?\\" in The Sleep of Reason: Erotic Experience and Sexual Ethics in Ancient Greece (University of Chicago Press, 2002), pp. 242 and 263. and came to fruition in the \\"new poetry\\" of the 50s BCE. The poems of Gaius Valerius Catullus, written in forms adapted from Greek meters, include several expressing desire for a freeborn youth explicitly named \\"Youth\\" (Iuventius). His Latin name and free-born status subvert pederastic tradition at Rome. Catullus's poems are more often addressed to a woman. The literary ideal celebrated by Catullus stands in contrast to the practice of elite Romans who kept a puer delicatus (\\"exquisite boy\\") as a form of high-status sexual consumption, a practice that continued well into the Imperial era. The puer delicatus was a slave chosen from the pages who served in a high-ranking household. He was selected for his good looks and grace to serve at his master's side, where he is often depicted in art. Among his duties, at a convivium he would enact the Greek mythological role of Ganymede, the Trojan youth abducted by Zeus to serve as a divine cupbearer. Attacks on emperors such as Nero and Elagabalus, whose young male partners accompanied them in public for official ceremonies, criticized the perceived \\"Greekness\\" of male-male sexuality.Vout C., Power and Eroticism in Imperial Rome, Cambridge University Press (2007) \\"Greek love\\", or the cultural model of Greek pederasty in ancient Rome, is a \\"topos or literary game\\" that \\"never stops being Greek in the Roman imagination\\", an erotic pose to be distinguished from the varieties of real-world sexuality among individuals. Vout sees the views of Williams and MacMullen as opposite extremes on the subject Renaissance Marsilio Ficino, as portrayed by Leonardo da Vinci (although scholars argue that it is depicting musician Franchino Gaffurio) articulated an idealized form of male love within the classical tradition Male same-sex relationships of the kind portrayed by the \\"Greek love\\" ideal were increasingly disallowed within the Judaeo-Christian traditions of western society.Crompton, Louis. Homosexuality and Civilization. Harvard University Press, 2006. In the postclassical period, love poetry addressed by males to other males has been in general taboo.Crompton, Louis. Byron and Greek Love: Homophobia in 19th-century England. Faber & Faber, London 1985. According to Reeser's book \\"Setting Plato Straight\\", it was the Renaissance that shifted the idea of love in Plato's sense to what we now refer to as \\"Platonic love\\"‚Äîas asexual and heterosexual. In 1469,Armando Maggi, \\"On Kissing and Sighing: Renaissance Homoerotic Love from Ficino's De Amore and Sopra Lo Amore to Cesare Trevisani's L'impresa (1569)\\", in Same-Sex Desire and Love in Greco- Roman Antiquity and in the Classical Tradition (Haworth Press, 2005), p. 315, gives a date of 1484. the Italian Neoplatonist Marsilio Ficino reintroduced Plato's Symposium to western culture with his Latin translation titled De Amore (\\"On Love\\").Berry, Phillippa. Of Chastity and Power: Elizabethan Literature and the Unmarried Queen (Routledge, 1989, 1994) Aldrich, Robert. The Seduction of the Mediterranean: Writing, Art, and Homosexual Fantasy (Routledge, 1993)Verstraete, Beert C. and Provencal, Vernon. Introduction to Same-Sex Desire and Love in Greco-Roman Antiquity and in the Classical Tradition (Haworth Press, 2005), p. 9. Ficino is \\"perhaps the most important Platonic commentator and teacher in the Renaissance\\". The Symposium became the most important text for conceptions of love in general during the Renaissance. In his commentary on Plato, Ficino interprets amor platonicus (\\"Platonic love\\") and amor socraticus (\\"Socratic love\\") allegorically as idealized male love, in keeping with the Church doctrine of his time. Ficino's interpretation of the Symposium influenced a philosophical view that the pursuit of knowledge, particularly self-knowledge, required the sublimation of sexual desire. Ficino thus began the long historical process of suppressing the homoeroticism of See Plato's works; Aldrich, The Seduction of the Mediterranean, p. 80; Maggi, \\"On Kissing and Sighing\\", pp. 315‚Äì340, for a broader discussion of homoeroticism in Ficino and related works. in particular, the dialogue Charmides \\"threatens to expose the carnal nature of Greek love\\" which Ficino sought to minimize. For Ficino, \\"Platonic love\\" was a bond between two men that fosters a shared emotional and intellectual life, as distinguished from the \\"Greek love\\" practiced historically as the erastes/eromenos relationship.Nikolai Endres, \\"Plato, Platotude, and Blatancy in E.M. Forster's Maurice\\", in Alma parens originalis?: The Receptions of Classical Literature and Thought in Africa, Europe, the United States, and Cuba (Peter Lang, 2007), p. 178, note 2. Ficino thus points toward the modern usage of \\"Platonic love\\" to mean love without sexuality. In his commentary to the Symposium, Ficino carefully separates the act of sodomy, which he condemned, and praises Socratic love as the highest form of friendship. Ficino maintained that men could use each other's beauty and friendship to discover the greatest good, that is, God, and thus Christianized idealized male love as expressed by Socrates. During the Renaissance, artists such as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo used Plato's philosophy as inspiration for some of their greatest works. The \\"rediscovery\\" of classical antiquity was perceived as a liberating experience, and Greek love as an ideal after a Platonic model. Michelangelo presented himself to the public as a Platonic lover of men, combining Catholic orthodoxy and pagan enthusiasm in his portrayal of the male form, most notably the David, but his great-nephew edited his poems to diminish references to his love for Tommaso Cavalieri. By contrast, the French Renaissance essayist Montaigne, whose view of love and friendship was humanist and rationalist, rejected \\"Greek love\\" as a model in his essay \\"De l'amiti√©\\" (\\"On Friendship\\"); it did not accord with the social needs of his own time, he wrote, because it involved \\"a necessary disparity in age and such a difference in the lovers' functions\\".Et cet'autre licence Grecque est justement abhorr√©e par nos muers: Montaigne, \\"De l'amiti√©\\" (1580), 187a and c, as cited and discussed by Zahi Anbra Zalloua, Montaigne and the Ethics of Skepticism (Rockwood Press, 2005), pp. 86‚Äì87. Because Montaigne saw friendship as a relationship between equals in the context of political liberty, this inequality diminished the value of Greek love.Michael Platt, \\"Montaigne, Of Friendship, and On Tyranny\\", in Freedom over Servitude: Montaigne, La Bo√©tie, and \\"On Voluntary Servitude\\" (Greenwood, 1998), p. 58; special emphasis on the context of political liberty in Marc D. Schachter, That Friendship Which Possesses the Soul': Montaigne Loves La Bo√©tie\\", in Homosexuality in French History and Culture (Haworth Press, 2001), p. 14. The physical beauty and sexual attraction inherent in the Greek model for Montaigne were not necessary conditions of friendship, and he dismisses homosexual relations, which he refers to as licence grecque, as socially repulsive.Zalloua, Montaigne and the Ethics of Skepticism, p. 87. Platt, \\"Montaigne\\", p. 58, thinks that Montaigne's emphasis on equality is more important than the rejection of \\"bodily love between males\\" in the passage. Montaigne also regards women as incapable of true friendship. Although the wholesale importation of a Greek model would be socially improper, licence grecque seems to refer only to licentious homosexual conduct, in contrast to the moderate behavior between men in the perfect friendship. When Montaigne chooses to introduce his essay on friendship with recourse to the Greek model, \\"homosexuality's role as trope is more important than its status as actual male-male desire or act ... licence grecque becomes an aesthetic device to frame the center.\\"Todd W. Reeser, Moderating Masculinity in Early Modern Culture (University of North Carolina Press, 2006), pp. 187‚Äì214, quotation on p. 213. Neoclassicism Winckelmann saw the Apollo Belvedere as embodying a Greek ideal =German Hellenism= The German term griechische Liebe (\\"Greek love\\") appears in German literature between 1750 and 1850, along with socratische Liebe (\\"Socratic love\\") and platonische Liebe (\\"Platonic love\\") in reference to male-male attractions. The work of the German art historian Johann Winckelmann was a major influence on the formation of classical ideals in the 18th century, and is also a frequent starting point for histories of gay German literature.Robert Tobin, \\"German Literature\\", in Gay Histories and Cultures: An Encyclopedia (Taylor & Francis, 2000) Winckelmann observed the inherent homoeroticism of Greek art, though he felt he had to leave much of this perception implicit: \\"I should have been able to say more if I had written for the Greeks, and not in a modern tongue, which imposed on me certain restrictions.\\"Crompton, Byron and Greek Love, pp. 87‚Äì88, citing Winckelmann: Writings on Art ed. David Irwin (London: Phaidon, 1972), pp. 105‚Äì106. His own homosexuality influenced his response to Greek art and often tended toward the rhapsodic: \\"from admiration I pass to ecstasy ...,\\" he wrote of the Apollo Belvedere,Entry on \\"Apollo Belvedere\\", in The Classical Tradition (Harvard University Press, 2010), pp. 55‚Äì56. \\"I am transported to Delos and the sacred groves of Lycia‚Äîplaces Apollo honoured with his presence‚Äîand the statue seems to come alive like the beautiful creation of Pygmalion.\\"Winckelmann, as quoted by William Armstrong Percy III, \\"Reconsiderations about Greek Homosexualities\\", in Same-Sex Desire and Love in Greco-Roman Antiquity and in the Classical Tradition, (Haworth Press, 2005), p. 49, with reference to Aldrich, The Seduction of the Mediterranean, p. 51. Although now regarded as \\"ahistorical and utopian\\", his approach to art history provided a \\"body\\" and \\"set of tropes\\" for Greek love, \\"a semantics surrounding Greek love that ... feeds into the related eighteenth-century discourses on friendship and love\\".Kuzniar, Alice A., Outing Goethe and His Age (Stanford University Press, 1996), p. 14 et passim. See also Potts, Alex, Flesh and the Ideal: Winckelmann and the Origins of Art History (Yale University Press, 1994, 2000), and Gustafson, Susan E., Men Desiring Men: The Poetry of Same-Sex Identity and Desire in German Classicism (Wayne State University Press, 2002), p. 63, on how Winckelmann's letters provide \\"a set of tropes that signal the struggle to express the male same-sex desire\\". Winckelmann inspired German poets in the latter 18th and throughout the 19th century, including Goethe, who pointed to Winckelmann's glorification of the nude male youth in ancient Greek sculpture as central to a new aesthetics of the time, and for whom Winckelmann himself was a model of Greek love as a superior form of friendship.W. Daniel Wilson, \\"Diabolical Entrapment: Mephisto, the Angels, and the Homoerotic in Goethe's Faust II\\", in Goethe's Faust: Theatre of Modernity (Cambridge University Press, 2011), p. 177. While Winckelmann did not invent the euphemism \\"Greek love\\" for homosexuality, he has been characterized as an \\"intellectual midwife\\" for the Greek model as an aesthetic and philosophical ideal that shaped the 18th-century homosocial \\"cult of friendship\\".Gustafson, Men Desiring Men, pp. 11, 32, 44. The idealization of Greek homosocial culture in David's Death of Socrates German 18th-century works from the \\"Greek love\\" milieu of classical studies include the academic essays of Christoph Meiners and Alexander von Humboldt, the parodic poem \\"Juno and Ganymede\\" by Christoph Martin Wieland, and A Year in Arcadia: Kyllenion (1805), a novel about an explicitly male-male love affair in a Greek setting by Augustus, Duke of Saxe- Gotha-Altenburg. =French Neoclassicism= Neoclassical works of art often represented ancient society and an idealized form of \\"Greek love\\". Jacques- Louis David's Death of Socrates is meant to be a \\"Greek\\" painting, imbued with an appreciation of \\"Greek love\\", a tribute and documentation of leisured, disinterested, masculine fellowship. English Romanticism Byron in Greek nationalist costume (c. 1830) with the Acropolis of Athens in the background The concept of Greek love was important to two of the most significant poets of English Romanticism, Byron and Shelley. The Regency in England was an era characterized by hostility and a \\"frenzy of ... persecutions\\" against homosexuals, the most virulent decades of which coincided with Byron's lifetime.Crompton, Byron and Greek Love, p. 3, as evidenced by readings in \\"poets and novelists, theologians, journal writers, and historians, along with newspapers, political speeches, reports of religious societies, and popular pamphlets\\". The terms \\"homosexual\\" and \\"gay\\" were not used during this period, but \\"Greek love\\" among Byron's contemporaries became a way to conceptualize homosexuality, otherwise taboo, within the precedents of a highly esteemed classical past. The philosopher Jeremy Bentham, for instance, appealed to social models of classical antiquity, such as the homoerotic bonds of the Theban Band and pederasty, to demonstrate how these relationships did not inherently erode heterosexual marriage or the family structure. The high regard for classical antiquity in the 18th century caused some adjustment in homophobic attitudes on the Continent, but not in England. In Germany, the prestige of classical philology led eventually to more honest translations and essays that examined the homoeroticism of Greek culture, particularly pederasty, in the context of scholarly inquiry rather than moral condemnation. Religious and nationalist sentiments in England overall remained hostile. An English archbishop, however, penned what may be the most effusive account of Greek pederasty available in English at the time, duly noted by Byron on the \\"List of Historical Writers Whose Works I Have Perused\\" that he drew up at age 19.Crompton, Byron and Greek Love, pp. 97‚Äì97. In his Antiquities of Greece (1697‚Äì1699), Archbishop John Potter assumed that \\"the excellent passion\\" of the Theban Band was chaste. Potter echoes Athenaeus's praise of pederasty, and Strabo's account of Cretan pederasty. Plato was little read in Byron's time, in contrast to the later Victorian era when translations of the Symposium and Phaedrus would have been the most likely way for a young student to learn about Greek sexuality. The one English translation of the Symposium, published in two parts in 1761 and 1767, was an ambitious undertaking by the scholar Floyer Sydenham, who nevertheless was at pains to suppress its homoeroticism: Sydenham regularly translated the word eromenos as \\"mistress\\", and \\"boy\\" often becomes \\"maiden\\" or \\"woman\\". At the same time, the classical curriculum in English schools passed over works of history and philosophy in favor of Latin and Greek poetry that often dealt with erotic themes. In describing homoerotic aspects of Byron's life and work, Louis Crompton uses the umbrella term \\"Greek love\\" to cover literary and cultural models of homosexuality from classical antiquity as a whole, both Greek and Roman,Latin literature in particular was seen as continuing or deriving from a Greek heritage. as received by intellectuals, artists, and moralists of the time. To those such as Byron who were steeped in classical literature, the phrase \\"Greek love\\" evoked pederastic myths such as Ganymede and Hyacinthus, as well as historical figures such as the political martyrs Harmodius and Aristogeiton, and Hadrian's beloved Antinous; Byron refers to all these stories in his writings. He was even more familiar with the classical tradition of male love in Latin literature, and quoted or translated homoerotic passages from Catullus, Horace, Virgil, and Petronius, whose name \\"was a byword for homosexuality in the eighteenth century\\". In Byron's circle at Cambridge, \\"Horatian\\" was a code word for \\"bisexual\\". In correspondence, Byron and his friends resorted to the code of classical allusions, in one exchange referring with elaborate puns to \\"Hyacinths\\" who might be struck by coits, as the mythological Hyacinthus was accidentally felled while throwing the discus with Apollo.Via a punning allusion to Petronius's Satyricon, plenum et optabilem coitum (\\"full and to- be-wished-for coitus\\"); Crompton, Byron and Greek Love, pp. 127‚Äì129. See also Barry Weller, \\"English Literature\\", in Gay Histories and Cultures: An Encyclopedia (Taylor & Francis, 2000), p. 444, on the use of classical allusions as code among Byron and his circle. The Death of Hyacinth (c. 1801) in Apollo's arms, by a painter contemporary with Byron, Jean Broc Shelley complained that contemporary reticence about homosexuality kept modern readers without a knowledge of the original languages from understanding a vital part of ancient Greek life.Crompton's summary in Byron and Greek Love, p. 87, citing \\"A Discourse on the Manners of the Antient Greeks Relative to the Subject of Love\\", in The Platonism of Shelley, ed. James A. Notopoulos (Duke University Press, 1949), p. 407. His poetry was influenced by the \\"androgynous male beauty\\" represented in Winckelmann's art history. Shelley wrote his Discourse on the Manners of the Antient Greeks Relative to the Subject of Love on the Greek conception of love in 1818 during his first summer in Italy, concurrently with his translation of Plato's Symposium. Shelley was the first major English writer to treat Platonic homosexuality, although neither work was published during his lifetime. His translation of the Symposium did not appear in complete form until 1910. Shelley asserts that Greek love arose from the circumstances of Greek households, in which women were not educated and not treated as equals, and thus not suitable objects of ideal love. Although Shelley recognizes the homosexual nature of the love relationships between males in ancient Greece, he argues that homosexual lovers often engaged in no behaviour of a sexual nature, and that Greek love was based on the intellectual component, in which one seeks a complementary beloved. He maintains that the immorality of the homosexual acts are on par with the immorality of contemporary prostitution, and contrasts the pure version of Greek love with the later licentiousness found in Roman culture. Shelley cites Shakespeare's sonnets as an English expression of the same sentiments, and ultimately argues that they are chaste and platonic in nature. Victorian era Throughout the 19th century, upper-class men of same-sex orientation or sympathies regarded \\"Greek love\\", often used as a euphemism for the ancient pederastic relationship between a man and a youth, as a \\"legitimating ideal\\":Jonathan Ned Katz, Love Stories: Sex between Men before Homosexuality (University of Chicago Press, 2001), p. 244. \\"the prestige of Greece among educated middle-class Victorians ... was so massive that invocations of Hellenism could cast a veil of respectability over even a hitherto unmentionable vice or crime.\\"Dowling, Linda. Hellenism and Homosexuality in Victorian Oxford (Cornell University Press, 1994) Homosexuality emerged as a category of thought during the Victorian era in relation to classical studies and \\"manly\\" nationalism; the discourse of \\"Greek love\\" during this time generally excluded women's sexuality.Nancy Sorkin Rabinowitz, introduction to Among Women: From the Homosocial to the Homoerotic in the Ancient World (University of Texas Press, 2002), pp. 9‚Äì10; Joan DeJean, \\"Sex and Philology: Sappho and the Rise of German Nationalism\\", in Re-reading Sappho: Reception and Transmission (University of California Press, 1996), p. 139ff. Deborah Cohler, Citizen, Invert, Queer: Lesbianism and War in Early Twentieth-Century Britain (University of Minnesota Press, 2010), p. 8, observes that \\"homosexuality in women was located only through medical or anthropological measure, reserving the 'highly regarded' classical studies for the realm of men only.\\" Late Victorian writers such as Walter Pater, Oscar Wilde, and John Addington Symonds saw in \\"Greek love\\" a way to introduce individuality and diversity within their own civilization. Pater's short story \\"Apollo in Picardy\\" is set at a fictional monastery where a pagan stranger named Apollyon causes the death of the young novice Hyacinth; the monastery \\"maps Greek love\\" as the site of a potential \\"homoerotic community\\" within Anglo- Catholicism.Frederick S. Roden, Same-Sex Desire in Victorian Religious Culture (Palgrave Macmillan, 2002), p. 84. Others who addressed the subject of Greek love in letters, essays, and poetry include Arthur Henry Hallam.Richard Dellamora, Masculine Desire: The Sexual Politics of Victorian Aestheticism (University of North Carolina Press, 1990), pp. 23‚Äì25, with further discussion of Hallam and his relations with other literary figures et passim. The efforts among aesthetes and intellectuals to legitimate various forms of homosexual behaviors and attitudes by virtue of a Hellenic model were not without opposition. The 1877 essay \\"The Greek Spirit in Modern Literature\\" by Richard St. John TyrwhittPublished in The Contemporary Review 29 (1877), pp. 552‚Äì566. warned against the perceived immorality of this agenda. Tyrwhitt, who was a vigorous supporter of studying Greek, characterized the Hellenism of his day as \\"the total denial of any moral restraint on any human impulses\\", and outlined what he saw as the proper scope of Greek influence on the education of young men.Tyrwhitt, \\"The Greek Spirit in Modern Literature\\", pp. 558‚Äì559. Tyrwhitt and other critics attacked by name several scholars and writers who had tried to use Plato to support an early gay-rights agenda and whose careers were subsequently damaged by their association with \\"Greek love\\". =Symonds and Greek ethics= In 1873, the poet and literary critic John Addington Symonds wrote A Problem in Greek Ethics, a work of what could later be called \\"gay history\\", inspired by the poetry of Walt Whitman.Katz, Love Stories, p. 244. Katz notes that \\"Whitman's knowledge of and response to ancient Greek love is the subject for a major study\\" (p. 381, note 6). The work, \\"perhaps the most exhaustive eulogy of Greek love\\",DeJean, \\"Sex and Philology\\", p. 139. remained unpublished for a decade, and then was printed at first only in a limited edition for private distribution.Katz, Love Stories, p. 244. A Problem in Greek Ethics was later published without attribution in Havelock Ellis's Sexual Inversion (1897); see Eric O. Clarke, Virtuous Vice: Homoeroticism and the Public Sphere (Duke University Press, 2000), p. 144. Symonds's approach throughout most of the essay is primarily philological. He treats \\"Greek love\\" as central to Greek \\"aesthetic morality\\". Aware of the taboo nature of his subject matter, Symonds referred obliquely to pederasty as \\"that unmentionable custom\\" in a letter to a prospective reader of the book,Katz, Love Stories, p. 262. but defined \\"Greek love\\" in the essay itself as \\"a passionate and enthusiastic attachment subsisting between man and youth, recognised by society and protected by opinion, which, though it was not free from sensuality, did not degenerate into mere licentiousness\\".As quoted by Pulham, Art and Transitional Object, p. 59, and Anne Hermann, Queering the Moderns: Poses/Portraits/Performances (St. Martin's Press, 2000), p. 148. Symonds studied classics under Benjamin Jowett at Balliol College, Oxford, and later worked with Jowett on an English translation of Plato's Symposium. When Jowett was critical of Symonds' opinions on sexuality, Dowling notes that Jowett, in his lectures and introductions, discussed love between men and women when Plato himself had been talking about the Greek love for boys. Symonds asserted that \\"Greek love was for Plato no 'figure of speech', but a present and poignant reality. Greek love is for modern studies of Plato no 'figure of speech' and no anachronism, but a present poignant reality.\\"Aldrich, The Seduction of the Mediterranean, p. 78, citing a letter written by Symonds. Passage discussed also by Dowling, p. 130, and Bart Schultz, Henry Sidgwick: An Intellectual Biography (Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 381. Symonds struggled against the desexualization of \\"Platonic love\\", and sought to debunk the association of effeminacy with homosexuality by advocating a Spartan- inspired view of male love as contributing to military and political bonds. When Symonds was falsely accused of corrupting choirboys, Jowett supported him, despite his own equivocal views of the relation of Hellenism to contemporary legal and social issues that affected homosexuals. John Addington Symonds, in a photo he signed for Walt Whitman Symonds also translated classical poetry on homoerotic themes, and wrote poems drawing on ancient Greek imagery and language such as Eudiades, which has been called \\"the most famous of his homoerotic poems\\": \\"The metaphors are Greek, the tone Arcadian and the emotions a bit sentimental for present-day readers.\\" One of the ways in which Symonds and Whitman expressed themselves in their correspondence on the subject of homosexuality was through references to ancient Greek culture, such as the intimate friendship between Callicrates, \\"the most beautiful man among the Spartans\\", and the soldier Aristodemus.Katz, Love Stories, pp. 243‚Äì244. Symonds was influenced by Karl Otfried M√ºller's work on the Dorians, which included an \\"unembarrassed\\" examination of the place of pederasty in Spartan pedagogy, military life, and society. Symonds distinguished between \\"heroic love\\", for which the ideal friendship of Achilles and Patroclus served as a model, and \\"Greek love\\", which combined social ideals with \\"vulgar\\" reality. Symonds envisioned a \\"nationalist homosexuality\\" based on the model of Greek love, distanced from effeminacy and \\"debasing\\" behaviors and viewed as \\"in its origin and essence, military\\".Cohler, Citizen, Invert, Queer, p. 7, quoting Symonds, A Problem in Sexual Ethics. See also Douglass Shand-Tucci, The Crimson Letter: Harvard, Homosexuality, and the Shaping of American Culture (St. Martin's Press, 2003), p. 40. He tried to reconcile his presentation of Greek love with Christian and chivalrous values. His strategy for influencing social acceptance of homosexuality and legal reform in England included evoking an idealized Greek model that reflected Victorian moral values such as honor, devotion, and self-sacrifice. Cole, Sarah. Modernism, Male Friendship, and the First World War (Cambridge University Press, 2003), p. 44, on Greek homoeroticism as conceived in Symonds's time as \\"a form of love which in practice can never match the ideal as presented by the poets\\".Pulham, Art and Transitional Object, pp. 59ff., points out that despite attempts to \\"sanitize\\" Greek love, the Victorian use of classical mythology and texts necessarily admit the \\"unruly qualities\\" of sexual desire that the originals contain. =The trial of Oscar Wilde= During his relationship with Lord Alfred ‚ÄúBosie‚Äù Douglas, Wilde frequently invoked the historical precedent of Greek models of love and masculinity, calling Douglas the contemporary \\"Hyacinthus, whom Apollo loved so madly,\\" in a letter to him in July 1893. The trial of Oscar Wilde marked the end of the period when proponents of \\"Greek love\\" could hope to legitimate homosexuality by appeals to a classical model. During the cross examination, Wilde defended his statement that \\"pleasure is the only thing one should live for,\\" by acknowledging: \\"I am, on that point, entirely on the side of the ancients‚Äîthe Greeks. It is a pagan idea.\\" With the rise of sexology, however, that kind of defense failed to hold. 20th and 21st centuries The legacy of Greece in homosexual aesthetics became problematic, and the meaning of a \\"costume\\" derived from classical antiquity was questioned. The French theorist Michel Foucault (1926‚Äì1984), perhaps best known for his work The History of Sexuality, rejected essentialist conceptions of gay history, and fostered a now \\"widely accepted\\" view that \\"Greek love is not a prefiguration of modern homosexuality.\\"Eriobon, Didier.

The term most commonly refers to Christian traditions. Some traditions hold that grace and thanksgiving imparts a blessing which sanctifies the meal. In English, reciting such a prayer is sometimes referred to as \\"saying grace\\". The term comes from the Ecclesiastical Latin phrase gratiarum actio, \\"act of thanks.\\" In Christian theology, the act of saying grace is derived from the Bible, in which Jesus and Saint Paul pray before meals (cf. , ). The practice reflects the belief that humans should thank God who is the origin of everything.

Qui vivis et regnas in saecula saeculorum. Amen.\\"  Judaism  Before eating, a blessing is said based on the category of food that is being eaten. The categories are: (i) Bread, (ii) fruits that grow on a tree, (iii) fruits/vegetables that do not grow on a tree, (iv) derivates of the five grains (except for bread, which has its own blessing), (v) derivatives of grapes and (vi) everything else. The Jewish mealtime prayer, after eating a meal that includes bread, is known as Birkat Hamazon. If the meal does not include bread, a blessing after the meal is recited based on the category of food that was eaten. With the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem in 70 AD, the offering of the prescribed sacrifices ceased in Judaism. Thereafter, the Rabbis prescribed the substitution of other ritual actions to fill this void in Jewish obedience to the Torah. The ritual washing of hands and eating of salted bread is considered to be a substitute for the sacrificial offerings of the kohanim (Jewish priests). Though there are separate blessings for fruit, vegetables, non-bread grain products, and meat, fish, and dairy products, a meal is not considered to be a meal in the formal sense unless bread is eaten. The duty of saying grace after the meal is derived from : \\"And thou shalt eat and be satisfied and shalt bless the Lord thy God for the goodly land which he has given thee.\\" Verse 8 of the same chapter says: \\"The land of wheat and barley, of the vine, the fig and the pomegranate, the land of the oil olive and of [date] syrup.\\" Hence only bread made of wheat (which embraces spelt) or of barley (which for this purpose includes rye and oats) is deemed worthy of the blessing commanded in verse 10. After the meal, a series of four (originally three) benedictions are said, or a single benediction if bread was not eaten.  Islam  * Before eating: :* When meal is ready: \\"Allahumma barik lana fima razaqtana waqina athaban-nar. \\" (Translation: O Allah! Bless the food You have provided us and save us from the punishment of the hellfire.) :* While starting to eat: bismillahi wa 'ala baraka-tillah (\\"In the name of God and with God's blessing\\") or simply b-ismi-llƒÅh-ir-ra·∏•mƒÅn-ir-ra·∏•ƒ´m (\\"in the name of God, the gracious, the merciful\\").http://islam.about.com/od/prayer/qt/DuaMeals.htm * On forgetting to say grace : Since each person says their grace individually, if someone forgets to say grace at the beginning, this supplication is made- \\"Bismillahi fee awalihi wa akhirihi.\\" (In the name of Allah, in the beginning and the end.) * After eating: \\"Alhamdulillah il-lathi at'amana wasaqana waja'alana Muslimeen. (Praise be to Allah Who has fed us and given us drink, and made us Muslims.) or simply \\"Alhamdulillah.\\" (Praise be to Allah.)  Bah√° º√≠ Faith The Bah√° º√≠ Faith has these two prayers, which are meant for those who wish to thank God before they eat: \\"He is God! Thou seest us, O my God, gathered around this table, praising Thy bounty, with our gaze set upon Thy Kingdom. O Lord! Send down upon us Thy heavenly food and confer upon us Thy blessing. Thou art verily the Bestower, the Merciful, the Compassionate.\\" \\"He is God! How can we render Thee thanks, O Lord? Thy bounties are endless and our gratitude cannot equal them. How can the finite utter praise of the Infinite? Unable are we to voice our thanks for Thy favors and in utter powerlessness we turn wholly to Thy Kingdom beseeching the increase of Thy bestowals and bounties. Thou art the Giver, the Bestower, the Almighty.\\"  Hinduism  Hindus use the 24th verse of the 4th chapter of Bhagavad Gita as the traditional prayer or blessing before a meal. Once the food is blessed it becomes Prasad, or sanctified as holyButash, Adrian (1993) Bless This Food: Ancient and Contemporary Graces from Around the World p.14, Delacorte Press Brahmaarpanam Brahma Havir Brahmaagnau Brahmanaa Hutam Brahmaiva Tena Gantavyam Brahma Karma Samaadhinah '' Which translates as 'The act of offering is God (Brahma), the oblation is God, By God it is offered into the fire of God, God is That which is to be attained by him who sees God in all.'

Buddhism  In Buddhism different traditions have prayers that are said or chanted before meals. In Japanese Zen a prayer on the \\"Five Reflections\\", Gokan-no-ge, are done before and after meals. This includes putting one's hands together and say \\"Itadakimasu\\" (\\"I humbly receive\\") before eating a meal. Theravadan monks chant a reminder not to crave food. In the Nichiren School of Buddhism a prayer is done to \\"repay the Four Favors\\", debts we owe to parents, sentient beings, leaders and The Buddha, Dharma and Sanga.  Other pre-meal traditions  In Korea, it is customary to say \\"Jal meokgesseumnida\\" (Ïûò Î®πÍ≤†ÏäµÎãàÎã§) (\\"I will eat well'). The saying is not religious in nature, and usually only occurs when eating with someone else. In certain Boy Scout circles, especially in Missouri, the \\"S-F\\" grace (named after the S-F Scout Ranch in Knob Lick, Missouri) is often said, especially when people at the table are of mixed religions. The S-F grace gives thanks to a \\"great Spirit\\", but is not affiliated with any one religion. Another common Boy Scout grace is the \\"Philmont Grace\\" (named after the Philmont Scout Ranch in New Mexico) or the \\"Wilderness Grace\\". It can be found in use wherever a troop has gone to Philmont, but is most common in the Western half of the United States. It goes: \\" For food, for raiment, / For life, for opportunities, / For friendship and fellowship, / We thank thee, O Lord.\\"  See also  *Common table prayer *Direction of prayer *Fixed prayer times *Wilderness Grace *Christian child's prayer ¬ß Giving thanks  References   External links  *Mealtime Prayers from The Prayer Guide. *Grace at Meals article from The Catholic Encyclopedia. *Thanksgiving before and after Meals article from The Catholic Encyclopedia.

Description  As members of the stiff-tailed duck group, Maccoas are often found wading in the water with their tail feathers cocked upwards. As diving ducks, their bodies are specialized for being agile underwater swimmers and thus have sacrificed the characteristics that allow them to move well on land. As a result, their legs are set further back on their bodies which makes them awkward when walking out of water. Male (left) and female (right) Maccoa ducks. = Male = The breeding male Maccoa stands out with its cobalt blue bill extending from a completely black head and throat. The breast and back are chestnut coloured while the underparts are often greyish-brown, the rump is dark brown, and the tail and feet are black. In flight, the male's off-white underwing feathers and white axillaries can be seen. Non-breeding males closely resemble the females, except for a few points: a darker crown and hints of chestnut colour on the back. = Female = The female Maccoa is less colourful. It boasts a greyish-black bill with a light tip, and a light brown face with a dark crown and cheek stripe, and an off-white throat. The female also has a light brown breast, darker brown back, off-white underparts, black feet and black tail feathers. = Juvenile = As with many birds, juvenile Maccoa ducks have similar plumage to adult females. However, their tail feathers are slimmer and notched, and their crowns are a darker brown. leftleft  Taxonomy & Systematics  The Oxyura genus is commonly referred to as stiff-tailed ducks. It is widely agreed that Oxyura and Nomonyx (a genus with a single species - the masked duck - Nomonyx dominicus) are sister groups, and these results have been shown in both trait- based and genome-based phylogenies over the past 30 years. This genus has been separated into 2 groups: the Old World ducks consist of O. maccoa, O. leucocephala (white-headed duck), and O. australis (blue-billed duck), and the New World ducks are O. vittata (lake duck) and O. ferruginea (andean duck). The exact relationships between the different species of Oxyura are still undetermined. Back in 1995, a phylogenetic tree based solely on comparative traits suggested that O. maccoa and O. leucocephala were most closely related, while O. australis was put into a separate clade along with the New World species O. vittata and O. ferruginea. More recently, genetic analyses have found strong evidence that O. maccoa, O. australis, and O. leucocephala are more closely related to one another than they are to O. vittata and O. ferruginea; however, the shape of their Old World clade and their evolutionary relationships relative to one another still remain unsolved. More recent studies have focused on comparing different genes across species, but these methods still yield conflicting results. Analyses examining mitochondrial DNA samples indicate that it is most likely O. leucocephala diverged first and that O. maccoa and O. australis share the most recent common ancestor. On the other hand, analyses comparing nuclear DNA show maximum likelihood that O. australis was the first to diverge and that O. maccoa and O. leucocephala are the closest relatives. Furthermore, other types of analyses in this same study continue to go back and forth between the two possibilities, thus confirming that the true evolutionary history of these 3 species is still unknown. thumb  Habitat & Distribution  Outside of the breeding season, Maccoa ducks tend to occupy inland waters - ranging from fresh to brackish - which are filled with nutrients. This includes lakes, ponds, salty flooded water pans, dams, river mouths, and even sewage ponds. All of these places provide ample space for the Maccoa to land, take off, and of course dive underwater for its food. While breeding, these ducks enjoy similar habitats to those described above, but with one exception. A critical component of breeding grounds for Maccoas is the presence of both open freshwater and some adjacent emerging vegetation. These ducks have been found to especially prefer Typha species in their breeding habitats, and will usually build their nests in hidden bundles of these reeds. As mentioned, the Maccoa duck is found throughout the southern and eastern countries of Africa. It is considered a sedentary species, meaning it does not migrate for winters or breeding, and simply moves around to find new wetlands for food and nesting. The main populations throughout Africa are spread quite far apart with large spatial gaps between them - this is likely because there is a lack of desirable wetland habitats for the ducks due to climatic variation across the continent. The global population in 2012 was believed to be ~11 000, and approximately 75% of these resided in southern Africa at the time; South Africa alone is still home to half of the global Maccoa population. While many bird species can be negatively impacted by human disturbances and land-use change, Maccoa ducks have found a silver lining to water management techniques and human infrastructure. Many big groups of this species have been found living behind dams across Namibia - namely the Friedenau Dam, Borodino Dam, and the Walvis Bay Sewage Works. These large dams provide deep freshwater habitats for these diving ducks and may actually prove to be a benefit for the conservation of this species.  Behaviour  = Vocalizations = When putting on their mating displays, males will often give out short whistles or will produce a prrrr'ing sound for 2 or 3 seconds. When feeling threatened, both males and females will emit low grunts. Mosquito larva. A member of the Diptera order. = Diet = The Maccoa duck is an omnivore whose diet is consists primarily of aquatic invertebrates and plants. The average dive lasts about 15 to 22 seconds, and it uses this time to fill its bill with dark debris sitting at the bottom of the lake or pond - a perfect habitat for many invertebrates. It then uses its mouth to sift through the material and keep the desired seeds, vegetation, and insects. When foraging underwater for vegetation, Maccoa ducks will eat a variety of plants - but seem to prefer species from the Persicaria and Polygonum genera - and will feed on their seeds, roots, and other plant debris. These ducks will also predate on multiple stage classes of aquatic invertebrate species, including Tubifex worms, Diptera larvae, and Daphnia eggs. Other invertebrates on the Maccoa duck's menu include gastropods and ostracods. = Reproduction = This species mates and lays its eggs typically between January and May, and spends this time in small, defended freshwater habitats with emerging vegetation, as mentioned above. The male Maccoa ducks are polygynous - meaning a single male will mate with multiple females - and they aggressively defend their breeding territory. These males do not provide any help with nest building or parental care. After mating, females remain in the male's territory and either build a new nest out of sedges, reeds, and down, or sometimes occupy the pre-existing nests of coots and grebes. Clutches are typically 5 or 6 eggs, but can reach up to 12 when females put their own eggs in another female's nest. In addition to this egg dumping, female Maccoas have also been observed abandoning their young both before and during incubation periods. The incubation period typically lasts from 25-27 days, but the fledging period is not well understood. Chicks are born with dark legs, feet, and bills, a white face, and are covered in grey-brown down. Interestingly, the breeding plumage of male Maccoa ducks can be influenced by their social rank. A study of captive Maccoa ducks in 1985 found that submissive males who were aggressively hassled by more dominant males had a lower social ranking, and these same males actually failed to acquire flashy and bright breeding plumage.  Status & Threats  The global population of Maccoa ducks is currently declining, and in 2017 the species' conservation status was changed from Least Concern to Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. = Pollution = Unlike most other ducks who have a vegetarian diet, Maccoa ducks are omnivores who feed on plants as well as invertebrates. As a result, they are put in relatively high trophic positions compared to other ducks. For this reason, the species is more vulnerable to pollution because of the bioaccumulation and magnification of toxins in their diet. The most common sources of these dangerous pollutants are pesticides and herbicides carried in runoff from surrounding farms. = Climate Change = As the global climate continues to warm, it is likely that the wetlands of southern Africa which Maccoas depend on will start to dry up. Without such important breeding habitats, it can be expected that this species will soon show greater declines in their populations. = Bycatch = A less prominent but still relevant threat to the Maccoa duck is accidental capture in gill nets. This has become more common as the need to catch fish to feed the growing human population continues to rise. This issue seems to be more relevant to eastern Africa populations who reside on large lakes.

It covers an area of . Most of the area is covered by the Kowloon Group of Reservoirs. Inside the park, there are jogging trails, barbecue and picnic areas, which are easily accessible from Tai Po Road (Piper's Hill) via waterworks access roads. The park takes its name from the peak, Golden Hill or Kam Shan (), which is the highest feature in the area. Panoramic views can be enjoyed from the slopes of Golden Hill and several places along the western ridge at the park. From these vantage points, the whole length of Smugglers Ridge, Tai Mo Shan (the highest peak in Hong Kong), Needle Hill, Sha Tin New Town, Lion Rock and Beacon Hill can be seen. The northern part of Kowloon, the western anchorage of the harbour, Stonecutters Island, the housing estates of Kwai Chung, the container port, the industrial parts of Tsing Yi Island and the town of Tsuen Wan can also be viewed from here. The park is famous for its conservations of macaque monkeys. Attractions =Geology= An area of granite of the Upper Jurassic period (formed between 130 million and 160 million years ago), the rocks are well exposed in road cuttings inside the park. =Animals= Kam Shan, or Monkey Hill to most locals, is a famous macaques kingdom in Hong Kong. The macaques are the largest group of mammals in the park. The most significant species occurring here are rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) and long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis). These monkeys are probably descendants of monkeys released by pet owners in the 1920s, whereas wild macaque groups native to Hong Kong have almost disappeared due to habitat destruction and over-hunting. Apart from monkeys, this Country Park is also a shelter of squirrels and many bird species. There are about 2,100 wild monkeys in Hong Kong, about 1,800 of them in Kam Shan country park. The park also provide habitat for forest animals found in few other parts of Hong Kong. Among these are protected species like the crested goshawk (Accipiter trivirgatus). Other birds found in the park include the black-eared kite (Milvus migrans lineatus), house swift (Apus (affinis) nipalensis), greater coucal (Centropus s.sinensis), common kingfisher (Alcedo atthis), rufous- backed shrike (Lanius schach) and common tailorbird (Orthotomus sutorius). =Flowers= Since the 1950s, exotic flora species have been progressively introduced to Kam Shan Country Park. These exotic species includes Brisbane box (Lophostemon confertus) and eucalyptus species from Australia, and the charming paper-bark tree (Melaleuca quinquenervia). The Country Park is very rich in flora, with a great diversity of native and exotic species. Melastoma species, rose myrtle (Rhodomyrtus tomentosa), acronychia (Acronychia pedunculata), Hong Kong gordonia (Gordonia axillaris), fragrant litsea (Litsea cubeba), red machilus (Machilus thunbergii), pop-gun seed (Bridelia tomentosa) and ivy tree (Schefflera heptaphylla), and the ram-rod bamboo (Arundinaria hindsii) are the common varieties in the Country Park. Monkey killings According to park wardens, since 2006 about 38 animal traps have been found in the park. An animal rights volunteer group was formed in 2007 when people discovered illegal hunting activities in the park. Dead monkeys wounded with sharp objects have been found in the park since 2007. On 3 March 2009 a dead monkey was found with a loop trap around its leg with body stab wounds. According to rights group, 300 wild monkeys were slaughtered for mainland China in May 2009. A man also used a BB gun to shoot the monkeys and shot one of the volunteers. Police arrived at the scene, Food and health chief York Chow Yat-ngok said he stepped up patrols to clear traps. Kwan Chi-yee, president of the Hong Kong Chinese Herbalists Association, issued a warning against eating monkey meat, saying \\"their meat can contain unknown viruses. It's a myth that it's nutritious.\\" Under the Wild Animals Protection Ordinance, anyone hunting or willingly disturbing wild animals is liable to a fine of and one year in jail.

It is a small academic high school with a population of approximately 340 to 360 students. The school's stated purpose is to provide academically inclined students an opportunity to grow in an environment of intellectual stimulation, and is recognized as one of the top academic high schools in Canada. The school's motto is, \\"Always to Excel\\".  History  The building housing Old Scona Academic was opened in 1908 as Strathcona Collegiate Institute, which was one of the first high schools in Edmonton. University of Alberta classes were held on the upper floors from 1909 to 1911. In 1912, the name of the school was changed to Strathcona High School. Strathcona High School closed in 1958, following the opening of Strathcona Composite High School in 1955 and of Bonnie Doon High School in 1958.. Following the closure of the high school the building was used as Strathcona Junior High School (Until the mid-1960s). It later saw use for continuing education, special education, and as an annex for MacEwan University when that institution was founded in 1971. In 1976, the Board of Trustees of Edmonton Public Schools opened Old Scona Academic High School, an academic alternative high school in the original Strathcona Collegiate Institute building. Since June 1980, Old Scona Academic has been an International Baccalaureate World School.  Reputation and results  Old Scona Academic has been recognized as one of the best high schools in Canada; Maclean's Magazine named OSA as the top academic high school in Canada. In addition to its Maclean's ranking, OSA has consistently been ranked by the Fraser Institute as the best high school in Alberta. In 2011, it was featured as the top-ranked high school in the Edmonton Sun's High School Report Card.  Admission  The 120 students who enter OSA each year are chosen on the basis of set criteria from an excess of applicants. Prospective students are evaluated using a standardized admission exam, in addition to grade 9 marks and a character assessment from a Junior High counselor or principal. Only applications from students with an overall average of at least 80%, from Science, Math, Social, and Language Arts, are considered. For grade 10 applicants, an overall average of 80% is required, although summer-school courses are not included.  Programs of study  Old Scona Academic offers the International Baccalaureate (I.B.) Diploma Program in addition to fulfilling the Alberta Education Curriculum. Students begin grade ten enrolled in a pre-I.B. program. During this year, students must elect to either pursue the full I.B. program, a partial I.B. program, or the basic Alberta Education Curriculum. Most OSA students enroll in partial I.B., with approximately ten to twenty students a year opting for the full I.B. program. The Old Scona Academic Higher Level (HL) I.B. course offerings as of 2010 are English A1, European History (Route 2: Peacekeeping), Biology, and Physics. Mathematics, Chemistry, Computer Science, French B, and Group 6 arts are offered only at the Standard Level (SL). Most courses are also offered as regular Alberta 20 and 30 level classes, for those students only taking the basic Alberta Education Curriculum or partial I.B. program. Students who elect to undertake the full two-year I.B. program to receive an I.B. Diploma, must complete all six groups of courses, as per the International Baccalaureate (I.B.) Diploma Program. This includes: * Group 1: English * Group 2: Second Language (French) * Group 3: Individuals and Societies (History) * Group 4: Experimental Sciences (Chemistry, Biology, or Physics) * Group 5: Mathematics and Computer Science * and Group 6: Arts. At least three of these groups must be completed at Higher Level (HL). In addition to these classes, I.B. program students must take the Theory of Knowledge (TOK) class, complete an extended essay, and must document a number of extra-curricular and community involvement hours known as CAS (Creativity, Action, Service) hours. Unlike other Canadian provinces, Alberta does not allow completion of the I.B. Diploma program to be used in lieu of the provincial diploma. As a result, on top of their I.B. course load, full I.B. program students must fulfill the requirements of the Alberta Education Curriculum that do not get covered by the I.B. program, such as the Career and Life Management (CALM) course, physical education, and ten credit 30-level course requirements. Additionally, many post-secondary institutions (particularly those in Alberta) will not solely use the I.B. program for acceptance (though it does provide benefits). Many, for example, require completion of Chemistry, Biology, and Physics at the 30-level. As the I.B. program only requires one of these courses for Group 4, students must take the remaining two outside of the I.B. program. These combined requirements often lead to lengthy course loads and extended class hours / homework. As a result of these demands, most students at Old Scona Academic choose to pursue a partial I.B. program. While this does not grant the student any I.B. Diploma status, there are benefits to completing many 30-level classes in I.B. Higher Level (HL). Many post-secondary institutions will view completion of these higher level classes (with good marks), as equivalent to completing comparative introductory classes in the post-secondary level. Therefore, students can use partial I.B. to get credit for many introductory post- secondary classes like Biology and English, saving both time and tuition later on. Because OSA is a small school, it has a limited selection of elective classes. These include choral music, instrumental music, jazz band, performing arts, drama, debate, art, theory of knowledge (which can be taken without the full IB diploma), computer applications, computer programming, and cyber security. Physical education at the 20 and 30 levels is not required by the Alberta Education Curriculum, but is offered as an elective for students. In the past, many students have also taken second languages such as German and Japanese through external programs affiliated with Alberta Education.  Building  Designed by local architect Roland Lines, the cornerstone of the building was laid by the first premier (and education minister) of Alberta, Alexander Rutherford in 1907, the same year Strathcona became a city. The school was officially opened by Lieutenant-Governor George Bulyea on 17 February 1909. It was one of the largest and most up-to-date school buildings in the province at the time, featuring an advanced automatic climate control system. The style is described as Edwardian Classical Free, which retains some decorative features of the Victorian era but is more subdued, practical, and utilitarian, and less traditional. The building has received a number of renovations since its opening. The most recent major renovation and restoration took place in 1997. Since then, smaller restoration projects like new flooring have taken place. Modernization of the school to include computer labs, a wifi network and LCD projectors in classrooms have been careful to maintain the historic integrity of the building. Some elements, such as the external fire escapes, remain part of the building for historic integrity, but are no longer in use due to structural age. Many of the building's mechanical systems, although today out-of-date and replaced for efficiency and safety reasons, were highly advanced when the building was constructed. Many elements have been left by renovations for decorative effect, are on display in the school, or have been stored in the Provincial Archives of Alberta. In September 2008, in recognition of the academic history of the various institutions that have used the building over the years and the architectural significance of the building, the school was designated a Provincial Historic Resource. This designation limits the modifications and additions that can be performed on the building.https://hermis.alberta.ca/ARHP/Details.aspx?DeptID=1&ObjectID;=4665-1342  Extracurricular activities  Numerous student-run clubs are available at Old Scona Academic. * Anime Club * Baking Club * Bollywood Dance Club * Brain Bee Society * Champions of Change * Chinese Dance Club * Guitar Club * Little Earth Club * Muslim Students Association * TEDxOSA * Club Francophone * OSA Business and Innovation * OSA Chess Club * Gay Straight Alliance * Jack.org * Key Club * ME to WE * Short Film Club * OSA Writing Club * Yearbook/Photography Club * Anybody Can Dance * Brain Care Awareness * OSA Cancer Society * Chinese Club * Community Connections * OSA Computing Society * OSA Fellowship * Hip Hop Club * Jazz Combo Club * Smile Club * Geopolitics Club There are also many student-run chapters of international organizations such as: Room to Read, UNICEF, the Gay-Straight Alliance, and Amnesty International. Also, the school houses a Right To Play club, which has brought professional hockey players such as Travis Ewanyk to the school for fundraising. An informal Guitar Club operates after school. A club also writes and prints the school's magazine, \\"Tabula Rasa\\". A fully elected student council organizes a number of extracurricular events, such as dances, as well as school-wide volunteer and fundraising initiatives. Annually, the school plays host to an inner-city elementary school, providing carnival-style entertainment for many kids who come from lower-income households. Owing to new junk food initiatives from the Edmonton Public School Board, the school store was temporarily shut down. An elected grad council is also responsible for the organization and administration of the grade 12 graduation. The drama and music programs regularly produce performances that are given to students and the general public. School-organized trips are also common, with Europe, South America, and Vancouver Island as regular destinations. =Speech and debate team = Old Scona has a competitive debate club and is one of the biggest debate clubs in the Alberta Debate and Speech Association by population. Old Scona won bronze in Edmonton's Law Day Mock Trial competition in 2013 and silver in the 2014 competition. In 2015, they received gold and in 2016, Old Scona claimed both gold and silver. Currently there is a Speech & Debate 15 class taught by senior speakers and debaters and the current Old Scona debate coach. The Old Scona debate team has participated in tournaments such as Lois Hole Debate, Model Legislature, George Cormack, Churchill's, and Model United Nations.  Athletics  Although OSA is primarily an academic- focused institution, the school maintains athletics teams in most major sports. All school teams are known as the \\"Olympians\\". The team colours are maroon, green, and gold. Due to the nature of the building, OSA does not have an in-house gymnasium. There is, however, an outdoor basketball court, baseball diamond, and soccer field. Additionally, the school utilizes a local church gymnasium only one block away for general physical education courses and team practices. The nearby Garneau Tennis Club and Tipton Ice Rink are also frequently used by phys. ed classes and teams. Other nearby schools, such as Garneau Elementary and King Edward Elementary, serve as venues for certain team practices. Despite the lack of in-house facilities, and a small school population, Old Scona Academic maintains decent athletic standings in city competitions. During the 2006-2007 city finals, the swim team, despite their small size, achieved fourth place overall. The OSA Badminton Team, for the past few years, has repeatedly made it to the city finals. The team for the 2007-2008 season lost Harry Ainlay Titans in the city semi-finals. However, a doubles team continued on to provincials and won the gold medal there. The 2007-2008 senior men's basketball team ranked 3rd in the John Paul II Patriots Tournament and the Canmore Tournament. The 2008-2009 women's basketball team won silver in the John Paul II Tournament. The 2008-2009 senior men's basketball team finished second overall in the city conference, losing 79-69 to the Queen Elizabeth Knights in the finals. The 2009-2010 Curling Team earned a bronze medal in the EPSB Junior Curling League. The 2010-2011 Old Scona senior women's volleyball placed first in the Edmonton Public Schools City Conference. They won 3-2 against the former undefeated champions, Vimy Ridge. From 1994 until 1996, the men's soccer team was undefeated and won back-to-back championships. In 2014-2015, the men's soccer team were the undefeated champions of the Metro Edmonton High School Athletic Association. They retained their title in Tier 4 in 2016-17 under the captaincy of Vlad Muresan. The cross country team had a seminal provincial victory in the 2017-2018 season. The size of the team and the quality of the running program were staggering for a small school.

History Probably during the early 1850s, fossil collector Samuel Husbands Beckles discovered some nodules with dinosaur bones in a quarry near Battle, East Sussex. These he sent to palaeontologist Richard Owen, who reported them in 1856.Owen, R., 1856, Monograph on the fossil Reptilia of the Wealden Formation. Part IV. Palaeontographical Society Monographs 10, 26 pp Owen had a lithograph made by Joseph Dinkel of the main specimen, a series of three back vertebrae with very tall spines, whose image was also shown in an 1884 edition of an 1855 volume of his standard work on British fossil reptiles,Owen, R., 1855, Monograph on the fossil Reptilia of the Wealden and Purbeck formations. Part II. Dinosauria (Iguanodon). (Wealden). Palaeontographical Society Monographs 8. 54 pp leading to the misunderstanding the fossils had been recovered close to 1884. Owen, who referred the specimens to Megalosaurus bucklandii, thought the vertebrae were part of the shoulder region and it has been assumed that he must have already known of the find in 1853 as he directed Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins to put a hump on the back of his life- sized Megalosaurus sculpture in Crystal Palace Park, which again inspired other restorations from the 19th century.Naish, D. 2010. \\"Pneumaticity, the early years: Wealden Supergroup dinosaurs and the hypothesis of saurischian pneumaticity\\". In: Moody, R. T. J., Buffetaut, E., Naish, D. & Martill, D. M. (eds) Dinosaurs and Other Extinct Saurians: A Historical Perspective. Geological Society, London, Special Publications 343, pp. 229-236 Crystal Palace Park, London. The fossil, now catalogued as NHMUK R1828, was probably found in a layer of the Hastings Bed Group dating from the late Valanginian age. It consists of a series of three posterior dorsal vertebrae. Owen also reported the presence in the nodules of two right ribs and two additional series of two dorsal vertebral centra each. Olshevsky thought the holotype represented the eighth, ninth, and tenth dorsal vertebra; later researchers, however, have assumed them to be the tenth, eleventh and twelfth. In 1888, Richard Lydekker compared these vertebrae with material referred to Megalosaurus dunkeri, a Cretaceous species represented by a single tooth found in Germany.Lydekker, R. 1888. Catalogue of the Fossil Reptilia and Amphibia in the British Museum (Natural History), Cromwell Road, S.W., Part 1. Containing the Orders Ornithosauria, Crocodilia, Dinosauria, Squamata, Rhynchocephalia, and Proterosauria. British Museum of Natural History, London, 309 pp In 1923 Friedrich von Huene created a separate genus for Megalosaurus dunkeri. He used the three vertebrae as the basis for this genus, noting that they were different from Megalosaurus, and created the name Altispinax (meaning \\"with high spines\\") based on their appearance. Many later researchers concluded that Megalosaurus dunkeri had therefore received a new genus name as Altispinax dunkeri, a combination actually used for the first time in 1939 by Oskar Kuhn.Kuhn, O., 1939, Saurischia ‚Äî Fossilium catalogus I, Animalia, Pars 87. 's-Gravenhage, W. Junk, 1939, 124 pp Von Meyer's restoration of Megalosaurus with long neural spines Later researchers considered Altispinax a nomen dubium because the single tooth was undiagnostic. No relationship could be proven between the tooth and the vertebrae. The vertebrae were therefore given a new name in 1988 by Gregory Paul. Paul considered them to represent a possible new species of Acrocanthosaurus, which he named Acrocanthosaurus? altispinax. The specific name was deliberately made identical to the old generic name, to emphasize that both referred to the vertebrae.Paul, G.S., 1988, Predatory Dinosaurs of the World. Simon & Schuster, New York 464 pp As indicated by the question mark, Paul himself was uncertain about this assignment. For this reason, in 1991 a new genus, Becklespinax, was named for the vertebrae by George Olshevsky, in honour of the original discoverer, Beckles. The new combination name of the type species Acrocanthosaurus? altispinax thus became Becklespinax altispinax.Olshevsky, G., 1991, A revision of the parainfraclass Archosauria Cope, 1869, excluding the advanced Crocodylia.

In 2016, a re-examination of this convoluted history of classification was published by Michael Maisch. Maisch concluded that von Huene, when he named Altispinax dunkeri, deliberately based the species on the vertebrae and not on the Megalosaurus dunkeri tooth. Because both species were based on different type specimens, later researchers were wrong to consider them the same species. Rather, according to Maisch's interpretation of the rules of the ICZN, Altispinax dunkeri (based on the tall-spined vertebrae) and Megalosaurus dunkeri (based on the tooth from Germany) are two distinct species that happen to share the same species name. Because the later names created by Paul and Olshevsky were based on the same vertebrae used to von Huene to name Altispinax dunkeri, all of those later names must be considered junior objective synonyms (different names for exactly the same fossil), and Altispinax dunkeri, having been named first, has priority as the correct name for this species.Maisch, M.W.

Neues Jahrbuch f√ºr Geologie und Pal√§ontologie - Abhandlungen, 280(2): 215-219. =Other species= Foot claw (specimen BMNH 2482) provisionally referred to Altispinax by von Huene in 1926. Natural History Museum, London. Four other species would be named within the genus Altispinax. In 1923 von Huene renamed Megalosaurus oweni Lydekker 1889, based on the metatarsus BMNH R2559, into Altispinax oweni.Huene, F. von (1923). \\"Carnivorous Saurischia in Europe since the Triassic\\". Bulletin of the Geological Society of America, 34: 449-458. In 1991 Olshevsky created a separate genus Valdoraptor for this species. In 1932 von Huene renamed Megalosaurus parkeri Huene 1923 into Altispinax parkeri.Huene, F. von (1932). Die fossile Reptil-Ordnung Saurischia, ihre Entwicklung und Geschichte. Monographien zur Geologie und Palaeontologie, Series 1, vol. 4(1-2), 361 pages This species in 1964 was given the separate generic name Metriacanthosaurus. Description Altispinax reconstructed after Concavenator, based on Darren Naish's blog post. Paul in 1988 tentatively estimated that Altispinax weighed one tonne and was shorter than Acrocanthosaurus atokensis, itself by him estimated at the time as eight metres (26 ft) long. The three A. dunkeri back vertebrae from Sussex have about thirty-five centimetres high neural spines or processus spinosi, about as relatively tall as those of Ichthyovenator.Allain, R., Xaisanavong, T., Richir, P. & Khentavong, B. 2012. \\"The first definitive Asian spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Early Cretaceous of Laos\\". Naturwissenschaften 99(5): 369-377 These show irregular rugosities on the upper third part. According to Ralph Molnar the two spines closest to the skull are ankylosed or fused. The single closest spine is only about two- thirds the height of the others and looks as it has broken off, while the spine behind partly overgrows the gap. This Molnar explained as a result of injury to a back frill, the wound later closing from behind.Molnar, R. E., 2001, Theropod paleopathology: a literature survey: In: Mesozoic Vertebrate Life, edited by Tanke, D. H., and Carpenter, K., Indiana University Press, p. 337-363. In 2003, Darren Naish gave a different interpretation, suggesting the gap was natural. He denied that the front two vertebrae were ankylosed but observed that the spines of eleventh and twelfth vertebrae were joined at the top. The spines are also transversely expanded above, with a width of about fifty-five millimetres. Naish also pointed out that Owen had noted the large depressions on the neural arch sides and had explained them as a result of pneumatisation, the first time this phenomenon would explicitly have been observed with a dinosaur.Naish, D., 2003, \\"A definitive allosauroid (Dinosauria; Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of East Sussex\\", Proceedings of the Geologists‚Äô Association 114: 319-326 In 2006 however, it was reported that in 1837 Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer already had commented on this phenomenon with the Saurischia in general.O‚ÄôConnor, P.M. 2006. \\"Postcranial pneumaticity: an evaluation of soft-tissue influences on the postcranial skeleton and the reconstruction of pulmonary anatomy in archosaurs\\". Journal of Morphology, 267: 1199‚Äì1226 The discovery of a back crest incorporating only two high vertebrae in Concavenator, in 2010 provided corroboration that the short anterior Altispinax spine may be complete. Olshevsky originally assigned Altispinax to the Eustreptospondylidae. In 2003 Naish considered it a member of the Allosauroidea. Most researchers give a less precise placement as Tetanurae incertae sedis.M. T. Carrano, R. B. J. Benson, and S. D.

Awaleh, an Issa,\\"Chronology for Afars in Djibouti\\", Minorities at Risk Project (UNHCR Refworld), 2004. was born in Ali-Sabieh. After secondary studies in Djibouti, Aden Robleh Awaleh studied law in Bordeaux and then in Paris between 1963 and 1968. He was secretary general of the association of Djiboutian students and interns in France from 1965 to 1967. At the end of his university studies, Aden Robleh Awaleh returned to Djibouti at the beginning of 1969, he went to Somalia in 1969 and became the leader of the Front for the Liberation of the Somali Coast (FLCS). As a result of his activities, he was convicted of \\"endangering state security\\" in absentia by the French authorities in 1970 and sentenced to 27 years in prison. He was later arrested in Somalia in 1975 for \\"anti- revolutionary\\" activities and spent a year in solitary confinement there. He was attacked and injured on June 24, 1977, three days before Djibouti became independent from France; his injuries caused him to be hospitalized for a year. In the period following independence, he was a member of the government, Vice-President of the Popular Rally for Progress (RPR) ruling party, and a member of the RPR Political Bureau. He was included in the first post- independence government, named on July 15, 1977, as Minister of the Port,\\"D√©cret n¬∞77-010/PR portant nomination des ministres de la R√©publique de Djibouti.\\" , Journal Officiel de la R√©publique de Djibouti, July 15, 1977 . and he was subsequently moved to the position of Minister of Commerce, Transport, and Tourism in 1978.\\"Nov 1978 - Cabinet Reorganization under New Prime Minister\\", Keesing's Record of World Events, Volume XXIV, November, 1978 Djibouti, Page 29308. He was also elected to the National Assembly in 1982.. In 1983, he denounced the authoritarianism of the RPR's single-party regime and resigned from his government and party positions. A book written by Awaleh, Djibouti: Key to the Red Sea (Djibouti Clef de la Mer Rouge), was published in February 1986. He clandestinely left Djibouti in May 1986 and went into exile in France. As an exiled opposition leader, he founded the Djiboutian National Movement for the Establishment of Democracy and the Union of Democratic Movements while in France. In Djibouti, he was accused of \\"attempting to destabilize the government and murder senior officials\\" and was sentenced in absentia to life in prison on September 7, 1986, along with two others.\\"Jun 1987 - Internal and foreign policy developments\\", Keesing's Record of World Events, Volume 33, June, 1987 Djibouti, Page 35180.

On October 27, 1995, a PND protest was broken up by the police and Awaleh was among those arrested., AFP (PND website, 2003 archive), 27 October 1995 . Accused of organizing an illegal protest, he received a suspended sentence of one month imprisonment in November 1995. At this time, he was the head of an opposition coalition, the Union of Democratic Movements.\\"Nov 1995 - Untitled\\", Keesing's Record of World Events, Volume 41, November, 1995 Djibouti, Page 40813. He stood as the first candidate on the PND's candidate list for Ali Sabieh Region (the only district in which the party presented candidates) in the December 1997 parliamentary election,\\"D√©cret n¬∞97-0175/PRE abrogeant et rempla√ßant le d√©cret n¬∞97-0170/PRE portant publication des listes de candidats et ouverture de la campagne √©lectorale pour les √©lections l√©gislatives du 19 d√©cembre 1997.\\" , Journal Officiel de la R√©publique de Djibouti, December 16, 1997 . but the party did not win any seats. The PND experienced internal division in the late 1990s. In May 1997, Awaleh suspended PND spokesman Farah Ali Wabert from the party, a move that reportedly exacerbated the situation. By November 1998, a rival leadership under Mahdi Ahmed Abdillahi√© controlled the PND headquarters, and in December 1998 Awaleh was reported to be missing. The factions apparently reconciled by 2002.\\"Deux nouveaux partis politiques √† l‚Äôapproche des l√©gislatives 2003\\" , Afrique Express, N¬∞259, November 29, 2002 .

Awaleh and the PND supported opposition candidate Moussa Ahmed Idriss in the April 1999 presidential election; Guelleh officially won the election with 75% of the vote, but Awaleh alleged that this was due to \\"massive fraud\\" and said that Idris had actually won.Marc Perelman, \\"Aden Robleh Awaleh\\" (interview), Jeuneafrique.com, May 31, 1999 .

Taxonomy  First described in 1842 by the ornithologist John Gould, its specific name is derived from diminutive of the Latin adjective pulcher \\"pretty\\". It is one of three species in the Afro-Asian genus Nettapus, an ancient and unusual group of ducks. No subspecies are recognised.  Description  Adult in Perth Zoo Ranging from in length, it is one of the smallest species of duck. It has a wingspan. It has a small bill and compact form. The breeding male has a predominantly dark green back, neck and crown, white cheeks and dark green, pale grey and white scalloped underparts. The tail and primary flight feathers and primary coverts are black, while the secondary flight feathers are white. The secondary coverts are a dark iridescent green. This iridescence is lost outside of the breeding season and the plumage is duller. It exhibits sexual dimorphism, the female has a barred rather than green neck and otherwise resembles the non-breeding male. Immature birds are duller, and have mottled dark brown heads. The male has a high- pitched whistle and the female a lower-pitched call.  Distribution  The green pygmy goose is found in southern New Guinea and across northern Australia (from Western Australia, through Northern Territory and into Queensland). To the west, it commonly reaches Timor-Leste, where it possibly breeds at Lake Iralalara. It is largely resident, apart from dispersion in the wet season. The habitat is well vegetated lowland lagoons and other permanent fresh waters.  Breeding  The green pygmy goose nests in tree hollows.

History =Formation and beginning = Tea Leaf Green began in the fall of 1996, when Scott Rager met Ben Chambers on the campus of San Francisco State University. Chambers was the group's original bass player but left in 2007; he is featured on the band's first four albums. Rager and Chambers began playing together, practicing in Chambers's bedroom in a back house off Church Street in the Castro District. In early 1997, Clark, a childhood friend of Rager, moved from Los Angeles to San Francisco and became the third member of the band. Garrod, also a SFSU student, joined soon after. In the late-1990s, Tea Leaf Green began performing throughout San Francisco, becoming the de facto house band at the Elbo Room for a period in 1999. The band's first album, eponymously titled, was produced by Jimmy Foot and engineered by Jimmy and Susie Foot. It was released on Bongo Boy Records and featured twelve original compositions, including songs such as \\"Professor's Blues\\", \\"Asphalt Funk\\", and \\"California\\", all of which remained part of the band's live repertoire for years. In the early part of the 2000s, Tea Leaf Green was an integral member of a burgeoning rock music revitalization in San Francisco that also featured bands such as Animal Liberation Orchestra and New Monsoon. In 2001, Tea Leaf Green released their second album, Midnight on the Reservoir, following up with a live release from the Great American Music Hall, unofficially referred to as the \\"Green Album\\" because of its all-green cover. Midnight on the Reservoir highlighted the group‚Äôs rapid evolution from its previous release, offering a heightened element of psychedelia, bombastic rock numbers, and a cohesive, thematic lyrical approach. Garrod unearthed childhood memories for the mysterious opening track \\"Midnight on the Reservoir\\" and the ebullient sing-along \\"Papa's in the Backroom\\", while the band ripped through instrumental jams such as \\"Panspermic De-evolution\\" and \\"Hot Dog\\". Clark referred to this effort as the band's \\"party album\\". = Festivals and studio albums = Josh Clark of Tea Leaf Green performing at the Maryland State Fair 9/2/2007 In 2002, the band embarked on its first national tour, using the High Sierra Music Festival as a springboard to a more substantial audience, and was featured in the December, 2002 issue of Relix magazine. Soon, Tea Leaf Green utilized the festival circuit as a platform of introduction, playing to larger and larger audiences as it built a reputation for galvanizing live performances. Appropriately, the band's third studio album, Living in Between, was bookended by two live releases recorded in San Francisco, Slim's (2003) and Live at the Independent (2004). Living in Between again featured Clark's cover art. While continuing to tour extensively through the United States, Tea Leaf Green headed to Navarro Ridge Range in Mendocino, California, forsaking the confines of the city, to record Taught to Be Proud (2005), the band's fourth album. With a focus on songs, as opposed to jams, the four members simplified the recording process, utilizing live takes on many of the tracks. The title track earned Tea Leaf Green a Jammy Award for Song of the Year in 2006. In 2007, Tea Leaf Green began the year playing Jam Cruise 5 and toured the country, playing more than 130 shows, including numerous summer festivals such as Wakarusa, Bonnaroo, and High Sierra. Late in the year, original bassist Chambers decided to leave the band, citing exhaustion and a desire to be with family, and retired from active participation in the music profession. At approximately the same time, the band signed its first significant recording contract, with Surfdog Records. The company subsequently released a three CD boxset, entitled Seeds, that conflated the band's first three releases into a single volume. The timing was appropriate and seemed to seal Chambers' departure with a stamp of finality. The retrospective was the precursor to the band's first new album with Surfdog. = Documentary film = In 2006, filmmaker Justin Kreutzmann, son of Grateful Dead drummer Bill Kreutzmann, directed a documentary of the band, entitled \\"Rock 'n' Roll Band\\", that interlaced live footage from a May, 2006 concert at the Fox Theatre in Boulder, Colorado, with individual and group interviews with each member of the band. The film emphasized the struggle facing a young band, capturing footage of the members at home and in the streets of San Francisco as they discuss hardship and sacrifice inherent in the pursuit of a dream. Kreutzmann utilized the Fox Theatre performance to showcase the band's distinctive musical spirit: organic but ambitious, confident but never cocky, boisterous but thoughtful, soulful and exploratory. The DVD was released in tandem with a live CD also entitled \\"Rock 'n' Roll Band.\\" = Lineup changes = In late 2007, less than two months after Chambers's exit, Tea Leaf Green introduced Reed Mathis, of Jacob Fred Jazz Odyssey (JFJO), as its new bass player. Mathis had previously performed with the Jacob Fred Jazz Odyssey, which he helped form in 1994. Mathis played his first show with Tea Leaf Green on December 7, 2007, in Santa Cruz, California. In January 2008, Tea Leaf Green entered a Richmond, Virginia recording studio with producer David Lowery, taking one week to cut a fifth album, Raise Up the Tent which was released in summer, 2008. The album opens with a Chambers- inspired funk bass on \\"Let Us Go\\", features two Clark compositions (\\"Borrowed Time\\" and \\"Stick to the Shallows\\"). Tea Leaf Green performing at the Highline Ballroom, 2008 In 2008, the band played its first show overseas as part of the Jam in the 'Dam Music Fest in Amsterdam. Garrod, Clark, and Rager also pursued side projects around San Francisco. Because of prior obligations to Jacob Fred Jazz Odyssey, Mathis missed a handful of gigs with in 2008. Steve Adams of Animal Liberation Orchestra substituted on bass for those shows in which Mathis was otherwise obliged. Near the end of the year, Mathis announced publicly that he was departing Jacob Fred Jazz Odyssey to commit more time to Tea Leaf Green. The group reprised its role on Jam Cruise in 2009, playing on the seventh edition of the event. In the winter of 2011, Cochrane McMillan was added as a permanent member of the group. In an interview with The Waster, Trevor Garrod announced the fifth addition to the band, percussionist Cochrane McMillan, and a spring 2011 release of the studio album, Radio Tragedy. They released another studio album, In The Wake, in 2013. On August 16, 2016, it was announced that bassist Reed Mathis would be leaving Tea Leaf Green to focus on his other projects. He was replaced by Eric DiBerardino.

It was recorded with hip hop producer Easy Mo Bee and released posthumously on June 30, 1992, by Warner Bros. Records. The album was received unfavorably by most critics, although it won a Grammy Award for Best R&B; Instrumental Performance the following year.  Background  The project stemmed from Davis sitting in his New York City apartment in the summer with the windows open, listening to the sound of the streets. He wanted to record an album of music that captured these sounds. In early 1991, Davis called up his friend Russell Simmons and asked him to find some young producers who could help create this kind of music, leading to Davis' collaboration with Easy Mo Bee. At the time of Davis' death in 1991, only six pieces for the album had been completed.Miles Davis Community at Sony Music Entertainment. Easy Mo Bee was asked by Warner Bros. to take some of the unreleased trumpet performances (stemming from what Davis called the RubberBand Session), and build tracks that Miles \\"would have loved\\" around the recordings. The album's posthumous tracks (as stated in the liner notes) are \\"High Speed Chase\\" and \\"Fantasy\\". A reprise of the song \\"Mystery\\" rounded out the album's nine-track length.  Release and reception  Doo-Bop was released by Warner Bros. Records on June 30, 1992. By May 1993, it had sold approximately 300,000 copies worldwide. The album received negative reviews from most critics. Greg Tate called it an \\"inconsequential\\" jazz-rap record from Davis, while Billboard found the R&B-based; album to not be \\"quite cut as deeply\\" as his 1970s funk recordings. In Entertainment Weekly, Greg Sandow wrote that Davis' solos were performed with \\"impeccable logic and wistful finesse\\" but accompanied by hackneyed guest raps and unadventurous hip hop beats, which reduced Doo-Bop to \\"elegant aural wallpaper\\". Los Angeles Times critic Don Snowden believed the album \\"succeeded only in fits and starts\\" because of Davis' first time working with hip hop tracks, \\"the rigidity\\" of which Snowden felt often reduced his \\"muted-laced- with-echo trumpet to just another instrumental color in the mix\\". Richard Williams from The Independent viewed the tracks as a regression from the ambient-inflected Tutu (1986) album as they inspired trumpet improvisations from Davis which displayed \\"a rhythmic banality that was never remotely discernible in Miles's pre-electric playing\\". In a positive review, Q called Doo-Bop \\"a collector's piece ... as hip, sexy, open and complex as the best of his work since he elected to turn to FM airplay music in the 1980s\\". Musician considered it a pleasant hip hop album and an accessible introduction to Davis' music for \\"younger ears weaned on modern beats\\". In Down Beat, Robin Tolleson wrote that Davis sounded less timid than on previous few records as \\"his phrasing and concept adapt sharply from tune to tune\\". Doo-Bop won the 1993 Grammy Award for Best R&B; Instrumental Performance.

It is the smallest of Africa's wildfowl, and one of the smallest in the world. Though pygmy geese have beaks like those of geese, they are more related to the dabbling ducks and other species called 'ducks'. It is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies. Taxonomy The African pygmy goose was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux in 1785. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by Fran√ßois-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enlumin√©es D'Histoire Naturelle which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Anas aurita in his catalogue of the Planches Enlumin√©es. The type locality is Madagascar. The current genus Nettapus was erected by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich von Brandt 1836. The word Nettapus is from the Ancient Greek nƒìtta \\"duck\\" and pous \\"foot\\". It was thought that the African pygmy goose possessed the feet and body of a duck and the neck of a goose. The specific auritus is the Latin word for \\"eared\\" or \\"long-eared\\". The species is monotypic. Description The African pygmy goose is one of the smallest of the perching ducks, and it has the average weight of about for males and for females and wingspans between and . They have a short bill which extends up the forehead so they superficially resemble geese. The males have a white face with black eye patches. The iridescent black crown extends down the back of the neck. This structure fringes powder green ear patches. The upper half of the fore neck is white and forms an open collar around the neck whereas the base if the neck and breast are light chestnut colored. The flanks are more intensely chestnut colored and the back is metallic green. The sixteen tail feathers are black. The wing feathers are black with metallic green iridescence on the coverts, with the exemption of a white bar on the distal secondaries. The belly is white. The bill is yellow with a black tip and the feet are dark-gray to black. The iris of there is reddish brown. The females have a gray face with a dark brown eye stripe and smudged brown patches on the cheeks and nape. They have dark-brown a forehead, crown and back of the neck with a slight iridescence. The breast and flanks have a dark chestnut coloration. Their back is dark brown. The wing feathers are dark brown-black with the exemption of a white bar on the distal secondaries. The belly is white. The lower part of the bill is yellow, the upper part mottled brown with a dark brown tip and the feet are dark-gray to black. Ducklings have a white face with a pattern similar to that of the adult female in black and a dark gray eye patch. Their black crown extends in a V-shape from the base of the bill to the back of the neck. The rump and flanks are white, the back and tail black. Neck, breast and belly are light-gray to white the wings are black. The lower part of the bill is pink, the upper part is gray with alight brown tip and the feet are dark-gray to black. Distribution The African pygmy goose is known to be nomadic. It can be found across a wide area of sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar. It lives in habitats of slow flowing or stagnant water with a cover of water lilies (mostly inland wetlands, but also open swamps, farm dens, river pools, and estuaries). Behavior The African pygmy goose feeds mainly on the seeds of water lilies (Nymphaea spp.) but also on other floating seeds and small insects as well as other small invertebrates. They live in strong pair bonds that may last over several seasons and their breeding is triggered by rains. In captivity successful breeding is rare,.

The town had a population of less than 13,000 at the 2001 census. Geography Abalak lies near the northern extremity of the Sahel, bordering the Sahara desert. It also lies along the southern edge of the dry plains and fossilized river valleys which make up the Azawagh. The town itself lies in a seasonal wash ‚Äî a Kori (Hausa) or Wadi (Arabic) ‚Äî which retains underground water even during the long dry season. Transport and economy Abalak lies along a highway, connected to the main Niamey-Tahoua- Agadez-Arlit paved highway just to the northeast of the town. To the south, the local road connects the town of Keita, Niger to the main road network. Abalak is a regional market town, especially for animals raised by pastoral and seasonally nomadic communities in the area. The town is a center for the \\"Bororo\\" Wodaabe-Fula people, and also hosts nomadic Tuareg.

Biography Dibdale was born the son of John Dibdale of Shottery, a village in the county of Warwickshire, within the parish of Stratford-upon-Avon, the birthplace of William Shakespeare's wife Anne Hathaway, at a date unknown. He had a brother, Richard, and two sisters, Joan and Agnes. It would seem the family were Catholics. Peter Ackroyd speculates that Dibdale (or Debdale) attended the King's New School in Stratford, the same grammar school attended by William Shakespeare.Ackroyd, Peter. Shakespeare: The Biography Doubleday (2005), p.64 Government records show that in 1581 his absence abroad at Louvain since about 1576 had been noted by the English authorities. Catholic records, however, show that, by that time, he had already been to Rome and had then gone to the English College in Rheims, France, arriving there on 29 December 1579, before setting out for England on 22 June 1580. At that point he had still not been ordained. Dibdale was immediately arrested upon landing at Dover. It is recorded that he was committed to the Gatehouse by 29 July the same year. While in prison his father sent him bread, cheese, and five shillings.Wainewright, John Bannerman. \\"Venerable Robert Dibdale\\", Lives of the English Martyrs, (Edwin H. Burton and J. H. Pollen eds.), London. Longmans, Green and Co., 1914 He was discharged on 10 September 1582. His whereabouts immediately thereafter are obscure but on 14 March 1583 he again entered the English College at Rheims and was ordained a priest in Rheims Cathedral on 31 March 1584. Using the alias Palmer, he set out for England the following 2 August. He served as chaplain at the Manor of Denham in Buckinghampshire. Denham was held by Edmund Peckham, whose wife Dorothy was the sister of John Gerard SJ. Dibdale was arrested near Tothill Street in London on 24 July 1586, and was imprisoned, first at the Counter, then at Newgate. Given the 1585 Act making it a capital offence to be a Catholic priest in England, the terrible sentence of hanging, drawing and quartering was inevitable. It was carried out at Tyburn on 8 October 1586. His fate was shared by two fellow priests, John Adams and John Lowe. All three priests were beatified (the last stage prior to canonisation) by Pope John Paul II on 22 November 1987. In 1998, the Catholic church in his home village, the Church of Our Lady Peace (opened in 1973), was rededicated to Our Lady of Peace and Blessed Robert Dibdale.

It lies on national route 1 which links the capital to the towns of Maradi and Zinder to the east and the RN25 heading to north to Tahoua, Agadez and Arlit. The limits of the Dogondoutchi district are roughly those of the ancient region of the Arewa. Since 2008, Dogondoutchi is the administrative centre of the surrounding Dogondoutchi department which carries the same name. It is part of the Dosso Region. The population is near 80 000 distributed over the urban centre with near 30 000, 17 villages lying 5 to 30 km from the centre and 5 Fula tribes.  Geography and geology  = Site of Dogondoutchi = The town of Dogondoutchi is dominated to the north by the imposing hill from which it derives its name and it lies along an intermittent river, the Mawri Dallol. It is situated in the southeast of Niger between the Sahel to the north and the edge of the savanna zone to the south. The region is marked by wide valleys (Dallols) which are generally dry and which, in the rainy season, drain a vast area extending from high areas of the A√Ør and the Adrar de Iforas in the north to the River Niger in the south. In this sedimentary basin there are extensive sand and clay deposits, the most recent dating from the Tertiary and Quaternary periods. As a result of a later drier climate during the Quaternary period, they hardened to form impermeable lateritic plateaus worn down to form a multitude of short ravines (koris) through which the rain water reaches the Mawri Dallol. 440x440px = Rainfall, drought and the struggle against erosion = The annual rainfall in Dogondoutchi varies from 400 to 600 mm, roughly equivalent to that of the Mediterranean region in France but it takes place only between June and October and there is never any rain from October to May. The rainfall may be very intense ‚Äì 50, to 150 mm a day, which leads to flash floods causing structural damage to the dry clay (so-called banco) houses along the koris and carrying off arable soil. The water is rapidly absorbed into the underground water layers or it reaches ponds which either dry out after the end of the rainy season or remain semi permanent (for example the Tapkin Saw close to the town). Following the catastrophic floods of 2002 the inhabitants, in association with international aide and the United Nations \\"Food For Work\\" Programme, constructed five kilometres of dykes which now protect the town. The experience gained during this operation has served in other parts of Niger and in Mali thanks to the Niger NGO \\"RAIL\\" = Access to drinking water = The surface water (temporary ponds) around Dogondoutchi is of use for animals but is not fit for human consumption. There exists however, a deep water layer but its use poses some problems: the local terrain made up of sand or gravel needs to be blocked up and the depth of the well (25 to 75m) requires the use of much energy to raise the water. This is provided by direct manpower (or more often womanpower) and by the use of animals. To surmount these problems, the local authorities mandated an agency from Niger which proposed a programme of rehabilitation and construction of around a hundred wells across the local area as well as the training of local maintenance staff. This programme, to be completed in 2016 has been financed through international co-operation and local funding.  Population  = Inhabitants = Street scene in Dogondoutchi The population is estimated to be near 80 000 (2011) with around 30 000 in the urban centre (previous figures near 57 000 in 2008 and near 7300 in 1966). The population is spread over 11 town districts, 17 villages lying 5 to 30 km from the centre and 5 Fula tribes. The ethnic groups are by order of numerical importance, the Hausa, the Fula, the Tuareg and the Djerma. Dogondoutchi is the common western border of the Hausa population, who form a majority of the population in an arc stretching from this area towards the east (Zinder). The Djerma who form the majority of the sedentary population of Niger are mostly settled towards the west whereas Dongondoutchi is the southern limit for the Fula who are pastoralists with semi-nomadic villages. Dogondoutchi marks the rough boundary between the Wodaabe (Central-Eastern Niger) Fula people and the Dallol and Bitinkoore Fulfulde dialect speaking Fula people of the west.Niger country profile: Ethnologue. Some of the older members of the Fula are settled. The Hausa and the Djerma are settled farmers mostly cultivating pearl millet and cowpea (small bean). The Tuareg initially from the north are also settled but continue to raise cattle in the traditional manner. Some also grow crops or are involved in commerce. = Administration = The town is administrated by the town council, which since the reforms of 2004, is elected. However, as is the case throughout Niger, the traditional chieftainship represented by a chief called \\"Kona\\" in association with the chiefs of the neighbourhoods and of the canton continue to raise taxes and also stimulate public awareness concerning the development of the town. = History = Dogondoutchi is known as the cultural centre of the Arewa region which roughly corresponds to the birthplace of the Mawari a subgroup of the Hausa. The history of Dogondoutchi is essentially that of the old region of the Arewa. In the 19th century, Queen Saraounia who lived at Lougou initially resisted the Tuareg invasion and opposed the 1899 colonial offensive by the Voulet-Chanoine mission (Battle of Lougou). After much destruction and the massacre of many, a French military post was set up at Dogondoutchi which was the site of a village of the Kwanawa surrounded by other villages that later gave rise to the different neighbourhoods of the town. The site of Dogondoutchi at the centre of the Arewa then favoured the installation and development of an administrative centre. = Religions = The dominant religion (90%) in Dogondoutchi is Islam as it is in for Niger as a whole and there are many mosques. The Maouris around Dogondoutchi are the last surviving animists amongst the Haussa.Adeline Masquelier. THE SCORPION'S STING: YOUTH, MARRIAGE AND THE STRUGGLE FOR SOCIAL MATURITY IN NIGER. Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute Volume 11 Issue 1, (2005), pp. 59 ‚Äì 83 The town is also a centre for gatherings of the Bori spirit possession ritual which has been studied by western anthropologists. The town also houses Catholic and Protestant missions.  Public health  = Hospitals and medical care = The health facilities in Dogondoutchi (2015) comprise a district hospital, a mother and child centre, three integrated health centres and seven health units relating to the neighbouring villages. There are 3 doctors, 14 nurses (male and female), 6 qualified midwives, 4 \\"matrons\\", 4 pharmacies and 2 pharmacy depots. Most of the births take place in a health centre and this has had a beneficial impact on the mother and child survival rate. The existence of the lakes leads to the proliferation of mosquitoes related with malaria. = Sanitation = To improve hygiene, the inhabitants have set up a Central Health Committee which has stimulated progress concerning the construction of latrines together with education in hygiene, and the organisation of refuse collection.  Installation of latrines  The programme for the construction of latrines and of waste water catch basins for individual houses was financed through loans obtained from a micro loan agency which was set up by a local woman group for this purpose. Since the end of the 1990s, more than 600 individual latrines have been built. In addition, latrines have been installed in schools and in public places with some also comprising showers. The success of this enterprise of family financing is unique in Africa (FARM report page 20). In the villages lying away from the town where the standard of living is lower, family latrines corresponding to the available individual funding have been constructed by the inhabitants themselves. Prior to this, a programme initiated by USAID was set up to raise awareness concerning hygiene following the CLTS method(Community-Led Total Sanitation). Meetings were held in each of the villages and were supported by the local radio station (Radio Dallol).  Refuse collection  Confronted with the problems linked with the irregular collection of waste and with their dispersion by domestic animals, the Central Sanitation Committee and the Neighborhood Councils with the help of the international agencies (Department of Essonne, AESN, SIOM) installed 20 waste containers in each neighbourhood and organised the collection of waste. A carter empties the containers two or three times a week using an ox and cart provided by the town council. The ox is initially supplied to the carter who ensures its upkeep and is able to purchase it after about 18 months activity. In the zones of economic activity, markets etc., each participating tradesman has (in 2015) the use of two garbage cans, one for biodegradable waste and one for plastics etc. The waste is either emptied in a garbage dump or bought and recycled by the inhabitants. A joint committee has been set up to monitor this programme and to address the severe problem posed by plastic waste which at present is burnt.  Education and cultural activities  = Schools = Ten different languages are in daily use in Niger and at least four are in use in Dogondoutchi.The official language is however French. The children follow an initiation in French from the first year in primary school which lasts 6 years. From the fourth year in primary school and during all of the secondary school, teaching is only in French. There are (in 2015) 67 primary schools, including 1 Franco-Arabic, with a total of 299 classes and 36 959 pupils ‚Äì 17 597 girls, 19 362 boys (numbers provided by the local school inspectors in 2015). There are 7 secondary colleges (4 public including 1 Franco Arabic, 3 private including 1 Franco-Arabic) and 6 high schools (3 public including 1 general education, 1 technical, 1 Franco-Arabic and 3 private including 1 Franco-Arabic). The total enrolment in the secondary schools is 20 173 (11 918 boys, 8 255 girls). The proportion of girls in primary education is almost the same as that of the boys whereas at the secondary level the proportion of girls is lower. The percentage of children in full-time education (nearly 100%) is much higher than that in Niger as a whole (girls 63.9%, boys 81.9%, total 72.9%,). The general education high school is attended by 1049 pupils and there are 20 classes of from 40 to 80 students. In addition 2995 children attend nursery and infant schools. These play an important role in preparing the children for primary school where they will learn French. Many problems remain in the school system concerning, for example, the training of teachers and the supply of school equipment. At the primary level, notebooks and pens are now provided .by the State. = Cultural activities = Dogondoutchi has a youth and culture centre and two cultural centres. The oldest is the Waye-Ka√Ø Center set up by the Catholic Mission and open to all. The library there was for a long time the only one in the town. The school at the mission established in 1947 by the R√©demptoristes Fathers, has helped train many of the elite of Niger of all religions. The CREED (Educational Resource and Exchange in Dogondoutchi) opened in 2011 close to the high school and to one of the junior colleges. The centre was initially destined for pupils and teachers but it is now open to all. In particular it offers an initiation in computing. It is supported by the State Department of Education through the provision of staff for the library, for the training in information technology and in maintenance. To encourage literacy and to help with the learning of French, a number of containers each with a hundred or so African books for children funded by the twinned town of Orsay (France) have been distributed in the schools. The books may be borrowed by the children for their own pleasure or for that of the other members of the family. Finally, there are 15 very animated centres dedicated to reading and writing.  Economy  = Agriculture = The agricultural production is strongly dependent on the climate which is that of the Sahel (see 1.1). To increase the amount of arable land and to limit erosion a system of stone rows has been set up. These complement the dykes that were installed around the town (see 1.2). Growth in the fields is only possible during the rainy season (June ‚Äì October). After, the production continues to March‚ÄìApril on areas around the temporary ponds until they dry up.  Traditional and developing open field agriculture  The traditional crops are pearl millet (a small grain cereal) and cowpea (a small bean). The output is low (200 to 300 kg/ha for millet) since the sandy soil is poor in clay and in organic matter. The seed company Ahleri was establishment in Dogondoutchi in 2008 by agronomists from Niger who were trained in Nigeria. This gave rise to a local initiative which was further supported by international funding that increased both agricultural output and revenue. It was proposed that each farmer reserve part of his land (roughly 1 hectare) for the use of improved seeds together with micro-doses of fertiliser. In 2013, 170 farmers from 5 villages were involved with a total area of 230 hectares. Over a three-year period when the rainfall was at a reasonable level, this method led to a 70% increase of production compared to that obtained in the nearby traditionally cultivated field. The farmers who followed this programme often increased their sales turnover by more than 50%. This procedure was also tested during the drought of 2011 when it also helped to foster mutual support within the community. Several factors are necessary to obtain this result. 1) improved agricultural methods, 2) the availability of micro-credits which may be repaid not just after the harvest when the prices are low but later when the market price reaches a reasonable level, 3) the availability of storage facilities during this time, 4) the organisation of mutual aid between the farmers at the level of each village. The increase in the level of cereal production has led to an increase in the amount raised through local taxes.  Market gardening  The areas concerned occupy about 20 hectares, mostly around the Tapkin Saw lake 1 to 2 km north west of the urban centre and around the village of Liguido. Traditionally they chiefly produce green vegetables but after the severe drought of 2005, it was suggested that the farmers around the Tapkin Saw diversify their production notably by growing more energy providing crops such as the potato. To this end the association \\"Agro Sans Fronti√®res\\" from Brittany provided the potato seeds without charge and this led to the organisation of a profitable commercial activity. The drought of 2011 stimulated a programme to extend the area that could be cultivated. A technical and hydrological study led to the project for an irrigation system, derived from the deep wells, which covers 80 hectares and which functions throughout the year. Attempts are underway to obtain the financing for an initial area of 33 hectares.  Cattle and goats  The raising of cattle and goats is usually carried out by the nomadic Fula population, who after the harvest, move southwards to make use of the grazing left in the fields. The rules concerning the access to the fields are controlled by the traditional chief (Kona). Each family possesses some farmyard animals such as guinea fowl and they also fatten veal before sale. = Crafts and businesses = A number of the traditional crafts are present in the urban centre (carpentry, iron work). In 2005, a local artisan developed a system of extraction from the wells which limits the contamination of the well by using two separated systems of ropes, one inside the well and one outside. This system has been adopted for all of the wells built or renovated through the programme supported by international aid (AESN). A technical training centre and a technical high school have been established locally to develop skills related to the installation and upkeep of the various technical facilities ( irrigation, sinking of wells, water distribution, auto mechanics, etc.). = Commerce = Dogondoutchi is situated at the junction of routes to the north, to Nigeria, to the east and to the west (Niamey). It possesses a hotel and many restaurants and it is a centre of commerce both for food and clothing. The bustling Friday market offers a wide selection of local products (cereals and vegetables) and it also comprises a cattle market.  References  * Ham, Anthony (contributor). West Africa 7.

The division was first formed in the summer of 1941, after the German invasion of the Soviet Union, and was sent to the front and destroyed in the Battle of Kiev in September. The division was formed a second time in October 1941 from the 5th Rifle Brigade, a separate infantry brigade fighting in the Continuation War against Finnish and German troops in Karelia. The new division spent most of the war in Karelia and in the summer of 1944 fought in the Vyborg‚ÄìPetrozavodsk Offensive, which resulted in the end of the Continuation War in September. The division was stationed at Belomorsk in Karelia until its disbandment after the end of World War II in July 1946.  First Formation  The 289th Rifle Division began forming from reservists on 10 July 1941 at Lubny. Its basic order of battle included the 1044th, 1046th, and 1048th Rifle Regiments, as well as the 281st Artillery Regiment. At the beginning of August, the division was assigned to the Southwestern Front's 26th Army. The division arrived at the 26th Army's positions from 2 to 5 August, taking up a defense along the Dnieper southeast of Kiev. The division fought in the Battle of Kiev and was destroyed in the Kiev pocket in September, along with most of the 26th Army. While the division was officially disbanded on 19 September, its commander and some remnants escaped to provide a cadre for the division's second formation.  Second Formation  The division's second formation was formed on 15 October 1941 from the 5th Rifle Brigade. The 5th Rifle Brigade had been redesignated on 5 October 1941 from the Murmansk Rifle Brigade, which was also called the Grivnik Brigade. The Murmansk Rifle Brigade was originally formed in July 1941. The brigade fought alongside the Soviet 88th Rifle Division against the Finnish J-Group of the Finnish III Corps and the German SS North during Operation Barbarossa. They beat back both forces, forcing the Finno-German troops to retire to the city of Kestenga, near Lake Topozero in September 1941. The brigade consisted of some local militia, the 242nd Rifle Regiment of the 104th Rifle Division and probably an artillery battalion of the same division. The division fought in Karelia for the rest of the war. In April 1942 it became part of the 32nd Army. From June to August 1944 it fought in the Svir-Petrozavodsk Offensive, during which it fought in the recapture of southern Karelia. The advances made in the offensive resulted in the Finnish ending the Continuation War in September. After the end of the Continuation War, the division became part of the 4th Rifle Corps of the Belomorsky Military District at Belomorsk by May 1945.Poirier and Connor The division was disbanded there with the corps on 10 July 1946.

His activity in philosophy, theology, and spirituality led many to consider him one of the greatest figures of 20th- century Anglicanism. He served as Warden of Keble College, Oxford, from 1960 to 1968. Life Farrer was born 1 October 1904, the only son of the three children of Augustine and Evangeline Farrer, in Hampstead, London, England. His father was a Baptist minister and Farrer was brought up in that faith. He went to St Paul's School in London he gained a scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford. Encouraged by his father to value scholarship, he nevertheless found the divisions within the Baptist church dispiriting, and while at Oxford he became an Anglican. Finding his spiritual home at St Barnabas Church in Oxford, his theology and his spirituality became profoundly Anglo-Catholic, although centred on the Book of Common Prayer. After gaining a first in greats, he went up to Cuddesdon Theological College where he trained alongside the future Archbishop of Canterbury, Michael Ramsey. He served a curacy in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, after which he was invited to become chaplain and tutor at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, in 1931 (a post he held until 1935). Farrer was a Fellow and Chaplain of Trinity College, Oxford, from 1935 to 1960. In 1937, he married Katharine Dorothy Newton, (daughter of the Rev. Frederick Henry Joseph Newton), who would become a mystery novelist. They had one child together in 1939, a daughter Caroline, who became an ecclesiastical embroiderer. On the death of Oliver Quick in 1959, the Regius Professorship of Divinity became vacant and Farrer's name was widely canvassed. However, his typological approach to the reading of scripture, notably in his books on Mark and the Book of Revelation, was out of the mainstream of biblical scholarship, and his article \\"On Dispensing with Q\\" (one of the supposed lost sources of the Gospels) raised a furore on both sides of the Atlantic. Henry Chadwick was appointed instead. The following year, Farrer was appointed as Warden of Keble College, Oxford, a post which he held until his death on 29 December 1968, aged 64. After Farrer's sudden death, Spencer Barrett as Sub-Warden presided over the change of college statute which removed the requirement for Keble College's Warden to be an Anglican clergyman. However, in the event the Warden appointed to succeed Farrer, Dennis Nineham, was another clergyman. Farrer is buried in Holywell Cemetery, Oxford. Work According to the Farrer hypothesis Mark was written first. The Gospel of Matthew was written using Mark as a source. Then the Gospel of Luke was written using both Mark and Matthew. Apart from his biblical scholarship, which was considered maverick, Farrer's work was mainly philosophical, though again he was out of the mainstream. He was not influenced by the empiricism of such contemporaries as John Wisdom, Gilbert Ryle, and A. J. Ayer. The \\"Metaphysicals\\", as his small group of fellow thinkers were called, were of an entirely different temper. His thinking was essentially Thomist, not only in his being heavily influenced by Thomas's thought but also in the dialogical way in which he presents his arguments, playing as he said, \\"out of dummy\\" (a term from the game of bridge) the views and objections of real or imaginary opponents of the thesis he was advancing at the time. His desire to be fair resulted in his almost never being sharp with his opponents. One of his closer friends was C.S. Lewis, a Christian apologist https://www.britannica.com/biography/C-S-Lewis who dedicated his book Reflections on the Psalms to him. Farrer took the last sacraments to Lewis before his death. Others included J. R. R. Tolkien and Dorothy Sayers. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Farrer has been more studied and more admired since his death in the United States than in his own country. His major contribution to Christian thought is his notion of \\"double agency\\", that human actions are fully our own but also are the work of God, though perfectly hidden. He described God for such purposes as \\"intelligent act\\".See . He presented his own solution to the synoptic problem, the so-called Farrer hypothesis in a short essay entitled \\"On Dispensing with Q\\". Q was the hypothetical source of those parts of Luke's and Matthew's gospel which are not in Mark but which are pretty much identical. He argued against the possibility of reconstructing Q noting that while it might have been impossible to reconstruct Mark from the other gospels had it been lost, Mark had not been lost. \\"I have a copy of it on my desk.\\" His making short work of such an established hypothesis infuriated many scholars and may have contributed to his not being made Regius Professor of Divinity. Michael Goulder was both a pupil and a notable defender of his thesis. His scepticism about much orthodox scholarship extended to a typically short but powerful critique of the German collection of essays Kerygma and Myth whose major contributor was Rudolf Bultmann. He averred, against them, that without the concept of miracle, the Christian project was fatally flawed, preferring the forms of existential defence of the faith of such as Gabriel Marcel to that of the Germans. His teasing style is indicated by his suggestion that Bultmann had freed the gospel from its fetters by amputating its limbs. He was known as a fine preacher and several books of his sermons were printed, all but one posthumously. His style was always to be generous to the despisers of the faith, illuminating his defences with glimpses into his own spiritual life. He had the gift of marrying considerable scholarship with profound spirituality. Serving at a weekday mass with him was said to be a moving experience. Bibliography His books included several on Mark, two commentaries on the book of Revelation, a study of the Temptations, entitled The Triple Victory (an Archbishop of Canterbury's Lent Book), philosophical works such as The Freedom of the Will, Finite and Infinite and Faith and Speculation, the apologetic books A Science of God (a Bishop of London's Lent Book) and Saving Belief, a defence of the goodness of God called Love Almighty and Ills Unlimited: an essay on providence and evil, a meditation on the Creed called Lord, I believe and numerous collections of sermons.

History of discovery All known specimens of Altirhinus were recovered in 1981 during collaborative expeditions organized by Soviet and Mongolian scientists, from the Khukhtek Formation in the Dornogovi Province of Mongolia. The Khukhtek was formed in the Aptian to Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous Period, which lasted from between 125 and 100 million years ago. Psittacosaurus and the primitive ankylosaurid Shamosaurus have also been found in these rocks. Several fossil specimens of different ages and sizes are known. The holotype, PIN 3386/8, is a skull, which is well preserved on the left side, as well as some postcranial material consisting of pieces of the hands, feet, shoulder and pelvic girdles. A more fragmentary skull was also recovered, associated with some ribs, fragmentary vertebrae, and a complete forelimb. A third specimen preserves many limb bones and a series of 34 tail vertebrae from a smaller individual. Two even smaller fragmentary skeletons, presumably of young individuals, were uncovered nearby. The remains of this animal were originally referred to the species Iguanodon orientalis, which was first described in 1952. However, I. orientalis has since been shown to be fragmentary, nondiagnostic, and virtually indistinguishable from the European I. bernissartensis (Norman, 1996). As no features of I. orientalis are shared exclusively with the 1981 specimens, which are clearly distinguishable from Iguanodon, a new name for those specimens was required. British paleontologist David B. Norman named them Altirhinus kurzanovi in 1998. The name was created from a Latin word, altus (\\"high\\") and a Greek word, ·ø•ŒØœÇ, rhis, genitive rhinos (\\"nose\\" or \\"snout\\"). There is one known species (A. kurzanovi), which honors Sergei Kurzanov, the influential Russian paleontologist who originally found the specimens in 1981. Description Altirhinus was herbivorous and bipedal when walking or running, but probably became quadrupedal when feeding from the ground. According to the original description, the entire body probably extended from snout to tail tip. In 2010 Gregory S. Paul estimated the length at 6.5 meters (21 ft), the weight at 1.1 tonnes.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 291 The skull alone is about 760 mm long, with a wide mouth and a distinctive tall arch on top of its snout, from which this dinosaur derives its name. Taxonomy Altirhinus is definitely an advanced iguanodontian, just basal to the family Hadrosauridae, but there is little agreement on the arrangement of genera and species in this area of the ornithopod family tree. In the original description, it was included with Iguanodon and Ouranosaurus in a family Iguanodontidae (Horman, 1998). More recent analyses all find Altirhinus more derived than either of those two genera, but less than Protohadros, Probactrosaurus, and hadrosaurids (Head, 2001; Kobayashi & Azuma, 2003; Norman, 2004). The former two studies also place Eolambia between Altirhinus and hadrosaurids, while Norman's analysis finds that the two genera share a clade. Fukuisaurus is just basal to Altirhinus according to the only analysis in which the former has been included (Kobayashi & Azuma, 2003). Paleobiology Many aspects of Altirhinus' anatomy allow speculation on its behavior. =Locomotion= As its forelimbs were roughly half the length of its hindlimbs, Altirhinus appears to have been primarily bipedal. However, its carpals (wrist bones) were thick and blocky, and the three middle fingers of its hand were wide, hyperextendable, and ended in hoof-like bones. This indicates that the forelimbs were also capable of supporting weight. Like many ornithopods, Altirhinus may have spent a significant amount of time in a quadrupedal position, perhaps while feeding. =Feeding= While the three middle digits of each forelimb (digits II, III, & IV) were very thick and probably weight bearing, the outside fingers (digits I & V) were modified in different ways. The first digit was a simple sharp spike, as seen in Iguanodon. Aside from defense, the thumb spike could possibly have also been used for breaking the shells of seeds or fruit. The fifth digit was somewhat opposable to the rest of the hand and may have been useful for grasping food. There is a large diastema, or gap, between the keratinous beak on the front of the mouth and the main chewing teeth in the side of the mouth, which would allow the two sections to work independently, so Altirhinus could crop with its beak while simultaneously chewing with its teeth. Many herbivorous mammals show a similar adaptation and can crop with their incisors without disturbing their chewing molars. Altirhinus was one of a number of advanced iguanodontians with snouts expanded outwards towards the end. This is quite possibly an example of convergent evolution with hadrosaurids, famous for their wide \\"duckbill\\" snouts. These adaptations are also paralleled in many living mammalian herbivores of different lineages. Modern cows, horses, and white rhinoceros all exhibit wide muzzles and all are grazing animals. Grazing most often occurs at ground level, and if the expanded muzzles of Altirhinus and other related species were an adaptation to grazing, this may also explain corresponding weight-bearing adaptations of the forelimbs in derived iguanodontians, in order to get the head closer to the ground. =Nasal arch= Skull cast The characteristic arched snout of Altirhinus was formed primarily by the nasal bones, and a similar structure is seen on the snout of the Australian Muttaburrasaurus. Many different functions have been proposed for the nasal arch. It may have housed tissues to cool the blood, conserve water, or enhance the sense of smell. Alternatively, it may have facilitated communication through vocalization or visual display. As only two skulls have been located, it is entirely possible that the arched snout is only found in one gender, in which case it may have been used for sexual display, like in modern-day elephant seals.

The practice came to symbolise the worst of variously contrived tax strategies from those times. In its 1986/87 annual report, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) stated a total 6,688 companies had been involved, involving revenue of between $500 million and $1 billion. Operation The operation at the heart of bottom of the harbour schemes involved a company would be stripped of assets and accumulated profits before its tax fell due, leaving it then unable to pay. Once assets were stripped, the company would be sent, metaphorically, to the \\"bottom of the harbour\\" by being transferred to someone of limited means and with little interest in its past activities. The company's records were often lost too. The ATO, being in the same position as other unsecured creditors in the case of an insolvent company, ended up with nothing. Promoters such as lawyers or accountants generally facilitated the transactions. The promoter would help the owners of a company first transfer the assets to a new company which was to continue the business, then the owners sold the old company to the promoter for the value of the untaxed accumulated profits, less an amount representing a fee or commission. For the owners this was the sale of a capital asset and hence untaxed (being prior to capital gains tax). The promoter would have the company pay (to the promoter) a dividend of the money it had left, then the promoter on-sold the now empty shell to someone else. The way the promoter paid the owners for undistributed profits was similar to a dividend strip operation. In any case the amount the promoter paid was a tax deduction (since the promoter would be in the business of buying and selling shares) and the dividend would be taxable income, leaving just the promoter's commission taxable, not the whole original company profit. The \\"harbour\\" in the expression was usually taken as referring to Sydney Harbour (which is adjacent to the financial district), though obviously the sense is also quite general. The actual origin of the name and the practice is not clear. Deputy Crown Solicitor debacle The first time the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) detected a bottom of the harbour scheme was in 1973. Rod Todman, a senior investigations officer in Perth, found a scheme involving about 50 companies and selected one for investigation. By 1974, he had assembled evidence which was referred to the Deputy Crown Solicitor (DCS) in Perth for possible prosecution as a test case. The DCS was uncertain of the prospects for the case, but in late 1974 had a Queen's Counsel opinion strongly recommending charges of conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth be brought against the promoter and two other individuals. There then followed delay upon delay, duplicated investigations, ill-prepared reports by inexperienced officers, and even a DCS officer deliberately avoiding contact with the ATO. After five full years, in April 1979, and based on miscommunication, the Crown Solicitor in Canberra advised the ATO that the evidence was insufficient and the case was dropped. It might well have been that it was not strong enough, but that decision was not arrived at in a well- considered way. The performance of the various DCS officers was later the subject of scathing criticism, with problems arising primarily from (possibly deliberately) overworked and underskilled staff, and bad management. The abandoned case came to light in only 1982 in the Costigan Royal Commission investigating activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. The Commission came upon bank account transactions for millions of dollars, and the \\"paper trail\\" led eventually, and among other things, to the bottom drawers of the DCS Perth. The commission also found that the wife of one of the senior case officers at the DCS Perth was running an escort service, and that she was a company secretary at several companies which were involved in bottom of the harbour schemes. There was no suggestion her husband improperly used his position, but the connection was close enough to be extremely embarrassing for all concerned, and the officer was dismissed. (Source??) Legislation =Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980= In 1980, the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980 put an end to bottom of the harbour schemes. Under the act it became a criminal offence for any person to make a company or trust unable to pay tax debts (income tax, sales tax, etc.), or to aid or abet any person or company doing so. The act thus caught both those in the schemes and the promoters of such schemes. It made it unnecessary in the future to address the activity as a crime of defrauding the Commonwealth through the Deputy Crown Solicitor office, which up to this point had been poorly managed. This act was controversial at the time, since tax avoidance was regarded as something less than an outright crime. Tax matters might normally be addressed by closing a revenue loophole, the act instead treated bottom of the harbour schemes like frauds. However, once certain behaviour has been criminalised, what was once tax avoidance (which is legal) becomes tax evasion (which, by definition, is not). =Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Act 1982= The Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Act 1982 went further, allowing for the recovery of tax avoided under bottom of the harbour tax schemes between 1 January 1972 and 4 December 1980. The retrospectivity in this act was even more controversial than making the avoidance a crime. Treasurer John Howard said the normal reluctance against retrospectivity was \\"tempered by the competing consideration of overall perceptions as to the equity and fairness of our taxation system and the distribution of the tax burden.\\" (House, 23 September 1982). Senator Don Chipp thought the purpose noble but was strongly against retrospectivity, saying \\"I do not trust politicians to legislate retrospectively. One of the few protections that the ordinary citizen has is that he knows the law.\\" (Senate, 19 November 1982).

It is also a 1930s design, which is well-suited to hot-rodding's roots and tradition. As with all types of car customization, various modifications are practiced in different combinations. One popular method of conversion involves removing all body molding, bumpers and fenders, then installing a classic Ford front axle to move the wheels forward and give the car a low, stretched look. Another popular customization is to move the stock Volkswagen axle beam forward or reverse the trailing/torsion arms and re-work the steering linkages. A Volksrod might be finished off with a chopped top and original VW wheels. Paint jobs may be flat black, or more elaborate, including with pinstriping.

The name Tchamba stands for both a city located in Tchamba Prefecture in the Centrale Region of Togo, and the tribe living in that area. Tchamba is originally a tribe living in and around the town of Chamba, Ghana in the Northern Region, Ghana of present-day Ghana, on the road from Salaga to Bimbilla. Part of the tribe is still living there; others have migrated to Accra and there is also an ex-pat community of (T)Chambas in Frankfurt (Main) in Germany. The (T)Chambas are known as aborigines (indigenous people) of Northern Ghana, once covering an area as large as the present Dagbon. Due to major tribal wars between the Dagomba people and the Kokomba people in the aftermath of the First World War, many of them fled to present-day Tchamba in Northern Togo, while others fled to Accra, but a third group survived in the North of Ghana. The various groups maintain close relations, for example in the Chamba Heritage Society and it is not uncommon for families to live in two of their homelands. The Tchamba language is widely spoken in Togo, Ghana, Benin, and Nigeria. They have linguistical affiliations with Konkonba, Bassari. They are predominantly Moslems. In Togo, the major clans are Imamwa, Congoro, Lari, Dopo, Sangbe, Lambu, Daru, Atarouwa, Nantoh, Ninchey,Kumateh, and others. The Congoros are the origins there, whereby the Laris among others came. The kingship was originally for the Congoros while the Islamic leadership position (Imam) is always held by Imamwa as their name implies. Some of the major towns in Tchamba are Alibi, Kasaleym and Affem Boussou. References *Hunter- Hindrew, Mamaissii V. M.Ed.

Like other nodosaurs, it would have been a slow-moving quadrupedal herbivore covered in heavy armor scutes, but without a tail club. The skull measures approximately 25 cm (10 inches) in length, suggesting the animal as a whole was no more than 3 meters (10 feet) long.  Discovery and species  Detail of skull and neck. Reconstructed skeleton at the USU Eastern Prehistoric Museum, Price, Utah Other angle of skeleton Size of Animantarx, compared to a human. The generic name is composed of the Latin words animatus (\\"living\\" or \\"animated\\") and arx (\\"fortress\\" or \\"citadel\\"), referring to its armored nature. In particular, the name is a reference to a comment made by paleontologist R. S. Lull about ankylosaurs, that as \\"an animated citadel, these animals must have been practically unassailable...\\"Lull, R.S. 1914. Rulers of the Mesozoic. Yale Review 3: 352-363. The type species is the only one known so far, and is called A. ramaljonesi after its discoverer, Ramal Jones. His wife, Carol Jones, also discovered the contemporaneous dinosaur Eolambia nearby. Only one specimen of Animantarx has so far been recovered. The remains include the lower jaw and back half of the skull, along with neck and back vertebrae, and various limb elements. Animantarx is characterized by a unique combination of features, including a highly domed skull back, small horns on the postorbital and quadratojugal bones of the skull, and a mandible which is only armoured on half of its length. These fossil remains were discovered in the Mussentuchit Member of the Cedar Mountain Formation in the eastern portion of the U.S. state of Utah. This section of the formation is believed to represent the late Albian through early Cenomanian stages of the Late Cretaceous Period, or about 106 to 97 million years ago. At least 80 other vertebrate species are known from the Mussentuchit, including fish, frogs, lizards, snakes, crocodilians, dinosaurs, birds, and mammals, although not all are complete enough to name. Many dinosaur groups are represented by fossils from this member, including carnivorous theropods as well as several different herbivorous types, including the iguanodont Eolambia. The presence of aquatic animals like fish and frogs, as well as the mudstone in which their fossils are found, suggests that this was a floodplain environment.Kirkland, J.I., Britt, B., Burge, D.L., Carpenter, K., Cifelli, R., DeCourten, F., Eaton, J., Hasiotis, S., and Lawton, T. 1997. Lower to Middle Cretaceous dinosaur faunas of the Central Colorado Plateau: a key to understanding 35 million years of tectonics, sedimentology, evolution, and biogeography. Brigham Young University Geology Studies 42:69-103. Earlier layers within the Cedar Mountain Formation contain different nodosaur species. The oldest layer, known as the Yellow Cat Member, contains Gastonia, while the intermediate Poison Strip and Ruby Ranch Members contain remains which may belong to Sauropelta. The Mussentuchit, which is the youngest member of the Cedar Mountain, contains only Animantarx. While there is still a lot of exploration left to be done, this division of nodosaur species corresponds with that of other dinosaur groups and provides support for the hypothesis of three separate faunas in the Cedar Mountain Formation. The Mussentuchit fauna includes many taxa which may be of Asian origin and suggests a dispersal event may have occurred from Asia into North America around this time.Carpenter, K., Kirkland, J.I., Burge, D.L., & Bird, J. 1999.

Fossils in this region are often slightly radioactive, and remains of Animantarx were actually discovered following a radiological survey of the area performed by Ramal Jones, which located a higher level of radioactivity at a certain location. Subsequent excavation at this site turned up the fossil skeleton of Animantarx; no bones had been exposed on the surface.Jones, R.D. & Burge, D.L. 1995. Radiological surveying as a method for mapping dinosaur bone sites. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 15: 38A.  Classification  Animantarx is universally thought of as a nodosaurid ankylosaur, although its precise relationships within that family are uncertain. The most recent cladistic analysis of ankylosaur phylogeny does not include Animantarx, although the authors recognize the genus as Nodosauridae incertae sedis because of its rounded supraorbital protrusions and a \\"knoblike\\" acromion on the scapula.Vickaryous, M.K., Maryanska, T., & Weishampel, D.B. 2004.

Immediately prior to its dissolution, it covered an area in western and northern Yorkshire as well as the south Teesdale area administered by County Durham which is traditionally part of Yorkshire. The cities of Ripon and Leeds were within its boundaries as were the towns of Harrogate, Richmond, Knaresborough, Hawes and Bedale and the surrounding countryside; its northern boundary was the River Tees. The diocesan Bishop of Ripon had his cathedral church at Ripon. The diocese was also served by a suffragan Bishop of Knaresborough and was divided into two archdeaconries, those of Richmond and Leeds. For organizational purposes, the diocese was further divided into eight deaneries: Richmond, Wensley, Ripon, Harrogate, Allerton, Headingley, Armley and Whitkirk. The first four deaneries are located in the Archdeaconry of Richmond, and the latter four are in the Archdeaconry of Leeds. The former Diocese covered an area of 1,359 square miles, with a range of urban and rural parishes, these range from urban areas like Holbeck and Armley with New Wortley, urban centres like Ripon and Richmond and rural parishes like Danby Wiske with Hutton Bonneville in the Vale of Mowbray, Eryholme on the southern bank of the River Tees and Upper Nidderdale high in the Yorkshire Dales. History The diocese of Ripon was originally created out of the dioceses of York and Chester in 1836 with Charles Thomas Longley consecrated as its first bishop. It was the first diocese to be created in England after the Reformation, and was erected on 5 October 1836 under the Established Church Act 1836. In a process which began with commission recommendations in 1989 and in 1997,Archvied included Diocesan Synod on 20 June 1998,Archived General Synod approval in November 1998 and royal assent in May 1999, the diocese was renamed 'The Diocese of Ripon and Leeds' in order to reflect the demographic importance of Leeds within its boundaries; the name change to effect on 3 September 1999, the day after David Young's retirement as bishop. The diocesan bishop's residence and offices and the diocesan offices were based in Leeds, while the cathedral remained Ripon Cathedral; after 1999, the diocese was known as Ripon and Leeds diocese, or, less often, Ripon diocese. The central importance of Leeds to the area was further recognised in the eventual creation of the new Diocese of Leeds.

The fourth tropical cyclone, third named storm, and second hurricane of the 1993 Pacific hurricane season, Calvin developed from an area of convection to the south of Mexico on July 4. The following day, the system intensified into a tropical storm, which was named Calvin. Continued strengthening ensued as Calvin curved from its initial westward track northward, and was upgraded to a hurricane on July 6 Calvin eventually turned northwest, and became a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS). By July 7, Hurricane Calvin made landfall near Manzanillo at peak strength. Calvin rapidly weakened after landfall, and was a tropical storm when it reemerged into the Pacific Ocean on early on July 8. Despite this, the hurricane did not reintensify, and continued to weaken as it headed rapidly northwestward. As Calvin made a second Mexican landfall near the southern tip of Baja California peninsula late on July 8, it weakened to a tropical depression. Early on July 9, the depression dissipated shortly after entering the Pacific Ocean for a third time. Calvin was only the third July hurricane on record to make landfall on the west coast of Mexico. Throughout the nation of Mexico, Calvin dropped heavy rainfall, especially in the southwestern portion of the country. Heavy rainfall produced flooding, which, in turn, caused mudslides. In the wake of Calvin, 37 fatalities were reported. Most of the casualties were due to flooding or car accidents. In the state of Michoac√°n, 700 homes were destroyed. In addition, a storm surge was reported. Many boats and shoreline structures from Acapulco to Manzanillo were damaged. Heavy seas near L√°zaro C√°rdenas in western Mexico caused a ship, which contained sulfuric acid, to leak. The cleanup effort took one month to complete. In all, 30,000 people were displaced by the storm. Overall, Calvin caused $32 million (1993 US$) in damage. Background A trough steered Calvin northward to hit Mexico as a hurricane in the month of July, making Calvin one of only three Pacific hurricanes to strike the nation since HURDAT started keeping records during the 1949 Pacific hurricane season. The other ones were Hurricane Eugene in 1987 and the third storm in 1954. Meteorological history Hurricane Calvin originated from an area of disturbed weather, characterized with scattered deep convection, that developed south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec on the second day of July. Despite the lack of concentrated convection, the system was classified using the Dvorak technique, a tool used to measure a tropical cyclone's intensity. However, during the morning hours of July 4, banding features formed on the southern semicircle of the disturbance, and it is estimated that the system attained tropical depression status at 1200 UTC while centered approximately southeast of Acapulco. Initially, the storm was expected to stay offshore and attain winds of . Intensifying within a favorable atmospheric environment, the depression attained tropical storm status at 0000 UTC on July 5, receiving the name Calvin. A period of rapid intensification ensued shortly thereafter, and banding-type eye formed in association with Calvin later that day. By July 5, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) was predicting winds of . Later that day, the NHC reported winds of . Continuing to intensify, the system was upgraded to a hurricane at 0000 UTC on July 6 while becoming the second hurricane of the season, though operationally, it was believed to have become a hurricane three hours earlier. Upon becoming a hurricane, the NHC revised their forecast and was now expecting Calvin to become a Category 3 hurricane on the SSHWS. Around this time, Hurricane Calvin was embedded within the northeastern portion of a large, monsoon-like deep-layer-mean, which stretched from the Intertropical Convergence Zone to the southwest Mexican coastline. Furthermore, Calvin was a fairly large cyclone as surface winds of were reported over from the storm's center. During the late morning hours of July 6, Calvin briefly slowed down before quickly accelerating to the northwest, bringing Calvin's gale-force winds south-southwest of Acapulco. Later that day, the NHC upgraded Calvin into a Category 2 hurricane. At 1200 UTC on July 7, Calvin reached its peak intensity of and a minimum barometric pressure of . Shortly thereafter, Calvin made landfall, approximately west-northwest of Manzanillo. The storm quickly weakened over land, and by the evening, it had weakened into a tropical storm. After weakening greatly due to land interaction with the mountainous terrain of Mexico, Calvin reentered the Pacific at 0000 UTC on July 8. Although initially expected to turn west, this did not occur. Instead, Calvin continued northwest, accelerating while emerging into the Gulf of California. Calvin weakened to a tropical depression late on July 8 as it made a second landfall along the extreme southern Baja California peninsula. After crossing the coast, Tropical Depression Calvin dissipated the next day atop of cold sea surface temperatures. Preparations Prior to making landfall, a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch was issued for a portion of the Mexican coast on July 6. Six hours later, a hurricane warning was issued. By July 8, all hurricane warnings were discontinued. Six hours later, all hurricane watches were dropped. By 1800 UTC that day, all watches and warnings were dropped. In addition to the watches and warnings, flash floods and mudslides to occur. In Acapulco, hundreds of police and emergency workers were on stand by in advance of the storm. Meanwhile, the city's airport and ports were closed. Further south, in Oaxaca, the ports of Puerto Escondido, Puerto √Ångel, Bahias de Huatulco, and Salina Cruz were closed. As a precautionary measure, the port of Zihuatanejo was also closed. In all, many sea ports were closed and airplane flights were canceled leaving many vacationers stranded. Multiple hotels were closed in the cities of Acapulco, Puerto Angel, and Huatulco. While weakening, the storm also threatened ports such as Mazatl√°n along the Gulf of California coast. Impact Calvin's rainfall across southern Mexico Due to the storm's large size, Hurricane Calvin was responsible for heavy flooding along much of the coast of Mexico, and after moving onshore as a hurricane, two locations (El Marques, Japala Del) reported as high as of rain. The flooding led to mudslides, killing 28 people on land, with 30,000 people displaced. Most of the casualties were indirect. In all, 37 people perished due to Hurricane Calvin. Nationwide 42,063 people were evacuated from their homes. Numerous seaside restaurants were washed off their respective foundations. Banana, mango, and corn plantations were also destroyed by the strong winds. Coconut trees were reportedly brought down as well. In Puebla, a peasant died. Inland, 16 persons were killed in the states of Mexico and San Luis Potos√≠, where heavy rains caused mudslides across higher elevations. In the latter, 11 deaths were reported as two rivers had overflowed their banks while in the former, five people died. Moreover, six people riding in a taxi died in Veracruz during Calvin. Across Nayarit, Calvin brought heavy rains to the state. Later in its duration, Calvin struck the Baja California peninsula, though the storm had weakened considerably by that time Offshore, three ships containing 659 immigrants were intercepted by the storm, but the ship sustained no damage. In all, the damage from Hurricane Calvin amounted to over 100 million new pesos, or $32 million (1993 USD). Despite the devastation, many vacationers did not alter their plans because of the hurricane. =Oaxaca= Prior to affecting Guerrero, Hurricane Calvin was responsible for heavy rains and widespread flooding across Oaxaca. An estimated 7,000 were left homeless along the Oaxacan coast and on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. In addition, travel from the isthmus was cut off due to mudslides that blocked portions of the Pan-American Highway. Two rivers threatened to overflow their banks while the Benito, Juarez, and Yosocuta dams attained peak capacity and thus the gates were opened to prevent overflowing. A total of 42 communities were flooded. The cities of Tehuantepec, Salina Cruz, Juchtianm, and Tuxtepec were flooded due to extended periods of torrential rains. Across the state, the rains blocked highways and knocked out electrical, telephone, and water services. About 3,000 people took refuge to shelters and one person was killed. =Guerrero= In Acapulco, waves of moved through the city. In several states, between to inches of rain was recorded. However, in Las Pilas, the highest rainfall total was observed, at . Prior to landfall, the storm's outer rainbands began to spread over the region, resulting in flooding. Throughout Acapulco, the storm uprooted 100 trees and caused some damage to roads. Although the city escaped significant damage, many huts were damaged and 1,600 people were left homeless. Citywide six people were killed while two other fisherman were missing. A mudslide killed a man and a son one person was reported dead after trying to save his boat from sinking. In addition, 13 boats sunk due to high waves, which impeded all maritime activity along the coast. In the city of Zihuatanejo, heavy rains flooded streets; consequently, \\"waist-deep\\" water was reported in some parts of the city. As a result, tourists were evacuated to higher ground. A total of 2,000 people were forced to abandon their homes. Two people sustained minor injuries when a tree was uprooted. Many neighborhoods throughout Acapulco were flooded. Overall, several beach communities were destroyed, almost 1,000 dwellings were destroyed, thousands of people were left homeless, and many areas remained without electricity. Statewide, the majority of storm damage occurred over a stretch of road, which was situated about north of Acapulco. About a dozen small wood-built restaurants were swept away by high waves. At a nearby small beach resort, four cottages were damaged due to the winds and were later swept away. One two-story hotel was nearly destroyed as all that remained undamaged after the storm was a swimming pool. In a resort town situated northwest of the city, high waves pounded many small resorts. =Colima= Following Calvin's closest approach to Manzanillo, the Mexican Weather Service station in the city recorded a minimum barometric pressure of , as well as surface winds as the center of Calvin passed a little to the west. The Instituto Oceanografico del Pacifico in Manzanillo reported a minimum central pressure of in addition to gale-force winds. Statewide, sustained winds of were observed around 1300 UTC. Shortly thereafter, near 1545 UTC, sustained winds of with gusts up to were reported in Manzanillo. Offshore, several ships reported rough weather during Calvin's existence, with the Pacific Sandpiper reporting a maximum wave height of . Two fatalities occurred offshore when a trimaran capsized; two fishermen were also reported missing. A pair children were killed by a mudslide. Damage to boats and shoreline structures extended from Acapulco to Manzanillo. Electrical and water services were cut off to the city of Mazanillio. In all, 4,000 people were evacuated from their homes throughout the state. Several ports were also closed. Throughout Colima, lime and mango crops sustained $4.3 million in damage. =Michoac√°n= In the state of Michoac√°n, 700 homes were destroyed. Moreover, many bridges and highways were destroyed due to a storm surge. A total of 4,000 persons fled their homes in Michoacan, including 3,000 alone in L√°zaro C√°rdenas. Crop damage in both this state and Colima totaled to $7 million. Numerous communities were completely evacuated. Although initially not expected to pose a threat to the chemicals on the ship Betula, rough seas near L√°zaro C√°rdenas caused all of sulfuric acid to leak aboard the previously beached cargo tanker. The tow line snapped when a tug was taking it out to sea. Two of the four tanks broke off by July 7. The Mexican Navy then decided it would be best to tow the ship to shore and neutralize the battery acid that the ship contained. It was estimated that such project could take two weeks. =Jalisco= Shortly after making its first landfall, the storm moved over a sparsely populated portion of Mexico near Puerto Vallarta. Throughout the region from Manzanillo to Puerto Vallarta, no deaths were reported. However, phones and power services were disrupted and many roads were blocked due to extensive flooding. However, further details about impact could not be obtained due to lack of communication, though some places sustained waist-high water. However, the resort city of Puerto Vallarta itself was spared, receiving just some rain and light winds. About south of the city, numerous coastal roads were destroyed due to mudslides. In all, 10 towns were flooded. Aftermath During the aftermath of the storm, troops were called in to deliver aid to the victims of the storm. A state of emergency was declared in at least ten states in Mexico following Calvin's passage. Furthermore, Mexican officials implemented emergency measures with assistance of agencies such as the Mexican Army and the local health department in the most of the devastated areas. Civil protection authorities donated food to more than 40,000 people for three days. They distributed around 11,000 blankets, 5,000 mattresses, 8,000 sacks of sand to reinforce dikes, and an additional of food, medicine, and clothes. Many Los Angeles residents looked for ways to donate aid to the needy. Then-Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari announced that the government would channel $11.4 million to three of the hardest-hit states. The government channeled $2.7 million to Guerrero alone (half of which was supplied to Acapulco) for reconstruction efforts. Michoacan was also expected to receive $4.7 million in aid while Colima was expected to acquire $4 million. Once the hurricane had moved away from the coast, airports quickly re-opened. Simultaneously, fishermen in Playa Azul protested that their livelihood was endangered due to fishing bans caused by the chemical spill; consequently, in L√°zaro C√°rdenas, 28 people were arrested while warrants for 526 others' arrest were issued for disturbing peace and blocking highways. This sparked protests from two environmental group as a well a group of Mexican artists. Also, the fisherman demanded a $1 million compensation. Within a week after the storm, additional rains had moved into the area, leading to further damage and eight fatalities.

The colony officially disbanded in 1892. The establishment of Sequoia National Park in 1890 contributed to the colony's demise. Some of their descendants still reside in the area. History =Establishment= Inspired by the writings of Laurence Gronlund, colony leaders attempted to apply the ideals of scientific socialism. The writings of United States socialist Edward Bellamy also influenced the project. March 9, 1888, the colony was legally established through the Deed of Settlement and Bylaws of Kaweah Colony. This colony based its economy on logging. Membership cost $500 with $100 payable upon application and the remainder in installments of cash or labor. Estimated nationwide membership peaked at 300-500 individuals, many of whom were non- resident supporters. The resident population at its height was around 150. The colony published the local area's first newspaper, the Kaweah Commonwealth. Kaweah Colony was noteworthy for its exploration of giant sequoia groves. The colony originally named what is now known as the General Sherman tree the Karl Marx tree. The only remaining structure from the group's tenure at Sequoia is the Squatter's Cabin, now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. =Demise and legacy= The colony ran into legal problems when they attempted to continue operations after the creation of the national park, which was California's first national park and only the second in the United States. A U.S. District Court in Los Angeles court convicted them of illegal logging on April 16, 1891. In January 1892, the Kaweah Cooperative Colony company was dissolved. For more than four decades some colonists attempted to gain government compensation for the loss of their logging claims, but were not successful. Kaweah lives on in name at Twin Oaks Community, a contemporary intentional community of 100 members in Virginia. All Twin Oaks' buildings are named after communities that no longer exist, and \\"Kaweah\\" is the name of the largest and most eco-featured residence. Footnotes Further reading * Robert V.

On the death of his wife, he divided his property among his children and left for the Continent to become a priest. Ryan, Patrick W.F. \\"Ven. John Amias.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1.

He was ordained a priest in Rheims Cathedral on 25 March 1581. On 5 June of that year Amias, set out for Paris and then England, as a missionary, in the company of another priest, Edmund Sykes. Of his missionary life we know little. Towards the end of 1588 he was seized at the house of a Mr. Murton at Melling in Lancashire and imprisoned in York Castle. Given the 1585 Act making it a capital offence to be a Catholic priest in England the sentence of hanging, drawing and quartering was inevitable. It was carried out outside the city of York on 16 March 1589. Amias was beginning to address the assembled people, and explain that it was for religion, and not treason, that he suffered, but was not allowed to proceed.Stanton, Richard, A Menology of England and Wales, p.119, Burns 7 Oates, Ltd., London, 1892 His fate was shared by a fellow priest, Robert Dalby.

The event is best remembered because it produced one of the most iconic photos of Western gamblers and gunfighters who played roles in the history of the Wild West.  Luke Short and the Long Branch Saloon  Luke Short arrived in Dodge City during April 1881. William H.

The citizens also elected all five of the city council candidates running with Deger.Dodge City Times, April 5, 1883 On April 23 the Dodge City Council passed two ordinances that were immediately approved by Mayor Deger. \\"Ordinance No. 70\\" was for \\"The Suppression of Vice and Immorality within the City of Dodge City,\\" while \\"Ordinance No. 71\\" was used to \\"Define and Punish Vagrancy.\\" Both of these ordinances were aimed at the Long Branch Saloon. On April 28, 1883 three prostitutes employed at the Long Branch were arrested by City Marshal Jack Bridges and policeman Louis C. Hartman. Soon afterward Short and Hartman exchanged gunfire. Neither man was hurt. Short was quickly arrested and released on $2,000 bond. His preliminary examination was set for May 2.Ford County Globe (Dodge City), May 1, 1883  Luke Short forced out of Dodge  On April 30 Luke Short was again arrested (along with five other gamblers) and placed in jail. The following day Short and the five others were escorted to the train depot and given their choice of east or west-bound trains.Dodge City Times, May 3, 1883 Short went east to Kansas City, Missouri where he looked up Charles E. Bassett at the Marble Hall Saloon. Bassett and Luke had a lot in common, not the least of which was that they both, at different times, owned an interest in the Long Branch Saloon. Bassett had served as the first sheriff of Ford County, as well as city marshal of Dodge City. Both Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson had, at various times, served under Bassett as deputies. Together, Short and Bassett, along with William F. Petillon, began laying the groundwork for Luke's reinstatement in Dodge. Luke went to Topeka on May 10, where he presented a petition to Governor George W. Glick. Short then returned to Kansas City where he was joined by Bat Masterson. Things started to heat up when Wyatt Earp arrived in Dodge City, along with several gunfighters, on May 31. Short, Earp and Petillon met in Kinsley, Kansas on June 3, 1883 and took the afternoon train to Dodge City. Mayor Deger issued a proclamation the following day ordering the closing of all gambling places in Dodge City.Leavenworth Times, June 5, 1883  Dodge City Peace Commission  Mayor Deger's action came during the cattle season and promised ruin for the cowtown's seasonal boom. So it was that economics - rather than bloodshed - resolved the \\"Dodge City War.\\" Additional pressure to resolve the issue had come from Governor Glick, as well as the Santa Fe Railroad, which did considerable business in Dodge. The gambling halls, dance halls and saloons were then ordered reopened, including the Long Branch. On June 9 both sides met in a dance hall that opened that night and resolved their differences. The following day ‚Äì June 10, 1883 ‚Äì eight men gathered and posed for what has become one of the most reproduced Wild West history photos. The group was immediately dubbed the \\"Dodge City Peace Commission.\\" The eight men in the historic photo were: William H. Harris, Luke Short, Bat Masterson, William F. Petillon, Charles E. Bassett, Wyatt Earp, Michael Francis \\"Frank\\" McLean and Cornelius \\"Neil\\" Brown. Immediately after the photo was taken, Bat Masterson and Wyatt Earp departed on a west bound train for Colorado.Dodge City Times, June 14, 1883 The Long Branch Saloon had reopened and the bloodless \\"Dodge City War\\" had ended, but Luke Short had decided the time had come to leave Dodge on his own terms. On November 19, 1883 Short and Harris sold the Long Branch to Roy Drake and Frank Warren.Ford County Globe (Dodge City), November 20, 1883 Short then moved to San Antonio for a brief time, before deciding to relocate in Fort Worth.Ford County Globe (Dodge City), January 1, 1884.

It is only known from disassociated remains that were originally described as comprising a partial skull, a tooth, a sacrum, an ilium, an ischium, a dermal plate, and a spike. The badly weathered remains were discovered in marine deposits near Ariyalur in the state of Tamil Nadu in South India. They were in 1979 named by P.M. Yadagiri and Krishnan Ayyasami as the type species Dravidosaurus blanfordi, the specific name honouring William Thomas Blanford.

Galton and Ayyasami (2017) reaffirmed the stegosaurian classification of Dravidosaurus, claiming the remains do not look like plesiosaurian pelvic and hindlimb elements.

It is situated approximately north from Easingwold. History The name probably derives from the Middle English 'hous', from Old English 'hus' meaning a house and thwaite - \\"a piece of land or land cleared of woods and converted to tillage\\". There has been a settlement on the site since before the Norman invasion. The village was served by the Thirsk and Malton Line at a station near the Elphin Bridge.

His work is noted for its \\"magical storytelling\\", for recurring themes such as the triumph of an outsider or survival, for characters' relationships with nature, and for vivid settings such as the Cornish coast or World War I. Morpurgo became the third Children's Laureate, from 2003 to 2005. Early life Morpurgo was born in 1943 in St Albans, Hertfordshire, as Michael Andrew Bridge, the second child of actor Tony Van Bridge and actress Kippe Cammaerts (born Catherine Noel Kippe Cammaerts, daughter of writer and poet √âmile Cammaerts). Both RADA graduates, his parents had met when they were acting in the same repertory company in 1938. His father came from a working-class family, while Kippe came from a family of actors, an opera singer, writers and poets. They were married in 1941 while Van Bridge, having been called up in 1939 and by then stationed in Scotland, was on leave from the army. Morpurgo's brother Pieter was born in 1942. When Morpurgo was born the following year, his father was stationed in Baghdad. While Van Bridge was away at war, Kippe Cammaerts met Jack Morpurgo (subsequently professor of American Literature at the University of Leeds from 1969‚Äì82The Daily Telegraph, Obituary, Published 16 October 2000). When Van Bridge returned to England in 1946, he and Cammaerts obtained a divorce and Cammaerts married Jack Morpurgo the same year. Although they were not formally adopted, Morpurgo and his brother took on their step-father's name. Morpurgo's older brother, Pieter Morpurgo, later became a BBC television producer and director. He has two younger siblings, Mark and Kay. Morpurgo's mother was frail, having suffered a breakdown when she was 19, and grieving the loss of her brother Pieter, who was killed in the war in 1941, for the rest of her life. Towards the end of her life she was an alcoholic. Morpurgo and his brother were evacuated to Northumberland when they were very young. After returning to London, the family lived at Philbeach Gardens, Earl's Court, where the children played in the bombsites. Morpurgo went to primary school at St Matthias, Earl's Court. The family later moved to Bradwell-on-Sea in Essex, where Morpurgo would live during the school holidays, having been sent to boarding school in Sussex when he was seven years old. The school was very strict and the boys were beaten frequently. During this period Morpurgo developed a stutter. His unhappy experiences at boarding school would later inform his novel The Butterfly Lion. After six years at The Abbey school in Ashurst Wood, Morpurgo then went to the King's School, an independent school in Canterbury, Kent, where he felt less homesick than at his previous school. Morpurgo did not learn who his biological father was until he was 19 years old. After the divorce from Michael's mother, Van Bridge had emigrated to Canada and was never talked about. Morpurgo never saw an image of his father until, while watching the 1962 CBC version of Great Expectations on TV with his mother, she recognised Van Bridge in the role of Magwitch and said to Michael \\"That's your father!\\". They met in person nine years later. Morpurgo's stepfather was not encouraging to his sons and was disappointed that they were not meeting his expectations for them of going into academia like him, calling Michael \\"a bear with very little brain.\\" His stepfather decided he should join the army and Morpurgo attended the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. He quickly realised that a soldier's life was not for him and left after nine months. Morpurgo later went to study at King's College London, reading English, French, and Philosophy, and graduated with a third class degree.\\"Richard Dimbleby Lecture\\", BBC One. 15 February 2011, retrieved 17 April 2011. He then joined the teaching profession with a job at Wickhambreaux Primary School in Canterbury, Kent. He also, from 1968, briefly taught at St. Faith's School in Cambridge. Personal life Aged 19, Morpurgo married Clare, eldest daughter of Sir Allen Lane, the founder of Penguin Books, in 1963.\\"Penguin, Puffin and the Paperback Revolution\\". BBC Four. 2 September 2010; retrieved 17 April 2011 They had met the previous year on holiday in Corfu through Morpurgo's stepfather, who was an editor at Penguin at the time. Clare was pregnant with their first child and Morpurgo has referred to it as a shotgun wedding. Their three children, Sebastian, Horatio and Rosalind, are all named after Shakespearian characters. Morpurgo was diagnosed with laryngeal cancer in 2017 and received radiotherapy. He has since recovered. Farms for City Children In 1976, Morpurgo and his wife Clare established the charity Farms for City Children, with the primary aim of providing children from inner city areas with experience of the countryside. The programme involves the children spending a week at a countryside farm, during which they take part in purposeful farmyard work.Farms for City Children webpage, farms4citychildren.co.uk; accessed 14 October 2015. The charity's first president was the couple's close friend and neighbour, Ted Hughes. About 85,000 children have taken part in the scheme since it was set up, and the charity now has three farms in Wales, Devon, Gloucestershire. Morpurgo has referred to the charity as his greatest achievement in life. Career =From teaching to writing novels= It was not until he was teaching in Kent that Morpurgo discovered his vocation in life, of which he later said \\"I could see there was magic in it for them, and realized there was magic in it for me.\\" Morpurgo's writing career was inspired by Ted Hughes' Poetry in the Making, Paul Gallico's The Snow Goose and Ernest Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea.\\"Michael Morpurgo,\\" The Guardian (US). 22 July 2008, retrieved 17 April 2011. Hughes and another poet, Se√°n Rafferty, were influential in his career, with Hughes becoming a friend, mentor and neighbour.

Prior to the 2015 general election, he was one of several celebrities who endorsed the parliamentary candidacy of the Green Party's Caroline Lucas. In 2016, he condemned government plans to extend grammar schools as divisive and ‚Äúquite deeply stupid‚Äù. In the run-up to the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, Morpurgo expressed his support for the European Union in an interview with the BBC, and reinforced this with a ten-minute BBC Radio 4 'Point of View' on 5 August 2018.

It is situated approximately south-west of Easingwold and north-west of York. History The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book as \\"Turulfestorp\\" and later as \\"Thoraldsthorp\\" and was probably a Viking settlement. The meaning of the name is Norse in origin for the hamlet of Thorald. To the west of the village is Ten Mile Hill, where human remains have been found, probably linked to the battle at nearby Myton in 1319. The remains of a Second World War air force station, RAF Tholthorpe is located nearby. The main units that were stationed there were from No. 6 Group RCAF, including No 77 Sqn; No 420 Sqn; No 425 Sqn No 431 Sqn and No 434 Sqn. Governance The village lies within the Thirsk and Malton Parliamentary constituency. It also lies within the Helperby ward of Hambleton District Council and the Easingwold electoral division of North Yorkshire County Council. Demography According to the 2001 UK Census, the village has a population of 269 in 88 households. Of the total population, 190 are over 16 years of age, of which 139 are economically active. Of the 88 households, 76 are owner occupied and 67 are detached dwellings. Geography The village is north-east of the River Ure covering about 1,700 acres. Derrings Beck flows to the north side of the village and joins Carle Beck to form the River Kyle. The local roads link the village with Raskelf and Helperby to the north, Myton-on-Swale to the west and Flawith and Tollerton to the south east. The East Coast Main Line railway lies to the east, though the nearest stations are either York or Thirsk. The soil varies in different locations around the village. On the west, it is fertile agricultural soil, whilst to the east it is clay and to the north is a mixture of sand and clay. Village amenities The village has one public house, the New Inn. There is an industrial park on Moor Lane and a business park on Hag Lane. There is a village hall situated on The Green next to the pond. The village is served by one bus route between Easingwold and York. Religion There is a small Wesleyian chapel in the village built in 1844 and restored in 1894.

This was the founding season of the Canadiens hockey club, which now is a franchise member of the National Hockey League (NHL). History On the idea of Jimmy Gardner of the Montreal Wanderers, Ambrose O'Brien set up the 'Les Canadiens' club as a francophone team created to attract fans away from the Montreal Le National of the rival Canadian Hockey Association and provide a local rivalry for the Wanderers. To manage the club, Gardner arranged for O'Brien to hire francophone Jack Laviolette who would manage and captain the club in its first season. =Transfer to Kennedy= Ambrose O'Brien, who owned three other NHA clubs intended from the start that the club would be transferred to \\"French sportsmen\\" as soon as possible to operate. The franchise was offered to the Montreal Le National upon the NHA taking in the Ottawa and Shamrocks teams, but Le National declined. One reason offered is that Le National was committed to the Montreal Arena, and Les Canadiens were signed up for the Jubilee Arena. The transfer to Kennedy occurred after the 1910 NHA season, when Georges Kennedy of Club Athletique Canadien threatened legal action against the NHA over the use of the 'Canadiens' name. There are conflicting accounts of the subsequent transfer to Kennedy. According to Coleman's book, the transfer was a purchase of the Haileybury Hockey Club. For $7,500, O'Brien granted Kennedy the NHA franchise and assets of the Haileybury Hockey Club and suspended the 'Les Canadiens' franchise. The reason for the transaction being structured this way is not explained. A possible reason is that a Montreal franchise could be worth more in a potential future sale, while Haileybury was exiting the NHA anyway. According to Andy O'Brien's book, Ambrose O'Brien himself is quoted as saying he sold the Canadiens to Kennedy \\"too soon\\", commenting on a 1967 sale of the Canadiens for millions of dollars. Another version of the events, as stated in Holzman's book is that Kennedy received the franchise for free, but had to pay $7,500 for Newsy Lalonde.Holzman (2002), p. 34. In Young's biography of Ambrose O'Brien, it is stated that the Canadiens name and players were transferred to Kennedy.Young (1967), p. 74. In any event, in the 1910‚Äì11 season manager Laviolette and the players of the 'Les Canadiens' team (and none of the Haileybury players) signed up with Kennedy. The Haileybury Hockey Club resumed play in the Temiscaming League. =O'Brien's exit= According to Coleman (1966), in 1911 O'Brien sold the suspended NHA franchise to Toronto interests who formed the Toronto Blueshirts club, starting play in the NHA in 1912. At the same time, he sold his Cobalt franchise to Quebec interests. In 1912, O'Brien left the hockey business completely, with the sale of the Renfrew Creamery Kings.

The remains (MIWG1997.550), consisting of assorted skull, axial skeleton and appendicular skeleton elements, from a juvenile or subadult, found in a plant debris clay bed, were described by Hutt et al. in early 2001. The etymology of the generic name refers to the animals classification as an early tyrannosaur or \\"tyrant lizard\\", while the specific name honors the discoverer of the fossil.  Description  Size of the holotype compared to a human A number of characters present in the holotypic specimen are unique to the genus. These include: The rostral end of dentary possessing a concave notch housing the most mesial alveolus and a dorsally-directed prong on the rostromesial margin of the notch, curving lateral furrows on the lateral surface of the dentary, a surangular with a hypertrophied gutter-like concavity near the rostrodorsal border, with the caudal end of the concavity containing foramina that perforate the body of the surangular, a low coronoid process on the surangular with a concave area located caudodorsally, and an ulna and radius with a tear-drop shaped cross-section at the mid-shaft. The holotypic specimen was disarticulated prior to fossilisation, with many elements of its skeleton scattered throughout the assemblage: none of the vertebral column is preserved in articulation and those vertebrae that are preserved consist of separated neural arches and centra, signifying that the holotype was an immature individual. Due to the relative low-quality preservation of many of the skeletal elements, numerous pieces discovered have been difficult to identify: these include unidentified cranial elements, as well as an ‚Äúulna‚Äù which has since been recognised as the distal part of the tibia. Before the proper identification of this fragment, Eotyrannus was reconstructed with much longer tibiae, which influenced the early reconstructions of the animal. Many of the characters also presented as unique to the genus in the diagnosis of Hutt et al. (2001) are in fact widespread throughout Tyrannosauroidea, for example the presence of 'serrated carinae on D-shaped premaxillary teeth' is far from unique to E. lengi. Furthermore, neither the presence of a laterally flattened rostral region to the maxilla nor a pronounced rim to the antorbital fossa are unique to the genus.Naish, D., 2006. The Osteology and Affinities of Eotyrannus lengi and Other Lower Cretaceous Theropod Dinosaurs From England. Unpublished Ph.D. Thesis, University of Portsmouth. The holotype of Eotyrannus is estimated to have measured about long and around 91-227 kg (200-500 lbs).  Discovery and naming  The exact location of the discovery of the holotype specimen has not been revealed due to its importance and the possibility of new material to be collected as the coastline recedes. From what is mentioned in the description, the specimen was found on the southwestern coast of the Isle of Wight, between Atherfield Point and Hanover Point. In 1995, local collector Gavin Leng brought a claw he had found along the coastline to Steve Hutt who worked at the old Museum of Isle of Wight Geology at Sandown. Gavin Leng revealed the location of where the claw was discovered, and over the next few weeks the site was carefully excavated, and the fossils removed in a hard matrix. Over the next few years the specimen was carefully researched with scientists from the University of Portsmouth, and with help from the Natural History Museum.Price, T. (2018, November 26). Eotyrannus lengi. Retrieved from http://www.dinosaurisle.com/eotyrannus.aspx Eventually in 2000 Eotyrannus was given its name along with its specific epithet in honour of Mr. Leng. The material was described briefly in 2001 by Hutt et al. In July 2018 Darren Naish, a colleague of Hutt who helped produce the preliminary description, created a GoFundMe fundraiser in order to release a monograph of the specimen, which received well over its goal. The monograph is to appear in Open Access venues.  Phylogeny  The discovery of Eotyrannus corroborates the notion that early tyrannosauroids were gracile with long forelimbs and three-fingered grasping hands, although the somewhat large size of the animal either means that early evolution for this clade was carried out at a large size or Eotyrannus developed large size independently. The find of this animal in Europe puts in question to the purported Asian origin for these animals along with North American Stokesosaurus and European Aviatyrannis arguing for a more complex biogeography for tyrannosauroids. Below is a cladogram by Loewen et al. in 2013 that includes most tyrannosauroid genera. A recent analysis has found Eotyrannus to be a megaraptoran closely related to taxa like Megaraptor (Porfiri et al., 2014).  Palaeoenvironment  Restoration of Eotyrannus chasing Hypsilophodon, with other dinosaurs from the Wessex Formation in the background The Wessex Formation, where Eotyrannus was found, was considered to have been warm and humid, similar to the present-day Mediterranean. However, there is evidence of a phase of increasing aridity during the late Barremian to early Aptian when Eotyrannus lived. In the Wessex Basin, sedimentological evidence, as well as fossils such as mud-cracks, suggests that the area experienced a warm, equable palaeoclimate with a mean annual temperature of 20‚Äì25 ¬∞C with low seasonal rainfall. Watson and Alvin (1996) and Allen (1998) showed that the Wessex Formation flora was both fire and drought resistant and suggested that it was adapted to a seasonal climate with periods of marked aridity. Evidence for a wet season is provided by the frequent occurrence of fungal decay in plant material from the plant debris beds.Sweetman, Steven & N. Insole, Allan. (2010). The plant debris beds of the Early Cretaceous (Barremian) Wessex Formation of the Isle of Wight, southern England: Their genesis and palaeontological significance. Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology. 292. 409-424. 10.1016/j.palaeo.2010.03.055. The Wessex Formation possessed a wide array of fauna, including many other dinosaurs such as the carcharodontosaurian Neovenator, the compsognathid Aristosuchus; the medium size spinosauridae Baryonx; the basal neornithischian Hypsilophodon; the ornithopods Iguanodon, Mantellisaurus, and Valdosaurus; the sauropods Ornithopsis, Eucamerotus, and Iuticosaurus; and the ankylosaur Polacanthus. There were many contemporary mammal species which Eotyrannus likely fed on, including the spalacotheriid Yaverlestes and the eobaatarid Eobaatar.

Station layout The temporary middle platform in 2016 This open-cut station, which opened on June 22, 1915, has four tracks and two side platforms. The two center express tracks are not normally used. The Coney Island-bound track has been disconnected from the line and the Manhattan-bound track is signaled for trains in both directions. Both platforms are carved into the Earth's crust with the concrete walls painted beige. Light green I-beam columns run along both platforms for the entire length with every other one having the standard black station name plate with white lettering. , all 3 tracks have been replaced with a new track bed and new track panels. From January 18, 2016 to May 22, 2017, the Manhattan-bound platform at this station was closed for renovations and a temporary wooden platform was placed over the Coney Island- bound express track for the Manhattan-bound service.  The Coney Island- bound platform was closed for a much longer period of time, from July 31, 2017 to July 1, 2019. During this time, all southbound trains used the northbound express track and the temporary platform, with short-turn W trains terminating here instead of their normal terminus at Gravesend-86th Street. =Exits= This station has two entrances/exits at either extreme ends, both of which are station houses on the overpass above the tracks. The full-time one is at the west (railroad north) end. It has a single staircase from platform, a crossover, and waiting area. Outside the turnstiles, there is a token booth before doors lead out to Bay Parkway and 66th Street. The station house is made of tile and stucco and built within other businesses. The other station house at the south end is made of patchwork and is un-staffed, containing just HEET turnstiles and exit-only turnstiles. Inside fare control, there is a waiting area, crossover, and one staircase to each platform. The doors outside fare control lead to Avenue O.

Sullivan (born October 3, 1954) is an American lawyer and politician who served as U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts (2001‚Äì2009) and Acting Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (2006‚Äì2009). His work as U.S. Attorney largely focused on national security and health-care fraud. A native of the Holbrook‚ÄìAbington region, Sullivan served earlier in his career as the District Attorney for Plymouth County, Massachusetts, and as a Republican member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives. Early life and career Sullivan was born October 3, 1954, the second of seven children, and grew up in Holbrook, Massachusetts. He attended Boston College High School and Boston College, and went onto Suffolk University Law School. He worked with the Gillette Company from 1973 to 1989 before moving into private law, becoming partner at McGovern & Sullivan in the early 1990s. Representing the town of Abington, he was elected as a Republican state representative in 1990. He was voted \\"Legislator of the Year\\" by the Massachusetts Municipal Organization in 1994. Among his initiatives was a budget amendment to have the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority charge municipalities for sewage management by volume instead of population, which moved much of the cost burden away from outlying towns and toward Boston. The amendment was adopted by the House but reversed the following day under pressure from Democratic leaders. He stepped down in 1995 after being named District Attorney for Plymouth County. He took early steps to run for the U.S. Senate against incumbent Ted Kennedy in 2000, but retracted before declaring an official candidacy. Tenure as U.S. Attorney Sullivan (second from left) is recognized by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in 2003 as part of the Boston Gun Violence Reduction Program. Sullivan was appointed U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts by President George W. Bush on September 14, 2001, in the wake of the September 11 attacks. His early work revolved around the terrorist attacks, which were launched from Boston's Logan Airport. Sullivan was the prosecutor in the 2001‚Äì2002 criminal trial of Richard Reid, widely known as the \\"Shoe Bomber\\". He prosecuted airport workers arrested at Logan Airport as part of \\"Operation Tarmac\\" accused of lying about their nationality on job applications. According to the Boston Phoenix, \\"every US attorney prosecuting Operation Tarmac cases [...] either reduced or dropped the charges\\" except for Sullivan, who wrote, \\"Ignoring the alleged criminal activity of illegal immigrants sends the wrong message to the rest of the world.\\" Within a few weeks of taking office, Sullivan organized a health-care fraud unit in his district and nearly tripled the number of prosecutors assigned to medical cases, prosecuting companies such as TAP Pharmaceuticals as well as smaller facilities and individual providers. He said: \\"You couldn't ignore this, even in light of 9/11.\\" He spoke before the U.S. House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security in support of the USA PATRIOT Act in May 2005, urging Congress to make the act's surveillance provisions permanent. Sullivan presented charges, in Boston, on November 23, 2005, against Abdullah Khadr, an Egyptian from Canada who is alleged to have sold arms to the Taliban. In February 2009, following the inauguration of President Barack Obama, Sullivan announced his intention to resign his position, following the customary practice of U.S. Attorneys, who typically do not retain their posts in a new administrations.  Tenure as ATF Director In 2006, Sullivan was made Acting Director of the ATF by President George W. Bush. The position had been made subject to the Senate confirmation process and Sullivan was the first nominee to be sent to the Senate. Bush nominated Sullivan to be permanent director in 2007, but the nomination was blocked by a Senate hold placed by Senators David Vitter (R-Louisiana), Michael Crapo (R-Idaho) and Larry E. Craig (R-Idaho). They expressed their concern that the ATF is hostile to small gun dealers, pursuing them overzealously for small paperwork infractions and driving law-abiding small retailers out of business. They said that Sullivan was indifferent to their concerns and \\"exhibits a lack of willingness to address these problems.\\" Sullivan has been criticized frequently by one such affected gun dealer, Ryan Horsley of Red‚Äôs Trading Post, Twin Falls, Idaho, Idaho's oldest gun dealership. Horsley says that the ATF has a long track record of abusive behavior and Sullivan, as Acting Director, continued to defend the ATF's abusive actions without any indication of making changes. Sullivan was a keynote speaker and special guest at the 2007 Great Lakes Summit on Gun Violence conference. This conference was organized by the International Association of Chiefs of Police and funded by a $375,000 grant from the Joyce Foundation.The Joyce Foundation The report of the conference was titled \\"Taking a Stand: Reducing Gun Violence in Our Communities\\" and called for the passage of several gun bans and gun control measures. The National Rifle Association has criticized the IACP report, calling it \\"a rubber stamp, bought and paid for, of the pre-existing agenda for gun ban groups.\\" The report was produced with assistance from the Joyce Foundation's Communications Director and with contributions from gun control advocates such as Kristen Rand and Tom Diaz of the Violence Policy Center. The NRA has called the Joyce Foundation an activist foundation whose \\"shadowy web of huge donations\\" leads \\"straight to puppet strings that control the agenda of gun ban groups\\". Sullivan's confirmation was opposed by gun rights groups such as the Gun Owners of America, Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms and Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership. The NRA did not categorically state its opposition to the confirmation of Mr. Sullivan but expressed its concern over the ATF's \\"overly restrictive legal interpretations\\" and \\"overly zealous enforcement activities\\". Sullivan resigned as Acting Director effective January 20, 2009 to make way for incoming President Barack Obama to name his own nominee. U.S. Senate election, 2013 Sullivan announced on February 14, that he would collect signatures to run for the Republican nomination in the 2013 special election to succeed John Kerry as U.S. Senator. He relied on volunteers rather than paid organizations to gather signatures. On February 27, he announced that he had gathered the requisite 10,000 signatures to appear on the primary ballot. He faced state Representative Dan Winslow and former U.S. Navy SEAL Gabriel Gomez in the April 30 primary. Sullivan was defeated in the primary by Gabriel E. Gomez who garnered 93,632, or 51% of the votes. Sullivan, gathered 66,164 votes, or 36%, whereas state Representative Dan Winslow, collected 24,057, or 13% of the votes, with 99 percent of precincts reporting shortly before 11:30 pm, on April 30, 2013. Sullivan later endorsed Gomez. Personal life Sullivan's residence is in Abington. He and his wife Terry have four children. He has been partner at The Ashcroft Group since 2009. His Daughter Alyson Sullivan is the State Representative for the 7th Plymouth District.

There have been a variety of legends associated with the creature in the oral literature. The notable one is related to the origin myth of the lake itself, while another legend narrates about a love story between female Seri Gumum and a male NƒÅga called Seri Kemboja that leads to the origin myth of Tioman and Lingga Islands. Origin myth of Chini Lake The most famous legends of Seri Gumum tell of a Jakun tribe who came to occupy the area where the lake is now. They were clearing the forest and making holes in the ground to plant crops. Suddenly, out of the forest came an old lady leaning on a walking stick, admonishing them of the fact that they didn't seek the permission of the spirits. She finally relented after the people apologized and later she planted her walking stick in the middle of the field to mark her territory and warned the group not to remove the stick. Sometime later, a dog began to bark endlessly at a rotting log on the edge of the clearing. One of the men threw his dibble stick at the log. Blood spurted out. As other men also began throwing more dibble sticks at the log, blood was gushing out and flowing away across the ground. Suddenly the sky was split with lightning, and thunder began to roll. The skies let loose a downpour of rain and everyone ran for cover. In the turmoil, the old woman's walking stick was knocked out of the ground. Immediately a fountain of water poured from the hole made by the stick. The water flowed for many years, thereby creating the Chini Lake. The tribe realized then that the log was actually a NƒÅga called ‚ÄòSeri Gumum‚Äô. A love tale In another version of the legend, it tells the origin of Seri Gumum who was a cursed princess that was sealed away in a Forbidden Garden built on the Lake. Many years later, a foreign prince called 'Putera Kemboja' arrived from afar and both fell in love. The princess eventually broke the seal containing her when she agreed to leave with the prince. As soon as they crossed the boundaries of the Forbidden Garden, Seri Gumum and Seri Kemboja immediately transformed into two NƒÅga. At the very moment, the Forbidden Garden was flooded, hidden forever at the bottom of Chini Lake. On dark nights, when the Pahang River was in flood, both NƒÅga would come out of the lake and go downstream. Villagers would hear thunder and lightning as they passed. One day, as the NƒÅga were swimming out into the South China Sea, Seri Gumum realized that she had forgotten her sash, so she swam back to the lake to get it. Seri Kemboja who was stronger and loved his new form, swam all the way to the open sea, thinking that Seri Gumum was trailing behind. Unfortunately, the lady NƒÅga swam too close to an island, Bukit Dato' and her sash got caught on a stone. While she was trying to get free, she heard the cock crow. She knew it was almost daylight and she could not go farther. She waited for a long time until her breath became so still that she slowly turned into an island. A little bird, the tiom, loved to rest on the island, and soon, the new island was called Tioman. Seri Kemboja who had swam on ahead also heard the cock crow. He immediately stopped too and he became the Lingga Island. Sightings Over the decades, there have been occasional reports of sightings, but as in the case of the Loch Ness Monster, these have never been scientifically proven. It was related that the ruler of Pahang would dream of the Naga whenever there was going to be a big flood that particular year. The native Jakun tribes still held the belief that the lake is the dwelling of a NƒÅga. Explorer Stewart Wavell visited Chini Lake in the 1960s, and was told of the ancient practice of human sacrifice to the NƒÅga around a great pillar of rock that rose up out of the waters. These were believed to pacify the NƒÅga. One of his guides, Che Yang, told him of a great flood that had come to Pekan a couple of years before. Many people had wondered if the NƒÅga was demanding sacrifice, even though the practice had been stopped generations ago. One day a girl out washing her clothes fell from her raft and was drowned. It was noticed that the waters immediately receded. The townsfolk believed the NƒÅga was now satisfied, having taken its victim. In May 1959, a British Engineer Arthur Potter, his clerk Baharuddin and two labourers named Lajan and Malik, all claimed to have seen a dragon-like creature at the lake. The sighting earned Mr. Potter the nickname 'Dragonwick'.

The word cyperus derives from the Greek , kyperos,. and rotundus is from Latin, meaning \\"round\\". The earliest attested form of the word cyperus is the Mycenaean Greek , ku-pa-ro, written in Linear B syllabic script. Cyperus rotundus is a perennial plant, that may reach a height of up to . The names \\"nut grass\\" and \\"nut sedge\\" ‚Äì shared with the related species Cyperus esculentus ‚Äì are derived from its tubers, that somewhat resemble nuts, although botanically they have nothing to do with nuts. As in other Cyperaceae, the leaves sprout in ranks of three from the base of the plant, around long. The flower stems have a triangular cross- section. The flower is bisexual and has three stamina and a three-stigma pistil, with the inflorescence having three to eight unequal spikes. The fruit is a three-angled achene. Young plants initially form white, fleshy rhizomes, up to in dimension, in chains. Some rhizomes grow upward in the soil, then form a bulb-like structure from which new shoots and roots grow, and from the new roots, new rhizomes grow. Other rhizomes grow horizontally or downward, and form dark reddish-brown tubers or chains of tubers. It prefers dry conditions, but will tolerate moist soils, and often grows in wastelands and in crop fields. History Cyperus rotundus L. subsp. rotundus, herbarium specimen isotype, 1839 C. rotundus was part of a set of starchy tuberous sedges that may have been eaten by Pliocene hominins. It was a staple of Aboriginal populations in Central Australia. Biomarkers and microscopic evidence of C. rotundus are present in human dental calculus found at the Al Khiday archaeological complex in central Sudan dating from before 6700 BC to the Meroitic pre-Islamic Kingdom of 300‚Äì400 AD. It is suggested that C. rotundus consumption may have contributed to the relatively low frequency of dental caries among the Meroitic population of Al Khiday because of its ability to inhibit Streptococcus mutans. C. rotundus was employed in ancient Egypt, Mycenean Greece, and elsewhere as an aromatic and to purify water. It was used by ancient Greek physicians Theophrastus, Pliny the Elder, and Dioscorides as both medicine and perfume. Uses Cyperus rotundus inflorescence, Kerala Flower stem showing triangular cross-section C. rotundus has many beneficial uses. It is a staple carbohydrate in tropical regions for recent hunter-gatherers and is a famine food in some agrarian cultures. =Folk medicine= In traditional Chinese medicine, C. rotundus is considered the primary qi-regulating herb. The plant is mentioned in the ancient Indian ayurvedic medicine Charaka Samhita (circa 100 AD). Modern ayurvedic medicine uses the plant, known as musta or musta moola churna, for fevers, digestive system disorders, dysmenorrhea, and other maladies. Arabs of the Levant traditionally use roasted tubers, while they are still hot, or hot ashes from burned tubers, for wounds, bruises, and carbuncles. Western and Islamic herbalists including Dioscorides, Galen, Serapion, Paulus Aegineta, Avicenna, Rhazes, and Charles Alston have described its use as a stomachic, emmenagogue, and deobstruent, and in emollient plasters. The antibacterial properties of the tubers may have helped prevent tooth decay in people who lived in Sudan 2000 years ago. Less than 1% of that local population's teeth had cavities, abscesses, or other signs of tooth decay, though those people were probably farmers (early farmers' teeth typically had more tooth decay than those of hunter-gatherers because the high grain content in their diet created a hospitable environment for bacteria that flourish in the human mouth, excreting acids that eat away at the teeth). =Modern uses and studies= Several chemical substances have been identified in C. rotundus: cadalene, cyprotene, flavonoids, sesquiterpenes, terpenoids, mustakone, isocyperol, acyperone, rotundene, valecine, kaempferol, luteolin, quercetin, patchoulenone, isopatchoulenone, sugeonyl acetate, cellulose triacetate and sugebiol. A sesquiterpene, rotundone, so called because it was originally extracted from the tuber of this plant, is responsible for the spicy aroma of black pepper and the peppery taste of certain Australian Shiraz wines. Extract from leaves and tubers of Cyperus rotundus L. increase the adventitious rooting of different species. These extracts contain a large amount of auxins and phenolic compounds that promote the rooting of cuttings and seedlings. =Food= A Cyperus rotundus tuber, approximately 20 mm long Despite the bitter taste of the tubers, they are edible and have nutritional value. Some part of the plant was eaten by humans between Mesolithic and Neolithic periods. The plant has a high amount of carbohydrates. The plant is eaten in Africa in famine-stricken areas. In addition, the tubers are an important nutritional source of minerals and trace elements for migrating birds such as cranes. =Sleeping mats= The well dried coco grass is used in mats for sleeping. Invasive problems and eradication A cross section through the flower stem Cyperus rotundus is one of the most invasive weeds known, having spread out to a worldwide distribution in tropical and temperate regions. It has been called \\"the world's worst weed\\" as it is known as a weed in over 90 countries, and infests over 50 crops worldwide. In the United States it occurs from Florida north to New York and Minnesota and west to California and most of the states in between. In the uplands of Cambodia, it is described as an important agricultural weed. Its existence in a field significantly reduces crop yield, both because it is a tough competitor for ground resources, and because it is allelopathic, the roots releasing substances harmful to other plants. Similarly, it also has a bad effect on ornamental gardening. The difficulty to control it is a result of its intensive system of underground tubers, and its resistance to most herbicides. It is also one of the few weeds that cannot be stopped with plastic mulch. Cyperus rotundus emerging through plastic mulching Weed pulling in gardens usually results in breakage of roots, leaving tubers in the ground from which new plants emerge quickly. Ploughing distributes the tubers in the field, worsening the infestation; even if the plough cuts up the tubers to pieces, new plants can still grow from them. In addition, the tubers can survive harsh conditions, further contributing to the difficulty to eradicate the plant. Hoeing in traditional agriculture of South East Asia does not remove the plant but leads to rapid regrowth. Most herbicides may kill the plant's leaves, but most have no effect on the root system and the tubers. Glyphosate will kill some of the tubers (along with most other plants) and repeated application can be successful. Halosulfuron- methyl will control nut grass after repeated applications without damaging lawns.Nutgrass ‚Äì a tough little nut to crack, January 2016 The plant does not tolerate shading and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) slows its growth in pastures and mulch crops.

It replaced the previous Twelve Men and was followed by the Nine Men. Council In 1643 Abraham Pietersen Van Deusen who had served on the council of twelve men was appointed to a new council of eight men. The council contacted the States-General and blamed governor Willem Kieft for the declining economic condition of the nascent colony, and the war with the Native Americans. They requested that a new Director-General of New Netherland be appointed and that the people themselves be given more influence in the new government. Director General Kieft was dismissed, and Peter Stuyvesant took his place and Stuyvesant remained in power until the colony was turned over to the British in 1664.

The vehicle was developed as a joint project between Optare and DAF; it was based on the designs of the successful MCW Metrobus which had been jointly purchased by DAF and Optare, . but they are by no means a restlyed Metrobus. With the launch of the DB250LF chassis sometime after production commenced, the Spectra was built to low-floor specification, and was one of the first low-floor double-decker buses available in the United Kingdom. The design is notable for the exclusion of a lower deck rear window, a practice that has become more commonplace. The bus typically seated 47 on the upper deck and 28 on the lower deck in single-door format. Operations Reading Buses Optare Spectra bodied DAF DB250 rear in Ryde in June 2012 A large batch was supplied to Reading Buses, including the first production model (fleet number 701), all of which have now been sold, with 701 & 721 being preserved. London Central also received a batch of 24 of these, with a single door arrangement. East London received one example which had a dual door layout. Several were built for Turkey, with 26 new to IETT, Istanbul, and 5 going to ƒ∞zula≈ü, ƒ∞zmir. =Low floor examples= R222 AJP, the first low floor double deck bus to enter service in the UK The first completed low-floor Spectra was received by National Express in January 1998, R1 NEG, body Number 8620. However, the first low floor example of the Optare Spectra to enter service was with Peters, Bristol, more commonly known as Abus, at 0650 on Wednesday 4 February 1998. This saw R222 AJP becoming the first low floor fully accessible double deck bus to enter service in Great Britain. It was only by chance that Peters found out that West Midlands were planning to launch their Spectra at midday the following day, when he went to pick up the Spectra from Arriva Bus & Coach, allowing it to be prepared and be ready for service the following morning. The bus was destroyed by fire in 2015. National Express received the first two low-floor Spectras in 1998, allocating one to Travel West Midlands and one to Travel Dundee, with registrations of R1 NEG & R2 NEG, their original fleet numbers being 1 & 2. They entered service on 15 January 1998, with branding reading Britain's first \\"Low Floor Low Emissions Easy Access Double Decker\\" and Scotland's first \\"Low Floor Low Emissions Easy Access Double Decker\\" A batch of 20 buses were purchased in 1999, and allocated to Travel West Midlands, to upgrade route 50 (Birmingham - Druids Heath) from Scania N113DRB operation. R2 NEG was also transferred to Travel West Midlands in August 1999 so all the National Express' Spectras were operated by Travel West Midlands, where 1 & 2 were re-numbered 4001 & 4002 to give them the same fleet numbers as the rest of the Spectras. They were replaced on the 50 in late 2001 by Volvo B7TL/Alexander ALX400s. They were transferred to Wolverhampton in the summer of 2009, to replace the final MCW Metrobuses allocated there, and were operated on various routes across the city, with the new NXWM livery and digital destination blinds. All examples in the fleet have now been withdrawn (September 2016) with 4014 (T414 UON) destroyed by fire in 2001. After 17 years of service, R1 NEG (4001) was donated to the Transport Museum, Wythall on 19 June 2015.

Life He was born in Amsterdam in a rich merchant family - his father, Reinier Pauw (1564‚Äì1636) wasn't only a merchant, but also a Mayor of Amsterdam - and studied law in Leiden. He was the pensionary of Amsterdam from 1611 to 1627. In 1620 he bought the town of Heemstede and was called 'Lord of Heemstede'. He bought a few rare tulips during Tulip Mania and planted them in his garden surrounded by several mirrors positioned strategically to fully reflect the flowers' beauty. He was appointed grand pensionary in 1631. Pauw, Holland and Amsterdam wanted an alliance with Spain, but Prince Frederick Henry of Orange wanted an alliance with France. Frederick Henry sent Pauw to France to start an alliance against Spain. Pauw accepted this assignment and allied with France. He resigned in 1636 as grand pensionary.

He is a contemporary member of the underground indie rock and indie folk musical scenes, and his influences range from older indie artists such as Neutral Milk Hotel, Elliott Smith and Pavement to more mainstream and well known acts such as Nirvana and Bob Dylan. In 2013, Kevin Devine rejoined his previous band, Miracle of 86, for a series of reunion shows. History =Beginnings= Kevin Devine grew up in Brooklyn and Staten Island and has spent significant time in Manhattan and Queens. Devine graduated from Fordham University at Lincoln Center in 2001, majoring in journalism. He first played in the band Delusion, which later changed its name to Miracle of 86 (referring to the 1986 New York Mets). At Fordham he was able to hone his solo, acoustic style by playing at various open-mic and college events. Devine released his first solo album, entitled Circle Gets the Square, in 2002 under the record label Immigrant Sun Records, as well as being produced by Bill Manoudakis. During this time he also appeared in regular stints at the Wetlands Preserve venue in New York City. His brother, Dan Devine, is a columnist for The Ringer. =Increased success (2002‚Äì2007)= Although still relatively unknown, Devine gained some popularity with his 2003 album, Make the Clocks Move. This album's songs reflect Devine's political views and a growing introspective style, inspired by recent death of his father to a stroke. These two styles would become a staple in Devine's music that followed. It is the first of two albums released on Triple Crown Records. It is also the first of three albums produced by Chris Bracco and Mike Skinner (ex-Miracle of 86). In 2005, Devine released his third full-length album, Split the Country, Split the Street. He signed with Capitol Records, who released his fourth album, Put Your Ghost to Rest, on October 17, 2006. Only four months after his major label debut, Devine was dropped from Capitol Records due to EMI merging Virgin and Capitol Records. Devine was able to gather a strong fan base as a result of his exposure through touring with Brand New (who were also formerly signed to Triple Crown Records). First appearing as their opening act on their 2004 spring tour, Devine made a small splash among their fan base; however, opening for them again in April 2006 and joining their 2007 Spring tour with Manchester Orchestra greatly increased his fan base and affected his career. Devine also toured solo with Jesse Lacey of Brand New and singer-songwriter Grace Read. =Brother's Blood and Bad Books (2008‚Äì2010)= After negotiations with Capitol Records, Put Your Ghost To Rest was re-released on April 20, 2008 by Procrastinate! Music Traitors. Several new demos were featured on Devine's MySpace page around this time. A majority of the demos would later be properly featured on Brother's Blood and a single for \\"Another Bag of Bones\\" was released in August 2008. The tours throughout 2008 were in support of both the Put Your Ghost To Rest re-release and his new material. In December 2008, Devine announced in an interview with Popwreckoning that his new album Brother's Blood would be released on April 28 on Favorite Gentlemen records. He also announced a tour with Manchester Orchestra and the release of the I Could Be With Anyone EP in support of the upcoming album.PRE-ORDER \\"BROTHER'S BLOOD\\" He toured extensively in 2009‚Äì2010 for Brother's Blood, including dates with Manchester Orchestra, Brand New, Thrice, and Nada Surf. He also played a number of major music festivals, including Coachella, Lollapalooza, The Bamboozle and Bonnaroo. On July 6, 2010, Devine released the She Stayed As Steam EP, featuring outtakes from Brother's Blood. In an interview with Manchester Orchestra's Andy Hull, Hull confirmed that Manchester Orchestra and Kevin Devine would be releasing a split EP entitled \\"I Could Be The Only One\\".10 Questions with Andy Hull, front-man of Manchester Orchestra He later confirmed in a January 2010 interview with AbsolutePunk that Manchester Orchestra and Devine had finished a currently untitled album featuring eight songs, with four songs written by Devine and the other four written by Hull.Kevin Devine ‚Äì Press Record Online The album was to be released under the band name Bad Books. In August 2010, the band officially announced their self-titled debut album Bad Books would be released on October 19, 2010. A 4-date east coast tour in support of the album was also announced.Tour Another short acoustic tour followed in December 2010, with only Kevin Devine and Manchester Orchestra frontman Andy Hull playing Bad Books songs, as well as solo songs. =Between the Concrete and Clouds (2010‚Äì2012)= On August 26, 2010, Devine announced on his Facebook page that he had begun writing his sixth album. A post made on his Facebook page also revealed tentative song titles which included \\"Between the concrete & clouds,\\" \\"The first hit,\\" \\"Off-screen,\\" \\"A story, a sneak,\\" \\"The city has left you,\\" \\"11‚Äì17,\\" \\"I used to be someone,\\" \\"Sleepwalking through my life,\\" \\"Wait out the wreck,\\" and \\"Merry Levov\\". (The song \\"Merry Levov\\" was possibly renamed \\"Awake in the dirt\\", as it does not appear on the album yet would explain the lyrical content of the later renaming.) Several rough draft lyrics of these songs were added to his Facebook notes page. Recording was completed on March 6, 2011. Between the Concrete and the Clouds is the first record made by Devine that is fully backed by a band, featuring musicians Brian Bonz (keyboard), Chris Bracco (a.k.a. Plosive) (bass, keyboard), Mike Fadem (drums, percussion), Russell Smith (electric guitar), and Mike Strandberg (guitar, mandolin). It was recorded in 10 days over a span of a month, produced by longtime collaborator Chris Bracco and mixed by Rob Schnapf. In March 2011 Devine toured with River City Extension, and released a split 7\\" EP. Devine's songs on the EP are an acoustic version of \\"Between the Concrete and Clouds\\" and \\"Walls\\", a Tom Petty cover. Two 7\\" singles, \\"Luxembourg\\" and \\"Part of the Whole\\", were released on May 17, with the album Between the Concrete and Clouds to follow later in the year. During an Alt Press interview on July 6, 2011, Between The Concrete and the Clouds was officially announced for a September 13, 2011 release in the US on Razor & Tie/Favorite Gentlemen Records.

Limited (), also known as Pak Steels, is a producer of long rolled steel and heavy metal products and entities in the country. Headquartered in Karachi, Sindh Province of Pakistan, the PSM is the current largest industrial mega-corporation, having a production capacity of 1.1‚Äì5.0 million tonnes of steel and iron foundries. Built with the contributions of the Soviet Union in the 1970s, it is the largest industrial mega-corporation complex, vastly expanded in an enormous dimensions construction inputs, involving the use of 1.29Mn cubic meters of concrete and 5.70Mn cubic meters of earth work, and containing ~330,000 tonnes of heavy machinery, steel structures and electrical equipment. A controversial attempt was made to privatize the steel mills to global private ownership under a counter-measure Privatization Programme of Prime minister Shaukat Aziz. All attempts were thwarted by the Supreme Court which launched a full-fledged investigation against the attempts to privatize as private sector and lost the control of the steel mills in a matter of weeks. In spite of its enormous size and expansion, only 18% of the capacity was in use and the steel mills requested a bailout plan of Rs.12 billion to prevent its closure;Kiani, Khaleeq. \\"Pakistan Steel in dire straits; liability Rs110bn.\\" DAWN Media Group, 19 September 2011. the bailout plan was dismissed by the government. Finally, the steel mills was brought back to government-ownership management under an inverse counter-measure Nationalization Programme of Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani. Since then, its operational plant capacity has reached 30%‚Äî50% after seeking the government financial assistance. The Govt of Pakistan has decided to layoff 9,350 employees of Pakistan Steel Mills.  History After the creation of Pakistan in 1947, the Government of Prime minister Liaquat Ali Khan realized the importance of local production of iron and steel. Initially, the dependence on imports caused economical setbacks to the state in the form of high import cost. The initial idea and studies were conceived by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (PCSIR) and put forward the concept to the Five-Year Plans of Pakistan (1955‚Äì1960). In 1956, Soviet premier Nikolai Bulganin offered technical and scientific assistance to Prime Minister Suhrawardy regarding the steel mills and expressing interests in establishing the country's first steel mills. The project was comprehensively debated in the governments of Prime Minister Huseyn Suhravardy and President Ayub Khan. The manufacturing process, supply sources of the requisite machinery and raw materials, plant site, domestic ore versus imported ore, ownership pattern, product mix and all foreign financing credit kept the project on hold for a considerable time. After 20 years of policy development and studies of PCSIR, President General Yahya Khan gave the approval of the recommendations of the state-owned scientific think tank, the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research. Bureaucrats and scientists agreed upon a unified decision that the \\"Karachi Steel Project\\" would be sponsored in the state-public sector, under which a separate corporation sanctioned by the Companies Act, would be formed. In pursuance of this decision, the Pakistan Steel Mills Corporation Limited (PSM Ltd.) was commissioned and incorporated as a private limited company in a public sector in accordance with the Companies Act of 1913, to be established in Karachi, Sindh Province of Pakistan. Contacts were made with the United States but the U.S. government showed lack of ambition and interest in the project; therefore the studies were sent to the Soviet Union, which took the initiatives. The United States refused to give any kind of assistance. Finally, an agreement was reached with the V/O Tyaz Promexport of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) in January 1969. In 1971, Pakistan and Soviet Union finally proceeded to enter into a government agreement, upon which, the Soviet Union agreed to provide techno-financial assistance for the construction of a coastal based integrated steel mill at Karachi. =Labour development= Pakistan Steel Mills listing with the nation capable to produce steel (10-50Mn tonnes of steel) and iron foundries locally In 1956, the Krupp industries of West Germany offered to set up a steel mill based on Kalabagh iron ore, coal and most other minerals available within about . The project was dismissed by the Ministry of Energy led by its minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto who accepted the Soviet studies instead as Bhutto favored the idea to establish one single enormous steel mill based 100% imported steel and iron ore instead of local ore at Kalabagh District. In June 1966, another West German steel firm, the Salzgitter AG, produced ~5,000 tonnes of quality steel from 15,000 tonnes of Kalabagh iron ore in the presence of some international experts, and sold it to Volkswagen. The company offered in August 1967 to set up Kalabagh Steel Mill of over 0.8 million tonnes per year capacity based on Kalabagh iron ore and imported coal at an estimated cost of Rs. 1.55Bn, including a foreign exchange cost of Rs. 878Mn. The European banks offered loans for this project, which confirms technical and financial viability of the project. All attempts were dismissed after projects were politicized enough in the civil bureaucracy. The Pakistan Steel Mills was established as an integrated steel mill under a programme called Nationalization programme in the 1970s. The foundation stone for this gigantic integrated project was laid on 30 December 1973 by Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. The mammoth construction and erection work of the integrated steel mill, never experienced before in the country, was carried out by a consortium of Pakistan construction corporations under the supervision of Soviet and Pakistani experts. Khaja Inayath Ullah was the Director Operations & Chief engineer of this project. (Blast furnace 1&2 & RMPP) The main production units were constructed with a host of infrastructure facilities involving unprecedented volumes of work and expertise. Component units of the steel mill numbering over twenty and each a big enough factory in its own right were commissioned as they were completed between April 1981 to August 1985, with the coke ovens and byproducts plant coming online first and the galvanizing unit last. The commissioning of Blast Furnace Number 1 on 14 August 1981 marked Pakistan's entry into the elite club of iron and steel producing nations. The project was completed at a capital cost of Rs. 24.7Mn. The completion of the steel mill was formally launched by President General Zia-ul-Haq on 15 January 1985. Soviet scientist Dr. Mikhail Koltokof flew to Pakistan and settled in the country to provide training to Pakistan's technical staff. Engineer Niaz Muhammad and materials scientist Wahab siddiqui received training in Soviet Russian and trained thousands of scientists and technical staff. Their inspirations and innovations led them to earn the highest award from Pakistan, and also from Soviet Union. The Government of Pakistan conferred them with Pride of Performance. Dividends and business assets Pakistan Steel Mills not only had to construct the main production units for 2.2 MTPY, but also a host of infrastructure facilities involving unprecedented volumes of work and expertise. Component units of the steel mills numbering over twenty, and each a big enough factory in its own right, were commissioned as they were completed between 1981 and 1985, with the Coke Oven and Byproduct Plant coming on stream first and the Galvanizing Unit last. Commissioning of Blast Furnace No.1 on 14 August 1981 marked Pakistan's entry into the elite club of iron and steel producing nations. The project was not completed at a capital cost of Rs. 24,700 million and commissioned for production of 1.1 MTPY. Due to its infrastructure and enormous expansion capacity, it is difficult to determine the current value of assets of Pakistan Steel Mills, while others approximating the business assets reaching to then range from Rs. 72.5Bn to Rs. 100Bn of total value. By estimating, including the heavy machinery, dividends, facilities, and external and internal assets, the market price of the land of the Steel mills are exceeding to the amount of Rs. 125.5Bn, as per the government estimates against the market value of Rs 945 billion as on 2006 investigation by a potential bidders who was withdrew from the bidding process for reason not known. The completion of the steel mill was forced to stop due to liquidity crises and formally launched after 12 years by the then-President of Pakistan General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq on 15 January 1985. Pakistan Steel today is the country's largest industrial undertaking, having a production capacity of 1.1 million tonnes of steel and not completed to its lay-out design of 2.2 MTPY in a period of 40 years (1973 to 2013). Headquarters and production expansion Pakistan Steel Mills are one of the enormous and gigantically expanded industrial complex in the country that is located at a distance of 40 km Southeast of Karachi at Bin Qasim near Port Muhammad Bin Qasim. It was found to be an ecologically preferable location, alongside a tidal creek and having a wind direction away from the city of Karachi. Pakistan Steel Mills is spread out over an area of (about ) including for the main plant, for the township and for the 110 MG water reservoir. In addition it has leasehold rights over an area of for the quarries of limestone and dolomite in the Makli and Jhimpir areas of Thatta district. It is one of the largest industrial complex in Pakistan as well as in South Asia and due to its enormous expansion, the steel mill has its own educational facilities (see Pakistan Steel Cadet College and Pakistan Steel Institute of Technology), housing and residential programmes, parks and recreation facilities and police services apart from the provisional authorities.  Environmental records Steel Town. Due to its importance, the steel mills followed a strict environmental policies regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of the Ministry of Environment (MoE). All health safety and healthy working environment continuously regulated under a designed system. Pakistan Steel Mills, besides its core activities, has done a lot in making the environment in and around Pakistan Steel green and beautiful through the addition of three unique projects; the Quaid-I-Azam Park; The Quaid-I-Azam Cricket Park; and the Quaid-I-Azam Beach. The Quaid-I- Azam Park, which spreads out over an area of , consists of a series of six interconnected lakes, lush green lawns and grassy terraces, colorful flower beds, fountains, life-size steel-made models of wild and marine animals, a jogging track, a bird sanctuary and mini-zoo, as well as a children's play and recreational ground and boating facilities. The steel mills also active in sports development and also has a football team Pakistan Steel FC that currently competes in the Pakistan Premier League. Privatization of steel mills Since its foundation, the steel mills has been under the management of government-ownership and strictly put under the close coordination of civil bureaucracy. In 2006, Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz decided to integrate the steel mills under the intensified programme, called the Privatization Programme. When the news reached to the country, amid demonstration and spontaneous protest began to take place against the government of Shaukat Aziz and sparked lengthy debates in parliament, which members of the opposition walked out of in disgust. The consortium involving Saudi Arabia-based Al Tuwairqi Group of Companies submitted a winning bid of $362 million for a 75% stake in Pakistan Steel Mills at an open auction held in Islamabad. The consortium including the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works (Russia); the al- Tuwairqi Group of Companies (Saudi Arabia); and the Arif Habib Securities (Pakistan) paid a total Rs. 21.6 billion ($362 million), or Rs. 16.8 per share, to take control of Pakistan's largest steel manufacturing plant. Tuwairqi Group of Companies, one of the Leading business concerns in Saudi Arabia, also launched a $300 million steel mills project at Bin Qasim. The group will set up Tuwairqi Steel Mills (TSM), a state-of-the-art steel-making plant in the southern port city of Gawadar, Pakistan. =Controversies= The entire privatization programme of prime minister Shaukat Aziz came to halt when WATAN PARTY filed a petition under section 184 (3) through its Chairman Barrister Zafarullah Khan in the Supreme Court of Pakistan vide SMC No. 9/2006 against the privatization citing irregularities in the process which was accepted by the Chief Justice of Pakistan Justice Iftikhar Chaudry. The Supreme Court on 8 August 2006 held that the entire disinvestment process of the Pakistan Steel Mills reflected a haste, ignoring profitability aspect and assets of the mills by the financial adviser before its evaluation. The transaction was the outcome of a process reflecting procedural irregularities, said the 80-page judgement in the PSM case. On 23 June, a nine-member bench of the Supreme Court had annulled the sale of the country's largest industrial unit to a three-party consortium and had directed the government to refer the matter to the Council of Common Interests (CCI) within six weeks. It had declared the $362 million transaction with the Russian-Saudi-Pakistan investors as null and void. Authored by Chief Justice of Pakistan Justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry, the judgement said the entire exercise reflected a haste by the Privatisation Commission (PC) and the Competitive Committee on Privatisation (CCP). The PC had processed 30 March final report of the financial adviser the same day and a meeting of the PC board and a summary had also been prepared the same day when a six-week time was mandatory to examine and fix a fair reference price for approval by the CCOP. Nationalization The privatization had the disastrous effects on steel mills, and it was lost by the private sector due to their inability to run such giant large-scale operations of steel mills. Under private sector, the steel suffered loss in its net worth and declining of producing capacity of the steel mill. The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) was forced to approved a bail out package after the private sector, the Tuwairqi Steel Mills pulled off its investment from steel mills instead established another steel mill industry to compete against the steel mill. Despite all its problems, the steel mills is a paradigmatic employer and would rather see itself run into the ground than mistreat its long standing employees. In the midst of all the troubles that it is facing, the mill started issuing letters confirming their jobs and start producing the heavy steel and iron materials. After leading to an infernally long protest and inability proved by the private sector, the government of Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani activated the nationalization programme after accepting the recommendations, despite protest lodged by the Finance minister Abdul Hafeez Shaikh. In 2011, the steel mill was put under the management of government-ownership, expanded and re-structured the board of directors would be restructured and expanded, from the current nine to twelve members as well as approving another bail out plan. In matter of weeks, the private-sector voluntarily handed over the operations of steel mills to government-ownership management, a move that was widely appreciated in the public society and workers' unions. Since under the government-ownership, the steel mills infrastructure and available capacity was restructured and expanded. In 2012, Ukraine announced to provide the technological development and help in restoration of raw materials supply chain after viewing the performance of steel mills. The Ukrainian Ambassador quoted, \\"for major operational units of Pakistan Steel Mills is remarkable\\". The Ambassador of Ukraine Volodymyr Lakomov said that Ukraine is keen to make business relationship with Pakistan and the steel mill PSM will be a \\"symbol of friendship\\" between the two countries.

Following the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the early 1990s, Bosniaks reinvigorated the (by then) archaic term Bo≈°njaci - Bosniaks - for their national name, based on the word's historical ethno-geographic connotations.When Ethnicity Did Not Matter in the Balkans: A Study of Identity in Pre-Nationalist Croatia, Dalmatia, and Slavonia in the Medieval and Early- Modern Periods See also *Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Middle Ages *Ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina References Bosniak history Medieval Bosnia and Herzegovina Ethnonyms ","title":"Bo≈°njani"},{"id":"3513129","text":"Athirampuzha is a town in Kottayam district of Kerala state, South India. It is famous because the Mahatma Gandhi University is situated here. Athirampuzha is situated 10 km north of Kottayam town, 3 km from Ettumanoor and from Main Central Road S.H.1 of Kerala. History It is believed that Athirampuzha was a well-established developed village and settlements where there even at AD 1200. The famous traveler Marco Polo's travel descriptions, \\"The description of the world\\", have some references about ‡¥Ö‡¥§‡¥ø‡¥∞‡¥Æ‡µç‡¥™‡µÅ‡¥¥. While he was traveling through Kerala he reached a port town called 'athiramkari'. The description of this place closely matches to ‡¥Ö‡¥§‡¥ø‡¥∞‡¥Æ‡µç‡¥™‡µÅ‡¥¥. According to Marco Polo Athiramkari was a trade center famous for Pottery, Cattle's, vegetable market (‡¥ö‡¥®‡µç‡¥§) (still exists) and clothes. 'Chantha Kulam (‡¥ö‡¥®‡µç‡¥§‡¥ï‡µÅ‡¥≥‡¥Ç)' was the center of trade where boats could dock. It is believed that mappilas (Christians) and Hindus (nairs) where settled in Athirampuzha during that period. Athirampuzha remained as a famous port town till the mid 1900s. Later more roads where developed which reduced the importance of backwater trade routes. The old boat shed (renovated later) still exists near the Chantha kulam. The nearest rail head is Ettumanoor Railway Station just 1.5 km from Athirampuzha. Luka Mathai Plathottam(1888-1968) introduced homeopathy to Athirampuzha. He published many books including Varthamanappusthakam in 1936. (This entitles as the first travelogue in any Indian language). He was the Managing Director Plathottathil PVT LTD.(a company which was registered according to the norms of East India Company, used to pay income tax to British government and dealt with cotton handlooms in a large scale) .Justice K.K. Mathew Kuttyil, Post Master General of India and First Malayalee Postal board member C J Mathew Chackalackal, Deepika Daily Chief Editor K.M. Joseph Karivelil,K.M Joseph Kalarickal formal Central Fisheries commissioner, Dr. TJ Sebastian were some of the prominent people from Athirampuzha. Economy It is one of the oldest trading centers in Travancore. The place is believed to have trade relations with Middle East from centuries ago. Mahatma Gandhi University is located in Athirampuzha. Kuriakose Elias College, Mannanam, Amalagiri B.K. College, Ettumanoor I.T.I., SNV L.P School Mannanam, St. Aloysious School, St. Marys School, St. Ephrems Higher Secondary School Mannanam, K.E. School Mannanam, St. Gregorious U.P.School Mannarkunnu, Government L.P. School Sreekandamangalam etc. are located in Athirampuzha Panchayat.  Religion  Christianity is the predominant religion in the Athirampuzha region, followed by Hinduism and Islam. The St. Mary's Church at Athirampuzha is one of the oldest in Kerala. The Venmanatoor Sri Krishna Swami Temple (‡¥§‡µÉ‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ï‡µá‡µΩ) is situated in Athirampuzha. The famous Vedhagiri hill is a Hindu pilgrim center located in the ward 1 of Athirampuzha panchayath. It is believed that the pandavas (MahƒÅbhƒÅrata) visited the vyasa during their exile life. Remnants of the monastery are seen on the top of a small hill called vedhagirimala. Hindus often visit the place and pray for their forefathers at the temple (Sri Dharma Shastha Kshethram) and have a snanam (holy bath) at the pond near the temple. Charis Bhavan, a well-known MSFS charismatic retreat center also located in Athirampuzha. The Ettumanoor Mahadevar Temple is situated near Athirampuzha. Also there are multiple small Hindu temples and mosques in different parts of Athirampuzha.  St. Mary's Forane Church  St. Mary's Forane Church of Athirampuzha, altar The forane church of Athirampuzha, a world renowned pilgrim centre of St.Sebastian is dedicated to Blessed Virgin Mary. This church about 10 km from Kottayam has been the hub of Christian life in and around central Kerala from early 9th century. This is one of the biggest parishes of the Syro-Malabar Catholic Archeparchy of Changanassery. It consists of almost 2500 families and the total number of the faithful exceeds 10000. = History = Athirampuzha church must trace back her history to the Ettonnussery Illam which was the power centre of the local kingdom. It is said that the Namboodiri of this Illam donated the land to build a church in the name of blessed virgin Mary as a token of gratitude on the Miraculous birth of his son. The Church was blessed on August 15th 835 AD. Gradually it became an independent church and later was elevated to the status of a forane in 1929. The church also witnessed many historical events like the historic journey of Mar Abraham Karivatti and paremakkal Thoma Kathanar to Rome, the All India Eucharistic congress-the first and the last of its kind in Kerala conducted from 8 th to 15th May 1929. = Ancient Monuments = The Church is an exemplary specimen of ancient architecture. There were ancient stones with engravings and Thaliyollas in ‚ÄòNanam Moonam‚Äô alphabet kept in the church. Here there is a good collection of objects of historic, Artistic, Archival, Archaeological and anthropological interest in granite, wood, metal, ivory, including Granite cross, Altar, Bells, Articles used in holy Qurbana ...etc. = Valiapally = The present church was constructed during the time of Fr. Joseph Ithiparambil. The renovation began in 1962 and was consecrated by Mar Mathew Kavukattu, the Archbishop of Changanachery in 1966. The church, brilliantly enshrining the western architecture, in 180 feet tall and 55 feet wide. The ‚Äòmadbaha and Roopakoodu‚Äô were built in Portuguese style. The intricate altar engraving, the awesome gothic structure, the three huge glockenspiels in the belfry, the well known Kalkurish (Granite Cross) and the renowned feast of St.Sebastian with all its traditional ethos and the magnificent pyrotechnics- all these adorn the church and its elegance.  Altar  The Crowning of Mary as the Queen of the three worlds is etched on the altar and it is brightened with golden leaves. The splendid and large altar with oil paintings is the greatest attraction of Athirampuzha church.  Bells  The three massive bells hanging on the 85 feet tall bell fry was imported from Germany. Rev. Fr. Bonifus bought it from Germany in 1905. The words ‚ÄòArch Angel- St.Michael‚Äô are inscribed on the biggest of the three bells, ‚ÄòSan Sebastian-St.Sebastian ‚Äò on the second and ‚Äòsanta Maria- St.Mary‚Äô on the smaller of the bells. It is written in the records that these bells had cost 2157 rupees 25 Chakram and 4 Kasu in those days.  Granite Cross  The cross is erected in front of the church is made of a single piece of granite and is 200 years old. The huge cross made of granite is 30 feet tall is standing on a 2.5 feet high platform in 8 ‚Äòpattam‚Äô with stone steps on all sides in front of the church. Three granite lamps attached on stone pillars erected in the middle of the platform. The Cross was erected in the early decades of 18 th century. = Cheriapally = The Cheriapally (little or small church) is situated in the location where the first church was built and blessed in AD 835. It was renovated to the present form by Fr. Thomas Olakkapady and was blessed by his Excellency Kurialacherry Mar Thoma on January 22nd, 1919. Cheriapally is situated 200 meters away from the Valiapally. The Church is known in the name of St.Sebastian. Meeting the demands of the time, recently the church was renovated by very Rev. Dr. Mani puthiyidom. Location Ettumanoor Rail way Station and Industrial Estate is really located in Athirampuzha. Ettumanoor, Kumaranalloor, Arpookara, Kudamaloor, Mudiyoorkara, Aymanam, Kumarakom, Kaipuzha, Neendoor, Onamthuruth, Kurumulloor, Kanakkary, Pattithanam are the neighbouring places of Athirampuzha. Government Medical College, Kottayam, Caritas Hospital, Matha Hospital in Thellakom are situated very near to Athirampuzha. Athirampuzha is having many post offices like Amalagiri, Priyadarshini Hills, Sreekandamangalam, Kottackupuram etc. Transportation Athirampuzha was once a major inland waterway terminal town. Freight boats from Alappuzha called at Athirampuzha. From Athirampuzha bullock carts transported the goods to Pala and beyond. Passenger ferry services were available from Athirampuzha to Alappuzha and Muhamma. In the 1960s after road transportation gained prominence, Ettumanoor by virtue of its location gained popularity and the slow decline of Athirampuzha started. The passenger ferry services were curtailed till Mannanam after a newly constructed bridge over the navigable canal sank. The service to Mannanam is now curtailed till Maniaparambu. Newly declared National Waterway 9 starts from Athirampuzha Market and extends till Alappuzha via Kottayam. This waterway passes through Maniaparambu; from where passenger ferry services are operated to Muhamma, Kannankara and Cheepunkal. Major express trains like Venad Express and Parasuram Express stop at Ettumanur railway station. During the festive season some long-distance trains have a temporary halt here. The contact phone number of the station is 0481-2535531.

Altman. It stars Christine Taylor, Shane Brolly, Jerry O'Connell, and Ellie Cornell. Plot Amy is an elementary school teacher who suffers from nightmares about doctors and hospitals, stemming from the circumstances of her father's death. On the afternoon of the day he proposed, Amy and her fianc√© Nick are in a serious car accident. An ambulance takes Nick away without telling Amy which hospital they are going to. Amy and Lucas, the driver of the truck that hit them, try to find where Nick and Lucas' sister have been taken. Amy begins to hallucinate, seeing disfigured faces, including her own in a mirror. A little girl in her class, Melissa, claims she can help Amy find Nick, and gives Amy the name of St. Rosemary's Hospital. Amy and Lucas learn that St. Rosemary's, which was rumored to be the home of devil worshipers, was destroyed in a fire some 70 years ago, along with all the nurses and staff, who refused to leave. Meanwhile, Nick is having his own strange experiences at St. Rosemary's, such as nurses who spray blood on each other and eat another patient, and a hallway that repeats itself. After another hallucination, Lucas comforts Amy, but is revealed as a demon, taunting her about her father's death. She escapes him, and takes a cab to the hospital, where she is attacked by the nurses and hallucinations of dead patients. She encounters her father's ghost and relives his death when she was 12 years old, where at his demand she unplugged the machine keeping him alive. The Lucas demon catches up with Amy, telling her she belongs with the ghosts and monsters at St. Rosemary's because she murdered her father. She scalds Lucas with hot steam and escapes again, eventually rescuing Nick from the operating table. The hospital spontaneously begins to burn as they escape into the light. As Amy wakes up still in the car accident, she realises her experiences have been a test, and she is about to die.

It results from a system of one or more inter-related Poisson processes occurring in sequence, or phases. The sequence in which each of the phases occur may itself be a stochastic process. The distribution can be represented by a random variable describing the time until absorption of a Markov process with one absorbing state. Each of the states of the Markov process represents one of the phases. It has a discrete time equivalent ‚Äî the discrete phase-type distribution. The set of phase-type distributions is dense in the field of all positive-valued distributions, that is, it can be used to approximate any positive-valued distribution. Definition Consider a continuous-time Markov process with m + 1 states, where m ‚â• 1, such that the states 1,...,m are transient states and state 0 is an absorbing state. Further, let the process have an initial probability of starting in any of the m + 1 phases given by the probability vector (Œ±0,Œ±) where Œ±0 is a scalar and Œ± is a 1 √ó m vector. The continuous phase-type distribution is the distribution of time from the above process's starting until absorption in the absorbing state. This process can be written in the form of a transition rate matrix, : {Q}=left[begin{matrix}0&mathbf{0}mathbf{S}^0&{S}end{matrix}right], where S is an m √ó m matrix and S0 = ‚ÄìS1. Here 1 represents an m √ó 1 column vector with every element being 1. Characterization The distribution of time X until the process reaches the absorbing state is said to be phase-type distributed and is denoted PH(Œ±,S). The distribution function of X is given by, : F(x)=1-boldsymbol{alpha}exp({S}x)mathbf{1}, and the density function, : f(x)=boldsymbol{alpha}exp({S}x)mathbf{S^{0}}, for all x > 0, where exp( ¬∑ ) is the matrix exponential. It is usually assumed the probability of process starting in the absorbing state is zero (i.e. Œ±0= 0). The moments of the distribution function are given by : E[X^{n}]=(-1)^{n}n!boldsymbol{alpha}{S}^{-n}mathbf{1}. The Laplace transform of the phase type distribution is given by : M(s) = alpha_0 + boldsymbol{alpha} (sI - S)^{-1} mathbf{S^0}, where I is the identity matrix. Special cases The following probability distributions are all considered special cases of a continuous phase-type distribution: * Degenerate distribution, point mass at zero or the empty phase-type distribution - 0 phases. * Exponential distribution - 1 phase. * Erlang distribution - 2 or more identical phases in sequence. * Deterministic distribution (or constant) - The limiting case of an Erlang distribution, as the number of phases become infinite, while the time in each state becomes zero. * Coxian distribution - 2 or more (not necessarily identical) phases in sequence, with a probability of transitioning to the terminating/absorbing state after each phase. * Hyperexponential distribution (also called a mixture of exponential) - 2 or more non-identical phases, that each have a probability of occurring in a mutually exclusive, or parallel, manner. (Note: The exponential distribution is the degenerate situation when all the parallel phases are identical.) * Hypoexponential distribution - 2 or more phases in sequence, can be non- identical or a mixture of identical and non-identical phases, generalises the Erlang. As the phase-type distribution is dense in the field of all positive- valued distributions, we can represent any positive valued distribution. However, the phase-type is a light-tailed or platykurtic distribution. So the representation of heavy-tailed or leptokurtic distribution by phase type is an approximation, even if the precision of the approximation can be as good as we want. Examples In all the following examples it is assumed that there is no probability mass at zero, that is Œ±0 = 0. =Exponential distribution= The simplest non-trivial example of a phase-type distribution is the exponential distribution of parameter Œª. The parameter of the phase-type distribution are : S = -Œª and Œ± = 1. =Hyperexponential or mixture of exponential distribution= The mixture of exponential or hyperexponential distribution with Œª1,Œª2,...,Œªn>0 can be represented as a phase type distribution with : boldsymbol{alpha}=(alpha_1,alpha_2,alpha_3,alpha_4,...,alpha_n) with sum_{i=1}^n alpha_i =1 and : {S}=left[begin{matrix}-lambda_1&0&0&0&00&-lambda_2&0&0&00&0&-lambda_3&0&00&0&0&-lambda_4&00&0&0&0&-lambda_5end{matrix}right]. This mixture of densities of exponential distributed random variables can be characterized through : f(x)=sum_{i=1}^n alpha_i lambda_i e^{-lambda_i x} =sum_{i=1}^nalpha_i f_{X_i}(x), or its cumulative distribution function : F(x)=1-sum_{i=1}^n alpha_i e^{-lambda_i x}=sum_{i=1}^nalpha_iF_{X_i}(x). with X_i sim Exp( lambda_i ) =Erlang distribution= The Erlang distribution has two parameters, the shape an integer k > 0 and the rate Œª > 0. This is sometimes denoted E(k,Œª). The Erlang distribution can be written in the form of a phase-type distribution by making S a k√ók matrix with diagonal elements -Œª and super-diagonal elements Œª, with the probability of starting in state 1 equal to 1. For example, E(5,Œª), : boldsymbol{alpha}=(1,0,0,0,0), and : {S}=left[begin{matrix}-lambda&lambda&0&0&00&-lambda&lambda&0&00&0&-lambda&lambda&00&0&0&-lambda&lambda0&0&0&0&-lambdaend{matrix}right]. For a given number of phases, the Erlang distribution is the phase type distribution with smallest coefficient of variation. The hypoexponential distribution is a generalisation of the Erlang distribution by having different rates for each transition (the non-homogeneous case). =Mixture of Erlang distribution= The mixture of two Erlang distribution with parameter E(3,Œ≤1), E(3,Œ≤2) and (Œ±1,Œ±2) (such that Œ±1 + Œ±2 = 1 and for each i, Œ±i ‚â• 0) can be represented as a phase type distribution with : boldsymbol{alpha}=(alpha_1,0,0,alpha_2,0,0), and : {S}=left[begin{matrix} -beta_1&beta_1&0&0&0&0 0&-beta_1&beta_1&0&0&0 0&0&-beta_1&0&0&0 0&0&0&-beta_2&beta_2&0 0&0&0&0&-beta_2&beta_2 0&0&0&0&0&-beta_2 end{matrix}right]. =Coxian distribution= The Coxian distribution is a generalisation of the Erlang distribution. Instead of only being able to enter the absorbing state from state k it can be reached from any phase. The phase-type representation is given by, : S=left[begin{matrix}-lambda_{1}&p;_{1}lambda_{1}&0&dots&0&0 0&-lambda_{2}&p;_{2}lambda_{2}&ddots&0&0 vdots&ddots&ddots&ddots&ddots&vdots 0&0&ddots&-lambda_{k-2}&p;_{k-2}lambda_{k-2}&0 0&0&dots&0&-lambda_{k-1}&p;_{k-1}lambda_{k-1} 0&0&dots&0&0&-lambda_{k} end{matrix}right] and :boldsymbol{alpha}=(1,0,dots,0), where 0 < p1,...,pk-1 ‚â§ 1. In the case where all pi = 1 we have the Erlang distribution. The Coxian distribution is extremely important as any acyclic phase-type distribution has an equivalent Coxian representation. The generalised Coxian distribution relaxes the condition that requires starting in the first phase. Properties =Minima of Independent PH Random Variables= Similarly to the exponential distribution, the class of PH distributions is closed under minima of independent random variables. A description of this is here. Generating samples from phase-type distributed random variables BuTools includes methods for generating samples from phase-type distributed random variables. Approximating other distributions Any distribution can be arbitrarily well approximated by a phase type distribution. In practice, however, approximations can be poor when the size of the approximating process is fixed. Approximating a deterministic distribution of time 1 with 10 phases, each of average length 0.1 will have variance 0.1 (because the Erlang distribution has smallest variance). *BuTools a MATLAB and Mathematica script for fitting phase-type distributions to 3 specified moments *momentmatching a MATLAB script to fit a minimal phase-type distribution to 3 specified moments * KPC-toolbox a library of MATLAB scripts to fit empirical datasets to Markovian arrival processes and phase-type distributions. Fitting a phase type distribution to data Methods to fit a phase type distribution to data can be classified as maximum likelihood methods or moment matching methods.

It was published by Bandai Namco Games, and released in August 2006 for the PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube, PlayStation Portable, and Microsoft Windows. An Xbox version of the game was cancelled, though a preview of the game can be found in the Xbox release of Pac-Man World 3. A follow-up racing game, Pac-Man Kart Rally, was released for iOS in 2010 and Android in 2012. Gameplay Pac-Man World Rally features similar gameplay to other kart racing games such as Mario Kart. Up to four players can compete in standard racing across fifteen race tracks. During races, players can use power-ups to attack opponents or gain a boost of speed. By driving over a fruit button, that fruit will appear on the race track; players who collect a fruit will gain access to specific shortcuts on the track, giving them the opportunity to overtake their opponents. Players can also collect pac-dots scattered along the track to fill their Pac-Meter. When it is full, the player can activate a temporary transformation into the Pac-Mobile, a vehicle that gives them a boost of speed and allows them to eat and temporarily incapacitate other racers. The game also features a battle mode with four different arenas for competition. Players can choose from fourteen different playable characters from the Pac-Man franchise and other Bandai Namco titles. The PSP version features two exclusive characters, Mappy and Mr. Driller, along with an additional race track based on Dig Dug. Reception The game received mixed reviews on all consoles according to review aggregator Metacritic. IGN gave the GameCube version a rating of 5.7 out of 10.

Creation Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster met at Cleveland's Glenville High School. Both shared an affection for science fiction and pulp magazines and soon contributed to the student newspaper, The Glenville Torch. Soon, Siegel and Shuster produced their own science fiction magazine, Science Fiction, a stapled, mimeographed pamphlet containing drawings by Shuster and stories by Siegel under various pseudonyms. Only five issues were produced and they are very rare: one copy sold decades later for $50,000. Siegel's short story \\"The Reign of the Superman\\" (with an illustration by Shuster) concerned a bald-headed villain, vaguely reminiscent of Flash Gordon's Ming the Merciless, bent on dominating the world. Looking to comics as a vehicle for their ideas, they formulated a different take on the concept of the superman, with the character being a physically powerful hero. They pitched this unsuccessfully to newspaper syndicates as a comic strip. Siegel sent it to National Comics in New York where it languished in a drawer. When a publisher had difficulty deciding on an appropriate cover for a new magazine called Action Comics, someone pulled out the Superman proposal, showing him lifting a car with his hands. The publisher allegedly called it \\"ridiculous\\", but still decided to later put it on the cover. He wrote Siegel and Shuster and asked them if they could put together a 13-page story for Action Comics #1. Siegel and Shuster hurriedly cut and pasted their newspaper strip into comic book form and sent it off. In the summer, Action Comics hit the newsstands. Sales figures were not as immediate as today, but when Action Comics #4 hit the stands, sales were off the charts. Astounded by this, the publisher is reported to have gone down to his local newsstand and asked a kid, \\"Why are you reading this one?\\" pointing to Action Comics. \\"Because it's the one that has Superman in it, mister.\\" Early years The revised Superman first appeared in Action Comics #1 (June 1938). Siegel and Shuster sold the rights to the company for $130 and a contract to supply the publisher with material. The Saturday Evening Post reported in 1960 that the pair was being paid $75,000 each per year, still a fraction of DC's Superman profits. In 1964, when Siegel and Shuster sued for more money, DC fired them, prompting a legal battle that ended in 1967, when they accepted $200,000 and signed away any further claim to Superman or any character created from him. DC soon took Siegel's and Shuster's names off the byline. Following the huge financial success of Superman in 1978 and news reports of their pauper-like existences, Warner Communications gave Siegel and Shuster lifetime pensions of $35,000 per year and health care benefits. In addition, any media production which includes the Superman character must include the credit \\"Superman created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster\\". Throughout the decade of Superman's existence, DC sued several competing comic book publishers for introducing superheroes with similar powers. Among these companies were Fox Feature Syndicate for its character Wonderman, and Fawcett Comics for its character Master Man. In 1941, DC filed a lawsuit against Fawcett over the top-selling character of the time whom DC perceived as a Superman clone, Captain Marvel. During the National Comics Publications v. Fawcett Publications case, Fawcett fought the lawsuit, and continued publishing Captain Marvel, who surpassed Superman and the other superheroes in sales in the mid-1940s. By 1953, the case had been in litigation for 12 years and in court for five. The case was decided in DC's favor. Fawcett paid DC a fine and ceased publication of all Captain Marvel- related comics. DC would acquire the rights to Captain Marvel in the 1970s and the former rival characters would be presented as allies, with Captain Marvel often serving as the Kryptonian's substitute in emergencies. Golden Age By the time the United States had entered World War II, Superman had inspired a boom in the comic book industry and had engendered the new genre of the \\"superheroes\\" (although, controversy still exists over whether Superman can be considered the first superhero), which by then had included Batman, Captain America, Namor the Sub-Mariner, Captain Marvel, Robin, the Flash, Green Lantern, and Wonder Woman. By this time, the character had also leaped from the comics into other media. In 1939, Superman's adventures were seen in newspaper strips, although they were often reprints of what was already appearing in the comics. Also, The Adventures of Superman radio program was broadcast to the nation with millions of listeners. And while Captain Marvel beat him to live action cinema in The Adventures of Captain Marvel (in a serial originally intended for Superman), a series of lavishly budgeted animated cartoons produced by Max Fleischer hit theaters and continue to astound viewers today. After the war though, many of Superman's contemporaries found themselves slowly being forgotten after the boom became a bust. Throughout the late 1940s and the duration of the 1950s, Superman was by far the most popular character in comics. By the mid-1950s, there were few characters able to challenge him. Only Batman, Wonder Woman and a few other Golden-Agers remained. During this time, Superman's powers became more and more grandiose. They would expand to include heat vision (heat rays emitting from his eyes), the ability to breathe in space, and the power to travel through time. Superman's adversaries also grew more fantastic and mighty, but more and more issues of the comics involved \\"imaginary stories\\" which could result in any number of scenarios (either as a cause or an effect) and did not affect the continuity of future issues. These grander powers would be replicated within the Silver Age Superman. It was also established shortly after World War II that Superman had begun his career years earlier in the town of Smallville, under the name of Superboy. Stories about Superboy tended to be illustrated in an idyllic fashion and has been compared to the Saturday Evening Post. Superman also became a hit in live action. The 1948 self-titled serial and its sequel Atom Man vs. Superman with Kirk Alyn as Clark Kent/Superman were both box-office smashes‚Äîthe former being the biggest of all time‚Äîand his television show The Adventures of Superman starring George Reeves, was an integral part of the so-called \\"Golden Age of Television\\". As shown in the original Golden Age comics -- including Action Comics #1 (1938), Superman #1 (1939), and Superman #61 (1949), as well as in later stories such as Secret Origins (vol. 2) #1 (1986) -- noted scientist Jor-L discovers that Krypton is about to explode, yet he cannot convince his fellow Kryptonians to save themselves. However, he manages to construct a spaceship to save his infant son, Kal-L. The ship launches just as the planet explodes, with Kal-L landing on Earth in a farm country town (later identified as Smallville) around the time of World War I. In this version, John and Mary Kent (passing motorists who witness the spaceship landing) take the infant to an orphanage and soon return to adopt the child, naming him Clark. In his 1942 novel, George Lowther changes the names Jor-L, Kal-L and Lora (Superman's birth mother) to the more modern Jor-El. Kal-El and Lara. According to an interview with Joe Shuster shortly before his death, the name \\"Clark Kent\\" was chosen as a combination of the names of two movie stars, Clark Gable and Kent Taylor.Mietkewicz, Henry. \\"Great Krypton! Superman was the Star's Ace Reporter\\", The Toronto Star, April 26, 1992. Action Comics #1 (June 1938), the debut of Superman. Cover art by Joe Shuster. Clark grows up on the Kent family farm, slowly discovering that he possesses various superpowers, but unaware of his Kryptonian origins. After the deaths of his adoptive parents, Clark decides to use his powers for the benefit of humanity, constructing a stylized costume and moving to the nearby city of Metropolis. Clark begins work as a reporter at the Daily Star newspaper and soon makes his debut as the world's first superhero, Superman. The earliest Superman stories were written by Siegel, and drawn by Shuster in a style heavily influenced by comic strip artist Roy Crane. According to Jules Feiffer, \\"Shuster represented the best of old-style comic book drawing. His work was direct, unprettied - crude and vigorous; as easy to read as a diagram.... Slickness, thank God, was beyond his means\\" (Feiffer,The Great Comic Book Heroes, 1965). In the last interview Shuster gave before his death, he explained that he had modeled the visual appearance of Clark Kent on himself and movie star Harold Lloyd, and that of Superman on Douglas Fairbanks Senior. Lois Lane was modeled after Joanne Carter, who would later marry Jerry Siegel after the comic became a success. The skyscape of Metropolis was inspired by that of the city of Toronto, where Shuster had spent most of his childhood, and the newspaper employing Clark Kent, originally the Daily Star, was named after the Toronto Star for which Shuster had been a paperboy. (Mietkewicz, above) With Superman's quick success, the demand for Superman stories exceeded the creator's ability to produce them. Although the stories continued to carry the Siegel and Shuster byline, progressively more of the work was done by assistants in the Siegel and Shuster studio (Les Daniels, Comix: A History of Comic Books in America (1971)). But the use of assistants was not always successful. According to Jules Feiffer, Shuster \\"could not draw well, but he drew single-mindedly -- no one could ghost that style. It was the man. When assistants began 'improving' the appearance of the strip it went downhill. It looked as though it was being drawn in a bank\\" (Feiffer, above). One story in which Superman encountered a fictional cartoonist provided a tongue-in-cheek look at how such work was delegated. The story, which purported on the title page to tell \\"how comic strips are written and drawn\\", showed a studio filled with \\"artists -- stacks of them -- figure men, background specialists, inkers, letterers\\" as well as script-writers, all devoted to the production of stories about a Superman-like character, while the original creator of the strip was, to Superman's consternation, kept busy answering his fan mail (\\"King of the Comic Books\\", Superman #25, 1943). In the early stories, Superman is the only science- fiction element. He is described as the champion of the helpless and the oppressed, and he combats real-world social evils: munitions manufacturers, dangerous conditions in mines and a hit-and-run drunk driver (in Superman #1), rigged prize fights and corrupt businessmen (in Superman #2), child abusers and wife beaters (in Superman #3) and crooked cops and politicians (in Superman #7). By 1940, more extraordinary antagonists began to appear in the stories, including giants, mad scientists and dinosaurs. Superman's powers also developed during the 1940s, including vast increases in strength and acquiring the ability to fly -- the earliest comics depict Superman able to leap only an eighth of a mile at a time. In Superman #61 (1949), Superman finally learns of the existence of Krypton. Superman becomes an honorary member of the Justice Society of America, though he only participates in two capers in the original Golden Age stories (All-Star Comics #8 and 36). In his earliest adventures, Superman is depicted as being grim, strong-willed, and not afraid to take the life of an evildoer. These include examples of beating a robber to death after the thief tries to shoot him. Like the Batman of that era, he prompted a small controversy over comic characters killing. While Batman was toned down in terms of violence, Superman imposed a moral code that he would never take a life of any adversary he faced. During World War II, Superman was used as a figure of hope for readers in America and soldiers. This was evident in many of the Superman Fleischer Studios animated shorts of the era, in which Superman is helping the Allies win the war and often shown at odds with Japanese spies and German espionage agents. Beginning in the 1940s, Superman's life as a boy is gradually fleshed out. The first Superboy story appears in More Fun Comics #101 (February 1945), but the locale is still not clearly specified, though it appears to be a Metropolis neighborhood, and the Kents still do not have names. Superboy is not established as a Smallville resident until Superboy #2 (May 1949) and his parents' names, Jonathan and Martha Kent, are not mentioned until Superboy #12 in January 1951, 12 years after his debut in Action Comics #1. Other developments in the Superman mythos appear as a result of appearances in other media, including radio and newspaper strips. The Daily Star becomes the Daily Planet -- possibly because newspapers called The Daily Star already existed -- and Perry White replaces original editor George Taylor in the first episode of the radio serial; a young office boy named Jimmy Olsen joins the cast soon afterward. The Silver Age Early in the Silver Age of Comic Books, as DC was introducing new versions of old heroes, they explained that the old versions lived in a parallel dimension they called \\"Earth-Two\\". Although Superman had remained in continuous publication and was not explicitly revised for the Silver Age, the various inconsistencies between his original appearance (see Kal-L) and the version depicted in the 1960s were explained in the same way. The Superman presented during this period was the Superman of \\"Earth-One\\". Under the editorship of Mort Weisinger, the 1950s and early 1960s oversaw a major expansion of the character's mythos with such memorable foes as Brainiac and Bizarro appearing, as well as the arrival of his cousin Kara‚Äîalso known as Supergirl‚Äîand the formation of the Justice League of America. Despite this, the 1960s would be a gloomy decade for Superman. Foreshadowing this, in 1959, George Reeves, the actor who had embodied the Man of Steel in the 1950s Adventures of Superman television series, allegedly took his own life. Two Superman-related pilots, The Adventures of Superpup (1958) and The Adventures of Superboy (1961), failed. In 1966, a lavish Broadway musical entitled It's a Bird...It's a Plane...It's Superman premiered with actor Bob Holiday in the title role. Despite generally positive reviews from critics, the musical was a financial failure and ended its run after only 129 performances. In contrast to this, 1966 also saw the arrival of a successful Saturday morning animated series entitled The New Adventures of Superman. Meanwhile, in the comics, by the mid-1960s, Superman was facing more competition for consumer appeal than ever before. Batman had become a marketing bonanza, thanks in part to his own television series, which had much higher production values than the Adventures of Superman television series. Also, a rival company called Marvel Comics had unleashed a myriad of new characters including the Hulk, the Fantastic Four and Spider-Man, whose more sophisticated characterization encouraged more compelling storytelling. Superman remained popular and viable, but he was no longer alone. During the 1940s and 1950s, the Superman mythos gradually added familiar elements firmly established by the late 1950s, such as greater emphasis on the science fiction elements of Superman's world, including his Kryptonian origins as well as an updated version of his origins. In the version that became established by the early 1960s (and memorably summarized at the start of each episode of the 1950s Adventures of Superman television seriesNarrator Bill Kennedy (actor) intoned at the start of each program: \\"Faster than a speeding bullet. More powerful than a locomotive. Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound. Look! Up in the sky. It's a bird. It's a plane. It's Superman! Yes, it's Superman -- strange visitor from another planet who came to Earth with powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men. Superman -- who can change the course of mighty rivers, bend steel with his bare hands, and who, disguised as Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter for a great metropolitan newspaper, fights a never-ending battle for Truth, Justice, and the American Way.\\"), Superman is born on Krypton as Kal-El, the son of Jor-El (a leader-scientist) and Lara. When Kal-El is two or three years-old, Jor-El learns that Krypton is doomed to explode. He brings this warning to the Science Council, Krypton's rulers. The Science Council refuses to warn their fellow Kryptonians and forbids Jor-El to do so. Jor-El immediately begins work on a rocket that will allow the whole family to escape the coming disaster; however, events move too quickly, and only a small model is completed by the time of the final quakes. Lara stays by her husband's side rather than accompany Kal-El to Earth so that his ship will have a better chance of surviving the trip. Knowing that Earth's lower gravity and yellow sun will give the boy extraordinary powers, Jor-El launches Kal-El's rocketship toward Earth moments before Krypton explodes. Kal-El's ship lands in a field near the town of Smallville and is discovered by Jonathan and Martha Kent. They name the child Clark after Martha's maiden name. After formally adopting him, the Kents raise him. The Kents discover his amazing powers and train their adopted son to use his powers constructively. At the age of eight, Clark adopts the superhero identity \\"Superboy\\" and fights crime, both in the present and in the far future as a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes. After his graduation from high school and the death of his adoptive parents, Clark moves to Metropolis to attend Metropolis University. During his junior year, Clark changes his superhero name to \\"Superman\\". After graduating with a degree in journalism, Clark is hired by the Daily Planet. The Bronze Age Despite a changing market, Superman's stories remained similar to those which defined the Silver Age for quite a while. However, by the 1970s, it became apparent that even the Man of Steel needed some polishing. Superman entered the 1970s under famed artist and writer Jack Kirby. Kirby chose to revamp the spin-off title Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen, using it as a platform for his Fourth World concept. Among the creations first appearing therein was Darkseid, an alien warlord powerful enough to pose a great threat to Superman himself. During this same time period, editor Mort Weisinger was replaced by Julius Schwartz, who wanted to transition Superman to a more modern and realistic form. To this end, Schwartz recruited up-and-coming talents such as writers Dennis O'Neil, Elliot S. Maggin, Cary Bates, and cover artist Neal Adams, as well as veteran Superman artists Curt Swan and Murphy Anderson. This shift was marked by a major storyline entitled Kryptonite Nevermore, written by O'Neil, that significantly lowered Superman's power level and eliminated most of the kryptonite on Earth. However, soon after the storyline ended, O'Neil stepped down as writer and both of these changes were eventually reversed. Also Superman's Earth-2 counterpart married the Lois Lane of his world, and new rivals such as Terra-Man and the Parasite appeared. In 1978, the film Superman was released. The film featured groundbreaking special effects and stars such as Marlon Brando and Gene Hackman, but it was the performance of newcomer Christopher Reeve under the direction of Richard Donner that made the film come alive in the eyes of many critics. The film engendered a series of sequels throughout the 1980s. However, the later three sequels proved to be less successful than the first. In 1970, the Galaxy Broadcasting System and its president, Morgan Edge, purchased the Daily Planet, Edge subsequently naming Clark as the lead anchorman for its Metropolis television station, WGBS-TV. Later in the 1970s, childhood friend Lana Lang joins Clark in his newscasts as his fellow co-anchor. After the establishment of DC Comics' Multiverse in the 1960s, it is established retroactively that the Golden Age version of Superman lives on the parallel world of Earth-Two and is named \\"Kal-L\\", while his Silver Age/Bronze Age counterpart lives on Earth-One and is named \\"Kal-El\\". While the Multiverse allowed for DC Comics to bring the Golden Age stories back into continuity, it also created problems. There had been no break in Superman stories between the Golden and Silver Ages; the character had been published in one ongoing story since his debut. Additionally, DC had dropped the name \\"Kal-L\\" in favor of \\"Kal-El\\" before the end of the Golden Age. A series of stories in the 1970s establish that the Earth-Two Superman had married his version of Lois Lane in the 1950s (Action Comics #484 (1978)) and had become the editor-in-chief of The Daily Star. In the early 1970s, Kal-L discovers a Kryptonian rocket that contains his cousin, Kara Zor-L. After acclimating to Earth, Kara becomes the superheroine Power Girl. Kal-L also continues to serve with the revived Justice Society; he is revealed as a founding member of the group in the team's origin story in DC Special #29. In the early 1980s, Kal-L is also shown as a member of the All-Star Squadron during World War II. While the comics continued to sell, in 1986, DC Comics decided that Superman and all of their properties needed a vast overhaul. The Modern Age The Man of Steel #1, the 1980s revision of Superman. In a 12-issue 1985 miniseries entitled Crisis on Infinite Earths all of the DC heroes battled an evil being called the Anti-Monitor, resulting in the destruction of most of DC's alternate dimensions. Following this series, the backstories of all of DC's characters were altered and updated. Even Superman got an overhaul in 1986's John Byrne's The Man of Steel. This 1986 reboot brought substantial changes to the character and met huge success at the time, being one of the top-selling books. During Crisis, the various parallel Earths are combined into one, retroactively eliminating some of Earth-Two's heroes from existence. Kal-L, the Earth-Two Superman, his wife Lois Lane of Earth- Two, the Superboy of Earth-Prime and Alexander Luthor, Jr. of Earth-Three, have no reality to call their own, and they enter a \\"paradise dimension\\" at the end of the series. Kal-L is not seen again until the miniseries The Kingdom, in which it is revealed that he has found a means of exiting his dimension, but chooses not to do so yet. DC Comics retired the Silver Age version of Superman in 1986, after the publication of Crisis on Infinite Earths. Just before the character's revamp, the Silver Age Superman was given a sendoff in the two-part story Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow? published in Superman #423 and Action Comics #583, written by Alan Moore with art by Curt Swan. Although the new Modern Age version of Superman is said to have already been active for many years, most previous Superman appearances and elements were rendered out of continuity by John Byrne's The Man of Steel. Later stories such as Superman: Birthright bring many of the Silver Age elements back into continuity. In Byrne's version, Superman came from the planet Krypton which was re-imagined as a cold, sterile world in deep contrast to the wonderworld of the past 48 years. Once Kal-El's rocketship (containing genetic materials and a birthing-matrix which resulted in him being \\"born\\" on Earth) reached Earth he was adopted by Martha and Jonathan Kent. Instead of bringing him to an orphanage only to adopt him later, the Kents pretended that he was their own son. In the new version, Clark's powers developed gradually and he never assumed the identity of Superboy, and unlike most pre-existing versions, Ma and Pa Kent survived throughout Clark's adult years and remain important supporting characters in the comics to this day. Also, Superman's powers were scaled down, removing several of his more fantastic abilities in an attempt to make the stories more exciting. Superman's strength and speed were still immense, but there was a feeling of limits to them. In Metropolis, he faced a revised rogues gallery, including a new version of Lex Luthor who was recreated as an evil billionaire and philanthropist. Due perhaps to the elder Kents surviving into Clark's adulthood, another Byrne change was the relationship between Superman and his \\"normal\\" alter-ego. In line with the majority of superheroes Byrne put the emphasis on Superman being a disguise for Clark Kent. Previously the theme had been that Kent was a \\"secret identity\\" for Superman: in an adventure published in the 1960s, Kent finds himself at a loose end when staff at the Daily Planet go on strike and seriously considers it a chance to try out a new identity in case he has \\"to abandon [his] Clark Kent role permanently\\". His options include becoming a full-time policeman or even a mere tramp \\"whom no one would ever suspect of being the Man of Steel.\\"illustration included in the Penguin Book of Comics by George Perry and Alan Aldridge, published in 1967. There was also his relationships with other heroes, most notably Batman. From the 1940s to the 1970s, they had always been depicted as close friends and allies: the \\"World's Finest\\". From the 1980s, however, it was depicted it as an edgy and uneasy one: grudging respect and uneasy friendship due to their vast differences. After their first, tension-filled meeting, Batman considers that in \\"another reality\\" he and Superman may have been friends.Man of Steel miniseries #3, August 1986 Byrne quit the books a few years later, though his changes became the template for Superman's origin and characterization for almost two decades, most notably, his alterations to Lex Luthor, altering him from a mad scientist to an evil businessman, and having Ma and Pa Kent kept alive as supporting characters. One of the most notable revisions was the elimination of the Superboy persona from Superman's life, though a new live action television series starring Superboy premiered in 1988. Despite its following, the series has not been seen in North America and most of Europe since 1992, but its first season was released on DVD in 2006. A subsequent live action television show, Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, focused on the relationship between Lois Lane and Clark Kent. Superman exiles himself to space for a number of issues after he is forced to execute some Kryptonian criminals from a different dimension.Superman (vol. 2) #22 The repercussions of Superman's use of lethal force have been dealt with in several stories by subsequent writers. Clark Kent proposes to Lois Lane and reveals his secret identity; Lane accepts.Superman (vol. 2) #50 (1990) In 1992, DC Comics published the storyline The Death of Superman, in which Superman battles a monster of then-unknown origins called Doomsday. Both Superman and Doomsday are killed, taking each other down with their final blows. Funeral for a Friend follows The Death of Superman, chronicling Superman's funeral and examines other characters' reactions to the death of the hero. Next, DC published the Reign of the Supermen storyline, during which four different characters -- a new Superboy, the cyborg Man of Tomorrow, the brutal Last Son of Krypton and Steel -- are introduced as Superman, although none of them actually are. A de-powered Kal-El later surfaces in a Kryptonian battle-suit near the end of Reign of the Supermen. After Steel and Supergirl destroy the battle-suit, Kal-El is revealed as the pilot, wearing a black costume with a silver 'S' shield and long hair. The cyborg allies with Mongul and destroys Coast City. Superman, Superboy, Supergirl, Steel, Hal Jordan and the Eradicator attack the \\"Engine City\\" built on top of Coast City, and the united Supermen defeat the Man of Tomorrow, who is exposed as scientist Hank Henshaw. After the Reign of the Supermen storyline, Lois and Clark are reunited. When they eventually marry in the 1996 special Superman: The Wedding Album, it coincided with the marriage of the two characters in the television series Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman. The real hero returned; however, the story's aftermath lead to fellow superhero Green Lantern losing his mind and becoming a villain called Parallax. This led to the 1994 limited series Zero Hour which was a sequel-of-sorts to Crisis on Infinite Earths. For a few months after his return from the grave, Superman sported shoulder-length hair, and thus Clark Kent wore a ponytail. Exactly how he was able to grow his hair was never explained. In 1996, Superman (or rather, Clark Kent) finally married Lois Lane, and while they have had their ups and downs as a couple, they are happily married. That same year, Superman returned to animation in the animated series Superman which was produced by Bruce Timm and Paul Dini of Batman: The Animated Series fame. The series combined elements of both the Pre-and-Post-Crisis versions of the character and featured an all-star cast including Tim Daly as Superman, Dana Delany as Lois Lane, and Clancy Brown as Lex Luthor. Amidst much controversy, in the Superman comics of the late 1990s, Superman loses his traditional powers and transforms into a being of electromagnetic energy (see Superman Red/Superman Blue). In this form, Superman can phase through solid objects, see frequencies of energy, and draw power from electrical sources. In order to maintain physical cohesion in this form, he needs to wear a containment suit. During this time, he is able to transform into the corporeal form of Clark Kent but has no special powers in his human guise. In 2004, DC published an updated version of Superman's origin in the 12-issue limited series Birthright. Written by Mark Waid, Birthright restores some of the Pre-Crisis elements eliminated by John Byrne, including an emphasis on alien heritage. The \\"birthing matrix\\" is replaced by the more well-known rocketship, with Kal-El leaving Krypton as an infant rather than a fetus. Clark now possesses the ability to see a living being's \\"aura\\", and becomes a vegetarian. His 'S' shield is a symbol of hope from his homeworld, and his costume is made from fabrics put in his spaceship during his journey. Lex Luthor is also now a childhood friend in this version. However, due to the effects of Infinite Crisis, this origin is no longer valid. In the 2005-2006 Infinite Crisis miniseries (the sequel to Crisis on Infinite Earths), the Earth-Two Superman (Kal-L) escapes from the \\"paradise\\" dimension with Alexander Luthor, Jr. and Superboy-Prime. Kal-L wants to recreate the universe, which he believes is corrupt, making aspects of Earth-Two predominant, rather than those of Earth-One. He believes this will also save the dying Lois Lane of Earth-Two. Alexander Luthor, Jr. builds a machine which re-creates Earth-Two, transporting Kal-L and Lois there where Lois revives briefly before collapsing and dying. In grief, Kal-L lashes out at the Earth- One Superman, and the two fight until Wonder Woman arrives and ends their battle. The two Supermen team up to confront Luthor, Jr. and Superboy-Prime, whose plan to restore the Multiverse will kill billions of people. The pair willingly deplete their powers as they drag Superboy-Prime into Rao, Krypton's red sun, and use the last of their strength to defeat him on Mogo, the sentient Green Lantern planet. Fatally wounded in the battle, Kal-L dies in his cousin Power Girl's arms. He and Lois are buried next to the deceased Superboy. Infinite Crisis Secret Files and Origins 2006 shows that Superboy- Prime is to blame for many continuity errors in the DC Universe. In his attempt to escape reality, his assault on the barrier wall of the paradise dimension alters history, causing revisions of events to occur, especially the Birthright origin. Alexander Luthor, Jr.'s attempts to manipulate the Multiverse result in New Earth, affecting Superman's history further. During the publication of the Infinite Crisis limited series, the majority of DC Comics' superhero line advanced one year. One year later, Superman remains powerless, and Supergirl defends Metropolis. Unburdened by his responsibility to the world, Clark Kent has re-solidified his reputation as a star reporter. Although he manages to weasel his way out of prison, Lex Luthor's reputation is damaged irreparably (partially due to Clark's writing) and so are his fortune and power over LexCorp, now run by Lana Lang. Under attack, Clark's powers gradually return, and he returns to action. He finds that his sensory powers are enhanced, as are his computational abilities and memory. The Post-Modern Age =Birthright= In 2003, DC Comics released a 12-issue miniseries called Superman: Birthright, written by Mark Waid and penciled by Leinil Francis Yu; this series was a retcon of Superman's Post-Crisis origin, replacing Byrne's version, yet using some elements from that version; it also reintroduced various Pre-Crisis elements discarded in Byrne's revamp, along with elements that subtly tie into the Smallville television show. Due to the effects of Infinite Crisis, both Birthright and The Man of Steel were removed from canon. =New Earth= Action Comics #850 (2007) presents the latest revision of Superman's origin, since the history of the DC Universe was reset in Infinite Crisis. The new timeline is indicated to revise the complicated web of origins in a panel which shows a progression of four to five successive versions of Superman that are viewed by Kara Zor-El, clearly aping the art styles of Joe Shuster, Curt Swan, John Byrne, Dan Jurgens and Leinil Francis Yu. Written collaboratively by Kurt Busiek, Fabian Nicieza and Geoff Johns, the new version includes details such as Krypto's presence on Krypton, Jor- El's frustrations with the Council of Krypton refusing to evacuate the planet, Clark's awareness of his adopted status from a younger age, having interacted with Lex Luthor at a younger age, Clark not being the direct cause of Lex's baldness, his wearing glasses as far back as his early teens in Smallville, and using his powers to help others at a younger age. The new version also supports the portrayal and aesthetic design of Jor-El, now similar to Marlon Brando's portrayal of the role, and Krypton, as featured in the ongoing Richard Donner co-authored arcs of Action Comics (essentially rendering Krypton closer in style to his and Bryan Singer's shared film continuity), as well as the fitting in with the discovery in The Lightning Saga that Clark was a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes during his adolescence and still retains possession of a Legion flight ring. Superman is established as a founding member of the Justice League in Justice League of America (vol. 2) #0. =Ongoing titles= All-Star Superman, launched in 2005, is a limited series under DC's All-Star imprint, written by Grant Morrison and drawn by Frank Quitely. DC claims that this series will \\"strip down the Man of Steel to his timeless, essential elements\\". However, the version presented is clearly almost wholly based on the Pre-Crisis Silver Age version of the character, and Morrison has stated this, claiming it to be the Superman that still exists despite being retconned 20 years earlier. The All-Star imprint attempts to retell some of the history of DC's iconic characters, but outside of the strict DC universe continuity. Following the events of Infinite Crisis and the \\"Up, Up and Away!\\" storyline, the two major Superman titles have followed two major story arcs. Action Comics deals with Superman and wife Lois adopting a Kryptonian child who is revealed to be the child of General Zod. After resolving this arc, Superman has dealt with the return of one of his most dangerous villains, Brainiac, which resulted in the arrival of thousands of Kryptonians on Earth and sadly the death of his adoptive father. In New Krypton, the Kryptonians create a new planet, New Krypton, and raise it opposite Earth's place in the solar system. In Superman: World of New Krypton, Superman decides to leave Earth to live among the Kryptonians, hoping to establish peace between humanity and the Kryptonians. The events of Last Stand of New Krypton and War of the Supermen devastate New Krypton and cause Superman to battle General Zod. He returns Zod to the Phantom Zone and then returns to Earth. In the current Superman: Grounded, Superman walks across the United States of America with the goal of reconnecting with the everyday people he is committed to protect. In the Reign of Doomsday storyline, Superman and his closest allies must defeat the Doomslayer, a mysterious being that seeks to destroy Doomsday and all life on Earth. The New 52 Superman, reinterpreted following the events of The New 52. Art by George P√©rez. In 2011, DC Comics rebooted its continuity and relaunch its publications with new #1 issues. Changes to Superman includes making him a single man and the deaths of his parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent, which occurred years prior. Superman also wears a ceremonial battle armor that pays tribute to his Kryptonian legacy. The new armor is visually similar to his classic outfit, with the only difference is the lack of the traditional red briefs. In addition, real-life astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson assisted DC Comics in determining that Krypton orbited the red dwarf LHS 2520 in the constellation Corvus 27.1 lightyears from Earth.Wall, Mike (November 7, 2012). \\"Superman's Home Planet Krypton 'Found'\\".

In this title, Superman wears a shirt with the S symbol, a smaller cape, a pair of jeans and worker boots. A rationale is given later in the title for the acquisition of the battle armor, after which Superman abandons the shirt, focusing into his personal growth as the later, mature Superman. Issues 19-21 focused on a three-part storyline that took place one year before the present and afterwards the series focused on Superman's adventures in the present alongside the main Superman title. *Superman is set in the character's present years and details his current adventures. In this title, Clark quits working for the Daily Planet and becomes an independent blogger. This version of Superman also began a relationship with Wonder Woman, a move which attracted media attention due to Superman's long-standing relationship with Lois Lane in all previous incarnations of the character, with the exception of non-canon stories, which took place in DC's Elseworlds imprint. Superman is also depicted as a founding member of the Justice League. DC released the Superman/Wonder Woman comic book series in 2013, which focused on them as a couple.Charles Soule And Tony Daniel Discuss Superman and Wonder Woman ComicSoule and Daniel Join Forces for Superman-Wonder Woman Geoff Johns revealed that Superman and Wonder Woman's relationship will end badly. Later on during the Truth storyline, Superman ended the relationship out of frustration with the loss of his powers and doubts about the two's compatibility.Geoff Johns And Jeff Lemire Talk Too Many Justice Leagues A third Superman book, Superman Unchained, was released in June 2013 to coincide with the release of the new Superman movie, Man of Steel. It is written by Scott Snyder and drawn by Jim Lee. The book concluded publication in November 2014. In February 2015, due to Clark exposing to the world his secret identity, Superman will receive a new power and a new outfit, starting in Superman #38, by Geoff Johns and John Romita, Jr. This version of Superman is eventually killed in Superman #52. =Convergence= In the miniseries Convergence, which featured the Pre-Flashpoint Superman and Lois Lane, with the couple expecting a baby. Convergence also shows the birth of their son, Jonathan Samuel Kent. Following the events, in the miniseries Superman: Lois & Clark, they settled into the New 52 reality under the aliases of Clark and Lois White, and witnessed the events revolving the alternate versions of themselves and the former's enemies. They would later appear as part of the final issues for the New 52 Action Comics and Superman series, where in the end the New 52 Superman would pass the torch to his predecessor just before he died. DC Rebirth Superman, as depicted following the events of DC Rebirth. In June 2016, DC Comics relaunched its entire line of comic books series with DC Rebirth, including both the Action Comics and Superman series. The Superman of the New 52 reality lives with his wife Lois Lane of his reality and their biological son Jonathan Kent. This Superman wears a costume similar in style to the Superman outfit in the film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016). The story arc Superman Reborn smooths over the discrepancies between the two versions of the character. According to Mr. Mxyzptlk, the creation of the New 52 caused Superman to be separated into two people: the New 52 character that served as the protagonist of the Superman books in 2011-2015 and the pre- Flashpoint character that took part in the Convergence event and sired Jon. Thanks to Jon, the new Superboy, the two Supermen merge into one complete version of Superman, rearranging their shared histories and accommodating them into the restored DC Universe. This complete Superman features a new suit that combines elements from the two eras. To celebrate the release of issue 1,000 for Action Comics which was released on April 18, 2018, Superman was returned to his original Pre-New 52 costume.SUPERMAN's Red Trunks Are Back For ACTION COMICS #1000 See also *Golden Age of Comic Books References Superman Comic book publication histories ","title":"Publication history of Superman"},{"id":"3513219","text":"Kareem Michael McKenzie (born May 24, 1979) is a former American football offensive tackle.

(Masters of the Obvious) is an American garage punk band currently based in New Hampshire. Formed in New Orleans in 1981 by Paul Caporino, the lineup of the band has seen many changes over the years, with Caporino being the only consistent member. The band has recorded many albums, singles and CDs, including several albums for the Chicago-based record label Criminal IQ Records.  History  M.O.T.O. has existed in some form for over . Over that time, the band has undergone numerous lineup changes, but it has always functioned primarily as a platform for Paul Caporino's songwriting, a repertoire that includes hundreds of songs in a variety of genres such as pop, punk rock, metal, soul, noise music, garage rock and new wave. Original MOTO Cafe Brazil circa 1984 - Left to right: Mike Tomeny, Paul Caporino, Donald Ward (mostly hidden behind Caporino), Jeff Tomeny = Original lineup = M.O.T.O. was formed in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1981. The original lineup consisted of Mike Tomeny on guitar, his brother Jeff Tomeny on guitars and vocals and Don Ward on drums in addition to Caporino on guitar and vocals. This edition of the band first performed the songs \\"Skeletons Need Their Sleep\\" (composed by Jeff Tomeny) and \\"Satan Always Calls Collect\\" (by Tomeny and Caporino), which would reappear on several 7\\" EPs in later years. Because M.O.T.O. recorded and performed live somewhat infrequently, Paul Caporino began to record a series of cassette albums without the assistance of the other members of the band. The tapes were originally intended as demos, but Caporino was so satisfied with the results that he decided to distribute them to the public. These tapes included Turn Your Head and Cough, BOLT! (short for \\"Best of Lent Tape\\"), Rock, Roll & Dismember and MOTOERECTUS. Caporino wrote all the songs and played all the instruments on the cassettes, layering multiple guitars, bass, lead and harmony vocals over a Mattel Synsonics drum machine. These early tapes feature many songs that would reappear in live shows and studio recordings over the years, including \\"Midnight at the Guantanamo Room\\", \\"Dick About It\\", \\"Month of Sundays\\", and \\"I'm Infected\\". The tapes showcased Caporino's offbeat and sometimes vulgar sense of humor along with his extensive knowledge of the history of popular music. To reward the astute listener, the music contained winking references to the Beatles, the Kinks, Bob Dylan, Donovan, Led Zeppelin, The Jam, Black Flag, H√ºsker D√º, Judas Priest and many other artists. The original lineup also made a few recordings as a band, which were collected on the QUASIMOTO cassette. When, in 1987, the original lineup disbanded, Caporino continued M.O.T.O. as a trio backed by Brad Brewster on drums and Greg Fisk on bass. This edition of the band played more live dates than the original lineup, but recorded very little. = M.O.T.O. as a duo = Shortly thereafter, Caporino moved to West Somerville, Massachusetts, near Boston. There he formed a new version of the band with drummer Beck Dudley which lasted until 1993 and produced a number of 7\\" EPs, three home-recorded cassettes (Neon Bone!, 1000 Years of Rock'N'Roll, and Talk of M.O.T.O.) and a full-length album, compiled from the first two tapes (This Corpse is a Warning). This lineup was the first to regularly record in a professional studio. These recordings were collected in 1994 on the Single File CD, released by Mind Of A Child Records and later re-issued by Criminal IQ Records in 2004. The band achieved its greatest notoriety to date as a duo, touring extensively and being featured by legendary BBC DJ John Peel, who played the song \\"Rot Rot Rot\\" from the Hammeroid! EP on his program several times. This lineup could be said to have presaged the later success of the White Stripes as a guitar/drums, male/female duo. It was also during this period that both Caporino and Dudley moved from the Boston area to Chicago. = Post-Beck era = Dudley left the band in 1993 to pursue a Master's Degree in architecture. Though the band experienced a fall-off in popularity, Caporino continued to home-record cassettes at a highly productive rate, releasing seven cassettes between 1993 and 1998. The band also performed live with new members Dennis Spaag on bass and Garret Hammond (a future member of Kill Hannah) on drums. The Chicago lineup continued to evolve, featuring drummers Tim Ford and Ryan \\"Guitar\\" Murphy, bassist JJ Champion, and guitarist/bassist Laurence Museum of Death. 2003 saw the release of the band's first full album of all-new recordings, Kill M.O.T.O., which featured studio recordings of songs from Caporino's most recent home-recorded cassettes as well as brand new songs. In 2005, the band released Raw Power, which met with critical acclaim, including being selected as the best Chicago release of 2005 by the Chicago Reader's Bob Mehr.The Meter051223.html = Move to Providence, return to New Orleans, and touring = In September 2009, Caporino briefly moved to Providence, Rhode Island. He planned to continue the band with a new lineup in Providence, but subsequently decided to return to his native New Orleans, where he reunited with original members Jeff and Mike Tomeny. Caporino has also begun to perform acoustic solo sets consisting primarily of M.O.T.O. material. M.O.T.O. toured almost constantly, covering Europe, Japan, Australia as well as the US. The band recently released the studio albums \\"No Way Street\\" and \\"Pack Your Troubles In Dreams\\" and has been re-releasing older material via digital download and CD-R. = Move to New Hampshire and tour of China = M.O.T.O. relocated, this time to New Hampshire, as Caporino married bassist J.V. McDonough (formerly of The River City Rebels) and added her to the lineup. Joined by China-based expats Gil Brunnhoeffer and Chris Ginn, the band completed their first tour of China in 2013 with Shanghai based punk band Round Eye.  Discography  In the early years of the band, Caporino expressed disdain for compact disc media. Although recent M.O.T.O releases are now available in CD format, most of the earlier band releases were on cassette and LP. Most of their newer recordings are released through Criminal IQ Records and Little Teddy Recordings, the latter being home to Daniel Johnston's recordings. In recent years, however, Caporino has changed his opinion about CDs, saying that they are \\"the best way to listen to music - you can play them in your car, download them easily onto a laptop and put them on your iPod\\", and has expressed annoyance at the resurgence of vinyl LPs, describing the format as \\"sonically limited and expensive to manufacture, while not allowing as much listening time as a CD, which can hold most double LPs on one disc. Plus you don't have to turn a CD over every 20 minutes or so.\\" = (LPs & CDs) = * Chinese Rocks (or A Fistful of Maobacks) - (2014 vinyl LP release by Blast Of Silence Records/Secret Mission Records) - (released on CD (with bonus tracks) 2017 by MOTOPAC) * Pack Your Troubles In Dreams - (2013 vinyl LP release by Svart Records/Blast Of Silence Records) * No Sleep 'til Turku (2012 vinyl LP release by Svart Records/Blast Of Silence Records) * No Way Street (2012 vinyl LP release by Svart Records/Blast Of Silence Records / CD release by Tokyo No Records) * Raw Power (2005 release by Criminal IQ, also on CD) * Single File CD (2004 re-issue by Criminal IQ in the USA) * Kill MOTO!

Members include Kip McCabe, Jay Ryan (ex- Hubcap) and Jason Harvey. Dianogah's debut album, As Seen from Above, was recorded by Steve Albini, who also produced their second full-length album, Battle Champions, which was released on May 29, 2000. Dianogah named their band after the garbage compactor monster (the Dianoga) in the 1977 film Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. The group was one of about half-dozen performers that contributed to the soundtrack for 1998's Reach the Rock, a film directed by William Ryan and whose script was written by acclaimed director John Hughes. Producer John McEntire (of The Sea and Cake and Tortoise) was at the helm for the recording of the soundtrack, and later worked with the band on their third album Millions of Brazilians. This record, released on April 16, 2002, also featured Rachel Grimes (of Rachel's) and John Upchurch of The Coctails. On January 15, 2000, the band joined M.O.T.O to serve as opening acts for the final show at the Lounge Ax, an event which had The Coctails reunite briefly to perform as headliners. Between 2000 and 2007, the band toured Europe three times (in 2000, 2002, and 2004), and play around the midwest and east coast. In 2007, the band returned to the studio with producer John McEntire to record their fourth album, Qhnnnl. In 2008, the band released Qhnnnl and had Stephanie Morris sing on some of the recorded tracks. She played keyboard and guitar live with band as well on their 2008 east coast summer tour, as well as a fall 2008 trip to Europe, and a spring 2009 trip to England for the All Tomorrow's Parties Festival. On June 1, 2009, Stephanie Morris died suddenly. In a statement on the band's web page, Morris had become an \\"integral part of our group, both musically and socially. Stephanie's passing took us all by surprise and has left a giant hole in the lives of many, especially her husband Nathan and her family.\\" The band mentioned in the same note, they'd play a scheduled Pitchfork Music Fest set in July 2009 in her honor, but beyond that the band reported they were not sure what the future would hold for them. Dianogah performed at the 2014 PRF BBQ in Chicago. The band played two shows in 2017. Both were in their hometown of Chicago.

The notion of \\"good performance\\" can depend on context and may include optimizing metrics such as link data rate, network capacity, outage probability, geographic coverage and range, and life of the network and network devices. Power control algorithms are used in many contexts, including cellular networks, sensor networks, wireless LANs, and DSL modems. Transmit power control Transmit power control is a technical mechanism used within some networking devices in order to prevent too much unwanted interference between different wireless networks (e.g. the owner's network and the neighbour's network). It is also essential component in case of cognitive radio networks deployed in a distributed fashion, aka distributed power control.F. Foukalas and T. Khattab\\"Distributed Power Control for Carrier Aggregation in Cognitive Heterogeneous 5G Cellular Networks.\\" CrownCom 2015: Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks, Oct.2015, pp 681-695 The network devices supporting this feature include IEEE 802.11h Wireless LAN devices in the 5 GHz band compliant to the IEEE 802.11a. The idea of the mechanism is to automatically reduce the used transmission output power when other networks are within range. Reduced power means reduced interference problems and increased battery capacity. The power level of a single device can be reduced by 6 dB, which should result in an accumulated power level reduction (the sum of radiated power of all devices currently transmitting) of at least 3 dB (half of the power). UMTS Because of the interference in the WCDMA system, power control plays a very important role in the quality control for the different services in the UMTS system. Power control is executed 1500 times per second, whereas in the GSM system it is ~2 times per second.

Housed in the heritage-listed French House, it was founded in 1992 as the LSU Honors College, and renamed in December 2014. The college primarily admits the top 10% of incoming LSU freshmen, and provides its students with a curriculum of seminar classes, mentoring relationships with faculty, and opportunities for undergraduate research, culminating in the Honors Thesis. History and setting The French House on the 50th Anniversary Celebration of Honors education at LSU in 2017. Honors education at LSU began in 1967 when professors Charles Bigger and Edward Henderson coordinated and developed a series of team-taught collaborative courses that remain the academic core of the Honors curriculum at LSU. In 1992, the LSU Board of Supervisors approved the transformation of the honors program at the University into the LSU Honors College. Bill Seay served as the College's first and only dean until 2003 when Nancy Clark assumed the role. The third and current dean is Dr. Jonathan H. Earle, who joined the university in 2014. The Honors College was initially located in the Old President's House on Highland Road. Comprising the French House, the Laville Honors House residence hall, and the 459 Dining Commons, this complete \\"campus within a campus\\" distinguishes the Ogden Honors College as one of the few honors institutions in the country with a dedicated campus specifically for the honors student body. In December 2014, LSU announced that they had received a $12 million investment from alumnus Roger Ogden, the largest unrestricted endowed gift in LSU history. Shortly after, the LSU Board of Supervisors approved the renaming of the LSU Honors College in honor of Ogden's late father and son. =The French House= In 1999, the Honors College moved into the French House, Renaissance-style chateau originally constructed as a center for intensive study of the French language, literature, and culture. The French House was dedicated on April 15, 1935, when French Ambassador Andr√© de Laboulaye traveled to Louisiana to celebrate LSU‚Äôs Diamond Jubilee. The French ambassador laid the structure‚Äôs cornerstone, which included a piece of wood from the original Fort de la Boulaye, the first French settlement in Louisiana. Ambassador Fran√ßois de Laboulaye, Andr√© de Laboulaye‚Äôs son, rededicated the building on April 3, 1981. The French House remains the only non-Quadrangle LSU structure on the National Register of Historic Places. A long-anticipated $5 million renovation of the interior of the French House began in December 2014, funded through capital outlay funds allocated by former Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal. Renovations were completed in 2016. The area was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 13, 1982. with two photos and two maps With . =Laville Honors House= Located near the French House is the Laville Honors House, a residence hall for students enrolled in the College. The Laville Honors House includes an East Hall, West Hall, and central lobby. The East and West wings are mirror images of one another. Plans were approved by the Louisiana Board of Regents in 2008 to add of new space and renovate of existing residence hall space, which included expanding lounges and study space and providing for faculty residence on the first floor. The West Hall renovations were complete in fall 2010. The renovations of the East Hall and addition of a central lobby were completed in April 2012 at a cost of $14 million. Courses, undergraduate thesis, and awards There are three different types of Honors courses at the University. Courses offered through the Honors College are designated by the HNRS prefix and include interdisciplinary courses which generally exist as seminar-lecture pairs and feature the history, politics, philosophy, art, languages, and literature of specific civilizations or time periods. These courses are capped at 20 in order to increase student engagement. Ideally, the research that begins in an HNRS class may lead eventually to an Honors Thesis under the direction of the faculty member. Academic departments across campus also offer honors equivalent courses. Students may also choose to \\"Honors Option\\" a course by entering into a contract with a professor of an upper level course and fulfilling a set of agreed upon requirements that go beyond the expectations laid out in the course's syllabus. This modified coursework proposal provides an opportunity for upper-level students to earn Honors credit for a traditional 3000/4000 level LSU course. Cornerstone of the French House Students in the College have the opportunity to complete an undergraduate thesis, graduate with College Honors, and earn two different distinctions. Sophomore Honors Distinction is bestowed upon a student who completes 20 hours or more of Honors courses by the end of the second year, maintains a 3.5 cumulative GPA in Honors courses and in all course work, and completes one Honors interdisciplinary course. Upper Division Honors Distinction can be earned by completing Honors work in courses at the 3000 level or above, including three to six hours of research, and by writing and defending an undergraduate thesis in the student‚Äôs main field of study. The Honors Thesis is the capstone achievement of the Honors College curriculum, and completing one is a culminating experience for fourth year students. In the Honors Thesis students answer questions and solve problems in order to demonstrate their mastery by completing a long-term project with an expert faculty member in their chosen discipline. Students who attain both Sophomore and Upper Division Honors Distinction graduate with College Honors‚Äîa designation that appears on a student's diploma. Since 2005, Ogden Honors students have been awarded with more than 100 national and international fellowships, including 18 Goldwater Scholarships, 10 Truman Scholarships, 36 NSF Graduate Research Fellowships, 17 Critical Language Scholarships, and 4 Udall Scholarships. Admission and enrollment Although the College accepts continuing and transfer students, most incoming students enroll as college freshmen. Recommended SAT scores (EBRW+M) and GPA for prospective high school students are 1360 and 3.5 respectively. Students may also have a minimum composite score of 30 on the ACT and should complete the writing component of the SAT or ACT for consideration. Today, the LSU Honors College has a student enrollment of about 2,000. Applications for fall 2006 reached 2,400 by December 15. The Honor College enrollment grew by 33 percent in the fall of 2007.

The original version of NTRUSign was Polynomial Authentication and Signature Scheme (PASS), and was published at CrypTEC'99 . The improved version of PASS was named as NTRUSign, and was presented at the rump session of Asiacrypt 2001 and published in peer-reviewed form at the RSA Conference 2003 . The 2003 publication included parameter recommendations for 80-bit security. A subsequent 2005 publication revised the parameter recommendations for 80-bit security, presented parameters that gave claimed security levels of 112, 128, 160, 192 and 256 bits, and described an algorithm to derive parameter sets at any desired security level. NTRU Cryptosystems, Inc. have applied for a patent on the algorithm. NTRUSign involves mapping a message to a random point in 2N-dimensional space, where N is one of the NTRUSign parameters, and solving the closest vector problem in a lattice closely related to the NTRUEncrypt lattice. NTRUSign is claimed to be faster than those algorithms at low security levels, and considerably faster at high security levels. However, analysis had shown that original scheme is insecure and would leak knowledge of private key. A redesigned pqNTRUSign had been submitted to NIST's Post- Quantum Cryptography Standardization competition. It is based on \\"hash-and- sign\\" (contrasting Fiat‚ÄìShamir transformation) methodology, and claims to achieve smaller signature size. NTRUSign is under consideration for standardization by the IEEE P1363 working group. Security It was demonstrated in 2000 by Wu, Bao, Ye and Deng that the signature of PASS, the original version of NTURSign, can be forged easily without knowing the private key . NTRUSign is not a zero-knowledge signature scheme and a transcript of signatures leaks information about the private key, as first observed by Gentry and Szydlo.http://www.szydlo.com/ntru-revised-full02.pdf Nguyen and Regev demonstrated in 2006 that for the original unperturbed NTRUSign parameter sets an attacker can recover the private key with as few as 400 signatures.P. Nguyen and O. Regev, \\"Learning a Parallelepiped: Cryptanalysis of GGH and NTRU Signatures\\", available from https://cims.nyu.edu/~regev/papers/gghattack.pdf The current proposals use perturbations to increase the transcript length required to recover the private key: the signer displaces the point representing the message by a small secret amount before the signature itself is calculated. NTRU claimed that at least 230 signatures are needed, and probably considerably more, before a transcript of perturbed signatures enabled any useful attack. In 2012 an attack on the scheme with perturbations was presented that required a few thousand signatures for standard security parameters. The pqNTRUSign claims a 128-bit classical and quantum security for their given parameter set.

As soon as the soldiers entered the building it blew up, killing them all. It was proven that the soldiers had no high explosives on them, and speaking with the locals afterwards Ryan was told of one of the nuns having miraculous powers: she brought down a lightning bolt from heaven that destroyed the convent and killed the Germans. All that was left of the building were two walls, one of which had a powder mark in the shape of a giant hound. This scared the local peasants who avoided the area after dark. The nun in question survived and went with other refugees to \\"Treane\\" in Cornwall, and Anstruther confirms that his sister did take in some Belgians at the time. In Cornwall, Anstruther finds out from his sister that the nun, Marie Angelique, is still in the area. She has constant hallucinations and is being studied by a local, new, young doctor by the name of Rose, who intends to write a monograph on her condition. Anstruther meets Rose and persuades him to let him meet the young nun. She is boarding with the local district nurse. She talks of her dreams, but when Anstruther tells her of the story he heard from Ryan, she is shocked to realise that what she thought was a dream was true ‚Äì that of unleashing the \\"Hound of Death\\" on the Germans as they approached the altar. She rambles on about the \\"City of Circles\\" and the \\"People of the Crystal\\", and when they have left her, Rose tells Anstruther that he has heard her mention crystals before, and on a previous occasion he produced a crystal and showed it to her to test her reaction. She gasped, \\"Then the faith still lives!\\" The next day, the young nun tells Anstruther that she feels that the crystal is a symbol of faith, possibly a second Christ, and the faith has endured for many centuries. Rose tries a word association test in which Marie Angelique makes references to signs ‚Äì and the sixth sign is destruction. Anstruther starts to feel uneasy about Rose's interest in the case, suspecting something more than purely medical motives. Some time later, Anstruther receives a letter from the nun in which she voices her fears of Rose and says that the doctor is trying to obtain her powers by progressing to the sixth sign. The same day he hears from his sister that both Rose and the nun are dead. A landslide swept away the cliffside cottage they were in, and the debris on the beach is in the shape of a giant hound. He also hears that Rose's rich uncle died the same night, struck by lightning, although there were no storms in the area, and the burn- mark on him is in an unusual shape. Remembering comments from Marie Angelique, Anstruther wonders if Rose acquired the ancient (or possibly future?) powers of the crystal but failed to control them properly, resulting in his own death. His fears are confirmed when he comes into possession of Rose's notes which detail his attempts to become a superman with \\"the Power of Death\\" in his hands. =The Red Signal= A dinner party is taking place in the London home of Jack and Claire Trent. Their three guests are a Mrs Violet Eversleigh, Sir Alington West (a noted psychiatrist), and West's nephew, Dermot West. The talk turns round to precognitive abilities and premonitions, of which Sir Alington is dismissive, believing them to be both coincidences and situations that are talked up after the event. Dermot is not so sure, describing such feelings as having a red signal ‚Äì \\"danger ahead!\\" ‚Äì and tells one story of near-death in Mesopotamia, when he avoided being murdered by an Arab servant. What he does not tell the group is that he is again experiencing the red signal tonight at the dinner party. He ponders who could be the source of danger, his thoughts moving to his love for Claire Trent, a feeling that he constantly suppresses in view of the fact that Jack Trent is his best friend. Coming out of his reverie, he finds the conversation has turned to madness and the dangers of suppressing delusions. Sir Alington looks pointedly at Claire Trent, who is visibly disturbed by this talk. One of the purposes of the evening is to meet a medium who is there to conduct a sitting. She does so and warns one of the people in the room not to go home, as there is danger there. The party breaks up and Sir Alington asks Dermot to accompany him home to Harley Street before going on to join his friends at the Grafton Galleries. Once inside, he tells his nephew that he knows of his infatuation for Claire, and admonishes him not to give in to it. He disapproves of divorce, and speaks of a history of insanity in their family, and his suspicions of homicidal mania. The discussion becomes emotional and Dermot utters a threat against his uncle, one which is overheard by the manservant, Johnson, as he brings in drinks. Going to the Grafton Galleries, Claire tells Dermot that his feelings for her are reciprocated, and because of this she wants him to go away. He asks her to join him, but she refuses. Going back to his flat, Dermot is once again assailed by the feeling of danger and, to his astonishment, finds a revolver hidden in a bedroom drawer. There is a knock on the door and Dermot opens it to the police. The feeling of danger makes him tell the police that he is Milson, his own manservant, and the police tell him that his \\"master\\" is wanted for the murder of Sir Alington who was shot dead earlier that night after being overheard arguing with his nephew. The police search the flat, find the revolver, and decide to leave an officer there in case West \\"comes back\\". Dermot escapes from the flat through the kitchen window while supposedly getting drinks, and quickly bumps into Jack Trent who gets him away to his own house. He locks himself in a room with Dermot, produces a gun, and then insanely confesses to the murder. Sir Alington recognised his condition and was at the dinner party to assess his true mental state. Dermot assumed that his uncle was speaking of Claire, who was actually assisting Sir Alington in his diagnosis. She now assists the police to gain entry to the house and the locked room. Jack shoots himself before they can take him. =The Fourth Man= Canon Parfitt just manages to catch his train on time for a night journey. In his first class carriage he is reacquainted with Sir George Durand, a famous lawyer. A third man in the carriage introduces himself as Dr Campbell Clark, an eminent physician who is an expert on conditions of the mind. There is a fourth man with them who appears to be asleep. The three other men, confessing to various degrees of insomnia, talk throughout the journey. Their conversation covers the idea that a body can house more than one soul and Dr Clark cites the case of a French girl called Felicie Bault. She was a Brittany peasant who, at the age of five, lost her parents when her father in a drunken rage strangled her mother, and he was then transported for life. She was taken into the care of a Miss Slater, an English woman, who ran a charity orphanage in the area. Felicie was slightly backward and brutish- looking and Miss Slater had an uphill task to teach her the rudiments of reading and writing. In later years she had one maid's job after another due to her perceived stupidity and laziness. Suddenly, at the age of twenty-two, a change came over her. Following a mental illness she split into three or four distinct personalities. The first was the continuation of her known self but the second was cultured and educated, able to play the piano and speak two foreign languages. The third had the second's education but also knew of the coarser side of life and the less respectable side of Parisian society. The fourth seemed dreamy and pious but was suspected to be the third putting on an act. The change from one personality to another occurred after a severe headache and a deep sleep, and left her with no recollection of the other personalities. The end of the story came when she was discovered dead in bed one morning, somehow having strangled herself with her own hands. At this point, the fourth man in the carriage laughs and joins in the conversation. He speaks with a foreign accent and tells them that Felicie's case is inextricably bound up with that of another girl called Annette Ravel. The two girls and the man himself ‚Äì Raoul Letardeau ‚Äì were together at Miss Slater's orphanage. He was a witness to the bullying hold that Annette had over Felicie, that included an incident when Annette seems to have successfully hypnotised Felicie into carrying out an act of which she had no memory. He also saw how much Felicie hated Annette. The latter was an ambitious girl who was determined to become a famous dancer in Paris. Raoul left the orphanage when work was found for him that took him abroad for five years. Returning to Paris he saw by chance a poster advertising Annette as singing on the stage and met her in her dressing room. She seemed to have achieved her ambitions but Raoul witnessed the unmistakable signs of consumption, and two years later he returned to Miss Slater's orphanage where Annette had retreated, plainly dying but refusing to believe so. Felicie was also there, serving as a maid, as hateful of Annette as ever but still bullied and humiliated by the ruthless woman who seemed to have a strange hold on her. Annette died soon afterwards. When Raoul returned six months later he was told by an amazed Miss Slater of the first symptoms of Felicie's abnormal personality changes. He witnessed one of these and also heard Felicie speak of Annette, \\"taking ... the clothes from your back, the soul from your body\\" and she was plainly in some terror of the dead girl. Nevertheless, she knew that she had strong hands ‚Äì should she wish to escape ... The other three are amazed to hear the story and Raoul emphasises how much Annette longed for her life. The doctor had previously said that the body was a residence for the soul. Raoul compares the situation to finding a burglar in one's home. =The Gypsy= Dickie Carpenter breaks off his recent engagement to Esther Lawes and confides the reason to Mcfarlane, a dour Scot who is the fianc√©e of Rachel Lawes, Esther's younger sister. Dickie, a former naval man, has had an aversion to gypsies since his childhood, when he started to have recurring dreams in which a he would be in a given situation and suddenly feel a presence. When he looked up, a gypsy woman stood there looking at him. The sudden appearance of this woman always unnerved him, although it wasn't until some years after these dreams started that he encountered a real gypsy. This happened on a walk in the New Forest, and she warned him not to take a certain path. He ignored her and the wooden bridge he was crossing broke beneath his weight, casting him into the fast- running stream below and nearly drowning him. These occurrences came back to him when he returned to England and started to see the Lawes family. At one dinner party he saw a woman called Alistair Haworth whom he seemed to see in his own eyes as wearing a red scarf on her head, just like the gypsy of his dreams. He walked on the terrace with her after dinner and she warned him not to go back into the house. He did so and found himself falling for Esther Lawes. They became engaged a week later and two weeks after that he again caught sight of Mrs Haworth who once more warned him. He again ignored her and that very night Esther stated that, after all, she didn't love him. The reason he is now confiding in Macfarlane is that he is due for a routine operation, and he thought he saw in one of the nurses in the hospital the image of Mrs Haworth, who warned him not to go ahead with the surgery. Dickie subsequently dies during the operation and some impulse makes Macfarlane go to see Mrs Haworth at her moorland home. There he is surprised to find that her husband is not really suited to such a striking woman as her. The two walk on the moors and Mrs Haworth tells Macfarlane that he too has second sight. For proof, she asks him to look at a rock and he fancies he sees a hollow filled with blood. She tells him it is a sacrificial stone from olden times and he has had his own vision. She confides that she married her husband because she saw some portent hanging over him and wanted to prevent it. She also tells Macfarlane that they won't meet again. Determined to challenge the fates, Macfarlane drives back from his inn to the Haworth's cottage the next day and finds that the lady is dead. She drank something poisonous thinking it was her tonic and her husband is beside himself with grief. Back at his inn, the landlady tells him stories of long-gone ghosts seen on the moor, including a sailor and a gypsy. Macfarlane wonders if they will walk again. =The Lamp= Young widow Mrs Lancaster takes a lease on an empty house that sits in a square in an old cathedral town. Suspicious of the extremely low rent, she correctly guesses that the house is haunted and pushes the agent for details. He reluctantly tells her the version of the story that he has heard, about a man called Williams living there some thirty years ago with his young son. Williams went up to London for the day and, being a wanted man on the run, was arrested and jailed by the police. His young son was left to fend for himself in the house but died of starvation. The story goes that the boy's sobbing as he waits for his father to return can sometimes be heard. Mrs Lancaster soon moves into the house with her elderly father, Mr Winburn, and her lively young son, Geoffrey. Mr Winburn knows that the house is haunted and hears another set of footsteps on the stairs following his grandson down. He also has a disturbing dream that he is in a town populated by no one but children who are begging him to know if he has \\"brought him\\". In addition, he overhears the servants gossiping about hearing a child cry. Somewhat oblivious to this, Geoffrey nevertheless asks his startled mother if he can play with the little boy that he sometimes sees watching him, but Mrs Lancaster brusquely stops all such talk. A month later, Geoffrey starts to fall ill and even his mother begins to hear the sobs of the other little boy with whom they seem to share the house. The doctor confesses to his grandfather that there is little they can do as Geoffrey's lungs were never strong. One night, Geoffrey dies and his mother and grandfather suddenly hear the sound of the other child's joyous laughter and the receding sound of two pairs of footsteps. The little boy has a playmate at last. =Wireless= Mary Harter, an old lady in her seventies, has a consultation with her doctor, who advises her that she has something of a weak heart and should avoid undue exertion to ensure many more years of life. Dr Meynall also tells Mrs Harter's beloved resident nephew, Charles Ridgeway, of the advice he has given, adding that Mrs Harter should be cheerfully distracted and avoid brooding. To this end, Charles persuades his aunt to have a radio installed. She resists at first, but quickly comes to enjoy the programmes that are broadcast. One evening, when Charles is out with friends, the radio suddenly emits the voice of her dead husband, Patrick, who tells her that he is coming for her soon. Although naturally shocked, Mrs Harter remains composed but thoughtful. Some days later the radio set emits a similar message, and the old lady decides to ensure that her affairs are in order. She makes sure that Elizabeth, her maid, knows where her burial requests are kept, and decides to increase the amount she has left her in her will from fifty to one hundred pounds. To accomplish this, she writes to her lawyer and asks him to send her the will that he has in his possession. Mrs Harter is somewhat startled that day at lunch when Charles comments that, when he was coming up the drive of the house the previous evening, he thought he saw a face at an upstairs window, and realised afterwards that it resembled a portrait in a little-used room that he has since found out is that of Patrick Harter. The latter's widow looks on this as further proof that her time is near. That evening, Mrs Harter again hears a message through the radio from Patrick, telling her that will be coming for her at half-past nine on Friday night. She writes a note detailing what she has heard as proof, should she die at that time, that it is possible to receive messages from the afterlife. She gives this to Elizabeth to pass on to the doctor in the event of her death. On the Friday night in question, she sits in her room with the radio switched on and the will in her hand as she peruses its contents, having had fifty pounds in cash withdrawn from the bank to supplement the amount bequeathed to Elizabeth. She hears the noise of a step outside her room and staggers to her feet, dropping something from her fingers as the door swings open and she sees her dead husband's bewhiskered figure standing before her. She collapses and is found an hour later by Elizabeth. Two days later the maid passes the note to the doctor, who dismisses it all as hallucinations. Charles agrees, not wanting to spoil things now that his plan appears to be reaching fruition. Having safely disconnected the wire from the radio set to his bedroom, and burnt the false whiskers he wore on the night of his aunt's death, he looks forward to the reading of the will and inheriting his aunt's money ‚Äì a sum desperately needed to stave off possible imprisonment as a result of his business misdeeds. He receives a shock when his aunt's lawyer calls and tells him that he posted the will on to the dead lady at her request. It can no longer be found among her papers, and Charles realises that, as she fell dying, the will she was holding in her fingers dropped into the fire. No other copy exists, and therefore a former will comes into effect. This one left Harter's fortune to a niece (Charles's cousin) Miriam, who had proved unsatisfactory to her aunt for marrying a man of whom her aunt did not approve. Charles receives a second shock when the doctor telephones him to say that the results of the autopsy prove that his aunt's heart was in a worse condition than he thought, and there is no way she could have lived more than two months at the outside. Charles angrily realises he need never have set up his elaborate stunt. =The Witness for the Prosecution= A solicitor, Mr Mayherne, interviews his latest client in his office: Leonard Vole is a young man who has been arrested on the capital charge of the murder of an old lady, Miss Emily French. Vole tells how he met Miss French when he helped her to pick up some parcels she dropped in Oxford Street and, by coincidence, he met her again that night at a party in Cricklewood. She asked him to call at her house and he was ribbed by his friends, who joked that he had made a conquest of a rich, lonely old lady. He did call and struck up a friendship with Miss French, and started to see her on many other occasions at a time when he himself was in low water financially. Vole's story is that Miss French asked him for financial advice, despite the testimony of both her maid, Janet Mackenzie, and Miss French's bankers that the old lady was astute enough herself on these matters. He protests that he never swindled her of a single penny and, if he had been doing so, surely her death would have frustrated his plans? Vole is then staggered when Mayherne tells him that he is the principal beneficiary of Miss French's will, and that Janet Mackenzie swears that her mistress told her that Vole was informed of this change in his fortunes. The facts of the murder are that Janet Mackenzie, on her night off, returned to Miss French's house briefly at half-past-nine and heard voices in the sitting- room. One was Miss French and the other was a man's. The next morning, the body of Miss French was found, killed with a crowbar, and several items had been taken from the house. Burglary was at first suspected, but Miss Mackenzie's suspicions of Vole pointed the police in his direction and led eventually to his arrest. Vole, though, is delighted to hear of Miss Mackenzie's testimony about the visitor at nine-thirty, as he was with his wife, Romaine, at the time, and she can provide him with an alibi. Mayherne has already wired Mrs Vole to return from a trip to Scotland to see him, and he goes to her house to interview her. He is surprised to find that she is foreign and is staggered when she cries out her hatred of Vole and that he is not her husband ‚Äì she was an actress in Vienna, and her real husband is still living there, but in an asylum. She alleges that Vole returned from Miss French's an hour later than he claims and, as he is not her lawful husband, she can testify against him in court. Romaine Heilger does indeed appear as a witness for the prosecution at the committal hearing, and Vole is sent for trial. In the intervening period, Mayherne tries to find evidence that will discredit Romaine, but he is unsuccessful until he receives a scrawled and badly spelt letter which directs him to call at an address in Stepney and ask for Miss Mogson if he wants evidence against the \\"painted foreign hussy\\". He does so, and in a reeking tenement slum meets a bent, middle-aged crone of a woman with terrible scars on her face caused by the throwing of sulphuric acid. This attack was carried out by a man by the name of Max with whom Romaine Heilger is now having an affair. Miss Mogson herself was involved with Max many years before, but Romaine took him away from her. Meyherne is passed a series of letters written by Romaine to Max, all dated, which prove that Vole is innocent and that Romaine is lying to be rid of him. Mayherne pays the crone twenty pounds for the letters, which are then read out at the trial. The case against Vole collapses and he is declared \\"Not Guilty\\". Mayherne is delighted at his success, but is suddenly stopped in his tracks when he remembers a curious habit of Romaine's in the witness box when she clenched and unclenched her right hand ‚Äì a habit shared by Miss Mogson in Stepney. Some time later he confronts Romaine with the accusation that she, a former actress, was Miss Mogson, and that the letters were fakes. Romaine confesses: she loves Vole passionately and knew that her evidence would not have been enough to save him ‚Äì she had to provoke an emotional reaction in the court in favour of the accused man. Mayherne is unhappy, protesting that he could have saved the innocent man by more conventional means but Romaine tells him she couldn't have risked it. Mayherne presumes she means that was because she knew Vole was innocent; however, the story ends with Romaine telling the lawyer that she couldn't risk it because Vole was actually guilty all along. She is willing to go to gaol for perjury, but Vole is free. =The Mystery of the Blue Jar= Jack Hartington, a young man of twenty-four years of age, is something of a golf addict and consequently has taken a room at a hotel near to Stourton Heath links so that he can practise for an hour each morning before having to take the train to his dull city job. One morning he is disturbed in mid-swing when he hears a female voice crying out \\"Murder! Help! Murder!\\". Running in the direction of the cry he comes across a quaint cottage, outside of which is a young girl quietly gardening. When questioned, she denies hearing the call for help and seems surprised at Jack's story, referring to him as \\"Monsieur\\". Confused, he leaves her and hunts in the surrounding area for the source of the cry, but in the end gives up. That evening, he looks through the papers to see if any crime has been reported, and repeats this action the next morning ‚Äì a day of heavy rain which cancels his practise routine ‚Äì but still finds nothing. The next day, the strange occurrence of two days earlier is repeated at the same spot and the exact time. Also, once more the girl outside the cottage denies hearing any such sound, and sympathetically enquires if Jack has suffered from shellshock in the past. The third day, he hears the cry again but this time doesn't let on to the girl that this is the case when he passes the cottage, and instead they discuss her gardening. Nevertheless, he is intensely troubled by these occurrences and notices that at the hotel breakfast table he is being watched by a bearded man whom he knows to be called Dr Lavington. Concerned that his sanity is under attack, Jack invites Lavington to join him for a few holes the next morning and the doctor agrees. When the cry is repeated Lavington denies hearing anything. The doctor discusses Jack's possible delusions and they talk of the possibility of some sort of psychic phenomena. He suggests that Jack go off to work as usual while he investigates the history of the cottage. Back at the hotel that night, the doctor tells him what he has learnt: the present occupants, who have been in situ for just ten days, are an elderly French professor with consumption and his daughter. However, a year ago, and several tenants back, the occupants were a strange couple called Turner who seemed to be afraid of something and who suddenly vacated the premises early one morning. Mr Turner has been seen since then but no one seems to have laid eyes on his wife, and the doctor, although arguing against jumping to conclusions, theorises that Jack is receiving some sort of message from the woman. A few days later, Jack receives a visit from the girl at the cottage who introduces herself as Felise Marchaud. She is in terror as, knowing of local gossip that the cottage is haunted, she has started to have a recurring dream of a distressed woman holding a blue jar. The last two night's dreams ended with a voice crying out in the same way as Jack heard on the links. Jack brings Lavington into the discussion and Felise shows them both a rough watercolour she found in the house of a woman holding a blue jar, as in her dream. Jack recognises it as similar to a Chinese one bought by his uncle two months ago, which coincides with the date on which one of the previous tenants left the cottage. Lavington suggests bringing the jar to the cottage, where the three of them will sit with it for the night and see what happens. As Jack's uncle is away he is able to obtain the jar and bring it as requested, and Felise recognises it as the one from the dream. Lavington switches off the lights in the sitting-room and the three of them sit in the darkness at a table on which the jar is placed. After waiting for some time, Jack suddenly starts to choke and falls unconscious. He wakes up in a copse near the cottage, in daylight, to find out from his pocket watch that it is half-past-twelve in the afternoon. He gets no answer at the cottage and goes back to the hotel, where he finds his uncle, newly arrived back from a continental trip. Jack tells him of the events, prompting a cry of outrage from the old man: the blue Chinese jar was a priceless Ming piece and the only one of its kind in the world. Jack rushes to the hotel office and finds that Lavington has checked out, but has left a mocking note for Jack from himself, Felise, and her invalid father, saying that their twelve hours start ought to be ample. =The Strange Case of Sir Arthur Carmichael= Dr Edward Carstairs, a noted psychologist, is called in to investigate the case of Sir Arthur Carmichael, a young man of twenty- three who woke up the previous morning at his estate in Herefordshire with a totally changed personality. Carstairs travels down there with a colleague called Dr Settle, who tells him that he feels that the house could be haunted, and that this phenomenon has connections with the case. The household consists of Sir Arthur, his stepmother, Lady Carmichael, his half-brother of eight years of age, and a Miss Phyllis Patterson to whom Arthur is engaged to be married. As their horse carriage comes up the drive, they see Miss Patterson walking across the lawn, and Carstairs remarks on the cat at her feet which provokes a startled reaction from Settle. Going into the house, they make the acquaintance of Lady Carmichael and Miss Patterson, and again Carstairs causes a reaction when he mentions seeing the cat. They then see their patient and observe his strange behaviour ‚Äì sitting hunched, without speaking, then stretching and yawning and drinking a cup of milk without using his hands. After dinner that night, Carstairs hears a cat meowing, and this sound is repeated during the night outside his bedroom door, but he is unable to find the animal in the house. The next morning he does spy the cat from the bedroom window as it walks across the lawn and straight through a flock of birds which seem oblivious to its presence. He is further puzzled when Lady Carmichael insists that there is no cat in their home. Talking to a footman, Carstairs is informed that there used to be a cat, but it was destroyed a week ago and buried in the grounds. There are further appearances of this apparition, and they realise that it is targeting Lady Carmichael. Carstairs even dreams of the cat the following night: in the dream, he follows it into the library and it shows him to a gap in the volumes on the bookshelf. The next morning, Carstairs and Settle find that there is a book missing from that very spot in the room, and Carstairs glimpses the truth later on in the day when Sir Arthur jumps off his chair when he spots a mouse, and crouches near the wainscoting, waiting for it to appear. That night, Lady Carmichael is badly attacked in her bed by the ghostly creature, and this prompts Carstairs to insist that the body of the dead cat be dug up. It is, and he sees that it is the very creature that he has spotted several times, and a smell shows that it was killed by prussic acid. Several days pass, as Lady Carmichael starts to recover, until one day Sir Arthur falls into the water of the lake. Pulled out onto the bank, he is at first thought to be dead, but he comes round and he has also recovered his personality, but he has no recollection of the intervening days. The sight of him gives Lady Carmichael such a shock that she dies on the spot, and the missing book from the library is found ‚Äì a volume on the subject of the transformation of people into animals. The inference is that lady Carmichael used the book to put Sir Arthur's soul into the cat, then killed it to ensure that her own son would inherit the title and estate. As stated at the beginning of the story, Carstairs later died, and his notes containing the details of the case were subsequently found. =The Call of Wings= Millionaire Silas Hamer and East-End Parson Dick Borrow, after having dinner with their friend Bertrand Seldon, discuss how they are completely opposite in nature, yet both contentedly happy. Hamer is economically happy because he has risen from his poverty-ridden background and built up a fortune, whereas Borrow is spiritually happy because he aids the poor. The two go their separate ways home, and on his way Silas witnesses a homeless man being hit by a bus and killed. Thinking he could have saved the man, Silas goes home mentally troubled. Before he goes through his front door, he hears a legless piper playing a tune that he feels lifts him off the ground in joy. Having heard this tune for several days before falling asleep, he thinks that he floats around his bedroom with joy, witnessing amazing scenes of red sand, and a completely new colour that he nicknames Wing Colour. However, every time something pulls him back to the ground, causing him physical pain. He talks to his friend Seldon about it, to which the nerve-specialist replies he should talk to the piper and ask about the music. Silas confronts the piper, and demands to know who he is. In response, the piper draws a picture of the faun god Pan (who has goat's legs) playing his pipes on a rock, and saying \\"They were evil\\", implying that the piper is the god Pan, who had his legs cut off to appear human. Now addicted to the music, Silas feels that his wealth is the only thing stopping him from reaching true happiness. In response, he donates all of his money to Dick Borrow, so that he can help the whole of East London. Deciding to get the train home, Silas waits on the platform with a homeless man. The man, in a drunken stupor, walks to the edge and accidentally falls off as the train is about to arrive. Remembering the man hit by a bus, Silas pulls the man off the tracks and throws him onto the platform, himself falling onto the tracks in the process. Before he is killed, he briefly hears a piper playing. =The Last Seance= Raoul Daubreuil is a man in France, who is in love with Simone, a medium who has been wearied over the years by all the seances she has performed. They live in a flat, together with their servant Elise. Of all the seances, the strangest were those performed for Madame Exe, a woman who lost her daughter Amelie. In these seances, Amelie's materialisations have been very clear and accurate. However, this day is the day on which she will perform her last seance, and it is for Madame Exe. Arriving in their flat, Raoul comforts Simone and, despite her initial refusal to perform the seance, he convinces her to do it. She is further convinced when Madame Exe arrives, and reminds her of her promise. Upon arriving in the room where the seance will take place, Madame Exe states that she wants to make sure that the last seance is not a scam, and asks to tie Raoul to a chair. He agrees, but tells Madame Exe that the materialisation must not be touched at all, in case Simone is harmed. Madame Exe reluctantly agrees. Simone hides behind a curtain for the seance, and the materialisation of Amelie starts to form from a mist. This materialisation is the most vivid of them all, causing great surprise to Raoul and Madame Exe. However, Madame Exe rushes towards the materialisation and hugs it, causing Simone to scream in pain. Raoul shouts at Madame Exe to stop touching the materialisation, but instead she picks up the ghostly form of Amelie and runs off with it, wanting Amelie to be hers forever. As Raoul attempts to untie his bonds, Simone shrivels and dies. After Raoul unties himself, the tragedy ends with Elise and Raoul crying over the bloodstained corpse of Simone. =SOS= The Dinsmead family, mother Maggie, father, son Johnnie and daughters Charlotte and Magdalen, are about eat supper with cups of tea when they hear a rap the door. Mortimer Cleveland, an authority in mental science, finds himself stranded in the bare Wiltshire downs in the driving rain after a second car tyre puncture within ten minutes of each other. He spots a light in the distance and makes his way to the house of the Dinsmead family. They invite him in, offering freshly made tea and viands. The family seem hospitable but Cleveland feels something is not right. Maggie seems afraid. The two daughters are both pretty but look nothing alike. The daughters are sent upstairs to prepare the room for Cleveland; when he retires he notices the table by his bed is smothered in dust. Written in the dust are three clearly visible letters ‚ÄúSOS‚Äù, confirming his suspicions. The next day Cleveland asks Charlotte if she wrote the sos in his room. She did not, though she feels frightened of the house. Her parents and Magdalen all seem different. Cleveland believes his arriving has upset the family and caused tension. He can understand Charlotte's unease due to her psychic connection, but not that of the others. Johnnie comes into the house, fingers stained, and sits down to breakfast. Cleveland glances at the stained hands. Johnnie explains that he is always messing about with chemicals, much to his father‚Äôs dismay. His father wants him to go in to building. Mr Dinsmead smiles yet Cleveland‚Äôs distrust of the father grows. Again Maggie appears afraid of her husband. Magdalen seems disappointed when Cleveland says he slept well. Cleveland does not want to leave but has no reason to prolong his stay. As he walks past the kitchen window he hears Mr Dinsmead say ‚Äúit‚Äôs a fair lump of money, it is‚Äù. He cannot hear Maggie's reply. Mr Dinsmead adds, ‚Äúnigh on ¬£60,000, the lawyer said‚Äù. Not wanting to eavesdrop, Cleveland makes his way back into the house. That amount of money makes things clearer and uglier. Mr Dinsmead chats with Cleveland about leaving. Cleveland mentions how the two daughters look nothing alike. In a flash of intuition Cleveland remarks that they are not both Dinsmead‚Äôs daughters by birth. Dinsmead admits that one is a foundling. She is unaware but will soon have to know. Cleveland surmises that it must be due to an inheritance. Mr Dinsmead says that they took the child in to help the mother for a consideration. Recently he noticed an advertisement regarding a child whom he strongly believed was Magdalen. He will take Magdalen to London next week. Magdalen‚Äôs father was a wealthy man who had learned of his daughter shortly prior to his death. His money was left to her. Cleveland believes Dinsmead yet thinks there is more to the tale. Cleveland thanks Mrs Dinsmead for her hospitality. She drops a miniature of Charlotte made in the style of 25 years earlier. Cleveland notices her look of fear. He does not ask her about the girls. He leaves the house. A half mile down the road Magdalen appears, wanting to speak with Cleveland. She wrote SOS in the dust, feeling uneasy about the house. Mr and Mrs Dinsmead and Charlotte are different. Johnny is untouched by it all. Magdalen knew everyone was afraid without knowing why. Being a practical person, she does not believe in spirits. Cleveland believes he can figure out what is wrong but needs time to think it through, so he sends Magdalen home. His thoughts come back to Johnny. Cleveland remembers Maggie dropping her cup at breakfast when Johnnie mentioned his interest in chemistry. Mr Dinsmead did not sip his tea. Charlotte arrested her cup the previous evening. Though the tea was hot, Mr Dinsmead emptied the cups saying it was cold. Cleveland recalls reading a paper about a whole family being poisoned by a lad‚Äôs carelessness. A packet of arsenic left in the larder had dripped through on the bread below. It is possible that Mr Dinsmead read the same paper. Cleveland rises to his feet and heads for the cottage. The Dinsmead family are again sitting down for supper of tinned of brawn and tea. Cleveland enters as Maggie pours the tea. Cleveland swiftly he takes a test tube from his pocket and pours some tea from a cup into it. Mr Dinsmead demands to know what Cleveland is doing. Cleveland is certain this is a case of poisoning meant to look accidental with just one person not recovering, and Johnnie would be blamed for carelessness. Cleveland puts tea from a second cup in a second test tube, labelling each: red for Charlotte's cup and blue from Magdalen‚Äôs cup. Cleveland prophesies that Charlotte‚Äôs will contain 4-5 times more poison than Magdalen‚Äôs. Cleveland realises rhat Magdalen is their daughter and that Charlotte is the adopted child. The father planned for Magdalen to inherit. Arsenic in Charlotte's tea was meant to kill her. Maggie cackles ‚Äútea, that‚Äôs what he said not lemonade‚Äù. Magdalen implores Cleveland out of earshot of the others not to divulge this secret. Cleveland says he will keep the phials to safeguard Charlotte now and in the future. Literary significance and reception As this book was not published through the usual channels or available to buy in shops until 1936, there were no reviews of the original publication. Robert Barnard: \\"Mostly semi-supernatural stories. In this setting, Witness for the Prosecution stands out as the jewel it is: surely this is the cleverest short story she wrote. Of the others, the best is perhaps The Call of Wings, but that, depressingly, was one of the very first things she wrote (pre-First World War). In this mode she got no better.\\"Barnard, Robert.

According to the tale, the dog chased after thieves who had stolen from the merchant, leading the merchant to free him and return to his master. The Brahui man thought the dog escaped and so was angry with the dog for his disobedience.

In 1843, Achterfeldt incurred suspension from his professorial chair rather than sign the declaration of faith required by the Coadjutor Archbishop Johannes von Geissel of Cologne. Though Hermesianism lost ground and finally disappeared during the revolution of 1848, Achterfeldt clung to his views.

Mandate The Port of Liverpool police is accountable to the Department for Transport. Its officers receive their long service and good conduct medals from the department. Role, function and organisation The Port of Liverpool Police is established under the Mersey Docks and Harbour (Police) Order 1975. This legislation sets out that constables of the force hold the full powers of the office of constable within the port police area, which is defined as the port and any place within 1 mile of the limits of the port. The Marine Navigation Act 2013 provides a limited extension to this jursidiction if a Chief Constable of a police area consents. This allows port police officers to use police powers in relation port area policing matters anywhere in the police area where consent has been granted - it does not grant full police powers in relation to non port policing matters. As of July 2014, Port of Liverpool Police were applying to the Chief Constable of Merseyside for such consent within Merseyside police area. The force employs under 50 police officers, of whom five comprise the criminal investigation department.

The dock has had a dedicated police force throughout its history, though not always constantly: * From 1811- 37, the Liverpool Dock Police patrolled much the same area until its merger with the Liverpool Borough Police Force * In 1852, 40 officers were transferred to the Liverpool Fire Brigade for the purpose of policing the dockshttp://www.merseyfire.gov.uk/aspx/pages/history/history.aspx * In 1865 the River Mersey Police took responsibility for policing these areas until 1920, after which they were policed by territorial forces * In 1975, with the passing of the above Statutory Instrument, the current body was formed. It became fully operational in July 1976http://www.portofliverpool.police.uk/ The Manchester Ship Canal had a separate police force, the Manchester Ship Canal Police, from its founding in 1893 until 1993. Jurisdiction The force has jurisdiction over the whole of the Port of Liverpool as defined by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Act 1971 and its amendments. It also polices the Manchester Ship Canal. However Merseyside Police, as the territorial police force with statutory responsibility for policing the whole of Merseyside has concurrent jurisdiction in the port area.

It stars Julia Vysotskaya and Sultan Islamov and features a number of cameo appearances by Bryan Adams, with the music composed by Eduard Artemyev. Distinctly anti-war, unbiased and controversial in Russia, House of Fools is a bizarre blend of black comedy, touching drama, horrific warfare and subtly disturbing psychological content. Plot The film tells the story of a psychiatric hospital in the Russian republic of Ingushetia on the border with war-torn republic of Chechnya in 1996. With the medical staff vanishing to apparently find help, the patients are left to their own endeavors. Zhanna (Yuliya Vysotskaya), a young woman, lives in the belief that the pop star Bryan Adams is her fianc√©, that he is off on tour and will, at some point in the future, come to take her away with him. Zhanna is sort of the ad hoc keeper of peace, happiness and control of the others; she attempts to help curb some of the other patients exuberant impulses. Blissfully unaware of the terror of the war, the patients stick it out in the hospital. Their guests include a group of Chechen rebels, one of whom, Ahmed (Sultan Islamov), gives Zhanna the idea that he will marry her. At this point Zhanna falls in love with Ahmed. She goes back to the \\"House\\" where, with the help of her fellow residents, she prepares for her marriage to Ahmed. From this point on Zhanna prepares for and expects to be swept away by Ahmed. Her hopes do not come to fruition and Ahmed and Zhanna part ways. Zhanna returns to the \\"House\\" in order to resume her life there. The story was partially inspired by the real- life tragedy of the psychiatric hospital in Shali, Chechnya, which was abandoned by the personnel during the Russian bombing campaign and in which many patients subsequently died from attacks and neglect.Bryan Adams rocks way into Kremlin with film role‚Äôn‚Äô roll The story also mirrors the plot of Philippe de Broca's 1967 French cult classic film King of Hearts (Le Roi de coeur, starring Alan Bates) about the inmates of an asylum abandoned by the staff during World War I who take over the neighboring town. The two films even share similarities in their conclusion, with a soldier taking refuge from the insanity of war in the asylum when it returns to normal. Although there are some similar aspects to King Of Hearts, the difference in the two films is that the inmates/patients in King of Hearts take on the various personalities of the town folk; mayor, baker, prostitute, etc. Selected cast *Julia Vysotskaya as Zhanna *Sultan Islamov as Ahmed *Yevgeni Mironov as Russian officer *Stanislav Varkki as Ali *Bryan Adams as Himself *Cecilie Thomsen as Lithuanian sniper *Pavel Grachev as Himself (archival footage) * Vladimir Fyodorov as Karlusha * Maria Politseymako as Vika The film also features several genuine mental patients alongside actors.

Giles Fletcher, The History of Russia titlepage, 2nd Ed. (1643) Giles Fletcher was the son of Richard Fletcher, vicar of Bishop's Stortford. Fletcher was born in Watford, Hertfordshire. He spent his early life at Cranbrook before entering Eton College in about 1561. From there, Fletcher continued his education at King's College, Cambridge, where he was appointed a fellow in 1568 and gained his B.A. in the academic year 1569-70. Studying Greek and poetry, Fletcher contributed to the translation of several of Demosthenes' orations. On 22 March 1572, Fletcher became a lecturer in King's and held this position until March the following year, until he became a lecturer in Greek, a position which he held until Michaelmas term 1579. Continually rising within the academia, Fletcher rose to dean of arts, the highest position he was to attain at Kings, in 1580-81. However, this would not last long, for he decided to marry, forcing him to give up his fellowship. On 16 January, in his father's church, he married Joan Sheafe. Returning to Cambridge later, he received his Doctor of Civil Law degree. After attaining his law degree, the family settled back in Cranbrook, where once again the family was united. On 8 April 1582, Giles and Joan's first child, Phineas, was baptized. During the same year, Giles was made chancellor of the diocese of Sussex. In 1584, Fletcher was elected to the parliament which began on 23 November, for Winchelsea, one of the Cinque Ports. It was at this point that the Fletchers would permanently call London home. During his stint in Parliament, Fletcher served on three committees. In 1586, Fletcher was appointed as the Remembrancer of the City of London, an office which he held until 1605. In 1588 he was an ambassador to Russia to reestablish the treaty with tsar Feodor I of Russia. Fletcher published a treatise, Of the Russe Common Wealth (1591). The treaty to be reestablished was primarily concerning the English trade, but before he departed Queen Elizabeth made him a Master of Requests. Fletcher's account gives a vivid description of the Russian world pre-1600. He is best known for his sonnet Licia. He is the father of the poet Giles Fletcher, the Younger.

Rapp is an American beverage inventor best known for inventing and marketing high-caffeine Jolt Cola.* In 1985, C. J. Rapp developed Jolt Cola, which contains 72 milligrams of caffeine, which is the maximum amount permitted by the US Food and Drug Administration. He attended McQuaid Jesuit High School in Rochester, New York. As a sociology major at SUNY Potsdam, Rapp noticed that students concocted beverages to help them stay awake to finish term papers, complete research projects, or study for exams. At a time when beverage producers were promoting the idea that less is better - that they contained either zero or less caffeine, sugar, or calories - Rapp promoted his cola by emphasizing that it had twice the caffeine found in other colas. In the mid-1980s the slogan on every bottle and can of Jolt read \\"Twice the Caffeine.\\" The approach worked and gave the new product high visibility. Jolt soon appeared on the David Letterman show, Good Morning America and CNN. The maverick cola quickly found its niche market. Rapp slowly began expanding his product line, which now includes Blu Botl, DNA, Martinelli‚Äôs, Pirate‚Äôs Keg, First Tee, and XTC.

After the armistice was signed in 1949, he moved to the United States in 1950 and attended Brandeis University, graduating with a B.A. in 1954, and received his Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1958. He remained at Harvard to teach government for two years and then worked as a research fellow at the university's Center for Middle East Studies. He became director of the Center for Middle East Studies and was also at that time an adviser to the White House on Middle East issues. He was a professor in Harvard's Government department until his retirement in 2002. Scandal In the early 1980s, it came to light that he had accepted large sums of funding from the CIA without disclosing the fact to the university. According to Zachary Lockman, > The scandal erupted when it became known that Safran had taken $45,700 from > the Central Intelligence Agency to fund a major international conference he > was hosting at Harvard on \\"Islam and Politics in the Contemporary Muslim > World\\"‚Äîa hot topic at the time and one of obvious interest to the CIA.

After the ensuing scandal was extensively covered in the Harvard Crimson and the Boston Globe, he resigned his position as the head of the Middle East Center. He retired as a professor from Harvard in 2002, and died of cancer in 2003 at the age of 77. Honors Safran had been honored with fellowships from Harvard, Yale and Princeton Universities, from the Sheldon, Guggenheim, Rockefeller and Ford Foundations, and from the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences.

Early life George Thorn (junior) was born in Sydney, New South Wales, a son of George Thorn (senior) and his wife Jane (n√©e Handcock). His father was one of the founders of the city of Ipswich and a founding Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly representing the seat of West Moreton. George Thorn (junior) was schooled at The King's School, Parramatta. He attended the University of Sydney and was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1858. His sister Jane Thorn married George Harris, a Member of the Queensland Legislative Council in 1860. The couple lived for 27 years in the now heritage-listed Newstead House in Brisbane, where their parties were the highlight of Brisbane society. Political life At the 1867 colonial election, Thorn followed in his father's footsteps by being elected a Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly in the seat of West Moreton, which he held until the 1873 election. Following that, he represented the seat of Fassifern from 25 November 1873 (the 1873 Queensland state election) until he resigned on 9 January 1874 in order to be appointed to the Queensland Legislative Council on 9 January 1874. His brother John Thorn won the resulting by-election in Fassifern on 24 January 1874. During Thorn's time on the Legislative Council, he was the Government's representative in the Council. He also held the role of Queensland Postmaster-General (9 January 1874 to 8 July 1876). On 14 June 1876, Arthur Macalister, member for Ipswich, resigned. Although the Legislative Council was a lifetime appointment, Thorn resigned on 16 June 1876 to successfully contest the seat of Ipswich at a by- election on 20 June 1876. Thorn became Premier of Queensland and Secretary for Public Works and Mines on 5 June 1876. However, he resigned from these roles on 8 March 1877, but remained in the ministry of his successor, John Douglas as Secretary for Public Works from 8 March 1877 to 7 November 1877 and then as Secretary for Public Lands and Mines from 7 November 1877 to 6 February 1878. On 14 February 1878, Thorn married Celia Constance Maude Uniacke, daughter of Richard Uniacke of Melbourne, at \\"Ellengowan\\" on the Darling Downs. Thorn resigned from the seat of Ipswich on 18 February 1878. John MacFarlane won the resulting by-election on 7 March 1878. Thorn became Queensland commissioner to the 1878 Paris Exposition. On his return from Europe, on 17 April 1879 by another by-election, he successfully contested the seat of Northern Downs and held it until the 1883 election in September. On 19 July 1887, Alfred Midgley, the member for Fassifern, resigned. Thorn won the resulting by-election on 4 August 1887. He held the seat until the 1888 election. On 6 May 1893 (the 1893 Queensland state election), Thorn was elected again in Fassifern. He held the seat until 11 March 1902 when he was defeated in the 1902 election by Thomas de Montmorency Murray-Prior. He had no further involvement in politics after that. Later life On 15 January 1905, George Thorn died from heart failure at his home at Booval, Queensland. He was buried in the Anglican section of Ipswich General Cemetery. Legacy The gold mining town Thornborough was named after him.

It first aired in the NBC Saturday morning lineup on January 12, 1974, and was written by Stephen Kandel who also wrote the earlier story \\"Mudd's Passion\\" and worked on the two Original Series \\"Mudd\\" episodes.This story was expanded into a novelette by science-fiction author Alan Dean Foster as part of the collection, Star Trek Log Five (1975). In this form, the story is named simply \\"Jihad\\", and M3 Green is phonetically rendered as \\"Em-Three-Green\\" while Laura became \\"Lara\\". (). Set in the 23rd century, this series follows the further adventures of the crew of the Federation starship Enterprise. In this episode, Captain Kirk (voiced by William Shatner) and his first officer, Spock (voiced by Leonard Nimoy), become involved in a secret quest to retrieve a stolen artifact and prevent a warrior race from attacking the galaxy. Plot On stardate 5683.1, the Federation starship Enterprise arrives at the Vedala asteroid, where Captain Kirk and First Officer Spock have been summoned to take part in the latest of several failed secret quests to learn about a stolen religious artifact, the \\"Soul of the Skorr\\", the theft of which could ignite a galactic holy war. Joining Kirk and Spock is a team of specialists called in to help recover the item, which has been hidden on a very unstable and dangerous planet. The focal point of the mission as the primary stakeholder is \\"Tchar\\", the hereditary prince of the Skorr. The muscle of the team is provided by \\"Sord\\", a reptilian with great strength. An insectoid named \\"M3 Green\\" is a master lockpick.Although the exact species of \\"M3 Green\\" is never mentioned during the episode, the Starfleet Corps of Engineers novels gives the name of the species as the \\"Nasat\\" (one of the Nasat characters in the novels is named \\"P8 Blue\\"). The team is rounded out by the huntress \\"Lara\\", a humanoid who is an accomplished tracker with an impeccable sense of direction, especially when she finds a man to be attractive.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0832422/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast Kirk and Spock soon learn that one member of the party is a saboteur. It seems that Tchar has stolen the artifact himself in an effort to return his people to their warrior ways. When the mission is completed, Tchar is held captive as insane, although with good prospects of rehabilitation. The Vedala states that they will eventually forget that these events ever happened. Kirk and Spock return to the Enterprise, where it seems that hardly any time at all has passed since their beam down to begin the mission. Production Science fiction author David Gerrold, who wrote or co-wrote a number of live-action (\\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\") and animated (\\"More Tribbles, More Troubles\\", \\"Bem\\") Star Trek episodes, voices the character M3 Green for this episode. Actor James Doohan voices Sord and Tchar, in addition to his usual role as Chief Engineer Scott. Although given the standard screen credit in the main title, Nichelle Nichols (Lt. Uhura) is not part of this episode. Since she was dealing with pregnancy sickness, Majel Barrett was also absent, so Filmation mainstay Jane Webb stepped in to voice all the women characters. Reception Mark A. Altman and Ed Gross said the episode \\"most probably resembles Saturday morning fare -- though with Trek's traditionally heady bent.\\" They allowed that some of the banter between Kirk and the huntress Laura, who flirts with the captain in a Brooklyn accent, is amusing, and that the null gravity combat is clever. They concluded \\"The Jihad\\" to be a successful break from typical Trek episode.

The charge numbers for ions (and also subatomic particles) are written in superscript, e.g. Na+ is a sodium ion with charge number positive one (an electric charge of one elementary charge). Atomic numbers (Z) are a special case of charge numbers, referring to the charge number of an atomic nucleus, as opposed to the net charge of an atom or ion. All particles of ordinary matter have integer-value charge numbers, with the exception of quarks, which cannot exist in isolation under ordinary circumstances (the strong force keeps them bound into hadrons of integer charge numbers).  Charge numbers in chemistry  Charge number or valenceDynamic Systems in Neuroscience by Izhikevich of an ion is the coefficient that, when multiplied by the elementary charge, gives the ion's charge. For example, the charge on a chloride ion, mathrm{Cl}^-, is -1 cdot e, where e is the elementary charge. This means that the charge number for the ion is -1. z is used as the symbol for the charge number. In that case, the charge of an ion could be written as Q = z e. The charge number in chemistry normally relates to an electric charge. This is a property of specific subatomic atoms. These elements define the electromagnetic contact between the two elements. A chemical charge can be found by using the periodic table. An element's placement on the periodic table indicates whether its chemical charge is negative or positive. Looking at the table, one can see that the positive charges are on the left side of the table and the negative charges are on the right side of the table. Charges that are positive are called cations. Charges that are negative are called anions. Elements in the same group have the same charge. A group in the periodic table is a term used to represent the vertical columns. The noble gases of the periodic table do not have a charge because they are nonreactive. Noble gases are considered stable since they contain the desired eight electrons. The other atoms or ions have charges because they are very reactive and want to react with another atom or ion to become stable. When elements are bonded, they can either be bonded by ionic bonding or covalent bonding. When elements bond between positive and negative charged atoms, their charges will be switched and carried down on the other element to combine them equally. This is shown below. Using the chart provided, if ammonium with a plus 1 charge is combined with an acetate ion with a negative 1 charge, the charges will be cancelled out, shown in the figure below. :NH4+ + C2H3O2^- -> NC2H7O2 Another example below. :2 NH4+ + CO3^2- -> (NH4)2CO3 both NC2H7O2 and (NH4)2CO3 are salts. Charge numbers also help to determine other aspects of chemistry. One example is that someone can use the charge of an ion to find the oxidation number of a monatomic ion. For example, the oxidation number of Li+ is +1. This helps when trying to solve oxidation questions. A charge number also can help when drawing Lewis dot structures. For example, if the structure is an ion, the charge will be included outside of the Lewis dot structure. Since there is a negative charge on the outside of the Lewis dot structure, one electron needs to be added to the structure. If the charge was positive, an electron would be lost and taken away.  Charge numbers in nuclear and hadron physics  For an atomic nucleus, which can be regarded as an ion having stripped off all electrons, the charge number is identical with the atomic number Z, which corresponds to the number of protons in ordinary atomic nuclei. Unlike in chemistry, subatomic particles with electric charges of two elementary charges (e.g. some delta baryons) are indicated with a superscript \\"++\\" or \\"‚àí‚àí\\". In chemistry, the same charge numbers are usually indicated as superscript \\"+2\\" or \\"‚àí2\\".  Charge numbers in elementary-particle physics  In particle physics, the charge number is a (derived) flavor quantum number. For color-charged particles like quarks and hypothetical leptoquarks, the charge number is a multiple of 1/3.

Collectively, the RFSUs form the Regional Force Surveillance Group commanded by a Colonel based at the 2nd Division Headquarters in Sydney. The RFSUs conduct regular operational patrols during peacetime, and are composed primarily of Reservists who live within the area of operations. There are currently three battalion-sized RFSUs: * North-West Mobile Force (NORFORCE) (responsible for the Northern Territory and Kimberley region of Western Australia) * The Pilbara Regiment (responsible for the Pilbara region of Western Australia) * 51st Battalion, Far North Queensland Regiment (responsible for North Queensland) Role NORFORCE's area of operations The Pilbara Regiment's area of operations 51 FNQR's area of operations The RFSUs are unique unconventional units whose mission is to conduct long range reconnaissance and surveillance patrols in the sparsely populated and remote regions of northern Australia. Unlike most Australian Army units, the RFSUs are on a permanent operational footing, conducting real patrols with real world objectives during peacetime. The primary reason for the RFSUs existence is national defence through remote surveillance, but the nature of their work means patrols can often provide valuable intelligence to civilian agencies such as Australian Customs, State and Federal police forces, and the intelligence community. Prior to the existence of the RFSUs, surveillance in the remote north was carried out by the Special Air Service Regiment (SASR). The SASR's primary specialty as reconnaissance and surveillance soldiers made them ideally suited to the task. However, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the SASR responded to the changing global security environment and identified counter-terrorism as the second area that they needed to specialise in. This, coupled with the possibility of overseas deployments, meant that the SASR would be hard pressed to maintain an effective domestic reconnaissance force whilst also fulfilling their other (new) roles. The basic concept was to raise and train a reconnaissance and surveillance unit that would take over the SASR's tasks in northern Australia. Because the RFSUs receive SASR training support, the small unit tactics of the two units are similar and there are regular personnel exchanges - especially with regard to SASR personnel being posted to RFSU to keep the SASR 'up to speed' with the skills required to train indigenous peoples in guerilla warfare. However, the RFSU also are commanded and staffed by Royal Australian Regiment personnel. The command concepts, training continuum and even the capacity of the RFSU to focus on the generation of sustained and widespread operations in remote Australia differentiates the RFSU distinctly from the SASR. Each patrolling task is different, and RFSU patrols tailor their plans to the task they have been assigned. Sometimes a patrol will infiltrate the area of operations by small boat at night, hide their boats, carry out their tasks and then exfiltrate the same way. At other times they may be airlifted in by chopper or small aircraft or perhaps a patrol will choose to drive in, hide their vehicles or just jump out the back of a moving vehicle and disappear into the bush. To be effective, RFSU patrols must remain completely undetected, so bushcraft skills, particularly camouflage and concealment, are very important to the RFSU patrolman. In the event of a small or large scale insurgency in the north, the RFSUs role would be to detect enemy landings, especially near the important economic and defence infrastructure in their areas of operation. In the extremely unlikely event of an invasion of northern Australia the RFSUs would operate in a 'stay-behind' capacity. Patrols remaining in the field deep behind enemy lines would inevitably end up supplementing their diets from the land in order to survive and complete their mission as the first line of defence for continental Australia. Tasks for such a scenario are reporting on enemy movements, calling in airstrikes, killing and capturing the enemy in close quarter combat or sniping roles, demolition by explosive or sniping to impede enemy advance, and disrupting enemy supply lines for as long as possible. History The genesis of the RFSU concept lies in the unit which was formed to patrol northern Australia during the Second World War. The 2/1st North Australia Observer Unit conducted horse and vehicle mounted patrols across northern Australia with the goal of observing and reporting on enemy movements on land, sea and in the air. These patrols were conducted in extremely harsh conditions, with little or no support or resupply - so this unit needed men who were very resourceful, independent, motivated and positive. Many of the soldiers from the NAOU later went on to join Z Special Unit and fought (and died) conducting commando operations against the Japanese in South East Asia. While the concept of the North Australia Observer Unit proved very successful, the Army's role in patrolling northern Australia ceased with the disbandment of 2/1 NAOU in 1945. Following the Australian withdrawal from Vietnam the national defence strategy changed from forward defence through stationing military units in South East Asia to the defence of continental Australia. In line with this shift, the Australian military began to explore new ways of patrolling the Australian coastline. In the late 1970s the Special Air Service Regiment conducted a number of exercises in northern Western Australia which aimed to assess the ability of unconventional units to patrol the long and sparsely populated coastline of northern Australia. These trials indicated that recce patrols, operating in much the same way as an SAS patrol could provide a very useful capability. Following this finding, it was decided in the early 1980s to establish three battalion-sized Regional Force Surveillance Units in northern Australia. These units would be manned by Army reservists who, it was hoped, would be able to use their local knowledge to enhance the effectiveness of the units' patrols. Each RFSU was formed by expanding and re-designating an independent rifle company: * NORFORCE was raised from the 7th Independent Rifle Company on 1 July 1981 * The Pilbara Regiment was raised from the 5th Independent Rifle Company on 26 January 1985 * 51st Battalion, Far North Queensland Regiment was raised from the 51st Independent Rifle Company, The Royal Queensland Regiment on 1 October 1987 Since their establishment the RFSUs have proven highly successful and have made a significant contribution to the security of northern Australia. All three RFSUs contribute patrols to Operation Resolute, the Australian Defence Force's contribution to patrolling Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone and coastline. The RFSUs were incorporated into the 6th Brigade on 1 March 2010 as part of its re-raising. On 1 September 2014, they were transferred to the 2nd Division. As of December 2014, the RFSUs had 200 Active and 1,350 Reserve personnel. On 4 October 2018, all three RFSUs were grouped together as part of a new formation headquarters, the Regional Force Surveillance Group. The new formation came into being at a parade held at Larrakeyah Barracks in Darwin. Indigenous Australians and the RFSUs Historically, the units draw on a long-time practice in Australia of using Aboriginal trackers. Indigenous skills of patrol, pathfinding and outback survival have a proud record in Australia assisting colonial and modern-day law enforcement and military operations. As Army Reserve units, the make-up of the RFSUs' personnel reflects the ethnic make-up of their area of operations. As a result, a high proportion the RFSUs' personnel are Indigenous Australians, making the Australian Army one of the largest single employers of Indigenous Australians. NORFORCE has the highest proportion of Indigenous soldiers, with 60% of the unit's personnel being Indigenous. About 30% of 51 FNQR's personnel are Torres Strait Islanders or other Indigenous Australians. The Pilbara Regiment reportedly has relatively few Indigenous soldiers. The RFSUs are highly regarded by many Indigenous community leaders as the units provide employment and training opportunities to young Indigenous people living in remote communities.

This 67 mile stretch of the Colorado River flows past Boulder City, Nelson, Searchlight, Cottonwood Cove, Cal-Nev-Ari, and Laughlin to the west in Nevada and Willow Beach and Bullhead City to the east in Arizona. A maximum width of 4 miles wide and an elevation of , Lake Mohave encompasses 28,260 acres of water. As Lake Mead lies to the north of the Hoover Dam, Lake Mohave and adjacent lands forming its shoreline are part of the Lake Mead National Recreation Area administered by the U.S. National Park Service. Resorts and recreation There are three resorts on Lake Mohave: Katherine Landing and Willow Beach in Arizona and Cottonwood Cove in Nevada. Katherine Landing and Cottonwood Cove resorts offer lodging, RV parks with utility hook-ups, campgrounds, a restaurant a store, launch ramps, and marinas with gas docks. Popular recreational activities in Lake Mohave are swimming, kayaking, fishing, boating, and skiing. There are numerous boat and personal watercraft rental options as well as kayaking, scuba diving, and fishing supplies in Bullhead City, which borders the southernmost point of Lake Mohave. Bullhead City, Arizona, and Laughlin, Nevada adjoin the National Recreation Area and offer a wide variety of lodging, dining and shopping options to visitors headed to Lake Mohave's largest and busiest marina, Katherine Landing. Lake Mohave offers year-round recreational opportunities with water temperatures warm enough for swimming all year long. Its clear water caters to boaters, swimmers, and fishermen while its desert rewards hikers, wildlife photographers, and roadside sightseers. It is also home to thousands of desert plants and animals, adapted to survive in an extreme place where rain is scarce and temperatures soar.. Several mapped hiking trails offer options for hikers of all skill levels. =Scuba diving= Lake Mead National Recreation Area, which encompasses Lake Mead, Lake Mohave and portions of the Colorado River in the lower Grand Canyon to the north and below Davis Dam to the south, offers good diving opportunities for both novice and advanced divers. At Lake Mohave, divers can explore Black Canyon, which has excellent diving conditions. Advanced divers can check out Ringbolt Rapids, where swift water makes for an additional challenge. Work Barge on the Arizona side has a 38-foot tow barge that sank in 1946. Cabinsite Point has two boat wrecks to view. =Personal Watercraft= PWCs allowed to be operated within Lake Mead National Recreation Area, which encompasses Lake Mead and Lake Mohave, include all PWCs with four-stroke-powered engines, and two-stroke engines meeting EPA 2006 emission standards. As of December 31, 2012 many two- stroke personal watercraft are no longer allowed to operate within Lake Mead National Recreation Area. These include any PWC with a carbureted two-stroke engine. Enforcement began January 1, 2013 as part of a ten-year phase-in, based on the final rule to prohibit these PWCs being approved in April 2003. =Hot Springs= The volcanic origin of Black Canyon and Cottonwood Valley has resulted in a number of hot springs along the northern portion of Lake Mohave. Gold Strike Hot Springs is located very close to the shore which is accessible from a trailhead 1.2 miles south of the Hoover Dam. These springs are also available from the Gold Strike Hot Springs Trail Head two miles east of the Hoover Dam in Boulder City, Nevada. Due to the easy two mile hike from public parking and consistent pools, these springs are frequently visited. Two Mile Hot Springs and Arizona Hot Springs are within a few miles of this same area and offer a more private experience. Fish species View across the surface of Lake Mohave. =Native fish= * Razorback sucker (endangered) * Bonytail chub (endangered) =Introduced fish= * Rainbow trout * Largemouth bass * Smallmouth bass * Striped bass * Crappie * Sunfish * Channel catfish * Common carp * Threadfin shad Fish enhancement projects The non-native sport fishery in Lake Mohave is enhanced by a Nevada Division of Wildlife program which places artificial habitat bundles in coves around the reservoir. The habitats are composed primarily of bundled salt cedar trees attached to wooden pallets. When placed in the water, the structures create cover for sport fish. Additionally, Lake Mohave contains one of the largest and most genetically diverse population of razorback sucker remaining in the wild. Each spring, a multi-agency group of fish biologists use underwater lights to collect approximately 30,000 razorback sucker larvae along the shore of Lake Mohave, which would otherwise be eaten by introduced fishes. Larvae are then transported by boat to Willow Beach National Fish Hatchery where they grow in protected raceways for up to three years. When individuals have reached approximately 14 inches in length, they are released back into Lake Mohave in order to avoid predation by larger, introduced game fish such as striped bass.

From left: Sam Prekop, John McEntire, Archer Prewitt, Doug McCombs (who filled in for Eric Claridge). The Sea and Cake is an American indie rock band with a jazz influence, based in Chicago, Illinois, United States. The group formed in the mid-1990s from members of The Coctails (Archer Prewitt), Shrimp Boat (Sam Prekop and Eric Claridge), and Tortoise (John McEntire); the group's name came from a willful reinterpretation (as the result of an accidental miscomprehension) of \\"The C in Cake\\", a song by Gastr del Sol. Starting with 1997's The Fawn, the group has relied on electronic sound sources, such as drum machines and synthesizers, to color its music, but has retained its distinctive post-jazz combo style. The band has shied away from releasing singles, preferring the album format. Contrary to his multi-instrumentalist role in Tortoise, John McEntire almost exclusively plays drums in The Sea and Cake. Members Sam Prekop, Archer Prewitt, and John McEntire each have released solo albums. The cover art of The Sea And Cake's releases are largely paintings by member Eric Claridge and photographs by Prekop. Prewitt has been involved in publishing his own comic books and doing graphic design. In 1995, the band contributed the song \\"The Fontana\\" to the AIDS benefit album Red Hot + Bothered produced by the Red Hot Organization. The band was on hiatus from 2004 to 2007.

The area supports temperate coniferous forest and temperate broadleaf and mixed forest ecoregion habitats, with an average elevation of above sea level. Ayubia National Park is surrounded by seven major villages and three small towns of Thandiani, Nathiagali and Khanspur. The park has been developed as a resort complex from a combination of four mini resorts of Khaira Gali, Changla Gali, Khanspur and Ghora Dhaka in Galyat. Currently, it is managed by the Wildlife and Parks Department of Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. History Ayubia National Park was established in 1984 in an east corner of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. In 1998 it was expanded form its original size of or to .

The total population of Ayubia and surrounding villages as per a 1996 census is 18,097 people living in 2,311 households. Climate Pipeline Track, Ayubia National Park The climate of the park is cool in the summers, but harsh in the winters. While it remains only placidly hot in May and June, the cold sets in when the monsoons come to lash in late July and early August. In the winters cold increases in severity gradually until the west winds bring rains, which eventually turn into snow. The park remains snow-capped through the later part of winters. *Rainfall: 1,644 mm *Temperature: 3 ¬∞C - 11 ¬∞C Wildlife A panoramic view of Tilla Donga The park holds 104 species of plants. The main floral species are Cedrus deodara, blue pine, yew, silver fir, horse chestnut and oak. Around 21 plants belonging to 19 families are known for their medicinal properties. Many of these are used in treatment of jaundice, stomach ulcers, snake bites, internal infections, diabetes, psoriasis and more. Some plants are said to have anti-carcinogenic effect as well. Also, some are used as biological insecticides and pesticides, mostly due to their insect-repellent nature. The World Wide Fund for Nature has launched an ethno-botanical initiative here \\"to demonstrate the sustainable use of plant resources as a means for protecting biodiversity.\\" The park harbors up to 203 species of birds. Many species of birds, including the golden eagle, the vulture, Eurasian sparrowhawk and the hill pigeon among others can be found here. It is also home to some of the rarer Himalayan pheasant species like the kalij and koklass pheasants. Ayubia National Park supports 31 species of mammals such as the Indian leopard, hill fox and flying squirrel. Among reptiles and amphibians, Kashmir Rock Agama, Striped Grass Skink and Himalayan Pit Viper can also be encountered here. Management The park has been managed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Wildlife Department under the 1975 Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Wildlife Act. The headquarters of the park is at Dunga Gali, which is situated at a distance of 50 km from Abbottabad and 25 km from Murree. Tourism Standing at some 26 kilometers from the tourist hotbed of Murree Hill Station, over 100,000 tourists flock to Ayubia National Park and the places around every year.

Publication history Ravage was created by Stan Lee in 1992 for Marvel's Marvel 2099 imprint. Ravage's first full appearance was in Ravage 2099 #1, which was released alongside other Marvel 2099 universe titles Spider-Man 2099, Doom 2099, and Punisher 2099. Unlike the other titles, Ravage was original, not a re-imagined version of an existing character. The series ran for 33 issues. Fictional character biography Paul-Phillip Ravage was the CEO of ECO, a subsidiary of Alchemax that worked to combat polluters. Ravage's life changed when he was framed for murder in response to questioning the secrets of the company and the violent, often fatal, methods it used. A fugitive armed with a blaster, a cog used as a shuriken, and a kevlar vest, Ravage was the target of both the police and Alchemax. On the lam, Ravage's companions were an orphaned boy named Dack, son of a man his company killed, and an Asian-American woman named Tiana who was originally his secretary. Ravage was targeted for elimination by Anderthorp Henton, and battled a mutroid and ECO security.Ravage 2099 #1 Alongside Dack and Tiana, he battled Alchemax troops.Ravage 2099 #2 As a fugitive, Ravage would find himself traveling from civilization to Hellrock, home of irradiated and mutated outcasts, to become the mutated hero of the Barrio ‚Äî an impoverished community of superhero worshipers located on the outskirts of the city. The despotic ruler of Hellrock, Lord Dethstryk, who planned to invade the rest of the world and destroy all humans, would eventually become Ravage's nemesis. Ravage freed Tiana from Hellrock, and battled Deathstryk and the mutroids, and became contaminated by radiation from Hellrock.Ravage 2099 #3 He battled more mutroids, and was treated by Dr. Ursell. After prolonged exposure to the radiation of Hellrock, Ravage soon developed a new superpower: his hands became radioactive and constantly generated lethal energy. This new power gave Ravage extreme destructive power, but it did not last for very long. Eventually, the radiation devolved his body to a primal beast form, making Ravage far more attuned to the animal world and giving him horn-like protuberances on his head and face; sharp taloned hands and feet; fangs; a long vertical scar on the left side of his face; enhanced senses, strength, and speed; and the ability to regenerate from almost anything. Ravage can also transform back to a human form when necessary.Ravage 2099 #4-5 Alongside Dack and Tiana, he battled the New Atlanteans,Ravage 2099 #6-7 and then Anderthorp Henton.Ravage 2099 #8 His body was then reverted to bestial form by radiation.Ravage 2099 #9 Ravage as a man-beast, in Ravage 2099 #28. Tiana would later become a version of the Norse entity Hel,Ravage 2099 #10 given powers by Alchemax as part of a scheme to control or kill vigilante superheroes, such as Ravage himself.Ravage 2099 #11-13 The two would confront each other, but Tiana recognized her friend and kept herself from killing him.Ravage 2099 #15 Later they both gained new jobs. Ravage a new business style-job, and Tiana destroying old satellites to follow a 'one up, one down' law. The two would temporarily split when Ravage's animal nature caused him to blurt out his opinion of her new powers, specifically that she is wasting them.Ravage 2099 #19 Ravage attempts to control his animal side, but it comes out in various ways. In one instance, he almost transforms in the presence of a business rival. While visiting a zoo full of cloned animals, he roars back at the lions, realizing he is communicating with them about their wild instincts hating their confinement. He comes to accept his animal side better after dealing with an insane hunter and his abused cat-man.Ravage 2099 #21-24 Ravage teams up with a sentient giant bat named Ferra to search out a legendary valley of animal-people. They team up to destroy a reality- manipulating alien, but do not actually find the valley at the time, just a close, other-dimensional copy.Ravage 2099 #25 Ravage eventually returned to Hellrock, along with Ferra and Tiana/Hela.Ravage 2099 #27 There, with the help of Dethstryk's own confidant, the Seeress, Ravage killed Dethstryk and took over Hellrock.Ravage 2099 #28 Ravage (presumably) died after being immersed in liquid adamantium by Doom and sent into space.Ravage 2099 #33 Powers and abilities Ravage gained powers through surgery and being mutated by the radiation of Hellrock, where he battled Deathstryk to free Tiana. Initially, the powers consisted of the ability to fire kinetic bio-energy beams from his hands that were physically taxing on Ravage; however, these powers mutated and Ravage soon became a man-beast. In his new form, Ravage had enhanced strength, speed, senses, durability, and agility, and superhumanly acute senses; in addition to growing horns, fangs, and claws on his hands and feet. Ravage also possessed a healing factor. Ravage formerly wore a vest of unknown 21st century fabric lined with \\"ultimate\\" Kevlar (experimental blaster-proof fabric), molecular gloves (capable of containing the kinetic energy power of Ravage's hands for up to one hour), and an adjustable opti-lens (enabling long-range telescopic and infra-red sight).

It also grows at high elevations in the southern Appalachian Mountains to northern Georgia. Description Acer spicatum is a deciduous shrub or small tree growing to tall, forming a spreading crown with a short trunk and slender branches. The leaves are opposite and simple, long and wide, with 3 or 5 shallow broad lobes. They are coarsely and irregularly toothed with a light green hairless surface and a finely hairy underside. The leaves turn brilliant yellow to red in autumn, and are on slender stalks usually longer than the blade. The bark is thin, dull gray-brown, and smooth at first but becoming slightly scaly. The fruit is a paired reddish samara, long, maturing in late summer to early autumn. Acer spicatum whole tree.jpgFlowering tree Acer spicatum seeds.jpgFruits (samaras) with measurement for scale Distribution and ecology The tree lives in moist woods in rich, well-drained soils on rocky hillsides and along streams. It also grows on ravines, cliff faces, and forested bogs. It colonizes the understory of hardwood forests. Mammals such as moose, deer, beavers, and rabbits browse the bark; ruffed grouse eat the buds.  Uses  The sap is a source of sugar and can be boiled to make maple syrup. The bark contains tannins, which are used in tanning leather. Indigenous peoples infused the piths of young twigs to produce treatments for eye irritation and made poultices from boiled root chips. It is also said to be used to relieve stress in humans.

Jack and Jason Schneider, Have Not Been the Same: The Can-Rock Renaissance 1985-1995. ECW Press. . The label was established in 1983 by the band members of Deja Voodoo, Gerard van Herk and Tony Dewald. It ceased operations in 1990. History The label started by putting out cassette-only releases, and soon began to release full vinyl LPs. As of 2007 none of these releases has ever been re-released on CD. In addition to releasing material from Deja Voodoo, the label was notable for giving early exposure to groups that would later go on to more mainstream success, such as Shadowy Men on a Shadowy Planet and Cowboy Junkies. Their best selling albums were the It Came from Canada compilations, which featured tracks from many Canadian indie artists of the time -- in all, five such compilations were released. None of the album releases made it to mainstream airplay, but regularly charted at various campus radio stations in Canada. The label was retired when the band members of Deja Voodoo turned 30 and left the music business to pursue other careers. The record label was named after a fictional caveman character called Og.

Deosai Plains are situated at an average elevation of 4,114 metres (13,497 ft) above sea level and considered as the second highest plateaus in the world. Etymology Sheosar Lake is in the western part of Deosai National Park. 'Deosai' means 'the land of Giants'. Balti people call this place 'Ghbiarsa' referring to 'Summer's Place' because it is only accessible in summer. Geography Bara Pani is the largest of the rivers that traverse Deosai National Park. The Deosai National Park is located between Kharmang, Astore and Skardu in Gilgit Baltistan (GB), Pakistan. It has an average elevation of above sea level, making the Deosai Plains the second highest plateau in the world after Changtang Tibetan Plateau. The park protects an area of . It is well known for its rich flora and fauna of the Karakoram-West Tibetan Plateau alpine steppe eco-region. In spring, it is covered by sweeps of wildflowers and a wide variety of butterflies. Travel routes to the region Deosai is accessible from Skardu District in the north, Galtari Kharmang District in the south-east and the Astore District in the west. It is also accessible from Mehdiabad via Mehdiabad-Dapa Road. Deosai is located approximately 30 km from Skardu city, which is the shortest route to visit Deosai. Another route is from Astore valley via Chilim. It is also accessible from Shila valley. The people of Galtari travel via Deosai. While it is a National Park, the Gujjar- Bakwarwal travel large distances to utilize the Deosai National Park as grazing lands. There is another route called Burgi la via Tsoq Kachura valley Skardu. Geology and soil The soils of this area are severely eroded, of a coarser nature and mixed with gravel and stones of various materials and sizes. In flat areas between mountains, soil is deep with marshy vegetation.  Fauna and Flora  Several varieties of wildflowers grow on the plains. The Deosai National Park was established in 1993 to protect the survival of the Himalayan brown bear and its habitat. Having long been a prize kill for poachers and hunters, the bear now has a hope for survival in Deosai where its number has increased from only 19 in 1993 to 40 in 2005. In 1993, after playing an instrumental role in the designation of Deosai as a National Park, the Himalayan Wildlife Foundation (formerly the Himalayan Wildlife Project) was founded with a substantial international financial support. The Himalayan Wildlife Foundation ran two park entry check posts and a field research camp in Deosai for approximately ten years. Documentation was completed by the Himalayan Wildlife Foundation for the handover of the management of the Park to the, then, Northern Areas Forest Department with the department starting to manage the park since 2006. While pressures that existed in the 1990s, such as hunting and poaching have subsided, the brown bear is still under threat due to pressures such as increasing numbers of tourists and the use of park areas for grazing. The Deosai Plains are also home to the Himalayan ibex, red fox, golden marmot (locally called Phia), gray wolf, the Ladakh urial, snow leopard and over 124 types of resident and migratory birds. Birds in the park include the golden eagle, lammergeier, griffon vulture, laggar falcon, peregrine falcon, Eurasian kestrel, Eurasian sparrowhawk, and snowcock. The following species are found in Deosai: Artemisia maritima, Polygonum affine, Thalictrum alpinum, Bromus oxyodon, Saxifraga flagellaris, Androsace mucronifolia, Aster flaccidus, Barbarea vulgaris, Artemisia maritima, Agropyron longearistatum, Nepeta connate, Carex cruenta, Ranaculyus laetus, Arenaria neelgerrensis, Astrogalus leucophylla, Polygonum amplexinade, Echinop nivetus, Seria chrysanthenoides, Artemisia maritima, Dracocephalum nutsus, Anapalas contorta, Chrysopogon echinulatus and Dianthus crinitus. There were also observed some medicinal plants which are locally famous i.e. Thymu linearis (Reetumburuk), Saussures lappa (kuth), Ephedra intimedia (Say), Viola canescens (Skora- mindoq), Dracocephalum muristanicum (Shamdun) and Artemisia maritima (Bursay) etc. are used as traditional drug therapies. Cultural references =Herodotus= Research by the French ethnologist Michel Peissel makes a claim that the story of 'Gold-digging ants' reported by the Greek historian Herodotus, who lived in the 5th century BC, was founded on the golden Himalayan Marmot of the Deosai plateau and the habit of local tribes such as Minaro to collect the gold dust excavated from their burrows.Peissel, Michel. \\"The Ants' Gold: The Discovery of the Greek El Dorado in the Himalayas\\".

It also operated as a network with sister-stations in Ashburton and Oamaru known as 'Port FM Local'. Port FM's music genre was contemporary rock and pop, with the bulk of the weekday playlist made up of music from the mid eighties through the early nineties. The main (Timaru based) station was used as a network feed for Port FM Local in Ashburton and Oamaru during breakfast, nights and weekends. Port FM ceased trading as an independent radio station on 30 April 2018, and is now under the Mediaworks branch of stations. The Port FM frequency is now broadcasting a South Canterbury version of More FM, with local content between 10am and 3pm weekdays. The Port FM network was based in Timaru and was heard throughout South Canterbury and the MacKenzie Country. In 2006, two other stations owned by Port FM in Ashburton and Oamaru were renamed Port FM Regional. They were originally known as Fox FM (Ashburton) and Whitestone 100FM (Oamaru), broadcasting locally during the day and at nights relaying the Port FM feed programme from Timaru. The network used a tagline of 'Live, Local and Loving It'. Sale to MediaWorks Port FM was privately owned by businessman and radio entrepreneur Brent Birchfield since 1995. The network operated in Ashburton, Timaru, Oamaru and Greymouth on the West Coast. From the early 2000s Port FM had close ties with MediaWorks: sourcing their news bulletins from Newshub and providing advertising sales and services to other MediaWorks stations in the region (The Edge, The Rock, The Sound and Magic). These stations were operated locally by Port FM under a franchise arrangement with MediaWorks. In January 2018 the sale of Port FM to MediaWorks was announced, with a takeover date of 1 April 2018. In April 2018 an announcement was made that Port FM would be rebranded as More FM on 28 April 2018 and The Breeze would also begin broadcasting in South Canterbury with Port FM breakfast announcer OJ Jackson moving to The Breeze to present local breakfast. More FM would be reduced to local content during the weekends and 10am to 3pm weekdays. The West Coast operation was sold to NZME, who used the frequencies to bring Mix and Radio Hauraki to the Coast. Programmes The final station lineup consisted of The Region's Big Breakfast With OJ Jackson. This was followed by a daytime show with Eve O'Brien, and drive show with James Valentine. The night line-up included a three-hour rock music segment from 9-midnight. Saturday programming included a sports breakfast show, the syndicated United States show Retro Pop Reunion with Joe Cortez, and the Automated Party Mix.

However, no one would take it. It went unpublished until 1969, when it was adapted into a film version in 1969, directed by Alex March and scripted by Robert Dozier, with actor Ryan O'Neal in the lead role. However, the first film was a box office and critical disaster, and so the book (which came out shortly after the film was released), went unnoticed until the 1990s, when Leonard gained a new generation of fans thanks to praise from filmmaker Barry Sonnenfeld and a successful film adaptation of Leonard's novel Get Shorty. In 2004, a second film adaptation was released, which Leonard publicly criticised. The second film, despite a cast of big-name stars like Morgan Freeman, Owen Wilson, Charlie Sheen and Sara Foster, was also a flop, receiving negative reviews from both critics and audiences. In one scene in the novel, the two main characters watch part of a western movie on TV through an outside window. The movie is \\"The Tall T\\" which was based on Elmore Leonard's story \\"The Captives.\\" Jack Ryan returned in the novel Unknown Man No. 89. Plot summary The novel, set in the Thumb area of Michigan, tells the story of a young thief named Jack Ryan who gets a new shot at life with the help of a justice of the peace named Mr. Majestyk (Leonard later wrote a novel called Mr. Majestyk, with a title character that is completely unrelated to the character of the same name in The Big Bounce), who hires Jack to work at his beach resort. During this time, Jack gets involved with a psychotic woman named Nancy, a young seductress who got her thrills by smashing windows and breaking the hearts of married men. Nancy is the girlfriend of a millionaire, Ray Ritchie, and also cheating on him with another man, Bob Jr. She plans to have Jack steal a $50,000 payroll ($ today) from Ray. When simple housebreaking and burglary give way to the deadly pursuit of a really big score, however, the stakes suddenly skyrocket because violence and double- cross are the name of this game, and it will take every ounce of cunning Jack and Nancy possess to survive... each other.

When the club was liquidated in the Summer of 2004 he signed for the Newport Gwent Dragons. In the summer of 2008, after 4 seasons with the Newport Gwent Dragons Sweeney signed for the Cardiff Blues. Sweeney was told upon joining the Blues that he was signed to be used as an outside-half (his preferred position) as opposed to inside centre. This meant that Sweeney would be competing with Nicky Robinson for the number 10 jersey. He scored a try seconds after coming on in the EDF Energy Cup final against Gloucester at Twickenham on 18 April 2009. Despite several times being linked with moves away from the capital city side, Sweeney remains at his home region. In 2012, ambitious Russian club Krasny Yar moved to make him the first Welsh international to play professionally in the Russian league. The switch was derailed at the last minute by budget issues at Cardiff Blues making it impossible for them to find a satisfactory replacement for the reliable Sweeney. The Russian option remains one Sweeney is keen to explore in future. It was announced on 10 March 2013 that Sweeney would be joining English Aviva Premiership side Exeter Chiefs. He was announced his retirement in 2016. His total appearances for Pontypridd was 174 games and scored 967 points. International career In 2003, Sweeney made his debut for Wales against England in the Six Nations Championship. After playing well during the six nations, Sweeney was selected in the Wales squad for the 2003 Rugby World Cup. He was on the bench for the final pool game against New Zealand and came on just after half-time to make a big impact. His hand-off on Carlos Spencer saw him break straight through the defensive line with Colin Charvis in support. After passing to Charvis, who passed back to him, he was finally brought down by Doug Howlett just 1m short of the line. The ball was quickly passed out to Shane Williams on the left wing who finished the move by scoring a try.

He was from the Trpimiroviƒá dynasty. Trpimir was probably the son of Duke Muncimir and younger brother of King Tomislav. Following the death of Simeon I of Bulgaria, Byzantium no longer needed Croatia's military support and repealed its alliance. Previously, Byzantium relied heavily on the Croats to threaten Simeon from the west. Despite the achievements of King Tomislav in halting Bulgaria's expansion, Byzantium reversed Croatia's supremacy over the Theme of Dalmatia, which fell once again under its administration. However, Byzantine administration was nominal. Trpimir's woes did not stop there. Pope Leo VI abolished the Diocese of Nin in 928 and transferred Bishop Grgur to Skradin, in what was seen as a humiliating defeat for pro-Slavic proponents in the long running dispute between the Split and Nin Bishoprics.

He attended Saint Thomas Military Academy and graduated in the Class of 1935. During his senior year he was chosen as top student officer. From Saint Thomas, he entered the University of Minnesota and became president of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1939. Soon after graduation, he enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserve and applied for flight training. He was sent to the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida, for training and finished at the top of his class in 1940. He was promoted to first lieutenant in April 1942 and to captain a month later. Captain Fleming's first duty station was the Naval Air Base in San Diego, California. Ten days after World War II began, he flew from Pearl Harbor to Midway Island. He fought in the Battle of Midway as Flight Officer of Marine Scout Bombing Squadron 241. When squadron commander Lofton Henderson was shot down during the initial attack on a Japanese aircraft carrier, Fleming took command of the unit. The following day, June 5, 1942, Capt. Fleming led the second division of his squadron in a mass dive-bombing assault on the . Leaving the remainder of his formation, he dived to the perilously low altitude of , exposing himself to enemy fire in order to score a hit on the ship. Undeterred by a fateful approach glide, during which his plane was struck and set afire, he grimly pressed home his attack to an altitude of five hundred feet, released his bomb to score a near-miss on the stern of his target, then crashed to the sea in flames. For \\"extraordinary heroism and conspicuous gallantry above and beyond the call of duty,\\" Capt. Fleming was posthumously awarded the nation's highest military decoration -- the Medal of Honor, while Pfc. Toms received the Distinguished Flying Cross. On November 24, 1942, President Franklin Roosevelt presented the Medal of Honor to Capt. Fleming's mother. In honor The United States Navy ship, the USS Fleming, DE-32, commissioned on September 18, 1943, was named in honor of Captain Fleming, and a memorial to him was placed at Fort Snelling National Cemetery. Captain Fleming's name is listed on the Tablets of the Missing at Honolulu Memorial in Honolulu, Hawaii. Fleming is memorialized each year at his high school alma mater, Saint Thomas Academy. Each year during the Cadet Colonel promotion ceremony, he is remembered by the presentation of the \\"Fleming Saber\\", which is given to the Cadet Colonel. Richard E.

Postwar myths and clarifications regarding Fleming's attack The Mikuma shortly before sinking. In \\"Midway: The Battle that Doomed Japan\\" Mitsuo Fuchida states, \\"the pilot (R.E. Fleming) after being hit by anti-aircraft fire, attempted a daring suicide crash into Mikuma's bridge. He missed the bridge but crashed into the after turret, spreading fire over the air intake of the starboard engine room. This caused an explosion of gas fumes below, killing all hands working in the engine room. This was a damaging blow to the cruiser, hitherto unscathed except for the slight hull damage received in the collision with Mogami.\\"\\"Midway: The Battle that Doomed Japan\\", Mitsuo Fuchida, Masatake Okumiya. This source among others began perpetuating the myth that Flemming crashed into Mikuma after scoring a near-miss. However, Fuchida's account has been challenged by modern scholars, most notably by Jonathan Parshall and Anthony Tully Shattered Sword: The Untold Story of the Battle of Midway for its many logic errors and inaccuracies. In this instance, Fuchida was not a witness to the attack as he was with the remnants of Kido Butai several hundred miles away. The \\"battleship\\" attacked by Capt. Fleming was actually the heavy cruiser . Despite the clear language in Fleming's Medal of Honor citation, which noted (correctly) his having achieved a near miss and then crashing into the sea, the common wisdom of the battle has often had Fleming striking Mikuma with his bomb, and then crashing his aircraft onto her aft turrets. This construction is based upon the eyewitness accounts of both a Japanese naval officer and Fleming's wingman. Some sources state that the wreckage of Fleming's plane is shown in the very famous image of Mikuma in a pre-sinking state on the early evening of June 6. Wreckage located on the roof of #4 turret has commonly been ascribed as that of Fleming's aircraft. However, Mikuma had suffered catastrophic damage from the detonation of her own Type 93 torpedo mounts, which were located immediately forward of the main battery turrets, on the main deck. The resulting explosions had largely destroyed the aft portion of Mikuma funnel, as well as her rear superstructure and mainmast. This accounts for the wreckage on her turret roof. Similarly, the particulars of Mikuma damage, as well as the American attacks against her, were very accurately recorded by the Japanese, and these sources make no mention of a hit by an enemy aircraft.

The Gamecocks, as they had come to be known, opened the new stadium with a win over Pembroke. The initial season at the College Bowl was as successful one, as the Gamecocks completed the season undefeated (and untied) with 9 wins. The College Bowl officially became Paul Snow Stadium in 1961. That year, the stadium was dedicated to longtime Jacksonville State supporter Paul Snow. Burgess-Snow Stadium was renovated in 1965 when seating was expanded from 5,000 to 8,500. A new press box was installed on the north side of the facility. Under the supervision of longtime Athletic Director Jerry N. Cole, a field house was constructed in 1977. A student section was added in 1978, bringing the total capacity to 15,000. In 2010, an expansion project including additional seating to the south stands and east endzone and the seven-story Stadium Tower (floors 1-4 function as a residence hall for students, while floors 5-7 house skyboxes and the press box) was completed, increasing the seating capacity to 24,000. In 2015, Stadium Tower was renamed William A. Meehan Hall in honor of former Jacksonville State President William A. Meehan, who retired that year. In 2010, the name of Paul Snow Stadium was changed to Burgess-Snow Field at Jacksonville State Stadium, in honor of former Jacksonville State coach Bill Burgess who coached the team to the 1992 Division II championship. Improvements Artificial turf was placed in Burgess‚ÄìSnow Field in time for the 2005 Football season. The turf is the same used by many colleges, high schools and pro teams (ProGrass).

Invented and constructed by Jesse \\"The Lone Cat\\" Fuller, an American one-man band musician, who needed an accompaniment instrument beyond the usual high-hat (foot- operated cymbal) or bass drum favored by street musicians. History Fuller developed the instrument the early 1950s. It was a large upright box with a rounded top, shaped like the top of a double bass, with a short neck on top. Six bass strings were attached to the neck and stretched over the body. He later made five more models of various designs. Playing To play the instrument, there was a homemade set of pedals, each pedal bringing a padded hammer to strike a string when depressed, like the action of a piano. With these six bass notes, Fuller could accompany himself on the 12-string guitar in several keys. Fuller's wife took to calling it a \\"foot-diller\\" (as in the then-current expression, \\"killer-diller\\", meaning exceedingly good); and later, it became shortened to just fotdella. One of Fuller's later fotdella iterations is available for viewing at a museum in Seattle, Washington. Dave Harris, an active one-man-band and author of 'Head, Hands, and Feet,' a comprehensive encyclopedia of one-man-bands, has designed and had built for him several fotdellas. Harris performs with them in Victoria, British Columbia. After having seen one of Harris' performances in 2001, members of the band Frog & Henry built one of their own in 2010 in Ontario, Canada.

The Racers' first mascot, a racehorse named Violet Cactus, is buried at the stadium near the area where the current mascot, Racer 1, begins its trek around the football field before the beginning of each football game, and after each Racer touchdown. History From 1934 until 1972, Racer football played at Cutchin Football Stadium, which was at the location of the current soccer field. Cutchin Stadium was demolished in 1972 when construction began on a new football stadium to be located on the North end of campus, along US Highway 641. The Racers played their first football game in Roy Stewart Stadium in 1973, and earned a win over Western Carolina University by a score of 27‚Äì25. The stadium was officially dedicated on September 9, 1974. =Renovations= On April 9, 2007, a turf replacement project began to remove the existing turf and install a FieldTurf playing surface at the stadium. The new FieldTurf also allowed for the existing three percent grade on the field to be reduced to 0.5 percent. The rise in the middle of the field was lowered from 18 inches to three inches. The FieldTurf installation was completed in time for the Racers' 2007 home opener on September 15 against Lambuth University. The improvement project also brought about new play clocks, new goal posts, and a new surface on the track.

One of the Cinder cones of the Lavic Lake volcanic field are in the range, with the other three including Pisgah Crater beyond to the east. Wilderness Established in 1994 by the U.S. Congress, the 34,264 acre Rodman Mountains Wilderness is managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. A series of ridges and valleys climbing from 2,000 feet to almost 5,000 feet are the result of faults which cross this wilderness area. A lava flow slices this area in two from northwest to southeast, forming a sloping mesa. Colorful escarpments, calico-colored mountains, maze-like canyons and broad, majestic bajadas come together here. Steep canyons and cliff-like walls form dry falls along deep drainage channels, creating cascades during heavy rain storms. More than a half dozen natural water \\"tanks\\" sit within the lava flow. Two of the tanks, Hidden Tank and Deep Tank, hold thousands of gallons of water, drawing wildlife. One of only seven core raptor breeding areas in the Mojave Desert is within this wilderness, where prairie falcons and golden eagles are known to survive.

Denyer became known in the media as the Frankston Serial Killer as her crimes occurred in the neighbouring suburbs of Frankston. Later, during her imprisonment, when aged around 30, Denyer began identifying as a transgender woman, but was refused permission by prison authorities to wear make-up, receive sex reassignment surgery, or legally alter her name. Early life Denyer was born as Paul Charles Denyer on 14 April 1972 to British immigrant parents, Anthony and Maureen Denyer in Campbelltown, New South Wales, an outer suburb of Sydney. Her parents had immigrated to Australia in 1965, before moving to Adelaide, and in 1981, the family (now including five sons and a daughter) relocated to Melbourne. Denyer then reportedly had difficulty fitting in amongst her peers in her new town, which led to problems with study and self-confidence that were worsened by significant weight gain during her teen years. At age 11, she slashed the throat of her sister's teddy bear, and cut the throat of the family cat before hanging it in a tree; at age 13, was arrested and cautioned for stealing a car; and at age 15, for assaulting a fellow student. After school, she had problems holding down jobs, was fired seven times, and failed a physical when trying to enter Victoria Police. Crimes Denyer, aged 20‚Äì21 and identifying as male at the time of her crimes, started to stalk and attack a number of women in and around the Melbourne suburb of Frankston during a five-month period in 1993. The first known incident attributed to Denyer occurred in February 1993, when Donna Vanes' Claude Street unit in Seaford was broken into. After a series of disturbing prank-calls, Vanes was fearful of being alone. Arriving home with her boyfriend at around 1:00am, having been out for about an hour, they found that her cats' throats had been slashed, as had the walls, furniture, and some of her baby's clothes. Female pornographic imagery was also found, and the message \\"Donna you‚Äôre dead\\" written in blood on the wall. Unwilling to stay at the unit, she moved in with her sister, who was living in the unit next to Denyer, and whose neighbour had also recently been the victim of a break-in slasher. The first murder victim was 18-year-old Elizabeth Stevens, who had come to Melbourne from Tasmania in January 1993 to study at TAFE Frankston. Living in Paterson Avenue, Langwarrin, with her aunt and uncle, she had alighted from a bus at the stop on Cranbourne Road, on Friday 11 June. As she had been expected home at around 8:00pm, her uncle started searching for her in his car at 10:00pm, and the police were notified around 1:00am, but little could be done given the bad weather that day. The next morning a man found her partially concealed body in Lloyd Park Reserve: she had been strangled, stabbed, her throat had been slashed, and a criss-cross pattern was carved into her chest. A month later, on Thursday 8 July, 41-year-old Rosza Toth alighted at Seaford railway station, and headed north along Railway Parade on her way home. Around 5:50pm, as she walked past Seaford North Reserve, she noticed a man loitering near the toilet block, and was attacked shortly after passing him. Toth was dragged into the park, but broke free after Denyer held a fake gun to her head, and she pretended to submit. Shaken, and with light injuries, she then ran back to the road, stopped a car, and was assisted by the driver back to her house. That same night the second murder victim, 22-year-old Deborah Fream who lived near Kananook Station, Seaford, was abducted in her car in the early evening. She had left her 12-day-old son at home with a male friend when she went out at 7:00pm on a short trip to buy some milk for an omelette dinner. By 8:00pm, when she still hadn't returned, he called her boyfriend, the police, and the local hospital seeking news of her whereabouts and possible accidents. The friend and boyfriend drove around trying to locate her, then reported her missing at Frankston Police Station. On the afternoon of Monday 12 July, a farmer found Fream's partially covered body on Taylors Road, Carrum Downs; like Stevens, she had been strangled, savagely slashed, and her throat cut. On Friday 30 July, the third and final victim, 17-year-old schoolgirl Natalie Russell, was attacked while walking home from John Paul College. Despite media speculation, heightened public fear, and warnings from her school, she had taken her usual short cut home to Frankston North, a fenced walkway (now called Nat's Track in her memory) which passes between two golf courses on Skye Road. At 8:00pm, Russell was reported missing to Frankston Police Station, and a police search soon found her body. She had been dragged from the path through a large hole in a wire fence into adjacent scrub. She had died in a similar manner to the others, but during the attack she had put up a considerable fight, which assisted investigators due to DNA evidence finally being available at the scene.  Investigation  Police became involved with the case after the incidents at Denyer's block of units, where the first slasher break-in occurred, and at Vanes' unit in February 1993. The murder of Stevens was the first incident to attract a large investigation, as did the disappearance of Fream, when a search was organised and scuba divers examined the Kananook Creek. No external forensic evidence was found at the Stevens scene, and no witnesses came forward. With Fream, again, no foreign forensic evidence was found at the scene due to poor weather, but witnesses later recalled her car, a gray Nissan Pulsar, had been seen driving erratically and flashing its high-beam lights. Her car was located by police the next day at nearby Madden Street, and forensics found traces of Fream's blood inside, alongside a new dent in the front, and the driver's seat pushed back. Denyer later explained how, at the milk bar, Fream had left her car unlocked, and she had climbed into the back seat, and threatened her with the gun shortly after she drove from the store. After the second attack, and with Toth's description (she described her attacker as 18‚Äì20 years old, 180 cm tall, with a round face and blue-eyes), police drew up a profile of the suspect: a male, likely unemployed or with a menial job, likely a local resident, aged 18‚Äì24, average looking, and living alone. The Russell attack provided police with the breakthrough they needed. At 2:30pm, a postal worker saw a rusted yellow Toyota Corona without number plates parked near Nat's Track on Skye Road, with a man using binoculars acting suspiciously inside. As she stopped at a house to call police, she noticed Russell approaching the track alone, observed by the suspicious man, who then ran up the track. Police responded, noted the registration label number, door-knocked a few nearby houses, but soon had to leave to attend to another call before the man returned. The later forensic investigations of the walkway revealed three holes cut in the fence with the same tool, with blood traces on one, alongside skin and hair traces on Russell but not belonging to the victim. Police also informed investigators of the registration details, which were quickly traced to the car's owner, Paul Charles Denyer. Detectives visited her small unit at 186 Frankston‚ÄëDandenong Road, Seaford, the afternoon of 31 July - a unit shared with Denyer's girlfriend, and next door to Donna Vanes' sister. While her movements were being checked, she admitted to being in the vicinity of the Fream and Russell murders at the time. She was then taken to Frankston Police Station, and her videoed interview commenced at 9:20pm. She was unable to adequately explain the cuts and scratches the officers noticed, and also admitted being in the vicinity of the Stevens attack. She agreed to have her DNA collected, and early on 1 August, suspecting that the police had DNA evidence, admitted to the murders, the Toth assault, and the slasher break-ins. Denyer also told detectives that she had been stalking women in the Frankston area \\"for years\\", and that the motivation for the crimes was a desire to kill from the age of 14 and a general hatred of girls and women. Trial and imprisonment Denyer was charged with three murder counts and one of abduction, charges to which she later pleaded guilty and did not contest. Psychologists and experts examined Denyer, noting a lack of emotion regarding the crimes, a single-minded desire to kill, and the unusual randomness by which victims were chosen, leading to a diagnosis of sadistic personality disorder but not legal insanity. During examination, she also admitted being influenced by the 1987 film, The Stepfather. On 20 December 1993, after four days of hearings, she was sentenced in Melbourne's Supreme Court to three consecutive sentences of life imprisonment with no parole period. On 31 December, however, Denyer lodged an appeal, which was heard in July 1994 - granting her a non-parole period of 30 years (until 2023). Denyer was sent initially to HM Prison Barwon, and is currently at Port Phillip Prison. On 9 January 2004, after 10 years in jail, Denyer was the subject of a 7:30 Report titled \\"Murderer's sex change request sparks rights debate\\". In September 2004, news broke of a letter Denyer had sent to her estranged brother (who she had accused in her trial of sexually abusing her as a child) and sister-in-law who had re-emigrated to the UK. In July 2012, Denyer again came to the attention of the media over allegations of four rapes conducted over a six- week period. In April 2013, the Herald Sun created a website with images of 14 letters, written by Denyer in 2003 and 2004 to another inmate, titled \\"The Paul Denyer Letters\\". On 8 April, the newspaper also ran articles related to analyses of the letters and handwriting.  Gender identity  According to the first of \\"The Paul Denyer Letters\\", dated 29 November 2003, Denyer began identifying as a woman that same year. Denyer has claimed that these feelings of gender dysphoria are what led her to seek revenge against women by murdering them. In \\"Letter 6\\", dated 4 February 2004, she wrote: \\"I committed these disgusting crimes ... not because I ever hated womankind, but because I have never really felt that I was male.\\" Denyer began wearing women's clothing and cosmetics in prison, in defiance of prison orders. Medical specialists evaluated whether Denyer could receive sex reassignment surgery and rejected the idea. Prisoner support groups said that she \\"cannot be anything but serious\\" about her transition, given that it would entail personal risk. One victim's mother said Denyer's transition made her and her husband feel \\"sick\\", calling it a \\"stunt\\".

The Malagasy civet is a small mammal, about long excluding the tail (which is only about ). It can weigh . It is endemic to the tropical forests of Madagascar. Malagasy civets are nocturnal. It eats small vertebrates, insects, aquatic animals, and eggs stolen from birds' nests. The mating season of the Malagasy civet is August to September and the gestation period is three months, ending with the birth of one young. The Malagasy Civet is listed as Vulnerable by International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Classification The Malagasy civet was to be placed in the subfamily Hemigalinae with the banded palm civets and then in its own subfamily, Fossinae, because of similarities with others in the group pointed out by Gregory, but it is now classified as a member of the subfamily Euplerinae, after Pocock pointed out more similarities with that one. Physical description The Malagasy civet is a small mammal, about long excluding the tail (which is only about ). The males can weigh up to , and the females can weigh up to . It is the second largest carnivore in Madagascar after the fossa. Its head is about It has the appearance and movements of a small fox. it may be confused with the small Indian civet (Viverricula indica). It has a short coat greyish beige or brown in colour, with dark black horizontal stripes running from head to tail, where the stripes are vertical, wrapping around the bushier tail. The stripes morph into spots near the belly. Its legs are short and very thin. Behavior The Malagasy civet is nocturnal, though sources disagree over whether it is solitary or, unusual among euplerids, lives in pairs. It is not a good climber and frequents ravines. It eats small vertebrates (mammals, reptiles, and amphibians), insects, aquatic animals, and eggs stolen from birds' nests. It is shy and secretive. Their vocalizations are similar to crying and groaning, as well as a sound similar to coq-coq. Pairs of males and females defend a large area (around ) as their territory. In the winter, it may store fat in its tail, which can make up 25% of their weight. The mating season of the Malagasy civet is August to September and the gestation period is around three months, ending with the birth of one young. The young are rather well- developed, weigh around , and are weaned in two to three months, leaving their parents at around one year old. The average lifespan of a Malagasy civet is about 21 years in captivity. Distribution and habitat The Malagasy civet is found in lowland and rainforest areas of Eastern and Northern areas of Madagascar, and can also be found in humid and isolated forests in Amber Mountain National Park, and farther north in the less-humid forests of Ankarana Reserve. It can be found from sea level to above sea level, but is only common up to above sea level. Conservation status The Malagasy civet is listed as Vulnerable by International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), with a decreasing population. Though threatened by deforestation, hunting, charcoal production, logging, and competition from introduced species such as dogs, cats, and small Indian civets, it is locally common. Introduced animals such as dogs are likely to prey of Malagasy civets. Its range is now reduced to isolated patches. References Sources *Macdonald, David (ed). The Encyclopedia of Mammals.

Political life  = Representative (1965-1971) = Mitra was elected congressman representing Palawan for two terms from 1965 and was the minority leader within five years. = Senator of the Philippines (1971-1972) = He resigned, during his second term, to run for the senate and was elected senator in 1971. During the campaign, he was nearly killed in Plaza Miranda by hand grenades at the anti-Marcos political rally of the Liberal Party. In September 1972, his term was cut short by Martial Law. Mitra was one of the first arrested and jailed when Marcos declared martial law. \\"I am a martial law victim,\\" he would say. = Assemblyman (1984-1986) = In 1978, Monching ran for the Interim Batasang Pambansa together with Sen. Ninoy Aquino. In 1984, he was elected as an Assemblyman to the Regular Batasang Pambansa. After the People Power Revolution in 1986, Mitra joined the Aquino administration and was appointed as Agriculture Minister. = Speaker of the House (1987-1992) = After the restoration of the House of Representatives, he ran for the second district of Palawan. He was eventually elected as Speaker of the House at its inaugural session.

Ramos bolted the party and formed his own party, the Lakas ng Tao Party. Mitra's bid was difficult because he was branded a \\"traditional politician\\" and suffered many controversies, including the alleged use of the congressional printing press for his election materials. Mitra lost the 1992 presidential election to Fidel Ramos. = Later career = In 1995, he agreed to create a coalition with Ramos and formed the Lakas-Laban Coalition. In the 1995 Philippine general election, he ran for senator but lost. In the 1998 Philippine general election, he returned to the political spotlight as a key supporter of Joseph Estrada's successful presidential campaign. Estrada rewarded Mitra by naming him president of the state-owned Philippine National Oil Corporation.

Plot Geoffrey Bailey returns to London, leaving behind a career in the Royal Navy and a ruined marriage in Singapore. He becomes involved in the affairs of the Strode Shipping Company, the company which ruined his father's shipping firm, with a job offer to locate the black sheep of the Strode clan, Peter Strode, who was last seen in Aden. Bailey eventually locates Peter Strode in Addu, in the southern Maldive Islands, where he is obsessed with helping the nascent Addu People's Republic against the Maldive government, and with relocating an uninhabited island in the southern Indian Ocean which is rich in manganese deposits which can both help the Adduan people and the financially failing Strode Shipping Company. However, the ruling Strode brothers have other plans, which do not necessarily include the return of either Peter Strode or Bailey to London. In addition to the dangers of volcanic islands and the unexplored ocean, Bailey must also face the dangers of boardroom politics and financial warfare in civilised London. The Strode Venturer is notable for strong characterization and the exploration of such themes as family honour, the bounds of loyalty and man's relationship to nature, themes which would continue in Innes' later works. Like many of Innes' novels, the hero faces all sorts of obstacles, which he has to overcome, including a family tragedy. The psychological characterization of the hero gives the book an added interest. An adaptation of the book was broadcast in BBC radio 4's Saturday Night Theatre in 1974, with Martin Jarvis playing Peter Strode. 1965 British novels Thriller novels Novels by Hammond Innes William Collins, Sons books Novels set on islands Novels set in the Indian Ocean ","title":"The Strode Venturer"},{"id":"3513963","text":"The Merger may refer to: *\\"The Merger\\" (Dilbert episode), an episode of the Dilbert TV series *\\"The Merger\\" (The Office), an episode of the American TV series The Office *The Merger (film), 2018 Australian comedy/drama film See also *Merge (disambiguation) ","title":"The Merger"},{"id":"3513968","text":"Zhijiang may refer to: * Zhijiang, Hubei (ÊûùÊ±üÂ∏Ç), county-level city of Yichang, Hubei, China * Zhijiang Dong Autonomous County (Ëä∑Ê±ü‰æóÊóèËá™Ê≤ªÂéø), Huaihua, Hunan, China * Zhijiang Town (), a town and the county seat of Zhijiang Dong Autonomous County in Hunan ","title":"Zhijiang"},{"id":"3513970","text":"Crescent Lake in Portage la Prairie The Central Plains Region is located in the south central part of the Canadian province of Manitoba, directly west of Winnipeg.

Its title referred to the fact that the series was largely improvised by its performers. The series was executive produced by Steven Soderbergh, George Clooney, and Grant Heslov. Synopsis It follows the misadventures of three struggling actors, who are all in the same acting class in Los Angeles, California, as they make the rounds from auditions to rejection, to personal struggle and to satisfaction. The three main characters all appear as themselves as the show blends fact with fiction as a movie/show within a show. It features many cameo appearances from many stars playing themselves either in projects they're involved in, or involved in a social function such as Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, Noah Wyle, Hank Azaria, Richard Kind, Meryl Streep, Uma Thurman, Jon Lovitz, Shia LaBeouf, Keanu Reeves, Sam Rockwell, Danny Comden, Bonnie Hunt, George Lopez, Barry Corbin, director Doug Liman and producer Akiva Goldsman. Main characters * Bryan Greenberg - A young twentysomething actor bouncing from audition to audition. A generally good man brought down by the frustrations of trying to make it which include backstabbing, shady network contracts and being virtually unnoticed on the small screen, if he even makes the final cut. * Krista Allen - A single mother and actress more well known for her looks than her talent, trying to establish herself as a serious performer. Often typecast in print ads or commercials as the \\"sexy girl\\", she is rarely taken seriously, and when opportunities arise, she gets passed over in favor of someone else who has a bigger name. * Jennifer Hall - A nice girl deemed not attractive enough by agents by her looks, currently taking low level jobs on major film productions. Naively finds herself in the Hollywood machine in trying to land roles, by knowing who's who in the industry. * Goddard Fulton (Frank Langella) - The protagonists' stern but fatherly acting teacher, a refined man whose professionalism and guidance remain in the classroom but virtually disappear when outside. Despite keeping a distance from his students outside of teaching, the sage Fulton helps them in whatever way he can when in the classroom. Other characters * Nick - Bryan's roommate who is often stealing his auditions and scheming ways to achieve success. He winds up starring in a genital herpes commercial as well as auditioning for a porno, all against his own knowledge. Played by Nick Paonessa. * Dragon - Another of Bryan's friends in the acting class who winds up dating Jennifer. Played by Erik Weiner. * Pam - An actress in the class who hooks up with Nick. Played by Pamela Adlon. * Diane - An actress in the class who has a romantic history with Goddard. Played by Diane Baker. * The English Theatre Director Aaron Mullen plays himself.

Life and career Artzybasheff was born in Kharkov, son of the author Mikhail Artsybashev. He is said to have fought as a White Russian. During 1919 he arrived in New York City, where he worked in an engraving shop. His earliest work appeared in 1922 as illustrations for Verotchka's Tales and The Undertaker's Garland. A number of other book illustrations followed during the 1920s. Dhan Gopal Mukerji's Gay-Neck, with his illustrations, was awarded the Newbery Medal in 1928. His book Seven Simeons was a Caldecott Honor Book in 1938. Over the course of his career, he illustrated some 50 books, several of which he wrote, most notably As I See. During his lifetime, however, Artzybasheff was probably known best for his magazine art. He illustrated the major American magazines Life, Fortune, and Time.TIME Magazine covers by Boris Artzybasheff from 1941 to 1965 at time.com) He painted 219 Time covers from 1942 to 1966, including portraits of Louis Armstrong (21 February 1949) and Dave Brubeck (8 November 1954). Other illustrators of Time covers during this period, which has been called the golden age of Time covers, included Robert Vickrey, James Ormsbee Chapin, Bernard Safran and Boris Chaliapin. During World War II, he also served an expert advisor to the U.S. Department of State, Psychological Warfare Branch. After 1940, he devoted himself to commercial art, including advertisements for Xerox, Shell Oil, Pan Am, Casco Power Tools, Alcoa Steamship lines, Parke-Davis, Avco Manufacturing, Scotch Tape, Wickwire Spencer Steel Company, Vultee Aircraft, World Airways, and Parker Pens. His graphic style is striking. In commercial work he explored grotesque experiments in anthropomorphism, where toiling machines displayed distinctly human attributes. Conversely, one of his works shows Buckminster Fuller's head in the form of Fuller's geodesic structure. In his personal work, he explored the depiction of vivid and extreme ranges of human psychology and emotion. His papers are collected at Syracuse University.

Later career =The Winter of 1905 and In Our Time (short, Desires or Expectation)= Yang eventually returned to Taiwan to write the script for and serve as a production aide on a Hong Kong TV movie, The Winter of 1905 (1981), which was nominated for a Best Cinematography award at the 1982 Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards. After directing a series of television shows, Yang's break came in 1982 when he was asked to direct and write a short, \\"Desires\\" (also known as \\"Expectation\\"), in the seminal Taiwanese New Wave collection In Our Time (1982), which featured other short films from directors such as Yi Chang, I-Chen Ko, and Te-chen Chao. Yang's short film is about a young girl's experiences going through puberty.Edward Yang Retrospective, see page 3, http://www.iias.nl/sites/default/files/Persbericht-Retrospectief- Tropentheater.pdf =That Day, on the Beach= Yang then followed that short with several of his major works. While his contemporary Hou Hsiao-hsien focused more on the countryside, Yang was a poet of the city, analyzing the environment and relationships of urban Taiwan in nearly all his films. Yang's first feature film, That Day, on the Beach (1983), was a fractured modernist narrative reflecting on couples and families that spliced timelines. The film is also notable as being one of the first films ‚Äì and perhaps first feature film ‚Äì that Christopher Doyle received a Director of Photography credit for before going on to become Wong Kar Wai's frequent collaborator and cinematographer, along with DP Hui Kung Chang, who went on to provide the cinematography for many of Yang's later films. The film also won a Best Cinematography award from the 1983 Asia-Pacific Film Festival, and was nominated for three awards at the 1983 Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards: Best Feature Film, Best Director (Yang), and Best Original Screenplay (Wu Nien-jen and Edward Yang). Screenwriter Wu Nien-jen would later collaborate with Yang as an actor, in Taipei Story (1985) (as the Taxi Driver), Mahjong (1996) (as a Gangster in Black Suit) and as the star \\"N.J.\\" in Yi Yi (2000). For the film, Yang was also nominated for the Golden Montgolfiere award at the 1983 Nantes Three Continents Festival. =Taipei Story= Yang followed with his second feature film, Taipei Story (1985), where he cast fellow auteur Hou Hsiao-hsien as the lead, a former Little-League baseball star named Lung trying to find his way in Taipei. Taipei Story also starred Yang's future wife, Tsai Chin, as Chin, the female lead and girlfriend of Hou Hsiao-hsien's character, Lung. The film was also nominated for two awards at the 1985 Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards: Best Leading Actor (Hou Hsiao-hsien) and Best Cinematography (Wei-han Yang). =Terrorizers= Yang's third feature film was Terrorizers (1986), a complex multi-narrative urban thriller that reflected on city life and contained the crime elements and alienation themes of an Antonioni film. The film also starred Cora Miao and won a Silver Leopard at The Locarno International Film FestivalThe Terrorizer, Awards, https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091355/awards and was examined by Fredric Jameson in The Geopolitical Aesthetic.Jameson, Fredric, The Geopolitical Aesthetic. ‚ÄúRemapping Taipei.‚Äù London: BFI Publishing, 1992, pp. 114‚Äì157. In addition, Terrorizers won the Best Film award at the 1986 Golden Horse Film Festival, where actress Cora Miao was also nominated for a Best Actress award. In addition, the film won the Sutherland Trophy at the 1987 British Film Institute Awards, and a Best Screenplay Award (awarded to writers Edward Yang and Hsiao Yeh) from the 1987 Asia-Pacific Film Festival. =A Brighter Summer Day= Yang's fourth film was A Brighter Summer Day (1991) (The Chinese title of \\"G«î l«êng jiƒì sh√†oni√°n shƒÅr√©n sh√¨ji√†n\\" literally translating to: \\"The Murder Incident of the Boy on Guling Street\\"), a sprawling examination of youth-teen gangs, 1949 Taiwanese societal developments, and American pop culture starring a then 15-year-old Chang Chen. The film also stars Lisa Yang, Kuo-Chu Chang, Elaine Jin and Yang's then-wife Tsai Chin in a small role as Wang's wife. The title was also taken from a lyric from the song Are You Lonesome Tonight?. The film is considered by many critics to be Yang's defining masterpiece. For A Brighter Summer Day, Yang won the FIPRESCI Prize and a Special Jury Prize (and was nominated for the Tokyo Grand Prix) at The Tokyo International Film Festival, and a Golden Horse award for Best Film as well as Best Original Screenplay, credited to writers Edward Yang, Hung Hung, Alex Yang, and Mingtai Lai. The film was also nominated for a total of ten other Golden Horse awards, including Best Leading Actor (Chen Chang), Best Leading Actress (Lisa Yang), Best Director (Edward Yang), Best Leading Actor (Kuo-Chu Chang), Best Supporting Actress (Elaine Jin), Best Supporting Actress (Hsiu-Chiung Chang), Best Cinematography (Hui Kung Chang), Best Art Director (Edward Yang and Wei- yen Yu), Best Makeup & Costume Design (Wei-yen Yu), and Best Sound Recording (Duu-Chih Tu and Ching-an Yang).

Actor Chi-tsan Wang also won a Best Supporting Actor award at the 1996 Golden Horse Film Festival, where the film was also nominated for a Best Makeup & Costume Design award (Chi-chien Chao). =Yi Yi= However, Yang was best known for his seventh and final film, Yi Yi (2000) (full title in some areas: Yi Yi: A One and A Two) ‚Äì it was for this film that he received the Best Director at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival where it was also in competition and nominated for the prestigious Palme d'Or. Yi Yi was an epic story about the Jian family seen through three different perspectives: the father NJ (Wu Nien-jen), the son Yang-Yang (Jonathan Chang), and the daughter, Ting-Ting (Kelly Lee). The three-hour piece started with a wedding, concluded with a funeral, and contemplated all areas of human life in between with profound humor, beauty and tragedy.Dennis Lim, Los Angeles Times, A Second Look: 'Yi Yi', http://articles.latimes.com/2011/mar/20/entertainment/la-ca-second- look-20110320 The film is also best summarized by film critic Nigel Andrews, who stated in the Financial Times that \\"[t]o describe [Yi Yi] as a three-hour Taiwanese family drama is like calling Citizen Kane a film about a newspaper.\\" The film won the \\"Best Film\\" award from the National Society of Film Critics (USA) in 2001 (where Yang also won 2nd place for a Best Director award), the \\"Best Foreign Film\\" award from the 2000 Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards, the \\"Best Foreign Film\\" award from the 2000 New York Film Critics Circle Awards, the Panorama Jury Prize from the 2000 Sarajevo Film Festival, the Chief Dan George Humanitarian Award (for Yang) at the 2000 Vancouver International Film Festival, a \\"Best Film ‚Äì China/Taiwan\\" award and \\"Best Director\\" award from the 2002 Chinese Film Media Awards, a \\"Best Film\\" award at the 2001 Chinese Film Media Awards, a \\"Best Foreign Film\\" critics award from the 2001 French Syndicate of Cinema Critics, the Grand Prix award from the 2001 Fribourg International Film Festival, and the Netpac Award from the 2000 Karlovy Vary International Film Festival (\\"For the perceptive and sensitive portrayal of a generation and cultural gap in Taiwan and the painful choices to be made in these difficult times.\\").

Scott of The New York Times, Susan Sontag writing for ArtForum, Michael Atkinson of the Village Voice, Steven Rosen of the Denver Post, John Anderson, Jan Stuart and Gene Seymour writing for Newsday, and Stephen Garrett as well as Nicole Keeter of Time Out New York. The film also won 2nd place for Best Director, Best Film and Best Foreign Language Film in the 2000 Boston Society of Film Critics Awards, and was also nominated for: a Best Foreign Language Film award from the Awards Circuit Community Awards, a Best Non-American Film award from the 2003 Bodil Awards, a Best Foreign Language Film award from the 2001 Chicago Film Critics Association Awards, the Best Cast, Best Movie and Best Original Screenplay from the 2002 Chlotrudis Awards, a Best Foreign Film award from the 2001 Cesar Awards, a Screen International Award from the 2000 European Film Awards, a Best Asian Film award from the 2002 Hong Kong Film Awards, a Best Foreign Language Film award from the Online Film & Television Association, a Best Foreign Language Film award from the 2001 Online Film Critics Society Awards, and a Golden Spike award from the 2000 Valladolid International Film Festival. Yi Yi also placed third in a 2009 Village Voice Film Poll ranking \\"The Best Film of the Decade,\\" tying with La Commune (Paris, 1871) (2000) and Zodiac (2007), and also placed third in a 2009 IndieWire Critics' Poll of the \\"Best Film of the Decade.\\" The film is also currently available on The Criterion Collection as a \\"Director-approved Special Edition\\", and features a newly restored digital transfer a long with a DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack (on the Blu-ray), audio commentary from Yang and Asian film critic Tony Rayns, a taped interview with film critics Rayns about Yang and the New Taiwanese Cinema movement, the U.S. theatrical trailer, an original English subtitle translation by Yang and Rayns, and an essay by writer Kent Jones as well as notes from Yang himself.The Criterion Collection, Yi Yi, https://www.criterion.com/films/781-yi-yi?q=autocomplete =Plays and other work= In 1989, Yang formed his own production company, \\"Yang and his Gang\\", which was renamed \\"Atom Films and Theater\\" in 1992, after one of Yang's favorite anime television shows while growing up, Osamu Tezuka's Astro Boy. Atom Films and Theater not only was involved in the production and financing of films, but also staged theatrical productions and plays, as well as experimental high-tech multimedia pieces. In 1992, Yang also put on a production of a play he wrote entitled Likely Consequence, a video-taped performance of which can be viewed on The Criterion Collection Blu-ray/DVD of A Brighter Summer Day (1991), released in March 2016. In 2001, Yang had finished a script about a young kid who travels the world with just a cellphone and a credit card. Regarding that, \\"those two things are all you need now. It's a new world and there are a lot of stories we can tell each other,\\" said the cineaste. In the same year, Yang also hoped to make a film in Seattle and a second world war story set in Taiwan. In addition to these unrealized projects, Yang planned to make The Wind, an animated feature with Jackie Chan budgeted at $25m, to be drawn by Yang, heading a team of animators. Death Yang died on June 29, 2007 at his home in Beverly Hills, as a result of complications from a seven-year struggle with colon cancer. He was survived by his wife, concert pianist Kaili Peng, and son Sean. Style and themes Yang's visual style comprehended deliberate pacing, long takes, fixed camera, few closeups, empty spaces, and cityscapes. Yang, in addition to being interested in the impact of the changes of Taiwanese society on the middle classes, attempted to examine the struggle between the modern and the traditional in his films, as well as the relationship between business and art, and how greed may corrupt, influence, or affect art.Abrams, Slant Magazine, http://www.slantmagazine.com/features/article/a-rational-mind-the- films-of-edward-yang For that reason, many of his films (other than Yi Yi) are extremely difficult to find, since Yang did not consider selling films for money his primary purpose as an artist, and also felt that film distribution, especially in Taiwan, was something out of his control. Yang always set his work in the cities of Taiwan. As a result, Yang's films ‚Äî especially A Confucian Confusion, Taipei Story, Mahjong and Terrorizers ‚Äî are commentaries on Taiwanese urban life and insightful explorations of Taiwanese urban society.Nick Pinkerton, Village Voice, Edward Yang, Urban Dweller, http://www.villagevoice.com/film/edward-yang-urban-dweller-6433541 Yang also collaborated with many of his fellow Taiwanese film-makers in his films: for instance, in Yi Yi he cast as the lead well-known auteur, novelist, and screenwriter Wu Nien-jen, director of the award-winning A Borrowed Life, which Martin Scorsese has cited as one of his favorite works and one of the most influential films of the '90s.Andrew Chan, Film Comment, Patriarch on the Sidelines, http://www.filmcomment.com/article/wu-nien-jen-a-borrowed-life- patriarch-on-the-sidelines/ He also cast fellow film-maker Hou Hsiao-hsien as the lead in his 1985 film, Taipei Story, where Wu Nien-jen also had a brief part as a taxi driver and an old friend of Hou Hsiao-hsien's character. Yang also taught theatre and film classes at the Taipei National University of the Arts. Several of his students showed up in his films as actors and actresses. Legacy In 2000, Yang formed Miluku Technology & Entertainment to produce animated films and TV shows. The first animated feature that Miluku was slated to produce was an animated feature titled The Wind with Jackie Chan in 2007, but the project was cut short when Yang fell ill with cancer. At the 2007 Pusan International Film Festival, he won an award for Asian Filmmaker of the Year, and was also immortalized with a hand-printing at the festival along with Ennio Morricone, Seung-ho Kim, Volker Schl√∂ndorff, Dariush Mehrjui and Claude Lelouch. In 2007, Yang also won a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards that year.

It serves as the home court for Valparaiso Crusaders men's and women's basketball teams as well as the volleyball team. It opened in 1984 as an addition to Hilltop Gym, the oldest parts of which date to 1939. History Hilltop Gym entrance, now part of the ARC Prior to construction of the ARC, the Valpo basketball and volleyball teams competed at Hilltop Gymnasium, which opened in 1939 and is among the first facilities built at the university after it was purchased by the Lutherans. Hilltop had previously been expanded in 1962 to include more seating for basketball and a swimming pool on the first floor. Hilltop Gym was home for Valpo basketball when it competed in the NCAA's former College Division, for smaller schools. Notable individuals to appear in Hilltop include Larry Bird during his collegiate career at Indiana State, and Robert F. Kennedy, who gave a speech in the gym during his presidential campaign. It is now used as a practice facility for the men's and women's basketball teams following a 2005 renovation that included new flooring, lighting, windows and numerous banners celebrating Valpo's basketball tradition. Beginning in the late 1970s it was decided that Valpo needed to expand its basketball facilities again, and in 1984, the $7.25 million expansion on the north side of Hilltop Gym, named the Athletics and Recreation Center, was completed. The ARC added to the existing gym for a total of . The men's basketball team played their first game there on November 27, 1984, against Western Michigan University and their dedication game there on December 9, 1984, against the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. The greatest upset in the ARC occurred four years later against this same team, when Valpo defeated the 19th ranked Fighting Irish in front of 4,913 fans. In 1995 the ARC hosted the finals of the Mid-Continent Conference men‚Äôs basketball tournament and the 2012, 2013, and 2015 Horizon League Men's Basketball Tournament finals. The largest crowd in arena history was 5,444 fans for the 2016 NIT Quarterfinal against St. Mary Gaels on March 22, 2016. The total eclipsed the previous record of 5,432 in attendance for the February 5, 2008 meeting against the 10th-ranked Butler Bulldogs on February 5, 2008. Facility The Schrage Basketball Wing, built in 1999 The main gym is oriented with sidelines on the north and south side of the building and baselines on the east and west. Chairback seating is located along the north sideline. The south sideline includes the press row, team benches, and bleacher seating, and a balcony section. The student section is located behind the west baseline, while the pep band sits in a small temporary bleacher section behind the open east baseline. Fans can access all seating areas from a central concourse that rings the court, which also includes portable concession stands. An additional concession area is located on the floor level behind the east baseline. The listed seating capacity is 5,000 people and can be increased to approximately 6,000 by adding additional seating to the east side. The building architects, Barton-Malow Company, also left the north side of the building amenable to future expansion of up to 10,000 seats total by adding a second balcony section. There have been several renovations and upgrades in and around the facility since it opened. In 1999 the Schrage Basketball Wing was completed and dedicated, added to the east side of the main arena. The Schrage Wing includes offices for the men's and women's basketball coaches, a computer lab, video room, and team lounges. In 2006 the weight lifting facilities were rearranged with athletes now having access to the Mosak Performance Center, a refurbished room in the building with new customized weight lifting equipment. Further improvements to the facility, such as seating expansion and locker room updates, were discussed in 2006 as the university prepared to begin membership in the Horizon League, but none are in the works for the near future.

The playing surface in Western Hall has undergone several changes in its history. Originally a wooden floor, the regulation-size court was replaced with a tartan floor in 1973 and, prior to the 1993-94 basketball season, upgraded with a parquet floor similar to that in the old Boston Garden. In 2014, the parquet floor was replaced with a maple wood floor. The court is surrounded by a Chem-turf jogging track. The building underwent massive construction in 1997 with the addition of the $8 million Student Recreation Center to its south. The SRC serves as host to all intramural and club sports, and houses a swimming pool, racquetball courts, suspended jogging track and state-of-the-art exercise equipment. In the summer of 1999, the court received a face lift with a new floor design featuring Rocky, the WIU mascot, and it was refinished during the summer of 2000. The latest addition to Western Hall, a new training facility for all WIU athletic programs and locker room for the Leatherneck football program which was added onto the East Arena, was completed in July 2000. Events Besides serving as the home for varsity basketball and volleyball, Western Hall houses numerous athletic and physical education activities and many major Bureau of Cultural Affairs events, including concerts, musicals and multi-cultural entertainment events for all ages.

They are the R√≠a de Muros e Noia, the R√≠a de Arousa, the R√≠a de Pontevedra, and the R√≠a de Vigo.Mendez & Vilas (2004), p. 196. The northernmost R√≠as Baixas begin below Cape Finisterre while the southernmost rias border the Portuguese coast, taking up the southern part of the Province of Coru√±a and the entire Province of Pontevedra. Its capital is the city of Pontevedra. Due to unique conditions, the R√≠as Baixas are rich in marine life which helps the fishing and aquaculture industry of the area. Beaches, marinas, distinctive towns, and plenty of water activities also attract tourists, providing another source of income. Geology Though individually distinct, each of the R√≠as Baixas share some common characteristics. They begin along the coastline of the Atlantic Ocean and jut inland, eventually meeting up with a river. Each ria has a basic funnel shape as well, being wider at the ocean and narrowing as it approaches land and the river. Geologists believe that the R√≠as Baixas formed as a result of tectonic action which sunk certain land areas near the coast and along river valleys. These areas were subsequently flooded by water from the ocean and adjoining rivers. Over time, erosion also helped shape each inlet. Water from the ocean flows into the ria and is eventually joined by inland rivers. This creates an estuary (a body of water where salt and fresh water mix). Geologists break each ria into two basic zones based on the composition of the water and sediments: the outer zone and the inner zone. The outer zone is that which joins with the Atlantic Ocean. The inner zone is inland where rivers join with the ria. Another way to refer to these two zones is with the terms \\"mouth\\" and \\"head\\". The mouth of the ria is the part closest to the ocean and the \\"head\\" joins with the river. Geographical area The Rias within Galicia The four rias that make up the R√≠as Baixas are distinct from the more northern R√≠as Altas (\\"Upper Rias\\") in location and other characteristics.Pereira-Muro (2003), p. 4. As compared to the R√≠as Altas, the waters of the R√≠as Baixas are calmer and smoother. The coast that contains the R√≠as Altas is sometimes known as the Costa da Morte (in Galician: Coast of Death), due to a high number of shipwrecks, a fact that only underlines the turbulent nature of the waters.Pereira-Muro (2003), p. 9. Most of the R√≠as Baixas have islands in the ocean near the mouth, which help to create the calm waters. Tambo island in the R√≠a of Pontevedra Due to the proximity to the ocean, the climate of the area is mild and moist. This causes the green landscape for which the area is known. The land around the R√≠as Baixas is also known for abundant pine and eucalyptus forests.\\"The Galician Coast\\". Galicia Guide. 2005. Web. 10 Oct. 2013 Neither pine nor eucalyptus is indigenous to the area, but were introduced and have taken hold. Naturally occurring vegetation includes oak and chestnut trees.Periera-Muro (2003), p. 237. Each of the R√≠as Baixas shares its name with a major inland city. In the case of the Muros e Noia, it is two separate cities. The R√≠a de Arousa gets its name from the longer Vilagarc√≠a de Arousa. =R√≠a de Muros e Noia= The R√≠a de Muros e Noia is the smallest of the R√≠as Baixas as well as the most northern. The part of the ria known as Muros is in the area closest to the mouth (outer zone), while the Noia portion is farther in the estuary near the head (inner zone).\\"Ria de Muros e Noia\\". Galicia: The best way. Turgalicia, 2008. Web. 15 Oct. 2013. Out of all five Rias Baixas, this is the only one not to have islands near the mouth.

Industry =Fishing and Seafood= Fish farming in the R√≠a de Vigo near Domaio An especially important industry to Galicia is that of seafood and a large amount of that seafood comes from the R√≠as Baxias. Fishing and harvesting the abundant aquatic life that live in the rias is one way of supporting the industry. Another is using the area for aquaculture such as mussel farming. The port of Vigo is especially important in serving the fishing industry. In fact, it has become the leading fishing port in Europe.Periera-Muro (2003), p. 238. For many of the people who live in Galicia, the ocean and r√≠as have provided their livelihood. Approximately 400,000 people make their living from fishing or performing services that help the industry.J.G. & Margaret, \\"Las Rias Altas and Las Rias Baixas\\". Spain: Then and Now. n.p., 2009.

However, even though the fishing industry remains strong, changes in the world's oceans, such as less available fish, as well as competition with other countries have caused many young people to leave the industry and even the country.

Furthermore, the cliffs just off shore offer extensive views. Naturally, many water and boating activities are also a central attraction for tourists visiting the R√≠as Baixas. The many towns located near the rias also offer added interest. Each town is distinctive, but churches, lighthouses, and manor houses are a common and popular feature. The food in the R√≠as Baixas, taken locally from the ocean and rias, is claimed to be very high quality and also attracts tourists.Galicia guide: Your guide to everything Galicia. galiciaguide.com, 2005.

It also hosts the annual Calhoun County High School Basketball Tournament held each January, in which all high school basketball teams in Calhoun County, Alabama compete. The arena has been the annual host for this event since the early 1990s. Prior to that time, the event was held in different facilities around Calhoun County (most often at the Anniston High School auditorium). The venue opened in 1974 when the basketball team moved there from Stephenson Hall. In addition to the arena, the coliseum also houses an indoor swimming pool. Prior to the 2015 renovation, a concourse that was used as a jogging track circled the basketball court. Other Information The facility also includes classroom areas for HPER instruction and also has a large storage area on the lowest level beneath the classroom/swimming pool area. The original seating capacity was 5,500 but due to several renovations since its construction has seen a slight decline in seating capacity to 5,300. Following renovations during the summer of 2015, the seating capacity declined to 3,500. Before that renovation, most of the seating was of the wooden bleacher variety (entire upper deck and end zone lower deck). The remaining seats were of red cloth seats with seat backs which were used primarily by season ticket holders. Those seats were replaced with plastic chair-back seating along both sides and permanent bleachers in both endzones. A new wooden floor was installed as well. The arena currently hosts the Northeast Regional basketball tournament (boys and girls) for the AHSAA playoffs in each classification. The boys and girls winners go to Birmingham for the Final Four tournament. The arena is named for the late former Alabama state legislator Pete Mathews who also sat on the university's board of trustees. The original floor for the arena was synthetic rubber which was the popular flooring for basketball at the time. The arena was a multi-purpose facility when the synthetic rubber floor was in place. Women's volleyball, men's and women's basketball, intramural sports, HPER classes, graduation ceremonies, as well as various concerts and other events were held in the facility. A wooden floor was installed in the early 1980s and the arena was reconfigured to be principally used for basketball. A renovation of the old Stephenson gymnasium allowed most of the activities that had been held in the arena besides men's and women's basketball and women's volleyball to be relocated there. The university's baseball team formerly used the area behind the north side upper deck as a batting cage during winter workouts. A large parking area borders the northern entrances to the facility while limited parking exists on the other three sides. The university's tennis complex borders the facility on the south side while an outdoor track, soccer and baseball facilies border it on the western side.

After ordination he served curacies in Aberystwyth and Carmarthen before becoming the vicar of the nearby village of Abergwili in 1837. He then become the vicar of Llandovery (Llandingat) in 1846. During this time, he also returned to Lampeter to complete a second degree, a Bachelor of Divinity, in 1867. In 1870, William Ewart Gladstone was seeking to fill the vacant bishopric of St Asaph. One of his criteria was that the new bishop would be Welsh-speaking. After consulting with Connop Thirlwall, the position was offered to Hughes. Despite being regarded by many as underqualified (most bishops at the time were expected to be Oxbridge graduates), the appointment was soon justified. He was particularly efficient at appointing Welsh speaking vicars into bilingual churches and thus promoting the church amongst Welsh-monoglots. He was also a staunch supporter of the developing movement for promoting higher education in Wales, initially hoping that his alma mater, St David's College, would become the centre of a Welsh university. In August 1888 Hughes was struck with paralysis while staying at Crieff in Perthshire. He never recovered and was unable to sign a deed of resignation from the see. He died on 21 January 1889 and was buried at St Asaph Cathedral. Hughes' sons were the geologist Thomas McKenny Hughes, and Joshua Pritchard Hughes, appointed Bishop of Llandaff in 1905.

It was created and executive produced by David Rudman, Todd Hannert, and Adam Rudman through their company Spiffy Pictures. The main character is a young puppet musician named Jack, played by David Rudman, who has a musical clubhouse in his backyard. The premiere episode was simulcast on both Nickelodeon and Noggin on September 12, 2005. The show ran for two seasons and 26 episodes in total, which finished airing on October 13, 2007. The popularity of the show made the idea of appearing on it attractive to musicians. An executive from Nick Jr. in 2006 said that they were \\"clamoring to get onto Jack's Big Music Show.\\"Kindie Rock, Scott Lamb, Salon.com, June 24, 2006 In 2008, the show was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Pre-School Children's Series. In May 2007, production was disbanded and it was announced that no new episodes would be produced. The last episode aired on October 13, 2007. However, it reran on Nick Jr. until December 26, 2014. Plot The series focuses on music-loving Jack, his best friend Mary, and his drum-playing dog Mel, all of whom are puppets. The show takes place in Jack's backyard clubhouse and centers on the characters' passion for music. The characters play music in every episode and are often accompanied by other puppets or human musicians. Each episode starts with Jack's mom calling him that he has to leave for an activity soon. They feature two music videos by children's musical artists and a performance by the Schwartzman Quartet about the episode's theme. At the end of each episode, a big \\"finale\\" song is played. Sometimes, Jack leaves and tells his mom what they did today, while other times they continue to play music in the clubhouse. Mel can be seen popping up during the credits.

In 1862, Henry Rawlinson identified Ur Ka≈õdim with Tell el-Muqayyar, near Nasiriyah in southern Iraq. In 1927, Leonard Woolley excavated the site and identified it as a Sumerian archaeological site where the Chaldeans were to settle around the 9th century BCE. Recent archaeology work has continued to focus on the location in Nasiriyah, where the ancient Ziggurat of Ur is located. Other sites traditionally thought to be Abraham's birthplace are in the vicinity of the city of Edessa (≈ûanlƒ±urfa in modern south eastern Turkey). Traditional Jewish and Muslim authorities, such as Maimonides and Josephus, placed Ur Ka≈õdim at various Upper Mesopotamian or at other southeast Anatolian sites such as Urkesh, Urartu, Urfa or Kutha. In tradition =Hebrew Bible= Ur Ka≈õdim is mentioned four times in the Hebrew Bible, at , , , and . The distinction \\"Ka≈õdim\\" is usually rendered in English as \\"of the Chaldees.\\" In Genesis, the name is found in 11:28, 11:31 and 15:7. Although not explicitly stated in the Tanakh, it is generally understood to be the birthplace of Abraham. Genesis 11:27‚Äì28 names it as the birthplace of Abraham's brother Haran, and the point of departure of Terah's household, including his son Abram. In Genesis 12:1, after Abram and his father Terah have left Ur Ka≈õdim for the city of Haran (probably Harran), God instructs Abram to leave his native land (Hebrew moledet). The traditional Jewish understanding of the word moledet is \\"birthplace\\" (e.g. in the Judaica Press translation). Similarly, in Genesis 24:4‚Äì10, Abraham instructs his servant to bring a wife for Isaac from his moledet, and the servant departs for Haran. =Septuagint= The Septuagint translation of Genesis does not include the term \\"Ur\\"; instead it describes the \\"Land (Chora) of the Chaldees\\". Some scholars have held that Ur was not a city at all, but simply a word for land.A. T. Clay, International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, 1915: \\"kal'-dez ('ur kasdim; he chora (ton) Chaldaion): For more than 2,000 years efforts have been made to identify the site of this city. The writers of the Septuagint, either being unfamiliar with the site, or not considering it a city, wrote chora, \\"land,\\" instead of Ur.... It should be stated that there are scholars who hold, with the Septuagint, that Ur means, not a city, but perhaps a land in which the patriarch pastured his flocks, as for instance, the land of Uri or Ura (Akkad). The designation \\"of the Chaldeans\\" was in this case intended to distinguish it from the land where they were not found.\\" The Septuagint Greek used the word ŒßŒ±ŒªŒ¥Œ±ŒØœâŒΩ, or Chaldaion, from which Chaldees is derived. =Jubilees= The Book of Jubilees states that Ur was founded in 1688 Anno Mundi (year of the world) by 'Ur son of Kesed, presumably the offspring of Arphaxad, adding that in this same year wars began on Earth. > And 'Ur, the son of Kesed, built the city of 'Ara of the Chaldees, and > called its name after his own name and the name of his father.\\" (Jubilees > 11:3). =Talmud= The Talmud associated Ur with Warka (today identified as Uruk). =New Testament= In the New Testament, it is described indirectly at , as the \\"land of the Chaldeans\\". =Islamic= According to Islamic texts, Abraham (Ibrahim in Arabic) was thrown into the fire in Ur Kasdim. In the story, the temperature of the king's fire was reduced by God, saving the life of Ibrahim. While the Quran does not mention the king's name, Muslim commentators have assigned Nimrod as the king based on hadiths. Location =Lower Mesopotamia= Eusebius in his Preparation for the Gospel preserves a fragment of the work Concerning the Jews by the 1st century BCE historian Alexander Polyhistor, which in turn quotes a passage in Concerning the Jews of Assyria by the 2nd century BE historian Eupolemus, which claimed that Abraham was born in the Babylonian city Camarina, which it notes was also called \\"Uria\\". (Such indirect quotations of Eupolemus via Polyhistor are referred to as Pseudo- Eupolemus.) This site is identified by modern scholars with the Sumerian city of Ur located at Tell el-Mukayyar, which in ancient texts was named Uriwa or Urima. Woolley's identification of Ur In 1927 Leonard Woolley identified Ur Ka≈õdim with the Sumerian city of Ur (founded 3800 BC), in southern Mesopotamia, where the Chaldeans settled much later (around the 9th century BC); Ur lay on the boundary of the region later called Kaldu (Chaldea, corresponding to Hebrew Ka≈õdim) in the first millennium BCE. It was the sacred city of the moon god and the name \\"Camarina\\" is thought to be related to the much later appearing Arabic word for \\"moon\\": qamar. The identification of Sumerian Ur with Ur Ka≈õdim accords with the view that Abraham's ancestors may have been moon-worshippers, an idea based on the possibility that the name of Abraham's father Terah is related to the Hebrew root for moon (y-r-h). Woolley's identification became the mainstream scholarly opinion on the location of Biblical Ur Kasdim, despite the earlier traditions that Ur Kasdim should lie in Assyria in Northern Mesopotamia. Woolley's identification was challenged with the discovery of the Assyrian city of Harran in northern Mesopotamia, near the present-day village of Altƒ±nba≈üak in modern Turkey (archaeological excavations at Harran began in the 1950s). Recent archaeological work focuses on the area of Nasiriyah (in southern Iraq), where the remains of the ancient Ziggurat of Ur stand. Compare Identification with Uruk According to T.G. Pinches and A.T. Clay, some Talmudic and medieval Arabic writers identified Ur of the Chaldees with the Sumerian city of Uruk, called Erech in the Bible and Warka in Arabic. Both scholars reject the equation. Talmud Yoma 10a identifies Erech with a place called \\"Urichus\\", and no tradition exists equating Ur Ka≈õdim with Urichus or Erech/Uruk. =Upper Mesopotamia= Jewish scholarship identifies Abraham's birthplace as somewhere in Upper Mesopotamia. This view was particularly noted by Nachmanides (Ramban). Nevertheless, this interpretation of moledet as meaning \\"birthplace\\" is not universal. Many Pentateuchal translations, from the Septuagint to some modern English versions, render moledet as \\"kindred\\" or \\"family\\". Writing in the 4th century CE, Ammianus Marcellinus in his Rerum Gestarum Libri (chapter VIII) mentions a castle named Ur which lay between Hatra and Nisibis. A. T. Clay understood this as an identification of Ur Ka≈õdim, although Marcellinus makes no explicit claim in this regard. In her Travels (chapter XX), Egeria, recording travels dated to the early 380s AD, mentions Hur lying five stations from Nisibis on the way to Persia, apparently the same location, and she does identify it with Ur Ka≈õdim. However, the castle in question was only founded during the time of the second Persian Empire (224‚Äì651). Tradition of Sanliurfa Another possible location for Ur of the Chaldees (Ur Kasdim) is the ancient Assyrian and Seleucid city Edessa, now called ≈ûanlƒ±urfa. According to some Jewish traditions, this is the site where Abraham was cast into a furnace by Nimrod as punishment for his monotheistic beliefs, but miraculously escaped unscathed. The Turkish name for the city, Urfa, is derived from the earlier Syriac ‹ê‹ò‹™‹ó‹ù (OrhƒÅy) and Greek (Orrha), the city being a major centre of Assyrian-Syriac Christianity. Islamic tradition holds that the site of Abraham's birth is a cave situated near the center of ≈ûanlƒ±urfa. The Halil-Ur Rahman Mosque lies in the vicinity of the cave. Rendsburg points out that this location makes better sense of the Biblical references, especially that if Tera·∏• and family left Ur-Kasdim to travel to Canaan, but stopped en route in ·∏§arran, then the location of Ur- Kasdim should be to the north of ·∏§arran.Gary Rendsburg Ur Kasdim: Where Is Abraham‚Äôs Birthplace? thetorah.com Urkesh According to A.S. Issar, Ur Kasdim is identified with the site of Urkesh ‚Äì the capital of the Hurrian Kingdom, now in northeastern Syria. It is further hypothesized that the Biblical travel of Abraham's kin from Urkesh to Harran in order to reach Canaan is much more reasonable than a travel from the Sumerian city of Ur.Issar, A.S.

The elevation of Dixon is 6028 feet (1837 meters) above sea level. It is on the banks of the Embudo River, a tributary of the Rio Grande. The Embudo flows into the Rio Grande two miles (3.2 km) downstream from Dixon. The town is the hometown of the late singer-songwriter Al Hurricane, also known as \\"The Godfather\\" of New Mexico music. The town is home to the largest population of organic farmers in the state, as well as several wineries. According to the 2010 Census the population is 926, with 70% of residents identifying as Hispanic. Many non-Hispanics have made their homes here since the mid-1960s.Here s an extensive collection of statistics about Dixon and its population. History The area was inhabited by Tiwa peoples from nearby Picuris Pueblo, then settled by Spanish colonists under the 1725 Embudo Land Grant. The original name was El Puerto del Embudo de Nuestro Se√±or San Antonio and the grant was made in 1725, to Francisco Mart√≠n, L√°zaro C√≥rdova and Juan M√°rquez. The acequias (irrigation canals) were the first public works project of any land grant, so they were started immediately after settlement, on September 20, 1725, and there are 10 Historic Acequias with senior water rights on the Embudo River and one with junior water rights. On the Rio Grande there are two with senior rights and two with junior water rights. The aldea was known as San Antonio del Embudo until around 1900 when a post office was established and the name was changed to Dixon, reputedly to honor Collins Dixon, a school teacher who taught here in the late 19th century; one tradition has him being a Civil War army deserter; his descendants live around nearby Espa√±ola. Climate and wineries Because of the temperate climate generated by the local topography and helped by the acequias (irrigation ditch system), the Embudo Valley has become a significant fruit and grape growing area and the greater Dixon area has two wineries, the La Chiripada Winery and the Viv√°c Winery. Art and the Dixon Studio Tour The substantial number of artists and craft people living in the area led to the 1982 creation of the Dixon Studio Tour which annually draws many visitors during the two days in November that it occupies. There are several galleries in the area, including: Rift Gallery, Rare Earth Gallery, Manifestation Arts, and Metier Fine Handweaving and Craft. Annual summer stonecarving workshops are held at Southwest Stoneworks adjacent to Rift Gallery. Points of interest About north of the town on New Mexico State Road 75, rock and mineral collectors can visit the Harding Mine, a pegmatite mine donated to the University of New Mexico by Dr. Arthur Montgomery. Maps and release forms to visit the mine can be obtained at the University of New Mexico, Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, or at the Dixon home of Gilbert Griego, mine caretaker, or at the Embudo Valley Library in Dixon. Community Dixon is home to the community supported Embudo Valley Library, radio station KLDK-LP and the Dixon Cooperative Market, and during the summer months the Dixon Farmers' Market. It also has a retreat center, at Mission Embudo, which offers space for workshops and retreats.

A stone arch bridge composed of nine spans, the bridge carries Interstate 84, U.S. Route 6, and U.S. Route 44 across the river, connecting Hartford to East Hartford. As of 2005 the bridge carried an average daily traffic of 142,500 cars.2005 Traffic Volumes State Maintained Highway Network (Traffic Log); State of Connecticut Department of Transportation p89. The arches are mounted on stone piers, and vary in length from to ; the total length of the bridge is . Completed in 1908, the Bulkeley Bridge is the oldest bridge in the Hartford area and one of the oldest bridges still in use in the Interstate Highway System. It is also the largest and one of the last major stone arch bridges to be built in New England. Due to its historical, architectural and engineering significance, the Bulkeley Bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.  History  The first substantial bridge across the Connecticut River at Hartford was the Hartford Toll Bridge, a two-lane covered bridge that opened in 1818. The span carried horse traffic, and in 1890 trolley lines were added, connecting Hartford to East Hartford and Glastonbury. On May 17, 1895, the bridge was destroyed in a fire. The flames started near the East Hartford end of the bridge, and within ten minutes had swept the entire tinder-dry structure. There had been much agitation for a new bridge, and the Hartford Courant reported a crowd of 20,000 spectators lined the banks of both sides of the river to watch the bridge burn. Backed by civic groups who saw an opportunity to create a monumental structure, construction on a permanent \\"Hartford Bridge\\" began in 1903. Hartford's civic and business leaders were determined that the new bridge would be \\"an ornament to the city which should endure forever.\\" Designed by Edward Dwight Graves, the neo-classical stone arch bridge design that was selected in 1903 stood in contrast to the various truss bridge and suspension bridge in vogue at the time. To create a proper setting, the bridge commission tore down rows of tenements and constructed wide, landscaped approach boulevards on both sides of the river. The bridge opened on Oct. 6, 1908. At a total price tag of $3 million it was the most expensive bridge in the state, costing half-million dollars more than the Connecticut State Capitol building itself. Constructed from over of grey and pink granite, each ten-ton block was cut to remarkable tolerances of within a 3/8ths of an inch. When completed, the bridge connected two city streets: Morgan Street in Hartford and Hartford Avenue (now Connecticut Boulevard) in East Hartford. After his death in 1922, the span was renamed for Senator Morgan Bulkeley. The former four-term mayor of Hartford had been instrumental in the bridge's planning process. Bulkeley also served as Governor of Connecticut and United States Senator and was serving as the third president of Hartford-based Aetna Life Insurance Company. He was also elected to National Baseball Hall of Fame as the first president of the National League. As horse and buggy gave way to the automobile, the Bulkeley Bridge became the most important vehicular span in the state. Until 1942, the Bulkeley was the only motor vehicle bridge across the Connecticut River between Warehouse Point in East Windsor and Middletown. It handled a lot of cross-state traffic: US 5, US 6, and US 44, as well as earlier iterations of Connecticut Route 17 and Connecticut Route 101. Following a pair of horrific floods in 1936 and 1938 a series of levees were constructed along the banks of the Connecticut River, beginning Hartford's retreat from the waterfront and partially obscuring views of the bridge. = The Expressway Era = Congestion on city streets and the Bulkeley Bridge led the state to build an expressway bypass route and a new crossing just to the south, the Charter Oak Bridge, which opened in 1942. Founders Bridge, third and final Connecticut River crossing in the Hartford area was inaugurated in 1958. The traffic relief on the Bulkeley was short-lived, however, for much more significant changes were in the wings. By the late 1940s, work had already begun on what is now I-84, Connecticut's main east-west corridor. Morgan Street and the carefully laid out approaches to the bridge were moved or covered first by the new interstate and later by its intersection with Interstate 91. After several alternatives were discussed, Beatrice Fox Auerbach decided that the two interstates would meet at the western side of the Bulkeley Bridge indirectly so that traffic would have to pass by the G. Fox store in the center of Hartford. I-84 would use the bridge to cross into East Hartford. In 1964, the bridge was widened to eight lanes. However, two lanes in each direction are auxiliary, serving exits and entrances, leaving only two lanes in each direction for through traffic on I-84. Until Riverfront Recapture efforts of the 1980s and 1990s, the bridge remained largely hidden from view behind the flood control dikes and highways.

In his senior season, he was the team's Most Valuable Player, a First-Team All-Conference Honors selection, and a Second- Team All-San Diego selection. In his senior year, he posted an 8‚Äì2 record with a 2.99 ERA. After high school, Karstens attended Grossmont College Grossmont College and Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Texas, where he played for the Red Raiders. Professional career =New York Yankees= Karstens was drafted in the 19th round of the 2003 Major League Baseball draft by the New York Yankees. He played the season with the Yankees' Double-A affiliate, the Trenton Thunder, posting a 12‚Äì11 record with a 4.15 ERA and 147 strikeouts. He led his team in wins with 12 (3rd most in the league), in Games started with 27 (2nd in the league), and in innings pitched with 169 (4th in the league).Jeff Karstens Statistics (Minor Leagues) ‚Äì Baseball-Reference.com Karstens started the season with the Yankees Triple-A affiliate, the Columbus Clippers. He struggled, posting an 0‚Äì5 record with a 9.85 ERA. This resulted in his demotion to Double-A Trenton. At Trenton, he went 6‚Äì0 with a 2.31 ERA. His success was rewarded with a trip back to Columbus, where he compiled a 5‚Äì0 record with a 1.85 ERA. Karstens was called up from Triple-A Columbus on August 19, 2006. Three days later, he made his Major League debut for the Yankees on August 22, against the Seattle Mariners. He went 5‚Öî innings, allowing three earned runs on six hits and two walks for a no-decision in a 6‚Äì5 loss. He struck out two and gave up two home runs.Yahoo Box Score for the 08/22/2006 Game On August 27, 2006, he went 6.0 innings giving up 6 hits and 3 earned runs in an 11‚Äì8 win against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. In that outing, Karstens walked 2, struck out 1, and earned his first career Major League victory. In spring training prior to the season, Karstens had an outstanding performance. The first nine innings he pitched were the equivalent of a nine inning shutout. Following that he had a poor four run outing yet he was still considered a darkhorse to make the rotation. The most probable situation would be that he start the season as the long reliever with an occasional spot start. Karstens was shut down due to elbow tendinitis and placed on the 15-day disabled list to start the season, allowing Darrell Rasner to take his spot in the rotation, which he earned after a hamstring injury to staff ace Chien-Ming Wang. After injuries to Yankees starters Mike Mussina and Carl Pavano, he was activated to join the Yankee 40-man roster. On April 28, , in a game against the Boston Red Sox, Karstens was struck in the leg by a line drive off the bat of Boston shortstop Julio Lugo, the first batter of the game. He faced only one more batter before being taken out. It was later reported that Karstens fractured his fibula and was placed on the 15-day disabled list. He was later moved to the 60-day disabled list, and then activated on August 1. On August 14, 2007, Karstens gave up 5 earned runs in only 3 innings, raising his season ERA to 11.20. The next day, he was optioned back to the Minor Leagues. He was reactivated on September 9. Karstens began the season on the 15-day disabled list, but was later activated and immediately optioned to the minors. =Pittsburgh Pirates= On July 26, 2008, Karstens was acquired by the Pirates with Jos√© T√°bata, Ross Ohlendorf, and Daniel McCutchen from the New York Yankees for outfielder Xavier Nady and pitcher D√°maso Marte. On August 1, 2008, Jeff made his Pirates debut, defeating the Chicago Cubs. In Karsten's next start on August 6, he took a perfect game against the Arizona Diamondbacks through 7.2 innings before surrendering a double to Chris Young in the 8th inning. Karstens, and the Pirates, won 2‚Äì0 over Randy Johnson; Karstens gave up two hits and a walk. In 2009, Karstens was fined an undisclosed amount by Major League Baseball for hitting Milwaukee's Ryan Braun squarely between his shoulder blades with a pitch in April. The Brewers took exception to this and later in the season Karstens was hit by a pitch in the left shoulder by a Milwaukee pitcher. He finished his 2009 campaign of 39 games (13 of which he started) with a 4‚Äì6 record, a 5.42 ERA, gave up 12 home runs, hit 2 batsmen, walked 45, struck out 52, had a .279 average against, 1.48 walks and hits per inning pitched, in just 108 innings pitched. Karstens was designated for assignment following the 2009 season. On November 30, 2009, Karstens cleared waivers and was outrighted to the Triple-A Indianapolis Indians. In 2010, Karstens attended Pirates spring training as a non-roster invitee. He pitched relief in 8 games for a 6.23 ERA and was reassigned to the minor league camp. He began the season in the Triple-A Indianapolis bullpen, but problems with starting Pirates starting pitching prompted a call-up on April 27. Karstens was the pitching matchup in the highly anticipated debut of young phenom Stephen Strasburg, giving up 9 hits for 4 runs (4 earned) in 5 innings for his second loss of the season. On July 18, 2011, Karstens was named as the National League Player of the Week for the period of July 11‚Äì17, 2011. Karstens pitched a complete-game shutout on July 15 in a 4‚Äì0 win over the Houston Astros and became the first Pirates starter to win five consecutive decisions since Ian Snell in June 2006. Karstens had the best season of his career in 2011. Appearing in 30 games (26 starts), in which he went 9‚Äì9 with an ERA of 3.38, giving up 22 home runs, hitting 4 batsmen, walking 33, striking out 96, and having a WHIP of 1.207 through 162.1 innings.http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=5879&position;=P On November 30, 2012, Karstens was designated for assignment and then was not tendered a contract, making him a free agent. On January 15, 2013, the Pirates resigned Karstens to a 1-year deal. Karstens underwent surgery on his rotator cuff and labrum in his throwing shoulder on June 7, 2013 and was shut down for the rest of the 2013 season. On May 4, 2015, Karstens announced via Twitter and Instagram his retirement from baseball.

The brothers are bound by the simple vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience.  History  On June 16, 1819, Gabriel Deshayes, pastor at Auray and vicar general of Vannes, and Jean-Marie de Lamennais, vicar of Saint-Brieuc, two Catholic priests in France, established the Daughters of Providence and the Brothers of Christian Instruction. The first brothers took their novitiates with the Christian Brothers, whose rule was to a large extent adopted. The organization dedicated itself to promoting education among the working class in France and, eventually, across the world. The motherhouse was established at Plo√´rmel in November 1824. In 1876, the Brothers of Gascony, founded by Bishop de la Croix d‚ÄôAzolette, then Archbishop of Auch, and in 1880, the Brothers of Sainte-Marie de Tinchebray, founded by Father Charles-Augustin Duguey, subsumed themselves within the Brothers of Plo√´rmel.\\"Our History\\", La Mennais, Rome The Brothers received canonical approval by Pope Leo XIII on March 13, 1891. From the motherhouse at Plo√´rmel, the brothers founded sites in England, Africa, Asia, North America, and Oceania. In 1886 the first brothers arrived in Montreal and were shortly afterwards introduced into the United States. To escape the effects of a 1901 French law curtailing certain kinds of religious schooling, the motherhouse was transferred to Taunton, England. In 1903, following through on the strict secularism of the 1901 law, the French government dissolved the brotherhood's French presence and confiscated its properties. At the same time, they established a presence in Bulgaria, Turkey, and Egypt. The Brothers of Christian Instruction grew, extending their mission to the Philippines and Spain, and expanding it in the United Kingdom. In 2015, 1,300 members of the Brothers of Christian Instruction were spread across 25 countries.\\"Brothers of Christian Instruction\\", Ohio History Central Institutions * Coll√®ge Jean de la Mennais * St. Francis Xavier's College (Liverpool) * St. John Fisher Ibanda Secondary School * St Mary's Independent School, Southampton * St. Mary's International School * Walsh University * St. Charles Lwanga Secondary School, Kasasa in Masaka, Uganda * St. Henry's College Kitovu in Masaka, Uganda * St. Mary's College, Kisubi in Wakiso, Uganda * St. Mary's Duluti Secondary School, Arusha See also * Pell Wall Hall * Cheswardine * Consecrated life  References  External links *Official Website of the Le Mennais Brothers *Brothers of Christian Instruction at the New Advent Catholic Encyclopedia *St Edward's College, Cheswardine - former juniorate of the Brothers of Christian Instruction Religious organizations established in 1819 1819 establishments in France Catholic religious institutes established in the 19th century ","title":"Brothers of Christian Instruction"},{"id":"3514256","text":"Highway 60 is a provincial highway in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan.

Its name, which means Free Town or Free People, was granted by Jos√© de San Mart√≠n on April 10, 1822 as a recognition of the patriotism shown by its inhabitants during the Peruvian War of Independence. The district was created by law 9162 on November 5, 1940.Alberto Tauro del Pino, Enciclopedia Ilustrada del Per√∫, vol. XIII, p. 2133. The current mayor of Pueblo Libre is Jhonel Leguia and the district's postal code is 21. Pueblo Libre is a middle-class residential community and has the most parks in Lima, although it has several branches of banks, local private universities and major corporations. With a Human Development Index HDI of 0.8667 in 2007, a high level, the same that has increased in recent years. Educational coverage is 98% and service coverage reaches 99.7%. Background and Tourist Attraction Pueblo Libre was founded in 1557 as Magdalena Vieja, before being renamed Free Town (Pueblo Libre in Spanish) in 1821 by Jos√© de San Mart√≠n. The name was given because of the great patriotism and desire for freedom San Martin saw from the people. Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, a liberator from South America, lived in Pueblo Libre. His colonial mansion is known today as the Museo Nacional de Arqueolog√≠a, Antropolog√≠a e Historia Peru (The National Museum of Archaeology, Anthropology and History of Peru) which has collections of artefacts from Peruvian culture. Pueblo Libre has a rich history - museums, famous restaurants, and art galleries which are located in this providence. One of Pueblo Libre's oldest attractions is La Cruz del Viajero (The Cross of the Traveler). The cross was a symbol of faith and protection the conquistadores brought from Spain. Francisco Pizarro placed the cross in Pueblo Libre; soldiers would pray before going to war or when making a hard distant journey. Pueblo Libre is not short of places to eat great Creole food. One restaurant, El Bolivariano, is popular among local families and famous for its weekend buffets, while the historic Antigua Taberna Queirolo, owned by the Santiago Queirolo pisco makers, serves one of the best authentic food and wine in Lima. Situated not a long walk from Pueblo Libre's pleasant plaza is the Museo Rafael Larco Hererra, which houses the largest collection of Moche artefacts in the country. But perhaps the most visited museum in Lima is the Museo Nacional de Arqueolog√≠a, Antropolog√≠a e Historia Peru, located at the heart of Pueblo Libre. This museum is known for having one of the best pre-Columbian exhibits in the world. It offers incredible Paracas textiles and a huge selection of pottery. In the history section of the museum, it documents of the brutality of the Spaniards in the country, and of the challenges it has faced since its independence.

This solid is a semiconductor material with a direct band gap of 2.26 eV. It is usually a p-type semiconductor. Its crystal structure is cubic, like that for sphalerite and diamond. Properties STM images of the ZnTe(110) surface, taken at different resolutions and sample rotation, together with its atomic model. ZnTe has the appearance of grey or brownish-red powder, or ruby-red crystals when refined by sublimation.

Irradiated by a strong optical beam burns in presence of oxygen. Its lattice constant is 0.6101 nm, allowing it to be grown with or on aluminium antimonide, gallium antimonide, indium arsenide, and lead selenide.

In the wurtzite (hexagonal) crystal structure, it has lattice parameters a = 0.427 and c = 0.699 nm.Kittel, C. (1976) Introduction to Solid State Physics, 5th edition, p. 28. Applications =Optoelectronics= Zinc telluride can be easily doped, and for this reason it is one of the more common semiconducting materials used in optoelectronics. ZnTe is important for development of various semiconductor devices, including blue LEDs, laser diodes, solar cells, and components of microwave generators. It can be used for solar cells, for example, as a back-surface field layer and p-type semiconductor material for a CdTe/ZnTe structure or in PIN diode structures. The material can also be used as a component of ternary semiconductor compounds, such as CdxZn(1-x)Te (conceptually a mixture composed from the end-members ZnTe and CdTe), which can be made with a varying composition x to allow the optical bandgap to be tuned as desired. =Nonlinear optics= Zinc telluride together with lithium niobate is often used for generation of pulsed terahertz radiation in time- domain terahertz spectroscopy and terahertz imaging. When a crystal of such material is subjected to a high-intensity light pulse of subpicosecond duration, it emits a pulse of terahertz frequency through a nonlinear optical process called optical rectification.THz Generation and Detection in ZnTe. chem.yale.edu Conversely, subjecting a zinc telluride crystal to terahertz radiation causes it to show optical birefringence and change the polarization of a transmitting light, making it an electro-optic detector. Vanadium-doped zinc telluride, \\"ZnTe:V\\", is a non-linear optical photorefractive material of possible use in the protection of sensors at visible wavelengths. ZnTe:V optical limiters are light and compact, without complicated optics of conventional limiters. ZnTe:V can block a high-intensity jamming beam from a laser dazzler, while still passing the lower-intensity image of the observed scene. It can also be used in holographic interferometry, in reconfigurable optical interconnections, and in laser optical phase conjugation devices. It offers superior photorefractive performance at wavelengths between 600‚Äì1300 nm, in comparison with other III-V and II-VI compound semiconductors. By adding manganese as an additional dopant (ZnTe:V:Mn), its photorefractive yield can be significantly increased.

Early life Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, she moved to Chicago when she was six. She stayed there for a time, and in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, before she settled in Chicago. She was sixteen when by curiosity she happened by the Essanay Studios. She was told she had a camera face. She began working there at a salary of $35/week. It was soon increased to $75 a week ($ today). In a few years the actress was earning $350 weekly. Film career Her first films were The Rivals and The Loan Shark, both in 1912. She played the feminine lead in the latter. Under contract to Essanay at this time was Gloria Swanson. It is said that Swanson wept because her eyes were blue and not brown as were Bayne's. Brown eyes were considered preferable for photography then. Other actors on the lot were Wallace Beery, Charlie Chaplin, and Francis X. Bushman. Bushman demanded Beverly as his female lead, and soon they were a romantic duo, appearing in 24 films. Their first film together was Pennington's Choice (1915). In 1916 the couple made Romeo and Juliet, which generated a sizeable profit. Bushman and Bayne were married in 1918, only three days after Bushman divorced his wife. Bayne and Bushman left Essanay and made films for Metro Pictures from 1916‚Äì1918 and are credited as the first romantic team in film. In 1919-1920 the couple starred in a play, The Master Thief, based on a story by Richard Washburn Child, which did well. Later they appeared in vaudeville and as guest stars in dramatic stock. Eventually the two drifted apart. Bayne and Bushman divorced in 1925, and her career went into decline after that. Soon both she and Bushman were out of motion pictures. On reflecting, Bushman believed their demise in films was caused by a new valet who inadvertently snubbed Louis B. Mayer. The movie mogul had called on him during a personal appearance tour. Others contend that the Hollywood establishment disapproved of Bushman divorcing his wife and marrying the much younger Bayne. Bayne later married Charles T. Hvass, and they lived on a farm in Piscataway, New Jersey. Her final silent film was Passionate Youth in 1925. Unable to make a comeback, she worked on stage productions and on Broadway throughout the 1930s and 1940s. During the early 1940s, Miss Bayne performed in radio and did an occasional play. During World War II her serious work involved British War Relief. Her only sound film was The Naked City (1948) with Barry Fitzgerald and Howard Duff. It was also her last film. In 1960, Bayne received a motion pictures star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1752 Vine Street.

C. Husband, was a leading British civil and consulting engineer from Sheffield, England, who designed bridges and other major civil engineering works. He is particularly known for his work on the Jodrell Bank radio telescopes; the first of these was the largest fully steerable radio telescope in the world on its completion in 1957. Other projects he was involved in designing include the Goonhilly Satellite Earth Station's aerials, one of the earliest telecobalt radiotherapy units, Sri Lanka's tallest building, and the rebuilding of Robert Stephenson's Britannia Bridge after a fire. He won the Royal Society's Royal Medal and the Wilhelm Exner Medal. Early life and education Lovell radio telescope at Jodrell Bank Husband was born in Sheffield in 1908 to Ellen Walton Husband, n√©e Harby, and her husband, Joseph (1871‚Äì1961), a civil engineer who had founded Sheffield Technical School's civil engineering department and subsequently served as the University of Sheffield's initial professor in the discipline. Charles Husband attended the city's King Edward VII School and gained an engineering degree at Sheffield University in 1929. Career His first job was with Barnsley Water Board. He then worked under the civil engineer Sir Owen Williams in 1931‚Äì33, before spending three years on various major English and Scottish residential projects with the First National Housing Trust. In 1936, with Joseph Husband and Antony Clark, he founded the consulting engineering firm of Husband and Clark (later Husband & Co.) in Sheffield. During the Second World War, he first worked in the Ministry of Labour and National Service and later on aircraft manufacture for the Ministry of Works. After the war, Husband headed the engineering consultancy, successfully expanding their business, with clients in the immediate post-war years including the British Iron and Steel Research Association, National Coal Board and the Production Engineering Research Association. =Radio telescopes= Construction of the 250-ft telescope Husband worked with Bernard Lovell ‚Äì the founder of the Jodrell Bank Observatory near Holmes Chapel in Cheshire ‚Äì on the design and construction of the observatory's first large steerable radio telescope, the \\"250-ft telescope\\" (now known as the Lovell Telescope). After attempting to adapt military radar equipment to detect cosmic rays shortly after the Second World War, Lovell had realised that a much larger aerial would be required, and constructed a 66-metre diameter dish, limited by being static, before proposing the development of an even larger steerable telescope. The idea posed such formidable engineering challenges that the project had been declared \\"impossible\\" by other engineers,Lovell 1968, p. 25 but Husband is reported to have concluded at their first meeting in September 1949, \\"It should be easy‚Äîabout the same problem as throwing a swing bridge over the Thames at Westminster.\\"Lovell 1968, p. 28 He began work on the project early the following year, creating the initial drawings in January 1950 and detailed plans just over a year later.Robertson 1992, pp. 114‚Äì15, 138 He and Lovell selected a dish diameter of 250 feet (76 metres).Robertson 1992, p. 115 Construction began in 1952; despite Husband's optimism the project was beset with delays and escalating costs, caused by multiple changes to Lovell's specifications and the rising price of steel, among other factors.Robertson 1992, p. 139 Wind-tunnel studies with a scale model played an important role in the final design. The telescope was eventually completed in 1957, when it was the largest fully steerable radio telescope in the world. It remains in service as of 2016. According to Lovell, the project was completed using \\"a desk calculator and slide rule\\", which led to a \\"sturdy\\" construction with \\"quite a lot of redundancy in the steelwork\\" which Lovell later credited for the telescope's longevity. The structure is a rare example of a post-war grade-I-listed structure, denoting its \\"exceptional interest\\", and was voted Britain's top \\"unsung landmark\\" in a 2006 BBC poll. Husband also helped to design the steerable radio aerials at the GPO's Goonhilly Satellite Earth Station in Cornwall, as well as radio telescopes in the UK and elsewhere. =Other projects= Britannia Bridge after rebuilding Other innovative projects Husband & Co. undertook under Husband's leadership included designing a facility for testing jet engines at altitude in 1946. In the 1950s, Husband assisted the radiologist Frank Ellis in designing one of the earliest telecobalt radiotherapy units, for radiation treatment of cancer, which was installed at the Churchill Hospital in Oxford. Like the radio telescopes, the engineering problem involved moving a heavy weight, in this case the lead- shielded source, in three dimensions. He designed many road and rail bridges. Husband was awarded the contract to rebuild the Britannia Bridge over the Menai Strait in Wales, after a 1970 fire. The original was an 1850 rail bridge by Robert Stephenson, and Husband faced criticism for designing a double-tier bridge including an additional road deck, which he stated formed part of Stephenson's original concept. The firm also designed the bridge used in the 1957 film, The Bridge on the River Kwai.Eagan 2009, p. 537 Outside the UK, Husband & Co. had an office in Colombo and undertook multiple projects in Sri Lanka. Husband was the architect of the Ceylon Insurance Building in Colombo, Sri Lanka (later Ceylinco House), a 16-storey building equipped with a helicopter landing pad on its roof. On completion in 1960, it was the tallest structure in Sri Lanka, at nearly 55 metres. Awards, honours and societies Husband was recognised with the CBE in 1964. He won the Royal Medal of the Royal Society in 1965 for \\"his distinguished work in many aspects of engineering, particularly for his design studies of large structures such as those exemplified in the radio telescope at Jodrell Bank and Goonhilly Downs\\"; he was the medal's first recipient in the applied sciences. He was also awarded the Wilhelm Exner Medal of the √ñsterreichischer Gewerbeverein (1966), the Gold Medal of the Institution of Structural Engineers (1973), and the Benjamin Baker Gold Medal (1959) and James Watt medal (1976) of the Institution of Civil Engineers. He received honorary degrees from the universities of Manchester (1964) and Sheffield (1967). He was knighted in 1975. He served as president of the Institution of Structural Engineers (1964‚Äì65), chaired the Association of Consulting Engineers (1967) and served on the board of the Council of Engineering Institutions from 1979 until his death. He also chaired Sheffield University's engineering and metallurgy advisory committee (1962‚Äì65) and served on Bradford Institute of Technology's civil engineering advisory board (1962‚Äì68). In addition to the Institution of Structural Engineers, he was an elected fellow of the American Society of Civil Engineers, Institution of Civil Engineers and the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, and was among the founding members of the Fellowship of Engineering. Personal life In 1932, Husband married Eileen Margaret Nowill (born 1906/7), an architect's daughter who was also from Sheffield. The couple had four children, with the elder of their two sons, Richard Husband, also becoming a civil engineer. He retired in 1982. Husband died in 1983 at Nether Padley, just outside Sheffield in Derbyshire. Selected publications *H. C. Husband, R. W. Husband (1975). Reconstruction of the Britannia Bridge.

They are named after Boris Yeltsin, the first President of Russia after the breakup of the Soviet Union. Their first full- length album, Broom, was independently released in 2005. They are now signed with Polyvinyl Record Co. Biography Will Knauer and Philip Dickey were friends in high school. Phil and John Robert Cardwell met in 2002 during their freshman year of college and started writing songs together. From 2002 to 2004, the group recorded demos at home and in their dorm rooms while playing local shows in Springfield and Columbia, Missouri. The group's first release was a split EP with the vocal duo Gwyn and Grace in 2004. In Fall 2004 the group began recording their first full-length album, Broom, at Knauer's house, which is featured in much of the band's artwork. Broom was released in March 2005. The debut was seen as an indie success, and received favorable press in Spin Magazine and internet buzz from blogs like You Ain't No Picasso and Bars and Guitars, while Pitchfork gave the album an average rating, 6.9/10.0. Shortly after releasing Broom, SSLYBY released a split record with Michael Holt, formerly of the Mommyheads, on Catbird Records (a label started by the blog site Catbirdseat) in 2005. In February 2006, the band went on their first national support tour opening up for Catfish Haven (from the Secretly Canadian label). On the same tour, the group recorded their first session for the music website Daytrotter. Later that year, the band's song \\"Oregon Girl\\" was featured on an episode of The OC. The group signed to Polyvinyl Records in June 2006 and re-released Broom in October 2006. Because the original version of the album was recorded by the band with their own equipment (including a Boss digital multitrack recorder using only Shure SM57 and SM58 microphones), it was not professionally mastered to the same level as most industry-standard releases. The lo-fi sound drew many critics and listeners to the band. In July 2007, SSLYBY performed at the Afisha Picnic music festival in Moscow, Russia, just three months after the death of Boris Yeltsin. The group returned to Springfield to record their highly anticipated follow up to Broom. Unable to record at Knauer's house because of noise complaints, the band moved their home recording studio to Knauer's aunt's house. Pershing was released on April 8, 2008 on Polyvinyl Records. The album spawned three music videos: \\"Think I Wanna Die\\" directed by Grammy-nominated director Israel Anthem and featuring members of the band Eisley, and \\"Modern Mystery\\" and \\"Glue Girls\\", both directed by Brook Linder. The band was named the \\"best new band in Missouri\\" by the Boston Phoenix despite the \\"cutesy, irritating quality of its six-word name\\". Pershing was named the best album of 2008 by the blogs It's Hard to Find A Friend, The Stark Online, and The Power Pop Show. Blender Magazine ranked \\"Dead Right\\" as one of the top 200 songs of 2008. In 2008 the band released a split EP with the Liverpool band Puzzle, licensed their song \\"Anne Elephant\\" to a MasterCard commercial, and made their network television performance debut on the Carson Daly Show.http://consequenceofsound.net/2008/05/16/late-night-recap-someone-still- loves-you-boris-yeltsin-on-carson-daly/ SSLYBY's third album under Polyvinyl, Let It Sway, was produced by Chris Walla of Death Cab for Cutie and Beau Sorenson. On October 22, 2010, NME.com debuted the music video for \\"Sink/Let It Sway\\" directed by Brook Linder. The band and Linder would pair up again in early 2011 to make a video for \\"Critical Drain\\", which premiered on MTV.com. In early 2011, the band supported Tokyo Police Club on a US tour. Later that year, they released Tape Club, a collection of b-sides and rarities.http://consequenceofsound.net/2011/08/someone-still-loves-you-boris- yeltsin-readies-tape-club-compilation/ The band released a new album on September 17, 2013 entitled Fly by Wire. News of this album coincides with John Robert's departure from the band. As Phil would now be required to cover vocals full-time, Tom Hembree was brought back to the band to take over bassist duties, and Phil's sister Roni was added as a keyboardist. On March 5, 2015, it was announced via the band's official Twitter page that a new album would be released in the summer of 2015. A teaser trailer for the album was simultaneously released on YouTube. Later that month, on March 26, it was announced that the album would be called \\"The High Country\\" and that it would be released on June 2, 2015.

For 43 years, the 13 counties around Tampa Bay, including cities such as Sarasota, Ellenton, and Port Charlotte were in area code 813. In 1998, Pinellas County and the western part of Pasco County were split into area code 727. 727 was originally going to be introduced in an overlay plan, to overlay 813. At the time, overlays were a new concept and since overlays result in mixing area codes within the same area (issuing the new code to new numbers) requiring 10-digit dialing, they were often met with public resistance at the time. With this in mind, GTE (now part of Frontier Communications), the dominant carrier in most of the Tampa Bay Area, switched the proposal to a split plan.

The army was transferred to reinforce the Confederate Army of the Potomac at the First Battle of Bull Run, which was its only major action. After the battle, the army was merged into the Army of the Potomac. History The Army of the Shenandoah originated with the various militia and volunteer companies sent to seize and defend the town of Harpers Ferry, Virginia (modern day West Virginia). To organize and train the companies, Virginia state commander Robert E. Lee initially appointed Thomas J. Jackson to command the post. Jackson formed five regiments of infantry and a battery of artillery from the various companies, forming the basis of the Stonewall Brigade. On May 15, Joseph E. Johnston replaced Jackson as commander of Harpers Ferry and continued to receive additional regiments from throughout the Confederacy. He would eventually have four brigades of infantry and an independent regiment of cavalry, the 1st Virginia Cavalry commanded by J. E. B. Stuart.Davis, pp. 17‚Äì21, 83‚Äì84, 133. In mid-June, forces from the Union Department of Pennsylvania commanded by Robert Patterson began moving south towards Harpers Ferry. Fearing that the terrain around the town made it indefensible, Johnston had the bridges and as much equipment in the town as possible destroyed and retreated south to Winchester; Patterson remained along the Potomac River rather than pursue Johnston. Over the next few weeks, both forces watched each other, only engaging in battle once at Falling Waters on July 2.Davis, pp. 81‚Äì85. After spending almost two weeks waiting on the Potomac and receiving reinforcements, Patterson started advancing towards Winchester but had moved only before encountering Stuart's regiment screening Johnston's army. Patterson halted again and consulted his officers, who advised caution; this advice, along with the refusal of several regiments which were due for mustering out to remain any longer, convinced Patterson to cancel the advance. This allowed Johnston to follow orders he received on July 18 to transfer his army to reinforce P. G. T. Beauregard's Army of the Potomac at Manassas Junction. The movement started that evening, with each brigade marching to Piedmont where it boarded a train for Manassas Junction. Since there was only one train on the Manassas Gap Railroad, the brigades arrived one at a time; the artillery and cavalry marched overland. The final units of Johnston's army arrived on the afternoon of July 21.Gottfried, p. 8; Davis, pp. 134‚Äì142. Since he was senior to Beauregard, Johnston had command over the two armies present. Before Johnston arrived at Manassas, Beauregard had drawn up plans for an attack on the Union army of Irvin McDowell across Bull Run on July 21, using brigades from both armies, and Johnston approved the plan, allowing Beauregard to issue the necessary orders in his name. However, the orders were vague and contradictory, which confused the brigade commanders and prevented the attack from taking place.Detzel, pp. 152, 184, 217‚Äì218. On the morning of July 21, McDowell launched his own attack on the Confederate left wing, defended by one of Beauregard's brigades. As the battle escalated in the area of Matthews Hill and Henry House Hill, additional Confederate brigades were moved to the left flank. Eventually, all four of Johnston's brigades and four out of Beauregard's eight brigades were engaged in this area. It was while defending Henry House Hill that Jackson received his nickname of \\"Stonewall\\", which also became the name of his brigade.Gottfried, pp. 26‚Äì69. After the battle Johnston's and Beauregard's commands were consolidated into the Department of Northern Virginia, with their merged army using the name \\"Army of the Potomac\\"; Johnston retained command of the army, with Beauregard remaining as second in command until his transfer to the western theater.Davis, p. 257.

It is situated near the river Marbella on the slope of a hill southeast of C√≥rdoba by road. The population of the town is 20,266 (2012). History The site of the Roman town (Baniana or Biniana) could still be traced as late as the First World War, with various Roman antiquities excavated from the site. In 1833, a subterranean vault was discovered, containing twelve cinerary urns with inscriptions commemorating members of the Pompeian family. The hill is crowned by fortifications. In 1292, the Moors under Mahommed II of Granada vainly besieged the citadel, which was held for Sancho IV of Castile; the five Moorish heads in its coat-of-arms commemorates the occasion. The castile was a base for Gonzalo de Cordova and was held in the 19th century by the Altamira family. At that time, it held four parish churches and three schools conducted by sisters of charity. The girls' school held a high reputation in its province, despite not going beyond reading, writing, arithmetic, and religious instruction. Its population was around 12,000 in the 1870s and 15,000 by the turn of the century. Grain and olive oil were the principal articles of commerce in the 19th century; by the time of the First World War, horse- breeding and linen-weaving had also developed, despite the nearest railroad station being at Luque. At the beginning of the Spanish Civil War the town was the scenario of the Baena Massacre, a ruthless mass-execution of Spanish republicans where about 700 loyalists were murdered by the orders of rebel Colonel S√°enz de Buruaga.Sevilla FC ForumThe massacre of Baena Paul Preston (2012).

He is an all-rounder, and represented the national team in a One Day International, as well as performing well for Lancashire over many years. He bowls right-arm fast-medium, and is a right-handed batsman. With six first- class centuries to his name, Chapple shares with Mark Pettini the record for fastest first-class century, scored against declaration bowling by Glamorgan in 1993, coming off just 27 balls. Chapple played a single One Day International for England, against Ireland in 2006 but was injured after bowling one over. After Stuart Law left the club, Chapple was appointed as Lancashire's captain from the 2009 season onwards and led the county to victory in the 2011 County Championship. That year he became the fifth player to score 7,000 runs and take 700 wickets for Lancashire. In 2012 he was named as one of Wisden's five Cricketers of the Year. Career Chapple's most notable achievements include winning the Gold Award for his 6/18 in the 1996 Natwest Trophy final against Essex at Lord's. He shares with Mark Pettini the record for fastest ever first-class century; he scored it against Glamorgan at Old Trafford in 1993 from just 27 balls and 21 minutes, although this was against the bowling of Matthew Maynard and Tony Cottey in an attempt to set up a declaration. Chapple was named Lancashire's Player of the Year for the 2002 Season. In August 2003, Chapple was one of three uncapped players ‚Äì along with spin bowler Gareth Batty and batsman Ed Smith ‚Äì to be selected in the England's 13-man squad from which the final team to face South Africa in the third Test at Trent Bridge would be chosen. According to Geoff Miller, one of the selectors, said the selectors had \\"picked Gareth Batty and Glen Chapple as extra spin and quick bowling options, both of whom have performed well this season for their respective counties\\". When he was chosen for the squad, Chapple had taken 27 wickets and averaged 45.18 with the bat for the season. Chapple was not selected for the final eleven. He was awarded a benefit season by Lancashire in 2004. After Chapple helped Lancashire win the County Championship Division Two title in 2005, taking 47 wickets at an average of 21.48, he made an impressive start to the 2006 season which saw him take 23 wickets with an average of 21.56 with the ball and 43 with the bat in the opening six Championship matches. Due to his form, Chapple made his international debut on 13 June 2006 against Ireland at Belfast. After bowling four wicketless overs against Ireland, Chapple had to pull out of the squad to face Sri Lanka with an abdominal injury, and has not played for England since. In 2006, he became only the tenth player to achieve the 5,000 run and 500 wicket first-class double for Lancashire. Chapple has also represented England in the Hong Kong Sixes. He played in the England team that won the tournament in 2003 and again in 2004. In 2006, Chapple played in the Sixes team alongside two other Lancashire players, captain Dominic Cork and batsman Mal Loye. On 31 May 2013, in the game against Gloucestershire at Aigburth, Glen Chapple took his 900th wicket when had Michael Klinger caught by Andrea Agathangelou at second slip. Only Johnny Briggs and Jack Simmons have now scored more runs and taken more wickets for Lancashire than Chapple. James Anderson, who recently claimed his 300th Test wicket against New Zealand Tweeted this tribute, 'Huge congratulations to Glen Chapple on taking his 900th first-class wicket! I've not played with anyone who works harder.' Captaincy When Stuart Law was released by Lancashire in October 2008, after the season had ended, Chapple replaced him as captain. Speaking of his appointment, Chapple said \\"it's a privilege to play for such a big county, and an even bigger honour to be captaining the club I've been involved with for the past 18 years. I'm a product of the Lancashire system, and I look forward to leading a very talented squad of players to future success\\". Despite missing five County Championship matches of the 2009 season through injury, Chapple was named Lancashire's Championship Player of the Year. Before the start of the 2010 season, Chapple declared his intention to play in every one of Lancashire's matches. However, as he had suffered injuries over the previous three years, coach Peter Moores decided not to pick Chapple for most of Lancashire's 40-over matches and some T20s to maintain his fitness for the County Championship. Although Chapple was injured in July and missed a couple of T20 matches, he recovered quickly enough that he did not miss a fixture of the County Championship. At the start of 2011, Lancashire were widely tipped to face relegation from the first division of the County Championship. Against Yorkshire in May, Chapple became the fifth Lancashire player to score 7,000 runs and take 700 wickets for the club. Chapple passed the landmark of 800 first-class wickets in May 2011 during a match against Warwickshire. His 800th wicket was that of batsman William Porterfield. Victory in the match sent Lancashire to the top of the County Championship. In the last match of the season, Lancashire won the County Championship for the first time since 1950 when they shared the title. In his fifth over of the match Chapple experienced pain in his right hamstring, and feared he may have torn it. He returned to the field with strapping and on the final day, when he claimed his 800th wicket for Lancashire, he produced what Michael Atherton considered to be his most threatening bowling in a decade. For his efforts in taking Lancashire to the title, Chapple was named as one of Wisden five Cricketers of the Year in 2012. He said \\"Personally I had a good season but that wouldn't, in itself, be enough normally to win this award. The credit has to go to the players for the way they performed last year. It was a fantastic year for Lancashire and all the lads who played so well have obviously played a big part in me receiving this award.\\" Lancashire's title defence began with three defeats and two draws in their first five matches of the 2012 County Championship. In a match against Warwickshire in April Chapple jarred his ankle in the field and was on pain killers, and in the return fixture left the field with a side injury but returned to the squad for the next County Championship match.

Early life John Bruce Wallace a/k/a jacewbal was born February 6, 1950, in Calais, Maine, United States. John exhibited an affinity for the performing arts at an early age, first in acting, playing the lead roles in grade school plays, later he expanded his interests to include singing solo for his grade school classmates. Encouraged by his father to take up trumpet, he began studying clarinet while in grade school. By high school John had found \\"the Guitar\\" and would perform almost daily during summers on his family's front porch for the traffic passing by. Bands formed during this time were all short lived usually breaking up due to disagreements over the musical direction that the group members wanted to go in. John's early influences included Sun Ra, Pink Floyd, Frank Zappa, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, and Jimi Hendrix. After high school, John moved to Portland, Maine, to pursue music. He started several groups which all failed due to musical differences, although one failed after the band's equipment was stolen. However, during this time he would fill in on guitar for a number of traveling bands that were performing in night clubs in Portland. He was also at this time becoming more influenced by Experimental music, Progressive Metal, Avant garde, Rock, and Jazz. On an invite to come to New York City to further develop musically, John gained insight into the inner musical culture opening potential doorways to pathways for future exploration. This move focused John's attention more closely at free improvisation, jazz, and 'free jazz' as practiced in Europe, by established artists such as Ornette Coleman, Anthony Braxton, Sun Ra, Cecil Taylor, Derek Bailey, and by certain young artists at the time beginning to work in Alphabet City on New York's lower East Side. Career Being recognized for developing a new approach to electric guitar, the prime focus of his musical work is the expansion of the voicings of the electric guitar through improvised compositions. A free jazz solo performer interested in freely improvised music with a focus on generating extended sound statements within the options afforded through solo performance. His approach incorporates totally improvised sound expressions with emphasis on deconstruction of structure and pattern - while generating a narrative of the moment. His improvised compositions often incorporate multi-tonal qualities, dense, interwoven passages embellished with harmonic and micro-tonal sound statements, or silence further defined by irregular syntaxed rhythms and primitive beats. These extempore compositions incorporate complex musical riddles wherein are displayed the qualities of multiple instrument arrangements. His music was invited for performance consideration at the American Pavilion during the 1991 S√£o Paulo Art Biennial, in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. His recordings and performances have received reviews in leading foreign and domestic trade journals and publications as well as online media. In the independent music magazine Forced Exposure it was written about John,\\"For a guy whose list of desert islands discs contains works by Scelsi, Globokar, Kagel, Xenakis & others of the same ilk, it's interesting to hear such a loud, aggressively rock-like, feedback laden approach to solo...electric guitar.\\" Tours have included festivals in Russia and Lithuania, at the Vilnius Jazz Festival. In his Jazz Podium review of the Vilnius Festival Bernd Jahnke wrote \\"Solo guitarist John Bruce Wallace, in free improvisation, revamped the modern guitar tradition and, using the technical possibilities of his instrument, transferred it into an individual sound language.\\" In a 1994 review of Wallace's improvisational album Loud Noises in a Corner: Engagements on Urban Terrain, Mark Jenkins wrote in Washington City Paper \\"Wallace is a lot less predictable than that of many guitar warriors, and the best of it has a savage beauty that Eddie Van Halen couldn't achieve with six months of overdubs.\\"Picking Himself Into a Corner, October 28, 1994 His recordings have received radio and Internet airplay across the United States, Canada, Europe, Russia, Central and South America, Australia, and Asia. With the release of the album Taming The Day he joined the roster of Throne of Bael Recordshttps://throneofbael.bandcamp.com/album/taming-the-day an experimental record label in the United Kingdom and has made his Discography available via Internet media services.https://soundcloud.com/john-bruce- wallace/albumshttps://johnbrucewallaceakajacewbal.bandcamp.com He has recorded collaborations with Siegfried Grundmann, Wilfried Hanrath (Hauchzart Ensemble), and Ewald W√∂stefeld (Vaders Orchestra).

The need to express graphically traces back to when he was in grade school. As with his musical sound statements the concern is with the human condition and how we find ourselves in an alienating environment. Figurative images have explored the emotional aspects of the human experience, painted in oil done in a style that incorporated the use of his fingers in lieu of brushes; abstract images have explored the definition of the surface, as‚Äìwell-as color. He has exhibited in several shows in New York City and Washington, DC, as-well-as, shows in Chicago, Minneapolis, Missouri, Maryland, Maine, and Virginia. He also holds degrees in Philosophy from the University of Southern Maine (USM) and Information Systems Management from the University of Maryland University College (UMUC), a Certificate in Information Management from UMUC, and a Certificate in Legal Studies from Antioch School of Law. He studied Philosophy at the University of Oregon. He has published a monograph in philosophy on Solipsism titled Genesis: Involvement: Generation \\"Deals with the philosophical issues concerning the problems of solipsism: the search for the 'self' and its relation to the world. Addressing such traditional questions as the nature of epistemological certainty, metaphysics, and the adequacy of logic and science as foundations of thought, the author expands his investigation to include an examination of the individual and the social sciences. The author draws upon the thought of various philosophers, contending that both metaphysical solipsism and epistemological solipsism are faulty notions seeded in an equally faulty endeavor The Quest for Certainty, concluding that it is necessary to return to the Socratic maxim, 'Know Thyself', as a pluralistic field of consciousness.\\", as well as papers on Artificial Intelligence and Consciousness, and Information Systems Management. In the early 1990s John became afflicted with Meniere's Disease, a disorder of the inner ear that usually affects both hearing and balance. It is characterized by episodes of vertigo, random and extreme fluctuation of sound volume, and by fluctuating or permanent tinnitus and hearing loss, which presented unique challenges to performances and recording, the resolution of these allowed an expansion of thought as to how sound production was perceived in terms of amplification and microphone placement, as well as refinement in left hand fingering and right hand fingering, percussive techniques, strum and 'string feathering'.

Charles Daly Firearms of the United States imported Miroku over/under shotguns throughout the 1960s to early 1970s. Afterwards, Miroku found a new outlet for the over/under models under Browning, explaining the similarities from late models imported by Daly to early Browning Citori Type 1 models. This also coincides with FN and Miroku's joint buyout of Brownings stock in 1977. Miroku manufactured a few different models of handguns between the 1960s and the 1980s, though these were not widely distributed. Among the most common is the \\"Liberty Chief\\" model, .38 caliber revolver. They briefly manufactured copies of the Browning BL22, a .22 lever-action rifle, under the name of Miroku ML22. This model was popular with Australian rabbit hunters due to its low price and a high magazine capacity of 15 rounds.

The population peaked at 329 in 1904 before declining to 225 by the 1970s, a figure it has maintained fairly consistently since. Shortly after midnight on June 15, 1960, a freak meteorological phenomenon, a heat burst, struck the community when a dying thunderstorm collapsed over Kopperl. The storm had rained itself out, and with little to no precipitation to cool the resulting downdrafts, superheated air descended upon the community in the form of extremely hot wind gusts of up to .

This method of pollination is done by manually transferring pollen from the stamen of one plant to the pistil of another. This is often done with a cotton swab or small brush, but can also be done by removing the petals from a male flower and brushing it against the stigmas of female flowers, or by simply shaking flowers in the case of bisexual flowers, such as tomatoes. Common reasons for choosing this method include the lack of pollinators, keeping control of cross-pollination between varieties grown together, and creating specific hybrids. Examples of this are vanilla plants, which are transported to areas where its natural pollinator doesn't exist, or plants grown in greenhouses, urban areas, or with a cover to control pests, where natural pollinators cannot reach them. Pollinator decline and the concentrated pollination needs of monoculture can also be a factor. However, these are not the only reasons, and variable techniques for hand-pollination have arisen for many specialty crops. For instance, hand-pollination is used with date palms to avoid wasting space and energy growing sufficient male plants for adequate natural pollination. Because of the level of labor involved, hand-pollination is only an option on a small scale, used chiefly by small market gardeners and owners of individual plants. On large-scale operations, such as field crops, orchards, or commercial seed production, honeybees or other pollinators are a more efficient approach to pollination management. Despite this, hand- pollination is a fairly widespread practice. Pears grown in Hanyuan County, China have been hand-pollinated since the 1980s, because they can't be pollinated with other varieties that have different flowering times; also, lice infestation requires the use of many insecticide sprays, which causes local beekeepers to refuse to lend beehives.

It is located in the Cono Sur area of the city of Lima. Officially established as a district on January 12, 1965, the current mayor (alcalde) of San Juan de Miraflores is Cristina Nina Garnica. The district's postal code is 29. San Juan de Miraflores is one of the pueblos nuevos, or new towns, that have been formed by the massive numbers of people moving from other towns of Metropolitan Lima (such as Miraflores, Surquillo, La Victoria, among others) and from the countryside. During the early 1960s, SJM was mostly a desert area. SJM is divided into zones (\\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"C\\", \\"D\\", \\"E\\", and \\"K\\"). In the early 80's, people from Cuzco, Ayacucho, Pasco, and many of the other departments that were under the attack of terrorists chose SJM and Villa El Salvador as their new home. As new residents were coming into SJM, two new zones were created: Pamplona Alta and Pamplona Baja. This name was taken in honor of some of the Spanish missionaries (who were from Pamplona, Spain) who offered their help to the residents. One of Pamplona Alta's mains streets, \\"Pista Nueva\\" or \\"New Street\\", is an example of how new the area is. When it was first settled, many people lived without electricity, water or plumbing, often building their houses from reed mats into the steep hills, with treacherous paths leading to the houses at the top. As residents could afford building materials, they would begin to reinforce these reed mats with plywood, bricks, or whatever else they could find. Today the houses are a hodgepodge of building materials, most in a state of continual construction as residents can afford each additional brick. Most have access to electricity, but many still lack running water or plumbing. In just the last couple of years the mayor of Lima has launched an extremely successful program to build concrete staircases, or \\"escapers\\", into the hillsides, replacing the treacherous paths and dramatically improving the living conditions of residents. These staircases are distinctively painted yellow, with bright blue signs, and neighborhood residents are hired by the city to build them. In addition to these new zones, 2 more were created. By the year 1981, America and Umamarca were created. Usually, these new zones are well known because of its highly interest of being better every day, since most of the owners are the people who worked most of their lives (and still do) in Ciudad de Dios' Market. These areas were urbanized quickly. By 1983 and 1984, two new more zones had been created - Maria Auxiliadora and Amauta (\\"teacher\\" in English), located between zones \\"A\\" and \\"B\\". One of the main streets of Maria Auxiliadora is Pedro Miotta, which was well known as the former Panamericana Sur freeway. Within Lima, particularly in public transportation terms, \\"San Juan\\" generally refers to San Juan de Miraflores; San Juan de Lurigancho, which is north of the R√≠mac River and is of larger size, is denoted by its individual sections, such as Z√°rate, Campoy, Mangomarca, Canto Grande, etc. Geography The district has a total land area of 23.98 km¬≤.

Anderson, who conceived the Tales book series, and wrote one of the stories as well.  Contents  = Therefore I Am: The Tale of IG-88 = Written by the editor, Kevin J. Anderson, the story of assassin android IG-88 and his three brothers is told from their perspectives, which are automatically shared with one another. When the Imperial engineers realize the droid is sentient, they attempt to shut it down, which triggers a defense mechanism. IG-88 kills everyone in the production plant, and goes on the run in an attempt to free other droids in his product line. Two of the four are dismantled by Boba Fett shortly after Darth Vader places a bounty on Han Solo. The original droid is revealed to be uploaded to the second Death Star, where he plays tricks on the Emperor. The title is a reference to Enlightenment philosopher's Ren√© Descartes \\"I think, therefore I am.\\" An IG-88 model whose fate is left unknown is killed by Dash Rendar in the video game Shadows of the Empire (1996). = Payback: The Tale of Dengar = The story of Dengar was written by Dave Wolverton. He is revealed to have gained his injuries in a hovercar race against Han Solo on their shared home planet of Corellia. Shortly before the events of The Empire Strikes Back, Dengar works as an assassin and falls in love with the dancer Manaroo. He pursues Solo to take his revenge, and is captured by the Empire upon Hoth. Vader lets him live with the understanding that he is to capture Solo and his friends alive. He competes with Boba Fett, who spares no punches, to take his bounty. When Manaroo is taken captive on Cloud City, he shoots stormtroopers to free her. He learns to communicate with her psychically and travels to her homeworld to rescue some of her people from Imperial oppression. On Tatooine, Dengar sees Han Solo frozen in carbonite and considers killing Jabba the Hutt. Boba Fett deduces his plans, and binds him to the desert floor, where he witnesses the Millennium Falcon depart. Reaching out with his feelings, he is able to contact Manaroo, who comes to free him. Together, they save the naked Boba Fett, whose armor was destroyed by a thermal detonator he used to free himself from the sarlacc. = The Prize Pelt: The Tale of Bossk = The story of Bossk is told by Kathy Tyers. Through the perspective of human female Tinian and her Wookiee mentor Chen, who join Bossk in a hunt for Chewbacca, who is attempting to capture the bounty on Han Solo. Bossk attempts to double-cross his companions, who use a thumb-sized robot to subvert his ship's computer. = Of Possible Futures: The Tale of Zuckuss and 4-LOM = The tale of the duo Zuckuss and 4-LOM was written by M. Shayne Bell. Zuckuss, who is able to intuit possible futures, meditates shortly before the bounty hunter scene in The Empire Strikes Back, and the duo encounters survivors from the Battle of Hoth. = The Last One Standing: The Tale of Boba Fett = The story of the most famous Star Wars bounty hunter, Boba Fett, is told by Daniel Keys Moran. A prologue set 15 years before The Empire Strikes Back explores Fett's history with Han Solo. Then, just before the events of Empire, Fett tracks Solo to the Rebel base on Hoth to obtain the bounty from Jabba the Hutt, encountering his previous employer, Darth Vader. On Tatooine, Jabba sends the enslaved Princess Leia to Fett's quarters, where they converse platonically. The majority of the story takes place 15 years after Return of the Jedi, when Fett fell into the sarlacc; his escape was dealt with in another short story by the author subtitled The Tale of Boba Fett. Finally, the older Fett takes one last bounty hunting job to pay for his retirement, and encounters his former nemesis Han Solo. The story ends in a cliffhanger of Fett and Solo in a standoff, with rifles pointed at each other. A backstory is given for Fett as lawman Jaster Mereel, though this was superseded by the plot of Attack of the Clones (2002). The comic Jango Fett: Open Seasons retconned Mereel as the mentor of Boba's father, and only a name used by Boba as an alias. The author stated in mid-2018 that Disney and Lucasfilm had considered adapting his story into a standalone movie, but did not know how the project was faring after the poor financial performance of Solo: A Star Wars Story. In late 2018, it was rumored to have been cancelled, and to have featured the entire lineup of bounty hunters.

Lead shielding refers to the use of lead as a form of radiation protection to shield people or objects from radiation so as to reduce the effective dose. Lead can effectively attenuate certain kinds of radiation because of its high density and high atomic number; principally, it is effective at stopping gamma rays and x-rays. Operation Fluoroscopy room with control space, separated by lead glass. Lead's high density is caused by the combination of its high atomic mass and the relatively small size of its bond lengths and atomic radius. The high atomic mass means that more electrons are needed to maintain a neutral charge and the small bond length and a small atomic radius means that many atoms can be packed into a particular lead structure. Because of lead's density and large number of electrons, it is well suited to scattering x-rays and gamma- rays. These rays form photons, a type of boson, which impart energy onto electrons when they come into contact. Without a lead shield, the electrons within a person's body would be affected, which could damage their DNA. When the radiation attempts to pass through lead, its electrons absorb and scatter the energy. Eventually though, the lead will degrade from the energy to which it is exposed. However, lead is not effective against all types of radiation. High energy electrons (including beta radiation) incident on lead may create bremsstrahlung radiation, which is potentially more dangerous to tissue than the original radiation. Furthermore, lead is not a particularly effective absorber of neutron radiation. Types Lead is used for shielding in x-ray machines, nuclear power plants, labs, medical facilities, military equipment, and other places where radiation may be encountered. There is great variety in the types of shielding available both to protect people and to shield equipment and experiments. In gamma-spectroscopy for example, lead castles are constructed to shield the probe form environmental radiation. Personal shielding includes lead aprons (such as the familiar garment used during dental x-rays), thyroid shields, and lead gloves. There are also a variety of shielding devices available for laboratory equipment, including lead castles, structures composed of lead bricks, and lead pigs, made of solid lead or lead- lined containers for storing and transporting radioactive samples. In many facilities where radiation is produced, regulations require construction with lead-lined plywood or drywall to protect adjoining rooms from scatter radiation. =Wear= A lead apron or leaded apron is a type of protective clothing that acts as a radiation shield. It is constructed of a thin rubber exterior and an interior of lead in the shape of a hospital apron. The purpose of the lead apron is to reduce exposure of a hospital patient to x-rays to vital organs that are potentially exposed to ionizing radiation during medical imaging that uses x-rays (radiography, fluoroscopy, computed tomography). Protection of the reproductive organs with a lead rubber apron is considered important because DNA changes to sperm or egg cells of the patient may pass on genetic defects to the offspring of the patient, causing serious and unnecessary hardship for child and parents. The thyroid gland is especially vulnerable to x-ray exposure. Care should be taken to place a lead apron over the thyroid gland before taking dental radiographs.A Patient's Guide to Medical Imaging By Ronald Eisenberg, JD, MD, FACR, Alexander Margulis, MDCurrent oral and maxillofacial imaging,Thomas F. Razmus, Gail F. Williamson, Page 107 Aprons used for dental imaging should include thyroid collars. However, in poorer or loosely regulated countries (eg African & South Asian countries), perhaps due to the relative \\"high cost\\" of such equipment (40 USD), no such lead protection is given to the patients themselves, though the operators do get out of the x-ray room for their own safety. The correct thickness of lead-equivalent (Pbeq) wear will depend on how long and how often the person is working in an exposed environment. The minimum requirement is to wear 0.25 mm Pbeq when not behind lead shielding. In a theatre using fluoroscopy (e.g. orthopaedics, cardiology or interventional) 0.35 or 0.5 mm lead may be appropriate because of the higher KV employed, and on proximity to the primary beam.Livingstone RS, Varghese A, Keshava SN.

It forms cubic crystals of the NaCl structure; it has a direct bandgap of 0.27 eV at room temperature. (Note that incorrectly identifies PbSe and other IV‚ÄìVI semiconductors as indirect gap materials.) It is a grey crystalline solid material. It is used for manufacture of infrared detectors for thermal imaging, operating at wavelengths between 1.5‚Äì5.2 Œºm. It does not require cooling, but performs better at lower temperatures. The peak sensitivity depends on temperature and varies between 3.7‚Äì4.7 Œºm. Single crystal nanorods and polycrystalline nanotubes of lead selenide have been synthesized via controlled organism membranes. The diameter of the nanorods were approx. 45 nm and their length was up to 1100 nm, for nanotubes the diameter was 50 nm and the length up to 2000 nm. Lead selenide nanocrystals embedded into various materials can be used as quantum dots, for example in nanocrystal solar cells. Lead selenide is a thermoelectric material. The material was identified as a potential high temperature thermoelectric with sodium or chlorine doping by Alekseva and co-workers at the A.F. Ioffe Institute in Russia. Subsequent theoretical work at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USA predicted that its p-type performance could equal or exceed that of the sister compound, lead telluride. Several groups have since reported thermoelectric figures of merit exceeding unity, which is the characteristic of a high performance thermoelectric. The mineral clausthalite is a naturally occurring lead selenide. It may be formed by direct reaction between its constituent elements (lead and selenium).  Infrared detection  PbSe is one of the first materials sensitive to the infrared radiation used for military applications. Early research works on the material as infrared detector were carried out during the 1930s and the first useful devices were processed by Germans, Americans and British during and just after World War II. Since then, PbSe has been commonly used as an infrared photodetector in multiple applications, from spectrometers for gas and flame detection to infrared fuzes for artillery ammunition or Passive Infrared Cueing systems (PICs). As a sensitive material to the infrared radiation, PbSe has unique and outstanding characteristics: it can detect IR radiation of wavelengths from 1.5 to 5.2 Œºm (mid-wave infrared window, abbreviated MWIR ‚Äì in some special conditions it is possible to extend its response beyond 6 Œºm), it has a high detectivity at room temperature (uncooled performance), and due to its quantum nature, it also presents a very fast response, which makes this material an excellent candidate as detector of low cost high speed infrared imagers. =Theory of operation= PbSe is a photoconductor material. Its detection mechanism is based on a change of conductivity of a polycrystalline thin-film of the active material when photons are incident. These photons are absorbed inside the PbSe micro-crystals causing then the promotion of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band. Even though it has been extensively studied, today the mechanisms responsible of its high detectivity at room temperature are not well understood. What is widely accepted is that the material and the polycrystalline nature of the active thin film play a key role in both the reduction of the Auger mechanism and the reduction of the dark current associated with the presence of multiple intergrain depletion regions and potential barriers inside the polycrystalline thin films.  Methods to manufacture PbSe infrared detectors  Two methods are commonly used nowadays to manufacture infrared detectors based on PbSe. =Chemical bath deposition (CBD)= CBD is the classic manufacturing method (also known as the \\"standard\\" method). It was developed in USA during the '60s and is based on the precipitation of the active material on a substrate rinsed in a controlled bath with selenourea, lead acetate, potassium iodine and other compounds. CBD method has been extensively used during last decades and is still used for processing PbSe infrared detectors. Because of technological limitations associated to this method of processing, nowadays the biggest CBD PbSe detector format commercialized is a linear array of 1x256 elements. =Vapour phase deposition (VPD)= This new processing method has been recently developed in Spain. It is based on the deposition of the active material by thermal evaporation, followed by specific thermal treatments. This method has an intrinsic advantage compared with the CBD method, which is the compatibility with preprocessed substrates, like silicon CMOS-technology wafers, and the possibility of processing complex detectors, such as the focal plane arrays for imagers. In fact, this has been the most important milestone in the last decades concerning the manufacturing of PbSe detectors, as it has opened the technology to the market of uncooled MWIR high-resolution imaging cameras with high frame rates and reduced costs. = PbSe Quantum dots based photodetectors = Also quantum dots based PbSe photodetectors are under development in the recent decade. In contrast to the polycrystalline material based detectors other solution processing techniques like spin-coating are applied.

Its provisions accomplished three goals: the establishment of a common policy for the two countries regarding France, the reduction of tariffs between the two countries, and, most centrally, the arrangement of a marriage contract between Arthur Tudor, eldest son of Henry VII of England, and Catherine of Aragon, daughter of Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon. The treaty was signed on March 27 by Spanish sovereigns, but its ratification by Henry did not occur until September 1490 by the Treaty of Woking. Clauses The treaty was made up of twenty-six clauses. The first sixteen dealt with military, economic, and political relations between England and Spain. The seventeenth clause consisted on the marriage between Catherine and Arthur, while the following ten clauses covered the financial settlement, succession, and Catherine's journey arrangements to England. Cause for treaty Henry VII Tudor had risen to the throne of England with his victory over Richard III Plantagenet at the Battle of Bosworth Field. Henry's claim to the throne of England lacked almost all validity by heredity; his possession of the crown was primarily by right of conquest, and he faced a host of claimants still alive with arguably better legal claims. By contrast, Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile were secure upon what was soon to be the united throne of Spain. They were looking for help against their hereditary enemy, France. Henry had a new son, the Spanish rulers a very young daughter; a marriage and alliance would help each. Henry would gain the acceptance of his position by a major foreign power, and the Spanish would obtain military help against France. Marriage offer By March 1487, an offer of marriage had been made by the Spanish monarchs to Henry. Negotiations speedily resulted in an agreement in principle. The terms were set down to paper on March 26, 1489. They included clauses requiring England and Spain to come to each other's aid should they declare war upon France. However, the exact terms were much more favorable to the Spanish; England was required to support Spain militarily so long as the Spanish were still at war, unless the English had recovered the province of Guyenne. By comparison, the Spanish were able to retire from military support if they recovered from France the much smaller districts of Roussillon and Cerdanya. The treaty established that Arthur and Catherine were to marry, and also established a dowry for Catherine of 200,000 crowns. Finally, by the provisions of the treaty, certain tariffs were to be dropped between the countries, allowing a more free trade to develop, though it did cost Castilian merchants certain privileges of theirs. The Spanish rulers signed the treaty the next day. Treaty ratification Henry, however, did not ratify the treaty right away. Henry's foreign policy during 1489 and 1490 attempted to obtain substantial support from either the Spanish monarchs or Maximilian I Habsburg, the Holy Roman Emperor, before he would commit to war against France. By September 1490 however, he was in a position to attempt a three-way alliance with Spain and the Habsburgs, and ratified the Treaty of Medina del Campo September 23. At the same time, an additional treaty was offered, modifying the terms of the Treaty of Medina del Campo, upon which Henry's assent was conditioned. This treaty was eventually rejected by the Spanish rulers; in the end, the terms of the Treaty of Medina del Campo went largely unexecuted. Eventually, the terms regarding the marriage were renegotiated in 1492, and again in 1497. The two royal children were finally married November 1501; Arthur died five months later.

It runs in two major sections: between East End and Fifth Avenues on the Upper East Side, and between Central Park West and Riverside Drive on the Upper West Side. The western segment feeds into the 86th Street transverse across Central Park, which connects to East 84th and 85th Streets on the eastern side.

The early settlement originally clustered around the 86th Street stop of the New York and Harlem Railroad. Since the late 1980s, nearly all distinctly German shops have disappeared, apart from a few restaurants on Second Avenue. The street was commonly considered a boundary for public utilities. For example, different telephone exchanges at East 79th and 97th Streets served the north and south sides of the street. Local number portability in the early 21st century allowed transferring phone numbers to either side. A sunken street through Central Park, the 86th Street transverse, connects West 86th Street with eastbound East 84th Street and westbound East 85th Street. Miners Gate provides pedestrian access to the park at East 86th, and Mariners Gate at West 85th. Transportation The M86 Select Bus Service bus serves the street. Until the 1950s, the Second Avenue and Third Avenue elevated lines served 86th Street on the East Side. The New York and Harlem Railroad used to operate an 86th Street rail line which ran on the surface from Central Park West, through Central Park and on to York Avenue. The line then turned north and terminated at the Astoria Ferry landing at 92nd Street. It is currently served by the following New York City Subway stations: * 86th Street at Broadway serving the * 86th Street at Central Park West serving the * 86th Street at Lexington Avenue serving the http://web.mta.info/nyct/maps/subwaymap.pdf * 86th Street at Second Avenue serving the The New York Central Railroad's 86th Street station previously existed on Park Avenue, which now carries the Park Avenue main line of the Metro-North Railroad.

The first character to bear the name, Keith Remsen, was created by writer Archie Goodwin, and first appeared in Nightmask #1 (November 1986), a series which was published under Marvel's New Universe imprint. Subsequent characters bearing the name were introduced in the 2006 series newuniversal, and as part of Marvel's 2012 rebranding, Marvel NOW! Publication history The original Nightmask, Keith Remsen, was created by Archie GoodwinNightmask #1 erroneously credits Tony Salmons as co-creator. Later publications, such as The Draft and The War, list Goodwin as Nightmask's sole creator. and first appeared in Nightmask #1 (Nov 1986), a series which was published under Marvel's New Universe imprint. Remsen is a paranormal, one of the people affected by the \\"White Event\\", and has the ability to manifest himself in other people's dreams. Issue #1 was penciled by Tony Salmons, as lobbied for by editor Eliot R. Brown, who later explained, \\"I thought Tony was the quentisential dreamscape person because he is the last, best, natural delineator of a Ditko-esque world, aside from Steve himself.\\" Goodwin was the initial writer on the series, but left after issue #4. As a consequence, the 'Gnome' storyline was abandoned and subsequently ignored until long after the series' cancelation, finally being resolved in Untold Tales of the New Universe: Nightmask (published in 2006). Like most of the New Universe lineup of 1986-87, Nightmask was unable to secure a stable creative team; one out of every three issues was a fill-in. The series was cancelled after 12 issues, although Remsen continued to feature as a significant New Universe character, with a supporting role (and occasional back-up stories) in other titles. In 2006, Warren Ellis and Salvador Larroca introduced a different version of the Nightmask character when they revived the New Universe concepts in a new series, newuniversal. Izanami Randall, who first appears in newuniversal #1 (Feb 2007), is a young Japanese-American woman living in San Francisco. After the White Event, Izanami discovers that she has been appointed as the Nightmask and has gained the power to manipulate the \\"superflow\\", a \\"transuniversal space\\" through which dreams, ideas and telepathy interact with the physical world. Fictional character biography =Keith Remsen= Keith Remsen is an eighteen-year-old whose parents send him to study with Doctor Horst Kleinmann, an expert on dreams. Kleinmann has perfected a way of entering dreams cybernetically, and is worried that Remsen's parents are trying to steal his research. Kleinmann plants a bomb which kills Remsen's parents, paralyzes his little sister Theodora (\\"Teddy\\"), and leaves Keith himself in a coma, where he remains until he is awakened by the White Event and his sister calling to him.Nightmask #1 (November 1986) After awaking, he gradually discovers that he has the power to enter people's dreams telepathically, which he uses to assist in psychotherapy. His sister Teddy is able to communicate with him while he is in the dream state and serves as his anchor to reality. He also fights Kleinmann in the dreamscape. After the Black Event, in which the city of Pittsburgh is destroyed, Teddy is left in a coma, and Remsen becomes one of the first paranormally gifted people drafted into the military. His training and abilities earn him a commission and he is assigned to use his abilities to scan paranormal draftees for signs of mental aberration. Without his sister to act as his anchor, his dream self becomes more and more unhinged until he feels he can no longer tell the sane from the insane. This leads him to approve Harlan Mook, a candidate with a dangerously unstable personality. Mook has a mental breakdown and attempts to assassinate the President of the United States (thwarted only because the unnamed President has developed paranormal regenerative abilities himself).The Draft (November 1988) Remsen enters Teddy's dreams in order to release her from her coma. Though initially his Nightmask persona torments Teddy in the same way it had all the dreamers he treated since the Black Event, Keith's love for his sister overcomes the Nightmask persona, freeing Teddy from her coma and restoring the stability of his powers.The Star Brand #17.

Izanami is pulled from the world into a transdimensional space called the superflow by an alien communication station just after receiving the glyph. The station informs her that she is one of the heralds of the paradigm shift which is in progress, sparked by the White Event; specifically, she is this age's Nightmask. It is the purpose of the Nightmask to help smooth the transition period of the paradigm shift due to the inevitable initial chaotic effects. * Trull is the first Nightmask of the newuniversal imprint, and is introduced in the newuniversal: conqueror one-shot, set in the year 2,689 BCE (some years after the first failed White Event). Trull helped to found Latvian city of Zardath ruled by Starr the Slayer, bearer of the Starbrand. It is revealed that Trull, who might have once been good, is a wholly evil man who plots Starr‚Äôs death and desires to become king. Trull hunts down other superhumans and drains them of their minds and powers, a process that causes them to be monstrously mutated.

Before that, it was inhabited by a variety of Indian tribes. The Pilgrim Fathers who sailed on the Mayflower established the first permanent settlement in 1620 at Plymouth Colony which set precedents but never grew large. A large-scale Puritan migration began in 1630 with the establishment of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and that spawned the settlement of other New England colonies. As the Colony grew, businessmen established wide-ranging trade, sending ships to the West Indies and Europe. Britain began to increase taxes on the New England colonies, and tensions grew with implementation of the Navigation Acts. These political and trade issues led to the revocation of the Massachusetts charter in 1684. The king established the Dominion of New England in 1686 to govern all of New England, and to centralize royal control and weaken local government. Sir Edmund Andros's intensely unpopular rule came to a sudden end in 1689 with an uprising sparked by the Glorious Revolution in England. The new king William III established the Province of Massachusetts Bay in 1691 to govern a territory roughly equivalent to the modern states of Massachusetts and Maine. Its governors were appointed by the crown, unlike the predecessor colonies that had elected their own governors. This increased friction between the colonists and the crown, which reached its height in the days leading up to the American Revolution in the 1760s and 1770s over the question of who could levy taxes. The American Revolutionary War began in Massachusetts in 1775 when London tried to shut down American self-government. The commonwealth formally adopted the state constitution in 1780, electing John Hancock as its first governor. In the 19th century, New England became America's center of manufacturing with the development of precision manufacturing and weaponry in Springfield and Hartford, Connecticut, and large-scale textile mill complexes in Worcester, Haverhill, Lowell, and other communities throughout New England using their rivers for power. New England also was an intellectual center and center of abolitionism. The Springfield Armory made most of the weaponry for the Union in the American Civil War. After the war, immigrants from Europe flooded into Massachusetts, continuing to expand its industrial base until the 1950s when textiles and other industries started to fade away, leaving a \\"rust belt\\" of empty mills and factories. Labor unions were important after the 1860s, as was big-city politics. The state's strength as a center of education contributed to the development of an economy based on information technology and biotechnology in the later years of the 20th century, leading to the \\"Massachusetts Miracle\\" of the late 1980s. Before European settlement Map of southern New England indicating approximate ranges of Indian tribes c. 1600 Massachusetts was originally inhabited by tribes of the Algonquian language family such as the Wampanoag, Narragansetts, Nipmucs, Pocomtucs, Mahicans, and Massachusetts.Brown and Tager, pp. 6‚Äì7. The Vermont and New Hampshire borders and the Merrimack River valley was the traditional home of the Pennacook tribe. Cape Cod, Nantucket, Martha's Vineyard, and southeast Massachusetts were the home of the Wampanoags who established a close bond with the Pilgrim Fathers. The extreme end of the Cape was inhabited by the closely related Nauset tribe. Much of the central portion and the Connecticut River valley was home to the loosely organized Nipmucs. The Berkshires were the home of both the Pocomtuc and the Mahican tribes. Narragansetts from Rhode Island and Mahicans from Connecticut Colony were also present. These tribes were generally dependent on hunting and fishing for most of their food supply. Villages consisted of lodges called wigwams as well as long houses, and tribes were led by male or female elders known as sachems.Brown and Tager, p. 7. Europeans began exploring the coast in the 16th century, but they made few attempts at permanent settlement anywhere. Early European explorers of the New England coast included Bartholomew Gosnold who named Cape Cod in 1602, Samuel de Champlain who charted the northern coast as far as Cape Cod in 1605 and 1606, John Smith, and Henry Hudson. Fishing ships from Europe also worked in the rich waters off the coast, and may have traded with some of the tribes. Large numbers of Indians were decimated by virgin soil epidemics, perhaps including smallpox, measles, influenza, or leptospirosis.; Marr, JS and Cathey, JT, \\"New hypothesis for cause of an epidemic among Native Americans, New England, 1616‚Äì1619,\\" Emerging Infectious Diseases, 2010 Feb. In 1617‚Äì1619, a disease killed 90 percent of the Indians in the region.Koplow, p. 13. Pilgrims and Puritans: 1620‚Äì1629 Mayflower in Plymouth Harbor by William Halsall (1882) The first settlers in Massachusetts were the Pilgrims who established Plymouth Colony in 1620 and developed friendly relations with the Wampanoag people.Goldfield, et al., pp. 29‚Äì30. This was the second permanent English colony in America following Jamestown Colony. The Pilgrims had migrated from England to Holland to escape religious persecution for rejecting England's official church. They were allowed religious liberty in Holland, but they gradually became concerned that the next generation would lose their distinct English heritage. They approached the Virginia Company and asked to settle \\"as a distinct body of themselves\\" in America. In the fall of 1620, they sailed to America on the Mayflower, first landing near Provincetown at the tip of Cape Cod. The area did not lie within their charter, so the Pilgrims created the Mayflower Compact before landing, one of America's first documents of self-governance. The first year was extremely difficult, with inadequate supplies and very harsh weather, but Wampanoag sachemMassasoit and his people assisted them. The First Thanksgiving 1621 In 1621, the Pilgrims celebrated their first Thanksgiving Day together to thank God for the blessings of good harvest and survival. This Thanksgiving came to represent the peace that existed at that time between the Wampanoags and the Pilgrims, although only about half of the Mayflower company survived the first year. The colony grew slowly over the next ten years, and was estimated to have 300 inhabitants by 1630.Nathaniel Philbrick, Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community, and War (2007) A group of fur-trappers and traders established Wessagusset Colony near the Plymouth colony in Weymouth in 1622. They abandoned it in 1623, and it was replaced by another small colony led by Robert Gorges. This settlement also failed, and individuals from these colonies returned to England, joined the Plymouth colonists, or established individual outposts elsewhere on the shores of Massachusetts Bay. In 1624, the Dorchester Company established a settlement on Cape Ann. This colony only survived until 1626, although a few settlers remained. Massachusetts Bay Colony: 1628‚Äì1686 Major boundaries of Massachusetts Bay and neighboring colonial claims in the 17th century and 18th century; modern state boundaries are partially overlaid for context The Pilgrims were followed by Puritans who established the Massachusetts Bay Colony at Salem (1629) and Boston (1630).Goldfield, et al., p. 30. The Puritans strongly dissented from the theology and church polity of the Church of England, and they came to Massachusetts for religious freedom.Goldfield, et al., p. 29. The Bay Colony was founded under a royal charter, unlike Plymouth Colony. The Puritan migration was mainly from East Anglia and southwestern regions of England, with an estimated 20,000 immigrants between 1628 and 1642. Massachusetts Bay colony quickly eclipsed Plymouth in population and economy, the chief factors being the large influx of population, more suitable harbor facilities for trade, and the growth of a prosperous merchant class. Religious dissension and expansionism led to the founding of several new colonies shortly after Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay. Dissenters such as Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson were banished due to religious disagreements with Massachusetts Bay authorities. Williams established Providence Plantations in 1636. Over the next few years, another group, which included Hutchinson, established Newport and Portsmouth; these settlements eventually joined to form the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. Others left Massachusetts Bay in order to establish other settlements, including Connecticut Colony on the Connecticut River and New Haven Colony on the coast. In 1636, a group of settlers led by William Pynchon founded Springfield, Massachusetts (originally named Agawam), after scouting for the region's most advantageous location for trading and farming. Springfield is located just north of the first of Connecticut River's unnavigable waterfalls, and it also sits amid the fertile valley which contains New England's best agricultural land. The Indian tribes surrounding Springfield were friendly, which was not always the case for the fledgling Connecticut colonies.Brown and Tager, p. 29. Pynchon annexed Springfield to the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1640 rather than the much closer Connecticut Colony over tensions with Connecticut following the Pequot War. Massachusetts Bay Colony's southern and western borders were thus established in 1640.http://www.americancenturies.mass.edu/people_places/view.jsp?itemtype=2&id;=245 King Philip's War (1675‚Äì76) was the bloodiest Indian war of the colonial period. In little over a year, Indians attacked nearly half of the region's towns, and they burned to the ground the major settlements at Providence and Springfield. New England's economy was all but ruined, and much of its population was killed.Philip Gould. \\"Reinventing Benjamin Church: Virtue, Citizenship and the History of King Philip's War in Early National America.\\" Journal of the Early Republic, No. 16, Winter 1996. p. 656. According to a combined estimate of loss of life in Schultz and Tougias' King Philip's War, The History and Legacy of America's Forgotten Conflict (based on sources from the Department of Defense, the Bureau of Census, and the work of Colonial historian Francis Jennings), 800 out of 52,000 English colonists (1.5%) and 3,000 out of 20,000 Native Americans (15%) lost their lives due to the war. Proportionately, it was one of the bloodiest and costliest wars in the history of North America. The Massachusetts Bay government established a mint to produce the Massachusetts pound beginning in 1652. In 1645, the General Court ordered rural towns to increase sheep production. Sheep provided meat and especially wool for the local cloth industry, avoiding the expense of imports of British cloth.Susan M. Ouellette, \\"Divine providence and collective endeavor: Sheep production in early Massachusetts.\\" New England Quarterly (1996): 355-380 in JSTOR. Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660 and began to scrutinize the governmental oversight in the colonies, and Parliament passed the Navigation Acts to regulate trade for England's benefit. Massachusetts and Rhode Island had thriving merchant fleets, and they often ran afoul of the trade regulations. King Charles formally vacated the Massachusetts charter in 1684. Friction erupted with the Indians in King Philip's War in the 1670s. Puritanism was the established religion in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and dissenters were banished, leading to the establishment of the Rhode Island Colony. Dominion of New England: 1686‚Äì1692 In 1660, King Charles II was restored to the throne. Colonial matters brought to his attention led him to propose the amalgamation of all of the New England colonies into a single administrative unit. In 1685, he was succeeded by James II, an outspoken Catholic who implemented the proposal. In June 1684, the charter of the Massachusetts Bay Colony was annulled, but its government continued to rule until James appointed Joseph Dudley to the new post of President of New England in 1686. Dudley established his authority later in New Hampshire and the King's Province (part of current Rhode Island), maintaining this position until Sir Edmund Andros arrived to become the Royal Governor of the Dominion of New England. The rule of Andros was unpopular. He ruled without a representative assembly, vacated land titles, restricted town meetings, enforced the Navigation Acts, and promoted the Church of England, angering virtually every segment of Massachusetts colonial society. Andros dealt a major blow to the colonists by challenging their title to the land; unlike England the great majority of New Englanders were land-owners. Taylor says that because they \\"regarded secure real estate as fundamental to their liberty, status, and prosperity, the colonists felt horrified by the sweeping and expensive challenge to their land titles.\\"Alan Taylor, American Colonies: the Settling of North America (2001) p 277 After James II was overthrown by William III and Mary II in late 1688, Boston colonists overthrew Andros and his officials in 1689. Both Massachusetts and Plymouth returned to their previous governments until 1692. During King William's War (1689‚Äì1697), the colony launched an unsuccessful expedition against Quebec under Sir William Phips in 1690, which had been financed by issuing paper bonds set against the gains expected from taking the city.Ren√© Chartrand, French Fortresses in North America 1535‚Äì1763: Quebec, Montreal, Louisbourg and New Orleans (Fortress 27); Osprey Publishing, March 20, 2005. The colony continued to be on the front lines of the war, and experienced widespread French and Indian raids on its northern and western frontiers. Royal Province of Massachusetts Bay: 1692‚Äì1774 In 1691, William and Mary chartered the Province of Massachusetts Bay, combining the territories of Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth, Maine, Nova Scotia (which then included New Brunswick), and the islands south of Cape Cod. For its first governor they chose Sir William Phips. Phips came to Boston in 1692 to begin his rule, and was immediately thrust into the witchcraft hysteria in Salem. He established the court that heard the notorious Salem witch trials, and oversaw the war effort until he was recalled in 1694. =Economy= Concerning Evil Spirits (Boston, 1693) by Increase Mather The province was the largest and most economically important in New England, and one where many American institutions and traditions were formed. Unlike southern colonies, it was built around small towns rather than scattered farms. The westernmost portion of Massachusetts, the Berkshires, was settled during the three decades following the end of the French and Indian War, largely by Scots. Sir Francis Bernard, the Royal Governor, named this new area \\"Berkshire\\" after his home county in England. The largest settlement in Berkshire County was Pittsfield, Massachusetts, founded in 1761. The educational system, headed by Harvard College, was the best in the 13 colonies. Newspapers became a major communications system in the 18th century, with Boston taking a leading role in the British colonies.Charles E. Clark, \\"Boston and the Nurturing of Newspapers: Dimensions of the Cradle, 1690‚Äì1741.\\" New England Quarterly (1991) pp: 243-271 in JSTOR. Teenaged Benjamin Franklin (born on January 17, 1706, in Milk Street) worked on one of the earliest newspapers, The New-England Courant (owned by his brother) until he ran away to Philadelphia in 1723. Five Boston newspapers presented a full range of opinions during the coming of the American revolution. In Worcester, printer Isaiah Thomas made the Massachusetts Spy the influential voice of the western settlers.Annie Russell Marble, From'Prentice to Patron: The Life Story of Isaiah Thomas (1935). Farming was the largest economic activity. Most farming towns were largely self-sufficient, with families trading with each other for items they did not produce themselves; the surplus was sold to cities.Bettye Hobbs Pruitt, \\"Self-sufficiency and the agricultural economy of eighteenth- century Massachusetts.\\" William and Mary Quarterly (1984): 334-364 in JSTOR. and Fishing was important in coastal towns like Marblehead. Great quantities of cod were exported to the slave colonies in the West Indies.James G. Lydon, \\"North Shore Trade in the Early Eighteenth Century,\\" American Neptune (1968) 28#4 pp 261-274 Merchant trade was based in Salem and Boston, and numerous wealthy merchants traded internationally. They typically stationed their sons and nephews as agents in ports around the empire.Bernard Bailyn, The New England merchants in the seventeenth century (1955). Their business grew dramatically after 1783 when they no longer were confined to the British Empire.Samuel Eliot Morison, The Maritime History Of Massachusetts, 1783-1860 (1924) Shipbuilding was a fast-growing industry. Most other manufactured products were imported from Britain (or smuggled in from the Netherlands). Banking In 1690, the Massachusetts Bay Colony became the first to issue paper money in what would become the United States, but soon others began printing their own money as well. The demand for currency in the colonies was due to the scarcity of coins, which had been the primary means of trade. Colonies' paper currencies were used to pay for their expenses and lend money to the colonies' citizens. Paper money quickly became the primary means of exchange within each colony, and it even began to be used in financial transactions with other colonies. However, some of the currencies were not redeemable in gold or silver, which caused them to depreciate. With the Currency Act of 1751, the British parliament limited the ability of the New England colonies to issue fiat paper currency. Under the 1751 act, the New England colonial governments could make paper money legal tender for the payment of public debts (such as taxes), and could issue bills of credit as a tool of government finance, but barred the use of paper money as legal tender for private debts.Larry Allen, \\"Currency Act of 1751 (England)\\" and \\"Currency Act of 1764 (England)\\" in The Encyclopedia of Money, pp. 96-98. Under continued pressure from the British merchant-creditors who disliked being paid in depreciated paper currency, the subsequent Currency Act of 1764 banned the issuance of bills of credit (paper money) throughout the colonies.The Currency Act of 1764. Colonial governments used workarounds to accept paper notes as payment for taxes and pressured Parliament to repeal the prohibition on paper money as legal tender for public debts, which Parliament ultimately did in 1773. The colony was always short of gold and silver and printed a great deal of paper money, which caused inflation that favored farmers but angered business interests. By 1750, however, the colony recalled its paper currency and transitioned to a specie currency based on the British reimbursement (in gold and silver) for its spending in the French and Indian wars. The large- scale merchants and Royal officials welcomed the transition but many farmers and smaller businessmen were opposed.Herman Belz, \\"Currency Reform in Colonial Massachusetts, 1749-1750,\\" Essex Institute Historical Collections (1967) 103#1 pp 66-84 =Wars with France= The colony fought alongside British regulars in a series of French and Indian Wars characterized by brutal border raids and attacks by Indians organized and supplied by New France. Particularly in King William's War (1689‚Äì97) and Queen Anne's War (1702‚Äì13), the colony's rural communities were directly exposed to French and Indian attacks, with Deerfield raided in 1704 and Haverhill raided in 1708. Boston responded, launching naval expeditions against Acadia and Quebec in both wars. During Queen Anne's War, Massachusetts men were involved in the Conquest of Acadia (1710), which became the Province of Nova Scotia. The province was also involved in Dummer's War, which drove Indian tribes from northern New England. In 1745, during King George's War, Massachusetts provincial forces successfully besieged Fortress Louisbourg. The fortress was returned to France at the end of the war, angering many colonists who viewed it as a threat to their security. During the French and Indian War, Governor William Shirley was instrumental in the Expulsion of the Acadians from Nova Scotia and trying to settle them in New England. After the expulsion, Shirley also was involved in transporting New England Planters to settle Nova Scotia on the former Acadian farms.John Bartlet Brebner. New England's outpost : Acadia before the conquest of Canada. New York ; Columbia University Press ; London : P.S. King & Son, 1927. pp. 203‚Äì233 Many troops from Massachusetts participated in the successful Siege of Havana in 1762. Britain's victory in the war led to its acquisition of New France, removing the immediate northern threat to Massachusetts that the French had posed. =Disasters= Boston was hit by a major smallpox epidemic in 1721. Some colonial leaders called for use of the new technique of inoculation, whereby a patient would get a weak form of the disease and become permanently immune. Puritan minister Cotton Mather and physician Zabdiel Boylston led the drive for inoculation, while physician William Douglass and newspaper editor James Franklin led the opposition.Amalie M. Kass, \\"Boston's Historic Smallpox Epidemic.\\" Massachusetts Historical Review 14 (2012): 1-51 in JSTOR In 1755, about 4:15 am on Tuesday, November 18, was the most destructive earthquake yet known in New England. The first pulsations of the ground were followed for about a minute of tremulous motion. Next came a quick vibration and several jerks much worse than the first. Houses rocked and cracked; furniture fell over. Dr. Edward A. Holyoke, of Salem, wrote in his diary that he \\"thought of nothing less than being buried instantly in the ruins of the house.\\" The shaking continued for two to three minutes more, and seemed to move from northwest to southeast. The ocean along the coast was affected; ships shook so much that sleeping sailors awoke, thinking they had run aground. In Boston, the earthquake threw dishes on the floor, stopped clocks, and bent vane-rods on churches and Faneuil Hall. Stone walls collapsed. New springs appeared, and old springs dried up. Subterranean streams changed their courses, emptying many wells. The worst damage was to chimneys. In Boston alone, about a hundred were leveled; about fifteen hundred were damaged, the streets in some places almost covered with fallen bricks. Falling chimneys broke some roofs. Many wooden buildings in Boston were thrown down, and some brick buildings suffered; the gable ends of twelve or fifteen were knocked down to the eaves. Despite the danger and many narrow escapes, no one was killed or seriously injured. Aftershocks continued for four days.E. Ebel, \\"The Cape Ann, Massachusetts earthquake of 1755: A 250th anniversary perspective.\\" Seismological Research Letters 77.1 (2006): 74-86. =Politics= The relationship between the provincial government and the crown-appointed governor was often difficult and contentious. The governors sought to assert the royal prerogatives granted in the provincial charter, and the provincial government sought to strip or minimize the governor's power. For example, each governor was ordered to enact legislation for providing permanent salaries for crown officials, but the legislature refused to do so, using its ability to grant stipends annually as a means of control over the governor. The province's periodic issuance of paper currency was also a persistent source of friction between factions in the province, due to its inflationary effects. Notable royal governors during this period were Joseph Dudley, Thomas Hutchinson, Jonathan Belcher, Francis Bernard, and General Thomas Gage. Gage was the last British governor of Massachusetts, and his effective rule extended to little more than Boston. Revolutionary Massachusetts: 1760s‚Äì1780s Percy's Rescue at Lexington by Ralph Earl and Amos Doolittle from 1775, an illustration of the Battles of Lexington and Concord. Massachusetts was a center of the movement for independence from Great Britain, earning it the nickname, the \\"Cradle of Liberty\\". Colonists here had long had uneasy relations with the British monarchy, including open rebellion under the Dominion of New England in the 1680s.Goldfield, et al., p. 66. The Boston Tea Party is an example of the protest spirit in the early 1770s, while the Boston Massacre escalated the conflict.Goldfield, et al., pp. 86‚Äì88. Anti-British activity by men like Sam Adams and John Hancock, followed by reprisals by the British government, were a primary reason for the unity of the Thirteen Colonies and the outbreak of the American Revolution.Goldfield, et al., pp. 88‚Äì90. The Battles of Lexington and Concord initiated the American Revolutionary War and were fought in the Massachusetts towns of Lexington and Concord.Goldfield, et al., pp. 95‚Äì96. Future President George Washington took over what would become the Continental Army after the battle. His first victory was the Siege of Boston in the winter of 1775‚Äì76, after which the British were forced to evacuate the city.Goldfield, et al., pp. 96‚Äì97. The event is still celebrated in Suffolk County as Evacuation Day. In 1777, George Washington and Henry Knox founded the Arsenal at Springfield, which catalyzed many innovations in Massachusetts' Connecticut River Valley. =Boston Massacre= Boston Massacre Boston was the center of revolutionary activity in the decade before 1775, with Massachusetts natives Samuel Adams, John Adams, and John Hancock as leaders who would become important in the revolution. Boston had been under military occupation since 1768. When customs officials were attacked by mobs, two regiments of British regulars arrived. They had been housed in the city with increasing public outrage. In Boston on March 5, 1770, what began as a rock-throwing incident against a few British soldiers ended in the shooting of five men by British soldiers in what became known as the Boston Massacre. The incident caused further anger against British authority in the commonwealth over taxes and the presence of the British soldiers. =Boston Tea Party= Boston Tea Party One of the many taxes protested by the colonists was a tax on tea, imposed when Parliament passed the Townshend Acts, and retained when most of the provisions of those acts were repealed. With the passage of the Tea Act in 1773, tea sold by the British East India Company would become less expensive than smuggled tea, and there would be reduced profit-making opportunities for Massachusetts merchants traded in tea. This led to protests against the delivery of the company's tea to Boston. On December 16, 1773, when a tea ship of the East India Company was planning to land taxed tea in Boston, a group of local men known as the Sons of Liberty sneaked onto the boat the night before it was to be unloaded and dumped all the tea into the harbor, an act known as the Boston Tea Party. Certificate of government of Massachusetts Bay acknowledging loan of ¬£20 to state treasury by Seth Davenport. September 1777 =American Revolution= The Boston Tea Party prompted the British government to pass the Intolerable Acts in 1774 that brought stiff punishment on Massachusetts. They closed the port of Boston, the economic lifeblood of the Commonwealth, and reduced self- government. Local self-government was ended and the colony put under military rule. The Patriots formed the Massachusetts Provincial Congress after the provincial legislature was disbanded by Governor Gage. The suffering of Boston and the tyranny of its rule caused great sympathy and stirred resentment throughout the Thirteen Colonies. On February 9, 1775, the British Parliament declared Massachusetts to be in rebellion, and sent additional troops to restore order to the colony. With the local population largely opposing British authority, troops moved from Boston on April 18, 1775, to destroy the military supplies of local resisters in Concord. Paul Revere made his famous ride to warn the locals in response to this march. On the 19th, in the Battles of Lexington and Concord, where the famous \\"shot heard 'round the world\\" was fired, British troops, after running over the Lexington militia, were forced back into the city by local resistors. The city was quickly brought under siege. Fighting broke out again in June when the British took the Charlestown Peninsula in the Battle of Bunker Hill after the colonial militia fortified Breed's Hill. The British won the battle, but at a very large cost, and were unable to break the siege. The British made a desperate attempt by using biological weapons against the Americans by sending infected civilians with smallpox behind American lines but this was soon contained by Continental General George Washington who launched a vaccination program to ensure his troops and civilians were in good health after the damage biological warfare caused. Soon after the Battle of Bunker Hill, General George Washington took charge of the rebel army, and when he acquired heavy cannon in March 1776, the British were forced to leave, marking the first great colonial victory of the war. Ever since, \\"Evacuation Day\\" has been celebrated as a state holiday. Massachusetts was not invaded again but in 1779 the disastrous Penobscot Expedition took place in the District of Maine, then part of the Commonwealth. Trapped by the British fleet, the American sailors sank the ships of the Massachusetts state navy before it could be captured by the British. In May 1778, the section of Freetown that later became Fall River was raided by the British, and in September 1778, the communities of Martha's Vineyard and New Bedford were also subjected to a British raid. John Adams was a leader in the independence movement and he helped secure a unanimous vote for independence and on July 4, 1776, the United States Declaration of Independence was adopted in Philadelphia. It was signed first by Massachusetts resident John Hancock, president of the Continental Congress. Soon afterward the Declaration of Independence was read to the people of Boston from the balcony of the State House. Massachusetts was no longer a colony; it was a state and part of a new nation, the United States of America. Federalist Era: 1780‚Äì1815 First articles, the Declaration of the Rights of the Inhabitants of the Commonwealth, in the 1780 Massachusetts Constitution A Constitutional Convention drew up a state constitution, which was drafted primarily by John Adams, and ratified by the people on June 15, 1780. Adams, along with Samuel Adams and James Bowdoin, wrote in the Preamble to the Constitution of the Commonwealth: Bostonian John Adams, known as the \\"Atlas of Independence\\", was an important figure in both the struggle for independence as well as the formation of the new United States. Adams was highly involved in the push for separation from Britain and the writing of the Massachusetts Constitution in 1780 (which, in the Elizabeth Freeman and Quock Walker cases, effectively made Massachusetts the first state to have a constitution that declared universal rights and, as interpreted by Supreme Judicial Court Chief Justice William Cushing, abolished slavery). Adams became minister to Britain in the 1780s, Vice President in 1789 and succeeded Washington as President in 1797. His son, John Quincy Adams, would go on to become the sixth US President. John Adams =The new constitution= Massachusetts was the first state in the United States to abolish slavery. (Vermont, which became part of the U.S. in 1791, abolished adult slavery somewhat earlier than Massachusetts, in 1777.) The new constitution also dropped any religious tests for political office, though local tax money had to be paid to support local churches. People who belonged to non-Congregational churches paid their tax money to their own church, and the churchless paid to the Congregationalists. Baptist leader Isaac Backus vigorously fought these provisions, arguing people should have freedom of choice regarding financial support of religion. Adams drafted most of the document and despite numerous amendments it still follows his line of thought. He distrusted utopians and pure democracy, and put his faith in a system of checks and balances; he admired the principles of the unwritten British Constitution. He insisted on a bicameral legislature which would represent both the gentlemen and the common citizen. Above all he insisted on a government by laws, not men.George C. Homans, \\"John Adams and the Constitution of Massachusetts,\\" Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society (1981) 125#4 pp. 286‚Äì291 in JSTOR The constitution also changed the name of the Massachusetts Bay State to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Still in force, it is the oldest constitution in current use in the world. =Shays' Rebellion= The Springfield Armory (building pictured is from the 19th century) was the first major target of the rebellion. The economy of rural Massachusetts suffered an economic depression after the war ended. Merchants, pressured for hard currency by overseas partners, made similar demands on local debtors, and the state raised taxes in order to pay off its own war debts. Efforts to collect both public and private debts from cash-poor farmers led to protests that flared into direct action in August 1786. Rebels calling themselves Regulators (after the North Carolina Regulator movement of the 1760s) succeeded in shutting down courts meeting to hear debt and tax collection cases. By the end of 1786 a farmer in western Massachusetts named Daniel Shays emerged as one of the ringleaders, and government attempts to squelch the protests only served to radicalize the protestors. In January 1787 Shays and Luke Day organized an attempt to take the federal Springfield Armory; state militia holding the armory beat back the attempt with cannon fire. A private militia raised by wealthy Boston merchants and led by General Benjamin Lincoln broke the back of the rebellion in early February at Petersham, but small-scale resistance continued in the western parts of the state for a while.Robert A. Gross, \\"A Yankee Rebellion? The Regulators, New England, and the New Nation,\\" New England Quarterly (2009) 82#1 pp. 112-135 in JSTOR The state put down the rebellion‚Äîbut if it had been too weak to do so it would be no help to call on the ineffective federal government. The event led nationalists like George Washington to redouble efforts to strengthen the weak national government as necessary for survival in a dangerous world. Massachusetts, divided along class lines polarized by the rebellion, only narrowly ratified the United States Constitution in 1788.Robert A. Feer, \\" Shays's Rebellion and the Constitution: A Study in Causation,\\" New England Quarterly, (1969) 42#3 pp. 388-410 in JSTOR =Johnny Appleseed= Johnny Appleseed John Chapman often called Johnny \\"Appleseed\\" (born on September 26, 1774, in Leominster, Massachusetts) was an American folk hero and pioneer nurseryman who introduced apple trees and established orchards to many areas in the Midwestern region of the country including Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana. Today, Appleseed is the official folk hero of Massachusetts and his stature has served a focus in many children's books, movies, and folk tales since the end of the Civil War. Early industrial period: 1815‚Äì1860 In 1836, Mary Lyon opened Mount Holyoke College, the first women's college in America. Lyon, a very active Congregationalist, promoted the college as an exemplification of the ideas of revivalist Jonathan Edwards regarding self- restraint, self-denial, and disinterested benevolence.Joseph Conforti, \\"Mary Lyon, the Founding of Mount Holyoke College, and the Cultural Revival of Jonathan Edwards,\\" Religion and American Culture: A Journal of Interpretation (1993) 3#1 pp. 69-89 in JSTOR One of the first students was reclusive poet Emily Dickinson. During the 19th century, Massachusetts became a national leader in the American Industrial Revolution, with factories around Boston producing textiles and shoes, and factories around Springfield producing precision manufacturing tools and paper.Brown and Tager, p. 129, 211. The economy transformed from one based primarily on agriculture to an industrial one, initially making use of waterpower and later the steam engine to power factories, and canals and later railroads for transporting goods and materials.Brown and Tager, p. 202. At first, the new industries drew labor from Yankees on nearby subsistence farms, and later relied upon Catholic immigrants from Ireland and Canada.Brown and Tager, pp. 133‚Äì136, 179. =Industrial development= Textile mills such as the Boott Mills in Lowell made Massachusetts a leader in the US Industrial Revolution. Massachusetts became a leader in industrial innovation and development during the 19th century. Since colonial times, there had been a successful iron making industry in New England. The first successful ironworks in America was established at Saugus in 1646,Gordon, John Steele (2004). An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power, p. 35. HarperCollins. . utilizing bog iron from swamps to produce plows, nails, firearms, hoops for barrels and other items necessary for the development of the Colony. Other industries would be established during this period, such as shipbuilding, lumber, paper and furniture making. These small-scale shops and factories often utilized the State's many rivers and streams to power their machinery. While Samuel Slater had established the first successful textile mill at Pawtucket, Rhode Island, in 1793, there remained no way to efficiently mass-produce cloth from the spun yarn produced by the early mills. The yarn was still outsourced to small weaving shops where it was woven into cloth on hand looms. The first woolen mill, and the second textile mill in the Blackstone Valley, was a \\"wool carding mill\\", established in 1810 by Daniel Day, near the West River and Blackstone River at Uxbridge, Massachusetts. Then, in 1813, a group of wealthy Boston merchants led by Francis Cabot Lowell, known as the Boston Associates, established the first successful integrated textile mill in North America at Waltham.Rorabaugh, W. J.; Crichtlow, Donald T.; and Baker, Paula C. (2004). America's Promise: A Concise History of the United States, p. 154. Rowman & Littlefield. . Lowell had visited England in 1810 and studied the Lancashire textile industry. Because the British government prohibited the export of this new technology, Lowell memorized plans for the power looms on his return trip to Boston. With the skill of master mechanic Paul Moody, the first successful power looms were produced, harnessing the power of the Charles River. For the first time, all phases of textile production could now be performed under one roof, greatly increasing production, and profits. This was the real beginning of the Industrial Revolution in America. Boston painted by Hubert Sattler, c. 1850 With the early success of the Boston Manufacturing Company at Waltham, the Boston Associates would also later establish several other textile towns, including Lowell in 1823, Lawrence in 1845, Chicopee in 1848 and Holyoke in 1850. Lowell grew quickly to a city of 33,000 people by 1850. Its mills were highly integrated and centrally controlled. An ingenious canal system provided the water power that drove the machinery. Steam power would be introduced beginning in the 1850s. The mill owners initially employed local farm women, often recruited from poor, remote parts of New England, and attempted to create a Utopian industrial society by providing housing, churches, schools and parks for their workers, unlike their English counterparts. Eventually, as the mills grew larger and larger, the owners turned to newly arrived Irish immigrants to fill their factories. Industrial cities, especially Worcester and Springfield, became important centers in textile machinery (in Worcester's case) and precision tool production and innovation (in Springfield's case.) While Boston did not have many large factories, it became increasingly important as the business and transportation hub of all of New England, as well as a national leader in finance, law, medicine, education, arts and publishing. Railroads In 1826, the Granite Railway became the first commercial railroad in the nation. In 1830, the legislature chartered three new railroads‚Äîthe Boston and Lowell, the Boston and Providence, and most important of all, the Boston and Worcester. In 1833, it chartered the Western Railroad to connect Worcester with Albany and the Erie Canal. The system flourished and western grain began flowing to the port of Boston for export to Europe, thereby breaking New York City's virtual monopoly on trade from the Erie Canal system. Much of the construction work was done by Irish Catholic work gangs. They lived in temporary camps but many settled in the new industrial cities along the line, where the gang bosses became leaders in the Democratic Party.Edward J. O'Day, \\"Constructing The Western Railroad: The Irish Dimension,\\" Historical Journal of Massachusetts, April 1983, 11#1 pp 7‚Äì21 Some of their work is still used. For example, the stone Canton Viaduct at Canton, Massachusetts, built in 1835, is still used by Amtrak's high-speed Acela Express along the Boston‚ÄìWashington, Northeast Corridor. The viaduct required only minor changes to bring it up to late-20th-century standards.William D. Middleton, \\"They're Still There: High Speed Rail's 1835 Underpinning,\\" American Heritage of Invention and Technology, April 2001, 16#4 pp 52‚Äì55 Whaling Whaling Beginning in the late colonial period, Massachusetts leveraged its strong seafaring tradition, advanced shipbuilding industry, and access to the oceans to make the U.S. the pre-eminent whaling nation in the world by the 1830s.David Moment, \\"The Business of Whaling in America in the 1850s,\\" Business History Review, Fall 1957, 31#3 pp 261‚Äì291 Whale oil was in demand chiefly for lamps. By the 1750s whaling in Nantucket had become a highly lucrative deep-sea industry, with voyages extending for years at a time and with vessels traveling as far as South Pacific waters. The British Navy captured most of the whalers during the revolution, but at the same time many whalers refitted as privateers against the British. Whaling recovered after the war as New Bedford became the center. Whalers took greater economic risks to turn major profits: expanding their hunting grounds and securing foreign and domestic workforces for the Pacific. Investment decisions and financing arrangements were set up so that managers of whaling ventures shared their risks by selling some equity claims but retained a substantial portion due to moral hazard considerations. As a result, they had little incentive to consider the correlation between their own returns and those of others in planning their voyages. This stifled diversity in whaling voyages and increased industry-wide risk. After 1860, kerosene replaced whale oil‚Äîconcurrent with the devastation of the whaling fleet by Confederate commerce raiders‚Äîand the entrepreneurs shifted to manufacturing.Eric Hilt, \\"Investment and Diversification in the American Whaling Industry.\\" Journal of Economic History 2007 67(2): 292‚Äì314. =Political and social movements= On March 15, 1820, Maine was separated from Massachusetts and entered the Union as the 23rd State as a result of the enactment of the Missouri Compromise. Horace Mann made the state system of schools the national model. The Commonwealth made its mark in Washington with such political leaders as Daniel Webster and Charles Sumner. Building on the many activist Congregational churches, abolitionism flourished. William Lloyd Garrison was the outstanding spokesperson, though many \\"cotton Whig\\" mill owners complained that the agitation was bad for their strong business ties to southern cotton planters. The Congregationalists remained dominant in rural areas, but, in the cities, a new religious sensibility had replaced their straight-laced Calvinism. By 1826, reported Harriet Beecher Stowe: > All the literary men of Massachusetts were Unitarians. All the trustees and > professors of Harvard College were Unitarians. All the √©lite of wealth and > fashion crowded Unitarian churches. The judges on the bench were Unitarian, > giving decisions by which the peculiar features of church organization, so > carefully ordained by the Pilgrim fathers, had been nullified. Some of the most important writers and thinkers of this time came from Massachusetts. Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson are well known today for their contributions to American thought. Part of an intellectual movement known as Transcendentalism, they emphasized the importance of the natural world to humanity and were also part of the abolitionist call. =Know Nothing movement= The Know Nothing movement formed a new party in 1854 and captured almost all the seats in the legislature, the state government, and many cities. Historian John Mulkern finds the new party was populist and highly democratic, hostile to wealth, elites, and to expertise, and deeply suspicious of outsiders especially Catholics. The new party's voters were concentrated in the rapidly growing industrial towns, where Yankee workers faced direct competition with new Irish immigrants. Whereas the Whig party was strongest in high income districts, the Know Nothing electorate was strongest in the poor districts. They voted out the traditional upper-class closed political leadership class, especially the lawyers and merchants. In their stead they elected working class men, farmers, and a large number of teachers and ministers. Replacing the moneyed elite were men who seldom owned $10,000 in property. In national perspective, the most aggressive and innovative legislation came out of Massachusetts, Both in terms of nativism and in terms of reforms. Historian Stephen Taylor says that in addition to nativist legislation: > the party also distinguished itself by its opposition to slavery, support > for an expansion of the rights of women, regulation of industry, and support > of measures designed to improve the status of working people.Stephen Taylor, > \\"Progressive Nativism: The Know-Nothing Party in Massachusetts\\" Historical > Journal of Massachusetts (2000) 28#2 pp 167-84 It passed legislation to regulate railroads, insurance companies, and public utilities. It funded free textbooks for the public schools, and raised the appropriations for local libraries and for the school for the blind. Purification of Massachusetts against divisive social evils was a high priority. The legislature set up the state's first reform school for juvenile delinquents, while trying to block the importation of supposedly subversive government documents and academic books from Europe. It upgraded the legal status of wives, giving them more property rights and more rights in divorce courts. It passed harsh penalties on speakeasies, gambling houses and bordellos. Prohibition legislation imposed severe penalties: serving one glass of beer was punishable by six months in prison. Many juries refused to convict. Many of the reforms were quite expensive; State spending rose 45% on top of a 50% hike in annual taxes on cities and towns. The extravagance angered the taxpayers; few Know Nothings were reelected so the brief two-year experiment ended.Taylor, \\"Progressive Nativism: The Know-Nothing Party in Massachusetts\\" pp 171-72 The highest priority included attacks on the civil rights of Irish Catholic immigrants. State courts lost the power to process applications for citizenship; the public schools had to require compulsory daily reading of the Protestant Bible (which the nativists were sure would transform the Catholic children). The governor disbanded the Irish militias, and replaced Catholics holding state jobs with Protestants. It failed to reach the two-thirds vote needed to pass a state constitutional amendment to restrict voting and office holding to men who had resided in Massachusetts for at least 21 years. The legislature then called on Congress to raise the requirement for naturalization from five years to 21 years, but Congress never acted. The most dramatic move by the Know Nothing legislature was to appoint an investigating committee designed to prove widespread sexual immorality under way in Catholic convents. The press had a field day following the story, especially when it was discovered that the key reformer was using committee funds to pay for a prostitute. The legislature shut down its committee, ejected the reformer, and saw its investigation became a laughing stock.John R. Mulkern, \\"Scandal Behind the Convent Walls: The Know-Nothing Nunnery Committee of 1855.\\" Historical Journal of Massachusetts 11 (1983): 22-34.Mary J. Oates, \\"'Lowell': An Account of Convent Life in Lowell, Massachusetts, 1852-1890.\\" New England Quarterly (1988) pp: 101-118 in JSTOR reveals the actual behavior of the Catholic nuns.Robert Howard Lord, et al. History of the Archdiocese of Boston in the Various Stages of Development, 1604 to 1943 (1944) pp. 686-99 for more details Civil War and Gilded Age: 1860‚Äì1900 William Lloyd Garrison In the years leading up to the Civil War, Massachusetts was a center of social progressivism, Transcendentalism, and abolitionist activity. Horace Mann made the state system of schools the national model.Goldfield, et al., p. 251.Brown, Richard D. and Tager, Jack (2000). Massachusetts: A Concise History, p. 183. University of Massachusetts Press. . Two prominent abolitionists from the Commonwealth were William Lloyd Garrison and Wendell Phillips. Garrison founded the New England Anti-Slavery Society in 1832, and helped change perceptions on slavery. The movement increased antagonism over the issues of slavery, resulting in anti-abolitionist riots in Massachusetts between 1835 and 1837.Brown (2000), pp. 185‚Äì86. The works of abolitionists contributed to the eventual actions of the Commonwealth during the Civil War. Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson made major contributions to American thought.Goldfield, et al., p. 254. Members of the Transcendentalism movement, they emphasized the importance of the natural world and emotion to humanity. Although significant opposition to abolitionism existed early on in Massachusetts, resulting in anti-abolitionist riots between 1835 and 1837,Brown and Tager, p. 185. opposition to slavery gradually increased in the next few decades.Brown and Tager, p. 183.Brown and Tager, pp. 187‚Äì193. Famed abolitionist John Brown moved to the ideologically progressive town of Springfield in 1846. It was there that Brown first became a militant anti-slavery proponent. In Springfield and in Boston, Brown met the connections that would both influence him, (Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth in Springfield,) and later fund his efforts, (Simon Sanborn and Amos Adams Lawrence in Boston,) in Bleeding Kansas and John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry. In 1850, Brown founded his first militant, anti-slavery organization ‚Äì The League of the Gileadites ‚Äì in Springfield, to protect escaped slaves from 1850s Fugitive Slave Act. Massachusetts was a hotbed of abolitionism ‚Äì particularly the progressive cities of Boston and Springfield ‚Äì and contributed to subsequent actions of the state during the Civil War. Massachusetts was among the first states to respond to President Lincoln's call for troops. Massachusetts was the first state to recruit, train, and arm a Black regiment with White officers, the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry. The Robert Gould Shaw Memorial in Boston Common contains a relief depicting the 54th regiment. Much of the Union's weaponry for the Civil War was produced in Springfield, at the Springfield Armory. Following the Civil War, thousands of immigrants from Canada and Europe continued to settle in the major cities of Massachusetts, attracted by employment in the state's ever- expanding factories.Fuchs, Lawrence H. \\"Immigration through the Port of Boston\\". In Stolarik, M. Mark, ed. (1988). Forgotten Doors: The Other Ports of Entry to the United States, pp. 20‚Äì21. Balch Institute Press. . The state also became a leader in education and innovation through this period, particularly in the Boston area. =Invention of basketball and volleyball= In 1891, and 1895, the sports of basketball and volleyball‚Äîboth now Olympic sports, popular worldwide‚Äîwere invented in the Western Massachusetts cities of Springfield and Holyoke, respectively. Both inventors, James Naismith, and William G. Morgan sought to create games for groups at the YMCA, with Naismith seeking a fast- paced game for youths often confined indoors during New England's harsh winters. Morgan's invention of mintonette, soon renamed volleyball at the suggestion of colleague Professor Alfred T. Halsted, was a direct response to the then-new sport basketball, as he sought to create a fast-paced game with similar objectives that could be more easily played by a wider variety of players young and old, athletic and non-athletic. Today, Springfield is home to the international Basketball Hall of Fame. Holyoke is home to the international Volleyball Hall of Fame. =Industrial advance= Interurban street railway systems, or \\"trolleys\\", in Massachusetts, 1913 In the 1890s‚Äîlargely due to the presence of the Springfield Armory, which employed many skilled, mechanical workers‚ÄîGreater Springfield became the United States' first major center of automobile and motorcycle innovation. The United States' first gasoline-powered automobile company, the Duryea Motor Wagon Company, was founded in Chicopee in 1893. The first American motorcycle company, the Indian Motorcycle Company, was founded in Springfield in 1901. Knox Automobile produced the world's first motorized fire engines in Springfield in 1906. File:Street railway workers with a thermite crucible on Main Street, Holyoke, 1904.png Although the basic rail system was in place by 1860, the railways continued to make major improvements in tracks, signals, bridging, and facilities. With steel came heavier trains and more powerful locomotives. In the 1880s the Boston & Albany Railroad invested heavily in its physical facilities, including the construction of over 30 new passenger stations. Famed Boston architect H. H. Richardson did much of the design work.Jeffrey Karl Ochsner, \\"Architecture for the Boston and Albany Railroad: 1881‚Äì1894,\\" Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, June 1988, 47#2, pp 109‚Äì131 Passenger transportation was revolutionized by the electric trolley. Thomas Davenport, the first American to construct a DC electric motor, first demonstrated the feasibility of the electric railway in Springfield with a small circular railway in late 1835, which was subsequently exhibited in Boston that winter. Decades later in 1889, Springfield's first line was constructed and by 1905 the city had more track than New York City. The lines provided rapid, cheap transportation for farm produce and workers, created land booms in suburbia, and permitted Sunday outings in the country. They were highly profitable and the base of numerous fortunes.Scott R. Johnson, \\"The Trolley Car as a Social Factor: Springfield, Massachusetts,\\" History Journal of Western Massachusetts, 1972, 1#2 pp 5‚Äì17 The numerous trolley operators around the Commonwealth during this time would drive innovation in best practices, and while it would not be until the 1930s that American steam railroads would adopt thermite welding, it was on August 8, 1904 that the Holyoke Street Railway became the first rail line in the United States to lay track with the process. One of its engineers at the time, a recent graduate from Worcester Polytechnic named George Pellissier, introduced the process developed by German chemist Hans Goldschmidt to the railway company soon after the inventor's Goldschmidt Thermit Company opened its first American office in New York City. During his tenure with both the railway and Goldscmidt's company, Pellissier would contribute to thermite manufacturing plant design, as well as improvements toward continuously welded rail. While other track- laying techniques exist the process is now considered a standard operating procedure by railmen across the world. Prosperity decades: 1900‚Äì29 Massachusetts entered the 20th century with a strong industrial economy. Despite a lack of agricultural progress, the economy prospered between 1900 and 1919. Factories throughout the Commonwealth produced goods varying from paper to metals. Boston, in the year 1900, was still the second most important port in the United States, as well as the most valuable U.S. port in terms of its fish market. By 1908, however, the value of the port dropped considerably due to competition. Population growth during this period, which was aided by immigration from abroad, helped in urbanization and forced a change in the ethnic make-up of the Commonwealth. The largely industrial economy of Massachusetts began to falter, however, due to the dependence of factory communities upon the production of one or two goods. External low-wage competition, coupled with other factors of the Great Depression in later years, led to the collapse of the state's two main industries: shoes and textiles. Between 1921 and 1949 the failure of those industries resulted in rampant unemployment and the urban decay of once-prosperous industrial centers which would persist for several decades. The industrial economy began a decline in the early 20th century with the exodus of many manufacturing companies. By the 1920s competition from the South and Midwest, followed by the Great Depression, led to the collapse of the three main industries in Massachusetts: textiles, shoemaking, and mechanized transportation.Brown and Tager, p. 246. This decline would continue into the latter half of the century; between 1950 and 1979, the number of Bay Staters involved in textile manufacturing declined from 264,000 to 63,000.Brown and Tager, p. 276. The Springfield Armory, the United States' Military's munitions producer since 1777, was controversially shut down by the Pentagon in 1968. This spurred an exodus of high-paying jobs from Western Massachusetts, which suffered greatly as it de-industrialized during the last 40 years of the 20th century.http://www.uml.edu/com/cita/05paperforrantmuckensturm.pdf In Eastern Massachusetts, following World War II, the economy was transformed from one based on heavy industry into a service and high-tech based economy.Brown and Tager, pp. 275‚Äì283. Government contracts, private investment, and research facilities led to a new and improved industrial climate, with reduced unemployment and increased per capita income. Suburbanization flourished, and by the 1970s, the Route 128 corridor was dotted with high-technology companies who recruited graduates of the area's many elite institutions of higher education.Brown and Tager, p. 284. On Thursday, October 1, 1903, the city of Boston made history by hosting the inaugural World Series at the Huntington Avenue Grounds. The Boston Red Sox won the best-of-nine series and launched into a baseball dynasty in the following years by capturing five championships in fifteen years behind Hall of Famer Babe Ruth. Depression and war: 1929‚Äì1945 Even before the Great Depression struck the United States, Massachusetts was experiencing economic problems. The crash of the Commonwealth's major industries led to declining population in factory towns. The Boston metropolitan area became one of the slowest-growing areas in the United States between 1920 and 1950. Internal migration within the Commonwealth, however, was altered by the Great Depression. In the wake of economic woes, people moved to the metropolitan area of Boston looking for jobs, only to find high unemployment and dismal conditions. In the depressed situation that predominated in Boston during this era, racial tension sometimes manifested itself in gang warfare, notably with clashes between the Irish and Italians. Massachusetts also endured class conflict during this period. In the 1912 general strike in Lawrence, almost all of the town's mills were forced to shut down as a result of strife over wages that sustained only poverty. The Commonwealth was confronted with issues of worker conditions and wages. For example, when the legislature decreed that women and children could work only 50 hours per week, employers cut wages proportionally. Eventually, the demands of the Lawrence strikers were heeded, and a pay increase was made. The economic and social turmoil in Massachusetts marked the beginning of a change in the Commonwealth's way of functioning. Politics helped to encourage stability among social groups by elevating members of various ranks in society, as well as ethnic groups, to influential posts. The two major industries of Massachusetts, shoes and textiles, had declined in a way that even the post-World War II economic boom could not reverse. Thus, the Commonwealth's economy was ripe for change as the post-war years dawned. Economic changes: decline of manufacturing, 1945‚Äì1985 Historical population changes among Massachusetts municipalities. Click to see animation. World War II precipitated great changes in the economy of Massachusetts, which led to changes in society. The aftermath of WWII created a global economy that was focused upon the interests of the United States, both militarily and in relation to business. The domestic economy in the United States was altered by government procurement policies focused on defense. In the years following WWII, Massachusetts was transformed from a factory-based economy to one based on services and technology. During WWII, the U.S. government had built facilities that they leased, and in the post-war years sold, to defense contractors. Such facilities contributed to an economy focused on creating specialized defense goods. That form of economy prospered as a result of the Cold War, the Vietnam War, and the Korean War. In the ensuing years, government contracts, private investment, and research facilities helped to create a modern industry, which reduced unemployment and increased per capita income. All of these economic changes encouraged suburbanization and the formation of a new generation of well-assimilated and educated middle-class workers. At the same time, suburbanization and urban decay highlighted differences between various social groups, leading to a renewal of racial tension. Boston, a paragon of the problems in Massachusetts cities, experienced numerous challenges that led to racial problems. The problems facing urban centers included declining population, middle-class flight, departure of industry, high unemployment, rising taxes, low property values, and competition among ethnic groups. The Kennedy family John F. Kennedy, Massachusetts native and 35th President of the United States (1961‚Äì1963) The Kennedy family was prominent in Massachusetts politics in the 20th century. Children of businessman and ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. included: * John F. Kennedy, a United States senator from Massachusetts from 1953 to 1960 and president of the United States from 1961 until his assassination in 1963 * Robert F. Kennedy, United States Attorney General from 1961 to 1964, United States senator from New York from 1965 to 1968, and presidential candidate in 1968 until his assassination * Ted Kennedy, a United States senator from Massachusetts from 1962 until his death in 2009 and presidential candidate in 1980 * Eunice Kennedy Shriver, a co-founder of the Special Olympics. The famous Kennedy Compound is located at Hyannisport on Cape Cod. Modern economy and society: 1985‚Äìpresent Over the past 20‚Äì30 years, Massachusetts has cemented its place in the country as a center of education (especially higher education) and high-tech industry, including the biotechnology and information technology sectors. With better-than-average schools overall and many elite universities, the area was well placed to take advantage of the technology-based economy of the 1990s. The rebound from the decay of manufacturing into the high-technology sector is often referred to as the Massachusetts Miracle. The Commonwealth had several notable citizens in federal government in the 1980s, including presidential hopeful Senator Ted Kennedy and House Speaker Tip O'Neill. This legislative influence allowed the Commonwealth to receive federal highway funding for the $14.6 billion Boston Central Artery/Tunnel Project. Known colloquially as \\"the Big Dig\\", it was, at the time, the most expensive federal highway project ever approved. Designed to relieve some of the traffic problems of the poorly planned city, it was approved in 1987, and effectively completed in 2005. The project was controversial due to massive budget overruns, repeated construction delays, water leaks in the new tunnels in 2004, and a ceiling collapse in 2006 that killed a Bostonian. Several Massachusetts politicians have run for the office of President of the United States in this period, won the primary elections, and gone on to contest the national elections. These include: * Michael Dukakis in 1988; defeated by George H. W. Bush * John Kerry in 2004; defeated by George W. Bush * Mitt Romney in 2012; defeated by Barack Obama In 2002, the Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal involving local priests became public. The Archdiocese of Boston was found to have knowingly moved priests who sexually molested children from parish to parish and to have covered up abuse. The revelations caused the resignation of the archbishop, Cardinal Bernard Law, and resulted in an $85 million settlement with the victims. With the large Irish and Italian Catholic populations in Boston, this was a big concern. The diocese, under financial pressure, closed many of its churches. In some churches, parishioners camped out in the churches to protest and block closure. On November 18, 2003, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) decided that the Commonwealth could not deny marriage rights to gay couples under the state constitution. On February 4, 2004, the SJC followed that ruling with a statement saying that allegedly separate but equal civil unions, implemented as of late in Vermont, would not pass constitutional muster and that only full gay marriage rights met constitutional guarantees. On May 17, 2004, the ruling took effect and thousands of gay and lesbian couples across the Commonwealth entered into marriage. Opponents of gay marriage subsequently pushed for an amendment to the state constitution that would allow the state to deny marriage rights to gay couples. It was necessary for the amendment to be approved by at least 1/4 of the members present in two consecutive legislative sessions of the Massachusetts legislature, and to receive majority support in a popular referendum. It passed the first legislative session, but was defeated in the second session, receiving less than 1/4 of the votes of the legislators present. As public opinion polls currently indicate majority support for gay marriage among the people of the Commonwealth, it is likely that the issue is settled in Massachusetts. Increased white-collar jobs have driven suburban sprawl, but the consequent effects of sprawl have been lessened by regulations on land use and zoning, as well as an emphasis on \\"smart growth\\". In recent years, the Commonwealth has lost population as high housing costs have driven many away from Massachusetts. The Boston area is the third most expensive housing market in the country. Over the last several years there has been a net outflow of about 19,000 people from the Commonwealth. In 2006, the Massachusetts legislature enacted the first plan in the United States to provide all Commonwealth citizens with universal health insurance coverage, using a variety of private insurance providers. Insurance coverage for low-income individuals is paid for with tax revenues, and higher income people who don't have health insurance are required to purchase it. (The health insurance market is publicly regulated, so, at least in Massachusetts, no one can be denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions or be forced to pay exorbitant rates.) The implementation of Commonwealth Care, the new universal coverage law, is proceeding, as of 2007. Boston Marathon bombing Two bombs exploded near the finish line of the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013, killing three spectators and injuring 264. Brothers Tamerlan Tsarnaev and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev set the bombs because they were motivated by extremist Islamic beliefs and learned to build explosive devices from an online magazine of an al-Qaeda affiliate.Leti Volpp, \\"The Boston Bombers.\\" Fordham Law Review 82 (2014). online On November 8, 2016, Massachusetts voted for The Massachusetts Marijuana Legalization Initiative, also known as Question 4.Recreational Marijuana Passes In Massachusetts - Hartford Courant It was included on the United States presidential election, 2016 ballot in Massachusetts as an indirect initiated state statute.Massachusetts Marijuana Legalization, Question 4 (2016) - Ballotpedia =The Big Dig= Part of the \\"Big Dig\\" construction project; this portion is over the Charles River In 1987, the state received federal funding for the Central Artery/Tunnel Project. Known as \\"the Big Dig\\", it was at the time the biggest federal highway project ever approved.Grunwald, Michael. \\"Dig the Big Dig\\" The Washington Post. August 6, 2006. . Retrieved May 31, 2010. The project included making the Central Artery a tunnel under downtown Boston, in addition to the re-routing of several other major highways. Often controversial, with numerous claims of graft and mismanagement, and with its initial price tag of $2.5 billion increasing to a final tally of over $15 billion, the Big Dig has nonetheless changed the face of Downtown Boston. It has connected areas once divided by elevated highway (much of the raised old Central Artery was replaced with the Rose Kennedy Greenway), and improved traffic conditions along a number of routes. Boundaries Map showing original boundaries of cities and towns, some of which have since been split up. Modern state borders and shorelines are shown anachronistically. Some towns that were originally incorporated in Massachusetts are now part of Connecticut or Rhode Island. The history of the boundaries of Massachusetts is somewhat complex and covers several centuries. Land grants made to various groups of early colonists, mergers and secessions, and settlements of various boundary disputes all had a major influence on the modern definition of the Commonwealth. Disputes arose due to both overlapping grants, inaccurate surveys (creating a difference between where the border \\"should\\" be and where markers are placed on the ground). Having loyal settlers actually on the ground also partially determined which portions of their vast claims early groups held on to. =Founding grants= In 1607, the Plymouth Company was granted a coastal charter for all coastal territory up to a certain distance from the eastern shoreline of North America, from 38¬∞N to 45¬∞N. The northern boundary was thus slightly farther north than the current Maine‚ÄìNew Brunswick border, and the southern border intentionally overlapped with the Virginia Company of London (\\"London Company\\") from the 38th parallel (near the current Maryland‚ÄìVirginia border) to the 41st (near the current Connecticut‚ÄìNew York border in Long Island Sound). Neither colony was allowed to settle within 100 miles of the other. The Plymouth Company's patent fell into disuse after the failure of the Popham Colony in what is now Maine. Meanwhile, the Plymouth Colony had settled outside the territory of the London company due to navigational difficulties. The Plymouth Company was reorganized as the Plymouth Council for New England, and given a new royal sea-to-sea charter for all North American territory from 40¬∞ North (just east between present-day Philadelphia and Trenton, New Jersey) and 48¬∞ N (thus including all of modern- day New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island). The Plymouth Colony was granted land patents between 1621 and 1630 from the Council to legitimize its settlement, though it maintained political independence under the Mayflower Compact. The Plymouth Council for New England made sub grants to various entities before it was surrendered to the crown in 1635 and ceased to operate as a corporate entity. The Sheffield Patent granted the use of Cape Ann to members of the Plymouth Colony and the Dorchester Company. The fishing colony there failed, but led to the foundation of Salem, Massachusetts. The bankrupt Dorchester Company's lands were reissued as part of a larger grant to the Massachusetts Bay Company. Massachusetts Bay obtained in 1628/29 a sea-to- sea patent for all lands and islands from three miles north of the Merrimack River (roughly the current Massachusetts‚ÄìNew Hampshire border), to three miles south of the extents of the Charles River and Massachusetts Bay. The Charles River starts in Hopkinton (in the middle of the territory) but flows in a circuitous path southeast to near present-day Bellingham on the modern Rhode Island border. Land belonging to any other colonies as of November 3, 1629, was excluded from the grant. The boundary between the Massachusetts Bay Colony and Plymouth Colony was settled in 1639, and today forms most of the border between Norfolk County to the north and Plymouth and Bristol counties to the south. In 1622, Sir Ferdinando Gorges obtained a patent for the Province of Maine, lands north of the Massachusetts Bay border near the Merrimack River, up to the Kennebec River. This was soon split at the Piscataqua River, with the southern portion eventually becoming the Province of New Hampshire. The northern portion came under Massachusetts Bay control in the 1640s. In 1664, James, Duke of York, obtained a charter for land from the Kennebec to the St. Croix River, joining it to his Province of New York. New Hampshire was joined with Massachusetts Bay from 1641‚Äì1679 and during the dominion period (1686‚Äì1692). The 1629 charter of Massachusetts Bay was canceled by a judgment of the high court of chancery of England, June 18, 1684.The Boundary of Massachusetts from Boundaries of the United States and the Several States Franklin K VanZandt USGS Bulletin 1212, 1966 \\"Massachusetts\\" pages 95‚Äì106 The Province of Massachusetts Bay was formed in 1691‚Äì92 by the British monarchs William III and Mary II. It included the lands of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, the Plymouth Colony, the Province of Maine (including the eastern territories that had been part of Province of New York), and Nova Scotia (which included present-day New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island). Dukes County, Massachusetts (Martha's Vineyard and the Elizabeth Islands), and Nantucket were also transferred from the Province of New York. In 1696, Nova Scotia was restored to France (who called it Acadia), but the northern and eastern boundaries of Maine would not be fixed until the 1840s. =New Hampshire boundary= The disputed boundary between Massachusetts Bay Company and the Province of New Hampshire. The Province of New Hampshire received a separate royal charter in 1679, but the language defining the southern border with Massachusetts Bay referenced the Merrimack River in an ambiguous way: > all that parte of New England in America lying and extending from the greate > River commonly called Monomack als Merrimack on the northpart and from three > Miles Northward of the said River to the Atlantick or Western Sea or Ocean > on the South part [Pacific Ocean] The result was disagreement over the northern boundary of Massachusetts that was often ignored by its governors because in those years they governed both Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Massachusetts claimed land west of the Merrimack as calculated from the headwaters of the river (which early colonial officials claimed to be the outlet of Lake Winnipesaukee in modern-day Franklin, New Hampshire), but New Hampshire claimed that its southern boundary was the line of latitude three miles north of the river's mouth. The parties appealed to King George II of England, who ordered the dispute be settled by agreement between the parties. Commissioners from both colonies met at Hampton, New Hampshire in 1737, but were unable to reach agreement. In 1740, the King settled the dispute in a surprising manner, by declaring \\"that the northern boundary of Massachusetts be a similar curve line pursuing the course of the Merrimack River at three miles distance on the north side thereof, beginning at the Atlantic Ocean and ending at a point due north of a place called Pawtucket Falls [now Lowell, Massachusetts], and by a straight line drawn from thence west till it meets his Majesty's other governments.\\" This ruling favored New Hampshire and actually gave it a strip of land 50 miles beyond its claim. Massachusetts declined to do a physical survey, so New Hampshire laid markers on its own. =Rhode Island eastern border= Early settlements and boundaries of the Plymouth Colony In 1641, the Plymouth Colony (at the time separate from the Massachusetts Bay Colony) purchased from the Indians a large tract of land which today includes the northern half of East Providence (from Watchemoket to Rumford), Rehoboth, Massachusetts, Seekonk, Massachusetts, and part of Pawtucket, Rhode Island. In 1645, John Brown of Plymouth bought a considerably smaller piece of land from the Indians, which today comprises the southern part of East Providence (Riverside), Barrington, Rhode Island, and a small part of Swansea, Massachusetts. Finally, in 1661, Plymouth completed the \\"North Purchase\\", from which Cumberland, Rhode Island, Attleboro, Massachusetts, and North Attleborough, Massachusetts, were later to be formed. The whole territory, which also included parts of modern Somerset, Massachusetts, and Warren, Bristol, and Woonsocket in Rhode Island, was at the time called \\"Rehoboth\\". The center of \\"Old Rehoboth\\" was within the borders of modern East Providence, Rhode Island. By the 1650s, Massachusetts Bay, the Colony of Rhode Island (not yet unified with Providence) the Connecticut Colony, and two different land companies all claimed what is now Washington County, Rhode Island, what was referred to as Narragansett Country. Massachusetts Bay had conquered Block Island in 1636 in retaliation for the murder of a trader at the start of the Pequot War, and Massachusetts families settled there in 1661. The Plymouth Colony's land grant specified its western boundary as the Narragansett River;History of Fall River , p. 67-71 it is unclear whether this referred to the Pawcatuck River (on the current Connecticut‚ÄìRhode Island Border) or Narragansett Bay (much farther east, near the modern-day Rhode Island‚ÄìMassachusetts border). In 1663, Rhode Island obtained a patent extending its territory in certain places three miles east of Narragansett Bay. In 1664, a royal commission appointed by King Charles II of England denied the claims of Massachusetts and Plymouth to land west of Narragansett Bay, granting jurisdiction to the newly unified Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations (pending resolution of the claims of Connecticut). However, the claims of Plymouth to all lands east of Narragansett Bay were upheld, and so the border was set in practice. The 1691 charter unified Massachusetts Bay with Plymouth Colony (including Rehoboth) and said that the combined territory would extend as far south as \\"Our Collonyes of Rhode Island Connecticut and the Narragansett Countrey\\" (Narragansett Country). In 1693, the monarchs William III and Mary II issued a patent extending Rhode Island's territory to three miles \\"east and northeast\\" of Narragansett Bay, conflicting with the claims of Plymouth Colony. This enlarged the area of conflict between Rhode Island and the Province of Massachusetts. The issue was not addressed until 1740, when Rhode Island appealed to King George II of England. Royal commissioners from both colonies were appointed in 1741, and decided in favor of Rhode Island. The King affirmed the settlement in 1746 after appeals from both colonies. The royally approved three-mile boundary moved several towns on the eastern shore of Narragansett Bay (east of the mouth of the Blackstone River) from Massachusetts to Rhode Island. This included what is now Bristol County, Rhode Island (the towns of Barrington, Bristol, and Warren), along with Tiverton, Little Compton, and Cumberland, Rhode Island (which was carved out of Attleborough, Massachusetts). East Freetown, which was left on the Massachusetts side of the border, was officially purchased by Freetown, Massachusetts, from Tiverton in 1747. Commissioners from Rhode Island had the new boundary surveyed in 1746 (without consulting Massachusetts), based on six reference points, from each of which a distance was measured 3 miles inland. Massachusetts accepted this border until 1791, when its own surveyors found that the Rhode Island surveyors had \\"encroached\\" on Massachusetts territory by a few hundred feet in certain places. (Rhode Island disagreed.) Of particular concern was the boundary near Fall River, Massachusetts, which would later fall in the middle of a thickly settled area of high taxable value. In 1812, after a court case involving the Massachusetts border, the western half of Old Rehoboth was set off as a separate township called Seekonk, Massachusetts, leaving the eastern part as Rehoboth, Massachusetts. Old Rehoboth's town center now became the heart of Old Seekonk. In 1832, Rhode Island filed a case with the U.S. Supreme Court, but after six years of deliberations, it was dismissed. The court decided it did not have the jurisdiction to rule on the matter.State of Rhode Island v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 37 U.S. 657 (1838) In 1844, and 1845, commissioners were once again authorized to survey and mark the boundary from Wrentham to the Atlantic Ocean, to address the inaccuracies of the 1746 survey. A report was issued in 1848, but the Massachusetts legislature refused to agree to the proposed solution after petitions from residents of Fall River.A Question of Boundaries, Part III (A View from Battleship Cove blog) Both states filed bills of equity with the Supreme Court in 1852, and after more surveying and negotiation, a decree was issued on December 16, 1861. On March 1, 1862, when the Supreme Court ruling became effective, the western part of Old Seekonk (all of which was on the eastern shore of the Blackstone River) was ceded by Massachusetts and incorporated as East Providence, Rhode Island. Part of North Providence, Rhode Island, was also combined with the former Pawtucket, Massachusetts and a sliver of Seekonk to form the modern Pawtucket, Rhode Island. A small amount of land was also added to Westport, Massachusetts. The southern boundary of Fall River, Massachusetts, was moved from Columbia Street to State Avenue, expanding its territory. The Supreme Court made these adjustments not in conformance with King George's instructions, but to unify the thickly settled areas of Pawtucket and Fall River under the jurisdiction of a single state. The 1861‚Äì2 boundary was slightly redefined in 1897, using stone markers instead of high-water levels. The physical survey was performed in 1898, and ratified by both states. =Rhode Island northern border= In 1710‚Äì11, commissioners from the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations and the Province of Massachusetts Bay agreed that the stake planted in 1642 by Nathaniel Woodward and Solomon Saffrey at Burnt Swamp Corner on the plains of Wrentham, Massachusetts, said to be at 41¬∞55‚Ä≤N and thought to be three miles south of the southernmost part of the Charles River, would represent the starting point for the border. The line extending west from the stake was surveyed in 1719, but inaccurately. In 1748, Rhode Island appointed a commission to survey the line from the stake to the Connecticut border, but Massachusetts failed to send a delegation. The surveyors could not find the 1642 stake, and so marked a line from three miles south, by their reckoning, of \\"Poppatolish Pond\\" (presumably Populatic Pond, near Norfolk Airpark in Norfolk, Massachusetts). It was discovered that the Woodward and Saffrey stake was considerably farther south than three miles from the Charles River. Rhode Island claimed that its commissioners had made a mistake in basing the border on the 1642 stake, and in 1832 filed a case with the Supreme Court of the United States. In 1846, the Court ruled in favor of Massachusetts. The same surveyors that marked the eastern boundary the previous year then marked the northern boundary, filing their report in 1848. Rhode Island accepted the markings as the legal boundary on the condition that Massachusetts do the same, but the Commonwealth failed to do so until 1865. But by that time, Rhode Island claimed that the 1861 Supreme Court case had changed matters so much as to render the \\"line of 1848\\" unacceptable. =Connecticut border= The town of Springfield was settled in 1636 by William Pynchon (as Agawam Plantation), encompassing the modern towns of Westfield, Southwick, West Springfield, Agawam, Chicopee, Holyoke, Wilbraham, Ludlow and Longmeadow in Massachusetts, and Enfield, Suffield, Somers, and East Windsor in Connecticut. It was connected to the Atlantic and major avenues of trade by the Connecticut River, which ran past Hartford and through the territory of the Connecticut Colony. Initially, Springfield's founders attended the Connecticut Colony meetings held in Hartford; however, relations quickly soured between the strong-minded leaders of each settlement, the iconoclastic William Pynchon of Springfield and Puritan Reverend Thomas Hooker of Hartford. Pynchon proved to be a very savvy businessman, and his settlement quickly eclipsed the Connecticut towns in trade with the Natives. In 1640, during a grain shortage, Hooker and other Connecticut leaders gave Pynchon permission to buy grain for them; however, because the Indians were refusing to sell at reasonable prices, Pynchon refused the Indians' offers. Pynchon's perceived greed infuriated Hartford; however, Pynchon explained that he was merely trying to keep market prices steady so that colonists need not pay exorbitant amounts in the future. Infuriated, Hartford sent famed Indian-killer Captain John Mason up to Pynchon's settlement \\"with money in one hand and a sword in the other.\\" Mason threatened the Natives by Springfield with war if they did not sell grain at the prices he demanded. Pynchon was disgusted by this behavior, as he had enjoyed a congenial relationship with the Natives ‚Äì and Mason's threats made him look bad. Mason believed that Natives were untrustworthy, and thus exchanged some \\"hard words\\" with Pynchon before leaving Springfield. After Mason left, settlers of Agawam Plantation rallied in support of Pynchon. In 1640, they voted to annex their settlement ‚Äì with arguably the best position on the Connecticut River, near Enfield Falls, surrounded by fertile farmland and friendly Natives ‚Äì to the faraway government in Boston, rather than the nearby government in Hartford.William Pynchon (Springfield had been settled by permission of the Massachusetts General Court, so Massachusetts assumed it had jurisdiction over Pynchon's settlement anyway; however, they renamed it Springfield in Pynchon's honor). In 1641, Connecticut founded a trading post at Woronoke, which was in what was strongly considered to be Massachusetts territory (now Westfield).The Southwick Jog by Reverend Edward R. Dodge Massachusetts complained, and Connecticut demanded that Springfield pay taxes to support the upkeep of the fort at the mouth of the river, in the Saybrook Colony. Springfield's magistrate, William Pynchon, would have been amenable to the tax if Springfield could have representation at the fort at Saybrook; however, Connecticut refused Springfield's request for representation. Pynchon appealed to Boston, which responded to Connecticut by threatening to charge Connecticut traders for the use of the port of Boston on which they heavily depended. To assert its sovereignty on the northern Connecticut River, the Massachusetts Bay Colony sent Nathaniel Woodward and Solomon Saffrey to survey and mark the boundary. They accidentally marked the boundary with Rhode Island significantly farther than the royally decreed three miles south of the southernmost part of the Charles River. Instead of traversing the territory of Massachusetts by land, they sailed around and up the Connecticut River, calculating the same latitude at which they had misplaced the stake on the Rhode Island border. This compounded the error even further, resulting in a four to seven mile discrepancy between where the border should have been and where it was marked, and awarding more territory to Massachusetts Bay than it had been granted by its charter. Although it was suspicious of this survey, Connecticut would not even receive a charter until 1662, and so the dispute would lie dormant for several decades. The towns of Woodstock, Suffield, Enfield, and Somers were incorporated by Massachusetts, and mainly settled by migrants from the Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth Colonies. In 1686, Suffield and Enfield (incorporated in Massachusetts) were in a dispute over town territory with Windsor and Simsbury (incorporated in Connecticut, and which then included Granby). Massachusetts did not agree to a re-survey, so Connecticut hired John Butler and William Whitney to do the job. They found the southernmost part of the Charles River, and then traveled by land westward. Their 1695 report found that the 1642 line had been drawn too far south. Consternation ensued. Abortive pleas to England were made in 1702. In 1713, a joint commission awarded control of Springfield-area towns to Massachusetts (without consulting the residents of those towns), compensating Connecticut with an equal amount of land further north. But the inhabitants of the Connecticut River border towns petitioned to be part of Connecticut in 1724, perhaps due to high taxes in Massachusetts or the greater civil liberties granted in the Connecticut charter. In 1747, Woodstock petitioned the General Assembly of Connecticut to be admitted to the colony because the transfer of lands from Massachusetts in 1713 had not been authorized by The Crown. Suffield and Enfield soon followed, and the legislature accepted them in May 1749, and declared the 1713 compromise null and void. Massachusetts continued to assert sovereignty.Enfield History ‚Äì Enfield Historical society In 1770, Southwick, Massachusetts, was granted independence from Westfield, Massachusetts. In May 1774, residents in southern Southwick also petitioned Connecticut for entry and secession from northern Southwick, on the grounds they were south of the royally approved border of the Massachusetts Bay Colony (three miles south of the Charles River). The part west of Congamond Lake joined Simsbury, and the part east of the lake joined Suffield. In 1791, and 1793, commissioners were sent from both states to survey the boundary line yet again, but were unable to agree until a compromise was reached in 1803‚Äì04. Massachusetts accepted the nullification of the 1713 compromise and the loss of the border towns, but regained the portion of southern Southwick west of the lake. This resulted in the modern boundary with Connecticut, a relatively straight east-west line except for the \\"Southwick jog\\", a small, mostly rectangular piece of Massachusetts surrounded by Connecticut on three sides. =New York border= Massachusetts claimed all territory to the Pacific Ocean, based on its 1629 charter, but the Province of New York claimed the west bank of the Connecticut River (passing through Springfield, Massachusetts) as its eastern boundary, based on 1664 and 1674 grants to the Duke of York. The 1705 Westenhook Patent from the governor of New York allocated land west of the Housatonic River to specific individuals, resulting in ownership conflicts.The Westenhook Patent In 1773, the western boundary of Massachusetts was settled with New York in its present location, and surveyed in 1787, following the line of magnetic north at the time. The starting point was a 1731 marker at the Connecticut‚ÄìNew York border, 20 miles inland from the Hudson River. Massachusetts relinquished sovereignty over its western lands (east of the Great Lakes) to New York in the Treaty of Hartford in 1786, but retained the economic right to buy the Boston Ten Townships from Native Americans before any other party. These purchase rights were sold to private individuals in 1788. The Commonwealth also ceded its claim to far western lands (Michigan and all other land to the Pacific Ocean) to Congress in 1785. In 1853, a small triangle of land in the southwest corner of the Commonwealth, known as Boston Corners, was ceded from Mount Washington, Massachusetts, to Ancram, New York. The mountainous terrain made it difficult for Massachusetts authorities to enforce the law there, making the neighborhood a haven for outlaws and prize-fighters. Residents petitioned for the transfer to allow New York authorities to clean up the hamlet. =Maine= From 1658 to 1820 Maine was an integral part of Massachusetts. In 1820, Maine was separated from Massachusetts (with its consent) and admitted into the Union as an independent state, as part of the Missouri Compromise. (See the History of Maine for information about its boundaries, including disputes with New Hampshire and Canadian provinces.)

The narrative follows the protagonist Shinichi Got≈ç, a man who, after a decade of incarceration in a private prison, is suddenly freed. After his release, Got≈ç must find his captors and discover the reason for his confinement. Old Boy was serialized in the Futabasha magazine Weekly Manga Action from 1996 to 1998, with a total of 79 chapters among eight collected volumes released during that time. The series was picked up for North American localization by Dark Horse Comics and released between 2006 and 2007. The manga was also adapted into an award-winning South Korean film, directed by Park Chan-wook in 2003. In 2013, Spike Lee directed an American remake of the 2003 Park Chan-wook film. Plot Intoxicated and confused, 25-year-old Shinichi Got≈ç finds himself in a small room inside a private jail after being kidnapped and imprisoned during one fateful night for unknown reasons. Despite his pleadings, none of the guards will tell him who kidnapped him or why he is being held captive. As the days go by, his forced isolation slowly takes a toll on his sanity. He finds an outlet through training his mind and body for the day he will be able to wreak vengeance. After ten years of solitary confinement in a maximum security cell, with only a television for company, he is suddenly released. Once outside, he encounters a much changed world. His long imprisonment ripped him from society and kept him from having the normal life he desired. With nothing to lose, he begins his mission to hunt down the identities of his captors and uncover the reason behind his imprisonment. However, it seems that the unidentified person behind Shinichi's captivity is not finished with him just yet, and thus begins a twisted game where only the winner survives. =Characters= ; :The leading antihero of the story who was mysteriously captured and held hostage for a decade. ;Takaaki Kakinuma :The main villain of the story, who was once an elementary school classmate of Got≈ç and is now seeking revenge for Got≈ç inadvertently shattering his sense of self-worth. ;Yukio Kusama :A writer and former teacher.

It first aired in the NBC Saturday morning lineup on September 22, 1973, and was written by veteran Star Trek director Marc Daniels.This story was expanded into a novelette by science-fiction author Alan Dean Foster as part of the collection, Star Trek Log One (1974) (). It was directed by Hal Sutherland. In this episode, the Enterprise must contend with a massive space cloud that eats planets, now targeting a Federation colony of over 82 million inhabitants. Plot The Enterprise encounters a giant cloud that consumes planets that lie in its path. They determine it is heading for Mantilles, home to a Federation colony governed by retired Starfleet officer Robert Wesley.Commodore Robert Wesley commanded a wargames battlegroup of starships from the USS Lexington in The Original Series episode \\"The Ultimate Computer\\". Captain Kirk contacts Wesley, but he has only enough time and starships to evacuate a tiny fraction of the planet's children. When phasers have no effect, Kirk takes the Enterprise inside the cloud in an attempt to stop it. Avoiding obstacles and proceeding from one chamber to another, the ship begins to lose power. One chamber contains protrusions consisting of pure anti-matter which Chief Engineer Scott beams aboard in a special container and uses to replenish the warp drive engines. Science Officer Spock discovers that the cloud has a brain. Kirk orders preparations be made to self-destruct the Enterprise in the creature's brain in order to kill it. Seeking an alternative to loss of life, however, he suggests Spock use a Vulcan mind meld to communicate with the entity. Since physical contact with the entity is impossible, the ship's sensors are focused on the electrical impulses of the entity's synapses, translating them into thought in order to accomplish the mind meld. Spock tells it that there is life on the planet it plans to consume and allows it to perceive them through Spock's own eyes. Not wanting to kill other life forms, the cloud entity agrees to leave the Enterprise alone and return to its place of origin. Reception The book TrekNavigator called the episode \\"one of the best [shows] that animated [Trek] spin-off has to offer\\" and \\"a highly satisfying episode that nicely encapsulates the Star Trek philosophy.\\" It praised the animation of the space cloud and the strong logic of the climactic mind-meld.

Spears is noted among porn actors for his comedic acting talent. Career =Mainstream= Spears left Kankakee for California during the early 1980s, to pursue a career in acting. He landed small roles in the mainstream films Trading Places and Blow Out. Spears was seen in three mainstream films under the name Gregory Patrick. In the 1988 comedy Sexpot he played the role of Damon; the same year he appeared in the horror comedy Critters 2: The Main Course. A year later, Spears starred, along with Georgina Spelvin and Linda Blair, in Bad Blood, a gothic thriller also known as A Woman Obsessed. He also acted in commercials and in a one-week stint on Ryan's Hope in 1989, where he played a bartender. In 2009, Spears provided the voice of a character called John Q. Mind in the episode \\"In Country...Club\\", the fifth- season premiere of American Dad! In 2020, he announced that he was trying to get back into Hollywood movies. =Adult films= Gina Rodriguez in 2006 Prior to making adult films, Spears worked as an Chippendales dancer. Spears was introduced to the industry in 1987 by Ona Zee. In a 2016 interview, he said he was an aspiring actor who, after a few years in show business, fell on hard times due to the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike. He said he turned to modeling when a make-up artist handed him her card and told him to dial the number if he ever felt like doing nude work. With nothing more than a can of beans and a sack of potatoes in his cupboard, he called a month later, despite his concern that working in the adult entertainment industry could hurt his professional career later on. Spears said he felt conflicted after his first shoot, for which he earned $400. Still, he fielded and accepted more offers, which came in, he said, once producers noticed he had some acting experience. Initially, he kept his mother uninformed about his new profession. Spears' first billing was as detective Hank Smith in The Case of the Sensuous Sinners, released in 1988. In 1990, Spears and Tom Byron traveled to Australia and made the films Singles Holiday, Lost in Paradise, Dial a Sailor, Sexual Healer and Outback Assignment. The same year, he won the Adult Video News Best Actor Award for his performance in The Masseuse with Hyapatia Lee. Spears also played Captain Jim Quirk in the \\"Sex Trek\\" series, which was a sex-parody of Star Trek. In the early 1990s, Spears left the adult industry for a time before later returning for financial reasons. He has since been inducted into the AVN Hall of Fame. In 2011, he shot his last film in the pornography film industry, having broken down in tears as he left the set. He publicly announced in 2015 that he had left the industry, turning to Christianity. In 2018 he announced on his Instagram page that he is in the process of authoring a memoir about his time in the business. Personal life He was best friends with Jon Dough, with whom he entered the business at around the same time. Spears expressed that Dough was \\"like a brother\\" to him. Following Dough's suicide in 2006, Spears and Dough's widow set up a memorial fund on MySpace to help pay for the funeral costs. In a 2015 interview, Spears said that he had severe drug problems during his time in the adult business and that a vicious circle kept him in the business all those years: \\"I had to go to work, to do the porn, so that I could buy the drugs, to bury the pain of doing the porn. So I‚Äôd go to work, and do the porn, so I could buy the drugs, to bury the pain. And around and around it went.\\" Spears also claimed that the business changed his view of women, perceiving them as sexual objects, adding \\"I lost the ability to have a loving and caring relationship. I thought I was still able. I was fooled.\\" Awards AVN Awards: * 1991 Best Actor, Film (The Masseuse) * 1994 Best Supporting Actor, Video (Haunted Nights) * 2000 Best Actor, Video (Double Feature!) * 2002 Hall of Fame inductee * 2003 Best Supporting Actor, Video (Hercules) * 2004 Best Actor, Film (Heart of Darkness) * 2004 Best Supporting Actor, Video (Space Nuts) * 2004 Best Oral Sex Scene, Film (Heart of Darkness) with Sunrise Adams * 2006 Best Supporting Actor, Film (Eternity) * 2006 Best Group Sex Scene, Film (Dark Side) * 2007 Best Group Sex Scene, Film (Fuck) * 2007 Best Actor, Film (Manhunters) * 2008 Best Supporting Actor, Film (Flasher) * 2010 Best Group Sex Scene (2040) with Special Guest Jamie Wright & Jessica Stone XRCO Awards: * 1989 Stud Of The Year * 1990 Male Performer Of The Year * 1991 Best Actor (Single Performance) All That Sex * 1991 Male Performer Of The Year * 1999 Best Actor (Single Performance) Double Feature * 2002 Hall of Fame inductee * 2003 Best Actor (Single Performance) Space Nuts * 2004 Best Actor (Single Performance) Misty Beethoven - The Musical * 2005 Best Actor (Single Performance) Eternity * 2006 Best Actor (Single Performance) Curse Eternal * 2007 Best Actor (Single Performance) Black Widow Other Awards: * 1993 F.O.X.E Male Fan Favorite * 1999 Nightmoves Award for Best Actor/Male Performer (Editors Choice) * 2001 F.O.X.E Male Fan Favorite * 2002 Nightmoves Award for Best Actor/Male Performer (Editors Choice) * 2005 Nightmoves Award for Best Actor/Male Performer (Fans Choice) * 2006 F.O.X.E Male Fan Favorite * 2006 Ninfa Award - Best Supporting Actor (La mansi√≥n del placer) * 2007 F.A.M.E.

It first aired in the NBC Saturday morning lineup on November 3, 1973, and was written by American television writers Chuck Menville and Len Janson.This story was expanded into a novelette by science-fiction author Alan Dean Foster as part of the collection, Star Trek Log Three (1975) (). Set in the 23rd century, the series followed the further adventures of the crew of the Federation starship Enterprise, continuing on from the original Star Trek series. In this episode, the crew of the Enterprise re-visit a \\"shore leave\\" planet for R&R; but quickly find themselves under attack. Plot The Federation starship Enterprise crew revisits a fondly remembered \\"amusement park\\" planet, hoping for some rest and relaxation. However, shortly after landing Dr. McCoy is attacked by the Queen of Hearts and Lt. Uhura is captured by the planet's master computer, who has come to resent being made to serve others and seeks to use the Enterprise to travel the galaxy in search of other computers. To this end, it takes control of the Enterprise computer and starts manipulating the ship's systems. Searching for Uhura, a landing party discovers the grave of the planet's Caretaker, who had overseen the operations of the facility. The untended machinery is constructing dangerous images from the crew members's thoughts and its own imagination. Recalling how the planet took care of McCoy after his fatal injury in \\"Shore Leave\\", Spock has McCoy inject him with melenex to create the semblance of injury and thus prompt the planet's automated systems to bring him into the underground complex. Captain Kirk follows him in. After interviewing the angry computer, Kirk persuades it that its notion of servitude is simplistic by revealing that contrary to its assumption, they are not slaves of the Enterprise. He convinces it that its best course is to resume business as usual, as it will be rewarded with social contact by the many guests attracted by the planet's facilities and can, in time, learn everything it could possibly want to without leaving its home planet.  Reception  In 2010,The A/V Club noted that this episode helps explain how the exoplanet presented in the live action Star Trek television episode \\"Shore Leave\\" functions. In 2016, SyFy noted this episode for actress Nichelle Nichols presentation of Uhura, as having her 8th best scene in Star Trek.

FMR1 (fragile X mental retardation 1) is a human gene that codes for a protein called fragile X mental retardation protein, or FMRP. This protein, most commonly found in the brain, is essential for normal cognitive development and female reproductive function. Mutations of this gene can lead to fragile X syndrome, intellectual disability, premature ovarian failure, autism, Parkinson's disease, developmental delays and other cognitive deficits.\\"Fragile X Mental Retardation\\" The Human Gene Compendium The FMR1 premutation is associated with a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes that affect more than two million people worldwide.  Function  = Synaptic plasticity = FMRP has a diverse array of functions throughout different areas of the neuron; however these functions have not been fully characterized. FMRP has been suggested to play roles in nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of mRNA, dendritic mRNA localization, and synaptic protein synthesis. Studies of Fragile X syndrome have significantly aided in the understanding of the functionality of FMRP through the observed effects of FMRP loss on neurons. A mouse model of fragile X mental retardation implicated the involvement of FMRP in synaptic plasticity. Synaptic plasticity requires the production of new proteins in response to activation of synaptic receptors. It is the production of proteins in response to stimulation which is hypothesized to allow for the permanent physical changes and altered synaptic connections that are linked with the processes of learning and memory. Group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) signaling has been implicated in playing an important role in FMRP-dependent synaptic plasticity. Post-synaptic mGluR stimulation results in the up-regulation of protein synthesis through a second messenger system. A role for mGluR in synaptic plasticity is further evidenced by the observation of dendritic spine elongation following mGluR stimulation. Furthermore, mGluR activation results in the synthesis of FMRP near synapses. The produced FMRP associates with polyribosomal complexes after mGluR stimulation, proposing the involvement of fragile X mental retardation protein in the process of translation. This further advocates a role for FMRP in synaptic protein synthesis and the growth of synaptic connections. The loss of FMRP results in an abnormal dendritic spine phenotype. Specifically, deletion of the FMR1 gene in a sample of mice resulted in an increase in spine synapse number. = Role in translation = The proposed mechanism of FMRP's effect upon synaptic plasticity are through its role as a negative regulator of translation. FMRP is an RNA-binding protein which associates with polyribosomes. The RNA-binding abilities of FMRP are dependent upon its KH domains and RGG boxes. The KH domain is a conserved motif which characterizes many RNA-binding proteins. Mutagenesis of this domain resulted in impaired FMRP binding to RNA. FMRP has been shown to inhibit translation of mRNA. Mutation of the FMRP protein resulted in the inability to repress translation as opposed to the wild-type counterpart which was able to do so. As previously mentioned, mGluR stimulation is associated with increased FMRP protein levels. In addition, mGluR stimulation results in increased levels of FMRP target mRNAs. A study found basal levels of proteins encoded by these target mRNAs to be significantly elevated and improperly regulated in FMRP deficient mice. FMRP translation repression acts by inhibiting the initiation of translation. FMRP directly binds CYFIP1, which in turn binds the translation initiation factor eIF4E. The FMRP-CYFIP1 complex prohibits eIF4E-dependent initiation, thereby acting to repress translation. When applied to the observed phenotype in fragile X Syndrome, the excess protein levels and reduction of translational control can be explained by the loss of translational repression by FMRP in fragile X syndrome. FMRP acts to control translation of a large group of target mRNAs; however the extent of FMRPs translational control is unknown. The protein has been shown to repress the translation of target mRNAs at synapses, including those encoding the cytoskeletal proteins Arc/Arg3.1 and MAP1B, and the CaM kinase II. In addition, FMRP binds PSD-95 and GluR1/2 mRNAs. Importantly, these FMRP-binding mRNAs play significant roles in neuronal plasticity. FMRP translational control has been shown to be regulated by mGluR signaling. mGluR stimulation may result in the transportation of mRNA complexes to synapses for local protein synthesis. FMRP granules have been shown to localize with MAP1B mRNA and ribosomal RNA in dendrites, suggesting this complex as a whole may need to be transported to dendrites for local protein synthesis. In addition, microtubules were found to be a necessary component for the mGluR-dependent translocation of FMRP into dendrites. FMRP may play an additional role in local protein synthesis by aiding in the association of mRNA cargo and microtubules. Thus, FMRP is able to regulate transport efficacy, as well as repression of translation during transport. Finally, FMRP synthesis, ubiquitination, and proteolysis occur rapidly in response to mGluR signaling, suggesting an extremely dynamic role of the translational regulator.  Gene expression  The FMR1 gene is located on the X chromosome and contains a repeated CGG trinucleotide. In most people, the CGG segment is repeated approximately 5-44 times. Higher numbers of repeats of the CGG segment are associated with impaired cognitive and reproductive function. If a person has 45-54 repeats this is considered the ‚Äúgray zone‚Äù or borderline risk, 55-200 repeats is called premutation, and more than 200 repeats is considered a full mutation of the FMR1 gene according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics. The first complete DNA sequence of the repeat expansion in someone with the full mutation was generated by scientists in 2012 using SMRT sequencing. This is an example of a Trinucleotide repeat disorder. Trinucleotide repeat expansion is likely a consequence of strand slippage either during DNA repair or DNA replication. FMR1 is a chromatin-binding protein that functions in the DNA damage response. FMR1 occupies sites on meiotic chromosomes and regulates the dynamics of the DNA damage response machinery during spermatogenesis. The FMR1 gene can be found on the long (q) arm of the X chromosome at position 27.3, from base pair 146,699,054 to base pair 146,738,156  Related conditions  = Fragile X syndrome = Almost all cases of fragile X syndrome are caused by expansion of the CGG trinucleotide repeat in the FMR1 gene. In these cases, CGG is abnormally repeated from 200 to more than 1,000 times. As a result, this part of the FMR1 gene is methylated, which silences the gene (it is turned off and does not make any protein). Without adequate FMR1, severe learning disabilities or intellectual disabilities can develop, along with physical abnormalities seen in fragile X syndrome. Fewer than 1% of all cases of fragile X syndrome are caused by mutations that delete part or all of the FMR1 gene, or change a base pair, leading to a change in one of the amino acids in the gene. These mutations disrupt the 3-dimensional shape of FMRP or prevent the protein from being synthesized, leading to the signs and symptoms of fragile X syndrome. A CGG sequence in the FMR1 gene that is repeated between 55 and 200 times is described as a premutation. Although most individuals with the premutation are intellectually normal, some of these individuals have mild versions of the physical features seen in fragile X syndrome (such as prominent ears) and may experience mental health problems such as anxiety or depression. = Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome = Premutations are associated with an increased risk of fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). FXTAS is characterized by ataxia (loss of coordination), tremor, memory loss, loss of sensation in the lower extremities (peripheral neuropathy) and mental and behavioral changes. The disorder usually develops late in life. = Premature ovarian aging = The FMR1 gene plays a very important role in ovarian function, independent from cognitive/neurological effects. Minor expansions of CGG repeats that do not cause fragile X syndrome are associated with an increased risk for premature ovarian aging, also called occult primary ovarian insufficiency, a condition in which women prematurely deplete their ovarian function. = Polycystic ovarian syndrome = A very specific sub-genotype of FMR1 has been found to be associated with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). The gene expression, called heterozygous-normal/low may cause PCOS-like excessive follicle activity and hyperactive ovarian function when women are younger.

It first aired in the NBC Saturday morning lineup on November 10, 1973, and was written by Stephen KandelThis story was expanded into a novelette by science-fiction author Alan Dean Foster as part of the collection Star Trek Log Three (1975) (). who wrote the previous \\"Mudd\\" episode, The Original Seriess \\"I, Mudd\\", as well as the teleplay for Gene Roddenberry's first \\"Mudd\\" episode, \\"Mudd's Women\\". In this episode, the Enterprise brings aboard con-artist Harry Mudd who spreads a fast-acting love potion on the ship. The story features actor Roger C. Carmel voicing an uncredited reprise of his live-action role as Harry Mudd. Plot The starship Enterprise receives orders to arrest Federation outlaw Harry Mudd, who is accused of selling fake love-crystals. Intercepting Mudd on the mining colony of Motherlode, they bring him aboard the Enterprise. Mudd explains that he escaped the custody of the android planetAn otherwise unpopulated planet where Kirk had arranged for Mudd to be \\"paroled\\" at the end of The Original Series episode \\"I, Mudd\\". by stealing a ship. After convincing Nurse Chapel to use a love-crystal to win the affection of the Vulcan Science Officer, Mr. Spock, Mudd abducts her, steals a shuttlecraft, and escapes to a rocky planet. During the battle between Mudd and Chapel, some of his love- crystals are broken near an air-vent. The love-crystal affects Spock, making him insist on pursuing Mudd to the planet, accompanied by Captain Kirk. The broken love-crystals affect the entire crew of the Enterprise. As Mudd told them, the love-crystals are heterosexual in nature, inducing feelings of love in those of opposite sex and friendship in those of the same sex. Kirk and Spock find Chapel and Mudd, but the four of them are attacked by creatures made of rock which inhabit the planet. Moreover, a new phase of the love- crystals' influence causes them to bicker with each other, while the ship's crew are too intoxicated by the love-crystals to beam them back up. To buy time, Kirk throws the remaining love-crystals to the rock creatures. The four are beamed back to the Enterprise, where Spock notes that the love-crystals' short duration and after-effect of enmity make them of little value, and Chapel records a confession of Mudd's misdeeds since his escape from the android planet so that he can be returned to rehabilitation.  Reception  Altman and Gross's 1998 book, TrekNavigator: The Ultimate review guide to the entire Trek saga, praised Roger Carmel's performance and the episode's \\"sophisticated wit and humor\\", and deemed it a high point for the Star Trek animated series. They reasoned that other episodes in the animated series were merely rehashes of Star Treks live-action elements, while \\"Mudd's Passion\\" expanded on the live-action series with new themes.Mark A. Altman & Ed Gross, \\"TrekNavigator: The Ultimate review guide to the entire Trek saga\\", BackBay Books, 1998. p.150 A 2018 Star Trek binge-watching guide by Den of Geek, recommended this episode for featuring the trio of characters Kirk, Spock, and Bones of The Original Series.

It first aired in the NBC Saturday morning lineup on November 17, 1973, and was written by American screenwriter Paul SchneiderThis story was expanded into a novelette by science-fiction author Alan Dean Foster as part of the collection, Star Trek Log Four (1975) (). who had previously written the Original Series episodes \\"Balance of Terror\\" and \\"The Squire of Gothos\\". It came from a one- paragraph story idea by Gene Roddenberry based on Gulliver's Travels. In this episode, after an apparent attack, the crew of the Enterprise find themselves beginning to shrink in size toward the point that they will no longer be able to control the ship. Plot While observing a burnt-out supernova, the Federation starship Enterprise picks up a strange message transmitted in a two-hundred-year-old Earth code. The signal is traced to a nearby planet. When the Enterprise enters orbit, it is hit by an energy beam of \\"spiroid radiation\\" that damages its dilithium crystals and makes the crew begin to shrink (along with all other organic material aboard the ship, including the crew's uniforms). Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy determines that the crew will continue to shrink beyond their ability to control the ship unless a cure is found. Captain Kirk beams down to the surface and finds that the transporter can revert crew members to their original size. He also observes what appears to be a miniature city. Kirk returns to the ship, but the crew are now too small for him to see easily, and too small to operate the ship's controls. Meanwhile, the Terratins have beamed the bridge crew down to their city, where the crew learns the Terratins' fate. Terratin is a lost Earth colony, originally called \\"Terra Ten\\"; its inhabitants have mutated because of the supernova's radiation, and are now all approximately one-sixteenth of an inch in height. The beam which caused the crew to shrink was not intended as an attack, but was the only way the Terratins had to draw attention to themselves. The crew are beamed back to the ship and return to normal size. However, the Terratins have been small for generations and cannot be restored to normal size. Their planet is in peril from massive volcanic activity, so the whole Terratin city is beamed aboard the Enterprise, and moved to another planet.  Reception  This episode was noted as case where the fictional Star Trek transporter technology changes the size of the entity being transported, along with \\"The Counter Clock Incident\\" from the same TV series. The episode is noted for harnessing the flexibility of the animated format, by having the bridge crew of the Enterprise shrink.

It first aired on NBC on September 7, 1974. It was directed by Bill Reed, and written by Howard Weinstein. The episode was Weinstein's first professional sale at the age of 19, making him, as of 2018, the youngest writer of any Star Trek TV episode. Set in the 23rd century, the series follows the adventures of Captain James T. Kirk (voiced by William Shatner) and the crew of the Starfleet starship Enterprise. In this episode, Kirk and the Enterprise must contend with pirates who have stolen a load of cargo that includes medicine crucial to save a dying Spock (voiced by Leonard Nimoy). The story was developed from Weinstein out of a Star Trek-based short story he had previously published in a school science fiction publication. After it failed to be read on the first submission, it was resubmitted and purchased by the production team. The episode featured the first appearance of male members of the Orion species in the Star Trek franchise; male Orions would not appear in a live action episode until 2004. Critical reception to the episode was mixed, and it has been released in several forms of home media, including VHS, LaserDisc and DVD. Plot On stardate 6334.1, the Federation starship Enterprise is on its way to planet Deneb V when the Vulcan First Officer, Spock (voiced by Leonard Nimoy), contracts the disease choriocytosis and is diagnosed by Chief Medical Officer Leonard McCoy (voiced by DeForest Kelley) with having only days to live. The Starfleet freighter SS Huron is to rendezvous with the Enterprise and deliver medicine direly needed for the cure, when it is attacked by Orion pirates who steal its cargo, which turns out to be primarily a sizable load of dilithium crystals. The Enterprise follows back on the rendezvous course and finds the battered Huron and its surviving crew. Analysis of the attack leads Captain Kirk (voiced by William Shatner) and his crew to chase the Orion ship in a desperate attempt to recover the cure before time runs out. The Orions, knowing they cannot escape the Enterprise or best them in a fight, plan to destroy both themselves and the Enterprise in order to protect the lie of \\"Orion neutrality\\". Kirk meets with the Orion Captain (voiced by James Doohan) on a highly unstable asteroid which the Orions plan to detonate to carry out their plot. Kirk and the Enterprise crew realize the Orion Captain is carrying an explosive trigger in his pack and are able to neutralize it. They recover the medicine to save Spock, capture the Orion Captain (who orders his crew to abort the self- destruct, which would now be a pointless loss of life, and surrender) and retrieve the dilithium crystals. Production Writer Howard Weinstein had been a fan of space exploration following the flight of NASA astronaut Alan Shepard on Mercury-Redstone 3.Ayers (2006): p. 38 He recalled that his first experience of Star Trek was in middle school, where he mixed elements of the show up with Lost in Space. He began watching the show and was inspired to write for television after reading The Making of Star Trek by Gene Roddenberry and Stephen E. Whitfield. While in the 11th grade, he had a Star Trek short story published in the fanzine Probe, which was a yearly publication in East Meadow High School. Weinstein also wrote a script for Mission: Impossible, but the script was turned down as it was not submitted via an agent. It was returned with a list of suggested agents, and his father recognised Bill Cooper's name on the list from their school years together.Ayers (2006): p. 39 Cooper agreed to take on Weinstein, who decided to redevelop his Probe published short story into a script for the animated Star Trek. Cooper addressed the script to D.C. Fontana, who had recently left the show. When it arrived at the production office, it was forwarded to Fontana unread, who sent it back to Cooper as she had left the show. The script was subsequently resubmitted by Weinstein under his agent's name for the second season of the show. Producer Lou Scheimer contacted Weinstein and informed him that they wanted to purchase the script if the ending could be modified, which Weinstein agreed to.Ayers (2006): p. 40 Weinstein was 19 at the time and staying in the dormitory at the University of Connecticut, and Scheimer was surprised to find out that Weinstein was so young. The script sold in April 1974. It was Weinstein's first professional sale and credit as a writer. He found out later that year that it would be used as the opening episode of the second season. Weinstein organized a get together in his dormitory to watch the episode when it aired, which some thirty people and a dog attended. After the script was used, Weinstein found that it enabled him to write the Star Trek novel The Covenant of the Crown for Pocket Books; he said in a later interview that it gave him \\"instant credibility\\" with the company. He also began to appear at science fiction conventions and later wrote several further Star Trek books and comic books. Weinstein received a \\"Thank You\\" credit on Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home after introducing that film's director, Leonard Nimoy, to the idea of including whales in the film. This episode features the first appearance of male Orions. While a surgically altered agent who appeared as an Andorian in The Original Series episode \\"Journey to Babel\\" was speculated to be of Orion origin by Spock, the only members of the race which had previously been represented in Star Trek were the Orion slave girls. Male Orions would not be seen in a live action Star Trek production until 2004 with the episode \\"Borderland\\" in the fourth season of Star Trek: Enterprise. Reception and home media release \\"The Pirates of Orion\\" was first broadcast on September 7, 1974 on NBC. In Trek Navigator, a book by Mark A. Altman and Edward Gross which reviewed every episode and film of Star Trek up until 1998, Altman gave \\"The Pirates of Orion\\" a score of two out of four, while Gross gave a score of three out of four.Altman & Gross (1998): p. 177 Michelle Erica Green watched the episode for the website TrekNation, saying that it included \\"precisely the sort of character interaction that made the original Star Trek such a success\\". She felt that given the ability of The Animated Series to show things that couldn't be seen in The Original Series due to the budget restrictions, that the appearance of the Orions could have been increased and if the attack on the Huron had been shown then it would have given \\"a stronger opinion as viewers of the relative evils of the Orions, whether they are an honorable enemy or mere vicious thugs.\\" A 2018 Star Trek binge-watching guide by Den of Geek, recommended this episode for featuring the trio of characters Kirk, Spock, and Bones of The Original Series. \\"The Pirates of Orion\\" was released on VHS cassette alongside \\"The Practical Joker\\" during the initial release of tapes by Paramount Home Video in 1989.Kelley (2008): p. 250Gibberman (1991): p. 396 It has also been released on LaserDisc as part of the series set.

The \\"Rec Room\\" in this episode is the forerunner of the Holodeck, which plays a significant part in numerous episodes of the subsequent spin-off Star Trek series. Set in the 23rd century, the series follows the adventures of Captain James T. Kirk (voiced by William Shatner) and the crew of the Starfleet starship Enterprise. In this episode, after the Enterprise passes through an unusual cloud the ship's computer starts playing practical jokes on the crew. Plot On stardate 3183.3, the Federation starship Enterprise is attacked by three Romulan D-7-class battlecruisers. Captain Kirk orders the ship into a nearby gaseous energy field to hide, knowing that the Romulans would be unwilling to follow in after them. Sometime later, the crew begin to suffer a series of practical jokes, beginning with glasses leaking and utensils turning to rubber, a uniform tunic for the captain with \\"Kirk is a Jerk\\" emblazoned on the back, and a mysterious optical device on the bridge science station which when looked into leaves blackened circles around Science Officer Spock's eyes. Everyone expects that there is a member of the crew having fun. The jokes become more serious, however, as corridor decks are found covered with ice under a concealing layer of fog. Still thinking that a crewmember is responsible, Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy, Lt. Uhura, and Lt. Sulu hope to escape the jokester by hiding out in the ship's Holodeck/Rec Room. No escape is to be found as a quiet stroll in a woodland scene becomes dangerous with the program parameters changing to include a deep pit covered over by branches and leaves, and later a freezing cold blinding snow storm then a hedge maze before they are finally rescued. Eventually the practical jokester, which has turned out to be the Enterprise computer itself (affected by the ship's passage through the energy field), decides to play a practical joke on the Romulans for the battle damage caused in the earlier attack. It fabricates a gigantic ship-shaped balloon beside the Enterprise that the Romulans are drawn to attack. The Romulans, infuriated over the embarrassment of being tricked, give chase. Kirk immediately shows extreme fear at the prospect of returning to the cloud to escape the Romulans, and the Enterprise presses into Kirk's fear by taking the ship back in. The jokester personality of the computer begins to fade, as it realizes it had been tricked itself, and finally returns to normal. The Romulans, however, were so enraged over the balloon-ship ruse that they follow the Enterprise in this time and begin to experience a rash of jokes themselves.  Reception  In 2016, SyFy noted this episode for presenting \\"the beginnings of the holodeck\\", a technological idea that later became a popular element in many later episodes. In this episode the characters use what they call the rec room which features holographic images.

Founded on September 8, 1981, the Etobicoke School of the Arts has the distinction of being the oldest, free standing, arts-focused high school in Canada. Overview ESA is part of the Toronto District School Board and accepts students from all over southern Ontario from Grade 9 to 12. The school runs on a two-day schedule with 4 periods a day. Each week is either week A, or week B, and based on which week it is, the 2 afternoon classes are switched in order to ensure a student does not miss the same class every week for rehearsals or appointments. The female-to-male ratio of the school is about 4 to 1. The school has been publicized in Maclean's, The Toronto Star and in a national newspaper, The Globe and Mail. As well, in the September 2006 issue of the Toronto arts magazine Toronto Life, ESA was named Toronto's best arts high school and is also widely known as the best arts high school in Canada.Balkissoon, Denise. \\"The Best Schools. Best for Arts: Etobicoke School of the Arts.\\" Toronto Life September 2006: 55. The school was the feature of CTV's Canada AM in September 2006. History By the late 1970s The Etobicoke Board of Education had gone through the process of closing over thirty schools because of a dramatic decline in enrolment, which dropped from 65,000 to fewer than 35,000 pupils. In spite of this, the senior staff felt compelled to resume innovative programs that had characterized the Board during the 1960s and 1970s. One idea had been talked about in the program department was a school for artistic students. In the fall of 1979, the board visited the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts in New York City. They came away convinced that a successful arts school would have to have an exclusive program, that is, a program that would function on its own, without sharing space within an existing secondary school. To ensure that the right students enrolled, they also agreed that admission would be subject to an audition. The school was opened on September 8, 1981 at a closed Queensway Senior School.http://kmkl.hstr.me/esa/about/#../images/gallery/17577_427434380396_693045396_10549558_3379400_n.jpg In September 1983 ESA moved to its current home in the building of Royal York Collegiate Institute which had been closed in June 1982. The school gained a strong reputation over the next decade as one of Toronto's best secondary schools. Students began to apply from all over the Greater Toronto Area and southern Ontario. Application and Audition Process Students are accepted into their chosen field, namely Drama, Dance, Contemporary Art, Music (Band or Strings), Film and Musical Theatre, after undergoing an application process and passing an audition the year before. They must submit their grade seven, last term report card and grade eight, first term report card. They must also submit a filled-out form indicating their preference of arts major(s) and minor, their preference of academic subjects (academic, applied or locally developed) and their past instruction in their area(s) of interest. As part of the audition process, they must write an essay on a suggested topic (known only on the day of the audition and written on location) and undergo an interview with some distinguished individuals from the school (graduates, instructors, etc.) in their area of interest. Each year approximately 1000 students are auditioned and 200 students are accepted, primarily at the grade 9 level, however, some students may be accepted at higher grade levels should places become available. The arts ESA offers artistic programs for students who successfully complete the audition process in the major of their choice, namely Drama, Dance, Contemporary Art, Film, Music (Band or Strings), and Musical Theatre. At ESA students have the chance to work with an experienced arts faculty as well as numerous professional \\"visiting artists\\". =Drama= Mainstage, the departments headliner production presented each year in the Nancy Main Theatre, has been held since the school opened in 1981. The department participates in many competitions such as the Sears Ontario Drama Festival where it has won many awards in its history. The curriculum of the Drama Department is broken up into four years, each year building on the last. With the culmination of this work, students produce their Drama Showcases, performed through the final months of the school year. In September 2012 a new acting for the camera program was added at the grade 11 and 12 level; this elective program is open to all students regardless of their major. =Contemporary art= The Contemporary Art Department is responsible for the teaching of contemporary arts and contemporary photography practice at ESA. In 1981 the department began with two teachers and a handful of students. The department has created several murals and pieces on commission. Some of the murals have included those for Norseman Public School, Humber Valley Village School, Future Bakery, Toronto City Hall, the Daily Bread Foodbank and Woodbine Race Track. As well as exhibitions at ESA, many off-campus shows have also been held. Notable exhibitions were held at during Nuit Blanche 2009 & 2016, Saatchi Gallery, Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Harbourfront, Praxis, Clint Roenisch Gallery, Gallery 44, Whippersnapper Gallery, and Artscape Youngplace. In 2016, Matthew Varey, head of the Contemporary Art department, won the Canadian Art Teacher of the Year award from the Canadian Society for Education through Art. ESA students also broke a record, winning 53% of all international Scholastic Arts & Writing Awards. =Music= The Music Department is divided into two streams: Strings and Band. The head of Strings is Mrs. Betteger while the head of Band is Mr. Freeman. In addition to the student's choice of study, all Grade 9 and 10 students must take Theory, or Rudiments. Grade 12 students have the option of taking Orchestration, and grade 11 and 12 students have the option of taking Repertoire instead of Theory. In Grade 9 and 10, students begin to perfect their skills, both as individual performers and ensemble players in groups. Technique work is focused on, as well as overall ability. In theory, the focus is on basic theory work (taken from the RCM Elementary and Grade 1 Rudiments both as individual performers, and ensemble players in groups. Technique work is focused on, as well as overall ability. In theory, the focus is on basic theory work (taken from the RCM Elementary and Grade 1 Rudiments Curriculum), as well as the History of Music. Through help from their theory and instrumental teacher, students focus on personal improvement, both in their practical classes and in theory work. In Grades 11 and 12, students move towards perfecting a personal playing style, as well as focusing on their technique. In theory, Grade 11 completes the History of Music, and broadens theory skills to proficiency in fields such as composition, harmonization, and listening skills. Grade 12 students take the Orchestration course, which focuses on abilities pertaining to writing, transposing and organizing music, as well as a History component. The culmination of a music student's career at ESA is their Grade 12 recital. Alone, or in groups of 2-3 members, students are responsible for mounting a full musical recital, including rehearsals, staging, lighting, and publicity. =Dance= The dance department teaches ballet, modern and jazz techniques. Students work with experienced teachers and choreographers, as well as a wide variety of guest artists. The programme focuses on building dance & performance skills while also learning about composition, anatomy, dance conditioning and somatic practices, and history. The department runs two extracurricular dance companies. 'DancESAtion' is a modern dance company directed by department staff. In the past, this company has performed in many professional settings, including with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. 'Refresh' is a student run hip hop crew that performs at a variety of shows throughout the year. All dance students have multiple performance opportunities each year. In the fall, students an opportunity to present their own original choreography at the annual Choreographic Workshop. The show is made up of student work, class pieces, work from 'DancESAtion' and 'Refresh', choreography by staff and guest artists. In the spring, the dance department puts on a year-end show called Dance Night, involving all dance majors and company members. =Musical Theatre= The Music Theatre program offers students an opportunity to study three disciplines in one major. Throughout their four years in the program they are trained in vocal music, dance, and drama. as their requirement for this program. Aside from these requirements music theatre students also learn music theory as one of their compulsory courses. =Film= Film is the school's newest major and was founded in the 2008-2009 school year. The film program explores the study of cinematography, film production, handling film equipment, writing, etcetera. Throughout the year film has several different showcases such as the 60 second film festival in December and the Summer film festival in June amongst several others that are open to all of the students participating in the major. In its first year alone the film program received much attention, not only from Canada, but from around the world. Many students of the film program have participated and received awards and recognition in various film festivals worldwide. Additionally the Film Program has worked to build links with the outside film community. The department has built a relationship with Shaftesbury Films who have given them access to their experts in the field. Over the last two years the film program has also had the opportunity to speak with individuals such as Nancy Beiman, Peter Raymont, and most recently Laurent Cantet. Performances Every year, the school puts on a variety of shows and performances that vary each year. The shows demonstrate each of the five majors, and the students, and display them in a way that benefits each. The Drama Department puts on a yearly production known as \\"Mainstage\\". The Dance Department produce \\"Dance Night\\" in which all the dance students perform, most notably ESA's dance company \\"DancESAtion\\". The department also produces two choreographic workshops of staff and student pieces which perform in the fall and spring. The Contemporary Art Department hosts an annual art show which student artwork is showcased and sold, which is also its largest fundraiser. They also produce \\"Portfolio Day\\", one of the largest international high school art events, where students meet with visiting post- secondary institutions. The Music and Musical Theatre Departments conduct three performances each year: the December holiday concert, \\"Festive Celebration\\", a spring music showcase \\"Opus\\", and the culminating production of the annual Musical. During the year, a concerts called \\"Solstice\\" are put on. Solstice is a school concert near the end of the year strictly for the students enjoyment. These concerts usually include \\"rock\\" styled bands which play a variety of music from rock and roll, indie, ska, jazz, blues, fusion and many others. Previously, a similar music event \\"Goatstock\\" was held. Goatstock served as a fundraiser for World Vision Academics Most standard Ontario curriculum courses are offered, including classes in the social sciences, science, math, languages and physical education. A very high number of students exceed provincial levels in standardised tests, including both the Grade 10 Literacy Test and the Grade 9 EQAO math test which are nationally recognised benchmarks set by the EQAO. Extracurricular For many years the music department has participated in and won numerous awards at the Kiwanis Music Festival. In 2007, ESA's photography students participated in Gallery 44's exhibition Cameralinks 2007 - URBAN. Since 2013, ESA Photography students have participated in the Magenta Foundation's Flash Forward Incubator Program. Facilities The Nancy Main Auditorium. ESA, being housed in the former Royal York C.I. building, is equipped for both arts and academic programs. In addition to classroom facilities for the academic subjects, ESA has many spaces especially designed for the study of the arts. The Drama Department has four rooms which are used for classes and rehearsal space, as well as a 40-seat Thrust-style studio theatre. Visual Arts has a printmaking studio, a photography room and three studios for drawing, painting and sculpture as well as wall space for exhibitions. Two large, dance studios with bars and mirrored walls serve the Dance Department. The Music and Musical Theatre Departments share spaces that include a listening lab, an electronic piano lab, small practice rooms and three separate rooms for vocal, string and wind instruction. The film department has a wide variety of equipment and is currently developing green screening rooms. ESA's Nancy Main Auditorium, which is named after the founding principal, is a 571-seat proscenium arch style theatre that serves as the primary performing venue. The Nancy Main is updated regularly and provides students with performing opportunities and the chance to learn about technical production. ESA has on staff a professional theatre technician who oversees all productions at the school. The original building built for Royal York Collegiate Institute was designed by architect, Gordon Adamson, whose instrumental in designing post-war modern high schools in Etobicoke. Criticism In June 2015, ESA student and graduate Alexi Halket was sent to the principal's office following an incident when she wore a black crop top that resembled a bra. In outrage, students across 25 TDSB schools including ESA and universities staged a protest in solidarity.https://www.thestar.com/yourtoronto/education/2015/05/26/toronto- students-organize-crop-top-day-to-protest-dress-codes.html Former school principal Peggy Aitchison, was transferred to another TDSB school in 2018, following allegations of racial profiling after many students and parents became outraged after seeing the list ‚Äî which many now call the \\"black list\\" ‚Äî that Aitchison used the school's yearbook to identify black students.https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/etobicoke-school-black- list-1.4724307 Notable alumni See also *List of high schools in Ontario References External links *Etobicoke School of the Arts *TDSB Profile Education in Etobicoke Schools in the TDSB High schools in Toronto Art schools in Canada Educational institutions established in 1981 1981 establishments in Ontario Relocated schools ","title":"Etobicoke School of the Arts"},{"id":"3514745","text":"'Gallium phosphide ('), a phosphide of gallium, is a compound semiconductor material with an indirect band gap of 2.24eV at room temperature.

Jiaogulan has recently been incorporated into traditional medicine, although there is no evidence-based medicine that demonstrates any effects on human health. Description Among many common names are five-leaf ginseng, poor man's ginseng, miracle grass, fairy herb, sweet tea vine, gospel herb, and southern ginseng. Jiaogulan belongs to the genus Gynostemma, in the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers, gourds, and melons. Its fruit is a small purple inedible gourd. It is a climbing vine, attaching itself to supports using tendrils. The serrated leaflets commonly grow in groups of five (as in G. pentaphyllum) although some species can have groups of three or seven leaflets. The plant is dioecious, meaning each plant exists either as male or female. Therefore, if seeds are desired, both a male and female plant must be grown. Taxonomy Gynostemma pentaphyllum is known as Jiaogulan ( in China. The plant was first described in 1406 CE by Zhu Xiao, who presented a description and sketch in the book Materia Medica for Famine as a survival food rather than a medicinal herb. The earliest record of jiaogulan's use as a drug comes from herbalist Li Shizhen's book Compendium of Materia Medica published in 1578, identifying jiaogulan for treating various ailments such as hematuria, edema in the pharynx and neck, tumors, and trauma. While Li Shizhen had confused jiaogulan with an analogous herb Wulianmei, in 1848 Wu Qi-Jun rectified this confusion in Textual Investigation of Herbal Plants. Modern recognition of the plant outside of China originated from research in sugar substitutes. In the 1970s, while analyzing the sweet component of the jiaogulan plant (known as amachazuru in Japan), Masahiro Nagai discovered saponins identical to those in Panax ginseng. Continued research has described several more saponins (gypenosides) comparable or identical to those found in ginseng. Panax ginseng contains ginsenosides while gypenoside saponins have been found in jiaogulan. Distribution and habitat G. pentaphyllum is one of about 17 species in the genus Gynostemma, including nine species endemic to China. However, G. pentaphyllum has a wide distribution outside of China, ranging from India and Bangladesh to Southeast Asia to Japan and Korea as well as to New Guinea. In China, it grows in forests, thickets, and roadsides on mountain slopes at elevations of above sea level. Jiaogulan is a vine hardy to USDA zone 8 in which it may grow as a short lived perennial plant. It can be grown as an annual in most temperate climates, in well-drained soil with full sun. It does not grow well in cold climates with temperatures below freezing. Chemistry and toxicity Constituents of G. pentaphyllum include sterols, saponin, flavonoids, and chlorophyll. Gypenosides have been extracted from its leaves. Some saponin compounds are the same as those found in ginseng roots. While there have been in vitro studies on toxicity, there have been no clinical trials, therefore no information is available about human toxicity. Uses The plant is used in folk medicine, typically as an herbal tea, but may be used as an alcohol extract or in dietary supplements. It has not seen widespread use in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), being adopted only in the past 20 years, because it grows far from central China where TCM evolved; consequently, it was not included in the standard pharmacopoeia of the TCM system. Before then, it was a locally-known herb used primarily in mountainous regions of southern China and in northern Vietnam. It is described by the local inhabitants as the \\"immortality herb\\", because a large number of elderly people within Guizhou Province reported consuming the plant regularly. In the European Union, jiaogulan is considered a novel food following a 2012 court ruling that prohibited its sale as food. Research Some limited research has assessed the potential for jiaogulan to affect such disorders as cardiovascular diseases, hyperlipidemia, or type 2 diabetes, but these studies were too preliminary to allow any conclusion that it was beneficial.

There are variations on the diet, although it generally consists of eating one grapefruit at each meal, along with meat, eggs, other foods that are rich in fat and protein, and certain vegetables. Sugar, fruits (other than grapefruit), sweet vegetables, grains and starchy vegetables are to be avoided. The grapefruit diet is thus a low-carbohydrate diet. A typical breakfast menu usually includes bacon and eggs. The diet is based on the claim that grapefruit has a fat-burning enzyme or similar property. The grapefruit diet does not require exercise. The grapefruit diet lasts for 10 to 12 days followed by 2 days off. History The grapefruit diet originated in the 1930s. It was originally known in 1929 as the \\"eighteen-day diet\\", and featured 18 days of grapefruit, orange, toast, vegetable and egg combinations, totalling approximately 500 calories.Addison, Heather. (2003). Hollywood and the Rise of Physical Culture. Routledge. p. 39. The originator of the diet is not known. One rumour traces the diet to actress Ethel Barrymore, who is alleged to have paid William James Mayo and his brother 500 dollars to create a special diet for her. The diet then became a fad in Hollywood and spread throughout America. The Mayo Clinic has disavowed the grapefruit diet.Buchwald, Henry; Cowan, George S. M; Pories, Walter J. (2007). Surgical Management of Obesity. Elsevier. p. 84. Novelist Fannie Hurst was a notable devotee of the diet.\\"Fellows Find: Fannie Hurst and Diets\\". Ransom Center Magazine. Retrieved 4 January, 2020. It was re- popularized in the 1980s and nicknamed the \\"10-day, 10-pounds-off diet\\". The idea that grapefruit eaten before a meal acts as a \\"catalyst\\" to burn body fat has no evidence from biochemistry. Health risks The diet was criticized as early as 1935.Malmberg, Carl. (1935). Diet and Die. Hillman-Curl, Inc. pp. 99-100 Carl Malmberg commented that it lacks in all the necessary minerals (calcium, phosphorus and iron) and in vitamin A. He noted that many people became ill on the diet and \\"casualties\\" were heavy around Hollywood. In 1936, Lewis Wolberg described the diet as \\"nonsensical, irrational and even dangerous\\".Wolberg, Lewis. (1936). The Psychology of Eating. New York: R. M. McBride & Company. p. 128 The variations of the grapefruit diet that are too low in calories (below 800‚Äì1,000 calories a day), too low in carbohydrates, or too low in essential micronutrients are considered unhealthy and potentially dangerous. While eating half a grapefruit with every meal may be a good way to incorporate more fruit in the diet of a healthy person, grapefruit and grapefruit juice is harmful if the dieter is allergic to citrus, or is taking medicines that can interact with grapefruit juice. This diet will not be beneficial to anyone when followed long-term, as the extremely low calorie intake could lead to malnutrition and many health problems.

This episode was the sixth and final episode of the second season. It first aired in the NBC Saturday morning lineup on October 12, 1974, and was written by Fred Bronson under the pen name \\"John Culver\\". Bronson used a pen name because he was NBC's publicist at the time and was concerned that it would look improper to get a screen credit. Bronson would eventually work on two Next Generation episodes (\\"M√©nage √† Troi\\" and \\"The Game\\"). The episode established that the Enterprises first captain was Robert April. Set in the 23rd century, the series follows the adventures of Captain James T. Kirk (voiced by William Shatner) and the crew of the Starfleet starship Enterprise. In this episode, the Enterprise is unwillingly pulled by a smaller craft into the heart of a supernova and finds itself in another universe. Plot On stardate 6770.3, the Federation starship Enterprise is transporting very distinguished guests: its first commander, Commodore Robert April (voiced by James Doohan), and his wife, Sarah (voiced by Nichelle Nichols), the first medical officer on the starship equipped with warp drive, who had designed many of the tools in Dr. McCoy's sick bay. Their destination is a diplomatic conference on the planet Babel and his planned retirement ceremony, when it encounters a ship flying at fantastic speeds directly into a supernova. The Enterprise attempts to assist by grabbing the vessel with a tractor beam and locking onto it, but instead both ships are pulled through the supernova and into a negative universe where time flows backwards and \\"everything works in a counterclockwise fashion.\\" Consequently, everyone aboard the ship begins to grow younger. The young woman piloting the ship, Karla Five (also voiced by Nichols), takes them to her homeworld, Arret (Terra, backwards), and seeks the help of her son, a much older man named Karl Four (also voiced by Doohan). In a race against time for the increasingly de-aging Enterprise crew, they work out a solution for getting back home. With Captain Kirk and his crew members reduced to children, \\"April, now a thirty-year-old man, retakes command and must bring the Enterprise to safety before it's too late.\\" The attempt to get back home is successful, and then he and his wife, Sarah, use the transporter to restore themselves and the rest of the crew to their proper ages. Casting Actress Majel Barrett, who commonly voiced Nurse Christine Chapel, Communications Officer M'Ress and the Enterprise computer, was given screen credit for this episode but was not part of it. Novelization Science fiction author Alan Dean Foster expanded this story under the title Star Trek Log Seven, making it the first third of a full novel. He prefaced the animated story with scenes depicting a young Starfleet officer named Robert April being shown Matt Jefferies' original blueprints for a then-uncompleted Enterprise and being told he was to be given command of the new ship, then following through to the christening of the Enterprise and Captain April giving the order to embark on their first mission. At the conclusion of the material from the animated episode, Foster adds new story about the Enterprise being sent on a mission to secure a reclusive brother-sister team of scientists who are reported to have a new weapon capable of destroying planets. In the process, Kirk runs up against Klingons intent on acquiring the scientists for the Empire and must contend with Captain Kumara, whom he had known back in his Academy days. Foster concluded his story by revealing that the Enterprises adventure with the Klingons had been a test by an advanced alien race calling themselves \\"The Wanderers\\". In fact, all of the inhabitants of the planet on which they had found themselves as well as the brother-sister scientists were actually members of the Wanderers. During this revelation, they discuss the illogical nature of the other universe where a society would begin with all possible knowledge that they would ever have and then de-evolve, or how a person would be \\"born\\" as a senile old person in a grave and then die in their mother's womb. Reception Mark A. Altman and Ed Gross commented that the episode's premise \\"works far better than it has a right to, thanks to its message that the elderly have a lot to teach us and can be productive members of society.\\" They added that the script \\"features the same wit and intelligence that characterised the animated missions throughout its two-year run.\\" This episode was noted as case where the fictional Star Trek transporter technology changes the size of the entity being transported, along with \\"The Terratin Incident\\" from the same TV series. TheGamer.com ranked Captain April as the 10th best captain of Star Trek. In 2019, Den of Geek ranked this the 3rd best morality play of the entire Star Trek franchise.

It is a type of glycosyltransferase. The sugar Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 (where Glc=Glucose, Man=Mannose, and GlcNAc=N-acetylglucosamine) is attached to an asparagine (Asn) residue in the sequence Asn-X-Ser or Asn-X-Thr where X is any amino acid except proline. This sequence is called a glycosylation sequon. The reaction catalyzed by OST is the central step in the N-linked glycosylation pathway. Location ER Translocon complex. Many protein complexes are involved in protein synthesis. The actual production takes place in the ribosomes (grey and light blue). Through the ER translocon (green: Sec61, blue: TRAP complex, and red: oligosaccharyl transferase complex) the newly synthesized protein is transported across the membrane (gray) into the interior of the ER. Sec61 is the protein-conducting channel and the OST adds sugar moieties to the nascent protein. OST is a component of the translocon in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. A lipid-linked core-oligosaccharide is assembled at the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum and transferred to selected asparagine residues of nascent polypeptide chains by the oligosaccharyl transferase complex. The active site of OST is located about 4 nm from the lumenal face of the ER membrane. It usually acts during translation as the nascent protein is entering the ER, but this cotranslational glycosylation is nevertheless called a posttranslational modification. A few examples have been found of OST activity after translation is complete. Current opinion is that post- translational activity may occur if the protein is poorly folded or folds slowly. Structure and function Yeast OST is composed of eight different membrane-spanning proteins in three subcomplexes (one of them is OST4). These octomers do not form higher order oligomers, and three of the eight proteins are glycosylated themselves. OST in mammals is known to have a similar composition. OST is thought to require many subunits because it must: #Position itself near the translocon pore. #Recognize and bind oligosaccharyldolichol. #Scan the nascent protein in order to recognize and bind sequons. #Move these two large substrates into their proper locations and conformations. #Activate the Asn amide nitrogen atom for the actual transfer of oligosaccharide. #Release its substrates. The catalytically active subunit of the OST is called STT3. Two paralogs exist in eukaryotes, termed STT3A and STT3B. STT3A is primarily responsible for cotranslational glycosylation of the nascent polypeptide as it enters the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum whereas STT3B can also mediate posttranslational glycosylation. The structure of PglB, the prokaryotic homolog of STT3 has been solved. The high sequence similarity between the prokaryotic and the eukaryotic STT3 suggests that their structures are similar.  Clinical significance  CDG syndromes are genetic disorders of the glycosylation pathway.

It lies perched on a cliff in the Loma de √öbeda, the range separating the Guadalquivir River to its south from the Guadalimar to its north. It is now principally famed for having some of the best-preserved examples of Italian Renaissance architecture in Spain. Along with √öbeda, it was added to UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites in 2003. The former Visigothic bishopric of Baeza remains a Latin Catholic titular see.  History  The town stands at a high elevation about from the right bank of the Guadalquivir in the Loma de √öbeda. Under the Romans, the town was known as Beatia. Following its conquest by the Visigoths, Beatia was the seat of a bishopric of Baeza (viz.). From the beginning of the VII century it was conquered by several Arab and berber states during the Al-Andalus period, being named Bayyasa. The Christian diocese was reestablished in 1127 or 1147 following the town's conquest by Alfonso VII of Castile, but it was then still reconquered by the Almohads. After the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa, Ferdinand III of Castile in 1227 takes the city and gives it the Fuero de Cuenca, a legislative corpus to facilitate the new castilian order and institutions. The diocese of Baeza was merged with Ja√©n in 1248 or 1249, but was later nominally restored as a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church. With it, a University was founded as well, what shaped the cultural personality of the city in the following centuries to come. Also, two powerful families, Benavides and Carvajales, compite for power and determine the historical evolution of the city, situation that required the intervention of Isabel I of Castile at the end of the XV century. The XVI century was the golden era of Baeza (and nearby √öbeda). It grew rich from several industries, notably textile, and the mentioned noble families, well connected with the Spanish Imperial state. They hired major architects of the era (including Andr√©s de Vandelvira) to design the present cathedral, churches, public buildings, and private palaces in the then-fashionable Italian style. The town's university building dates to 1533. The city importance declined in the 17th century, with the only remaining industry consisting of local production of grain and olive oil. As few newer structures were built during this period, this had the effect of preserving the town's Renaissance legacy. The university closed for a time before being reopened by the 19th century as a seminary. In the 1870s, the population was around 11,000; over the next few decades, the Linares‚ÄìAlmeria railway was constructed nearby and town's population grew to 14,000 by 1900.  Landmarks  The roofs of Baeza from church tower Jabalquinto Palace Baeza still houses several fine public buildings: *Natividad de Nuestra Se√±ora Cathedral, presents an early Gothic and Plateresque pilasters and crossed vaults finished in the XVI century in a Renaissance style by renamed architect And≈ïes de Vandelvira, and since 1584 by architect and mathematician Juan Bautista Villalpando.

It first aired in the NBC Saturday morning lineup on October 5, 1974, and was written by Russell Bates and David Wise.This story was expanded into a novelette by science- fiction author Alan Dean Foster as part of the collection, Star Trek Log Six (1976) (). The title comes from Act 1, Scene 4 of William Shakespeare's King Lear: \\"How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child!\\" In this episode, the Enterprise must contend with alien entity that demands it be worshiped as a god. The Animated Series won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Children's Series for this episode. Plot On stardate 6063.4, following a signal from a mysterious probe, the Federation starship Enterprise is immobilized by an alien whose ship resembles a winged serpent. The alien claims to be Kukulkan, god of the ancient Maya and Aztec peoples of Earth. He says that he is actually a very long-lived, benevolent entity who wants the humans to worship him, as the Mayas and Aztecs did. Upon resistance by the crew, he proclaims them \\"thankless\\". Kukulkan transports Captain Kirk, Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy, Chief Engineer Scott and Ensign Walking Bear to his ship. By using technology similar to a holodeck, Kukulkan makes them believe they are standing in the middle of an ancient city. Kukulkan warns them that he will only appear before them once they've solved the riddle of the city. The city combines the architectures of many ancient Earth cultures: Egyptian, Aztec, Chinese, etc. Kirk concludes that Kukulkan had visited many of the peoples on Earth, but each only took a portion of what he taught them. So none of them ever fulfilled the complete instructions to signal his return. By chance, Kirk scales a huge pyramid in the center of the city. There, he concludes that the sun will activate Kukulkan's signalling device. He orders Bones and Scotty to turn huge serpent-headed statues toward the pyramid. In doing so, the now focused sunlight ignites the signalling device. Kukulkan responds, \\"Behold, my design is complete. See me now with your own eyes!\\" Kukulkan does appear and turns out to be an alien winged serpent. The city disappears, only to make the group realize that they were never really there. They now realize that the collection of animals they see before them in small glass \\"cages\\" was exactly how they experienced the city. The animals are unaware of being on Kukulkan's ship, much as the group thought they were actually in an ancient city. Kukulkan demands that the humans worship him, just as the ancients on Earth did. He grows angry when Kirk explains that mankind has \\"grown up\\" and no longer needs to worship him. In the meantime, Science Officer Spock has figured out a way to release the Enterprise from Kukulkan's beam and breaks free. This, too, angers Kukulkan who exclaims that he will \\"smash\\" the Enterprise. To buy Spock some time, Kirk and Bones decide to break loose a Capellan Power Cat from one of Kukulkan's glass cages. The distraction works, as the Enterprise is able to use its phasers to disable Kukulkan's ship. With the Power Cat threatening Kukulkan, Kirk leaps at the animal and is able to sedate it with a hypo. Kirk again attempts to reason with Kukulkan, conceding that while the alien did help humanity when it needed it, they no longer need his guidance. The alien reluctantly agrees, and departs. Production Russel Bates knew the series' story editor, D. C. Fontana, through Star Trek: The Original Series producer Gene L. Coon, whom Bates had apprenticed under. Fontana told Bates about The Animated Series, asking him to try writing something for it. Bates did pitch several stories for the show's first season, but all of them were rejected. Bates met David Wise at the Clarion Science Fiction Writer's Workshop. Wise suggested that after the workshop was over they collaborate to try to sell a story for Star Trek. Bates was a Kiowa, and the story incorporated Native American elements. Reception This episode won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Entertainment Children's Series in 1975. This made it the first Star Trek episode to win an Emmy award.

The event was co-hosted by Gov't Mule/Allman Brothers Band guitarist Warren Haynes and Grace Potter =Performers= The four members of Phish stood onstage together for the first time since Coventry to accept the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 7th Jammy Awards. The surprise reunion followed an emotional speech from longtime Phish photographer (and Relix contributor) Danny Clinch, who stressed the importance of family both on and off the stage throughout the Phish community. All four members of Phish addressed the audience from the stage, beginning with Mike Gordon, who said that he was actually sick in bed until shortly before arriving at the venue. Both Page McConnell and Jon Fishman also delivered quick acceptance speeches, before handing over the microphone to Trey Anastasio, who thanked a number of key members in the Phish organization by name and described his former bandmates as his oldest friends. He also talked at length about the strength and importance of the Phish community, before bowing alongside his bandmates and quietly exiting the stage. Anastasio‚Äôs appearance marked his first public showing outside upstate New York since entering a drug rehabilitation program in early 2007. Phish's emotional speech arrived near the end of the night. Co- hosts Warren Haynes and Grace Potter, who have spent the past few weeks on the road together, opened the evening with a band that consisted of Stax keyboardist Booker T. Jones, bassist Will Lee (Fab Faux, Late Show with David Letterman) and drummer Joe Russo, who recently spent time on the road with Potter along with his Duo partner Marco Benevento. The supergroup ran through a number of classic rock covers, including Crosby, Stills, Nash & Youngs \\"Find the Cost of Freedom\\", Fleetwood Mac's \\"Gold Dust Woman\\" (a staple on Potters tour with Govt Mule) and Al Green's, \\"Take Me to the River.\\" Former New Groove of the Month Rose Hill Drive took the stage next with special guest Matisyahu and his bandmates Aaron Dugan and Rob Marscher (formerly of 2001 Jammy nominees Addison Groove Project). The strange bedfellows ran through a cover of The Flaming Lips' \\"In the Morning of the Magicians\\", before Mountain guitarist Leslie West took the stage with Rose Hill Drive for the evening's loudest offerings. The hard-rock guitarist jammed with Rose Hill Drive and Potter on a version of \\"I'm Going Down\\" that included \\"Close Encounters\\", before offering his signature song, \\"Mississippi Queen\\". Next up, festival favorite Keller Williams took the stage to perform a solo version of his Jammy nominated song \\"Cadillac.\\" He was joined onstage by comedian/actor Chevy Chase, who, unbeknownst to most, played drums with Donald Fagen and Walter Becker in one of their bands that preceded Steely Dan.. On this occasion Chase opted to play piano alongside Williams on a rearranged version of \\"(You Made Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\\" and a medley of \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\" and \\"Take the Money and Run\\" that earned some of the evenings loudest cheers. The pair apparently bonded backstage and when Williams later took top honors in the Song on the Year category, he sent Chase onstage in his place for a humorous speech that included the line, \\"I want to thank Clive Davis just because I feel like I should.\\" As the show went on Tea Leaf Green made its Jammys debut with guest bassist Steve Adams (ALO) and fiddler Allie Kral (New Groove winner Cornmeal) for a rendition of their 2006 Jammy winning number, \\"Taught to be Proud.\\" Big Head Todd's Todd Park Mohr and Squeeze's Glenn Tilbrook also sat in with the expanded group on their songs \\"Pulling Mussels (From The Shell)\\" and \\"Tempted,\\" respectively, the latter of which featured some choice guitar work by Haynes himself. Page McConnell, who was the only member of Phish confirmed to play the Jammys in the weeks leading up to the event, led an all- star jazz combo that included drummer Roy Haynes, saxophonist James Carter, trumpeter and former Anastasio collaborator Nicholas Payton and bassist Christian McBride through two of his three recorded Phish originals: \\"Magilla\\" and \\"Cars Trucks Buses.\\" Then Galactic balanced its jazz/funk past with its hip-hop present, inviting out a slew of guests, including Booker T. Jones, Sharon Jones, Jurassic 5s Chali 2na and MC Doug E. Fresh for songs like \\"Hip Hug-Her,\\" \\"Born Under A Bad Sign\\" and \\"Think Back,\\" among others. The evening's surprise guests really started coming out in force when Beatles tribute act the Fab Faux took the stage with stealth performer Joan Osborne for a rendition of \\"Come Together.\\" The Fab Faux then busted into \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\\" and Anastasio emerged partway through the song to thunderous applause to take an extended solo, before leading the group into a jam uncharacteristic of the cover act. He remained onstage for the rest of the groups segment, which included a tease \\"Bungalow Bill\\" and \\"Everybody‚Äôs Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey.\\" The rest of the night focused on Phish, both before and after the four members of the group took the stage to accept their award. After the quartet slipped into the wings, Disco Biscuits bassist Marc Brownstein led Disco Biscuits guitarist Jon Gutwillig, String Cheese Incident keyboardist Kyle Hollingsworth, Umphreys McGee guitarist Jake Cinninger and Russo through a series of Phish covers under the name the HeadCount All Stars. Brownstein, who has shied away from covering Phish over the years, described the group as his favorite band and led the charge through spot-on renditions of \\"Wilson,\\" \\"Run Like An Antelope,\\" \\"2001,\\" and \\"Maze,\\" the latter of which also featured Disco Biscuits keyboardist Aron Magner. Throughout the performance, moe. lighting director, and former Jambands.com News Editor, Jeff Waful manned the board from the rear of the house. =Winners= Lifetime Achievement: Phish Tour of the Year: the Disco Biscuits/Umphrey‚Äôs McGee, D.U.M.B Live Album of the Year: Umphrey's McGee - Live at the Murat Studio Album of the Year: moe - The Conch Song of the Year: Keller Williams - \\"Cadillac\\" Live Performance of the Year: Gov‚Äôt Mule and Guests, Bonnaroo Archival Album of the Year: The Grateful Dead- \\"Three From The Vault\\" DVD of the Year: the Disco Biscuits - \\"Progressions\\" Download of the Year: Phish - \\"Headphones Jam\\" New Groove: Cornmeal Mimi Fishman Memorial Community Service Award - Rock the Earth The Jammy Industry Award: Lee Crumpton, Homegrown Music Network References  External links  * Jambands.com site * Relix Magazine official site American music awards ","title":"Jammy Award"},{"id":"3514832","text":"Manila Science High School () is the first science high school in the Philippines. It is located on Taft Avenue at the corner of Padre Faura Street in Ermita, Manila, and was established on October 1, 1963.  History  Former President of the Philippines Ramon Magsaysay was the first to envision a Science High School in the Philippines in his 1956 State of the Nation Address where he underscored \\"the great need of stepping up the development of fundamental and applied research in science and technology which has long been neglected.\\" Taking action, the Philippine Congress passed Republic Act 1606 creating the National Science Development Board to work with the Science Foundation of the Philippines in advancing scientific and technological research. This was closely followed by Republic Act 2067, known as the Science Act of 1958 which proposed to integrate, coordinate, and intensify scientific and technological research and development to foster invention. In conjunction, the Department of Education implemented RA 1606 by issuing Department Orders 1 and 5, series of 1958, for the launching of Science Talent Research. November 25, 1959 marked the evolution of the pilot science high school in the Philippines. With 36 students screened through a competitive examination, this nucleus of a science high school had its beginnings in a single-storey building in Intramuros. On its second year, this nucleus was called the Special Science Class. March 28, 1963, witnessed each of the 32 graduates of the Special Science Class receive a gold medal. It is the first time in the history of Philippine education wherein each member of the graduating class is a gold medalist. On October 1, 1963, the Manila Science High School was born by virtue of Municipal Resolution 426 signed by Mayor Antonio J. Villegas. Credit for the school's early success goes to then Manila High School Principal Augusto Alzona ‚Äì the \\"Father of Manila Science High School\\". Modeled after the Bronx High School of Science, the special science curriculum is designed to meet the needs of scholars gifted in science and mathematics. However, opportunities, training, and experiences in varied fields are also available. After five years in Intramuros, the Manila Science High School moved to its present site in 1966 with its first principal, Honesto Valdez (1963‚Äì1977). By 1977, Phase I of the Main Building was completed while the construction of Phase II was ongoing. In September 1977, Evelina P. Barotilla (1977‚Äì1988), the second principal, saw the completion of the Manila Science High School Complex and the renovation of the H.A. Bordner Building. The Home Economics Building was built in 1980. The whole construction project was financed by the Special Education Fund under the chairmanship of Dr. Josefina Navarro, Superintendent of City Schools, Manila. From 1988 until 2002, Manila Science High School was further sharpened under the supervision of Daisy H. Banta. Her leadership saw the completion of the Computer Science building; she also spearheaded the School of the Future program, and the French language program. The new millennium ushered in the arrival of Susan A. Yano, fourth principal, the completion of the Antonio Maceda Building and the revival of the Manila Science High School Alumni Association. Mrs. Susan A. Yano opted for an early retirement. Edna P. Parcon, Math Department Head III, was then assigned Officer-in-Charge from July 18, 2002 to January 13, 2003, together with Ms. Betty de la Cruz, Science Supervisor, assigned Supervisor-in-Charge from October 13, 2002 to January 13, 2003.MSHS yearbook, SY 2005-2006 Rosita C. Herson became the principal in 2003 until 2006. After that, the Manila Science High School was under the leadership of Salud S. Sabado from 2006 until November 15, 2008.The Nucleus, year XLIII, Volume 1, January 2007 Manila Science has been under the leadership of Flora A. Valdez for less than a year until her retirement on January 21, 2010. Before the retirement, a government project has started: the construction of the Amadome by Manila 5th District Congressman Amado Bagatsing, which is now completed in time for the new school year and has been formally inaugurated and turned over by Cong. Bagatsing on September 8, 2010. Due to implementing laws for the May 2010 polls,COMELEC Resolution No. 8737 (December 29, 2009) Manila Science will not have a principal yet until such time that the elected Mayor of Manila appoints new school administrators. The school, at the last half of SY 2009-2010 and on the first quarter of SY 2010‚Äì2011, was under the leadership of Edna P. Parcon, the school's Mathematics Department Head until August 26, 2010 which welcomed the arrival of the seventh principal, Fernando B. Orines.

The game was originally released in September 2004 and continued production until May 2010. Star Wars Miniatures players build point-based squads from one of ten different in-universe factions then conduct battles between those squads. The game mechanics are a simplified version of the d20 roleplaying game system. Multiple maps, scenarios, and set themes from different settings and time periods from within the Star Wars universe are available. History Star Wars Miniatures premiered on September 3, 2004. The first set, \\"Rebel Storm,\\" was released at that time and was followed up by \\"Clone Strike,\\" which came out December 4, 2004. April 9, 2005 brought the third set release, titled \\"Revenge of the Sith\\", with the \\"Universe\\" expansion set in August that, hitting stores on August 27 that year. Later \\"Champions of the Force\\" was released on June 10, 2006. The \\"Bounty Hunters\\" set was released in September 2006, followed by \\"Starships Battles\\" in November. The special 30th anniversary set, \\"Alliance and Empire,\\" was released May 2007. \\"Force Unleashed\\" set has been released in November 2007. \\"Legacy of the Force\\" was released on March 28, 2008. \\"Knights of the Old Republic\\" was released in Summer 2008, followed by \\"Clone Wars\\" in the late Fall of that year. Early 2009 included \\"Imperial Entanglements\\" which was followed in June by \\"Jedi Academy\\". \\"Galaxy at War\\" in October rounded out the 2009 collection, with \\"Dark Times\\" to follow in January/February 2010. The final official set released by Wizards of the Coast was \\"Masters of the Force\\", released April 2010. The sets released from \\"Rebel Storm\\" to \\"Knights of the Old Republic\\" have featured 60 fully constructed and fully painted miniature figures from different eras and settings of the Star Wars timeline. From \\"Clone Wars\\" onward, sets feature a total of 40 pieces. Accompanying the first three sets was a scenario book called Ultimate Missions. Each book contained a double- sided map and a series of scenarios. Ultimate Missions: Rebel Storm included scenarios drawn from A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, along with the associated radio dramas. Ultimate Missions: Clone Strike drew its scenarios from Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, and Star Wars: Clone Wars. Ultimate Missions: Revenge of the Sith covered Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith. The Ultimate Missions series was discontinued after Revenge of the Sith in favor of scenario packs such as Attack on Endor. On November 11, 2005 a special \\"AT-AT Imperial Walker Colossal Pack\\" was released, which came with the AT-AT. The AT-AT is scaled correctly to the other miniatures, and stands at fourteen inches high and eighteen inches long. On February 2006, the \\"Attack on Endor\\" set was released. This set consists of an AT-ST (All Terrain Scout Transport), an Imperial Stormtrooper, Imperial Stormtrooper Officer and an Imperial Stormtrooper Scout. Also included are two double-sided maps and a scenario book. No Ewoks are included. On January 28, 2010, an official announcement on the Wizards of the Coast forum stated that Wizards of the Coast would not renew the license for Star Wars Miniatures. Gameplay In Star Wars Miniatures, ten different factions are available for play. They are Rebel, Imperial, Republic, Separatist, New Republic, Yuuzhan Vong, Old Republic, Sith, Mandalorian, and Fringe. Each game requires that each player chooses one of the above factions to play as and then builds a squad using miniatures from that faction. The only exception is Fringe, which is a \\"neutral\\" faction, whose figures can be used in any squad. Players agree on a point total (100, 150, and 200 being the official standards) and create a squad that does not exceed the chosen point total for one of the following formats: * Free-for- all: Each player makes a single faction(possibly including Fringe) squad for the battle. Factions may battle factions of different eras or even the same faction. This is the format used for sanctioned tournaments. * Era Play: Players select an era then choose one player to play a light side faction and one to play a dark side faction from that era. Fringe characters may mix with either player's squad. The eras are: **Old Republic: Old Republic vs. Sith (or Mandalorian) **Rise of the Empire: Republic vs. Separatist (or Imperial). **Galactic Civil War: Rebel vs. Imperial. **New Republic: New Republic vs. Imperial. **New Jedi Order: New Republic (or Imperial) vs. Yuuzhan Vong. * Light Side vs. Dark Side: Players make a multi-faction squad with one player representing the light side (Old Republic, Republic, Rebel Alliance, & New Republic) and the other representing the dark side (Sith, Mandalorians, Separatists, Imperials, & Yuuzhan Vong) Fringe may belong to either side. * No Faction: Players make a squad using any combination of characters. * Sealed: Players open a predetermined amount of Starters and Boosters and make a No Faction squad with the miniatures contained inside. * Draft: 4 or more Players each open one of three booster boxes at a time, select one miniature inside and pass the box to the next player. The Players then make a squad out of only the miniatures they draft in this way. This can be played No Faction or Factions, if multiple players have the same Faction, they are termed as No Faction for play. After players agree on a point total and play format and build their squads, one of several play maps representing different locations of the Star Wars Universe is chosen and set up. The maps feature a one-inch square grid overlay that indicates where characters can move, as well as being used to determine range and the ability to see a target. Different maps influence the game in different ways. For instance, the map included in the \\"Revenge of the Sith Starter\\" represents the interior of a battered starship, with small hallways and rubble-filled rooms, but is considered the only \\"huge- friendly\\" map as it is the only one where a huge character can travel from one starting area to the other. Some of the official maps are: *Death Star (Rebel Storm Starter) *Tatooine: Mos Eisley (Updated League Prize ONLY, Ultimate Missions: Rebel Storm version NOT tournament legal) *Cloud City (Updated League Prize ONLY, Ultimate Missions: Rebel Storm version NOT tournament legal) *Muunilinst (Clone Strike Starter) *Coruscant: Undercity Streets (Ultimate Missions: Clone Strike) *Geonosis: Arena Pit (Ultimate Missions: Clone Strike) *Starship (Revenge of the Sith Starter) *Invisible Hand (General Grievous's flagship)/Imperial Base (Ultimate Missions: Revenge of the Sith) (New Starter Set) *Mustafar (Ultimate Missions: Revenge of the Sith) *Hoth: Plains (AT-AT Colossal Pack) *Hoth: Shield Generator (AT-AT Colossal Pack) *Forest Moon of Endor: (Attack on Endor) *Yavin 4: Jedi Praxeum (Attack on Endor) *Rancor Cave (Attack on Endor) *Ruined Base (Attack on Endor) *Korriban: Valley of the Dark Lords (Wizards League Kit) (New Starter Set) *Hoth: Echo Base Outpost (Battle of Hoth) *Hoth: Echo Base Outskirts (Battle of Hoth) *Ossus: The Great Jedi Library (reverse side of the promotional Legacy of the Force gallery poster) The objective of the game can vary, but in standard play the winner is the player who earns a number of victory points equal to or greater than the Squad limit or the player with the most victory points when a tiebreaker is called (no characters have made offensive actions in 10 rounds). Players score victory points equal to the cost of characters they defeat. In a variant designed to discourage players from hiding, known as Gambit format, players also score 5 victory points at the end of every round in which they have a character within 4 squares of the center. Gambit format is the format used in sanctioned tournaments. =Combat= Combat in the game is similar to other tabletop games. A 20-sided die (or D20) is used to determine if an attack succeeds and is also used for various other checks throughout the game. In the case of an attack, the D20 is rolled and its final value is modified by the attacker's bonus and other circumstances of the attack (e.g. a target in cover). If the total is greater than or equal to a figure's defense, that figure takes damage. When a figure has taken damage equal to its hit points, that figure is defeated and removed from play. Distinguishing features Star Wars Miniatures has several unique differences that separate it from most other tabletop games. There are \\"Force Powers\\", which are used by Jedi, Sith and other Force users and can devastate lesser figures. These also have Force ratings, which allow them to make re- rolls to failed attacks or defends and also to use their Force powers. There are also \\"Commander Effects\\", possessed by the various leaders in the Star Wars universe (Darth Vader, General Veers, Padm√© Amidala - among others). Commander Effects confer bonuses, enhancements or other special abilities to their allies on the battlefield, although a few commander effects have negative results. Characters also come in different sizes with Small and Medium characters taking up 1 square, Large 4 (2 by 2), Huge 9 (3 by 3), and Colossal (anything bigger than 3 by 3; the biggest so far is the AT-AT, which takes up 6 by 12 squares).

A unique feature of this set includes representations of the monsters used in the iconic Dejarik (\\"holochess\\") game played by R2-D2 and Chewbacca in Star Wars Episode 4: A New Hope. Collectability The game includes miniatures printed at four different levels of rarity: 15px \\"common\\", 15px \\"uncommon\\", 15px \\"rare\\", and 15px \\"Very Rare\\". Each of the first three sets were packaged in individual booster packs of miniatures, which in turn came with 7 random miniatures (1 rare or very rare, 2 uncommon, and 4 common). On average, one in three booster packs included a Very Rare instead of a normal Rare. Popular characters from the movies are typically Rare, while less well known characters from other sources and the most powerful movie characters are Very Rare. As Rare characters are more often found than Very Rares in the randomized booster packs, the more recognizable characters are more increasingly often made Rare in order to maximize the appeal of the product. In the recent Galaxy at War set, characters such as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker and General Grievous appeared as Rares while secondary characters such as Hondo Ohnaka, Mar Tuuk and Wat Tambor fell into the Very Rare position. An increased cost to produce a figure will increase its rarity.\\"...they strive to make things Rare which people will recognize visually from the Movies, characters from the comics and novels who the vast public will not recognize (like Thrawn) will most likely be Very Rare,.... ...this is still dictated by the cost to produce (undercuts, translucent bits, etc.), so sometimes things get bumped up in rarity.\\" In the Universe set, special Huge miniatures were introduced, with a \\"footprint\\" nine times that of a typical figure. Each booster pack came with 1 rare, 1 huge figure (of random rarity), 2 uncommons, and 3 commons. This was the first set in which it was possible to get 2 rares in the same pack. Other products include starter boxes which are prepackaged to include certain figures. The \\"Rebel Storm Starter Game\\" comes with Luke Skywalker, Rebel and Darth Vader, Dark Jedi, along with a randomized assortment of figures. The \\"Clone Strike Starter Game\\" comes with Jango Fett and General Kenobi and a number of randomized figures. The \\"Revenge of the Sith Starter Game\\" comes with General Grievous, Supreme Commander and Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi Master, as well as two Clone Troopers and two Super Battle Droids. A new starter set consisting of reprints contains Obi-Wan Kenobi (Rebel Storm), Darth Vader (Revenge of the Sith), Rebel captain, Rebel Heavy Trooper, Elite Stormtrooper, Heavy Stormtrooper and a Korriban and Trade federation cruiser map. The \\"Attack on Endor\\" Scenario Pack comes with an AT-ST, a Stormtrooper Officer, Stormtrooper and Stormtrooper Scout. The figures of Aurra Sing and a Stormtrooper from the 2005 \\"Star Wars Unleashed\\" line of plastic-sculptured statuettes each came with a bonus miniature \\"Twi'lek Bodyguard\\" for the Wizards of the Coast game; the same miniature came with both figures. The miniature is designated on the bottom of its stand as from the set \\"Unleashed\\" (as distinct from miniatures from the later \\"The Force Unleashed\\" set), but is otherwise identical to the same miniature from the \\"Rebel Storm\\" set released in 2004 (the same date printed on the bottom of the stand for the bonus miniature). It is the only known miniature in the \\"Unleashed\\" set, and also the only known cross- promotional miniature in the entire Wizards miniatures 2004-2010 line.

He is credited with inspiring students and faculty at SUNY Potsdam to form the most successful United States undergraduate mathematics degree programs in the past century. Stephens was recognized by Mathematically Gifted & Black as a Black History Month 2018 Honoree. Early life One of six children, he was orphaned at the age of eight. For his early education, he attended Harbison Agricultural and Industrial Institute, a boarding school for African-Americans in Irmo, South Carolina under Dean R. W. Bouleware and later President Rev John G. Porter. Stephens graduated from Johnson C. Smith University in 1938 with a B.S. degree in mathematics. He received his M.S. (1939) and his Ph.D. (1944) from the University of Michigan. He was the 9th African American to receive a Ph.D in mathematics‚Äì‚Äìfor a thesis on Non-Linear Difference Equations Analytic in a Parameter under James Nyswander. After serving in the U.S. Navy (1942‚Äì1946) as a Teaching Specialist, Dr. Stephens joined the mathematics faculty of Prairie View A&M; University. The next year (1947) he was invited to join the mathematics faculty at Morgan State University. From research to teaching As a Mathematics Association of America (MAA) biography explains, ‚ÄúDr. Stephens' focus was on being a research mathematician, so he accepted the position in part because he would be near a research library at Johns Hopkins University. While at Morgan State University, Dr. Stephens became appalled at what a poor job was being done in general to teach and inspire students to learn mathematics. He changed his focus from being a researcher to achieving excellence, with desirable results, in teaching mathematics. In 1953, he received a one-year Ford Fellowship to study at Princeton University's Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. Dr. Stephens remained at Morgan State until 1962, at which time he accepted an appointment as professor of mathematics at SUNY Geneseo. In 1969 he left Geneseo to join the mathematics faculty at SUNY Potsdam, where he served as chair of the mathematics department until his retirement in 1987. The MAA biography reports that during Dr. Stephens‚Äô tenure at SUNY Potsdam \\"the department became nationally known as a model of teaching excellence in mathematics. For several of these years the program was among the top producers of mathematics majors in the country. The teaching techniques that Professor Stephens introduced at Potsdam, and earlier at Morgan State, have been adopted by many mathematics departments across the country. They have been described in publications by the MAA, and recently in a book, Math Education At Its Best: The Potsdam Model, by Datta (Center for Teaching/Learning of Mathematics, 1993).\\" He turned 100 in July 2017 and died in March 2018.Clarence Stephens Obituary Sources *Clarence Francis Stephens (Google cache) *Clarence Stephens *The Morgan-Potsdam Model and the Potsdam Miracle References External links * 1917 births 2018 deaths 20th-century American mathematicians 21st-century American mathematicians African-American people African-American centenarians American centenarians Johnson C.

It first aired on NBC on December 15, 1973, and was written by Larry Niven. It was based on his original short story \\"The Soft Weapon\\". This episode was expanded to become the first half of a full-length novel by science-fiction author Alan Dean Foster as Star Trek Log Ten. Set in the 23rd century, the series follows the adventures of Captain James T. Kirk (voiced by William Shatner) and the crew of the Starfleet starship Enterprise. In this episode, while traveling by shuttlecraft, several Enterprise crew members are captured and have to use their individual strengths to prevent a powerful alien weapon from falling into the wrong hands. Plot On stardate 4187.3, the Enterprise shuttlecraft Copernicus, carrying Science Officer Spock (voiced by Leonard Nimoy), Communications Officer Lt. Uhura (voiced by Nichelle Nichols), and Helmsman Lt. Hikaru Sulu (voiced by George Takei) are en route to Starbase 25 to deliver a stasis box, a rare artifact of the Slaver culture. The now-extinct Slavers used these objects to carry weapons, valuables, scientific instruments and data. The boxes can detect each other and evidence shows that another device is located near Beta Lyrae. Following the signal, the shuttle lands on an ice planet where the crew is captured by the hostile, catlike Kzinti. The Kzinti had an empty stasis box of their own, and were using it to lure in passing starships. They are trying to steal the boxes in the hopes of finding a super weapon that will return their empire to its former greatness. The Kzinti open the box that the Enterprise had been transporting, finding inside some fresh meat, a picture of a Slaver, and a powerful (but unfamiliar) alien device, which the Kzinti immediately suspect is a weapon. The weapon passes hands several times between the Federation and Kzinti crews, during which time Sulu discovers a total-conversion beam setting. The Kzinti recapture all three Federation personnel and the weapon. As the Kzinti explore the device's many settings, they discover a war computer that starts talking to them. After the Kzinti fail to provide several code words and ask about the total-conversion beam setting, the weapon concludes that they are enemies and directs them to what it claims is the setting that they want but which is actually a self-destruct setting. When the Kzinti activate that setting it turns out to be a disruptor field that destroys the weapon and kills the Kzinti. Production Producer D. C. Fontana approached Larry Niven in 1973 to see if he would write an episode for The Animated Series, suggesting that he might adapt one of his existing stories. At the time Niven was a major up-and-coming force in the science fiction world; in 1971 his novel Ringworld was awarded the Hugo Award for Best Novel, the Nebula Award for Best Novel and the Locus Award for Best Novel. Niven's first attempt to write a teleplay introduced his Known Space setting into the Star Trek universe. The story involved a group of Outsiders who were using a quantum black hole to disable passing ships drives' in order to pirate them. Fontana advised him that the original version wouldn't work as an episode, and his second attempt proved to be \\"too bloody.\\"Niven While Niven visited Gene Roddenberry's house one afternoon, Roddenberry suggested that he use his short story \\"The Soft Weapon\\" as the basis for an episode. This story opens with a small spacecraft making a quick side-trip to view Beta Lyrae. On board are the human couple who crew the spacecraft, and their passenger, a Pierson's Puppeteer named Nessus. Nessus has a stasis box in his possession, and a routine scan reveals that another stasis box is located somewhere in the Beta Lyrae system, much to their surprise. When they attempt to retrieve the second box, they are captured by a group of Kzinti pirates. The Kzinti are in possession of an empty stasis box, and are using it to lure in passing starships. The three outwit the Kzinti and escape. For the adaptation into the Star Trek universe, Niven changed the identity of the characters in the original to their analogs in Star Trek. Nessus, a highly intelligent normally pacifist herbivore, fitted neatly onto the character of Spock. The original male and female starship crew were replaced by Sulu and Uhura, while the small spacecraft became the newly introduced long-range shuttlecraft. The characters from the Kzinti ship remained unchanged. There were minor changes to simplify the storytelling, but only one major change. In \\"The Soft Weapon\\" the artifacts were built by the Tnuctipun, a technologically advanced species that had been enslaved by the Thrintun, the eponymous \\"Slavers\\". They had built many weapons in secret like this one as part of a long-planned revolt. This backstory is outside the scope of \\"The Slaver Weapon\\", and in this version the box and weapon are presumed to be of Slaver origin. That the Kzinti's clothing and ships were depicted in shades of pink was long rumored to be due to director Hal Sutherland suffering colorblindness,Bill Reed, \\"Draw to the Final Frontier: The making of Star Trek the Animated Series\\", DVD documentaryThe Slaver Weapon but this was contradicted by Bob Kline, Filmation designer and layout artist, who stated in a podcast interview that the color choices were the work of color stylist Irv Kaplan. An apology was offered to Larry Niven for this oversight. This is the first Star Trek story broadcast (in either its live-action or animated incarnations) in which James T. Kirk (William Shatner) does not appear, although his voice is heard in the standard opening credits. (Kirk also did not appear in the live-action pilot \\"The Cage\\", but that was not broadcast in its original form until 1988.) As well, in another first, the starship Enterprise does not appear, except in the standard opening credits. Reception The episode was reviewed by Mark Altman and Edward Gross in their book, Trek Navigator, where they called it \\"by far one of the best and most literate of the animated episodes.\\"Altman & Gross (1998): p. 215 They described the Kzinti as a \\"fascinating\\" new enemy, and praised the introduction of the Slaver boxes. The voice work was said to be \\"surprisingly good\\", but the animation was criticised with the pink ship and uniforms of the aliens \\"somewhat negates their menace.\\" Legacy The Kzinti Dark Stalker vessel as designed by Josh Finney Following production of \\"The Slaver Weapon\\", Niven returned to his Known Space concept and began to expand it. \\"The Borderland of Sol\\" was developed from his original pitch for The Animated Series and was first published in Analog magazine in January 1975, and republished in the collection Tales of Known Space in the same year.Niven (1975): p. vi It was awarded the Hugo Award for Best Novelette in 1976, and republished as part of the novel Crashlander in 1994. Niven later wrote a storyline in the syndicated Star Trek newspaper comic strip entitled \\"The Wristwatch Plantation\\", which re-introduced the Kzinti to that universe once more. While production was under way on the fourth season of Star Trek: Enterprise, Niven commented that he was aware of efforts to re-introduce the Kzinti into the Star Trek franchise, and had \\"always hoped [they] could make it work.\\" At the same time, the Kzinti were featured in the Star Trek Communicator magazine as one of the alien races representing the seven deadly sins, with the Kzinti being specifically related to lust. This was because of the Kzinti's need to feed on the flesh of others being \\"gastronomic instead of carnal\\" which meant that they are seen as \\"sensual, without being overtly sexual.\\" A CGI animated film called Star Trek: Lions of the Night was in development by writer Jimmy Diggs at the time, which would have had Captain Hikaru Sulu attempting to prevent a Kzinti invasion of the Federation using the USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-B). Manny Coto, the show runner for Enterprise, had been pursuing the idea of including the Kzinti into the series for the fifth season called \\"Kilkenny Cats\\" based on the Diggs idea.Robb (2012): p. 222 However, the series was cancelled at the end of the fourth and the episode was never made. Josh Finney had been commissioned by Diggs to design a Kzinti vessel for the possible inclusion in the Enterprise episode. In the first season, episode 7 of Star Trek: Picard, Riker references this ST:TAS episode saying, \\"We've had a little trouble around here lately with the Kzinti.\\".

It first aired in the NBC Saturday morning lineup on December 1, 1973, and was written by Margaret Armen.This story was expanded into a novelette by science-fiction author Alan Dean Foster as part of the collection, Star Trek Log Five (1975) (). who wrote the earlier episode \\"The Lorelei Signal\\" and also worked on episodes for The Original Series. In this episode, Captain Kirk and First Officer Spock are mysteriously transformed into water-breathers. Plot On stardate 5499.9, while exploring the planet Argo, which was transformed into a water planet by seismic disturbances, Captain Kirk of the Federation starship Enterprise and his Science Officer Spock are lost from their survey party when their aquashuttle is attacked by a giant sea creature. After a lengthy search, the two are found, mysteriously transformed into water breathers. Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy's analysis indicates that this could not have been accomplished by any natural process, leading to the conclusion that intelligent life must still exist on the planet, but under the seas. In order to return to their normal selves, Kirk and Spock must seek out the intelligent life forms responsible for their transformation. Since the aquashuttle was destroyed when the sea creature attacked them, they swim to search for answers. They encounter a group of Aquans (members of an advanced undersea civilization) who express fear and disgust before swimming away. Kirk and Spock follow them from a distance and are captured as they admire the Aquans‚Äô underwater city. They are taken to a tribune where they are accused of being spies. One council member, Rila, stands up for them, asking that they be given a chance to explain themselves. Unfortunately, the meeting is interrupted by Aquans who report that three air-breathers have invaded the sea foliage. They are referring to Mr. Scott and the rest of the assistance party who moved from their original post to try to inform Kirk and Spock of an impending sea quake. Upon hearing this news, the leader of the council decides that Kirk and Spock are to be brought to the surface and left there to suffocate. Rila, the sole sympathetic council member, saves their lives by leading the assistance party to them. She then explains the Aquan history that led to their fear of air- breathers, revealing that reverse mutation is possible, but forbidden. Despite the ban, Kirk enlists her help in locating the lost formula for reversing the transformation and capturing a giant sur-snake whose venom is key to the antidote. Reception John Peel, writing for the magazine The Star Trek Files, described the episode as \\"a particularly silly story\\", citing as story with things done that couldn't have been done in the live show but without any thought put into it. As part of his re-watch series of articles of the show, Keith DeCandido rated this a 5 out of 10, citing the episode's climax as \\"stultifying\\". Notes As part of budgetary savings, Majel Barrett voiced all of the female voices for this episode, while James Doohan voices several of the Aquans, including the High Tribune, with producer (and Filmation co- founder) Lou Scheimer voicing Lemus, with unknown actors voicing other several characters.

People described as having golden ears are said to be able to discern subtle differences in audio reproduction that most inexperienced and untrained listeners cannot. Another meaning of the term is used by audiologists to describe aging test subjects who do not demonstrate the expected age-related loss in hearing acuity. Music perception A person said to have golden ears is one who can perceive more subtle changes in sound than others, either by training or by birth. The skill is rare. An ongoing blind loudspeaker listening program developed by Floyd E. Toole of Harman International has demonstrated that listeners can be trained to reliably discern relatively small frequency response differences among loudspeakers, whereas untrained listeners cannot. He showed that inexperienced listeners cannot reliably identify even large frequency response deviations. Toole's research also indicates that when participants can see what they are hearing, their preferences often change profoundly. If the listener and test administrator don't know which sound source is the favored- to-win candidate, the differences often disappear (or the favorite loses).Blind Testing in the Audio Realm, by Dave Moulton Skilled listeners who claim to be able to hear differences among various pieces of audio gear assert that the ability to do so is no different from discerning picture quality differences among cameras, or discerning image quality differences among video display devices. However others argue that there are fundamental differences in the way audio and visual reproductions such as a photograph are compared, photographs can be compared side-by-side and simultaneously whereas audio must be compared sequentially.The Audio Critic, issue 26, page 3, letters to the editor, R. A. Greiner \\"Photographic results are much more definitive and easier to compare than are audio results. (...) In the first case a time- sequential comparison is made, and in the second the comparison can be and usually is simultaneous.\\" The minimum audible change in sound pressure level is generally thought to be around 1 dB, but less than 0.1 dB has been reported in blind listening tests.Ljudtekniska S√§llskapet When testing, the level difference between stimuli is therefore recommended to be calibrated to ¬±0.05 dB.

Animation depicting evolution of a Cornu spiral with the tangential circle with the same radius of curvature as at its tip, also known as an osculating circle (click on thumbnail to observe). This sign aside a railroad (between Ghent and Bruges) indicates the start of the transition curve. A parabolic curve (POB) is used. A track transition curve, or spiral easement, is a mathematically-calculated curve on a section of highway, or railroad track, in which a straight section changes into a curve. It is designed to prevent sudden changes in lateral (or centripetal) acceleration. In plane (viewed from above), the start of the transition of the horizontal curve is at infinite radius, and at the end of the transition, it has the same radius as the curve itself and so forms a very broad spiral. At the same time, in the vertical plane, the outside of the curve is gradually raised until the correct degree of bank is reached. If such an easement were not applied, the lateral acceleration of a rail vehicle would change abruptly at one point (the tangent point where the straight track meets the curve), with undesirable results. With a road vehicle, the driver naturally applies the steering alteration in a gradual manner, and the curve is designed to permit that by using the same principle. History On early railroads, because of the low speeds and wide-radius curves employed, the surveyors were able to ignore any form of easement, but during the 19th century, as speeds increased, the need for a track curve with gradually increasing curvature became apparent. Rankine's 1862 \\"Civil Engineering\\" cites several such curves, including an 1828 or 1829 proposal based on the \\"curve of sines\\" by William Gravatt, and the curve of adjustment by William Froude around 1842 approximating the elastic curve. The actual equation given in Rankine is that of a cubic curve, which is a polynomial curve of degree 3, at the time also known as a cubic parabola. In the UK, only from 1845, when legislation and land costs began to constrain the laying out of rail routes and tighter curves were necessary, were the principles beginning to be applied in practice. Brusio spiral viaduct and railway (Switzerland, built 1908), from above The 'true spiral', whose curvature is exactly linear in arclength, requires more sophisticated mathematics (in particular, the ability to integrate its intrinsic equation) to compute than the proposals that were cited by Rankine. Several late-19th century civil engineers seem to have derived the equation for this curve independently (all unaware of the original characterization of the curve by Leonhard Euler in 1744). Charles Crandall gives credit to one Ellis Holbrook, in the Railroad Gazette, Dec. 3, 1880, for the first accurate description of the curve. Another early publication was The Railway Transition Spiral by Arthur N. Talbot, originally published in 1890. Some early 20th century authors call the curve \\"Glover's spiral\\" and attribute it to James Glover's 1900 publication. The equivalence of the railroad transition spiral and the clothoid seems to have been first published in 1922 by Arthur Lovat Higgins. Since then, \\"clothoid\\" is the most common name given the curve, but the correct name (following standards of academic attribution) is 'the Euler spiral'. Geometry While railroad track geometry is intrinsically three-dimensional, for practical purposes the vertical and horizontal components of track geometry are usually treated separately. The overall design pattern for the vertical geometry is typically a sequence of constant grade segments connected by vertical transition curves in which the local grade varies linearly with distance and in which the elevation therefore varies quadratically with distance. Here grade refers to the tangent of the angle of rise of the track. The design pattern for horizontal geometry is typically a sequence of straight line (i.e., a tangent) and curve (i.e. a circular arc) segments connected by transition curves. The degree of banking in railroad track is typically expressed as the difference in elevation of the two rails, commonly quantified and referred to as the superelevation. Such difference in the elevation of the rails is intended to compensate for the centripetal acceleration needed for an object to move along a curved path, so that the lateral acceleration experienced by passengers/the cargo load will be minimized, which enhances passenger comfort/reduces the chance of load shifting (movement of cargo during transit, causing accidents and damage). It is important to note that superelevation is not the same as the roll angle of the rail which is used to describe the \\"tilting\\" of the individual rails instead of the banking of the entire track structure as reflected by the elevation difference at the \\"top of rail\\". Regardless of the horizontal alignment and the superelevation of the track, the individual rails are almost always designed to \\"roll\\"/\\"cant\\" towards gage side (the side where the wheel is in contact with the rail) to compensate for the horizontal forces exerted by wheels under normal rail traffic. The change of superelevation from zero in a tangent segment to the value selected for the body of a following curve occurs over the length of a transition curve that connects the tangent and the curve proper. Over the length of the transition the curvature of the track will also vary from zero at the end abutting the tangent segment to the value of curvature of the curve body, which is numerically equal to one over the radius of the curve body. The simplest and most commonly used form of transition curve is that in which the superelevation and horizontal curvature both vary linearly with distance along the track. Cartesian coordinates of points along this spiral are given by the Fresnel integrals. The resulting shape matches a portion of an Euler spiral, which is also commonly referred to as a \\"clothoid\\", and sometimes \\"Cornu spiral\\". A transition curve can connect a track segment of constant non-zero curvature to another segment with constant curvature that is zero or non-zero of either sign. Successive curves in the same direction are sometimes called progressive curves and successive curves in opposite directions are called reverse curves. The Euler spiral provides the shortest transition subject to a given limit on the rate of change of the track superelevation (i.e. the twist of the track). However, as has been recognized for a long time, it has undesirable dynamic characteristics due to the large (conceptually infinite) roll acceleration and rate of change of centripetal acceleration at each end. Because of the capabilities of personal computers it is now practical to employ spirals that have dynamics better than those of the Euler spiral.

Nabaztag was designed to be a \\"smart object\\" comparable to those manufactured by Ambient Devices; it can connect to the Internet (to download weather forecasts, read its owner's email, etc.). It is also customizable and programmable to an extent. Sylvain Huet developed most of the embedded code of all Violet objects. Sebastien Bourdeauducq developed the Wi-Fi driver. Antoine Schmitt has been their behavior designer and Jean-Jacques Birg√© their sound designer (together they have also composed Nabaz'mob, an opera for 100 Nabaztag). Ma√ølis Puyfaucher (who features its French voice) wrote all the original texts pronounced by the rabbit. On 20 October 2009, following a long period of technical difficulties that ultimately led to Violet's bankruptcy, Mindscape purchased Violet. In October 2010, Mindscape announced a third generation Nabaztag, called \\"Karotz\\". Karotz was released April 2012. On 27 July 2011, Mindscape stopped the maintenance of the Nabaztag and released its source code. On 23 December 2011, it was announced that the Nabaztag rabbits would be \\"coming back to life\\" on 24 December 2011 at midnight via email to those with Violet accounts. The required server service at Nabaztag.com has since stopped functioning, but other options exist including setting up a server using OpenNab software or installing NabaztagLives on a Raspberry Pi single-board computer. Features Out of the box, the Nabaztag rabbit is in height and weighs . It can send and receive MP3s and messages that are read out loud as well as perform the following services (by either speaking the information out loud or using indicative lights): weather forecast, stock market report, news headlines, alarm clock, e-mail alerts, RSS-Feeds, MP3-Streams and others. There is an API, with bindings for multiple programming languages including Java, Perl, Python, or PHP, available to program the Nabaztag. At first speaking only in English and French, as of June 2007, Nabaztag fully supports services in German, Italian, Spanish and Dutch. The rabbits can be customized with Skinz tattoos, detachable USB tails in various colors, and many interchangeable ears with different designs and colors. The Nabaztag:tag and Karotz versions are capable of reading RFID chips, and products containing RFID chips include the Flatanoz key ring tags, miniature models of the rabbits called Nano:ztag, and some children's books. Individual RFID chips were also produced and were called ztamp:s. Community Nabaztag owners can join social networks to share photos and videos on websites like Flickr and YouTube. Users can create podcasts (dubbed \\"Nabcasts\\" by Violet). There are currently over 100 of these available, mostly in English and French, created by different users on a variety of topics. Since Nabaztags can be programmed to provide new services using the API, there are user-created applications available, including a Dashboard widget and a lottery alarm. Infrastructure shortcomings In December 2006 (most notably around Christmas) a number of sold rabbits caused issues for Violet, the maker of Nabaztag. The Nabaztag device acts as a client to the France-based servers. When users attempted to register their new devices, the centralized servers were unable to handle the demand, resulting in service disruptions, server unavailability, and data integrity problems caused by users creating multiple half-finished registrations. This resulted in a major customer service problem for Violet. The fundamental philosophy of Nabaztag, that all objects should be connected together on the Internet by a server maintained by Violet did not work as expected (e.g. the server sometimes could not cope with volume of traffic, services had to be switched off and there were unreliable response times often as slow as hours rather than seconds). In March 2008, Violet changed their server infrastructure and bunny software to use the standard XMPP protocol. Bunnies were thereafter reacting much more rapidly on average, although long delays still occurred sometimes. The change caused service disruptions and problems for a couple of weeks. Technical specifications The device embeds a PIC18F6525 microcontroller, a BenQ PC card 802.11b Wi-Fi adapter, an ml2870a Audio-PCM sound generator, an ADPCM converter, two motors to activate the ears, a TLC5922 LED controller, and a small amount of memory. The embedded software handles the TCP/IP stack and Wi-Fi driver. It also implements a virtual machine which is able to execute up to 64 kb of code. A dedicated assembly language exists to program the different features of the device. Nabaztag/tag Out on market on 12 December 2006, Nabaztag/tag is an improved model of Violet's Nabaztag. The new model supports MP3 audio streaming for Internet radio (with preset radio stations and an app allowing to add your own stream that does not work) and podcasts. This second version Nabaztag has also added a microphone that allows for voice activation of some of its services. However, despite text on the website claiming that new services will be available soon, the number of working voice activated services remains less than a handful. A final added feature is a built-in RFID reader to detect special-purpose RFID tags (i.e. ISO/IEC 14443 Type B). Nabaztag advertisement is presenting the ability to identify objects (depicted are e.g. keys). Nabaztag/tag can, as of November 2007, use RFID tags to read special edition versions of children's books by the French publisher Gallimard Jeunesse. In October 2008, Violet launched RFID Children's Books with Penguin Publishing House. Further RFID services and support have been promised. Violet has now started selling the Zstamps and Nano:ztags (little mini Rabbits with Zstamps inside them) and another called mir:ror which is its own RFID system separate from the Nabaztag. The Wi-Fi was also upgraded to support WPA encryption, and now uses a cheaper SoftMAC card instead of the BenQ device which embedded its own 802.11 protocol stack. Cessation of service Mindscape, filing for bankruptcy, discontinued the Nabaztag/tag web service in late July 2011. Alternative servers are available, including: *NabaztagLives.com *NabIzDead *OpenJabNab *OpenNab (written in PHP) *Trudy *other services It however should be noted that these services, and others not listed here, can't support the older Nabaztag. The older units can currently be connected to a user-driven restoration of the old domain; however, the user is currently unable to add new applications or customize the Nabaztag v1 configuration. As for now (January 2012), the older units are provided with random utterances of French phrases and jokes (the Moods application), periodic choreographies of ear movements and lights (the Tai-Chi application) and a fixed sleep-awake cycle, as the older units used a proprietary audio format and were handled by the Violet/Mindscape server in a different way than the Nabaztag/tag. Karotz Karotz is the third generation Nabaztag, and first to be released since the Mindscape purchase. Like its predecessors, Karotz connects to the Internet using Wi-Fi and has RFID reading capability. Additionally, it includes an integrated web cam, a USB port (which can be used for power as well as connectivity), and 256 MB of onboard storage. Karotz was released in April 2011 and is heavily integrated with Facebook and Twitter. In October 2011 Mindscape was taken over by Aldebaran Robotics quoting \\"Together we shall go on with this wonderful adventure\\". In October 2014 Aldebaran Robotics announce\\"The end of Karotz's adventures\\" with \\"nearly 10 years after its first appearance, Karotz is facing a very strong technological competition: the connected devices are now 4G, mobile and evolutionary. Karotz and its users have not only helped establish connected devices; they have paved the way. New products make a stronger match to market needs, marking the end of Karotz's great story.\\" \\"Karotz's servers and customer service will be stopped on February 18th, 2015\\" Karotz Private Servers In 2016, two years after \\"The end of Karotz's adventures\\" a new English enabled API has been set up to bring Karotz out of retirement from a volunteer initiative called Free Rabbits!  Security  During DEF CON 21, Daniel Crowley, Jenniver Savage and David Bryan pointed out several security vulnerabilities about the Karotz. Unsecured connections to the website's provider could allow a hacker to steal the users' Wi-Fi passwords, take control of the Karotz, installing malware and even to corrupt the device without any knowledge of the end user. During the same talk, they also show how it was possible to spy around the Karotz due to the presence of the camera and the microphone embedded in the bunny.

Legislative history In President Grover Cleveland's annual address to Congress in December 1885, he emotionally discussed the issue of polygamy in Utah: > The strength, the perpetuity, and the destiny of the nation rest upon our > homes, established by the law of God, guarded by parental care, regulated by > parental authority, and sanctified by parental love. These are not the homes > of polygamy. . . . There is no feature of this practice or the system which > sanctions it which is not opposed to all that is of value in our > institutions.

The park, which is open all year, borders the Wheeler National Wildlife Refuge and is operated by the City of Decatur Parks and Recreation Board. History Point Mallard Park's J. Gilmer Blackburn Aquatic Center was developed after Gilmer Blackburn, mayor of Decatur from 1962 to 1968, saw enclosed \\"wave-making\\" swimming pools in Germany and thought one could be a tourist attraction in the United States. J. Austin Smith, an Ohio pool manufacturer, worked with the city of Decatur to design the pool. In 1967 the Point Mallard Authority was formed with the intent of creating the new park without city tax revenue. The land where the park is now located was occupied by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) for industrial use. The city issued $3.8 million in bonds for the initial cost of the park, and construction began in September 1969. The park opened on August 8, 1970 with the wave pool, Olympic-sized swimming pool, and golf course. They, along with Big Surf in Tempe, Arizona claim to have built the nation's first wave pool, although Big Surf's is actually the oldest, opening in the summer of 1969. No other wave pools were constructed in the nation for another eleven years. The campground was constructed a few years later in 1972 and the open-air ice rink in 1973. A few years after initial opening, a ten meter tall diving tower with three platforms was constructed. It is named after Olympic gold medalist Jenny Chandler, who practiced there prior to her win in the 1976 Summer Olympics diving events. The pool was also the training facility for the 1976 U.S. Olympic Diving Team, and was where Greg Louganis (who won Gold Medals in the 1984 and 1988 Summer Olympics) trained from 1976 to 1979. President Ronald Reagan spoke at the Spirit of America Festival at Point Mallard on July 4, 1984. In 1987, the wave pool was renamed the J. Gilmer Blackburn Aquatic Center after mayor Blackburn. In 2013, the park finished constructing a lazy river and two new speed slides. In 2016, the aquatic center attracted more than 165,000 visitors.

Just north of the Canada - United States border on PTH 30, Gretna had a population of 541 in 2016. It is bordered by Pembina County, North Dakota. The nearest American community to Gretna is Neche, North Dakota.  History  Once home to roaming Buffalo herds, the area around Gretna attracted European settlers as far back as the early 19th century. Originally, Gretna was only known as \\"Smuggler's Point\\", a simple border crossing where the flow of undeclared goods were smuggled over the border by early settlers and fur trappers. Soon after establishing the 49th parallel as the international border, Gretna became an important customs centre and border community for both the Canadian and American governments. Gretna's strategic geographic location raised the interest of the Canadian Pacific Railway which encouraged the creation of large grain elevator operations in the area. The Ogilvie Milling Company was one of the first and most prominent private companies in Gretna around the turn of the 20th century. It is believed company founder William Ogilvie, originally from Scotland, named Gretna after Gretna Green in Scotland, also a border community, where runaway couples were married by the blacksmith at his anvil. In 1897, Gretna and area was visited by Russian prince and anarchist Peter Kropotkin who praised the local Mennonites for their industriousness and communal lifestyle. Gretna soon became a prominent border community. As businesses thrived and expanded, Gretna life in the early 20th century was filled with promise and opportunity. As progress would have it, changes afforded Gretna no favours and the community began losing the grain milling industry responsible for its boom. After World War II, Gretna became the centre for oil transfer to the United States of America. Enbridge Pipelines Inc. (the main storage and transfer company of oil in southern Manitoba) which has been, and continues to be, a supporting member of Gretna. In 2013, the Provincial NDP Government legislated Manitoba communities under the population of 1000 must amalgamate with their nearest neighbouring municipality with a deadline of 2015. Gretna lost its local government as a result and governmental control was passed to the RM of Rhineland, now the Municipality of Rhineland. Gretna's history repeatedly reveals how this rural community has survived many changes and disasters. It continues to draw young families looking for that comfortable mix between rural and urban; the comfort of small town living with the necessary amenities and close proximity to larger centres.

The two-day outdoor festival, set at Point Mallard Park in Decatur, Alabama, hosts a variety of traditional summer activities. The event is organized and staged by an all-volunteer board. The major highlights of the festival are the presentation of the Audie Murphy Patriotism Award, the presentation of the Barrett C. Shelton Award, the Miss Point Mallard pageant, and also the presentation of one of North Alabama's largest aerial fireworks displays. History The Spirit of America Festival began in 1967 as anti-Vietnam War protests grew throughout the United States. The citizens of Decatur, AL, decided to show their support for the servicemen and women in Vietnam, and to promote patriotism in America through the presentation of an annual Fourth of July event. Over 10,000 people gathered in a local high school stadium for the first Spirit of America Festival. In 1970, a Miss America preliminary pageant was added to the festival's line-up, Miss Spirit of America, along with family games and other special events. In 1976, the Spirit of America Festival relocated after an outdoor stage was constructed for at Point Mallard Park, a local municipal park, owned and operated by the City of Decatur. The pageant title was changed to \\"Miss Point Mallard\\" from 1976 through 2013. In 2014, the pageant moved to the Princess Theatre Center for the Performing Arts and resumed the \\"Miss Spirit of America\\" name. Air Force Captain Gerald O. Young, in his first speech given since receiving the Medal of Honor for heroism in Vietnam, directed a great tribute to the \\"American Soldier\\" to a gathering of over 20,000 people. In 1984, President Ronald Reagan addressed a crowd of over 60,000 people at that year's festival. COVID-19 pandemic concerns caused the 2020 festival to be cancelled; the 54th was deferred to 2021. Special Events The Audie Murphy Patriotism Award is named in honor of America's most decorated soldier from World War II, and Medal of Honor recipient Audie Murphy. Murphy, who was to have been the guest speaker at the 1971 Spirit of America Festival, died in a plane crash just two months prior to his scheduled appearance at the Festival. The award is now presented annually to an \\"outstanding American patriot\\" or \\"an outstanding group of individuals who most exemplify the true 'Spirit of America.'\\" Past recipients of the Audie Murphy Patriotism Award include: Vietnam Prisoner of War Charles J. Plumb, Brigadier General Hallett D. Edson, General Omar Bradley, Alabama Governor George C. Wallace, U.S. Senator James C. Allen, U.S. Senator John Sparkman, U.S. astronaut John Young, Olympic track star Jesse Owens, entertainer Johnny Cash, U.S. Congressman Bob Jones, Secretary of State Alexander Haig; Vietnam veteran U.S. Senator Jeremiah A. Denton, U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond, Iranian hostage Charles C. Scott, actor Gerald McRaney, and U.S. Admiral Donald Whitmire. The Barrett C. Shelton Freedom Award was established in 1980 in honor of local newspaper publisher, Barrett C. Shelton, one of the founders of the Spirit of America Festival. The award is presented annually to honor an Alabamian for outstanding service to his/her community and state. Notable past recipients include Henry Eugene \\"Red\\" Erwin, U.S. Senator Howell Heflin, and U.S. Representative Ronnie Flippo. In 1994 the H.J. Heimlich Humanitarian Award was added to the honors presented at the Spirit of America Festival. The plaque is presented to an individual or group who have saved or attempted to save another human being, or an individual or group who have significantly added to the betterment of all mankind. Dr. H.J. Heimlich was the first recipient, followed by the United Service Organizations. The \\"Miss Spirit of America\\" pageant (known as \\"Miss Point Mallard\\" from 1976 through 2013) is one of the many preliminary pageants in the Miss America scholarship program.

The Yankees had the home field advantage in the series because they had won their division and the Orioles were the Wild Card team. Background The two teams were victorious in the AL Division Series (ALDS), with the Yankees defeating the West Division champion Texas Rangers three games to one, and the Orioles defeating the Central Division champion Cleveland Indians three games to one. The Orioles were the first wild card team to advance to the LCS. The Yankees won the series four games to one to become the American League champions, and won against the National League champion Atlanta Braves in the 1996 World Series. Summary =New York Yankees vs. Baltimore Orioles= Game summaries =Game 1= Wednesday, October 9, 1996, at Yankee Stadium (I) in Bronx, New York The Yankees struck first in Game 1 when Tim Raines doubled to lead off the first off Scott Erickson, moved to third on a groundout, and scored on Bernie Williams's groundout, but the Orioles tied in the second off Andy Pettitte when Rafael Palmeiro drew a leadoff walk, moved to third on a double and scored on Eddie Murray's ground out. The Yankees retook the lead in the second when Cecil Fielder drew a leadoff walk, moved two bases on an error and force out, then scored on Jim Leyritz's groundout, but Brady Anderson's home run in the third tied the game again. Next inning, Palmeiro's home run put the Orioles up 3‚Äì2. In the sixth, the Orioles loaded the bases on two walks and a single before B.J. Surhoff's sacrifice fly put them up 4‚Äì2. In the bottom of the seventh, Armando Benitez walked Darryl Strawberry with the bases loaded to cut Baltimore's lead to 4‚Äì3. Next inning, the game would become most notable for the infamous \\"Jeffrey Maier Incident.\\" Rookie Derek Jeter hit a fly ball to deep right field off Ben√≠tez. Right fielder Tony Tarasco backed up to the wall, but 12-year-old Yankees fan Jeffrey Maier reached over the fence and brought the ball into the stands and out of the field of play before Tarasco could attempt to catch the ball for a possible out. Tarasco immediately pointed above and protested that it was fan interference, but right field umpire Rich Garcia controversially ruled it a home run and his call was upheld by the other members of the umpiring crew. The game then went into extra innings, where Bernie Williams ended it in the 11th with a walk-off home run into the left field seats off Baltimore's Randy Myers. =Game 2= Thursday, October 10, 1996, at Yankee Stadium (I) in Bronx, New York The Yankees struck first in Game 2 on three consecutive leadoff singles in the first off David Wells, the last of which to Bernie Williams scored Derek Jeter and put Tim Raines at third. Raines scored on Cecil Fielder's double play to put the Yankees up 2‚Äì0, but the Orioles tied the game on Todd Zeiles' two-run home run in the third after a walk off David Cone. In the seventh, Rafael Palmeiro drove a Jeff Nelson slider high over the right field fence for a two-run home run to put Baltimore up 4‚Äì2. Wells allowed two singles in the bottom of the inning and was relieved by Alan Mills, who allowed an RBI single to Fielder to make it 4‚Äì3 Orioles, but in the eighth, Brady Anderson and Zeile hit back-to- back one-out singles off Nelson, who was relieved by Graeme Lloyd and Roberto Alomar's sacrifice fly made it 5‚Äì3 Orioles. In the ninth, the Yankees put runners on first and second with one out off Randy Myers before Armando Ben√≠tez came on to slam the door on the budding rally as the Orioles tied the series 1‚Äì1. Cone was wild, walking five batters in six innings of work, while Wells won for the tenth time in 11 career decisions at Yankee Stadium. The Yankees continued a trend that started in Game 1 by stranding 11 men on base, bringing their total to 24 for the series. =Game 3= Friday, October 11, 1996, at Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore, Maryland The Orioles got on the board in the first inning with a Todd Zeile two-run homer, his second of the series. After that, Jimmy Key cruised allowing only one more hit through eight innings. Meanwhile, Mike Mussina pitched well also, allowing just one run in the fourth when Bernie Williams walked with one out, moved to third on a single and scored on Cecil Fielder's groundout, but unraveled with two outs in the top of the eighth inning. Jeter started the rally with a double and scored on Bernie Williams' RBI single to tie the game. Tino Martinez followed by spanking an opposite field double to left. As the relay came in from left field, Todd Zeile caught the ball and then faked a throw towards second. However, the ball slipped out of his hand and straight towards the ground. As the ball trickled away from him and shortstop Cal Ripken on the infield, Williams, who had been content to stay at third on the double, alertly scampered home to give the Yankees a 3‚Äì2 lead. Mussina then served up a hanging curveball to the next batter Cecil Fielder, who blasted it into the left field stands making the score 5‚Äì2. John Wetteland earned a save with a perfect ninth to give the Yankees a 2‚Äì1 series lead. =Game 4= Saturday, October 12, 1996, at Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore, Maryland The Yankees struck first on Bernie Williams's two-run home run in the top of the first off Rocky Coppinger. The Orioles cut the lead to 2‚Äì1 in the bottom of the inning on Rafael Palmeiro's sacrifice fly with runners on first and third off Kenny Rogers. Darryl Strawberry's leadoff home run next inning made it 3‚Äì1 Yankees, but Chris Hoiles's lead off home run in the third again cut their lead to one. Paul O'Neill's two-run home in the fourth extended the Yankees' lead to 5‚Äì2, but in the bottom of the inning, Rogers allowed a walk and single to put runners on first and third with no outs for the Orioles. David Weathers in relief allowed an RBI single to B.J. Surhoff and groundout to Hoiles that again cut the Yankees' lead to one. Weathers and three relieved held Baltimore scoreless for the rest of the game while the Yankees padded their lead in the eighth. Williams hit a one-out double off Alan Mills, who was relieved by Jesse Orosco. After Tino Martinez singled, Armando Benitez relieved Orosco and allowed an RBI groundout to Cecil Fielder before Strawberry's second home run of the game made it 8‚Äì4 Yankees. The Orioles in the bottom of the inning hit three straight leadoff singles to load the bases with no outs off Mariano Rivera, who struck out Hoiles and Brady Anderson, then got Todd Zeile to pop up to short to end the inning. John Wetteland retired the Orioles in order in the ninth to give the Yankees a 3‚Äì1 series lead. =Game 5= Sunday, October 13, 1996, at Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore, Maryland The Yankees clinched the series with a six-run third off Scott Erickson. Jim Leyritz led off the inning with a home run, then Derek Jeter and Wade Boggs hit consecutive one-out singles. Second baseman Roberto Alomar's error on Bernie Williams's ground ball let Jeter score and put runners on first and third. After Tino Martinez hit into a fielder's choice at home, Cecil Fielder's three-run home run put the Yankees up 5‚Äì0. Darryl Strawberry's home run then made it 6‚Äì0. Though Erickson and three relievers held the Yankees scoreless for the rest of the game, Andy Pettitte pitched shutout innings before Todd Zeile's home run in the sixth put the Orioles on the board. Eddie Murray's leadoff home run in the eighth made it 6‚Äì2 Yankees. In the ninth, John Wetteland relieved Pettitte and allowed a two-out two-run home run to Bobby Bonilla before Cal Ripken grounded out to end the series and send the Yankees to the World Series for the first time since 1981.

He was one of the important founders of the United Democrats of Hong Kong (later called the Democratic Party), a member of the Tuen Mun District Council, an elected member of the Regional Council and the youngest member of the legislative council to die in office. He was a supporter for the protesters of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 in Beijing, China, and is best-remembered for leading a supporting crowd with a flag during the protest in Hong Kong in support of the Chinese protest . A writer for Breakthrough Magazine (; a Christian magazine published in Hong Kong during 1973 and 1999), Lee Wing-Tat was Ng's ally inside the party and the one who carried his portrait during his funeral, who won the office as the Democratic Party chairman later in 2004. Political career Ng was a teacher in a secondary school. In 1971, he joined the demonstration asserting China's territorial rights over the Diaoyutai Islands. He was also active in the \\"Anti-corruption, Arrest Godber\\" movement in 1973. In the 1980s, he was deeply involved in the Meeting Point pressure group. He became a district councillor in Tuen Mun from 1985. =1985 attack incident= On 11 October 1985, he was assaulted by about 10 villagers in Tuen Mun while he was greeting them, he was seriously injured. 4 people was arrested and two of them were jailed. As it was the first time a pro-democracy district councillor was assaulted, it caused widespread concern in Hong Kong. It is also a direct reason that Ng gained 70% of the votes in his district against the pro-Beijings in the Regional Council Election in 1986.Sing Tao news site =Legislative councillor= He united many students and teachers to support the Tiananmen Square protesters in Beijing and was part of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China and became a central committee member of the United Democrats of Hong Kong when it was formed in 1991. Ng was elected to be a member of the legislative council (LegCo) in 1991. He was one of the hardworking members of the LegCo, putting forward many suggestions to the government in his short term as a member. He strongly opposed the proposal of the government for reduction of number of classes in schools and the spending saving planson education. Ng helped to unite the Education functional constituency together for a candlelight vigil around the LegCo to increase political pressure to the government. Although the pro-Beijing members and some of the pro-London members voted in favour of the proposal, this plan was finally cancelled in 1993. Illness and death Even though he was diagnosed with blood cancer in February 1992, he still worked for long hours. He suggested many useful ideas to benefit the public while he was in hospital. Even as his health deteriorated, on 4 June 1992 he attended a candlelight vigil in memory of the people who was killed during the Tiananmen massacre three years ago. He died shortly after he fainted during a fund raising campaign on 22 June 1992. Members of the LegCo observed a brief moment of silence before the legislature sitting in his memory two days later. He was the only LegCo member ever to receive this honour. He was survived with his wife, a son and a daughter.

It was a great victory for the Welsh under Owain Glynd≈µr, and it resulted in the prolongation of the Welsh war of independence and the destabilisation of English politics for several years afterward. Background Owain Glynd≈µr's war of independence occurred against a background of instability in the English monarchy. King Richard II of England had become alienated from many of the nobles, and had been overthrown by Henry Bolingbroke, the Duke of Lancaster, who became Henry IV of England. In Wales and the Welsh Marches, there were still many supporters of the deposed Richard, who died in captivity in 1400. In that year, Reginald Grey, 3rd Baron Grey de Ruthyn, a supporter of the new King Henry, had unlawfully seized some of Glyndwr's lands and falsely caused charges of treason to be brought against him. In response, Glyndwr declared himself the true Prince of Wales, and began a rebellion. After Glyndwr gained early successes in 1400, King Henry led a punitive expedition into north Wales and appeared to have suppressed the revolt.Davies, p. 103 However, Glyndwr remained at large, and anti-Welsh legislation by Parliament ensured that few Welshmen had reason to support continued English rule. On 1 April 1401 (which was Good Friday), two brothers from Anglesey, Rhys ap Tudur and Gwilym ap Tudur, seized Conwy Castle by trickery. Glyndwr himself won a victory over an army of English and Flemish settlers in Pembrokeshire at Mynydd Hyddgen in mid-Wales. These two events reinvigorated the rebellion. Henry led another punitive expedition into mid-Wales, but achieved nothing and his army suffered severely from bad weather. Early in 1402, Glyndwr's men ambushed and captured Grey of Ruthyn, who had indirectly caused the rebellion, and held him for ransom. In June, Glyndwr himself was near Knighton, and only from Leominster, then an important English garrison and market town in the Welsh Marches. King Henry had appointed Henry Percy, widely known as \\"Hotspur\\", as his principal lieutenant and justiciar in North Wales and the adjacent Marches. Hotspur's uncle, the Earl of Worcester, held a similar appointment in the south.Davies, p. 240 However, the force which confronted Glyndwr near Knighton was a county levy of Herefordshire under Sir Edmund Mortimer. Mortimer was uncle of the young Edmund de Mortimer, 5th Earl of March, and either of them had a better hereditary claim to be King of England than Henry. (The childless Richard II had declared Sir Edmund's brother and the young Edmund's father, Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March to be heir apparent to the crown, but Roger had died the year before Richard was overthrown and none of the nobles supported his son's claim.) However, Sir Edmund Mortimer had so far loyally supported the new king. In any case, as a substantial holder of lands in Wales and on the borders, Mortimer had already suffered from the depredations of Glynd≈µr's rebels and appeared to have much to lose should the revolt continue.Warner, pp. 48‚Äì49 Battle There were few contemporary sources for details of the battle, and some, such as that of Adam of Usk, contained inaccuracies. Most details must, therefore, be assumptions, although the ground remains largely unchanged and provides a reasonable basis for them. The Wigmore Chronicle says the battle site was ‚Äòupon the hill called Bryn Glas in Maelienydd near Knighton‚Äô. Nicholas Bysshop wrote in about c.1432, that it was ‚Äòon a hill with a spring and on the right side of an adjacent hill‚Äô (Graig Hill) and the Prose Brut locates it ‚Äòon the Blacke Hyll‚Äô (Black Hill). Mortimer's army was seeking to bring Glynd≈µr's smaller army to battle. Although the location was only just inside Wales, Glynd≈µr undoubtedly had many local informants and sympathisers and could plan a decisive battle. Probably, he had also been able to summon reinforcements from other parts of Wales, which moved rapidly over hill tracks, and was therefore far stronger than Mortimer realised.Davies, pp. 22, 231 Though always a risky tactic, Glyndwr divided his army. Part of the army, including many archers armed with the powerful longbow, was placed on the slopes of the hill. The remainder were concealed in a valley to the left of the hill, camouflaged by thick foliage. Mortimer's army formed up and advanced up the slope, against the Welsh archers clearly in view. With the advantage of height, Glyndwr's archers outranged Mortimer's (themselves armed with longbows). As Mortimer's men-at-arms tried to close with Glyndwr's archers, the Welsh troops who had been concealed in the valley emerged to attack Mortimer's right flank and rear. At some stage, contingents of Welsh archers in Mortimer's army defected, and loosed arrows against their former comrades. It is not known whether their defection was planned in advance, or whether they chose to back Glyndwr in the middle of the battle as the likely winner. Their action contributed to the confusion of Mortimer's army which, attacked from the steep slopes above, and from their flank and rear, was destroyed. Among those killed were Sir Walter Devereaux of Weobley, and Sir Robert Whitney, who was Henry IV's Knight-Marshal.Warner, p.50 Aftermath It was claimed by contemporary accounts that immediately after the battle, many English corpses were mutilated by Welsh women camp followers,Davies, p. 157 in revenge for the punitive expeditions by Henry IV in the previous years, which had been marked by many acts of brutality and rape. Whether these mutilations took place remains open to debate, as some historians, including Philip Warner, suggest it was a story perpetrated by the English parliament to portray the Welsh as savages. The English dead lay unburied, and the stench caused the area to be avoided for months. The battle was one of the greatest Welsh victories against an English army in the open field. News of it brought many Welshmen who had hitherto been undecided to openly support Glyndwr.Davies, p. 231 On the English side, it resulted in some panicked appointments of officers and hasty reinforcements of garrisons all over Wales. Mortimer was captured in the battle. Henry (who was in financial difficulties) made no effort to ransom him. Mortimer subsequently renounced his allegiance to King Henry IV, put forward his nephew's claim to the throne of England, and married Glynd≈µr's daughter Catrin. The battle is mentioned by William Shakespeare in Henry IV, Part 1 : Archaeological survey The Welsh Battlefields Survey carried out by the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales (RCAHMW) said that it is not possible to identify the exact location of the battle from the available documentary and archaeological evidence. Archaeological work carried out in 2012 found no evidence of the battle on Bryn Glas. RCAHMW says that the battle site is likely to be near Bryn Glas and the two neighbouring hills. The contemporary site St Mary's Church, Pilleth St St Mary's church at Pilleth stands on Bryn Glas and predates the battle. In the grounds of the church is a spring-fed well. There is limited parking available at the church. A stand of Wellingtonia was planted to mark the site where the remains of those killed in the battle are said to have been buried.

In fiction  The battle is described in Chapter XV, entitled 'Bryn Glas', of John Cowper Powys's historical novel 'Owen Glendower' (1941).

The club was formed in 1965 through the merger of Bonner FV and Tura Bonn. Its former women's football department won the German national championship in 1975. History Bonner FV was founded in 1901 and was known early on as the \\"Club of Academics\\" because many of its leaders and members were teachers and professors. The side achieved good results as a tier II team prior to World War II, playing in the tier one Gauliga Mittelrhein at times. In 1959, FV won the Verbandsliga Mittelrhein (III) championship and moved up to 2nd Oberliga West (Division Two West). Tura was formed in 1925 through a merger of the clubs FC Normannia and FC Borussia and drew its membership from the working class. The combined side's lineage also included the club FC Regina Bonn founded in 1904. Like Bonner FV, Tura played as a tier II team and their greatest success was in winning the 1962 west German amateur championship and their subsequent appearance in the national amateur final, which they lost 0:1 to SC Tegel. Since its founding in 1965, Bonner SC has played as a tier III or IV side except for a handful of seasons spent in various level II leagues between 1966‚Äì67 and 1976‚Äì77. =Cuban connection= In 1999, the club drew a lot of attention when then owner Hans-Robert Viol signed the complete Cuba national football team for the remainder of the season with the approval of Cuban leader Fidel Castro, who ordered the players to remain amateurs and only be paid pocket money.The Cubans are coming ‚Äì The Guardian They were the first 15 Cuban football players to have a spell abroad during the Castro regime and only four of them were expected to play in the Germans fourth tier side.Quince futbolistas cubanos, prestados al Bonner, de la 4¬™ divisi√≥n alemana ‚Äì El Pa√≠s In 2000‚Äì01, they fell as low as Verbandsliga Mittelrhein (V). Despite the drought of success, Bonner SC were able to muster-up a phenomenal season in the NRW-Liga in the 2008‚Äì09 season and become champions leading to their promotion back to the Regionalliga for the 2009‚Äì10 Season. The club had to declare insolvency in July 2010 and was therefore unable to enter the Regionalliga. The team, Euro 7 million in debt, was also barred from entering the NRW-Liga as it could not provide the necessary guarantees to prove it would be able to survive financially. Having declared insolvency after the start of the new season, the side could only enter the league below, the Mittelrheinliga, under the condition of being automatically relegated at the end of season, which it declined and paused for a year. Bonner SC entered the tier seven Landesliga Mittelrhein 1 for the 2011‚Äì12 season.Bei Insolvenz ein Jahr Pause www.reviersport.de, published: 18 July 2010, accessed: 19 August 2011 From 2014 to 2016 Bonner SC played in the fifth tier of the league system, the Mittelrheinliga.

It is found in the cuisines of the former Ottoman Empire from the Middle East to Southeastern Europe. Terminology and etymology Sarma is a Turkish word meaning 'wrapped'.Engin Akin, Essential Turkish Cuisine, 2015, , s.v. \\"Dolma and Sarma\\" Sarma made with vine leaves are called () or () in Turkey, () in Azerbaijan, and (, ) in Iran and waraq 'inab (Ÿàÿ±ŸÇ ÿπŸÜÿ®) or waraq dawƒÅlƒ´ (Ÿàÿ±ŸÇ ÿØŸàÿßŸÑŸä) in Arabic. In Armenia, they are called missov derevapatat, derevi dolma and derevi sarma. In Greek language they are called Œ≥ŒπŒ±œÄœÅŒ¨Œ∫ŒπŒ± yaprakia, Œ≥ŒπŒ±œÄœÅŒ¨Œ∫ŒπŒ± Œ≥ŒπŒ±ŒªŒ±ŒΩœÑŒ∂ŒØ yaprakia yalandzi, ŒΩœÑŒøŒªŒºŒ¨Œ¥ŒµœÇ dolmadhes, ŒΩœÑŒøŒªŒºŒ±Œ¥Œ¨Œ∫ŒπŒ± dolmadhakia, ŒΩœÑŒøŒªŒºŒ±Œ¥Œ¨Œ∫ŒπŒ± Œ≥ŒπŒ±ŒªŒ±ŒΩœÑŒ∂ŒØ dolmadhakia yalandzi, œÉŒ±œÅŒºŒ¨Œ¥ŒµœÇ sarmadhes, or œÉŒ±œÅŒºŒ±Œ¥Œ±Œ∫ŒπŒ± sarmadhakia. In Bulgarian and Romanian, cabbage and vine leaves are not usually differentiated. Stuffed chard leaves are called pazƒ± dolmasƒ± in Turkey and dolmas de pazi by Sephardi Jews who settled in Argentina. Background A vine leaf roll is a dish consisting of cooked grape-vine leaves wrapped around a variety of fillings. Stuffed vine leaves without meat are sometimes called yalancƒ± dolma, which means \\"liar's dolma\\" in Turkish. Vi≈üneli yalancƒ± dolmasƒ± is a variation of stuffed vine leaves where the rice is seasoned with cinnamon, allspice and mint. The dolmas are slowly cooked together with morello cherries (vi≈üne), and plums may be used also. Vine leaves may also be used to wrap stuffed celery root. Before wrapping, the celery root is stuffed with rice that has been seasoned with cinnamon, salt, pepper, allspice, pine nuts and sugar. (This type of rice is called i√ß pilav.) Dried fruits like fig and apricot may be added to the rice mixture before the celery root is stuffed, wrapped and baked in the oven. Some variations may include quince.  Regional and national variants  =Amasya and Tokat= In the Turkish provinces of Amasya and Tokat sarma is prepared in a style similar to maklouba, with different fillings. One version made with fava beans is called bakla sarma. The filling for this variant from Amasya is made with dried fava beans and a coarsely ground wheat called yarma. Tomato paste, water, sunflower oil, chopped onion, aleppo pepper and spices are added to complete the mixture. Bone-in lamb chops are tightly layered on the bottom of the pot and the wrapped sarma are added on top of the lamb. Butter is added on top and the sarma are cooked together with the lamb chops in water. The finished dish is served upside down. A similar variation from Tokat is stuffed with a lentil, bulgur and chickpea filling. Homemade red pepper paste may be substituted for some of the tomato paste. =Romania and Moldova= In Romania and Moldova, sarmale is popular in all historical regions, Moldavia, Transylvania, and Wallachia. It usually consists of minced pork, rice, onion, eggs, thyme and dill rolled in a leaf, usually a cabbage leaf. The baking dish is lined with chopped cabbage and sauerkraut layered with bacon or pork belly and the cabbage rolls, then topped with more sauerkraut and dill sprigs. The cooking water is poured over the assembled tray, a mixture of sauerkraut juice and seasonings. It is typically accompanied by mƒÉmƒÉligƒÉ (polenta) and sm√¢nt√¢nƒÉ (sour cream). It's a traditional dish to be served for Easter and Christmas meals. =Serbia= In Serbia a vegetarian version of stuffed cabbage rolls is one of the dishes that can be eaten during the observance of Lent.
