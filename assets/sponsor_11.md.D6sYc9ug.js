The war was fought between two different factions within the Choctaw over what the tribes's trade relations with Great Britain and France should be. Hundreds of Choctaw peoples died in the war and the pro-French faction retained their influence within the Choctaw nation.  Background  Residing in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama, by the early 18th century the Choctaw people were under threat from a number of regional rivals. The Choctaw warred intermittently with the Chickasaw to the north, while the Muscogee-Creek frequently raided the western Choctaw territories, with both tribes enslaving thousands of Choctaws for use as laborers in the West Indies.Brescia, William (Bill) (1982). \\"Chapter 2, French-Choctaw Contact, 1680s‚Äì1763\\".

Faced with these threats, the Choctaw themselves began to militarize, and, using money brought in from the growing fur trade, began to buy firearms from French colonists who had settled in Louisiana.Struggle and Survival in Colonial America By David G. Sweet, Gary B. Nash Edition: illustrated Published by University of California Press, 1982 , . Pp. 49‚Äì67. The Choctaw also organized themselves into rough political units described as \\"divisions\\". Two divisions eventually rose to dominate Choctaw politics, the Eastern Division (the Okla Tannap, or People of the Opposite Side) and the Western Division (the Okla Falaya, the Long People). A third, smaller division (the Okla Hannali, the People of Sixtowns) known as the Southern Division also existed, but its members often isolated themselves from the affairs of the other two divisions or remained neutral. Friendly relations between the Choctaw and the French colonists of Louisiana continued into the 1730s; the Choctaw saw the French as a valuable economic partner (trading furs for guns, offering guides for hire, and as a market for enslaved prisoners), while the French viewed their alliance with the Choctaw as vital to the defense of lower Louisiana from Britain and its Chickasaw allies. British merchants attempted to establish trade relations with the Eastern Division in 1731, but this effort failed when another war broke out between the Choctaw and the Chickasaw later that year. Despite this failure, the French feared that Britain was attempting to destabilize the French alliance with the Choctaw. As such, the French greatly strengthened their military ties to the Choctaw, building Fort Tombecbe in Choctaw territory and conducting a joint Choctaw‚ÄìFrench expedition to destroy Chickasaw villages on the Tombigbee river in 1736. By the late 1730s the Choctaw military situation had stabilized (fighting would continue against the remaining Chickasaw into the 1760s),Atkinson, James R. (2004). Splendid Land, Splendid People. University of Alabama Press. . pp. 25‚Äì87 and the fur trade continued to increase the wealth of the Choctaw people. The various tribes remained on friendly terms with the French, while the British were tolerated. By 1740, the Choctaw numbered some 12,000 people living in around 50 villages.  Civil War  During the wars with the Chickasaw, a Choctaw warrior known as Red Shoes rose to prominence. Although he was not born into one of the hereditary chiefdoms that made up the Choctaw nation, Red Shoes was able to rise to the position of war-captain due to his war-won fame. He eventually became chief of the town of Couechitto, which soon grew wealthy due to its involvement with the fur trade. However, after several years of lackluster trading with the French, Red Shoes decided to enter trade negotiations with the British. Red Shoe's trading with the British threatened to damage the tribe's relations with the French, and when it was discovered the chief was widely chastised by other Choctaw leaders. However, Red Shoes continued to trade with the British, even going so far as to lead a delegation to Charleston.Foret, Michael J. \\"War or Peace?

Accessed April 29, 2020. www.jstor.org/stable/4232807. Red Shoes found that the British were willing to sell guns and other goods to the Choctaw at lower prices than the French were, and soon the chief (who was affiliated with the Western Division) was able to further increase his political power. Though he had fought alongside the French against the Chickasaw, his observation of the French Tombigbee expedition (which had suffered heavy casualties) convinced him that the Louisiana colony was militarily weak. He also considered allying his large tribe with British colonists in the Carolinas. In addition, Red Shoes sought to enter peace negotiations with the Chickasaw, an idea which many Choctaw and French leaders strongly opposed.USNER, DANIEL H. \\"THE INDIAN ALLIANCE NETWORK OF A MARGINAL EUROPEAN COLONY.\\" In Indians, Settlers, and Slaves in a Frontier Exchange Economy: The Lower Mississippi Valley Before 1783, 77-104.

Red Shoes' shift in policy and growing political power caused political discord within the Choctaw, and by the late 1730s tensions were rising between the eastern and western divisions.Galloway, Patricia. \\"THE BARTHELEMY MURDERS: BIENVILLE'S ESTABLISHMENT OF THE \\"LEX TALIONIS\\" AS A PRINCIPLE OF INDIAN DIPLOMACY.\\" Proceedings of the Meeting of the French Colonial Historical Society 8 (1985): 91-103. Accessed April 29, 2020. www.jstor.org/stable/42952133. Small-scale fighting between Choctaw villages began in November 1739, and while this was quickly stopped through inter-tribal mediation it showed the increasing divides in Choctaw society. 1742 was a bloody year in the war against the Chickasaw, and a smallpox outbreak in the summer of that year killed many Choctaw children and elders. Fields went unattended - many farmers having been recruited for war parties - leading to a food shortage, and the movement of Choctaw warriors throughout the people's territory helped to spread disease. Further exacerbating these issues, in 1745 a newly-appointed French governor of Louisiana - seeking to cut colony expenses - decreased the annual gifts given to the Choctaw leaders and imposed new trading restrictions on French manufactured goods. These changes harmed the longstanding Choctaw-French trade, and further convinced the Western Division that the British would make better trading partners. In 1746, a trio of French traders in Couechitto were captured and executed (possibly in retaliation for a rape) by warriors loyal to Red Shoes. Soon after, the Western Division expelled all traders from their territory. This development greatly angered the Eastern Division and their French allies, and leaders from the two groups soon met to discuss military action against the Western Division. The French also sent envoys to the Western Division, but were told by pro-French chiefs that they lacked the power to destroy Red Shoes and his pro-British supporters. With war imminent, the French conspired to assassinate the Red Shoes, offering a large bounty on him. On the night of 23 June 1747 a young Choctaw warrior acting as an escort for a British merchant assassinated Red Shoes in his sleep, plunging Red Shoe's tribe into chaos. His faction did not dissolve, however, and when French complicity with the assassination was later discovered many tribes affiliated with the Western Division demanded revenge. The situation was further inflamed by the French, who demanded the deaths of two additional Western Division chiefs as recompense for the three slain Frenchmen. The eastern and western divisions did not attack each-other immediately, instead choosing to target their respective allies, but when a western-aligned chief was killed in an eastern raid on a British caravan, open war broke out. The first major action of the war came in July of 1748 when the Eastern Division launched a raid on Couechitto, Red Chief's former village. The war itself was bloody and chaotic, with both sides attacking each other's villages and towns. Raids were common, and due to the dispersed nature of Choctaw settlements, entire villages were often slaughtered before their respective division could arrive to aid them. Hundreds of Choctaws were killed. Both sides were armed by their respective European allies, with the British backing the Western Division and the French supporting the Eastern Division. Using Fort Tombecbe as a base, the French sent colonial troops to aid their eastern allies in battle, offering three times the pre-war price for enemy scalps. The Eastern Division possessed a numerical advantage over the Western Division, and this allowed the former faction to wear down their opponent through a brutal war of attrition. Benefiting from their pre-war diplomacy, the Western Division allied themselves with the Chakchiuma and the Chickasaw. With British support, the Western Division launched an unsuccessful attack on the key eastern- aligned town of Oulitacha that cost the lives of over 100 warriors from both sides. The Western Division won a few minor victories, but by 1750 a number of devastating raids had sapped the ability of the Western Division to wage war, and the disruption caused to the fur trade by the conflict had collapsed the economies of both factions. The Western Division was also running critically low on supplies, as the end of King George's War (1744‚Äì1748) had reduced the British need to destabilize French Louisiana; according to one anecdote given by a British trader, the Western Division was so short on ammunition they were resorting to firing glass beads. Faced with defeat, the Western Division signed a peace treaty in November 1750. The surviving Choctaw leaders concluded a treaty favorable to the Eastern Division and the French. Under the terms of said treaty, the Choctaw promised to avenge the death of any Frenchmen with the death of a rebel Choctaw, kill any remaining British merchants and their Choctaw sponsors, and continue the war against the Chickasaw. The Western Division was also forced to destroy fortified settlements in their territory and exchange prisoners. = Aftermath = The war left hundreds of Choctaws dead. Dozens of villages were destroyed, and many more were damaged or depopulated. With the Eastern Division established as the dominant force among the Choctaw people, the faction ended trade with Britain and returned to the pre-war trade with the French. However, the war also caused the Choctaw to re-evaluate their relations with the European powers; in the postwar years, the Choctaw adopted a flexible, pragmatic stance towards Britain, France, and Spain, eventually resulting the Choctaw supporting Britain in the Seven Years' War and both Britain and Spain during the American Revolutionary War.

In its most basic formulation it deals with a linear stochastic system :begin{align} dx & =A(t)x(t),dt+B_1(t)u(t),dt+B_2(t),dw  dy & =C(t)x(t),dt +D(t),dw end{align} with a state process x, an output process y and a control u, where w is a vector-valued Wiener process, x(0) is a zero-mean Gaussian random vector independent of w, y(0)=0, and A, B_1, B_2, C, D are matrix-valued functions which generally are taken to be continuous of bounded variation. Moreover, DD' is nonsingular on some interval [0,T]. The problem is to design an output feedback law pi:, y mapsto u which maps the observed process y to the control input u in a nonanticipatory manner so as to minimize the functional : J(u) = mathbb{E}left{ int_0^T x(t)'Q(t)x(t),dt+int_0^Tu(t)'R(t)u(t),dt +x(T)'Sx(T)right}, where mathbb{E} denotes expected value, prime (') denotes transpose. and Q and R are continuous matrix functions of bounded variation, Q(t) is positive semi- definite and R(t) is positive definite for all t. Under suitable conditions, which need to be properly stated, the optimal policy pi can be chosen in the form : u(t)=K(t)hat x(t), where hat x(t) is the linear least-squares estimate of the state vector x(t) obtained from the Kalman filter : dhat x=A(t)hat x(t),dt+B_1(t)u(t),dt +L(t)(dy-C(t)hat x(t),dt),quad hat x(0)=0, where K is the gain of the optimal linear-quadratic regulator obtained by taking B_2=D=0 and x(0) deterministic, and where L is the Kalman gain. There is also a non-Gaussian version of this problem (to be discussed below) where the Wiener process w is replaced by a more general square- integrable martingale with possible jumps.. In this case, the Kalman filter needs to be replace by a nonlinear filter providing an estimate of the (strict sense) conditional mean : hat{x}(t)= operatorname E{ x(t)mid {cal Y}_t}, where : {cal Y}_t:=sigma{ y(tau), tauin [0,t]}, quad 0leq tleq T, is the filtration generated by the output process; i.e., the family of increasing sigma fields representing the data as it is produced. In the early literature on the separation principle it was common to allow as admissible controls u all processes that are adapted to the filtration {{cal Y}_t, , 0leq tleq T}. This is equivalent to allowing all non- anticipatory Borel functions as feedback laws, which raises the question of existence of a unique solution to the equations of the feedback loop. Moreover, one needs to exclude the possibility that a nonlinear controller extracts more information from the data than what is possible with a linear control law.. Choices of the class of admissible control laws Linear- quadratic control problems are often solved by a completion-of-squares argument. In our present context we have : J(u)=operatorname{E}left{ int_0^T(u-Kx)'R(u-Kx) , dtright} +text{terms that do not depend on }u, in which the first term takes the form. :begin{align} operatorname{E}left{ int_0^T(u-Kx)'R(u-Kx),dtright}=operatorname{E}left{int_0^T[(u-Khat{x})'R(u-Khat{x})+operatorname{tr}(K'RKSigma)] , dtright}, end{align} where Sigma is the covariance matrix : Sigma(t):=operatorname{E}{[x(t)-hat{x}(t)][x(t)-hat{x}(t)]'}. The separation principle would now follow immediately if begin{align}Sigmaend{align} were independent of the control. However this needs to be established. The state equation can be integrated to take the form : x(t)=x_0(t)+int_0^t Phi(t,s)B_1(s)u(s) , ds, where x_0 is the state process obtained by setting u=0 and Phi is the transition matrix function. By linearity, hat{x}(t)=operatorname{E}{x(t)mid {cal Y}_t} equals : hat{x}(t)=hat{x}_0(t)+int_0^t Phi(t,s)B_1(s)u(s),ds, where hat{x}_0(t)=operatorname{E}{x_0(t)mid {cal Y}_t}. Consequently, : Sigma(t):=mathbb{E}{[x_0(t)-hat{x}_0(t)][x_0(t)-hat{x}_0(t)]'}, but we need to establish that begin{align}hat{x}_0end{align} does not depend on the control. This would be the case if : {cal Y}_t ={cal Y}_t^0:=sigma{ y_0(tau), tauin [0,t]}, quad 0leq tleq T, where y_0 is the output process obtained by setting u=0. This issue was discussed in detail by Lindquist. In fact, since the control process u is in general a nonlinear function of the data and thus non-Gaussian, then so is the output process y. To avoid these problems one might begin by uncoupling the feedback loop and determine an optimal control process in the class of stochastic processes u that are adapted to the family { {cal Y}_t^0} of sigma fields. This problem, where one optimizes over the class of all control processes adapted to a fixed filtration, is called a stochastic open loop (SOL) problem. It is not uncommon in the literature to assume from the outset that the control is adapted to { {mathcal Y}_t^0}; see, e.g., Section 2.3 in Bensoussan,. also van Handel and Willems.. In Lindquist 1973 a procedure was proposed for how to embed the class of admissible controls in various SOL classes in a problem-dependent manner, and then construct the corresponding feedback law. The largest class Pi of admissible feedback laws pi consists of the non- anticipatory functions u:=pi(y) such that the feedback equation has a unique solution and the corresponding control process u_pi is adapted to {{mathcal Y}_t^0}. Next, we give a few examples of specific classes of feedback laws that belong to this general class, as well as some other strategies in the literature to overcome the problems described above. =Linear control laws= The admissible class Pi of control laws could be restricted to contain only certain linear ones as in Davis.. More generally, the linear class : ({mathcal L})quad u(t)=bar{u}(t)+int_0^tF(t,tau),dy, where bar{u} is a deterministic function and F is an L_2 kernel, ensures that Sigma is independent of the control. In fact, the Gaussian property will then be preserved, and hat{x} will be generated by the Kalman filter. Then the error process tilde{x}:= x-hat{x} is generated by : dtilde{x}=(A-LC)tilde{x},dt +(B_2-LD),dw, quad tilde{x}(0)=x(0), which is clearly independent of the choice of control, and thus so is Sigma. =Lipschitz-continuous control laws= Wonham proved a separation theorem for controls in the class begin{align}pi:, u(t)=psi(t,hat{x}(t))end{align}, even for a more general cost functional than J(u). However, the proof is far from simple and there are many technical assumptions. For example, begin{align}C(t)end{align} must square and have a determinant bounded away from zero, which is a serious restriction. A later proof by Fleming and Rishel. is considerably simpler. They also prove the separation theorem with quadratic cost functional J(u) for a class of Lipschitz continuous feedback laws, namely u(t)=phi(t,y), where phi:, [0,T]times C^n [0,T]to{mathbb R}^m is a non-anticipatory function of y which is Lipschitz continuous in this argument. Kushner. proposed a more restricted class u(t)=psi(t,hat{xi}(t)), where the modified state process hat{xi} is given by : hat{xi}(t)=operatorname{E}{ x_0(t)mid {mathcal Y}_t^0}+ int_0^t Phi(t,s)B_1(s)u(s),ds, leading to the identity begin{align}hat{x}=hat{xi}end{align}. =Imposing delay= If there is a delay in the processing of the observed data so that, for each t, u(t) is a function of y(tau); , 0leqtauleq t-varepsilon, then {cal Y}_t ={cal Y}_t^0, 0leq tleq T, see Example 3 in Georgiou and Lindquist. Consequently, Sigma is independent of the control. Nevertheless, the control policy pi must be such that the feedback equations have a unique solution. Consequently, the problem with possibly control-dependent sigma fields does not occur in the usual discrete-time formulation. However, a procedure used in several textbooks to construct the continuous-time Sigma as the limit of finite difference quotients of the discrete-time Sigma, which does not depend on the control, is circular or a best incomplete; see Remark 4 in Georgiou and Lindquist. =Weak solutions= An approach introduced by Duncan and Varaiya. and Davis and Varaiya,. see also Section 2.4 in Bensoussan is based on weak solutions of the stochastic differential equation. Considering such solutions of : dx =A(t)x(t),dt+B_1(t)u(t),dt+B_2(t),dw we can change the probability measure (that depends on begin{align}uend{align}) via a Girsanov transformation so that : dtilde{w}:= B_1(t)u(t),dt+B_2(t),dw becomes a new Wiener process, which (under the new probability measure) can be assumed to be unaffected by the control. The question of how this could be implemented in an engineering system is left open. =Nonlinear filtering solutions= Although a nonlinear control law will produce a non-Gaussian state process, it can be shown, using nonlinear filtering theory (Chapters 16.1 in Lipster and Shirayev. ), that the state process is conditionally Gaussian given the filtration begin{align}{{mathcal Y}_t}end{align}. This fact can be used to show that begin{align}hat{x}end{align} is actually generated by a Kalman filter (see Chapters 11 and 12 in Lipster and Shirayev). However, this requires quite a sophisticated analysis and is restricted to the case where the driving noise begin{align}wend{align} is a Wiener process. Additional historical perspective can be found in Mitter.. Issues on feedback in linear stochastic systems At this point it is suitable to consider a more general class of controlled linear stochastic systems that also covers systems with time delays, namely :begin{align} z(t) & =z_0(t) + int_0^t G(t,s)u(s),ds  y(t) & = Hz(t) end{align} with begin{align}z_0end{align} a stochastic vector process which does not depend on the control. The standard stochastic system is then obtained as a special case where z=[x',y']', z_0=[x_0',y_0']' and H=[I,0]. We shall use the short-hand notation : z=z_0+gpi Hz for the feedback system, where : g;:; (t,u) mapsto int_0^t G(t,tau)u(tau),dtau is a Volterra operator. In this more general formulation the embedding procedure of Lindquist defines the class Pi of admissible feedback laws pi as the class of non-anticipatory functions u:=pi(y) such that the feedback equation z=z_0+gpi Hz has a unique solution z_pi and u=pi(Hz_pi) is adapted to {{mathcal Y}_t^0}. In Georgiou and Lindquist a new framework for the separation principle was proposed. This approach considers stochastic systems as well-defined maps between sample paths rather than between stochastic processes and allows us to extend the separation principle to systems driven by martingales with possible jumps. The approach is motivated by engineering thinking where systems and feedback loops process signals, and not stochastic processes per se or transformations of probability measures. Hence the purpose is to create a natural class of admissible control laws that make engineering sense, including those that are nonlinear and discontinuous. The feedback equation z=z_0+gpi Hz has a unique strong solution if there exists a non-anticipating function F such that z=F(z_0) satisfies the equation with probability one and all other solutions coincide with z with probability one. However, in the sample-wise setting, more is required, namely that such a unique solution exists and that z=z_0+gpi Hz holds for all z_0, not just almost all. The resulting feedback loop is deterministically well-posedin the sense that the feedback equations admit a unique solution that causally depends on the input for each input sample path. In this context, a signal is defined to be a sample path of a stochastic process with possible discontinuities. More precisely, signals will belong to the Skorohod space D, i.e., the space of functions which are continuous on the right and have a left limit at all points (c√†dl√†g functions). In particular, the space C of continuous functions is a proper subspace of D. Hence the response of a typical nonlinear operation that involves thresholding and switching can be modeled as a signal. The same goes for sample paths of counting processes and other martingales. A system is defined to be a measurable non-anticipatory map Dto D sending sample paths to sample paths so that their outputs at any time t is a measurable function of past values of the input and time. For example, stochastic differential equations with Lipschitz coefficients driven by a Wiener process induce maps between corresponding path spaces, see page 127 in Rogers and Williams,. and pages 126-128 in Klebaner.. Also, under fairly general conditions (see e.g., Chapter V in Protter.), stochastic differential equations driven by martingales with sample paths in D have strong solutions who are semi-martingales. For the time setting f(z):=gpi Hz, the feedback system z=z_0+gpi Hz can be written z=z_0+f(z), where z_0 can be interpreted as an input. Definition. A feedback loop z=z_0+f(z) is deterministically well- posed if it has a unique solution zin D for all inputs z_0in D and (1-f)^{-1} is a system. This implies that the processes z and z_0 define identical filtrations. Consequently, no new information is created by the loop. However, what we need is that {cal Y}_t ={cal Y}_t^0 for 0leq tleq T. This is ensured by the following lemma (Lemma 8 in Georgiou and Lindquist). Key Lemma. If the feedback loop z=z_0+gpi Hz is deterministically well-posed, gpi is a system, and H is a linear system having a right inverse H^{-R} that is also a system, then (1-Hgpi)^{-1} is a system and {cal Y}_t ={cal Y}_t^0 for 0leq tleq T. The condition on H in this lemma is clearly satisfied in the standard linear stochastic system, for which H=[0,I], and hence H^{-R}=H'. The remauining conditions are collected in the following definition. Definition. A feedback law pi is deterministically well-posed for the system z=z_0+gpi Hz if gpi is a system and the feedback system z=z_0+gpi Hz deterministically well-posed. Examples of simple systems that are not deterministically well-posed are given in Remark 12 in Georgiou and Lindquist. A separation principle for physically realizable control laws By only considering feedback laws that are deterministically well-posed, all admissible control laws are physically realizable in the engineering sense that they induce a signal that travels through the feedback loop. The proof of the following theorem can be found in Georgiou and Lindquist 2013. Separation theorem. Given the linear stochastic system : begin{align} dx & =A(t)x(t),dt+B_1(t)u(t),dt+B_2(t),dw  dy & =C(t)x(t),dt +D(t),dw end{align} where w is a vector-valued Wiener process, x(0) is a zero-mean Gaussian random vector independent of w, consider the problem of minimizing the quadratic functional J(u) over the class of all deterministically well- posed feedback laws pi. Then the unique optimal control law is given by u(t)=K(t)hat{x}(t) where K is defined as above and hat{x} is given by the Kalman filter. More generally, if w is a square-integrable martingale and x(0) is an arbitrary zero mean random vector, u(t)=K(t)hat{x}(t), where hat{x}(t)=operatorname{E}{x(t)mid {cal Y}_t}, is the optimal control law provided it is deterministically well-posed. In the general non-Gaussian case, which may involve counting processes, the Kalman filter needs to be replaced by an nonlinear filter. A Separation principle for delay- differential systems Stochastic control for time-delay systems were first studied in Lindquist,.. and Brooks,. although Brooks relies on the strong assumption that the observation y is functionally independent of the control u, thus avoiding the key question of feedback. Consider the delay-differential system :begin{align} dx &=left(int_{t-h}^t d_s,A(t,s)x(s)right) ,dt + B_1(t)u(t),dt+B_2(t),dw  dy & =left(int_{t-h}^t d_s,C(t,s)x(s)right) ,dt +D(t),dw end{align} where w is now a (square-integrable) Gaussian (vector) martingale, and where begin{align}Aend{align} and C are of bounded variation in the first argument and continuous on the right in the second, x(t)=xi(t) is deterministic for -hleq tleq 0, and y(0)=0. More precisely, A(t,s)=0 for sgeq t, A(t,s)=A(t,t-h) for tleq t-h, and the total variation of smapsto A(t,s) is bounded by an integrable function in the variable t, and the same holds for C. We want to determine a control law which minimizes : J(u)=operatorname{E}left(int_0^T x(t)'Q(t)x(t),dalpha(t)+int_0^Tu(t)'R(t)u(t),dtright), where begin{align}dalphaend{align} is a positive Stieltjes measure. The corresponding deterministic problem obtained by setting begin{align}w=0end{align} is given by : u(t)=int_{t-h}^t d_tau , K(t,tau)x(tau), with begin{align}Kend{align}.

He was a professor of linguistics and the classics at Harvard University and after retirement went to serve as professor-in-residence at UCLA.  Early life  = Family = Calvert Watkins was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on March 13, 1933 to Ralph James Watkins, an economist and government advisor, and Willye Ward, a Spanish teacher who translated the personal memoirs of former Mexican president Gen. Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna. Much of Watkins's childhood was spent in New York City, and he graduated from Friends Seminary in Manhattan before beginning his career at Harvard University. Watkins's early exposure to Latin and Greek inspired him at the age of fifteen to decide to become an Indo-Europeanist. = Education = Watkins received his initial undergraduate degree from Harvard University in 1954, graduating summa cum laude, and his Ph.D in Linguistics in 1959. During his time at Harvard, Watkins also studied abroad at the √âcole Pratique des Hautes √âtudes in Paris, France from 1954 to 1955 as well as the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, School of Celtic Studies from 1957 to 1958.  Career  = Harvard = In 1959, Watkins was initially appointed the position of instructor at Harvard University. He later became assistant professor in 1960, associate professor with tenure in 1962, and full professor in 1966. In 1989 Watkins was appointed to the position of Victor. S Thomas Professor of Linguistics and Classics. Linguists influenced by Watkins during his tenure at Harvard include Goddard, Jasanoff, D. Gary Miller, Michael Silverstein, Alice Harris, H. Craig Melchert, Alan Nussbaum, Brent Vine, Mark Hale, Andrew Garrett, Joshua Katz and Benjamin Fortson. Watkins remained dedicated to the research and development of historical linguistics throughout his entire academic and professional career. In 1982 he was a founding member of the \\"East Coast Indo- European Conference\\" in which he participated in a large majority of its annual meetings. = University of California, Los Angeles = Upon his retirement from Harvard in 2003, Watkins moved to Los Angeles, California and began teaching at the University of California, Los Angeles alongside his wife, Stephanie Jamison. Watkins continued to promote the importance of historical linguistics at UCLA by remaining active in the annual UCLA Indo- European Conference. In 2013, the 25th annual conference was dedicated to the memory of Watkins. = Early published works = His doctoral dissertation at Harvard University, Indo-European Origins of the Celtic Verb I. The Sigmatic Aorist (Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1962), which deeply reflected the structuralist approach of Jerzy Kury≈Çowicz, opened a fresh era of creative work in Celtic comparative linguistics and the study of the verbal system of Indo-European languages. Watkins, in a sense, completed his contribution to this area with his Indogermanische Grammatik, vol. 3, part 1: Geschichte der indogermanischen Verbalflexion (1969). Meanwhile, his work on Indo-European vocabulary and poetics yielded a large number of articles on (among others) Celtic, Anatolian, Greek, Italic and Indo-Iranian material, presented directly in his Selected Writings and indirectly in his book, How to Kill a Dragon: Aspects of Indo-European Poetics (Oxford University Press, 1995). He contributed his expertise on Indo-European languages to the first edition of The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language and edited The American Heritage Dictionary of Indo-European Roots(). He also pointed out that of all the Celtic languages, Old Irish is the closest match to the theorized Proto-Indo European mother tongue and that Old Irish represents an extraordinary ancient language who‚Äôs the structure can only be compared with that of Vedic Sanskrit. = How to Kill a Dragon: Aspects of Indo-European Poetics = How to Kill a Dragon: Aspects of Indo-European Poetics was published on November 16, 1995 through Oxford University Press and attempted to establish a formulaic method of comparative linguistics which exemplified the importance of the poetic formula in order to better trace the development of Indo-European languages by working backwards and identifying patterns from their mother language, Proto-Indo-European. The book is divided into two main halves, the first of which acts as a definition and introduction the study of Indo-European poetics which is expanded upon by implementing Watkins' idea of the \\"dragon-slaying myth\\" and defending this concept through a number of case studies involving languages connected by a common theme. Watkins expands upon the \\"dragon-slaying myth\\" in part two of the text by offering new research into his proposed formula of \\"HERO SLAY SERPENT\\", he also attempts to reconstruct an example of Proto-Indo-European through the comparative method of historical linguistics. Lingua Franca reviewer Marc L'Heureux commented that Watkins also implements historical evidence to favor the development of language such as the relationship between the patron and the poet. He further opined that through the ceremonious delivery from the poet, the word choices became preserved as historical evidence of the language in question. Thus the poet was not only a wielder of great power, according to Watkins as the patron's prestige was inherently tied to the poet's prowess, but a recorder of language that has allowed for research to be conducted in order to better understand the development of ancient languages. How to Kill a Dragon received favorable acclaim and is now considered to be a definitive text which transformed the study of Indo-European poetics. How to Kill a Dragon earned Watkins the 1998 Goodwin Award for Classical Studies. = Legacy and awards = * Honorary Member of the Royal Irish Academy (1968) * Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1973) * Member of the American Philosophical Society (1975) * Senior Fellowship for Independent Study and Research from the National Endowment for the Humanities (1984‚Äì85) * Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy (1987) * Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, Correspondant Etranger (1990) * Guggenheim Fellowships for demonstration of exceptional capacity for productive scholarship and exceptional creative ability in the arts in the field of linguistics (1991) * Goodwin Award for Classical Studies for How to Kill a Dragon (1998) * President of the Linguistic Society of America in 1988 * Associ√© Etranger, Membre de l'Institut (1999)  Death  Calvert Watkins died in his sleep at the age of 80 in Los Angeles, California on March 20, 2013.

It was shot in 1969 and was produced by Grahame Jennings and directed by John Alaimo. It runs for 49 minutes. Plot In the 1990s, two men are trapped in a nuclear missile silo with war looming. Cast *Jack Thompson *Owen Weingott Production The film was based on an original TV play by Mosman writer Gregory Marton which had first been conceived as a stage play. In 1965 he sent it to the ABC but did not hear back from them. He began negotiations with companies in Europe to make it and ask for it back. The play won a Merit Award at the first Australian Writers Guild Awards in March 1968 and sold to West Germany for $1,000. The Sydney Morning Herald wrote an article about this in 1968 prompting revived interest in the play. The German version was shot in Hamburg and shown throughout Europe on German speaking networks. An Australian version was filmed in Sydney, produced and directed by Grahame Jennings. By August 1969 the Australian version had been sold to the US (the National Educational Television Network), Canada and the BBC but it had not been shown on Australian TV. To give it at some audience, it was screened at the Gala Cinema in Sydney. Jennings said, \\"We feel that an important issue is at stake here, that a critical point has been reached in the production of drama by Australians for Australian television.\\" When the film aired in the cinema, the Sydney Morning Herald called it \\"tense, scary fare right out of the Twilight Zone and very much belongs to the small screen.\\" In 1972 the show aired on ATN Sydney.

In 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that around 214 million women around the world wanted to avoid pregnancy but were not currently using any method of contraception or family planning. Family planning programs, especially in terms of development, seek to promote women making autonomous reproductive choices about the size of their family, the spacing, and overall health of women and children. Studies show that reducing the number of unintended pregnancies not only reduces the number of abortions but also lowers the number of maternal and infant deaths associated with the risks of childbirth. In addition to reducing the number of unintended pregnancies, family planning programs run by organizations like United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation work to reduce high fertility in developing countries and increase overall health standards for women and children to order to negate the burdens unintended pregnancies, high fertility rate, and infant and maternal mortality have on countries in the global South. A family planning project in India increases access to family planning and contraceptives to Indian women.  Overview of Modern International Planning  The start of family planning as a formal tool of international development traces it origins to May 13, 1968 when the International Conference on Human Rights issued what became known as the Proclamation of Teheran. The Teheran Proclamation stated that for parents, being able to choose how many children they want to have and to choose the spacing of those children is a basic human right. While the importance of family planning had been known to the women it affected the most, it was not until the 1968 conference that family planning was seen as the obligations of countries and governments around the world. Family planning was and still is seen as a tool to not only help lower overall global fertility rates but also aid increasing the economic and social development in many countries, particularly in developing nations by lowering health risks associated with pregnancy and childbirth to women and children. Unintended pregnancies and high fertility rates can affect everything from quality of life, nutrition standards, access to education and economic opportunities and even access to scarce resources such as food and water for women and children. Family planning programs seek to give women of child-bearing age an opportunity to make their own reproductive choices. In 2017, an estimated $1.27 billion was raised for family planning programs worldwide. Partnerships such as Family Planning 2020 (FP2020), an international coalition jointly operating by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the United Nations and the governments of the UK and the US, seek to increase the availability of contraceptives to women who would otherwise not have access to them.  Benefits of Family Planning in Developing Countries  International family planning programs as a part of development plans can have many positive benefits for women and the communities they serve. The Guttmacher Institute noted in a recent study that investment in contraceptive and maternal healthcare programs can not only significantly decrease the number of unintended pregnancies worldwide but also unplanned births and induced and unsafe abortions. Other studies have similarly shown that family planning programs can reduce the maternal mortality rate associated with childbirth. The maternal death rate in developing countries is much higher than in developed countries. Additionally, family planning programs help reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including HIV/AIDS. It is often argued that family planning empowers women to make choices about their bodies and their reproductive health.  Criticisms of Family Planning Programs  While many studies and organizations have pointed out the benefits that family planning programs provide for the women they serve, they are not without their criticisms. There have been several documented cases around the world where women have been coerced into family planning. Researcher Kalpana Wilson noted that financial incentives given to doctors and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that sterilized women as part of family planning programs amounted to creating a quota system that was rife for abuse and encouraged forced sterilizations for monetary gain, especially in vulnerable and marginalized communities. In India, one doctor who had performed tens of thousands of laparoscopic tubectomies was charged with performing the surgical procedure in unsanitary and hazardous conditions that led to several injuries and several deaths. Instances of forced sterilization is not an isolated case confined to India. In Peru, over 2000 poor women belonging to rural, indigenous communities were coerced and forced to be sterilized between 1995 and 2000. Critics of the Peruvian program suggest the health care workers were incentivized to sterilize the women for cash bonuses of ten dollars per woman. Since the 1980s, charges of forced sterilizations and abortions have been associated with the Chinese government's family planning program as well.

Schweitzer\\", Jan. 20, 2018. In its expanded form, it was first published in Fantastic Science Fiction magazine in two parts, as \\"The White Isle\\" and \\"The Magician's Daughter,\\" in v. 27, no. 9-10, April-July 1980. It was subsequently published in book form in trade paperback by Borgo Press in December 1989, with a hardcover edition following from Owlswick Press in February 1990 and later trade paperback and ebook editions from Wildside Press in April 2007 and January 2011. It was also reprinted, together with Alan Rodgers's Bone Music, in Weird Tales Library, v. 1, no. 1, Winter 1999. Summary The novel takes the form of a tragic epic, following the protagonist, Prince Evnos of Iankoros, from his youth to old age. His early life is typical for an aristocrat of his class; he is educated to his role in life, married, and sent to war. Losing his wife in childbirth, the prince studies magic and heroically undertakes a descent into the underworld to reclaim her from the god of death. He finds it a strange and terrible place, and the afterlife a thing of unremitting horror, with every human being condemned to everlasting torment regardless of their conduct in life. Maddened and embittered by the failure of his quest, Evnos retires to a rocky island with his daughter to eke out his declining years. Sources Schweitzer has identified his sources for the story as the Orpheus myth, Clark Ashton Smith's story \\"The Isle of the Torturers,\\" and William Shakespeare's The Tempest (describing the second half of the novel as \\"the story of Prospero gone bad.\\") Reception Richard E.

It is located south of Mount Larrabee and north of Mount Shuksan in the Mount Baker Wilderness, which is managed by the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. Goat Mountain has a subsidiary 6,725 ft summit known as the west peak, and remnants of what was colloquially known as the Swamp Creek Glacier rest on the northern slope between the two summits. Its nearest higher neighbor is Mount Chardonnay, to the east. The Silver Tip Mine was located on the south slope of the mountain near the 3,000 ft level. The mine produced silver and gold in the 1940s.Silver Tip Mine westernmininghistory.com Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Fraser River and the Nooksack River. Climate Goat Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Goat Mountain seen from the south near the Artist Point area Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak. Geology Twin Lakes (bottom), Goat Mountain (upper right) The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. The rock of Goat Mountain is Darrington Phyllite of the Easton terrane. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The ‚ÄúU‚Äù-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Another bombing incident occurred a week later, killing 2 and injuring 12 around an internet caf√© in the same city. August 28 bombing The bombing occurred on August 28, 2018 at around 8:34 pm (UTC+8) in Barangay Kalawag 3 in front of J and H Marketing, a retail area for ukay ukay merchandise, along the National Highway around the area of the Isulan town proper. The explosion was caused by an improvised explosive device planted on a parked motorcycle. The incident happened amidst the Hamungaya Festival, a harvest festival celebrated in the Isulan annually. =Casualties= The blasts had three casualties; a 51-year-old, a 7-year-old child, and a 18-year- old college student. The 51-year-old died at the bombing site while the two died while confined in a hospital due to serious injuries from shrapnel wounds. 36 people were injured which includes two soldiers and a militia personnel. =Investigation= Suspects The police and military suspects that the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters are behind the bombing. The group is known for attacking civilian targets in retaliation to the group's losses in clashes against the Philippine Army's 6th Infantry Division. The Police Regional Office-12 (PRO-12) of the Philippine National Police (PNP) is determining the identity of two couriers who are said to have planted the bomb. The PNP PRO-12 later released an official sketch of an individual tagged as a suspect to the bombing. The image was released to various media firms on September 1, 2018. The suspect was described as a 20 to 25 years old male who is tall, weighs about , with a medium built and a white complexion. The police believes that the suspect is working with accomplices since the bombing was made in a manner that it can't be done by a single person. A day after a bombing, an unofficial computer-generated cartographic sketch of the suspect began circulating in social media. The police views this as a possible attempt to muddle the investigation. Authorities filed charges against 7 suspects, 2 of which are still at large. Four had been identified as Normia Antao Camsa, Norshiya Joven Camsa, Abedin Camsa alias ‚ÄúBeds,‚Äù and the Swedish national, Hassan Akgun. Methods According to the police, the suspect detonated an improvised explosive device (IED) using a mobile phone. He is said to have been accosted by a militiaman when he placed the bomb under a parked motorbike. The IED's composition is determined to consists of black powder filled inside a barrel of water pump laced with cut nails and metal shards. A nine-volt battery was placed as a triggering device. =Reaction= Executive Salvador Medialdea hinted on August 29 that the Martial law in Mindanao which is due to terminate by the end of 2018 could be extended following the bombing. Local officials of Sultan Kudarat as well as Maguindanao expressed openness to the possible extension of martial law which they assess could help maintain peace and order in the island. Further activities in relation to the 104th foundation day of Isulan and the Hamungaya Festival were cancelled.

It lies directly across the Phalgu River from the town of Bodh Gaya, where Gautama Buddha is said to have attained enlightenment. It is a walk of about 20 minutes, from Bodh Gaya to Sujata Stupa. It was initially built in the 2nd century BCE as confirmed by finds of Dark Grey polished wares and a punch-marked coin in the monastery nearby. The stupa was dedicated to the milkmaid Sujata, from the village of Bakraur, who is said to have fed Gautama Buddha milk and rice at this spot as he was sitting under a Banyan tree, thereby ending his seven years of fasting and asceticism, and allowing him to attain illumination through the Middle Way. Pillar of Ashoka, originally located in front of Sujata Stupa, was brought to Bodh Gaya in 1956. Sujata offers Milk-Rice to the Buddha (art of Ayutthaya). The stupa was originally adorned with a pillar of Ashoka, which was quarried in part for building material in the 1800s, then placed at the Gol Pather intersection of Gaya, and finally moved to Bodh Gaya in 1956. The stupa was an integral part of the original landscape at Bodh Gaya, and it was reinforced and enlarged several times over the centuries. The Archaeological Survey of India made excavations in 1973-74 and 2001-06.ASI notice A plaque found in the excavation has an inscription from the 8th-9th century CE that reads \\"Devapala Rajasya Sujata Griha\\", Devapala being interpreted as the 9th century Pala dynasty king, hence meaning \\"Sujata House, of King Devapala\\". This suggests that the last phase of construction of the stupa dates to Devapala in the 9th century CE, to commemorate the house where Sujata lived. Before the discovery of this inscription, it was thought that this stupa had been dedicated to \\"Gandha-hasti\\", the \\"Perfumed elephant\\", and was therefore named \\"Gandha-hasti stupa\\". This interpretation was based on a description made by the 7th century Chinese pilgrim Hiuen Tsiang (in Â§ßÂîêË•øÂüüË®ò: Buddhist Records of the Western World) who recounted that when he crossed the river (Niranjana) and went to Bakraur, he encountered a stupa and a stone column at the place where Gandha-hasti used to dwell (referring to the place where the Buddha, in a previous life, was reborn as the offspring of a Perfumed elephant).

Although trained in legal practice, he was appointed in later life as the founding head of the department of anthropology at the University of Calcutta. Biography Saratchandra came from a family with origins in Hogulkuria in Sutaniti Taluk where his ancestor Rammohan Mitra had moved to after leaving his original home at Borisha due to raids made by the Mahrattas. Saratchandra's father was Narasinghachandra Mitra, a legal adviser and pleader to the Hathwa Raj, and his mother was Nistarini Dasi. Saratchandra's older brother Amulyachandra died young and sister Sailabala Dasi was married to Purnachandra Chaudhuri of Simla. Saratchandra studied at the Calcutta Training Academy School at Chapra during 1875, followed by studies with scholarships at the Metropolitan Institution founded by Ishwarchand Vidyasagar before passing the Entrance Examination of 1880 from the City School at Calcutta in the first division. He received a BA with honours in English in 1885 from the Metropolitan Institution with scholarships followed by an MA in English in 1886 and a BL in 1888. He joined the Chapra Bar in May 1889 and was guided by his father. He continued to work with the Bar until 1894 although he attempted to move into Judicial services as a Gazetted officer. From February 1894 to March 1903 he worked as a Superintendent of Survey and Settlement in the Huthwa Raj. The Court of Wards was however abolished and he returned to the Chapra Bar (Saratchandra's father had worked here and died on 11 July 1905) in 1904 and worked till November 1911. From 1911 he worked as an assistant manager, appointed by the Maharani of Hathua. In 1921 he was appointed professor in charge of the newly created Department of Anthropology at the University of Calcutta but he retired in 1926 due to ill health and loss of vision. His position was then briefly taken by the American trained Biraja Sankar Guha who however moved out of the university to join government service.  Writings  Saratchandra's interests were in travel, history, folklore, biography, and anthropology. He was influenced by the Ethnographic Survey of India which had begun in 1905 under Herbert Risley as well as the Linguistic Survey of India by George Grierson. He wrote on a range of subjects such as The Legends of Buddha in Indo-Hellenistic Art (In a Bombay-based magazine East and West, August 1913) which was reviewed by the Evening Gazette of Aberdeen. During his postings and travels in North Bihar he collected information from the local people. He was a prolific writer and published nearly 183 papers in the Journal of the Anthropological Society of Bombay, 97 in the Quarterly Journal of the Mythic Society, 37 in the National Magazine, Calcutta, 34 in Man-in- India (Ranchi), 21 each in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal and the Hindustan Review and many more in university journals. He also wrote under a pseudonym \\"Aescyem\\" (for his initials) to the Calcutta Review. He was a corresponding member of the Anthropological Society of Bombay from 1895. In 1912 the Society decided to reprint Mitra's collected writings as a book. Mitra was also a promoter of outdoor natural history education in schools. Among the topics that Mitra explored where folk rhymes, drolls, tales, riddles, and beliefs. He took a particular interest in myth and lore around plants and animals and recorded a range of didactic and aetiological myths.

It was built from 1827 to 1842 by George Cutter (first inn) and William Sherwin (coach staging post). It is also known as Cutter's Inn and Cottage No. 8 and Cottage No. 11. It is a surviving feature of the institution variously known as the Mittagong Training School for Boys and Mittagong (later Renwick) Farm Home, State Ward Home or Children's Home, although it predated the facility. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  =Indigenous history= Gundungurra or Gandangarra people lived in the Southern Highlands area, which includes Mittagong, for many thousands of years. People who spoke the Gundungurra language lived in the Blue Mountains, the Southern Highlands and the Goulburn Plains of New South Wales. They lived in small groups of extended family members, who were attached to particular country areas. After Anglo-European settlers caused displacement of Gundungurra people, they often worked on farms or grazing properties within and adjacent to their traditional countries. Gundungurra groups left archaeological evidence of their occupation throughout their traditional homelands, including scarred trees where bark was removed for use as a boat or other object, grinding grooves on rocks where axes were ground, and occupation sites which include middens. Well-worn Gundungurra pathways on ridge tops were often the routes used as the first roads by colonists. Possibly this could have been the origin of the Old South Road where the Hassall and Jefferis Cottages are located. =Land grant history= The cottages' site has regional significance as one of the early land grants in the area, to Robert Plume in 1822. The first inn established at the property was built by George Cutter and opened as the Kangaroo Inn (also known as Cutter's Inn) in 1827, following the initial grant of land in 1822 or 1823. It was a timber structure which fronted the \\"road to the new country\\". The Inn catered for coaching services to the south and was the first licensed premises south of Razorback Range. It was one of the earliest inns and one of the best known inns of its time. When the main road to the south was relocated by Surveyor General Thomas Mitchell in 1830 to its present location through Mittagong and Berrima, the coaching trade declined and the property was sold to explorer Charles Sturt in 1836 who apparently used the property as a residence.Davies, 1991 The site is the location of and as the (probable) home of Charles Sturt between 1836 & 1838.LEP, 2010 William Sherwin purchased the property in 1839. =Mail coach staging post= After 1840 the inn became a mail coach staging post and was used by Cobb & Co., until 1867 when the rail head reached Mittagong. The stone carriage or coach house building has the date 1842 incised on the keystone and apparently dates to that year. Paul Davies identifies the coach house as \\"Jefferis\\" (1991). An additional brick structure serving as the coach house residence cottage was built against the wall of the coach house after 1842. Three other early buildings built circa late 1840s - 1850s are identified as \\"Hassall\\" including a kitchen or sitting room building; a one-room domed ceiling building adjacent; and another one or two room structure possibly a detached kitchen. All three were built as stand-alone structures or extensions to the inn building (\\"Hassall\\") constructed -1870. Hassall may have replaced an earlier structure such as the original Cutter's Inn. =Welfare and Farm Home accommodation= Following 1875 the property was no longer used as an inn and was sold and used as residential accommodation for destitute children, and later a Government Farm for detaining boys. During the early 20th century many modifications occurred on the site including additions, new buildings and services, etc. The Jefferis structure was depicted in a 1923 government architect's map as Mittagong Farm Homes Cottage No. 8. The Hassall structure was Farm Home Cottage Number 11.Davies 1991: Illustration 42 In 1976 the Farm Homes for young people were closed and the buildings were abandoned and vandalised in the 1980s. The buildings were made the subject of a Permanent Conservation Order in 1986. =Recent works= Because of the major modifications which occurred after 1907, Paul Davies identified 1911 as an appropriate date to which the buildings could be restored (1991, 5.1.6). \\"The most consistent period of the buildings' development should be retained in preference to conjectural reconstruction of earlier periods\\".(1991, 5.2.6) There were no serviceable timber remnants in the buildings when the property was acquired by the Hagan family in 1989. The Hagans restored the buildings to their 1911 state as per the 1991 Davies Conservation Plan. In 2001 permission was granted to build a new garage (with date stone indicating construction date) in the style of the 1840s buildings, over the footprint of a twentieth century building that was demolished, according to the owner, because it was unsafe. The 20th century structure was adjacent to Jefferis and was associated with the Farm Home residential occupancy. Additionally in 2001, a new enclosed yard for farm machinery was approved. The Hassall cottage has been modified and the garden and grounds extensively landscaped in the 1990s. In 2005, the nearby airstrip operated by Berrima District Aero Club applied to build additional hangars, leading to submissions to the Heritage Council for advice regarding impact to the former Cutter's Inn property. With input from the Heritage Office the Wingecarribee Shire Council approved the application with several conditions, including the exclusion of student flying and other limitations in order to minimise harmful vibration to the heritage buildings and to reduce possibility of destructive impact. The property was placed on the real estate market in 2016.  Description  The two buildings known as Hassall and Jefferis are located on the Old South Road, Mittagong. They are in a semi-rural location, set back from the road in a group of buildings, with open garden space surrounding them. The Old South Road was once the main road to the south, but now is a minor road. The cottages' site has regional significance as one of the early (1822) land grants, as the location of one of the earliest and best known inns and as the (probable) home of Charles Sturt between 1836 & 1838. The present building group has fabric and components dating back to the 1840s together with elements and stylistic detailing from a number of subsequent periods to the mid 20th century, and though a somewhat eclectic pair of structures they provide a remarkably explicit account of their functional and social changes as well as a creative example of traditional building evolution with a notable compatibility of overall character. =Site and garden= 80 acres of sheltered, fertile land. Approximately 7 acres of established garden surrounding the home (former inn) and cottages. Features in the setting are paddocks with scattered locally- indigenous eucalypts and a backdrop of bushland. Features of the garden are extensive lawns around the building complex, edges with lines of Lombardy poplars, (Populus nigra 'Italica') and with arrays of clumped plantings of deciduous exotic trees (poplars and Asian/Manchurian pears (Pyrus ussuriensis)) and exotic conifers (Bhutan cypress: Cupressus torulosa), Monterey pines (Pinus radiata). Inner lawns are defined by box hedging and punctuation points (Buxus sempervirens). =Jefferis/Stable and Carriage House Structure= The former carriage house is a two-storey stone (sawn sandstone and andstock brick) building with verandah on both levels called Jefferis by Paul Davies (1991). According to Davies and Partridge's 1991 assessment report, Jefferis was probably built as a one-storey building without verandahs, containing a small loft, horse stalls, two coach stalls and a tack room.The stone carriage or coach house building has the date 1842 incised on the keystone. A s brick cottage is attached to the former carriage house, probably as a residence for a coachman. The carriage and stable structure contains numerous alterations from various periods, from the late 19th century through the 20th. These alterations illustrate its adaptation early on, for use as a residence. A doorway was cut into the wall connecting the attached 1840s cottage residence to the carriage house, so that now they are viewed as one residential building. Jefferis now presents with dominant gable over the entrance door with symmetrical bay windows, a verandah and french doors. Carriage entrances are infilled and windows have been cut into walls. Kitchen, bathroom and laundry facilities were installed. The floor was tiled, and tongue and groove ceiling linings were added on both levels. =Hassall/Cutter's Inn Structure= 1827 single-storey building with attic dormer windows. Home of sandstone brick with four bedroom suites, living rooms of excellent proportion. The front section of Hassall may have replaced an earlier structure such as the original Cutter's Inn. =Other structures= Additionally there are three separate single-storey brick structures of significance including a possible original kitchen building dating to - 1865. Davies suggests they may be constructed from bricks made on site. These three structures relate to and appear as extensions to the brick residence building called \\"Hassall\\". The space between the three earlier structures forms a sort of courtyard at the rear of Hassall. This area had been enclosed with a two- storey infill addition. That structure has now been removed. The owner reported that during works on site a well was discovered in that area and an early brick lined water tank. There also exist: * Two meticulously-restored, one bedroom cottages. * Well: The owner reported that during works on site a well was discovered in that area. * Water Tank: The owner reported that during works on site an early brick lined water tank was discovered. No sections of the earlier timber structure extant. = Modifications and dates = * original \\"Cutters Inn\\" building * sandstone cottage/coach house built * 1842+ coach house cottage built * 1845-50 Brick loft extended on upper storey of stone coach house. * late 1840s- 1850s: 3 other \\"Hassall\\" buildings built: kitchen/sitting room; one-roomed domed ceiling building adjacent to it and a 1-2 room building (detached kitchen block?) * 1865-70 Inn building \\"Hassall\\" built, perhaps replacing the earlier structure, e.g. Cutters Inn of * 1875+ site used as a residence for destitute children - likely modifications made to accommodate this use. * Later used as a government farm - possible alterations to fit this use. * early 20th century: many changes: additions, new buildings, services * 1907 - period of development with major impact on appearance and finish of structures; much of earlier fabric and finish removed.

Heritage listing  The complex of buildings have historic significance as early remaining structures from the original village of Mittagong. The property has links to colonial figures such as Charles Sturt (although no structures from his period of ownership have survived) and significant links to the mail coach industry which used the buildings as a mail coach staging stop and roadside inn. In spite of additions and alterations the buildings dating to the 1840-1860s are rare surviving remnants of a roadside inn and stables, indicative of the form they were in during their working life from that era. The structures represent a phase in the development of transport, facilities and communication serving the road to the southern area of New South Wales prior to the construction of the railway in the late 1860s. The property's later use as government accommodation for children has social significance illustrating social welfare policy and the property's adaptation to changing circumstances and purposes. Hassall & Jefferis Cottages was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Built -1865, the buildings demonstrate the early history of the Southern Highlands and the importance of the Old South Road in the development of the south western part of the state. With links to important early figures in the colony such as Charles Sturt, and to important institutions such as Cobb & Co, the site contains importance to the history of transport patterns and mail communication in New South Wales. The site has historic significance linked to its use as a detention farm home for youths. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Conservation Management Plan by Paul Davies states that the site and buildings and rural backdrop are important visually in the valley, and would for most of their life have been clearly seen from the road with a prominent entrance, particularly in the coaching days where prominence was important. Good public visibility of the buildings from the street is considered essential to correct interpretation of the site.Davies 1991, 2.3.3 The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The buildings and site are of social significance in the development of the Mittagong area, as possibly the only surviving commercial complex from the early period of the original settlement before the re-routing of the main road and before the rail extension in 1867. The property's use as a children's home has social significance to the surrounding community, who were impacted, and the children who came through that system. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Rare surviving roadside coach stop and inn. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Representative of roadside stage coach buildings including carriagehouse, stables and loft, and other kitchen and accommodation extensions roughly in the form seen during their working life in the 1840s-1860s despite additions and alterations. Also represents the first property developed for the detention of children in the southern highlands area, illustrating a method of detainment that is no longer used but which was revolutionary when introduced around the turn of the century.

His first recorded office was quattuorviri viarum curandarum, one of the magistracies that comprised the vigintiviri; membership in one of these four boards was a preliminary and required first step toward a gaining entry into the Roman Senate. This was followed with his commission as military tribune with Legio I Minervia, stationed at Bonna (modern Bonn), in Germania Inferior.

She is noted for her two-year study of women in aviation, the Teaching Women to Fly Research Project, which identified barriers to women training as pilots and presented 101 strategies to increase the participation of women in aviation. She also interests children in aviation, giving talks in schools and libraries as the character \\"Penny the Pilot\\". She and her husband jointly hold a World Aviation Speed Record set in 1991. In addition to writing for aviation magazines, she has published books on the history of Granby, Colorado, where she has resided since 1989. She was inducted into the Colorado Aviation Hall of Fame in 2011 and the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 2014. Early life, education, and career Penny Rafferty was born on February 18, 1948, in Pennsylvania. She earned her bachelor's degree from Columbia University, and an associate of arts degree in dental hygiene education from Temple University in 1968. She began working as a dental hygienist in a preventative dental clinic which she managed in Rhode Island, where she met her husband, a career military officer. Together they lived in different locations in the US and abroad, including Germany. Upon his retirement in 1979, they settled in Nebraska. They both attended the University of Nebraska, where she earned a master's degree in adult and continuing education and a Ph.D. in communications. She submitted her thesis on \\"The Dental Hygienist: The First Half-Century, 1913 to 1963\\". Hamilton worked as a professor of communications at the University of Nebraska while writing an advice column for the Sun Newspapers chain. She also hosted a radio program, and appeared weekly on television. Later she and her husband purchased a newspaper and opened a management consultancy and public relations business called Advanced Research Institute. One of their clients was the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association. Aviation activities Hamilton became interested in flying after serving as a navigation and radio controller for her husband. She received her pilot's license in 1988. On October 22, 1991, the couple flew from Lincoln, Nebraska to New Orleans, Louisiana, at a speed of , completing the trip in 4 hours and 39 minutes. They set a World Aviation Speed Record for their weight class, which still stands. The record was verified by the F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale and the National Aeronautic Association. She retired from flying in 2007. With an estimated 6 percent of licensed pilots in the US being women (in the UK the figure is less than 9 percent), Hamilton decided to promote the idea of flying to women and girls. Her first initiative was to interest children in aviation by giving talks in schools and library groups. She appears as the character \\"Penny the Pilot\\", dressing up in the vintage flying gear of famed woman aviator Amelia Earhart. In 2009, she received the 7 Everyday Hero Award from The Denver Channel for this initiative, and was similarly honored with the Federal Aviation Administration's Central Region Aviation Education Champion Award. Hamilton solicited a grant from the Wolf Aviation Fund to launch the Teaching Women to Fly Research Project in 2008. This two-year study queried women flight students and pilots, and male flight instructors, to identify what prevented women from pursuing flight training. Hamilton identified ten barriers to women entering the field, including: lack of money, a perceived indifference to women students on the part of flight training schools, lack of continuity as flight instructors leave their jobs and new ones take over the class, communication difficulties between women and male flight instructors, lack of female role models, unfamiliarity with mechanical systems, lack of experience with reading maps, lack of female mentorship, and lack of emotional support from friends and family. She also proposed 101 strategies to overcome these barriers, among them: \\"the creation of low-interest loan programs for women in colleges and universities, web-based support communities for female pilots, and developing female friendly flight training to emphasize different learning styles and strengths\\". The study led to the compilation of a textbook titled Absent Aviators: Gender Issues in Aviation (Ashgate, 2014), to which Hamilton contributed a chapter, and to a planned flight instructors communication manual. Hamilton was a co-founder of the Emily Warner Field Aviation Museum, which opened in July 2015 in the former Rocky Mountain Airways terminal in the Grand County Airport. As of 2018, she volunteers as a team leader at the museum on behalf of the Grand County Historical Association. She is also the volunteer director of the Colorado Airport History Preservation Project.

Including self-portraits and portraits of him by other artists. Benvenuto Cellini's physical appearance is determined based on a number of his lifetime portraits. However, due to a few known portraits from the 17th ‚Äì 20th century, where the artists drew Cellini's facial traits from their imagination, as well as because of past posthumous erroneous attributions, there is a level of confusion on this subject.  Portrait of Benvenuto Cellini on the Vasari Fresco  The portrait of Cellini is situated among the images of other court artists of the Florentine Duke Cosimo I di Medici on a round-shaped frescoVasari, Giorgio (1511‚Äì1572) Cosimo I di Medici among court sculptors, architects and engineers.

Engraving. 26.5 cm by 14 cm. (1771) National Library, Vienna. Inventory number 8191345In 1891, French book-publisher Eugene Plon called into question the attribution of personalities on the fresco, which had until then been regarded as authentic since the 16th century.Plon, Eug√®ne, \\"Benvenuto Cellini, orf√®vre, m√©dailleur, sculpteur, recherches sur sa vie, sur son oeuvre et sur les pi√®ces qui lui sont attribu√©es\\", √©ditions Plon et Cie, imprimeurs √©diteurs, Paris, 1883, p. 594 Although most personalities, including Cellini himself, appear in the fresco undersigned by Vasari with their real names, Plon nevertheless cast doubt over the caption's accuracy. As the result of his studies, Plon claimed in his book that \\"the real\\" Cellini in the fresco is the man that would later be identified as Bartolomeo Ammannati.Kirwin, W.,Ch. \\"Vasari's Tondo of Cosmo I with his Architects, Engineers and Sculptors in the Palazzo Vecchio : Typology and Re- Identification of Portraits\\"// Mitteilungen des Kunsthistorischen institutes in Florenz, 15(1971) pp. 105‚Äì122 Contemporary studies made in 1971 re- attributed the personalities shown in the tondo. = Portrait of Giorgio Vasari wrongly attributed as portrait of Benvenuto Cellini = By the end of the 18th century, a third attribution of Cellini's face had been made on the fresco housed in the Palazzo Vecchio. This version belongs to British artist and engraver Joseph Collyer (1748 ‚Äì1827). In 1829 Francesco Tassi claimed that Collyer had been commissioned to make the engraving of \\"portrait Benvenuto Cellini\\" by the British publisher \\"Nugent\\". Looking for the correct face of Benvenuto, the English artist relied on Cellini's image in Vasari's tondo. But Collyer simply failed to properly identify the sculptor among the other personalities on the fresco. He erroneously thought that Cellini was the man placed at the very bottom of the tondo. Collyer's Benvenuto was the man shown talking to Francesco di Ser Jacopo, and looking over his shoulder towards the viewer.–°ellini, Benvenuto \\"Vita di Benvenuto Cellini\\", orefice e scultore fiorentino, scritta da lui medesimo, restituita alla lezione originale sul manoscritto poirot ora laurenziano ed arricchita d‚Äôillustrazioni e documenti inediti dal dottor Francesco Tassi, vol. I, Firenze, 1829 (extrait page 38). In other words, the British master created \\"A Portrait of Benvenuto Cellini\\" in 1771, as a portrait of the painting's author Giorgio Vasari, and not actually of Benvenuto Cellini.Morghen, Raffaello (1758‚Äì1883) A portrait of Benvenuto Cellini. Engraving (1822) = Portrait of Benvenuto Cellini by Raffaello Morghen = Two and a half centuries after Vasari's tondo was painted, the Italian artist Raffaello Sanzio Morghen (1758‚Äì1833) used the portrait in the fresco at the Palazzo Vecchio as a sample for his engraved \\"Portrait of Benvenuto Cellini\\".Gnaccarini, Giacomo Raffaele Morghen, in \\"L'Omnibus Pittoresco\\", n.36 del 22 novembre 1838, pp.361‚Äì362 Morghen's picture was largely propagated by publishers of the time. These days the work of Raffaello Sanzio Morghen and its derivatives remain Cellini's best-known and most widely reproduced image.  Self-Portraits of Cellini  = Self- Portrait of Benvenuto Cellini on the bust of Cosimo I Medici = Cellini, Benvenuto. Bust of Cosimo I. Bronze (1545). Bargello Museum, Florence. Detail: Cellini's portrait Upon his return from France to his hometown Florence in 1545, Benvenuto cast a bronze bust of Cosimo I Medici, the Grand Duke of Tuscany. The decorative head located on the right shoulder of this bust is a self-portrait of Cellini, composed with lineaments of satyr, lion and man.Perrot, Raoul. Biom√©trie faciale et expertise d'≈ìuvres d'art // Paleobios, Lyon, 2007. Vol. 15. Although the head on the shoulder possesses animalistic elements, the relief is anthropomorphic. Cellini took the lion and Satyr as prototypes. The lion, as the part of the grotesque image on the bust, is an allusion to Cellini himself. The animalistic features of the Satyr, in combination with the human face, acquire an even more explicit hint at Cellini's personality than the semiotic value of the lion image. By presenting himself in the guise of a Satyr, Benvenuto alludes to his own nickname \\"Diablo\\". In the minds of Renaissance society, a Satyr was synonymous with the demon, if not the \\"Devil\\" himself.Cellini, B., The Autobiography // Gutenberg.org., as translated by John Addington Symonds, Vol. I Ch.

The traits of Jupiter, although very idealized, resemble the facial traits of Neptune (Oceane) found on the famous \\"Salt cellar of the King Francois I\\" made by Cellini. The salt cellar (26 x 33,5 cm., gold, covered in part by enamel; base: ebony) is his only known goldsmith masterwork which has survived to our time. It was executed by Benvenuto right after his imprisonment, between 1540 and 1543, hence, ten years prior to casting his Jupiter in Florence. The features on the faces of both gods could hint at characteristic peculiarities of Benvenuto‚Äôs appearance, found on other portraits of the sculptor.  Portrait of Benvenuto Cellini on porphyry stone  The French 19th century editor Eugene Plon, besides mistakenly attempting to re-attribute personages of Vasari's fresco in Palazzo Vecchio, entered into the field of public awareness an artifact, known today as the \\"porphyry portrait of Benvenuto Cellini\\". He wrote: This artifact is kept today at the National Museum of Renaissance in Ch√¢teau d‚ÄôEcouen, France. This portrait is presently attributed to Francesco Salviati. Stamp portraying \\"Benvenuto Cellini\\" issued in Romania for Benvenuto Cellini's 400th year death anniversary. Plon dates the 8,5 cm medallion to the first half of the 16th century and he believes that the piece is the exact depiction of the \\"portrait of messer Benvenuto in nut-wood frame\\", which in accordance with the notary public's evidence, hung on a wall in the goldsmith's house at the moment of Benvenuto death.Inventaires dress√©s apr√®s le d√©c√®s de Benvenuto Cellini le 16 f√©vrier 1570 / Vie de Benvenuto Cellini √©crite par lui-m√™me // La Table Ronde, 2002, p. 650 ‚Äì 655 Plon claims that \\"several portraits made on porphyritic stone are kept in the Pitti Gallery\\" and that \\"all of them date back to the same epoch as regards the time of their creation.\\"Plon, Eugene.

Engraving. 29.5 cm —Ö19.2 cm. From a sketch by Giuseppe Zocchi. Austrian Nationalbibliothek A re-discovery of Cellini's book by the public at the end of the 18th century brought up an acute need for the portrait of the author, in order to illustrate the publications. Many artists and engravers received orders from the publishers to produce Benvenuto's images. The earliest sample of the portraits of the \\"new wave\\" was an engraving made by the Italian master Francesco Allegrini in 1762. Allegrini used a drawing of Giuseppe Zocchi as the basis for this work. (1711‚Äì1767). It is not known what sources Giuseppe Zocchi used in his 18 century for the inspiration, but the image of \\"Cellini\\" he created stands very wide apart from the portrait of Benvenuto on Vasari's fresco. The Allegrini/Zocchi print was purchased by Louis-Philippe, (that time the Duke of Orleans, and later became the King of France) for his collection. At present, a copy of ‚ÄòPortrait of Benvenuto Cellini‚Äô of Zocchi/Allegrini is kept at the Palace of Versailles and Trianon.  Benvenuto Cellini on Other Works  = Sculpture by Jean-Jacque Feuchere = French sculptor Jean- Jacques Feuchere (1807‚Äì1852) cast the small bronze sculpture \\"Cellini\\" in 1837.

(1837) = The Marrel Brothers Cup = King of France Louis-Philippe purchased the Marrel Brothers Cup in order to hand this work of art to his son Louis, Duke of Nemours as a gift. The event occurred in 1839 during an industrial exhibition in Paris. Goldsmiths and companions Antoine-Benoit-Roch and Jean-Pierre- Nazaire Marrel produced their masterpiece on a wave of inspiration from Cellini's so-called \\"Augsburg's Cup\\" that was purchased by the Louvre Museum in 1832. The latter cup had the form of a silver chalice with gilding. The authorship of the \\"Augsburg's cup\\"was attributed to Benvenuto at that time. The Marrel Brothers were impressed by the events, and responded with their own creation.Coupe ‚ÄòCellini‚Äô // Mus√©e du Louvre. (URL: http://www.louvre.fr/oeuvre-notices/coupe-cellini Date of request 14.03.2015) = Bust by Vincenzo Gajassi = Much later statue of Cellini, Piazzale degli Uffizi, Florence, Cambi. The Italian sculptor Vincenzo di Marco Fabio Apolloni (‚ÄòGajassi‚Äô) created a marble bust of Benvenuto Cellini in 1844. Later in the same year, Lady Eleonora Butler presented the marble as a gift to the Museum Capitoline in Rome. The master apparently tried to impart features found on the Vasari fresco in Palazzo Vecchio to his model. Proof is found in the characteristic long beard, as well as in the shape of the nose, eyebrows and half-face. Apolloni, Vincenzo di Marco Fabio. ‚ÄòBust of Benvenuto Cellini‚Äô. Marble. (1844). Museum Capitoline, Rome = Sculpture by Ulisse Cambi = The architect Giorgio Vasari and his successor Bernardo Buontoletti left 28 spare niches in the walls of colonnade of the Uffizi palace. A portrait of Benvenuto Cellini made by Ulisse Cambi (1807‚Äì1895) was installed in one of the niches. A marble statue more than 3 meters tall was unveiled to the public the 24th of June in 1845. left The portrait is entirely the plot of Cambi's imagination. His interpretation of Benvenuto's image and sculpture as a whole triggered sharp criticism from the public. = Bust by Raffaello Romanelli = Raffaello Romanelli‚Äôs bust of Benvenuto Cellini was placed in the middle of the Old Bridge (Ponte Vecchio) in Florence in 1901. Romanelli had given his own facial traits to Cellini's bust on Ponte Vecchio.  Stylistic differences between self-portraits and portraits of Cellini  All the self-portraits by Benvenuto Cellini correspond to his literary self-portrayal in presenting him as a heroic personality. The heroic nature of artistic images is achieved with the help of a technique discovered by Michelangelo and known as ¬´terribilit√†¬ª. This is created by frowning the brows and bearing a confident look in the eyes. Cellini's appearance has numerous characteristics, some of which can be considered as his distinctive features: ‚Ä¢ broad cheekbones ‚Ä¢ an underdeveloped and somewhat protruding mandible, with the lower lip over biting the upper lip ‚Ä¢ a large nose which is thin and straight at the bridge, but has a thickening and a small dimple on the tip ‚Ä¢ green-greyish eyes which appear to be set close to the bridge of the nose; ‚Ä¢ almond-shaped eyelids ‚Ä¢ rather thick eyebrows although in some self-portraits Cellini tried to make them less expressed ‚Ä¢ Cellini began to grow bald early, but the process slowed down with age; in spite of that, Benvenuto Cellini had lost his hair on the top of his head by the age of 50 ‚Ä¢ thin and strong hands ‚Ä¢ an athletic build and straight posture, which Cellini preserved throughout his life. Cellini tended to idealize and heroicize his appearance. In some instances, the ‚Äúimprovements‚Äù of his facial features were excessive.

Any player with legal nationality the country they seek to represent are generally eligible to play for that country's national team but FIBA provides specific provisions for players who have acquired their legal nationality, dual citizens, and players representing FIBA members which are dependencies of another country. Eligibility Eligibility rules imposed by FIBA on national team players applies to both men and women. A player who seeks to represent a country must hold legal nationality of that country. In 3x3 basketball, a player is eligible to represent their country if they have the appropriate legal nationality. The eligibility could be proven through a passport obtained at any age. =Naturalized players= Foreign-born players with bloodline connection with the country they want to represent must prove their legal nationality through a passport obtained before turning age 16. Players who obtained their passport afterwards can still play but they would be considered as \\"naturalized\\" players by FIBA rather than as a local. FIBA allows one naturalized player to be on the roster of a national team per game. Application on non-FIBA tournaments In May 2018, the basketball federations in the Micronesia region decided to adopt FIBA eligibility rules for basketball players participating in the Micronesian Games. Previously the players in the games were subjected to seven-year residency requirement for non-Micronesians and a three-year residency term for islanders. The change generally restricts citizens of Federated States of Micronesia and Palau from playing for the Marshall Islands and would allow any United States passport holders to play for Guam and the Northern Marianas. The Olympic Council of Asia does not enforce FIBA eligibility rules when it comes to naturalized players and dual citizens in the Asian Games. However it requires players to reside in the country they seek to represent for at least three years. The eligibility could be claimed by a passport of at least three years of validity. The OCA only allows one player with no bloodline to play for a national team in the Asian Games. Proposed reform According to Al Panlilio, the president of the Philippines' national federation Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas, the dominance of Australia and New Zealand in the 2018 FIBA Asia Under-18 Championship gave way for possible reform on FIBA eligibility rules. Panlilio said that FIBA Asia might be concerned about maintaining balance in its competition while stated that the federation's position is that Filipino dual citizens should be allowed to play as locals regardless of when they were issued passports as long as their bloodline with their country could be proven.

Magnus Lagab√∏tes bylov (\\"Magnus Lagab√∏te's City Law\\") was promulgated for Bergen in 1276 during the reign of King Magnus VI of Norway (known as Magnus lagab√∏te or \\"law-mender\\"). Oslo, Trondheim and T√∏nsberg received their own versions of the City Law about the same time, without the exact year being known for when they were adopted. The City Law was based on the State Law of Magnus Lagab√∏te, adopted in 1274, and the Bjark√∏yretten, Trondheim's old city law, which came into force during the 1100s. Audun Hugleiksson was instrumental in the design of the law. Magnus Lagab√∏te's City Law had specific rules and regulations that applied to the merchants in conjunction with the State Law. The laws that applied to the countryside were omitted. The State and City Laws were undoubtedly better known and more widespread than all other secular works in Norway in the late Middle Ages. The laws were applied verbally, with the principle of equality before the law and justice. Today, the Byloven survives in twenty-five manuscripts, mostly as a complementary addition to the State Law. According to the City Law, the city was governed by the bym√∏tet or bytinget (\\"city meeting\\"), where all the town's householders met three times a year. In addition, there should be a council, usually of twelve men. The council was led by a taxpayer, later called byfogd (\\"city captain\\").

The leader of the revolt was Caquenga, an animist priestess who acted as a spiritual head of her Malaueg community, which was a village named Nalfotan. The coming of a Dominican friar, Fray Pedro, into Nalfotan triggered the revolt that spread throughout the surrounding region. Background With the creation of the Nueva Segovia diocese in 1595 in the Cagayan Valley, Catholic missionaries from Europe began flooding into the region to convert the indigenous inhabitants to the Catholic faith. Per the Dominican account, Pagulayan, the chief of Nalfotan, had tried contacting Catholic missionaries for years. Fray Pedro then accepted the invitation and went to Nalfotan to visit Pagulayan and the Malaueg people. To his astonishment, he found a church erected and the people waiting to adopt the religion. However, Caquenga, an indigenous animist leader, or priestess, apprehended the coming of the friar. Christianity posed a threat to her indigenous animism, and Catholic missionaries and Spanish officials worked continuously to eradicate animism. In response to this threat against her spiritual beliefs, she gathered a group of followers and they revolted against the priest.Fluckiger, \\"Caquenga.\\" Revolt One night, after crying for liberty, Caquenga and her Malaueg followers tore down their houses, killed their livestock, destroyed their fields, and fled to the mountains. In the mountains, they joined Nalfotan's enemy village and made plans to fight against the Catholic missionaries and their supporters. Sensing potential danger, Pedro and Pagulayan sent a Nalfotan local to go talk to the enemy village's leader, Furaganan. The local convinced Furaganan to go down to Nalfotan and talk to Pedro and Pagulayan. The three men made peace and the two villages did not fight. Furaganan made the claim that Caquenga was a slave that formerly belonged to his mother. Seeing that as an opportunity to dispose of Caquenga, Pagulayan gave Caquenga over to Furaganan and she entered back into slavery. Despite this peace treaty, the rebels continued to fight. Caquenga's followers left Furaganan's village displeased. They entered the Catholic Church in Nalfotan, desecrated the sacred relics, and burned the structure down. The Dominican historian said the following of the desecration: \\"They tore the ornaments of the mass into pieces, to wear as head-cloths, or as ribbons. They tore the leaves out of the missal, and drank from the chalice, like a people without God, governed by the devil.\\"Diego Aduarte, Historia de la Provincia del Sancto Rosario de la Ordende Predicadores en Philippinas, lapon y China‚Ä¶ (Manila: Colegio de Sacto Thomas), 1640, 1:350, accessed from Biblioteca Virtual de Patrimonio Bibliografico, http://bvpb.mcu.es/es/consulta/registro.cmd?id=399061 accessed May 2, 2017. English translation by Fluckiger, from \\"Caquenga and Feminine Social Power in the Philippines\\" One rebel took the image of the Virgin Mary and shot it with arrows, mocking the Christian God while doing so. These rebels were eventually apprehended, and the belligerent who shot the image of the Virgin Mary was publicly executed, presenting a threatening reminder to the people what would happen to them if they continued to rebel and defile the sacred objects of the Catholic Church. However, neither this execution nor the enslavement of Caquenga stopped the rebellions. More revolts broke out in surrounding villages, and the missionaries and colonial officials struggled quelling them. The Dominicans attributed all of these rebellions to Caquenga, \\"a sorceress priestess of [the devil].\\"Aduarte, 1:349 Aftermath While Dominican accounts are not specific as to how long the revolt lasted, it is clear that Caquenga's followers caused significant damage to Nalfotan and the surrounding region. However, after nineteen years of proselytization in Nalfotan, Dominicans claimed to have baptized 4,670 people. According to the Dominicans, they achieved this through the help of Pagulayan and his sister, Balinan. Both devoted themselves entirely to the Catholic Church and served the Dominicans faithfully. They proved to be very useful during times of rebellion and drought.Aduarte, 1:351-352  References  Indigenous rebellions against the Spanish Empire Cagayan History of Cagayan History of Cagayan Valley History of the Philippines (1565‚Äì1898) Rebellions in the Philippines ","title":"Caquenga's Revolt"},{"id":"58386721","text":"AT-121 is an experimental analgesic.

Magnus Lagab√∂tes landslov (\\"Magnus Lagab√∏te's State Law\\") was a law covering the whole of Norway, issued by King Magnus VI of Norway between 1274 and 1276. The law was the first to apply to Norway as a whole and is one of the first examples of comprehensive national legislation from a central authority in Europe. The law is the reason that the king was given the name Lagab√∏te, \\"the one who improves the law\\". Although the legislation applied to the whole country, it formally consisted of four different law books, one for each of the four jurisdictions (Gulating, Frostating, Eidsivating and Borgarting). However, the content of the four statutes was largely similar and was based primarily on the previous jurisdictional laws. In addition, a separate City Law, Magnus Lagab√∏tes bylov, was issued for the cities, from 1276. The preparation of a shared law strengthened the central authorities and the king's power. This led to reactions, especially from the Church. Archbishop Jon Raude in Nidaros opposed the king intervening in the ecclesiastical sphere and revising ecclesiastical legislation. There was a prolonged tug of war between the king on the one hand and the church on the other side, which ended with a settlement and a compromise, called the S√¶ttargjerden, in T√∏nsberg in 1277. The archbishop succeeded in securing the church a considerable tax deduction and greater legal privileges. Large sections of the legislation were applicable for more than 400 years. It was revised and translated into Danish in 1604 and received the name Christian IVs Norsk Lov (\\"Christian IV's Norwegian Law\\"), named after King Christian IV of Denmark. In 1687 the legislation was repealed and replaced by Christian Vs Norsk Lov. There were at least 41 copies or manuscript of the State Law in circulation and it was the most widely used non-religious book in medieval Norway. There were large and small differences in the wording between the manuscripts, and this variation was known by those who used the manuscripts, as shown in the form of notes in the margins. According to J√∏rn √òyrehagen Sunde, the wording was not followed slavishly, and adapted to each individual case.J√∏rn √òyrehagen Sunde, 'Stordomen til Landslova', Dag og Tid, 15. January 2016.

History  In many countries, pro bono legal servicinitiatives, such as mediation and legal services, are typically haphazard, closing due to lack of demand or overwhelmed with clients.Regan (1999), The Transformation of Legal Aid, pp. 113-114. Alternate dispute resolution methods such as Lok Adalat, Mediation and free legal aid have been devised; however no special statutes have been enacted to streamline the process. On 11 October 1987, the Legal Services Authorities Act 1987 was enacted. The act was took effect on 9 November 1995. India's National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) was constituted under its provisions on 5 December 1995. NALSA undertook activities including free legal aid and advice to the needy, disposal of cases through mediation and amicable settlement. It was a unique effort to minimize the pendency load (backlog) of Indian courts as well as to afford access to justice for needy litigants. To commemorate the occasion, the day of enactment was first celebrated in 1995 as National Legal Services Day. Each state's Legal Services Authorities organize the day through state, district level and Taluk level institutions.  Celebration  Legal Service Day is celebrated to make people aware of the various provisions under the Legal Services Authorities Act and the right of the litigants.

Previously, she had served as a member of the People's Representative Council. The daughter of two-term governor Cornelis M.H., she was first elected into office in 2009, being re-elected to the national parliament in 2014. She is a graduate of Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia. In 2018, she ran for governorship of West Kalimantan, but lost to Sutarmidji. Background Karolin was born in Mempawah Regency of West Kalimantan on 12 March 1982 as the first child of Cornelis M.H., later two-term governor of West Kalimantan and Landak regent while her mother was an elementary school teacher. Completing elementary school in Sambas and both middle and high school in Pontianak, she proceeded to study general medicine at Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia in Jakarta, starting in 2004 and graduating in 2007. Natasa is a Catholic of Dayak descent, and is married to Andreas Quinn. Career During her studies, she was active in the university's Catholic students association, becoming its secretary general. After graduating, she worked as a government doctor. Prior to being elected into office, she participated in the campaign teams for the Landak regency election and her father's successful bid for governorship of West Kalimantan in 2008. She is a member of PDI-P. =Parliament= She was first elected into the People's Representative Council in 2009, when she ran from her home constituency of West Kalimantan and won 222,021 votes, placing first in the province/constituency and third nationally.

During her entire time in the council, she was part of the ninth commission on demography, health, labor and transmigration. In 2012, a scandal arose related to a pornographic clip in which she was suspected to have participated, resulting in a hearing with the council's dignity body (Badan Kehormatan). She denied any wrongdoing, claiming that the case was made up due to her father's 2013 reelection campaign. =Regent= In 2017, she participated in Landak Regency's local election as a single candidate with Herculanus Heriyadi as her running mate, winning 96.86 percent of the votes. She was sworn in on 22 May 2017 by her father, becoming the regency's first female regent, the first female Dayak to serve as a regional head in Indonesia, and the first local leader in the province to win in an uncontested local election. In order to become a regent, she resigned from her office in the People's Representative Council. Just months after becoming regent, she registered to run in the 2018 gubernatorial elections for West Kalimantan with Bengkayang regent Suryadman Gidot as her running mate and three parties (PDI-P, Demokrat, PKPI) backing her. With 41.8% of votes, the pair lost to the Sutarmidji/Ria Norsan pair, however.

The union was founded in 1887 as the Yeadon and Guiseley Power Loom Weavers' Association, and was led by Herbert Lockwood, who had been victimised for his earlier trade union activities. By 1890, the union had 772 members. In 1892, it decided to broaden its remit to include other workers in textile factories, becoming the \\"Yeadon, Guiseley and District Factory Workers' Union\\", and in 1894 the Yeadon, Guiseley and District Fettlers' Union amalgamated with it. However, this was accompanied by a drop in membership, which fell to only 449 members, and bottomed out at 286 members in 1899. With the turn of the century, the union's membership began rising again, and by 1906 it had recovered to 489. It led a major strike in 1913, involving 2,500 workers and lasting ten weeks. This was a success, with a new agreement on pay and conditions for all workers signed with the Yeadon and Guiseley Manufacturers' Association, and the increased prestige of the union led to rapid membership growth, with 1,076 members by 1915, and 2,500 in 1918. The union affiliated to the Trades Union Congress in 1918. In 1922, it merged with the National Society of Dyers and Finishers and the General Union of Weavers and Textile Workers, forming the General Union of Textile Workers.

He is known for his works on Friedrich Schelling and Heidegger's philosophy. McGrath is the editor of Analecta Hermeneutica and a member of the College of New Scholars, Artists and Scientists of the Royal Society of Canada. Career McGrath‚Äôs publications and presentations since graduating from the University of Toronto in 2002 fall broadly into the area known as continental philosophy, but with an interdisciplinary focus that encompasses religion, ecology, and depth psychology. Three areas are predominant in his output: (1) the philosophy of religion and Christian theology; (2) the philosophy of nature; and (3) the philosophy of psychology. A major theme of his work concerns the legacy of religion in secular society. Where many theories of secularization speak of the progressive separation of culture from religion, McGrath understands the phenomenon to be far more complex. With thinkers such as Max Weber, Karl L√∂with, and Marcel Gauchet, McGrath maintains that secular society is itself a product of the Christian religion, and continues to depend upon it. McGrath explored the problem of secularization in his book, The Early Heidegger and Medieval Philosophy: Phenomenology for the Godforsaken (2006, reprinted 2013). Struck by the analogies between the thought of the early Heidegger and late medieval and early Protestant Christianity, McGrath discovered that the similarities were far from accidental. Through careful archival work in Germany, McGrath argued (with Max Scheler and Jacques Derrida), that Heidegger, an ex-seminarian and formerly devout Catholic, had secularized Christian concepts in Being and Time. Heidegger‚Äôs book went on to become a foundational text in 20th century atheist thought, and yet none of its major themes would be possible, according to McGrath, without Christianity. Theodore Kisiel described Phenomenology for the Godforsaken as ‚Äúa systematic and detailed dismantling of Heidegger‚Äôs deconstruction of medieval scholasticism ‚Ä¶ Substantial and novel, this work offers a significant and timely contribution to the Heidegger literature‚Äù (back cover). On the strength of this work, the Centre for Theology and Philosophy at the University of Nottingham, the theological think-tank headed by the Anglican theologian John Milbank, commissioned McGrath to write a short critique of Heidegger for theologians. McGrath‚Äôs second book, Heidegger: A (Very) Critical Introduction, extended the theological analysis of Heidegger into political terrain. McGrath argued for a clear connection between Heidegger‚Äôs Nazi sympathies and his relationship to Christianity. John Hughes described the book as ‚Äúone of the clearest and most elegantly written [accounts of Heidegger] I have come across‚Äù. The work of unraveling the complicated relationship of secular forms of thought to theology led McGrath to his next major project: psychoanalysis. McGrath‚Äôs examined how the psychoanalytical concept of the unconscious originates in German Idealism, especially the work of the German philosopher, Friedrich Schelling. With the support of a Humboldt fellowship, and after four years of research in Germany and Switzerland, McGrath published his third book, The Dark Ground of Spirit: Schelling and the Unconscious. The Dark Ground received many favorable reviews: ‚ÄúAmong the most imaginative, original, at times exhilarating, studies of Schelling to appear in recent years,‚Äù wrote Jason Wirth of Seattle University. ‚ÄúRarely has Schelling been written about with such clarity and passion,‚Äù wrote Paul C. Bishop of the University of Glasgow. ‚ÄúMcGrath‚Äôs careful research clinches the argument that the theosophical tradition of Boehme as received by Schellingian philosophy constitutes the root of the unconscious.‚Äù With Jason Wirth, McGrath founded the North American Schelling Society in 2011. McGrath is currently working on a study of the late Schelling‚Äôs philosophy of religion. It will be published in 2019 under the title Schelling and the End of Christianity. McGrath is active in environmental philosophy and interdisciplinary ecology. He has examined the theological origins of the ecological crisis in several articles. His recent publications have stressed the religious roots of consumerism, underscoring the need for an ethical transformation of the social imaginary if we are to meet the challenge of climate change. In his fourth book, Thinking Nature: An Essay in Negative Ecology (Edinburgh University Press, 2019), McGrath argues against a major trend in environmental theory that thinks ‚Äúnature is dead.‚Äù The concept of nature, however vague, remains vital, in McGrath‚Äôs view, to both metaphysics and to public ecological discourse, and has the potential to produce new meanings which could mobilize communities to creatively respond to climate change. The symbol of nature has a vague religious aura in contemporary culture, according to McGrath, precisely because ecology is a site‚Äîperhaps the last site‚Äîfor the resurgence of the sacred in a secular setting. The forgetting of nature leads directly to the ascendency of consumerism, which preys on the Western imaginary in dangerous ways. Only by remembering nature, McGrath argues, and what we owe to it, will we find the will to disengage from consumption. In 2015, with Kyla Bruff (doctoral candidate in Philosophy at Memorial) and Barry Stephenson (Religious Studies, Memorial) McGrath founded For a New Earth, a registered NPO in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador.

The seventh named storm of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, Gordon developed from a tropical wave that was first monitored in the Caribbean Sea on August 30. The wave moved west-northwestward toward the east coast of Florida while gradually organizing. The disturbance was marked as Potential Tropical Cyclone Seven on September 2 while near the Bahamas, and early the next day, it became Tropical Storm Gordon. The system made landfall on the southwest coast of Florida shortly afterwards. Steady intensification began after it moved off the coast of Florida and into the Gulf of Mexico. Gordon reached its peak intensity as a high-end tropical storm late on September 4 before making landfall just east of Pascagoula, Mississippi shortly afterwards. Gordon then rapidly weakened as it tacked inland, and degenerated into a remnant low on September 6. Gordon's remnants lingered over Arkansas for two days, before opening up into a low-pressure trough on September 8. At least three deaths were attributed to the storm, and Gordon caused approximately $200‚Äì250 million (2018 USD) in damages, making it the third-costliest tropical cyclone in the United States for the 2018 season. Meteorological history Tropical Storm Gordon arose from a tropical wave that left the west coast of Africa on August 26. The wave swiftly moved westward across the low-latitudes of the Atlantic, with only a slight amplification of convection occurring within the Intertropical Convergence Zone. As the wave neared the eastern Caribbean Sea on August 30, cloud cover and shower activity increased over the northern Lesser Antilles. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) first mentioned the wave as having potential for tropical development in the evening hours of the same day. The wave split in two soon after, with the northern half generating a surface trough that covered eastern Hispaniola and the nearby Atlantic waters. Although thunderstorms linked to the system increased, strong upper-level winds hindered development over the next two days. After the winds lessened on September 2, the disturbance's convection began to show signs of organization while it was located between eastern Cuba and the central Bahamas. The convection dwindled for a short time late on the same day before rapidly increasing early on September 3. Around that time, the system was located in a favorable environment of sea surface temperatures and low-to-moderate vertical wind shear. Subsequently, the system strengthened into a tropical depression around 06:00 UTC on September 3, while located 90 mi (150 km) southeast of Key Largo, Florida. alt=Satellite image of Tropical Storm Gordon hours after its second landfall in Florida on September 3 Continuing to organize, the depression quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Gordon three hours later as its convective structure improved. Meanwhile, the system was traveling northwestward around the edge of a subtropical ridge. Gordon made landfall near Tavernier in the Florida Keys at 11:15 UTC on September 3, with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). The tropical storm subsequently emerged over the Florida Bay and made a second landfall near Flamingo on the southern tip of Florida peninsula a couple of hours later, at 13:15 UTC, with the same intensity. Gordon then entered the Gulf of Mexico where additional strengthening ensued. The storm briefly displayed a 6 mi (9 km) wide eye-like feature on doppler weather radar around 18:00 UTC, while located off the coast of Marco Island; this feature disappeared a couple of hours later, however, the storm continued strengthening. Westerly wind shear temporarily disrupted the core of the system early on September 4; the low-level center was displaced to the southwestern boundary of the convection. The storm's structure primarily consisted of a compact central dense overcast with banding features over the eastern half of the system as a result of the shear. Towards the middle of September 4, Gordon began to improve in appearance, developing a band of deep convection near its distinct center; simultaneously, lightning activity increased significantly in the core of the storm. Gordon reached its peak intensity at 18:00 UTC on September 4 as a high-end tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph (110 km/h), while located approximately 130 mi (215 km) south-southeast of Pascagoula, Mississippi. The tropical storm's convection continued to organize around its center as it approached the coastline, however, collected surface and radar data indicated that the wind speed remained the same. Gordon achieved its minimum central pressure of as it made landfall between the Alabama/Mississippi border and Pascagoula around 03:15 UTC on September 5. After landfall, Gordon quickly deteriorated, weakening into a tropical depression by 12:00 UTC, while located 35 mi (55 km) southeast of Jackson, Mississippi. Early on September 6, the depression slowed down over southeastern Arkansas while maintaining its northwestward track. The storm degenerated into a remnant low at 18:00 UTC near Pine Bluff, before further weakening into a trough of low pressure by 00:00 UTC on September 8. The remnants of Gordon combined with an extratropical low later on September 8. The new system traveled northeastward during the next few days, generating torrential rainfall over western Kentucky and the Ohio Valley before dissipating near northern New York. Preparations, impact, and aftermath A series of watches and warnings was issued in association with Tropical Storm Gordon. Tropical storm watches were issued for the Alabama-Florida border to Morgan City, Louisiana as well as Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas at 21:00 UTC on September 2. These watches were later upgraded to warnings at 09:00 UTC on September 3. Shortly after Gordon became a tropical storm, tropical storm warnings were issued around 12:30 UTC for Golden Beach to Bonita Beach, Florida as well as Craig Key to Ocean Reef, including Florida Bay, in the Florida Keys. A hurricane watch was issued at 15:00 UTC for the mouth of the Pearl River to the Alabama-Florida border. At the same time, a tropical storm warning was issued for the Alabama-Florida border to the Okaloosa-Walton county line. The hurricane watch was replaced with a hurricane warning around 21:00 UTC on September 3. The watches and warnings were gradually discontinued over the next few days. =Florida= alt=Map of rainfall associated with Gordon and its extratropical remnants Tropical Storm Gordon brought gale-force winds and flooding rain to Florida and the Florida Keys. Gordon made its first landfall near Tavernier around 11:15 UTC on September 2. Overall, minor damage occurred in the Florida Keys; wind gusts up to gale-force caused a tree to fall across part of a county road located between Ocean Reef and Key Largo. The cyclone made another landfall near Flamingo at the southern tip of Florida a couple of hours later. Gordon caused torrential rainfall throughout the area, with a local peak of occurring in Homestead. Winds from the storm downed tree limbs, resulting in approximately 8,000 power outages throughout Miami-Dade and Broward counties. A 47-year-old man died on Interstate 95 in Miami after crashing his vehicle into a concrete barrier. Another crash closed lanes on the MacArthur Causeway, and a third accident halted traffic on two westbound lanes of Interstate 395 near U.S. Route 1. Gordon also affected the Florida Panhandle, including the city of Pensacola, where the storm's peak rainfall total of was recorded. In advance of Gordon's landfall, adverse weather conditions prompted flight delays and cancellations at the Pensacola International Airport. A tree fell onto a mobile home in Pensacola, trapping and killing a 2-year-old girl. Significant beach erosion occurred on the southeastern coast near Fort Lauderdale. Sizable portions of sand and numerous sea turtle nests were washed away by waves that Gordon produced; this left some sections in a barren state. Near Panama City in northwestern Florida, a large hole formed near a culvert at the Runaway Island Beach as a result of erosion. Algae blooms along the Gulf Coast of Florida spread further northwest to Tampa Bay in the days following Gordon's passage through the area. The spread killed thousands of fish, leaving carcasses floating in the water. The bloom also thickened in Fort Lauderdale, leaving \\"green, foul-smelling goop\\" in canals throughout the city. =Mississippi= =Alabama= Dauphin Island, Alabama bore the brunt of Gordon. A storm surge of 3‚Äì5 ft (0.9‚Äì1.5 m) struck the island, causing minor flooding.https://www.weather.gov/mob/gordon#Surge A one-minute sustained wind of and a peak gust of were also reported there. Homes on the island sustained roof and siding damage. Tropical-storm-force winds penetrated inland as far as Mobile Regional Airport, downing trees in areas of southern Mobile County. Farther inland, of rainfall caused flooding along several rivers, inundating streets and washing out dirt roads. =Louisiana= Gordon weakening over the lower Mississippi Valley on the morning of September 5Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency for the state, deploying 200 Louisiana National Guardsmen, 63 high-water trucks, 39 boats, and four helicopters. Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant and Alabama Governor Kay Ivey also declared states of emergencies. =Kentucky= A Louisville cab driver was killed after being trapped by flood waters. More than 3 inches (75 mm) of rain fell in Louisville, flooding streets, stranding cars, and causing the Louisville City FC soccer match to be suspended and the University of Louisville football game to be delayed. In Morehead, a young child was swept in flood water and recovery efforts were ongoing as of September 9, 2018. Four tornadoes were reported in Kentucky; two were rated as EF1 while the other two were classified as EF0. An EF1 tornado touched down near Stanley, nearly destroying a wall on one house and causing minor damage to others. It also deroofed multiple barns and sheds and leveled corn and tobacco crops; the total damage from the tornado was estimated at $110,000. Another EF1 tornado occurred between Maceo and Yelvington, causing $3,000 in damage to trees and the soffit of a house. An EF0 tornado near Lewisport and Adair downed tree limbs and snapped tree trunks, blocking roads and damaging the roof of a house; the tornado also damaged the metal roof of a barn. Total damage was estimated at $6,000. Approximately $5,000 in crop damage was caused by an EF0 tornado that touched down near Sorgho. =Missouri= On September 7, A Greene County Sheriff's Deputy was killed after his patrol vehicle was washed off of a rural county road at an unmarked low-water crossing at the Pomme de Terre River at the Greene County and Dallas County line during a bout of torrential rains. The deputy had been in the area responding to a 911-hang up call, likely as a result of the weather. =Elsewhere= The remnants of Gordon merged with a cold front, spawning two EF0 tornadoes in Indiana. The second tornado touched down near Newtonville; no damage was reported.

Formed in mid-1943, the corps served with the 37th Army during most of World War II. It fought in the advance southwest from the Dnieper and into Romania and Bulgaria until August 1944. After the advance to Bulgaria it remained there on garrison duty for the rest of the war. Postwar, the corps transferred to the Odessa Military District, where it was renumbered as the 25th Rifle Corps in 1955.  World War II  The corps was formed as part of the 34th Army of the Northwestern Front on 15 July 1943 under the command of Major General Pavel Kuznetsov, who led it for the rest of the war. It initially existed as a headquarters without assigned troops, and transferred to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command in August with the 1st and 10th Guards Airborne Divisions. In September it was transferred to the 37th Army of the Steppe Front (the 2nd Ukrainian Front from 20 October), being reinforced by the 188th Rifle Division. The corps fought in the capture of Left-bank Ukraine east of Kremenchuk, then crossed the Dnieper and captured a bridgehead northwest of Mishurin Rog during the Battle of the Dnieper. Between October and December it attacked towards Krivoi Rog. The 1st Guards Airborne was replaced by the 89th Guards Rifle Division in October, and the latter was replaced by the 28th Guards Rifle Division the following month. The 15th Guards Rifle Division replaced the 10th Guards Airborne in January 1944. Soviet troops entering Krivoy Rog in February 1944 Transferred to the 3rd Ukrainian Front with the army in mid-January, the corps fought in the advance into Right-bank Ukraine during the Dnieper‚ÄìCarpathian Offensive, participating in the Nikopol‚ÄìKrivoi Rog Offensive, the Bereznegovatoye‚ÄìSnigirevka Offensive, and the Odessa Offensive. In these operations it advanced 350 kilometers, crossing the Inhulets, Inhul, Southern Bug, and Dniester while helping to capture the cities of Krivoi Rog, Voznesensk, and Tiraspol. The 10th Guards Airborne briefly returned to the corps in February and the 15th Guards left it in March. The 10th Guards Airborne was replaced by the 92nd Guards Rifle Division in April; the corps would include the 28th and 92nd Guards and the 188th for the rest of the war. The 82nd fought in the Jassy‚ÄìKishinev Offensive and the advance into Bulgaria in August. This was its last combat action, as it spent the rest of the war on garrison duty in Bulgaria.  Postwar  On 10 June 1945, the 82nd became part of the Southern Group of Forces along with the rest of the 37th Army, when the 3rd Ukrainian Front was redesignated. By spring 1946, the corps had been relocated to Odessa in the Odessa Military District. The corps included the 34th Guards Mechanized Division (the former 92nd Guards Rifle Division) at Mykolaiv, the 28th Guards Rifle Division at Odessa, and the 188th Rifle Division at Voznesensk. The latter was soon transferred to Zaporizhia, where it became the 52nd Separate Rifle Brigade. By 1955, its headquarters had moved to Mykolaiv in the same district.

Modelled by Lord Somers on the Elizabethan Bond of Association, it placed intense pressure on nonresistant Tories in public life to acknowledge William as \\"rightful and lawful King\\". The Association was widely subscribed to by the public, extending well beyond the circle of officials Somers had targeted, and soon assumed the force of law, all Crown officials being required by statute to subscribe to it. Some Tories were purged from office for failure to do so, and the Association remained in legal force until 1702, when William's death rendered it a nullity and the requirement to subscribe to it was repealed. Background While High Tories opposed to James II of England's religious policies played an important role in the Glorious Revolution, many had uneasy consciences over the events that followed. The legal fiction in the Bill of Rights 1689 that James had abdicated his throne did not, in their minds, abrogate the oaths to him that they had previously taken. The new oath prescribed to replace the oaths of allegiance and supremacy required those swearing it to \\"be Faithfull and beare true Allegiance to Their Majestyes King William and Queene Mary\\".https://www.british-history.ac.uk/statutes- realm/vol6/pp57-60 While the nonjurors were unable to reconcile even this to their consciences, some Tories adopted a policy of nonresistance; while they did not recognize William and Mary's right to rule, they consented to cooperate with their regime insofar as it existed. Lord Somers championed bills in Parliament in April 1691/2 and December 1692 which would have imposed oaths abjuring James and acknowledging William's right to the crown, but both were defeated. The attempted assassination of William in February 1696 gave Somers another chance to drive Tories of doubtful loyalty from public life. Creation and initial reception Somers examined the state papers and used the Bond of Association, promulgated in 1584 after the failure of the Throckmorton plot against Elizabeth I of England, as a model for drawing up an association in defense of William. As recited in the Act of Parliament that officially sanctioned it, the text of the association was as follows:https://www.british-history.ac.uk/statutes-realm/vol7/pp114-118 > Whereas there has been a horrid and detestable Conspiracy formed & carried > on by Papists and other wicked and traiterous Persons for assassinating His > Majesties Royal Person in order to incourage an Invasion from France to > subvert our Religion Laws and Liberty Wee whose Names are hereunto > subscribed doe heartily sincerely and solemnly professe testifie and declare > That His present Majesty King William is rightfull and lawfull King of these > Realmes And wee doe mutually promise and engage to stand by and assist each > other to the utmost of our Power in the Support and Defence of His Majesties > most Sacred Person and Government against the late King James and all his > Adherents And in case His Majesty come to any violent or untimely Death > (which God forbid) Wee doe hereby further freely and unanimously oblige > ourselves to associate and stand by each other in revenging the same upon > His Enemies and their Adherents and in supporting and defending the > Succession of the Crowne according to an Act made in the First Yeare of the > Reigne of King William and Queen Mary entituled An Act declaring the Rights > and Liberties of the Subject and settling the Succession of the Crowne. The King appeared in Parliament on 24 February 1696 to announce the breaking up of the plot against him, and appealed to Parliament to take (unspecified) measures to ensure the common safety. Sir Rowland Gwynne moved that Parliament should join in an association to defend the King, and introduced the text prepared by Somers. The Association was adopted by the House of Commons on the 25th and the House of Lords on the 27th, although by March 3, 113 MPs and a few dozen peers had still not signed the document. While the Association was, at this point, still a voluntary bond, social pressure was brought to bear on those who had not signed. A list of non-associators was published in a partisan pamphlet, A Summary Account of the Proceedings upon the happy discovery of the Jacobite Conspiracy. While the pamphlet was condemned as a breach of Parliamentary privileges for publishing excerpts from speeches in both houses, the overall campaign was effective, and several of those named in the pamphlet subsequently signed the Association. Widespread printing and better communications allowed the Association of 1696 to be much more rapidly disseminated than that of 1584. While the Association had originally been intended as a device to bind officeholders and gentry to the King, it proved to be wildly popular among the lower classes as well. Lists of subscribers to the Association were brought to the King from counties throughout England, usually by Lord Lieutenants, their deupties, or Members of Parliament. The volume of subscriptions briefly overwhelmed the Royal administration. On the suggestion of the Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir John Trevor, they were deposited among the records in the Tower of London in April 1696. Passage into law Shortly thereafter, the Association was written into law. The Security of King and Government Act 1695 (passed in 1696 and backdated to the beginning of the Parliamentary session) endorsed the Association and ordered all officers and those receiving pay under the Crown, as well as the households of Prince George and Princess Anne, to subscribe to it within the following year. Future officers and appointees were to subscribe to the Association when they took the oath prescribed by the Test Act; those who failed to subscribe were to forfeit their office, and if they continued to exercise it, be subject to the Test Act's penalties for recusancy. Members of the House of Commons were henceforth to subscribe to the Association when they took their appointed oaths, or be disabled from sitting in Parliament and forfeit their seats. The courts of Chancery and King's Bench, and the courts of quarter sessions, were to keep records of subscribers, and of those who had refused to subscribe. By late July, 86 justices of the peace and 104 deputy lieutenants had been removed from office for failing to subscribe to the Association, or in a few cases subscribing late and without enthusiasm. Later years The Signing the Association, etc. Act 1698 postponed the date after which non-subscribers would forfeit their offices until 1 August 1700.https://www.british-history.ac.uk/statutes-realm/vol7/pp606-607 After the death of James II in 1701, the Security of the Succession, etc. Act 1701 amended the form of the Association, replacing \\"against the late King James and all his Adherents\\" with \\"against all His Majesties Enemies whatsoever\\".https://www.british-history.ac.uk/statutes-realm/vol7/pp747-750 After the death of King William in 1702, the Association became a nullity, and the Security of the Succession, etc. Act 1702 relieved MPs and officeholders from the necessity of subscribing to it.

Van Meter also served as the college's first dean and as acting president from 1911 to 1913.  Early life and education  Van Meter was born on September 6, 1842, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Thomas Hurley Van Meter and Johnetta Blackford. He was of English and French descent, and his grandmother was a Quaker. He graduated from Male Central High School in Baltimore, which later became Baltimore City College. Van Meter did not pursue a college degree, which he said was due to his lack of financial means.  Career  = Methodist ministry and Navy = After graduating high school, Van Meter worked as a teacher and later as a principal for several local schools. After briefly contemplating studying law, he instead pursued a career in the Methodist ministry. In the 1860s, he was a minister and preacher at several churches in Maryland and Pennsylvania. In December 1866, Van Meter married Lucinda Cassell of Westminster, Maryland. In December 1871, Van Meter was commissioned into the United States Navy as a chaplain and confirmed by the Senate in January 1872. He resigned from the Navy in April 1882. = Founding of the Women's College of Baltimore City = Through his involvement with the Methodist church in the Baltimore area, he became acquainted with fellow minister John Franklin Goucher, who would advocate for Van Meter's appointment to the annual Baltimore Methodist Conference. In the early 1880s, the Baltimore Conference was considering the establishment of a women's college, deliberations in which Van Meter and Goucher became heavily involved. The women of the conference formed an association through which they pushed for such an institution, and Van Meter supported their efforts, at one point exclaiming that \\"the Conference [should] make the foundation and endowment of a female college the single object of its organized effort.\\" Goucher and his wife, Mary Fisher Goucher, offered to help endow the institution, and in 1885, the Women's College of Baltimore City, now Goucher College, was chartered. = Dean and acting president of Goucher = In 1910, the Women's College of Baltimore was renamed to Goucher College, in honor of co-founder John Goucher. 1911, Goucher's third president, Eugene Allan Noble, stepped down. Van Meter, who was then the dean, was asked by the board of trustees to serve as acting president while they searched for a permanent replacement. Van Meter held the position of acting president from 1911 to 1913, during which time financial difficulties, namely persistent annual deficits and growing debt, threatened the survival of the school. With support from nearby educational institutions and associates and alumni of the college, the college completed a $1-million fundraising campaign, which was enough to sustain it. Van Meter reassumed his position as dean when the administration named William Westley Guth as the college's fourth president. Van Meter also remained on the faculty as a professor of English and biblical studies. Van Meter stepped down from his position as dean at Goucher in 1914, and in 1920 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the school.  Later years  Van Meter lived out his final years in Baltimore, Maryland. He died in 1930 and was buried in Green Mount Cemetery.

The yellow and the left green tip measure the voltages at their respective positions which builds up due to the injected current. Multi-tip scanning tunneling microscopy (Multi-tip STM) extends scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) from imaging to dedicated electrical measurements at the nanoscale like a ‚Ä≥multimeter at the nanoscale‚Ä≥. In materials science, nanoscience, and nanotechnology, it is desirable to measure electrical properties at a particular position of the sample. For this purpose, multi-tip STMs in which several tips are operated independently have been developed. Apart from imaging the sample, the tips of a multi-tip STM are used to form contacts to the sample at desired locations and to perform local electrical measurements.  Introduction  As microelectronics evolves into nanoelectronics, it is essential to perform electronic transport measurements at nanoscale. The standard approach is to use lithographic methods to contact nanostructures, as it is also used in the final nanoelectronic device. In research and development stages, however, other methods to contact nanoelectronic devices or generally nanostructures may be more suitable. An alternative approach for contacting nanostructures uses the tips of a multi-tip scanning tunneling microscope‚Äîin analogy to the test leads of a multimeter used at macroscale. The advantages of this approach are: (a) in situ contacting of ‚Ä≥as grown‚Ä≥ nanostructures still under vacuum helps keep delicate nanostructures free from contamination induced by lithography steps performed for contacting. (b) Flexible positioning of the contacting tips and different contact configurations are easy to realize, while lithographic contacts are fixed. (c) Probing with sharp tips can be non-invasive (high ohmic), while lithographic contacts are typically invasive (low ohmic). To use a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) for electrical transport measurements at nanostructures or at surfaces, more than one tip is required. This motivates the use of multi-tip scanning tunneling microscopes which give access to the above outlined advantages in nanoprobing. Several review articles about multi-tip STM can be found in the further reading section below. Four-tip STM with the four tips pointing up in the center. The diameter of the instrument is 50 mm.  Principle of operation  Multi-tip scanning tunneling microscopes consist usually of four STM units positioning each of the tips individually to the desired position on the sample. To reduce thermal drift of the tips, the four STM units, should be as small and compact as possible. It is important that the motion of the tips can be observed, either by an optical microscope, or by a scanning electron microscope (SEM). This allows to bring the tips close together and to position them at the desired measurement locations. The tips in a multi tip STM are usually mounted under 45¬∞ relative to the vertical direction to facilitate positioning all tips at one region on the sample. After the first multi-tip STM was introduced, several home-built instruments were designed and today, several commercial instruments are available as well. An extension of the multi-tip STM technique is the upgrade to atomic force microscopy (AFM) operation. For applications in nanoelectronics, most of the samples consist of conducting \\"target\\" areas at the surface, separated by non- conducting areas. To guide the tip to the conducting areas, AFM imaging instead of or in addition to optical microscope or SEM guided positioning of the tips, can be very useful. In a two-point measurement the sum of the sample resistance and the resistance of the contacts is measured. In a four-point measurement the sample resistance is measured without the influence of the contact resistance. When performing electrical measurements on the nanoscale, it should be stressed that the contact resistance is often very large at the STM tip contact to the sample because the contact area is very small, so that four-point measurements are indispensable in resistance measurements with a muti-tip STM. This is even more important in measuring nano-scale objects, because the contacts to these objects are inevitably nano-scale. In a two- point resistance measurement, the two current injecting tips are used for voltage probing as well. Therefore, the measured resistance R = V/I also includes the contribution from the two contact resistances RC. In a four-point measurement the current injecting circuit is separated from the voltage sensing circuit. If the voltage measurement is performed with a large internal resistance RV, the influence of the contact resistances can be neglected. This is the main advantage of the four-point measurement. Schematic of electrical measurements performed with a multi-tip STM. Each tip can be configured as current probe or as voltage probe. The simplest example of an electrical measurement is a classical four-point resistance measurement. Performing electrical measurements with a multi-tip STM demands more than four tips and the ability to position them as required. Concerted measurements of currents and voltages with all four tips must be performed. The electronics allows operating each tip either as (biased) current probe, or as voltage probe. Different I-V ramps are applied between different tips (and/or the sample). In the simplest case a current is injected between the two outer tips and a potential difference is measured between the inner tips (classical four-point measurement). However, also various kinds of other measurements can be performed, e.g., a tip or the sample can be used as gate electrode.  Applications of multi-tip STM  = Graphene nanoribbons and graphene nanostructures = The local transport properties of 40 nm wide graphene nanoribbons grown on silicon carbide (SiC) substrates, are studied by means of a multi-tip STM. The graphene nanoribbons exhibit exceptional transport properties, such as ballistic conduction even at room temperature with mean free paths up to several ¬µm. Such epitaxial graphene nanoribbons are important not only in fundamental science, but also because they can be readily produced in thousands in advanced nanoelectronics, which can make use of their room- temperature ballistic transport properties. SEM image of four probes contacting a graphene nanoribbon = Resistance profiling along freestanding GaAs nanowires = The multi-tip STM can be used for resistance mapping along freestanding GaAs nanowires with a diameter of about 100 nm. The nanowires are still ‚Äúas grown‚Äù upright and attached to the substrate, thus it is not possible to contact nanowires by lithographic techniques. In the measurement configuration shown in the figure, the sample is tilted by 45¬∞ to facilitate optimal SEM imaging of the nanowires. Three tips brought into contact with a nanowire realize a four-point resistance measurement (with the sample as fourth contact). Tip 1 injects the current to the nanowire with the sample acting as current drain, while tip 2 and tip 3 act as voltage probes. While it is relatively easy to study the structure of these nanowires e.g., with high resolution electron microscopy, it is difficult to access the electrical properties determined by the doping profile along the nanowire. From the measuremed four-point resistance along the nanowire a doping profile along the nanowire can be obtained. {style=\\"margin: 0 auto;\\"  Left: Schematic of a four-point measurement on a nanowire with three tips contacting the nanowire. Right: SEM image of a freestanding nanowire contacted by three tips. The STM tips act like the test leads of a multimeter, however, contacting objects like the nanowire at the nanoscale.  Movie of an STM tip moving along a GaAs nanowire measuring a four-point probe resistance profile at many points along the nanowire. } = Multi-tip potentiometry = A method giving valuable insight into the charge transport properties of nanostructures is the scanning tunneling potentiometry (STP). STP can be performed with a multi-tip STM and allows to map the potential landscape while a current flows through the film, nanostructure, or surface under study. Potentiometry maps give insight into fundamental transport properties, such as the influence of defects on the local electric transport. The implementation is shown in the figure, with the outer tips injecting a current into the nanostructure or surface being studied, while then center tip simultaneously measures the topography and also records the electric potential at each image point which is induced by the flowing current. This way a potential map measured e.g on a silicon surface can be acquired with a potential resolution is a couple of ¬µV. The potential map in the figure shows that the largest potential drop occurs at the atomic step edges. From these data the resistance of a single atomic step, or a domain boundary can be obtained. Moreover, if a current flows around a nanoscale defect like. e.g.. a void, the potential map developing due to the flowing current can be measured. {style=\\"margin: 0 auto;\\"  Left: Schematic of the scanning tunneling potentiometry setup implemented into the multi-tip scanning tunneling microscope.

As nano-devices become smaller and smaller, the surface to volume ratio (i.e., the fraction of atoms located at the surface) increases constantly. The increasing importance of surface conductance compared to conductance through the bulk in modern nanoelectronic devices calls for a reliable determination of the surface conductivity to minimize the influence of undesired leakage currents on the device performance or to use surfaces as functional units. A model system for corresponding investigations is the Si(111)-7√ó7 surface. The challenge is to disentangle the contribution due to the surface conductivity from the bulk conductivity. Using multi-tip STM, researchers developed a method that uses distance dependent four-probe measurements in the linear configuration to determine surface conductivity. = Spin current in quantum materials = The spin voltage is generated by the electron‚Äôs spin current. (Credit: Saban Hus and An-Ping Li/Oak Ridge National Laboratory, U.S. Dept. of Energy). Multi-tip STM is used as a method for the detection of the spin- voltage in topological insulators using spin-polarized four-probe scanning tunneling microscopy on Bi2Te2Se surfaces. The spin-dependent electrochemical potential is separated from the ohmic contribution. This component is identified as the spin-chemical potential arising from the 2D charge current through the spin momentum locked topological surface states (TSS). The new method uses a magnetic tip to observe the spin behavior of electrons on the material‚Äôs surface.

She was awarded Begum Rokeya Padak by the Government of Bangladesh posthumously in 2019. Early life Chowdhury was born on 14 October 1936 at Popadia village in Boalkhali Upazila of Chittagong. In 1961, she graduated with a master's degree in Bengali literature from University of Dhaka and known as the first woman to hold this degree from the Southern part of Chittagong. Career In the following year 1962, Chowdhury commenced her career as the principal of Cox's Bazar High School and for the next 16 years she served the same role at different colleges in Bangladesh. Besides teaching she wrote in a fortnightly magazine and later she took writing as her sole profession. In her lifetime, she has authored around 20 books including poetry,novels and memoirs. After the Liberation War, Rama went through severe financial crisis but she never asked for anyone's help. She wrote and sold her own books from door to door and this remained her only source of income. She wrote 19 books which included articles collection, novels, and poetry. Personal life Chowdhury gave birth to three sons and her first two sons died within the two years after the Liberation War, they were only five and three years old then. Her third child died in a road accident in 1998. Chowdhury buried her three sons underground defying against the traditional Hindu funeral system, which she did not agree with. After the death of her third child, she never wore shoes. Rama said that she could not walk with shoes over the same soil where her three children are buried because they would be hurt.

The discrimination has had manifestations in public, working and educational places.  Analysis  Hijabophobia is a term referring to discrimination against women wearing Islamic veils, including the hijab, chador, niqƒÅb and burqa. It is considered a gender-specific type of Islamophobia, or simply \\"hostility towards the hijab\\". The term is applied to discourse based in colonial representations of Muslim women as victims oppressed by misogynistic cultures, in academic circles. According to The Gazette, hijabophobia began as a French national phenomenon, citing the 1989 headscarf affair (). In France, according to Ayhan Kaya, Islamophobia is mixed with hijabophobia. In a 2012 paper, Hamzeh posits that 'hijabophobia' encapsulates the sexist aspects of Islamophobia, where Muslim women bear the brunt of anti-Muslim attacks. Political scientist Vincent Geisser argues that hijabophobia became more widespread after the September 11 attacks, as evidenced by the number of laws regulating and restricting hijab in public places and governmental offices. A study found that Muslim girls in London perceived discrimination when wearing hijab outside their immediate communities, and felt social pressure to not wear hijab. In addition, according to the ACLU, 69% of women who wore hijab reported at least one incident of discrimination compared to 29% of women who did not wear hijab.  Manifestations  = Working places = European Court of Justice A ruling by European Union's top law court, European Court of Justice, on 14 March 2017 allowed the employers \\"to ban staff from wearing visible religious symbols\\" such as the hijab. The decision was criticized for disguising what Muslims described as \\"a direct attack on women wearing hijabs at work\\". As a result, by 2017, two women from France and Belgium were dismissed from work since they refused to remove their hijabs. Samira Achbita, a woman from Belgium, was dismissed from working in her company (G4S) as a result of the court ruling. OpenDemocracy argued that the ruling was ostensibly based on the employer's wish \\"to portray a position of neutrality\\", and hence the court ruling was a normalization of hijabophobia. =Public places= There are instances where Muslim dress have been banned in public spaces. The Muslim burqa was banned by local laws in Spain in 2010, though these laws began to be overturned by the Spanish Supreme Court in 2013. Similarly, in 2016, France's Council of State began to overrule a ban on the burkini by over thirty French municipalities as Islamophobic. FIFA's ban of the head cover in 2011‚Äì2014 is an example of hijabophobia. In 2018, Austria banned full-face coverings in order to limit the visibility of orthodox Islam. This was criticized by police who were put in the position of charging people for wearing smog and ski masks. France and Belgium have enacted a similar ban since 2011. In 2015, a partial ban was introduced in the Netherlands and the German parliament banned face coverings while driving in September 2017. Hijabophobia also influences the hospitality industry in Malaysia. Hotels believe employees that wear the headdress appear less professional; therefore causing islamophobic policies to be implemented. = Schools = In 1994, the French Ministry for Education sent out recommendations to teachers and headmasters to ban Islamic veil in educational institutions. According to a 2019 study by the Institute of Labor Economics, more girls with a Muslim background born after 1980 graduated from high school after the ban was introduced. In October 2018, Austria banned headscarves for children in kindergarten. The ban was motivated by protecting children from family pressure to wear the headscarf. According to an Austrian teacher's union, a ban for pupils aged up to 14 years should be considered as that is the religious legal age (). In Quebec, public servants including teachers are banned from wearing religious garments such as a kippa, hijab or turban at work. = Brands = In 2019, Decathlon, a French sportswear brand, made the decision to not sell hijab sportswear in France, following opposition to the clothing line from figures such as health minister Agnes Buzyn, who voiced her distaste for the garment on a radio show. = Sports = Hijabophobia has led female athletes to be ineligible in sporting events due to wearing a Hijab. One example is FIFA's ‚Äò hijab ban‚Äô crisis. The Iranian women's national soccer team was disqualified from the 2012 Olympics because the players wore Hijabs.

Along with Galley, who joined the company at the same time, Zimmerman has been credited with driving the growth of Mercury Asset Management during the 1980s and 1990s. The author Philip Augar wrote of Mercury in the 1980s and 1990s: ‚ÄúUnder the leadership of [Peter] Stormonth Darling and then the triumvirate of Hugh Stevenson, Carol Galley and Stephen Zimmerman, Mercury caught the rising tide of instructional investment in the UK quite brilliantly.‚Äù Following the sale of Mercury to Merrill Lynch in 1997, Zimmerman stayed on with Galley to lead the integration process as co-heads. Just as they had joined in the same year and worked closely over the following 30 years, they left at the same time, announcing their departure in March 2001. When reporting on Zimmerman and Galley‚Äôs decision to leave Merrill, the Wall Street Journal cited Zimmerman as saying that he ‚Äòwouldn‚Äôt be surprised to end up sharing an office with [Galley] again‚Äô. Writing at the same time, Daily Telegraph columnist, Neil Collins, predicted they‚Äôd set up a boutique investment firm together. In the 2003, Zimmerman did set up a boutique, but with other ex-Merrill colleagues, Michael Marks and Paul Roy (as opposed to Galley, who remained in retirement). The new Venture was called NewSmith in a nod, Smith New Court, another City institution bought by Merrill Lynch in the 1990s and previously run by Marks and Roy. NewSmith did well during the financial crisis, though asset under management declined during the following decade. In an echo of his departure from Merrill Lynch, Zimmerman retired at the same time as co-founder, Marks (NewSmith was acquired by Man Group less than a year later).

For many years, she provided services for the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), acting as delegate from the local to the district, state and national conventions. Her essays, addresses and reports showed her to be a talented writer. Benevolence was said to be the one underlying trait of her character. Early years and education Anna Augusta Pattin was born in Canaan, New Hampshire, in 1837. Her father was Daniel G. Pattin. Her mother, Ruth Chase Whittier, was related to Governor Salmon P. Chase and the poet John Greenleaf Whittier. At an early age, her father emigrated to Upstate New York, where she was educated by private tutors. She subsequently spent two years in College Hills Seminary. Career She married John P. Ramsey in 1860. They settled in the South, where they resided until the American Civil War, when, on account of diametrical differences of opinion between themselves and the inhabitants, they returned to the North, but at a large sacrifice of personal and other property. Here, in 1864, Mr. Ramsey died. Joshua Truitt On May 17, 1864, in Mansfield, Ohio, she married Joshua Truitt (1830‚Äì1894), a businessman of Muncie, Indiana. He brought with him two children, Lola and Stanley, his first wife having died the previous December. The family made their home in Muncie, where Truitt became actively engaged in benevolent and philanthropic work. During the Civil War, she was untiring in her labors in behalf of the Union Army, preparing bandages and scraping lint for the use of the surgeons, and collecting provisions, clothing, blankets, and hundreds of other things useful and needful to the soldiers. She marched, sang and prayed with them. After the war, she became engaged in the work of the WCTU. She served as president of the Delaware County, Indiana WCTU for several years, and was selected by the Union to represent them in state and district meetings, as well as in the national convention in Tennessee in November l887. She was the Indiana temperance delegate to the International Sunday School Convention held at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in June 1890, and her report of its proceedings was accepted without alteration or amendment, which spoke well for her accuracy, lucidity, and logical trend of thought. In the WCTU, she adhered to the principle of nonpartisan, nonsectarian work. In a blue-ribbon temperance club, she was an untiring worker and spared neither time, effort nor means in advancing its interests. She was also an advocate of suffrage, believing that woman's vote would go far towards the cause of temperance. For years, she was identified with the industrial school of Muncie, serving as an officer, as well as performing duties in its meetings and those pertaining to the executive department. Her presence was familiar in the homes of the poor, carrying sympathy, counsel and needed food and clothing. In this connection, there was probably no other one woman in Muncie known to more children than Truitt, who was constantly performing for them some work of kindness. Personal life She had no children of her own, but she took into her family the four children of her deceased brother, taking on the role of their mother. For many years, Truitt was an attendant of the Presbyterian church. She died June 9, 1920, and was buried at Beech Grove Cemetery, in Muncie.

The union was founded in 1859, shortly after the Bolton Cardroom Association, the two being the oldest unions of cardroom workers to endure. In its early years, the union organised only strippers and grinders, and was only open to men. This caused problems in 1867 when women workers, who were not permitted to join the union, agreed to accept a 5 per cent cut in wages. As a result, the union lost a strike against a 10 per cent cut in its own members' wages. The union was a founder constituent of the Cardroom Amalgamation in 1886, but at the time it had only 91 members, despite having broaden its base by becoming the Stockport Association of Card and Blowing Room Operatives, Ring and Throstle Spinners. However, this proved the start of a rapid growth in membership, which reached 670 by 1892, 1,023 in 1895, and 1,835 in 1908. The union had adopted the name Stockport Card, Blowing and Ring Room Operatives' Association by 1919, and its membership continued growing, peaking at 3,349 in 1936, at which time it was the fifth-largest union of cardroom workers. It changed its name again, to the Stockport Card and Ring Spinning Room Operatives' Association. Membership of the union declined in line with employment in the Lancashire cotton industry, and in 1967 it merged with the Hyde and District Card, Blowing and Ring Frame Operatives' Association and the South East Lancashire Provincial Card and Blowing Room Operatives' Association, forming the South East Lancashire and Cheshire Textile Operatives' Association.

As a still life painter he created game pieces and trompe l'oeil still lifes of game birds.Ma Pacco, 'Fran√ßois Xavier Joseph Jacquin' in: Dictionnaire des peintres belges  Life  Fran√ßois Xavier Joseph Jacquin was born in Brussels. He commenced his art studies at the Acad√©mie Royale des Beaux-Arts in 1768 and later moved to Antwerp where he trained in the workshop of Hendrik-Jozef Antonissen, a painter of landscapes and cattle. Here he also befriended the landscape painter Balthasar Paul Ommeganck.Edward Van Even, Fran√ßois Xavier Joseph Jacquin in the Biographie Nationale de Belgique, Volume 10, p. 86 He moved to Leuven in 1776 where he became a student of Laurent Geedts, a still life painter. Trompe l‚Äôoeil still life of game birds He married Anna Maria Simons of Leuven in 1777. The couple had 14 children of whom only two survived into adulthood. He initially devoted himself to still lifes and then from 1780 onwards he became in demand as a portrait painter. After gaining a commission to paint Simon Wouters the prelate of the Park Abbey in Heverlee near Leuven, he was able to obtain many further commissions from religious dignitaries including the archbishop of Mechelen Franckenberg and of professors of Leuven University. These portrait commissions kept him particularly busy. Portrait of Mrs. De Virieu of Zaltbommel He painted a portrait of the Austrian Emperor Francis II for the city hall of Leuven in 1792. This work was engraved by Antoine Cardon and displayed in the city hall of Leuven where it was burnt on 21 January 1795 by citizens of Leuven. He became the appointed portraitist of the notables and bourgeois of Leuven but also recruited his clientele in Hainaut, Brabant and The Netherlands. After the invasion of the Southern Netherlands by the French in 1794, Jacquin's commission work dried up and he gave up painting to trade in wine and cloth.Fran√ßois Xavier Joseph Jacquin, A Trompe l‚ÄôOeil Still Life of a Partridge, Woodcock and Spotted Woodpecker hanging from Nails against a white-washed Wall at John Bennett Fine Arts, London Jacquin was together with Josse-Pieter Geedts, Frans Berges, Pieter- Jozef Verhaghen, Pieter Goyers, Martin van Dorne and Antoon Clevenbergh one of the founders of the Academy of Fine Arts of Leuven in 1800. After the founding of the Academy, Jaquin's artistic career took off again and he re-established himself as a portrait painter to the world of merchants and the middle classes of Leuven. One of his pupils at the Academy was Henri van der Haert. He died on 1 November 1826 in Leuven.  Work  Fran√ßois Xavier Joseph was mainly a portrait painter but he also created still life paintings and landscapes. He produced accurately observed depictions of birds. In his portraits, Jacquin aimed to render a realistic portrait of the sitter. He painted the clothes, furniture and architecture in his portraits with great attention to detail. His palette is bright and fresh. Street scene His still lifes were typically closely observed depictions of birds, often draped over the edge of a table. These works are somewhat reminiscent of the works of the Dutch still painter Elias Vonck. His illusionist work continued the tradition of trompe l'oeil still lifes of game of the Netherlandish masters of the 17th century such as Cornelis Norbertus Gysbrechts, Jacob Biltius and Cornelis Biltius. Jacquin's illusionist works of birds against plain walls use natural light and shade effects together with accurate painting of the plumage to create the illusionistic effect that they are real. Jacquin also painted a few realistic street scenes.Francois Xavier Joseph Jacquin, Street scene At Tajan 4 November 2011 lot 118  References   External links  * 1756 births 1826 deaths Flemish still life painters Flemish portrait painters People from Leuven ","title":"Fran√ßois Xavier Joseph Jacquin"},{"id":"58388346","text":"Avdotyino () is a rural locality (a village) in Semyonovskoye Rural Settlement, Stupinsky District, Moscow Oblast, Russia.

De Kay (1825).This timeline of eurypterid research is a chronologically ordered list of important fossil discoveries, controversies of interpretation, and taxonomic revisions of eurypterids, a group of extinct aquatic arthropods closely related to modern arachnids and horseshoe crabs that lived during the Paleozoic Era. The scientific study of eurypterids began in the early 19th century when James E. DeKay recognized a fossil that had previously been described as that of a fish as arthropod in nature. Though DeKay erroneously believed the fossil to represent a crustacean and a missing link between trilobites and branchiopods, the fossil became the type species of first ever eurypterid to be scientifically described, Eurypterus remipes, in 1825.Clarke, J.

Nanahughmilleria was one of the many products of major taxonomic revisals by eurypterid researchers in the 1960s. 1961 *Kjellesvig-Waering described the new species Salteropterus longilabium, Pterygotus (Pterygotus) denticulatus, P. (P.) grandidentatus, P. (P.) lightbodyi, Carcinosoma harleyi and Dolichopterus bulbosus. The new genus Parahughmilleria is described with P. salteri as the type species. Hughmilleria bellistriata, H. phelpsae and Eurypterus maria are moved to this genus. The subgenus Erettopterus is regarded as a new genus and is separated into two new subgenera, E. (Erettopterus), including the new species E. (E.) brodiei, E. (E.) marstoni and E. (E.) spatulatus, and E. (Truncatiramus), including the new subspecies E. (T.) gigas megalodon.

History In the early 1970s, Fr Jonathan Robinson, at that time a priest of the Archdiocese of Montreal, gathered together several young men to live as a pious community under the patronage and inspiration of St Philip Neri. On the first of November 1975 (Solemnity of All Saints), the Holy See gave its approval to this community and thereby erected the Montreal Oratory. A few years later, in 1979, the Apostolic Visitor of the Oratory recommended that the Oratory be transplanted to Toronto. At the invitation of Cardinal Carter, the Oratory moved to Toronto and was put in charge of Holy Family Church where it presently remains. In 1995 they would also be asked to takeover the neighbouring parish of St Vincent de Paul on Roncesvalles Avenue. In 1997, Holy Family Church would burn down in a fire and the Oratory would use St Vincent's as their main church until the new Holy Family was finished in 2001.With 11 priests, 2 brothers, and two brother in priestly formation, it is now the largest English speaking Oratorian community.

Bryan was a publisher, writer, poet, and journalist who is best known today for creating the home economics magazine Good Housekeeping that he would manage from 1885 until his death in 1899, during which time he published more than a hundred of his own poems in its issues. Prior to this, Bryan was extensively involved in the reorganization of the Springfield Republican as editorial and business partner to Samuel Bowles, following the death of Bowles' father; Bryan entered the business in 1852 serving as partner in the paper's printing firm Samuel Bowles and Co. Upon Bowles' dissolution of the partnership with himself and several other minor shareholders in his paper's printing business, Bryan went on to rechristen it the Clark W. Bryan & Co., which purchased and expanded the Springfield Union from 1872 to 1882 when it was sold to its editor-in-chief Joseph Shipley. From 1880 until his death Bryan was also responsible for a successful trade publication, The Paper World, which was published in various iterations in Holyoke, Springfield, and finally out of the Pulitzer Building in New York City. By the time the paper had been moved to the latter in 1898, Bryan retained little more than creative input, and this sale to a separate company would ultimately fail. Bryan, who had lived to see his business empire in financial ruin, and wife and one of his sons had passed in recent years, took his life on January 23, 1899 with a pistol. All of his publications were promptly discontinued, the sole exception being Good Housekeeping which immediately found a purchaser, John Pettigrew, who would sell it to his printer George D. Chamberlain, who in turn sold it to E. H. Phelps, another former Springfield Republican associate, whose company Phelps Publishing, had offices in Springfield and New York.

Bell (1888‚Äì1974) of Wrington was one of the first anglers to adopt an imitative approach to fly fishing on reservoirs in the early twentieth century.Advanced Stillwater Flyfishing by Chris Ogbourne, David & Charles (1993) Page 160. At a time when employing flashy ‚Äòattractor‚Äô patterns was the norm he employed the alternative tactic of using artificial flies that represented the shape and form of the creatures present in Blagdon Water where he fished regularly. Conrad Voss Bark, BBC political correspondent and angling historian, had these words to say about him, \\"Dr Bell of Blagdon had the greatest formative influence of any man on the development of reservoir fishing in the first half of this century\\".The New Encyclopaedia of Fly Fishing by Conrad Voss Bark, Robert Hale Ltd (1992) page 31 Howard Alexander Bell was born at Bletchingley, near Reigate, Surrey and studied to become a General Practitioner at Cambridge and St Bartholomew‚Äôs Hospital in London. He was enlisted in the Royal Army Medical Corps and served abroad in Flanders and Palestine in World War I.The Field magazine, Article by J K B Crawford (6 February 1975 issue) page 211 He was a shy, sensitive and reserved individual and the horrors of war affected him deeply. He was one of the few who survived the Battle of Passchendaele (also known as the Third Battle of Ypres) in 1917. The emotional scars of what he had witnessed as he tended the wounded and dying in Flanders were to remain with him for the rest of his life. It could well be that his wartime experiences led to his desire to live in idyllic surroundings and pursue the gentle art of fly fishing with such single-minded dedication.A History of Flyfishing by Conrad Voss Bark, Merlin Unwin Books (paperback edition 1994) page 120 A biography entitled Dr Bell of Wrington: Pioneer of Reservoir Fly Fishing written by Adrian Freer was published in 2019.Dr Bell of Wrington: Pioneer of Reservoir Fly Fishing by Adrian V W Freer, Welford Court Press (2019)222x222px Contribution to reservoir fly fishing Bell was a bank angler and, as far as is recorded, he never fished from a boat. In its formative years Blagdon anglers would normally employ large sea trout or low water salmon flies during the daytime, very often using tandem and multi-hook arrangements; or alternatively lures at night. Dr Bell would use neither, but instead he preferred to fish with his own small imitative patterns.The New Encyclopaedia of Fly Fishing by Conrad Voss Bark, Robert Hale Ltd (1992) Bell made it his practice to spoon all the trout he caught and after examining the contents he made an index of all the food available to the trout. Following on from that he devised imitations of all the creatures present and the local Blagdon anglers quickly followed his exampleThe Flyfishers‚Äô Journal, Article by Alick Newsom (summer 1975 issue) page 112 A fishing friend of Bell‚Äôs, Alick Newsom, described his method of fishing as follows: > He liked to fish alone, always on the move, slowly covering sunken ditches, > holes and weed beds as he sought to locate the trout. > > Bell would always go off on his own, trying to avoid other rods. He had a > pear-shaped landing net slung over his shoulder on a cord. He always fished > from the bank with three unweighted flies on a gut cast, size 1X. He liked > to fish over sunk ditches and holes and weed beds. He moved slowly along the > bank, casting as he went. He cast out as far as was comfortable. He made no > attempt to go for distance but let the flies sink slowly, judging the time > so that the tail fly did not get snagged on the bottom. He used the knot at > the end of his greased silk line as a bite indicator. When the flies were > fully sunk he would gather them in slowly. > > His flies were quite small, 10s, 12s, sometimes 14s. He might have a Worm > Fly on a single hook on the point, a Grenadier on the middle dropper and a > Buzzer on the top.

It was also released as a single in some countries and has appeared on several of the group's compilation albums. It was included occasionally in the group's live set even after John Fogerty left the group and the remaining members reformed as Creedence Clearwater Revisited. Lyrics and music \\"It Came Out of the Sky\\" is a satirical song and one of Creedence Clearwater Revival's first forays into political themes. The lyrics describe what happens when an object, presumably a meteorite or flying saucer, falls on the property of a farmer named Jody in Moline, Illinois. Various politicians and other figures attempt to use the incident for their own purposes. Then United States Vice President Spiro Agnew wants to use the incident to impose a tax on Mars. Then Governor of California Ronald Reagan, called \\"Ronnie the Populist\\" in the song, claims it is part of a communist plot. The pope claims it is evidence that \\"the Lord has come.\\" The movie industry starts preparing an epic film of the incident. Newscasters Walter Cronkite and Eric Sevareid interview Jody. The Vatican and the White House argue over who should keep it. Finally, Jody gets the last word by claiming possession of it and offering it for sale at the exorbitant price of 17 million dollars. Fogerty biographer Thomas Kitts explains that the song \\"draws on Chuck Berry rhythms, guitar licks and crisp storytelling. The Guardian contributor Geoffrey Cannon similarly commented that the \\"hard, exhilarating, self-confident\\" guitar work was inspired by Berry. San Francisco Examiner critic Philip Elwood described the song as \\"a lively rock 'n' roll vehicle combining a wild vocal and absolutely perfectly styled instrumental ensemble.\\" The Dispatch critic Dink Lorance describes the song as \\"an old- style rock and roller.\\" Kitts interprets the song as exposing the \\"self- centeredness and limited vision of politicians, religious leaders, and the media, all of whom exploit events for aggrandizement and self-promotion\\" but they are all outsmarted by a simple Midwestern farmer. He regards the song as being \\"a more humorous, less bitter attack on officials and institutions than we see elsewhere in Fogerty\\" and that it \\"champions the working classes who through efficiency and practicality get things done and are not so simple as the empowered think.\\" Cannon compares the song to the Dillards' \\"The Biggest Whatever\\" in that in both songs an enormous object falls from the sky onto the American countryside. Cannon interprets the large object as \\"a metaphor for an idea, too big to be assimilated into the old ideas just as the world would turn upside down for anyone who saw an ant a foot long.\\" Reception Rolling Stone Magazine critic Alec Dubro praises the song as being \\"as funny as Dylan at his best\\" and for being able to \\"get three worlds of paranoia into one short, entertaining, musical song.\\" Dubro also asserts that the song successfully reconciles Fogerty's insistence that listeners put too much weight on political references in songs with Fogerty's belief that a song can have a message by being \\"message and comment without moralizing.\\" The New Rolling Stone Album Guide critic Rob Sheffield highlighted the \\"sharp working class anger\\" of \\"It Came Out of the Sky\\" in regarding the song as part of \\"Fogerty's songwriting peak.\\" Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine claims that \\"It Came Out of the Sky\\" is one of Creedence Clearwater Revival's best performances. Elwood called it \\"great stuff, supported by pure 8-to-the-bar\\". Village Voice critic Robert Christgau called it a \\"hidden treasure.\\" Nick DeRiso of Ultimate Classic Rock called it \\"a choice deep cut.\\" In early 1970 Tampa Tribune reporter Rory O'Connor felt that it had the potential to be the band's \\"next million seller single\\" and noted that it was receiving significant airplay on local radio. Music journalist Hank Bordowitz praises Fogerty's \\"willingness to take a stand on the issues of the day\\" and for his \\"prescience\\" in being one of the first to criticize Reagan in a song. Creedence Clearwater Revival drummer Doug Clifford claimed that \\"It's a fun song. It's kind of a spoof on everybody.\\" Clifford also stated that he was surprised it did not become more popular. Bassist Stu Cook called it \\"a tough act to follow.\\" \\"It Came Out of the Sky\\" was included on several Creedence Clearwater Revival compilation albums, including Chronicle, Vol. 2 in 1986, Keep On Chooglin' in 1999 and Creedence Clearwater Revival: Box Set in 2001. It was released as a single in the UK backed with \\"Side O the Road\\" and in Spain backed with \\"Cotton Fields.\\" Live versions Creedence Clearwater Revival sometimes played the song live and it appears on the 1973 live album Live in Europe. Commenting on a 1971 concert, Elwood commented that Cook's bass playing on the song was \\"imaginative and forceful.\\" After Fogerty left the group and Clifford and Cook formed Creedence Clearwater Revisited, they continued to occasionally play the song live. According to Cook, the band continues to play the song for themselves at soundchecks, even though much of the audience typically fails to recognize it when they include it in the shows.

The estate was then sold by his heirs to county manager Jacob J√∏rgensen. It than changed hands a number of times until it was acquired by Erik Svitzer in 1771. He implemented the agricultural reforms of the time and expanded the sairy. The main building was destroyed by fire in 1773 and later rebuilt at a new location further to the south.

Description and history Goshen Town Hall is located in the town's main village center on the east side of Main Street (Massachusetts Route 9) at its junction with East Street. It is a two-story masonry building, with a gabled roof. The front facade is dominated by four paired sets of round Tuscan columns, set beneath an entablature. and an eyebrow window in the stone wall behind. The main entrance is in the central bay, accessed by a broad series of steps. The building appears to be only one story in height, because the first floor is actually partially below grade. The interior is arranged with an auditorium on the lower level, and a kitchen, dining room, and the library on the upper level. Prior to construction of this building, Goshen held its town meetings in a variety of places, most recently in a local hotel (no longer standing) across the street from this building. This building was designed by William J. Howes, and completed in 1911. One of the largest donors to its construction was the will of John James, and it was named in his honor. It was the first permanent home for the town library, which had existed in some form since the late 18th century.

He served as the governor of Fars from 846‚Äì7 until his death.  Career  A member of the Mus'abid family, Muhammad was the brother of Ishaq ibn Ibrahim, the long-running chief of security (shurtah) of Baghdad, and first cousin to Abdallah ibn Tahir, the Tahirid governor of Khurasan.; . He participated in the caliph al-Mu'tasim's Amorium campaign of 838, during which he commanded the troops following the vanguard, and was shortly after responsible for putting to death Ujayf ibn Anbasah, who had participated in a failed conspiracy to assassinate the caliph. In the following year he led the caliphal troops that participated alongside Abdallah ibn Tahir's campaign against the rebel prince Mazyar in Tabaristan, and he fought a successful battle against Mazyar's lieutenant al-Durri, who he captured and executed.; ; ; . In 846 Muhammad was serving as proxy for his brother Ishaq in Baghdad when the attempted rebellion of Ahmad ibn Nasr al-Khuza'i took place. Having received word of suspicious activity in the city, he sent an agent to investigate and quickly learned of the planned revolt. Over the next several days his men rounded up Ahmad and other members of the plot, who were then transported to the caliph al-Wathiq for questioning. In 846‚Äì7 Muhammad was appointed as governor of Fars, and he retained that position until 850, when the caliphal heir al-Mu'tazz assigned the province to his nephew Muhammad ibn Ishaq ibn Ibrahim. After Muhammad expressed hostility to Muhammad ibn Ishaq, the latter lodged a complaint with the caliph al-Mutawakkil and deposed his uncle as governor, replacing him with al-Husayn ibn Isma'il al-Mus'abi.

It is owned by the Lakeville Journal Company.  History  For much of the late 19th and early 20th century the only paper in Millerton was the Telegram. The Telegram, started by Cooley James in 1876, quickly fell to Millerton local Colvin Card, who ran it until his illness and death in 1908. From 1908 to 1927 it was run by W. L. Loope, then sold to Guy S. Bailey, who consolidated it with the Harlem Valley Times of Amenia, leaving Millerton without a separate newspaper. In 1932, Peter Haworth, a former reporter for the New York Sun, founded the Millerton News. Acting as both editor and publisher, he ran the paper until he sold it to John Hage in January, 1947. He died the subsequent year. In 1972, the owner of The Lakeville Journal, a weekly in neighboring Lakeville, Connecticut, bought The Millerton News. Since that point, the paper has been run out of the Lakeville offices, with many of the stories shared between both papers. In 1995, the paper (along with sister publication the Journal) was put up for sale by then-owner Robert Hatch. Fearing purchase by non-local investors, a group of local investors looking to retain news coverage in Millerton came together to purchase it. Later that year, the paper's operations were covered in The New Yorker in a piece called \\"Her Town\\", which detailed the one-woman reporting operation of News reporter Heather Heaton. The piece, written by award-winning writer Susan Orlean, was subsequently included as a chapter in her collection The Bullfighter Checks Her Makeup: My Encounters With Extraordinary People. Writing in the Atlanta Journal- Constitution, Emilia Sandoval noted the essay on the News as one of the \\"gems\\" of the collection. The paper remains locally owned by the Lakeville Journal Company.

He was three times acting lieutenant- general of the French Antilles. Family Charles de Pechpeyrou-Comminges, chevalier de Guitaut, was the son of Louis de Pechpeyrou-Comminges, seigneur de Guitaut and of Jeanne d'Eygua, daughter of Bertrand d'Eygua, seigneur de Castel-Arnaud. His parents married on 7 September 1625 and had five children: Guillaume; Charles, a soldier who died in the civil wars; a second Charles, the subject of this article; a third Charles; and Bertrand, abb√© de Saint- Michel de Pessan. His oldest brother, Guillaume de Pechpeyrou-Comminges, comte de Guitaut(fr) (1626‚Äì1685), had a prominent military career during and after the Fronde rebellion. Career Guitaut became a knight of the Order of Malta, commander of Pali√®res, governor of Ch√¢tillon-sur-Seine and grand-bailli of Auxois(fr). He then served in the navy. He was local governor of Martinique from 1687 to 1689, replacing Jacques de Chambly. =Governor of Saint Christopher (1689‚Äì70)= From 1668 to 1688 the French and English colonists on Saint Christopher Island (Saint Kitts) had been at peace. However, when war broke out between the two countries in 1688 the governor general of the Antilles, Charles de Courbon de Bl√©nac, decided that to ensure the safety of the French on the island he must expel the English. He came to Saint Christopher at the start of 1689 with naval troops, local forces from Martinique and Guadeloupe and buccaneers, who joined the local militia. He attacked the English energetically and drove them back to Fort Charles, which he besieged and took, then transported the English to Jamaica, Barbados and other islands. In July 1689 the king made Guitaut governor of Saint Christopher Island and gave him the position of lieutenant general to the government of the American islands, which had been vacated by the death of Claude de Roux de Saint-Laurent. On 16 June 1689 Louis XIV made Nicolas de Gabaret, governor of Grenada, the governor of Martinique in place of Guitant. At the start of 1690 the English attempted to take Saint Martin. Blenac had ordered Guitaut to move the inhabitants to Saint Christopher, but he took several companies of militia and naval troops to Saint Martin, where he defeated the English before returning to Saint Christopher. The English returned with a large fleet carrying strong forces from Europe and the militias of their local islands, and attacked Saint Christopher in August 1690, landing at the Salines point without opposition. Guitaut had to retire to the trenches that protected the petite Saline and those round the town of Basseterre. After the sieur de Guarigue was wounded the defenders became demoralized. He and Guitaut retreated to Fort Charles where they were soon besieged by the English. They were unable to silence the battery of la Souphri√®re, which overlooked the whole fort. After a month and a half Guitaut was obliged to capitulate and cede the island to the English. =Lieutenant- g√©n√©ral au governement (1690‚Äì1702)= As lieutenant to the governor general, until his death in 1702 Guitant was acting governor-general four times between the death of the incumbent and arrival of his replacement. Bl√©nac left Martinique on 29 January 1690 and returned to France to defend himself at court. By July the British had reconquered Saint Kitts and Sint Eustatius. Bl√©nac's successor Fran√ßois d'Alesso, Marquis d'√âragny arrived on 5 February 1691 with 14 warships, strengthened the defenses and in May relieved the French defenders of Fort Saint-Charles in Guadeloupe, who had been besieged by the English. The marquis d'Eragny, died on 18 August 1690. Commandeur Guitaud was interim lieutenant general and commander in chief from 18 August 1691. Charles de Courbon de Bl√©nac was again named lieutenant general on 1 November 1691 and was received in Martinique on 5 February 1692. He died on 10 June 1696. Guitaud was again made interim lieutenant governor on 10 June 1696. Thomas-Claude Renart de Fuchsamberg, marquis d'Amblimont was named governor and lieutenant general on 1 September 1696 and received in Martinique on 14 March 1697. He died of yellow fever in Martinique on 17 August 1700. Guitaud was made interim lieutenant general for the third time on 17 August 1700. The comte Charles Desnotz (or des Nots, d'Esnots) was named governor and lieutenant general on 1 January 1701 and was received in Martinique on 23 May 1701. He died of yellow fever in Martinique on 6 October 1701 and Guitaud was made interim lieutenant general for the fourth time. On 4 January 1702 Marc- Hyacinthe, marquis de Rosmadec was named to replace Desnotz, but he died on his ship in Havana before taking office. On 1 July 1702 Charles-Fran√ßois de Machault de Bellemont was named governor and lieutenant general. On 4 September 1702 Guitant and the intendant Robert issued ordinances defining compensation for wounds to whites and slaves in the war that had just started with England. Only those laborers and other whites who had nothing to lose would be compensated. Depending on the merit of their action, a slave could even be given their liberty. Guitaud died in Martinique on 7 September 1702, two months after the start of hostilities in the War of the Spanish Succession. He was a Knight Commander of the Order of Malta. He was replaced by Nicolas de Gabaret, Governor of Grenada, as interim governor general pending the arrival of Machault. Machault was received in Martinique on 4 March 1703. Gabaret was given Guitaut's position of lieutenant au gouvernement g√©n√©ral under Machault.

It was a core tactic of the American Revolution and has played a role in many struggles in America from colonial times to the present day. In addition, the philosophy of tax resistance, from the \\"no taxation without representation\\" axiom that served as a foundation of the Revolution to the assertion of individual conscience in Henry David Thoreau's Civil Disobedience, has been an important plank of American political philosophy.  Theory  The theory that there should be \\"no taxation without representation,\\" while it did not originate in America, is often associated with the American Revolution, in which that slogan did strong duty. It continues to be a rallying cry for tax rebellions today. American Henry David Thoreau's theory of civil disobedience has proven to be extremely influential, and its influence today is not limited to tax resistance stands and campaigns but to all manner of refusal to obey unjust laws. These are among the theories of tax resistance that have taken on a particularly American flavor and have animated and inspired American tax resisters and tax resistance campaigns. = No taxation without representation = In English political philosophy of the late 18th century, the theory was prominent that in order for the sovereign to exact a tax on a population, that population must be represented in a legislature that had the sole power to levy the tax. That theory was made axiomatic in the form of the slogan \\"no taxation without representation\\" (and similar expressions). As the American colonies did not have representation in the British parliament, this axiom became a useful platform for colonial rebels to justify their rebellion against direct taxes imposed by the Crown. The standard-issue District of Columbia license plate bears the phrase, \\"Taxation Without Representation\\". The \\"no taxation without representation\\" slogan was later brought to bear in the arguments for tax resistance by African-Americans and women, as they did not have the right to vote or serve in the legislature. It is used today by the District of Columbia as part of a complaint that residents of the district have no (voting) Congressional representatives. The phrase has such potent currency in American thought that it is frequently used today in the context of tax debates that have little to do with legislative representation, at least in the way that the original coiners of the phrase would have understood: For example, complaints that Congressional representatives only represent certain special interests, or that the complainer doesn't feel that his or her point of view is represented in legislative debates or actions.e.g. = Civil disobedience = Henry David Thoreau's 1849 essay On Resistance to Civil Government ‚Äî now usually referred to as Civil Disobedience ‚Äî is part of the canon of American political philosophy. It was prompted by Thoreau's refusal to pay a poll tax because of unwillingness to support a government that was enforcing the slavery of Americans and what he felt was an unjust war against Mexico. Thoreau argued that obedience to government is often misplaced, and that people should develop and trust their own consciences rather than use the law as a crutch. Thoreau's philosophy has inspired many tax resisters since, especially those who have acted individually (not as part of a tax strike or other large-scale movement) and from motives of conscientious objection. = Conscientious objection to military taxation = The theory that taxpayers become complicit in the actions of their government when they pay for the government's functioning and requisitions through their taxes, and that therefore one must scrutinize the actions of the government and refuse to pay for them if they become grossly immoral, is key to the war tax resistance practiced by American Quakers since colonial times. It also forms an important philosophical basis for other religious and secular American war tax resisters down to the present day. War tax resisters in the United States pioneered the idea that conscientious objection to military taxation ought to be a legally protected right: that is, taxpayers who are morally opposed to taking part in war should not be forced to fund war, just as governments often permit such people to avoid military conscription. This theory has been extended by people who oppose other aspects of government funding. A few have refused to pay taxes on the grounds that some government health spending goes to institutions that provide abortions. * A number of Amish people refused to pay taxes for government social insurance programs on conscientious grounds.(see below) = Taxation as theft = A demonstrator at a \\"Tax Day\\" demonstration in Cincinnati, Ohio, holds a sign reading \\"taxation is theft\\" The theory that taxation is ethically indistinguishable from robbery is a staple of American anarchist and (often) libertarian thought. American anarchist philosopher Lysander Spooner put it this way: The original U.S. Libertarian Party platform (1972) agreed that taxation was always a violation of the rights of the individual: :Since we believe that every man is entitled to keep the fruits of his labor, we are opposed to all government activity which consists of the forcible collection of money or goods from citizens in violation of their individual rights. Specifically, we support the eventual repeal of all taxation. We support a system of voluntary fees for services rendered as a method for financing government in a free society. adopted unanimously by the delegates to the first national convention of the Libertarian Party = Tax protester theories = An enduring mythology of tax protester arguments asserts that the tax system operating in the United States is unconstitutional, illegal, or doesn't actually apply to most of the people currently being subjected to it. These arguments, though they often take the form of \\"totally discredited legal positions and/or meritless factual positions,\\"United States v. Rempel, 87 A.F.T.R.2d (RIA) 1810 (D. Ark. 2001) are often persuasive to people who have an unsophisticated understanding of the legal system and who are susceptible to look uncritically on arguments that appeal to their financial self-interest. For example, in the early 1980s, an epidemic of tax protest swept General Motors plants in Flint, Michigan, as thousands of employees there told to stop withholding income tax from their salaries after they attended seminars or listened to lectures on tape from the tax protester group \\"We The People ACT.\\"  Practice  The following sections briefly describe some of the more prominent examples of tax resistance in colonial America and the United States: = Quaker conscientious objection to military taxation = The Society of Friends (Quakers) had a tradition of refusing to pay tithes to the establishment church, and of refusing to pay explicit war taxes, from the early years of the establishment of the sect. When Quakers were permitted to establish an American colony, Pennsylvania, that they could run to some extent on their religious principles, the Pennsylvania Assembly often offered some resistance to attempts by the crown to exact money from the colony for the purposes of military defense. During the French and Indian war, the Pennsylvania colonial assembly conceded, and began raising a tax from Pennsylvania residents for military fortifications. This led to some, including influential Quakers John Woolman and Anthony Benezet, refusing to pay such taxes for reasons of conscientious objection. This stand, and the eloquence the resisters employed to explain it, proved influential, and a Quaker tradition of war tax resistance has waxed and waned through American history to the present day. = Colonial resistance = A typical American colonial government was headed by a governor, who was appointed by the Crown and meant to represent the interests of the home country, and a colonial assembly, elected by the colonists themselves. The two not infrequently came into conflict over issues of taxation, and when the governor assumed the right to tax colonists without the consent of their legislature, this conflict might result in tax resistance. This happened for example in 1687 when New England governor Edmund Andros attempted to assess a new tax. Colonists declared their unwillingness to pay such a tax, were imprisoned on orders of the governor, and this ultimately led to the 1689 Boston revolt in which Andros was overthrown. This muscle-flexing by American colonists was an important precursor of the American Revolution, such that Ipswich, where a declaration defying the tax was signed, bills itself as \\"The Birthplace of American Independence 1687\\". The War of the Regulation in colonial North Carolina was another important precursor of the American Revolution. Colonists, fed up with what they viewed as a corrupt and unrepresentative colonial government, stopped paying taxes and ultimately rose in an armed revolt. In this case it was the entire government ‚Äî the governor, the assembly, and the corrupt bureaucracy ‚Äî that was the target of the rebellion.Virginia Gazette (various issues starting 4 August 1768) Independence-minded colonials used a variety of tactics to increase the economic independence and self-reliance of the colonies while denying economic resources to the Crown. This included rampant smuggling and attacks on British customs ships (as in the Gaspee Affair), the refusal to allow British monopoly products to be brought to market (as in the Boston Tea Party and Philadelphia Tea Party), boycotts of British-manufactured goods and the encouragement of local production of replacement goods, and sanctions ranging from social boycott to violent attacks aimed at tax collectors and collaborators. The success of measures like these led John Adams to assert that the American Revolution had already been accomplished before the Revolutionary War began ‚Äî that the war was less a revolution than a failed counterrevolution.\\"What do we mean by the Revolution? The war? That was no part of the revolution; it was only an effect and consequence of it. The revolution was in the minds of the people, and this was effected from 1760‚Äì1775, in the course of fifteen years, before a drop of blood was shed at Lexington.\\" = Resistance in the post- revolutionary period = After the success of the American Revolution, the independent United States government of the former colonies was confronted by its own tax resistance campaigns. Three were suppressed militarily by the fledgling United States government:  Shays' Rebellion  Massachusetts farmers were motivated in part by increased taxes and heavy-handed tax enforcement when they rose up in Shays' Rebellion. They took action against government agencies that were enforcing tax seizures, preventing their operation, until the suppression of the rebellion.Szatmary (1980) op. cit. pp.43, 56  The Whiskey Rebellion  Farmers far from coastal ports and population centers would often ferment and distill their grain into whiskey locally because it was more economic to bring whiskey to market than grain, from the point of view of transportation costs. Thus, when United States government put an excise tax on whiskey, this was seen as an imposition by coastal elites at the expense of rural farmers and was widely resented and resisted. While resistance in the form of refusal to pay the excise tax or to cooperate in the enforcement of excise laws persisted and largely succeeded in some areas, in Western Pennsylvania this resistance erupted into attacks on tax collectors and eventual armed revolt ‚Äî the Whiskey Rebellion ‚Äî which was violently suppressed by federal government troops under the command of former revolutionary war commander in chief George Washington.  Fries's Rebellion  Fries's Rebellion began in opposition to a federal window-tax instituted by the Adams administration, with resisters impeding the tax assessors and refusing to pay the assessed taxes. This resistance movement, too, was successfully suppressed by the federal government when it rose to the level of armed rebellion. = Native / immigrant conflicts = The United States government is largely run by and on behalf of the European immigrant community, while United States territory also encompasses the land of native people, some of whom live in separate sovereign or semi-sovereign nations. Conflicts periodically erupt over who could tax whom. In the late-19th century, such conflicts led to tax resistance, for example from thousands of people of part-native ancestry in Dakota territory who forced the tax collector to retreat without his prize, from Crow in Montana who refused to pay for several years until the government there confiscated their livestock, or from non-native residents of Oklahoma Territory who wanted to be free from Cherokee Nation taxes. Such conflicts continued into the 20th century. For example, Wallace \\"Mad Bear\\" Anderson led a tax resistance campaign of the Tuscarora Nation in 1959 in which they refused to pay state income tax, publicly destroyed tax summonses, and engaged in sit-ins and other such protests. Members of the Seneca Nation blocked the Southern Tier Expressway in New York to protest the state's attempt to extend a state sales tax to them in 1992. When members of the Iroquois Confederacy blocked roads in a similar conflict in 1997, law enforcement responded with brutal violence (the state would eventually pay out $2.7million to victims). * = African-Americans = Tax resistance has occasionally been deployed in the battle for civil rights for black people in the United States. For example: The \\"no taxation without representation\\" argument was evoked by African-American businessman Paul Cuffee, who refused to pay his state taxes and petitioned the legislature in 1780 and 1781 on behalf of himself and other African-Americans, saying \\"we apprehend ourselves to be aggrieved, in that... we are not allowed the privilege of freemen of the State, having no vote or influence in the election of those that tax us.\\" Robert Purvis refused to pay a school tax in Philadelphia in 1853, on the grounds that his children were not allowed to attend the whites-only schools the tax supported. \\"I object\\", he wrote, \\"to the payment of this tax, on the ground that my rights as a citizen, and my feelings as a man and a parent have been grossly outraged in depriving me, in violation of law and justice, of the benefits of the school system which this tax was designed to sustain.\\" = Undermining Reconstruction state governments = After the American Civil War, the United States government established Reconstruction era governments in the states of the former Confederacy that included black and carpetbagger representatives. The loss of political power by the formerly dominant white supremacists led to resentment, protest, and the formation of paramilitaries and parallel governments. Occasionally, tax resistance was used as a tactic to withdraw financial support and political legitimacy from the reconstruction governments in favor of the white supremacist parallel governments. For example, tax resistance was used as a tactic by South Carolina Democrats in the months leading up to the collapse of the carpetbagger administration of Republican Daniel Chamberlain and his replacement by former Confederate Army officer Wade Hampton III. White supremacist gubernatorial candidate John McEnery established a parallel government in Reconstruction Louisiana, in opposition to the carpetbagger government of governor William Pitt Kellogg, and urged sympathetic citizens to pay taxes to his government rather than the Kellogg \\"usurpation.\\"e.g. = Railroad bond shenanigans = In the 1870s a number of American localities were victims of railroad bond swindles. Promoters would ask the residents to vote to issue bonds to pay for the running of a railroad line to their area, these bonds being backed by the local tax base. In theory the economic growth that would come from the new rail line would more than pay for the bonds by the time they were mature and the bondholders needed to be paid off. In fact, the railroad never materialized and the bond promoters vanished with the money. Some of these localities organized and refused to honor the bonds they had issued. Because by the time the bonds had matured they had likely been sold to new owners who did not participate in the original fraud, the court system was not usually very sympathetic to the defrauded taxpayers. But this led to some notable examples of organized tax resistance in the United States. For instance, in Cass and Clair counties, Missouri, local judges were elected who refused to enforce higher court rulings in favor of the bondholders that would have forced the County to inflict a tax in order to pay off the bonds. For a time, the judges held court in a cave in order to evade their eventual jailings for contempt of court.  In Steuben County, New York, the bondholders succeeded in forcing the community to create a property tax to pay off the bonds, but property owners refused to pay the tax and rallied to the support of those whose property was seized for failure to pay, successfully disrupting tax auctions. In Kentucky, refusal to assess or pay taxes to pay off the bond swindle persisted for decades. Some towns refused to elect sheriffs or public officials of any kind (or no candidates could be found for the positions) so that nobody was legally qualified to assess taxes or engage in property seizures for failure to pay taxes. Local judges went into hiding to evade the rulings of higher courts. Armed citizens intimidated outsiders who tried to come and collect taxes by force.  * = Women's suffrage = Tax resistance was a less important part of the women's suffrage struggle in the United States than it was in the United Kingdom, but it still played a role and had some notable practitioners. At the 1852 National Women's Rights Convention, Susan B. Anthony brought forward a tax resistance resolution: : Resolved, That it is the duty of the women of those States, in which woman has now by law a right to the property she inherits, to refuse to pay taxes. She is unrepresented in the Government... Lucy Stone refused to pay her tax in 1858, on the grounds \\"that women suffer taxation, and yet have no representation, which is not only unjust to one-half the adult population, but is contrary to our theory of government.\\"Gross, David (2008) op. cit. pp.328‚Äì29 Abby and Julia Smith were landowners in Glastonbury, Connecticut, who found in the 1870s that their property tax assessments kept rising relative to those of the male property owners of the area who could vote in local elections. They responded by refusing to pay taxes on \\"no taxation without representation\\" grounds, and their battle soon became a among suffrage activists and sympathizers throughout the country (in part thanks to the sisters' knack for publicity).Gross, David (2008) op. cit. pp.333‚Äì42 Anna Howard Shaw's automobile was sold at tax auction in 1915 in a celebrated tax resistance case. \\"Dr. Shaw has always believed in the contention of the Colonies that 'taxation without representation is tyranny' and has consistently protested along this line when paying her taxes,\\" she explained.  Tax resistance by newly-enfranchised women in Pennsylvania  As women won the right to vote in the United States, they sometimes also became vulnerable to taxes that had previously only applied to men. When this happened in Pennsylvania, the shock was accompanied by resentment that the school tax in question applied mostly to women living in rural areas and not to those living in the largest Pennsylvania cities. This example of American tax resistance is particularly interesting because although it involved thousands of women in many parts of the state and persisted for several years, there is little evidence that the resistance was formally organized, and it wasn't accompanied by much in the way of open protest ‚Äî no rallies, picket marches, petitions, manifestos, named organizations, political coalitions, or things of that nature. It seems to have been a form of leaderless resistance.. Gross notes media references at the time that add up to over 4,000 women from Pottstown, Darby, Charleroi, Haverford, Media, Clifton Heights, and Freeland. At first the women were emboldened by a quirk in the law that forbade \\"the arrest or imprisonment for non-payment of any tax of any female or infant or person found by inquisition to be of unsound mind.\\" It took the state legislature a couple of years to update that law after the women's tax resistance began, and several women were eventually jailed, briefly, for their resistance.e.g. = \\"Bond Slackers\\" during World War I = Although the government raised some of its war budget via taxes, the most visible public war funding measure during World WarI was the Liberty Bond program. Citizens were encouraged to loan money to the government for its war effort through the purchase of bonds. Although the purchase of bonds was ostensibly voluntary, strong coercive pressure ‚Äî up to and including mob violence ‚Äî was directed at those who would not buy. \\"Bond slackers\\" (the popular term at the time for people who did not buy war bonds, or did not buy them in sufficient quantity) could be run out of town, * might lose their jobs, * have their property stolen or vandalized,  might be tarred-and-feathered, * otherwise tortured, * coated in paint, threatened with murder, * or subjected to hours of questioning by hooded interrogators in impromptu star chambers in the hopes of prompting them to say something that would incriminate them under the Espionage Act. Those who resisted such pressure and refused to buy war bonds included conscientious objectors to war such as Jehovah's Witnesses\\"Didn't Buy Bonds, Gets Yellow Coat\\" op. cit and members of traditional peace churches such as Mennonites,  * anti-capitalist radicals,\\"Held for Preaching Against Liberty Loan\\" op. cit. and European immigrants from countries the and its allies were fighting. Herbert Lord, Director of Finance for the War Department, considered this \\"an organized effort to discourage and defeat the loan,\\" and it was attributed to a conspiracy of \\"pro-German agents.\\" = Property tax strikes during the Great Depression = The Great Depression introduced unprecedented tax burdens to Americans. While real-estate values plummeted and unemployment skyrocketed, the cost of government remained high. As a result, taxes as a percentage of the national income nearly doubled from 11.6 percent in 1929 to 21.1 in 1932. Most of the increase took place at the local level and especially squeezed the resources of real estate taxpayers. Local tax delinquency rose steadily to a record of 26.3% in 1933. Many Americans reacted to these conditions by forming taxpayers' leagues to call for lower taxes and cuts in government spending. By some estimates, there were three thousand of these leagues by 1933. Taxpayers' leagues endorsed such measures as laws to limit and rollback taxes, lowered penalties on tax delinquents, and cuts in government spending. Partly as a result of their efforts, sixteen states and numerous localities adopted property tax limitations while three states instituted homestead exemptions.Beito (1989) op. cit. pp.15‚Äì16 While taxpayers' leagues usually favored traditional legal and political strategies, a few promoted tax resistance. Probably the best known of these was the Association of Real Estate Taxpayers () in Chicago. From 1930 to 1933, it led one of the largest tax strikes in American history. functioned primarily as a cooperative legal service. Each member paid annual dues of $15 to fund lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of real-estate assessments. The suits, when finally filed, took the form of a 7,000-page, two-foot-thick book listing the names and tax data for all 26,000 co-litigants.Gross, David M. (2014) op. cit pp.24, 125 The radical side of the movement became apparent by early 1931 when called for taxpayers to withhold real-estate taxes (or \\"strike\\") pending a final ruling by the Illinois Supreme Court, and later the U.S. Supreme Court. Mayor Anton Cermak and other politicians desperately tried to break the strike by threatening criminal prosecution, revocation of city services, and the seizure of property. * The Association's influence peaked in late 1932, with a membership of near 30,000 people, a budget of over $600,000, and its own radio show. A failed legal suit, government counter-measures, and infighting took their toll and the movement, having in large part accomplished its goals, declined thereafter.Beito, David T. \\"John M. Pratt: Depression Era Tax Striker\\" History News Network 23 March 2008 * = The emergence of a non- sectarian war tax resistance movement = Tax resistance motivated by conscientious objection to war had traditionally been practiced in the United States under the Christian theory of nonresistance as extrapolated by the historic peace churches, and its development had largely taken place within the context of those churches. Rare exceptions included the brief flowering of tax resistance among the New England Transcendentalists like Henry David Thoreau, a small war tax resistance contingent in the late-19th Century pacifist movement, and a few war tax resisters in small sects like the International Bible Students and Rogerenes. After World WarII, a non-sectarian war tax resistance movement began to come together, and would develop its own practices of war tax resistance under a more secular theory of pacifism. Some of the figures in this early movement were members of the historic peace churches, such as Mary Stone McDowell, a Quaker who had resisted the Liberty Bond drives during World WarI, but many others were not. Dorothy Day and Ammon Hennacy were from the Catholic Worker movement, Ernest Bromley was a Methodist, Walter Gormly and Maurice McCrackin Presbyterians, Juanita and Wally Nelson non-religious, for example. In 1948, the group Peacemakers formed to (loosely) organize this movement.Gross, David (2008) op. cit. pp.446‚Äì447 This group would develop a pacifist theory of conscientious objection to military taxation that was not tied to a particular religious doctrine. They published a guide to war tax resistance in 1963 and developed tactics of resistance practice and of publicity that would lead to the growth of the movement, to a new resurgence of war tax resistance among the traditional peace churches, and to the establishment of nonsectarian war tax resistance as an ongoing part of the American scene. = Foes of social security taxation = The United States Social Security program had its share of critics and faced political opposition. It also evoked some tax resistance against the payroll and self-employment taxes that funded it. This came from two factions in particular: conservatives who opposed the government program for ideological reasons, and Amish who had religious prohibitions against participating in insurance programs in general.  Conservative opposition  American conservatives who refused to pay payroll or self-employment taxes for the social security program expressed their opposition in terms of opposing government overreach into private lives and contracts, and opposition to socialism. \\"For those of us who still have confidence in our own ability,\\" one wrote, \\"such a socialistic thing should not be forced upon us.\\" About a dozen women from around Marshall, Texas organized in 1951 to refuse to submit Social Security taxes on behalf of their domestic help. \\"It's not the money, it's the principle,\\" said spokesperson Carolyn M. Abney. \\"That law is unconstitutional.\\" The \\"Texas Housewives\\" (as they were invariably called in the newspapers) lost a court case in 1952. They appealed on 13th Amendment grounds; that's the amendment that bans involuntary servitude ‚Äî their attorney explained that the law \\"forces these housewives to be unpaid tax collectors for the government.\\" They lost this case as well, and in 1954 they failed in an attempted Supreme Court appeal. Meanwhile, the government seized the resisted money from their bank accounts. The women continued to defy the Internal Revenue Service () for some time after, claiming that the courts had not answered the Constitutional question but had only verified the tax statute. They eventually gave up the fight and began to pay the required quarterly taxes for their employees. Mary Cain refused to pay $42.87 in self- employment tax in 1952 and hid her assets to make sure the government would have to make it a criminal matter (and thus a possible test case) rather than a simple civil asset seizure. In the case that eventually resulted, Cain's arguments were turned down by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and she had no luck with a Supreme Court appeal, but the government eventually dropped the case anyway. When the government padlocked the office of her newspaper as part of a seizure process, Cain sawed the lock off the door and mailed it to the defiantly. \\"I've had enough of the New Deal. I'm sick of the whole Truman administration,\\" she said. Vivien Kellems, who had previously tangled with the government by refusing to withhold income taxes from her employees, refused to pay the self-employment tax on her income in 1952, and recruited a small group of other businesspersons (including Mary Cain) to join her protest. She wrote in a letter to Treasury Secretary John W. Snyder that she felt she already had \\"adequate insurance\\" and she urged the government to indict her so that she could be a test case to the Supreme Court.  Conscientious objection from the Amish  The Amish have a strong tradition of mutual aid and believe that purchasing insurance betrays distrust in God's providence * see also: and in the community of believers. The original name of the Social Security system was \\"Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance,\\" and Amish people interpreted it as a forbidden form of insurance. Because of this, when the U.S. government extended the Social Security system to cover farmers in 1955, many Amish refused to participate, and the government responded by seizing their property. After some farmers had bank accounts seized, others closed their accounts. When the government tried to levy checks due to the resisters from the milk processing cooperatives they sold their milk to, the cooperatives (also in Amish hands) refused to hand over the checks. The government was then reduced to seizing livestock. In a celebrated case in 1961, the government seized Valentine Byler's horses during Spring plowing. Asked about this insensitivity to Byler's livelihood, the district Chief of Collections answered, \\"Plowing never occurred to me. I live in an apartment.\\" Byler received messages of support from around the country, and the press took up his cause. The struggle would continue for a decade. Legislation that would exempt the Amish from the Social Security program was introduced in Congress at least as early as 1959, and some of the resisters took the unusual step (unusual for the Amish) of petitioning the government in 1961. In 1965, the United States changed the Social Security law in a way that exempted self- employed Amish people from having to pay into the Social Security program. = War tax resistance during the Vietnam War = The American war against Vietnam led to strong opposition in the United States. Inspired by the use of civil disobedience in the civil rights movement and by an earlier generation of conscientious objectors to war tax payment, a new generation of resisters created a version of war tax resistance that was more oriented toward protest than conscientious objection. In 1966, A.J. Muste circulated a tax refusal pledge meant as an advertisement for the Washington Post that 370 people signed, including the singer Joan Baez, on the grounds \\"that the ordinary channels of protest have been exhausted.\\" In 1967, President Lyndon Johnson proposed an income tax surtax explicitly to pay for war expenses. This was the first tax in the modern United States that was explicitly a \\"war tax\\" and helped to boost the prominence of war tax resistance as a protest tactic. In early 1967, a \\"No Tax for War Committee\\" organized by Maurice McCrackin circulated a sign-on statement that eventually attracted more than 200 signatures, and that read: :Because so much of the tax paid the federal government goes for poisoning of food crops, blasting of villages, napalming and killing thousands upon thousands of people, as in Vietnam at the present time, I am not going to pay taxes on 1966 income.Included in A \\"Writers & Editors War Tax Protest\\" the same year was somewhat less bold in its declaration (not all declaring total resistance, but some refusing to pay only the 10% surtax or only 23% of their total tax) but more impressive in its list of names. The protest, which appeared in New York Post, New York Times Book Review and Ramparts was eventually signed by about 528 people including Nelson Algren, James Baldwin, Robert Bly, Noam Chomsky, Robert Creeley, David Dellinger, Philip K. Dick, Robert Duncan, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Leslie Fiedler, Betty Friedan, Allen Ginsberg, Todd Gitlin, Paul Goodman, Edward S. Herman, Paul Krassner, Staughton Lynd, Dwight Macdonald, Jackson Mac Low, Norman Mailer, Peter Matthiessen, Milton Mayer, Ed McClanahan, Henry Miller, Carl Oglesby, Tillie Olsen, Grace Paley, Thomas Pynchon, Adrienne Rich, Kirkpatrick Sale, Ed Sanders, Robert Scheer, Peter Dale Scott, Susan Sontag, Terry Southern, Benjamin Spock, Gloria Steinem, William Styron, Norman Thomas, Hunter S. Thompson, Lew Welch, John Wieners, Kurt Vonnegut and Howard Zinn. * The ad included a quotation from Thoreau's Civil Disobedience that ends: (The Washington Post refused to print the ad \\"on the grounds that it was an implicit exhortation to violate the law\\", and the New York Times too, on the grounds that \\"we do not accept advertising urging readers to perform an illegal action\\" but thanks to the Streisand effect the word got out even better that way.) In addition, by this time thousands of Americans were refusing to pay the federal telephone excise tax on their phone service. In 1970, five Harvard and nine faculty members, including Nobel laureates Salvador E. Luria and George Wald, announced that they would be resisting taxes in protest of the war. In 1972, Jane Hart, wife of Senator Philip Hart, said that she would be resisting the federal income tax. By this time, every major center had a staff member assigned to be the \\"Viet Nam Protest Coordinator.\\" = American tax resistance in the 21st Century = Tax resistance continues to be a background theme in American political discussion, and occasionally tax resistance campaigns break out in the United States. The National War Tax Resistance Coordinating Committee, today's successor of organizations like Peacemakers and the Committee for Nonviolent Revolution, organizes conscientious objectors to military taxation and anti- war protesters who use tax resistance as a tactic. The \\"Don't Buy Bush's War\\" campaign in 2007‚Äì08, organized by Code Pink to protest the War against Iraq, got 2,000 people to sign a tax resistance pledge. * Gross, David M. (2014) op. cit. p.66 The Tea Party protests of 2009 were in part a protest against high taxes (in addition to the allusion to the Boston Tea Party, the name was supposed to stand for \\"Taxed Enough Already\\"). Code Pink even reached out across the ideological aisle to try to find some common ground. * Tax resistance is used in smaller-scale struggles as well. When 23 county officials in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania were charged with corruption, and the county nonetheless decided to raise taxes by 10%, residents rebelled. One, Fred Heller, recorded a song in 2010 ‚Äî \\"Take This Tax and Shove It\\" ‚Äî to try to rally people to refuse to pay. When a smoking ban in Lansing, Michigan cut into their business, several taverns there launched a tax strike in 2011. When the Seattle, Washington, City Council introduced a city income tax in 2017, the state Republican Party did not wait for the tax to be ruled unconstitutional, but immediately called for \\"nothing less than civil disobedience ‚Äî that is, refusal to comply, file, or pay.\\"\\"WSRP Responds to Seattle City Council Vote on Income Tax\\" Washington State Republican Party press release 10 July 2017  Notes  Tax resistance Taxation in the United States History of taxation History of the United States American tax resisters Protests in the United States ","title":"Tax resistance in the United States"},{"id":"58389274","text":"Alfred Fischer (born 16 February 1960) is a Swiss rower.

History Global regulators decided to move away from the London interbank offered rate (Libor) -- a vital part of the financial system given that it‚Äôs linked to around $300 trillion of loans, derivatives and other instruments across various currencies -- after it was revealed in 2012 that banks around the world manipulated it. It also didn‚Äôt help that volumes underlying the benchmark dried up. U.K. regulators set the deadline at 2021 for financial firms and investors to transition away from the Libor. In June 2017, US Federal Reserve Bank's Alternative Reference Rates Committee selected what's called the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR as the preferred alternative to Libor. The committee has noted the stability of the repurchase market on which the rate is based. The New York Federal Reserve began publication of the rate in April 2018. In August 2018, Barclays became the first bank to issue commercial paper tied to the rate; selling some US $525 million of short-term debt. Previously, Fannie Mae issued $6 billion securities tied to SOFR in July of 2018. Again in October 2018, Fannie Mae issued a second $ 5 billion securities that was also similarly tied to SOFR. Nonetheless, weaning off the scandal-plagued Libor benchmark is a gigantic problem for global rates markets, one that increasingly looks too burdensome for a single replacement to handle in the U.S. In July 2019, the SEC and the President of the New York Federal Reserve John Williams called on banks to swiftly transition from Libor to its replacements, such as SOFR, instead of waiting until the 2021 deadline. If a smooth transition from Libor cannot take place, smaller banks may reduce lending and companies may be less capable of hedging interest rate risks. Technical features SOFR is based on the Treasury repurchase market (repo), Treasuries loaned or borrowed overnight. SOFR uses data from overnight Treasury repo activity to calculate a rate published at approximately 8:00 a.m. New York time on the next business day by the US Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Unlike Libor, SOFR uses banks' actual borrowing costs rather than unverifiable estimates submitted by a panel of banks. However, it may still be vulnerable to manipulation. Banks can borrow and lend at biased rates in the wholesale funding market, which can lead them to profit in the much larger market for benchmark-indexed contracts. It was therefore suggested that the lending costs of individual banks be published to increase transparency and deter manipulation. The Bank for International Settlements, which serves as the bank for central banks, said in March that a one-size-fits-all alternative may be neither feasible nor desirable. Although SOFR solves the rigging problem, it doesn‚Äôt help participants gauge how stressed global funding markets are. That means SOFR is likely to coexist with something else.

The propositions, on diverse subjects and organized indiscriminately, are drawn mainly from the statutes (constitutiones) of the Emperor Diocletian (especially those of the years 293‚Äì4 in the Codex Hermogenianus), but also from the Pauli Sententiae and the statutes of Constantine the Great and Leo the Thracian.

She lived and worked in Palestine from October 1887 to October 1893 along with both of her sisters and fellow missionaries, Frances E. Newton and Constance A. Newton. Edith Eleanor Newton's work primarily involved religious missionary work along with education to both adults and children in Palestine. She is known to have been responsible for the running and maintenance of several schools, hospitals and, missions throughout her career. Prior to her work in Palestine, Newton was heavily involved in volunteer work in Jaffna, Sri Lanka. Edith Eleanor Newton had been consistently heralded as being an invaluable asset to the Jaffa Mission during her time in Palestine and has been honored for her work and contributions there. She was one of the very few and first women to have volunteered their services towards the Jaffa Mission during that time period.  Family and Personal Life  Edith Eleanor Newton was the daughter of Anne Rosamond and Charles E. Newton. Newton was baptised on 31 January 1860. Her family lived at The Manor in Mickleover, Derbyshire in the United Kingdom and was known to have numerous servants, tutors and groundsmen. Her father, Charles E. Newton was the Justice of the Peace to the county and borough of Derby, a banker and a prominent farmer with many employees and laborers. He also remarried a Maltese woman Mary Henrietta Moore, of which little is known. Newton had several siblings including Rosamond C. Newton, Mary L. Newton, Frances E. Newton, Margaret E. Newton, Constance A. Newton and, Francis C. Newton. Both of her sisters, Frances E. Newton and Constance A. Newton served in Palestine as religious missionaries alongside Edith. Frances is known for her roles in activism and politics in Palestine during her time there. Constance was known for being the director of the Jaffa Mission Hospital. Up until age 27, Edith worked as a voluntary helper in Jaffna, Sri Lanka before being accepted to become a religious missionary in Palestine where she would later join her sister Constance. Frances joined them later on in 1895.  Missionary Work  Edith Eleanor Newton was among the first few people to respond to the call made by Rev. John Robert Longley Hall for approximately ten missionaries to go to Palestine in light of the ecclesiastical difficulties in Palestine at that time. John Robert Longley Hall was a Chaplain and was invited to England when the Archbishop of Canterbury assigned him the duty of finding missionaries to help with the situation in Palestine. Newton, together with two other women on record, Eliza Armstrong and Annie S. H. Vidal were the first to respond to this appeal made by Hall. Newton was accepted as an Honorary Missionary of the Church Missionary Society (CMS) on 4 October 1887 and went to Jaffa on 20 October 1887 to begin her mission. While there, she was the Sister Head of the Medical Mission Hospital. Over the time period of 1887 to 1893, Newton traveled back and forth between England and Palestine very frequently. Her regular travel was due to visiting her sister, Constance who had contracted an illness that proved to be fatal and had to leave her missionary work in Jaffa and return to England. The Jaffa Mission Hospital was owned and operated by Mildmay Missions, an organisation which worked in conjunction with the Church Missionary Society (CMS). Constance together with another missionary, Miss Mangan were responsible for running the facility with the help of a Syrian physician Dr. Keith Ghoreyeb. After Miss Mangan's death in 1885, the hospital was rebuilt into a functional medical facility. In 1892, Mildmay Missions bequeathed the Jaffa Mission Hospital to Constance Newton and Edith Eleanor Newton for full ownership and operation. After Constance became ill, the hospital was run by Edith and Dr. Ghoreyeb. Following her death on 19 August 1908, Constance left behind an endowment of ¬£10,000 for the running of the hospital. At the Jaffa Mission Hospital, aside from its medical practices, every day half-hour services were held in both the men's and women's wards for inpatients. During these services, the patients were allowed to participate in gospel singing as well as scripture readings. In addition to this, every day before the patients see the doctor, they also have a short gospel service. Edith was responsible for coordinating these events as well as conducting her own Women's Service every Thursday afternoon. One of the most prominent issues faced by the hospital at the time was infant mortality. Edith's service was specifically tailored to the mothers' rehabilitation and spiritual enlightenment. Newton frequently sang to the women, engaged in prayer, carried them to her garden and showed them lantern slides. Edith was not only involved in the capacity of being a missionary but was also involved in donating various resources to the hospital over the years leading to its overall development and improvement. In addition to the Jaffa Mission Hospital, there was also an outpatient clinic at Lod (previously Lydd) which was operated by the Church Missionary Society (CMS). During war activities, part of the building was destroyed by fire but was rebuilt to accommodate the needs of the patients. In order for work to be carried out efficiently at this site, two persons were required to be there each day to carry out duties in between doctor's visits however, just train rides and walking were very time consuming. As such, Edith donated a Ford car to transport individuals between the hospital in Jaffa and outpatient clinic in Lod. The car served to transport the local reverend back and forth as well as an ambulance to transport critically ill patients. In some cases, the car would be used to visit surrounding villages to find and treat persons who were ill.  Edith's Letters  During her time as a missionary in Palestine, Newton would frequently write letters and literary pieces to the Church Missionary Society's range of publications including the Church Missionary Gleaner, Church Missionary Intelligencer, Mercy and Truth and, The CMS Home Gazette. These publications served to give readers in the outside world insight as to what was going on politically, economically, religiously and medically in countries other than their own which CMS sent to be missionaries. These publications served as a medium through which missionaries could relay their thoughts and experiences to the mass public of their journeys and their purpose being there. Newton's earliest letters began as soon as she arrived in Palestine and detailed her life in concise paragraphs almost on a monthly basis. The contents of these letters basically conveyed what was going on in her life at the current time as well as challenges such as sickness, community adjustment, struggles in learning Arabic together with a snapshot of what her role was at the time. As far as her literary work is concerned, she published an article titled, \\"A Story of a Russian Pilgrim.\\"This article takes the form of a story which Newton recalls from her own experience. It essentially involves a Russian woman brought in to be treated at the Jaffa Mission Hospital and was not able to communicate with anyone as their languages differed. Newton further goes on to say that the woman, after her medical procedure, would often engage with other members of the hospital in singing hymns and the only word which she learned was 'Hallelujah'. According to Newton, singing and praying made the Russian woman feel great joy and happiness in a place where she knew no one, could not communicate effectively and was being treated medically.

He also helped direct the Brooklyn YMCA, and was a professor at Florida Southern College. Due to his role as trainer for the Yankee organization he was credited with \\"modernizing training methods for professional athletes\\". Early life Erle Painter was born in Iowa in 1881 to parents John Albert Painter and Ella May (n√©e) Humphrey. He attended Springfield College in Massachusetts, and later the New York School of Chiropractic (not related to the present-day New York Chiropractic College) where he graduated in 1920. Career In 1917, as director of the Brooklyn YMCA, Painter was mustered into the army and given the rank of chief master in arms in order to help train soldiers in the first naval hospital unit. As chief master in arms Painter drilled the students in hospital-related activities such as the creation of improvised litters (or rescue baskets), and the loading of wagons for transportation of wounded soldiers. Upon the conclusion of the year long course, Painter was mustered back out of the army. =New York Yankees= Painter began working as the Yankees trainer in 1930, replacing the previous doctor Albert A. Woods. In 13 years with the Yankees, Painter would treat many prominent players such as Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, and Joe DiMaggio‚Äîwhose foot he accidentally burned at the beginning of the 1936 season with a diathermy machine. He was described as \\"one of the most valuable men on the Yankee pay roll\\" and was credited with helping many players recover back to performance shape. In 1942, Painter was dismissed without explanation from the position as trainer by manager Joe McCarthy. While no reason was given to Painter for his dismissal, some headlines debated if he was blamed for losing the 1942 World Series. Many years following his dismissal, surrounding the debate of Babe Ruth's called shot, Painter shared his version of the story with the Baseball Hall of Fame stating, \\"Ruth made a three- quarter turn to the stands and held up one finger. It was plain he was signifying one strike didn't mean he was out. Root put over another strike and the Babe repeated the pantomime, holding up two fingers this time.

The estate covers approximately 1,700 hectares and comprises Rangle M√∏lle and Holmstrup. The current main building was built in Gothic Revival style in 1933 after the old one had been destroyed in a fire. History =1730‚Äì1820: Early history= D√∏nnerup was originally a village first mentioned as Dindethorp in 1199. It consisted of 12 farms and a couple of houses without land in 1688. Supreme Court justice Peder Benzon was granted royal permission to close the village and convert the land into a new manor under the name Benzonslund. Benzon died in 1735. His heirs were initially unable to find a buyer for the estate but in 1737 it was finally sold to Henrik von Eickstedt, a 22-year-old nobleman who would later become known as one of the leaders in the revolt against Johann Friedrich Struensee. Poul Christian von Stemann purchased Benzonslund in 1791. He achieved a successful career at the royal court, which would later culminate with his appointment to president of Danish Chancellery in 1827. He sold Benzonslund tp Johannes Meldahl in 11800. He sold it to Cecilius Andreas Ulrik Rosen√∏rn in 1806. Rosen√∏rn had four children while he lived on the estate, including later Cultus Minister Ernst Emil Rosen√∏rn. =1820‚Äì1925: Zytphen- Adeler family= Georg Frederik Otto von Zytphen-Adeler Benzonszlund was sold after Rosen√∏rn's early death in 1820. The new owner was Bertha Adeler, the widow of Frederik, Baron Adeler, whose ambition it was to restore the Barony of Adelersborg (now Dragsholm Castle). Georg Frederik Otto von Zytphen, who was married to Bertha Adeler's grand daughter, was ennobled under the name Zytphen-Adeler in 1838. He managed the Benzonszlund estate from 1839 and became its owner in 1843. Zytphen-Adeler introduced many improvements in the management of the estate. In 1867. he was granted royal permission to rename it D√∏nnerup after the former village. =1925‚Äìpresent: Later history= The barony was dissolved in 1925 and D√∏nnerup was at the same time sold to Aage Hastrup. The main building was destroyed in a fire but a new one was constructed in 1932-33. Members of the Hastrup family owned the estate until 1994. Architecture D√∏nnerup is built in Gothic Revival style. It consists of a main wing with crow-stepped gables flanked by two detached side wings. All three buildings are white-washed with red tile roofs and have crow-stepped gables. Today D√∏nnerup is owned and operated by D√∏nnerup A/. The estate covers 1276 hectares of land (2011) of which 173 hectares are farmland, 219 are hectares are pastures and 809 hectares are woodland.

She was not highly regarded as a two- year-old in 1995 but won both of her races at long odds including the Listed Radley Stakes. In the following spring she was placed in both the Fred Darling Stakes and the Musidora Stakes before recording a 30/1 upset victory in the Prix de Diane. She was unplaced on her only subsequent start and retired from racing at the end of the year. She had no success as a broodmare. Background Sil Sila was a bay mare bred in Ireland by her owner Luis √Ålvarez de Cervera's breeding company L A C International. As a foal in November 1993 she was offered for sale at Goffs but failed to make her modest reserve price of IR¬£9,500. During her racing career she carried the colours of √Ålvarez de Cervera's Turquoise Trading. The filly was sent into training with Bryan Smart at Lambourn in Berkshire. Smart recalled \\"She was a sweet filly... but she had an offset knee and could be lazy at home. If you were a gallop watcher you certainly wouldn't have picked her out as a future classic winner. However there was something about her that made her special\\". She was sired by the Irish stallion Marju who finished second in The Derby and won the St James's Palace Stakes in 1991. Marju sired several other major winners including Satono Crown, Soviet Song, My Emma, Viva Pataca and Indigenous. Sil Sila's dam Porto Alegre was an unraced mare, the best of whose other offspring was the Group-placed winner Frequent Flyer. Racing career =1995: two- year-old season= Sil Sila made her racecourse debut in a maiden race over seven furlongs on good to soft ground at Warwick Racecourse on 3 October in which she was ridden by the apprentice jockey Seb Sanders. Starting a 50/1 outsider, she belied her odds, as she tracked the leaders before taking the lead inside the final furlong and winning by one and a quarter lengths from Hilaala. The full-time professional Ray Cochrane took the ride when the filly was stepped up in class for the Listed Radley Stakes at Newbury Racecourse eighteen days later but she was given little chance and started at odds of 25/1 against eight opponents. After being restrained in the early stages she went to the front approaching the final furlong and drew away to win by three and a half lengths. =1996: three-year-old season= On her first run of 1996 Sil Sila contested the Listed Masaka Stakes over one mile at Kempton Park Racecourse on 6 April and sustained her first defeat as she came home seventh of the thirteen runners behind Sea Spray. Two weeks later, in the Fred Darling Stakes (a major trial race for the 1000 Guineas) at Newbury she proved nomatch for Bosra Sham and was beaten eight lengths into third place. She was then stepped up in trip to ten and a half furlongs at York Racecourse on 14 May for the Musidora Stakes, a race which often serves as a trial for the Epsom Oaks. Racing on good to firm ground she started the 12/1 outsider in a five-runner field but stayed on well in the closing stages and finished second to Magnificient Style. On 9 June Sil Sila was sent to France for the Prix de Diane over 2100 metres at Chantilly Racecourse in which she was ridden by the American jockey Cash Asmussen and started a 30/1 outsider in a twelve-runner field. The Prix Saint-Alary winner Luna Wells went off favourite, while the other runners included Matiya, Khalisa (Prix Cl√©op√¢tre), Miss Tahiti (Prix Marcel Boussac) and Solar Crystal (May Hill Stakes). After racing towards the rear of the field, Sil Sila was hampered when she attempted to make a forward move in the straight and was switched left to deliver her challenge on the outside. She took the lead in the last 100 metres and won by a length from Miss Tahiti, with a gap of two and a half lengths back to Matiya in third. On the day after Sil Sila's victory Bryan Smart reported \\"We've had a lot of faxes with offers for her. I've had her since she was a two-year-old and have ridden her in all her work. It would be a wrench to see her go, but then business is business. Still, they can't take away what I have done with her... It's fabulous to win a race like this. I'm a small trainer with a good filly\\". After a two-month break, Sil Sila returned in the Yorkshire Oaks over one and a half miles in August. She started at 9/2, the shortest odds of her career, but began to struggle in the straight and was eased down by Cochrane to come home last of the nine runners behind Key Change. Post-race tests revealed an abnormal white blood cell count: Smart commented \\"Sil Sila has a mild infection and things have probably been worsened by the journey up to York and all the hurly burly\\". In December 1996 Sil Sila was put up for auction at Tattersalls but failed to reach her reserve price. Breeding record Sil Sila was retired from racing to become a broodmare for her owner's stud. She produced at least nine foals between 1998 and 2013, none of whom showed any racing ability: *La-Sayida, a bay filly, foaled in 1998, sired by Fairy King.

It has also appeared on several of the group's live and compilation albums. It was covered by the Minutemen on their 1984 album Double Nickels on the Dime. Lyrics and music \\"Don't Look Now (It Ain't You or Me)\\" follows \\"Fortunate Son\\" on Willy and the Poor Boys and it follows up the latter's political theme of class disparities. \\"Don't Look Now (It Ain't You or Me)\\" supports common laborers at the expense of rock stars and hippies. It critiques the fact that hippies get to enjoy their idealism and their music, but while they are having fun and ignoring responsibilities the less fortunate have to do the hard work such as farming, mining and making clothing. It is structured as a series of questions, such as \\"Who will work the field with his hands?\\" \\"Who takes the coal from the mines?\\" \\"Who takes the salt from the earth?\\" and \\"Who will keep the promises that you don't have to keep?\\" It answers the questions by stating, \\"Don't look now, it ain't you or me\\". In a manner reminiscent of Bob Dylan's \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\", the first two questions in each verse are practical ones, such as the ones about working the field or mining for coal or salt, while the third and last question of each verse is more metaphysical, such as the one about keeping promises. Fogerty stated that while like many in his generation he was concerned about what was happening in America at the time, he was also concerned about issues with his hippie generation itself. Fogerty stated: > We're all so ethnic now, with our long hair and shit. But, when it comes to > doing the real crap that civilization needs to keep it going ... who's going > to be the garbage collector? None of us will. Most of us will say, \\"That's > beneath me, I ain't gonna do that job\\". Fogerty also stated that \\"It was a challenge really to take a look at yourself. Most of us refuse to get involved with the dirty work of humanity\\". Creedence Clearwater Revival drummer Doug Clifford later explained: > That's a song that will slap you right in the face...It's a sobering tune, > if you listen to the lyrics. It's a period of time when everyone was > pointing the finger at our generation saying \\"This isn't right, this isn't > right\\". But how many people were really going to do something about it?

Stu has a nice little > lick in there. Stu was really an underrated bass player. Village Voice critic Robert Christgau wrote that the song \\"manages to encapsulate the class system in two minutes and eight seconds.\\" \\"Don't Look Now (It Ain't You or Me)\\" has a rockabilly melody. Band biographer Craig Hansen Werner calls it \\"a country-tinged variation on the straight ahead rock and roll of 'Fortunate Son.'\\" Fogerty biographer Thomas Kitts describes the song as having an \\"echoey vocal, straightforward backbeat, simple bass line and acoustic guitar\\" which come together to give it the sound of pre-World War II country music, which Kitts finds consistent with the song's \\"support of traditional values\\". Werner points out that in contrast to the hard rocking \\"Fortunate Son,\\" when Fogerty sings the crucial lines of \\"Don't Look Now\\"‚ÄîDon't look now, someone's done your starvin'/Don't look now, someone's done your prayin' too‚Äîhe does so quietly, virtually in a whisper. Reception Rolling Stone critic Alec Dubro credits \\"Don't Look Now\\" for attempting to deal with its difficult issue and for displaying a broader vision than that of most rock lyricists. Timothy Gray stated that, like \\"Fortunate Son,\\" this song rocks so hard you hardly notice the bald political rhetoric. AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine calls it \\"a great rockabilly spiritual\\" and \\"an album favorite.\\" The New Rolling Stone Album Guide critic Rob Sheffield highlighted the \\"sharp working class anger\\" of \\"It Came Out of the Sky\\" in regarding the song as part of \\"Fogerty's songwriting peak.\\" In an earlier edition of that book, reviewer Paul Evans stated that \\"'Fortunate Son' and 'Don't Look Now (It Ain't You or Me)' was the most convincing political rock & roll before the Clash.\\" Village Voice critic Robert Christgau called it a \\"hidden treasure.\\" \\"Don't Look Now (It Ain't You or Me)\\" was included on several Creedence Clearwater Revival compilation albums, including Chronicle, Vol. 2 in 1986, Keep On Chooglin' in 1999 and Creedence Clearwater Revival: Box Set in 2001. It was also included on the 1980 live album The Concert. Minutemen version Punk band Minutemen covered \\"Don't Look Now\\" on their 1984 album Double Nickels on the Dime. It is the only song on the album that was not recorded at Radio Tokyo. Although a studio version was recorded, the band decided to accept a suggestion by Joe Carducci to include on the album a live version recorded on a cassette tape at Club Lingerie in Hollywood. Although the recording is imperfect, the fact that audience members can be heard talking during the song enhances the message of the song. The song asks who is going to take care of providing necessities such as food, clothing and shelter. If the audience is gossiping during the song, apparently it will not be them who takes care of it, which throws the question to the listener of the album whether he or she is even paying attention, let alone willing to take responsibility.

He spent most of his career in the Luxembourg National Division, with over 200 appearances and 100 goals between four teams. During his time at Jeunesse Esch and F91 Dudelange, he won four each of the league title and Luxembourg Cup. He was the Luxembourgish Footballer of the Year in 2013‚Äì14 and the league's top scorer three times. Career Born in Tuzla, then in the SFR Yugoslavia, Ibrahimoviƒá was in the youth system of FK Sloboda Tuzla from the age of 6, until at 16 his family moved to Luxembourg. He returned to the Balkans and became a futsal professional in Croatia before returning to Luxembourg in 2008, settling with his family in Wiltz, a northern city with a large Bosnian community. His first club was FC Wiltz 71 of the second-tier Luxembourg Division of Honour. As a non-European Union citizen, he required a work permit as a specialist to play for the team. The club president, former Luxembourg international Henri Roemer, hired him as a purported specialist in Bosnian cuisine for his hotel ‚Äì though he had no actual expertise in this field. The team gained promotion, and he was top scorer in the 2010‚Äì11 Luxembourg National Division with 18 goals in 24 games. However, the club were relegated and he missed a penalty in their play-off against US Hostert. Ibrahimoviƒá had been tracked by a scout from nearby French club FC Metz, but the game he attended saw Wiltz lose 15‚Äì0 to F91 Dudelange, and he joined FC RM Hamm Benfica in 2011 for a club record ‚Ç¨35,000, and Jeunesse Esch a year later. In the final of the 2012‚Äì13 Luxembourg Cup, he scored twice in a 2‚Äì1 win over FC Differdange 03 at the Stade Josy Barthel. In 2013‚Äì14, he was again top scorer with 22 goals in 26 games, in addition to Luxembourgish Footballer of the Year. With only one goal fewer the following season, he was top scorer for the third time. In June 2015, after his Jeunesse contract expired, Ibrahimoviƒá moved to F91 Dudelange on a three-year deal. Ibrahimoviƒá was close to returning to Wiltz in January 2019, but stayed at F91 and won the league and cup double. In June that year, he joined Wiltz on a three-year contract.

Tyrrell. They initially planned to construct a three-story office building at 432 S. Boulder Avenue, topped by a ten-story hotel. The Great Depression intervened in the following year, when the two oilmen were financially ruined. They stopped construction at the third floor. In 1931, they sold it to the Knights of Pythias, who decided to complete it as an office building and renamed it the Pythian Building. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on January 21, 1982 (NRIS #82003703). The application lists its architecture as a mix of the Art Deco styles: Modern and Zig Zag.\\"Gillette-Tyrell Building.\\" Landmark Hunter. Undated. Accessed September 3, 2018. It is also listed as a contributing property on the NRHP Application for the Oil Capital Historic District (NRIS #10001013). Exterior description The building is located on the northeast corner of West 5th Street and South Boulder Avenue, with entrances on both streets, connected inside by an L-shaped lobby. Each entrance originally was covered with a lighted projecting canopy. The Boulder Avenue canopy is made of steel, constructed with a lace-like design. The 5th street canopy was steel clad in terra cotta. The exterior has seven east-west and five north-south bays. The facade is divided by thin vertical piers that run from its base to the top of the parapet, and are decorated with back-to-back diamond patterns (zig-zags), a theme throughout the building. Spandrels are highlighted with blue terra cotta accents. The areas between the piers are covered with a thin layer of cream-colored terra cotta. The roofline is colored with blue, burnt sienna and green terra cotta. Openings between the piers at the ground-floor level have a Tudor arch design, filled with glass framed with steel in a bundled-reed design. Interior description The lobby floor is tiled and repeats the zig-zag design pattern of the exterior. The tiling extends up the walls to reach a high perimeter wainscot. The east end of the lobby contains a staircase that leads to a second floor balcony. Beneath the staircase are two elevators that lead to the second and third floors. Interior windows of the second-floor offices look out over the lobby. Another lobby access leads to the building basement. The ceiling that extends across the lobby from the balcony appears to be covered with a large skylight. Instead it is a large lighting fixture whose glass lens is designed to resemble a folded plate. It was considered an extremely novel design at the time. Eight tall slender chandeliers, each with four etched glass panels which terminate in a triangle design top and bottom, also are installed in the ceiling to provide additional light. Empire Chandelier Manufacturing Company of Sand Springs designed and fabricated these. Current status In 2012, then-owner Kanbar Properties, a California investment firm, put the building up for sale at a sealed bid auction. Minimum bid was announced as $1.4 million, and bids were due July 10, 2012. The bid announcement said that the building was then 69 percent occupied. Kanbar had bought this building in 2005, along with several other Tulsa properties at the same time.Evatt, Robert. \\"Pythian Building in downtown Tulsa up for sale.\\" Tulsa World. May 30, 2012. Accessed September 4, 2018. Results of the 2012 were not publicly announced at the time. But, in 2017, a Tulsa newspaper article indicated that developer W.

The Gillette-Tyrell building was one of the 13 properties that was included in the package. The article suggests that since 2012, Price had bought full ownership of the 18 properties Kanbar once owned in the city. The value of individual buildings were not disclosed.

While with National Life, he worked in side jobs with the Grand Ole Opry including selling tickets and souvenirs between 1939 and 1946.Cunnifff 1986a pp. 43-47 In 1946, Denny began working at WSM as the head of the Artists Service Bureau. While holding his head position at WSM, Denny became the general manager of the Opry in 1951 and partnered with Webb Pierce to create the Cedarwood Publishing Company in 1954. A few years later, Denny left the Artists Service Bureau in 1956 after conflict of interest issues were raised by the WSM. After leaving WSM, Denny created the Jim Denny Artist Bureau in 1956 while continuing working at Cedarwood. Denny hired multiple songwriters to write for Cedarwood including Marijohn Wilkin and Carl Perkins while signing a publishing contract with Buddy Holly during the mid 1950s. Denny ended his music executive career in December 1962 after he was diagonsed with colon cancer. Awards and honors In 1955, Denny was named the 1955 Billboard Country and Western Man of the Year. Denny became the first non- musician to be named into the Country Music Hall of Fame after his posthumous induction in 1966. Personal life Denny was married and had three kids. Death Denny died at Saint Thomas - West Hospital in Nashville from cancer on 27 August 1963.

She served as superintendent of literature in the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). Colman, through many years of her life, was closely in touch with the National Temperance Society, for which she provided service. She contributed to the Society's educational and missionary sides by writing for its periodicals and for tract, pamphlet and book literature. Along these lines she made prominent the instruction of children and youth as well as adults in the principles of total abstinence and prohibition. She thoroughly believed in education as the great means of reaching success. Colman also prepared several series of leaflets for the WCTU. Among these might be mentioned the Union Leaflets, reaching 114 in number; the Gospel Handbills, reaching 67 numbers; and the Beer Series, reaching 57 numbers. She prepared over 450 leaflets and tracts that were issued by the National Temperance Society. Her most important work and the largest was entitled, The Temperance Handbook for Speakers and Workers, a volume of 178 pages. Her Alcohol and Hygiene for Schools had a large sale for many years, and her Juvenile Temperance Manual for Teachers was in demand. Colman devoted the larger portion of her time to this work of pushing and circulating educational literature. Early years and education Julia Colman was born in Northampton, Fulton County, New York, in the valley of the Great Sacandaga Lake, February 16, 1828. She was of Puritan and Huguenot ancestry. The Colman family from England settled in Wethersfield, Connecticut, in 1634. About the year 1800, her grandfather's family moved \\"away out west\\" to Northampton, Montgomery County (now Fulton County), New York. Her mother, Livia Spier, was of Welsh ancestry, who came to Boston eight generations previously. Her father, Rev. Henry R. Colman, was a clergyman of the Methodist Episcopal Church. She had four brothers. In 1840, the family removed to Wisconsin, her father being sent as missionary to the Oneida people near Green Bay, Wisconsin. By 1847, they were at Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. From girlhood she was a devout evangelical Christian, a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Here, in her juvenile efforts to communicate with Oneida children of the forest, Colman laid the foundation of that simplicity and directness of style for which her writings were noted, and which constituted the success of her extended literary productions. There were no schools in that region which she could attend, but the lack was supplied by careful home teaching. Before 1849, she commenced teaching in Calumet and Fond du Lac counties, \\"living in the parlor\\" ‚Äîas boarding around from family to family was there termed‚Äî and industriously continuing her own studies as she could. During this period she commenced the study of botany, analyzing and classifying over 300 specimens before having the aid of any teacher. This was a rare achievement, strikingly indicating, and at the same time training her into those habits of careful research which later proved so useful in other departments. In 1849, when Lawrence University, in Appleton, opened its doors for students, Colman was in the first classes. She remained there for nearly two years, and then spent two years at Cazenovia Seminary, New York, under Rev. Dr. Bannister, graduating in 1853, with the first class in the collegiate or five years' course. Her specialties were the languages and moral science, with unusual aptitude in physiology and chemistry. Career =Teacher and editor= After a year or two longer in teaching, she deliberately chose literary pursuits, accepting a position in the editorial office of the Methodist Sunday School Union and Tract Society, of the Methodist Publishing House, in New York City, where she remained over thirteen years, as librarian and assistant to Drs. Kidder, Wise, and Vincent, making acquaintance with editorial, publishing, and benevolent society work, which was of great value to her in her later positions. During a portion of this time, she assisted in editing the Sunday-School Advocate, which then had a circulation of nearly 400,000, and where her articles, signed \\"Aunt Julia,\\" attracted much attention. =Anti-tobacco activist= Here she commenced a crusade against tobacco by inducing the boys to form local \\"Anti-Tobacco Leagues,\\" to learn about tobacco, and to work against it, especially by distributing anti-tobacco literature. She provided them with a manual and other requisites, and over 100 such leagues were formed in different parts of the country. They were ephemeral, as boys' societies necessarily were, but they aimed in the right direction, and doubtless did something towards the anti-tobacco movement. It was, at all events, a foreshadowing of future work. =Continued study= Translations from the French and German of articles for the National Magazine and letters for the Christian Advocate, the preparation of a number of small books for children on natural history, anti-slavery, and temperance, were among the literary labors of that period. While benevolent efforts in the large Sunday-school of Greene Street Church, where for five years she was lady superintendent, constituted her outside work. These constant and pressing demands, however, finally proved too much for her health, and she relinquished a portion of them for a series of studies in medicine and physiology. Through these she found her way into restored health, which continued almost unbroken for an extended period of time. She was also led in this way into an acquaintance with the medical and scientific aspects of the temperance question. Always an abstainer, she then saw how she could work for total abstinence successfully, and she began in 1868 to write and lecture on the subject. She took partial courses in different medical colleges, that she might learn their teachings about alcohol and obtain a sound physiological basis for further studies. She spoke before local temperance societies, teachers' institutes and Methodist conferences, delivering upward of 100 lectures previous to the crusade. Other engagements prevented her from taking an active part in the uprising, but in 1875, she entered the local work and originated the first \\"temperance school.\\" That marked a new departure in the temperance work among the children, in that it was largely intellectual, the scholars being arranged in classes, reciting to teachers and reviewed by a superintendent, aided throughout by the systematized use of text-books, tracts, charts and experiments. Those educational methods commended themselves to the National WCTU, and Colman was elected editor of one page of the national organ for one year, to push that elementary work, which soon became the prevailing model throughout the woman's work and in other temperance organizations. Previous to this, Colman, like most others, was largely unmoved by the needs of temperance. She saw and deplored intemperance, but, like those around her, she could see no effective method of checking it. The question had never come to her practically, either to her or to others she associated with, but now, in the course of these later studies, she saw a way of addressing temperance. She immediately began to study and write on the question, and, not finding sufficient access to the public through press sourced available to her, she prepared a lecture on \\"Alcohol our Enemy,\\" which, after a good deal waiting, she was permitted to deliver. It was in March, 1868, before a crowded house in the church of which she was then a member, in the presence and with the assistance of her pastor and other influential friends, the lecture was given, and was subsequently repeated many times in other places. Finding her time and interest engrossed in this topic of temperance and in the kindred subject of food and diet, she, in the autumn of 1867, severed her long connection with the Methodist Publishing House, where, however pleasant it might be, there was little chance (being a woman) of advancement. She then gave two courses of lectures on \\"Food\\" in the Dixon Institute, Brooklyn, New York, wrote a long series of articles on that subject for The Ladies' Repository, and still more for the Rural New Yorker, for Home and Health, Science of Health, Good Health, and other periodicals, besides temperance articles for the National Temperance Society, and for the Youth's Temperance Visitor in Maine. Through the latter, she was led incidentally to a long series of engagements to lecture in that State on temperance. This gave her the much-desired opportunity of studying the temperance problem upon that states, and learning the conditions which led to its advancement and success there. During the winter and spring of 1870 and 1871, she filled nearly 100 engagements, speaking sometimes before Methodist conferences and sometimes before teachers' institutes, where she advocated temperance teaching in the day school, sounding the first notes on that topic. She also prepared a series of sketches of the State WCTU presidents, published in Demorest's Magazine. She finally concluded, however, that she could reach a greater number by the pen, if exclusively devoted to this subject, and thus more effectively promote a cause in which her interest was becoming more and more engrossed. She wished also to take a course of lectures in medicine, which she preferred to do at different colleges, that she might learn the various ideas about the uses of alcohol in medicine. She gave especial attention during this period of study to the chemical course. This broken method did not favor her taking a diploma, which, however, was offered her. But she declined the honor, as she did not propose to practice, and did not care to flourish a medical title. She also paid much attention to the chemistry and preparation of food, making investigations in several health institutions, and subsequently published no less than 75 consecutive articles on this subject in the Monthly Science of Health and Phrenological Journal. =Temperance reform= It was while carrying out some of these engagements, so that she could not give her personal attention to the cause, that the temperance crusade swept over the United States. In 1875, Colin was appointed superintendent of literature in the WCTU, which position she held for fifteen years. During that time, she wrote or edited and published upward of 500 books, tracts, pamphlets and lesson leaves. Among the books and pamphlets she wrote are: \\"The Catechisms on Alcohol and Tobacco\\" (1872), which reached a circulation of 300,000; \\"The Juvenile Temperance Manual for Teachers\\"; \\"The Primary Temperance Catechism\\"; \\"The Catechism on Beer\\"; \\"The Sunday School Temperance Catechism;\\" \\"The Temperance School\\"; \\"The Temperance Hand-Book for Speakers and Workers\\"; \\"An Evening with Robinson Crusoe,\\" and smaller pamphlets, tracts and leaflets for juveniles and adults. She edited during that time The Young People's Comrade and The Temperance Teacher. But when, in the summer of 1875, she retired to an inland country town for needed rest, taking with her for preparation the \\"Twenty Tracts on Temperance.\\" Engaging actively in the new temperance work, which helped to start in that town a local Temperance union, and became Superintendent of the first so-called \\"Temperance School\\". For this, she wrote the \\"Catechism on Alcohol,\\" which she had written and published three years before, and worked out the method afterwards developed in her \\"Lessons from Nature,\\" published in Our Union in 1877, and more fully in the Juvenile Temperance Manual. Accounts of this school in the papers and elsewhere attracted attention, and at the National Convention of the WCTU, in Newark, New Jersey, in 1876, Colman was elected to edit one page of Our Union for the children, preparing lessons explanatory of the catechism. She was also made Chairman of a \\"Leaflet Committee\\", which was the starting point of the extended literature work, of which she served as Superintendent. Her work in this department aimed to devise effective measures for the distribution of temperance literature, favoring special topics to harmonize with other lines of work, and more particularly the accurate knowledge of the nature and effects of intoxicants as indispensable to getting rid of them. This was to be followed with tract after tract, and then courses of readings on each topic, as \\"Readings on Beer,\\" already issued. These were designed for the local unions, to be accompanied by the distribution of the tracts and hand-bills, one kind at a time. These would lead to the study of books which would become a part of a loan and reference library, and which could be made available and effective by the efforts of the members of the unions. Colman aimed not so much to produce new publications as to utilize the best of what was published. What was lacking she supplied, as in the Union Leaflets (71), especially adapted to the various needs of the woman's work; the Beer Series of Handbills (57); the Gospel Series (30), and so forth. Still later, she wrote \\"Alcohol and Hygiene,\\" a school textbook, intended to precede Richardson's Temperance Lesson Book in the grade schools. This was well received. She also commenced a series of \\"Leaflets for Young People,\\" suited for distribution with others in schools and colleges. In a similar manner, she classified a great variety of the best tracts, handbills, and leaflets into sets, according to their character, so that it was easy to procure specimens of tracts for definite uses. Her directions were so simple and clear that the work of tract distribution was effective. She adapted a variety of tracts, leaflets, and hymn cards, making a complete system of requisites. She issued many chromo cards with temperance mottoes for birthday, holidays, Easter, Valentine's Day, and everyday use. She also suggested and planned the dime collection system to supply the wants of her department. This plan was adopted by the National Convention at Boston in 1880. But it did not provide for her personal expenses, which she supplied mostly by her contributions to the press outside of her department labors, or by editorial work like that she bestowed upon the Young People's Comrade. Catechism on Alcohol and Tobacco, published in 1885, was printed in several foreign languages, and the National Temperance Society sold over 300,000 copies of it. The Youth's Temperance Banner and The Water Lily, monthly periodicals issued by the National Temperance Society for use in Sunday schools, were at times edited by her. The Beauties of Temperance was one of the books prepared by Colman, but published by Eaton & Mains. In 1891, she ended her position as superintendent of the Department of Temperance Literature, but continued as superintendent of the Health Department, at the National WCTU, with her office in the Bible House, New York City. An effective testing apparatus, capable of showing a variety of helpful chemical experiments, was put together by her. With its aid, she delivered courses of illustrated lectures in Silver Spring, Maryland, Ocean Grove, New Jersey, Toronto and other places, her main object having been to simplify scientific teachings and make them attractive to persons of all ages. Personal life Colman died Sunday, January 10, 1909, at her home in Brooklyn, New York, and was buried in a family plot in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. Her death was caused by gas asphyxiation, a \\"supposed accident\\" according to a coroner's medical doctor. The funeral service was held four days later, with Ella A. Boole, speaking on behalf of the WCTU. Some of her letters are located in Madison, Wisconsin at the Henry Root Colman Papers, State Historical Society of Wisconsin.

He is also the co-founder of covariant.ai, a venture-funded start-up that aims to teach robots new, complex skills, and co-founder of Gradescope, an online grading system that has been implemented in over 500 universities nationwide. He is best known for his cutting-edge research in robotics and machine learning, particularly in deep reinforcement learning.  Early Life and Education  Abbeel was born in Antwerp, Belgium in 1977. He grew up in nearby suburb Brasschaat. As a high school student at Sint-Michielscollege (Brasschaat), Abbeel played on the club basketball team. He went on to play on the basketball team of KU Leuven University, where he obtained a Bachelor of Science and Master of Science in electrical engineering in 2000. Abbeel received his Ph.D. in computer science from Stanford University. He specialized in artificial intelligence research, noting that his interest in AI sparked from the realization that AI can help build tools for other disciplines and that intelligence sets humans apart from other species. Originally, Abbeel intended to pursue a master's degree in computer science, but decided to stay for his Ph.D. due to the abundance of AI projects happening at Stanford. He was the first PhD student of AI Professor Andrew Ng, who was a first-year professor at Stanford at the time. After finishing his Ph.D. in 2008, Abbeel became an assistant professor in Berkeley's electrical engineering and computer science department.  Career  Upon his arrival at UC Berkeley as an assistant professor, Abbeel founded the Berkeley Robot Learning Lab. Additionally, in 2014, he co-founded Gradescope with other UC Berkeley-affiliated engineers Arjun Singh, Sergey Karayev, Ibrahim Awwal, which was acquired by TurnItIn in 2018. In 2016, Abbeel joined OpenAI, where he has published numerous articles on reinforcement learning, robot learning, and unsupervised learning. Also in 2016, he became co-director of the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR) Lab, which consists of post-doctoral, graduate, and undergraduate students interested in machine learning and robotics. He also founded Berkeley Open Arms, which has licenses the IP on the Blue Robot project from Berkeley. In 2017, he became a full-time professor with tenure at UC Berkeley. In October 2017, Abbeel and three of his students, Peter Chen, Rocky Duan, and Tianhao Zhang, co-founded covariant.ai (formerly named Embodied Intelligence). The launch of this venture-funded company based in Emeryville, California was covered in, among others, New York Times, Wired, MIT Technology Review, IEEE Spectrum. To date, covariant.ai is still in stealth mode, but their website discloses that they draw on recent advances in deep imitation learning and deep reinforcement learning to develop AI software that makes it easy to teach robots new, complex skills. Currently, in addition to his research, Abbeel teaches upper-division and graduate classes on Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Deep Unsupervised Learning.

Early life Kathleen Behan was born Kathleen Kearney on either the 18 or 19 September 1889 at 49 Capel Street, Dublin. She was the fifth child and youngest daughter of pork butcher and grocer, John Kearney (1854‚Äì1897), and his wife Kathleen (1860‚Äì1907) (n√©e McGuinness). She had four brothers and two sisters. John was from Rosybrook, County Louth and Kathleen from Rathmaiden, Slane, County Meath, and both came from prosperous farming families. Her father had a business on Lower Dorset Street, with a grocery, pub and a row of houses. Owing to his own poor management, by the time Behan was born he had a smaller business on Dolphin's Barn Lane. Following his death in 1897, Behan and her sisters were placed in the Goldenbridge orphanage, Inchicore by their mother. She was there from 1898 to 1904 where she became an avid reader. When she left, she rejoined her family in a one-room tenement flat on Gloucester Street. Republican activity and family Her oldest sibling, Peadar Kearney, was an ardent republican who wrote the lyrics to the song that would become the Irish national anthem, \\"The soldier's song\\". It was through him that Behan met a printer's compositor and member of the Irish Volunteers, Jack Furlong. They married in 1916. Behan was an active member of Cumann na mBan, and served as a courier to the General Post Office, Dublin and other outposts during the Easter Rising 1916. At the same time, Furlong fought in the Jacob's factory garrison. The couple had two sons: Roger Casement (‚ÄòRory‚Äô) Furlong (1917‚Äì1987) and Sean Furlong, born March 1919. Sean was born six month's after Behan was widowed when Furlong died in the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918. She lived with her mother-in-law, who was also a republican and seamstress who made Irish Volunteer uniforms. She was arrested for running an IRA safe house. She worked for a short time for Maud Gonne as a housekeeper, where she met W. B. Yeats and Sarah Purser. A study painted of Behan by Purser is now in the National Gallery of Ireland entitled The sad girl. From 1918 to 1922 she worked as a clerk in the Dublin Corporation, whilst also a caretaker in the Harcourt Street branch of the White Cross republican aid association. In 1922 she married Stephen Behan, house painter, trade unionist and fellow republican. The couple had four sons and one daughter: Brendan, Seamus (b. 1925), Brian, Dominic, and Carmel (b. 1932). Brendan was born while his father was imprisoned during the Irish Civil War, and Behan claimed that Michael Collins gave her money while she was pregnant. Stephen's mother owned three slum tenements, so the Behans lived rent-free in a one-room basement flat at 14 Russell Street. Owing to her disdain at gossiping on the house steps, she was nicknamed \\"Lady Behan\\" by her neighbours. When Stephen's mother died in 1936, the Behans moved to a newly built council house in Crumlin, living at 70 Kildare Road. The family found the new house far from work and school, and the local area devoid of community. The family experience extreme poverty frequently, owing to Stephen's unemployment and during the 9 month long building strike of 1936. Behan attempted to claim a pension as her first husband had served in 1916, but her application was rejected. She had said the exposure to flour had effected Furlong's lungs negatively. It was declined as she had remarried before the enactment of the Army Pensions Act 1923. Despite their circumstances, the house attracted conversation, music, books and politics. The Behan's republican, socialist, labour activist and anti- clericalism had a strong effect on their sons, particularly Brendan and Dominic. Such was the volume of radical meetings that took place at the Behan home, it was dubbed \\"the Kremlin\\" by their neighbours, and a \\"madhouse\\" by Stephen. During The Emergency of 1939 to 1945 she fought against local shopkeepers who ignored price controls, and was labelled as \\"red\\" for her anti-Franco and pro-Stalin sympathies. Her reply to the branding of her as such was \\"I‚Äôm not red, I‚Äôm scarlet.\\" Later life From the 1950s onwards, Behan shared international fame with her sons Dominic and Brendan. She often travelled to London to see their plays, eventually appearing on British and Irish television and cultivating her own following. She was badly injured when she was struck by a motorcycle, a day before Stephen's death in 1967. Owing to the effect of these injuries, she moved in 1970 to the Sacred Heart Residence of the Little Sisters of the Poor, Sybil Hill, Raheny. In 1981, she recorded an album When all the world was young. Taped conversations of her reminiscences were made into an autobiographic book by her son Brian, Mother of all the Behans in 1984. A one-woman stage adaptation of the book by Peter Sheridan and starring Rosaleen Linehan was acclaimed in Ireland, Britain and North America. Behan died in the nursing home in Raheny on 26 April 1984, and is buried in Deans Grange Cemetery.

Life and work  Vladimir Radunsky grew up in Moscow where he studied fine art, design and architecture. In 1973, he studied at the Moscow Architectural Institute. In 1982, he emigrated to New York, became a US citizen, and continued his work as a graphic designer, producing mainly art books and children's books. Radunsky produced very different types of books, such as a book of shapes for young readers, Square Triangle Round Skinny (a set of four books shaped the way their titles suggest); Discovery, a lyrical poem by Nobel-prize winner Joseph Brodsky about the discovery of America, and What Does Peace Feel Like?, a compilation of conversations with children during school visits in the US and Europe. His interactive book, Le Grand Bazar, subtitled For people with imagination age 5 to 105 (published in Paris by Edition du Panama), requires the reader to use scissors, pen, and stapler. Boy Meets Girl is to be read forward, backward, upside down and inside out. The Mighty Asparagus (Harcourt) combines the works of Italian Renaissance painters with his own paintings in a collage.. The Hip-Hop Dog, written by Chris Raschka (HarperCollins), is hip-hop poetry for children, where graffiti art has migrated from walls into a printed book. For his exhibition at Milanese gallery Nina Due and, subsequently, at the Palazzo delle Esposizioni in Rome, Radunsky presented a unique collection of clothes for animals.. Among the works that he designed were an anaconda's wedding dress, a horse's riding breeches, and a hippo's bathing trunks. For the new production of the ballet Don Quixote at the Roman Teatro dell'Opera's 2017-2018 season, Radunsky created the set and costumes. The libretto, originally created in the middle of the nineteenth century by the French Choreographer Marius Petipa, inspired Radunsky to design the set as an enormous pop-up book.

Its career was brief but it made the first generally recognized soaring flight in Poland, a strong refutation of the current idea that Polish topography was not suited to the sport. Design and development ZASPL, the Aviation Association of students of the Lw√≥w Technical University, was the oldest aviation organization in Poland. Revived after World War I, by 1926 it had workshops in Lw√≥w which began building the glider designs of ZASPL member Wac≈Çaw Czerwi≈Ñski. The first of these was the Czerwi≈Ñski CW I. Design work began in 1923, with the intention of competing in the Second National Polish Glider Contest of 1924, but the structure of glider was not completed until 1926 and its covering was only finished in 1927 after it had been moved to the LOPP hangar at Skni≈Ç√≥w airport. Static structural tests followed completion and its first, car-launched flight was made on 13 March 1928. The wooden CW I was a cantilever monoplane with a high, three-part wing. The wings's short, rectangular plan centre-section was integral with the fuselage, built around three spars and plywood covered. The outer panels were straight-tapered, with ply covering around their leading edges and fabric covering over the remainder of the wing surfaces, including those of the ailerons. The glider's fuselage was rectangular in section, narrow and deep with an aerofoil-like profile and tapering aft in plan. It was ply covered forward and fabric covered aft, with the pilot's open cockpit at the wing leading edge. The rear surfaces were fabric covered; its fin had a cropped triangular profile and its almost semi-circular cantilever tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage, carrying roughly rectangular plan, generous, balanced elevators. Its rudder, also balanced, was straight edged and extended to the keel, working in an elevator cut-out. The CW I landed on a pair of skids mounted beneath the fuselage, assisted by a tailskid. Operational history Soon after its first flight in March 1928, the students took the CW I on a search for Polish gliding sites and in late May they arrived at ≈Åysa G√≥ra near Z≈Çocz√≥w. There, Szczpan Grzeszczyk made three short trial flights and on 26 May made the first true soaring flight in Poland. It only lasted 253 seconds and gained only in altitude; though poor by international standards, this flight encouraged Polish glider enthusiasts' hopes for the sport in Poland. The same day, the CW I was seriously damaged during its next launch; Greszczyk was injured and the glider abandoned.

He was trained as a chemical engineer and worked for China Steel before serving on the fifth Legislative Yuan between 2002 and 2005. Career Wang studied chemical engineering at Chung Yuan Christian University. He accrued two decades experience within the steel industry, rising to become the president and later chairman of China Steel. During Wang's tenure as chairman, China Steel earned NT$23 billion. In February 2000, Wang announced that China Steel had launched an e-commerce company as joint venture with FarEasTone. He was considered for reappointment in May 2001, though the Ministry of Economic Affairs chose to designate Kuo Yen-tu as chairman. His departure from China Steel was thought to be for political reasons; similar sentiments were stated of Wang's successors in the post. After leaving China Steel, Wang remained in leadership positions in several business organizations, among them the ROC-USA Business Council, the Taiwan Steel & Iron Industrial Association, and the Association of Industry for Environmental Protection ROC. He also served as founding chairman of the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corporation, within which China Steel worked to help construct the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit system. Wang was known for his support of nuclear power, and had questioned the viability of potential alternatives. Wang backed the Pan-Blue Coalition's joint presidential ticket in the 2000 election. He was placed on the Kuomintang party list for the 2001 legislative election, and was seated in the Legislative Yuan. While a member of the legislature, Wang continued serving as president of the Taiwan-USA Business Council, Taiwan Steel & Iron Industries Association, and deputy chairman of the Chinese International Economic Cooperation Association. The People First Party considered nominating Wang as a candidate for the Kaohsiung mayoralty in 2002, but he did not run. However, he was active in persuading other Pan-Blue candidates to run for local office. As a legislator, Wang took an interest in government debt, especially that of state-owned enterprises. In January 2003, Wang proposed that opposition parties should form a shadow government. In November 2005, months after his legislature term had ended, the Kuomintang nominated him to sit on the National Communications Commission. Instead, Wang returned to business and industry. Though he had assumed the chairmanship of Tong Lung Metal Industry in 2002, Wang did not consider a restructuring of the company complete until March 2006, a year after he stepped down from the Legislative Yuan. Still deputy chairman of the Chinese International Economic Cooperation Association through 2008, Wang was named chairman of the non-profit organization by 2010. As chairman of the CIECA, Wang traveled to Latin America, India, Malaysia, and Myanmar.

Anderson took part in several scientific expeditions, and was chosen in 1904 to lead the Duke of Bedford's Exploration of Eastern Asia. Early life Anderson was born 6 April 1879 in Irvington, Indiana as the son of Melville Best Anderson and his wife Charlena (n√©e van Vleck). Anderson was one of his parents' two children who survived to adulthood; the other was a younger brother, Robert van Vleck Anderson. From ages eleven to fifteen, Anderson attended school in Germany. Upon returning to the United States, Anderson attended Stanford University, graduating in 1904 with a Bachelor of Arts in zoology. Beginning at age 15, Anderson took part in collecting expeditions, befriending scientists and academics such as Ray Lyman Wilbur. Before completing his degree, he had already undertaken thousands of miles' worth of scientific expeditions, traversing Arizona, California, and Alaska. Career In 1904, Anderson was chosen by the Zoological Society of London to be the leader of Duke of Bedford's Exploration of Eastern Asia. While his personal interest was mostly in the study of birds, his role in the expedition was to procure new mammal specimens. The Exploration began in July 1904 in Yokohama, Japan. From 1904-1907, Anderson traveled through Japan, eastern China, and Korea. In 1908, he took a break from scientific collecting, traveling Europe with his mother Charlena. The second leg of the expedition began in Wuhan on 5 October 1909 and ended in Shanghai on 13 September 1910. In total, the Bedford Exploration of Eastern Asia collected over 2,700 individual mammals, resulting in many newly-described species. Anderson collected the holotypes of several species, including the Shinto shrew and Japanese red-backed vole. After completing the Exploration of Eastern Asia, Andersoon took two collecting trips to South America. The first trip was with Wilfred Hudson Osgood and the second was with his wife, Mary Elizabeth. In 1911, British zoologist Oldfield Thomas wrote: \\"to our great loss and regret Mr Anderson now proposes to give up the arduous life of the field collector.\\" Death In response to the demands of World War I on American manufacturing, Anderson began working at a shipyard in 1918, as he was unable to join the Army. On 21 February 1919, Anderson died when he fell from the scaffolding at Moore's Shipyard in Oakland, California. Following his death, his father eulogized him in the scientific journal The Condor. Personal life Anderson married Mary Elizabeth Gurnee, a distant cousin, on 15 June 1913. They had one son, Malcolm Gurnee Anderson, who died in infancy. Species named in his honor Several species were named in honor of Anderson, including: *Japanese red-backed vole (Myodes andersoni)--Thomas, 1905 *Anderson's shrew mole (Uropsilus andersoni)--Thomas, 1911 *Anderson's white-bellied rat (Niviventer andersoni)--Thomas, 1911 *Anderson's four-eyed opossum (Philander andersoni)--Osgood, 1913 References 1879 births 1919 deaths Stanford University alumni American zoologists ","title":"Malcolm Playfair Anderson"},{"id":"58391168","text":"Frances W.

She was the first exemplar of a European missionary-wife who worked in Ghana for a long period. Between 1847 and 1877, Widmann lived on the Gold Coast and was actively involved in both the Christian ministry and women's vocational education. Her sojourn in Akropong was in three phases: January 1847 to April 1850; December 1851 to June 1867 and January 1869 to spring 1877. Widmann was also a prolific writer, noted for her detailed diary entries of her thoughts and travels, everyday life as a missionary-wife, her interactions with her school pupils and with the Akan peoples of Akropong, providing a vivid narrative of nineteenth century European missionary activity in colonial Ghana, situated against the Akan culture.  Early life  = Childhood and education = Rosina Binder was born on 13 November 1826 in Korntal, a then newly founded Pietist village close to Stuttgart, Germany. Some scholars have suggested that her grandparents may have been among the first settlers of Korntal. The daughter of a farmer, Rosina Binder came from a large family and had ten other siblings, including half-brothers and sisters, with whom she grew up in southern Germany where the W√ºrttemberg Pietist lifestyle was commonplace. Her mother was the second wife of her father. She had a very basic education and later enrolled at a girls‚Äô school where she learnt sewing and housekeeping. In her records, she was described as ‚Äúa simple Christian who had no higher education‚Äù but nonetheless gifted with an appreciable Biblical knowledge. It is said that in nineteenth century feudal Germany, Rosina Binder had ‚Äúaspirations to rise socially but only knew ordinary cooking.‚Äù = Marriage proposal = In 1845, when Rosina Widmann was nineteen years old, she received an unusual arranged marriage proposition from the Basel Mission: a thirty-one year-old German man, Johann Georg Widmann (1814 - 1876) who had attended the Basel Mission Seminary in Basel, Switzerland and had been working on the Gold Coast as missionary for three years was looking for a life partner. Upon the recommendation of the Rev. Jakob Heinrich Staudt, the local Lutheran minister and a former lecturer at the Basel Mission Seminary, Binder had been chosen by the Basel Committee of Friends as a potential suitor for J. G. Widmann. Like all Basel missionaries, Widmann had arrived in Ghana as a bachelor and had to prove himself in the field for a minimum of two years, before permission could be granted by the Home Committee to find a suitable wife or so-called mission bride on his behalf. Due to the cost of travel, Johann Widmann could not physically go to Europe to find a bride. Though Rosina Binder had never met her future husband, she was asked to marry him and join him at the mission station in Akropong in a tropical region known for its high missionary death toll. By her own account, Johann Widmann did not even know her name. The Basel Mission Inspector, Wilhelm Hoffmann who happened to be in her hometown met Binder and found her suitable. He reported to the Home Committee that Rosina Binder would accept the proposal as soon as her grandmother gave her approval of the union, after which she would learn English and be trained in domestic skills. Rosina Binder accepted marriage proposal. On 17 September 1846, at her commissioning service, the Lutheran pastor, the Rev. Staudt, selected Psalm 46 with emphasis on verses 1 and 7 as her Biblical verse for blessing: ‚ÄúGod is our shelter and strength, always ready to help in times of trouble. The Lord Almighty is with us, the God of Jacob is our refuge.‚Äù The pastor had wanted to bless her by laying on of hands but the church elders objected to it and the suggestion was shelved. At the time of her departure from her hometown in Germany, her mother was gravely ill after giving birth to her youngest child. She noted in her diary, ‚ÄúThen I went to my beloved mother, who sat up in her bed and cried her heart out and couldn‚Äôt say more than: So you want to go now‚Ä¶Because of her weakness I did not speak many words and quickly rushed out of the room. Therefore, I forgot to say goodbye to my little two week-old sister, Sophie.‚Äù = Voyage to London and the Gold Coast = On 19 September 1846, in Pietist fashion, she bade an emotional farewell to her grandmother, parents and siblings before leaving with four missionaries, Johann Dieterle, Joseph Mohr, Johannes Stanger and Friedrich Meischel who were also going to the Gold Coast. When they were about thirty minutes outside Korntal, a group of young women with whom she had started a prayer fellowship six months earlier presented her with a token of grapes as ‚Äúproof of their love‚Äù for her. She entered a London- bound passenger steamship. During the voyage, she and the missionaries often sang Lutheran hymns. Rosina Binder was in London for nearly two months, from 23 September to 20 November 1846. During her stay in London, she wrote in her diary, ‚ÄúI looked at all the strangeness, strange people, strange language and strange customs with a heavy heart. Besides, I was very afraid of the long sea voyage.‚Äù While in the British capital, she struggled to learn the English language. The big city was strange to her as were the fashion style and Victorian version of pietism. She had not yet received a letter from her fianc√©, Johann Widmann as normal ship connection was yet to be established and communication with the Gold Coast was spotty at best. She worried even more when she learnt that her mother‚Äôs health was deteriorating. She experienced desolation ‚Äúillness and a spiritual crisis\\" ‚Äì a lack of faith, feeling her calling to be a missionary had left her and neither Scripture nor prayer could lift her morale. She was hosted by an English couple, Mr. and Mrs. Young. Per historical records, Mr. Young appeared to have made inappropriate advances towards her which she rejected. Mrs. Young blamed her for her husband‚Äôs boorish behaviour. In anguish and out of fear, she locked herself in her bedroom to pray, suppressing her cries with the room‚Äôs sofa. In time, she met several Moravian and other evangelical groups in London. She also came into contact with a European missionary-wife based in Sierra Leone who coached her on her future life as a mission bride. When she was about to leave London for the Gold Coast in November 1846, the husband of the missionary-wife commended her on her improved English skills. A week before her departure, she also received her first letter from Johann Widmann which gave her hope in the sustenance of providence and restored her weakened faith ‚Äìan asset for her future life in the mission field at Akropong. While on the first steamship she had even seen in her life, a twenty year-old Rosina Binder wrote a diary entry on New Year‚Äôs Eve in 1846, ‚ÄúToday seems to be a special and notable day. Exactly a year ago, I received the call to go to the Mission Field. How many difficulties have I gone through within this last year? And quite some pleasant experience too. Thanks be to God for everything.‚Äù On 6 January 1847, the ship sailed past Cape Three Points and by the afternoon, towards Cape Coast. A day later, she arrived in Cape Coast after the seven-week passage. She was transported to the shore via a landing boat. Of her first impression, she penned, ‚ÄúThe heat was pressing; I felt like being in a completely different world. People, animals, plant and houses everything was alien to me. My mind‚Ä¶and my body were very strained.‚Äù Binder and the missionaries were received by one Mr. Freeman and an English couple, Mr. and Mrs. Allen. As there was no vacancy at the mission house at Cape Coast, she was hosted by the Hatten family, a respected Euro-African mulatto family who lived a ‚Äúnewly built beautiful [stone] house‚Äù. Mr. Hatten, a merchant in whose name the steamship was addressed, was away on a business trip. Rosina Binder was therefore received by Mrs. Hatten. = Marriage = Johann Georg Widmann Rosina Binder arrived in Christiansborg on 15 January 1847. Johann Georg Widmann who had been waiting for her on the coast for two days, had by then returned to Akropong to attend to urgent mission work. A few days after her arrival, Rosina Binder finally met her fianc√©, Johann Widmann for the first time. In her own account, their first meeting was full of nervous excitement. Binder recalled, ‚ÄúBecause I had not seen my dear groom before and would not be able to identify him, I asked that he should be pointed out to me to prevent any embarrassment. I cannot put into words the feelings that overcame my heart when I met with my dear husband. One has to experience something of this nature‚Ä¶We did not look at each other as if we are seeing each other for the first time, because even before we met, the Lord had tied our hearts deeply together. Before we left the room where we greeted each other for the first time, we fell on our knees and thanked the Lord, who had brought us together. We didn‚Äôt see each other as if we had seen ourselves for the first time. For the Lord, who has made the covenant ‚Äì what we really believed joined our hearts in love before we knew each other. O how much would I have loved to share my joy with my beloved ones at home.‚Äù Widmann, Binder and the other missionaries departed from the Gold Coast on 19 January 1847 and arrived in Akropong the next day. The wedding ceremony was on 21 January 1847. The event was attended by West Indian and Basel missionary families. Several Akropong indigenes peered through the chapel window to catch a glimpse of the bride. The newlyweds deeply cared for each other, forging a strong bond and survivalist mindset due to the eternal fear of death from tropical disease. During her first pregnancy, Rosina Widmann fell ill to the extent she was unable to recognise her husband. She gave birth to a boy. Johann Winder and Rosina Binder had eleven more children, with four girls dying at an early age and were buried at the Akropong mission cemetery. The rest were sent to Basel and lived in the missionary boarding house or in the missionary girls‚Äô house. Another son died in Korntal.  Life on the Gold Coast  = Missionary-wife in Akropong = On 19 January 1847, Rosina Widmann sat in a basket to acclimatise to the lush green of the tropical rainforest of the Akan inland. Hammocks, stretchers, palanquins and baskets were most commonly used as means of transporting missionaries to the hinterlands during that period. After her wedding, she spent eighteen months trying to master the Twi language. She became proficient in Twi to the point of saying, ‚ÄúIn the evening, I prayed with my girls [from Akropong who lived and worked with them]. I asked the Lord in their own mother tongue. Thanks be to God that this is now possible.‚Äù By mastering the language, she was able to make new friends among the Akuapem community. She also befriended the West Indian missionary families and shared wine and sweets with their children. From her diaries, she mentioned that the West Indians became dissatisfied with the mission entreprise due to the failure of the Basel mission administration to fully honour their conditions of service. A missionary living on the coast, Schiedt visited Akropong as a result. There was a fracas between J. G. Widmann and Schiedt concerning the workplace grievances of the Jamaican families. Schiedt left for the coast in late January 1847 only to return in July 1847 after Johann Widmann went to Christiansborg to settle his differences with Schiedt. According to Rosina Widmann, the disagreement caused her anxiety. Missionaries Schiedt, Widmann and Meischel then attended a mission conference in August 1847. She observed the marital fidelity issues between Liberian missionary, George Peter Thompson (1819 ‚Äì 1889) and Angolan-born Moravian Jamaican educationist, Catherine Mulgrave (c.1827 ‚Äì 1891). Furthermore, she witnessed the tension that existed among the Basel missionaries who quarrelled frequently with one another. She remarked, ‚ÄúI told Brother Mohr that it would be much better to be open with each other, because otherwise I am often under a heavy inward pressure.‚Äù This situation depressed and distressed her, making her homesick, constantly worrying about her ageing parents in Germany. She also experienced loneliness as her husband travelled for weeklong stays in neighbouring towns for mission work and to visit members of his congregation. J. G. Widmann served as the resident minister of the Basel Mission Church at Akropong, later renamed the Christ Presbyterian Church from 1845 to 1876. During this period, her school pupils who lived in her household kept her company. Rosina Widmann wrote in 1848 that one of her school girls, Amba comforted her tenderly during her illness, characterised by ‚Äúheadache and freezing [chills], dizziness and vomitting‚Äù. She allowed Amba and another schoolgirl, Abena to sleep in her bedroom to alleviate her loneliness when her husband was away. Another pupil, John slept in the hall. Once when her husband, J. G. Widmann was very ill, she lamented, ‚ÄúSince two weeks, he suffers from fever and O God, a lot of tears and thoughts about death are within me. My hand is shaking while I am writing this. He has just fallen asleep and looks utterly miserable. O Lord, do you want to take him already away from me? Don‚Äôt tempt me more than I could stand. O, you will not do it. And if you take this dear soul away. O God, my Saviour make me strong. God have mercy on me that I will not lose faith.‚Äù Her husband eventually recovered from his illness and she nursed him back to full health over a long period. In an episode at Akropong, one of the Jamaicans, Ann Rochester, an unmarried woman, was writhing in abdominal pain, which could not be relieved with any medication available, herbal or otherwise. Rosina Widmann was in the company Rochester's brother and sister; Mrs. Miller, the wife of Joseph Miller, a Jamaican missionary and a few other women from the village. It turned out that she had been impregnated by a senior West Indian missionary. Both the baby and Ann Rochester died during labour. Cataloguing this tragedy in her diary, Rosina Widmann stated, ‚ÄúMy pain was so great and still is. O what a high price she has to pay for her sin. O, may our dear Saviour hear her sights and receive her with grace.‚Äù The Basel mission refused to bury Ann Rochester in the mission cemetery because in their view, she was ‚Äúguilty of sin.‚Äù They accused the Widmanns of shielding the identity of the alleged father of the deceased baby. The Basel missionaries at Akropong also sent letters of complaints to the Home Committee. In an attempt at evangelism in December 1848, she visited the tiny compound of an amiable old woman from the town of Davu. Widmann initiated conversation with hint of conversion by talking about Christian concepts such original sin, repentance, redemption, salvation, life after death and heaven. The old woman immediately walked away to the other end of the courtyard to sweep the floor and ‚Äúput the chickens and goats in the stall.‚Äù Indirectly, Widmann's message against ‚Äúfetishes‚Äù had been rejected by the aged woman. Rosina Widmann then proceeded to proselytize to the elderly lady's only daughter and several other women in the vicinity. In another case, she had a philosophical conversation with an old Akuapem woman about the concept of a Supreme Being vis-√†-vis Christian and native traditional beliefs. Rosina Widmann often visited the sick, especially women in Akropong, within both the mission and native communities. This endeared her to the people who paid her visits in the ‚ÄúChristian village‚Äù or Salem quarters of Akropong. On one of such visits, an Akropong woman, out of curiosity, commented on her shawl, prompting Widmann to explain differences in textile production, as practised by her mother and sisters, using broad looms in Europe as compared the locally made Akropong stoles that were made by the method of strip-weaving. The conversation lasted until almost midnight. From the tone of her writings, Rosina Widmann had not fully acculturated into Gold Coast society by 1849. Widmann also acted as an arbiter in disputes in Akropong. In 1874, Widmann was an intermediary between the chieftain of Akropong, Okuapemhene, his council of elders and the elderly mother of a deceased king who lived on a plantation in a hamlet called Mamprobi, near a mausoleum where the kings were interred. The old woman's self-imposed exile was due to feeling neglected by her sons and the then Okuapemhene, Nana Asa Kurofa. As a result, she refused to attend the traditional yearly yam festival, Odwira. The palace courtiers therefore invited Rosina Widmann to mediate in the crisis between the senior woman and the chieftain. Moreover, when one of the wives of the Akropong ruler - Gyebia, an Asante, had a dispute, her husband, the woman sought refuge at the mission station and was housed by Rosina Widmann. Widmann intervened in the matter and helped the royal couple settle the matter. The Widmanns returned to Korntal for furlough twice during their long sojourn on the Gold Coast. = Work in vocational education = The Basel Mission's vocational training for girls was instituted by Rosina Widmann in late January 1847, when she started classes in needlework for 12 girls at her home in Akropong where the Gold Coast mission headquarters was stationed. Rosina Widmann had sought permission from the then, Okuapemhene, Nana Kwadade I for young girls in his chiefdom to be educated. Per the Basel Mission's newspaper in Akropong, the Station Chronicle, four female pupils enrolled at the new school almost immediately after the request. This number rose to 17 girls two months later and to 24 students by August 1847. It was later reported that the foundation class was made up of a few schoolgirls from the royal family, the ruling Asona clan of Akropong. In 1848, there were 37 girls who attended the morning general lessons with 25 boys. In 1849, 30 girls and 30 boys attended the morning school. The Basel Mission gave each pupil a small sum of money, colloquially called ‚Äúfood money‚Äù (Kostgeld) for feeding expenses. The Kostgeld was an incentive to keep enrollment afloat. The commencement of classes at Mrs. Widmann's school was shortly after her husband, J. G. Widmann and others had started teaching boys at Akropong. In this period, weaving was the most common form of textile production in the Akan hinterland and the profession of seamstress or dressmaker as introduced by Widmann was a novel innovation there. Previously, sewing and weaving the traditional cloth, ‚Äúkente‚Äù were considered a man's domain in Akan society. Women were forbidden from touching the loom in Akuapem jurisdictions while their counterparts on the coasts could engage in commercial crafts. Dressmaking, thus, became a source of employment and economic opportunity for women at Akropong. The vocational experimental model which also incorporated reading, writing, arithmetic, English and the basics of Christianity, evolved into the girls‚Äô school at Akropong. This education framework also included school children living with missionary families in their homes to be educated in a Christian way while employed as household staff or housemaids. Rose Ann Miller (1836 ‚Äì 1930), a Jamaican educator and the oldest of West Indian children who accompanied their parents to the Gold Coast in 1843, was Rosina Widmann's de facto interpreter. Miller started assisting Widmann as early as 1848 when she was only twelve years old. Some apprehensive parents did not allow their daughters to attend the school in the mornings when academic subjects were taught but permitted them to go in the afternoon to learn sewing. Later Widmann would add reading, arithmetic and Bible studies to the afternoon curriculum. She began all her classes with a short prayer recited in the Twi language. School ended with a verse from Protestant hymn. Children were required to memorise the Lord's Prayer and English hymn verses. The teaching materials included a Twi language Primer and English textbooks. In one notable case, a girl named Adwoa Yirenkyiwa, born c. 1841 decided as a child that she wanted to attend Mrs. Widmann's school. Her mother rejected her proposition initially. When Yirenkyiwa refused to eat food, her mother acceded to her wish and took her to Rosina Widmann. The first two girls who lived in the Widmann household, though not yet baptised learned to recite the prayer, ‚ÄúDear Saviour, give me a new heart! You died for us to redeem us, forgive my sins for the sake of your name.‚Äù The Akropong girls who lived with the Widmanns some faced dilemmas: food choices that were culturally forbidden by Akan society. In 1849, mothers provided food for their wards in missionary care in accordance with their dietary prohibition. This system changed in 1852 when the Rosina Widmann starting providing food to pupils under her tutelage. An Akuapem girl living in her household refused chevon, fearing corporal punishment from her mother if she violated the cultural taboo. In April 1850, when the Widmanns went to Europe, pupils stopped attending the school and none had been baptised. The school was later re-opened by Julie Mohr and Friederike Dieterle, spouses of missionaries, Joseph Mohr and Johann Dieterle. The school's population once again increased. In 1851, the sister of William Yirenkyi, a local student catechist was sent to the school by their mother who was a princess. Another royal member, Susanna Luise Anyama was one of Widmann's schoolgirls. She was sent to Basel in 1858 for further training. In 1864, she was considered a prospective bride for David Asante, the first native Akan Basel missionary on the Gold Coast. Anyama, however declined the offer stating her desire to live in Europe. A close relation Anyama, Ama Otwe attended the girls‚Äô mission school in 1853. Otwe's half-sisters Susanna and Abenewa were also pupil of Widmann. The first baptism of girls in training was on 8 August 1853. These include Catherine Buruwa who married Paul Staudt Keteku, a catechist and translator. Martha Korantemaa, who married Aburi catechist, Edward Samson, was baptised in 1856. Keteku and Buruwa's daughter was christened in 1858 ‚Äì the first of its kind in Akropong for native Christians. In 1859, Yaa Krobea, fianc√©e of catechist, William Hoffmann Yirenkyi was baptised. Krobea was a student of Rosina Widmann. When Lydia, the baptised sister of Susanna Luise Anyama died in 1859, she became the first Akuapem Christian to be buried at the mission cemetery. As Lydia was of royal lineage, her family initially opposed it but eventually acquiesced. Widmann also trained non-Christian brides of the mission's native catechists and teachers to know the rudiments of the Christian faith and housekeeping. Ernestine Mader, missionary-wife of the School Inspector gave evening lessons in literacy to some of the prospective brides of teacher trainees. Some catechists whose future wives became pregnant before marriage were dismissed, as the situation was at odds with Basel Mission's Pietist standards for monogamy and procreation while the polygamous traditional society, being more flexible, permitted it childbearing outside marriage. In 1869, Johann Georg Widmann wrote to the Basel Home Committee on return to the Gold Coast from furlough in Germany, to brief the mission's central administration on his wife's work: ‚ÄúShe has taken over the running of the toddler school again and started a Sunday school for women and virgins, where she is supported by 5 monitors (assistant teachers) ... In our household, we have 15 people, some our former children, some young girls, of whom three are orphans, two girls and a little boy ...‚Äù The number of girls who came to Rosina Widmann's school increased to 70 over time. When the Basel Mission started distributing for the school children, enrollment climbed to 80 or 90 by the end of the 1840s. Attrition was high as many students left within six to twelve months. The school population dwindled further once the mission stopped proving cloth for the enrolled pupils. In the end, only the pupils living in the missionary household remained in the school.  Later years and death  Rosina Widmann stayed in Ghana, working for the Basel Mission for three decades and permanently returned to Korntal at the age of 50 in the spring of 1877, a few months after the passing of her husband. The Rev. J. G. Widmann died on 27 November 1876 and his remains were buried in Akropong. At Johann Widmann's funeral service, the chief of the town, the Krontihene attended the ceremony with his entourage of drummers though they remained outside the chapel, in silence, throughout the burial service. The chief's delegation accompanied the funeral procession to the mission cemetery. Rosina Widmann died on 14 November 1908 in Korntal at the age of eighty-two. Rosina's Widmann's near singular effort in the vocational education of girls at Akropong, without any instructional support from Basel, disproved an earlier assertion made by the Inspector of the Basel Mission, the Rev. Josenhans that ‚Äúwomen were a burden for missionary work.‚Äù  References  1826 births 1908 deaths People from Korntal-M√ºnchingen People from the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg Christian missionaries in Africa Female Christian missionaries Heads of schools in Ghana German Protestant missionaries Gold Coast (British colony) people Protestant missionaries in Ghana Women educators German expatriates in Ghana ","title":"Rosina Widmann"},{"id":"58391180","text":"Kloster Gnadenthal is the name of a former Cistercian nunnery dating back to 1235 which was changed to a Protestant Stift for women in 1564, and became the centre of the ecumenical community Jesus-Bruderschaft (Jesus Brotherhood) in 1969. It is part of H√ºnfelden, Hesse, Germany.  History  The nunnery dates back to 1235, then called in Latin \\"Vallis gratiae\\" (Valley of mercy). It was probably founded to house noble ladies, estimated around 50. From the 14th century, women from bourgeois families in Frankfurt and Limburg were also accepted. The nunnery had sheep, forests, a mill and workshops. The nunnery was associated with Marienstatt Abbey, from the end of the 14th century with Eberbach Abbey for around a century, then again with Marienstatt. The economic situation of the nunnery deteriorated during the 15th century. In 1513, a reform was undertaken. In 1564, Gnadenthal became part of Nassau. The nuns now followed Protestant teaching and left the order, creating a Lutheran Stift for women (Damenstift). Abbess Magdalena of Irmtraut had a new √Ñbtissinenhaus (abbess's house) built by Ludwig von Weilburg from 1589. The premises were destroyed in 1634 during the Thirty Years' War. After the war, the remaining buildings were used as an estate. Around 1705, Johann Georg Weitzel restored the church, but in more modest form. His successors used it as a stable. In 1935, the estate was divided into eight farms. In 1969, the ecumenical community (Jesus Brotherhood) acquired part of the property and built new houses and the \\"Haus der Stille\\" (House of silence).

It has between four and eight large, egg-shaped leaves and up to ten small pale green or pinkish flowers with the dorsal sepal and petals forming a hood over the column.  Description  Goodyera umbrosa is a tuberous, perennial herb with a loose rosette of between four and eight shiny bright green, wavy, egg-shaped leaves, long and wide. Between three and ten resupinate, pale green to pinkish flowers, long and wide are borne on a fleshy flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal is long, about wide and overlaps the petals, forming a hood over the column. The lateral sepals and petals are a similar size to the dorsal sepal with the lateral sepals spreading downwards. The labellum is hairy, broadly egg-shaped, long, about wide with a deep pouch. Flowering occurs from June to August. Taxonomy and naming The native jade orchid was first formally described in 2004 by David Jones and Mark Clements who gave it the name Eucosia umbrosa and published the description in The Orchadian. In 2014, Julian Shaw changed the name to Goodyera umbrosa. The specific epithet (umbrosa) is a Latin word meaning \\"shaded\\".

The preserve is used for educating the community about ecology, geology and archaeology along with general outdoor recreation. History Picture Canyon was listed on the National Registry of Historic Places on January 10, 2008. The 478-acre preserve was purchased October 30, 2012 at a public auction on the steps of Coconino County Courthouse from the State Land Department by the City of Flagstaff for $4.8 million after several community groups rehabilitated the area and rallied decades for its protection. An agreement was made with the Wildcat Hill Wastewater Treatment Plant, located immediately south of the preserve, to provide a constant water source for the riparian habitat and wildlife. Reclaimed water is discharged into a pond which feeds the Rio de Flag through a rugged geological canyon composed of basalt rock. Thousands of years ago, between 700-1300 AD, this area was home to the natives known as the Northern Sinagua (people without water). Picture Canyon is named for the large density of petroglyphs created by the Sinagua located along the river. Hundreds of panels were created depicting archers, geometric shapes, and local animals like birds and turtles. Trails and Natural Features There are three trails within the preserve: * Tom Moody Trail is a 2.8-mile outer loop within the preserve. An outdoor classroom with educational panels is located near the start of the trail. The southeast section of the trail initially runs parallel with the Rio De Flag and along the canyon walls where a visitor can view the waterfall within the preserve. Continuing northeast, after crossing the Rio De Flag Bridge, will bring a visitor to a waterbird petroglyph site. * Don Weaver Trail is a 0.7-mile section connecting with the Tom Moody Trail to create a smaller loop and brings a visitor to the opposite side of the canyon walls for another view of the waterfall. * Arizona Trail is a 1.5-mile section of the larger 800+ mile trail that spans from Mexico to Utah, and bisects the Tom Moody Trail. { \\"type\\": \\"FeatureCollection\\", \\"features\\": [ { \\"type\\": \\"Feature\\", \\"properties\\": {}, \\"geometry\\": { \\"type\\": \\"Point\\", \\"coordinates\\": [ -111.5581798553467, 35.22479770358486 ] } } ] } Gallery File:Picture Canyon Tom Moody Trail.jpgTom Moody Trail File:Picture Canyon Rio De Flag.jpgDon Weaver Trail File:Picture Canyon Waterfall.jpgWaterfall - view from Tom Moody Trail File:Picture Canyon Rio De Flag Meadow.jpgMeadow at the Rio De Flag bridge.

Description They were small animals, averaging about the size of a modern rabbit, had many primitive features. In life, they would have resembled a long-tailed muntjac or chevrotain. Dichobunids had four or five toes on each foot, with each toe ending in a small hoof. They had complete sets of teeth, unlike most later artiodactyls, with their more specialist dentitions. The shape of the teeth suggests they were browsers, feeding on small leaves, perhaps in the forest undergrowth. The shape of their bodies and limbs suggests they would have been fast-running animals, unlike most of their contemporaries. Taxonomy McKenna and Bell (1997) listed homacodonts as a subfamily of Dichobunidae. However, subsequent authors recognize Homacodontidae as a distinct family in its own right.J. M. Theodor, J.

He was executed on September 8, 2018. Ramin Hossein Panahi, who had twice been arrested in the mid-2000s, was accused of carrying out acts of sabotage in Iran in 2014 on behalf of the Komala Party of Iranian Kurdistan, an armed Kurdish opposition group which is blacklisted as a terrorist group by Tehran. In mid-June 2017, according to Iranian security, he was tasked with infiltrating Iran in order to carry out a terrorist attack during International Quds Day rallies in the same month. Security sources said he was arrested on 23 June 2017, after being injured in armed clashes with Iranian security operatives. Three of his accomplices were killed in the process.  International call  Panahi's case was a \\"breathtaking miscarriage of justice from start to finish\\" according to Amnesty's Philip Luther. Panahi was \\"denied access to both his lawyer and his family, as well as to any details of the evidence against him\\" according to Amnesty International. Panahi had been in danger of execution by the Iranian government since 2017 according to Kurdish news agencies like Kurdistan 24. Panahi's brother told VOA Persian that his brother had been transferred to death row in a prison in the city of Sanandaj in June 2018. In June 2018, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights of the United Nations issued a call to annul the death sentence of Panahi, which had previously been set for 3 May. OHCHR stated that \\"a request for a judicial review was rejected by the Iranian Supreme Court in late May, and the sentence against him was then referred to the office responsible for carrying it out.\\" The BBC reported that his execution had been prevented by a 'Twitter outcry', and that the Iranian authorities had \\"bowed to an online campaign to save him.\\" On September 7th, UN rights experts called on Iran to halt the imminent executions of Ramin Hossein Panahi, Zanyar and Loghman Moradi. UN human rights experts claimed that they did not receive a fair trial and were tortured during pre-trial detention. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet stated in the 39th session of the Human Rights Council: \\"I deeply deplore the executions last week of three Iranian Kurdish prisoners, despite the serious concerns raised by Special Procedures mandate holders that they were not afforded fair trials, and were subjected to torture. Recent arrests and ill-treatment of a number of human rights defenders and lawyers are deplorable. All those detained for peacefully exercising rights to freedom of expression and association should be released.\\" A pair of cousins, Zaniar Moradi and Loghman Moradi, were executed along with Panahi on 8 September 2018.

It is located on the low Kempen plateau and has predominantly sandy soil. The village has medieval fishponds that once belonged to the Agnetendal convent in Peer, and an arboretum that originated in 1907 as an experimental plantation to grow wood that would make good pit props. Historically a relatively poor and sparsely populated agricultural settlement, in the later 20th century it became a commuter village for people employed in Eindhoven and Genk. Transport and communications Wijchmaal lies about north-east of the junction of the national roads N73 (Kessenich ‚Äì Tessenderlo) and N74 (Hasselt ‚Äì Eindhoven), and is served by the bus route between Hamont-Achel and Hasselt operated by De Lijn. Between 1890 and 1948 there was an important interchange on the rural tram system. Trains on the line between Hasselt and Eindhoven that opened in 1866 stopped in the village, but passenger trains stopped running to Wijchmaal in 1958, and goods trains in 1980. History Bronze Age and Iron Age burial mounds and Roman inhumations were excavated in the village in the years around 1900. The name Wijchmaal is first attested in 1007, under the form Vuicmale. Other medieval spellings include Wimale, Wichmale and Wyghmale. In the 11th century the settlement's overlord was Sint-Truiden Abbey, and the village church, dedicated to St Trudo, was built or renovated by Abbot Adelard II of Sint-Truiden (1055‚Äì82) as a chapel of ease. Rights of presentment and tithes continued to belong to the abbey until the end of the 18th century, but during the Middle Ages the lordship passed to the control of the counts of Loon and then the prince-bishopric of Li√®ge. The village had its own bench of aldermen until the French Revolution. The church became a parish church in 1608, and the first parish priest was appointed in 1611. The parish of Wijchmaal once included a number of hamlets that are no longer distinct from the village itself. After the Concordat of 1801 the church, which had been closed during the years of the revolution, again became a chapel of ease. It was demolished and rebuilt in 1878, and extended in 1939. A school is attested as early as 1616, but lessons took place in a room that the village rented from a tavern. A dedicated classroom was probably built in 1772. A village school for boys and girls was built in 1861 and demolished in 1976. A separate girls' school opened in 1913, run by Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul, who after the interruption of the First World War began work on a convent in 1922. In 1926 they also opened a school for neglected and retarded children that would become the special needs school Medisch Pedagogisch Instituut Sint- Elisabeth. An entirely new village school was built in 1983-84.

His father, Donnie Dee, played for the Indianapolis Colts in the NFL for two seasons, while his mother, Jackie, was on the cross country team at the University of Tulsa. He has a younger sister Jenny who played basketball at UC Irvine. Johnny Dee was a part of the Rancho Buena Vista Little League All-Star team that advanced to the 2005 Little League World Series, playing shortstop.

Portland State was the only Division I school to offer him a scholarship, but Dee decided to walk on at San Diego. College career When Dee arrived at San Diego, the team was coming off a 6‚Äì24 season and point-shaving scandal.

Its main line ran from Elmira, New York, to Camden, New York. It was formed in 1884 from the consolidation of other railroads and merged into the Lehigh Valley Railroad in 1905. Under the Lehigh Valley it was known as the Elmira and Cortland Branch. Almost all of its former line has since been abandoned.  History  The Elmira, Cortland and Northern Railroad (EC&N;) was created on March 7, 1884 from the merger to two railroads, the Utica, Ithaca and Elmira Railroad (UI&E;) and the Cazenovia, Canastota and DeRuyter Railroad (CC&D;). The UI&E; owned a line between Elmira and Cortland, New York, which had been built in sections between 1871 and 1881. The CC&D;'s line extended from Cortland north to Canastota, New York. The oldest segment, Cazenovia, New York, to Canastota, had been opened by the Cazenovia and Canastota Railroad on December 7, 1869. The company extended south to DeRuyter, New York, in 1878. The New York, Ontario and Western Railway closed the gap between DeRuyter and Cortland; the CC&D; had trackage rights over this route and later leased it. The EC&N;, via its wholly owned Canastota Northern Railroad subsidiary, extended its line north from Canastota to Camden in 1887. Financially troubled from the beginning, the company turned a small profit in 1889. The much larger Lehigh Valley Railroad had completed its extension through the Finger Lakes area to Buffalo, New York, in 1892. Competition from the Lehigh Valley, particularly on coal, hindered the EC&N;'s growth. The potential of the EC&N; to provider feeder traffic for its new line intrigued the Lehigh Valley, which purchased the company on February 20, 1896. A formal merger followed in 1905. Under the Lehigh Valley the EC&N;'s Elmira‚ÄìCamden line was known as the Elmira and Cortland Branch and managed as part of the railroad's Auburn Division.  Elmira and Cortland Branch  The line from Elmira to Camden measured . It interchanged with several other railroads, including the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad, Erie Railroad, New York, Ontario and Western Railway, Pennsylvania Railroad, and the New York Central Railroad. The Lehigh Valley abandoned the section between Van Etten and Spencer, New York, in 1933, as it was redundant to the parallel Ithaca Branch. A further abandonment occurred in 1935 between Spencer and East Ithaca, New York. Abandonment of the section between Horseheads, New York, and Van Etten followed in 1938; thereafter Lehigh Valley trains required trackage rights over the Erie to reach Elmira. Also abandoned in 1938 was the Canastota‚ÄìCamden extension. Passenger service ended on the entire branch by 1941. The branch was cut back further, from Canastota to Cortland, in 1967. A washout in June 1972 from Hurricane Agnes damaged the route between East Ithaca and Freeville, New York, which the bankrupt Lehigh Valley decided to not repair. Later abandoned in 1975 was the remaining track between Elmira and Horseheads. The sole remnant of the branch between Freeville and Cortland was incorporated into Conrail in 1976. Conrail would abandon all but within the vicinity of Cortland. This line is owned by the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway.

Avison (June 30, 1860 - August 29, 1959) was a Canadian doctor, physician, humanitarian, missionary and professor, who spent over four decades spreading Western medical knowledge in Korea during the Kaehwagi or Enlightenment Period. Avison was recognized for founding and opening the Severance Hospital and the Severance Medical College in Seoul in 1904, two interlinked institutions that sought to treat the sick and expose the Korean natives to the practical teachings of Western medicinal sciences. Through fundraising efforts across North America prior to the opening, Avison received a series of donations from American philanthropist Louis H. Severance, the namesake for the teaching hospital. Avison was most known for his innovative ecumenical approach to combine the efforts of medical missionaries across various denominations, pushing against the prevailing modus operandi of foreign medical missionaries in Korea at the time. Focused on increasing collaborative efforts, Avison believed that spreading the love of God was best achieved through educational missions alongside medical ones. Avison's influences were drawn from Methodist philosophies as well as an admiration for his role model, Horace Underwood, the first Presbyterian missionary to work in Korea.  Early Life: Education/Personal Life  Oliver R. Avison was born on June 30, 1860, in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, England, the third child in the family. In 1866, Avison and his family moved to Brantford, Ontario. By 1869, Avison moved to Almonte, where he graduated from Almonte and District High School. He became a teacher at Hutton's School House, a public school close to Smith's Falls. After spending a year teaching, Avison enrolled in a preparatory school for university, with the ultimate goal of studying and teaching at the University of Toronto, from which he graduated in 1887. Avison met his wife, Jennie Barnes, while working at a drug store in Smith's Falls. They were married on July 28, 1885. Together, they moved to Korea in July 1893 under the board of Foreign Missions of the Presbyterian Church of the USA. They lived in Korea for forty years until 1934 when they were expelled by the Japanese invaders. Avison was awarded a Gold Medal for Pharmaceutical Proficiency for his excellence in the Ontario College of Pharmacy's (OCP) qualifying examinations. Upon graduating from OCP, Avison was offered a role as an instructor. In 1887, Avison graduated from the University of Toronto with a Bachelor of Medicine, M.B.  Missionary Work  = Work in Korea = Avison was always involved in missionary work. He worked as a lay-preacher in Toronto, and by 1885, had helped found the YMCA at the University of Toronto, where he served as its president. Avison was also the chief editor of the Medical Missionary, a Toronto-based publication first published in 1890. Avison's missionary service experience was inspired primarily through his relationship with and admiration for Horace Underwood, his role model. Underwood was the first American Presbyterian Missionary to work in Korea in 1885. In November 1892, Avison extended an invitation to Underwood to visit him in Toronto and discuss his missionary work. Inspired by Underwood's tales, Avison contacted the Methodist Church of Canada in the hopes of being sent to Korea. His proposal was rejected. In response to this, Underwood applied on behalf of Avison to the American Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions in New York without his permission. Frank Ellinwood, the Secretary of the Board, invited Avison to New York to discuss the application Underwood had submitted. Despite the fact that Avison was originally a member of the Sherbourne Street Methodist Church, he decided to work with the Presbyterian Board. By 1893, he was appointed as an official medical missionary. Avison was also inspired by the poor state the Korean health system was at the time, as well as the inefficiencies of the lacking collaboration between missionaries of different denominations. Avison packed up his bags and arrived in Pusan, South Korea, with his family in June 1893. By August, the family had moved to Seoul. Avison began working at Chaejungwon, the Royal Hospital. He was first appointed as a private physician to King Kojong, whose trust Avison earned upon successfully diagnosing and treating him for lacquer poisoning. Through this post, Avison was seen as governmentally endorsed by the Koreans. The hospital in which Avison was working at was highly regulated, as the Department of Diplomatic and Commercial Affairs would send Korean government officials in to supervise. However, this was resulting in an overcrowding of the facilities. Avison petitioned for control over the hospital's operations completely independent from the government. In his demands, he expressed the desire to remodel the hospital with sole funding from the Mission Board. Through this, Avison hoped that the Korean government's intervention would cease. Only two years after his arrival to Seoul, Avison's proposal was eventually accepted. This kickstarted a new era of privatization in Korea's medical scene.  Cholera Outbreak  Upon Avison's arrival to Seoul, he was highly distressed by the lacking medical awareness throughout the population. At the time, there was a great discrepancy in knowledge about the causes of disease, as superstitious beliefs ran wide. Avison's first intervention involved the public health issue of cholera. Avison and his team, appointed by the Korean Minister of Home Affairs, set out to erect educational shelters around Seoul. These facilities' purpose was to educate the population on how cholera was spread, as there was a pervasive misconception that it had to do with spirits. Avison also designed and printed over 50,000 posters with the same educational message, all in the hopes of bringing a modern medical perspective to Korea. Avison perceived these efforts to be one of his greatest achievements.  Creation of Severance Hospital  At the time, there were a variety of American missionary organizations organizing for medical missionaries to enter the country. These medical missionaries would go on to open small clinics from which they would work out of under their own supervision. There was no collaboration between the highly dispersed and independent work being done by missionaries stationed in Korea. Avison, dismayed by the lack of collaboration for reasons he did not believe to be valid, desired to resolve this conflict. By 1899, the Avison family temporarily moved back to Canada, as both Avison and his wife fell ill. While back in Canada, Avison met with the architect Henry B. Gordon to discuss the design of blue prints for a new hospital Avison wanted to build in Korea. Upon recovering from his illness, Avison made his way to New York to speak at the Ecumenical Conference on Foreign Missions in Carnegie Hall. Louis H. Severance, a member of the audience, approached Avison and became a large financial contributor, enamored by his vision. Upon returning to Seoul, Avison purchased a 9-acre sized plot in the Todong district. Henry Gordon, the architect, arrived to Korea in June 1901 to oversee the construction site. His presence was needed due to the lack of awareness among local contractors about Western building requirements. On September 23, 1904, Avison's hospital, Severance Hospital and College, first opened its doors. By 1934, thousands of patients had been treated in Severance Hospital. Avison also expanded the Hospital to include the first modern medical school in Korea, which is now known as Yonsei University College of Medicine. He was the principal of Severance Union Medical College and Chosen Christian College for eighteen years and integrated them to be one university. This medical education in Korea began during construction of the hospital when Avison ordered the translation of medical textbooks to Korean, and within ten years Avison saw the graduation of the nation's first seven medical students. These students also received Korea's first licenses to practice medicine. Avison's approach to providing a medical education to the local population through the hospital was exceptionally revolutionary at the time. The Severance Hospital was regarded as the \\"headquarters\\" of medicine in Korea.Severance Hospital in 1904  Development of Medical Mission Theory  While serving as director of the House of Universal Helpfulness for six years, Avison developed a new medical mission theory. Through his speech entitled \\"Comity in Medical Missions,\\" Avison presented his theory in Carnegie Hall at the 1900 Ecumenical Missionary Conference, where notable figures such as President Benjamin Harrison were in attendance. His theory consisted of three components: cooperation, the simultaneous development of a hospital and medical school, and transferring the hospital to the natives. His talk covered the necessity for increased collaboration between the missionaries stationed in Korea, arguing that the medical work being carried out ought not to be a denominational enterprise. Instead, Avison's vision was to open a hospital in which joint efforts of all missionaries would take place. It was this idea of a united medical mission that led Severance to fund the hospital. By 1913, six differing denominations were collaborating within the hospital, sending missionaries to work there.  Retirement  The Avison family left Korea for the last time on December 6, 1935. Although his son Douglas Avison wanted to take over his position, Avison passed on his role to Dr. Keung Seon Oh, the representative of the Southern Presbyterian Mission Board for the Severance Medical College. Upon return, Avison relocated his family to Florida, U.S.A. Avison's wife, Jennie, died on September 15, 1936. Avison outlived her by twenty years, passing away on August 28, 1956. Both Avison and his wife were buried in Smith's Falls. In 1943 Dr. Avison remarried Agnes Gertrude Pope (nee Rennee) who died on June 2, 1958.Agnes Avison Dies; Widow of Missionary, Tampa Bay Times, 6/4/1958, 13-B  Legacy  Avison is regarded as the founder of westernized medicine in Korea and his medical mission theory has enabled this modern medicine to be sustained in Korea. While most of the Christian mission hospitals established in the 20th century are now closed, Severance Hospital continues to progress, making it a notable establishment in the medical mission world. By 2005, the hospital's rapid expansion led to its movement to a new building and 2014 brought a new cancer center to the hospital. Overall, Severance Hospital has laid the foundation for modern medicine in Korea, and due to Avison's efforts, it has produced many doctors and nurses and an improvement in medical care. Fifty years after the opening of his teaching hospital, Avison's hospital helped Korea transition from being a country that received medical help from missionaries, to being a country that sends out missionaries. Avison's approach towards the local population at the time was notably secular. Avison spread Western medical practices and sciences, ultimately leading to a great transformation within the indigenous population into well-trained, respected doctors, nurses and clinicians.

At the time the sign was made, the Powhatan Confederacy had been destroyed and its people enslaved for decades. The history of nicotine marketing stretches back centuries. Nicotine marketing has continually developed new techniques in response to historical circumstances, societal and technological change, and regulation. Countermarketing has also changed, in both message and commoness, over the decades, often in response to pro-nicotine marketing. Pre-1800 The coughing, throat irritation, and shortness of breath caused by smoking are obvious, and tobacco was criticized as unhealthy long before the invention of the clinical study. In the 1604 A Counterblaste to Tobacco, James VI of Scotland and I of England described smoking as \\"A custome lothsome to the eye, hatefull to the Nose, harmefull to the braine, dangerous to the Lungs, and in the blacke stinking fume thereof, neerest resembling the horrible Stigian smoke of the pit that is bottomelesse\\", and urged his subjects not to use tobacco.A Counterblaste to Tobacco (retrieved February 22, 2008) Quote: A custome lothsome to the eye, hatefull to the Nose, harmefull to the braine, dangerous to the Lungs, and in the blacke stinking fume thereof, neerest resembling the horrible Stigian smoke of the pit that is bottomelesse. In the 1600s, many countries banned its use. Pope Urban VIII issued a 1624 papal bull condemning tobacco and making its use in holy places punishable by excommunication; Pope Benedict XIII repealed the ban one hundred years later.Cutler, Abigail. \\"The Ashtray of History\\", The Atlantic Monthly, January/February 2007. 1800‚Äì1880 A sign asks readers (likely tobacco chewers) not to spit on the floor. Part of an anti-tuberculosis campaign by the Norwegian Women's Public Health Association. The first known nicotine advertisement in the United States was for the snuff and tobacco products and was placed in the New York daily paper in 1789. At the time, American tobacco markets were local. Consumers would generally request tobacco by quality, not brand name, until after the 1840s.More About Tobacco Advertising and the Tobacco Collections. Scriptorium.lib.duke.edu. Many European tobacco bans were repealed during the Revolutions of 1848. Cigarettes were first made in Seville, from cigar scraps. British soldiers took up the habit during the Crimean War (1853‚Äì1856). The American Civil War in the early 1860s also led to increased demand for tobacco from American soldiers, and in non-tobacco- growing regions. Public health measures against chewing tobacco (spitting, especially other than in a spitoon, spread diseases such as flu and tuberculosis) increased cigarette consumption. After the development of color lithography in the late 1870s, collectible picture series were printed onto cigarette cards, previously only used to stiffen the packaging. In 1913, a cigarette brand was advertised nationally for the first time in the US. RJ Reynolds advertised it as milder than competing cigarettes. Mass production and temperance, 1880‚Äì1914 cigarette-rolling machine mass-produced cigarettes at fifty times the speed of a human cigarette roller. Pre-rolled cigarettes, like cigars, were initially expensive, as a skilled cigarette roller could produce only about four cigarettes per minute on averageBonsack's cigarette machine .

URL last accessed 2006-10-11 Mass production revolutionized the cigarette industry.Bennett, W.: The Cigarette Century, Science 80, September/October 1980. URL last accessed 2006-10-11. Cigarette companies began to reckon production in millions of cigarettes per day. Higher production and cheaper cigarettes gave companies an incentive to increase consumption. By the last quarter of the 19th century, magazines carried advertisements for different brands of cigarettes, snuff, and pipe tobacco. Demand for cigarettes rose exponentially, ~doubling every five years in Canada and the US (until demand began to rise even faster, ~tripling during the four years of World War I). =Anti-tobacco movements= \\"The Deadly Cigarette\\"; a 1905 cartoon celebrates bans on the sale and possession of tobacco in three U.S. States, and calls on other states follow their lead. In the late 1800s, the temperance movement was strongly involved in anti-tobacco compaigns, and particularly with the prevention of youth smoking. They argued that smoking was addictive, unhealthy, stunted the growth of children, and, in women, was harmful during pregnancy. By 1890, 26 American states had banned sales to minors. Over the next decade, further restrictions were legislated, including prohibitions on sale; measures were widely circumvented, for instance by selling expensive matches and giving away cigarettes with them, so there were further bans on giving out free samples of cigarettes. After women won the vote in the early 1900s, temperance groups successfully campaigned for Juvenile Smoking Laws throughout Australia. At this time, most adults there smoked pipes, and cigarettes were used only by juveniles.  1914‚Äì1950  A poster soliciting donations for a fund to send cigarettes to the front in WWI. A nurse lights a pipe for an injured soldier, who guides her hand. The implication that tobacco heals is subtle, but was consistently used. There is also an implication that the nurse finds smoking sexually attractive. = World War I = Valcartier military base near Quebec City Free or subsidized branded cigarettes were distributed to troops during World War I. Demand for cigarettes in North America, which had been roughly doubling every five years, began to rise even faster, now approximately tripling during the four years of war. In the face of imminent violent death, the health harms of cigarettes became less of a concern, and there was public support for drives to get cigarettes to the front lines. Billions of cigarettes were distributed to soldiers in Europe by national governments, the YMCA, the Salvation Army, and the Red Cross. Private individuals also donated money to send cigarettes to the front, even from jurisdictions where the sale of cigarettes was illegal. Not giving soldiers cigarettes was seen as unpatriotic. = Interwar = By the time the war was over, a generation had grown up, and a large proportion of adults smoked, making anti-smoking campaigns substantially more difficult. Returning soldiers continued to smoke, making smoking more socially acceptable. Temperance groups began to concentrate their efforts on alcohol. By 1927, American states had repealed all their anti-smoking laws, except those on minors. Modern advertising was created with the innovative techniques used in tobacco advertising beginning in the 1920s.Donald G. Gifford (2010) Suing the Tobacco and Lead Pigment Industries, p.15 quotation: Stanton Glantz in Mad Men Season 3 Extra ‚Äì Clearing the Air ‚Äì The History of Cigarette Advertising, part 1, min 3:38 quotation: Advertising in the interwar period consisted primarily of full page, color magazine and newspaper advertisements. Many companies created slogans for their brand and used celebrity endorsements from famous men and women. Some advertisements contained fictional doctors reassuring customers that their specific brand was good for health. Smoking was also widely seen in films, possibly due to paid product placement . In 1924, menthol cigarettes were invented, but they were not initially popular, remaining at a few percent of market share until marketing in the fifties. In the 1920s, tobacco companies continued to target women, aiming to increase the number of smokers.Statement: Surgeon General's Report on Women and Tobacco Underscores Need for Congress to Grant FDA Authority Over Tobacco (Campaign for Tobacco- Free Kids) . Tobaccofreekids.org. At first, in light of the threat of tobacco prohibition from temperance unions, marketing was subtle; it indirectly and deniably suggested that women smoked. Testimonials from smoking female celebrities were used. Ads were designed to \\"prey on female insecurities about weight and diet\\", encouraging smoking as a healthy alternative to eating sweets. Campaigns used the traditional association that smoking was improper for women to advantage. They marketed cigarettes as \\"Torches of Freedom\\", and made a dependence-inducing drug a symbol of women's independence. Lung cancer rates in women rose sharply. In 1929 Edward Bernays, commissioned by the American Tobacco Company to get more women smoking, decided to hire women to smoke their \\"torches of freedom\\" as they walked in the Easter Sunday Parade in New York. He was very careful when picking women to march because \\"while they should be good looking, they should not look too model-y\\" and he hired his own photographers to make sure that good pictures were taken and then published around the world.Brandt, Allan M. (2007). The Cigarette Century. New York: Basic Books, pp. 84-85. In 1929, the Sturmabteilung, the paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party, founded a cigarette company as a way to raise funds and make itself less financially dependent on the party leadership. SA members were expected to smoke only SA brands.Robert N. Proctor, The Nazi War on Cancer, pp. 234‚Äì237. There is evidence that coercion was used to promote the sale of these cigarettes. Through this scheme, a typical SA unit earned hundreds of Reichsmarks each month.Thomas D. Grant, Stormtroopers and Crisis in the Nazi Movement, p. 102. The brand also promoted political ideas, being sold with collectible image sets showing historical army uniforms.Joyce Goodman and Jane Martin, Gender, Colonialism and Education, p. 81. = Medical concerns = Skyrocketing European lung cancer rates drew attention from doctors in the twenties and thirties. Lung cancer had been a vanishingly rare disease. Before 1900, there were only 140 documented cases worldwide. Then, suddenly, lung cancer became a leading cause of death in many countries (a status it retains to this day). Initially, suspicion was cast on causes including road tar, car exhaust, the 1918 flu pandemic, racial mixing, and the use of chemical weapons in World War I. However, in 1929, a statistical analysis strongly linking lung cancer to smoking was published by Fritz Lickint of Dresden. He did a retrospective cohort study showing that those with lung cancer were, disproportionately, smokers. He also found that men got lung cancer at several times the rate of women, and that, in countries where more women smoked, the difference was much smaller. In 1932, a study in Poland came to the same conclusion, pointing out that the geographic and gender patterns of Polish lung cancer deaths matched those of smoking, but no other suggested cause, such as industry or cars (rare in Poland at the time). The medical community was criticized for its slow response to these findings. One 1932 paper attributed the slow response to smoking being common among doctors, as well as the general population. Some temperance activists had continued to attack tobacco as expensive, addictive, and leading to petty theft. In the thirties, they also began to publicize the medical findings. There was popular awareness these dangers of smoking (see accompanying quote). = World War II = Advertisement featuring Joe Dimaggio in 1941 A K-ration contained a pack of four cigarettes (front). War Stamps associates the brand still more closely to war patriotism. Despite these findings, free and subsidized branded cigarettes were distributed to soldiers (on both sides) during World War II. Cigarettes were included in American soldiers' K-rations and C-rations, since many tobacco companies sent the soldiers cigarettes for free. Cigarette sales reached an all-time high at this point, as cigarette companies were not only able to get soldiers addicted, but specific brands also found a new loyal group of customers as soldiers who smoked their cigarettes returned from the war. A faction of the Nazi Party opposed tobacco use. The Institute for Tobacco Hazards Research was founded. Some of those working with it were involved in mass murder and unethical medical experiments, and killed themselves at the end of the war, including Karl Astel, the head of the institute. The institute and other organizations directed anti-smoking campaigns at both the general public and doctors. Campaigns included pamphlets, reprints of academic articles and books, and smoking bans in many public places; bans were, however, widely ignored. An industry-funded counter- institute, the Tabacologia medicinalis, was shut down by Leonardo Conti. Restrictions on cigarette advertising were enacted. After 1941, the Nazi party restricted anti-tobacco research and campaigns, for instance ordering the private anti-tobacco magazine Reine Luft to moderate its tone and submit all materials for censorship before publication. Tobacco companies continue to exploit associations with Nazis to fight anti-tobacco measures. Modern Germany has some of Europe's least restrictive tobacco control policies, and more Germans both smoke and die of it in consequence.  1950‚Äì70  Until the 1970s, most tobacco advertising was legal in the United States and most European nations. In the 1940s and 50s, tobacco was a major radio sponsor; in the 1950s and 60s, they became predominantly involved in television. In the United States, in the 1950s and 1960s, cigarette brands frequently sponsored television shows‚Äînotably To Tell the Truth and I've Got a Secret. Brand jingles were commonly used on radio and television. Major cigarette companies would advertise their brands in popular TV shows such as The Flintstones and The Beverly Hillbillies, which were watched by many children and teens. In 1964, after facing much pressure from the public, The Cigarette Advertising Code was created by the tobacco companies, which prohibited advertising directed to youth. Advertising continued to use celebrities and famous athletes. Popular comedian Bob Hope was used to advertise for cigarette companies. The African-American magazine Ebony often used athletes to advertise major cigarette brands. The nicotine industry also promoted \\"modified risk\\" nicotine products, falsely implied to be less harmful, such as roasted, \\"filter\\", menthol, and ventilated (\\"light\\") cigarettes. These products were used to discourage quitting, by offering unwilling smokers an alternative to quitting, and implying that using the alternate product would reduce the hazards of smoking. \\"Modified risk\\" products also attract new smokers. It is now known that these products are not less harmful. Filter cigarettes became near-universal, but smokers suffered just as much illness and death. Initially, efforts were made to develop filters that actually reduced harms; as it became obvious that this was not economically possible, filters were instead designed to turn brown with use. Light cigarettes became so popular that, as of 2004, half of American smokers preferred them over regular cigarettes,Light but just as deadly, by Peter Lavelle. The Pulse, 21 October 2004. According to The Federal Government's National Cancer Institute (NCI), light cigarettes provide no benefit to smokers' health.The Truth About \\"Light\\" Cigarettes: Questions and Answers, from the National Cancer Institute factsheet'Safer' cigarette myth goes up in smoke, by Andy Coghlan. New Scientist, 2004 There is no evidence that menthol cigarettes are healthier, but there is evidence that they are somewhat easier to become addicted to and harder to quit. Racial marketing strategies changed during the fifties, with more attention paid to racial market segmentation. The civil rights movement lead to the rise of African-American publications, such as Ebony. This helped tobacco companies to target separate marketing messages by race. Tobacco companies supported civil rights organizations, and advertised their support heavily. Industry motives were, according to their public statements, to support civil rights causes; according to an independent review of internal tobacco industry documents, they were \\"to increase African American tobacco use, to use African Americans as a frontline force to defend industry policy positions, and to defuse tobacco control efforts\\". There had been internal resistance to tobacco sponsorship, and some organizations are now rejecting nicotine funding as a matter of policy. Race-specific advertising exacerbated small (a few percent) racial differences in menthol cigarette product preferences into large (tens of percent) ones. Menthol cigarettes are somewhat more addictive, and it has been argued that race-specific marketing for a more addictive product is a social injustice.https://blackdoctor.org/507006/african-american-tobacco-control- leadership-council-to-president-obama-give-our-community-a-fighting-chance/ Despite it being illegal at the time, tobacco marketers gave out free cigarette samples to children in black neighbourhoods in the U.S. Similar practices continue in parts of the world; a 2016 study found over 12% of South African students had been given free cigarettes by tobacco company representative, with lower rates in five other subsaharan countries. Worldwide, 1 in 10 children had been offered free cigarettes by a tobacco company representative, according to a 2000-2007 survey. fulltext on Wikisource) denied health effects In 1954, tobacco companies ran the ad \\"A Frank Statement.\\" The ad was the first in a disinformation campaign, disputing reports that smoking cigarettes could cause lung cancer and had other dangerous health effects.Daily Doc: TI, Jan 4, 1954: The 'Frank Statement' of 1954 . Tobacco.org. 30 September 2000. Retrieved 17 July 2009. It also referred to \\"research of recent years\\", although solid statistical evidence of a link between smoking and lung cancer had first been published 25 years earlier. Prior to 1964, many of the cigarette companies advertised their brand by claiming that their product did not have serious health risks. A couple of examples would be \\"Play safe with Philip Morris\\" and \\"More doctors smoke Camels\\". Such claims were made both to increase the sales of their product and to combat the increasing public knowledge of smoking's negative health effects. A 1953 industry document claims that the survey brand preference among doctors was done on doctors entering a conference, and asked (among a great many camouflage questions) what brand they had on them; marketers had previously placed packs of their Camels in doctors' hotel rooms before the doctors arrived, which probably biassed the results. In 1964, Smoking and Health: Report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General of the United States was published. It was based on over 7,000 scientific articles that linked tobacco use with cancer and other diseases. This report led to laws requiring warning labels on tobacco products and to restrictions on tobacco advertisements. As these began to come into force, tobacco marketing became more subtle (for instance, the Joe Camel campaign resulted in increased awareness and uptake of smoking among children). However, restrictions did have an effect on adult quit rates, with its use declining to the point that by 2004, nearly half of all Americans who had ever smoked had quit.  Post- advertising-restrictions; 1970 and later  Marlboro shirt in the 1980s. Owning and being willing to use promotional items is a significant risk factor for nicotine addiction. The period after nicotine advertising restrictions were brought in is characterised by ingenious circumvention of progressively stricter regulations. The industry continued to dispute medical research: denying, for instance, that nicotine was addictive, while deliberately spiking their cigarettes with additional nicotine to make them more addictive. Advertising restrictions typically shift advertising spending to unrestricted media. Banned on television, ads move to print; banned in all conventional media, ads shift to sponsorships; banned as in-store advertising and packaging, advertising shifts to shill (undisclosed) marketing reps, sponsored online content, viral marketing, and other stealth marketing techniques. Another method of evading restrictions is to sell less-regulated nicotine products instead of the ones for which advertising is more regulated. For instance, while TV ads of cigarettes are banned in the United States, similar TV ads of e-cigarettes are not. The most effective media are usually banned first, meaning advertisers need to spend more money to addict the same number of people. Comprehensive bans can make it impossible to effectively substitute other forms of advertising, leading to actual falls in consumption. However, skillful use of allowed media can increase advertising exposure; the exposure of U.S. children to nicotine advertising is increasing as of 2018. Veterans Stadium, Philadelphia in 1986; a ban on TV and radio ads meant more reliance on ads at sports venues, which would appear on television In the US, sport and event sponsorships and billboards became important in the 1970s and 80s, due to TV and radio advertising bans. Sponsors benefit from placing their advertising at sporting events, naming events after themselves, and recruiting political support from sporting agencies. In the 1980s and 90s, these sponsorships were banned in the US and many other countries. Spending has since shifted to point-of-sale advertising and promotional allowances (where legal), direct mail advertising, and Internet advertising. Stealth marketing is also becoming more common, partly to offset mistrust of the tobacco industry. Billboard in Denver promoting Old Gold cigarettes (May 1972) One major Indian company gives annual bravery awards in its own name; some recipients have rejected or returned them. Nicotine use is frequently shown in movies. While academics had long speculated that there was paid product placement, it was not until internal industry documents were released that there was hard evidence of such practices. The documents show that in the 1980s and 1990s, cigarettes were shown in return for ‚â§six-figure (US$) sponsorship deals. More money was paid for a star actor to be shown using nicotine. While this sponsorship is now banned in some countries, it is unclear whether the bans are effective, as such deals are generally not publicized or investigated. Smokers in movies are generally healthier, more successful, and more racially privileged than actual smokers. Health effects, including coughing and addiction, are shown or mentioned in only a few percent of cases, and are less likely to be mentioned in films targeted at younger viewers. In the nineties, internet access expanded in many countries; the web is a major medium for nicotine advertising. Both Google and Microsoft have policies that prohibit the promotion of tobacco products on their advertising networks.Advertising.microsoft.com. Advertising.microsoft.com (28 September 2011).Adwords.google.com. Adwords.google.com. However, some tobacco retailers are able to circumvent these policies. On Facebook, unpaid content, created and sponsored by tobacco companies, is widely used to advertise nicotine- containing products, with photos of the products, \\"buy now\\" buttons and a lack of age restrictions, in contravention of ineffectively enforced Facebook policies. In 1998, the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement was reached between the then four largest United States tobacco companies Philip Morris (now Altria), R. J. Reynolds, Brown & Williamson and Lorillard. 21st century In 2011, the US Food and Drug Administration wrote a major review of menthol cigarettes, which are somewhat more addictive and no healthier than regular cigarettes. It was subsequently proposed that they should be banned, partially on grounds that race-specific marketing for a more addictive product is racist.

Centers A call center is an office with the capacity to field many telephone calls for a company. Types of call center work can include customer service and telemarketing. Factors that have made India attractive as a hub of call center work from the US, UK, and Australia include its convenient time zone, low labor costs, and large English-speaking population. The introduction of call center and other business processing work to India picked up in the 1990s as Fortune 500 countries began offshore outsourcing this work to India. British Airways, American Express, and Dell are examples of companies that utilize call centers in India. Other countries with comparable call center industries include Bangladesh and the Philippines. Workers There were approximately 350,000 call center workers in India . Call center workers in India are largely under the age of thirty, unmarried, and college-educated, regardless of gender. Call center work is typically done overnight to accommodate time zones in the US, UK, and Australia, and employees are required to be fluent in English. =Gendered dynamics= Although there are roughly equal numbers of men and women working in the lower levels of the call center industry, scholars analyze gendered dynamics of call center work because of the association of call center work tasks with femininity and feminine traits such as hospitality and empathy. There are also fewer job opportunities for women (see also: gender inequality in India) and the wages of call center jobs are higher relative to other jobs that are open to women. Women in call center work are more likely to consider their jobs as permanent, or as their permanent employment until they marry, whereas men typically view their call center jobs as temporary. There have been many scholars that have studied the gendered impacts of call center work on Indian women. Some of these researchers have claimed that there are ways in which call center work subverts gendered expectations of Indian womanhood, and can thus be in some ways liberating. Many of these scholars point to the opportunity for financial gain or independence. They have also taken into consideration the workplaces themselves as environments where gender norms are subverted, though these environments are still hierarchical with men still more commonly holding leadership positions. Singh and Pandey in their research on the impact of call center work on the health of female call center workers in India found that many young women suffered from ailments such as indigestion, eye strain, headache, and sleep disorder due to the abnormal hours call center work entails. To adjust to the hours, many workers turned to and subsequently became addicted to caffeine and cigarettes. Various researchers describe the stigma that Indian women experience when they work at night as call center work requires. Being outside of the house at night is not considered respectable for single young Indian women, and thus challenges gendered expectations. Because of this the reputations of young women working in call centers are called into question, which in turn can prevent their families from making any gain in status from their employment. Media portrayals Indian call centres have been the focus of several documentary films, the 2004 film Thomas L. Friedman Reporting: The Other Side of Outsourcing, the 2005 films John and Jane, Nalini by Day, Nancy by Night, and 1-800-India: Importing a White-Collar Economy, and the 2006 film Bombay Calling, among others. An Indian call centre is also the subject of the 2006 film Outsourced and a key location in the 2008 film, Slumdog Millionaire. Chetan Bhagat's bestselling book One Night @ the Call Center is based on call centre employees.

During the Second World War he did not reach the fighting front until May 8, 1942, when he was appointed as chief of staff of the 75th Fortified Region in Voronezh Front. On July 26 this unit was converted to the second formation of the 305th Rifle Division, where he first served as deputy commander until May 2, 1943, when he replaced Col. Ivan Antinovich Danilovich as division commander. Concurrently with this, Vasilev was promoted to the rank of colonel. At this time the division was in the newly-formed 69th Army in preparation for the Battle of Kursk. Vasilev would remain in command of the 305th for the duration of the war with Germany.Valeriy Zamulin, The Forgotten Battle of the Kursk Salient, Helion & Co. Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2017, p. 411 Col. A.

At the time, Colonel Sereda of the political department of 69th Army noted as follows: After the German offensive was halted the Red Army began its counter-offensive, Operation Rumyantsev, on August 3. Two days later the 305th distinguished itself in being the first unit to break into the western outskirts of Belgorod, mopping up the city over the next 24 hours with the assistance of the 89th Guards Rifle Division attacking from the east. For this accomplishment the division was awarded the honorific \\"Belgorod\\".

He was a \\"newspaper correspondent, world traveler, adventure-seeker, avid reader, and member of the French Foreign Legion.\\" Early life Farnsworth was born on August 7, 1890, in Dedham, Massachusetts. He attended Groton School and then Harvard College where he was graduated in 1912. After graduating, he toured Vienna, Budapest, Constantinople, Odessa, Moscow, and St. Petersburg. Family Farnsworth came from a Boston Brahmin family. His parents, William and Lucy Holman (n√©e Burgess) Farnsworth, also had a daughter, Ellen Holman Farnsworth, who was said to be \\"the prettiest girl in Boston.\\" Henry and Ellen were very close. Ellen was married to Alfred Lee Loomis, Henry's classmate at Harvard University. Ellen's great-grandson, Reed Hastings, was a co-founder of Netflix. He was described as \\"bookish and idealistic.\\" The Farnsworths had homes on Westfield Street in Dedham and Beacon Street in Boston. The family purchased the Beacon Street home from Charles Winslow. Career Farnsworth worked as a reporter for Collier's and The Providence Journal during the Balkan War. He was working as a reporter in Mexico when US troops occupied Veracruz in 1914 and when World War I began. He wrote a book about his experiences in the Balkans, The Log of a Would-be War Correspondent as well as several plays and five volumes of short stories. His letters were also posthumously published by his father. After returning home, he worked for his father, a wool merchant in Boston. World War I In the fall of 1914, Farnsworth sailed back from the United States to Europe before his family could object. He \\"got caught up in the military fever that was sweeping London and Paris.\\" Preferring to fight, he refused to be a war correspondent. Farnsworth enlisted with the French Foreign Legion on January 5, 1915, and served in several battles. He was hospitalized several times, but always showed an eagerness to return to the front. He often served the night patrol in no man's land. On one such occasion, after Italy declared war against the Central Powers, Farnsworth was part of a group who put newspapers on the barbed wire near the German trenches. On March 15, 1915, he wrote to his mother: ‚ÄúI long to be with you all again, once the war ends. I think it will be this summer some time; then for the rest and peace of Dedham.‚Äù Farnsworth was killed in action at the battle of Fortin de Navarin near Tahure, France, on September 28, 1915, in the Second Battle of Champagne. He was shot in the neck and the spine by a machine gun. Sukuna, a Fijian comrade, pulled Farnsworth into a trench but was unable to save him. After watching Farnsworth die, Sukuna vowed to avenge his death, advanced towards the German line, and was shot in the leg. Farnsworth was one of 642 men from Dedham who served in the war, and one of 18 who died. After his death, those with whom he served spoke of his spirit and bravery. He was posthumously awarded the M√©daille militaire on October 1, 1915. Legacy At Harvard's Lamont Library, the Farnsworth Room is dedicated in Farnsworth's honor. The room, which is \\"devoted to non-curricular leisure reading, houses approximately 4,000 eclectic titles.\\" It \\"is a treasure trove of bizarre finds.\\" Originally opened in Widener Library in 1916, and moved to Lamont upon the latter's opening in 1949, it was the first American college reading room dedicated to extracurricular reading. Alumnus Thomas Wolfe says he learned more in the Farnsworth Room than anywhere else at Harvard. In 1920, Farnsworth's family erected a monument to him and the 130 Foreign Legionnaires from the 1st and 2nd R√©giment Etrangers who died in the Battle of Champagne in Souain-Perthes- l√®s-Hurlus. It is an ossuary and holds the remains of the 130 Legionnaires. The stones for the monument came from the same quarry as those that form the Arc de Triomphe. The monument, which was designed by Alexandre Marcel, measures by , with the entrance on the north. Due to the poor soil quality in Champagne, fertile soil from Seine-et-Marne was trucked in to plant fir and pine trees, as well as a thick hedge. An inscription on the memorial was written by Charles W. Eliot, and another contains the names of the men buried in it. It was dedicated on November 3, 1920 by Joseph-Marie Tissier, bishop of Ch√¢lons. Present at the dedication were Farnsworth's parents, sister, Pierre- Georges Duport, and representatives of the French government. Darius Milhaud gave a speech. It is known today as the \\"American Monument\\" by the residents of Souain. Rue Henry Farnsworth in Souain was named for Farnsworth at a ceremony in September 1965 that was attended by Ellen.

It was caused by incursions of IMU militants into Uzbek and Kyrgyz territory from Tajikistan and was in part, centered on the unilateral demarcation of the Kyrgyzstan‚ÄìUzbekistan border by Uzbekistan. Background In February 1999, the Uzbek capital of Tashkent experienced a series of explosions in an attempt on President Islam Karimov's life, who then blamed it on radical Wahhabi Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan militants. According to the militants, their goal was to facilitate an overthrow of the Uzbek government and President Karimov, after which the establishment of an Islamic State in Uzbekistan would follow. Events In the summer of that year, IMU guerrilla rebels invaded the Batken Region of Kyrgyzstan (a region with an ethnically Uzbek majority). It was the IMU's first verifiable operation since it was established just a year before. Specifically, the city of Barak, Kyrgyzstan was occupied by militant forces, with the surrounding area being controlled and blockaded by Uzbek forces. During the intrusion, the rebels took several people hostage, including a Japanese geologists, who was eventually returned after the Japanese government paid a ransom. The rebels demanded that Kyrgyzstan provide safe passage for them to cross into Uzbekistan. On eighth day of the conflict, Mayor Abdrakhman Mamataliev of Osh along with 3 security officers were captured by militants in order to send a message to the Bishkek authorities. They were in captivity for over a week until they were released on 13 August as a result of extensive negotiations and the extortion of a ransom, which included an Afghanistan-bound helicopter.https://iwpr.net/global- voices/batken-conflict-returns On 24 August, defense minister Myrzakan Subanov was dismissed from his post after Akayev and his government observed what his spokesman called a failure to \\"stabilize the situation.\\" Just four days later, Akayev appointed Major General Esen Topoev, a native of the Batken, as minister of defense. On 1 September, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and Kyrgyz Deputy Prime Minister Boris Silaev met to discuss Russia formally providing technical assistance to the Kyrgyz Army in eliminating the militants. The government spent the next month concentrating their operations on the IMU militants throughout the mountains, utilizing air strikes and artillery shelling to help aide their advance. By 25 September, the Batken region was completely stripped of militants, with some retreating to Tajikistan. The government then arrested over 70 civilians in Bishkek who were suspected of having links with the IMU terrorists. The Kyrgyz and Uzbek governments agreed to confine the rebels in the mountains during the winter, in an attempt to ensure the disablement of the invading forces. Aftermath Following the conclusion of the conflict, the Uzbek government began the process of sealing its border Kyrgyzstan, enacting measures such as constructing a barbed wire fence and creating a 2-meter fence throughout 1999 and 2000. The Uzbek government also hinted at a military intervention in the country, with defense minister Hikmatulla Tursunov declaring that the Uzbek Armed Forces stand ready to launch attacks on rebel sanctuaries in both ‚Äúnearby‚Äù and ‚Äúother places‚Äù. The conflict was a key factor in political debates between the government of Amangeldy Muraliyev and opposition, eventually incorporating itself into that year's parliamentary and presidential elections. The Batken Region was created as a response to IMU activities. Kyrgyzstan accused Uzbekistan of using the conflict to seize large areas of agricultural land that was loaned to Uzbekistan during the Soviet period for temporary usage.Megoran (2004), op. cit., p 733-734. The conflict also had a major impact on the international community, who collectively put pressure on Tajikistan to expel the IMU from the country, specifically the Tavildara Valley where it is based. The IMU eventually abandoned the valley in late 1999 after persuasion from the Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan (IRPT).

The fifteenth named storm, ninth hurricane, and sixth major hurricane of the 2018 Pacific hurricane season, Olivia formed southwest of Mexico on September 1. The depression slowly organized and strengthened into Tropical Storm Olivia on the next day. Olivia then began a period of rapid intensification on September 3, reaching its initial peak on September 5. Soon after, Olivia began a weakening trend, before re- intensifying on September 6. On the next day, Olivia peaked as a Category 4 hurricane, with winds of 130 mph (215 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 951 mbar (28.08 inHg). Six hours later, Olivia began another weakening trend that resulted in the hurricane being downgraded to Category 1 status on September 8, east of the 140th meridian west. On September 9, Olivia entered the Central Pacific Basin. Over the next couple of days, Olivia prompted the issuance of Tropical Storm Watches and Warnings for Hawaii County, Oahu, Maui County, and Kauai County. Olivia weakened into a tropical storm on September 11, before making brief landfalls in northwest Maui and Lanai on the next day, becoming the first tropical cyclone to impact the islands in recorded history. Tropical storm-force winds mainly affected Maui County and Oahu. Torrential rains affected the same area from September 11 to 13, causing flash flooding. Olivia caused a total of US$25 million in damages. Olivia was downgraded to a tropical depression on September 13 while continuing to head west. Due to wind shear disrupting Olivia's convection, the system weakened into a remnant low on September 14. Olivia crossed into the West Pacific Basin on September 19 as a remnant low, before dissipating later that day. Meteorological history Olivia originated from a disturbance that formed over the southwest Caribbean Sea on August 26. The disturbance tracked westward and crossed over Central America, where it entered the Northeastern Pacific Ocean a few days later. A broad area of low pressure formed several hundred miles southwest of Mexico on August 30. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) continued to monitor the disturbance as it moved west-northwest for the next couple of days and gradually became more organized. At 00:00 UTC on September 1, the NHC declared that the low had become Tropical Depression Seventeen-E approximately 425 miles (680 km) southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. Initially, due to north- northeasterly vertical wind shear, the nascent depression only strengthened slowly. The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Olivia on September 2, after obtaining gale-force sustained winds For the next several days, the system would travel west to west-northwest under the influence of a subtropical ridge that extended from central Mexico across the eastern Pacific. Over the next day or two Olivia changed little in strength as wind shear continued to impinge on the system. Late on September 3, however, a central dense overcast developed over Olivia's center of circulation and an inner core began to form, preceding a period of rapid intensification. By 00:00 UTC on September 4, Olivia had strengthened into a hurricane, and reached Category 2 status on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale twelve hours later. At 18:00 UTC on September 4, Olivia reached Category 3 status and thus became the sixth major hurricane of the season. Six hours later, Olivia reached its initial peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph (195 km/h). Shortly after, however, Olivia began a weakening trend, falling below Category 3 status at 12:00 UTC on September 5. Eventually, Olivia bottomed out as a low-end Category 2 hurricane, before beginning to re-intensify on September 6. Olivia regained major hurricane status by 12:00 UTC that day, and peaked as a Category 4 hurricane at 00:00 UTC on September 7, with winds of 130 mph (215 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 951 mbar (hPa; 28.08 inHg). At that time, the NHC noted that Olivia was \\"an outstanding example of an annular hurricane\\", with a sharp eye surrounded by a single ring of intense convection. Six hours later, Olivia began another weakening trend as sea surface temperatures decreased and cloud tops around the eye warmed. By 06:00 UTC on September 8, Olivia had weakened to a Category 1 hurricane. At 03:00 UTC on September 9, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) took over the responsibility of monitoring and issuing advisories on Olivia after the hurricane crossed the 140th meridian west and entered the central Pacific. Infrared satellite loop of Olivia making landfall in Maui and Lanai on September 12 Early on September 11, Olivia weakened to a tropical storm, after encountering strong wind shear. Late on the same day, Olivia's low level circulation center separated from the deep convection, resulting in a significant increase in forward speed. Olivia rapidly weakened as it approached Hawaii, before making brief landfalls over Maui and Lanai, the first such instance in recorded history, on September 12, at 19:10 UTC and 19:54 UTC respectively, with sustained winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). At 09:00 UTC on September 13, as Olivia was pulling away from Hawaii, the system weakened into a tropical depression. After wind shear continually disrupted Olivia's convection, the system degenerated into a post-tropical remnant low on September 14. On September 19, Olivia's remnant low crossed the International Date Line, entering the West Pacific Basin. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) stated that there was a possibility of redevelopment. Soon afterward, Olivia quickly lost all of its convection and dissipated, due to wind shear. Preparations and impact Hawaii National Guard delivering supporting material in advance of Hurricane Olivia On September 10, in anticipation of Olivia's landfall in Hawaii, tropical storm watches were issued for Hawaii County, Oahu, and Maui County including the islands of Maui, Molokai, Lanai, and Kahoolawe. At 15:00 UTC, the tropical storm watches for Hawaii County and Maui were changed to tropical storm warnings. At 03:00 UTC on September 11, the watch for Oahu was changed to a tropical storm warning. Additionally, tropical storm watches were issued for Kauai County including the islands of Kauai and Niihau due to the uncertainty of the track. At 21:00 UTC the watches for Kauai and Niihau were changed to tropical storm warnings after the track shifted northward. At 09:00 UTC on September 12, as the path of Olivia became clearer, the warnings for Kauai and Niihau were discontinued. On September 9, Governor David Ige signed an emergency proclamation declaring the counties of Hawaii, Maui, Kalawao, Kauai, and Honolulu as disaster areas. On September 12, all public schools and post offices were closed in Maui with numerous schools and universities closed elsewhere. Olivia was the second tropical cyclone to affect Hawaii in 2018, with Hurricane Lane having affected the state a few weeks earlier. Tropical storm-force winds mainly affected Maui County and Oahu. Peak winds of were observed in Lanai Airport, and peak winds of were observed in Kuaokala. Many trees were downed and numerous power outages occurred in Maui. Widespread rains in Maui County and Oahu from September 11-13 caused numerous instances of flash flooding, with the worst felt in areas along the slopes of the West Maui Mountains. Brief road closures occurred in Oahu on the night of September 12 as a result of the flash floods. In Maui County, rainfall totals reached a maximum of in West Wailuaiki, while on Oahu, rainfall totals peaked at at the Lyon Arboretum in Manoa. In Honolulu, the water level of a dam rose by about 4 to 5 feet after heavy rainfall from Olivia affected the area, prompting officials to consider evacuations. Additionally, a sewage pipe overflowed, sending over 30,000 gallons (113,562 L) of raw sewage into Kapalama Stream and Honolulu Harbor. Overall, Olivia caused a total of US$25 million in damages.

Her record of four All-Ireland titles with four teams based in three provinces across two sports has made her a much sought after figure within sporting circles. Early life Currid is a native of the village of Grange, County Sligo. Having worked in banking, she sustained a cruciate ligament injury in 2005. It was then her interest in sports psychology began as a means to bring about her own recovery from injury. She quit banking and studied for a psychology degree via the Open University and went on to study for a master's degree in sports psychology at the University of Jordanstown. With the Sligo football team, Currid won an All-Ireland Junior Ladies' Football Championship medal in 2006. She had lost the two previous finals. Career Currid began her involvement as a sports psychologist at inter-county level within the GAA by making an advance towards Tyrone manager Mickey Harte in 2007; he agreed and Currid was brought aboard. Currid worked with rugby union player Paul O'Connell from 2008 until he retired in 2016; though initially not accepting of her ideas when she drove to Limerick to meet him in August 2008 O'Connell remained aware of her work with Tyrone and telephoned her after watching their 2008 All-Ireland victory the following month to inform her that he had changed his mind and wished to work with her. Thus began a run that would lead to Currid working with four All-Ireland winning teams in the Gaelic games of football and hurling; these are as follows: the Tyrone county football team that won an All-Ireland Senior Football Championship in 2008, the Tipperary county hurling team that won an All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship in 2010, the Dublin county football team that won an All-Ireland Senior Football Championship in 2011 and the Limerick county hurling team that won an All- Ireland Senior Hurling Championship in 2018. The Tyrone team overcame a Kerry team that was favourite to achieve a three-in-a-row, the Tipperary hurling team had not won a senior All-Ireland for nine years, the Dublin football team had not won a senior All-Ireland for sixteen years, while the Limerick hurling team had not won a senior All-Ireland for forty-five years. The Tipperary and Dublin All-Ireland victories came in the second year of her involvement with the teams. When the Limerick hurling team bridged a forty-five year gap to win a senior All-Ireland title in 2018, team captain Declan Hannon directly referred to Currid in his victory speech, declaring: \\"She has just been phenomenal with us for the last two years. She has always been there for us, always there to keep us up and pick us up when we are down. She's after inheriting 36 new babies!\\" Match analyst Liam Sheedy, whose Tipperary hurling team had been assisted by Currid to an All-Ireland title eight years previously also took the opportunity to bestow praise upon Currid, saying: \\"She deserves massive credit, that is four times now! Tyrone, Dublin, ourselves and Limerick. I do think the Limerick teams over the years didn't have the inner belief but they went behind to Kilkenny, went behind to Cork. There is no doubt about it, she has worked on their inner strengths. Their mindset today was 'we are coming up here to play!'\\" Also in 2011, Currid worked with Cork's first-time hurling champions Carrigtwohill and Galway Senior Football Championship finalists Tuam. Currid also worked with David Rudisha, the 800 metres runner from Kenya, before his victory and world record at the 2012 London Olympics, focusing on how to maximise performance on competition day.http://www.kotinospartners.com/about/our-team-and- partnershttp://botswanaunplugged.com/10674/i-wont-return-home-soon-nijel-amos/ She was struck by the way the Kenyan athletes lived in the moment, which gave a high level of clarity to their performance.https://www.accreate.com/insights/entry/ireland-vs-all-blacks-who- will-be-the-victor References 1980s births Living people Alumni of the Open University Alumni of Ulster University Dublin county football team Limerick county hurling team Sports psychologists Sportspeople from County Sligo Tipperary county hurling team Tyrone county football team ","title":"Caroline Currid"},{"id":"58396304","text":"The 2018‚Äì19 Central Connecticut Blue Devils women's basketball team represented Central Connecticut State University during the 2018‚Äì19 NCAA Division I women's basketball season.

It exists when the process that supports a business activity lacks both efficiency and effectiveness, which may then lead to financial, customer, and reputational loss. This form of risk may be present within any stage of a business transactions. For instance, an error in pricing may be seen as loss in sales revenue, while a disruption in the fulfillment process may cause financial losses in terms of production quality and customer relationships. The majority of operational risk events occur due to losses from ineffective processing of business transactions or process management, and from inadequate relations with trade counter parties and vendors.  Definition  Process risk is a loss in revenue as a result of ineffective and/or inefficient processes. Ineffective processes hamper the achievement of the organization's objectives, whereas the processes that are inefficient, may be successful in achieving objectives, yet fail to consider high costs incurred.  Forms of Process Risk  = Process Risk in fulfillment = * The process risk in fulfillment is negatively related to the supply chain performance. That means a fulfillment problem may cause a loss of customers to the company. For example, a company that lacks sound manufacturing processes may not efficiently fulfill customer orders which may undermine the performance of the business. Any disruptions in the production process should be treated as a threat to the company's relationship with current and potential customers. Thus, an increase in process risk is associated with a decrease in the supply chain performance. = Process Risk in documentations = * The risk of loss due to erroneous documentation processes is especially common within the banking industry. For instance, banks generate a mass amount of documentations. Any informational error or inaccurate input of data within the documents may overall weaken the effectiveness of financial contracts, and this form of risk may also overlap other risk, such as legal risk.  Mitigate Process Risk  It is difficult to eliminate all process risk due to the high dependency on complex environments and the high input of human resources. Certain business practices applied to its processes, such as standardization, is an example of how to minimize operational risk. Furthermore, information systems aid in gathering information about process risk events. Event logs is one approach to mitigate process risk. The use of events logs can help risk managers oversee and evaluate a consolidated database with all associated process risk. This approach does not completely eliminate process risk, yet it is a tool for the evaluation of the overall risk exposure so that the company may be able track and manage the risk linked to the overall business processes. Another possible approach would be to implement a collaborative approach within the operational processes of a business. In other words, the process risk in the supply chain may be mitigated through collaboration. For example, the use of this approach is said to help establish a strong communication channel throughout the supply chain. The objective is to reduce process risk by directly working with suppliers. The desired outcome would be to improve quality and communication between all parties involved in the supply chain, which then reduces the risk of losing customers. In addition, the establishment of a measurement framework may be used to improve the management of process risk. The framework should function as the means to identify and control process risk. These measures include, and are not limited to, adding internal processing controls on all business transactions, and increasing training and development to improve quality control.

Craig is a professor emerita of molecular biology and genetics at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Her research focuses on the molecular mechanisms of transposable elements, or mobile sequences of DNA found in the genomes of most known organisms. Education Craig was raised in Concord, Calif., graduated from Concord High School and attended Bryn Mawr College, a women's college, as an undergraduate. She later described the environment as \\"empowering\\" due to lack of female role models elsewhere in science. After graduating in 1973 summa cum laude with an A.B. in biology and chemistry, Craig attended graduate school at Cornell University, where she studied the chemistry of DNA repair and the mechanisms of the cellular SOS response to DNA damage. She was particularly intrigued by the life cycle of the lambda phage, a virus that infects bacteria and is capable of integrating its genome into that of the host cell. Craig received her Ph.D. in 1980 and then joined the laboratory of Howard Nash at the National Institutes of Health as a postdoctoral fellow, where she continued to study lambda phage genome integration. Academic career Craig joined the faculty at University of California, San Francisco in 1984. She focused her research group's early work on developing in vitro systems for studying the transposon Tn7, and later cited the success of this effort as one of her career highlights. In 1992, Craig moved her laboratory from UCSF to Johns Hopkins University, where she has remained since. Craig was a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator from 1991 to 2015. She was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2010. Research interests Throughout her career, Craig has focused her research interests on transposable elements, or sequences of DNA that can change position in a genome; such elements are found in the genomes of nearly all known organisms and gave rise to a large fraction of the human genome. In addition to the unusually specific transposon Tn7, her group also studies families of transposons known as hAT transposons and piggyBac.

In the Second Macedonian War, Livy mentions that it was one of the cities devastated by Philip V of Macedon the year 198 BCE, together with Iresiae, Euhydrium, Eretria and Palaepharsalus, since he foresaw that the territory would soon fall into the hands of the Aetolian League and the Romans. Philip allowed the men who were able to follow him, but they were compelled to quit their homes and the towns were burnt. All the property they could carry with them they were allowed to take away, the rest became the booty for the soldiers. The town was occupied by the Roman praetor Marcus Baebius Tamphilus in the war with Antiochus III in 191 BCE.

Childhood writing is often told from either the perspective of the child or that of an adult reflecting on their childhood. Novels either based on or depicting childhood present social commentaries rooted in the views and experiences of an individual. Childhood literature often offers moral imperative for the reader to combine social codes with entertainment.  History  Following the publication of French historian Philippe Ari√®s' work Centuries of Childhood in 1960 (translated to English in 1962), the notion of childhood has been an active topic for social debate. In his work, Ari√®s argues that the notion of childhood is a recent development. He cites a range of historical media, including paintings and records. Though the social concept of childhood as a distinct phase of human life originates from the 16th century, the social perceptions of childhood have changed markedly in art, literature, and philosophy. Considering the long history of ideologies regarding children, the distinct recognition of childhood was revolutionary. Scholar Nicholas Orme presents a contrasting thesis to Ari√®s. He cites a variety of \\"literary, documentary, pictorial and archaeological sources\\" to propose that childhood and children's culture appear during the Middles Ages in England. The evidence of distinct responsibilities for youth during the Middle Ages differentiates children from adults and demonstrates the burgeoning distinction between adolescence and maturity. The early separation of childhood and adulthood in the Middle Ages mirrors other dichotomies prevalent in society (e.g, men and women, or slaves and masters). In the 17th century, John Locke's writings were of considerable influence on the evolving notions of childhood, particularly concerning the development and education of youth. One of the central ideas of Locke's works is the concept that, upon birth, children possess no innate qualities and instead acquire attributes based upon the environment of their upbringing. As an educator of wealthy children, Locke ceded the role of birth order and social status in the personalities of children, with the resultant disparities between affluent and poor youth necessitating a multitude of educational needs that are sensitive to the individual child. As such, pedagogical practices around this period evolved based upon tenets within Locke's writings. Moreover, social perspectives grew to view children as rational, and acknowledgement of childhood intelligence spread throughout public consciousness. The Age of Enlightenment in the 18th century saw a surge in philosophical writings that dominated European discourse. Philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote extensively on the concept of childhood and education, notably in his treatise Emile, or On Education, and was influential in notions of humanity's progress and development. Rousseau's works depict him as a proponent for natural education that is contingent on inclination rather than social structures and enforced habits, seeking to get rid of the tension between \\"nature and society\\". Pedagogical practices of the time were greatly impacted by his criticism of traditional educational processes that rejected natural predispositions and his support for emotional guidance for children alongside the conventional intellectual tutelage. Children's literature, alongside its depictions of childhood, was pioneered by several authors throughout the mid- eighteenth century and primarily included \\"what would come to be known, towards the end of the century, as 'moral tales.  Definition  A nonacademic definition of childhood is provided by UNICEF wherein childhood is \\"a precious time in which children should live free from fear, safe from violence and protected from abuse and exploitation\\". They also state that \\"Childhood means much more than just the space between birth and the attainment of adulthood\\", and is instead the situation of early formative years, particularly regarding the quality of an adolescent's life, and emphasizes the significance of this period in emotional development and education. With much cultural variation, childhood is viewed as the period of youth up until around age 16, with the notion of being a child carrying a variety of parliamentary and legal connotations, or is seen as closely related to progression through schooling and the completion of a secondary education. Constructions of childhood within literature are used to explore the ways in which strange stimuli develop into familiarity throughout adolescence, manipulating that which is considered ordinary, as well as unusual phenomena. Childhood is moreover used by authors as a personal process through which an individual relocates the lost self by highlighting a distance between childhood in the past and the reality of adulthood. Within academia, however, childhood is understood to be an abstract concept, with depictions within literature not being standardized and thus having varied definitions based on cultural influence. Early definitions of childhood see adolescents being treated as \\"miniature\\" adults. Childhood is often coupled with connotations of incompleteness and imperfection, both of which are supposedly achieved through a transition into adulthood, and thus children are socially obligated to partake in educational practices.  The orphan child  The orphan archetype is common throughout literary works, particularly in children's literature dating from the 19th and 20th centuries, and has roots within folktales and lore across a variety of cultures. The orphan child is often written to be isolated, ultimately a character out of place in a trial-filled world through which they must navigate. An illustration of Oliver Twist, a famous example of an orphan within literature. One explanation of the common appearance of orphans in literature is that it reflects the high death rates of earlier centuries and that this mortality rate met at a conjuncture in time with the growth of children's literature to produce a large number of orphan protagonists. English and creative writing professor Laura Peters posits that, during the Victorian age, cultural systems and social constructions became reorganized to place the notion of family as a \\"building block\\" around which society was framed. As such, a variety of authors were drawn to writing on the topic of orphan-hood, as these parent-less children were on the outside of this newly fundamental social structure, thus constituting the potential for interesting and complex depictions of childhood. Orphans within literature symbolize, on a whole, detachment from both other people and the most fundamental social unit of a family; they are \\"the eternal Other\\" and categorized as outsiders seeking (or avoiding) incorporation into regular society. Although orphan children are often depicted as solitary and lonely, as to construct an empathetic character, many portrayals are also written with special powers they must use in order to achieve eventual social inclusion and happiness; in Harry Potter, the titular protagonist is an orphan oppressed by his relatives and social expectation whilst also being the \\"chosen one\\" tasked with combating the great evil within the series. The loss of an orphan's parents within literature is often depicted as a motivational trauma by which they are propelled to pursue their goal.  Coverage in scholarship  Large amounts of academic writing on childhood are based upon the works of philosophers and historians such as John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Philippe Ari√®s. The work of the lattermost scholar, Centuries of Childhood, is a widely cited text within spheres of child and literary studies, with scholars often discussing the ramifications of the distinctive separation of childhood and adulthood, or altogether rejecting Ari√®s' thesis. Ari√®s' proposition about the history of childhood has been rejected by some scholars on the basis that the idea was too quickly accepted into academic study without being comprehensively scrutinized and tested, thus becoming \\"dogma by dint of repetition\\". Instead of the brutal child-rearing practices and a supposed indifference parents felt toward children prior to the 16th century, scholar Stephen Wilson writes that children in pre-modern societies such as China, South India, and Europe were often nurtured during upbringing and grieved over upon death and were furthermore treated in a distinct fashion compared to adults. Further criticisms contend that Centuries of Childhood conflates the absence of a modern understanding of childhood with an overall lack of awareness in pre-16th century societies, with Ari√®s' \\"present- centeredness\\" disabling proper historiographical analysis, rendering his thesis logically flawed. The use of artwork to qualitatively infer the beginning of notions of childhood has also motivated scholars to criticize Ari√®s' thesis; the assumption that illustrations explicitly depict the realities of life ignores the \\"possibility of any ambiguity\\", and further neglects of experiences of poorer civilians who did not have the means to commission such artwork. One of the most notable ideas regarding childhood and child development, originally formulated by John Locke in his 1690 work An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, is the notion of tabula rasa, which refers to the mind of a child as a \\"blank slate\\", having no preconceived ideologies, thoughts or knowledge at birth; thus, children are free to be molded as a part of their cultural surroundings and are a result of their respective situations and environments throughout development. This idea that children receive beliefs and knowledge from external stimuli distinguishes instinctual actions and faculties from understanding that is received through education and deliberate tutelage. Although he postulates that there is nothing intrinsic to the mind of a children upon birth, Locke also highlights the \\"natural inclinations\\" of children, such as their personalities, that should be paid attention to when nurturing and molding a developing youth. Within early discussions regarding childhood, the notion of a child's rationality was a point of contention. While John Locke was a proponent of the notion that children's intellect should be viewed with a degree of respect, Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote that \\"Childhood is reason's sleep\\", and that proper judgement and moral codes are lost on youth before they have reached the \\"age of reason\\". Contemporary discourse heavily features the latter concept, explicating that children are incapable of the standards of rational sense and sociality that accompany maturity, and their true intellectual potential and cognitive powers are only unlocked after the transition into a \\"mature adult\\".
