During rush hour, a tram broke down and the driver of a third tram failed to stop, hitting a second tram that had stopped. This was one of the two tram accidents that took place in Bucharest in the same year. Later on 18 July 2012, another less-serious accident took place in at the Rahova-Ferentari intersection. Background Lujerului Underpass area in the winter of 2005-2006. The accident happened below the square in this photo. =The tram line= The tram line 41 is one of the most important and most busy tram lines in Bucharest. It began operation in 1984 and was completed in 1987, and was finally converted to a light rail line in 2002. Starting from Ghencea and going through Drumul Taberei, Militari, Cr√¢nga»ôi, Domenii towards Casa Presei Libere, the important corridor serves people who go to the North of the city for work or people who often visit important markets along the line. Due to its status, trams often have to follow tight schedules, going at an average speed of 40 km/h (maximum allowed speeds are 55 km/h, in the underpass the limit would normally be 30 km/h), and during rush hour there is one tram per two minutes. When circulation on the line is disrupted due to various reasons, a replacement line (641) is made on the same route, using buses, which was the case after the crash, however it has a lower efficiency due to the traffic on the route, compared to the 41, which is (almost) fully grade-separated. =The trams= Line 41 of the tram network in Bucharest uses the V3A of the Bucharest Articulated Tramcar family, like most tram routes in the city. Served by the Bucure»ôtii-Noi and Alexandria depots, it uses the 1993, FAUR, CH-PPC and M2000 variants. The last one was specifically made for the line - a subtype of the 1993 model, it features high-speed pantographs, plastic bumpers, round headlights and various other modifications for the line, being used mostly on line 41. Sometimes it is also used by lines 20 (suspended as of 2019), 24, 42 and 45, served by the Bucure»ôtii-Noi depot where they are stabled. * 110 was made in 1976 as a V3A-71 tram, and modernized in 1997 to a V3A-93 tram. At the time of the accident it had a RT1 (every 5000 km) revision on 30 April 2012, and with the last major repair in 2004. * 300 was made in 1980 as a V3A-71 tram, and modernized in 2002 to a V3A-93 tram, subtype M2000. At the time of the accident it had a RT1 revision on 4 May 2012, and was released from its last major repair on 2 April 2012. * 296 was made in 1980 as a V3A-71 tram, and modernized in 1999 to a V3A-93 tram. At the time of the accident it had a RT2 (every 20.000 km) revision on 8 May 2012, and with the last major repair in 2004. All trams belonged to the Bucure»ôtii-Noi depot, 110 has been since transferred to the Dude»ôti depot. Sequence of events The accident took place at the beginning of the rush hour. Sometime between 7:05 and 7:08 in the morning, tram 110, heading from Ghencea to Casa Presei Libere left the \\"Bulevardul Timi»ôoara\\" stop in Drumul Taberei. Heading into the Lujerului Underpass, it suffered a failure and was forced to stop in the underpass. At 7:09, tram 300 approached the overpass and the driver noticed 110 stopped near the exit and approached the broken down tram carefully, before stopping behind it. Passengers in both of the trams remained inside, despite the nearby avenue being lightly circulated at the time, as the policy of the RATB states that \\"when a vehicle is declared officially broken down, only then the passengers can leave it and board other vehicles\\". Even so, the walk to the nearest stop (which is beyond the underpass) would take place in rather unsuitable conditions, since there are only roadways and the concrete-foundations tram track in the middle. One minute later, tram 296 left Drumul Taberei heading towards Casa Presei Libere, and entered the underpass at 7:11 at 50 km/h. The driver was able to notice 300 in front of him, but he was not able to brake in time to stop behind it, and slammed into it at 7:11:09 AM. The impact resulted in the last carriage of 300 and the first carriage of 296 ending up with bent frames, and shattered windows. The rear end of 300 (where the shunting controls are located) was destroyed and pushed inside, whilst the front of 296 was crushed and the destination display fell from its hinges. The impact was so strong it derailed the two trams involved in the crash and pushed 300 into the back of 110, damaging its rear lights and causing a few dents to its last carriage, even leaving a square mark from a bumper from the front of 300. Remarkably, the windows on the doors were not shattered. A fourth tram, 218, managed to stop in time, before the wreckage, in the tunnel. As the incident took place during rush hour, the people, packed inside the trams were thrown around and injured from hitting various objects (handrails, hard seats, the floor) and glass shards. The final figure of the crash stood at 92 injured, with 23 seriously injured, among them 3 of them treated for brain trauma, requiring surgery. At the University Hospital of Bucharest alone, there were 34 injured. Aftermath Shortly after the accident, chaos ensued. Initially people attempted to escape through the shattered windows, and a few seconds later the doors opened by themselves, meaning that the driver and tram could still operate some controls. Minutes later all traffic grounc to a halt. Roughly half an hour later, emergency vehicles showed up and a bus line was introduced. By 13:15, the line was cleared and at 14:00 the tram line resumed its operation. The driver of the third tram was arrested by the Romanian Police, during questioning he pleaded guilty to bodily harm charges, however he was released due to the lack of criminal charges against him. During his arrest he said that he was guilty of the accident, but he could do nothing to prevent it. Tram 110 was the first one to be put back into service after the investigation of the crash, due to its small amount of damage. Trams 296 and 300 were out of order for months after the investigation was completed, but all returned to service by April 2013. As of April 2019, they are still active in the STB (former RATB) roster.

It is a type of ginataan. Description Ginataang labong is prepared by first boiling the julienned or thinly-sliced bamboo shoots until tender. For pre-boiled bamboo shoots, they are simply soaked for an hour before using to remove the sliminess. Garlic, onions, and ginger are then sauteed on a pan. Coconut milk is then added with the bamboo shoots, secondary ingredients (usually shrimp, fish, pork, or crab), along with the rest of the spices (like chilis, fish sauce, or lemongrass). Other vegetables can also be added, including jute mallow, chili pepper leaves, carrots, and tomatoes. It is served with white rice. A vegetarian or vegan version of the dish can easily be created by replacing the seafood or meat with tofu. Variants Ginataang ubod is a variant of the dish where heart of palm is used instead of bamboo shoots. It is otherwise prepared identically.

The property is located immediately south of Wacker Drive and immediately west of Lake Shore Drive with potential addresses of 475 East Wacker Drive and 300 North Lake Shore Drive. The property, which was approved as part of a Lakeshore East masterplan with a height, has a storied history. Previous to this urban development, the Lakeshore East area had been used by Illinois Central Railroad yards. In 1993 under the eye of planning commissioner Valerie Jarrett, a par 3 9-hole golf course and driving range was announced for the intersection of Wacker and Lake Shore Drive as an interim development. Pete Dye designed the course, known as Metro Golf at Illinois Center, which was completed in 1994 and closed in 2001. The area was originally planned for development as part of the Illinois Center in 1970, and one of the challenges to the new development was to integrate itself into the inherited triple-level street system while creating a visually appealing and pedestrian friendly neighborhood. The solution was to stagger ground-level amenities and building entrances from the upper level at the perimeter to the lower level at the interior. Thus the multilevel street grid is utilized around the edges, with large parking structures in the podiums, while a large park at the lowest level forms the core of the development. In 2002 the building and the whole Lakeshore East development had been scheduled for completion in 2011, and by 2008 the plan was anticipated to be completed in 2013. These plans included an building at Wacker and Lake Shore Drive. In 2017 revised plans were unveiled for remaining construction in the masterplan, but they were revised in August 2018 to include an 80 storey building. On mid-October 2018, the Chicago Plan Commission approved the plans that included a tower as one of four new towers (three in phase I). Chicago City Council approved the plans in an October 31 meeting. Two of the three phase one buildings (the 363-condo/47-story Cirrus and 503-apartment/37-story Cascade) were scheduled for simultaneous summer 2019 groundbreaking with Lakeshore East Building I to follow.

She built the parlor house \\"No. 10 Electric Alley,\\" a complex of small cubicles for prostitutes, close to Union Station on 25th Street. London used the upper level of the London Ice Cream Parlor as a cover for one of her brothels. London married Thomas Topham, a master boilermaker for Union Pacific in 1890. Topham would become a saloon keeper, and together with London, they would gain much influence in Ogden. London also had an adopted daughter named Ethel Topham. London sued for divorce in 1902. In 1908, London was hired by Salt Lake City Mayor John S. Bransford to oversee the move of illicit activities of the downtown red-light district to a new purpose-built stockade outside of the city center. The plan eventually failed and the stockade was closed in 1911. Police raids on 25th Street in 1912 set out to eliminate prostitution, and Belle London left Ogden in around 1914. She moved to San Francisco and changed her name to Maxine Rose. She continued working in the sex business and purchased a hotel.

He was also suspected of another three similar murders in the Plovdiv Province. Latkov was murdered prior to his trial by his cellmate Sami Bayram Aptullah (AKA Sali Abdullah), who was serving time for an attempted murder. Biography Latkov's early life was marked by stays at various orphanages, soon to be followed by indictments for rapes in Veliko Tarnovo as an adolescent. The mentally-ill man was released despite the charges, only to be rearrested years later on March 13, 2003 for kidnapping and raping a 13-year-old boy from a Haskovo bus stop. Following a 5-hour long interrogation, he confessed to raping a 16-year-old girl in Veliko Tarnovo and the murder of three elderly women in the Haskovo Province: * Lilyana Ivanova (84), murdered in Haskovo, 1999 * Kaluda Golemanova, murdered in Lyubimets, 2000 * Elena Atanasova (71), passed away after brutal torture in Biser, 2000 Latkov was also a prime suspect in another three murders committed in the Plovdiv Province, but no information is available about these murders. Following his arrest, he was moved into a psychiatric hospital in Lovech. There, ten days before his death, he wrote a letter to the investigating authorities in Haskovo in which he talked about his loneliness, his appreciation of their humane treatment towards him and a request for some cigarettes. Death After reevaluations from psychologists and investigators alike, Latkov was moved to a prison in Stara Zagora, where he shared a cell with Sami Bayram Aptullah, another mentally-ill prisoner serving an 8-year sentence for attempted murder. On September 13, the two began arguing about something, with the physically stronger Aptullah beating up and strangling Latkov in a matter of seconds. Shortly after, he began banging at his cell door, attracting the attention of guards and medical personnel who tried to save Latkov's life, but to no avail.

(Die W√∂lfe sind zur√ºck?) is a sculpture exhibition created by German artist Rainer Opolka. The exhibition was created as a response to the growing presence of Pegida in the German city of Dresden. The exhibition was installed in front of the Dresden Frauenkirche in Neumarkt square on March 16th, 2016, where it remained until March 23rd, 2016. The exhibition featured 66 metal wolf sculptures placed around the square. The wolves were anthropomorphic in nature, appearing more human towards the center of the exhibition. The wolf statues were arranged around a central figure, a golden wolf giving the Nazi salute. This figure is thought to represent Pegida's leader at the time, Lutz Bachmann. Dresden Neumarkt 172 Artist Before he became an artist, Rainer Opolka was a successful entrepreneur and ‚Äúinventor who made a fortune from developing power saving technologies such as the first commercially available LED torch.‚Äù He developed this technology with his twin brother, Harold Opolka. The brothers created the German light company Ledlenser, and developed the Ledlenser V8 flashlight. Rainer and Harold sold over 200 million Euros' worth of LED flashlights in the first five years of their business. Their Ledlenser V8 flashlight became one of the top-selling LED flashlights in the world. The brothers sold three quarters of the shares in their company ‚Äúto devote themselves exclusively to making art. The brothers have also set up a sculpture and cultural center in Schloss Hubertush√∂he in Storkow, and have already invested ‚Ç¨25 million into the project.‚Äù Although Rainer and Harold collaboratively created the sculpture and cultural centre in Schloss Hubertush√∂he, ‚ÄúThe Wolves Are Back?‚Äù is Rainer's independent project. Description Among the sculptures, there are eight different wolf designs. Each type of sculpture is designed to represent a different group of people contributing to racism in Germany. There are two variations of blindfolded wolves, called blind soldiers and blind haters, representing mob mentality. Another is a gun wielding wolf, representing ‚Äúthe xenophobic murders committed by the neo-Nazi group National Socialist Underground [NSU] during the early 2000s.‚Äù The NSU were responsible for the racially motivated NSU murders, which claimed the lives of eight Turkish immigrants, one Greek person and one German police officer. The attack wolf stands on two legs, lunging forward. There are two sets of statues described as followers, these figures are on all fours. There is the muscleman wolf, and finally one leader wolf. Context =Dresden Installation= The exhibit was created in the early spring of 2016 as a response to political climate in Dresden at the time. The exhibition was installed right after the Refugee Crisis of 2015, when Germany temporarily opened its borders and accepted over one million refugees. The result was a rise in crimes against minorities, asylum seekers and asylum accommodation. Opolka was inspired to create his wolf sculptures after the Federal Criminal Police Office registered ‚Äú1,031 ‚Äúcrimes against asylum accommodation‚Äù across Germany in 2015 ‚Äì from offensive graffiti to 94 acts of arson.‚Äù When asked why he chose to use wolves to symbolize social and political tension in Germany, Opolka stated that ‚Äúsince Thomas Hobbes the wolf has been a symbol for the inner social conflicts of men [...] I remain in that tradition. I want to show those conflicts and use the wolf as metaphor.‚Äù The exhibition ran in Dresden until March 23rd, 2016. =Travelling Installation= W√∂lfe-Kunstaktion gegen Hetze und Gewalt in Chemnitz 2018 (06)Afterwards, ‚ÄúThe Wolves Are Back?‚Äù became a travelling exhibition in several German cities. It stayed in Potsdam's Alter Markt (new parliament) from April 14th to May 1st 2016; Berlin's Washingonplatz (central station) from August 5th to August 16th 2016; Rathenow's M√§rkischer Platz from September 15th to September 17th 2016; Berlin's Brandenburg Gate from January 9th to February 20th 2017; Oranienburg's Schlossplatz from June 1st to June 5th 2017. A statement on the homepage of ‚ÄúThe Wolves Are Back?‚Äù website says that Opolka and his team are currently ‚Äúplanning to visit all the German states as a touring exhibition.‚Äù They ‚Äúare currently filing applications for Hamburg, Bremen, D√ºsseldorf and Cologne.‚Äù Reception ‚ÄúThe Wolves Are Back?‚Äù is considered a success by the artist. It engaged the public in discussions about racism. According to ‚ÄúThe Wolves Are Back?‚Äù website, ‚Äú80,000 visitors came, the wolves were photographed around 200,000 times, our team held thousands of discussions, and more importantly, we provoked tens of thousands of discussions.‚Äù The success of the installation in Dresden is the reason it was approved to show in other cities.

Early life Yao dancing man, 1896 Wainwright's birth date is unknown; accounts of his age vary widely. Some accounts put him at being born in 1849/50, but other accounts estimate that he was about fourteen when he joined Livingstone's expedition, suggesting a birth date around 1859. He was born into the Yao people, who lived in East Africa, on the south of Lake Malawi, and given the name Yamuza. In his teens, he was kidnapped by Arab slave traders. He was rescued by a British anti-slavery ship, baptised a Christian and given the name \\"Jacob Wainwright.\\" Wainwright was educated at a Church Missionary Society school in Bombay, British India. He also stayed at the Nassick African Asylum for freed slaves in Nashik, India. With Livingstone Aged about 14, Wainwright was hired to accompany Dr. Livingstone as he explored East Africa. Inscription by Jacob Wainwright on the tree under which Livingstone was buried Dr. Livingstone died at Ilala, near the edge of the Bangweulu Swamps (in modern Zambia) on 1 May 1873. Wainwright and two other Africans, Abdullah Susi and James Chuma, resolved to bring his body the 1,000 miles (1,600 km) to the British consulate at Bagamoyo in Zanzibar. Before the journey, Livingstone's heart and entrails were removed from his body and buried in an iron box. Wainwright recorded that a massive blood clot, possibly a cancerous tumour, was found in the lower bowel. At the burial ceremony Wainwright read from the Book of Common Prayer. He was also given the responsibility of making a full inventory of Livingstone's possessions. Before the party left Ilala, Wainwright carved the following inscription on the tree marking Livingstone's grave: Jacob Wainwright accompanying David Livingstone's coffin on board the SS Malwa As the most literate member of the party, Wainwright was also responsible for writing a letter to the relief expedition which included Livingstone's son, informing them that Dr Livingstone had died. At Zanzibar, it seems that the British assumed that Wainwright was the leader, despite his youth, because he was the only African servant who could speak and write in English. He was dispatched with the body for England, picking up with the Peninsular and Oriental liner the SS Malwa at Aden, and with the help of the explorer's son Thomas from Alexandria onwards, Wainwright guarded Livingstone's coffin on its journey to Britain. Wainwright was the only African among the eight pallbearers at the explorer‚Äôs funeral in Westminster Abbey on 18 April 1874. Later life and death Following Livingstone's death Wainwright stayed in England at Kessingland, Suffolk and travelled across the country addressing meetings of the Church Missionary Society. On 18 August 1874, he went to teach freed slaves at Kisulidini, near Mombasa. He was dismissed from this job in 1876. There are also accounts of Wainwright teaching at a school at Frere Town, a settlement for freed slaves north of Mombasa.Wainwright's companions, Susi and Chuma (from Stanley and the White Heroes in Africa, 1890) By 1879, Wainwright was working as a door-porter in Zanzibar, following his dismissal from his previous position as a result of \\"impudent and forward\\" behaviour. In 1881 he was hired as interpreter, teacher and personal servant by the missionary Philip O'Flaherty. They travelled to Lubaga (Rubaga) together, where Wainwright was hired by Muteesa I of Buganda. In 1884, Wainwright joined a mission led by Edward C. Hore and in the late 1880s he joined the London Missionary Society mission in Urambo District, German East Africa (modern Tanzania) where he translated hymns and passages of scripture. Wainwright died at the Urambo Mission in April 1892 as a result of burns and scalds from falling onto a fire and upturning a pot of water. He was buried near his hut, his grave marked by a borassus palm until in 1931 the Moravian Church, Salem, North Carolina, USA presented a metal tablet to be laid at his grave. Legacy Wainwright recorded his experiences on the Livingstone mission. One diary that detailed the bringing of Livingston'e body to the Swahili coast for repatriation to Great Britain was published by the Hakluyt Society in 2007. In 2019, one of Wainwright's entire handwritten diaries, as well as a few personal letters, were digitized and made available online. The diary is valued, as few indigenous Black African servants of white European explorers are known to have written about their experiences.

The airline is owned by Taos Ski Valley, Inc. and operates the Fairchild Dornier 328JET. Service to Texas began in the 2018‚Äì2019 winter season. Summer service in 2019 was planned but subsequently canceled. The 2019‚Äì2020 winter season saw the introduction of the California routes and the early cancellation of service due to the COVID-19 pandemic. History On 20 December 2018, Taos Air began service with scheduled flights from Taos Regional Airport in New Mexico using a 30-seat Dornier 328JET. The service was introduced to promote skiing in the Taos area, and free shuttle service to Taos Ski Valley was offered. Taos Air is owned by Taos Ski Valley, Inc., which pays for operation and upkeep of the single aircraft; the Town of Taos provides terminal access, marketing, de-icing service, and a hangar. The aircraft was operated on a charter basis by Ultimate Jetcharters, an FAR Part 135 air charter company that also operates scheduled charter flights under the Ultimate Air Shuttle brand name. During its inaugural season, the carrier used a private terminal at Dallas Love Field; no TSA security checks were required. In March 2019, the Taos County Board of Commissioners and the Town of Taos voted to give Taos Air grants totaling $850,000 for summer service to promote tourism. On 9 April, Taos Air received final approval to operate summer flights. Despite this, the flights were canceled in June 2019 due to unavailability of aircraft and pilots from the charter company, and consequently the grant money was not disbursed. Texas flights resumed on 19 December 2019, using a 328JET, now operated by Advanced Air. In January 2020, service to Hawthorne Municipal Airport and McClellan-Palomar Airport in California was introduced. Service for the 2019‚Äì20 ski season was intended to continue until 29 March 2020 but was terminated on 15 March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In November 1767, the Qianlong Emperor ordered the Third Invasion under the command of his son-in-law Mingrui with a 50,000-strong invasion force led by the Manchu Bannermen after the failure of the Green Standard Army and Yunnan Border troops in the earlier invasions. They were the most successful of the invasions penetrating deep into central Burma and defeating the main Burmese army at the Battle of Goteik Gorge. However, Mingrui ended up overstretching his lines by the time he reached Ava. Burmese reinforcements arrived from Siam and began cutting the Qing supply lines. Hounded by Burmese guerrilla attacks, his men suffering from tropical diseases and with no hope of being reinforced, Mingrui was forced to retreat. The Burmese army under Maha Thiha Thura caught up with him at Maymyo, modern day Pyinoolwin and all but wiped out the invasion force with the exception of a few survivors.  Campaign background  The Qing army's plans were to use a pincer action on the Burmese capital of Ava with the main army of 30,000 under Ming Rui invading through Hsenwi, Lashio and Hsipaw, and down the Namtu river while the smaller one around 15,000 under General E'erdeng'e invading through Bhamo. The remaining Qing troops were left behind at Hsenwi to guard the supply lines. After defeating the main Burmese army at the Battle of Goteik Gorge, Ming Rui's forces raced to Ava mopping any resistance. However, Burmese guerrilla attacks under General Teingya Minkhaung on the long supply lines began to hamper the Qing army's ability to proceed. By the time they reached Ava, the Qing main army had overstretched itself and Ming Rui was forced on the defensive, playing for time to enable the northern army to come to his relief. However, the northern army had severely weakened itself during their repeated assaults on the Kaungton fort. Against orders, the northern force retreated back to Yunnan. By early 1768, veteran Burmese troops had returned from the Siamese theatre and Generals Maha Thiha Thura and Ne Myo Sithu succeeded in retaking the Qing supply base at Hsenwi. Completely cut off from all supplies, the Bannermen from the freezing grasslands along the Russian border, began dying of malaria as well as guerrilla attacks in the burning weather of central Burma. Ming Rui abandoned all hope of taking Ava and attempted to retreat back to China with as many men as he could. In March, the Qing began their retreat, stalked by a Burmese army of 10,000 men and 2000 cavalry under Maha Thiha Thura who had been promoted to overall command. The Burmese divided into two forces, a smaller army led by Maha Sithu, continued to pursue Ming Rui while the larger army led by Maha Thiha Thura advanced through the mountainous route to cut off the Qing army.  Battle  The smaller Burmese army under Maha Sithu engaged the Qing forces head on and was repulsed by the superior Chinese numbers. However, Sithu instead of retreating pulled a number of troops, particularly archers and musketeers, into the jungle and began harassing the Qing's flanks and ambushing foraging parties. While Mingrui was occupied with Sithu's army, Thiha Thura's larger force successfully moved through the mountains to arrive directly behind the Qing army and managed to achieve complete encirclement of the Qing main army. Over the next three days of hard fighting, the Burmese whittled away the larger but weakened and starving Chinese army. The desperate Qing troops attempted to break the encirclement through Sithu's smaller army but the Burmese infantry stood firm and held off the Chinese assaults. Trapped between Sithu's infantry in front, fired at from the sides by Burmese archers and musketeers and charged by Thiha Thura's army from the rear the Qing army was eventually wiped out. Historian Harvey said that the Burmese could hardly grip their swords with their hilts so slippery with enemy blood.  Aftermath  Aside from some 2500 men captured, the entire Qing army was completely wiped out. Mingrui was severely wounded and a small group of Qing soldiers managed to break through. Although he could have escaped, Mingrui cut off his queue and sent it to the emperor as a token of his loyalty and then hanged himself on a tree. The Qianlong Emperor had assumed an easy victory so when then the news finally came, the Emperor was shocked. Desperate to redeem the humiliation, an even larger army invaded in 1769 under chief grand councilor Fuheng. This invasion too failed, bogged down in at frontier. But Maha Thiha Thura, who oversaw the annihilation of Ming Rui's army at the battle of Maymyo, correctly realized that another wipe-out would merely stiffen the resolve of the Chinese government. Furthermore, Burmese losses while small compared to China were heavy in comparison to its smaller population. On his own responsibility, Thiha Thura forced the Qing commanders on terms without informing the king and oversaw their retreat back to Yunnan.

Very little is known about Van Hasel except for his work in translating the Bible, his mission to Ayutthaya and his appointment as the head of the VOC mission to Surat. Background The VOC was not only chartered with a monopoly on trade in the East Indies by the Dutch Republic but also on all aspects of Dutch involvement in the East Indies. While the VOC did not encourage missionary work, it did sponsor chaplains, both clerical and lay, for the Dutch population as well as tolerated efforts to proselytise native Roman Catholics who had been converted by Portuguese missionaries earlier, particularly in Ambon. With the partially Protestant Reformation inspired Dutch Revolt still ongoing in the home provinces against the Roman Catholic Spanish Empire (of which Portugal was then a part of), the motivation to undermine Portuguese trade and religious influence in the East Indies may have motivated this tolerance of proselytisation. Translation work A translation of the Gospel of Matthew was completed by Van Hasel as early as 1602 but was not published as the 1612 translation by Albert Cornelius Ruyl was preferred by the VOC. As Ruyl was unable to complete his translation of all four Gospels before he died, Van Hasel persevered with his translation work and the Gospels of Luke and John was published in Amsterdam in a Dutch-Malay diglot in 1646. Both Ruyl and Van Hasel's translations were then compared to the Dutch Statenvertaling, the 1637 official Dutch translation of the Bible, revised by Daniel Brouwerious and published in a single volume in 1651 in Amsterdam. Later career In 1624, a Spanish ship sailing from Siam where it had taken shelter as a result of a storm, attacked the passing Dutch yacht Zeelandt at night. The Spanish entered the VOC ship with the loss of only one man. The crew and the merchandise aboard were captured. King Songtham of Ayutthaya sent a message to the Spanish commander, Don Fernando de Silva stating that he should return the ship and set the crew free, since it was captured in Siamese territorial waters. The request was refused rudely and as a result, the Spanish docked in Siam was attacked and the Zeelandt captured by the Siamese. The king returned after negotiating the Zeelandt to the Dutch, but its cargo remained locked in his warehouses. In order to negotiate the cargo, the Governor General in Batavia, Pieter de Carpentier, sent Van Hasel to Siam. The latter succeeded in partly recuperating the Dutch merchandise. The Spanish- Dutch incident would bring Siam on the brink of war with Spain, while at the same time Portugal lost their favorite status in Siam and could no more obtain proper access to the Siamese Court. In 1628, Van Hasel was appointed the head of the VOC trade mission to the prosperous Mughal port city of Surat. Not much is known about Van Hasel after that.

Morrill Act of 1862  Introduced by Vermont Senator Justin Morrill and signed by President Abraham Lincoln., the Morrill Act (12 Stat. L., 305) is considered to be the first federal attempt at vocational education. It dedicated land obtained by the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 to be used for colleges that taught mechanics and agriculture. Its enactment kick- started a plethora of federal vocational education efforts. University of Washington professor, William Stull Holt, noted in his 1992 book Federal Board for Vocational Education: Its History, Activities, and Organization that \\"there was not a session in Congress from 1910 on when one or more bills [weren't] touching on some phase of vocational education\\"  Organization by the Smith-Hughs Act of 1917  Also known as the National Vocational Education Act, the Smith-Hughes Act (39 Stat.

It was introduced by Georgia Senator Hoke Smith and Representative Dudley Hughes and signed by President Woodrow Wilson February 23, 1917. It set aside salaries and preparations for instructors of agriculture and industry. The act separated the board into three parts: agriculture, commerce, and labor. Along with a U.S. Commissioner of Education, each part had a secretary and civilian representative. With these components, the board would oversee and fund vocational education across the states.

Later, testifying at his trial in 1995, Marie-Th√©r√®se Didier, his mother, described a troubled childhood and youth, characterised by failure at school, rejection by girls and possible employers and suicidal concerns. But there was also a determination to reject what he perceived as wrong-doing: \\"Il ne supportait pas le mal, tout √ßa le bouleversait\\" (loosely, \\"He couldn't stand wrong-doing: all that stuff upset him\\"). After leaving school a succession of jobs followed in quick succession. He worked briefly in a foundry, as an internships supervisor, as a locksmith, as an archivist and as a delivery driver. He spent some time outside France: his travels took him to Norway, Sweden, Australia and even, during the \\"beat generation years\\", California. But he also came into contact with the world of psychiatric hospitals, being on several occasion detained in connection with his mental issues. =Chauffeur to the stars= Between 1974 and 1983 he held a driving job, working as a chauffeur for a number of high-profile celebrities. Based in Paris, he rubbed shoulders with stars such as Salvador Dali, Charlie Chaplin, Richard Burton, David Bowie, Catherine Deneuve and Romy Schneider. He then had to give up the job for health reasons. He developed serious bladder problems and was obliged to undergo several serious operations. In 1983 Didier returned to live with his mother in Saint-Di√©. =Author= Back home, he read a lot. By this time Didier had also embarked on a career of sorts as an author. However, he was for a long time unable to find a publisher for any of the three books that he had written. One of his manuscripts found its way to the desk of Simone de Beauvoir who wrote back a note, \\"I don't like your book at all: metaphysical jargon\\" (\\"Je n‚Äôaime pas du tout votre livre, du jargon m√©taphysique\\"). In May 1985 he nevertheless published one of his books, \\"La Balade d'Early Bird\\", at his own expense. =Publicity= An early publicity stunt involved walking the 300 miles from Paris to Strasbourg in 1980 with an unpublished book of memoires concerning his travels in Australia under one arm. Still keen to promote his book, during the later 1980s he made several bizarre television appearances, drawing attention to himself in studio chat shows by bursting in front of the cameras and making one of his increasingly familiar \\"Achetez mon livre!\\" (\\"Buy my book\\") announcements, before being bundled out by security officials. On one occasion he inserted himself into a broadcast of the \\"C√©sar Awards\\" and on another interrupted the transmission of an international football match by displaying a banner. His media appearances tended to end in visits to a police station and, increasingly, assessment visits to psychiatric clinics. Nevertheless, in 1989 he was rewarded with an invitation to appear on TF1, France's leading television channel, in a programme devoted to \\"those whom the telly makes mad\\" (\\"... ceux que la t√©l√© rend fous\\"). Eventually, however, he began to appreciate that he was not being taken seriously. He even doubted his own talent as an author. The conviction that success equated with fame remained undimmed, however, and he became increasingly attracted by the role of \\"universal citizen and justice giver for moral order\\" (\\"citoyen universel, justicier de l'ordre moral\\"). Another term that comes up in connection with Didier's self-appointed mission around this time is \\"avenger of the Jews\\" (\\"vengeur de juifs\\"). =Klaus Barbie= On 19 May 1987 Christian Didier was arrested while trying to gain admission to the Prison Saint-Paul in Lyon: he was in possession of a revolver. His intention was to confront Klaus Barbie, the city's reviled wartime Gestapo boss. Barbie was much in the news at the time because his trial in respect an exceptional palette of alleged wartime atrocities was due to open the next week. Didier was arrested after the revolver in the bag he was carrying set off an alarm at the prison entrance. He faced trial and was sentenced, for illegal possession of a fire-arm, to four months in prison, after which he was referred for another bout of psychiatric treatment followed by a return to his mother's modest apartment in Saint-Di√©. Didier explained that he had never wanted to kill Barbie: \\"I just wanted to shoot him in the legs while calling out, 'that's your greeting from Jean Moulin!'\\" (\\"Je ne voulais pas le tuer, simplement lui tirer dans les jambes en lui criant: 't‚Äôas le bonjour de Jean Moulin!'\\"). (Jean Moulin was a high-profile r√©sistance hero for whose torture and death - officially a suicide - Klaus Barbie was widely blamed.) Didier had prepared for himself a false set of papers identifying him as a qualified doctor. He intended to use these to persuade the prison authorities to give him access to Barbie. Subsequent commentators - albeit in most cases only after their judgement was informed by the killing of Ren√© Bousquet six years later - have expressed the view that the court should have taken Didier's escapade at the Prison Saint- Paul much more seriously. In September 1989 Didier managed to break in to gardens at the √âlys√©e Palace. Security personnel overpowered him, however. He explained the action by saying that he had wanted to deliver a dossier concerning the wartime hero Raoul Wallenberg to President Mitterrand. This time he was automatically transferred to a psychiatric hospital where he spent six weeks and received a diagnosis - subsequently questioned - of \\"sensitive paranoid psychosis\\" (\\"psychose parano√Øaque sensitive\\"). After his discharge he conceived a project to assassinate Paul Touvier, another suspected (and subsequently convicted) Nazi war criminal who had served as an intelligence chief during the war and was in the headlines during 1989, having recently been located and arrested by the police. Didier's plan could not be implemented, however, because he was unable to find out where Touvier was being held. =Ren√© Bousquet= It was now that Didier selected a new target: Ren√© Bousquet, the collaborationist police chief in the P√©tain government. Bousquet was (and despite never having been tried and convicted, still is) widely thought to have been the principal organiser of the \\"Vel' d'Hiv Roundup\\", the \\"26 August 1942 Roundup\\" six weeks later, the \\"Marseilles Roundup\\" of January 1943 and of other actions supporting the elimination of Jews in occupied Europe. On the morning of 8 June 1993 Cristian Didier lit a candle to Saint Joan of Arc. He then made his way to the apartment bloc in which Bousquet had his Paris home on the Avenue Rapha√´l in the 16th arrondissement. Bousquet at this time was under criminal investigation in connection with his wartime activities: according to at least one source he faced \\"imminent trial for crimes against humanity\\". Didier explained that he was a document courier with papers from the Interior Ministry that urgently needed to be delivered to Bousquet, thereby gaining admittance to the building. He now continued up to Bousquet's apartment on the sixth floor. Bousquet opened the door himself and Didier repeated his explanation that he had documents that needed to be delivered urgently, while reaching into his bag, supposedly for the documents. However, instead of documents he took out a revolver, with which he shot Ren√© Bousquet dead, using four or five bullets. (Sources differ.) He later explained that he had to use four bullets because the first couple of shots did nothing to stop Bousquet, who was now advancing on him, trying to hit him, and swearing at him. He had been afraid that Bousquet's dog would attack him, but the dog fled at the first shot. The deed having been done, he walked to the nearest Metro station and made his way across the city to Les Lilas, where he had booked a room in the Hotel Paul-de- Koch, a small and somewhat run down establishment. Now he started telephoning the media. \\"I'm the one who's killed this piece of shit. I have a message for you\\" (\\" C'est moi qui ai tu√© cette ordure, j'ai un message √† vous d√©livrer.\\") Journalists from Le Monde and Le Parisien were among the first to arrive, followed by representatives from Lib√©ration, Television France 1 and Radio Monte Carlo. He also called Television France 2, but the secretaries taking his call decided he was a fantasist and refused to connect him to the news desk. Wearing worn jeans and a polo shirt, Didier addressed the assembled journalists for more than an hour. \\"Eliminating a monster is an honorable thing to do: it's the victory of good over evil\\" (\\"... √©liminer un monstre est honorable, c'est la victoire du bien sur le mal.\\"). He went on to provide an eerily detailed and factual account of the killing he had committed a couple of hours earlier. After preparing a report for the midday news. a television reporter called the police in order to try and corroborate Didier's story. When they arrived, one of them observed that Didier seemed angry. Didier told the police (with journalists still present) that his health and intellectual faculties had recently deteriorated, and that he had thought the time had come to deliver a spiritual message to the western world, in order to give a sense of purpose to his life. Between 7 and 13 November 1995 he was tried by the Court of Assizes in Paris He was defended by Thierry L√©vy and Arnaud Montebourg two politically committed lawyers with a passionate awareness of the broader historical background of the case, though after sentence was passed L√©vy volunteered that the two of them had, perhaps, not been the best team to defend their client. Didier was sentenced to ten years of criminal detention. The court heard Didier's defence lawyers arguing that the killing of Ren√© Bousquet by Christian Didier represented a response to the failings of the French justice system. There were times when the trial seemed to be turning into a trial not of Didier but of Bousquet. Didier's own testimony alternated between cool lucidity and a series of repetitive and barely coherent mystical allusions to a \\"divine mission\\", \\"visions in the forest\\" and \\"voices\\". There were also times when he appeared deeply and genuinely contrite. =Final years= After six years and eight months behind bars Didier was released early, \\"for good conduct\\", on 24 February 2000 from the detention centre at Toul where he had spent much of his sentence. Back in 1993 Didier's trial had attracted extensve press coverage, and following his sentencing a support committee was set up, comprising various \\"patriots\\" and those representing wartime deportees to the death camps. The trial of Maurice Papon in 1997/98 generated a renewed media focus on Didier and an intensified campaign for his release. Even the town council of Saint-Di√©, his home town submitted a request for clemency to the Court of Assizes in Paris on his behalf. Even when he testified at his trial in 1995 Didier had, at times, provided assurances that two years in pre-trial detention had given him time to think and he was \\"vaccinated for ever against all forms of future crime\\". He asked God for pardon and God had told him \\"you shall not kill\\". He asked forgiveness of the Jews whom he had deprived of a trial [for Bousquet]. After his release he restated his contrition in a newspaper interview. \\"At that time I was going through deep depression. I thought I was on a divine mission ... to kill Ren√© Bousquet and that if I did not do it I would have no right to eternal grace\\". But now he was just a \\"normal bloke\\" (\\"un simple quidam\\"). His media profile could not be completely shaken off, however. In his well received 2010 debut novel HHhH, Laurent Binet mentioned Didier, identifying him as the \\"spectaculaire abruti\\" (loosely, \\"eye-watering cretin\\") who had deprived France of the \\"trial of the century\\".Laurent Binet, HHhH, p. 324. In 2013 Christian Didier launched a defamation case against the author Alain Minc. In a biographical book on Ren√© Bousquet published the previous year, Minc had described Didier as \\"fou\\" (loosely, \\"crazy\\", \\"mad\\"). Didier claimed ‚Ç¨10,000 in damages. He said he would donate the money to supporters of Roger McGowen, a prisoner in Texas who was awaiting execution. However, Didier had addressed his claim to Etienne Manteaux in √âpinal: Manteaux was the public prosecutor for the d√©partement. Didier had thereby invoked the criminal law rather than launching a civil claim, and under these circumstances the defendant in the case was the book's publisher, √âditions Grasset. The author was merely an accomplice in respect of any criminal defamation. The court in √âpinal nevertheless agreed to hear the case, which it did during the first week of August 2013. In the end Minc was discharged in respect of the defamation allegation. (In respect of a slightly earlier legal case triggered by the same book, the author Alain Minc fared less well: when the plagiarism case launched by the Paris author Pascale Froment came to trial it was determined that Minc should pay Froment damages of ‚Ç¨5,000, along with a contribution to court costs of ‚Ç¨6,000.) Didier's final written piece, a short autobiographical volume entitled Fugaces traits de plume‚Ä¶ en roue libre! was completed in 2014. It appears never to have been published, although there are mentions of it having at one stage been accessible online. He gave his final press interview in April 2015, still concerned to obtain some form of public rehabilitation. Christian Didier died at Saint Di√© on 14 May 2015.

Katz. A co-founder of the Rockport Shoe Company, Katz founded Samuel Hubbard in Mill Valley, CA to continue his family‚Äôs legacy designing and marketing premium footwear. History The origins of the Samuel Hubbard Shoe company date back to the 1930s when Samuel J. Katz established the Hubbard Shoe Company in Rochester, NH. The company grew to more than 500 employees during the height of World War II, when it manufactured boots for the armed services. By the end of the war, government orders had slowed significantly and Samuel‚Äôs son Saul Katz joined the company to help his father rebuild. The Hubbard Shoe Company prospered through the 1950s and 1960s, partly due to new government contracts to make ski and parachute boots during the Korean conflict. However, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, overseas manufacturing became cheaper and more readily available. Unable to compete, New England shoe factories began to dwindle and by 1973, the Hubbard Shoe Company was forced to close its doors. In 1971, Saul Katz used $15,000 to start the Rockport Shoe Company with his son Bruce. The company embraced the concept of overseas manufacturing and pioneered the idea of the comfort shoe. Revenue grew to almost $100 million in sales before acquisition by Reebok in 1986. When his stockpile of 24 pairs of Rockports began to run out, Katz wondered where his next pairs of shoes would come from. This, combined with the passing of his father Saul Katz in 2012 and concern that his eight year old daughter would never know the family‚Äôs shoemaking history, convinced Bruce to return to the shoe industry. The Samuel Hubbard company was founded in July 2013, the name commemorating the family legacy with the first part ‚ÄúSamuel‚Äù named after Bruce‚Äôs grandfather, and the second part ‚ÄúHubbard‚Äù reflective of his grandfather‚Äôs company, Hubbard Shoe Co. Products and manufacturing Samuel Hubbard is best known for the ‚ÄúUnsneaker,‚Äù a casual and dress shoe hybrid that resembles a dress shoe on the outside, but feels like a sneaker on the inside. The company produces several dozen styles including casual shoes, dress shoes and slip-ons. In 2018, golf shoes and boat shoes were introduced. Uppers and insoles are made from European-sourced leathers, while most models use Vibram outsoles. Manufacturing is performed in Portugal, a result of Katz‚Äôs industry connections and knowledge from his Rockport days. Shoes are sold through the company‚Äôs website, major retailers like Nordstrom and Dillards, and more than 500 independent shoe retailers across the United States. In Popular Culture Samuel Hubbard shoes have been worn by Ultramarathoner Dean Karnazes and were worn by Danny Glover in the film The Old Man & The Gun. They‚Äôve also been worn by singer Peter Gabriel, celebrity chef Brian Malarkey and former president Bill Clinton. Corporate Giving The company has sponsored the Marin Humane Society and frequently features dogs in its catalogs.

He replaced Viriathus at the last year of the Lusitanian War. Biography He is first mentioned to take the mantle of Viriathus after the latter's murder. His participation in the war was short, and he was acknowledged to lack Viriathus's tactic skills. Leading the remnants of Viriathus's army, he marched against the city of Saguntum in the Roman province of Hispania Citerior, besieging it unsuccessfully. After being repelled by the defenders, they turned against Hispania Ulterior, going down the Betis river, where Quintus Servilius Caepio met them with a numerically superior army. Tautalus and the Lusitanians were defeated and forced to surrender their weapons. However, after signing a peace treaty with Tautalus, Caepio assigned them lands in order to make them stop their rebel activities. The Lusitanians were then settled by Decimus Junius Brutus in the colony of Valentia (possibly modern Valen√ßa do Minho o Valencia de Alc√°ntara, if not the more geographically distant Valencia).  Etymology  The name Tautalus, as transmitted by Appian, is recognized to come from the Celtic and Germanic root teu, meaning \\"people.\\" However, there are doubts about whether Appian meant it to be either such or Tantalus, as in the Hellenic name Tantalus. Similarly, Diodorus transmits the name as Tautamus or Tantamus.

Early life and education  R√∂thlisberger was born in Solothurn. She studied physical chemistry at the University of Bern. She earned her diploma under the supervision of Ernst Schumacher in 1988. She joined IBM Research ‚Äì Zurich as a doctoral student with Wanda Andreoni. She worked in IBM Zurich as a postdoc until 1992. R√∂thlisberger moved to the University of Pennsylvania to work with Michael L. Klein. In 1995 she moved to Germany and joined the group of Michele Parrinello at the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research. Together they used the Car-Parrinello method to study nanoscale clusters of silicon.  Research and career  R√∂thlisberger was appointed assistant professor at ETH Zurich in 1996. She was the first woman to win the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology at Zurich Ruzicka Prize in 2001. She joined √âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne as an associate professor in 2002 and was made full professor in 2009. In 2005 she was the first woman to be awarded the World Association of Theoretical and Computational Chemists Dirac Medal. R√∂thlisberger works on density functional theory, extending the Car-Parrinello method to include QM/MM simulations in a code called CPMD. QM/MM systems treat the electronically active part of a molecular structure as a quantum mechanical system, whereas the rest of the molecule is treated classically using molecular mechanics. She uses her hybrid Car‚ÄìParrinello systems to study enzymatic reactions to design biomimetic compounds. R√∂thlisberger has also expanded QM/MM to include ground to excited state transitions, making it possible to predict photoinduced charge separation and electron transfer. She also works on ab initio simulations of biological systems, and has added the Van der Waals interactions of macromolecules to density functional theory. She has used her simulations for several different applications, including the design of new materials for photovoltaics and exploring the operational mechanisms of chemotherapy. In 2017 she demonstrated that taking Auranofin whilst on RAPTA-T enhances the activity of the anti-cancer drug. She teaches classes in Monte Carlo simulations and molecular dynamics. = Advocacy and engagement = R√∂thlisberger supports young women scientists and is involved with mentoring of early career researchers.

First years  Hermosa was born on February 28, 1976, in the city of Clemente Baquerizo, Los R√≠os Province. He was adopted by Olivo Hermosa Fonseca and Zoila Amada Su√°rez Mej√≠a, who took him to live in a populous neighborhood north of Quito. Juan was often looked after by his deaf adoptive mother, who also suffered from arthritis, while his adoptive father travelled around the Sucumb√≠os Province, where he owned properties.  Crimes  At 15 years of age, he began leading a gang of ten youngsters of the same age, frequenting the videogame shops in the La Mar√≠n sector, in downtown Quito. He often went to bars and clubs in the area known as Puente del Guambra, near the Central University. = Murders = While leaving a discoth√®que with friends on November 22, 1991, the group took a taxi from the San Remo brand, and after reaching 10 de Agosto Avenue, Hermosa pulled out a 9mm pistol obtained through a guard, shooting the driver in the head and killing him instantly. One of his friends then drove the vehicle to the southeast of the city and dispose of the body in a guardaya, in the Los Chillos Valley, where the body was found by police the next day. A week later, Hermosa went with other members of his gang to a hairdresser where he usually fixed his hair, operated by a transvestite named Charlie, south of the city. Charlie invited them to drink at home, where they started an argument which ended in Hermosa shooting Charlie five times before she could ask for help. Hermosa's crimes totaled 22 murders, occurring in only four months, claiming the lives of 8 taxi drivers, 11 homosexuals, a truck driver and his acquaintance, as well as two others, earning him the nickname \\"Ni√±o del Terror\\". The victims were shot to death with the 9mm pistol, the crimes occurring during the weekends, which caused a panic among the taxi drivers and homosexuals who lived in northern Quito. = Capture = The mayor Fausto Ter√°n Bustillos was put in command of a squad formed by the Grupo de Intervenci√≥n y Rescate (GIR) of the National Police, which was in charge of investigating Ni√±o del Terror's crimes. Police managed to catch a group of young criminals in the city center who tried to rob a place, revealing information about the identity of whoever was behind the killings. On January 9, 1992, they located the Hermosa residence, located between Am√©rica and Diguja Streets, and through an operation which begun on January 16 at 3 o'clock AM. The contingent was located on the exterior of the presumed murderer's house, and the police entered the home through a skylight that determined that it was facing the suspect's room, who was sleeping in his mother's room. The mistake of the police alerted Hermosa, who began shooting at close range with his 9mm pistol, starting a shootout between him and the police. A group of gendarmes who were on the street began throwing grenades, causing an explosion that ended up knocking down the wall of the house on top of two policemen. Hermosa's mother died during the confrontation, shot 11 times, while Juan himself was captured 15 minutes later without receiving a scratch, while trying to escape through the back window. A contingent of 10 agents transferred Hermosa to the Garc√≠a Moreno prison that same morning, where they were surprised to learn that the suspect was a minor, declared by his own words: \\"I want to make it clear that my name is Juan Fernando Hermosa Su√°rez and that on February 28, I will be 16 years old\\". He claimed in his statements that he had no intent of killing, as he had asked his victims to be quiet and that nothing would happen to them, but by ignorning that warning, they ended their lives. Hermosa said that on one occasion he was threatened with a .22 caliber revolver, and on another occasion a taxi driver had tried to attack him with a wheel wrench, so he had to kill them with his gun.  Condemnation, escape and recapture  He was sentenced to the maximum penalty that the law allowed for a minor, which is 4 years imprisonment at the Virgilio Guerrero Rehabilitation Center, after confessing to his crimes. However, he became a juvenile leader in prison in the first 16 months, even managing to obtain a pistol through his girlfriend Yadira, with which he killed a policeman attempting to stop him by shooting him five times, before escaping from prison with ten young boys in 1993. He fled to Colombia, where he contracted tonsillitis. He was recaptured and released after serving his sentence in 1996.  Death  After his release, he went to live with his father in Nueva Loja, Sucumb√≠os. On the day of his 20th birthday, he was found dead on the banks of the Aguarico River. It was revealed by police that 5 hooded individuals were responsible for the murder, managing to identify Hermosa through documents in his wallet, as his face was disfigured and with signs of torture, cut with machetes and riddled with bullets.  Documentary  In 2011, the documentary Tras las sombras del ni√±o del terror, directed, produced and written by Vladimir and Marco Soasti, premiered.

It began forming in August, 1941 in the Urals Military District. It followed a very similar combat path to that of the 374th and 376th Rifle Divisions. It joined the fighting front in December with the 4th Army, and then briefly came under command of 2nd Shock Army, but soon moved to the 59th Army along the Volkhov River, and continued to serve in this Army's battles near Leningrad until early 1944. The division took very heavy casualties during the Lyuban Offensive in several attempts to relieve the beleaguered 2nd Shock Army. After rebuilding the division held the Army's bridgehead over the Volkhov during 1943, and finally advanced during the Leningrad‚ÄìNovgorod Offensive in January, 1944, taking part in the assault that liberated Novgorod. During the spring the division saw heavy fighting in the battles for Narva before moving south for the summer offensive into the Baltic states. In September it won a battle honor in the liberation of Valga, and in October also received the Order of the Red Banner for its part in the liberation of Riga. The division ended the war in Latvia, helping to contain and reduce the German forces trapped in the Courland Pocket, and was disbanded later in 1945.

Kantemir Tsalikov was assigned to command of the division on September 15, and he would remain in command until September 7, 1942. In November the division was assigned to the 39th Army, but was reassigned to the 4th Army in the Volkhov Front by December 17. It was moved to 2nd Shock Army for a few weeks in January, 1942, but by January 21 it was finally assigned to the 59th Army, where it would remain until February, 1944.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 101 Lyuban Offensive Operation Volkhov Front, including 59th Army, began the offensive on Lyuban, which was intended to break the German siege of Leningrad, on the morning of January 6, but the Soviet forces were far from fully prepared and by the end of the day this initial assault expired in the face of heavy resistance. On January 10 the STAVKA called a three day halt in the attacks. During this period Stalin sent his special emissary and \\"fixer\\" L. Z. Mekhlis to the Front to supervise the attack preparations. While personally he was universally loathed and feared, Mekhlis' interventions were in some respects positive: Volkhov Front and the 54th Army of Leningrad Front resumed the offensive early on January 13 preceded by much more powerful artillery preparation. On January 17, 2nd Shock resumed its attack, supported by more than 1,500 aircraft sorties, and finally penetrated the Germans' first defensive positions on the west bank of the Volkhov, advanced 5 - 10 km and created conditions that Front commander Army Gen. K. A. Meretskov considered favorable for developing success. Early on the 22nd, he proposed to the STAVKA, in part: \\"The Front reserve will consist of the 46th Tank Brigade and the 377th Rifle Division in the Glady region and the 87th Cavalry Division in the Bolshaia Vishera region.\\"David M. Glantz, The Battle for Leningrad, 1941-1944, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2002, pp. 158, 160-64 In late March the German 18th Army was able to pinch off communications to 2nd Shock Army and elements of 59th Army in the pocket south of Lyuban. On March 30 and again on April 8 Volkhov Front's attacks opened small gaps of 2 km to 6 km in width through the German cordon, but these were considered inadequate. A new offensive by the 59th was planned, but the spring rainy period set in, bringing everything but foot traffic to a halt. On April 23 Volkhov Front was disbanded and the Army entered the Volkhov Group of Forces of Leningrad Front, but Volkhov Front was reestablished in June. Leningrad Front planned a new operation beginning on May 6 to liquidate the northern pincer of the German semi-encirclement; the 377th was to have attacked from the east but the plan was scrapped in the face of German reinforcements. This led to the decision to finally withdraw 2nd Shock from the pocket. The breakout began on May 17 with 59th Army attacking from the east to assist, but it could not fulfill its mission because its divisions were woefully understrength.Glantz, Battle for Leningrad, pp. 177, 180-82, 192, 196, 198-99 Colonel Tsalikov left command of the division on September 9. He was replaced a week later by Col. Nikolai Prokofevich Kovalchuk. Kovalchuk was briefly replaced by Col. Leonid Gavrilovich Sergeev on January 2, 1943, but returned to command on February 2, and was promoted to the rank of major general on May 18. Leningrad-Novgorod Offensive On August 28 General Kovalchuk, who was already serving as chief of staff of 59th Army, handed his command to Col. Semyon Sergeevich Safronov. In preparation for this upcoming offensive, in November the 377th came under its first corps command, the 112th Rifle Corps,Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 300 where it would remain until April, 1944. When the drive on Novgorod began on January 14, 1944, this Corps was in the second echelon of 59th Army. Over the next four days the Army made a slow but inexorable advance north and south of the city, threatening to envelop the German forces defending it. On the 18th, Lt. Gen. I. T. Korovnikov committed the 112th Corps to protect the Army's right flank and cooperate with 54th Army in the encirclement and destruction of two German corps in the Lyuban - Chudovo region. On the morning of January 20 elements of the 7th and 14th Rifle Corps liberated Novgorod.Glantz, Battle for Leningrad, pp. 345-49. The next objective for 59th Army, and Volkhov Front as a whole, was the town of Luga. Korovnikov resumed his offensive on January 21 and provided significant engineer support to cross the roadless and heavily forested swampland spanning the entire region east of Luga. 6th Rifle Corps attacked westward through Batetsky to Luga, supported on the right by 112th Corps. However the advance faltered badly on January 24 after only minimal gains. 6th Corps was tired and badly understrength, and Meretskov criticized Korovnikov for the slow advance, noting that both Corps \\"... failed to maneuver properly, made little use of their ski battalions, paid scant attention to adequate reconnaissance, and, when they encountered German strongpoints, frequently resorted to frontal attacks.\\" Following a regrouping within the Front, when the advance on Luga resumed on January 27 the 59th Army contained only the 6th and 112th Corps and 29th Tank Brigade. In three days of heavy fighting the 112th fought its way across the Luga River, reaching to within 18 km of Oredezh by January 30. 18th Army finally abandoned Luga on February 12 just as forces of 67th Army prepared to envelop the town and the forward detachment of the 377th was approaching from the southeast.Glantz, Battle for Leningrad, pp. 359-63, 382-83 =Battle of Narva= By March 1 the 377th, still in 112th Corps with the 2nd Rifle Division, was reassigned to 8th Army in Leningrad Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 66 During March the Army was primarily involved in holding the line along the Narva River south to Lake Chud, but in April the 59th Army was replaced by the 8th in the Krivasoo bridgehead west of Narva. Prior to this transition the 377th was transferred to the withdrawing 59th, and as of May 1 was the only division in the Army.

Early career Born in 1854 at 16 Charing Cross Road in London as Edward Montague Compton Mackenzie, he was the fifth of nine children born to Charles Mackenzie, an actor known as Henry Compton (1805‚Äì1877), and Emmeline Catherine n√©e Montague (1823‚Äì1911). Edward Compton was educated at the private academy of Revd J. Gaitskell. His first stage appearance was in 1873 at the New Theatre Royal in Bristol as Long Ned in F. Boyle's Old London. In 1874 he joined the Francis Fairlie Touring Company for who he appeared in East Lynne by Alfred Kempe, in Progress by C. R. Munro and The School for Scandal by Richard Brinsley Sheridan, followed by seasons in Bristol, Glasgow, Kilmarnock, Liverpool and Birmingham. His first role in London was at his father's benefit at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in March 1877 in which he played Alfred Evelyn in Money by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, going on to appear in his father's second benefit in Manchester later in the same month. This was followed by appearances with the companies of Henry James Byron and Mrs Hermann Vezin.Gayle T. Harris, Edward Compton (1854-1918) - Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, accessed 25 April 2019 From 1877 to 1879 Compton toured the United Kingdom in the company of Ellen Wallis for whom he appeared as Michael Cassio in Othello, Malcolm in Macbeth, Romeo in Romeo and Juliet, Florizel in The Winter's Tale, Benedick in Much Ado About Nothing, Orlando in As You Like It, Master Wildrake in The Love Chase,Playbill for As You Like It at the New Theatre Royal, Bristol (1879) - Yale Center for British Art Collection Charles Surface in The School for Scandal and as Claude Melnotte in The Lady of Lyons by Edward Bulwer-Lytton. On 23 April 1879 he played Claudio in Much Ado About Nothing at the dedication of the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre at Stratford-upon-Avon. Later that year with his brother Charles he published the Memoir of Henry Compton. Compton Comedy Company David Garrick (1903) Compton joined the company of the Adelphi Theatre in London and from September 1979 to July 1880 he accompanied Adelaide Neilson on her successful tour of America, playing in New York, Boston, New Orleans and San Francisco. On completing the tour the company sailed from New York for London with Neilson continuing on to Paris to prepare for her forthcoming marriage to Compton arranged for September 1880. However, while driving in the Bois de Boulogne in August 1880 she suffered a ruptured aneurysm, dying a few hours later. In her will she left Compton ¬£2000. He returned to the Adelphi Theatre for a short period following which he used the bequest to set up the Compton Comedy Company which put on the plays of William Shakespeare and period English comedies across the country from 1881 to 1923. His leading lady was Virginia Frances Bateman (1853‚Äì1940), the daughter of the American actor H. L. Bateman.

Among other roles Compton played Malvolio in Twelfth Night (1881), Dr. Pangloss in The Heir At Law (1881), Mawworm in Isaac Bickerstaffe's The Hypocrite (1881), Jack Rover in Wild Oats (1882), Tony Lumpkin in She Stoops to Conquer (1882), Charles Surface in The School For Scandal (1883), Dromio of Syracuse in The Comedy of Errors (1883) and Bob Acres in The Rivals (1883).Edward Compton and The Compton Comedy Company By 1891 the Compton Comedy Company had been touring the UK for ten years and had given thousands of performances of such plays as Sheridan's The Rivals and The School for Scandal, The Road to Ruin by Thomas Holcroft, David Garrick by T. W. Robertson and She Stoops to Conquer by Oliver Goldsmith. Compton decided that the time was right to take his company to London, and he wrote to Henry James asking him to adapt his novel The American into a play for the stage - to which James agreed. Performed by the Compton Comedy Company, the play premi√®red in January 1891 in Southport with Compton playing Christopher Newman, the American, and was a financial and critical success. Failure Compton took The American to the Opera Comique in London on 26 September 1891, with himself again playing Christopher Newman, but the London audiences were unappreciative of the drama, finding the acting heavy-handed and the plot confusing and uneven. The critic of The Pall Mall Gazette wrote: > The audience was much amused and rather interested by the first act, less > amused and more interested by the second, still less amused and rather less > interested by the third, and not at all amused and barely interested by the > fourth. Then the curtain came down, the people kindly clapped their hands as > a means of stretching themselves, the actors appeared and bowed, ‚Ä¶ and those > in front of the curtain went away rather bored and much disappointed, while > those behind departed full of false hope.The Pall Mall Gazette, 28 September > 1891, pg. 2 Despite the attendance of The Prince of Wales at a performance and some reworking of the production The American closed on 4 December 1891 after only 69 performances and causing a great financial loss. Compton's son Sir Compton Mackenzie later described his father's reaction: > He realised that it was not his destiny to be a leading London actor-manager > and went back to the provinces where he was so much loved, and where in a > white wig instead of a toupee and with patches instead of a false moustache > he would be making much more money and doing far more for British drama than > by trying to establish himself in London.Compton Mackenzie, My Life and > Times, Octave 2 (1891-1900), Chatto & Windus (1963) pg. 22 Later years The grave of Edward Compton in Brookwood Cemetery After this failure the Compton Comedy Company returned to touring the provinces and Edward Compton together with Milton Bode bought several theatres in the provinces and suburbs of London. By August 1915 Compton was preparing to take his company back to London to appear at the Shaftesbury Theatre but he became ill and plans were put on hold. He died of throat cancer at his home, 54 Avonmore Road in West Kensington in London, on 16 July 1918 and was buried in Brookwood Cemetery in Surrey. The Compton Comedy Company continued to tour the United Kingdom until 26 July 1923 when it was disbanded due to the high cost of maintaining it.

It sat 400 yards below a 385-foot dam owned by Massey Energy.  Environmental hazards  Marsh Fork Elementary was threatened on two fronts. One is the coal dam that overlooked the school. If it were to fail it would result in 2.8 billion gallons of coal slurry crashing not only into the school, but also a 30 mile wide radius of the surrounding area. The second threat is a coal silo located only 150 feet away from the school that residents claim spews coal dust into the air. Parents of the children were concerned that their children were being exposed to the dust from the silo, with several parents having reported that their children were getting sick on a consistent basis after going to school.  Fighting for relocation  Concerned for the safety of their children, parents across Rock Creek began to protest having the coal dust silo located so close to their school. Due to the population size of Raleigh county and the poor attendance record of other schools in the county Marsh Fork was the only school parents could send their children to. One concerned grandfather, named Ed Wiley, was spurred into action after he and his wife noticed that their granddaughter was becoming sick on an increasing basis.It didn't take him long to find out that his granddaughter wasn't the only child who was sick on a regular basis. So he and several other concerned parents, working in tandem with activists like Appalachian Voices, Coal Mountain River Watch, Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition and others petitioned the school board for help. This petition caused the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection to test the school to see if any coal dust was present. The test came back negative for coal dust. It took two more tests for coal dust to finally appear on a test, though this test was conducted as part of an independent study by D. Scott Simonton, rather than by the state. Wiley felt this study would prompt some action by the state but nothing occurred. Following this Wiley decided to fund raise money for the relocation of the school, which he did by walking 455 miles on foot across two states to the office of Senator Robert C. Byrd on August 2, 2006. Even though Wiley gained the support of Byrd he still had an uphill battle, for funds had to be allocated for the relocation of the school. Most of the money would have had to come from a state source and not a federal one, due to it not being a federal issue; however when asbestos was found in the school there was hope this might change. Following no action by the federal government to provide funds Senator Byrd heavily criticized Massey Energy for knowingly building their silo so close to the school. Massey Energy fought these claims but eventually donated 1 million dollars towards the construction of the new school. This amount was further increased to 1.5 million, prompted by the Annenberg Foundation donation of 2.5 million.  Aftermath  After 5 years of raising money on December of 2012 10.7 million dollars were raised for the relocation of Marsh Fork. The funds came from several different sources including, the Raleigh County School Board which donated a total of 3.53 million, followed by the School Building Authority of West Virginia who gave 3.146 million, then the Annenberg Foundation at 2.5 million, then Alpha Natural Resources at 1.5 million, and finally 11,000 raised by the Pennies for Promises and Coal River Mountain Watch. The Marsh Fork Elementary would open its doors again to students and faculty a year later. The new Marsh Fork is located 3 miles away from the coal slurry dam.

The channel began in 2013, when Thorn sought to present philosophy for free following the 2012 increase in British tuition fees. His videos discuss philosophy through a left-wing perspective often informed by developments in contemporary politics. From 2018, the channel became more theatrical, making use of dramatic studio sets, costuming and makeup. Thorn has been positively received by critics, and as of October 2020 has around 752,000 subscribers. In 2019, Thorn hosted a livestream on Twitch in which he read plays from the Complete Works of Shakespeare for the mental health charity Samaritans. The stream lasted five days and featured guests. Thorn raised over ¬£100,000 for Samaritans. Early and personal life Born Oliver Lennard, Thorn is from Northumberland and has two older brothers. He attended the Royal Grammar School in Newcastle upon Tyne, where he was a member of an army cadets group. Taking Philosophy as an A-level alongside Biology and Chemistry, Thorn credits his discovery of the subject with his teacher. Thorn studied Philosophy and Theology at the University of St. Andrews, where he also participated in Mermaids and the St Andrews Revue. Thorn graduated with a first-class Scottish Master of Arts in Philosophy in 2015. He then trained at East 15 Acting School, completing a Master of Arts awarded by the University of Essex in 2017 before moving to London. In October 2019, Thorn discussed his sexuality in his YouTube video \\"Queer‚ú®\\", where he came out as bisexual and stressed his sexuality was trans-inclusive.  Career  = YouTube = Thorn in the 2019 video \\"Sex Work\\". His post-2018 content uses more elaborate costumes and production design than his earlier works. Thorn began his YouTube channel, Philosophy Tube, as an educational channel in 2013 in response to the university tuition fees tripling in the United Kingdom in 2012, rendering higher education less accessible. Thorn made it his mission statement to \\"[give] away a philosophy degree for free\\". Thorn originally planned to record his lectures and upload them, rather than appearing in videos, but his university would not allow this. His first video titled \\"I think therefore I am\\" about Ren√© Descartes was uploaded in May 2013. As of October 2020, the channel has 752,000 subscribers and the videos' cumulative view tally is 47 million. Thorn makes money from both YouTube advertisement revenue and crowdfunding on Patreon. Thorn in the 2019 video \\"Steve Bannon\\", which reviewer VanDerWerff said \\"effortlessly undercuts the former Trump adviser's entire shtick\\". The channel's style progressed over a period of years from a direct style of talking to the camera about the works of philosophers such as Descartes and Kant, to more theatrical productions. In 2016, Thorn took part in the YouTube NextUp, a week-long training programme for YouTubers with under 100,000 subscribers. Following attendance at the 2018 conference VidCon, Thorn decided to change his content creation, beginning to film at a studio with costumes and makeup. He also used props such as snakes and horses. Kayleigh Donaldson of Pajiba described Thorn's recent works as \\"long-form think-pieces\\" with \\"detailed production design\\", that use aspects of sketch comedy. Emily VanDerWerff of Vox summarised that the channel covers both philosophical topics and \\"sociopolitical ideas of the current era from a leftist point of view\\". For instance, a video beginning with the subject of Brexit becomes a discussion more broadly about democracy. Another video about former Trump advisor and Breitbart News co-founder Steve Bannon features Thorn performing a cover of a Hadestown song, with lyrics about Bannon. VanDerWerff praised that Thorn \\"undercuts [Bannon's] entire shtick\\". Thorn's 2018 video \\"Suic!de and Ment@l He@lth\\" discusses societal attitudes to mental health, along with his personal experiences: he has a history of self-harm and attempted suicide twice in his life. He said in mid-2019 that he still received at least one email per day by a person who said the video saved their life. Thorn's video \\"Men. Abuse. Trauma.\\" is about men and mental health, with reference to his personal experiences. The video is 35 minutes long, with the script entirely memorised by Thorn. There are no cuts or editing, and a single costume change is facilitated by a slow camera pan across the room; Thorn used the second of two takes. Both the script and the style of the video reference the 1944 Jean-Paul Sartre play No Exit. Emily VanDerWerff of Vox praised that the \\"tension and vulnerability that builds\\" is maintained by the lack of editing, and opined that in the video, \\"aesthetic form is inseparable from content\\". In July 2019, Thorn discussed his channel on the BBC radio show World Business Report. = Charity livestream = In 2019, Thorn, with the help of producers Isabella O'Hammon and Alice Quinn Rose, started a charity stream in which he aimed to read the Complete Works of Shakespeare in order to raise money for the Samaritans, a UK charity that helps people in emotional distress. Thorn chose the charity because he said that its telephone hotline \\"saved my life when I was considering suicide\\". He chose Shakespeare based on the idea that \\"Shakespeare features every human emotion\\", which he attributed to Judi Dench. The stream was inspired by a January 2019 video game stream by hbomberguy which raised ¬£278,000 ($340,000) for British charity Mermaids. It was announced at the end of his YouTube video \\"Men. Abuse. Trauma.\\", which was released in late July 2019. Streaming on Twitch, Thorn began on Friday 23 August and finished on Tuesday 27 August, streaming continuously with only a few hours per day for sleep. Many internet personalities joined Thorn to voice roles in the plays, including Mara Wilson, Dominique \\"SonicFox\\" McLean, Jim Sterling, Tom Scott, Hannah Witton, and Daniel Howell. Thorn announced on Twitter that the stream had raised ¬£109,447.54 (roughly $130,000) after PayPal currency conversion fees, with over 175,000 people watching the stream. Thorn said that he had only expected to raise between $2,000 and $5,000. The Royal Shakespeare Company praised Thorn for the endeavour, as did the Samaritans. =Other ventures= Thorn has written for publications such as HuffPost UK, The Independent, and Broadway Baby. He has done stand-up, voiceover work, and stage acting. In summer 2019, he played Claudio in the UK outdoor tour of Much Ado About Nothing.  Reception  In 2019, Dani Di Placido of Forbes praised that Thorn \\"doesn't tell you what to believe, but he prompts his audience to ask themselves why they believe the things they do.\\" Shannon Strucci, writing for the magazine Sight & Sound published by the British Film Institute, said that Thorn's videos \\"vary tremendously\\" in \\"tone and content\\". Strucci described the videos as \\"always well-researched, inventive, and theatrical\\". The German broadcaster Deutsche Welle praised the videos as entertaining and elaborate in design. Di Placido included Thorn on a list of \\"5 Fantastic YouTubers Fighting The Spread Of Alt-Right Propaganda\\", whilst the channel Philosophy Tube was recommended in the Slovak broadsheet SME. The Irish author and broadcaster Emma Dabiri has enjoyed Thorn's videos. VanDerWerff described the video \\"Men. Abuse. Trauma.\\" as \\"one of the best TV episodes of the year\\". Dan Schindel of Hyperallergic described the same video as a \\"riveting half-hour\\", praising its lack of cuts. The video was also praised by Luk√°≈° Pokorn√Ω in the Czech magazine A2. Thorn's video \\"Queer‚ú®\\" was one of 134 video essays included in Sight and Sound as one of the \\"best video essays of 2019\\".

It is located on the border between the wide Sharon Plain and the coast of Mount Carmel.Stern, 1978, p.1 Tel Mevorakh had four seasons of excavation in August and September of 1973‚Äì1975 and September 1976. The excavations were supervised by the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and headed by Ephraim Stern.Stern, 1978, p. v  Identification  The name \\"Tel Mevorakh\\" is the Hebrew variation of the original Arabic name \\"Tall al-Mubarak\\", which like the Hebrew name, means \\"Blessed Mound\\". The name has no traces in any written sources. One likely identification is \\"Crocodilompolis\\", mentioned in sources from the fourth century BCE. This settlement is named after the stream which is located next to. But Crocodilonpolis is usually identified with Tel Taninim, just west of Tel Mevorakh. Therefore, Tel Mevorakh hasn't been identified yet.Stern, 1978, pp.1-2  Geography  The mound is considered very small in comparison to other sites in the country. Its location, near the Mediterranean Coast, on the border between the wide Sharon plain and the narrow coast of Mount Carmel, which is bound by the mountain slopes to east and swamps to the west, has strategical significance as it makes it an obligatory passage for everyone who travels along the Via Maris international trade route from south to north and from north to south. The mound's position on the southern bank of the Taninim River is also important, as the small but steady stream provides the site with fresh water. Despite these important geographic benefits, the small size did not allow a significant settlement to exist in the site.  Archaeology  = Iron Age period = A structure from the late 11th century BCE was discovered, Pottery found there include much local pottery as well as a single jug of Phoenician origin. This structure was destroyed and a new structure dated the second half of the 10th century BCE was built on top of it. It is a four room house, a type of house associated with early Israelites. The large house underwent many changes and most of its bricks were plundered. It was encircled by an outer wall and was surrounded by a large court. Archaeologists believe it is a regional administrative center, connected to the nearby city of Dor. The pottery found here was local. Two fine cooking pots of special interest were found, one of which with the Paleo- Hebrew letter \\"Shin\\". Such cooking pots with letters such as \\"Shin\\" and \\"Samekh\\" were found in other sites including Tel Hazor in the Korazim Plateau, Tel Yokneam and Tel Qiri in the Jezreel Valley and in Tel Shikmona in Haifa. The meaning of these signs is obscure. A tomb, contemporary with the house was discovered northeast of the mound in 1966 during the construction of a pipeline. In addition to the local pottery, some pottery imported from Cyprus and Phoenicia was found both in the house and in the tomb.Stern, 1978, pp. 46, 48‚Äì49, 52, 66‚Äì67 = Persian period = The excavation has discovered three complete settlement layers from the Persian period. The bottom layer is a large deep pit. It is unclear whether the site was settled at this time, but the pottery inside the pit dates it to around 450 BCE. The middle layer contained a structure that covered the western side of the mound, which seems to have been a large farm. The pottery found there, which includes imported Greek pottery, allows us to date it to between 450 and 325 BCE. Most of the remains of the structure were lost due to the construction of a new structure, found at the top layer. This structure much larger than in the previous layer and extends beyond the excavation area. It was probably surrounded by casemate walls. The structure, which was probably an agricultural estate, is dated to between 350 and 333 BCE. The structure may have had towers and a second floor, but this is hard to determine, as it only survived to its foundations.Stern, 1978, pp.26-30 = Hellenistic period = Between the Persian settlement and the Hellenistic settlement, there seems to be a gap of a century. The Hellenistic layer of the mound was badly damaged by erosion, due to a long time of abandonment, as well as the crusader and Muslim graves dug deep into the mound. N. Makhouly noted in 1924 that the looting of the stones from this period continued in his days. The Hellenistic period is divided into two phases of construction, both dated to around the 2nd century BCE. The pottery found in this layer is mostly Hellenistic and seems to be replicas either locally made or imported from nearby mediterranean regions such as Egypt, Syria and Turkey. The poor state of the layer doesn't allow us to see the plan of the settlement. The remains can be seen as part of a masonry.Stern, 1978, pp.22-25 =Roman and Byzantine periods= Tel Mevorakh and its surroundings were incorporated into the territory of the city of Caesarea, which was built by Herod the Great in the first century CE. It seems the site was deserted during these periods. Only a few isolated finds such as potsherds and coins were found. All of these were probably dumped by the citizens of Caesarea, who worked in the region. These pottery and coins date to all of the Roman and Byzantine periods. The only architectural discovery is a wall, on the northern slope, dated to the Roman period, whose purpose is not clear.Stern, 1978, pp.11-13, 21 There are two structures in the immediate vicinity of the mound from the Roman period. The first is a mausoleum, built inside a big cemetery on the mounds eastern slope. The mausoleum was excavated by N. Makhouly in 1924. The ashlar-built structure contained two sculptured marble Sarcophagi, decorated with scenes from Greek mythology. The Mausoleum seems to belong to a wealthy family and it is dated to the 3rd century CE. The second structure is part of an aqueduct which served as part of Caesarea's water supply. It runs some 100 meters south of the mound. It was constructed by Herod the Great and was rebuilt by Hadrian. On part of the aqueduct, there are inscriptions of the Legio X Fretensis, one with an insignia as well as depictions of Nike and Atlas, two figures from the Greek mythology. Inscriptions of Legio VI Ferrata, Legio II Traiana Fortis and another unknown legion were also discovered. = Crusader-Muslim cemetery = The mound's summit is covered with graves. A total of 42 graves were excavated, and there are probably many others not found. The mound probably used as a cemetery for a long time, as the earliest graves are attributed to the Crusaders and the latest to the 19th century AD. The mound was used by the Arab villagers of the nearby Jisr az-Zarqa village as a graveyard. The graves can be divided into four types: Simple cist graves, dug into the soft soil, which amount to about a dozen; Rectangular cist graves, surrounded by stone slabs, which were probably from the Roman remains. These graves were dug deep and damaged some of the earlier layers. They included mostly the skeletons of adults. In one of the graves, a silver crusader coin attributed to Amaury I of Jerusalem (AD 1162-1174). The grave included three glass plaquettes, probably used as superstitious or magical items. They were dated to the 12th or 13th century AD. Some of the graves included some jewelry made of iron, bronze, glass and some semi-precious stones. This kind of jewelry usually belong to Arab peasants (Fellah) or nomads (Bedouin); One grave has a different shape than all others, as it was covered by small stones and contained the skeleton of an adult. The last group of graves were jar burials of four children. These burials are probably the latest in the site and are dated to the mid-19th century AD. All of the graves were oriented east-west when the bodies are facing south, towards Mecca, in accordance to Muslim tradition.Stern, 1978, pp.4-8 References Bibliography *Ephraim Stern, \\"Excavations at Tel Mevorakh (1973‚Äì1976).

At over 11.5 acres they are the second largest allotment site in the London Borough of Haringey (who also owns them). As with nearly all allotment sites in the borough it is (mostly) run by the site's association, the Golf Course Allotment's Association (GCAA). History The land was once farmland, as was most of this part of North London. Bluebell Wood, which is next door to the allotments, once formed part of an ancient wood called Tottenham Wood. It is possible that this same wood once covered the allotments. In 1893 the Muswell Hill Golf Club was founded. The club had a course that covered the allotment site. During the First World War they were forced to give up the lease on part of the course for allotment gardening. The golf club never got the land back after the war, and the allotments have been there since. The GCAA was originally founded in the 1940s as a local allotment and horticultural society with the betterment of allotment sites as an aim. Over time it focused on the Golf Course Allotments over others, subsequently changing its name to reflect this. The site today Today the allotment has over 230 plots gardened by over 250 tenants. There is a shop for plot holders, a composting toilet, and a community hall. Throughout the year are events such as caf√©s and parties which raise funds to improve the site. The site is open to the public one day a year during the Summer Show. Normally held in early September, the Show is opened with the National Gardens Scheme.

It serves as the group's comeback album, their first in fourteen years, following the release of 2005's Mil e Uma Noites. The album was the first commercial album release to feature the group's original lineup since Luciana Andrade left in 2004. Rouge collaborated with production team Head Media.  Background and recording  After returning to a concerts of the tour Ch√° Rouge - and later 15 Anos Tour -, the Rouge decided to launch a new song to commemorate the fifteen years of existence in homage to the fans. On February 5 is released \\"Bailando\\", track that followed the Latin pop previously used in \\"Brilha La Luna\\", combined with a fun and unpretentious composition, but also presented a new visual identity of the most sensual group. The track served as a bridge between the sound they made earlier and what they were willing to do at that moment, linking the public before with a modern outfit that would not be the one of the contemporary artists. In March 2018, surprised by the repercussion and acceptance of the public with \\"Bailando\\", the group decided to go into the studio to record a new material, but this time it would bring a maturation and a greater seriousness, since the previous track had been only commemorative, without great pretensions. For the new phase, they announced that they were selecting repertoire and open to meet new composers who wanted to work with them together. In addition, Umberto Tavares, songwriter of \\"Bailando\\", and the British Eliot Kennedy, songwriter of \\"Um Anjo Veio Me Falar\\", came in contact with the members to offer new songs. Soon after the group revealed that it had already recorded several songs and was in the process of choosing which would be used as the first single of the new project. On June 10, Li Martins revealed that the group had recorded reggaeton \\"Solo Tu\\": \\"It has a reggaeton, sensual, Latin footprint. It is very close to \\"Bailando.\\" On September 6, the group announced the release of an extended play (EP) before the entire album exclusively in Todo Seu, Gazeta TV, opting for the program to tell the information because Ronnie Von was the only one to open space for the members to divulge their solo works during the period that the group had closed the activities. On October 2, the group announced the title of the EP in social networks as 5, in reference to the fact that it is their fifth unpublished work, in addition to containing five tracks, revealing that the launch would be in the day 8 of that month.  Music and lyrics  Les 5inq's songs are predominantly pop, R&B; and reggaeton, fusing elements of trap, Latin pop with funk carioca, differing from the other albums of the group for not betting on traditional, dance-pop and bubblegum pop, with teenage lyrics. \\"Solo Tu\\" was originally written by Dutch singer Emy Perez, whose Fantine Th√≥ became friends during the fourth season of The Voice of Holland (2013), and shown to her during a trip to Amsterdam in December 2017 in case she was interested in recording with the group. In Brazil, a team of composers were responsible for translating the Dutch parts of the track into Portuguese, mixing with phrases in Spanish and English, focusing on Latin pop and reggaeton for production. In spite of the ready band, Th√≥ revealed that she believed she was still missing something, coming up with the idea of introducing a rap in Spanish during the last stanza while taking a shower, claiming that she had run out of the house to record it on her mobile phone so as not to forget. \\"Beijo na Boca\\" brought a more sensual theme, blending the funk carioca with R&B; and trap, according to the portal Popline, escape the obvious of the tracks of the funk genre to sound more sophisticated, without explicit appeal and without phrases with words beaten like \\"to roll\\" and \\"butt\\". The rapper Vit√£o, who composed the initial sketch of the track, recorded the demo to introduce to the girls, but ended up being invited to join them as a special guest in the final version after they noticed that a rapper would fit the proposal well. \\"Dona da Minha Vida\\" brought a political composition about female empowerment and abusive relationships, betting on a more serious and sober production than the rest of the album by mixing trap and soul with the more urban R&B;, inspired by the urban sound of singers like Alicia Keys and Beyonc√©. The song \\"Sem Temer\\", different from the group's traditional ballad's like \\"Um Anjo Veio Me Falar\\" and \\"Sem Voc√™\\", has an atmosphere that remembers the band of pagode Sampa Crew, according to the members, and was also described by Lu Andrade as the album's most popular song and one of their most mature tracks. Lyrically, the song addresses a more adult view of love. The last track of the EP, \\"Te Ligo Depois\\", focused on the dancing R&B; and the five members' choirs, with high notes and traditional girl groups, referring to the group's more relaxed sound in the first phase and inspiring the sound of Beyonce's \\"Crazy in Love\\".  Critical reception  Les 5inq's received mixed reviews from music critics. Robson Gomes of Jornal do Commercio received the album favorably with some caveats, highlighting the songs \\"Solo Tu\\", calling it \\"solar\\"; \\"Beijo na Boca\\", highlighting the vocals of Li Martins; \\"N√£o √© N√£o\\" and \\"Dona da Minha Vida\\", because of their empowered lyrics; \\"Te Ligo Depois\\" on account of vocal harmony; and \\"Como Se Fosse a Primeira Vez\\", evidencing the interpretation of Fantine Th√≥. On the other hand, the critic pointed out that \\"Good Vibes\\" is not a strong point of the album, that \\"Juntinho\\" does not measure up to the artist Aline Wirley is, and that \\"Sou Mais Eu\\" has lyrics that do not favor the song very much. On the other hand, Jurandir Dalcin of Portal Comenta evaluated the album with 3 of 5 stars, highlighting \\"Dona da Minha Vida\\" and \\"Como Se Fosse a Primeira Vez\\" as the best of the album, and noting that \\"Les 5inq is a medium album and this is the fault of previous works that were very the fact that each one has a solo track was a differential, but could have a two or three tracks the more in group, since this one has great chances to be the last album of the five.\\" Singles \\"Dona da Minha Vida\\" was the lead single released on the album on August 31, 2018, differing from the previous work of the group for being focused on R&B; with elements of trap and soul. The music video of the track, besides the themes proposed by the letter itself, also expresses the struggle of other aspects, such as transphobia, gophobia and violence against women, combating discrimination by uniting people of different ethnicities and sexual orientations, besides presenting a heterosexual kiss between a transgender girl and a cisgender boy. \\"Solo Tu\\" was chosen by the fans as the second single from the Les 5inq, through a vote in Spotify, being released on January 18, 2019.

Photo taken during the Guadeloupe Conference which took place from 4 to 7 January 1979 Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Ebrahim Yazdi, Sadegh Ghotbzadeh and other members of Khomeini's retinue giving a press conference at Khomeini's residence in Neauphle-le-Ch√¢teau near Paris, France In 2016, the BBC published a report which stated that the administration of United States President Jimmy Carter (1977-1981) had extensive contact with Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and his entourage in the prelude to the Iranian Revolution of 1979. The report was based on \\"newly declassified US diplomatic cables\\". According to the report, as mentioned by The Guardian, Khomeini \\"went to great lengths to ensure the Americans would not jeopardise his plans to return to Iran - and even personally wrote to US officials\\". According to the report, in turn, Carter and his administration helped Khomeini and made sure that the Imperial Iranian army would not launch a military coup. The BBC report also showed a 1980 CIA analysis, which portrays Khomeini's attempts to contact the US as far back as 1963, during John F. Kennedy's administration. Iran's political √©lite has dismissed these declassified reports. Ayatollah Khamenei stated that \\"it was based on fabricated documents\\". Ebrahim Yazdi (formerly a close associate of Khomeini) and Saeed Hajjarian viewed the BBC report with skepticism. November 1978 ‚Äì January 1979 Picture of Robert E. Huyser A declassified cable shows that on 9 November 1978, William H. Sullivan, then-US ambassador to Iran alerted the Carter administration of the Shah being \\"doomed\\". Sullivan stated that the US should get Iran's Shah and his most senior generals to exit the country, and construct an agreement between secondary commanders and Ruhollah Khomeini. In January 1979, General Robert E. Huyser was dispatched to Iran. According to the narrative of Carter's government, Huyser was sent to promise US support for the Shah. However, the declassified reports show that Huyser was in fact sent to Iran in order to prevent the Iranian military leaders from orchestrating a coup in order to save the Shah. He was also reportedly tasked with convincing the Iranian military leaders to meet Mohammad Beheshti, Khomeini's second in command. Huyser was soon faced with accusations of neutralizing the Iranian military and for paving the way for Khomeini's ascension to power. However, Huyser himself always strongly denied these claims. Huyser's reports to Washington have not yet been published. In the meantime, US ambassador William Sullivan actively worked behind the scenes in order to undermine the Shah's Prime Minister, Shapour Bakhtiar: On 9 January 1979, David L. Aaron told to Zbigniew Brzezinski to target Bakhtiar with a military coup and then form a deal between Iran's military leaders and Khomeini's entourage which would remove the Shah from power. On 14 January 1979, with the Shah's government still in power, Cyrus Vance sent a message to the American embassies in France and Iran: On 15 January 1979, Warren Zimmermann, an official of Carter's government in France, met with Ebrahim Yazdi in Paris. Zimmermann met with Yazdi on two more occasions in Paris, the last meeting being on 18 January 1979. Meanwhile, on 16 January 1979, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi had left Iran; suffering from terminal cancer, he had been told by Carter a few days earlier, on 11 January 1979, to \\"leave promptly\\". On 27 January 1979, Khomeini told the US just weeks before the overthrow of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's government: In mid-to-late January 1979, according to the declassified documents, Carter's government de facto admitted that it would have no issues with the abolishment of the Iranian monarchy and its military, whom were having daily talks with Huyser ‚Äî as long as the eventual result would come gradually and in a controlled way. Khomeini and his entourage now realized that Carter had discarded Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. February 1979 Two days before Khomeini's return from France, commander-in-chief Abbas Gharabaghi told Khomeini's entourage that the Iranian military was not against political alterations, particularly with regard to \\"the cabinet\\". On 1 February 1979, Khomeini arrived in Tehran. By 5 February 1979, the Iranian military was not resistant to changes in the type of government anymore, as long as these changes were conducted \\"legally and gradually\\". By this point, junior officers and conscripts deserted and a mutiny erupted in the Air Force. On 11 February 1979, Iran's military leaders, behind Shapour Bakhtiar's back, declared neutrality, which de facto meant that they had surrendered. Gary Sick, former member of the National Security Council during the period of the Islamic revolution has stated to The Guardian that \\"the documents [shown by the BBC] are genuine\\". However he added that he was unaware of Khomeini's alleged attempts to get into contact with the US back in 1963.

This plant is very like Fontainea picrosperma, but differs in that it has 13-15 lateral veins on either side of the midrib versus 8-12; the base of the petiole is not swollen (vs swollen for F. picrosperma); the style is longer (3-3.5 mm vs 0.8-2 mm); the calyx of the male flower has four-five lobes (versus 2-3 lobes); and the faces between the sutures of the endocarp are wider (12-13 mm versus 7-10 mm for F. picrosperma. Distribution and habitat Fontainea subpapuana is known only from the Central Province in south-east Papua New Guinea, in lowland rainforest on river flats. Taxonomy and naming The plant was first described by Paul Irwin Forster in \\"Three new species of Fontainea Heckel (Euphorbiaceae) from Australia and Papua New Guinea\\". The holotype K000959474 was collected by H.

Short after its creation it became subordinated to the Wehrmacht. Yet, its major mission remained in support of OT, which at this time was mainly engaged in rebuilding and repair of bomb damaged industrial facilities and housing complexes. Transportkorps Speer was organized in motor transportation battalions and regiments, supported by depot, repair, engineering, signal, and medical units. Creation The Nationalsozialistisches Kraftfahrkorps (NSKK) supplied the motor vehicle transportation for the Organisation Todt, the civil and military engineering organization in Nazi Germany, until 1944. The NSKK- Transportbrigade Todt was in charge of motor transportation for the construction of the Siegfried Line. NSKK-Transportbrigade Speer was in charge of the motor transportation for the air base constructions of the OT. Foreign drivers were recruited into the Legion Speer, since they - as aliens - could not be members of the NSKK, which was a sub-organization of the Nazi Party. In 1942, Transportbrigade Todt, Transportbrigade Speer, and Legion Speer, was subsumed into an umbrella organization, Transportgruppe Todt, which in 1944 was made into an organization independent of the NSKK, the Transportkorps Speer. On 12 September 1944, Transportkorps Speer was transferred to Wehrmacht control. Mission In the fall of 1944, most of the OT was withdrawn from occupied Europe to Germany proper, the Reich area. It new task was rebuilding and repair of bomb damaged industrial facilities and housing complex. Mobility was of outmost importance, and the primary OT-units were assigned motor vehicles from Transportkorps Speer. The lack of vehicles prevented the secondary OT-units from being motorized. The Ministry of Armament, the Luftwaffe, and the German Army also had Transportkorps Speer units attached. The OT was, however, its largest employer. Of Transportkorps Speer's 50,000 motor vehicles, 40,000 were assigned the OT. Organisation Transportkorps Speer was a separate agency closely working with the OT; mutual salutes were to be exchanged between members of both organizations. The OT was serviced by a number of Kraftwagentransportabteilungen (motor vehicle transportation battalions). Transportregiment (Transport Regiment) 2 and 3 served the Luftwaffe. Transport Regiment 5-12, the German Army. In addition, there were Ersatzabteilungen (Depot Battalions), Kraftfahrinstandesetzungsregimenter (Vehicle Repair Regiments), Pionierabteilung (Engineering Battalion), Nachrichtenstaffel (independent signal company), Sanit√§tskraftfahrstaffel (independent medical company), and an Sicherungssabteilung (Escort Battalion). The higher organization of the Transportkorps Speer was originally made up of eight Abschnitte (sectors). In August 1944, four division-level Inspektionen (inspections) replaced the eight sectors, while in February 1945, the four inspections were replaced by six Intendante (supply commands). As late as in April 1945, the remnants of Transportkorps Speer was reorganized as three brigades; one for Norway, Denmark, and northern Germany; one for central Germany and the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia; and one for Ostmark, northern Italy, and northern Yugoslavia. Disbandment Transportkorps Speer ceased to function as an operational organization before Germany capitulated. At the end of the war, all of its vehicles that were not taken over by the Wehrmacht, were standing still due to the lack of fuel.

The show celebrated the 39th Anniversary of the construction of Arena Naucalpan, IWRG's main venue. The main event was a three-team Relevos Suicida, losers advance, match with the first team to lose being forced to immediately wrestle each other for their masks, under Luchas de Apuestas (\\"bet match\\") rules. The team of Pantera I and Killer Jr. lost to the teams of Golden Magic/Pirata Morgan Jr. and Imposible/Rel√°mpago. In the end Pantera I pinned Killer Jr. forcing him to unmask afterward. Another featured match saw Pirata Morgan defeat M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. in a \\"hair vs. hair\\" match and was shaved bald. In the second match of the night Las Tortugas Ninja (Leo, Mike, and Rafy) successfully defended the Distrito Federal Trios Championship against Cerebro Negro and Los Oficiales (Oficial AK-47, and Oficial Fierro). Production =Background= Promoter Adolfo Moreno had promoted Lucha Libre, or professional wrestling in Naucalpan, State of Mexico, Mexico prior to financing the building of Arena Naucalpan that opened in late 1976. Originally Moreno worked together with the Universal Wrestling Association (UWA) and then later Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) as a local promoter. On January 1, 1996 Moreno created International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG) as an independent promotion. IWRG celebrates the anniversary of Arena Naucalpan each year in December with a major show, making it the second oldest, still promoted show series in the world. pre-dating WrestleMania by eight years. Only the CMLL Anniversary Show series has a longer history. The 2015 Arena Naucalpan anniversary show will mark the 38th Anniversary of Arena Naucalpan. The Anniversary shows, as well as the majority of the IWRG shows in general are held in Arena Naucalpan. =Storylines= The event featured six professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre- existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. The main event of the 39th anniversary show was originally announced as a two-team Relevos Suicida, losers advance, match between the teams of Pantera I/Killer Jr. and Golden Magic/Pirata Morgan Jr. while Imposible and Rel√°mpago were scheduled to face off in a singles match as part of their ongoing storyline.Poster has the originally announced matches. Killer Jr. did not show up for the IWRG show on the Sunday prior to the show, so officials announced that the match was changed to have Impossible and Rel√°mpago replace Pantera I and Killer Jr. By show time the match was changed back to the original match, but Impossible demanded to be in the match, changing it to a three-team match instead. Event In the opening match the trio of Aram√≠s, Black Drag√≥n, and Drag√≥n Fly defeated Ara√±a de Plata, Demonio Infernal, and Skanda, two falls to one. The second match was originally scheduled to have Oficial 911 join his tag team partners Oficial AK-47 and Oficial Fierro as Los Oficiales challenged Las Tortugas Ninja (Leo, Mike and Rafy) for the Distrito Federal Trios Championship, but on the night of the show Cerebro Negro took his place in the match. Las Tortugas retained the championship, making their fourth successful defense. Prior to the third match Trauma I was recognized as the \\"IWRG Wrestler of the year\\" based on a fan vote on Facebook. The match was won by Danny Casas, Mr. Electro, and Veneno defeated Eterno, Heddi Karaoui, and Trauma I in a match where Mr. Electro and Trauma I fought most of the time outside the ring. Afterward, Mr. Electro challenged Trauma I and his brother Trauma II to a Lucha de Apuestas match against himself and his brother Sharlie Rockstar. For the fourth match of the night Pirata Morgan was accompanied to the ring by his son Pirata Morgan Jr. for the hair vs. hair match. After Morgan and M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. split the first two falls between them, Pirata Morgan Jr. helped his father out, allowing Pirata Morgan to pin M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. while holding on to the ropes for leverage. Afterwards, M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. was forced to let a barber shave all his hair off as a result of his loss. The first team to be pinned in the three-team Relevos suicida would immediately have to fight each other for their masks. For the main event long-time rivals Golden Magic and Pirata Morgan Jr. and Imposible and Rel√°mpago both put their differences aside for this match, allowing them to defeat Killer Jr. and Pantera I. The two faced off in a one fall match that saw both wrestlers bleed significantly as each fought for their mask. In the end Pantera I won the match, forcing Killer Jr. to unmask. After his loss Killer Jr. announced that his name was Julian Hernandez Quiroz, that he had been a wrestler for 25 years at that point. Aftermath Killer Jr. made sporadic appearances for IWRG after unmasking, participating in the 2017 Rebeli√≥n de los Juniors tournament, and the 2017 Rey del Ring. The two teams that survived the main event (Golden Magic, Pirata Morgan Jr., Impossible and Rel√°mpago) all faced off in the main event of IWRG's next major show, the January Prisi√≥n Fatal show. In he match Impossible defeated Pirata Morgan Jr., forcing him to unmask as a result and state his real name. The feud between the two concluded at the February M√°scara vs. Cabellera show, where Golden Magic finally pinned his opponent, to earn the right to shave all Pirata Morgan Jr.'s hair off.

American Primitive  The title of the collection may refer to an art style known as American Primitive art, or Na√Øve art. This is a type of art created by someone with little or no formal training. Oliver herself attended college but did not earn a degree . Naive art also focuses on simplicity over subtlety and Oliver has been quoted as saying that Poetry \\"mustn't be fancy\\" but should instead be clear. ‚ÄúIn Blackwater Woods‚Äù comes third to last in this collection. In 1984 the collection won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry.  Critical reception  Much of Oliver's work was criticized for its \\"traditional\\" subject matter of nature and God, however her work was widely read and well known in America. Oliver's work resonated with Americans because it was able to look at systems of nature and derive truths about spiritual questions from them and present those truths in an accessible way. Her work has recently been reexamined and praised for its ability to examine the point of view of nonhuman subjects while still maintaining an awareness of the limitations of looking at those subjects from a human perspectiveGraham, Vicki. ‚Äú\`Into the Body of Another‚Äô: Mary Oliver and the Poetics of Becoming Other.‚Äù Papers on Language & Literature, vol. 30, no. 4, Fall 1994, p. 352.

Membership is a mark of excellence in science and one of the highest honors that a scientist can receive.  NAS members and foreign associates  Three types of NAS membership exist: # Voting members, who must hold citizenship of the United States # Nonvoting foreign associates, who have citizenship outside the United States # Emeritus members, who are no longer active and have rescinded their voting rights there were 2,382 active members and 484 foreign associates, of whom approximately 190 have received Nobel Prizes. A full list of members can be found in the online members directory. See the list of members of the National Academy of Sciences and :Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences for examples. = Notable member firsts = Some notable member firsts and records include: * Edward C. Pickering (1846‚Äì1919) was the youngest scientist elected, only 26 years old at the time of his election in 1873 * Florence R. Sabin (1871‚Äì1953) was the first woman to be elected a member in 1924 * David Blackwell (1919‚Äì2010) was the first African American elected in 1965 * Marcia McNutt was the first woman to serve as president of the NAS, following her election as a member in 2005. * Ben Barres (1954‚Äì2017) was the first transgender scientist elected in 2013 * Frances Arnold was the first woman to be elected to all three National Academies in the United States ‚Äì the National Academy of Engineering (NAE, 2000), the National Academy of Medicine (NAM, 2004) and the National Academy of Sciences (NAS, 2008) * Richard Feynman resigned his NAS membership because of what he perceived as the Academy's elitism and in-group favoritism. Feynman outlines the reasons for his resignation in his published correspondence Perfectly Reasonable Deviations from the Beaten Track. = Member diversity = Critics have pointed to a lack of member diversity because of a selection bias for ‚Äúold white men‚Äù who dominate membership of the Academy. Elite institutions such as the from Ivy League, MIT, Stanford, the University of California and Caltech also dominate membership, thereby perpetuating the Matthew effect. Diversity of age, disability, race, religion, gender and sexual orientation is lower in NAS than in the general population. For example, women in science are an underrepresented group in the Academy but the proportion of female members is slowly growing. * In 1989, the academy had just 57 female members and 1,516 male members (3% female in total) * In 2010, there were 14 newly elected women (19% new female inductees) from 72 new members * In 2011, there were only 9 women (12% new female inductees) from 72 newly elected members. * In 2012, the Academy elected 84 new members, with a record high of 26 women (30% new female inductees) * In 2019, 50 women out of 125 new members were female (40% of new female inductees), another record high although the proportion of women in the academy as a whole is much lower than 40% Persons of color, African Americans and Hispanics are also underrepresented. In 2019, the academy was considering expelling members for sexual harassment.  Nomination and election of new members  New members and foreign associates have been elected annually since 1863. Membership can not be applied for as only voting academicians can submit formal nominations for newly elected members, for preferential voting in an annual ballot of members every March. Candidates for membership are considered by peer review and voted for again through several rounds of balloting and a final annual ballot in April at the annual general meeting (AGM) of the academy with results announced shortly after, usually early May. Each nomination includes a curriculum vitae (CV) with a 250 word summary of the nominee's scientific archievements, the basis for election and a list of no more than 12 of their most important papers published in scientific journals. The publication limit of 12 aims to focus assessment on the quality of a nominee's work, rather than the quantity of publications. , a maximum of 100 members may be elected annually. Non-citizens of the USA are elected as foreign associates, with a maximum of 25 elected annually. Both members and foreign associates are affiliated with one of six scientific disciplines: # Physical science and mathematical sciences # Biological sciences # Engineering and applied sciences # Biomedical sciences # Behavioural sciences and social sciences # Applied Biological, agricultural science and environmental sciences On election, members are invited to an annual awards ceremony.  Member biographies  Since 1966, newly elected members of the National Academy of Sciences have been invited to contribute an inaugural year article (IYA) to Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS) which is accompanied by a brief biography of the author.

She was owned by \\"a group of wealthy Baltimore investors.\\" Under Captain Thomas Boyle, who was a part owner of the schooner, Comet sailed from July 1812 to March 1814 as a privateer, which was a type of ships licensed by the United States during the War of 1812 to harass the British merchant vessels and divest their cargoes.  Construction  Comet was built by Thomas Kemp of Baltimore, Maryland for Captain William Furlong, who made a series of payments of $1,505. Captain Thorndike Chase paid the rest of the total cost of $3,630 in 1810, bringing his share in the schooner to a little more than half. Career = First and Second Cruises = Comet started her career as a privateer on 12 July 1812 under the command of Thomas Boyle. At first she harassed many British vessels in the Caribbean Sea. Just two weeks into her cruise as a privateer, on 26 July 1812, she took her first prize. Her second voyage was off the coast of South America. The cruise was less successful as the prize ships she was able to capture were all retaken by the British before able to reach the United States. Comet went back into the home port of Baltimore through fog at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay, successfully running the British blockade on 17 March 1813. = Charter of U.S. Navy = Between April and September 1813, Comet, together with three other Baltimore privateers, Revenge, Patapsco and Wasp, was chartered by the U.S. Navy for reconnaissance in the Chesapeake Bay area, with Thomas Boyle remaining in command as a sailing Master of Comet. By the end of August, all four were released from patrol duty and Comet again put to sea on 29 October 1813, returning to Beaufort, North Carolina. = Third Cruise and Engagement with Hibernia = Boyle took the Comet on a third privateering cruise, which lasted until March 1814. On 11 January 1814, Comet encountered Hibernia, who carried 22 men and six guns on board. Two days before Comet had encountered the British merchantman Wasp west of Saba, but had sailed away when Wasp gave chase, fearing that Wasp was a warship. This time Captain Boyle was ready to take his prize. After an intense 9-hour single-ship action Hibernia succeeded in driving Comet offNaval Chronicle, Vol. 31, p.192. and left the field. Comet had three men killed and sixteen wounded. The reports of the wounded and killed on Hibernia vary greatly, depending on the side reporting the numbers. A British source reports one dead and 11 wounded, as one American book lists that eight men were killed and 13 were wounded. (The former probably is more reliable in its reporting.) As to the schooner, Comet was completely demasted and had 28 wounds in her hall with water pouring in. After overnight jury rigging, she retired to Puerto Rico and stayed there for a three-week refit. Hibernia arrived at St Thomas's that same day.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4852. Comet wasn't fit for further duties as a privateer and Boyle took a command of another famous Baltimore privateer, Chasseur. The 1812-1814 cruises were documented by a crew member and a relative of Thomas Boyle in a book. = Later career = Little is known of Comets career after her years as a privateer. On 12 May 1814 she was sold at Charleston, South Carolina to New York owners. Another account report that she was purchased in 1815 by Thomas Boyle, owning 50% of the schooner, and the rest was owned by another two crew members of the 1812-1814 cruise.

Both nations are members of the United Nations and the World Trade Organization. History Between 1942‚Äì1944, 18,000 Polish refugees arrived to the Kenyan port city of Mombasa and taken to the territory of Tanganyika (known as Tanzania today). The refugees were part of a larger exodus of between 320,000 to a million Polish evacuees who were forced out of Poland by the Soviet Union during World War II and sent to the eastern parts of the Soviet Union and Siberia. With the assistance of Anders' Army, approximately 110,000 Polish evacuees left the Soviet Union to Persia and 18,000 of those refugees were sent to East Africa. While in Tanganyika, the refugees were sent to settlement camps in Ifunda, Kigoma, Kidugala, Kondoa, Morogoro and Tengeru. The refugees would remain in Tanganyika until 1949 when many were resettled to Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. Diplomatic relations between Poland and Tanzania were established in 1961. In 1962, Poland opened a resident embassy in Dar es Salaam. In 1987, Tanzanian Foreign Minister Benjamin Mkapa paid an official visit to Poland. The Polish embassy was closed in 2008, and Poland was accredited to Tanzania from its embassy in Nairobi, Kenya. In 2003, Benjamin Mkapa returned to Poland as President of Tanzania. In 2012, Poland opened an honorary consulate in Tanzania and in 2018, Poland re-opened its embassy in Dar es Salaam, nine years since its closure. The re-opening of the embassy was presided by Polish Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz and Tanzanian Foreign Minister Augustine Mahiga.

It comes from the term bycatch, which is used in fishing practices to designate non-target species that are caught in a fishing net. Nearly every remote monitoring study contains human by-catch, yet there are no standardized rules or policies regarding what the researchers can or should do with their data.  Camera traps  Camera on cottonwood tree = Description and uses = Camera traps are typically a large network of cameras that are set up in the environment to capture images of wildlife. Most camera traps have some sort of sensor to trigger the shutter; usually by movement or heat (infrared). They are used widely in conservation work, by field biologists, and, to a lesser extent, by hobbyists, and hunters. Camera traps end up with many false triggers, such as moving vegetation, false heat reading from warm wind, and accidental human capture. These types of monitoring systems will, by design, capture and retain many photos of people. Camera trapping is still very human-intensive work, requiring a lot of effort to go through the thousands of images that are collected. Camera traps are useful tools for both land and marine conservation, environmental and wildlife management, and environmental law enforcement. By placing high resolution cameras along the shoreline, a network of cameras are able to monitor illegal fishing practices in protected, no-fish areas. Camera traps are not limited to the land; they are even used underwater, and, similar to land-based camera traps, use an automatic trigger when movement is detected in view of the frame. They are utilized at airports to help prevent incidents of wildlife collisions with aircraft. Camera traps are even used in elementary education settings, helping to bring young students closer to the natural world around them. By taking advantage of night vision technology, the students can learn about and see wildlife in their school yard that they never would have been able to see, before. Field research biologists generally try to locate their cameras away from areas of high human traffic, because increased presence of humans generally has a negative correlation with presence of wildlife. = Privacy concerns = Most people associate going \\"into the wild\\" with a reasonable expectation of privacy. It is not uncommon for hikers and backpackers to engage in private behavior, as in, something they would not want others to see, such as urinating. Private behaviors such as this have been caught on many camera traps. In fact, because humans are so abundant, and the areas that need conservation focus are usually areas in which humans share with the target species or habitat, nearly every study using camera traps has ended up with human by-catch. It is not uncommon for researchers to end up with more photos of humans than of their target species. There are instances of a by- catch photo of a coworker urinating, or similar situations, being saved and posted publicly as a joke. By-catch photos of people engaging in activity that may or may not be illegal, but undesired, has been posted publicly to influence the people in the study area to act differently. The line between a joke, a well-intentioned push for better behavior, and invasion of privacy, is thin. There are already potential solutions on the market. The technology to automatically flag, blur, or remove photos containing humans exists, and will only improve with time. While there are no broad requirements to do so, individual organizations could make this policy.  Drones  Quadcopter camera drone in flight = Description and uses = Drones are unoccupied aircraft vehicles that are remotely controlled by a person. While often associated with military use, the decreasing cost of the technology has allowed for civil use of drones to grow. Drones are being increasingly used in the fields of resource management and conservation because of their light weight and small stature, and their speed. They also have reduced risk of injury and death when compared to traditional field biologist aerial surveys, and are less invasive than humans in the field. Drones are beneficial in a variety of environments, including marine. Because of their speed and ease of setup to take off, they can quickly be launched to record identifying data of boats illegally fishing in protected areas. The altitude at which drones fly allows nearly non-invasive observation of marine wildlife. Because of the ability to follow quick moving wildlife and take very high resolution images, drones are very beneficial in both species identification and individual identification of whales and dolphins. Similar to marine environments, forests are vast areas that can be difficult and slow to patrol on foot, or even by vehicle. Forests are one of the most exploited environments on earth, and due to their large, widespread nature, are difficult to manage. Drones allow observation of vast areas in a relatively short amount of time, and can produce aerial imagery to identify a multitude of activities, including illegal logging, fire activity, trespassing, and wildlife tracking. Drones are not only used for forest conservation, but also by timber companies. = Privacy concerns = Drones are increasingly used for law enforcement in Africa, where poaching is one of the biggest threats to endangered species. While beneficial in finding and pursuing poachers, this type of surveillance conservation can create fear among the people who live in the region. These technologies that can be used to track down wildlife, can just as easily be programmed to track down people. Drones have moved the line of sight upwards; where a backyard fence used to afford privacy from passerby, a drone operating in public airspace now may have clear view of one's yard. American public perception of drones is generally positive, with privacy being the main concern. A drone operator may not always be visible or accessible, which could raise security concerns. Americans are willing to give up a certain level of privacy for the technology and convenience drones may offer, for things such as package delivery. Potential solutions to the issue of passive human by- catch include image-altering technology to automatically pixelate identifying portions of images, such as a person's face or license plate number. These issues are separate from a more overt use of drones for the purpose of surveillance. There is a concept of behavioral privacy; the idea that a person's behavior differs if they know they are being watched, or not. If one lives in an area where drone's are being used for surveillance, their behavioral privacy is compromised, as they do not feel that they have the freedom to act naturally.  Acoustic recording  = Description and uses = Acoustic recording is commonly used in field biology work to confirm the presence of a species, and in conservation law enforcement, to help prevent or catch poachers. Acoustic recording devices may be passive; recording all the time, or active; recording only when triggered. Researchers may use a device and software that automatically detect a certain trigger event, such as a specific bird call or gunshot. By using acoustic location technology, law enforcement can locate the approximate location of the gunshot, and use that to pursue poachers. = Privacy concerns = Anyone in the vicinity of these sound recorders may unknowingly have their conversations and activities recorded. Most states in the US have wire-tapping laws that require consent of one or all parties for certain types of conversations to be recorded; ones where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy. Legal opinions differ on which types of communication fall under this protection.  US policies and regulations  = Research and conservation policies = There are no official policies regarding human by-catch data among research and conservation organizations. Each organization may have its own policies. The technology is still emerging, but there are potential solutions. There are software programs, whose original intent is to ease the burden of the thousands of images that must be checked and logged during a camera trap study. The programs assist in automating the process of filtering out the false positives; photos that were triggered without the target species. Along with filtering out empty frames, this software can detect human presence, and filter out photos of humans. This way, privacy could be ensured if the process was automated, so that no person had access to the photos of the people that were inadvertently taken. Most of the government policies and laws regarding privacy with these technologies are aimed at drones. = Law enforcement policies = Illegal actions and behaviors that occur on government or public lands, do not afford protection by a reasonable expectation of privacy. Drones are beneficial to aid law enforcement agencies to prevent, confront, and prosecute illegal activities such as logging, poaching, or fishing in a protected marine area. These illegal behaviors often occur in a vast area that is difficult to patrol by foot, or even traditional vehicle. Drones are fast, efficient, and can capture incriminating information with high definition. The intent of the remote recording devices in this case is to catch people engaging in illegal activities, so there is no argument for protection of privacy. = Surveillance policies = If cameras and drones become part of everyday life, the importance of privacy and security are more important than ever. With devices that are constantly sensing and recording, the security measures used to protect the privacy of the people in its proximity also need to be adaptable and advanced. = Notice posting = While there is no policy to do so, researchers must decide if they want to post notices in an area where they are monitoring using one of the above referred to remote devices. The purpose of posting is to allow people in the area to know that they may be recorded, if they enter the area. Unfortunately, some people may not appreciate the perceived invasion on their privacy, and may tamper with or vandalize the cameras. In addition, posting notices about equipment puts it at risk to be stolen by thieves. = FAA regulation on drones = Signage prohibiting drone use In the United States, the FAA regulations on drones only pertain to the physical safety of airspace and everything under it. Privacy regulation is not within the realm of the FAA; that is for state and local governments to decide. Drone regulations vary by country, by state, by region, and, in some cases, further, by city. In addition, many preserves, and all national parks, such as the Golden Gate National Recreation Area in California, do not allow drone use. Drone operators can download an app developed by the FAA called B4UFLY, which compiles the local laws and do not fly zones and makes them easily accessible, so an operator may clearly know where it is legal to operate their drone. = Resources for drone operators outside of the U.S. = Drone regulations are similar across different countries. Requirements include keeping the drone within the operator's line of sight at all times, flying only during daylight hours, not flying over crowds or events, not flying near airports or around \\"important facilities\\", including government buildings and nuclear plants. The Australian government has created a mobile application for drone operators, called, Can I fly there? Similar to the app released by the FAA, it compiles laws and regulations so drone operators may know the rules in their current location. The Canadian government is updating its drone laws, with tighter regulations going into effect June 1, 2019. These guidelines refer the drone operator to review the laws related to the criminal code, trespassing act, voyeurism and privacy laws, before flying. It is explicitly stated that drone operators must respect the privacy of others. The Japanese government has similar regulations as the above. In addition, drone operators are requested to report incidents with drones, even if they do not affect others, such as crashes. The UK Civil Aviation Authority created a website called Drone Safe, which compiles the regional and local laws for drone use in the country. They have also created a mobile application for drone operators, called Drone Assist. People in the UK are afforded a higher level of privacy, as the regulations state that a drone equipped with a camera must stay a specified distance away from people not associated with the operator.  Legal examples  Most conservation work takes place over vast areas of land or sea, often spanning both public and private lands. People who live on or around these areas can have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their own private areas on these lands, such as their house, but are not afforded protection outside of their private areas. A drone operating in public airspace that is recording photos or videos with the intention of furthering conservation work, or law enforcement, has every right to do so. A politician in Austria, who was expecting the privacy a forest would afford, trespassed onto land which was being monitored by a camera trap. His encounter with his partner was recorded, and drama ensued. The law sides with intent, in regard to human by-catch. The intent of those who run these recording systems is to further their research, conservation work, or law enforcement. If there is no intent to record people with nefarious motivation, and the cameras were not on private land, the camera trap operator would reasonably expect to be safe from prosecution. From a legal perspective, the act of humans being caught in camera traps, acoustic recordings, and drones, when used for purposes other than recording people, is not wrong. The intention of the data holder, and what they do with that data is where legal privacy issues come in.  Other concerns  Wolf with tracking collar. The technology that allows us to view animals 24/7 has given to the rise of commercialization of conservation. Organizations can now show \\"poster child\\" animals via live streaming video. Some may applaud this as a modern way to educate without the need of keeping wild animals in captivity in zoos and aquariums, yet, the flip side to this idea is that the animals themselves lose their own privacy, and sense of the wild. This constant tracking and observation, especially of individual animals, can be seen as another way humans are trying to control every aspect of their environment. Tracking collars on wild wolves are common; to try to give researchers an idea of their migration patterns, and insight into their hunting techniques and social structure. But, as soon as a tracked wolf leaves the safe wild space, and enters, say, cattle grazing grounds, their location can be very easily pinpointed for ranchers who want to gun them down. The act of catching, tagging, implanting these tracking devices may alter the behavior of the wildlife, so an accurate representation may not be captured, making all the effort for naught.

Leyendecker. The original painting is on display in the Rare Books & Manuscripts Room at St. Louis Public Library‚Äôs Central Library. The Pageant and Masque of Saint Louis was a historical pageant presented May 28 ‚Äì June 1, 1914, in Forest Park, St. Louis, Missouri. Commemorating the 150th anniversary of the founding of the city, it was one of the largest theatrical events ever presented. Five hours in length, the city-wide event included a pageant surveying 300 years of local history, from the Mound Builders through the Civil War. An allegorical civic masque by playwright Percy MacKaye followed. Production In the spring of 1914, the city of St. Louis celebrated its 150th anniversary by staging The Pageant and Masque of St. Louis. With a cast of 7,500 local volunteers and an audience of 75,000 on opening night, it was one of the largest theatrical events ever presented.\\"The Pageant and Masque of St. Louis.\\" St.Louis Post - Dispatch (1879-1922), Jun 07, 1914. From May 28 to June 1 (plus one rain-out), the two-part spectacle was performed on the slope of Art Hill in Forest Park. City leaders and Progressive era civic boosters planned the event with the purpose of uniting citizens towards a prosperous future by sharing its rich history. Following the success of The Pageant and Masque of Saint Louis, the Municipal Opera was established nearby, five years later. Charlotte Rumbold, the secretary of the Public Recreation Commission of the St. Louis Park Dept., first suggested a city-wide event to coincide with the 150th anniversary of the founding of the city. She was among the many civic leaders who felt St. Louis was in decline because of poor political, social, and economic conditions. It was the era of political machines, monopolistic corporations, and a flood of unskilled European immigrants. Local businessmen John H. Gunlach, Luther Ely Smith, William W. La Beaume, and Charles A. Stix played major roles as Pageant Committee members. An enormous semicircular stage was constructed for the show. Built on pilings in the Grand Basin, the stage was over 500 ft. wide and 200 ft. deep.\\"Facts of Interest about the Pageant and Masque.\\" St.Louis Post - Dispatch (1879-1922), May 28, 1914. A 40-foot-high wall at the rear of the stage served as a sounding board. A pit large enough to accommodate the 100-piece orchestra and 1000-voice chorus was built at the center-rear of the stage against the backdrop. The Pageant, performed at 5:30 pm, surveyed three centuries of local history, from the Mound Builders through the Civil War. The Masque, an allegorical tale, began at 8:30 pm.Hurd, Carlos. \\"ALL about the Pagent WHAT IT IS, WHAT IT TYPIFIES, WHO ARE CONSTRUCTING IT, WHO WILL BE IN IT AND HOW AND WHEN IT WILL BE PRESENTED: Being a Comprehensive Survey of all the Essential Information Concerning St. Louis' Great Historical Celebration.\\" St.Louis Post - Dispatch (1879-1922), Mar 29, 1914. Together, the two productions lasted approximately five hours. Thomas Wood Stevens, a nationally recognized master of modern American pageantry, wrote and directed the Pageant portion of the event. Beginning in 1909 Stevens wrote and/or directed over 50 pageants and masques in 20 states and in Europe. Artist/director Joseph Lindon Smith and Percy MacKaye, a playwright and poet, collaborated on the \\"masque\\" segment of the program, fashioning a symbolic sweep through St. Louis history told in pantomime and dance. Some of Smith's vivid sketches for costumes survive. He designed scenery as well, including a temple based on architecture he had seen and painted at Chichen Itza. Smith was best known for his paintings of Egyptian antiquities. Frederick M. Converse composed of the music for Saint Louis: A Civic Masque.\\"ST.

Species within this genus are typically facultative anaerobes, gram-positive rods, non-spore forming, and are able to produce lactic acid from fermentation of glucose. The species of bacteria is located primarily in guts of mammals and insects. Lactobacillus porci was first discovered in Korea from a pig's small intestine. Scientists used phenotypic and phylogenetic analysis in order to determine the identity of the strain, SG816. The segment of the intestine was suspended into a sodium chloride dilution and then cultured onto de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe (MSR) agar. The plate was incubated and grown under anaerobic conditions. One convex, ivory colony was formed and then used for DNA extraction to amplify the sequences using 16s rRNA. The product was then compared to other species DNA with phylogenetic trees. The phylogenetic trees indicated that L. porci is closely related to several Lactobacillus strains. The most closely related strains are Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. indicus, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii. Scientists were also able to determine that L. porci had its own lineage, indicating that it is a novel species. Overall, L. porci is gram-positive rods, non-motile, catalase negative, non- spore forming, anaerobic, and d-lactic acid producing species.

He is known for his work in condensed matter and statistical physics, and particularly for the invention of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, an exactly solvable mean-field model of a spin glass. Career David Sherrington was born in Blackpool, UK in 1941 and grew up in Yorkshire. He received an undergraduate degree in physics in 1962 and a PhD in theoretical physics in 1966, both from the University of Manchester. After a brief period as a lecturer at Manchester, he took a position at Imperial College London as a lecturer in physics, rising subsequently to the rank of reader and later professor. In 1989 he moved to Oxford University as a Fellow of New College and to Oxford's Department of Theoretical Physics (now the Rudolf Peierls Centre for Theoretical Physics) as the sixth Wykeham Professor of Physics and head of the department. He retired as head of the department in 2004 and from the professorship in 2008. Sherrington has been Editor-in-Chief of the review journal Advances in Physics since 1984, and was a founding editor of Communications on Physics as well as editor of the Oxford Monographs in Physics book series starting in 1995. Among other honours, Sherrington is a Fellow of the Royal Society and a Fellow of the Institute of Physics, the American Physical Society, and the European Academy of Sciences. He was recipient of the Bakerian Medal of the Royal Society in 2001, the Dirac Medal and Prize from the Institute of Physics in 2007 and the Blaise Pascal Medal from the European Academy in 2010. Research Sherrington's contributions to theoretical physics are in the areas of condensed matter physics, statistical physics and complex systems, particularly focusing on glassy systems, neural networks and optimization problems. Perhaps his best known contribution is the 1975 invention, with Scott Kirkpatrick, of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model of a spin glass. The Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model is an Ising spin glass model in which every spin interacts with every other, with interaction strengths having signs that are chosen independently at random. The importance of the model stems from the fact that it was subsequently shown, in work by Giorgio Parisi, to be exactly solvable for its thermal equilibrium properties. The solution, which was based on the replica method, reveals a phase transition in the model to a glassy phase that displays a loss of ergodicity. Sherrington has made numerous subsequent contributions to replica theory and the theory of spin glasses, and is also notable for his work on complex systems including the minority game (a model of market competition) and early work on the application of statistical mechanics to network theory.

Saint Joseph's has operated as an hospital since 1775, following the destruction of its institutional predecessor as the main public hospital in the city of Lisbon, the 15th-century All Saints' Royal Hospital, in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. History The building that today houses S√£o Jos√© Hospital was ordered built starting in 1579, under the patronage of Cardinal Henry of Portugal, to house the College of Saint Anthony the Great (Col√©gio de Santo Ant√£o), an important Jesuit-run educational institution that was up until then located in the Mouraria quarter. The College was transferred to this new building on 8 November 1593. On 1 November 1755, a large-scale earthquake followed by a tsunami and a firestorm destroyed much of the Lisbon downtown, where the central Royal Hospital of All Saints was located. The hospital was greatly damaged, and the surviving patients were provisionally housed in undamaged convents and palaces until such a time the hospital was rebuilt. It was around this time that tensions between the Portuguese crown and the Jesuits came to an all-time high after King Joseph I's chief minister, Sebasti√£o Jos√© de Carvalho e Melo (later, and today best known as, the Marquis of Pombal), implicated them in the T√°vora affair. In 1759, the Jesuits were expelled from Portugal and its dominions, and the Portuguese crown seized their assets ‚Äî among them, the College of Saint Anthony the Great. Due to financial constraints, All Saints' Royal Hospital was never fully rebuilt. Following the nationalisation of the old and now vacant Jesuit College, the hospital facilities were transferred there, and it received its first patients on 3 April 1775; the old hospital was finally demolished to make way for a new square, Pra√ßa da Figueira, and the new repurposed premises were christened Saint Joseph's Royal Hospital (Hospital Real de S√£o Jos√©), paying homage to King Joseph I. Not unlike All Saints' Hospital before it, Saint Joseph's was the country's greatest school of surgery. In 1825, King John VI created the Royal School of Surgery (Escola R√©gia de Cirurgia), which would later evolve into the Lisbon Medical-Surgical School following Passos Manuel's reforms in 1836. In 1844, Saint Joseph's Hospital annexes the first of what would become long list of hospitals, the nearby Leper Hospital of Saint Lazarus (Gafaria de S√£o L√°zaro). Not long after, the Rilhafoles Mental Asylum (some time later renamed Miguel Bombarda Hospital) and the Desterro Hospital also became institutionally attached to Saint Joseph's ‚Äî the beginnings of an hospital centre that was then called, collectively, \\"Saint Joseph's Hospital and Annexes\\" (Hospital de S√£o Jos√© e Anexos). Other hospitals within the city also merged into the centre: Hospital de Dona Estef√¢nia in 1877, Hospital de Arroios in 1892, Hospital de Santa Marta in 1903, Hospital de Curry Cabral in 1906, Hospital de Santo Ant√≥nio dos Capuchos in 1928. From 1913, the hospital center became known as the \\"Civil Hospitals of Lisbon\\" (Hospitais Civis de Lisboa, HCL); it is currently called the Central Lisbon University Hospital Centre (Centro Hospitalar Universit√°rio de Lisboa Central, CHULC).

Its type and only known species is C. superoculis. Counillonia was related to the Triassic dicynodonts such as Lystrosaurus and the Kannemeyeriiformes that survived the Permian mass extinction, but it was more closely related to the Permian genus Dicynodon than to either of these lineages. Counillonia may then possibly represent another line of dicynodonts that survived the Permian mass extinction into the Triassic period, depending on its age. The discovery of Counillonia in Laos and its unexpected evolutionary relationships hint at the less well understood geographies of dicynodont diversity across the Permo- Triassic boundary outside of well explored regions like the Karoo Basin in South Africa. Description Counillonia was a medium-sized dicynodont (skull length of ) currently known only from a single skull that's missing the lower jaws. However, it likely resembled other closely related dicynodonts, particularly Dicynodon itself, and so was probably a squat, sprawling quadruped with a short tail and a large head with nearly toothless jaws and a tortoise-like beak, sporting a pair of prominent tusks. =Skull= The skull of Counillonia is short and relatively slender in construction, with the typically broad temporal fenestra of most dicynodonts at the back (although they are relatively reduced for a dicynodont) and a short, narrow snout that comes to a squared-off beak tip. The caniniform process of the maxilla is short and directed anteriorly so that the tusks point somewhat forward as well as down, and sits entirely in front of the eyes. The upper jaw is completely toothless apart from these two tusks. The interorbital region between the eyes is narrow, and so the large orbits are characteristically directed upwards. The nostrils are large, occupying approximately 1/3 of the snout's surface, and sit low at the front of the snout above the short and fused premaxillae. The nasal bones near the front of the snout sport a single well-developed boss that sits almost right above the nostrils and the premaxilla. This boss is bordered on each side by wide, elongate depressions that extend up on to the frontal bones behind the nasals. The boss has a roughened, rugose texture, but the surface of the rest of the snout is too weathered to determine if they were similarly rugose. Contacts between the bones are difficult to discern, and sutures are hardly visible on the surface of the skull, mostly between the contacts of the frontals and the surrounding bones. The pineal foramen (the opening for the \\"third eye\\") is oval and lies across the parietal bones just behind the preparietal and is positioned relatively far back in the last quarter of the skull. The braincase and rear of the skull is somewhat weathered, but they appear similarly constructed to those of other dicynodonts. The secondary palate formed by the premaxilla is unusually short and reduced, and their contact with the palatine bones is not visible. The palatines themselves preserve expanded, roughly textured pads that indicate the front of the roof of the mouth was covered in keratinous horn like the beak. History of Discovery The holotype and only specimen of Counillonia was discovered in the Purple Claystone Formation of the Luang Prabang Basin in northern Laos. This sedimentary unit mostly consists of purple silty- claystones mixed with layers of conglomerates and sandstone, as well as volcaniclastic sediments. Estimated dates for the age of the formation have ranged from the Late Permian to the Late Triassic or even the earliest Jurassic period. More recently, radiometric dating using U‚ÄîPb geochronology from detrital zircon has yielded a maximum age for deposition of 251.0 ¬± 1.4 Ma. It has been further suggested that mixing and reworking of the sediments implies that the actual depositional age of the formation is possibly even younger than this date, and so likely placing it in the Early Triassic. However, the reliability of this date was contested by Jun Liu in 2020, who argued that based on biostratigraphy the Purple Claystone Formation should instead be regarded as Late Permian in age, comparing Counillonia to dicynodonts found in the 255-253 million year old Daptocephalus Assemblage Zone of South Africa. Furthermore, Liu argued that the conditions of the Permian mass extinction in equatorial regions between the palaeolatitudes where Laos was situated (such as high temperatures over 40¬∞C) would have been inhospitable for dicynodonts, and concluded that Counillonia instead likely pre-dates the extinction event for these reasons. The first dicynodont remains to be discovered in the Purple Claystone Formation was a single, poorly preserved partial skull discussed by French geologist Jean-Baptiste-Henri Counillon in 1896. This skull was described in 1923 by another French geologist, Joseph R√©pelin, who named it as a new species of Dicynodon, \\"Dicynodon incisivum\\". The incomplete and damaged nature of the skull made identification difficult, and it has been variously attributed to Dicynodon and Lystrosaurus due to a supposed resemblance to the latter. The specimen has since been lost, and the poor quality of the remaining illustrations of the skull are unsuitable for supporting the validity of the species, and \\"D. incisivum\\" has since been considered a nomen dubium. As such, its relationships to other Purple Claystone dicynodonts like Counillonia remain unknown, despite the similarities the lost skull of \\"D. incisivum\\" and the type of Counillonia share with Dicynodon. More dicynodont remains were recovered by a Franco-Laotian expedition between 1993 and 2003 lead by palaeontologist Philippe Taquet. Three skulls in particular were studied and briefly described in 2009 and were assigned to Dicynodon, tentatively as a new species, although this relationship was not tested and remained uncertain. In 2019, the three skulls were more described in full detail and were recognised as representing two distinct new taxa, one of which, specimen LPB 1993-3, is the holotype for Counillonia. The other two skulls were assigned to another new genus, Repelinosaurus. The holotype was temporarily stored, prepared and studied at the Mus√©um National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris, and is permanently housed at the Savannakhet Dinosaur Museum in Laos. LPB 1993-3 is relatively complete, although the left portion of the orbit is damaged and it is missing the stapes and quadrate bones, as well as poorly preserving the preparietal, prootic and epipterygoid bones. The top surfaces of the snout and head are also partly weathered and eroded. The genus was named in honour of the geologist Jean-Baptiste-Henri Conillon as the first person to recognise the presence of dicynodonts in Laos, while the species is from the Latin super (upward) and oculis (eyes) in reference to its upward-facing orbits. Classification Preliminary studies of specimen LPB 1993-3 found it to be closely comparable to Dicynodon based on comparative anatomy. A phylogenetic analysis was later performed when Counillonia was officially described, utilising the dataset of Angielcyzk & Kammerer (2017), where Counillonia was found to be a \\"Dicynodon\\"-grade dicynodontoid forming a clade with Dicynodon and various other Dicynodon-like species. Amongst these similar species, Counillonia could be distinguished by three unique autapomorphies (derived traits): a relatively large median pterygoid plate, and a braincase with no intertuberal ridge on the basioccipital and distinct backwards-facing processes on the opisthotics. The occipital condyle that connects the skull with the spinal column is also unfused, a feature it only shares with Delectosaurus among the \\"Dicynodon\\"-grade taxa (in which they are otherwise fused). Counillonia also differs from its nearest phylogenetic and geographic relatives in various other combinations of features on the skull that further distinguish it from these other genera. Furthermore, despite not being found as particularly closely related to the existing valid species of Dicynodon, many of the genera within the \\"Dicynodon\\"-grade were formerly assigned to Dicynodon, and so the results of the phylogenetic analysis corroborate the initial identification. A simplified cladogram, an excerpt from the full analysis by Olivier and colleagues focused on the relationships of the \\"Dicynodon\\"-grade dicynodontoids, is shown below: Unusually, their analysis recovered Counillonia and the other \\"Dicynodon\\"-grade taxa united as a clade sister to the Kannemeyeriiformes, and not as a grade of taxa leading up to Lystrosauridae and Kannemeyeriiformes, which are usually recovered as each other's sister taxa. In this analysis, Counillonia shares four synapomorphies with all the other members of this clade, and they all together share another two with the Kannemeyeriiformes. Another analysis performed in 2020 by Jun Liu found Counillonia to be the sister taxon to the contemporary Laotian dicynodont Repelinosaurus, together forming a clade with the newly described Chinese dicynodont Taoheodon. Liu identified a 'core-Dicynodon' clade containing these taxa, Dicynodon itself, and the Russian genera Delectosaurus and Vivaxosaurus. A simplified excerpt of the cladogram produced by Liu (2020) is shown below: Palaeoecology In the Purple Clay Formation, Counillonia is currently only known to have co-existed with the basal kannemeyeriiform dicynodont Repelinosaurus and the semi-aquatic chroniosuchian tetrapod Laosuchus. The only direct evidence of plants in the formation are preserved root traces in palaeosols, but a locality underlying the Purple Claystone Formation and above late Changhsingian (Late Permian) deposits preserves a rich and diverse palaeoflora. The sediments preserved indicate that the Purple Clay Formation was deposited in a braided river environment that gradually transitioned to an alluvial plain with ponds. The region was volcanically active, as evidenced by the volcaniclastic rocks mixed in with the sediments of the formation. This appears to be associated with a volcanic arc that was formed as the then isolated Indochina Block where Laos was located approached the rest of the supercontinent Pangaea. Life restoration of the contemporary chroniosuchian Laosuchus. =Palaeobiogeography= The presence of typical Permian fauna like Counillonia at a time close to the Permian mass extinction may suggest that the Indochina Block, including the Laos region, may have acted as a refugium for Permian life across the Permo-Triassic boundary (similarly, plant diversities in nearby South China appear to have been relatively stable across the Permo-Triassic boundary). This could also be supported by the absence of \\"Dicynodon\\"-grade dicynodonts like Counillonia in other parts of the world, such as in the Karoo Basin of South Africa where they appear to have disappeared entirely. This could reflect a potential bias in the geographic sampling of Permo-Triassic dicynodonts that may hinder our understanding of how they evolved, such as potential Triassic aged \\"Dicynodon\\"-grade dicynodonts like Counillonia. Alternatively, if Counillonia is Late Permian in age, its presence in Laos would indicate that the Indochina Block was connected to the Southern and Northern China Blocks by this time. This is in contrast with previously inferred dates suggesting that these landmasses did not collide and connect with each other until the Triassic period.

It is supported by the South Australian Government and private donors. History JamFactory was established as a craft training workshop in 1973 by the Dunstan government, housed in an old jam factory on Payneham Road, in the suburb of St Peters. In 1992 it moved to a purpose-built building in the West End creative precinct of Adelaide city, on Morphett Street in close proximity to the Lion Arts Centre and Mercury Cinema. The ceramics studio opened in 1979, with Jeff Mincham as creative director (1979-1982), followed by Bronwyn Kemp (1983-1988), Peter Anderson (1989-1990), Stephen Bowers (1990-1999), Neville Assad-Salha (1999-2003), Philip Hart (2006-2008), Robin Best (2008-2010) and Damon Moon (2014-2018). As part of a major interior refurbishment in 2014, the Adelaide Casino commissioned hand-crafted glass light pendants from a team of 12 artists at the JamFactory, which would be hung from the ceiling of the plus SKYroom. Each pendant, worth nearly , weighs about . In July 2017 it received public funding of towards a new retail store and increased production capacity at its West End studios, after having increased its turnover by 55% in the previous five years at both locations. They had increased their staff and also been hiring out the studios to independent artists. The planned purchase of a new furnace for the glass studio, would increase its capacity by a third. It was also planning to open a new retail store in the North Terrace cultural precinct. Between 1993 and 2018, JamFactory's funding was managed by Arts South Australia (previously Arts SA), but under the new Marshall government, its governance was moved in 2018 to the Department of Innovation and Skills. Designers Daniel To and Emma Aiston, who had previously run an arts studio known as \\"Daniel Emma\\" together since 2008, took over as creative directors of JamFactory at the beginning of 2019. At the same time, a collaboration between JamFactory and the National Gallery of Victoria‚Äôs Melbourne NGV Design store was begun, to retail the \\"Good Morning\\" collection of designer homewares. Description The city location is at 19 Morphett Street, next door to the Mercury Cinema and Lion Arts Centre. Four studios provide programs in ceramics, jewellery-making and fine metalwork, glass-making and furniture-making. There are also independent studio spaces for emerging artists, a shop specialising in high quality craft and design objects. JamFactory also collaborates with other organisations, architects and designers on specially commissioned work and projects. It commissions work, functions as a publisher and runs workshops. The Seppeltsfield studio and shop opened in 2013 as a regional extension, to support local craftspeople and as an tourism offering. It is housed in an historic 1850s stables building, which has been extensively renovated.

They began as a parody band that uploaded metal covers of pop songs on YouTube, but later went on to write their own original material. History Prior to forming the band, Karan Katiyar would regularly upload parody metal covers of popular Bollywood songs on YouTube, but he had trouble finding a suitable vocalist. Katiyar met Jayant Bhadula, who worked as a talent manager at an entertainment company, at a local gig, and was impressed by his vocal range and versatility. In 2016, Katiyar quit his job as a corporate lawyer and together with Bhadula formed a two-piece band with the intention of \\"destroying pop songs\\". In 2017, Bloodywood re-recorded Linkin Park's song \\"Heavy\\" in Linkin Park's early nu metal style, catching the attention of many music websites such as Loudwire and Metal Hammer, the latter of which declared it \\"what Linkin Park's Heavy should have sounded like.\\" The band made more covers in 2017 and released the compilation cover album Anti-Pop Vol. 1 on their Bandcamp page. This was followed by a metal cover version of the popular Punjabi song \\"Tunak Tunak Tun\\" by Daler Mehndi, featuring guest vocals from Bonde do Metaleiro. On 1 May 2018, Bloodywood released \\"Ari Ari\\", a composition based on the Punjabi folk song \\"Baari Barsi\\". The track featured rapper Raoul Kerr, whom Katiyar had invited to take part after working on a lyric video for him. Kerr would be featured in further Bloodywood songs, until he eventually became an official member of the band. Fan reception to the song was much better than to their previous covers, which encouraged the band to write original material and take more inspiration from Indian folk music. Later, Bloodywood partnered with the online counseling site HopeTherapy and released the song \\"Jee Veerey\\", dedicated to fighting depression and mental illness. On 15 January 2019, the band released \\"Endurant\\", a song dealing with the topic of bullying. On 21 April 2019, it was announced that Bloodywood would be performing at Wacken Open Air. Two days later, the band released the song \\"Machi Bhasad (Expect a Riot)\\", initially intended for the upcoming Ubisoft game Beyond Good and Evil 2, as well as announcing that Kerr is becoming a permanent member of the band and that Bloodywood is embarking on their \\"Raj Against the Machine Tour\\". Social work Along with the messages included in their songs, the band aims to support various social/charity causes.

The library was built by the Battersea Vestry between 1889 and 1890, to a design by Edward Mountford, and remains in use in contemporary times as one of Wandsworth Council's libraries, operated by Greenwich Leisure Ltd. A separate Battersea Reference Library, built in 1924 with a frontage on Altenburg Gardens, is connected to the Central Library, and together the pair are known as Battersea Library. History Municipal boroughs in England and Wales were first given the power to establish free libraries by the Public Libraries Act 1850. Battersea, which in 1850 had a population of some 12,000 and local government based on the Vestry system, became eligible to consider adoption of the provisions of the Act after the Public Library Acts 1855 extended the types of authorities that qualified as potential Library Authorities. The Battersea Vestry considered the matter in a meeting in 1859, but declined to engage. By that date, much of the administration of local government in Battersea had been transferred to the Wandsworth Board of Works by dint of the Metropolis Management Act 1855. Battersea experienced very rapid population growth over the next two decades; by 1881 it numbered 107,000 inhabitants, and as a result, both overshadowed the much smaller Wandsworth, and had ambitions to regain its autonomy. In 1887 the Wandsworth Board adopted the Libraries act and began making plans for library provision; it established temporary library facilities at two locations (on Battersea Park Road, and on the Latchmere Estate) and engaged Laurence Inkster, who had experience as the borough librarian of South Shields. However in the same year, the Metropolis Management (Battersea and Westminster) Act 1887 enabled Battersea to escape the Wandsworth Board and regain full control of all parochial functions. The revivified Battersea Vestry of 1888 was consciously progressive in nature, in part because of its newly won autonomy; in part because of the make-up of its population, and in part because of the ideals of some of its leaders, such as John Buckmaster, John Burns and Andrew Cameron. Battersea Central Library was one of its first major projects. In 1888 the Vestry purchased what had been part of the West Lodge estate for ¬£3,000: an L-shaped site with frontages onto Lavender Hill and Altenburg Gardens, to the west and south of Altenburg Terrace. It immediately held a design competition to solicit plans for a building based on very detailed specifications of requirements; ten architects submitted entries, and that of Edward Mountford was selected. Mountford was local and presumably well known to the Vestry; he was at the time engaged in the design and construction of the nearby Northcote Road Baptist Church (and three years later would be selected as architect for the new Battersea Town Hall). The Central Library was his first commission from the Vestry; his winning submission was the only design of the ten that could be built within the Vestry's ¬£6,000 budget. Mountford's design is of three-stories (plus basement), in red brick by Richardson & Co of Brunswick Wharf, Vauxhall, with Portland stone dressings and a roof of Broseley slate to match the extant 'speculating builder' constructions which characterise the area - many of which owe their origins to the work of Alfred Heaver, the dominant property developer of what is now termed Clapham Junction. The front elevation of the building has five main bays, the second and fourth of which project slightly and are topped by shaped gables. A sixth bay in the form of an octagonal tourelle with a steep roof forms the right-side corner of the building. This feature was added to Mountford's winning design after its submission and before building commenced; originally projected as a two-story turret, it was built to three-stories height. One effect of the turret is to set the library's entrance off-centre. The building is minimally embellished, having only carved-brick garlands and putti above the ground-floor windows of the projecting bays, probably by Gilbert Seale of Camberwell; and decoration around the arched entrance with a frieze above. Andrew Saint, in Survey of London, Battersea, describes the building as being in the \\"mildly Flemish Renaissance style, in the spirit of Ernest George\\". As initially constructed, on the ground floor, a central lobby and corridor led to a news room on the right, behind which was the librarian's office; and a magazine room on the left. The lending library shelving occupied the rear of the ground floor. On the first floor, accessed by a central staircase, a double-height galleried reference library with open-timbered ceiling occupied the rear of the building; a second magazine room was situated to the front-left, and on the right side a small (and poorly lit) Ladies Reading Room separated the reference library from the librarian's apartment. On the second-floor a book store was situated above the magazine room, with the right-side of the building housing the upper floor of the librarian's apartment. The basement provided accommodation for a caretaker, and the library frontage was set behind a low stone wall with wrought-iron railings and six stone piers supporting spherical finials. Shelving throughout the library was of pitch pine. The building was constructed by building contractor James Holloway, who tendered ¬£5,600 for the job. A foundation stone was laid on 2 May 1889 by John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury, and work proceeded quickly, albeit Holloway died in 1889 before completion, and his executors arranged for his brothers' construction company, Holloway Brothers (London), to complete the project. The library was opened by Sheffield Liberal MP A. J. Mundella on 26 March 1890. A number of modifications to the design were made in the very early years of the life of the building; as with alterations to Battersea Town Hall after its 1893 construction, all of these were designed by J. T. Pilditch, the vestry's surveyor with work being undertaken by the vestry's direct labour force rather than by contractors. The need to widen Lavender Hill road in 1895-6 necessitated removal of the railings and infilling of the light-wells illuminating the basement; this rendered the basement uninhabitable, as a result of which an extension was built to the rear of the library in 1897/8 to provide additional lending library space above which a new apartment for the caretaker was constructed. The second-floor book store had been repurposed as a lecture room in the very earliest period of the building's use, but in 1900-1 the first floor magazine room was galleried by removing the lecture room floor, the ground floor magazine room was turned into an auxiliary news room, and the second floor was extended to provide a childrens' library.

The social structure is based on matrilineal clans that control land and resources. People participate in the regional circuit of exchange of shells called kula, sailing to visit trade partners on seagoing canoes. In the late twentieth century, anti-colonial and cultural autonomy movements gained followers from the Trobriand societies. When inter-group warfare was forbidden by colonial rulers, the islanders developed a unique, aggressive form of cricket. Although an understanding of reproduction and modern medicine is widespread in Trobriand society, their traditional beliefs have been remarkably resilient. For example, the real cause of pregnancy is believed to be a baloma, or ancestral spirit, that enters the body of a woman, and without whose existence a woman could not become pregnant; all babies are made or come into existence (ibubulisi) in Tuma. These tenets form the main stratum of what can be termed popular or universal belief. In the past, many held this traditional belief because the yam, a major food of the island, included chemicals (phytoestrogens and plant sterols) whose effects are contraceptive, so the practical link between sex and pregnancy was not very evident.Weiner, Annette B. The Trobrianders of Papua New Guinea. United States of America: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning, 1988. Language The Trobriand peoples speak Kilivila, though various different dialects of it are spoken amongst each different tribe. It is an Austronesian language, although has the distinction of having a complex system for classifying nouns. Foreign languages are less commonly spoken, although by the 1980s at least, Trobrianders occasionally spoke Tok Pisin and English. The term \\"Trobriand\\" itself is not Kilivilan: the islands take this name from the French explorer Jean Fran√ßois Sylvestre Denis de Trobriand who visited in 1793. Malinowski in the Trobriands Drawing upon earlier work by Bronis≈Çaw Malinowski, Dorothy D. Lee's scholarly writings refer to \\"non-lineal codifications of reality\\". In such a linguistic system, the concept of linear progress of time, geometric shapes, and even conventional methods of description, are lost altogether or altered. In her example of a specific indigenous yam, Lee explains that when the yam moves from a state of sprouting through ripeness to over-ripeness, the name for each object in a specific state changes entirely ‚Äì the description of the object at different states of development relates to wholly different perceptions of the object. Ripeness is considered a \\"defining ingredient\\" and thus once it becomes over-ripe, a yam is perceived as a new object altogether. The same perception pertains to time and geometric shapes. Food In Trobriand society, it is taboo to eat in front of others. As Jennifer Shute noted, \\"the Trobrianders eat alone, retiring to their own hearths with their portions, turning their backs on one another and eating rapidly for fear of being observed.\\" However, it is perfectly acceptable to chew betel nuts, particularly when mixed with some pepper plant and slaked lime to make the nut less bitter. The betel nut acts as a stimulant and is commonly used by Trobrianders, causing their teeth to often appear red. Because in the past food was often scarce, to boast of having food is one of the Trobriand Islanders' chief glories and ambitions. Though food is most important, and the subject of food is most discussed, at Miamala, the annual time of harvest and feasting, the islanders can face hunger and scarcity due to poor growing conditions at any time of year. In mid-2009, the problem of population pressure, leading to food insecurity, received much national and international media attention.MacCarthy, M. (2012). Playing Politics with Yams: Food Security in the Trobriand Islands of Papua New Guinea. Culture, Agriculture, Food & Environment, 34(2), 136‚Äì147. doi:10.1111/j.2153-9561.2012.01073.x Marriage customs At seven or eight years of age, Trobriand children begin to play erotic games with each other and imitate adult seductive attitudes. About four or five years later, they begin to pursue sexual partners. They change partners often. Women are just as assertive and dominant as men in pursuing or refusing a lover. This is not only allowed, but encouraged. In the Trobriand Islands, there is no traditional marriage ceremony. A young woman stays in her lover's house instead of leaving it before sunrise. The man and woman sit together in the morning and wait for the bride's mother to bring them cooked yams. The married couple eat together for about a year, and then go back to eating separately. Once the man and woman eat together, the marriage is officially recognized. When a Trobriand couple want to marry each other, they show their interest by sleeping together, spending time together, and staying with each other for several weeks. The girl's parents approve of the couple when a girl accepts a gift from a boy. After that, the girl moves to the boy's house, eats her meals there, and accompanies her husband all day. Then word goes out that the boy and girl are married.Ember, Carol R., and Melvin Ember. Cultural Anthropology. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2007. A married couple may get divorced after one year if the woman in the relationship is unhappy with her husband. A married couple may also get divorced if the husband chooses another woman. The man may try to go back with the woman he left by giving her family yams and other gifts, but it is ultimately up to the woman if she wants to be with that man. Magic Trobriands believe that conception is the result of an ancestral spirit entering the woman's body. Even after a child is born, it is the mother's brother, not the father, who presents a harvest of yams to his sister so that her child will be fed with food from its own matrilineage, not the father's. The Trobrianders practice many traditional magic spells. Young people learn spells from older kin in exchange for food, tobacco, and money. Spells are often partially or fully lost because the old people give away only a few lines at a time to keep getting gifts. Often, the old person dies before they finish passing on the spells. Trobrianders believe that no one can make up a new magic spell. Sometimes a man gives a woman magic spells because he wants to give her more than betel nuts or tobacco. People also buy and sell spells. Literate villagers write their magic spells in books and hide them. A person may direct magic spells toward heightening the visual and olfactory effects of their body to induce erotic feelings in their lover. Some spells are thought to make a person beautiful, even those who would normally be considered ugly. The beauty magic words are chanted into coconut oil, and then a person rubs it onto their skin, or into flowers and herbs that decorate their armbands and hair.  Cricket  After tribal conflict was banned, cricket became a replacement for war in the Trobriand culture. The colonial powers were appalled with the violence and sexual displays associated with tribal warfare. Matches are often played between all male teams and last for several months. There are often feasts for the winning team. While regular cricket is played around the world, these islanders add their own elements which reflect their culture. For example, since this sport resembles war there is no limit on team size. Also, every time a team scores there is a special dance ritual involved. These dances are an adaptation of the former war rituals. Therefore, they consist of taunts and jeers often criticizing the other team. \\"The words are sexual metaphors, used as one team taunts the other and exhibits their physical and sexual prowess to the appraising eyes of the young women on the sidelines\\" Often, there is also magic involved in this sporting event. Teams will use charms and incantations to gain an advantage in the match. For example, a spell could be used to make the team less efficient in scoring. The visiting team is expected to lose when visiting a rival island. However, when this is not the case, there are often reports of vandalism and arson when matches end unfavorably for the home team. During such events, yam houses are burned which is considered a major insult. In essence, this form of cricket has a more aggressive feel and is an important part of Trobriand life. Currency Trobrianders use yams as currency, and consider them a sign of wealth and power. Western visitors will often buy items from the Trobrianders using money. There is also a Kula exchange, which is a very important tradition among the Trobriand Islands. The women also use bundles of scored banana leaves. =Yam exchanges= Each year, a man grows yams for his sister, and his daughter if she is married. The husband does not provide yams to his wife. The more yams a woman receives, the more powerful and rich she is. The husband is expected to give his wife's father or brother a gift in turn for the yams they give his wife. When the woman is first married, she receives yams from her father until the woman's brother thinks his sister and her husband are old enough for him to give the yams. Wood carving of a traditional yam store in the Trobriand Islands At the beginning of the yam harvest, the yams stay on display in gardens for about a month before the gardener takes them to the owner. The owner is always a woman. There is a great ceremony for this every year. The yams are loaded into the woman's husband's empty yam house. Young people come to the gardens dressed in their most festive traditional clothes early on the day the yams are delivered to the yam house. The young people are all related to the gardener, and carry the yam baskets to the owner's hamlet. When they get to the owner's hamlet, they sing out to announce the arrival of the yams while thrusting out their hips in a sexually provocative motion. This emphasizes the relation between yams and sexuality. A few days later, the gardener comes and loads the yam house, and the man is now responsible for the yam. The yam house owner provides the gardener and young people with cooked yams, taro, and pork. Sometimes no pig is killed, perhaps because the yam house owner did not have a pig to spare. The yam house owner also may decide not kill a pig for the gardener because he is unsatisfied with the number of yams, or is angry with the gardener for another reason. Once the yam houses are full, a man performs a special magic spell for the hamlet that wards off hunger by making people feel full. The women also use bundles of scored banana leaves as a type of currency between themselves. As many days of work are required to make the bundles, each one has an assigned value and can be used to buy canned food, or in exchange for other goods. Death When a person dies, mourning continues for months. The spouse is joined in mourning by female kin and the dead person's father's sisters. These villagers stay in the house and cry four times a day. If someone who did not attend the funeral comes to the village, he or she must immediately join in on the mourning that is taking place. Other workers observe many of the mourning taboos. Most of them shave their heads. People closely related to the deceased avoid eating \\"good food.\\" Those more distantly related may wear black clothes. Before this, however, everyone receives a payment from the owners for the part they had in the burial process. The first set of exchanges takes place the day after burial and involves yams, taro, and small amounts of money. The spouse, the spouse's matrilineage, and the dead person's father or father's representative, and members of his matrilineage get the largest distribution. Missionisation 'Missionisation' has had a mixed effect on daily Triobriand life. Most of the islanders adhere to native tribal traditions. In an attempt to counter this, missionaries who are experienced with animist tribes are sometimes sent. Such missionaries may, for example, try to insert Christian blessings in traditional funeral ceremonies.

The blast was equivalent to 20-40 tons of TNT, producing an earthquake with a magnitude of 3.4, and was heard 80 km away (50 miles). The incident resulted in 29 deaths and left 2,500 wounded. Damages paid by insurance companies exceeded 1.5 billion euros. Although authorities initially treated the incident as an accident, the then Environment Minister speculated that the explosion may have been \\"a terrorist attack\\" in the wake of the September 11 attacks. The body of a worker known to harbor Islamic fundamentalist sympathies was found in the blast and investigated, although official investigation found the blast to be accidental. In spring of 2004, a terrorist group adopted the same name and threatened the French government with bombings. Toulouse chemical factory explosion On 21 September 2001, an explosion occurred in the AZF fertiliser factory in Toulouse, France, belonging to the Grande Paroisse branch of the Total group. Three hundred tonnes of ammonium nitrate was stored (the maximum capacity was 2,000 tonnes) in hangar #221. The whole factory was destroyed making a crater with a depth about 7 m (23 ft) and a diameter of 40 m (131 ft); steel girders were found 3 km away from the explosion. The blast measured 3.4 on the Richter scale, with an estimated power equivalent to 20-40 tons of TNT. The explosion was heard 80 km away (50 miles). Due to the acoustics of the hills and the large sound, the explosion was reported as occurring in multiple places. Police at first believed that at least five bombs had simultaneously gone off. There is still controversy over the exact number of explosions. The factory was close to the city: one of the most inhabited areas, Le Mirail, is just one kilometre away (0.6 miles). Several schools, one university campus, one hospital and a psychiatric hospital had to be evacuated. =Victims= The disaster caused 29 deaths (28 from the factory, 1 secondary school pupil from a neighbouring school), about 30 seriously wounded, and 2,500 light casualties.government report (archive) Two thirds of the city's windows were shattered, causing 70 eye wounds. The complete environmental consequences of the catastrophe are not yet fully known. The total damages paid by insurance groups currently exceed 1.5 billion euros. Investigation On 4 October 2001, France's then Environment Minister Yves Cochet announced that the explosion \\"may have been a terrorist attack\\" (the explosion occurred in the weeks following the September 11 attacks) and identified Hassan Jandoubi, a plant sub-contractor killed in the blast, as a person under investigation. French anti-terrorist authorities were prohibited by the Toulouse prosecutor from searching Jandoubi's house for five days after the incident.Paul Seabright What Explosion? London Review of Books Nov 1 2001 Police declared that Jandoubi had \\"possible Islamic fundamentalist sympathies,\\" yet by the time the search was finally conducted, they alleged that Jandoubi's girlfriend had disposed of all traces of his clothes or photos.

His works were originally in the Neo-Primitivist style, but became influenced by Fauvism. Together with Kazimir Malevich and Ivan Kliun, he created a style known as \\"Februaryism\\". He later took up Neo-Classicism, then was forced to adopt the Socialist Realism model. Biography He is generally believed to have been the illegitimate son of the painter, Alexei Savrasov and, like him, suffered from alcoholism in his later years. His mother, Yekaterina, died in 1920.Shatskikh, Alexandra. Malevitch et l'association Supremus, Trois carr√©s, 2009 His initial studies began at the Stroganov Moscow State Academy of Arts and Industry in 1899, but he also took private lessons from Konstantin Korovin and Sergey Ivanov. In 1904, he was accepted as a member of the and began to participate in their exhibitions. From 1909 to 1910, he travelled throughout Western Europe and came under the influence of Impressionism. Natalia Goncharova and Mikhail Larionov Upon returning, he established an informal workshop which became a meeting place for left-wing artists. He also associated with a group of radical artists led by Mikhail Larionov and participated in his ground- breaking exhibition called the \\"Jack of Diamonds\\". He also exhibited with Larionov's even more radical group called the Donkey's Tail in 1912. By 1914, he had begun to move in other directions. After that time, he became an associate of Kazimir Malevich. Together with Ivan Kliun, they created their own short-lived movement called \\"Fevrialism\\" (Februaryism), following a rather impolite debate at the Polytechnic Museum, in February. They were also known as the \\"–ª–æ—à–∫–∞—Ä–µ–π\\" (spoons) because they wore spoons in their buttonholes. He did not, however, stay with Malevich after the creation of the Suprematist movement. This was at a time when many of his personal relationships were beginning to suffer from his alcoholism. He dropped out of the art community for a few years; returning during the early Soviet period. After the 1917 October Revolution by 1918, he was a member of the College of Fine Arts; a division of the People's Commissariat for Education (Narkompros). From 1920 to 1921, he worked for their procurement and tariff commission. For some of those years, he also served as a teacher at his alma mater, the Stroganov Academy (then known as the \\"First Free State Art Workshops\\") and participated in \\"Proletkult\\". He eventually adopted the requisite style of Socialist Realism. In the 1930s, several of his paintings were reproduced as postcards. Thanks to the collector, George Costakis, some of his Fevrialist works may be seen at the Museum of Modern Art in Thessaloniki.

A 1961 addition at the rear of the house is not visible from Moon Valley Road. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. With Charles and Martha Villeneuve Charles Villeneuve (born 1836, died March 11, 1910) was an 1860 pioneer and mining prospector whose arrival in the Boise Basin predated the designation of Idaho Territory in 1863. Villeneuve homesteaded 140 acres in the Boise Valley near Eagle in 1872.The NRHP nomination form shows that Joseph Villeneuve filed for a homestead in 1872, and Charles Villeneuve owned the property in 1874. He married Martha Anderson, an 1876 pioneer, at his home in 1877. Villeneuve had been a stone cutter, and he may have constructed the Charles and Martha Villeneuve House himself in 1881. He sold the house and property in 1886 to William Eddy, and the Villeneuves moved to Boise City. Charles Villeneuve later worked as a custodian at the Ada County Courthouse. He also served briefly as the courthouse bailiff. In 1910 he was struck and killed by a trolley on the Boise Interurban Railway. Martha Villeneuve died in Boise in 1935. History of ownership After the house was sold to William Eddy in 1886, it was purchased by A.C. Guyer and A.S. Guyer in 1887. It was owned by Phelps Everett in 1888, and Everett operated a freight station on the property. His son, Elza Everett, owned the house from 1905 until 1909, when he sold it to Ernest and Daisy Pulliam. By that time the property had been reduced from 140 acres to 17 acres. Henry and Grace Eltinge acquired the house in 1917. In 1919 Martin J. Peterson and his son, M. Raymond Peterson, owned the house, and the Petersons added a separate garage and a barn to the property. Glen and Melvina Suiter owned the house from 1961 until 1965, and they are responsible for the rear addition, including a kitchen, a utility room, and a bathroom.

It stars Jai Courtney, Nat Wolff, Finn Wittrock, Beau Knapp, Arturo Castro and Leighton Meester. It was released on October 4, 2019, by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Plot In 2005, close friends Cal (Jai Courtney), Milk (Beau Knapp), Jaeger (Finn Wittrock), Snowball (Arturo Castro) and Oyster (Nat Wolff) bowl at Westside Lanes in Bridgewater, NY. Their nicknames are carved into their respective ball. After some roughhousing, an employee named Tony threatens to have them removed, but they show him Cal's badge--he is the police. Cal makes a deal with Tony to buy drinks for them all if Oyster can bowl 3 strikes--otherwise they'll leave. Oyster's third roll is a miss because he does it blindfolded, but with much laughter and joking, Tony doesn't throw them out. The camaraderie is palpable. In their day jobs, Cal, who's full name is Chris Callahan, is a police officer. Milk, who's last name is Milkowski, is a fire fighter at the Ernest J Cooper Memorial Fire Station. Jaeger is an auto body detailer. Snowball is a dockside crane operator. And Oyster, who is Cal's half-brother, works at a diner. Together, all five serve in the Marine Corps Reserve at Fort Drum, where Cal is their Staff Sergeant. Oyster picks fights, forgets his cap and is generally reckless during their time there, which earns him time cleaning toilets. The resentment between brothers builds. They're in training because they'll soon be called to active duty. At home, the brothers argue. Oyster has had prior felony convictions, and Cal reminds him that one more will land him back in prison. Oyster spouts his big dreams, which Cal feels are empty. Cal has pulled his life together, something he wishes Oyster would do. Their arguing turns into a scuffle, where Oyster accidentally gets hurt. Cal tries to make amends to his brother through a closed bedroom door as Oyster sulks and plucks his guitar. Late at night, the five friends meet up at Old Point Bar. They talk up two girls, Carrie and Val, to whom Cal shows them words tattooed on his forearms: Semper Fidelis. Cal and Jaeger spot Jaeger's ex- girlfriend, Clara, who's in town, but they're rebuffed by her when they go over to chat. Jaeger is rude. And Oyster wants $10 to buy drinks for Carrie and Val, but Cal won't do it. Cal, Milk and Jaeger head out into the night for a friendly race home after Cal warns Oyster not to get too drunk or violent. Oyster finally gets the money from another friend, Dwyer (\\"DJ\\"), but he's too late: he's been edged by out another guy, Ben Daley. Oyster shoves Ben aside and hands the drinks to the girls. When Oyster goes to use the restroom, Ben and a friend come in and pick a fight. Ben punches Oyster in the stomach twice before Oyster retaliates by hitting him in the head. Ben falls backward, hits his head hard on a porcelain urinal and lands on the floor. In a horrendous turn of events, Oyster's recklessness has finally had major consequences. On the floor lies a still Ben, with blood coming out of his ear as Oyster worriedly urges him to get up. At home studying Arabic in the quiet, Cal gets the call. He dresses hurriedly and races to the bar in his cruiser. His brother has fled the scene. Yelling Oyster's name back house, he finds the bedroom drawers empty. He finally spots his brother's Bronco at Snowball's apartment and calls it in. Despite Snowball's heated intervention and witness as to the true nature of the accident, Officer Callahan does his duty and forces Oyster out, calling him by his real name, Teddy. Scared and panicked beyond distraught, Oyster takes off. Callahan tackles him and places him in handcuffs as other officers arrive. As Oyster is being arrested, a senior officer arrives and announces that Ben - who was last seen bleeding from the ear - has died. Realizing this now means Oyster could go down for a murder, Cal is visibly distraught about apprehending his brother. While being placed in a squad car, Oyster shouts profanities at Callahan. Cal is grief stricken. Eight months later, Callahan, Snowball, Jaeger and Milk are on full active duty in the Mosul province of Iraq. They watch casualties climb from remote EID detonation, so they improvise with the use of a radio jammer to stop that. When their convoy heads out on patrol of the streets one night, however, one of their humvees is hit with an explosion. Jaeger's leg is horrifically injured. Callahan keeps Jaeger alert until medical staff can take over, then they raid nearby buildings and find a resident. With no interpreter, shouting in opposite languages escalate fast until it results in Callahan pulling the trigger and shooting the man dead. Callahan is aghast. Meanwhile, in Watertown, NY, Oyster has begun his 25 year sentence at Franklin Correctional Facility. Keeping a low profile, he's on cooking duty. Guards notice him sneaking apples into pancakes to add interest, so they invite him into the pantry to gain access to ingredients needed to make apple pies. It is a false pretense. With his back turned, three guards beat him mercilessly to the ground. With their tour of Iraq finished, Snowball, Jaeger and Milk happily return home to a town welcoming them all as heroes. But Callahan is sullen. No family to meet him. Jaeger's fiance‚Ä≤ has to drive him home. His brother is unjustly in prison. When he goes to visit him, Oyster doesn't want to see the brother who turned him in. Cal returns with Snowball to act as a mediator, but long burning rage simmers to the surface and escalates into a shouting match that even Snowball can't stop. All the old resentments between the two brothers spill out, including the fact that Cal long ago was made legal guardian of Oyster because there was no one else. Guards pull them apart, but not before Snowball notices bruising on Oyster's chest. Disheartened at the injustice of Oyster's lengthy sentence, Cal and Snowball start probing into legal ways to change things for the better. They petition for Oyster to be moved. They inquire into the abuse. The guards threaten Oyster to keep his mouth shut. Cal asks what if Dwyer were to change his testimony? Callahan uses his authority as a police office to question Dwyer at his home, which turns into a fight and resultant suspension of Callahan. Even Clara, who provides free legal service to veterans, can't seem to make any headway. They visit Jaeger at Walter Reed Medical Hospital in Maryland, where he's lost the lower third of his right leg. With Cal driving, the four head home. Finally together, Jaeger quietly voices his concerns as to Cal's mental state--as well as Oyster's well-being. Neither looks good. Sleepless nights and bouts of rage envelope Callahan. Nothing seems possible. They're horrified by the injustice of it all. Cal reasons that if he were to shoot someone at home like he did in Iraq, he'd be in prison for it. One night, after a visit to the VFW hall, Cal breaks down. Everything seems hopeless. His three friends remind him they need him. Then comes the breakthrough. One evening, Cal tells Snowball, Jaeger and Milk he's going to break Oyster out of prison and get him across the border into Canada. He's not asking for their advise; he's telling them. With a transfer to another facility in a few days, it is Cal's chance to free Oyster. Snowball and Jaeger join in. At first Milk is opposed, but he eventually joins in. As the plan comes together, their military expertise comes in to play. They'll transfer Oyster across the water into Canada at Snowball's place of work, where he's gotten a false ID to help. Clara, suspicious as to Cal's inquiries regarding sentences for jail breakers, visits Jaeger. She quizzes him, and marches into the living room to discover him cleaning his rifle. Over the course of the night, she realizes the need for this illegal activity and sanctions the risk, telling Cal she'll lie about Jaeger's alibi. They still have feelings for each other. They help Oyster escape and he makes it to Canada. Cal gives himself up.

The senior mark was surpassed by John Shanahan at the end of the 1949 season, with a time of 2:51.8. At the 1950 national swimming championships, Eagle finished second behind Shanahan in the men's 220 yards breaststroke, the winner covering the distance in 2:58.0. At the 1950 British Empire Games, Eagle competed in the 220 yards breaststroke. In his heat, he was second with a time of 3:01.4, and progressed to the final. He swam a time of 3:02.9 in the final to finish in fifth place. Business career After an early career as a schoolteacher, Eagle joined the retailer Woolworths as a manager in the early 1960s. He then spent seven years working for IBM, rising to become manager of the Auckland branch. In 1969, Eagle founded Prime Computer, which later became Eagle Technology, of which he was managing director. In 2000, Eagle appeared on the National Business Review rich list, with an estimated minimum worth of NZ$26 million. Personal life In 1958, Eagle married Corallie McGuire, and the couple went on to have seven children. He collapsed and died on 9 December 2000, after climbing on board a launch having been swimming near Motuihe Island in the Hauraki Gulf.

It tells the stories of six people on the last day of their lives. It premiered at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art as part of Frank Stauffacher's Art in Cinema series. Though the film met audience disapproval at its premiere, it was praised by critics as a \\"masterpiece\\" and \\"a great work of art\\". Plot The film is divided into six sections, each telling the story of a different character. After being shunned by his friends, Walter runs through the city until a man arbitrarily decides to shoot him. Charles, having just killed his landlady and her 7-year-old daughter, wanders through the city before arriving at the Golden Gate Bridge, where he jumps to his death. John, a comedian, performs a funny routine about killing himself before going home and committing suicide. The beautiful young poet Paul goes to a leper colony to find a lover and see if he can still be loved after contracting leprosy himself. The fifth section shows a series of images set to Beethoven's 9th, and the narrator asks the viewer to write the story. In the final story, two people meet on the beach and play, when a bomb falls from the sky and detonates. Production Frank Stauffacher helped secure funding for The End, much of which came from Bob Greensfelder of the Kinesis Film Society. Jordan Belson (who later became known for his own meditative works like 1961's Allures) served as the film's cameraman, shooting on inexpensive Kodachrome stock. The collaboration between him and Maclaine was marked by frequent conflict. Belson was upset that Maclaine would show up intoxicated in the middle of the night to give photographic directions for their shoots.Andersch and Wilkins 2010, pp. 55‚Äì58. Much of the film was improvised, including Maclaine's narration.Andersch and Wilkins 2010, p. 62. Release The End premiered on October 23, 1953, at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, as part of Stauffacher's Art in Cinema series. Audience members booed the film, shouting over it and throwing their chairs.Andersch and Wilkins 2010, p. 56. The film was distributed by Kinesis. When the company closed in 1957, Maclaine's work did not find a new distributor until 1962, when Stan Brakhage and Willard Morrison of the Audio Film Center brought it back into circulation.

The game's dark fantasy theme, action- oriented gameplay, and retro-inspired visual elements have earned it frequent descriptions as a spiritual successor to 1994's Heretic and 1995's Hexen. A version for the Nintendo Switch is planned for release in 2020.  Plot  In the ancient past, a mysterious and powerful \\"Evil Force\\" appeared and corrupted the sacred lands of the known realms. Though many heroes have tried to defeat the Evil Force, none have succeeded. The protagonist, known only as \\"the Champion\\", is the first to overcome the trial of the Black Labyrinth and win the right to carry a holy battle axe. Possessing the powerful relic grants the wielder passage to the higher planes. As the Champion travels to an inter- dimensional gateway, the voices of ancient deities warn of the great power of the Evil Force and implore the Champion to cleanse the sacred lands.  Gameplay  Amid Evil borrows heavily from 90's first-person shooters Unreal, Doom, Heretic, Hexen, and Quake. Similar to most first-person shooter games of that era, Amid Evil is structured as a progression of levels, each of which featuring a complex, non-linear structure with progression often requiring the player to seek out keys to unlock doors. The level design in Amid Evil promotes exploration, with most levels containing several hidden \\"secrets\\" where the player can find power-ups, as well as lore (plot exposition) in the form of inscriptions on walls or floors. Levels are grouped into episodes, with the levels in each episode sharing a unique theme. Episodes consist of four levels each, the last of which being a boss battle. Like Quake, players start in a hub level that allows episode (and difficulty) selection by walking through various portals. As in Heretic, the player must battle enemies using an array of magical weapons. In addition to the Axe of the Black Labyrinth, there are six ranged weapons in the game, each using one of four types of mana. The player must find both the weapons and the mana in the game world. The weapons have varied effectiveness against each of the enemy types, encouraging the player to modify their strategy depending on the situation. In addition to picking up mana, the player may absorb the souls of fallen enemies. As the player accumulates enough souls, they enter \\"soul mode\\" which activates alternative fire modes for all weapons, and greatly increases their power for a short time. As the player takes damage from enemies, the player loses health points. To replenish health points the player must pick up \\"blood orbs\\" scattered throughout the levels. There are also rare power-ups that grant temporary abilities such as flight, invisibility, or a torch to illuminate darkened areas. In addition to the single-player campaign, Amid Evil features a \\"Hordes of Evil\\" survival mode where the player can face off against endless waves of enemies in battle arenas.  Development  Developers Leon Zawada and Simon Rance, friends since childhood, began their career in game development with Doom mods, most notably a Rise of the Triad total conversion called Return of the Triad. The two started Amid Evil as a Doom mod in 1997. Though that game would never be completed, the concepts that they developed for it evolved over time and were incorporated into the new incarnation. They knew they wanted to make a \\"fantasy shooter\\" -- a game with a medieval magic theme, but featuring ranged weapons as the main weapons. Zawada and Rance eventually worked together on the 2013 Rise of the Triad remake, where they met other game developers that would help them form Indefatigable. Amid Evil was to be the new company's first project. normal mapped sprite. Before launching development of Amid Evil for Indefatigable, Rance had created an Unreal Engine 4 demo showcasing a weapon rendered as a normal mapped sprite. He described the idea as \\"the thing that got [the game] going.\\" The distinctive visual style established the art direction of Amid Evil, described by the developers as a \\"mix [of] old-school and new-school graphics techniques.\\" \\"The first-person weapons and pickups are actually sprites with individual frames using masked materials, complete with normal, roughness, and metalness maps. They‚Äôre then baked with perspective from hi- poly 3D meshes,\\" a workflow unique to Amid Evil. Rance described applying the same technique to environments, \\"where instead of making a giant texture we'd just make a small [resolution] texture but still apply a normal map to it, so everything looks shaded correctly but it's got the same pixely 1995 aesthetic as the old games. So it's old-looking but it's brought into the future; it's not just mimicked.\\" In order to make a 1990s game for a modern audience, the developers added to the retro first-person shooter formula. For example, enemy AI is much more dynamic. Rather than attacking the player from a single position, enemies can rush the player, jump from platforms, and give chase. Enemies have the ability to dodge or reflect attacks, and flank, which adds depth. The level design, while more complex than typical modern titles, is not maze-like so as to allow constant progression. Also weapons were given an alternate \\"soul mode\\" to add to the variety.  Release  Amid Evil was announced on October 25, 2017. Like Dusk before it, New Blood chose to publish the game using the early access model, initially releasing the game with a fully functional but incomplete single-player campaign, along with a survival mode. Amid Evil was released to Steam Early Access on March 12, 2018 featuring the first three of seven episodes, \\"Astral Equinox\\", \\"Domain of the Sentinels\\", and \\"The Sacred Path.\\" Additional episodes followed in a regular cadence; \\"The Solar Solstice\\" was released on May 18, 2018, \\"The Forges\\" was released on September 21, 2018, \\"The Arcane Expanse\\" was released on February 7, 2019, and \\"The Void\\" was released on June 20, 2019. The release of the final episode of the game coincided with Amid Evil leaving early access for a full release, which included updates to the previous episodes such as additional lore, more enemy variety, environmental tweaks, and weapon balancing. The first DLC, Ancient Alpha Builds, was released on November 22, 2019. Rather than new content for the main game, the DLC offered 5 earlier versions of the game from various stages of development. At the same time, ray tracing support with RTX was announced. A release for Linux has been confirmed as planned. = Prequel expansion = Amid Evil: The Black Labyrinth was announced with a teaser trailer on September 6, 2020.  Reception  The Early Access release of Amid Evil did receive press coverage, though nearly all outlets opted to provide a first impressions summary rather than a full review. In one such example, PC Gamer UK offered the summation, \\"A truly weird (and beautiful) fantasy setting lays the groundwork for a worthy ode to Heretic.\\" YouTube game reviewer Gggmanlives (now GmanLives) called the game \\"a labor of love\\" and concluded that \\"overall the game looks, sounds, and plays great.\\" Reviewers typically praised the weapon and level designs, while some criticized the enemy design and others criticized glitches in the pre-release version. By April 2019, The Early Access version of the game achieved an aggregate customer review rating of \\"Overwhelmingly Positive\\" on Steam. The full release of Amid Evil received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Reviewers praised the variety of weapons and environments, comparing the game favorably to Unreal and Quake.

Early life Maclaine was born July 27, 1923 in Wapanucka, Oklahoma. His family was of Scottish descent. He attended the University of California, Berkeley, graduating in 1946 with a bachelor's degree in Spanish. He began a graduate program in English but left after one semester. Career After leaving UC Berkeley, Maclaine started the literary magazine Contour with Norma Smith. Contour published four issues from 1947 to 1949. Maclaine completed his first film The End in 1953. Filmmaker Jordan Belson was the cameraman for the project. Their collaboration was marked by frequent conflict, with Belson upset that Maclaine would show up intoxicated in the middle of the night. Maclaine began working with Belson on a second film, The Man Who Invented Gold. Maclaine played the main character, an alchemist whose neighbors believe him to be mad. Unwilling to tolerate Maclaine's behavior, Belson quit before the project was complete. Maclaine took over as cameraman and had two additional actors play the lead. The resulting film was disjointed, cutting between three different people playing the same character and alternating between black-and-white and color footage. Maclaine made two more short films, Beat and Scotch Hop. Later life Kinesis, the distributor for Maclaine's films, closed and his films went out of circulation. His health deteriorated after he began to use methamphetamine in the late 1950s. He began to show signs of paranoia, which worsened after being sent to prison for possession of marijuana. Maclaine gave his films to Willard Morrison of the Audio Film Center to be preserved and distributed. Maclaine suffered permanent brain damage and eventually was unable to recognize people he knew or care for himself. In 1969 he entered the Sunny Acres Convalescent Hospital in Fairfield. Morrison used the rental money from Maclaine's films taking care of him during his time in the hospital. Maclaine died there on April 6, 1975.

Matthys Michielse du Toit (Montagu, Cape Colony, December 3, 1874 - Cape Town, August 18, 1959) was from 1905 until he accepted his emeritus in 1941 the pastor in six congregations of the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NGK), including one in South West Africa, two in the Orange Free State, and three in Cape Province: Barrydale (1905-1912), Reddersburg (1912-1920), Excelsior (1920-1921), Moria (now Otjiwarongo, 1921-1922), Hopetown (1922-1925), and finally Joubertina (1925-1941). According to his own grateful testimony, \\"the Lord's blessing must have shadowed the work for so many Souls to be brought to the light.\\" Especially in the last of these congregations, the mission progressed greatly under his leadership. He was long a loyal and avid member of the NGK's General Mission Commission. After accepting his emeritus, he spent a great deal of time working in various congregations, including hospital work. At the time of his death at 85, he was the only survivor of the 17 proponents with whom he was ordained in 1904.  Childhood and education  Matthys Michielse du Toit was born the oldest son of his parents in Montagu, where he worked in his father's general store after finishing school. He received his calling in 1891 during a major spiritual revival in Montagu, spurring him to begin a long spiritual education, first in Montagu and later in Stellenbosch, which led him and 16 other candidates to the ministry in December 1904.  Family life  On March 13, 1906, the young pastor married Ms. Anna Johanna Le Roux (born September 4, 1879) in Paarl. After a happy marriage of 33 years, she died at their home in Joubertina on Sunday, December 17, 1939. They had four sons who all graduated from Stellenbosch University. After around 16 months alone in the Joubertina parsonage, the Rev. du Toit married once more to E.M. de Wet (n√©e Lombard) in Queenstown. Several weeks later, he accepted his emeritus, and after many more years of volunteer work, met his eternal rest in Rondebosch.  Barrydale  The Rev. Du Toit arrived in Barrydale in 1905. In those days, a minister was expected to hold three services every Sunday. He found this taxing for his throat and the church council granted him just two of them on a doctor's advice. During his time there, a new church was built and expanded. On December 12, 1905, a special service was held there by the former pastor, G.P. van der Merwe, to usher out the old church which had served the congregation for 28 years. Unfortunately, little is known of the words the Rev. Van der Merwe spoke here, since A.A.J. van Niekerk, writer of the congregation's centennial commemorative book, couldn't find any material on it and even the oldest members of the congregation (by 1980) were too young at the time to remember anything about it. Even the few over ninety only remembered the identity of the speaker. In Ons Kerk Album, he is said to have worked tirelessly for the mission and to have \\"nurtured much real love for the cause of the Great King\\" among this congregation.  Moria  At the church council meeting on April 4, 1921, of what was at the time Moria, now Otjiwarongo, the council pledged ¬£100 to recruit a more competent pastor for the congregation over the following year. The ring passed to the Rev. M.M. du Toit, earlier of Reddersburg and Excelsior, and at the council meeting on August 6, 1921, in Omaruru, he was accepted for the post. The Rev. Du Toit set out at once to visit the different districts in the congregation, particularly those where the railway workers who made up a large proportion of the congregation lived. Articles about his work in the Kerkbode (November 10, 1921 - November 22, 1922) give an interesting description of the times. He traveled widely, as much as 11,000 miles in one year. Most places were now accessible by rail, but he also had to use many other vehicles: \\"passenger train, freight train, automobile, trolley, horse-cart, mule-cart, donkey-cart, and oxcart. He even tried riding a camel.\\" The Rev. Du Toit apparently succeeded in getting the cooperation of various local officials. Of Gys Hofmeyr, administrator at the time, he said: \\"He is not only a faithful supporter and lover of the church, but someone who confesses his love of the Lord out loud.\\" In the Kerkbode of December 27, 1922, he published a primer to better educate the growing membership, who now numbered around 6,500 in South West Africa. W. Badenhorst and W. Hauptfleisch, stationmaster and postmaster of Karibib respectively, were \\"stalwarts\\"; and J. Hamilton, earlier an Irish Catholic, found his Sunday school in Swakopmund a great blessing. From his informative report for the Britstown Ring (1922), the Rev. Du Toit showcased his work with the Moria congregation: he had held 191 services, including 167 in Moria and 24 in Gibeon (later capital of the Mariental Reformed Church (NGK)); 21 young members were confirmed and 41 children baptized.  Hopetown  The Rev. J. de Villiers, a missionary, was there to welcome Rev. Du Toit on his investitutre as pastor of the Hopetown Reformed Church (NGK) in 1922. The Rev. Du Toit worked for three years at the grueling task of not only serving the congregation itself but also traveling \\"in withering heat, over immense distances\\" to the three diamond mines within the congregation's remit. The labors took a toll on his health, as he is quoted in memoirs excerpted for the congregation's 75th anniversary commemorative book. He recalled with gratitude that his debt of ¬£3,200 was cancelled. He remembered in particular the Pentecost revivals held by the congregation at Pentecost and the congregation's healthy relationship with the mission church. In 1923, the diggings at Brakfontein Farm were proclaimed public by W. Higgs (magistrate of Hopetown). A diamond rush was on, and prospector shacks sprung up like toadstools overnight. In the years that the Rev. Du Toit was pastor, the church sold its flock of sheep to supplement collections and thus pay the church's debt. A grateful congregation's church council was thereby able to buy the pastor a car to drive around the mining towns. In 1925, the church council once more provided a car to the Rev. G. Oosthuizen. The church's inside was renovated then. No more would the congregation need to sit far away from the pulpit to see the pastor, since the pews were moved into a sloping floor so that one could overlook the other. From 1917 onward, the women of the congregation managed the cemetery.  Joubertina  After the resignation of the Rev. Van Rensburg of the Joubertina Reformed Church (NGK) in the Langkloof, the Revs. P.J. Van der Merwe (Murray, De Doorns), W.N. van der Merwe (Wellington), and Du Toit were considered. Du Toit was officially inaugurated on Friday, September 25, 1925, and he, his wife, and their sons were ushered from Twee Riviere in a procession of 18 automobiles, 38 carriages, and 68 cavalry to their welcome in Joubertina. His confirmation was held that Saturday night by the Rev. C.H. Stulting (Humansdorp). His first communion followed on Sunday morning, and he sermonized in the afternoon on 2 Corinthians 12: \\"I'm looking for you. (i) What we seek, (ii) The road on which we search for it, (iii) How you can help us in this search.\\" = General matters = At the first Pentecost service the Rev. Du Toit celebrated with his new congregation, he was blessed by closing prayers from 82 worshipers, including 48 of the youth and children. Each communion weekend, he held five services. Saturday afternoon was the preparatory service, Saturday night was another service after which followed the church council meeting. Early Sunday morning was the children's service in the church followed by the communion service. Sunday afternoon followed another service at which baptisms were held, and Sunday night was the reflection service. In 1918, the church council began several years of negotiations to acquire 800 acres of land in the Diepkloof Rock Shelter hills for ¬£320. The Rev. Du Toit explored the idea of planting trees on the hills and even setting up a lumber plantation. The community of the Langkloof suffered a great loss with the sudden death of Mr. Giel Bokkie Olivier on April 28, 1928. He was for years a deacon, auctioneer at the thanksgiving parties, and from the foundation of the congregation until 1922, a collections manager \\"almost pro bono.\\" In the religious, educational, and social spheres, he was almost indispensable to Joubertina. From the first years of the congregation, Mrs. Olivier, his wife, served as secretary of the church, until she too died on September 24, 1930, leaving the church ¬£350 in her will. With the resignation of Mr. Olivier as collections officer, a Mr. McLachlan replaced him. In 1923, a John van der Spuy took the job for a few months but then left, at which point McLachlan returned to the post until October 7, 1925, when J.G. Deyzel was formally elected to the role, which he would fill for at least a quarter-century. = Enlargement of the church building = Since the need for seating was only growing more pressing, plans were made starting in 1928 to build the two galleries originally planned for the church. At the same time, the clock tower had to be furnished. The clock was built by A. Fischer & Kie, and it was paid for by Sunday school contributions. The galleries had to be put on hold for financial reasons, but since the fund had grown to ¬£3,000 by 1934, the Rev. Du Toit was free to return to the project, contracting the architect W.H. Louw of Paarl and the Oberholster construction firm in 1936. Once completed, these additions added 200 pews to the church. = Church organs = The first organ in record at the church, purchased in 1917 for ¬£23, replaced a harmonium Mrs. Augusta Cronje (later Mrs. M.J. Kritzinger) had presented to the church in December 1913. A larger organ was bought in 1930. Mrs. McLachlan, Mrs. Fourie, Mrs. J.L. du Preez, and others led the congregation's hymns accompanied by this instrument until better financial days arrived; in August 1935, a pipe organ was finally purchased for around ¬£1,000, to use for the new galleries if possible. The first official organist was Mrs. M. Delport. To move the organ into place behind the pulpit, the building had to be altered, knocking out the upper hall. These changes, together with new carpeting for the church, cost around ¬£34, but the amount was already covered, and therefore, no further collection drives were needed. The old gas plant's explosion led to the installation of a Westinghouse electric generator in 1931 to supply the church with light. = Communion bowls = An uncontroversial change in Joubertina was the commissioning of communion bowls. In November 1929, the church council noted a donation of ¬£100 for the purpose by the widow of M.J. Olivier in commemoration of his work as collector, and they immediately decided to use it to buy a set. Two years later, the old communion vessels were donated to the Malingunde mission in Nyasaland. = Death of the church mother = It was a tragic day not just for her husband and children but for the congregation and the Kingdom of God as well when Mrs. Du Toit died in the vicarage after a severe illness, which had left her bedridden for eight months and an inspiration to one and all. According to the Rev. H.C. Hopkins, she was \\"a worthy wife and mother; a devoted, honored, and dearly beloved maidservant of the Lord; and an ornament to the rectory and the congregation. Her commitment, tact, and ingenuity made her a popular, competent, and energizing conductress. The Mission weighed heavily on her heart and she was a faithful intercessor for the Lord's work.\\" The Rev. Stulting, Sr. (of Humansdorp), who had also lost his wife a few months earlier, led the memorial service on the afternoon of Tuesday, December 19, 1939, and spoke passionately of John 14:1 and Prov. 31:10. At the grave, tribute was pronounced by the elder Naas Kritzinger on behalf of the church council and by Mrs. P.B. Geldenhuys in the name of the VSB and Biduursusters (lay sister organizations). The congregation sisters laid a suitable stone between the church and the meeting hall.  The Rev. Du Toit accepts his emeritus  The weekend of May 25‚Äì26, 1941, the congregation members said goodbye to their longtime pastor, the longest-tenured in their history thus far. On Sunday morning, the Rev. Du Toit delivered a striking, practical farewell sermon to his packed church, recalling John 21:7: \\"It is the Lord who calls, uses, and rewards his servants.\\" On Monday afternoon, the next pastor came to Joubertina. As their farwell to the Rev. Du Toit, the church council recorded their appreciation for his \\"faithful services, courtesy, kindness, and helpfulness.\\" For a number of years, he served on the Cape Church's important Mission and Synod Commissions, and the Rev. Hopkins predicted in 1957 that \\"his and his wife's names will live on in the mission in particular\\" in Joubertina.  Sources  * (af) Hanekom, Dr. T.N. 1952. Die ho√´ toring. Die Ned. Geref.

Born in Christchurch to a well-known farming family, Deans became interested in art in his teen years. He studied fine arts at the Canterbury College School of Art before returning to the family farm for work. He volunteered for the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force on the outbreak of the Second World War, and was posted to the 20th Battalion. In 1941 he was appointed an assistant war artist, serving under Peter McIntyre. However, he was wounded during the Battle of Crete and became a prisoner of war. Allowed to paint during his captivity, his work was a useful record of life as a prisoner of war. After the war, he studied painting at the Sir John Cass Technical Institute in England before settling down on a lifestyle block in Canterbury. He was a prolific painter of the Canterbury hill country. Made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1995, he died in October 2011. Early life Deans was born on 2 December 1915 in Christchurch, New Zealand, one of two sons of Alister and Norma Deans. His father, Alister, was a scion of the Deans family, notable in Christchurch for being one of the earliest European settlers in the region, and was later killed at the Battle of Passchendaele. His mother was the daughter of the farmer Harry Knight. Austen Deans' early years were spent on the family farm near Malvern before, when he was 10, his mother moved to the Riccarton suburb in Christchurch. He was educated at Medbury School and at Christ's College. His interest in art developed when he was 12 years old, while on holidays at the family farm. He tramped into the hills taking painting and sketching materials with him. Family friends encouraged him in his art and when he finished his education, he decided to go to art school. Studying at the University of Canterbury towards a Bachelor of Arts concurrently with learning fine arts at the Canterbury College School of Art, he made the acquaintance of Bill Sutton. Despite being more interested in landscape work, he received much training in life drawing. Colin Lovell-Smith, Evelyn Page and Archibald Nicoll were influences. Deans graduated in 1937 and returned to the family farm to work. This financed his tramping trips to the Southern Alps where he would make several sketches and watercolours of the hill country. He received favourable reviews of his work at exhibitions at the School of Art Sketch Club and the Canterbury Arts Society. Dame Ngaio Marsh was an early supporter and soon he was making a number of sales of his work. Second World War 3 Days Out from New Zealand, 1940, a watercolour by Austen Deans of the troopship convoy transporting elements of the 2NZEF to the Middle East The outbreak of the Second World War disrupted Deans' plans to study at the Slade School of Fine Art in London. Instead, he volunteered for war service abroad with the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF). Posted to the 20th Battalion of the 2nd New Zealand Division, he was assigned to its intelligence section on account of his skills as an artist. His duties involved making and looking after maps but while off duty he continued to paint. By 1940, Deans was in the Middle East, where the 2NZEF had been transported for war service. He continued with his painting, doing landscapes of the Egypt countryside. His battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Howard Kippenberger, was supportive of his work. Deans later completed a portrait of Kippenberger which was used to illustrate his biography. In March 1941, the 20th Battalion was sent to Greece as part of the 2nd New Zealand Division. The British Government anticipated an invasion of Greece by the Germans and decided to send troops to support the Greeks, who were already engaged against the Italians in Albania. The 2nd New Zealand Division was one of a number of Allied units dispatched to Greece. The campaign was little more than a series of withdrawals but Deans still found time to make depictions of life in the Greek villages he saw. At the end of the fighting in Greece, Deans was among those evacuated to Crete. In the meantime, the New Zealand Government was considering appointing an official war artist to record the exploits of New Zealanders serving with the military. Deans had already been interviewed for the position the previous year and his application was supported by many in New Zealand, particularly from the Canterbury region. His mother even wrote to the Prime Minister Peter Fraser advocating for her son. Deans had been interviewed by the commander of 2NZEF, Major General Bernard Freyberg, the previous year but the position would eventually go to Peter McIntyre. However, shortly after Deans' arrival on Crete, he was told that he had been appointed assistant war artist. His first task was to paint depictions of New Zealanders serving in Greece, as McIntyre had not been present for that campaign. Although he was offered the opportunity to return to Egypt to start his work there, he preferred to remain on Crete. He was therefore caught up in the invasion that commenced on 20 May 1941. Paintings already worked up by that stage were in transit to Egypt and would duly arrive in New Zealand. In the meantime, Deans was badly wounded; he had inadvertently set off a land mine and had to be hospitalised with his legs full of shrapnel. A few days later, and unable to be evacuated, he was one of 520 wounded New Zealanders to be made prisoner of war (POW) by the Germans. =Prisoner of War= Severely wounded POW's loading up for repatriation, at Kokinia Hospital, Pireaus, 24 October 1941, by Austen Deans Flown to Athens by his captors, Deans then received medical treatment for several months at a hospital at Kokkinia, near Piraeus. While there, he was provided with pad and pencil by a fellow POW who wanted a portrait sketch to send to his family. This led onto further commissions from other POWs, as well as doctors and even guards. Paid a few pennies a time, he soon built up enough cash to organise, through a friendly Greek hospital worker, the purchase of painting supplies. He then set to work painting depictions of life at the hospital and surrounding landscapes which he would sell for money. While recuperating at Kokkinia, he met Australian modernist artists Justin O'Brien and Jesse Martin, both of whom were also POWs and who would influence Deans with their styles. When he recovered from his wounds, Deans was transferred to a POW camp at Toru≈Ñ, in occupied Poland. The trip there was arduous, travelling on cattle rail trucks, in a journey that took over two weeks. On arrival at the camp, Stalag XX-A, the POWs were put to work. Deans struggled initially, not accustomed to labouring after his prolonged period of medical treatment. He soon injured himself and consequently would be placed on light duties. As he had at Kokkinia, Deans soon found opportunities to express himself artistically at Stalag XX-A. Sourcing artist's materials through the Red Cross, he resumed doing portraits of POWs and as well as scenes of camp life. He was joined by O'Brien and Martin, once they had been transferred to the camp from Kokkinia. As an artist, his skills were in demand for forging documents to help with escape attempts. Deans himself had the opportunity to get away from his captors but refrained from doing so; while on a work party outside of the camp, he slipped away from his guards but realised he was too attached to his painting portfolio back at Stalag XX-A to leave them behind. He made his way back to the work party without his absence being noticed. Towards the end of 1943, Deans was transferred to a special POW camp in Germany, just outside of Berlin. Before his move, with the help of the Red Cross, he was able to arrange the shipping of half of his paintings to England. Conditions at the new POW camp, at Genshagen, were much better. Nominally, the POWs were selected for the camp based on their good behaviour but Deans soon discovered that its actual purpose encourage the prisoners to enlist in the British Free Corps. He stayed only a month before requesting a transfer to a camp in Austria that housed Australian and New Zealand POWs. A couple of his paintings from his time in Genshagen were given to another POW; these were sold to an art gallery in Christchurch in 1987 and are notable for their modernist traits. Deans was held in Austria at Stalag XVIII-A, near Wolfsberg for well over a year. By this time, the war in Europe was drawing to a close and conditions in the POW camp grew steadily harsher. Despite this, Deans still painted and sketched and by early 1945 had accumulated a portfolio of nearly 300 works. When the camp's POWS were ordered to force march towards Germany, he packaged them up for the Red Cross to collect. The collection of art works were never retrieved and were lost. While on the march, the guards' attention to their charges declined and security became lax with the war all but over. With a group of others, Deans was able to make contact with American forces and made his way back to England. Before he could leave for New Zealand, he had to appear at the trial of Roy Courlander, a New Zealander who had joined the British Free Corps. Once this was complete, he departed England aboard the SS Mooltan on 2 December 1945, arriving back in New Zealand by the end of the year. Later life Soon after his return to New Zealand, Deans married Liz , the daughter of a farmer. She was a family friend, and Deans had known her since she was an infant. She helped him settle back into civilian life, which he had been struggling with since coming back to New Zealand. In early 1948, the couple's first son was born and later that year the family went to England, Deans having accepted a scholarship to study at the Sir John Cass Technical Institute in Aldgate. He benefited from a higher standard of teaching than he had received to date; his tutors at the institute included Bernard Rice and Nicholas Egon, the latter being known for abstract art and landscapes. The institute instilled in him the confidence to pursue his traditional style of painting, rather than the modernist influences that he had dabbled with while a POW. The couple settled at Peel Forest, in Canterbury, after finishing their studies in England. Peel Forest, to the southwest of Christchurch, was an area that Austen saw as being similar to the West Coast but with a better climate. While in England, a second son had been born and the couple would add five more boys to their family by 1958. While Liz set up and ran a horse stud, Deans continued to work in landscapes. In 1962, he won first prize in the Kelliher Art Award with a landscape of the Southern Alps. He won again the following year with a depiction of the Rakaia Headwaters. He wrote an autobiography, Pictures by Austen Deans, and in 1970 this was published by A.H. & A.W. Reed. Sales did not justify further printings after the first run was complete. For a number of years, until his resignation in 1970, he was on the management committee of the National Art Gallery, which selected works for its collection. Despite his age, in his later years Deans made several painting expeditions to the Southern Alps, including an ascent of Aoraki/Mount Cook in 1974, as well as a trip to Antarctica in late 1981, sponsored by the New Zealand Government. He considered the work produced from his Antarctica visit to be some of the best of his career. By this stage of his life, the majority of his income was from commissioned works which he continued to accept even as he approached his late eighties. He received an appointment as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1995 Queen's Birthday Honours, for services to art. He died on 18 October 2011 at Princess Margaret's Hospital in Christchurch, having suffered a stroke several days previously. He was survived by his second wife Margaret. His first wife Liz had died in May 2004. In November 2018, a sculpture of Deans was unveiled at Peel Forest. Legacy Over the course of his painting career, Deans was a prolific producer of landscapes, often from the Canterbury region which meant his work was particularly popular amongst Cantabrians. However, some felt his paintings to be formulaic and clich√©d although technically accomplished. However, the work he produced as a POW was particularly well received by art critics although they have not aged well; many were completed with paints of poor quality or on acid cardboard and have deteriorated.

The page gave information for tuning the mandolin, hand positions on the neck and places near the soundhole to use the plectrum. Gabriele Leone (born Naples c. 1735 ‚Äì 1790) was an Italian musician and composer who lived in Paris during the middle and later part of the 18th century. A virtuoso on the violin and mandolin, he wrote an early mandolin method, Analytical method for mastering the violin or the mandolin in 1768 and composed for both instruments. He was an early teacher of the duo method, an advanced technique which would reappear in the 20th century, taught by Giuseppe Pettine in the United States. In the 1700s, the mandolin spread across Europe for the first time, through performances by masters of the instrument. Leone was one of those early masters who spread the mandolin in Europe, giving concerts and teaching. He spent time in London (1762‚Äì1763) as director of the London Opera before returning to Paris where he performed at the Concert Spirituel from 1760 to 1766. One of his students was Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orl√©ans, the father of King Louis Philippe I (the last French king). Leone was born in Naples about 1835. While he was a boy, what we now call the Neapolitan mandolin was being perfected by the Vinnaccia family, about 1844‚Äì1850. That Leone played and taught the Neapolitan mandolin is confirmed by his mandolin method, which shows a picture of the 8-stringed instrument and its tuning. Works Title page from Analytical method for mastering the violin or the mandolin.

He referred to himself on the covers of his works as Mr Leone de Naple (Monsieur Leone of Naples). Concert Advertisement for London concert at Hickford's Long Room with Gabriele Leone, March 17, 1766 in London. Leone performed one of his own pieces, as well as one from Emanuele Barbella. Composer Mattia Vento directed the concert. Also part of the concert was violinist composer Fran√ßois-Hippolyte Barth√©l√©mon and his wife, singer Polly Young, and the Brothers Colla who played colasciones. His mandolin method was meant to help students of the violin switch to the mandolin, \\"from bow to feather\\" without the need for a teacher, using sheet music marked with \\"conventional signs\\" to guide learners. Feathers were used as plectrums in that era, as they had been when playing the mandore. The method contained 26 dancing tunes, 6 minuets, 2 duos, a sonata and some airs. =Books= *1768, Paris, M√©thode raisonn√©e pour passer du Violon √† la Mandoline (Analytical method for mastering the violin or the mandolin) =Music= *1767, Paris, 6 Sonates pour mandoline et basse continue, Livre 1 opus 1 (6 Sonatas for mandolin and basso continuo, Book 1 opus 1) *1770, Paris and Lyon, Six sonates de mandoline et basse marqu√©es des signes suivant la nouvelle m√©thode opus 2 (Six sonatas of mandolin and bass marked with signs according to the new method opus 2) *1772, Paris, [6] Duo pour deux violons qui peuvent se jouer sur la mandoline et sur le par-dessus [de viole] (6 Duets for two violins that can be played on the mandolin and descant [viol]) Recordings *2015 Leone: Six sonates pour la mandoline et basse, Livre I, played by Maria Lucia Barros, Florentino Calvo, Ana Yepes References Italian mandolinists Italian Baroque composers Italian violinists Italian classical mandolinists Settecento composers 18th-century male musicians 1730s births 1790 deaths External links *6 Violin or Mandolin Duets sheet music *Analytical method for mastering the violin or the mandolin in French *Discussion of English transcription of Leone's method.

It is a centre-right coalition cabinet of the Centre Party, right-wing populist Conservative People's Party and conservative Isamaa. Following the defeat for the sitting Ratas' first cabinet at the 2019 elections and the loss of majority in the parliament Centre Party initiated coalition talks with the third largest Conservative People's Party and fourth largest Isamaa. Although the election-winning Reform party offered to form a coalition with J√ºri Ratas' Centre Party, Ratas turned down the offer. This left the winners of the elections, Reform Party, with no chance to form a majority cabinet. Leader of the Reform Party, Kaja Kallas, however went on to propose a minority cabinet formed by the Reform and Social Democrats, but it did not gain the necessary number of votes in the parliament. Coalition partners nonetheless faced three rebel MPs with Centre MP Raimond Kaljulaid quitting the Centre Party in protest against the inclusion of EKRE in the coalition. On 17 April 2019 the new cabinet got approval of Riigikogu with the support of 55 out of 101 MPs with one Isamaa rebel MP and former Centre MP Kaljulaid voting against with the opposition. Incidents and controversies =Coalition formation= Ratas had previously ruled out forming a coalition with EKRE during the election campaign because of differences between their views. The subsequent reversal of his stance and the inclusion of EKRE by Ratas in coalition talks after the elections was met with local and international criticism. In a poll conducted after the start of the coalition talks, the party of J√ºri Ratas further lost support. =Gender equality= The cabinet faced criticism for having only two women, Centre Mailis Reps and Isamaa Riina Solman, with Conservative People's Party fielding a full male line-up for their portfolios. Conservative People's later also named a female minister, Kert Kingo, after the resignation of Marti Kuusik. The Chairman of Conservative People's Party and Minister of the Interior Mart Helme faced criticism for calling president Kersti Kaljulaid an \\"emotionally heated woman\\". =Freedom of speech= A public debate on freedom of speech started after controversial actions by the new cabinet parties. On 28 March 2019 Conservative People's proposed new Minister of Finance, Martin Helme, demanded that Estonian Public Broadcasting (ERR) would ban and punish journalists who had criticised his party. On 22 April journalist Vilja Kiisler left Postimees, one of the biggest newspapers in Estonia, due to differences with the paper‚Äôs newly appointed editor-in-chief on her op-ed about the policies of the Conservative People‚Äôs Party. The editor-in-chief Peeter Helme is the nephew of the leader of the Conservative People‚Äôs Party Mart Helme and the newspaper is owned by a member and financier of the third government party Pro Partia. On 26 April journalist Ahto Lobjakas announced quitting the ERR where, he said, he was given a choice between self-censorship and leaving. On the swearing-in of the new cabinet president Kersti Kaljulaid wore a sweatshirt emblazoned with the slogan S√µna on vaba (the word/speech is free) as a statement of the importance of the freedom of speech. On 14 May 2019 Minister of the Interior Mart Helme accused ERR's United States correspondent Maria-Ann Rohem√§e of deceiving and lying. ERR responded with public statement in support of their journalist and condemning attacks against journalists. = \\"OK\\" hand gesture= Conservative People's Party of Estonia Mart Helme Minister of the Interior and his son Minister of Finance Martin Helme Coursed some controversy by publicly flashed the \\"OK\\" hand gesture which is a hand signal that has been misidentified as a white supremacist symbol. MP Jaak Madison commented afterwards, that the symbols were used as ‚Äúpure trolling‚Äù in order to rile the media and the party‚Äôs opponents. In May 2019, when Marine Le Pen was visiting Estonia for discussions with EKRE, MP Ruuben Kaalep and Le Pen took a selfie together with both flashing the same gesture. =Resignation of Marti Kuusik= In the next morning after the elections Conservative People's proposed new Minister of Foreign Trade and Information Technology Marti Kuusik was caught by the police speeding (74 km/h in 50 km/h zone) and driving under the influence. Both prime minister J√ºri Ratas and Conservative People's Party stated that they do not see this as a reason to replace Kuusik. On 29 April 2019 reports emerged of alleged history of Kuusik's domestic violence including breaking his wife's arm bone twice. Kuusik denied the accusations. Following the emergency meeting with Kuusik and Conservative People's delegation Ratas decided that there is no need to replace Kuusik and that he can take the oath of office. Before Kuusik took the oath president Kaljulaid left the room, leaving Kuusik to bow for the empty seat. Kaljulaid promised to be the first to apologize to Kuusik should the accusations not be true. On the same day a criminal investigation was launched to determine whether the accusations were true. On 30 April 2019 the Director General of the Police and the Prosecutor General gave Ratas an overview of the collected evidence after which Ratas handed over Kuusk's letter of resignation to the President. Kuusk denied all the accusations reasoning that he resigns to ensure the stability of the government and to protect his family while focusing on disproving the accusations. Chairman of the Conservative People's Party of Estonia Mart Helme heavily criticized the ousting of Kuusik, calling it a witch hunt. The Conservative Party struggled to find a nominee with a number of people declining the offer. Finally two weeks after Kuusik's resignation Kert Kingo was appointed as a replacement for Kuusik. =Resignation of Kert Kingo= On 25 October 2019 Minister of Foreign Trade and IT Kert Kingo resigned after being caught lying in front of the Riigikogu about the appointment of her new adviser who had posted sexually offensive remarks in Facebook. On 2 November 2019 Kaimar Karu was appointed as a replacement for Kingo. =Dismissal of Mart J√§rvik= On 25 November 2019 Prime Minister J√ºri Ratas proposed the dismissal of the Minister of Rural Affairs Mart J√§rvik after a commission of inquiry led by the Secretary of State Taimar Peterkop had found that J√§rvik had exceeded his authority and made inconsistent statements regarding findings of Listeria bacteria at a fish packing plant. After J√§rvik's dismissal by the President, he was followed in the position by Arvo Aller. =Recalling of Kaimar Karu= On the morning of 17 April 2020, Minister of Foreign Trade and Information Technology Kaimar Karu announced on social media that the chairman of the Conservative People's Party Mart Helme has recalled him from the government. Helme accused Karu for not respecting party values, including their anti immigration views. Karu had been under strain for not supporting changes made to the Aliens Act. Raul Siem was appointed as a replacement for Karu. Ministers The coalition agreed to continue with fifteen portfolios equally allocated between the parties with each party holding five.

The peak lies northwest of Dorado Needle and northwest of Eldorado Peak. It can be seen from the North Cascades Highway west of Marblemount at a road pullout alongside the Skagit River. Perdition Peak is the highest peak of Backbone Ridge, and other peaks on this ridge include In Spirit Point, Cervical Point, Thoracic Point, Lumbar Point, The Sacrum, and The Coccyx. The first ascent of the peak was made on August 27, 1967, by John Roper via the serrated west ridge.\\"The Coccyx,\\" \\"Perdition Peak\\" - The American Alpine Journal americanalpineclub.org Being a doctor, Roper named some of his many first ascents for anatomical parts of the body. Precipitation runoff and glacier meltwater from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Skagit River. Climate Perdition Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. Perdition Peak (left) and Eldorado Peak seen from North Cascades Highway near Rockport, Washington The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured and shaped the landscape. A small glacial remnant lies on the south slope of Perdition Peak, whereas the northern slope maintains the more extensive Perdition and Backbone Glaciers. The U-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Biography He was the son of a painter named Anton Palko (died 1754), about whom little is known. he began his studies at home, then went to Vienna, where he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts. In the 1740s, he was enrolled at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia and came under the influence of Giuseppe Crespi. After returning, he worked in Bratislava, Kromƒõ≈ô√≠≈æ and Brno; finally settling in Dresden, where he painted frescoes depicting the life of Saint John of Nepomuk. In 1752, he was appointed a court painter for the Electorate of Saxony, but moved on to Prague before a year was over, having received a commission from the Society of Jesus to paint frescoes at St. Nicholas Church. However, the Painter's Guild protested, noting that he was neither a guild member nor a citizen of Prague and was therefore undesirable. The following year, a Magistrate ruled that he could finish his work, on the grounds that being a court painter was equivalent to guild membership. Biography @ Czech WikiSource He never became a citizen of Prague, but stayed there for many years. Most of his works appear to have been frescoes or altarpieces. At some point, he was married, as there are baptismal records for a son, Jan Xaver, dating from 1756. The mother's name is given as Marie Anna Bursch, from Saxony. Exact information regarding his death is not available. He apparently died in Prague in 1767, although other sources indicate that he moved to Munich in hopes of becoming a court painter for the Electorate of Bavaria, but was unsuccessful and died there, in poverty, in 1770.

The video featured a boy dancing while four girls clapped and sang along. It is claimed that, when the footage appeared in the public domain, a jirga was held where it was decided that the participants, as well as the boy who filmed the video, should be killed. Afzal Kohistani, elder brother of the two boys involved in the video, went against local tribal tradition and brought the case to national attention; first asking for protection for the participants and then claiming that the girls in the video had been murdered. Kohistani campaigned for seven years to keep the case in the public eye until he was murdered in March 2019. In September 2019, three men were convicted of murdering three of the girls from the video and were sentenced to life imprisonment. The status of the fourth and fifth girl remain unconfirmed. Events =The video= Four girls - Bazeegha, Sereen Jan, Begum Jan and Amina - are seen clapping and singing; a fifth girl, Shaheen, is also in attendance but doesn't appear in the video. In a separate shot, a man is seen dancing, while a second man records both him and the girls. The video was reportedly filmed at a wedding celebration in the remote, and strictly conservative, Kohistan region, where cultural traditions are enforced by jirgas. In 2012, the video was leaked online and, as the girls and men were from different tribes, mixing in that environment was forbidden. A jirga was convened where it was decided that the participants should be killed. =Investigations and legal rulings= The incident reached national media in June 2012 when Afzal Kohistani, the elder brother of the boys connected to the video, alleged that the girls had been killed on the orders of the Azadkhel tribe jirga. Officials from the area denied that this had taken place and claimied that the girls were alive. The case was disposed of after rights activists and government officials made two trips to the remote village to meet the girls, as ordered by the Supreme Court of Pakistan, and initially confirmed that at least four of the girls were alive. Dr Farzana Bari, a woman's rights activist who made both trips to meet the girls, initially agreed with the conclusions reached but then lodged her dissent. In response to the closure of the case, Afzal Kohistani asserted that imposters had been presented to the investigation team and that the real girls were dead. He filed an application to reopen the case which resulted in three of his brothers being shot dead. On 8 February 2014, a former member of the Provincial Assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa from Kohistan, publicly claimed that the four girls seen in the video had been murdered and this prompted Afzal Kohistani to file another petition for the girls to be produced in court. After this was rejected, he took it to the Supreme Court where, in November 2016, another commission was ordered. The defence lawyer argued that the girls couldn't be brought before the commission because of local tribal restrictions making it a matter of honour and shame. That argument was rejected by Justice Ejaz Afzal and sessions judge, Shoaib Khan, and other officials, were dispatched to meet the girls. Four girls duly appeared before them and inconsistences were noted around the age of the girls produced and those who appeared in the video five years prior. In relation to Amina, the report submitted by the commission to the Supreme court stated: Similar discrepancies were found in each case. Farzana Bari made a fresh statement to the court reiterating her earlier concerns that the girls seen in the video were not those who had been presented before the commission. She stated: In August 2018, on the order of the Supreme Court, the Kohistan police registered a first information report for the alleged honour killing of the five girls connected to the video. In December 2018, the investigation found that two out of five victims were reportedly alive and that three of the girls - Siran Jan, Begum Jan and Bazeegha - had, indeed, been killed. =Afzal Kohistani= Afzal Kohistani Afzal Kohistani was a Salehkhel tribesman from the Kolai-Palas District, he was one of eight children. The family lived comfortably and were well respected within the village community of Gadaar. At various times, Afzal ran a tailoring shop, clerked for a lawyer and traded bee honey, he studied law in his free time. In 2010, he was living in Mansehra City with his wife and two of his younger brothers, Bin Yasir and Gul Nazar. Around this time Yasir and Nazar returned to the family village of Gadaar, which is where the video was later filmed. When the video went viral Yasir and Nazar were arrested, two of their brothers and other families from the Salehkhel tribe left Gaddar and moved to Allai, where they'd been offered protection from the Azadkhel tribe, to whom the girls in the video belonged. As opposed to following the tribal tradition, Afzal tried to prevent the sentence of the jirga from being carried out. When that failed he went to the media and repeatedly raised litigation in order to prove that the murders had taken place. As a result, three of Afzal's brothers, who stayed behind in Gadaar, were murdered in January 2013 and Afzal's house was firebombed. On 6 March 2019, he was shot dead in Abbottabad, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. =Convictions= In January 2014, six men from the Azadkhel tribe were convicted of murdering Afzal Kohistani's three brothers. One was sentenced to death and five others were sentenced to 25 years in prison, all were relatives of the girls from the video. Six other men, including the jirga chief who allegedly ordered the initial murders, were acquitted. In 2017, the convictions of the six men were overturned by the high court. In September 2019, the father of Bazeegha, the father of Sereen Jan and the brother of Begum Jan, were convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison. Five other men were acquitted.

Phone Interview by Sally A Barrilla. April 25, 2019.  Early Life and education  Michelle Soto was born in Brooklyn, NY on to an Ecuadorian and Puerto Rican family. When she was eight years old, she moved to Queens from Brooklyn where she lived for the majority of her life. However, she spent most of her time in Brooklyn until she left New York City to attend Bay Path University in Massachusetts. Currently, Soto is a fifth grade English special education teacher and has been involved with the East Harlem Tutorial Program for two years. Initially, while attending college, Soto did not know that she wanted to teach and took on a few interests. She first majored in legal studies with the intention of becoming a lawyer. However, once she realized that it was not of her interest, Soto then switched her major to English and took on a summer fellowship to teach at her former middle school. Upon realizing how there were a little number of teachers of color in schools, Soto discovered she wanted to become a teacher. Once she achieved her dream of teaching, Soto knew that she loves to work with young individuals who she believes must recognize their power and strength outside of the classroom and in their school.  Personal life  Growing up in Williamsburg, Brooklyn and enriching herself in the culture, Soto felt inspired to be a writer after noting how much history was around her. Soto also learned how much gentrification was occurring in her old neighborhood; therefore, persuading her to write about it. Soto is deeply committed to teaching and firmly believes that her students, as well as her, have the potential to create change to the education system.  Literary Contributions and Themes in Writing  Soto is a poet and author of the works Boricua (2017), Mam√¨ (2017), and Pelo Malo (2015). She is a member of Project X, a well- known non-profit arts organization that was founded by longtime Bronx resident Noel Qui√±ones. Several subjects that Soto feels passionate to write about are such as her old neighborhood, the recent events occurring in Puerto Rico, her strong bond with her family, and more. She also enjoys reading the works her students have created and encourages them to see just how strong they truly are. Soto aspires for her work to open people's eyes about the struggles many people of color experience especially from the current political crisis, challenges people in Puerto Rico face, and much more topics. Coming from two families of mixed cultures, she likes hearing all about the stories her family shares with her. She has said that some of her favorite authors are Elizabeth Acevedo, Jos√© Olivarez, Aja Monet, Warsan Shire, and Brandon Melendez.

The show has distinguished itself by remaining genre-agnostic and focusing on the quality and potential of the artist and their creative output. The Wknd Sessions is often seen by artists in the Southeast Asian music scene as \\"a platform for them to gain greater prominence, and a vital avenue for artists to gain exposure to audiences they don't get to reach in live gigs\\". It is also noted for having the uncanny ability to seek out unique upcoming acts from Southeast Asia. The show, its branding and digital assets are owned by The Wknd. History Season 1, episode 1 of The Wknd Sessions aired on 14 December 2008. As of April 2019, a total of 11 seasons and 110 episodes have been produced. During this run, The Wknd Sessions has featured acts from Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Philippines and Brunei across a diverse range of music genres, such as pop, punk, metalcore, alternative, singer-songwriters and spoken word. The show is worked on by a core team of fixed personnel, with a revolving production cast. Participation on The Wknd Sessions was ‚Äì and to a large extent, still is ‚Äì voluntary in nature, worked on by a group of like-minded people with a common goal of advancing the music scene. This work ethic continues to be the defining principle of the show. Premise Artist selection for The Wknd Sessions is done via the show's creative team, who act in a similar capacity as a traditional A&R; executive role. As the team is predominantly made up of musicians and contributors to the Southeast Asian music scene, they constantly scout for talent by attending music shows. The team also relies on their extensive networks within the community to obtain word-of-mouth recommendations of noteworthy artists. Both these aspects act as a natural filter, allowing the show's creative team to objectively gauge artists material, their commitment and potential contribution to the regional music scene. Due to this organic approach to talent scouting, The Wknd Sessions does not accept unsolicited requests to appear on the show. The Wknd Sessions also adheres to a strict principle of not allowing acts directly associated with its creative team members to appear on the show. Format Each episode of The Wknd Sessions is broadcast via The Wknd's website (although the videos live on YouTube), and consists of a web article and writeup about the artist, three music performance videos and one interview video. All music performances are performed live ‚Äì no overdubs are done ‚Äì and recording is done in one take ‚Äì meaning that any mistakes are included in the final output. =Pre- production= The Wknd's creative team spends approximately two to three months in pre-production. In this stage, the team collectively decides on the ten acts to be included in the season. The selection criteria is varied, and no formal rules are used. A combination of gut feel, together with data gathered from the team attending shows, is used to whittle down the list from an initial pool of 30‚Äì50 acts. Early episodes (particularly in seasons 1 through 3) had minimal production consistency, due to the limited resources the team had. This necessarily meant that acts featured were predominantly acoustic-based and were mostly of the singer-songwriter types. In later seasons, a form of curation was added into the pre-production process, to give a balanced view across many different genres, but still providing some form of dynamic across the ten episodes in the season. =Recording and post- production= Recording of the ten artists for each season is done over one weekend ‚Äì with setup work happening on the Friday, and recording proper taking place on Saturday and Sunday. All thirty songs and ten interviews are recorded live back-to-back, with no audience present. In the earlier seasons, the venue of the recording varied from episode to episode. A fixed venue was used from Season 3 onwards ‚Äì typically any performance space that was available for booking ‚Äì which gave the production more visual consistency. Post-production typically takes anywhere from two to three months. The artist themselves have no creative input into the final outcome, both in terms of the audio and video. This allows the show to produce a consistent and integrated audio- visual result. =Release= Each episode is released on The Wknd's website. The video itself is uploaded to The Wknd's YouTube channel. Video releases are staggered across multiple days: * Friday: the first music performance video is put up on the episode's page on the website, along with the interview video * the following Monday: the second performance video is added to the episode page * the following Wednesday: the third performance video is added Audio from The Wknd Sessions is also made available on various streaming platforms like Spotify and Deezer, as well as online stores like iTunes.

Presented by the Art Gallery of South Australia (AGSA) in association with the South Australian Government and BHP, it alternates between a city-wide festival in one year and an exhibition at AGSA in other years.It includes an annual Art Fair as well as artist talks, performances and events. It seeks to present Indigenous Australian history and culture as a legacy to be shared by all Australians, showcasing the expansiveness of contemporary Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander art \\"on a scale that hasn‚Äôt been seen before‚Äù. History Initiated by AGSA in 2015, that exhibition was said to be the \\"most ambitious exhibition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander art in [AGSA's] 134-year history\\". The word tarnanthi is a Kaurna word from the traditional owners of the Adelaide Plains, the Kaurna people, meaning \\"to rise, come forth, spring up or appear\\", or \\"to emerge\\", like the sun at first light. It signifies new beginnings. As artistic director since the inaugural event, Nici Cumpston, a Barkindji artist and curator based at AGSA, collaborated with a group of elders and community members who speak the language to help translate the word used as the name. She also collaborated with many others, representing arts centres from all over Australia. Those hailing from the South Australian desert have been well-represented: the Anangu, Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara people from the APY lands. By 2017 it had expanded to include an Indigenous art fair at the Tandanya National Aboriginal Cultural Institute, as well as a large number of satellite exhibitions spread throughout Adelaide and beyond, featuring more than 1000 artists. Exhibitions =2015= The 2015 exhibition included work by Warwick Thornton, film-maker from Alice Springs, as well as Dinni Kunoth Petyarre and Josie Kunoth Petyarre, residents of Utopia in Central Australia, with artworks exploring the world of \\"bush footy\\" through painted hand carvings of figures representing 16 AFL teams. The whole event was a huge success, featuring works from more than 1000 artists and attracting more than 300,000 visitors. =2017= In 2017, artists from the APY lands produced several enormous works for installation at AGSA, including two paintings on repurposed canvas mailbags, both stretched to three metres by five. 21 men collaborated on one work, 24 women on the other, with contributions spanning seven communities from the far northwest of SA: Pukatja, Amata, Mimili, Indulkana, Nyapari, Fregon and Kalka. A centrepiece of the 2017 event was a part of the ongoing Kulata Tjuta (‚ÄúMany Spears‚Äù) project that would have than 600 spears suspended from the ceiling of AGSA in the shape of a mushroom cloud, representing the ongoing impact of the 1950s and 60s British nuclear testing on Anangu country. =2018= The 2018 exhibition at AGSA featured the work of John Mawurndjul's bark paintings in the first major exhibition of his work in Australia. =2019= In July 2019 it was announced that the Tarnanthi Festival would run from 18 to 27 Oct 2019, with the Art Fair at Tandanya on the opening weekend and the AGSA exhibition continuing until 27 January 2020. The exhibition will feature exhibits from over 1000 artists from all over the continent and the Tiwi Islands, ranging in age from 15 to 81 years and working in a wide range of media: painting, photography, printmaking, carving, sculpture, moving image, works on paper and textiles. Opening night was on 17 October, with Yol≈ãu rap artist Baker Boy performing at the opening event outside the Gallery on North Terrace. An exhibition of colonial artworks alongside the tools and objects of Aboriginal people, accompanied by carefully researched text and commentary by Wiradjuri/Kamilaroi artist Jonathan Jones, writer and researcher Bruce Pascoe and historian Bill Gammage, is the subject of an exhibition entitled Bunha-bunhanga: Aboriginal agriculture in the south- east, mounted in the AGSA's Elder Wing, Gallery 1 and the Museum of Economic Botany.

Two separate licenses on the 1240 kHz frequency, and an FM station on 100.3 MHz, used the call letters. The first KWJB signed on in 1938, being joined by the FM station in 1958. After going silent October 29, 1960, the licenses of both stations were ordered revoked by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 1961 along with all other stations owned by Gila Broadcasting. A second AM station in Globe on the same frequency, but a different license, operated as KWJB between 1969 and 1975. History =Original KWJB= The Sims Broadcasting Company put KWJB on the air in the summer of 1938, broadcasting on 1210 kHz. In 1939, KWJB joined KTAR's Arizona Broadcasting Company (ABC) network as part of the latter's expansion from two stations to five. Broadcasting initially as a daytime-only station, it was approved for unlimited operation in October 1939 with 250 watts. In March 1940, the station relocated to new studios in downtown Globe. The station moved to 1240 with NARBA reallocation in 1941, and Sims sold the station in 1943 to the Gila Broadcasting Company, owned by Safford theater owner Louis F. Long. Even though KWJB was an affiliate of KTAR's ABC chain, and KTAR and three other stations in the seven-station network were NBC affiliates, it would not be until March 1, 1944, that KWJB would join NBC. Eight months later, the station suffered a tower collapse when a gust of wind brought the structure down during the replacement of its guy wires. The studios and transmitter were relocated again in 1949 to a new building on U.S. 60-70. In December 1951, disc jockey Robert Hawkins resigned to take a post with musicians Les Paul and Mary Ford. KWJB was approved in 1953 to build a cable television system to provide reception of Phoenix stations received at Pinal Peak in the Globe- Miami area. Four years later, Gila filed with the FCC to build a TV station on channel 34 at Globe. The application was withdrawn in a contentious battle with the Community TV Project, which sought to build television translators for Globe and complained that the channel 34 application was made \\"as a subterfuge\\" to keep the translators away; Gila said that its proposed station could not coexist with translators of Phoenix stations. By the time the TV station was filed, Gila also held the construction permit for the first FM station in Gila County, KWJB-FM 100.3, which signed on in 1958. The call letters had been assigned in November 1956. =Change to KZOW and Gila closure= However, the two stations would not last long into the 1960s. In March, the Federal Communications Commission ordered Gila to state why their license renewal applications, covering KZOW/KWJB-FM and its four sister stations, should not be designated for hearing. The commission charged that a management contract between Gila and Radio Associates, Inc., had allowed the latter company to assume complete control of the stations; that the company had misstated the ownership of its president, Louis F. Long, in the broadcaster; and a breach of contract in which Globe station manager Willard Shoecraft and his wife had paid in an option agreement to buy three stations, which was then broken when Gila sought to sell all of them to the Earl Perrin Co. of Chicago. The FCC also alleged that some Gila stations had refused to join the CONELRAD civil defense system, an accusation denied by Gila, which stated that it had installed the system at great difficulty due to the remote location of the stations. In April 1960, KWJB became KZOW, call letters that would be used for the final six months of its existence. On October 15, 1960, at a hearing in Phoenix, Gila asked the FCC to approve the renewal of the Gila stations' license and their sale to Perrin. The stations went dark on October 29 despite the FCC denying Gila's request to take them silent, with Gila citing the fact that nervous employees fearing for their futures were already leaving their jobs and the company's financial state for the closures. In denying the request, the FCC warned that the affected communities had no other radio stations. In August 1962, Arizona radio station owner Carleton W. Morris asked for FCC permission to set up new stations using the Gila facilities, having paid $100,000 for their equipment. The call letters were canceled on January 17, 1963, and 1240 AM remained silent for most of the rest of the decade. (100.3 remained silent for almost 20 years until a new KIKO-FM signed on in October 1980.) =Second KWJB/KPPR= James Mace applied in 1969 to build a radio station on the 1240 allocation in Globe left vacant by KWJB. This new station took the KWJB call letters on March 22, 1969, and went on the air later in the year. The station went silent in June 1975 after being sold to James H. Adams-owned Broadcasters Inc. for $52,500. The station returned to the air on August 6 with a country format. After the sale, however, KWJB was beset by technical problems that prompted the station to place newspaper advertising apologizing to listeners. The new station applied for the call letters KPPR, a nod to Globe's copper mining heritage, and received them in November 1975. KPPR folded sometime between 1975 and 1978. Mace then made an application in December 1977, mutually exclusive with the renewal of the KPPR license, for 1240 kHz. That application was granted in 1980FCC History Cards for KJAA (KGJM) and went on the air as KGJM, becoming today's KJAA.

During Australia's summer of 2019-20, Celebrity Name Game moved to 10 Bold as a result of extended 90-minute 10 News First bulletins. Celebrity Name Game eventually ceased airing in May 2020.https://tvtonight.com.au/2020/06/axed-celebrity-name-game.html Gameplay =Main game= The game involves two teams, each consisting of two contestants who are related or know each other. They are joined by two guest celebrities who assist the teams for all but the third segment of the show, attempting to identify the names of popular culture subjects like celebrities, fictional characters, place names, or film and television titles. In the first two rounds, each team is assigned one of the celebrities, who then will switch teams for the second round. Each of the three-member teams are presented with a category containing ten names. One person will give clues, trying to get the other two to guess the names. Successful guesses earn money. An illegal clue (saying the name or part of the name, spelling the name, or rhyming the name) voids that name. Each turn lasts for 45 seconds. In the first round, one team is chosen to play first, and chooses one of two categories presented, leaving the second team to play the remaining category. In the second round, the second team plays first and chooses the first category. In round one, the celebrity gives the clues while turning back and forth to alternately face each contestant, and each correct answer is worth $100, up to $1,000 total. In round two, one of the two contestants gives clues while alternately facing either the remaining partner or the assigned celebrity, and each answer is worth $200, up to $2,000 total. In the third round, the contestants go head to head while Denyer gives the clues to names under a specific category. The contestants buzz in to make a guess. If neither contestant buzzes in after a while, Denyer can start giving out clues that are normally illegal, all the way up to simply saying the name. A right answer earns money for the team that answered, but a wrong answer grants the money to the opponent. The first answer is worth $100 and each successive answer increases in value by $100. Winnings in this round are added to the money accumulated in the first two rounds, and whichever team reaches $3,000 or more first is the winner, keeps the cash, and goes on to the bonus round to play for the prize of $10,000. If no team reaches $3,000 before time is called, the team in the lead at the end of the round wins the game. If the game ends in a tie, one final name is given; a team who buzzes in with a correct answer wins the game, but a wrong answer results in an automatic loss. =Bonus round= In the bonus round, there is no particular category. The names of people, characters, places, shows or things are hidden behind ten numbered squares. The contestants take turns giving the clues to both celebrities. One contestant is placed in a soundproof booth while the other gives clues. The current giver starts describing when a name or picture is exposed. If the celebrity receivers get it right, the name stays revealed. Passing on a name re-conceals it. This round lasts for a total of 75 seconds, the first contestant has 45 seconds, and the second has 30 seconds. If the first clue giver provides an illegal clue to a name, that name is replaced by a different one for the second clue giver. Any illegal clue by the second clue giver, however, ends the round immediately. Getting all ten increases the team's total winnings to $10,000.

He was also known for his work as an inventor and aeronautical engineer.  Early life  Loving was born in Detroit, Michigan on February 4, 1916. His father, Harding Clay Loving, was the first black optometrist in Michigan. Loving became interested in aviation at age ten, when a de Havilland biplane flew over his house. He attended Cass Technical High School, where he studied aeronautics.  Aviation career  After graduating high school, Loving took a job with his former aeromechanics teacher, George Tabraham. He became a licensed aircraft mechanic, and began to build a ground trainer aircraft. Loving's trainer received Mechanix Illustrated's Project of the Month award and was displayed at the Detroit City Airport. In 1936, he was hired by the Detroit Department of Recreation to teach model aircraft building. He continued his own education with an accelerated course in drafting and engineering at Highland Park Junior College. Loving was rejected from both the U.S. Air Cadet Corps and Detroit's Cass Aero Club because of his race. He joined the Ace Flying Club, an organization for black aviators, where he met fellow aviator Earsly Taylor. The two would become close friends and business partners. After Tabraham became head of the Aero Mechanics High School, he hired Loving as an instructor. As with his previous job, Loving taught model aircraft building. He was the first black teacher at the school, which had an all-white student body at the time. Loving said in an interview that he initially only taught boys, until \\"the girls found out that my class was fun and wanted to join. The authorities didn't want a black man teaching white girls but the principal put his foot down and girls got in my class.\\" While still teaching high school, Loving co-founded the Wayne Aircraft Company with Taylor. It was the first black-owned aircraft company in Michigan. Like Loving, Taylor had another full-time job, so progress was slow. Loving and Taylor joined the Civil Air Patrol during World War II. After being rejected by the local squadrons because of their race, they formed their own, all-black group, Squadron 639-5. With Loving as executive officer and Taylor as commanding officer, the squadron provided flight training, pre-military training, and classes in parachute jumping. For the latter, they were nicknamed the Parachute Squadron. In 1943, Loving was laid off from the Aero Mechanics High School. He began working seven days a week on the Ford Motor Company's assembly line, while still working at the Wayne Aircraft Company and training pilots for the Civil Air Patrol. With little time to rest, Loving developed long-term fatigue. On July 30, 1944, Loving set out on a routine flight at Wings Airport in Utica, Michigan. Flying on only two hours of sleep, he failed to realize he had lost too much altitude. Loving's glider crashed, crushing his legs. Both legs were amputated below the knee, and Loving spent eighteen months in the hospital. He and Taylor closed the Wayne Aircraft Company during this time. A month after being fitted with wooden prosthetics, Loving was approved for a driver's license. By 1946, he was flying again. He once said that \\"the nice thing about artificial legs is that you can be as tall as you like and wear any shoe size you want.\\" Loving and Taylor opened the Wayne School of Aeronautics in 1947. Over the course of his career, Loving designed and flew five aircraft. In 1949, he began building a midget-class racer called Loving's Love. Loving's Love had a single seat and inverted gull wings, and could reach speeds of 215-255 miles per hour. Loving entered it in the 1951 National Air Races, becoming the first double amputee and the first African-American licensed as a racing pilot. Loving's Love won the Experimental Aircraft Association's Most Outstanding Design award in 1955. In either 1953 or 1954, Loving flew Loving's Love to Kingston, Jamaica to visit Taylor, who had opened a flying school there with her new husband, Carl Barnett. Loving later married Carl's sister, Clare Therese Barnett. In 1955, Loving enrolled in Wayne State University as an aeronautical engineering major. He closed the Wayne School of Aeronautics two years later. After graduating, Loving became an engineer at the Wright- Patterson Air Force Base, where he worked on methods of measuring clear-air turbulence.  Personal life  Loving married Clare Therese Barnett in 1955. They adopted two children, Paul Leslie and Michelle Stephanie. The family settled in Yellow Springs, Ohio. Loving continued to fly for nine years after his retirement, until heart problems caused his license to be revoked. Clare Loving was reportedly \\"more worried about his daily bike excursions around town than his adventures in the air.\\" Loving lived in Yellow Springs until his death from colon cancer in 1998.  Recognition and award  Loving's Love is displayed at the Experimental Aircraft Association Air Education Museum in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. In 2000, the Neal V. Loving scholarship was created to help high school students from Maryland's Upper Shore attend the Patrick School of Aeronautics. *Meritorious Civilian Service Award * Michigan Aviation Hall of Fame *Wayne State University College of Engineering Hall of Fame *Organization of Black Airline Pilots Distinguished Achievement Award References African-American aviators Aviators from Michigan African-American engineers American air racers Recipients of the Meritorious Service Decoration American aerospace engineers American flight instructors 1916 births 1998 deaths Deaths from colorectal cancer Wayne State University alumni People from Detroit People from Yellow Springs, Ohio ","title":"Neal Vernon Loving"},{"id":"60591130","text":"Bronwyn Hayward at the School Strike for Climate march in Christchurch, 15 March 2019 Bronwyn Mary Hayward is a New Zealand political scientist.

While two countries do not have embassies in respective capitals, with Portugal only has an honorary consulate in Colombo, they share a long, close and historical relationship. History The Portuguese first arrived to Sri Lanka during the late 15th and early 16th century in the island. The Sri Lankan Sinhalese of the Kingdom of Kotte would soon clash with the Portuguese, in which the Sri Lankans were defeated and incorporated into Portuguese territory. Later the Sinhalese defeated the Portuguese in many battles and freed the central regions from Portuguese influence. Portuguese only maintained control of the coastal regions and were convincingly defeated in more central kingdoms like Kandy and Seethawaka. The Portuguese rule, though only lasted for a century, left an influential legacy in the country, such as Portuguese naming of Sri Lankans, and the spread of Catholic Church in the country. Many modern Sri Lankan names can be traced from the Portuguese, and Catholics formed at least 7 to 10% of Sri Lankan population. =Modern relations= Owning the debt of such a long and historical tie, Sri Lanka and Portugal established relations following British departure from Ceylon. Portugal provided unofficial support to Sri Lanka in its war against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, though entirely non- lethal supports throughout the Sri Lankan Civil War. Since 2010s, Sri Lanka and Portugal have increased bilateral relations, as part of re-introduction of Portuguese heritages in Sri Lanka. Portugal condemned the brutal terrorist bombings of Easter Christians in Sri Lanka 2019, which a Portuguese citizen was among the dead.

She was the mother of Yan Wucheng. After the death of Hui Wenwang, she entered politics in her early thirties. History reveals two records of her actions in the period of her rule (which was one year). One record claimed that she was a dragon. In another record, she consulted the king, though the name of the king is unknown. Supposedly, Zhao Weihou died one year after she took office, and her son Xiao Cheng Wang began on the side of a democratic government.  Qin attack  In 266 BC, Zhao Huiwen died and Prince Edward took over as King Xiaocheng of Zhao. While Xiaocheng was young, national affairs were represented by Zhao Weihou. Zhao Weihou valued the people's livelihood and was sympathetic to them, increasing her prestige. At that time, although Zhao had the Lin Xiangru, Lianpo, and the plains supported the facade, the national strength was not as good as before. After Zhao Weihou took power, the Qin sent troops to attack Zhao. Zhao did not have the strength to confront the Qin State and had to ask for help from Qi. Qi wants Zhao Weihou‚Äôs son, Chang Anjun, as a hostage before he is willing to send troops. Zhao Weihou loved her son and refused to do so. Chu Long then convinced Zhao Weihou, and Changan Jun was sent to Qi as a hostage, and Qi sent troops to save Zhao.

Qiang et al. studied the tumour-bronchus relationship and described five types: *In ‚ÄúType 1‚Äù the bronchial lumen is patent up to the tumour. *In ‚ÄúType 2‚Äù the bronchus is contained in the tumor. These types are more common in malignant nodules. *A compressed and narrowed bronchus is defined as ‚ÄúType 3‚Äù, and can occur in both benign and malignant nodules. *Narrowing of the proximal bronchial tree is described as ‚Äútype 4‚Äù and is associated with malignancy. *‚ÄúType 5‚Äù is a bronchus compressed and flattened by the nodule with intact smooth wall. This type is mainly seen in benign nodules. Keeping in mind how a tumour with lepidic growth expands, it is not surprising that the air bronchogram in these tumours is smooth. In contradistinction, a desmoplastic response may cause irregularities of the bronchogram. When retraction of tumoural fibrosis occur, the air bronchogram can even become somewhat dilated. Although this sign can occur in all lung cancer cell types, it is more common in adenocarcinoma. Studies suggest the association of this sign with an activated Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation.

It is located on the east bank of the River Ouse at the point where the river enters the walled city from the north-west. The building was used as a waterworks from 1616 until 1846 after which it was converted into offices. It has since been turned into rental accommodation. History Barker Tower ‚Äì similar to the original design of Lendal Tower Lendal Tower was built in and was originally circular and similar in appearance to Barker Tower (also known as the North Street Postern Tower) but has since been remodelled giving it additional strength and height. Along with Barker Tower, on the opposite bank, it was built to control access to the city by way of an iron chain which was stretched across the river to impose the payment of tolls and from medieval times until the construction of Lendal Bridge in 1863 a ferry service crossed the river between the two towers. Lendal Tower is first recorded in the Custody of 1315 as (Tower of St Leonards). In 1569 bulwarks were added to the city defences as protection against the rebel Earls of Northumberland and Westmorland and repairs to the tower were undertaken in 1584‚Äì5. From 1616 the tower was being used as part of an effort to operate a piped water supply for the city. Historic England notes that the structure was heightened in 1616; engravings by William Lodge (1678) depict it as being of three storeys. They also show it to be in a state of disrepair, as was the case in 1646, which may have been caused during the Siege of York. The tower was now known as 'the waterhouse' and in 1677 a new scheme was proposed for its use. A lease of 500 years was granted for a peppercorn rent and permission was granted for improvements to be made. The building was enlarged and strengthened in 1682 to accommodate a lead cistern. Water was pumped in using either a windmill or a waterwheel but this proved problematic and within a few years it was replaced by a horse engine situated within the tower. The next major developments came in the 1750s with the installation of a Newcomen steam engine which was rebuilt to the designs of John Smeaton in the 1780s when further expansion to the building took place. Hot and cold baths were also built in a building adjoining the tower. The engine was moved to a nearby engine house in 1836 then following the establishment of the York New Waterworks Company in 1846 the waterworks were moved to Acomb Landing. The tower was reduced in height and remodelled by G.T. Andrews who gave the tower a more medieval appearance by adding the crenellations. It was retained by the waterworks company who converted it for use as their offices in 1932. It was designated as a Grade I listed building in 1954 and, as part of the city historic defences, is also protected as a scheduled monument. Since 2010 it has been refurbished for residential use before being marketed as rental accommodation. Architecture Lendal Tower was originally a circular building of in diameter, with a rounded turret to house a wooden spiral staircase, to which a 17th‚Äìcentury rectangular extension on the south-east of the structure has been added. The building is of Magnesian limestone some of which is thought to be from the nearby St Mary's Abbey which was dissolved in 1539 and later used as a source of stone for several buildings in the city. The tower has crenellated walls which were added in 1846 and a copper roof which has been converted into a roof terrace. The brickwork of the internal structure was used to support the 18th‚Äìcentury engines. A lift was installed as part of the refurbishment in 1932 at which time the Jacobean style decoration and panelling was also added.

History  Grain was jointly founded in 2013 by four co- founders - Yong Yi Sung, Ernest Sim, Gao Rifeng, and Isaac Tan - and initially launched as a personalized meal subscription service. The company touted itself as a healthy meal alternative for customers in the Singapore CBD and Orchard areas, with aiming to introduce ‚Äúhealthier, fuss free, and unique fares‚Äù to the food industry. In May 2014, it was relaunched as an on-demand service that allows customers to order for same-day delivery in Marina Bay. This initial model required customers to share their preferences and plot out their meals a week in advance; this proved difficult because their team of chefs were forced to create many different variations of dishes in a single day. The new on-demand service was designed to better meet customer needs by allowing them to order any number of items between a certain time frame. The order would then be delivered to the customer. As of 2016, delivery is available to any location in Singapore. Grain's current goal is to serve health- and taste-conscious food to time-pressed consumers. The menu, which rotates every quarter, is designed by in-house chefs, and the platform features shared meals for groups, as well as meal boxes and other items that include sides, desserts, and drinks. All food is prepared and packed inside Grain‚Äôs own facilities, then delivered by couriers on cars, bikes, bicycles or on foot. Users order food via the website or mobile application through a standard e-commerce platform process. Besides individual meals, the company also serves buffet catering for corporate events and parties. These dishes are also developed by their R&D; team and chefs.  Funding and Growth  In January 2016, Grain secured an estimated SG$2.45 million (US$1.70million) in a series A funding round led by Openspace Ventures (formerly NSI Ventures). Other initial investors included 500 Startups, Digital Media Partners, and Thai Express founder Ivan Lee. In December 2016, the company raised an undisclosed amount in pre-series B funding in another round also led by Openspace Ventures. This round included existing investors DMP and Ivan Lee while also gaining the support of Wee Teng Wen of the Lo & Behold Group. At the same time, Grain also raised an undisclosed amount in venture debt from DBS Bank In this same year, the four co-founders of Grain were featured in the 2016 edition of Forbes 30 under 30 In 2017, while planning for its next funding round, Grain stated explained that it had tripled its investment in technology, growing 330 per cent in sales as a result. These decisions improved gross profits by more than 10 per cent. In February 2018, Grain secured another undisclosed sum from investors that included Majuven, a venture capital fund founded by Lee Hsien Yang. Other new backers included FoodXervices and First Gourmet; previous investors Openspace, Ivan Lee and 500 Startups were also involved. In a Series B funding round led by Thailand's Singha Ventures, Grain raised US$10 million to improve existing infrastructure and expand to other Asian cities, beginning with Bangkok. Singha Ventures is the venture capital fund of Singha Corporation, a Thai conglomerate that produces the Singha beverage. The company's presence in the food and beverage (F&B;), packing and property sectors will be leveraged to support Grain's expansion in the country. Other investors participating in the round include Genesis Alternative Ventures, Sassoon Investment Corp, Ozi Amanat, K2 Global, FoodXervices and Majuven. According to a study conducted by The Straits Times and Statista, the 2019 funding round and business growth has made Grain fifth among Singapore‚Äôs fastest-growing companies.  Hygiene lapse  On 15 May 2017, Grain experienced a lapse in hygiene that caused 20 customers to become affected with gastroenteritis. After an internal investigation, the lapse was found to be caused by a reduction in simmer time for their Thai Green Curry dish, a change which resulted in the dish ‚Äúspoiling quicker than usual‚Äù. The NEA responded by adjusting Grain‚Äôs food hygiene from ‚ÄúA‚Äù to ‚ÄúC‚Äù. Yong Yi Sung, Grain‚Äôs CEO, released a statement of apology, explaining that when the issue was discovered, the dish was removed to avoid further harm. To rectify the issue, Grain worked closely with the NEA, the Ministry of Health, and the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore, and as of August 2019, it has regained the \\"A\\" grade for food hygiene.

Cycling career Lawless began cycling with the Dublin Wheelers cycling club in the 1950s, participating in road races and time trials. =National roles= Having held various club offices, he was nominated by the Dublin Wheelers and elected as General Secretary of the internationally recognised cycling federation, the CR√â, in 1960, at the young age of 22. He stepped down from two posts, General Secretary and International Secretary, in 1968, but continued as a member of the executive. The Dublin Wheelers were very active in national cycling governance in the 1960s and 1970s, with, in 1972, for example, Liam King as general secretary and Joe Doyle as treasurer, in addition to Donal O'Connell as road racing secretary, Paddy McInerney time trial secretary, and Lawless organiser of the Tour of Ireland, while Willie Marks also competed for a national committee general position.

International Day Against DRM (IDAD), sometimes called just Day Against DRM or anti-DRM day, is a grassroots international observance of protests against digital rights management (DRM) technology. The event is intended as \\"a counterpoint to the pro-DRM message broadcast by powerful media and software companies\\" and aims to draw attention to DRM's anti-consumer aspects.  Background  International Day Against DRM has been also described as a reaction against the lobbyist-dominated World Intellectual Property Day of the World Intellectual Property Organization, which promotes DRM. World Intellectual Property Day has been criticized by the activists from civil society organizations such as IP Justice and the Electronic Information for Libraries who consider it one-sided propaganda as the marketing materials associated with the event, provided by WIPO, \\"come across as unrepresentative of other views and events\\".Sandra Bangasser, 2009, Multilateral Institutions and the Recontextualization of Political Marketing: How the World Intellectual Property Organization‚Äôs Outreach Efforts Reflect Changing Audiences. Dissertiation. Michael Geist, a law professor at the University of Ottawa, noted that \\"World Intellectual Property Day has become little more than a lobbyist day\\".  Activism  This recurring event has been organized annually since 2006, and has been first introduced by the Defective by Design initiative. Various activities related to the event happen around the world, organized by anti-DRM grassroots activists and organizations. During the International Day Against DRM, there are discussions and promotions of DRM-free media and technology. Consumers are encouraged to switch to DRM- free alternatives. Companies that agree with the criticism of DRM have been known to offer discounts on products like DRM-free ebooks. In 2008 Defective by Design announced 35 consecutive Days Against DRM, each one warning the public against a different DRM-related product or service. This event has been endorsed by a number of civil society organizations such as the Free Software Foundation (creator of the Defective by Design initiative), Creative Commons, the Document Foundation, the Electronic Freedom Foundation, the Open Rights Group, Public Knowledge, and companies like O'Reilly Media, iFixIt and Packt.

Zamin is buried at the centre of the mausoleum. Architecture The tomb is built in the Lodhi architectural style. The mausoleum is square in shape and measures in both length and breadth. The roof is supported by twelve pillars and is surmounted by a sandstone dome with jalis on all the sides, except the west and south. The dome rises from an octagonal drum and is decorated with a marble panel above the chhajja (overhanging eaves or cover of a roof) along with a double row of crenelles. Marble is extensively used for the interior ornamentation and in the construction of the cenotaph. The western side of the mausoleum contains a marble-wrought mihrab (niche in the wall of a mosque that indicates the direction towards which the Muslims pray). The entrance, located at the southern side, is also made of marble. The entire sandstone structure was originally covered by polished stucco, a portion of which is still extant. The name of Zamin is written in the Naskh script over the doorway of the entrance.

It is located in Saint Mary Parish, Jamaica.https://jis.gov.jm/scotts-hall-maroons- looking-to-develop-area-as-major-attraction/ Retrieved 26 April 2019. Scott's Hall is one of the towns belonging to the Windward Maroons, which are situated along the Blue Mountains (Jamaica). While Moore Town is in the easternmost part of the mountain range, Charles Town, Jamaica is more centrally located. However, while Moore Town and Charles Town are situated in Portland Parish, Scott's Hall is on the westernmost edge of the range in St Mary. The only Leeward Maroon town in Jamaica is Accompong Town, located in the western Cockpit Country. p. 58. However, the Returned Maroons of Cudjoe's Town (Trelawny Town) now live just outside Maroon Town, Jamaica.http://maroonconnection.blogspot.com/p/brief-history-of-trelawny-town- maroons.html Retrieved 26 April 2019. History Originally, the largest Windward Maroon town was Crawford's Town, located high in the Blue Mountains. However, a leadership conflict between Quao and Edward Crawford in 1754 resulted in the destruction of Crawford's Town. Scott's Hall was established by supporters of Quao in 1749, and when a conflict five years later resulted in the destruction of Crawford's Town, more supporters of Quao were relocated to Scott's Hall. pp. 55-7.Bev Carey, The Maroon Story: The Authentic and Original History of the Maroons in the History of Jamaica 1490-1880 (Kingston, Jamaica: Agouti Press, 1997), pp. 416-8. However, upon the establishment of Scott's Hall, white superintendents assumed control of the Maroon town, and the Maroon officers reported to them. In 1760, while Cudjo and Davy the Maroon were the nominal Maroon leaders of Scott's Hall, they reported to the Moore Town superintendent, who marshalled the Maroon forces during Tacky's War. Davy, a legendary marksman, is credited with personally killing Tacky, and bringing an end to the main part of the revolt.Michael Craton, Testing the Chains (New York: Cornell University Press, 1982), p. 136. By the time Cudjo and Davy died, sometime before the mid-1790s, the superintendent did not see the need to appoint another Maroon officer, and instead ruled the smallest Maroon town directly. p. 73. In 1770, there were 42 Maroons living in Scott's Hall, and by 1797 the village's population had only increased marginally to 45. In 1808, the Maroon population of Scott's Hall was just 51, but by 1841 it had more than doubled to 105. pp. 108, 243. In 1781, the superintendent of Scott's Hall, Bernard Nalty, led a party of Windward Maroons that killed Three Fingered Jack (Jamaica), a notorious leader of a group of runaway slaves.Benjamin Moseley, A Treatise on Sugar (London: G.G. and J. Robinson, 1799), pp. 175-6. pp. 113-5. Because only a few Scott's Hall Maroons owned slaves, they did not follow the other two Windward Maroon towns in embracing the Anglican Church version of Christianity. Instead, the Maroons of Scott's Hall welcome Baptist missionaries into their village. Like Charles Town, a large number of residents in Scott's Hall were non-Maroons. pp. 227-8, 248-250.

The game was released on December 23, 2009, and revolves around players defending Paris, New York, and Tokyo from an assault of aliens. Gameplay The game is designed as a twin-stick shooter in its core, where the movement is done with the left stick and shooting with the right. There is a main goal in each level, which is to take down a certain number of boss aliens before a timer goes down to zero. However, the skies are also filled with smaller ships, and there are pods and snakes that burst from the ground. Aiding the fight against the enemies are power-ups like spray gun and flame throwers, as well as special abilities like nitro boost that helps moving the ship out of any harm. 0 Day Attack on Earth consists of 28 levels that are split in groups of seven that take place in four cities. Each city is accurately depicted through satellite imagery, containing landmarks like Champs-√âlys√©es, Tokyo Tower, and Arc de Triomphe. One of the features included is co-op play for up to four players (when playing offline, AI-controlled ships will support the player instead). Besides co-op, there are Capture the Flag and Capture Point multiplayer modes. Downloadable content On January 13, 2010, the London Map Pack was released. It contains new London-based maps, new enemies and a higher difficulty setting. New maps can be played in the co-op mode but not in the Capture The Flag or Control Point modes. On February 3, 2010, it was followed up by the Night Missions Map Pack, where the New York, Tokyo and Paris maps are revisited, and the enemy only comes out after sunset, while also being stronger and more difficult to defeat. Reception Upon its release, 0 Day Attack on Earth was met with \\"generally unfavourable\\" reviews from critics, with an aggregate score of 41% on Metacritic.

Amid widespread condemnation, President Maduro was sworn in on 10 January 2019, and the President of the National Assembly, Guaid√≥, was declared the interim President by that body on 23 January 2019. Intervention by the United States in Venezuela has been alleged by allies of Nicol√°s Maduro and political figures from the left spectrum; Maduro's government states that the crisis is a \\"coup d'√©tat led by the United States to topple him and control the country's oil reserves.\\" Guaid√≥ denies the coup allegations, saying peaceful volunteers back his movement.  Background  Presidents of Cuba, Bolivia and El Salvador greet Maduro at Maduro's second inauguration on 10 January 2019 Hugo Ch√°vez had alleged that there has been U.S. intervention in Venezuela during his presidency. In early 2015, the Maduro government accused the United States of attempting to overthrow him. The Venezuelan government performed elaborate actions to respond to such alleged attempts and to convince the public that its claims were true. The reactions included the arrest of Antonio Ledezma in February 2015, forcing American tourists to go through travel requirements and holding military marches and public exercises \\"for the first time in Venezuela's democratic history\\". After the United States ordered sanctions to be placed on seven Venezuelan officials for human rights violations, Maduro used anti-U.S. rhetoric to bump up his approval ratings. However, according to Venezuelan political scientist Isabella Pic√≥n, only about 15% of Venezuelans believed in the alleged coup attempt accusations at the time. In 2016, Maduro again claimed that the United States was attempting to assist the opposition with a coup attempt. On 12 January 2016, Secretary General of the Organization of American States (OAS), Luis Almagro, threatened to invoke the Inter- American Democratic Charter, an instrument used to defend democracy in the Americas when threatened, when opposition National Assembly member were barred from taking their seats by the Maduro-aligned Supreme Court. Human rights organizations such as Human Rights Watch, and the Human Rights Foundation called for the OAS to invoke the Democratic Charter. After more controversies and pursuing a recall on Maduro, on 2 May 2016, opposition members of the National Assembly met with OAS officials to ask for the body to implement the Democratic Charter. Two days later on 4 May, the Maduro government called for a meeting the next day with the OAS, with Venezuelan Foreign Minister Delcy Rodr√≠guez stating that the United States and the OAS were attempting to overthrow Maduro. On 17 May 2016 in a national speech, Maduro called OAS Secretary General Luis Almagro \\"a traitor\\" and stated that he worked for the CIA. Almagro sent a letter rebuking Maduro, and refuting the claim. The Trump administration described Maduro's government as a \\"dictatorship\\". When meeting with Latin American leaders during the seventy-second session of the UN General Assembly, President Donald Trump discussed possible United States military intervention in Venezuela, to which they all denied the offer. President Maduro's son, Nicol√°s Maduro Guerra, stated during the 5th Constituent Assembly of Venezuela session that if the United States were to attack Venezuela, \\"the rifles would arrive in New York, Mr. Trump, we would arrive and take the White House\\".  Military involvement  On 18 February, President Donald Trump advised Venezuelan soldiers to renounce loyalty to Nicol√°s Maduro. In early 2019, with Cuban and Russian-backed security forces in the country, United States military involvement became the subject of speculation. Senior U.S. officials have declared that \\"all options are on the table\\", but have also said that \\"our objective is a peaceful transfer of power\\". Maduro announced that state funds would be used to purchase new military equipment, saying \\"we are going to make enough investment so that Venezuela has all the anti-aircraft and anti-missile defense systems ... even the most modern in the world, Venezuela will have them because Venezuela wants peace\\". Colombian guerrillas from National Liberation Army (ELN) have also vowed to defend Maduro, with ELN leaders in Cuba stating that they are drafting plans to provide military assistance to Maduro. The Redes Foundation denounced in the Colombian Public Ministry that armed groups made up of ELN members and FARC dissidents, supported by the Bolivarian National Police and FAES officials, murdered two Venezuelans, Eduardo Jos√© Marrero and Luigi √Ångel Guerrero, during a protest in the frontier city of San Crist√≥bal, on T√°chira state. Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue think tank, stated that \\"military action of the United States against Venezuela would be contrary to the movements of the Trump administration to retire troops from Syria or Afghanistan.\\" According to professor Erick Langer of Georgetown University, \\"Cuba and Russia have already intervened\\". According to the Cuban government, more than 20,000 Cubans are working in Venezuela, the exact number of Cuban military operatives in Venezuela is unclear. According to a 2014 Brookings Institution report, there were hundreds to thousands of Cuban intelligence operatives and military advisors in Venezuela, with similar numbers reported in 2019. US National Security Advisor John R. Bolton claimed that the \\"fear of the 20,000 to 25,000 Cuban security forces in the country\\" prevented the success of the 2019 Venezuelan uprising. Cuba director of US affairs Carlos Fern√°ndez de Coss√≠o disputes Bolton's claim, insisting that Cuba does not participate neither in military nor in security affairs in Venezuela, \\"[o]nly medical staff in humanitarian mission‚Äù according to Cuba Foreign Affairs Ministry. Defected Venezuelan Lieutenant Jos√© Montiel L√≥pez in the US said in an interview with The Washington Post that Cuban military disguised as civilians acted as \\"our supervisors and decision-makers‚Äù. According to sixteen Cuban doctors interviewed by The New York Times, Cuban medical staff in Venezuela has also been involved in manipulation and withholding of medicines to coerce patients to support Maduro during elections. During the uprising, Trump threatened a \\"full and complete embargo, together with highest-level sanctions\\" on Cuba if its troops do not cease operations in Venezuela. In April 2019, private Iranian airline Mahan Air launched direct flights from Tehran to Caracas. The company is accused of transporting military equipment to Middle East war zones. The airline was blacklisted by the United States in 2011 for providing support to Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)‚Äìdesignated as a terrorist organization by the governments of Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the United States (in 2019).. The governments of France and Germany banned Mahan Air in early 2019 for similar reasons. According to Fox News, the launch of Tehran-Caracas flight \\"has signified a growing relationship between the two nations\\". Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, suggested that Iran could send IRGC personnel to Venezuela to protect President Maduro. The offer was condemned by OAS Secretary General Luis Almagro. According to the Newsweek, \\"The presence of Russian, Chinese and Iranian planes in Caracas has outraged the U.S., which already has troops based in neighboring Colombia and in other countries across a region long targeted by Washington's efforts to halt the spread of leftist ideologies.\\" According to Giancarlo Fiorella, writing in Foreign Affairs, the \\"loudest calls for intervention are coming not from the White House and its media mouthpieces but from some members of the Venezuelan opposition and from residents of the country desperate for a solution‚Äîany solution‚Äîto their years- long plight.\\" Fiorella states that \\"talk of invoking article 187(11) has become commonplace\\" in Venezuela, adding that \\"the push for a military intervention in Venezuela is most intense not among hawks in Washington but inside the country itself\\". Article 187 of the Constitution of Venezuela provides: \\"It shall be the function of the National Assembly: (11) To authorize the operation of Venezuelan military missions abroad or foreign military missions within the country.\\" Also here. In every demonstration summoned by Guaid√≥, there are numerous signs demanding the application of Article 187. Following the unsuccessful attempt to bring humanitarian aid into Venezuela on 23 February, a political faction supported by National Assembly deputy Mar√≠a Corina Machado began to demand application of Article 187, to \\"open the way\\" for \\"foreign intervention in order to prevent crimes against humanity\\". Former mayor of Caracas, Antonio Ledezma has also called for application of 187, and the calls for intervention have taken hold outside of the political realm, with a March poll showing 87.5% support for foreign intervention. Guaid√≥ has said he will call for intervention \\"when the time comes\\", but in media interviews, he has not stated he supports removing Maduro by force. Maduro with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in Tehran, Iran (2015) The National Assembly approved in July 2019 the reincorporation of Venezuela to the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (Tratado Interamericano de Asistencia Rec√≠proca). Known as the Rio Pact or Rio Treaty, and by its Spanish-language acronym, TIAR is a mutual defense pact signed in 1947 that has never been enacted. Its premise is that \\"an armed attack by any State against an American State shall be considered an attack against all American States\\". Venezuela retired from TIAR in 2013; Deputy Francisco Sucre stated that Ch√°vez had removed Venezuela from the pact in a \\"strategy to isolate Venezuela by a totalitarian system mirroring [Cuba]\\". Venezuela's reincorporation to the pact \\"can be used to request military assistance against foreign troops inside the country\\". In December 2019, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stated that the United States did not plan a military intervention in Venezuela, saying that \\"we have said that all options are on the table\\", but that \\"we have learned from history that the risks from using military force are significant\\".  Russian presence  = 2018 = Russian president Putin meeting with Maduro in Brazil (2014) Reuters reported that Russian mercenaries associated with the Wagner Group were in Venezuela to defend Maduro's government. Professor Robert Ellis of the United States Army War College described 400 Wagner Group mercenaries provided by Russia as the \\"palace guard of Nicol√°s Maduro\\". Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied the deployment of Russian mercenaries, calling it \\"fake news\\". Two nuclear weapon- capable Russian planes landed in Venezuela in December 2018 in what Reuters called a \\"show of support for Maduro's socialist government\\". = 2019 = On 3 March 2019, Russian Federation Council speaker Valentina Matviyenko told Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodr√≠guez that Russia will make every effort to prevent military intervention in Venezuela and believes that the crisis was artificially created by the US, which can be solved only through dialogue. On 23 March 2019, two Russian planes landed in Venezuela carrying 99 troops and 35 tonnes of mat√©riel. Alexey Seredin from the Russian Embassy in Caracas said the two planes were \\"part of an effort to maintain Maduro's defense apparatus, which includes Sukhoi fighter jets and anti-aircraft systems purchased from Russia\\". On 29 March, a flight simulation center for Russian helicopters was launched in Venezuela, and another flight simulator center is planned, as is a plant to produce Russian arms. Russia supplies arms, special forces, and military advisors to Venezuela, and a base for cyber warfare is under construction on a Venezuelan island. Diosdado Cabello said the arrival of the planes was approved and authorized by Maduro. Russian Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Maria Zakharova also confirmed the presence of military personnel in Venezuela, arguing that the countries had a bilateral agreement on military cooperation signed by Presidents Putin and Ch√°vez in May 2001. Seredin said Russian investments in Venezuelan mining, agriculture and transportation is also contemplated. Vladimir Zaemsky, Russia's ambassador to Venezuela said that the Russian military are helping their Venezuelan counterparts to defend themselves in the face of the \\"threat of the use of force\\" by the United States. Ambassador Zaemsky also said that the Venezuelan military needs to make sure that the weapons they have are in a functioning state while maintaining combat readiness of their equipment and teach them how best to use it. National Assembly deputy Williams D√°vila said the National Assembly would investigate the \\"penetration of foreign forces in Venezuela\\", since Venezuela's Constitution requires that the legislature authorize foreign military missions and the arrival of Russian military was a \\"violation of Venezuelan sovereignty\\". Guaid√≥ declared that foreign soldiers have been \\"imported\\" because Maduro's government does not trust the Venezuelan Armed Forces. US Secretary of State Pompeo accused Russia of \\"reckless escalation\\" of the situation in Venezuela, and warned Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov that the US would \\"not stand idly by\\", but did not say what the US response to Russian troops in Venezuela would be. Lavrov responded by accusing the Trump administration of organizing a coup in Venezuela. A United States Southern Command spokesperson said Russia's deployment of troops \\"directly undercuts the democratic aspirations of the Venezuelan people\\"; the OAS called it \\"a harmful act to Venezuelan sovereignty\\". In late March, US National Security Advisor Bolton said the US considered Russia's involvement a \\"direct threat to international peace and security in the region\\". In April 2019, Malta refused to allow Russian planes to use its airspace to supply Maduro's government. Morgan Ortagus, spokeswoman of the United States State Department, applauded the decision; weeks earlier, the US raised concerns when Russian planes from Syria crossed Malta's airspace to transport soldiers and mat√©riel to Venezuela. Russia described Malta's actions as \\"unfriendly\\" and warns that it will take this into account in bilateral relations between the two countries. According to Agence France-Presse, Sergey Lavrov the foreign minister of Russia said to American foreign minister that: we condemn obvious interference of America in Venezuela; he also emphasized that the future of this country should be determined based on its people decision. Mutually, the United States says that Russian action(s) in Caracas is unprofitable, and severely criticized for sending Russian troops to Venezuela. An article of The Wall Street Journal reported that Russia state defense contractor reduced Rostec staff in Venezuela in June due to \\"the acceptance that Mr. Maduro‚Äôs regime no longer has the cash to continue to pay for other Rostec services associated with past contracts\\". According to undisclosed sources, the number of Russian operatives would have been reduced to \\"just a few dozen from about 1,000 at the height of cooperation between Moscow and Caracas several years ago\\". Donald Trump announced in Twitter: \\"Russia has informed us that they have removed most of their people from Venezuela\\". Rostec reported that the numbers published by the newspaper were exaggerated and Russian spokesman Dmitry Peskov, expressed to the press that he had not been in touch with Trump: \\"it‚Äôs a circumstantial reference to newspaper sources of information, because there was no official message about this from the Russian side\\". According to news agency RIA, Russia foreign ministry expressed some days later that their country was ready to send more military specialist if needed, another Russian press, TASS, quoted the ministry saying that Russia did not rule out increasing the number of military in Venezuela. On 26 June, Russia announced the withdrawal of its military technicians, operating in Venezuela since March. According to the Russian embassy in Caracas, \\"Russia delivered to Venezuela high-level equipment that requires regular maintenance. Furthermore, Russian specialists provided technical training to Venezuelan staff. Unlike reported, it was not a Russian military presence but the fulfillment of maintenance contracts\\". In September, two Russian planes said to be carrying technical specialists arrived in Venezuela. On 10 December, a group of around forty Russian soldiers arrived to Canaima, Bol√≠var, on a Shaanxi Y-8 plane landing on the runway that serves as the entry to the National Park. Locals assured that the soldiers wore uniforms of the Venezuelan Armed Forces and that they carried crates with microwave equipment, satellite antennas, signal inhibitors, and other devices. = 2020 = Russia welcomed Luis Parra's appointment during the 2020 Venezuelan National Assembly Delegated Committee election. The Russian Foreign Ministry said that the appointment contributes to the return of the intra-Venezuelan political struggle to the constitutional field that will find a peaceful exit to the ongoing crisis. Opposition deputies denounced that Russia looked after supporting Parra to improve its businesses in Venezuela, including to increase the Russian shareholder participation in oil contracts and other mining concessions that need the approval of the National Assembly and that it would not have with Guaid√≥. Venezuelan media reported on 7 May, after the Macuto Bay raid, that Russian Special Operations Forces were assisting Maduro with surveillance from unmanned aerial vehicles.  Sanctions  During the crisis in Venezuela, the United States, the European Union, Canada, Mexico, Panama and Switzerland have applied individual sanctions against people associated with Maduro's administration, including government officials, members of the military and security forces, and private individuals alleged to be involved in human rights abuses, corruption, degradation in the rule of law and repression of democracy. Public Radio International (PRI) said the sanctions targeted Maduro and Chavismo \\"elites\\", while \\"they've done little to make an impact on ordinary Venezuelans, whose lives have spiraled into a humanitarian crisis as hyperinflation has driven nearly 3 million to flee.\\" As of 27 March 2018, the Washington Office on Latin America said 78 Venezuelans associated with Maduro had been sanctioned by several countries. In 2018, Trump signed an order that prohibits people in the U.S. from making any type of transaction with digital currency emitted by or in the name of the government of Venezuela as of 9 January 2018. The executive order referenced \\"Petro\\", a crypto-currency also known as petromoneda. As the humanitarian crisis deepened and expanded, the Trump administration levied more serious economic sanctions against Venezuela, and \\"Maduro accused the US of plunging Venezuelan citizens further into economic crisis.\\" In January 2019, during the presidential crisis, the United States imposed sanctions on the Venezuelan state-owned oil and natural gas company PDVSA to pressure Maduro to resign. Reuters said the sanctions are expected to reduce Venezuela's ability to purchase food and other imports which could result in further shortages and worsen its economic position. PRI said that \\"sanctions against PDVSA are likely to yield stronger and more direct economic consequences\\". Companies including India's Reliance Industries Limited, Russia's Rosneft, Spain's Repsol, and commodity trading companies Trafigura and Vitol continue to supply Venezuela's oil industry as of 11 April 2019. United States' Special Representative for Venezuela Elliott Abrams with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in January 2019 The United States Department of the Treasury placed sanctions affecting Venezuela's gold industry in March 2019, explaining that Maduro's government \\"is pillaging the wealth of Venezuela while imperiling indigenous people by encroaching on protected areas and causing deforestation and habitat loss\\". After the detention of Guaid√≥'s chief of staff, Roberto Marrero, in March 2019, the US also sanctioned the Venezuelan bank BANDES and its subsidiaries. The Maduro administration issued a statement saying that it \\"energetically rejects the unilateral, coercive, arbitrary and illegal measures\\" that would affect banking for millions of people. Venezuela accused Canada of supporting Trump's 'war adventure' after Canada imposed new sanctions on 43 members of the Maduro government in April, including foreign minister Jorge Arreaza.

Portale di Storia Contemporanea [Istituti per la Storia della Resistenza e dell'et√† contemporanea], 201 After they were trapped in Fiesole, the soldiers went into hiding in ruins of the local Roman theater. On August 12, after the Germans discovered the empty Carabinieri barracks, the commanding officer threatened to kill ten civilians previously taken hostage. Having been notified of this, the four Carabinieri decided to turn themselves in. Naclerio was forced to return to service, the other three soldiers brutally interrogated before they were shot to death at the Hotel Aurora. In 1946, the three Carabinieri were awarded the Gold Medal of Honor for Military Service. For the 70th anniversary of their sacrifice, in 2014, a fictionalized account of the story was the subject of a movie made for Italian television: A testa alta - I martiri di Fiesole. Monument in Fiesole The Monument to Three Carabinieri is a bronze monument in Fiesole, Italy, commemorating the sacrifice of the three Carabinieri. In 1964, the city of Fiesole decided to honor the memory of the three Carabinieri by commissioning a major monument. Living in Fiesole at the time was Giovanni Michelucci, one of the most important Italian architects of the twentieth century. He was given the responsibility of adapting the Park of Remembrance (Parco della Rimembranza) to be able to host the new monument. Originally built in the 1920s to honor local soldiers who died in World War I, the park was expanded by Michelucci with a new terrace, complete with beautiful views of Florence and the Arno valley. Michelucci also organized a competition for the monument commission, in which four Tuscan artists were invited to submit project proposals: Vitaliano De Angelis, Marcello Guasti, Mino Trafeli, and Iorio Vivarelli. Guasti, a Florentine engraver, painter and sculptor born in 1924, was awarded the opportunity to design a large bronze sculpture, measuring over four meters high. The artist faced two main problems while designing this work; on one hand, he needed to find a way to honor the Three Carabinieri, reminding viewers of their heroism, and on the other, he needed to work in harmony with Michelucci, creating a work with relation to its physical location in the Park. Guasti‚Äôs solution involved creating a statue with an aggressively dynamic shape, one that allows a multitude of interpretations. From a pincer emerge tangled tongues of fire, alluding to the symbol of the Carabinieri: a flame. Not only does the monument commemorate a vigorous fight for life, but it also materializes the ongoing pursuit and triumph of liberty.

The forest consists mostly of oak and pine. It is one of the most important areas in Europe for birds of prey, and the only forest in Europe where all four European species of vulture can be seen. It is a fully managed protected area of and is visited by about 35,000 people each year. Geography The forest is located in northeastern Greece, to the northeast of Alexandroupoli close to the border with Turkey, where the eastern end of the Rhodope Mountains are largely uninhabited and unspoiled. The area is one of tree-covered rolling hills, the Evros Hills, reaching up to about but without any high peaks. The protected area covers an area of and is surrounded by a buffer zone of about . The underlying rocks are igneous, some being alkaline and others acidic. Most of the area is forested, but there is some scrubland, grassland and cultivated areas. The trees are mostly oaks and pines, with some areas of primary forest and other areas of secondary, regenerated growth. Flora Iris pumila The dominant trees in Dadia Forest are Turkish pine, black pine, and three species of oak. Growing among these are cornelian cherry, smoke bush, eastern hornbeam, hop hornbeam, wild service tree and turpentine tree. Herbaceous plants, herbs and bulbous plants include paeonies, various orchids, dwarf iris, Iris reichenbachii, Fritillaria pontica, wild tulips, Crocus pulchellus and Colchicum. Fauna About 36 species of mammal have been recorded in the protected area as well as 40 species of reptile and amphibian, but it is as a bird reserve that the forest is best known. 36 of the 38 diurnal species of European birds of prey are present, as well as 6 nocturnal species (owls). All four native European species of vulture, the black, bearded, Egyptian and griffon vultures are found here; Dadia is the only forest in Europe where this happens. Eagles are plentiful, with several pairs of golden eagle nesting in the protected area. Smaller raptors include lanner falcon, levant sparrowhawk and horned owl. Both black and white storks breed here, and among the smaller birds are semicollared flycatcher, roller, masked shrike and eastern Bonelli's warbler. Altogether, 219 species of bird have been recorded. Visitor information The forest is a fully managed protected area and is visited by about 35,000 visitors each year. These bring economic benefits to the village of Dadia and to the wider area. Other facilities include an Ecotourism Centre, an information centre, and a coffee shop and restaurant. Cars are not permitted, but minibus ecotours are organised, and visitors can follow the trails on foot. There is a hostel near Dadia and various tracks through the forest. Carcases are put out each day to help feed the vultures and other raptors and provide a spectacle for visitors, who can watch from a hide some away.

In 1875, she became the first woman to qualify as a Pharmaceutical Chemist, and was one of the first two women members (with Rose Minshull) of the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, admitted in 1879. In 1905, she became the first President of the National Association of Women Pharmacists (then the Association of Women Pharmacists).  Early life and education  Isabella Skinner Clarke was born on 29 October 1842 on 27 Skinner Street, London. It is not recorded whether her middle name was inspired by her parents‚Äô address. Her father, Edward Clarke (born c.1805), was a clerk at the time of her birth, but recorded as a solicitor in the 1861 census. Her mother was Elizabeth Clarke (n√©e Pemberton) (born c.1808). ‚ÄúBella‚Äù, as she was known, was their third child of seven, with older sisters Elizabeth (born c.1836), Ellen Victoria (born c.1839), and younger sisters Alice Jane (born c.1845), Janet Pemberton (born c.1849), Martha Elizabeth (born c.1850) and Fanny Rebecca (born c. 1854). Annie Neve, who later served her apprenticeship with Isabella, described ‚Äúa large family of happy, busy women.‚Äù Clarke passed the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain Preliminary Examination in 1874, coming 23rd out of 355 candidates, 186 of whom failed. She gained the required three years‚Äô experience partly through time spent with Elizabeth Garrett (later Anderson) (1836‚Äì1917) at her St Mary's Dispensary for Women and Children, and partly with Robert Hampson (1833‚Äì1905), PSGB Council member and champion of women‚Äôs rights. Historian Ellen Jordan has shown that both Garrett Anderson and Hampson were engaged with the Society for the Promotion of Employment for Women who had identified dispensing and pharmacy as a career into which women could be supported to enter. Clarke registered with the Pharmaceutical Society as a Chemist & Druggist on 22 April 1875. She became a Pharmaceutical Chemist by passing the higher level Major exam on 15 December 1875, the first woman to achieve this. She came fourth out of 39 candidates, 16 of whom failed.  Professional life  She established her own business in 1876 at Spring Street, Paddington, London. She took on a number of apprentices including Annie Neve (who was known in household as \\"Little Arsenic\\") and Lucy Boole. In the 1870s, Clarke took female medical students for their dispensing course at her pharmacy, and was appointed as tutor in pharmacy at the London School of Medicine for Women. By 1892, new facilities at the medical school included a materia medica museum used ‚Äúfor Mrs Clarke Keer‚Äôs practical pharmacy class.‚Äù On 15 January 1883, she married Thomas Henry Keer (?1852-1898) in Kensington. They had met when they were both students at Dr Muter‚Äôs School of Pharmacy in Kennington, passing the Pharmaceutical Society Major exam on the same day as each other, with consecutive numbered certificates. After her marriage, she moved out from living with her widowed mother, dispenser sister Alice and artist sister Martha, and into 5 Endsleigh Street, Tavistock Square. She gave up her Spring Street business and became her husband‚Äôs partner in a pharmacy at 9 Bruton Street, Berkley Square. In spite of her professional achievements, she and other women employees such as Margaret Buchanan were not permitted to work visibly in the shop. Buchanan recalled that \\"the presence of a women would have been very detrimental to a pharmacist‚Äôs business in those days, and more particularly to the class of business which Mr Keer conducted.\\" She suffered a ‚Äúcrushing bereavement‚Äù when Thomas died, aged 46, on 14 January 1898. After his death, she began to take in boarders, later described as a Home for Students, and also ran a shorthand and typing business in Victoria Street. = Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain = After years of drawn-out debate over women‚Äôs place within the Pharmaceutical Society during the 1870s, its Council elected Clarke-Keer as one of its first two women members (with Rose Minshull) on 1 October 1879. Clarke-Keer had first applied for membership in October 1877, her application defeated 8 votes to 4 in the Council. At the June 1878 meeting, the vote was drawn 8 on each side, but the President gave his casting vote against women joining the membership. At the Annual General Meeting in 1879, the result was first declared as 66 votes in favour of women becoming members and 65 against, but after a challenge, the vote was re-taken and the result was 78 in favour and 81 against. Finally at the Council meeting on 1 October 1879, Miss Clarke and Miss Rose Minshull were elected members, with only one vote in opposition. In spite of Robert Hampson‚Äôs campaign, the conclusion was apparently reached by some Council members \\"to avoid further agitation\\", rather than through a comprehensive belief in equal rights. = Association of Women Pharmacists = On Thursday 15 June 1905, a group of women pharmacists met at 5 Endsleigh Street. Their aim was to establish an Association of Women Pharmacists. The group‚Äôs objectives would be to discuss questions relating to women‚Äôs employment, establish registers of locums and of all qualified women, and the \\"furtherance of social intercourse\\". Fifty women joined immediately. Clarke-Keer was persuaded ‚Äúwith some difficulty‚Äù to be the Association‚Äôs first President, and went on to hold the position for two years. Many Association meetings were held in her dining room. During the First World War, in her mid-70s, she did clerical work at the Admiralty.  Death and legacy  She died in her sleep on 30 July 1926 at 123 Waddon Park Avenue, Croydon, aged 84. The cause of death was recorded as mitral disease of the heart and anasarca. She was buried at Brookwood Cemetery, Surrey. In tributes after her death, Margaret Buchanan, her employee and her successor as President of the Association of Women Pharmacists explained that ‚Äúher indomitable energy and savoir-faire carried her through many an awkward situation, which she in after years would describe with great glee.‚Äù Annie Neve, who served her apprenticeship with Clarke-Keer, was equally appreciative of her mentor: ‚ÄúThe initiative, energy, moral courage, and enthusiasm for the advancement of pharmacy and for the betterment of the lot of all who toil and suffer, which she so conspicuously displayed during a long and beneficent life were a heartening and ennobling example to all who came within the sphere of her influence.‚Äù In 2019 she was added to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.
