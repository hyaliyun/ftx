Strock, and starring James Mitchum and John Carradine. Strock later claimed he co-directed the film uncredited http://www.moriareviews.com/horror/monster-1979.htm. It was originally to be titled Monster when the film was first announced in 1975, and again in 1977, and suffered numerous cast changes (Keenan Wynn was still billed on some of the early video releases). The film was eventually released in 1980 as Monstroid, and is also known as Monstroid: It Came from the Lake (American DVD box title) and The Toxic Horror (American alternative title). A novelization written by Peter Crowcroft was released concurrently with the film. Hartford had his own children (Glen and Andrea) play the two teenagers in the film.http://www.moriareviews.com/horror/monster-1979.htm The film billed itself as being based on a true story that took place in \\"Chimayo, Colombia\\" in 1971.video credits. However, the film was actually shot in Chimayo, New Mexico and Ambalema, Colombia. Some of the film was actually shot in the Santuario de Chimayo, with John Carradine playing a priest.  Plot  One night in the fishing village of Chimayo, Colombia, Mar√≠a Reyes witnesses a monster devouring her husband Jos√©. Some years later, the American cement manufacturer Durado Cement dispatches troubleshooter Bill Travis (James Mitchum) to Chimayo to restore order to their manufacturing plant there: an anti-corporate activist named V√≠ctor S√°nchez has been exploiting the villagers' fear of the monster to stir up hostility against Durado, which has been polluting their fishing waters in Lake Chimayo. In the process, Mar√≠a has become ostracized from the villagers: a group led by a man named Carlos calls her \\"la bruja\\" (\\"the witch\\"). In addition, Travis must silence an American TV reporter named Patty Clark who has been exposing the pollution of the lake. In Chimayo, children Andrea and Glen Anderson observe strange ripples in the lake. Glen claims they belong to an animal he has been sighting in the lake for some time. Their father Pete (Anthony Eisley), administrator of the Durado plant, is introduced to Mayor Montero and his daughter, helicopter pilot Juanita. S√°nchez meets up with Carlos in a church, and together they plot to drive out the Americans and the monster he thinks was created by the pollution of the lake. When Mar√≠a goes to visit Jos√©'s grave, Carlos's men attack her. Juanita picks up Travis at the airport. When he gets to Chimayo, he is accosted by Clark, and curtly refuses any interviews. Meanwhile, Pete is trying to break up with his secretary Laura to pursue a new affair with Juanita, but can't bring himself to do it. He visits her again that night when she is skinny dipping in the lake, and successfully breaks up, but the monster emerges from the lake and kills Laura after he leaves. The town is busy celebrating its 200th anniversary and the body goes undiscovered until the next morning. Travis and the plant doctor investigate the killing and link it to Jos√©'s death. Glen tells Travis about the animal he saw, convincing Travis that there is something in the lake. Soon afterwards, S√°nchez meets Travis and threatens violence against Durado. Travis and Montero confront Clark about her reporting, and they negotiate exclusive rights to the pollution story in exchange for her temporary silence. Travis also calls his boss Barnes (Philip Carey) to request sonar equipment with which to track the monster. Determined to prove the monster's existence, Glen decides to stake out the lake at night. He drags Andrea along, and they manage to take some photos of the monster before it attacks some drunken fishermen. They present their evidence to Travis while the village continues celebrating their anniversary. Simultaneously, S√°nchez sets some plastic explosives to blow up the plant. However, he gets trapped after lighting the fuse. Meanwhile, a party of men chases Mar√≠a, whom they blame for all their troubles. The town priest (John Carradine) claims that he can exorcise her, but the men are unconvinced and burn her at the stake. S√°nchez's bomb goes off, and the next day Travis reveals that the plant has been badly damaged and Mar√≠a severely burned. Consequently, she is airlifted to a Panamanian hospital in Chimayo's only helicopter to get treatment. Travis comes up with a plan to kill the beast: he stuffs some explosives into a goat carcass, which he will hang by the detonator cord from a helicopter. In order to obtain a new chopper, Juanita lures some rescue workers with a fake mayday and hijacks their craft at gunpoint. They get to the lake and the Nessie-like monster takes the bait, but Travis loses the detonator and dives in after it. A local policeman distracts the monster by circling it with his boat, and thus buys Travis enough time to retrieve the detonator and blow the creature to pieces. However, some time later the Andersons are down by the lake again, and their German Shepherd finds a large egg. A reptilian creature hatches out of it, and the film ends as the camera pans over a clutch of dozens of similar eggs.

Joseph A. Ziemba from Bleeding Skull! panned the film, calling it \\"a mess\\", criticizing the film as being endlessly talkative. Ziemba also criticized the film's acting, \\"cut ‚Äòn‚Äô paste exploitation plot\\", phony monster design, and poor video quality. Octavio Ramos from Axs.com gave the film a negative review, writing, \\"Monstroid: It Came from the Lake is perhaps only of interest to residents of Northern New Mexico or anyone interested in the Santuario de Chimayo. There are actual filmed scenes of the interior of the Santuario with John Carradine, which is worth gold to some viewers. Otherwise, don‚Äôt bother with this movie. It is in all ways a disappointment.\\" References  External links   1980 films 1980 horror films 1980s monster movies 1980s science fiction horror films American films American monster movies American science fiction horror films English- language films Giant monster films ","title":"Monster (1980 film)"},{"id":"36552575","text":"is a Japanese professional baseball outfielder for the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks in Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball.

The Consortium is located at the Washington State Capital Museum and Outreach Center in Olympia.  Organizational background  The Washington Women's History Consortium was established in 2005, by the Washington State Legislation (RCW 27.34.360). The initial goal of the Consortium was to collect historical documentation about the contributions and achievements that Washington women have made, in preparation for a 2010 celebration honoring the Centennial of Women's Suffrage in the state. The centennial celebration was held on November 8, 2010 and was known statewide as the \\"Day of Jubilation\\". The celebration included music and theatrical performances, speeches, and a court re-enactment. In 2006, the Consortium created a comprehensive Web site that provides access to digital images and documents that have been contributed by legislatively mandated partners throughout the state. These partners receive financial support from the Consortium to collaborate and assist in the collection and preservation of historical information that is used in the online Women's History Consortium Collection. Associate partners are currently digitizing collections of historical materials for their organizations, using the Consortium's proprietary software. , statewide legislatively mandated partners include the Washington State Library and Archives (operated by the Secretary of State), Western Washington University, the University of Washington, the Evergreen State College, Central Washington University, Eastern Washington University, Washington State University, and the Northwest Museum of Arts & Culture in Spokane.

Early life Francis Lane Fox was the son of Claude Ward Jackson (1869‚Äì1937) and Una Whiting (n√©e Wilcox). He was educated at Eton College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He was commissioned into the Royal Horse Guards on 16 July 1919.Lane Fox of Bramham Park, Burke's Landed Gentry (1965 edn).Army List. After service as a young officer of the Household Cavalry, 'Joe' Ward-Jackson (as he was then known) was appointed aide-de-camp to the Viceroy of India, Lord Irwin, in 1928.India List, 1929, 1930. He met Lord Irwin's niece, Marcia Agnes Mary Lane Fox (1904‚Äì1980), eldest daughter and heiress of Lt-Col George Lane Fox (soon to be created Lord Bingley) when she visited India. They were married on 3 October 1929 and in 1937 Jackson changed his surname by deed poll to Lane Fox. In 1947 he was granted the Royal licence to bear the coat of arms of Fox. War service Lane Fox was promoted to lieutenant-colonel on 26 June 1941, and took command of the Household Cavalry Training Regiment. On 20 September 1943 he assumed command of the 43rd (Wessex) Reconnaissance Regiment (43 Recce). The regiment, part of the Reconnaissance Corps, formed part of the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division, whose General Officer Commanding (GOC) was Major-General Ivor Thomas, which was training for the Normandy Landings.43 Recce Regiment War Diary, January‚ÄìAugust 1944, The National Archives, Kew, file WO 171/491. =The wreck of the Derrycunihy= Soon after D-Day, 43 Recce embarked on a transport named the , which arrived off Sword Beach on the evening of 20 June. High seas and enemy shelling prevented unloading for three days and it was decided to move to Juno Beach for disembarkation. As the ship started engines on the morning of 24 June it detonated a mine dropped by a Luftwaffe raider. The mine explosion split the ship in two, and the after part, packed with soldiers, sank rapidly. Worse still, an ammunition lorry caught fire, and oil floating on the water was set alight. Landing craft and gunboats quickly came alongside and picked up survivors. The Regimental War Diary records that 'Great gallantry was displayed by all troops in the two aft holds'. Over 180 men of the regiment and 25 ships' crew and gunners were lost, and about 120 wounded of 43 Recce were evacuated. The disaster represented the biggest single loss of life off the invasion beaches.Ellis Vol I, p. 275.McKee pp. 149‚Äì152.Essame, pp. 16‚Äì17. When all the survivors had been taken off, Lane Fox and the Captain of the Derrycunihy argued over who should be last to leave the half-sunken ship.McKee, p. 151. =Mont Pin√ßon= Once 43 Recce had been reinforced and reorganised, it took its place in the fighting line, seeing its first action on 4 August, following up the retreating Germans and gaining vital information for 43 Wessex Division's attack on Mont Pin√ßon. The divisional historian praises the Recce regiment for its boldness in this action.Essame pp. 63‚Äì4. 43rd Wessex took Mont Pin√ßon after bitter fightingEllis Vol I, pp. 410‚Äì18.Essame, pp. 64‚Äì77. and on 10 August 43 Recce advanced boldly again, seizing bridges and slipping between pockets of German resistance.Essame, p. 77. =\\"Hell's Highway\\"= Following the German defeat in Normandy, the Allies advanced rapidly, until they came to the canals and rivers of the Netherlands. A bold plan (Operation Market Garden) was conceived whereby airborne troops seized bridges to allow fast-moving ground forces to 'bounce' the river crossings up to and including the Rhine at Arnhem. The parachute and glider drop went in on 17 September and the ground advance was led by the Guards Armoured Division, with 43rd Wessex given the vital task of following up and keeping the precarious single road open behind them. The plan failed: the British 1st Airborne Division was only able to reach the north end of Arnhem Bridge, and eventually were driven off. When 43rd Wessex arrived, it was too late. All they could do was make a desperate attempt to cross the Rhine by boat, and when that failed to assist the evacuation of the survivors of 1st Airborne during the night of 25 September 1944.Ellis Vol II, pp. 40‚Äì45.Essame.Horrocks, pp. 207‚Äì32. The 43rd (Wessex) Division was blamed by many airborne soldiers for its dilatory advanceRyan, pp. 462, 515. However, Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks, GOC of XXX Corps (under whose command the 43rd Division was serving), defended the division, pointing out that it could not deploy any armoured vehicles (like 43 Recce's armoured cars and half- tracks) off the single road, nicknamed \\"Hell's Highway,\\" which was cut behind them on several occasions.Horrocks, pp 223‚Äì232. Nevertheless, Lane Fox was immediately replaced as CO of 43 Recce (1 October 1944) by Major-General Thomas, the 43rd's GOC.43 Recce Regiment War Diary, September‚ÄìDecember 1944, The National Archives, Kew, file WO 171/492. The divisional history describes Lane Fox's departure as \\"a sad loss to the Regiment. Throughout the Normandy battle his constant presence with the forward troops his traditional high standards of honour and his indifference to personal danger had endeared him to all ranks\\".Essame, p. 156. In 1945, Lane Fox was appointed to command the Yorkshire Hussars, of which his father-in-law Lord Bingley was honorary colonel. He retired from the Army in 1946.

The Master System version of the game is designed to be used with the Paddle Control, and will not function correctly with any other controller. It would be the last game released in Japan with the Mark III branding and on a My Card. Gameplay Players control a cartoon rendition of a tree spirit in the form of a log named Woody. His mission is to use a ball to break down block barriers set up by an enemy known as The Mad Machine inside the Mansion Toy Factory. The barriers consist of normal blocks and special \\"mystery\\" blocks that release hazards such as toy soldiers and wind up robots, both of which will obstruct and deflect the ball in crazy ways back at Woody. There are also special blocks that grant Woody powers such as a Flameball, a skull, a hammer and even magic potions. Other features include a train that on some screens serves as a screen wide moving obstacle to players' progress and bottom screen corners that can deflect the ball back up the screen. There are 50 different levels in all before you face the final level where the players attempt to defeat The Mad Machine. One difference from most Breakout style games that Woody Pop has is the ability once players finish a level to choose a new level from up to three adjacent levels, making the game less linear.

It is a remake of the 1980 film Antropophagus.  Plot  Three Interpol agents meet at a cave where several corpses have been uncovered. While the other agents go for backup, Steven Bauers investigates the cavern, finding a journal under one of the bodies. Bauers skims through the journal, which tells the story of Nikos Karamanlis, beginning with him lost at sea with his daughter and pregnant wife. The film then shows a couple, Mary and Stuart, camping on a beach, where they are murdered by Nikos. At a train station, Mary and Stuart's friends (Vincent, Marc, Caroll, Rita and Georg) head to a vacation home in Borgo San Lorenzo, where they expect to rendezvous Mary, Stuart and Caroll's husband Stan (who is preoccupied with work). The quintet reach the outskirts of Borgo San Lorenzo, where their RV breaks down. Georg, Rita and Marc go ahead (finding the village full of bodies and abandoned except for an elusive woman in black) while Vincent stays with Caroll, who had twisted her ankle. Nikos kills Vincent, abducts Caroll, moves the RV, and disposes of two nearby campers, Hank and Allan. Georg, Rita and Marc take shelter in the vacation home, where they find Mary's blind sister, Auriet, hiding in the basement. The next day, the group reach the Karamanlis estate, where Nikos's sister Irena (the woman in black) commits suicide by leaping out a window. Inside the house, Georg finds more bodies and Nikos's journal, which he reads as Marc wanders off, running into Stan. They search for Caroll and Vincent, but Marc falls behind and is impaled on a stake by Nikos. Stan finds Caroll in the cave, and they are confronted by Nikos, who flashes back to accidentally killing his wife (during an argument over whether they should eat their dead daughter) while lost at sea. With his wife dead, Nikos ate her and their daughter to survive. After recollecting, Nikos impales Stan through the head with a machete, and cuts out and eats Caroll's unborn child. Realizing Marc is gone, Georg, Rita and Auriet look for him, with Auriet being killed by Nikos when she becomes separated from the others. After hours of wandering, Georg and Rita are ambushed by Nikos, who rips Rita's head off. Georg shoots Nikos several times, prompting Nikos to reach into the wounds, rip some of his own innards out, and gnaw on them. Despite the severity of his injuries, Nikos continues to attack Georg and tries to drown him in a pool, but becomes distracted when he hears his wife's voice. Georg gains the upper hand, and beheads Nikos with a shovel, at Nikos's own insistence. In the present, Bauers ponders how the journal got into the cave, and how it could be so thorough. As he exits the cave, Bauers finds what appears to be Georg's cell phone, and has his head shot off by an unseen assailant.  Cast   Reception  Sean Leonard from HorrorNews.net criticized the film's dialogue, plot holes, limited acting, and poor technical aspects. Leonard concluded his review by writing, \\"Anthropophagous 2000 is not going to change the world of film, or even the world of horror. But, much like Goblet of Gore, it is non-stop splatter and gore and non-stop fun. The more I see of Schnaas‚Äô work, the more excited I am to see more. His movies remind me of how much fun it is to go to a video store and pick out titles based solely on how disgusting the stills are on the back of the box.\\" The Worldwide Celluloid Massacre called the film \\"plodding\\" and \\"upgrades the splatter by several buckets but keeps the ultimate boredom\\" and categorized it as worthless. Slasherpool stated the film was \\"a disgrace to the original\\" in its review of Antropophagus. Film Bizarro praised the gore, special effects and said it was well-shot for a film of its caliber, but also that it was uncreative, and lacked the suspenseful atmosphere of its predecessor. Cult Reviews responded positively to Anthropophagous 2000, the site's only criticisms being that it was hindered by being shot-on-video and that Andreas Schnaas lacked the directorial skill of Joe D'Amato.

Dr. Kenneth H. Cooper, who helped to popularize Staub's invention, has described Staub as \\"a pioneer in exercise ‚Äî not for the athlete, but for the masses.\\" Life Staub was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on November 3, 1915. He lived in Clifton, New Jersey, for most of his life, residing in the town for more than seventy years. He originally moved to New Jersey to work as an engineer for the propeller division of Curtiss-Wright, an aircraft manufacturer, during World War II. He later founded the Besco Corp., an aerospace components producer headquartered in Clifton, New Jersey. The name \\"Besco\\" stood for the \\"Bill Edward Staub Corporation.\\" Staub developed the first consumer treadmill after reading the 1968 book, Aerobics, by Dr. Kenneth H. Cooper. Cooper's book noted that individuals who ran a mile for eight minutes four-to-five times a week would be in better physical condition than those who did not. Staub noticed that there were no inexpensive treadmills for home use at the time and decided to develop a treadmill for his own use. His son Gerald, designed an on-off switch for the machine. Once finished, he sent his prototype, which he called the PaceMaster 600, to Cooper. Cooper enjoyed the invention and found the treadmill's first customers, who included fitness equipment salespeople. In a 2012 interview, Cooper said of Staub's early prototype: \\"There really wasn‚Äôt a practical treadmill in those days ... no one had come along with a way for people to exercise indoors, in a way that simulated outdoor exercise.\\" Staub began production of the first home treadmills at his plant in Clifton, New Jersey, before moving production to Little Falls, New Jersey. The success of the treadmill lead Staub to slowly halt his work in the aerospace industry. Instead he focused on the treadmill through his work at Aerobics Inc., a treadmill manufacture founded by Cooper. Staub sold the business to his sons, Gerald Staub and Thomas Staub, in the mid-1990s and retired from the industry. He used the treadmill until two months before his death in 2012. Outside of engineering, Staub owned the Colonial Lanes bowling alley in Lawrenceville, New Jersey, and was a bowling enthusiast. In 2006, Runner's World magazine paid tribute to Staub in a feature article titled, \\"Our Favorite Things: 40 Years of Running Gear Innovation.\\" The magazine stated that the PaceMaster 600 eliminated bad weather as a valid excuse to skip running. William Staub died on July 19, 2012, at the age of 96, at his home in Clifton, New Jersey. His wife, Dorothy, died in 2007, and their daughter, Patricia, died in 1977. Staub was survived by two daughters, Dorothy Kentis and Dolores Colucci-Healey; four sons, William, Norman, Gerald and Thomas; twenty-one grandchildren and fourteen great-grandchildren.

Built between 1919 and 1921 at a cost of $750,000, designed by famed Chicago-based architectural firm Rapp and Rapp and well-known Chattanooga architect Reuben H. Hunt, and constructed by the John Parks Company (general contractors), the theatre was one of the first air-conditioned public buildings in the United States. The theatre was named Tivoli after Tivoli, Italy, has cream tiles and beige terra-cotta bricks, has a large red, black, and white marquee with 1,000 chaser lights, and has a large black neon sign that displays TIVOLI with still more chaser lights. Specifications The building seats 1,012 in the orchestra, 48 in upper boxes, 78 in the loge, 312 in the upper balcony, 312 in the lower balcony, and 104 in removable orchestra pit seating. Therefore, the Tivoli can hold more than 1,750 people. The stage's depth is and long. The ornately decorated silver and gold proscenium's width is 47 feet and 8 inches (14.3 meters and 20.3 cm) and is high. The Tivoli has had two music systems in its lifetime. When the theatre opened in 1921, a Bennett Pipe Organ was used and then replaced in 1924 with a $30,000 Wurlitzer organ. The organ, also known as the Mighty Wurlitzer Theatre Pipe Organ 235 Special, was installed in order to produce live music to accommodate silent films and stage productions. The Mighty Wurlitzer Organ is still playing almost a century later. History Reflecting the Beaux Arts architectural style prevalent in late 19th century and early 20th century America, the theatre contains a high rose-and-gold coffered ceiling, the original box office, a grand lobby with a white terrazzo floor inlaid with forest-green marble and music-motif medallions, crystal chandeliers, an elegant foyer, and red velvet-plush chairs. The primary colors of the dome panels and medallions in the outer lobby were blue and red with a salmon and gold background. The Tivoli opened at 1 p.m. on March 19, 1921 for an entire day dedicated to multiple concerts by the Tivoli Symphony, screenings of Cecil B. DeMille's 1921 film Forbidden Fruit, and a personal appearance by Forbidden Fruit's Mae Murray, all for the price of 15 to 55 cents. Professor Spencer McCallie and Mayor Chambliss, both iconic people of Chattanooga, were presented to the public during this opening and gave speeches on their admiration for the theatre. This presentation marked the opening of the Tivoli Theatre.\\"Five Capacity Crowds Visit New Tivoli On Opening Day.\\" Chattanooga Times Press, March 19, 1921. The theater served Chattanooga well for several decades as the chief location for stage and film entertainment in Chattanooga, but went into a steady decline as modern movie theaters started to appear in Chattanooga in the 1950s. The last film to be shown in the Tivoli was Snow White and the Three Stooges on August 17, 1961. The theater closed in the same year and reopened on March 5, 1963 as Chattanooga's new Cultural Center. The Tivoli was, at one time, owned by ABC and was later leased to Chattanooga as a performing arts facility. The theatre was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in April 1973. The city of Chattanooga purchased the Tivoli in 1976 for $300,000 after the theater had been in disrepair for some years; Chattanooga's Department of Education, Arts, and Culture currently owns and operates the Tivoli. In 1979, Chattanooga-based Lyndhurst Foundation gave a $25,000 grant to the then-Chattanooga Arts Council, which is now Allied Arts of Greater Chattanooga, for a feasibility study on restoring the Tivoli. Other grants for renovation included $3.5 million given by Tennessee in 1986, $3.2 million raised by a private campaign by Chattanoogans, and $300,000 given by the city government. After the Tivoli closed on June 5, 1987 for renovations, which were directed by Robert A. Franklin, the Tivoli reopened on March 29, 1989 with a recital by Marilyn Horne. These renovations included new dressing rooms to hold up to 70 performers, and an increase in the stage depth by 14 feet. First program Tivoli opened on March 19, 1921 with a total of five shows. The first show was at 1 p.m., beginning with the Overture of Orpheus and a personal appearance of Mae Murray. Following this opening was the first viewing of Forbidden Fruit. The second show, at 3 p.m., began similarly with the Overture of Orpheus by the Chattanooga Symphony, but then also incorporated a Prologue of A Cinderella Fantasy and another appearance of Mae Murray, before the second viewing of Forbidden Fruit. The 7 p.m. show incorporated A Cinderella Fantasy along with the Orpheus the Overture, but it also featured toe dancers, impersonators, and readers. Following this show was the third viewing of Forbidden Fruit. At 9 p.m., Mae Murray along with the Forbidden Fruit cast visited for an appearance and the formal opening and dedication of the Tivoli theatre. This then led into the fourth viewing of Forbidden Fruit. The fourth and final viewing of the night was identical to that of the 3 p.m., and thus began the 1921 success of the Tivoli Theatre. The making of a Historic Site Tivoli Theatre was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 11, 1973. Its condition was marked as good with few signs of neglect. The American Made Mighty Wurlitzer theatre pipe organ, which was installed in 1931, was still present, and the rest of the theatre was checked as unaltered. The Tivoli theatre was considered a significant landmark for many reasons including its reputation for being the \\"finest theater in the entire South,\\" and that it became the first theater to have air conditioning in the South and the first of five Carrier Plants in the United States. Its period of significance was marked, by the National Register, as most significant from 1875 to 1899 due to the building's architectural features. .

Twice the size of the Kit√°b-i-√çq√°n, it contains insights into the prophecies of the B√°b concerning 'Him Whom God shall make manifest' and was written in defence of the Bah√° º√≠ Revelation.Adib Taherzadeh, The Revelation of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, Vol. 2 Adrianople 1863-68 (Oxford: Ronald, 1972), p. 373. The work has not yet been translated into English.  Background  The book was written in Persian but includes quotations from the B√°b's writings in Arabic. M√≠rz√° Mihd√≠y-i-Rasht√≠, a supporter of Bah√° ºu'll√°h's half-brother, M√≠rz√° Yahy√°, and his companion Siyyid Muhammad wrote a letter to √Åq√° Muhammad-'Al√≠, a companion of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, containing various arguments against Bah√° ºu'll√°h's claim to be 'He Whom God shall make manifest', whose advent was promised in the B√°b's writings. √Åq√° Muhammad-'Al√≠ presented the letter to Bah√° ºu'll√°h, who composed the Kit√°b-i-Bad√≠ ª in response. As with many other works by Bah√° ºu'll√°h, the entire text was dictated by Bah√° ºu'll√°h, speaking in the voice of his amanuensis -- in this case, √Åq√° Muhammad-'Al√≠.  Contents of the book  Shoghi Effendi referred to the work as Bah√° ºu'll√°h's \\"apologia, written to refute the accusations levelled against Him by M√≠rz√° Mihd√≠y-i-Rasht√≠, corresponding to the Kit√°b-i-Iqan, revealed in defense of the B√°b√≠ Revelation\\".Shoghi Effendi, God Passes By (Wilmette, Ill.: Bah√° º√≠ Publishing Committee, 1944), p. 172. The book consists of short quotes from M√≠rz√° Mihd√≠'s letter followed by numerous pages refuting each argument. Bah√° ºu'll√°h includes extensive quotations from the B√°b's writings in support of his refutations. A major portion of the work is devoted to explaining the B√°b's prophecies concerning 'Him Whom God shall make manifest'. He includes numerous quotations from the B√°b's writings, such as the following (referring to 'Him Whom God shall make manifest'): :Were He to make of every one on earth a Prophet, all would, in very truth, be accounted as Prophets in the sight of God...In the day of the revelation of Him Whom God shall make manifest all that dwell on earth will be equal in His estimation. Whomsoever He ordaineth as a Prophet, he, verily, hath been a Prophet from the beginning that hath no beginning, and will thus remain until the end that hath no end, inasmuch as this is an act of God. And whosoever is made a Viceregent by Him, shall be a Viceregent in all the worlds, for this is an act of God. For the will of God can in no wise be revealed except through His will, nor His wish be manifested save through His wish. He, verily, is the All-Conquering, the All-Powerful, the All-Highest.Bah√° ºu'll√°h, quoted in Adib Taherzadeh, The Revelation of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, Vol. 2 Adrianople 1863-68 (Oxford: Ronald, 1972), p. 380 Bah√° ºu'll√°h includes strong language concerning M√≠rz√° Mihd√≠, whom he refers to as the 'wicked one', 'the evil plotter', 'the impious', 'the impudent', 'the outcast', 'the faithless soul', 'the froward', and 'he who contends with God'. He also refers to Siyyid Muhammad in the text as 'one who joined partners with God', 'the prime mover of mischief', 'the embodiment of wickedness and impiety', and 'one accursed of God'. Bah√° ºu'll√°h furthermore stigmatizes his half-brother, M√≠rz√° Yahy√°, as the idol of the B√°b√≠ community and accuses Siyyid Muhammad of disseminating Bah√° ºu'll√°h's writings in his own name.

It was established in the wake of World War I to expand the Congregation's resources beyond Germany. To this day, the monastery continues to procure funds and send personnel to Benedictine missions in the Global South. The current superior of the monastic community is Fr Adelrich Staub, Prior Administrator. History Andreas Amrhein, the founder of the Missionary Benedictines, himself grew up in Switzerland, where support of the Catholic missions was widespread. Between the time Amrhein began recruiting vocations and the outbreak of World War I, twenty Swiss compatriots had joined his young mission society. The war brought about the expulsion of nearly 70 German members of the Congregation from German East Africa, illustrating the drawbacks of having too great a focus on personnel from one country. To continue mission work, Archabbot Norbert Weber decided that it was necessary for the Missionary Benedictines to expand into non-mission lands. On September 16, 1919, Fr Adelrich M√ºhlebach, a Swiss citizen and member of the Congregation, opened a mission procure in Uznach, near the eastern shores of Lake Z√ºrich, 50 km from Z√ºrich. Following negotiations with the British government, which now controlled what had been German East Africa, this new foundation was recognized as the \\"Swiss Benedictine Father\\". This permission allowed the Missionary Benedictines to replace some of the German members who had been expelled from Tanganyika. For the next decades, Uznach acted primarily as a mission procure, rather than a true Benedictine monastery. The Congregation decided that a true monastic spirit should be fostered there, and in 1963, the community constructed a new monastery, dedicated to St Otmar. However, Swiss law prevented the foundation of monasteries, so the foundation remained a priory until the repeal of the relevant law in 1973. On January 6, 1982, the Congregation elevated the monastery to the status of an abbey, and Fr Ivo Auf der Maur became the first Abbot of Uznach. A new church was consecrated in 1988. Apostolate While maintaining the lifestyle of Benedictine monks, the abbey's community continues the important work of procuring funds for the Congregation's international missions. This includes the publication of a mission periodical, which is regularly distributed to the abbey's thousands of benefactors. Pastoral work is also a key part of the abbey's apostolate. Many of the priests help in parishes, and provide spiritual guidance to religious communities, the sick, and the elderly. Additionally, the monastery also hosts retreats and provides catechetical instruction. The Abbey of Uznach continues to send a large number of brothers and priests to the missions of the Congregation. Dependencies * Fribourg: A house at Fribourg, known as the \\"Benedictinum\\", was in existence from 1937 to 1963. Due to Nazi actions against the Catholic Church, it was thought prudent to found a study house in a neutral state to provide for the formation of German and Swiss clerics. Raised to the status of a conventual priory in 1947, the Fribourg house was in fact the monastic center of the Swiss community, while Uznach continued to act as procure. However, staffing both Fribourg and Uznach was a strain on monastic community. Fribourg was abandoned in order to develop Uznach into a genuine monastery. *Osornoe, Kazakhstan: Our Lady of the Plentiful Catch Monastery was erected in Osornoe on September 29, 2006. The monastery is located in the Archdiocese of Maria Santissima in Astana. Fr Joseph Schnider is the superior of the small community that resides there. Personnel As of May 18, 2011, the monastic community of Uznach included twenty monks in perpetual vows, around half of them ordained. Some of these monks are on assignment away from the abbey, including those at the foundation in Kazakhstan. There are also two brothers in temporal vows. Fr Adelrich Staub was elected Prior Administrator in 2010, succeeding Marian Eleganti, Titular Bishop of Lamdia, who had been the second Abbot of Uznach (1999‚Äì2009).

The battle began on 19 April 1945 and lasted until 25 May 1945, 17 days after the end of the war in Europe. The combatants were Ustashe commanded by Petar Rajkovaƒçiƒá and the Yugoslav partisans commanded by Milo≈° Zekiƒá. The battle took place in the Bosnian town of Od≈æak. The battle was a victory for the partisans. The Battle of Od≈æak was suppressed in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The only news about the battle came out on 1 June 1975 in a Serbian newspaper NIN. First stage In May 1945, the Ustashe started to retreat towards Austria after Ante Paveliƒá's decision not to defend Zagreb; however, some 1,000 soldiers led by brothers Ivan and Petar Rajkovaƒçiƒá decided not to retreat. On 19 April 1945, they possessed the town of Od≈æak and 24 nearby villages and made a stronghold at the mouth of Bosnia river entering the Sava river. The stronghold was successfully defended for more than a month, despite the attacks of partisan units coordinated with the artillery, tanks, and even air support. The Od≈æak stronghold fell on 25 May, 15 days after the end of the war in Europe. The Serbian newspaper NIN, reported that between 19 and 28 April, there was fierce combat with constant partisan charges at the Ustashe strongholds. Between those two dates, Ustashe killed around 630 partisans and destroyed an entire battalion of the 27th Division and killed a commander of the 16th Brigade of the same division, Spaso Miƒçiƒá. From the equipment, the partisans lost three batteries of artillery, three mortars and one anti-tank gun. The NIN also reports that \\"the enemy was much more dangerous and insidious than a German soldier... the 'Ustashe fought to the death.\\" The remaining members of Ustashe were defending what was left of the Independent State of Croatia, a narrow area between Bosna and Sava that included Novigrad, Donji Brezik, Vla≈°ka Mala, Od≈æak and Mrka Ada. Moreover, in that area, there was a lot of Bosnian Muslim refugees from Kladanj, Plehana, ≈Ωepƒçe, Siv≈°e, Graƒçanica and nearby populated places. The Supreme Command of the 3rd Partisan Corps, composed of 27th, 28th and 53rd Division, ordered an immediate attack on the Ustashe stronghold or the divisional headquarters would be considered responsible. Vla≈°ka Mala combat Eventually, the partisans pushed away Ustashe to Vla≈°ka Mala, a village without any natural defence line, it was a clear field. Some Ustashe commanders that found themselves in a hopeless situation started to negotiate with the partisans, but negotiations ended in partisan attack. Smaller number of Ustashe soldiers surrendered to them as POWs, but they were later found mutilated by the partisans. Such actions by the partisans probably made the Ustashe fight so fanatically. The Ustashe built trenches and every trench was large enough for a squad. As the terrain was a plain, the defenders had a view of all access roads. As their munition supply was low, they tried to make as many hits as possible. The defenders used a tactic which seemed very odd to the partisan commanders: they would let partisan units approach to 10 metres and then open fire. The partisan losses were massive. Many partisans were left wounded on the battlefield without any possible help. Another contribution to the massive partisan losses was their efforts to save the flags of units. Many partisans would be killed just because they tried to save their flag. =Ustashe counterattack= The Ustashe stronghold was attacked from Duge Njive and Lipik. The partisans launched attack after attack, but they failed to push away the defenders. In order to give his units a wider movement space, Rajkovaƒçiƒá ordered an expansion of the defence line. He commanded the left wing, while he left Ivan Calu≈°iƒá to command the western one. Rajkovaƒçiƒá divided his units into four platoons and a company commanded by Nikola ≈†anjiƒá, who also joined him. The local volunteers that were under Rajkovaƒçiƒá's command, joined the Calu≈°iƒá's unit, as Rajkovaƒçiƒá expected full discipline and readiness, which they did n't have as they were not professional soldiers. Rajkovaƒçiƒá also formed the storm units which would execute counterattacks, while a smaller unit, which he commanded would be in the center of a counterattack. Those in the last line of defence, positioned in the very village, were assigned to break the partisan defence lines. When at the beginning of May 1945, the partisan attacks started to falter, Rajkovaƒçiƒá ordered a counter-attack. The partisans did not expected a massive counterattack and their defence was broken very fast, while the defenders captured the Municipality Building, which were also the partisan headquarters. The battle was so brutal that every house in Od≈æak was destroyed, while every field was a scaffold. After the Ustashe recaptured Od≈æak and built the new defence lines which lasted until 25 May. The partisans were decimated. The 20th Serb Storm Brigade entered an area controlled by Ustashe, and within a few hours, the whole brigade was killed. The Serb partisan units, exhausted from fighting, proclaimed the unarmed civilians the \\"Ustashe criminals\\" so they massacred helpless elderly, women and children. A group of Ustashe led by Ibrahim Hujduroviƒá and Avdaga Hasiƒá decided to make a breakthrough against the 14th Partisan Brigade. The 14th Brigade was known as a \\"brigade that was accustomed to victory\\"; however, they run away in front of the attack and let the group break through without any fight. They fought like guerrillas three months later. During the Battle of Od≈æak, a struggle for every ditch and house was fierce, while objectives would be taken only with help of artillery and air force. As reported by NIN, \\"in order to capture an objective, every Ustashe needs to be killed\\". the Ustashe continued to fight even after the partisan aviation dropped bombs and used machine guns. Commander of the defence, Petar Rajkovaƒçiƒá was wounded twice by the air force strikes, but refused to surrender. He committed suicide on 25 May 1945, the day when the Battle of Od≈æak ended. Partisan decisive attack The broken partisan units were reinforced with elements of the 27th Division from Tuzla, composed of 19th Birƒáanska Brigade, 20th Romanija Brigade and 16th Brigade. Meanwhile, the famous partisan commander, Mato Beliƒá, who knew the town of Od≈æak very well, supposed to break the defence and capture the town. In order to recapture Od≈æak, the partisans were equipped with the most modern weapons. The casualties were not important, the Od≈æak had to be captured, as ordered by Josip Broz Tito, the Marshal of Yugoslavia. The partisans were equipped with artillery, mortars and the Soviet Katyusha rocket launchers. They were also connected by the radio. The partisans launched attack after attack; however, they were always thrown back by the defenders. Tito's birthday was very near, so the Supreme Command insisted that the defence must be broken before the birthday. Members of the General Staff decided to send the air force. Two squadrons travelled from Belgrade to Od≈æak. Those aircraft operated on 23 and 24 May. They bombed Od≈æak, Ada, Balegovac, Dubica, Prud, Vojskova and Osjeƒçak, while the most bombs were dropped on Vla≈°ka Mala. The Vla≈°ka Mala bunker and elementary school were completely destroyed; the elementary school served as Rajkovaƒçiƒá's headquarters. Partisans also used the long-range artillery as well as aerial bombardment. The majority of victims were, however, the civilians. Ustashe divided into two groups and planned the breakthrough. The one group was ordered to break through the Od≈æak hospital and save the wounded. Ustashe lines were broken and the strongest town's stronghold, the Nuiƒáa ≈†tala, had also fallen. The combat in the town itself lasted to the night of 24 and 25 May. On that night, both groups started the breakthrough. One group moved towards the mountainous part of the municipality, while the other moved to Prud. In Vla≈°ka Mala, tens of soldiers left around the Nuiƒáa ≈†tala. More than 700 defenders that were in Vla≈°ka Mala broke the partisan encirclement and moved to Potoƒçani and Lipa. The group that was moving towards Prud avoided one encirclement, but entered the other. Those who defended the Nuiƒáa ≈†tala fought to the last man. After they were killed, the partisans captured the hospital and within it found many wounded and civilians. They were brutally massacred. Partisans also killed every civilian that they had found. They were thrown in a mass grave in the nearby garden. The place is known as the Nuiƒá Cemetery. Aftermath The first group that failed to break another encirclement was taken away to captivity. The other group succeeded to enter Lipa and Plandi≈°ƒáe. The partisans in Od≈æak started to arrest all males from 15 years and older, often killing boys around ten years of age. Those defenders captured were taken in front of a firing squad and executed. Those who surrendered to partisans were also immediately executed. The partisans would kill anyone without making any report. The last remaining group of defenders fled in to the surrounding forest and continued to fight as guerrillas. The last man of this group was killed in the spring of 1947 in Lipa. Suppression of the battle In SFRY, mentioning the Battle of Od≈æak was prohibited. Any mention of the battle was considered \\"a plot against the Yugoslav Brotherly Union\\". The Serbian newspaper NIN was the only paper to write about it. It published two articles and published some documents connected to the battle. In order to avoid mentioning the battle, the official \\"liberation day\\" of Od≈æak was not listed as 25 May but 14 April. The battle is thoroughly described in a number of books, for example, in a 1969 book on 53rd Division, 1981 book on 16th Muslim Brigade, 1983 book on 27th East Bosnian Division, and 1983 book on 14th Central Bosnian Brigade.

Because the pharmacy was located in Kaohsiung, a major location in South Taiwan which was already a fairly big city, he was sent there in 1925, to attend Kaohsiung Senior High School.In the 1920s, Kaohsiung, then known as Takao, had become \\"the second largest city in Taiwan, ahead of Tainan and Keelung.\\" Since 1931, the Japanese \\"intensified their investments on Taiwanese industries and transformed Takao (Kaohsiung)\\" into \\"the major industrial city in southern Taiwan.\\" (An Overview of the Administration of Kaohsiung City Government (2010), book publication.

And so had the sculptor Ryumon Yasuda (b. 1891) as well as the painters Kawai Gyokud≈ç (b. 1873), Kanzan Shimomura (b. 1873), Hishida Shuns≈ç (b. 1874) and Ry≈çhei Koiso (b. 1903) ‚Äì to name but a few well-known artists. Tu-shui Huang(ÈªÉÂúüÊ∞¥), a sculptor born in 1895 when China was forced to cede Taiwan to the Japanese empire, had been the first student from the new colony to be admitted to this academy. Tu-shui Huang died young, at age 36. But he was acknowledge by that time (1930) as a fine artist, largely because of the recognition he had received in Japan. His example may have influenced Huang Ching-cheng who was only 18 when Tu-shui died. Another artists from Taiwan, the painter Shih-chiao Lee (ÊùéÁü≥Ê®µ), also had studied there, though more recently. Shih-chiao Lee who hailed from the Taipei district, was admitted by the academy in 1931 and graduated in 1935, a year before Huang began his academic studies, enrolling in the sculpture department. When Huang Ching- cheng had departed for Tokyo in 1936, the Second Sino-Japanese war was less than a year away, and the terrible Nanking massacre would happen in November 1937. Chauvinism and militarist sentiments were on the rise.Regarding the increasingly repressive, militarist and chauvinist atmosphere that grew in importance and effect in the years leading up to the war against China (1937) and even more in the war years (1937‚Äì45), see: Saburo Ienaga, Taiheyo Senso (=The Pacific War). Tokyo (Iwanami Shoten) 1968. There also exists an English version. As this author notes with regard to the Thirties, ‚Äú(t)he prewar state kept the populace in a powerful vise: on one side were the internal security laws with their restriction on freedom of speech and thought; on the other side was the conformist education that blocked the growth of free consciousness and purposive activity for political ends.‚Äù And when the country was at war, the repression got worse: ‚Äúlegal resistance could accomplish very little, and illegal antiwar activity was limited to sporadic and ineffective protests(‚Ä¶).‚Äù The situation deteriorated with the outbreak of the war against China (1937), and even more so since 1939/40 when the democracy that still had existed up to a point in the late 1930s, was rapidly suspended. Huang Ching- cheng was violating the dominant ethical code that required filial piety when he was not studying pharmacology. This had consequences. \\"When his father became aware of this matter, in anger he stopped sending him money for his living expenses and tuition. (‚Ä¶) His brother Huang Qingshun (Ching-Shuan Huang) secretly lent him money, however, and this aid helped him, in part, to complete his studies.\\"\\"Artist's biography Ëóù Ë°ì ÂÆ∂ Â∞è ÂÇ≥\\", in: ‚ÄúHuang Ching-cheng: Study of A Head ÈªÉÊ∏ÖÂüï , È†≠ÂÉè.‚Äù, ibidem. =Early work and the influence of Beethoven= The fact that in an expensive city like Tokyo, his brother's financial support proved insufficient had a good side effect. The young man was compelled to work professionally as an artist while still in art school.‚ÄúThe fact that money mattered is elucidated by Chuan-ying Yen. Comparing the situation of two other Taiwanese art students in Tokyo, Chen Jin Èô≥ÈÄ≤ (1907‚Äì98), and Li Shiqiao ÊùéÁü≥Ê®µ (1908‚Äì95), Chuan-ying Yen writes, ‚ÄúLi suffered especially straitened circumstances following his admission to the art academy in Tokyo. On the other hand, Chen Jin had ample resources and never had to worry about living expenses, enabling her to concentrate on mastering the Japanese style (‚Ä¶).‚Äù See: Chuan-ying Yen,‚ÄúSelf-Portraits, Family Portraits, and the Issue of Identity: An Analysis of Three Taiwanese Painters of the Japanese Colonial Period‚Äù, in: Southeast Review of Asian Studies, Vol.33 (2011), p.36. ‚Äì With respect to Huang Ching-cheng, Ya-li Chen flatly states: When his father ‚Äúrefused to provide him with any financial support‚Äù, the ‚Äúresult‚Äù was that ‚Äúthe young artist made his living as a part-time sculptor, accepting commissions to produce a wide variety of statues (‚Ä¶)‚Äù See: Ya-li Chen, ‚ÄúHuang Qingcheng‚Äù (paragraph of: ‚ÄúTaiwanese sculptors during the Japanese Occupation period‚Äù), in: Taiwan Culture, (ed. and published by the Ministry of Culture, Taipei), 20 Oct,. 2009. In these highly productive years, he created a considerable number of art works, among them various busts. He also did ‚Äúfull body sculptures‚Äù and ‚Äúseated sculptures.‚Äù‚Äú See: Ya-li Chen, ‚ÄúHuang Qingcheng‚Äù, ibidem. Among the works created by Huang Ching-cheng, there were a number of sculptures of Beethoven.Y.-L.Hsueh, an art historian working at the National Museum of Fine Arts, confirms that \\"Huang Ching-Cheng made quite a few copper statues of Beethoven as a token of homage to the great composer.\\" See: Yen-ling Hsueh, ‚ÄúA Portrait of Ludwig v. Beethoven ( Huang Ching-cheng. Sculpture. 1940)‚Äù, in: National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts, Collections, Digital Archives. http://collectionweb.ntmofa.gov.tw/eng98/02_fineworks_detail.aspx?RNO=09600165 . Beethoven was a composer whom the artist greatly admired, as his elder brother confirmed later on.Y.-L. Hsueh writes that the sculpture ‚ÄúBeethoven‚Äù that is now in the National Museum of Fine Arts ‚Äúwas one of Huang Chin-Cheng's representative pieces during the course of his studies in Japan. According to the artist's eldest brother, Huang Ching-Shuan, Huang Ching-Cheng had a great passion for music aside from painting and sculpture.‚Äù See: Yen-ling Hsueh, ibidem. Huang's interest in music and more specifically, in music from the West, is partly explained by his close relationship with a young pianist, Guixiang Li (ÊùéÊ°ÇÈ¶ô, also: Kwei-Hsiang Lee).Y.-L. Hsueh notes that ‚Äúhis fianc√©e, Miss Lee Kwei-Hsiang, was a Japan-based musician who gave several public concerts. The music she most often played was the work of Beethoven.‚Äù See: Yen-ling Hsueh, ibidem. According to L. Pisano, Guixiang Li was completing her professional education at one of the important music academies that existed in the Japanese capital, the T≈çy≈ç Ongaku Gakk≈ç (Êù±Ê¥ãÈü≥Ê•ΩÂ≠¶Ê†°) or Orient Music School. See: L. Pisano, ‚ÄúTaiwanese Composers and Piano Works in the XXthCentury: Traditional Chinese Culture and the Taiwan Xin Yinyue‚Äù, in: Kervan, Rivista internazionale di studii afroasiatici, a cura dei docenti di lingue afroasiatiche della Facolt√† di Lingue e Letterature Straniere dell‚Äô Universit√† di Torino, no. 1, Jan. 2005. Pisano also mentions the other important music academies in pre-World War II Tokyo and the names of alumni from Taiwan who became noteworthy composers or musicians. He writes that ‚Äúall the Taiwanese musicians of the first generation went to Japan‚Äù for the purpose of ‚Äúattending advanced music courses.‚Äù There was more to it, however. Generally speaking, Ludwig van Beethoven and Auguste Rodin stood for modernism at the time, as Y.-L. Hsueh points out.Both Beethoven and Rodin were the greatest masters which Japanese musicians and artists introduced back to their country from Europe. Their artistic thoughts and styles were significantly influential to Taiwanese art students who were learning their craft in Japan. (‚Ä¶)\\" See: Yen- ling Hsueh, ibidem. Studying music at this academy and turning at the same time to this Western instrument, the piano, was tantamount to embracing Xin Yinyue which was the Chinese term for New Music. New Music, to the Chinese of this period was everything that had been composed by Europe‚Äôs serious composers. And above and beyond this, the term referred to music by East Asian composers that was strongly influenced by Classical and modern Western composers and their composition techniques. Such a departure from classical Chinese music tradition had already been prepared by the establishment of Japanese Western-influenced music education back home in Taiwan. Barbara Mittler notes that schools dedicated to music education had been established in Taiwan under the colonial regime. They catered to students from those parts of the wealthy stratum in Taiwan that embraced modernization and ‚ÄòWestern knowledge.‚Äô Cf. Barbara Mittler, Dangerous Tunes: The Politics of Chinese Music in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the People‚Äôs Republic of China. Wiesbaden: 1997, p.78. See also: Mei-Ling Lai Kou, \\"Development of Music Education in Taiwan (1895‚Äì1995),\\" Journal of Historical Research in Music Education (Arizona State University), Vol. 22, No. 2 (April 2001), pp. 177ff. More specifically, under the conditions that existed in Tokyo in the 1930s and 40s, Beethoven and his music stood for cosmopolitanism and a thirst for freedom. David B. Dennis has pointed out that Beethoven's Ode to Joy was always interpreted as an \\"Ode to Freedom\\" by progressives around the world.David B. Dennis, Beethoven in German Politics, 1870‚Äì1989. New Haven (Yale University Press) 1996, p. 2 . \\"Beethoven's enthusiasm about the French Revolution\\" is well known.David B. Dennis, ibidem. ‚ÄìAccording to Dennis, Beethoven even intended to dedicate his Eroica to Napoleon. With regard to the latter, the composer oscillated between a very positive attitude and harsh condemnation. Beethoven admired the Republican general and the consul who had safeguarded the survival of revolutionary France when this country was attacked by a coalition of ancien regime governments. As a Rhinelander, Beethoven had cherished Napoleonic reforms that increased civil liberties and introduced a progressive legal frame of reference, the Napoleonic Code or Code civil.But Beethoven had also disapproved of the emperor who set out to subject Europe while engaging in bloody wars. Quoting Lockwood, Plantinga confirms that \\"Beethoven's lifelong attitude toward Napoleon oscillated between admiration and dislike, between approval and revulsion.\\" See: Leon Plantinga, ‚ÄúBeethoven, Napoleon, and Political Romanticism,‚Äù in: Jane F. Fulcher (ed.), The Oxford Handbook of the New Cultural History of Music, New York (Oxford University Press) 2011, p. 491. In Chinese art, literature, and music, criticism of rulers has often been allusive and indirect.The ‚ÄúChinese tradition of protest‚Äù has always implied that the intellectual is a person who ‚Äúnever tire(s) of getting involved in politics‚Äù for the purpose of ‚Äúbettering society‚Äù, as Mittler noted. (See: Barbara Mittler, ibidem, p.42). Mittler points out that it was the repression exerted by authoritarian regimes that lead again and again to oblique, allusive forms of criticism. Huang's choice of Beethoven turns out to be in line with this tradition, that ‚Äúcertain cultural heroes often find favor with Chinese artists (‚Ä¶)\\" because it allows them to take a stand.Cf. B. Mittler, ibidem, p. 361. = Sculpture = Huang's relationship with Guixiang Li (with whom he shared a passion for Beethoven) is not only revealed indirectly in his Beethoven sculptures. Among the few sculptures of Huang Ching-cheng that are known to have survived World War II and that are exhibited in museums in Taiwan, there is a bust that is titled \\"My Girlfriend Guei-shiang\\".\\"Most of the artist's works disappeared due to wars (i.e. World War II and civil war)\\", as Y.-L.Chen notes. See: Ya-li Chen, ibidem. It is part of the collection of the National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts in Taichung (Gu√≥l√¨ T√°iwƒÅn mƒõish√πgu«én/ T√°izh≈çng sh√¨ ÂúãÁ´ãÂè∞ÁÅ£ÁæéË°ìÈ§® / Âè∞‰∏≠Â∏Ç).It is not clear whether the title of the work that originated in 1940 was chosen by the artist or posthumously. Another source seems to refer to the same work as the \\"Head of An Unnamed Woman,\\" adding that it probably is his fianc√©e Guixiang Li. =MOUVE= In 1937, Huang Ching-cheng teamed up with graduate students at the Tokyo School of Fine Arts to form an artist group that would organize joint exhibitions. According to G. Huang (Hu√°ng GuƒÅngn√°n ÈªÉÂÖâÁî∑) and X. Liao (Li√†o Xƒ´nti√°n ÂªñÊñ∞Áî∞), these young artists \\"seceded from the Tai Yang artists‚Äô association\\" when they formed their own group. Huang and Liao notice the group's \\"non-mainstream atmosphere.\\"G. Huang (Hu√°ng GuƒÅngn√°nÈªÉÂÖâÁî∑ ) and X. Liao (Li√†o Xƒ´nti√°nÂªñÊñ∞Áî∞), \\"T√°iwƒÅn mƒõish√π z«íng l√πnËá∫ÁÅ£ÁæéË°ìÁ∏ΩË´ñ / General Taiwan art theory\\", in Encyclopedia of Taiwan (published by the Ministry of Culture). Also online: Check the ‚ÄúSee also‚Äù section. The anti-mainstream artists soon called their group MOUVE (derived from the French word mouvement).Most scholars in Taiwan give 1938 as the year when MOUVE was founded, but some insist on 1937. G. Huang and X. Liao give the year 1937 (Guangnan Huang/Xintian Liao, ibidem), probably referring to the initial group formation that preceded the adoption of the name ‚ÄòMOUVE.‚Äô Others give the year 1938, probably referring to the date of the first group exhibition of the MOUVE artists. Lai Hsien-tsung, for instance, writes that Huang and the other Taiwan artists ‚Äúfounded the Action Art Group (or MOUVE painting group) in 1938‚Äù (Hsien-tsung Lai ibidem.) Lai mentions another term by which the artists referred to their group, writing that the name chosen was ‚ÄúAction Art Group (or MOUVE painting group).‚Äù ‚ÄúAction Art Group‚Äù in Chinese is ‚Äúx√≠ngd√≤ng mƒõish√π j√≠tu√°n Ë°åÂãïÁæéË°ìÈõÜÂúò.‚ÄùHsien-tsung Lai, ibidem. According to Chin-hsien Li, it was ‚ÄúL√°n Y√πn-dƒìng who recommended the name MOUVE.‚Äù Chin-hsien Li points out that at first, the young artists only wrote MOUVE ‚Äúin Japanese katakana\\" which emphasized the term's French origin. No Chinese equivalent of the name existed initially. It was a symbolic choice that indicated a turn to the ‚Äònew,‚Äô away from the traditional art embraced by scholars and artists educated during the Qing dynasty and away from the academic Western-style painting practiced by many artists in Tokyo.See: Chin- hsien Li, ‚ÄúMOUVE‚Äù, ibidem. The rules that were drawn up by the group stressed research or studies: ‚Äú1. Our goal is to study from each other frequently. 2. Each year, exhibitions of our studies shall not be fixed in numbers but shall be held when and where suitable (‚Ä¶)‚ÄùIt is mentioned that ‚Äú(t)he young artists had the greatest respect for Hung Jui-lin [Jui-Lin Hung = H√≥ng Ru√¨l√≠n Ê¥™ÁëûÈ∫ü] whose works had been selected three times for the Sunyokai (exhibition).\\" See: Zh≈çnghu√° m√≠ngu√≥ b«êhu√¨ ‰∏≠ËèØÊ∞ëÂúãÁ≠ÜÊúÉ The Chinese PEN; publ. by Taipei Chinese Center, International P.E.N.; Vol. 1, 1972, p.59 Hsien-tsung Lai refers to the group as ‚Äúanti-establishment.‚Äù Jen-yi Lai specifically refers to the ‚ÄúBohemian spirit‚Äù revealed in the works of one painter of this group, Jui-Lin Hung (H√≥ng Ru√¨l√≠n Ê¥™ÁëûÈ∫ü), whom she singles out. But the Bohemian attitude was symptomatic of all members of this group.See: Jen-yi Lai, ibidem, p.124. ‚Äì Chun-hsien Li confirms this, saying it was Hong Ruilin, who came up with a ‚Äúdeclaration‚Äù which ‚Äústrongly criticized the existing arts environment‚Äù (Chun-hsien Li, ibidem). Indeed, ‚ÄúMOUVE, at the time, was free. Works were exhibited every year, no works were excluded. Regardless of how often they would take part, regardless of how many works they wanted to show, every member could participate anytime, anywhere in the joint exhibition. This was the so-called MOUVE spirit.‚ÄùN. N. ¬´MOUVE tu√°nt«ê (MOUVE ÂúòÈ´î = MOUVE group)¬ª, in: Chun-hsien Li (Lij√πnxi√°n Êùé‰øäË≥¢) et al., ibidem. Clearly, ‚Äúthe name was a symbol of avant-garde and of youth.‚ÄùChin-hsien Li, ibidem. Chin-hsien Li adds, ‚ÄúStudying in Japan in the 1930s, they saw that the opposition forces in Japan were vigorously on the rise (‚Ä¶) they also got an insight into the Tokyo art world, and as painters they were not adhering to the authorities (in the art world) but chose the rebellious side.‚Äù On 19 March 1938, the artists who had formed the new group, Wan-chuan Chang (ZhƒÅng W√†nchu√°n ÂºµËê¨ÂÇ≥), Jui-Lin Hung (H√≥ng Ru√¨l√≠n Ê¥™ÁëûÈ∫ü), Dewang Chen (Ch√©n D√©w√†ng Èô≥Âæ∑Êó∫), Chi-ch‚Äôeng Lu (L«ö Jƒ´zh√®ng ÂëÇÂü∫Ê≠£), Chunde Chen (Ch√©n Ch≈´nd√© Èô≥Êò•Âæ∑), Huang Ching-cheng, and Liu-jen Teng (Dƒõng Li√πr√©n Á≠âÂÖ≠‰∫∫) had their first group exhibition. Except for Huang, who was a sculptor and painter, they were all painters.The year and the names of Huang Ching-cheng as well as De- Wang Chen (Èô≥Âæ∑Êó∫), Ruilin Hong (Ê¥™ÁëûÈ∫ü) and Wan-Chuan Zhang (ÂºµËê¨ÂÇ≥) are given by H.Lai. See: Hsien-tsung Lai, ibidem. ‚Äì The year and the names of all participating artists are mentioned by Chin-hsien Li.

Also online; check: ‚ÄúSee also‚Äù section. = Painting = Critics at the time saw Huang Ching-cheng not only as a remarkable sculptor but also as a gifted painter. It has been emphasized that ‚Äú(d)uring his study in Japan, he (‚Ä¶) specialized in oil painting and held a solo exhibition.\\"Ya-li Chen, ibidem. Oil on canvas was preferred to ink and to water color techniques by a majority of modernist East Asian artists. In this, Huang was not different from other Taiwan-born painters who studied in the ‚ÄòWestern painting‚Äô division of a Japanese art academy.Jen-Yi Lai writes that \\"(u)nlike (a painter like) Lan Yinding, who focused on watercolor painting throughout his career and faded from the stage of colonial art salons after his mentor Ishikawa left Taiwan, those who went to Japan for systematic training in the techniques of Western art worked primarily in the medium of oil pigments, which they mastered in Japan. Under the influence of the Taiwanese and expatriate Japanese artists who acquired academic training in Japan, oil painting became the dominant medium for pictorial representation in the Western Painting Division of the colonial art salons.\\" See: J.-Y.Lai, ibidem, p.90. Chun-hsien Li (Êùé‰øäË≥¢ Li J√πnxi√°n), art historian at the Kaohsiung Museum of Fine Arts, has noted the distinctive traits and the novelty of Huang's paintings. He writes, ‚ÄúIf we look at Huang Ching-cheng‚Äôs work ‚Äì \\"Black Woman\\" ÈªëË°£Â•≥‰∫∫ (hƒìi yƒ´ n«ör√©n), we get what may be described as a very direct sense of his use of color, which is very different from that found in the artistic environment of that era.‚ÄùChun-hsien Li, in: Various authors, ‚ÄúGuƒÅny√∫ t√°iwƒÅn qi√°nb√®i y√¨sh√πjiƒÅ‚Äîhu√°ngqƒ´ngch√©ng (On the elder (or senior) Taiwan artist Huang Ching- cheng).‚Äù Also online. (Check: ‚ÄúSee also‚Äù section.) Lai also praises Huang when he speaks of ‚Äúthe mysterious painting, ‚ÄòBlack Woman‚Äô (...).‚ÄùSee Hsien-tsung Lai, ibidem. =Exhibitions= In 1939, sculptures by Huang Ching-cheng and by another Taiwanese artist, Hsia-yu Chen Èô≥Â§èÈõ®, were accepted by a jury and ‚Äúincluded in the Imperial Exhibition‚Äù (Teiten Empire Exhibition or Imperial Exhibition, in Japanese: Â∏ùÂ±ï.) of that year. A year later, in May 1940, the ‚ÄòMOUVE‚Äô group organized ‚Äúa ‚ÄòMOUVE Exhibition‚Äô of three artists‚Äù ‚Äì Wan-chuan Chang (ÂºµËê¨ÂÇ≥), ( Yong Xie Ë¨ùÂúãÂ∫∏), and Huang Ching-cheng ‚Äì in the Tainan Public Hall (T√°in√°n g≈çnghu√¨ t√°ng Âè∞ÂçóÂÖ¨ÊúÉÂ†Ç.), Tainan (Âè∞Âçó), South Taiwan.Li Chin-hsien, ibidem. ‚Äì Instead of the term ‚Äògroup exhibition, the expression MOUVE sƒÅn r√©n zh«én ‚Äì MOUVE‰∏â‰∫∫Â±ï ‚Äì ‚ÄúMOUVE Exhibition of the three artists‚Äù is used. Tainan, just like Kaohsiung, was a fairly important city in South Taiwan. In the same year (1940), Huang received an award of the Japanese Sculptors‚Äô Association and it was ‚Äúrecommended‚Äù that he should ‚Äúbecome a member of the association.‚Äù =MOUVE versus Tayang= MOUVE, which Huang Ching-cheng had been founding together with several young Taiwan-born artists in Tokyo, was now, ‚Äúat first glance, avant-garde, fresh air, so to speak, and the group‚Äôs members were painting in a new way. But it was a small group after all, no match for the power of the mainstream, especially the ‚ÄòTaiyang Art Association.‚Äô Lu Chi- cheng and Chen Chunde soon took refuge to ‚ÄòTaiyang,‚Äô and thus in the following year (1941) there was a pause in the group's activities.‚ÄùChin-hsien Li, ibidem. Another reason for this ‚Äòpause‚Äô may have been Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor and thus, the outbreak of the Pacific War. \\"At the end of 1940\\", the group ‚Äì and that meant: the majority of its members ‚Äì had already left Japan.See: G. Huang (Hu√°ng GuƒÅngn√°n ÈªÉÂÖâÁî∑) and X. Liao (Li√†o Xƒ´nti√°n ÂªñÊñ∞Áî∞), ibidem. . ‚ÄúWith the advent of the Pacific war‚Äù when ‚ÄúMOUVE was taken to be an English name‚Äù by the authorities, the artists were forced ‚Äúto change its name.‚Äù The name was now changed to ‚ÄúSculpture and Painting Association‚Äù (z√†ox√≠ng mƒõish√π xi√©hu√¨ ÈÄ†ÂûãÁæéË°ìÂçîÊúÉ). Because some old members had left, it was a smaller group now.See: G. Huang (Hu√°ng GuƒÅngn√°n ÈªÉÂÖâÁî∑) and X. Liao (Li√†o Xƒ´nti√°n ÂªñÊñ∞Áî∞), ibidem. Under the new name Sculpture and Painting Association, the group soon ‚Äúmade a come-back with another exhibition,‚Äù however. Those who participated in this group exhibition (in Taiwan rather than Tokyo) were ‚ÄúY√ºn- teng Lan (L√°n Y√πndƒìngËóç ÈÅãÁáà), Yen Shui-long (Y√°n Shu«êl√≥ngÈ°èÊ∞¥Èæç) and Cho-sao Fan (F√†n Zhu≈çz√†oËåÉÂÄ¨ÈÄ†), in addition to the remaining original members.\\" A year later, \\"MOUVE ran (‚Ä¶) out of steam, winding things up in a frenzy like a whirlwind, and it soon disappeared without a trace, after having recorded the flowering and frustration of the opposition faction of Taiwan's art world.\\" =Work in Tainan= Whereas other MOUVE artists like Jui-lin Hung had already returned to Taiwan for good, Huang Ching-cheng remained based in Tokyo. But \\"every summer, he would return to Taiwan for vacation,\\" as the curator of the Kaohsiung Museum of Fine Arts (KMFA) notes. \\"Most of the time, he would live in the Tainan house of Kuo-Jong Hsieh (Xi√® Gu√≥-y≈çng Ë¨ùÂúãÈèû).\\" During these stays in Tainan, he \\"made a lot of sculptures for renowned officials of the Tainan district and had the support of local people in Tainan.\\"See: ‚ÄúY√¨sh√πjiƒÅ xi«éozhu√†n (Artist Biography / Ëóù Ë°ì ÂÆ∂ Â∞è ÂÇ≥)‚Äù, in: Hu√°ng Qƒ´ngch√©ng; Study of A Head (ÈªÉÊ∏ÖÂüï , È†≠ÂÉè), KMFA website (Check the ‚ÄúSee also‚Äù section). In Tokyo, Huang did not only complete his studies at the Tokyo School of Fine Arts. Soon recognized for his outstanding talent and accomplishment, he was honored by being invited to participate in several important exhibitions, among them the Bunten Art Exhibition of the Japanese Ministry of Education. =Death= In 1943, Huang Ching-cheng was offered a teaching position at the Beiping Art School in Peking which was then a city occupied by the Japanese army.Yu-shan Huang, \\"N√°nfƒÅng j√¨sh√¨ zhƒ´ f√∫sh√¨ guƒÅngy«êngÂçóÊñπÁ¥Ä‰∫ã‰πãÊµÆ‰∏ñÂÖâÂΩ± The Strait Story\\", 2 June 2008. Information supplied by Huang Ching-cheng's relative, the film director Huang Yu-shan, on her website http://yushan133.pixnet.net/blog/category/1555781.. Planning to go to Taiwan first, the artist boarded ‚Äúthe passenger liner Takachiho Maru in Kobe, Japan\\" together with Guixiang Li. The ship was torpedoed by an American submarine as it approached Kƒ´run. About 1,000 passengers died. Few survived. Huang Ching- cheng was 31 when he died.Yu-shan Huang, ibidem. Huang's premature death was a considerable loss that was felt in the art world of Taiwan. Taiwanese art after Huang (1940s‚Äì1950s) The fact that Huang Ching-cheng died prematurely may have saved him from suffering the fate of artists and writers who became victims of political repression. Death at age 31 meant that he could not produce a full-fledged, mature oeuvre. Huang's death was a considerable loss that was felt in the art world of Taiwan. But there were more blows to come that would hurt the development of modern art anchored in the socio-culture of the island. The rebellious Jui-lin Hung, a leading figure of the MOUVE group, who had returned before 1943, became a miner and for several years could not afford oil colors and canvas. The painter Chen Cheng-po was shot by the KMT army in Chiayi in 1947, becoming one of the many victims of the so-called February 28 Incident.The 1947 massacres in Taipei, Chiayi, Kaohsiung, Tainan and many other places cost up to 30,000 lives including the artist Chen Cheng- po. They are known as the \\"2/28 (two-two-eight) Incident\\" because the slaughter started on 28 February. President Ma (KMT) apologized in 2010 in Chiayi for the murder of Chiayi citizens, in the context of a Chen Cheng-po retrospective. See: ‚ÄúPresident Ma apologizes for 228 Incident‚Äù, in the daily China Times, republished in the printed magazine Taiwan Today, 1 March 2010. Online at http://www.taiwantoday.tw/fp.asp?xItem=95132&CtNode;=413. Under these conditions, ‚Äú(t)he development of new art movement(s) was in fact not a smooth one,‚Äù as Chiung-jui Hsiao writes. By the mid-1950, martial law came into effect. Now, Huang Jung-ts‚Äôan (Huang Rong-tsan / Hu√°ng R√≥ngc√†n ÈªÉÊ¶ÆÁá¶), an artist who did realist woodcuts and who was a friend of the painter Chun-chen Li (Li Zh√≤ngshƒìng Êùé‰ª≤Áîü), was arrested. He was accused of ‚Äúespionage in 1951 and (‚Ä¶) executed the next year.‚Äù According to Hsiao, this > ‚Äúevent influenced avant-garde artists who were promoting modern art at that > time.

It is published on the museum website: . =Legacy= Today, many art historians and artists in Taiwan agree on Huang's pioneering role, as a modernist Taiwan-born sculptor. Together with two other sculptors, Tien-shen Pu (P√∫ TiƒÅnshƒìngËí≤Ê∑ªÁîü) who was born in 1912 like Huang, and Hsia-yu Chen (Chen Xiayu Èô≥Â§èÈõ®) who was five years younger, Huang Ching-cheng belongs to the young generation of early Taiwan modernists who followed in the footsteps of Tu-shui Huang and who surpassed him in a way.With regard to Tu-shui Huang, Chuan-ying Yen notes that in 1920, he \\"became the first Taiwanese artist to participate in the Imperial Exhibition, entering a cast plaster sculpture titled Wild Boy (Fangong ËïÉÁ´•). He participated in the Imperial Exhibition four times through 1924, and was the most revered figure in the cultural establishment of Taiwan.\\" See: Chuan-ying Yen, ibidem. Insofar, few would disagree with Ya-li Chen that ‚ÄúHuang Tu- shui(ÈªÉÂúüÊ∞¥), Huang Ching-cheng, Chen Hsia-yu(Èô≥Â§èÈõ®) and Pu Tien-sheng(Ëí≤Ê∑ªÁîü) were the most important sculptors in Taiwan‚Äù during the Colonial era that came to an end in 1945. Huang's creative role as one of the few Taiwan-born pioneers of early modern sculpture assures him a permanent place in the history of modern art in Taiwan. =Huang in film= In 2005, Huang Ching-cheng's life and work became the theme of a feature film by the Taiwanese film director Huang Yu-shan. The film, released in 2005 and titled The Strait Story, was discussed in two academic publications.See: Lingzhen Wang, Chinese Women's Cinema: Transnational Contexts. New York (Columbia University Press) 2011, and: Yingjin Zhang (ed.), A Companion to Chinese Cinema, Chichester UK (Blackwell) 2012. Huang Ching-cheng's life and work is also at the center of a documentary, ‚ÄúThe Forgotten: Reflections on Eastern Pond‚Äù (2008) by Yu-Shan Huang.

It is built on the site of fortifications that date back to 1680, and consists of a Martello tower from 1804, later additions during the Victorian Era, and bunkers and casemates that the Germans constructed during World War II.Dillon (2011), p.89. Early fortifications In 1680 it is recorded that there was a fortification with one gun on the site. Following the French attempt to invade Jersey in 1781 improvements were made to island defences with Guernsey loophole towers being built, including the nearby one at Vazon. During 1795 the fortifications were improved on the headland with additional gun positions added. By 1805 six guns were recorded on the site. The connection between St Peter Port and the fort were improved with an upgrade of the road to military standard around 1808, using money arising from the sale of land from the reclaimed Braye du Valle. =Martello Tower= The Martello tower was constructed in 1804 after the onset of the Napoleonic Wars, and during the tenure (1803-1813) of Lieutenant Governor General Sir John Doyle. To simplify matters, Doyle had a local builder named Gray construct the tower, and two others, under the rubric of \\"fieldworks\\", thereby bypassing the Ordnance Corps. The Fort Hommet tower, like the other two Guernsey martello towers, Fort Grey and Fort Saumarez, was intended as a keep for the battery in which it was placed. The Guernsey martellos are all smaller than the British martello towers, with the Fort Saumarez and Fort Hommet towers being smaller than the Fort Grey tower. Each mounted a 24-pounder carronade on the roof to support the battery. Fort Saumarez and Fort Hommet also have exterior staircases up to the second floor.Clements (1998), p. 87. =Victorian era= During the Victorian Era, the fort received additional batteries and barracks. In 1852, 68-pounder and 8\\" shell guns replaced some of the 24-pounder guns in the batteries. The largest addition, however, occurred during World War II and the German occupation of the Channel Islands. The Germans recognized the enduring utility of the site and fortified it further, creating the St√ºtzpunkt (Strongpoint) Rotenstein. St√ºtzpunkt Rotenstein St√ºtzpunkt Rotenstein, Fort Hommet The whole of the headland was designated a strongpoint. West of the Martello tower is a bunker that housed a multi-loopholed steel cupola. The Martello tower itself includes two bunkers that housed a 60cm and a 150cm searchlight, and crew accommodation. Facing north are two casemates housing 10.5cm K331(f) guns. Two similar casemates face south across Vazon beach including one now open as a museum. A Tobruk pit and a casemate for a 4.7cm Pak36(t) anti-tank gun complete the beach-facing defences. In the centre of the headland is a R633 bunker that housed a 5cm M19 automatic mortar. A reinforced field order emplacement, a fortress-quality personnel shelter, a minefield, field positions with trenches and machine gun pits, including a coaxial ball mounted MG 37(t), flamethrowers, and barbed wire completed the strongpoint's defences. Minefield No 27, comprising 417 S-mines, 464 Teller mines, and 624 captured British mines protected the headland. Post-war After the liberation of Guernsey in 1945, the British Army and the islanders stripped the fortifications. By the late 1940s all the metal fittings, including guns and blast doors, had been removed for scrap. Many of the bunkers, including the gun-casemate at Fort Hommet, were buried in an attempt to return the coastal landscape to its pre-war condition. More recently, the States of Guernsey has restored parts of the fort, and particularly the Fort Hommet 10.5 cm Coastal Defence Gun Casement Bunker. This is now open to visitors, though with restrictive hours. The M19 Maschinengranatwerfer bunker is under renovation. Protection The whole of Fort Hommet and associated structures and the whole of the German fortifications within the Fort Hommet headland was listed as a Protected Monument on 2 November 1990, reference PM137.

It was first published in 1950, and has been anthologized in both print and television. It is an example of horror fiction. Plot summary The principal protagonist of The Boy Who Predicted Earthquakes is a fifteen-year-old boy, Herbert Bittman. Herbie has a youthful fascination with astronomy but is otherwise presented as being a normal child. Shortly before the opening scenes of the story, however, he has begun to enjoy psychic skills in the area of precognition. Armed with this ability, producers have put together a reality TV show in which Herbie is photographed speaking directly to the camera and making predictions about random events, such as earthquakes, that Herbie asserts will happen in the near future. As these predictions have invariably come true, Herbie and the television show have become wildly successful. Despite this acclaim, one day Herbie refuses to allow himself to be photographed or broadcast. Without giving any reason, he flatly refuses to perform his usual role. After intense and cruel psychological pressure, he is forced to give in; the force placed on Herbie to perform on camera serves its purpose in increasing the atmosphere of fear and horror surrounding this story. Despite this pressure and his own refusal, when Herbie is broadcast making his weekly predictions of the near future, he astonishes his audience by predicting an immediate, and dramatic, paradigm shift of humanity from the familiar, ugly conditions of everyday life into worldwide utopia. Greed and hatred will disappear; and the resources wasted on competition, and worldwide preparations for war, will instead be spent for the plentiful enjoyment of all. Herbie's broadcast generates a sensational global response, as his predictions are rebroadcast around the world and millions of viewers have become convinced that he can accurately read the future. The boy and an unnamed narrator, pursued by ecstatic fans, are forced to take refuge in a skyscraper hotel located near the broadcasting studio. The rejoicing crowds cheer Herbie from far below; close to the top of the building, all he and the narrator can see are sun and sky. In the story's climactic scene, the narrator asks Herbie why he had been extremely reluctant to issue his prediction for that week. The boy responds with a confession that, although up until this point his precognitions had been accurate, this one would not be; he had deliberately lied to his television audience. With mounting dread, the narrator realizes that Herbie had, in fact, looked into the future of the coming days and seen something else, which he had not wanted to describe or share. In pressure similar to that placed on Herbie by the television producers, the narrator demands to know what it is. Herbie reports that he has seen a scene enacted in the near future which he could not understand until his childhood research in astronomy has explained it to him: he has learned about something called a \\"nova\\". What he has really seen, and had not wanted to tell his audience, was that \\"tomorrow ‚Äì the sun is going to explode.\\" Critical response The scenes of mass popular rejoicing that mark the conclusion of The Boy Who Predicted Earthquakes, juxtaposed with the story's dire reality, parallel scenes actually enacted in 1945 when crowds welcomed the end of World War II, only to find that they had been thrust into the atomic age and the Cold War. The Boy Who Predicted Earthquakes was originally published, in 1950, in Maclean's magazine. It was picked up by Rod Serling's NBC anthology series, Night Gallery; a teleplay based on the story was broadcast on September 15, 1971, as part of Night Gallery's second season premiere. The teleplay was directed by John Badham, and Herbie's role was performed by Clint Howard. Astronomy Author St. Clair appears to have confused a nova event with a supernova event; the two events were not clearly distinguished from each other by astronomers until 1931. Research subsequent to 1950 indicates that the Sun, a type G2 star, is not likely to turn into either a nova or a supernova.

Bole was the legendary inventor of equine physiognomy (\\"judging a horse's qualities from appearance\\"). Names Sun Yang, with the Chinese surname Sun Â≠´ and given name Yang ÈôΩ (of yin and yang), was renowned for his extraordinary understanding of horses. Sun Yang was given the Chinese honorific name Bole, and is also known Sun Bole (Henry 1987:28). Bo ‰ºØ means \\"eldest\\" and le Ê®Ç means \\"pleasure; happiness\\"‚Äìwas a mythological figure who first tamed horses. Bole's name was given to a star, from which he supervised the winged tianma \\"heavenly horses\\". Proposed locations of this Chinese star Bole are with Zaofu ÈÄ†Áà∂ (the legendary charioteer, see below) in Zeta Cephei within Cepheus (Chinese astronomy) (Book of Jin, Spring 1988:198), or in the constellation Scorpius (Chinese astronomy) (Harrist 1997:135-6). In Modern Standard Chinese, Bole figuratively means \\"good judge of (especially hidden) talent\\", from the chengyu idiom Bole- xiangma (). The Classical Chinese expression (from the Zhanguo Ce below) Bole yigu () means \\"to instantly raise the ask price of something\\". The name Bo Le can also be romanized as Po-le or Po Lo. Historical context Painting of Archer and Horse attributed to Yel√º Bei (899-937) Drawing of Horse and Groom by Zhao Mengfu (1254-1322) \\"Although his fame exceeded that of all others, Bole was only one of many horse experts active during the late Bronze Age\\" (Harrist 1997:136). Owing to the importance of horse warfare in ancient China, equestrian experts were highly valued. The L√ºshi Chunqiu listed ten specialized horse physiognomers, and Herrlee Glessner Creel (1965:654) said the \\"judging of horses was early recognized as a special art\\". During the Shang Dynasty (c. 1600-1046 BCE), Chinese armies first battled Eurasian nomadic warriors on horseback. As Creel (1965:670) explained, \\"The riding horse was forced upon the Chinese. It was first thrust upon their attention as a new and deadly weapon that their nomadic enemies had acquired, and it seems always to have been regarded primarily as an instrument for fighting the nomads.\\" The earliest archaeologically discovered Chinese chariot dated circa 1200 BCE during the reign of King Wu Ding (Shaughnessy 1998). During the Zhou Dynasty (1046-256 BCE), horse-drawn chariots were increasingly used both for warfare and aristocratic transportation. The first clear evidence of horse riding in China comes from the late 4th century BCE (Goodrich 1984). King Wuling of Zhao (r. 325-298 BCE) initiated the military reform of hufu qishe ËÉ°ÊúçÈ®éÂ∞Ñ \\"barbarian clothing [i.e., belted pants] and horse archery\\", which replaced chariot tactics with superior cavalry tactics. When the Chinese imported military horses and chariots from foreign \\"horse riders\\", they concurrently introduced a complex equestrian culture, which resulted in new professions in fields such as horse domestication, selective horse breeding (as early as the 14th century BCE, Creel 1965:654), horse training, horse riding, horse tack, horse care, veterinary medicine, and horse shamanism. The Chinese have traditionally believed the best horses and horse specialists came from foreign sources. While some individuals became outstanding equestrians, for Chinese people in general, Creel (1965:670) says, \\"the riding horse remained something strange, almost foreign in nature. Horses, and horsemen, were in general associated with the border areas of the north and west. It is a striking fact that the grooms and handlers of horses appearing in Chinese art seem almost always to be depicted as non-Chinese.\\" Horse physiognomy Eastern Han Dynasty bronze of a physiognomically ideal \\"Flying Horse\\". Techniques from the Chinese pseudoscience of xiangshu Áõ∏Ë°ì \\"human physiognomy; judgment of character from facial appearance\\" were extended to xiangma Áõ∏È¶¨ \\"horse physiognomy; evaluating a horse by its appearance\\". (S≈çma Áõ∏È¶¨ is a common Japanese name.) Bole was specifically a xiangmashi Áõ∏È¶¨Â∏´ \\"horse physiognomist\\", which Robert E. Harrist (1988:136) explains: \\"By studying the body of a horse, giving special attention to its bone structure and the sizes and shapes of its various parts, Bole was able to assess with unfailing accuracy hidden capacities that a lesser judge of horses would have overlooked.\\" In 1973, archeologists excavating a 168 BCE tomb in Changsha discovered the Mawangdui Silk Texts. They included a fragmentary text about judging horses, which scholars tentatively call the Xiangmajing Áõ∏È¶¨Á∂ì \\"Classic of Horse Physiognomy\\" (also used for a 5th-century text). This manuscript mentions Bole himself (tr. Harrist 1997:137); \\"What Bole physiognomized were the horses of a superior man. Yin and yang abided by the plumb line, and curved and straight were exactly even.\\" The (c. 544) Qimin yaoshu \\"Essential techniques for the common people\\" records early Chinese methods of agriculture and animal husbandry, including horse physiognomy. This text metaphorically associates parts of a horse's body with the political organization of a state, and describes the appearance of an ideal horse. > A horse's head is king; it should be square. The eyes are the prime > ministers; they should be radiant. The spine is the general; it should be > strong. The belly and chest are the city walls; they should be extended. The > four legs are the local officials; they should be long. ‚Ä¶ In judging a horse > one begins with the head. The head should be high and erect; it should look > as if it were shaved. The head should be heavy, and it is good that there be > little flesh, like the skinned head of a rabbit. (56, tr. Harrist > 1997:138-9) The Chinese historically used bronze scale models of horses as hippology reference guides to the ideal horse (Harrist 1997:149-150). The Book of the Later Han records two early examples. The horse expert Dongmeng Jing presented Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141-87 BCE) with a cast-bronze horse and written instructions for using the model to judge horses. General Ma Yuan (a renowned equestrian surnamed \\"horse\\") presented Emperor Guangwu of Han (r. 25-57 CE) a bronze model of a horse designed to clarify the points to observe in equine judging. The inscription, which listed four generations of Ma's horse teachers, said (tr. Creel 1965:659), \\"Horses are the foundation of military might, the great resource of the state.\\" Some Chinese scholars propose that the famous \\"Flying Horse\\" discovered in a Han tomb in Gansu was a physiognomic model for a superior horse in motion. Giambattista della Porta's (1586) De humana physiognomonia was an early Western parallel for horse physiognomy. Early textual references Beginning around the 3rd century BCE, Chinese classics mention Bole as an exemplar of horse judging. Bole is frequently associated with the fabled qianlima ÂçÉÈáåÈ¶¨ \\"thousand-li horse\\", which was supposedly able to gallop one thousand li (approximately 400 km) in a single day (e.g., Red Hare). Qianlima was a literary Chinese word for people with latent talent and ability; and Spring (1988:180) suggests, \\"For centuries of Chinese history, horses had been considered animals capable of performing feats requiring exceptional strength and endurance. Possibly it is for this reason that from early times horses have been used allegorically to represent extraordinary people.\\" Bole recognizing a qianlima was a metaphor for a wise ruler selecting talented shi \\"scholar-officials\\". Thus, (Henry 1987:28) \\"Geniuses in obscurity were called thousand li horses who had not yet met their [Bole]\\". =L√ºshi Chunqiu= The (c. 239 BCE) encyclopedic L√ºshi Chunqiu contrasts Bole with other legendarily-skilled exemplars: the Spring and Autumn period (771-476 BCE) archer Yang Youji È§äÁî±Âü∫ and swordsmith Ouye, and the charioteer Zaofu who served King Mu of Zhou (r. 976-922 BCE). > When Yang Youji shot at a rhinoceros, he hit a stone instead and the arrow > was swallowed, feathers and all. This happened because he was so intent on > the rhinoceros. When Bole studied the physiognomy of horses, he saw nothing > except horses. This was because he was so intent on horses. (9, tr. Knoblock > and Riegel 2000:220) > Obtaining ten good horses is not as good as obtaining one excellent > physiognomist of horses, like Bole, nor ten fine swords as good as one > excellent smith, like Ouye, nor a thousand li of land as good as one sage. > (24, tr. Knoblock and Riegel 2000:609) > As for a horse, if Bole physiognomized its quality and Zaofu held the reins, > a worthy ruler riding as a passenger in a carriage drawn by it could go a > thousand li in a single day. That such a ruler would expend none of the > effort of the physiognomist and driver and yet enjoy the efficaciousness of > the horse would be because he knows the principle of being a passenger. (24, > tr. Knoblock and Riegel 2000:633) Another L√ºshi Chunqiu chapter lists ten specialist horse physiognomers. > Of those in antiquity who expertly physiognomized horses, Hanfeng Shi [ÂØíÈ¢®ÊòØ] > examined the teeth; Ma Chao [È∫ªÊúù], the forehead; Zinu Li [Â≠êÂ•≥Âé≤], the eyes; Wey > Ji [Ë°õÂøå], the whiskers; Xu Bi [Ë®±ÈÑô], the rump; Toufa He [Êäï‰ºêË§ê], the chest; Guan > Qing [ÁÆ°Èùí], the lips and throat; Chen Pei [Èô≥ÊÇ≤], the legs and hooves; Qin Ya > [Áß¶Áâô], the front; and Zan Jun [Ë¥äÂêõ], the rear. All ten of these men were the > most skilled of their age. How they examined horses was not the same, but > each looked for characteristics that confirmed a horse's qualities. From > this they could know whether the horse had superior or inferior joints, > whether it would be clumsy or fleet of foot, whether it was made of sturdy > or inferior stuff, and whether it was highly talented or not. It is not only > the judging of horses that is like this. There are also confirming > characteristics for people, as well as for deeds and states. (20, tr. > Knoblock and Riegel 2000:543) =Hanfeizi= The (c. 3rd century BCE) Legalist classic Hanfeizi has two stories about Bole teaching horse physiognomy. > Pai-lo once taught two men how to select horses that kick habitually. Later, > he went with them to Viscount Chien's stable to inspect the horses. One of > the men pulled out a kicking horse. The other man went near behind the horse > and patted its flank three times, but the horse never kicked. Therefore, the > man who had pulled out the horse thought he had been wrong in the way of > selection. Yet the other man said: \\"You were not wrong in the way of > selection. The shoulders of this horse are short but its laps are swollen. > The horse that kicks habitually has to raise the hindlegs and lay its whole > weight upon the forelegs. Yet swollen laps are not dependable. So the hind > legs cannot be raised. You were skilful in selecting kicking horses but not > in observing the swollen laps.\\" Verily, everything has the supporter of its > weight. However, that the forelegs have swollen laps and therefore cannot > support its whole weight, is known only by intelligent men. ‚Ä¶ Pai-lo taught > men whom he disliked how to select swift race-horses and taught men whom he > liked how to select inferior horses, because swift race-horses being few and > far between would yield slow profits while inferior horses being sold every > day would bring about quick profits. (8, tr. Liao 1939:244-6) =Zhanguo ce= The (c. 3rd-1st centuries BCE) Zhanguo ce \\"Strategies of the Warring States\\" has two historical stories about Bole in which a courtier seeking an audience with a ruler compares himself to an excellent horse. After waiting three months for an interview with Lord Chunshen (d. 238 BCE), the Prime Minister of Chu, Han Ming Ê±óÊòé told a story equating himself to a ji È©• \\"thoroughbred horse; virtuous person\\" being recognized by Bole. The (c. 121 CE) Shuowen Jiezi dictionary defined ji È©• (tr. Spring 1988:188) as: \\"a thousand li horse that needs a Sun Yang (i.e., Po-le) to be recognized.\\" > You have heard of the great stallion Chi, have you not?' asked Han Ming. > When Chi was very old, he was harnessed to a salt cart to pull it up Mount > Taihang, His hooves grew weak and his haunches trembled, his tail was soaked > and his flanks drenched till sweat dripped to the ground and mingled with > lather from his withers. Midway he came to a halt. He heaved on the shafts > but could no longer climb. Po Lo came upon him there and leaping from his > chariot he cradled (the horse's head) in his arms and wept. He took off his > cape and covered the beast with it. Then Chi lowered his head and snorted, > raised it and neighed with a sound that carried to the heavens‚Äîa sound as > pure as chiming stones. And why? Because he saw that Po Lo truly knew him as > he was. (38, tr. Crump 1979:273-4) Su Dai Ëòá‰ª£ (a brother of Su Qin) from Yan wanted an audience with the King of Qi and requested Chunyu Kun Ê∑≥ÊñºÈ´°, master of the Jixia Academy, to be an intermediary. > Once there was a merchant who was selling a very fine horse. For three whole > days together he stood in the market place and no one paid him the least > attention. Finally he went to Po Lo and said, \\"I have a superior beast I > wish to sell, but I have stood in the market place for three whole days and > no one has even remarked on the horse. I beg you, sir, to come and look him > up and down, and when you leave, keep glancing back at him. For this I would > like to give you a sum equal to my expenses for one day's market.\\" Po Lo did > look the horse over carefully, and as he left he glanced back at it. In a > single morning offers for the horse increased ten-fold. Now I want to \\"show > a splendid steed\\" to the king and I have no one to introduce me. Would you > be willing to be my Po Lo? I would like to make you a gift of a pair of > white pi and a thousand measures of gold to defray the expenses of your > horses' fodder. (70, tr. Crump 1979:514) The horse allegorizing Su Dai is called a junma ÈßøÈ¶¨ \\"excellent horse; splendid steed\\", and Spring (1988:185) says Bole, \\"because of his ability to recognize merit, functions as a mediator.\\" =Zhuangzi= Unlike most classical texts that praise Bole for skill in evaluating horses, the (c. 3rd century BCE) Daoist \\"Horses' Hooves\\" chapter of Zhuangzi blames him for going against the Dao of horses. > A horse's hooves can tread upon frost and snow, its hair can withstand the > wind and the cold. It eats grass and drinks water; it prances about briskly. > This is a horse's true nature. Though one might provide a horse with > magnificent terraces and splendid bedrooms, they are of no use to it. But > then came Poleh, who said, \\"I am skilled at training horses.\\" And men began > to singe them, clip their hair, trim their hooves, and brand them. They led > them with bridles and hobbles, lined them up in stable and stall, resulting > in the deaths of two or three out of ten. They made the horses go hungry and > thirsty, raced them, and galloped them, arrayed them in rows and columns. In > front were the tribulations of the bit and the ornamental halter, behind > were the threats of the whip and the crop, resulting in the deaths of over > half the horses. ‚Ä¶ Returning to the subject of horses, if they are allowed > to live on the open land, they eat the grass and drink the water. When they > are happy, they cross necks and rub against each other. When they are angry, > they turn back to back and kick each other. The knowledge of horses amounts > to this and no more. But you put a yoke upon them and array them evenly with > moon-mirrors on their foreheads, all they know is to try to break the cross- > bar, twist out of the yoke, smash the chariot cover, expel the bit, and bite > through the reins. Therefore, to take the knowledge of a horse and make it > behave like a brigand is the crime of Poleh. (tr. Mair 80-82) =Huainanzi= The (c. 139 BCE) eclectic compilation Huainanzi refers to Bole in four contexts, three of which are similar to the L√ºshi Chunqiu. The first one (2, tr. Major et al. 2010:94) mentions him with the charioteer Zaofu: \\"Zaofu could not be Bo Le. Each had articulated a single corner but did not comprehend the full domain of the myriad techniques.\\" The second (9, tr. Major et al. 2010:324) mentions another famous charioteer Wang Liang ÁéãËâØ: \\"Thus is Bo Le selects the steeds and Wang Liang drives them, and enlightened ruler can ride without the trouble of selecting horses or driving and can undertake a journey of a thousand li. He is carried by the capabilities of others as if they were his feathers and wings.\\" The third context (11, tr. Major et al. 2010:414, 416) lists the swordsmith Ouye with three above horse physiognomers: \\"Thus it is said, 'Obtaining ten sharp swords is not as good as attaining the skill of Ou Ye; obtaining one hundred fleet horses is not as good as attaining the arts of Bo Le ‚Ä¶ The assessment methods of Bo Le, Han Feng, Qin Ya, and Guan Qing were all different, but their understanding of horses was as one.\\" The final Huainanzi context is a well-known story about Duke Mu of Qin, Bole, Bole's sons, and Jiufang Gao ‰πùÊñπÁöã. > Duke Mu of Qin addressed Bo Le saying: \\"You are getting on in years. Is > anyone in your family who can take over for you and find me a good steed?\\" > Bo Le replied; \\"A good horse may be judged by his physique, countenance, > sinews, and bones. But in judging the best horse in the world, it seems as > if it is not there at all, as if it has disappeared, as if it had lost its > singular identity. A horse like that raises no dust and leaves no tracks. > All my sons are lesser talents. They can judge a good horse, but they lack > the talent to judge the best horse in the world. However, there is a man who > is my porter and firewood gatherer who is called Nine-Cornered Hillock. In > judging horses, he is not inferior to my abilities. I respectfully request > that you grant him an audience.\\" Duke Mu granted him an audience and > commanded him to search out a fine steed. After three months Nine-Cornered > Hillock returned and reported: \\"The horse has been located. It is in > Shaqiu.\\" Duke Mu replied: \\"What kind of horse is it?\\" \\"It is a yellow mare,\\" > answered Nine-Cornered Hillock. Thereupon Duke Mu sent men to Shaqiu to > obtain the horse. The horse, however, turned out to be a black stallion. > Duke Mu was quite displeased. Summoning Bo Le, he inquired of him saying: > \\"What a loss! The man you sent to find me a good steed cannot distinguish > the color of one coat from another nor a female from a male, what could he > possibly know about horses?\\" Bo Le let out a long sigh and replied: \\"It > always comes to this! This is precisely why he surpasses me by a thousand or > ten thousand fold and is infinite in his capabilities. What Hillock observes > is dynamism of Heaven. He recognizes the refined essence and discards the > dross. He focuses on the internal and disregards the external. He looks at > what is to be seen and does not look at what is not to be seen. He > scrutinizes what is to be scrutinized and disregards what is not to be > scrutinized. It appears that what he has judged is [a quality] more precious > than just a horse.\\" The horse arrived and ultimately proved to be an > excellent horse. Therefore the Laozi says: \\"Great straightness is as if > bent; great skill is as clumsy.\\" (12, tr. Major et al. 2010:458) The (c. 3rd-4th century CE) Daoist Liezi (tr. Giles 1912:66) repeats this story about Bole recommending Jiufang Gao to Duke Mu. For comparison, \\"A good horse can be picked out by its general build and appearance. But the superlative horse‚Äîone that raises no dust and leaves no tracks‚Äîis something evanescent and fleeting, elusive as thin air.\\" =Han Yu= The Tang dynasty poet Han Yu (768-824) wrote a well-known fable about Bole and qianlima. > Only when an era has a man like Po-le are there thousand-li horses. > Thousand-li horses are common, but Po-les, on the other hand, are rare. Thus > even though there may be famous horses, they only become abused under the > hand of the man to whom they are enslaved, and they die in the stables‚Äînever > having been recognized as thousand-li horses. Thousand-li horses at times > consume a whole dan [approximately 60 kg] of grain in one feeding. If the > one who feeds them does so without knowing they are capable of a thousand- > li, then even though they may have the ability to go so far, they, having > not eaten their fill, are lacking in strength, and their talent and beauty > are not apparent. Moreover, if one wanted to rank them with regular horses, > they would not make the grade. How then could they be asked to have the > ability of going a thousand li? They are whipped inappropriately and fed in > such a way that they cannot fulfil their innate talents. Yet when they cry > out, they cannot be understood. With whip in hand the man approaches them > and says, \\"There are not any good horses in the empire.\\" Alas! Is it that > there are really no good horses or is it perhaps that there is no one who > really understands horses? (tr. Spring 1988:187) Textual attributions The name Bole occurs in titles of various Chinese books on equine medicine ‚Äì but this does not mean Bole was the author. Imrie et al. (2001:137) explain that, \\"As was quite often the case in China, rather than revealing their own names, authors would publish their books under the name of famous historical or even legendary figures living centuries if not millennia earlier.\\" The oldest recorded books with Bole's name are listed in the (636 CE) Book of Sui bibliographic section on veterinary texts. Two are noted as lost after the Liang Dynasty (502-577): Bole xiangma jing ‰ºØÊ®ÇÁõ∏È¶¨Á∂ì \\"Bole's Classic of Horse Physiognomy\\" and Bole liaoma jing ‰ºØÊ®ÇÁôÇÈ¶¨Á∂ì \\"Bole's Classic on Treatments for Horses\\". The third veterinary text was extant during the Sui Dynasty (578-618): Bole zhima zabing jing ‰ºØÊ®ÇÊ≤ªÈ¶¨ÈõúÁóÖÁ∂ì \\"Bole‚Äôs Classic on Curing the Various Illnesses of Horses\\". Chinese legends associate Bole with the origins of veterinary acupuncture for horses, which some Western sources misinterpret as history. For instance (Lin and Panzer 1994:426), \\"Another famous veterinarian, Sun Yang, alias Baile, wrote Baile Zhen Jing (Baile's Canon of Veterinary Acupuncture) at the time of Qin Mu-Gong (659-621 BC).\\" The (1385) Simu anji ji Âè∏ÁâßÂÆâÈ©•ÈõÜ \\"Horse-herder's Collection of Ways to Pacify Thoroughbreds\\" cites a called Bo Le zhen jing‰ºØÊ®ÇÈáùÁ∂ì \\"Bole‚Äôs Classic of ‚ÄúNeedling/Acupuncture‚Äù), but this title keyword zhen Èáù \\"needle; pin\\" can ambiguously mean either \\"needling (to lance boils, etc.)\\" or \\"acupuncture.\\" Imrie et al. (2001:137) conclude there is no reason to associate the Bole zhen jing with acupuncture because the Simu anji ji and other early veterinary texts clearly used zhen to mean \\"cauterization or phlebotomy\\".

In 1928 and 1931 she won the singles title at the Pacific Coast Championships. In 1931 she won the singles title at the Canadian Championships defeating Marjory Leeming in two straight sets. She was part of the American team that won the Wightman Cup against Great Britain 1929.

It was a Hamer Liberal Government initiated strategic plan designed to address falling literacy and numeracy standards. The totally new component of the Special Assistance Program was the provision of 1000 Special Assistance Resource Teachers (SARTs) for the delivery of services to children with learning needs. These designated teachers were also given an on-site school responsibility for facilitating a productive relationship between parents and pupils and teachers. The program involved the training of these primary teachers as SARTs and their placement in schools. Their role was the early detection and remediation of children at risk of illiteracy and innumeracy. The position was the focus of this substantial change in the delivery of special educational services to children at risk of illiteracy and innumeracy. The role incorporated all the elements of services previously performed by external consultants visiting schools. The Special Assistance Program The development and implementation of the Special Assistance Program in Victorian Primary Schools during the period 1979 - 1982 constituted the most significant innovation in the provision of special education services to children experiencing learning difficulties and in addressing declining literacy and numeracy standards. Up until the political directive to initiate this program was given, there had been no policy within the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development (previously Education Department of Victoria) directing Principals of Primary Schools to develop special programs for pupils at risk of illiteracy and innumeracy.Newton, H. F. (1982) The Development of the Role of Special Assistance Resource Teacher in Primary Schools: the Utilisation of a Needs Assessment Technique to Identify and Assess the Requirements of Personnel in the Implementation of the Special Assistance Program in Schools Monash University, M.Ed Minor thesis. p.xiii In July 1979, the Assistant Minister of Education the Hon. Norman Lacy established a Ministerial Committee on Special Assistance Programs.Lacy, The Hon. Norman MP, Minister of Educational Services (9 September 1981) The Special Assistance Program - A Ministerial Statement on New Directions in Literacy and Numeracy, Legislative Assembly, Parliament of Victoria The committee consisted of people drawn from school staffs, special education facilities, teacher training institutions and the Education Department administration. The committee's report was the basis upon which the Special Assistance Program was established. The major components recommended for the program were: :# the designation of a Special Assistance Resource Teacher (SART) at 877 Primary Schools throughout Victoria (full-time at 575 schools with more than 300 pupils; and half-time at 302 schools with between 150 and 300 pupils) :# the development of 20-day Special Assistance In-Service Training Course\\" to be delivered to designated SARTs without formal training in Special Education at four teacher training colleges :# the re-organisation of the existing special education support services into 50 state wide Special Assistance Support Centres to be accessed by each primary school through its SART. The process for the establishment of the Special Assistance Program in Victorian Primary SchoolsLetters to the Editor, (10 July 1980) The Age Newspaper, Melbourne was outlined in a speech made by Mr Lacy to SARTs at a seminar on 15 December 1980.Lacy, The Hon. Norman MP, Assistant Minister of Education (15 December 1980), The Special Assistance Program - a speech at the Opening of the Seminar of Special Assistance Resource Teachers at the Hawthorn State College Special Assistance Resource Teachers =Concept= The concept of a school based resource teacher identifying deficits in literacy and numeracy in individual children and providing assistance and resources to classroom teachers to address those deficits through special programs had been supported by the findings of numerous major committees of inquiry. Reports such as: :* the Report of the UK Committee of Inquiry appointed by the Secretary of State for Education and Science (the Bullock Report, 1975) :* the Report of the Australian Parliament's House of Representatives Select Committee on Specific Learning Difficulties (the Cadman Report, 1976) :* the Report of the Working Party on Provisions for Children with Special Needs (ACT, 1977) :* the Report of the UK Committee of Inquiry into the Education of Handicapped Children and Young People (the Warnock Report, 1978) :* the Report of Task Force 8 to the Victorian State Council for Special Education (1979) :* the Report of the Victorian Ministerial Committee on Special Assistance Programs (1980) The educational philosophy that was the foundation upon which the Special Assistance Program was built had its origins in these reports. That philosophy recognises the profound influence that a child's learning environment has on his behaviour and learning. It also acknowledges the right of children to have their learning needs met in common structural and social conditions. Arising from this philosophical perspective emerges the inescapable proposition that special assistance for children at risk of illiteracy and innumeracy (over and above the normnal learning provisions available to all children) is an essential part of a school's functioning and that the designation of a specially trained resource teacher to provide that assistance to children, their classroom teachers and their parents is an integral part of a team approach to curriculum development, teaching and all other aspects of schooling. This position was strongly supported by both the Australian Schools Commission's Report for the Triennium 1976-78Australian Schools Commission, Report for the Triennium 1976-78 (p.241) \\"The main emphasis in ordinary schools should be on adapting the procedures in the ordinary classroom to individual differences among a wider range of children. This will often involve substantial organisational changes which ... allow specialists to assist ordinary ones in the normal learning setting.\\" and the Warnock Report, which went further to assert that if ordinary schools are to improve in their efforts for children with special needs they will require special support from within their organisation. =Functions= The role and functions of the SARTs were specifically prescribed by the Government after extensive consultation with the Victorian Teachers Union (VTU) and the Victorian Primary Principals Association (VPPA). They were: :# To advise and assist classroom teachers in respect to: - the identification of children in need of special assistance, - the diagnosis of the learning problems being experienced by such children, - the prescription of appropriate programs of special assistance which may be necessary to treat such problems, - the implementation of such programs :# To consult with and assist parents in respect to their role in the implementation of any program of special assistance which has been prescribed for their children :# To identify and recommend for referral children in need of psychological guidance, speech therapy or other specialist services :# To ensure that children needing special assistance continue to participate in appropriate programs throughout their primary school life. =Appointment= The implementation of the first stage of the Special Assistance Program was only possible after further consultation and a signed agreement by the Minister of Educational Services the Hon. Norman Lacy with the VTU and the VPPA. As a result, from the beginning of the 1981 school year SARTs were designated by their schools and appointed to the 575 primary schools with enrolments of greater than 300 pupils. They were mandated to establish the Special Assistance Program in their schools. The Education Department's Special Services Division and the Primary Division monitored the progress of the implementation and produced a number of evaluative reports that were presented to the Minister. From the beginning of the 1982 school year, schools with an enrolment of between 150 and 300 pupils designated and appointed a SART to carry out the role on a half-time basis. This resulted in and additional 302 primary schools in Victoria having a school based resource teacher, bringing the total to 877 schools. It was not planned to designate a SART at schools with less than 150 pupils. At such schools it was planned that the Principal or an appointed staff member would access services from the Special Assistance Resource Centres for children at these schools in need of such services. In-Service Training Courses for SARTs A major component of stage one was the in-service education component for the SARTs designated by their schools for the new role. A survey of the qualifications and experience of the 575 designated SARTs was undertaken to assess their training requirements. The responses indicated that 200 of the designated teachers had already completed special education training courses. Of these 102 were also experienced in special education teaching. As well 28 of the 375 remaining designated teachers were experienced special education teachers. Four teacher training colleges (Melbourne, Burwood, Bendigo and Warrnambool) were chosen to provide the training programs. A course planning committee was established and drew up a set of principles and a course content outline for a 20-day, one day per week special assistance training course. The course content dealt with approaches to language teaching (esprecially reading), mathematics teaching, and identification of learning problems. The focus of the course was to enable SARTs to devise and implement programs of special assistance in their own schools. An invitation to enrol in the course was sent to all designated SARTs by the Acting Director of Teacher Education on 29 January 1981. They were told that attendance at the courses was voluntary. The responses received by the colleges overwhelmed them. Very few SARTs did not enrol in the course and many teachers from schools of less than 300 pupils were voluntarily designated by their Principals as SARTS and also sought enrolment in the training course. As a result, not all requests for the in-service training course in the Special Assistance Program could be met in the first year of its availability. During 1981, 290 SARTs undertook the course. The response from schools to the in- service training course was way beyond the Education Department's expectations and reflected the extent of expressed and latent concerns schools had for children at risk of illiteracy and innumeracy. A survey of 160 teachers who had completed this course found that, despite initial concerns, there was a good deal of support from school principals and teachers for the SART concept. However, most SARTs felt they needed more in-service training or further training in special education before they felt competent to fulfil their roles.Wishart, L. (1983). SART Program, AREA Bulletin, 15 (3), 12-15. AREA shared a concern that teachers undertaking SART duties were not qualified in special education, but their proposals to the course committee were rejected.Jenkinson, Josephine C.

The war was short lived ending before George and Lew were deployed into active duty. Federal Marshals requested military assistance from Fort Snelling concerning issues with the Ojibway tribe of American Indians in Northern Minnesota. In response the Minnesota 3rd Infantry was dispatched to Leech Lake in Walker, Minnesota on October 4, 1898. The conflict is to be known as \\"The Battle of Sugar Point\\" and is the last recorded battle between U.S. Army troops and American Indians. The Battle of Sugar Point, or the Battle of Leech Lake, was fought on October 5, 1898 between the 3rd Infantry and members of the Pillager Band of Chippewa Indians in a failed attempt to apprehend Pillager Ojibwe Bugonaygeshig (\\"Old Bug\\" or \\"Hole-In-The-Day\\"), as the result of a dispute with Indian Service officials on the Leech Lake Reservation in Cass County, Minnesota. Often referred to as \\"the last Indian Uprising in the United States\\", the engagement is also the first battle to be fought in the Northwest United States since the Winnebago War in 1827. It is considered by American War Historians to be the last battle fought between Native Americans and the U.S. Army. The engagement has cost the lives of one officer, Captain Wilkinson and five men. Among the ten that were injured were five Minnesotans, Privates; George R. Wicker, Charles M. Turner, Edward Brown, Jes S.

Wicker wrote and published (\\"In the Battle with the Chippewas,\\" which appeared in the Illustrated Home Journal of St. Louis on April 1, 1899) his war experience with the American Indians at Sugar Point Minnesota. In his writings he mentions that the American Indians (Red man) was merely rightfully fighting for the land that they (the Chippewas) deserve and have lived on far longer than the white man. George R. Wicker also states that if the tables were turned, the white man would have fought as feverishly as the American Indians have should their land be raped and pillaged by outsiders.\\"In the Battle with the Chippewas,\\" George Wicker, Illustrated Home Journal of St. Louis on April 1, 1899 An excerpt from the article reads; :\\"I must confess, wrote George Wicker, \\"that I dreaded to fire my gun at the unfortunate red man. I felt that he was but fighting for the land, country, and the rights that were his, fighting, it is true, in his own peculiar and treacherous way. Later on I learned that these sentiments were shared by many of those who with me at the time wore blue. There were and are men in high places who have oppressed, defrauded, robbed, insulted, maltreated the Indian, the rightful owner of this country, until the poor savage could no longer endure his wrongs,\\" declared Wicker. \\"He, too, loves his forests, lakes, streams, his native soil.\\" (\\"In the Battle with the Chippewas,\\" George Wicker, Illustrated Home Journal of St. Louis on April 1, 1899) (From the Minnesota Historical Society) A photostatic copy of an article by George Wicker entitled \\"In the Battle with the Chippewa,\\" which appeared in the Illustrated Home Journal of St. Louis for April 1, 1899, has been received from Miss Lillian Wicker of St. Paul, a sister of the author.

Wicker introduced a bill (Wicker-Nolan Bill) to create a State Public Safety Commission to co-ordinate the activities of all public peace and prosecuting officers. The bill passed the Senate 41 to 22. Minnesota Governor J. A. O. Preus supported the bill to create a 100-man Department of State Police to act as peace officers. In a special message to the 1921 Legislature Governor J. A. O. Preus opened the CA's long campaign for a state constabulary. A \\"terrific\\" wave of crime was sweeping across the nation, and a state constabulary was the only way to deal with it effectively. CA publications supported Preus's efforts to stomp out the new wave of youthful criminals that was attributed to movies, pool halls, and war experience. Preus supported a bill to create a 100-man Department of State Police to act as peace officers. Despite a clause that the force \\"shall not be employed in strikes arising out of labor controversies between employers and employees;' the legislature, probably realizing that labor opposition would doom the bill, ignored Preus's effort. Instead William I. Nolan and George Wicker introduced a bill to create a State Public Safety Commission to coordinate the activities of all public peace and prosecuting officers.Commercial West, December 18, 1920, March 19, 1921, both p. 8; Monticello Times, February 9, 1922, p. 1; a bill for an Act creating a Department of State Police, [1921?], Preus Papers. https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5fYkAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=VxAGAAAAIBAJ&pg;=583%2C2303104Ortonville Independent Newspaper, Mar 31, 1921, pg 2, col 1 = Minnesota Cooperative Act of 1919 = George Wicker authored the Minnesota Cooperative Act of 1919.

It was also released as the second single from the album, backed with the title track of the album. It peaked at number 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 and at number five on the Mainstream Rock chart. Lyrics and music According to Fogerty, \\"Rock and Roll Girls\\" was inspired by watching his teenage daughter and her friends hanging out. He referred to them as \\"rock and roll girls\\" so that the song title referenced them rather than groupies who the term might also refer to. It was about how teenagers have their own world that they don't tell their parents about. It illustrates those \\"last days of innocence.\\" Fogerty biographer Thomas M. Kitts finds the song a hopeful one in which the singer can escape his struggles to enter a world \\"out of time\\" in which he can find music, love and girls. Music critic James Perone agrees that the song \\"creates impressions of love, pop music and the beautiful young women of (presumably) the 1960s. According to Ultimate Classic Rock critic Bryan Wawzenek, \\"Rock and Roll Girls\\" starts out seeming like it will be a typical 1980s song glorifying rock and roll music. But then there is a twist, he says, and the lyrics then \\"speak to the mystery of pop music ‚Äì how it can become a secret handshake between friends, the soundtrack to a memory that means everything.\\" The melody and chord progression of the verses of \\"Rock and Roll Girls\\" are nearly identical to that of Chad and Jeremy's 1964 hit \\"A Summer Song,\\" except that Fogerty yodels on one of the notes. According to music critic Joe Kowalski, this one alteration \\"changes the complexion of the riff. According to Fogerty, the melody was actually based on the Rockin' Rebels' 1962 song \\"Wild Weekend.\\" Fogarty stated \\"I don't think of it as stealing‚Äîmore a case of honoring...I'm a sucker for that sound.\\" Kitts describes it as having \\"a breezy melody and an old-time rock and roll rhythm.\\" Fogerty plays the saxophone solo on the song. Reception Rolling Stone Magazine critic Kurt Loder praised \\"Rock and Roll Girls\\" as \\"a rather spectacular demonstration of what can still be done with three shitty chords and a blazing sax. The Age critic Mike Daily described it as having \\"the breezy appeal of a Buddy Holly song.\\" Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine rated it as a \\"terrific song,\\" describing it as a \\"sunny rocker.\\" Wawzenek rated the lyrics to \\"Rock and Roll Girls\\" among Fogerty's 10 greatest. Kitts believes that Fogerty's perfectionism in performing and producing the song may have robbed it of some necessary rawness and spontaneity. Rolling Stone Album Guide critic Paul Evans regards the song as \\"charming but slight.\\" Although less successful on the charts than Fogerty's previous single from Centerfield, \\"The Old Man Down the Road\\" which peaked at #10, \\"Rock and Roll Girls\\" reached the Top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at #20. It performed better on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart, peaking at #5. It performed better in Canada reaching #16 and it performed even better in Austria, reaching #10. Lawsuit Fogerty used \\"Rock and Roll Girls\\" (as well as \\"Centerfield\\") as an example of how songs evolve in his defense in a lawsuit brought against him by Fantasy Records. Fantasy Records owner Saul Zaentz claimed that the refrain of \\"The Old Man Down the Road\\" was the same as that from a Creedence Clearwater Revival song, \\"Run Through the Jungle.\\" Although Fogerty had written \\"Run Through the Jungle\\" Fantasy Records and Zaentz owned the copyright. Fogerty used progressive versions of \\"Rock and Roll Girls\\" as it was being developed to demonstrate how many blues songs are similar because they are based on the same 5-note pentatonic scale, but that they incorporate small variations.

Among many \\"firsts\\" achieved by McElroy, he became the first African American to earn a master's degree in journalism from the University of Missouri. Early life George McElroy was born 25 May 1922 in Houston, Texas to Hugh and Philomena McElroy. His father, Hugh George McElroy was a highly decorated war veteran who fought in the Battle of San Juan Hill against Pancho Villa and who fought alongside General John J. Pershing and President Theodore Roosevelt, and later was awarded the Croix de Guerre for his bravery in service during World War I. George McElroy was raised in the Third Ward area of Houston. After graduation from St Nicholas High School, he served in the United States Navy, usually stationed in Asia from 1940 to 1948, then as an information specialist at Ellington Air Force Base in Houston. Education and fight against segregation After he was honorably discharged from the military, McElroy returned to his still-segregated home state of Texas. Due to segregation (separate, but equal) laws of the time, he was forced to attend Texas Southern University (then-called Texas State University for Negroes (TSUN)) after being denied admission to the University of Texas (UT). He had applied to the University of Texas following the landmark decision of Sweatt v. Painter. In his letter of denial from UT, he was told that UT and TSUN both offered the courses he was seeking. Being a Negro, according to segregation laws, he had to attend TSUN. He responded to the denial letter from UT stating that although the courses were offered at both universities, there was little else \\"equal\\" about the universities. McElroy sued for the right to attend UT, but ultimately earned his bachelor's degree in journalism from TSUN in 1956. McElroy received a scholarship from the Wall Street Journal to attend the University of Missouri. In 1970, he became the first African American to earn a master's degree in journalism from the university. Journalism career In 1937, McElroy landed a job as a youth column writer at the Informer, the oldest African-American newspaper in Texas. He was paid $3 per column. Throughout his off-and-on 58-year tenure with the newspaper, he functioned in virtually every capacity of running the periodical. He retired in 1996, but served as Editor Emeritus until his death in 2006. After graduation from the University of Missouri, McElroy considered several job offers and accepted a position as a \\"colored sports\\" writer for the now-defunct Houston Post daily newspaper in 1954 and in 1956, he became a weekly columnist. He was the first black reporter and the first black columnist at the paper which, at that time, was the largest morning newspaper in Texas. In spite of his position as a regular columnist, his likeness in the paper above his column was a black and white sketch of his image as opposed to photos as presented for his white counterparts at the paper. In response to question to him c. 1970 from a reader of his column, McElroy responded: > The world, the nation, the state, the city are all multicolored, as in a > rainbow and multiracial. A professional journalist simply cannot afford to > reside in a racial-isolation ward. He must travel and he must converse and > he must observe and he must be curious. In 1960, during an annual meeting of the Houston Press Club, the club presented a skit portraying the year's presidential candidates. (McElroy was the first African American member of the club). Local television reporter Dave Ward portrayed democratic candidate Lyndon Johnson. Performing in whiteface, McElroy portrayed the role of Alabama Gov. George Wallace, a vigilant segregationist, after no one else wanted to portray the independent candidate.Gov. George Wallace is best known for his infamous attempt to block the de-segregation of the University of Alabama and four elementary schools in defiance of federal mandates. This portrayal made McElroy the first black cast member of the club's annual \\"Gridiron Show\\". Picketers lined the streets and the cast members received death threats leading to Houston mayor Louie Welch provided police protection for McElroy for 72 hours. Also in 1960, thirteen students from Texas Southern, led by Eldrewey Stearns, held a sit-in at the counter at a Houston area Weingarten store in protest of segregation using a model laid out by experienced sit-in students at Fisk University. In planning how to attract press coverage for the sit-in, they contacted McElroy for input who committed to send a photographer from The Informer and advised on calling the police themselves. This tip proved to be instrumental in the protest. Over 100 people eventually participated in the protest which ended peacefully. The Houston television and printed press coverage dubbed the event as the \\"first sit-in west of the Mississippi.\\" McElroy also served as the Texas correspondent for Jet Magazine and was elected as President of the Press Club of Houston. Throughout his career as a journalist, McElroy interviewed numerous persons of interest including Martin Luther King, Jr., Fidel Castro, Muhammad Ali, George Foreman and six American presidents. In a 2000 interview, McElroy stressed the continued need for black press stressing that African Americans are closer to the issues concerning their own community and he credits black press for being first in bringing the effects of crack cocaine into the limelight long before it was deemed an issue in mainstream media. > We cover issues that the major dailies don't see or fail to see. We're > closer to problems and concerns in our community. We see them first.

By 1969 the single-track lines remained, and a year later machines replaced the conductors on all routes. Thus, during the period from 1963 to 1970 the company almost doubles the length of the paths increases from 36 to 64 km, the number of employees from five hundred to one thousand, the number of trams 104 (1965) up to 152 and is growing almost three times the number carried per year passenger ‚Äî from 38.6 million to 100 million in 1976. The opening of trolleybus movement in 1968 slowed the development of the tram: since the launch of high-speed trams in 1982 right-of-way, the current increased to 75.5 km, there is no change, the last route was opened in 1988 and since then, new routes appeared. In 1985 Poljakova celebrated the history of the tram service, then conducted the test with three-car trains. A year later renumbering takes place ‚Äî to three-digit numbers of cars on the front added \\"1\\" (first depot) and \\"2\\" (for second). In 1987 the first cars Tatra T6B5SU appear in Izhevsk. Ridership for 1990-the year amounted to $143,8 million, while the number of cars per decade increased from 203 to 244, of the peak number. After the major flood in 1991, which led to a long period of decommissioning of the first depot, the further development of tram traffic develops quite slowly: first experiments with automatic announcement of stops in 1995, the purchase of four cars Tatra –¢3RF in 1997, the appearance of the conductors in 1998, the purchase of ten cars Tatra T6B5RA in 2003, the decoupling of CME in 2011. In 2011, the development of the tram (and public transportation in Izhevsk overall) embarked on a new stage in trams have electronic terminals, the tear- off coupons for travel was replaced by the printed receipts with the information on time, route, end points and the amount of payment, e-transportation card, reloadable through the terminals. In June 2012 on the website of the management company appeared to know the exact time of arrival of the tram at any stop. In 2013, the management company of Highereducation completed the modernization of one of the cars. This tram with reduced power consumption and a number of other improvements that cost the company 5 million rubles, which is much cheaper than buying a new car. The updated car received a positive response, so if funding is planned to launch several more, up to ten. In addition to the annual capital and current repairs of individual sections of tramways, according to the General development plan of the city of Izhevsk, 2006, provided for the laying of the tram lines in the districts: Alexander, North, Airport, Oriental, though in fact since that time no action in this direction has been taken. In the beginning of 2014 from Berlin arrived 10 cars Tatra KT4DM. The cars were purchased in the framework of the project modernization of the tram fleet.

Early years Simon Pierre Tchoungui was born in Nkolmending, Mefou Division, Center Province of Cameroon on 28 October 1916. He belonged to the Ewondo / Bulu group collectively known as the Beti people. He attended the Ayos school for health assistants, founded in 1932 by Eug√®ne Jamot. After his schooling he worked as a medical assistant in Yaound√© and Mbalmayo. During World War II he enrolled as a soldier in the Free French Forces from 1942 to 1945. He then studied at Dakar Medical School, qualifying as a surgeon to 1947, when he returned to Cameroun. He studied at the University of Paris from 1950 to 1956, gaining a PhD in Medicine. In 1960 Tchoungui was medical superintendent of Yaound√© Central Hospital. Political positions Tchoungui was appointed Minister of Public Health when a new federal cabinet was announced on 20 October 1961. After federal legislative elections, on 1 July 1964 the cabinet was reshuffled. Tchoungui was appointed Minister of National Economy. In 1965 he was briefly Minister without portfolio. On 18 November 1965, East Cameroon Prime Minister Vincent de Paul Ahanda was dismissed from office due to a dispute with President Ahmadou Ahidjo. Tchoungui was named his successor, and would remain head of the East Cameroon government until May 1972. Ahidjo, who was from the Hausa-Fulani north of the country, made a practice of appointing Beti Prime Ministers from the center/south to maintain balance. In June 1966 President Ahidjo called a conference that included the leaders of the two main political parties, the KNDP and CPNC and the Prime Ministers of West and East Cameroon. The participants decided to \\"reinforce national unity\\" by merging their parties into one, the Cameroon National Union (In French: Union Nationale Camerounaise - UNC). The new party came into legal existence on 1 September 1966, with Ahidjo as President and Tchoungui one of two vice-presidents. Elections were held for the Federal and East Cameroon governments on 7 June 1970 and were won by the UNC candidates, as expected. On 12 June 1970 Tchoungui was reappointed Prime Minister of Eastern Cameroun. He left this post on 20 May 1972 when the United Republic of Cameroon was declared. Tchoungui, a Catholic, played a role in the affair of Bishop Albert Ndongmo. Ndongmo was credibly suspected of being involved with rebels led by Ernest Ouandi√©. The Archbishop of Yaound√©, Jean Zoa, requested that Tchoungui ask the Pope to summon Ndongmo to Rome and then invite him to remain there. Ndongmo, who insisted on his innocence, did go to Rome but then returned to face trial. He was arrested immediately after arriving, and after several months of interrogation faced a military tribunal in January 1971, which sentenced him to death for treason. Ahidjo later commuted the sentence to life imprisonment. The affair caused tension between Muslims and Christians: some churches were burned in the North. It also caused dissension among Catholics, some of whom condemned Archbishop Zoa for being too close to the government, and for possibly assisting in removal of a popular rival. Other activities Tchoungui was elected first president of the Cameroon Red Cross Society on 30 April 1960, an honorary position. Tchoungui remained a prominent member of the UNC. On 24 March 1984 the UNC became the Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (In French, Rassemblement d√©mocratique du Peuple Camerounais - RDPC). Tchoungui was a member of the RDPC central committee.

Early life Tughtakin was the youngest son of Najm ad-Din Ayyub and his brothers included Saladin, the founder of the Ayyubid Empire and al-Adil, the later sultan of Egypt. After Saladin overthrew the Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt, Tughtakin acquired lands in the Adawiya district near Cairo that belonged to Christian churches, most likely through force. The area contained yellow clay quarries that were renowned in the region. Tughtakin had houses built in Adawiya as well as the planting of gardens.Lev, p. 116.

Emir of Yemen Following the departure of Tughtakin's brother Turan-Shah from Yemen in 1182 as a result of country-wide rebellions, Tughtakin was assigned the governor, or emir, of Yemen that year.Houtsma, p. 884. Prior to his appointment, he sent a letter to Saladin seeking the post.Slaughter, p. 128. Based in Zabid, Tughtakin successfully solidified Ayyubid rule throughout Yemen.

During Turan-Shah's reign, a system of marine patrols to guard merchant ships was instituted, as was the consequent \\"galley tax\\", an imposition for this protection. However, the warships were docked on the beaches for most of the time until Tughtakin's reign. When he was questioned as to how he would collect the galley tax, Tughtakin initially implied he would do so by force like any other ruler, but he was advised by his aides to instead put the galleys to use. Tughtakin embraced his aides' idea and dispatched his warships to protect mercantile goods from pirate raids and to monitor maritime traffic. Galleys would be sent as far as India.Margariti, p. 138. According to the medieval Muslim chronicler Ibn al-Athir, Tughtakin attempted to wrest control of Mecca, but after protests from the Abbasid caliph al-Nasir, Saladin intervened and prevented Tughtakin from seizing the city. Ibn al-Athir wrote that Tughtakin was \\"a stern ruler, harsh to his subjects, one who used to buy merchants' goods for himself and sell them at whatever price he wished\\".Richards, p. 31.

It is the first song on his 1972 self-titled debut album.  History  The song was released by The Byrds on their Byrdmaniax album the year before Browne's version came out, so many people were familiar with it before ever hearing Browne's recording. Browne has referred to the song as a \\"fable,\\" but one based in real experience. \\"I thought I was kind of writing it for this girl I knew that worked in a garden in Zuma Beach, across the street from the Pacific Ocean, and she worked in this organic food orchard,\\" Browne said in an interview, \\"like the Garden of Eden, and she was the kind of Eden-like girl, too.\\" He continues: \\"When I created the fable of this girl who lived by the sea and whose father is a captain, and eventually she would be taken away and go sailing off, I wanted to hide in the relationship. I wanted to sort of have the cocoon of this relationship to just stay sort of insulated from the world. And she was ready to move out into the world and was... you know, the relationship had broken up. That's the ... reality that was going on in my life. I just think it's odd that that's exactly how songs come into being, but if you feel it, it's about something.\\"Paris, Russ. The Jackson Browne Fans Page, Jackson Browne Audio Interview. Fitting into Browne's concern with water-based lyric themes, the song seemingly is a more straightforwardly traditional and conventional narrative than much of Browne's other early works, but the lyrics about a lost love can be read dually as a period piece - with its references to Jamaica as \\"daughter of a captain on the rolling seas\\" and to her sister ringing the \\"evening bell\\" - and, as Browne seems to confirm, as a memory of a lost young love from Browne's past near the California coast.Jackson Browne Fans Page Discography. :She would stare across the water from the trees :Last time he was home he held her on his knees :And said the next time they would sail away just where they pleased. The narrator wants her to stay to \\"help me find a way to fill these empty hours; say you will come again tomorrow,\\" but \\"next thing I knew, we had brought her things down to the bay -- what could I do.\\" Browne performed the song on The Old Grey Whistle Test in 1972. Reception Calling it an \\"exquisite love song,\\" in 1972, Bud Scoppa in Rolling Stone spent a large part of his review discussing and gushing about \\"Jamaica Say You Well,\\" explaining how he felt the song \\"perfectly embodies Browne's writing and performing approach:\\" \\"A full-chorded grand piano gives the song a rolling, even motion and a certain austerity of mood. Browne plays his voice off the piano's restrained tone, soaring up from his own basically understated vocal in mid- verse and chorus. This underplaying of mood lights Jackson's simple but evocative images with a muted radiance that aurally captures the look of McCabe and Mrs. Miller. While the music sets the tone, Browne deftly tells the tale, his imagery charged with vivid suggestion. ... Much of the dramatic force of \\"Jamaica\\" derives from its gorgeous choruses. Each chorus builds tension by offsetting its lyrical meter from the movement of the music, so that the first part of each line is packed tightly and the second part is stretched out, as here, in the second chorus: :Jamaica Sayyy yoou wi-lll :Help-me-find-a Wayyy tooo fi-lll :These-lifeless-sails-and Stayyy uhhhntil :My ships can find the sea. Harmonies enter at the \\"Sayyy\\" section of each of the first three lines, accenting the rush of words that precedes them. All the tension built up by the struggle for balance between the lyrical and musical structures resolves itself gracefully in the even last line. Naturally, Browne's single-minded delivery drives the tension to even greater heights, and the song soars. It's as moving a love song as I've ever heard.\\"Scoppa, Bud.

The neighbouring stations are Nookawarra to the south and Beringarra Station to the northeast. Description The station occupies an area of , with the homestead situated alongside the Murchison River. The boundaries of the station are approximately from east to west and from north to south. The property has double frontage to stretch of the Wooramell River as well as a portion of the length of the Murchison River. The area is well vegetated with mulga and salt bush as well as grass that grows in abundance and which was often cut to make hay. In 1910 25 tons of hay was cut and stacked for homestead stock. History In 1909 the total recorded rainfall at Milly Milly was . The total rainfall for 1911 was over 18 falls. In 1912 a total of was recorded. In 1913 which was measured over 31 falls. The average rainfall of the area is about . The country was pioneered by T. O'Grady, his brother Robert O'Grady and two other men. O'Grady constructed a rudimentary hut and shearing shed a few miles from the current homestead. The party came down with a fever in their first year and a shepherd ended up taking the sick man to Geraldton in a cart for treatment. One of the men died during the journey. Upon returning the O'Gradys built the current homestead. The station came into the hands of James Aitkin and a Mr. Birrell prior to 1879. Birrell died afterward leaving his share to be put up for auction which in turn was acquired by Aitkin. Aitkin had moved over from Victoria in 1879 with enough capital to get Milly Milly well established. The homestead was washed away in the floods of 1884, so a new one was built about from the old location. The new building was constructed of sandstone and limestone, both quarried locally with local Salmon Gum being used to provide timber. The floors are made of cement to prevent damage from white ants. A large kitchen and roomy bedrooms are surrounded by a large verandah. In 1886 the station sheared over 20,000 sheep and the station was managed by an Archie Campbell, who had been there since 1883. The Murchison district was hit by drought in 1891 but Milly Milly, along with Boolardy and Murgoo Station were believed to be the best off. Murder occurred at Milly Milly in 1893, when an Aboriginal woman was killed as she walked to Nookawarra Station with a worker from the station, Peter John Keeshan, where Keeshan was catching the mail coach. Keeshan was accused of the killing and went to trial but was found not guilty. Flooding occurred at Milly Milly and other stations along the Murchison including Mileura following heavy rains in March and April 1900. Buildings were washed away and much fencing was lost along with stock being drowned. The station was briefly owned by Archibald M'Kellar of Geraldton who had inherited it from his brother in law, James Aitken. M'Kellar, who was described as being \\"of eccentric disposition\\" died in 1904 and left a will leaving his estate to a cousin in Scotland and to hospitals in Perth, Fremantle and Geraldton, but neglected to specify the share each would receive. Acquired shortly afterward by the Mulcahy brothers, Daniel and Michael, who were well known hoteliers in Perth, Fremantle and Kalgoorlie in 1905. The brothers left the property under the management of Fred Caeser who had been manager at Milly Milly since about 1899. The station had approximately of fencing and was under the management of Fred Caeser in 1910. At the time the station was carrying 27,000 merinos which gave an annual clip of 480 bales. 4,000 fat lambs were sold-off from the station the previous year. The station also carried a herd of 2,700 shorthorn cattle as well as 300 horses. A second murder occurred at the station in November 1912 when the cook, James Carlo, was arrested after the station accountant, Percy Tompkiss, was poisoned. Tompkiss' body was found to contain traces of arsenic, used in sheep dip, which it was thought he consumed in a tinted bottle of whiskey. Carlo was committed to stand trial for murder in October 1913 At trial Carlos was acquitted on lack of evidence. In 1914 the station was still owned by the Mulcahy family and stocked with between 8,000 and 10,000 sheep as well as approximately 1,500 cattle. The property boasted 48 windmills, mostly shallow but some to a depth of . G. R. Monger had managed the station since 1912. In 1917 Michael Mulcahy died leaving his brother Daniel to carry on their pastoral and hotel interests. Daniel died in June 1925 at his home in Fremantle at age 58. His wife and 10 children were at Milly Milly at that time and received the news via Byro Station. In 1925 the trustees of the late Daniel Mulcahy purchased the thoroughbred stallion Star Comedy, the third sire bought for the station over the last few years. The first was Mait Mark who died shortly after arriving and the second, Hostage, was euthanased after breaking a leg. Star Comedy was a foal of Comedy King, a Melbourne Cup winner. The Mulcahy family turned down some offers on the property including one for ¬£80,000 in 1930. Rain from the remains of Cyclone Emma in 2006 caused flooding along much of the Murchison River including Milly Milly where the homestead resembled a small island of dry land among the floodwaters that submerged much of the property. The station had a poor season with drought striking in 2010. The station manager, Simon Broad, had been feeding stock with lupins and hay as a result of lack of feed on the ground. Calves had to be separated from their mothers and penned near the homestead where they were fed milk replacement pills. The lesse in 2012 was the Milly Milly Pastoral company. The station is operating under the Crown Lease number CL139-1967 and has the Land Act number LA3114/625.

The red, wooden church was built in a cruciform style in 1824, by an unknown architect. The church seats about 370 people. History Over the centuries, there have been several different church buildings. The first church at B√∏ was probably built around 1340. It is referenced in 1381, from the letters Diplomatarium Norvegicum. A new church was built around 1440, and the third approximately 1540. The fourth church was built in 1639. The fifth church building was completed in 1734, a little east of where the present church is located. In 1824, the sixth and present church was built. It was consecrated on 8 August 1824 by the Bishop Mathias Bonsach Krogh, Bishop of the Diocese of H√•logaland. The church was originally red painted, but in 1917 it was painted white. After the last restoration in 1970-1971, the church was again painted red. The church's fixtures are historic and include valuable objects. The pulpit is from 1762. The altar plate is characterized by the Renaissance era. German born artist Gottfried Ezekiel (ca. 1719-1798) gave the colors blue and green to the altarpiece. The artwork around the altarpiece is in gold leaf. Ezekiel first received a commission as a painter in Bergen during 1744. Dating from 1751 he arrived in northern Norway, where he painted a number of church altarpieces.

The first of these derechos occurred in late June, and caused power outages that affected nearly five million people. Three weaker derechos occurred in July, and a final derecho disrupted activities in Chicago, Illinois in early August. Only three tornadoes were reported in conjunction with the derechos. June 29‚Äì30 event On June 29, a powerful derecho with wind gusts over 90 mph began in Chicago and moved all the way to the east coast, causing massive damage in the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. Damage affected large population centers such as Fort Wayne, Indiana, Columbus, Ohio, Charleston, West Virginia, Roanoke, Virginia, Richmond, Virginia, Washington, DC, Kentucky, and Atlantic City, New Jersey. This was the first of three derechos to affect west-central Ohio. July 2 event On July 2, a much less long-lived derecho moved due south from Kentucky through Tennessee over about 300 miles. It was about as wide as its track was long.http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/120702_rpts.html Storm Prediction Center July 24 event On July 24, a very small derecho moved through Chicago (the second in four weeks) through Indiana, western Ohio (the second of three in four weeks), and down into Kentucky where its damage path broke up.http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/120724_rpts.html Storm Prediction Center July 26 event The fourth derecho in four weeks struck much of the eastern US on July 26 as a cold front brought the necessary conditions for a serial derecho. This began over Lake Erie, and spread rapidly to the northeast and southwest as it made landfall in northern Ohio and Pennsylvania. Several bow echos developed separately, even taking on the characteristics of multiple single-bow derechos, before all of the segments connected into a line echo wave pattern, the classic shape of a multi-bow serial derecho on radar. Notably, it was the fourth to hit the US within four weeks, and some areas such as Dayton, Ohio experienced three derechos within this span, where on average they receive only one derecho per year. Remnants of the derecho continued to produce isolated severe weather across the eastern US overnight. Five people were injured as a result of the storm.http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/120726_rpts.htmlhttp://www.erh.noaa.gov/lwx/events/svrwx_20120629/image002.png August 4 event On August 4, a derecho traveled 300 miles from east Iowa to Ohio, disrupting the Lollapallooza festival in Chicago. There were over 150 reports of wind damage from this storm, with five reports of hurricane-force winds (more than 74 mph) and a tornado. The derecho narrowly missed the same west-central Ohio area which was struck by three derechos within four weeks from the end of June to the end of July.

The original line-up was Hank Davis on drums (ex-Avengers, a New Zealand band), Mal Logan on keyboards (ex-Rebels), Eddie McDonald on bass guitar (Avengers), Peter Walker on guitar (Jelly Roll Bakers) and John Worrall on vocals and flute. They released two albums on Astor Records, Rock Mass for Love (August 1971) and Momento (August 1972) and had a Perth hit with \\"No Dying in the Dark\\". Bakery appeared at the Sunbury Pop Festival in January 1973 and disbanded in early 1975. History Bakery were a progressive hard rock band formed in early 1970 in Perth by two New Zealand-born musicians, Hank Davis on drums and Eddie McDonald on bass guitar ‚Äì both were ex-members of Avengers. The line-up was completed by Mal Logan on keyboards (ex-Rebels, a New Zealand band), Peter Walker on guitar (ex-Jelly Roll Bakers) and John Worrall on vocals and flute. Logan soon left and, by October, he was a member of Healing Force and, later, in Chain and Little River Band. By mid-1970, Bakery's Davis, McDonald and Walker were joined by Rex Bullen on keyboards (Bitter Lemons) and Tom Davidson on vocals. Worrall had left for Ssarb and in 1972 was a founding member of Fatty Lumpkin. Bakery's debut album, Rock Mass for Love, was issued in August 1971 on Astor Records which, according to Australian rock music historian Ian McFarlane, had been recorded live at a Mass \\"held at St George's Cathedral on 21 March 1971\\" and was \\"not indicative of the band's style of progressive hard rock\\". The group released two singles, \\"Bloodsucker\\" (February 1971) and \\"No Dying in the Dark\\" (July), before Mark Verschuer (Barrelhouse) replaced Davidson on vocals. \\"No Dying in the Dark\\" was a top ten hit on the Perth singles chart. The band's influences were Black Sabbath, Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin. In August 1972 they released their second album, Momento, by which time Steve Hogg had replaced McDonald on bass guitar and also performed vocals (Juke, King Biscuit Company, Nostra Damus) and Paul Ewing replaced Bullen on organ and vocals; when Verschuer left he was not replaced as Davis, Ewing, Hogg and Walker shared lead vocals. McDonald initially joined a new group, McAskill, and by 1975 was a member of the Phil Manning Band. Bullen worked in Jim Keays' Southern Cross and Marc Hunter's backing band before Bullen died in March 1983. In January 1973 Bakery performed at the Sunbury Pop Festival and played the festival and concert circuit along Australia's east coast. In February that year, New Zealand-born Barry Leef joined on lead vocals. In April \\"Living with a Memory\\", from their Sunbury performance, appeared on the triple-live album The Great Australian Rock Festival Sunbury 1973 on Mushroom Records. By that time Phil Lawson had replaced Hogg on bass guitar, with Lawson replaced in August by Jackie Orszaczky (Syrius). The group continued to perform without further recording until February 1975.

Its function, regulation, and utilizable pathways remain a matter of current research while it seems to be involved in DNA demethylation and therefore gene regulation.  Discovery  TET1 was first discovered in a 61-year-old patient with a rare variation of t(10;11)(q22;q23) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as a zinc-finger binding protein (specifically on the CXXC domain) that fuses to the gene MLL. Another study confirmed that this protein was a translocation partner of MLL in an 8-year-old patient with t(10;11)(q22;q23) AML and named the protein Ten-Eleven Translocation 1.  Function  TET1 catalyzes the conversion of the modified DNA base 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC). TET1 produces 5-hmC by oxidation of 5-mC in an iron and alpha-ketoglutarate dependent manner. The conversion of 5-mC to 5-hmC has been proposed as the initial step of active DNA demethylation in mammals. Additionally, downgrading TET1 has decreased levels of 5-formylcytosine (5-fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5-caC) in both cell cultures and mice. A site with a 5-hmC base already has increased transcriptional activity, a state termed \\"functional demethylation\\". This state is common in post-mitotic neurons.  Applications  TET1 appears to facilitate nuclear reprogramming of somatic cells to iPS cells. The enzyme is also utilized as part of TET-Assisted Bisulfite Sequencing (TAB-seq) to quantify levels of hydroxymethylation in the genome and to distinguish 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmc) from 5-methylcytosine (5mc) at single base resolution. The technique was developed by Chuan He and rectifies the inability of traditional bisulfite sequencing to decipher between the two modified bases. In this technique, TET1 is responsible for the oxidation of 5mc allowing it to be read as thymine following treatment with bisulfite. This is not the case for 5hmc as it is glucosylated in the initial step inhibiting its oxidation by TET1.  Clinical significance  Patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder have shown increased levels of TET1 mRNA and protein expression in the inferior parietal lobule, indicating these diseases may be caused by mistakes in gene expression regulation. Colon, breast, prostate and liver tumors have significantly reduced levels of TET1 compared to the healthy colon cells and normal epithelial colon cells with downgraded TET1 levels have greater levels of proliferation. Additionally, increasing TET1 expression levels in colon cancer cells decreased cell proliferation in both cell cultures and mice through demethylation of promoters of the WNT signaling pathway. Breast cancer cell lines with silenced TET1 expression have increased rates of invasion and breast cancers that spread to the lymph nodes are characterized by lower TET1 levels. TET1 levels could be used to detect breast cancer metastasis. A histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A increased levels of TET1 in breast cancer tissues but was a less effective tumor suppressor in patients with low TET1 expression. Breast cancer patients with high TET1 levels had significantly higher survival probabilities than patients with low TET1 levels. Degradation of TET1 in hypoxia-induced EMT lung cancer cells led to reduced metastasis rates and cells. Healthy cells transitioning to cancer cells have decreased levels of TET1 but decreasing TET1 expression does not lead to malignancy. Cancer cells using the KRAS pathway had decreased invasive potential after reintroducing TET1, likewise downgrading KRAS increased TET1 levels.

Miranda - Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church: Giovanni Stefano Donghi was an Italian Catholic cardinal. Early life Donghi was born in Genoa in 1608, the son of Bartolomeo Donghi and Giacoma Bernardi. After completing his undergraduate work in the Humanities and Philosophy, he began his university studies at the University of Bologna and completed them with a degree from the University of Salamanca.Cardella, p. 44. Ecclesiastic career Throughout the 1630s, Donghi was employed in a number of administrative positions in Rome including referendary of the Tribunals of the Apostolic Signature of Justice and of Grace. On 15 June 1635 he was appointed Protonotary Apostolic de numero participantium and Cleric of the Apostolic Camera (Treasury).Buonaccorsi, p. 426. He rose to the post of President of the Apostolic Chamber. The President of the Apostolic Camera is the fifth-highest dignitary in that office, after the Cardinal Chamberlain of the Holy Roman Church (Camerlengo), the Governor of Rome, the Treasurer-General of the Holy Roman Church, and the Auditor of the Camera Apostolica. In 1643 he acted as commissary-resident for the three legations held by Cardinal Antonio Barberini over regions in which he did not reside - effectively operating as the cardinal's representative in those regions when the cardinal was not there. He was also sent by the pope as legate to Lombardy during the First War of Castro to reach a peace agreement with the Dukes of Parma after the pope renounced the peace agreement negotiated by Cardinal Bernardino Spada.Pope Alexander the Seventh and the College of Cardinals by John Bargrave, edited by James Craigie Robertson (reprint; 2009) He was then named Protonotary Apostolic at the Datary.Buonaccorsi, p. 426. =Cardinal= Donghi was created a cardinal- deacon by Pope Urban VIII in the consistory of 13 July 1643, and assigned the Deaconry of San Giorgio in Velabro on 31 August 1644.Gauchat, p. 26, 52.

Donghi was openly a part of the Spanish faction of the College of Cardinals. Thereafter he was named plenipotentiary of Pope Innocent during the Second War of Castro,} returned to Lombardy and helped to reach a treaty with the Duchy of Parma. He and Cardinal Alessandro Bichi signed the Peace on 31 March 1644. On 3 July 1651 Cardinal Donghi was named Legatus in the Romandiola and the Exarchate of Ravenna by Pope Innocent X.Gauchat, p. 26, note 1. An inscription in Ravenna, dated 1654, commemorates Donghi's providing supplies of grain to the city during a famine.Chacon [Ciaconius], IV, p. 633.

Donghi was one of sixty-six cardinals who participated in the Conclave of 1655. On 7 April, after much twisting and turning over the candidacies of Cardinals Sacchetti, Carafa and Chigi, the Cardinals elected Fabio Chigi, who chose the throne name Pope Alexander VII.J. P.

As the name suggests, just as water finds its level even when filled in one part of a vessel with multiple openings, as a consequence of Pascal's law, the amplifier systems in communications network repeaters, or receivers amplify each channel up to the required power level compensating for the channel impairments. See, for example, channel power allocation in MIMO systems. Single channel systems In a single channel communication system the deamplification and loss present on them can be simplistically taken as attenuation by a percentage g, then amplifiers restore the signal power level to the same value at transmission setup by operating at a gain of 1/ (1-g). E.g. if we experience 6dB attenuation in transmission, i.e. 75% loss, then we have to amplify the signal by a factor of 4x to restore the signal to the transmitter levels. Multichannel systems Same ideas can be carried out in presence impairments and a multiple channel system. Amplifier nonlinearity, crosstalk and power budgets prevent the use of these waterfilling algorithms to restore all channels, and only a subset can benefit from them.

It lies about south of El-Kurru, in the Napatan Region, on the right side of the Nile. The cemetery was visited several times by researchers in the last two hundred years, but there were only brief descriptions written, and no excavations. The tumuli field at el-Zuma has been known, erroneously, as the ‚ÄúEl-Zuma Pyramids‚Äù since the first half of the 20th century. A plan was drawn up during the expedition of Karl Richard Lepsius. UNESCO inscribed Zuma's 20 hectares as a world cultural heritage site in 2003. Modern, systematic excavations began in December 2004 by a Polish-Sudanese team lead by Mahmoud el-Tayeb from the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology, University of Warsaw within the \\"Early Makuria Research Project\\". On the surface, 29 grave mounds (tumuli) are seen. Three grave types are distinguished, mainly based on the grave mound. Type I consists of hills, which are completely covered with stones. The grave mounds have a diameter of and were high. The hills of type II have a diameter of . They are built of sand and loose stones. A stone ring that goes around the hill keeps them together. The underground burial shaft is M-shaped (when viewed from above) and has two chambers, one for the funeral and the other for the grave goods. The hills of type III are flat and less than high. They have a diameter of and only a single grave chamber. The same types were distinguished for tumuli graves at El-Detti, which is also studied as part of the \\"Early Makuria Research Project\\". All grave at el-Zuma chambers were robbed.

In: Polish Archaeology in the Mediterranean, XVI (2004), pp. 400‚Äì403 Ceramics found in the graves dated late 5th and early 6th centuries. The differences between the three types of graves point to the different social standing of the people buried in them rather than to a different chronology. The eight largest tumuli probably belonged to the representatives of the elite. The most spectacular are Tumuli 6 and 7 where the tunnels are divided by a row of pillars. These two graves are located in the highest part of the site. References * El- Tayeb, Mahmoud: \\"Early Makuria Research Project. Excavations at el-Zuma, 2017. Preliminary report\\".

Commercial breweries In April 1931 the first commercial brewery in Singapore, Malayan Breweries (MBL), was formed as a joint venture between local soft drinks producer, Fraser & Neave, and Dutch brewer, Heineken. The company's first brewery, located at Alexandra Road, became operational in October 1932, with the production of Tiger Beer. In July 1931 the Archipel Brouweriji Compagnie (Archipelago Brewery Co.) was formed in Batavia (now known as Jakarta), by German brewer, Beck's, constructing breweries in both Singapore and Batavia. In November 1933 the Archipelago Brewery commenced operations from its brewery, also located on Alexandra Road, producing Anchor Beer. With the outbreak of World War II, the British annexed the Archipelago Brewery in 1939, under the provisions of the Trading with the Enemy Act 1939 ‚Äì deeming it enemy territory for its German ties ‚Äì vesting its control with the Custodian of Enemy Property. In January 1941 a new company, the Archipelago Brewery Company (1941) Limited, was formed by Malayan Breweries to purchase the brewery. Operations at both breweries ceased with the capture of Singapore by the Japanese in February 1942. The Japanese subsequently expropriated all the production facilities and ordered Dai-Nippon Breweries to produce beer from the breweries. Immediately following the liberation of Singapore, in September 1945 by the British, operations at Malayan Breweries recommenced. In 1990, it was renamed Asia Pacific Breweries (APB). The main domestic brand is Tiger Beer, brewed by APB since 1932. APB also brews Heineken Lager Beer under a license from its parent company. Other notable brands include Anchor, Baron's Strong Brew and ABC Extra Stout Microbreweries Since the mid 2000s a number of smaller microbreweries have been established throughout Singapore. There are now over fifteen microbreweries in the country, including Brewerkz Microbrewery and Restaurants (established in 1997), Archipelago Brewery (re-commissioned 2006), RedDot Brewhouse (2007), LeVel33 (2010), AdstraGold Microbrewery (2010), Paulaner Br√§uhaus, Starker Fresh Beer, The 1925 Microbrewery & Restaurant, Little Island Brewing Company (2015) OnTap (2015), Innocence (2016), & Hospoda (2016). Craft beer sales, however, account for less than 2 per cent of Singapore's beer market. Beer festivals An annual beer festival, Beerfest Asia, is held in Singapore in June each year. It was first held in 2008 and attracts over 30,000 beer lovers. The festival features over 500 beers and ciders from over 35 exhibitors around the world. The Asia Beer Awards, were established in 2008 and ran in conjunction with Beerfest Asia until 2013. The awards recommenced in 2016.

Sacred footprints of Geevarghese Mar Gregorios of Parumala are claimed to be in the parish.  Evolution Prior to the 18th century the Syrian Christians or 'Nasrani', also known as Saint Thomas Christians, had emigrated from various regions of central Travancore to Kadammanitta. These emigrants had worshiped in the neighborhood \\"Orthodox Valiyapally\\" church in Kozhencherry. Eventually for rituals like anointing of old and sick (Thailabishekam), Holy Communion (Vishudha Qurbana), and moving the departed for funeral and burial ceremony all the way from Kadammanitta to Kozhencherry became a tribulation for the believers and hence the construction of an Orthodox Syrian church in Kadammanitta was proposed. In the year 1018 (A.D 1842) the devotees constructed a chapel. Later a smallpox epidemic swept through Kadammanitta; several people fell ill, and two died. After the believers prayed to Saint John the Baptist, the smallpox epidemic ceased. Subsequently, every year the 6th and 7th of 'Makaram' of the Malayalam month was honored as the 'Veliyaperunaal' and as an offertory 'vellayappam' and 'pazham' was given, a practice that still continues. The prevailing chapel was constructed with straw and palm leaves and the chapel was enveloped with dense forest; people feared forest fires during extreme hot weather. Hence in place of the earth chapel a 'madhbaha' was built at an elevation of 5m, and an 'haikala' and stony wall at a height of 3m from ground. In the year 1044 (A.D 1868) the government sanctioned a piece of land in the name of a person named Puthenpurackal Chandy Geevarughese, and the present church was erected. This church was solemnized by the metropolitan Joseph Mar Dionysius 5 of the Pulikattil family in A.D.1869. In the meanwhile, son of Puthenpurackal Chandy, Geevarghese was ordained as the priest for the church. Geevarghese of Kadammanitta was a disciple of Parumala Thirumeni, and he had accompanied Parumala Thirumeni to Jerusalem.  Foundation stone and agreement  In A.D.1875 the Antioch Patriarchies Bishop Pathrose Thrithian had arrived to Kerala. The parish members wished to bring him to visit Kadammanitta. The parish priest Geevarghese was informed about their desire, and made the necessary arrangements for the visit. According to this schedule, in A.D.1875, in the Malayalam month of 'Thulam 16th' (31 October) the Patriarch Bishop had arrived to Kadammanitta, accompanied by Parumala Thirumeni (Chathuruthy Geevarghese Ramban). The bishop was brought to church from 'Pariyaram Mylickal' in a palanquin through a stony and isolated way. The bishop blessed the people and commanded the building of a prominent church there, in place of the existing chapel. The bishop laid the foundation stone in favor of St.Paul & St.Peter (the former church). The footprints of St. Gregorios (Parumala Thirumeni) are believed to bless the St. John's Orthodox Church of Kadammanitta. The growth and development of the former church advanced over the next 70 years. 21 prominent families signed an agreement in the year 1086, Malayalam month of 'Dhanu' 29th (A.D 1911), declaring that the church and its surrounding shall be independent from Puthepurackal family; the agreement was officially signed by Kulathoor Idiculla in Idicheriya Aranmula sub-registrar office in the year 1911 Malayalam month of 'Dhanu' 30th at 1:00pm. The copy of the agreement which mentions the maintenance of the church and its surroundings was provided to the 21 families.  Construction of the new church- 'KOODHASHA'  Due to the increasing number of parishioners, the congregation held on the 10 November of A.D.1968 decided to construct a church large enough for all the parish members. However the location of the former church was too small, so more new land was acquired from Chavadyil Mrs.Sosamma George and Mr. Babu and registered in the name of diocese metropolitan Daniel Mar Peelaksinos in 1975, in the time of Fr.P.K.Mathews. Initial construction works of the new church began. In 1983, during the service period of Fr.Thaiyil.T.M.Samuel, in the month of October, Daniel Mar Peelaksinos laid the foundation stone. In 1985, Fr.Peter Thomas was named parish vicar. By the support and guidance of the vicar Fr.Peter, the parish priest Karingattil Fr.K.C.Jacob, Kizhakeparambil Fr.K.T.Mathukutty (Convener of church construction) and the hard work and effort of the people, the church was built by 1989. On 20 and 21 January, in the presence of the bishop of Malankara Orthodox Church Baselios Marthoma Mathews, the Catholicate Designate (Neeyuktha Bava) Mathew Mar Coorilos, Daniel Mar Philexinos (Thumpamon diocese), Geevarughese Mar Osthanious (Niranam), Philipos Mar Yuosebious (Thumpamon diocese) consecrated the church.  The priest in charge of the parish services  Puthenpurackal Geevarghese Geevarghese Kathanar was the first priest of St John's Orthodox Parish, and served the church for many years. He was a great follower of Parishudha Parumala Thirumeni as he had visited Jerusalem with this him. In 1990 he had accompanied Parumala Thirumeni to Trivandrum St George Orthodox Church to perform the consecration of the church. Kathanar fell ill and died, and was buried in an English cemetery as it was difficult to bring the body back to Kadammanitta. The funeral service was led by Parishudha Parumala Thirumeni. From 1900 until 1930 Palumootil Thengumtharayil Geevarughese Cor-Episcopa, Thengumtharayil Fr.T.C. Geevarughese, Mezhuveli Kadavatharayil Veliyachen, Kochachen, had served as the parish vicars. P.C.Geevarughese, son of Puthenpurackal Fr. Geevarughese Geevarughese, was ordained as a priest for the church. Subsequently Vayalathala Vadasheriyath Fr.Gaberial, Puthenpeedika Thekkutathil Fr.K.C.Koshy had administrated the works of the parish. After these priests, in 1946 a member of Puthenpurackal family, Karingattil Fr.K.C.Jacob was ordained as a priest for the church. Until 1971 services in the church were held only every other month, increasing to four times during the dedicated service of Fr.K.C.Oommen. In 1975 Fr. K T mathews, Kizhakeparambil Son of Sri.K.G.Thomas was ordained as the priest. On 5 August 2012, Fr. P. J Joseph took charge as vicar of the church and Fr. Gabriel Joseph transferred to Mylapra orthodox church. Following the transfer of Fr.P.j. Joseph in 2015, Fr. Sam K Daniel has been appointed as the vicar.

(Map based on 2012 statistics.) This is a list of breweries in Nevada, both current and defunct. Brewing companies usually produce a range of beers in different styles that are marketed locally, regionally, and internationally. Brewing companies vary in the volume and variety of beer produced, usually being small nanobreweries and microbreweries or nationally-owned brewpubs. In 2012, Nevada's 27 brewing establishments (including breweries, brewpubs, importers, and company-owned packagers and wholesalers) employed 130 people directly, and more than 10,000 others in related jobs such as wholesaling and retailing. Altogether 19 people in Nevada had active brewer permits in 2012. Including people directly employed in brewing, as well as those who supply Nevada's breweries with everything from ingredients to machinery, the total business and personal tax revenue generated by Nevada's breweries and related industries was more than $286 million. Consumer purchases of Nevada's brewery products generated more than $124 million extra in tax revenue. In 2012, according to the Brewers Association, Nevada ranked 24th in the number of craft breweries per capita with 21. For context, at the end of 2013 there were 2,822 breweries in the United States, including 2,768 craft breweries subdivided into 1,237 brewpubs, 1,412 microbreweries and 119 regional craft breweries. In that same year, according to the Beer Institute, the brewing industry employed around 43,000 Americans in brewing and distribution and had a combined economic impact of more than $246 billion. History Brewing in the Nevada predates statehood, as the Carson City Brewery opened in 1860 four years before admission to the Union. Brewing in Nevada virtually ceased with statewide prohibition starting one year prior to nationwide prohibition. Only Carson Brewery and Reno Brewery remained to continue production in the 1930s, but statewide beer production had ceased in 1957.

Their lands lay north of Enniscorthy in the Blackstairs Mountains. It appears that at Donnchadh's death, Domhnall was taken into the care of the seneschal of Wexford, Thomas Stukeley. When Stukeley left for Spain in 1568 Domhnall went with him, which explains the origin of his nickname, Sp√°inneach (Irish for Spaniard).

After O'Byrne's death, he intrigued with Hugh O'Neill. When the Nine Years' War ended in 1603, Domhnall submitted and was awarded a pension, as well as recognition of title to his lands.

Early life Gookins was the youngest of ten children. In 1812 his parents William and Rhoda Gookins moved with most of their children to Rodman, New York, near the eastern end of Lake Ontario. Gookins' father died two years later. In 1823 Gookins' mother took him and an older brother west to settle about two miles outside of Terre Haute, Indiana, where other members of the family had settled three years earlier. In July 1825 Gookins' mother died, and he was sent to live first with the family of Captain Daniel Stringham (father of Admiral Silas Stringham) and later with several of his older siblings. In 1826 he was apprenticed to John Osborn, the editor of the Western Register newspaper in Terre Haute. After completing his apprenticeship in 1830, he moved to Vincennes and started a newspaper there with a partner. After a year he moved back to Terre Haute to become the editor of the Western Register, until the paper was purchased in June 1832 and replaced by the Wabash Courier. Career Gookins was about to depart for Washington, DC to pursue his editorial career when he was talked into reading for the bar by his friend Amory Kinney (one of the lawyers who had pursued the 1820 Polly v. Lasselle anti-slavery case). Gookins was admitted to the Vigo County bar in 1834 and the Indiana Supreme Court bar in 1836, and practiced until 1850, when he was appointed to a brief term as a replacement for the local circuit court judge. In 1851 Gookins was elected to the legislature, which had the job of passing new laws in the wake of a new Indiana constitution. Gookins and other lawyers proposed that each party nominate two candidates for the four member supreme court, to maintain balance, but their views were ignored in the subsequent elections. Gookins himself was nominated for an Indiana Supreme Court position by the Whigs in 1852, but their slate was defeated. Gookins ran again in 1855 for a vacant seat on the court and won.Indiana Supreme Court bio of Gookins In December 1857 Gookins resigned from the court due to ill health and financial pressures (the salary of the justices was only $1200, which Gookins considered low.)

Habitat It can be found in open woods and grasslands, but also in dry valleys and wet areas. Description Lagria hirta, female Lagria hirta can reach a length of . These beetles have a soft body and a head and thorax brown or black. The relatively elongated elytra are yellowish-brown and covered by dense fine light hairs. The rest of the body is also hairy, but they are less clearly visible. Antennae, underside of body and legs are black. The eyes are remarkably large and round. The elytra of the females are more extended backward than in the males and the female's abdomen looks from above wider than in the males. The male, in addition to its slimmer body, is distinguished from the females by their larger eyes and by the length of the last segment of the antennae, which is nearly twice the corresponding segment in the female. The fully formed beetles can be seen from late May to late July. The adult beetles feed on nectar and pollen. Females lay the eggs in the soil where they hatch after about eight days. The larvae live in the humus where they feed on decaying vegetables. After having overwintered larvae pupate in early summer of the next year and a new generation of beetles will then developed.

In 1682, Skredshol was sold by J√∏rgen Bjelke (then Deputy Governor General of Norway, a Lieutenant General in the Norwegian Army, and sheriff for Bratsberg) to his brother-in-law, Hans von L√∏wenhielm.

On the Chinese side, they form the southern parts of Nyingchi Prefecture in the Tibet Autonomous Region. These hills occur at the junction of Northeastern Himalaya and Indo-Burma ranges. The Himalayan arc takes a sharp turn and meets Indo-Burma ranges. The rocks of eastern lesser Himalaya and the central crystallines appear to be largely attenuated and truncated in Mishmi Hills. Geography Geomorphically, the Mishmi Hills are divided into 2 sections the flood plains of tributaries of Brahmaputra river and the Arunachal Himalayas consisting of snow-capped mountains, lower Himalayan ranges, and Shivalik ranges. The Hills reach heights above but have not been properly mapped. This hilly area is characterised by steeply sloping landform, sub-tropical evergreen forest and high rainfall. The central part of the Hills wrap around both sides of the Dibang Valley. The Mishmi Hills are part of Shan-Malaysia plate. In 1950, the Hills were the epicenter of a devastating earthquake. Snow capped Tops of Mishmi Hills, view from Mayodia Pass, Hunli town at the bottom left A Small Settlement on the Roing-Mayodia road Administration In India, the Mishmi Hills were declared as a district after its bifurcation of Sadiya Frontier Tract in 1948. Again in 1951, the plains area were transferred to the administrative jurisdiction of Assam. In 1952, the headquarters was shifted from Sadiya to Tezu. When the North-East Frontier Agency (NEFA) formed in 1954, Mishmi Hills District became Lohit Frontier Division. In China, the western parts of the Hills fall under the administration of M√™dog County and the eastern parts are administered by Zay√º County. Both these counties are part of Nyingchi Prefecture in the Tibet Autonomous Region. Flora and fauna The Mishmi Hills experience heavy rainfall with pre-monsoon showers from March. The humidity and rainfall is about 90%. There are about 6000 plant species, 100 mammal species and about 700 bird species. There are also a large number of butterflies and other insects. Temperate conifers, sub-alpine woody shrubs, alpine meadows, bamboos and grasslands are found in this region. Tiger, common leopard, clouded leopard, snow leopard, golden cat, jungle cat, marbled cat and the leopard cat are found. The endangered red panda is seen in the northern reaches and the hoolock gibbon is in the lower areas. A new subspecies of hoolock gibbon has been described from this area which has been named as Mishmi Hills hoolock H. h. mishmiensis.. A new giant flying squirrel named as Mishmi Hills giant flying squirrel has also been described from the region.. One of the most unusual ungulates found here is the Mishmi takin.

In 290, he was assigned as the Proconsular governor of Africa Proconsularis.Barnes, T. D., Sossianus Hierocles in Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, Volume 80 (1976), pg. 250 His governorship was transferred to the new province of Byzacena during Diocletian‚Äôs reorganization of the empire‚Äôs provinces, which saw Africa Proconsularis divided into three smaller provinces. During his time as governor, Aristobulus undertook major building activities. His tenure as governor probably ended on 1 July 294, when he was replaced by Cassius Dio. From 11 January 295 until 18 February 296, Aristobulus was the Praefectus urbi of Rome. Sources * Martindale, J. R.; Jones, A. H.

Presentation Abrupt painless loss of vision in the visual field corresponding to territory of the obstructed artery is the typical history of presentation. Patients can typically define the time and extent of visual loss precisely. Retinal whitening that corresponds to the area of ischemia is the most notable finding. In chronic phase the retinal whitening disappears. Risk factors Risk factors include: * Hypertension * Elevated lipid levels * cigarette smoking * Diabetes Diagnosis  Ancillary testing is not usually necessary to make the diagnosis. Fluorescein angiography reveals an abrupt diminution in dye at the site of the obstruction. Visual field testing can confirm the extent of visual loss. Treatment No proved treatment exists for branch retinal artery occlusion. In the rare patient who has branch retinal artery obstruction accompanied by a systemic disorder, systemic anti- coagulation may prevent further events. Epidemiology The mean age of affected patients is 60 years. The right eye is affected more commonly than the left eye which probably reflects the greater possibility of cardiac or aortic emboli traveling to the right carotid artery. Most of the cases are due to emboli to the retinal circulation. Three main types of retinal emboli have been identified: Cholesterol, calcific, and fibrin-platelet.

He is of Aitanga a Hauiti/ New Zealand Irish descent. Although he attended Ilam School of Fine Arts in Christchurch between 1973 and 1974, he is largely a self-taught artist. He now lives and works in Wellington, New Zealand. His work Although John Walsh started painting later in life, he has managed to create a name for himself on the New Zealand art scene. His first solo exhibition was the result of his appointment of curator at the National Art Gallery in Wellington (now known as Te Papa Tongarewa Museum). Since then, he continues to exhibit regularly in different galleries around New Zealand and has also had the opportunity to show his work abroad in Sydney, Australia and Noumea, New Caledonia. John Walsh started with figurative imagery, portraying people he knew around the East Coast region. His otherworldly landscapes and figures would take another few years before emerging as a constant in his paintings. In the meantime, Walsh was invited to participatein the no-longer- extant six storey Pathfinder mural, on the side of a socialist publishing house in New York in 1989, then moved on to work in a number of different institutions. It was when Walsh was invited to work as a curator in Wellington that he developed a theme for his paintings. Walsh works on medium to large scale boards achieving textural effects through scratches and expressive gestural brushwork. His work evokes mythical creatures and vistas which eludes the concept of a specific location and time. The recent exhibition I Can't Stop Loving You held at Gow Langsford Gallery retain the style of his earlier works while also demonstrating a new direction in the artist‚Äôs career. While a sense of the ethereal remains through the use of similar hues and tones, the artist‚Äôs interest shifts towards grand vistas rather than focussing on the mythical figures. However, one expects to see his otherworldly figures appear in the landscape at any given time.

He is known for his efforts to protect the Wehea Forest.  Background  Ledjie Taq was born in the Wehea Dayak village of Nehas Liah Bing, on the Wehea River. He works as an elementary school teacher and farmer and became the elected leader (kepala adat) of the Wehea Dayak in 2002. Since this time he has been working to protect the Wehea Forest.  Protecting Wehea Forest  In 2004, the Wehea Dayak community of Nehas Liah Bing (Nehas) feared their forest would be lost forever. In response to this threat, the community banded together and declared the Wehea Forest a ‚Äúlocally protected forest‚Äù. The man leading this conservation effort is the 61-year-old Ledjie Taq, the tribal leader of the Wehea Dayak of East Kalimantan. In recognition of conservation efforts, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono of Indonesia awarded Ledjie Taq the prestigious Bintang Jasa Pratama medal in 2009.http://api.ning.com/files/O8wkMTv7QGXg3rmhYgGdLBCMrMVOZLKjfus05qUrZne5PQPzx2eqQJ- QvrRpvx0koIW*l6WSPQi1inBuBy*qfyav5Gxqwxf0/BorneosLastStand.pdf In addition, Ledjie Taq won the Kalpataru Environment Savior Award, Indonesia's highest environmental honor. Ledjie Taq gathered multi-lateral support for protecting Wehea Forest through a customary council meeting held in November 2004. Representatives from local Dayak communities, the local government and private sector attended this council meeting and agreed to support the declaration of 38,000 hectares of an abandoned timber concession as ‚Äòprotected land‚Äô under Wehea Dayak traditional 'adat‚Äô law. The newly established protected area was given the local name Keldung Laas Wehea Long Skung Metqueen (The Wehea protected forest located between the rivers of Skung and Metqueen). Ledjie Taq and the Wehea Dayak community wanted to protect Wehea Forest because of its importance as a source for water and medicinal plants, as well as non-timber forest products. In addition, Ledjie Taq knew that protecting Wehea Forest was critical for helping to protect the Wehea Dayak culture. As cultural head of the Wehea Dayak, Ledjie Taq knew that if the forest around Wehea was lost, important traditions and ceremonies would be lost as well. Since Wehea Forest lies within the historical territory of the Wehea Dayak, Ledjie Taq knew that protecting Wehea Forest under adat law was also important for recovering some of the Wehea Dayak traditional land rights. To guard the newly protected forest from illegal activities, Ledjie Taq used traditional Wehea Dayak practices for conservation and established the Petkuq Mehuey (PM‚Äôs), or forest guardians. He felt by merging traditional practices into the forest conservation program, the Wehea Dayak could also sustain and protect local traditions and culture. The PM‚Äôs are a group of young people from the local community who protect the forest. They spend up to three months in the forest patrolling the borders for illegal loggers, collecting data on the flora and fauna found in Wehea Forest, and helping to implement new programs and initiatives.

He is also known for his role as publisher, editor, journalist, social and cultural reformer and promoter of Mithila culture. He authored about forty books in Maithili and was also the Editor of various publications and books in Maithili, Sanskrit and Hindi. He served the Governing Bodies of various literary and academic institutions in different capacities in his State. He was also the recipient of Sahitya Akademy Award in 1971 for Payaswini and in 1995 for Translation Rabindra Natakavali Vol. I. He was born in a village known as Ballipur in the Samastipur district of Bihar. Early life and family Surendra Jha 'Suman' was born on 10 October 1910 in Ballipur Village of District Samastipur, Bihar. His father Bhubaneswar Jha was a well known Ayurvedic practitioner. Traditionally the family belonged to Sanskrit scholars. He was educated at Dharmaraj Sanskrit College, Muzaffarpur and was a graduate in literature (Sahityacharya) and was also a Kavyatirtha (Bengal). He was married to Ganga Devi a native of Begusarai at the age of 25 years. He has one son Brajendra Jha, and two daughters. He retired as a professor and HOD, Maithili Language in LNMU University Darbhanga, Bihar. He was elected a member of parliament from Darbhanga Lok Sabha Constituency on Janata Party ticket for the 6th Lok Sabha. Work and contributions As a writer, both in the realm of prose and poetry, He had a superb command over several languages and this qualification brought him a reward from the then President of India, Dr. Rajendra Prasad. Besides the Sahitya Akademi award, in 1981 Maithili Akademi, Patna Awarded him Vidyapati Puraskar. He was the Maithili representative in Sahitya Akademi and a member of its Maithili advisory board. He was president of All India Maithili Sahitya Parishad. He was associated with Vaidehi Samiti Darbhanga also. He occupies a very prominent place in the modern Maithili literature. His choice of words, alliterations, metaphor and similes, use of prosody and description of seasons, have been unique in modern Maithili literature. His Payasvini (1969), a collection of 25 poems about beauty of nature, colourful imagery and simplicity of rural life has won for him the Sahitya Akademi award for 1971. In this one can find metrical experiment to metaphor. Payasvini is based on the idea of comparing poetry with a milch cow, as described in the Prithvisukta of Atharvaved and Brihadaranyakopnishad, where Vakdhenu has been described in Vth chapter VIIIth Brahman. Here Pavas (Rainy Season) is as good asTamasi, Mrityunjaya and milch cow and the river has been compared with rasvanti (charming succulent woman), vanita (woman) and kavita (poetry). The mountain has been compared with an old man, a youth and a child. Sumanji's poetry Dattavati (1962) describes the Sino-Indian War and contains patriotic fervour as in Bharat vandana (1970) and Antarnad (1970). His Uttara (1980) is a Khandakavya (miniepic) the story has been taken from the Mahabharat it doesn't focuses the compactness of the character of Uttara only. In fact his style and verve of poetry is loaded with Sanskrit words, simile, Alankar and imagery of old Sanskrit poetry hence at times not relished by modern readers, not much acquainted with Sanskrit prosody. His publications include Pratipada (1948). The very name suggests the new start, a new direction in Maithili poetry. Its introduction and dedication is also in poems. All the other 16 poems were composed before India achieved independence. It expresses suffocation felt by the poet under foreign rule. Similarly Kavitak Ahvan shows poetic inspiration and patriotic fervour. Samsan shows philosophical reflection on the cremation ground. The favourite topics of Sanskrit poets are treated with new imagery in Asadhasya pratham divase, Yamuna, Asuryampasya and Sharad. Similarly, the poet exalts the feelings of 'Haldhar' (ploughman) of today, higher than Balaram and Janaka of the Yore days of Dvapara Yuga and Treta Yuga. His 'Ode to Tree' can favourably be compared with anyone of the best lyrics of any literature. Here he compares and admires the services, dedication and sacrifices of 'Tree' to mankind and associates them with those of an ascetic. Yugnirman visualises the future and Uktipratyukti reaches out to the heart of the down trodden. All these poems have since been collected in his anthologies of poems 'Pratipada'which is a landmark in modern Maithili. His other collections of poetry areSaon-Bhado (1965), Archana (1961), Kathayuthika (1976) and many others. His Lalana Lahari (1969) is a vivid description of the peculiar characteristics of love making by girls of different provinces of India His song in praise of the Ganga in Gangavtaran (1967) has been termed superb. He has made himself memorable by writing on a number of topics. With his steadfast adherence to classical poise and dignity has produced literature of permanent value. His excellent poetic qualities can be seen in the following lines: > The jungles on all sides are thick with the smell of Bakul flower; the > Ketaki flower has filled the wind and made it dense. In every home the she- > peacock is dancing; Everybody's eyes feast upon the dark clouds (meaning > also Lord Krishna), but it is in my home alone where the flame of love > remains unquenched. This is the young lady of Alaka agonised on account of unrequited love. (A Survey of Maithili Literature-R.K.Choudhary Pp. 199) As a translator into Maithili he has chosen both poetry and prose. Mainly he translated from Bengali and Sanskrit. His translations from Bengali are: * Sarat Chandra's Baradidi (Barakidai) * Rabindranath Tagore's Gitanjali (1969) * and Rabindra Nibandhabali(1994) ;From Sanskrit * Puruspariksha of Vidyapati * Vedic hymns (Richalok, 1970) * Sankaracharya's Anand Lahari (1969) * and Saundarya Lahari (1972) * Durgasaptasati (Chandicharya, 1950) * Shivamahimna Strotra (1969) * Kalidas's Raghuvamsa (1970) and Ritusamhar * Sringar Tilak (1969) * Hitopdesika * PutroahamPrithvyah (1964) * Shaktistavak (1969) * Harismaranika (1970) * Prachetas Rajashastram (1993) =Fiction writing= Surendra Jha 'Suman' also ventured into fiction writing. In fact one of his short stories 'Brihaspatik Shes' (The inauspicious afternoon of Thursday) has been quite popular. He published his first anthology of short stories Kathamukhi. His novel 'Uganak Diyadvad ' deals with the Khavas (bonded labour) system of feudalistic society and the changes occurring in society in the light of modernity. =Mithila Press= His contribution as a journalist, editor and publisher is remarkable which started with setting up of Mithila Press in 1948, dedicated to his quest of spreading awareness of Maithili language, culture and literature. It is still functioning under his son as Mithila Press Publications. He edited erstwhile edition of the Mithila Mihir (Old edition). His calibre as an editor can be seen in the Mithilank of Mithila Mihir published in 1935.He has also edited: ‚Äì Swadesh first a monthly and then a daily. He has the credit to bring out first daily in Maithil, for which he suffered a heavy loss, spent his provident fund and devoted time and labour to publish this daily newspaper. He successfully edited Prachi, a periodical published by Sahitya Akademi, regional office, Kolkata. It consisted of English translation of literature published in eastern India, namely, Assamese, Bengali, Maithili, Meitei, Nepali and Oriya.

Double ionization is usually less probable than single-electron ionization. Two types of double ionization are distinguished: sequential and non-sequential. Sequential double ionization Sequential double ionization is a process of formation of doubly charged ions consisting of two single-electron ionization events: the first electron is removed from a neutral atom/molecule (leaving a singly charged ion in the ground state or an excited state) followed by detachment of the second electron from the ion. , chapter 8. Non-sequential double ionization Non-sequential double ionization is a process whose mechanism differs (in any detail) from the sequential one. For example, both the electrons leave the system simultaneously (as in alkaline earth atoms, see below), the second electron's liberation is assisted by the first electron (as in noble gas atoms, see below), etc. The phenomenon of non-sequential double ionization was experimentally discovered by Suran and Zapesochny for alkaline earth atoms as early as 1975. Despite extensive studies, the details of double ionization in alkaline earth atoms remain unknown. It is supposed that double ionization in this case is realized by transitions of both the electrons through the spectrum of autoionizing atomic states, located between the first and second ionization potentials. Non-sequential double ionization in alkaline earth atoms For noble gas atoms, non-sequential double ionization was first observed by L'Huillier. The interest to this phenomenon grew rapidly after it was rediscovered in infrared fields and for higher intensities. Multiple ionization has also been observed. The mechanism of non-sequential double ionization in noble gas atoms differs from the one in alkaline earth atoms. For noble gas atoms in infrared laser fields, following one-electron ionization, the liberated electron can recollide with the parent ion. This electron acts as an \\"atomic antenna\\", absorbing the energy from the laser field between ionization and recollision and depositing it into the parent ion. Inelastic scattering on the parent ion results in further collisional excitation and/or ionization. This mechanism is known as the three-step model of non-sequential double ionization, which is also closely related to the three step model of high harmonic generation. Dynamics of double ionization within the three-step model strongly depends on the laser field intensity. The maximum energy (in atomic units) gained by the recolliding electron from the laser field is \\\\sim 3.2 U_p, where U_p=\\\\frac{F^2}{4\\\\omega^2} is the ponderomotive energy, F is the laser field strength, and \\\\omega is the laser frequency. Even when 3.2 U_p is far below ionization potential I_p experiments have observed correlated ionization. As opposed to the high-U_p regime (3.2 U_p > I_p) in the low-U_p regime (3.2 U_p < I_p) the assistance of the laser field during the recollision is vital. Classical and quantum analysis of the low-U_p regime demonstrates the following two ways of electron ejection after the recollision: First, the two electrons can be freed with little time delay compared to the quarter-cycle of the driving laser field. Second, the time delay between the ejection of the first and the second electron is of the order of the quarter-cycle of the driving field. In these two cases, the electrons appear in different quadrants of the correlated spectrum. If following the recollision, the electrons are ejected nearly simultaneously, their parallel momenta have equal signs, and both electrons are driven by the laser field in the same direction toward the detector . If after the recollision, the electrons are ejected with a substantial delay (quarter-cycle or more), they end up going in the opposite directions. These two types of dynamics produce distinctly different correlated spectra (compare experimental results with .

After graduating from Carmen Bozello de Huyke High School, she attended the Mayag√ºez Campus of the University of Puerto Rico where she earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry. After teaching to middle and high school students for a year and a half, Sierra-Sastre participated in a summer research experience program for teachers at Stanford University, where she was first introduced to nanotechnology research. During that time, she was trained in the self-assembly of mono-molecular films. Upon returning to Puerto Rico, she enrolled in graduate Environmental Health courses at the School of Public Health at the University of Puerto Rico Medical Science Campus and graduate Chemistry courses at the University of Puerto Rico at R√≠o Piedras. Sierra- Sastre then attended Cornell University, where she earned a Ph.D. in 2009 in Nanomaterials Chemistry and specialized in the bionanofabrication of semiconductor nanowires.\\"La Borinque√±a‚Äô m√°s peque√±a\\"; El Nuevo Dia As part of her doctoral studies, Sierra-Sastre researched at Los Alamos National Laboratory..

In 2013, the NASA Human Research Program funded a project called \\"HI-SEAS,\\" an acronym for ‚ÄúHawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation,‚Äù to determine the best way to keep astronauts well nourished during multiple-year missions to Mars or the moon. A planetary module was built on the Hawaiian island of Mauna Loa, which simulates the living conditions for astronauts at a future base on Mars. It is believed that the saddle area side of the island resembles a Martian environment. After receiving more than 700 applications for positions as crew members of the simulated Mars mission, NASA and researchers from Cornell University and the University of Hawaii at MƒÅnoa chose six astronaut- like individuals. Sierra-Sastre was part of the selected crew with qualifications similar to those required by NASA for their astronaut applicants. The other five are Dr. Oleg Abramov, Simon Engler, Kate Greene, Dr. Sian Proctor and Dr. Angelo Vermeulen. Three additional individuals made up the reserve crew. Prior to the four-month mission, which began on March 2013, the crew participated in a two-week training session. Once the mission began the crew was not allowed to have any communication with the outside world, except for limited e-mail, and simulated space suits were required if they stepped outside the module. During the mission they tested new forms of food and food preparation strategies for deep-space travel. Sierra-Sastre also researched pre-market anti-microbial fabrics and how long they lasted, which is important given the limited water availability on a space mission. Members of the crew were given items such as shirts, bedsheets, and socks, and were asked to fill out surveys rating qualitative factors like odor, comfort, and appearance. Samples were also taken from the fabrics after use to measure the microbial growth.. Research teams from Johnson Space Center also provided exercise and sleep clothing for testing during the mission, in preparation for an International Space Station technology demonstration in 2014.https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20140006532.pdf Sierra-Sastre and her colleagues emerged from the space habitat on August 13, ending the four-month simulated mission.

He became a canon of the cathedral chapter of the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in 1496. He also became a canon of the chapter of the cathedral at Tui, Pontevedra. He was the last abbot of the monastery of Santa Marta in Astorga. He took orders as a deacon and was a perpetual beneficiary of the parish church of Fuentes de Duero. He went on to serve as a chaplain to the Catholic Monarchs. Under Charles I of Spain, he was made the king's almoner and sacristan major of his chapel. On March 4, 1523, he was elected bishop of Tui, though he never visited the diocese, governing through officers. On October 26, 1524, he was transferred to the see of Badajoz, and then on July 3, 1525 to the see of Palencia, taking possession of that diocese on August 18, 1527. He was a witness at the signing of the Treaty of Madrid (1526) which freed Francis I of France. He accompanied Charles I of Spain, who was now Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, in the emperor's trips to Flanders, Italy, and Germany. He was present at the imperial coronation in Bologna on February 24, 1530. On June 8, 1534, he was promoted to the metropolitan see of Santiago de Compostela, taking possession of the archdiocese on June 10, 1536. He accompanied the emperor to Italy again in 1538. At the request of the emperor and the emperor's daughter Margaret of Parma (who married Pope Paul III's grandson Ottavio Farnese, Duke of Parma on November 4, 1538), the pope created Sarmiento a cardinal priest in the consistory of October 18, 1538. He received the red hat and the titular church of Santi Apostoli on November 15, 1538. On January 28, 1541, he became the administrator of the see of Anagni, though he quickly resigned that administration on April 6, 1541. He died in Lucca on October 13, 1541. He was initially buried in the Dominican monastery in Anagni. His relative Juan Sarmiento, abbot of Benevivere in Palencia, later had his remains transferred to the abbey of Benevivere.

In 2016 the Harvey Prize from the Technion in Israel was awarded to Deisseroth and Hegemann \\"for their discovery of opsin molecules, involved in sensing light in microorganisms, and their pioneering work in utilizing these opsins to develop optogenetics\\". Deisseroth was then awarded Japan's highest private prize, the Kyoto Prize, in 2018 for \\"his discovery of optogenetics and the development of causal systems neuroscience\\", becoming the youngest recipient of the award to date. In 2019, Deisseroth, Hegemann, Boyden, and Miesenb√∂ck won the Warren Alpert Foundation Prize. Finally in 2020 Deisseroth received the Heineken Prize from the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, \\"for developing optogenetics ‚Äî a method to influence the activity of nerve cells with light\\". Deisseroth is also known for achieving insight into the light-gated ion channel pore of channelrhodopsin itself, through his teams‚Äô initial high-resolution crystal structures of cation and anion- conducting channelrhodopsins and through a body of structure/function work discovering mechanisms of channelrhodopsin kinetics, ion selectivity, and color selectivity together with his frequent collaborator Peter Hegemann, reviewed in. Two major prizes paid particular attention to Deisseroth‚Äôs work on elucidation of the structure and function of light-gated ion channels (the 2016 Harvey Prize to Deisseroth and Hegemann for the ‚Äúdiscovery of opsin molecules, involved in sensing light in microorganisms, and for the pioneering work in utilizing these opsins to develop optogenetics‚Äù, and the 2018 Gairdner Award, which noted ‚Äúhis group discovered the fundamental principles of the unique channelrhodopsin proteins in molecular detail by a wide range of genomic, biophysical, electrophysiological and structural techniques with many mutants in close collaboration with Peter Hegemann‚Äù). Deisseroth‚Äôs lab also achieved single-cell optogenetic control in living animals through a combination of optogenetics and high-resolution light guidance methods, including in behaving mammals. Although the first peer-reviewed paper demonstrating activation of neurons with a channelrhodopsin was from his lab in mid-2005, Deisseroth has emphasized that many ‚Äúpioneering laboratories around the world‚Äù were also working on the idea and published their papers within the following year; he cites Stefan Herlitze and Alexander Gottschalk/Georg Nagel who published their papers in late 2005, and Hiromu Yawo and Zhuo-Hua Pan who published their initial papers in 2006 (Pan‚Äôs initial observation of optical activation of retinal neurons expressing channelrhodopsin would have occurred in August 2004 according to Pan, about a month after Deisseroth‚Äôs initial observation (Deisseroth has published the notebook pages from early July 2004 of his initial experiment showing light activation of neurons expressing a channelrhodopsin). Interestingly, Deisseroth also pointed out that an even earlier experiment had occurred and was published from Heberle and B√ºldt in 1994, in which functional heterologous expression of a bacteriorhodopsin for light-activated ion flow had been published in a non-neural system (yeast). Optogenetics with microbial opsins as a general technology for neuroscience was enabled only by the full development of versatile strategies for targeting opsins and light to specific cells in behaving animals. The majority (~300 papers ) of Deisseroth‚Äôs publications have been focused on application of his methods to elucidate how mammalian survival-related behaviors like thirst and anxiety, whether adaptive or maladaptive, arise from the activity of specific cells and connections in neural circuitry. Several awards have specifically noted Deisseroth‚Äôs neuroscience discoveries in this way, separate from his contributions to channelrhodopsin structure or optogenetics. Deisseroth‚Äôs 2018 Kyoto Prize cited his \\"causal systems neuroscience\\", the 2013 Pasarow Prize was awarded to Deisseroth for \\"neuropsychiatry research\\" , the 2013 Premio Citta di Firenze (the City of Florence prize; other recipients have included Ada Yonath and Emmanuelle Charpentier) was given to Deisseroth for \\"innovative technologies to probe the structure and dynamics of circuits related to schizophrenia, autism, narcolepsy, Parkinson's disease, depression, anxiety and addiction\\", the Redelsheimer Award from the Society for Biological Psychiatry was awarded to Deisseroth for \\"furthering the field's understanding of the neuroscience underlying behavior\\", and Deisseroth‚Äôs 2017 Fresenius Prize cited \\"his discoveries in optogenetics and hydrogel-tissue chemistry, as well as his research into the neural circuit basis of depression\\". Chemical assembly of functional materials in tissue Deisseroth is known also for a separate class of technological innovation. His group has developed methods for chemical assembly of functional materials within biological tissue. This approach has a range of applications, including probing the molecular composition and wiring of cells within intact brains. The first step in this direction was hydrogel-tissue chemistry (HTC) in which \\"specific classes of native biomolecules in tissue are immobilized or covalently anchored (for example, through individualized interface molecules to gel monomer molecules)\\". Then, \\"precisely timed polymerization causing tissue-gel hybrid formation is triggered within all the cells across the tissue in an ordered and controlled process to ultimately create an optically and chemically accessible biomolecular matrix\\". In 2013, Deisseroth was senior author of a paper describing the initial form of this method, called CLARITY (with a team including first author postdoctoral fellow in his lab Kwanghun Chung,Deisseroth KA, Chung K. 2015. Methods and compositions for preparing biological specimens for microscopic analysis. www.google.com/patents/US20150144490. Filing date: 13 March 2013. US Patent Appl.

Filing date: 26 January 2012. US Patent Appl. No. US20140030192. this method makes biological tissues such as mammalian brains translucent and accessible to molecular probes.\\"Brains as Clear as Jell-O for Scientists to Explore\\", 10 April 2013 The New York Times CLARITY has been widely used and many variants on the basic HTC backbone have been developed in other labs as well since 2013 (reviewed in ). A key feature of HTC is that the hydrogel-tissue hybrid ‚Äúbecomes the substrate for future chemical and optical interrogation that can be probed and manipulated in new ways‚Äù. For example, HTC variants now enable improved anchoring and amplification of RNA, reversible size changes (contraction or expansion), and in situ sequencing (reviewed in ). In particular, STARmap is an HTC variant that allows three-dimensional cellular-resolution transcriptomic readouts within intact tissue ). Several major prizes have cited Deisseroth‚Äôs development of HTC, including 1) the 2017 Fresenius Prize ‚Äúfor his discoveries in optogenetics and hydrogel-tissue chemistry, as well as his research into the neural circuit basis of depression‚Äù; 2) The 2015 Lurie Prize in Biomedical Sciences ‚Äúfor leading the development of optogenetics, a technology for controlling cells with light to determine function as well as for CLARITY, a method for transforming intact organs into transparent polymer gels to allow visualization of biological structures with high resolution and detail‚Äù ); 3) the 2013 Premio Citta di Firenze ); 4) the Redelsheimer Award for ‚Äúoptogenetics, CLARITY, and other novel and powerful neural circuit approaches in furthering the field's understanding of the neuroscience underlying behavior‚Äù ); 5) the 2015 Dickson Prize in Medicine ); and 6) the 2020 Heineken Prize for Medicine, for \\"developing optogenetics ‚Äî a method to influence the activity of nerve cells with light ‚Äî as well as for developing hydrogel-tissue chemistry, which enables researchers to make biological tissue accessible to light and molecular probes.\\" In 2020 Deisseroth and Zhenan Bao described another chemical synthesis of functional material in situ, this time with cell-specific chemistry. Their genetically-targeted chemical assembly (GTCA) method instructs specific living cells to guide chemical synthesis of functional materials. The initial GTCA created electrically functional (conductive or insulating) polymers at the plasma membrane, and the team noted ‚ÄúDistinct strategies for the targeting and triggering of chemical synthesis could extend beyond the oxidative radical initiation shown here while building on the core principle of assembling within cells (as reaction compartments) genetically and anatomically targeted reactants (such as monomers), catalysts (such as enzymes or surfaces), or reaction conditions (through modulators of pH, light, heat, redox potential, electrochemical potential, and other chemical or energetic signals).‚Äù In 2019 Deisseroth was elected to the US National Academy of Engineering, completing membership in all three US National Academies (Medicine, Sciences, and Engineering).

Cameron was talking with a lieutenant from Company J of the regiment when a bullet hit him in the chest. He collapsed and died of massive bleeding in a matter of moments. The body was taken to an ambulance wagon, but the driver protested that it was needed for the wounded. After being told of the dead man's identity, the driver relented and allowed it to be placed there. However, the ambulance wagons were quickly captured by the Confederates, who then commandeered them for their own wounded.The Fallen Brave p. 78 Thus, Colonel James Cameron, brother of U.S. Secretary of War Simon Cameron, was killed during the first major battle of the Civil War, the First Battle of Bull Run.Hannings, Bud.

Simon Cameron had been among the crowd of spectators who came out from Washington, D.C. to witness the battle.Davis, 1977, p. 153. From the earliest reports after the battle, a story emerged that Wade Hampton himself had targeted officers of the 79th New York Infantry, mistaking it for the 69th New York Infantry, one of whom had killed his nephew early in the battle, and that Hampton killed Colonel Cameron with his second or a later shot at him.Moore, ed., Frank.

Following Colonel Cameron's death, after some hesitancy about firing on men who might be part of the Union force, the 79th New York Infantry was hit with another volley which caused the remaining men in the decimated force to retreat. The 79th New York Infantry \\"Highlanders\\" had sustained casualties of 32 killed, 51 wounded and 115 missing. Hampton's Legion and the 5th Virginia Infantry fought off attacks by four Union regiments, including the 79th New York Infantry, within forty minutes. Confederate Colonel Wade Hampton sustained slight head and ankle wounds during the charge of the 79th New York Infantry and while lying near the Henry House, tried to direct his men through messages carried by staff officers. Hampton's stand allowed Stonewall Jackson's brigade to have enough time to reach that critical spot on the battlefield.  Aftermath  Cameron's body was thus left on the field. Attempts to retrieve it from the Confederate lines under a flag of truce were unsuccessful; a letter addressed to Confederate army headquarters asking for its return was rejected due to objections over the wording of the letter; it was addressed \\"To whom it may concern.\\" and the Confederate authorities replied back that the retrieval of Cameron's body was not a matter that concerned them, and they would not accept unless the letter was properly addressed.Duyckinck, 1861, p. 409. The body was not retrieved until the Confederate army withdrew from the Manassas area in March 1862. A party led by Cameron's adjutant at the battle, Sgt. John Kane, found a slave who had helped bury the dead on the battlefield. He testified that Cameron's body had lain unburied in the hot summer weather for a few days prior to being placed in a common grave with other Union dead, and that he had made a mental note of where it was buried after hearing that a reward was being offered for its recovery. Upon digging in the spot that the slave had pointed out, they found Cameron along with the remains of several enlisted men. The body was identified by its clothing and a hernia truss that the colonel had been wearing. Cameron's personal effects and $80 in cash he had been carrying were missing, the slave said that Confederate cavalrymen had looted of the body of anything valuable. After carefully removing Cameron's remains, they were taken back to Washington and eventually interred in the Lewisburg Cemetery in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania.  Notes   References  * Blanchard, Charles.

It is located south of Broome and from the state capital Perth, in the Kimberley Region. The traditional owners of the land are the Karajarri people, but is also home to the several other language groups. Started as a government rations distribution point by the government in 1903, La Grange became a mission station run by German Pallotine missionaries in 1955, before the formation of Bidyadanga Aboriginal Community La Grange (BACLG) in 1975, and subsequent independence from the mission in 1982. Community It is the largest Aboriginal community in the state and supports a population of approximately 750 people.Government of Western Australia (October 2008). Bidyadanga Community Layout Plan Number 2 The community has been involved in publications of local stories. =Governance= The Bidyadanga Aboriginal Community La Grange (BACLG) was incorporated in 1975 as a not-for-profit organisation to administer government-funded programs. It was incorporated under the Aboriginal Communities Act 1979 (WA). =Town planning= Bidyadanga Layout Plan No.3 was prepared in accordance with WA State Planning Policy 3.2 (Aboriginal Settlements). It was endorsed by the community on 15 November 2012 and the Western Australian Planning Commission (WAPC) on 28 May 2013. History =Early years= Located on Thangoo Station south of Broome, La Grange had been a government rations distribution post for Karajarri and Ngungamada people. Being in the pearling region, there was much contact between Asian pearling crews and local Aboriginal women. In 1903 and a constable and tracker were stationed there. The WA administration prevented the local Salesians from establishing a mission there. During World War II, German Pallottines made enquiries, but Germans were not allowed on the coast by the Australian Army. In late 1948, desert people from Udialla were moved there by the government, and plans for a children's institution were mooted. In the 1950s, after two lay missionaries had started a school, Frankfurt anthropologists Helmut Petri and his wife Dr Gisela Odermann began to conduct fieldwork at La Grange. In January 1956 the Pallottines, presided over by Fr. H√ºgel, took charge of the mission, and dormitories, a dining hall, hospital and other buildings were built. Other missionaries joined them, and prayers, a collection of Bible stories, and an outline of kinship terms were published in the local languages. It was considered an \\"enlightened\\" mission. In 1964 the mission was devastated by Cyclone Bessie, which destroyed the school, the hospital and all of the huts. The mission was financed and rebuilt by a combination of various Catholic funds and the Department of Native Affairs. By 1981 there were about 400 persons living at La Grange. In 1982 the community asked for independence from the mission, and after the 1983 Seaman Aboriginal Land inquiry, the Bidyadanga Aboriginal Community asked for the mission land to be transferred to them. =Native title= In 2002 and 2004 the Karajarri had their native title rights and interests recognised, over ‚Äì about half the size of Tasmania ‚Äì in the West Kimberley. On 12 December 2002 the case known as \\"John Dudu Nangkiriny & Others on behalf of the Karajarri People v The State of Western Australia & Others\\", or \\"Karajarri People (Area A)\\" (ref. WCD2002/001) determined that native title exists in the entire area. The claim to Area B was finalised on 8 September 2004, with \\"Nangkiriny v State of Western Australia [2004], FCA 1156\\", when it was determined that native title existed in parts of Area B only, giving the Karajarri non-exclusive native title rights over the land and waters in this area.

His Epistle to the Sorrowful Lament upon the Destruction of the Kingdom of Hungary by the Tatars is an important source of the Mongol invasion of the Kingdom of Hungary in 1241 and 1242.

Although he received the prebend of a chaplainship, and later of the archdeacon in the cathedral chapterCurta 2006, p. 410. of the Diocese of V√°rad (today Oradea, Romania) in the kingdom, he was in the company of Cardinal Giacomo in Italy between 1236 and 1239.

Sorrowful Lament Master Roger appeared to have stayed in V√°rad when the town was captured by the Mongols, who had invaded the kingdom from the east. He fled from the town, \\"ran away into the forest and hid there as long as\\"Master Roger's Epistle (ch. 34.), p. 199. he could. Next, Master Roger arrived in Csan√°d, but it had also been devastated by the invaders. He was soon captured by the Mongols, but managed to escape as the invaders were withdrawing from Hungary in 1242. He went to Rome, where he received the post of archdeacon of Sopron in the western part of the Kingdom of Hungary, V√°rad having been completely destroyed by the Mongols. He took over his new post in 1243, and set about recording his experiences during the Mongol invasion in a letter written to Cardinal Giacomo. His letter provides a \\"dramatic description of the events\\" (Florin Curta) leading to the destruction of the kingdom. Following the death of Cardinal Giacomo in 1244, Master Roger was employed by Cardinal John of Toledo.Introduction to Master Roger's Epistle (2010), p. xliii-xliv.

Archbishop of Split Master Roger was appointed archbishop of Split by Pope Innocent IV after the death of Archbishop Ugrin, who had died on April 30, 1249. It seems that both the canons of the cathedral chapter and the locals would have preferred a Dominican friar named John. Finally, King B√©la IV of Hungary, the supreme lord of the town, approved the appointment of Roger, who arrived in his seat in February 1250. During his more than fifteen years in the archbishopric, he was involved from time to time in conflicts both with his flock and with the monarch. In his last years, Archbishop Roger suffered from gout that also paralyzed him. He was buried in the Cathedral of Saint Domnius.

A part of the mountain above the countless mines gave way and buried about 300 people. A definite number will never be known, since there are no records about the number of people living or working in Nambija. Location and slide The Nambija mining settlement is located in the southeastern part of Ecuador, high up in the mountains, in Zamora-Chinchipe Province, about 30 km east of Zamora, close to the Peruvian border. It can only be reached after a three-hour drive over a rough gravel road, which was only built in 1986. The town itself is situated in a valley, 2600m above sea level, built on the steep slopes of the mountains. Most of the houses are built right on the tunnel entrances to the mines, made from corrugated iron and tin. The mountains are riddled with adits and holes. The air is damp and full of toxic fumes from the mining process, making Nambija one of the most inhospitable places on earth. Torrential rains during the days before the disaster, softening the soil even more, made things worse. Nambija has the title of being \\"The World's Most Dangerous Gold Town\\". This is due to the fact that violence and crime rate were very high, understandably, if you consider 10.000 people living on a patch of land about 1 square km in size. Working and living conditions played a role in this title, too. Every family had their own mine, mine shafts were hitting other mines, even basic principles of static went unobserved. Thus, the mountains around Nambija were virtually hollow by 1990, and experts warned that further mining would drastically increase the probability of a landslide. Also, the vibrations from the huge rock crushing plant in the center of the town were a cause for fear. Then, on the afternoon of May 9, 1993, Mother's Day, a large part of the mountain at the end of the valley, above the mines and part of the town, collapsed. About 80 homes were destroyed, with an estimated 200-250 people living in them. (The link to the Houston Chronicle which used to be here is dead and was thus removed) A lot of the homes doubled as entrance shacks to the mines, and people working in there were buried. Rescue operations were difficult, since the site is so hard to reach. For the people there though, the disaster is just a part of their daily life. In the unaffected parts of the settlement, mining went on. Casualties A reliable number of casualties is nowhere to be found, and probably never will. Early estimates told of about 80 people being killed, later numbers went as high as 400. The location of the slide, clearly visible even today, is an official graveyard, and many of the people buried in the disaster still lie under the mountain. Since no one knows the number of people living and working in Nambija at any given time, an accurate account of the people killed is impossible. Still, apart from the catastrophic living and working conditions, the events of this single day represent one of the worst mining disasters ever, and remain virtually unknown due to the remoteness of the site.

Members of this order are known as feather stars and mostly do not have a stalk as adults. The oral surface with the mouth is facing upwards and is surrounded by five, often divided rays with feathery pinnules. Comatulids live on the seabed and on reefs in tropical and temperate waters. Taxonomy Bourgueticrinida, the sea lilies, has traditionally been viewed as an order of Articulata and a sister taxon to Comatulida. A study published in 2011 suggested that it should be renamed Bourgueticrinina and viewed as a suborder of Comatulida.Hess, H; Messing, C. G. (2011) Comatulida. In: Hess H, Messing CG, Ausich WI. Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology, Part T, Echinodermata 2 Revised, 1633 Crinoidea, vol. 3. University of Kansas Press, Lawrence, Kansas, pp. 70‚Äì146. Characteristics Comaster schlegelii from East Timor Like other echinoderms, comatulids have pentamerous symmetry as adults though the larvae have bilateral symmetry. Late in their development, the larvae are attached to the seabed by a stalk, but this is broken at metamorphosis and the juvenile crinoid is free living. The body has an endoskeleton made from a number of articulated calcareous plates known as ossicles covered by a thin epidermis. It is in the shape of a cup (the calyx) with a lid (the tegmen) which has a central mouth and an anus near the edge, the gut being U-shaped. There is a ring of clawlike appendages (the cirri) near the base of the aboral underside; these grip the substrate to keep the feather star in place. There are five long, often branched, rays attached round the edge of the tegmen. Each of these is further subdivided into branchlets (the pinnules). Most comatulids originally have 10 arms, each ray being subdivided once. The arms are fragile, and if one is broken off, at least two grow in its place; in this way the number of arms can increase. The arms are composed of articulating ossicles held together by ligaments, and the pinnules have a similar structure. The arms are very flexible and can be spread widely or coiled up. An ambulacral groove starts on each pinnule and joins with others to form grooves on the arms all leading to grooves on the tegmen ending at the mouth. These food- collecting grooves are overhung by calcareous plates (the lappets) and have a lining of fine cilia. Behaviour Comatula pinnata, a fossil crinoid from the Solnhofen limestone Many comatulids live in crevices, under corals or inside sponges, the only visible part being some of the arms. Some come out at night and perch themselves on eminences to feed. Many species can locomote across the seabed, raising their body on their arms. Many can also swim with their arms but most are largely sedentary, seldom moving far from their chosen place of concealment. Feeding Comatulids are suspension feeders. The arms are extended and held in such a position as to maximise the feeding surface with regard to the current. At each junction of the ossicles in the pinnules there are a group of three suckerless tube feet. The longest of these searches for plankton in the surrounding water. When a particle is found, it is gathered in and thrust into the ambulacral groove by all three tube feet. Here it is formed into a bolus with mucus and moved down to the mouth by the actions of the cilia, being retained in the groove by the lappets. Reproduction Comatulids are dioecious, each individual being either male or female. The gametes are produced in specialised pinnules at the base of the arms, and fertilisation is external. The larvae are planktonic and drift with the water flow. After several larval stages they settle on the seabed and anchor themselves with a stalk. At metamorphosis, the stalk breaks and the juveniles can move around. Ecology Comatulids consist of 80% calcium carbonate and are unappetising to most predators. A number of species of fish are known to feed on them, usually pulling off a single arm or the visceral mass, both of which can be regenerated. 47% of specimens seen by one researcher were lacking one or more arms or had regenerating limbs, so sub- lethal predation is probably low. Many other invertebrates live as commensals among the rays of crinoids and it may be these succulent morsels that are the principal objective of most predators. The comatulid Florometra serratissima, in the north east Pacific, has been reported as being preyed on by the graceful decorator crabDecorator crabs are reported to snip off crinoid arms for use as camouflage. Hugh B. Cott, Adaptive Coloration in Animals, Oxford, 1940. p 360. Oregonia gracilis and the sunflower seastar Pycnopodia helianthoides. The loss of the arms may be due to autotomy, the shedding of an arm to save the rest of the organism. A arm was found to be fully regenerated in nine months in this species.

When Belgrade became the Serbian capital city in 1841, the Serbian Lyceum was also transferred. In 1863 it was transformed into a Great School with three faculties. In 1905 the Great School was reformed as the University of Belgrade with four faculties: Philosophy, Law, Technical and Medical. Initially, the Lyceum had only philosophy and law departments. In 1845 the Lyceum received the first instruments from future physics professor and rector of the Lyc√©e Vuk Marinkoviƒá. A natural science and engineering department was added to the philosophy and law department, in 1853 and included a Chemistry department which is considered as nucleus of the Faculty of Chemistry at Belgrade University. The laboratory of the chemistry department was in the basement of the Princess Ljubica's Residence.  Students  There were 21 students in the first generation and 17 of them finished the studies. In the first period, there were only between 20 and 30 students in each generation. After graduation, some of them received the government's scholarship to continue their education abroad. The Lyc√©e was intended to provide the kind of pragmatic education needed for civil servants in the growing administration: in 1815 there were just 24 government officials, but this number grew to 672 by 1839. The first student organization in Serbia, Association of Serbian Youth, was established in this lyceum in 1847, but it was soon banned because of their criticism of the Defenders of the Constitution.  Professors  The first six professors of the Lyceum were Jovan Sterija Popoviƒá, ƒêura Daniƒçiƒá, Josif Panƒçiƒá, Matija Ban, Dimitrije Ne≈°iƒá and Konstantin Brankoviƒá.

Ljubljana: Znanstvena zalo≈æba Filozofske fakultete Univerze v Ljubljani, p. 224. Name The German name of the village, Alttabor, semantically corresponds to Slovene Stari Tabor, literally 'old fortified camp'. Tabor 'fortified camp' is a relatively common element in Slovene place names and refers to a fortified area, usually on a hilltop but sometimes also narrow valleys or cliffs with caves, where the population could withdraw to shelter from Ottoman raids. The word tabor itself was borrowed into Slovene partially via German (cf. late Middle High German taberGrimm, Jacob, & Wilhelm Grimm. 1854‚Äì1971. Deutsches W√∂rterbuch. Leipzig: S. Hirzel.), but is ultimately of Turkish origin, from tabur 'battalion (prepared for defense)' (cf. also Chagatai tapkur 'fortress'). Some scholars have characterized the German name Alttabor as a Slovene-German hybrid.Steska, Viktor. 1896. \\"Koƒçevje.\\" Dom in svet 9(4):116‚Äì119, 182‚Äì184, 210‚Äì213, 243‚Äì245, 278‚Äì282; p. 118. History Stari Tabor was not yet mentioned in the land registry of 1574, and so it probably developed later as a settlement founded under the Counts of Blagay. The village developed from a fortified camp built as protection against Ottoman raids.Krajevni leksikon Dravske Banovine. 1937. Ljubljana: Zveza za tujski promet za Slovenijo, p. 471. An 18th-century military map mentions only a deteriorating fortification at the site. In 1770 it had nine houses, but only one by 1931.Savnik, Roman, ed. 1971. Krajevni leksikon Slovenije, vol. 2. Ljubljana: Dr≈æavna zalo≈æba Slovenije, p. 58. The village reached its peak population of 43 in 1880, but by 1921 it no longer had any permanent residents. In 1936 five of the six houses in the village were in ruins, and a German family of five was living in one house. The remaining six inhabitants‚Äîthe Johann Tramposch family‚Äîwere evicted from the village on 10 December 1941; the sole house was burned by Italian troops during the Rog Offensive in August 1942. The entire site of the former village is registered as cultural heritage. The ruins of two structures remain.

The hamlet is located in the municipality of Mons, H√©rault in the canton Olargues.  Geography  Bardou is situated on the edge of the Massif Central mountain range, part of the Monts de l‚ÄôEspinouse, in the Natural Regional Park of Upper Languedoc.The Natural Regional Park of Upper Languedoc website The nearest town in the east is B√©darieux (28 km), in the south is B√©ziers (39 km) and in the west is Saint-Pons-de-Thomi√®res (33 km).  History  = Middle ages = There are no historic records of the foundation of the hamlet. The oldest houses still existing were probably built in the 15th century. = 17th to 19th century = The oldest records originate from a population census in 1785. By that time 79 persons were living in 14 households in the village. In the following century the population changed only slightly, reaching its peak in 1865 when 89 persons lived in Bardou. In 1901 a school was opened where 15 children were instructed some of whom came from the neighbouring village of H√©ric or the nearby farm of Le S√©cadou.Translated from the German Wikipedia page \\"Bardou (H√©rault) = 20th century = The First World War changed the population structure substantially. The men went to the front and the women were not able to maintain the agriculture. After 1918 the returning veterans found poor living conditions, the village was haunted by famine and disease. Young people, in particular, left Bardou to seek work and better living conditions in larger villages and towns. When the dirt road to the Valley of Le Pradal was built in 1924 the majority of the population of Bardou used it to leave the village. By 1925 there were only six households left in Bardou. By 1967 only a single man was left, Achille Bonn√©t.Ralf Nestmeyer: Ein Lebenstraum aus Stein Ralf Meyer's Nest - Bardou A Lifelong Dream of Stone In 1967, however, the German, Klaus Erhardt, and the American, Jeane Rauch, purchased most of the dilapidated hamlet and set about the task of reviving it. = Klaus and Jean = The couple Klaus Erhardt, (born 17 September 1934 in Hannover, died 20 July 2009 in Bardou) and Jean Rauch (born 21 December 1930, died 9 February 2016 in Bardou) had spent several years traveling before they decided, in 1966, to settle down with Jean's four children (William, James, Elizabeth and Pan) in the South of France. They first lived in a big house in Le Lau a hamlet in the community of Vieussan. Later they learned about an almost abandoned village above Mons-la-Trivalle - Bardou. They quickly made the decision to move from Le Lau to this place. Bardou at that time consisted of some 20 ramshackle houses which were mainly overgrown by trees, shrubbery and ivy. Achille Bonnet, the then last resident of the hamlet owned 40% of the area the other 60% were distributed across more than 100 partial owners. These owners were eager to sell their property, unable to imagine living in Bardou themselves.Travelers Journal Due to the large number of owners the negotiations were protracted over several months. By the beginning of 1968, Klaus Erhardt owned most of the buildings in Bardou as well as 110 acres of the surrounding land. An additional 190 acres were ‚ÄúMazade‚Äù‚Äîcommon land that was cultivated collaboratively by all inhabitants. Over the next few years, the new owners excavated and restored the buildings and roads of Bardou. After the first few houses were inhabitable guests began to arrive and spent their holidays there. Many passing travelers who took a liking to dropout life and hands-on work joined in. Some of them stayed for weeks, others for months to help rebuild the village piece by piece, and the restored houses were rented out. Friends of the family also came regularly to Bardou and stayed for extended periods to help with the project. Some of the houses were named after those who assisted in the rebuild. Initially there were no sewage systems, water lines, telephone lines or electricity. The access road was no more than a dirt track which had to be cleared of scrub and stone. By 1969 more than half of the road was paved, but the last 1.4 km remained in poor condition until the end of the 1980s. It was not until 1994 that Bardou was connected to the French electricity grid. A telephone connection has been available since the late 1970s. However, the village still has no water supply. Drinking water is collected from natural springs in the vicinity. The waste water is collected over the year, fermented and dispersed via a sewage irrigation field. Some of the houses still do not have power and water to date. There are several outhouses on the outskirts of the village and in the centre of the village there is now a bath house with two showers and water toilets for guests. Klaus Erhardt died on 20 July 2009 in Bardou. Jean Erhardt and her daughter, Elizabeth Erhardt-Nolan continue to reside in Bardou. In 2010, great change came to Bardou. By modernizing the tapping of the spring water and building three new drinking water reservoirs the yearly problem of dwindling drinking water reserves in the summer has been alleviated. Furthermore many houses have been significantly modernized and enhanced with cast-iron fireplaces and all the comforts of life. An unnamed building was also completed next to the concert hall. Bardou, 2008 = Bardou today = Bardou has become a popular holiday destination. In the three summer months many guests spend their holidays here. Each cottage in the village is unique, clustered together against a backdrop of chestnut trees and strutting peacocks. Bardou has also become a place of music. The Sinfonietta (orchestra), Camerata and Chamber Orchestra are collections of young musicians who congregate here every year from all over the world to rehearse their music together. Their performances take place at the end of the season in the nearby churches, monasteries, and castles. Economy Jane Jacobs cited Bardou as \\"a microcosmic example of a passive economy, meaning an economy that is shaped and reshaped by forces that do not originate within itself but come from outside, specifically from distant cities. Like a toy on a string, time and again Bardou has been jerked by this powerful external economic energy.\\"  References   External links  * :de:Bardou * www.bardou.de * Ralf Nestmeyer: Ein Lebenstraum aus Stein * Parc naturel r√©gional du Haut-Languedoc * \\"Relishing Bardou\\", The Traveler's Journal * Klaus Erhardt: Bardou - Ein Pionierleben im Haut Languedoc, Anabas, Frankfurt am Main 2005. * Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 6.

A) shows clustered kataegis pattern in a small region (denoted by the red dots), and B) shows kataegis patterns scattered all over the genome. In molecular biology, kataegis describes a pattern of localized hypermutations identified in some cancer genomes, in which a large number of highly-patterned basepair mutations occur in a small region of DNA. The mutational clusters are usually several hundred basepairs long, alternating between a long range of C‚ÜíT substitutional pattern and a long range of G‚ÜíA substitutional pattern. This suggests that kataegis is carried out on only one of the two template strands of DNA during replication. Compared to other cancer-related mutations, such as chromothripsis, kataegis is more commonly seen; it is not an accumulative process but likely happens during one cycle of replication. The term kataegis (Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±ŒπŒ≥ŒØœÇ) is derived from the ancient Greek word for \\"thunderstorm\\". It was first used by scientists at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute to describe their observations of breast cancer cells. In the process of mapping mutation clusters across the genome, they used a visualization tool called \\"rainfall plots\\", as shown on the picture on the right, with which they observed a clustering pattern for kataegis.  Mechanism  Regions of kataegis have been shown to be colocalised with regions of somatic genome rearrangements. In these regions, known as the breakpoints, basepairs are more prone to get deleted, substituted, or translocated. Most hypotheses of the kataegis involves errors during the frequent DNA repair at the breakpoints. A collection of enzymes from the DNA repair system will come in to excise the mismatch basepair. When these enzymes try to mend the mutational damage, they unwind DNA into single strands and create lesion regions that do not have a purine/pyrimidine base. Across the lesion region, the bases in the unpaired, single-stranded DNA(ssDNA) are more accessible to the modifying enzyme groups that can cause further damage in the sequence, thus forming the mutational clusters seen in kataegis. Two enzyme families are assumed to be related to kataegis. The APOBEC(\\"apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like\\") enzyme family causes predominately C‚ÜíT mutations, and translesional DNA synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerase causes C‚ÜíG or C‚ÜíT mutations. = APOBEC enzyme family (C‚ÜíT mutations) = Figure 2: APOBEC deaminase for Homo Sapiens. This is a 3D model for APOBEC-2 protein. APOBEC family is a group of cytidine deaminase enzymes that plays an important role in immune system. Its major function is to induce genetic mutations in antibodies, which need a huge variety of genes in order to bind to different antigens. APOBEC family can also protect against the infection of RNA retroviruses and retrotransposons. In a single-strand DNA (ssDNA), APOBEC can transfer an amine group from a cytosine(C) and turn it into a uracil(U); such mutations can deaminate the viral gene and terminate the retro-transcription process that codes RNA back to DNA. As shown in Figure 1, the base mutations in kataegis regions were found to be almost exclusively cytosine to thymine in the context of a TpC dinucleotide(p denotes the phosphoribose backbone). At DNA lesion sites, APOBEC enzyme can have access to long ssDNA and induce a C‚ÜíU mutations. APOBEC family is processive and can continue to induce multiple mutations in a small region. If this part of DNA is replicated before such mutation is repaired, the mutation gets passed on to the subclones. The original CG pair will become a TA pair after one round of replication, hence the predominantly seen C‚ÜíT mutation in kataegis. Among the APOBEC family, APOBEC3 subfamily are responsible for protection against retroviruses such as HIV(known to be modified by APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G). Since their original functions include editing ssDNA, they are more likely to be responsible for causing large numbers of mutations on human ssDNA. The direct link between the APOBEC deaminases and kataegistic clusters of mutations was recently obtained by expressing hyperactive deaminase in yeast cells. Recent evidence has linked the over-expression of the family member APOBEC3B with multiple human cancers, highlighting its possible contribution to genomic instability and kataegis. Meanwhile, activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is shown to facilitate kataegis formation in human lymphomas. AID's majorly function is to diversify the genes among immune cells. Recent research shows that AID is involved in site-specific mutations in B cell tumor, while APOBEC3 subfamily causes the non-specific, cross-genomic mutations in non-B cell tumor. Figure 3: Different errors can occur when TLS DNA Polymerase insert over a lesion. A) Misincorporation of base: a mismatched cytosine(blue) is inserted to pair with an adenine(asterisk). B)Slippage: An extra adenine is inserted into the sequence. C)Hairpin in sequence: polymerase passes by the hairpin in the replication of nascent strand = TLS DNA polymerase (C‚ÜíG and C‚ÜíT mutations) = Translesional DNA synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerase family brings in the nucleotide to bridge across the abasic sites in DNA lesion. Due to the natural of the function of this enzyme, TLS DNA polymerase has a high error rates. It can slip at sequence or insert A or C base pairs into a distorted region on DNA strand; ss shown in Figure 3, TLS DNA polymerase may cause mutations in many different ways. Among the TLS DNA polymerases, Rev1 has a mechanism of inserting cytosine into lesion site that does not contain a template. Since Rev1 does not read according to Watson and Crick basepair, it can introduce any random nucleotide into the DNA sequence. In most experimental cases, Rev1 is responsible for the C‚ÜíG mutation during DNA repair. The effect of Rev1 can be combined with that of the APOBEC family. If the C‚ÜíU mutation error is detected by its specific glycosylase, the glycosylase will cut the base pair and form an abasic site. Then TLS DNA polymerase can come in and induce C‚ÜíG in this case. In yeast research data, Rev1 and Rev3 can account for up 98% of basepair substitutions and 95% of UV induced mutations. Pol Œ∂ is another kind of TLS DNA polymerase that collaborates with Rev1(mostly Rev1p) in the process of forming hypermutations in eukaryotes. Pol Œ∂ is hypothesized to contribute to homologous allele exchanges. It can extend from DNA region distorted or bulged due to mismatches and bypass certain lesion site in DNA. According to research in yeast, Pol Œ∂ can pass different mutations with ~10% efficiency, much more often than the result from other polymerases. When Pol Œ∂ reads pass the mutation sites, the genetic mutations remain and are passed on to the next round of replication.  Clinical Significance  Kataegis is prevalently seen among breast cancer patients, and it is also exists in lung cancers, cervical, head and neck, and bladder cancers, as shown in the results from tracing APOBEC mutation signatures. Understanding the mechanism of how kataegis can be useful for the future research in how cancer has developed. Due to the highly patterned mutations in kataegis, researchers can make statistical models in order to trace the loci that are prone to mutations. Research have found that kataegis could be a good prognostic indicator for breast cancer patient, that there is a life expectancy difference between patients with kataegis and those without. The specific reason was not clear. Because kataegis causes up- regulation and down-regulation of different factors, it is hypothesized that kataegis might have down-regulated the migration related gene, thus causing the tumor to be less invasive.

He painted and repaired them to working condition and then sold them for $1,500. Santucci then entered the world of real estate by diversifying his assets into real estate holdings, beginning with the Parisian Palace, a mansion he designed not only as a home but as a venue for parties and events. He also designed and built the rock star-themed ultra lounge Black Door, Venus and C2K at the Venetian Hotel and Casino.

The film discusses the possible nutritional and environmental benefits of adopting a whole foods, plant-based diet based on the research of T. Colin Campbell, Caldwell Esselstyn and Gidon Eshel. The film also features the views of Peter Singer. According to Shelley Lee Davies, the film purposely does not cover any purported animal rights arguments (as opposed to animal welfare) for adopting a plant-based (vegan) diet, but concentrates on the health and environmental reasons instead. The main claims surrounding the china study, a study repeatedly referenced in the documentary in support of the claims, has been debunked. Instead the study is said to show the opposite of what Dr. Campbell is claiming. That is, there is no correlation between animal protein and cancer risk. Planeat premiered at the 2010 Newport Beach Film Festival. It released theatrically in the United States in April 2011 and the United Kingdom in May 2011. The film was privately screened by the film's directors and Willie Bain MP at Somerset House in March 2011 and in the House of Commons in May 2011.

MacDonald & Jane's Publishers Ltd) Triple is a spy thriller novel written by British author Ken Follett. It was originally published in 1979. The background of the plot is Operation Plumbat, a 1968 operation carried out by Mossad that did not become publicly known about until 1977. Plot summary The book's prologue describes a chance meeting of several people in Oxford in the year 1947. The main character is Nathaniel \\"Nat\\" Dickstein, a victim of experimentation in the Nazi concentration camps who later becomes an Israeli agent; also the American Alan \\"Al\\" Cortone, of Italian origin, whose life Dickstein saved in Sicily; and the Russian chessmaster David Rostov, who subsequently joins the KGB. The three go together to a sherry party given by Professor Ashford, who teaches Hebrew Literature at Oxford. Dickstein, who is studying under Ashford, is in love with his wife Eila, but there are rival suitors. Another guest, Yasif Hassan, of Palestinian origin, has an affair with Eila, as later seen in Professor Ashford's garden. Ashford's daughter, Suza, also makes an appearance. In the first chapters Pierre Bourg, the head of the Israeli secret service Mossad finds out in 1968 that Egypt is building a nuclear reactor in the Western Desert, in order to produce an atom bomb. He assigns his best agent, Nat Dickstein, to steal about two hundred tons of uranium ore for Israel, to pre-empt the potential Egyptian threat and to enable them to build a bomb themselves. Dickstein has to ensure that nobody suspects Israeli participation in the theft. Dickstein travels to Luxembourg to obtain documentation on all uranium shipments from the EURATOM agency located there. He eventually achieves this by blackmailing a EURATOM employee. In his hotel he has a chance encounter with Yasif Hassan, who is now an Egyptian agent. As a result of this the KGB gets onto Dickstein's tail. For practical reasons, and also because in 1948 he successfully hijacked an arms shipment at sea, Dickstein meanwhile decides to make the uranium theft from a maritime transport of yellowcake ore, from a freighter called the Coparelli. Dickstein is persistently followed by Rostov's KGB group, to which Hassan now also belongs. This culminates in the tailing of all Israeli diplomats in London by the KGB. Despite this, Dickstein succeeds in repeatedly shaking off his pursuers. He travels to Oxford to see Professor Ashford again. Instead of his former teacher, the now grown-up daughter Suza Ashford answers the door. They have a candid conversation and fall in love. A short time later, Hassan visits the Professor (whose sympathies were already pro-Arab), and tells him of Dickstein's true activities and plans. The two persuade Suza to help eliminate Dickstein. She pretends to go along with this in order to be in a better position to warn her lover of this danger. Hassan also intends to deliver the uranium to the Palestinian Fedayeen, betraying both Rostov and the Egyptians. To facilitate the robbery at sea, Dickstein acquires the Stromberg, a sister ship of the Coparelli, and founds a bogus maritime company. He also arranges for the Coparelli to suffer a mechanical breakdown at sea, and for the crew to be almost completely disembarked. Through further complicated measures, Dickstein hopes to erase traces of the uranium theft. Israeli commandos aboard the Stromberg are to attack the Coparelli, but Hassan and his Fedayeen arrive first. However Dickstein and the Israelis recapture the Coparelli, and Hassan is killed. Dickstein then goes alone to board the Russian ship Karla, that is also in the area, as Suza Ashford is a prisoner there. Rostov and a KGB force are aboard. Suza is able to create a diversion, enabling Dickstein to rescue her and destroy the Karla by means of a magnetic mine. The story ends with the statement that Dickstein has left Mossad to settle with Suza in Israel. The book concludes with a newspaper article appearing in the Daily Telegraph in 1977, revealing that Israel is suspected of involvement in the disappearance at sea of the uranium shipment nine years earlier.Israel Suspected of Hikacking Ship With Uranium, Henry Miller, London Daily Telegraph, May 7, 1977.

First published on 7 July 2012, the novel concludes a trilogy concerning Alexander Cleave and his daughter, Cass. Eclipse (2000) and Shroud (2002) were Ancient Light's literary predecessors in the Banville canon. Banville dedicated Ancient Light to the literary editor Caroline Walsh, whose recent sudden death had left him devastated. Plot and themes Ancient Light is narrated by Alexander Cleave, a 60-something year-old retired actor, and takes place 10 years after the death of his daughter Cass in Eclipse. Cleave begins to record his memories of a first, unlikely affair he had at age 15 with Mrs Gray, a married woman 20 years his senior. \\"Billy Gray was my best friend and I fell in love with his mother.\\"Banville, John. Ancient Light. Viking Penguin, 2012, p.3 The book moves between memories of this affair and his current state of grief he shares with his wife Lydia, touching on themes of family, love, grief, and the reliability of memory. His solitude is interrupted by an offer to play the lead in a film entitled The Invention of the Past. The film is to be based on the life of literary theorist Axel Vander, the man with Cass when she killed herself in Italy. On the set Cleave bonds with Dawn Devonport, an emotionally fragile young ingenue mourning the death of her father. As Cleave continues to narrate his past relationship with Mrs Gray to its inevitable conclusion, the father-daughter relationship grows between him and Dawn. Reception Critical reception for Ancient Light was primarily positive, with a reviewer for UK newspaper The Independent calling it a \\"luminous, breathtaking work.\\" Critics for The Guardian also reviewed Ancient Light, with Tim Adams praising Banville's themes and \\"cleverness\\", while Alex Clark praised the dual narrative as \\"disorienting\\". UK newspaper The Daily Telegraph gave the book three out of five stars, writing that it is \\"notably, though for the most part seamlessly, light-fingered ‚Äì strings of Yeses from Ulysses, bits of Eliot, a hazel wood from Yeats, a lovely quote from Leopardi\\". The Harvard Crimson, stated that '[t]he major weakness of \\"Ancient Light,\\" however, lies is not in its moments of gimmickry but in its vagueness'. The writer Colm T√≥ib√≠n named Ancient Light as one of his books of the year. Ancient Light won in the Novel category at the 2012 Irish Book Awards. Artwork The cover photograph of a man and a woman dancing in a kitchen was taken by Elliott Erwitt and is titled \\"Spain, Valencia, 1952, Robert and Mary Frank\\".

In 1957 Chartered Bank (now Standard Chartered Bank), acquired Eastern, and eventually absorbed it into Standard Chartered in 1971. History =Early years : 1909 - 1945 = Eastern Bank Limited was founded in 1909 in London, as a new Eastern exchange bank, to help finance trade with the far east. The next year Eastern established branches in Bombay and Calcutta. Right from its inception, the bank had a number of powerful institutional shareholders, including the Sassoon family. Eastern expanded into the Ottoman province of Mesopotamia (now Iraq), opening a Baghdad branch in 1912. The province had promises of a lucrative oil exploration concession, being actively pursued by a consortium which included Anglo-Persian Oil Company (now BP), Royal Dutch Shell, and Deutsche Bank named - Turkish Petroleum Company (TPC), now Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC). Eastern Bank had to close its Baghdad branch at the start of the World War I due to the alliance from the Ottoman Empire and German Empire, and competition from other banks that included Deutsche Bank and the National Bank of Turkey. However, Eastern reopened its Baghdad branch within a year and opened branches in Basra (1915), and Amarah (1916), in the wake of the British invasion of Iraq. With the establishment of a British Mandate over Iraq, the bank expanded further into Mosul (1919) and Kirkuk (1926). Eastern also expanded to other British possessions East of Suez, namely Colombo, Ceylon (1920), Madras (1922), Karachi (1923), and Singapore (1928). British banks also expanded into the small sheikhdoms in the Persian Gulf, British protectorates which were short of modern financial institutions. Eastern opened a branch in Bahrain in 1920 to leverage the close trading links between the island and Bombay, a key stronghold of Eastern bank. Until 1944, Eastern remained the island's only bank. By the late 1930s, profits rose because of the booming oil industry in the Arab sheikhdoms. However, Eastern couldn't expand further in the region as the Imperial Bank of Persia (later the British Bank of the Middle East) held near monopoly agreements during the 1940s with the rulers of several important sheikhdoms, especially Kuwait. During the 1930s and 1940s, Barclays Bank (DCO) started acquiring stake in Eastern Bank and in 1939 the chairman of Barclays (DCO) joined the board of Eastern Bank. =Post world war: 1945 - 1957= After the Second World War, Eastern opened branches in Penang, (Malaysia) (1947, closed 1958), with a sub-branch at Butterworth (1948, closed 1957), Kuala Lumpur (1948), Chittagong, (East Pakistan, now Bangladesh) (1948, closed 1958), and Cochin, (India) (1953, closed 1958). It also opened branches at Doha, (Qatar) (1950), Aden, (Yemen) (1951), with a sub-branch at Steamer Point (1953, closed 1958), Mukalla, (Yemen) (1955), and Beirut, (Syria) (1956). Barclays Bank DCO increased its stake as a strategic initiative to tap into its Arab customers via Eastern Bank, as Barclays had a strong Jewish customer base in Palestine. By 1957, Barclays Bank DCO and the Sassoon family in total held a controlling 65% of the capital of the bank. =Amalgamation into Standard Chartered: 1957 - 1971= In 1957, the Mundhra Scandal inflicted heavy losses on Eastern Bank's Bombay and Calcutta branches. The same year, Barclays DCO and the Sassoon family sold their controlling interest in the bank to Chartered Bank, an Eastern Bank rival. At that time, Chartered bank faced the challenges of a post colonial world with new national government policies in China, India, Burma and Ceylon, and saw Eastern bank as a strategic acquisition. The bank remained a wholly owned subsidiary of Chartered Bank, with some level of autonomy. The political changes in several Arab countries during the 1960s led to nationalisation of branches in Iraq, Aden, Mukalla, and Sheikh Othman, and these events greatly affected Eastern. During the same time, it opened branches in Sharjah (1958), Abu Dhabi (1961), Al Ain (Buraimi, Abu Dhabi) (1962), Seiyun (Yemen) (1962), and Bowbazar in Calcutta (1969). In 1969, Chartered Bank merged with the South African bank Standard Bank, forming Standard Chartered Bank. In 1971, Standard Chartered absorbed Eastern's operations, and the name \\"Eastern Bank Ltd\\" slowly disappeared.

Allegedly intended to serve as temporary holding facilities for teachers accused of various kinds of misconduct who are awaiting an official hearing, these reassignment centers have become known amongst the \\"exiled\\" teachers subculture as \\"rubber rooms\\", so named after the padded cells of psychiatric hospitals. Film content The film documents the daily routines of teachers accused of misconduct or incompetence. Several days, weeks, months, or even years are spent in these \\"Kafkaesque\\" rubber rooms waiting for some kind of resolution; the filmmakers estimate that the average wait time is three years, but cited cases lasting as long as ten years. During this time in \\"exile\\", the teachers receive their full pay and benefit packages at the cost of up to 65 million dollars per year to the city, spending each day reading, playing cards, balancing checkbooks, sleeping, or simply staring blankly at the walls. Interviewed teachers from the rubber room describe the high tensions that develop between teachers angry at their inexplicable situations that curiously lead to a \\"prison-like\\" environment in which teachers largely separate themselves into fiercely territorial cliques, sometimes even resulting in physical altercations. The rubber room is shown as a way that administrators are able to be rid of teachers by circumventing the notoriously difficult process of removing a tenured teacher. Reasons that teachers are sent to the rubber room range from accusations as extreme as physical and sexual abuse of students to as minor as excessive tardiness or even simple personality conflicts with administrators, and yet these groups of teachers are shown to be lumped together in the same situation with egregiously delayed hearings, often without evidence of any misconduct, sometimes even going without knowledge of what the alleged misconduct actually is, for up to three years. Furthermore, the film shows some students boasting about having learned to take advantage of this system after realizing that they have the power to remove teachers almost at will. This upset in the balance of power, they show, can have drastic effects on the teachers' ability to do their jobs and effectively teach while maintaining order in the classrooms. Making of the film In an interview with MSNBC's Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, filmmaker and former New York City teacher Jeremy Garrett explained that they intended their film to be an expos√© on not only the excessive waste that is associated with maintaining the rubber rooms, but also to highlight the \\"shifting landscape in education\\", modern students' lack of respect for teachers and how it affects their ability to teach, and mismanagement of the educational system in general. During production, Garrett was arrested for trespassing while covertly filming the events of daily life inside the rubber room. According to Garrett, the arrest came after the Department of Education learned of his intent to collect footage inside the rubber rooms for the expos√©. The film was profiled in a 2008 segment of This American Life with Ira Glass called \\"Human Resources\\", which related various human resources problems in the country. In 2010, another documentary about the failures of the American public education, Waiting for \\"Superman\\", licensed footage shot by Five Boroughs Productions for The Rubber Room to use in Waiting for \\"Superman's\\"' short segment on the reassignment centers. On April 12, 2010, the New York Department of Education (DoE) announced that it would be closing down its reassignment centers, facing pressures from the public and the teachers' union. Release and reception Due in part to media attention on the subject including the release of Waiting for \\"Superman\\" earlier in the year, as well as the recent settlement between the United Federation of Teachers (UFT) and DoE, the film was released to three full audiences on April 16, 2010, with largely positive reactions from the audience and critics in attendance.

Another monumental work by the firm was the ‚ÄúRoyal Illustrated Atlas‚Äù James Bell (1769-1836) published his \\"New and Comprehensive Gazetteer of England and Wales\\" in 1833-4. Bell was a writer on geography who edited Rollin's \\"Ancient History\\" in 1828 and wrote a \\"System of Geography\\" in 1830. The maps in his gazetteer all bear the imprint of the publisher and were engraved by Gray and Son, Josiah Neele & Co or Robert Scott. Fullarton republished extracts from Bell's Gazetteer in his Parliamentary Gazetteer, acknowledging that some material had been included. He was therefore angry at what he saw as an accusation of plagiarism and 'extremely disingenuous attempt to underrate the value and importance of their laborious and accurate Compilation' stating that 'these materials do not constitute one third part of the present Publication'. Curiously, James Bell had pirated the work of Samuel Lewis' \\"Topographical Dictionary\\". Lewis obtained an injunction in 1839 and Bell's Gazetteer was withdrawn. Fullarton, who had been Bell's publisher, bought the plates, and issued the maps in his own Parliamentary Gazetteer. Fullarton was also responsible for Rev. J. M. Wilson's \\"Imperial Gazetteer of Scotland\\", its companion volume \\"Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales\\" and Bartholomew's \\"Imperial Map\\".http://www.antique-maps-online.co.uk/devon- fullarton-2478.html Another major work was \\"A Gazetteer of the World: Or, Dictionary of Geographical Knowledge\\" published in 1856. This provided a concise description of towns, cities, provinces and countries around the world, all beyond the British Isles.Royal Geographical Society (Great Britain). (1856).

On 20 November 1809 Fullarton, William Sommerville and John Blackie entered into a partnership, taking over the business of publisher A. & W. D. Brownlie, where they had previously worked. Archibald Fullarton was made a Burgess and Guild Brother of Glasgow on 18 December 1815, as he had earlier married Jean, the daughter of John M'Naught, a weaver, who had served in the Glasgow Regiment.Scottish Record Society, The Burgesses and Guild Brethren of Glasgow 1751-1846, J.

WTCF is owned and operated by Educational Media Foundation. Pre-broadcast history Logo of WTCF used from August 15, 2012 to March 27, 2014.Logo of WTCF used from March 27, 2014 to August 1, 2014. On May 23, 2011, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced Alex Media, Inc. as high bidder and winner of the auction for the 103.3 FM frequency to be located in Wardensville, West Virginia, part of Auction 91. Alex Media filed a construction permit on August 17, 2011, for a radio station to broadcast on that frequency and transmit from Little North Mountain in western Frederick County, Virginia. A potential problem between the new station and existing station WLTK, which was also broadcasting on 103.3, was corrected after Alex Media asked the FCC to file a \\"Show Cause\\" notice asking WLTK to move to vacant frequency 102.9 FM. On November 7, 2011, WLTK filed to move from 103.3 FM to 102.9 FM, allowing Alex Media to begin broadcasting on 103.3 FM without interference. On June 15, 2012, the owners of WLTK applied for and were granted a new broadcast license moving it from 103.3 to 102.9, but from the same location and tower, at the same power and over the same coverage area as previously. On June 19, 2012, WLTK officially switched frequencies from 103.3 to 102.9 MHz. The call sign WTCF was awarded on March 19, 2012, and on June 21, 2012, it was announced on \\"The Cross FM\\", a web-only radio station broadcasting from WTRM's studios in Winchester, Virginia, that it would launch on WTCF in \\"45 to 60 days\\". On June 25, 2012, Alex Media entered into an Option Agreement to sell WTCF to WTRM owners Timber Ridge Ministries, Inc. for $650,000. A time brokerage agreement was also entered on the same date. On the same day, Alex Media applied for a construction permit to move to another tower, from the authorized tower, with an increase in power, from 340 watts to 350 watts. One day later on July 26, 2012, the station announced via their official Facebook page, that they would be launching on September 4, 2012, but will be in \\"testing mode\\" during the month of August. At 10:00am, on August 15, 2012, WTCF began operations in \\"testing mode\\". On August 28, 2012, Alex Media filed an \\"Application for Construction Permit for Commercial Broadcast Station\\" for WTCF in advance of the station's September 4 launch. It would not be until one month later, on September 28, that WTCF would apply for and be granted an FM broadcast license. WTCF ended their \\"testing mode\\" programming and officially launched on September 4, 2012 at 9:00 am. Sale of WTRM On February 6, 2013, Timber Ridge Ministries sold then-sister station WTRM to the American Family Association for $1.1 million. The sale was approved by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on March 28, 2013 and was closed on April 11, 2013. At 8:30 pm on April 11, 2013, WTRM officially switched to American Family Radio programming with \\"Southern Light\\" programming remaining online on a Timber Ridge Ministries owned website. WTCF was not part of the sale and programming on WTCF was not affected. Sale of WTCF Alex Media, Inc. filed an Asset Purchase Agreement with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on July 5, 2013, beginning the process of selling WTCF to Timber Ridge Ministries for $650,000. Alex Media had previously entered into an Option Agreement to sell WTCF to Timber Ridge Ministries for $650,000 back on June 25, 2012. An application to assign the WTCF license to Timber Ridge Ministries was filed on August 26, 2013, and was consummated on September 1, 2013. Format Flip WTCF signed off its hybrid Contemporary Christian/Christian Rock/Christian Hip Hop after just 18 months on the air, switching to Southern Gospel as \\"Southern Light\\" at 12Noon on March 27, 2014. The \\"Southern Light\\" format was previously heard on former sister-station WTRM. Sold Again On May 19, 2014, Educational Media Foundation (EMF) purchased WTCF, from owner Timber Ridge Ministries, for $425,000. Timber Ridge sold the station for $175,000 less than what they purchased it for in 2013. In its filing with the FCC, EMF announced plans to make WTCF an affiliate of their K-LOVE network. The FCC granted the sale of WTCF on July 2, 2014. Timber Ridge closed on a sale of nearby station, WVRS, on July 3, 2014. Four days later, the station began simulcasting its Southern Gospel format on WVRS. At 12:00am on August 1, the simulcast of WVRS and WTCF ended. The Southern Gospel format remained on WVRS, with K-LOVE programming beginning on WTCF. The sale of WTCF to EMF was closed on September 2, 2014.

It is actually an octagonal shape, which meets criteria to be defined as a round barn. It is significant for its incorporation of fieldstone into the random limestone foundation and its transition to new, lighter wood framing. The barn was built by Silas Dean who purchased the property in 1867 who created the windmill-type ventilation system, which was evidence of the experimentation with round barn design. There are also wings to the barn, one of which was more instrumental to the structure. By 1904, the barn was owned by William Armstrong who didn't feel that the windmill was very effective and took it out and built the stave silo on concrete foundations. Another barn of the octagonal-round type, in Wisconsin, is the George Apfel Round Barn near Clinton, Wisconsin, built 1914.

Structure  Serenade in A lasts about twelve minutes and is in four movements: Despite its title, the work is in neither A major nor A minor. According to Eric White, A is not the \\"key\\" of the work, but rather the music radiates from and tends towards A as a \\"tonic pole\\". Thus, the first and the last chord of each movement contains the note A, either as the root, third, or fifth of a triad.Eric Walter White, Stravinsky: The Composer and His Works, second edition (Berkeley and Los Angeles: The University of California Press, 1979): 324. .

The architectural monument demolished in the 20th century is documented in images and photos from the 19th century. Like the Marand and Urmia mosques, there were two lancet arches in walls of the Friday Mosque in Nakhchivan, although the southern wall of its cubic trunk was covered with a cupola. This shows that a new local type of mosque was created and developed in the centre of Azerbaijan in the 12th century. According to photo documents, all three sides of the masqura of the mosque were surrounded with columns. But there is no information about their appearance. According to V.A.Engelguard: { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"2\\" align=\\"center\\"  width=\\"50%\\" style=\\"background:#f6f6f6;\\"  \\"This Turkish mosque is a great construction with arches made of ashlar and there are many ornaments in its interior. One section of the building has already been destroyed and the remainder is in danger of demolition. There is a door with a minaret at about 50 sajens (approximately 107 meters) from the mosque. There were supporting buildings in the area between the mosque and the door, but these are no longer present. It can be seen that the door belongs to a tower (Momine Khatun Mausoleum) which is not far from it.\\" } It can therefore be considered that the arch with two minarets is connected to the Friday mosque with cells and a columned gallery and it is opened to the yard of the mosque. From historical sources, it is known that there was a madrasa in the Atabegs‚Äô Architectural complex. There is no doubt that this madrasa had a direct connection with Friday mosque. It is considered that the arch with two-minarets was the arch of the yard where are collected religious constructions of the Atabegs‚Äô complex. If the first constructions of the Atabegs‚Äô Complex were the palace and divan, then the last construction was the arch which has been documented only in photos. The scientist of oriental studies N.Khanikov saw this arch in the 19th century and from a ligature located on its door read that \\"It was ordered to construct the mosque in 1187, by amir Nureddin ‚Äì leader of the cavalry and tax collector of the Atabeys‚Äô state of Azerbaijan\\". That ligature was finished with \\"Ajami Nakhchivani‚Äôs work\\" words. The great entrance arch was surrounded with short and tall arches and there were minarets with cylindrical trunks at the edges of proportional formed arch covered with ligature boom. This monument of Nakhchivan which has one of the first arches in such a shape is evidence of the highest level achieved by the Azerbaijani religious architecture of the mid-11th and 12th centuries. Such a composition of the arch became the main architectural method in a lot of Islamic countries in the next centuries.

The three wings were used as an officer's school by the German army. In 1944 the building was used for storing furniture of residents in and about Frankfurt who had been \\"bombed out\\" by the Allies. It was also used to house many homeless people. From May 1945 to September 1946 the building was used as billets for American troops, primarily Engineers and Signal battalions.

The 1957 Senior Prom was held in the Casino, near the I.G. Farben building. In the fall of 1954, the school moved to a newly constructed set of buildings on Siolistra√üe at Miquelallee, near the I.G. Farben building. The new school complex included new male and female dormitories. Freshmen attended the school from 1946 until 1959 and again from 1988 until 1995. Dormitory life A dormitory was located adjacent to the school to house students whose families lived too far away to commute daily. Entrance to the girl's dormitory as it appeared in the 1950s Dormitory students (Dormies) included those residing only during the school week, five days, and those who lived so far away that they only went home on long holidays. The seven-day-students included those living as far away as Moscow and Kabul. Two students were assigned to each room. Generally, the underclassmen were housed on the bottom floor while upperclassmen occupied the upper floor. The girls' dorm was separated from the boys' dorm by a social lounge connecting the two. Occasionally, social events such as dance classes took place in this area. In earlier days, dorm life was very structured and included a mandatory two hour study period each night. During the study periods, students were required to be seated at their desks, in the rooms, with the door open. The door was left open so that the adult monitors could see that each student was present and a minimum of distraction was adhered to. At the beginning of study hall, the building was locked down and everyone was in for the night (with a few exceptions). After study hall, there was a short period of time for night grooming, a short snack, and such, until lights out. In the 1970s restrictions were more relaxed. There was no study hour, but students had to be in the dorm by 8 pm and \\"lights out\\" was at 10 pm.

In December 2014, the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame relocated to a new home within the Curb Museum for Music and Motorsports at 600 Dale Earnhardt Boulevard. History The organization was founded in 1994 by businessmen Doug Croft and Joe Carroll. Originally located in Thomasville, North Carolina, the group inducted seven people in 1999 and one in 2002. Suffering from a lack of space, a historic city jail in Kannapolis, North Carolina, was chosen as the new location. Full renovation began in 2008, with the museum completed 7 months later in 2009. Much of the renewed interest in the NC Music Hall of Fame was driven by music industry mogul Mike Curb who has ties to Kannapolis and is friends with David Murdock who was building the Kannapolis-based North Carolina Research Campus. He worked out a deal to lease and renovate the old city jail and police station. Curb also has his close friend and North Carolina native, music executive Eddie Ray, become operations director to oversee the day-to-day for the organization. Mike Curb and Eddie Ray were both inducted into the Hall in 2009. Mike Curb for his contribution and support of the Hall of Fame and Eddie Ray for his lifetime achievement in the music non-performer category. In 2012, the organization hosted its third induction ceremony which was open to the public.

Previously known as the New Mole and New Mole Extension, the South Mole, with the rest of harbour, is just north of the east entrance to the Strait of Gibraltar. History North Mole, Detached Mole, and South Mole Bay of Gibraltar c1750 includes Gibraltar Harbour with Old Mole and short New Mole. The \\"New\\" Mole in the 1890s. Photograph taken from the \\"New\\" Mole looking south along its length in the 1890s . The South Mole at Gibraltar Harbour is one of a trio of breakwaters that provides protection to the harbour, in addition to that which results from the presence of the Rock of Gibraltar on its east side. The South Mole is positioned at the southwestern aspect of the harbour, and is in length. The Gibdock shipyard and Royal Naval base are also in the southern section of the harbour, the wharfage of the shipyard including of the South Mole. Repair berths along the breakwater can accommodate vessels up to 150,000 deadweight tonnage (dwt). During construction in the 1880s, a railway and two new tunnels were created to take large quantities of quarried stone to assist in the Mole's creation. One of these tunnels was by Camp Bay and the other was under the Parson's Lodge Battery. The north end of the South Mole, its \\"A\\" Head, is the site of the Gibraltar South Mole Lighthouse. The location gives the tower its alternate name of the Gibraltar \\"A\\" Head Lighthouse. Its light characteristic is a quick, flashing white light, with a range of fifteen nautical miles. The black, cast-iron, skeletal tower continues to be active as an aid to navigation and is operated by the Gibraltar Port Authority. The south entrance to Gibraltar Harbour, between the \\"A\\" Head of the South Mole and the \\"B\\" Head of the Detached Mole, is controlled by the Queen's Harbourmaster. Berths utilised by U.S. Navy ships on the South Mole include Piers 48, 49, and 50. The South Mole was formerly known as the New Mole and New Mole Extension, to distinguish it from the Old Mole at the northeastern corner of the harbour. Construction of the New Mole was begun by the Spanish in 1620. It underwent extension a variety of times, eventually reaching a length of . It was built of rubble stone. The New Mole Extension was added about the turn of the twentieth century. The extension, together with the New Mole length of , resulted in a total length of for the New Mole and New Mole Extension together, by 1911. This is more than the length indicated by the Gibraltar Port Authority one hundred years later, in 2011. In 1916, the length of the south entrance to the harbour was reported to be . At that time, coal stores lined almost the entire length of the South Mole. SS Rosslyn In January 1916, the SS Rosslyn, a more than 3,600 ton steamship commanded by Captain William Fishey, departed from Liverpool, England. The ship was 340 feet long and built in 1902. After the ship's cargo was unloaded at Muros, Spain, the captain was directed to set a course for Gibraltar, where he was instructed to anchor off the South Mole, outside the harbour. After an uneventful week at anchor, the weather changed for the worse on 27 February 1916. The following day, gale-force winds repeatedly dashed the ship against the recently completed South Mole. Despite the efforts of tugs provided by the Royal Navy and the Gibraltar Harbour authority, the ship sank off the South Mole.

The area was formerly contaminated waste land and industrial buildings to the north of Stratford town centre. History =Planning and construction= 300px Aerial overview of the Olympic Park south towards the 300px As part of the regeneration programme within the bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics, the Olympic Village design to house the athletes was based on reusing the buildings after the games as a new residential district for Stratford. Through a competitive bidding process, the then Labour British government chose a proposal by Lend Lease Project Management & Construction which covered financing and construction of both the Olympic Village and part of the London Olympics Media Centre. This would both provide accommodation for 24,000 athletes, and afterwards provide a mix of low cost and private residential housing, within a community that would comprise offices, shops, schools and a health centre. Cilantro Engineering were appointed to work as part of a collaborative team to deliver Design and Build MEP Installations for LendLease. Lend Lease engaged a team of: architects Fletcher Priest; structural engineers Arup; and urban planning/landscape architecture firm West 8 and Vogt Landscape. They were briefed to design a village-garden type district to fit in with the wider urban park vision of the Olympic Park legacy, emulating the classical Victorian architecture layout of Maida Vale and other parts of Victorian west London. On a site, the plan provided for 11 residential plots, each made up of 5 to 7 blocks, built around communal squares and courtyards, with water features accentuating the closeness of the River Lea. Each of the 67 blocks is of between 8 and 12 storeys high, nominally laid out: Street level of mostly three storey townhouses, with front doors on street level to create an \\"active frontage\\". These are supplemented by a mix of single to three storey shops and offices. Floor 3 and above in the centre of the complex are communal raised gardens, which hide carparks beneath. At and above this level are a mix of low cost and private residential apartments, ranging from studio to five bedroom. Each apartment provides generous floor spacing, and each includes its own balcony that is big enough for a table and chairs. The whole Olympic Park site was proposed to be secured under a Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) by the London Development Agency. In late 2005, a row broke out between then Mayor of London Ken Livingstone and Newham Council/Westfield Group over the use of the legal instrument. The site for the Olympic Village was to be located next to the ¬£4Bn development of Stratford City, but access difficulties meant that the Olympic Park CPO extended onto the site for Stratford City. In November 2005, an agreement was made whereby the CPO over the Westfield site was removed, subject to agreed access provisions to the Olympic Village. In light of the 2008 financial crisis, Lend Lease found difficulties in raising funds on the commercial markets for the construction of the village, the single largest project in the 2012 Summer Olympics scheme.London 2012 Games village deal seen by year-end Reuters Accessed 8 October 2008 The government via the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) hence agreed to underwrite a greater part of the required sum, and a scale-back of the project scale by 25%, on the proviso that athletes competing in non-London based events would be housed locally to their competition.London 2012 Olympic village funding to be settled by end of 2008 following reduction in scale Associated Press Released 11 July 2008 Following the athletes' experiences in Beijing 2008, and in particular through comments concerning athletes' welfare by International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge, this compromise was to be reconsidered whilst pressure built for the finance deal to be resolved.2012 Games will be under budget BBC News Accessed 31 August 2008 Up until this point, the proposed site had been a mix of former industrial buildings and contaminated waste land. The proposed site for the village provided two living camp sites for Irish Travellers, one on Clays Lane, Newham, and a second on Waterden Crescent, Hackney. The final part of the Olympic CPO covering the village site, secured in December 2006, was unsuccessfully challenged by the travellers in the High Court in May 2007. Towards the end of demolition/site clearance, on 12 November 2007 a fire broke out in an old industrial warehouse on Waterden Road, Hackney Wick, on the western edge of the proposed Olympic village site. With flames of in height engulfing the building and sending clouds of acrid black smoke over the city centre, it took 75 firefighters from the London Fire Brigade to bring the fire under control. =Olympic and Paralympic village = During the summer of 2012, the first use for the blocks was as the Olympic Village for the 2012 Summer Olympics. Taking the original design, the architects added temporary partitioning to create \\"hotel\\" style apartments catering for: 3,300 apartments: each to have a TV, internet access, and a private courtyard; and 17,320 beds (this is around 17,000 for athletes ~ 10903 (total number of them) and rest for officials during the Games):London 2012 Venues - Top Stories Videos & Photos  Olympicorg providing each athlete with floor space. In addition, the developers added two temporary buildings: a food hall, which was open 24 hours a day, capable of catering for 5,500 athletes at a time; and an entertainment hall of , providing Video games for the athletes use and a communal rest space, plus a non-alcoholic bar. The village also included a plaza, where athletes were able to meet with friends and family. During the games There is a full list of the buildings and the athletes that stayed in them during the 2012 Olympics, and plaques in all East Village building foyers mark which countries stayed there. For example, the British team stayed in Calla House, Kotata House and Tayberry House; Greece in Hopground House; Spain in Carina House; Ukraine in Emperor House; Japan in Applegate House; Armenia, Peru and Slovenia in Calico House; Belgium, Cape Verde and Kyrgyzstan in Frye House; Costa Rica And Yemen in Galena House; And the Netherlands in Heinieken House. =After the Games= After the conclusion of the games, the Olympic housing was adapted to create a new residential quarter to be known as East Village. The new construction created 2,818 new homes, including 1,379 affordable homes and houses, for sale and rent. The wider community is planned with wide vistas filled with gardens, parks and communal areas, within which are to be housed a school, a health clinic and shops. Having sold the affordable homes to Triathlon Homes in 2009 for ¬£268 million, a competitive tender was issued in 2008 for ODA's interests in the remaining 1,439 private homes, along with six adjacent future development plots with the potential for a further 2,000 new homes, and long-term management of East Village. The ODA received three bids: a joint-venture between Jamie Ritblat's Delancey and Qatari Diar; Hutchison Whampoa; and Wellcome Trust, who bid to take over all the Olympic park. In August 2011, the ODA announced an agreement with Delancey/Qatari Diar, who paid ¬£557 million for the East Village site, representing an estimated ¬£275 million loss to the ODA and hence the British taxpayer. Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt commented that the ODA never expected to recoup building costs: \\"It was an entirely empty site, it didn't have any infrastructure, roads or parks. There was always going to be a public sector contribution to help put those in.\\" 393x393px Temporary partitions installed during the games are being removed to create a range of one to five-bed homes, ranging from apartments to townhouses. The hotel style designed rooms were converted to include kitchens. 1,439 private homes are let on a rental basis, instead of being sold, with the ownership remaining with Delancey/Qatari Diar and managed by Get Living London. This created the first UK private sector residential fund of over 1,000 homes to be owned and directly managed as an investment. In addition, the developers created new parklands and additional transport links. A health centre http://www.guttmann.nhs.uk/ for residents of East Village and the surrounding areas has also been constructed. Independent retailers have been brought in to East Village, which is now a neighbourhood in its own right. The developers also added Chobham Academy, a new education campus with 1,800 places for students aged 3‚Äì19. During the Olympics, the school building was used as the main base for organising and managing teams. Rebuilt after the games, it opened in September 2013 as Chobham Academy, home to an education campus, comprising nursery, primary and secondary schools; an adult learning facility; and a community arts complex. In July 2015 Chobham Academy was rated 'Outstanding' by OFSTED.http://www.chobhamacademy.org.uk/254/ofsted-report Transport Olympic and Paralympic Village, April 2012.

History and Working Model The Helping Hand was founded in 1987 by Robert Yeo, a Heroin addict. It is registered as a Voluntary Welfare Organization under the Singapore Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports with an Institution of Public Character Status. The organization aims to rehabilitate drug offenders through its stated method of 4 types of therapy - Spiritual, Work, Social and Physical. Drug offenders in therapy (called the Residents) typically undergo 3‚Äì6 months of treatment, during which they will receive individual and group counselling. Residents stay at The Helping Hand premises (located in Serangoon) throughout their therapy. Funding The Helping Hand receives operational cash primarily from sales from the furniture business that it operates. The prices are priced at 10 percent to 20 percent lower than the market rate.http://stqaprev.asia1.com.sg/Singapore/Story/STIStory_254239.html It can thus be defined as a social enterprise. Its premises at Serangoon serves as a warehouse where it showcases hundreds of Indonesian made Teak furniture to the public. The Helping Hand also gets income from its moving services. They hire Residents as workers for both services. It was reported in 2011 that even though more and more people are engaging its services, The Helping Hand still faces stigma from its businesses as most of its workers are ex-addicts. Side Ventures The Helping Hand also engages in many side ventures started by Residents. These services include computer repairs and gardening services. The main aim of these ventures is to help former offenders instead of generating profits. These ventures are usually started when Residents indicate interest in a certain business they wish to explore.

They rejected the war policies of the German Empire and the support which parliamentary representatives of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) gave to these policies. They also played a role during the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì19. Their leader Richard M√ºller stated its goal was a \\"council republic in the Russian style‚Äù.https://jacobinmag.com/2019/03/german- revolution-1919-strikes-uprising-democracy Background The SPD, at the time the largest workers' party in Europe, voted for war credits for the imperial government in 1914. Karl Liebknecht was initially the only SPD member of the Reichstag who publicly rejected the measure. He was absent for the vote in August and then voted against the measure in December 1914. With the split between the USPD and the \\"Majority\\" SPD there was a party in the Reichstag opposing the so-called policy of \\"party truce\\" (Burgfriedenspolitik) between the various political forces. The Stewards supported the USPD's outright opposition to the war.Ralf Hoffrogge, Working-Class Politics in the German Revolution. Richard M√ºller, the Revolutionary Shop Stewards and the Origins of the Council Movement, Brill Publications 2014, ., pp. 21-31. January 1918: Anti-war strike Since most of the union functionaries supported the political truce, the Stewards created an opposition of industrial workers against the First World War in Germany. This was in part a reaction to the growing number of deaths on the front and the growing social need at home. Their most important speakers were Richard M√ºller and Emil Barth. The Revolutionary Stewards were especially strongly represented in the Berlin armament industry. They had already had experience with strikes, including the protest strike against the imprisonment of Karl Liebknecht in summer 1916 and the wave of strikes centered on Braunschweig and Leipzig in January 1917.Ralf Hoffrogge, Working-Class Politics in the German Revolution. Richard M√ºller, the Revolutionary Shop Stewards and the Origins of the Council Movement, Brill Publications 2014, pp. 35-61. The Stewards were a crucial force in organizing the January Strike of 1918, which was centred on Berlin, the Ruhr, Saxony, Hamburg and Kiel and in which strikers demanded the end of the war through a negotiated peace and a democratisation of the empire. They were in part inspired by the success achieved by the Bolsheviks under Lenin and Trotsky in the Russian October Revolution only a few months earlier. For this reason, the strikes were also directed against plans of annexation, which Central Powers Germany and Austria-Hungary were pursuing in ongoing peace negotiations with Soviet Russia in Brest-Litovsk. The strikers demanded fundamental political changes within Germany as well as a just peace agreement with Russia that did not include territorial claims by the German Empire against the \\"New Russia\\". These demands were not met by the Supreme Army Command (or Oberste Heeresleitung) and the imperial government of Chancellor Georg von Hertling. The strike was ended when the Oberste Heeresleitung declared an aggravated state of siege, put some factories under military protection and conscripted many of the striking workers for military service.

Spartacus Uprising, January 1919: barricade fighting in Berlin. =November 1918: revolution= In the early days of November 1918, the Revolutionary Stewards were one of the few political groups demanding an end to the monarchy. In addition, unlike the \\"Majority\\" SPD of Friedrich Ebert they were also in favour of \\"socialisation\\" of industries and government by workers' (and soldiers') councils rather than a parliamentary system. On 2 November 1918 there was a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Stewards, also attended by Liebknecht, which voted 21 to 19 against initiating revolutionary action on 4 November as the workers were not yet disposed to act. They settled on 11 November. In Berlin, the Stewards numbered around 80 to 100. The core group numbered only about a dozen. On 8 November, driven by events to accelerate their plan, the Stewards called for a general strike in Berlin on the next day. The Spartacists, the SPD and the unions supported the call. On 9 November, workers' and soldiers' councils were formed, the headquarters of police was occupied and hundreds of thousands of demonstrators converged on the city centre. Imperial Chancellor Max of Baden announced that Emperor Wilhelm II had abdicated and handed over his office to Friedrich Ebert. In the afternoon Ebert grudgingly asked the USPD to nominate three ministers for the future government. Yet that evening a group of several hundred followers of the Stewards occupied the Reichstag and held an impromptu debate. They called for the election of soldiers' and workers' councils the next day (one per battalion or 1,000 workers). They were to assemble at \\"Zirkus Busch\\" and elect a provisional revolutionary government‚Äîthe Rat der Volksbeauftragten. In order to keep control of events and against his own anti-revolutionary convictions, Ebert now decided that he needed to co-opt the workers' councils and thus‚Äîwhilst the formal head of government‚Äîalso become the leader of the revolution. On 10 November, the SPD, led by Ebert managed to ensure that a majority of the newly elected workers' and (especially) soldiers' councils came from among their own supporters. Meanwhile, the USPD agreed to work with him and share power in the Rat der Volksbeauftragten, the new revolutionary government. Ebert announced the pact between the two socialist parties to the assembled councils who were eager for a unified socialist front and approved the parity of three members each coming from SPD and USPD. However, the Stewards had anticipated that they would fail to prevent the SPD from dominating the Rat der Volksbeauftragten (\\"Council of the People's Deputies\\"). They thus called for an Executive Committee (Aktionsausschuss) of the workers' and soldiers' councils to be set up in parallel to the Rat der Volksbeauftragten and that would be under the control of the stewards. Its powers were to be left deliberately vague. Emil Barth, who was presiding over the assembly, then made a tactical error by giving a long-winded speech rather than moving directly to the vote. Listeners, including Ebert, were able to deduce the Stewards' intentions from what Barth said. Ebert made another speech, declaring that the committee was superfluous, but if it was to be set up, it must be made up equally of SPD and USPD just like the Rat der Volksbeauftragten. When Barth said that no SPD delegate must sit on the committee, the assembly exploded with protest, in particular from the soldiers' councils. After an interruption, the session continued and Barth announced an Executive Committee of 20 members: ten soldiers and ten workers. Half of the latter would be supporters of the SPD, half supporters of the Stewards. The soldiers's delegates were to be elected on 11 November. The Stewards had lost. =December 1918: congress of councils and Christmas crisis= From 16 to 21 December 1918, the Reichsr√§tekongress or Reichsversammlung der Arbeiter- und Soldatenr√§te (Congress of Workers' and Soldiers' Councils) met in Berlin inside the Prussian Landtag building. There was one delegate for every 200,000 citizens and 100,000 soldiers. Out of 514 delegates, around 300 came from the SPD, about 100 from the USPD (of which ten were Spartacists) and the rest were liberals, not associated with any party or members of independent revolutionary groups. The Congress took some important decisions (in each case with a broad majority): * It rejected a proposal by the USPD to retain the council system as the basis for a socialist republic and to give the councils the supreme legislative and executive power * It approved a proposal by the SPD to vest legislative and executive power with the \\"Council of the People's Deputies\\" until a National Assembly could make more permanent arrangements. Moreover, the Executive Committee created on 10 November was replaced with a \\"Central Council\\" (Zentralrat). The latter was made up of SPD members only as the USPD boycotted its election because the new institution would have no legislative powers. * Elections for a National Assembly were set for 19 January 1919, the earliest possible date. However, the Congress also passed two resolutions that went against the interests of the SPD leadership. First, it called on the \\"Council of the People's Deputies\\" to begin immediately with the socialisation of all \\"suitable\\" industries, especially mining. Secondly, it approved the so-called Hamburger Punkte that called for the election of officers, for disciplinary power to lie with the soldiers' councils, no insignia of rank and no rank off-duty. However, these demands were anathema to the leadership of the military, in particular those relating to the position of the soldiers' councils vis-√†-vis the regular officer corps. These last two decisions of the Congress underscored a division regarding short-term changes to the economy, the bureaucracy and the military between a broad-based consensus across party lines of the democratic-socialist movement on the one hand, and the leadership of the SPD and the military on the other. The SPD members of the \\"Council of the People's Deputies\\" consequently dragged their feet over the implementation of these last two points, causing increasing resentment and anger among the labour movement and its more radical representatives like the Spartacists and the Stewards. On 29 December, the only representative of the Revolutionary Stewards, Emil Barth (also a member of the USPD) and two further representatives of the USPD finally left the \\"Council of the People's Deputies\\" in protest against the events of the Weihnachtsk√§mpfe (Skirmish of the Berlin Schloss), in which government troops were deployed against the Volksmarinedivision, a unit of leftist revolutionary soldiers established on 11 November 1918. The fighting caused many on the left to accuse the leadership of the SPD of having betrayed the revolution. Although the Revolutionary Stewards supported the idea of a council republic rather than a parliamentary democracy, they rejected the KPD, founded on 30/31 December 1918, which pursued the same goal. This was because the KPD was not ready to accept the five conditions set by Richard M√ºller on behalf of the Revolutionary Stewards: withdrawal of the anti-voting decision, a program committee with equal representation, condemnation of \\"putschism\\", taking part in party publicity and abandonment of the additional name \\"Spartacus League\\". =January 1919: January uprising= In the atmosphere of outrage created on the left by the military action against the Volksmarinedivision‚Äîwhich Liebknecht called \\"Eberts Blutweihnacht\\" (Ebert's Bloody Christmas)‚Äîthe Stewards were among the initiators of the so-called Spartakusaufstand (Spartacus Uprising) in January 1919. Emil Eichhorn, a member of the USPD and head of the Berlin police (Polizeipr√§sident), had refused to act against the revolting sailors during the Christmas crisis. Some of his men from the Sicherheitspolizei had even actively supported the uprising. Paul Hirsch, Prussian Minister of the Interior, thus dismissed Eichhorn on 4 January. Notwithstanding their differences, the Stewards, the USPD and the Spartacists called for a protest demonstration in support of Eichhorn. On 5 January 1919, around half a million people gathered at a mass demonstration in Berlin. Armed demonstrators stormed the Berlin newspaper quarter, where they occupied the editorial office of the SPD paper Vorw√§rts as well as other publishing buildings. The main railway stations were also seized. However, the force of the popular response caught the organizers by surprise. At a meeting at the police headquarters attended by 70 Stewards, ten members of the USPD led by Georg Ledebour, three representatives of the soldiers, Liebknecht and Karl Pieck for the KDP and Eichhorn. Caught up in the momentum of the hour, they lost sight of the real situation, overestimating the support for their actions from the military in the Berlin area. They voted 80 to six to topple the government. The Stewards' representative , Karl Liebknecht (KPD) and Georg Ledebour (USPD) now signed a proclamation demanding the toppling of Ebert's government. They wanted to prevent elections to the National Assembly and to continue with the revolution. A \\"provisionary revolutionary committee\\" was set up. It numbered 53 members, including Scholze, Liebknecht and Ledebour, and declared that it had taken over the government. Its only action, though, was to issue a call for another demonstration on the next day. The masses reassembled on Sunday, 6 January. However, no orders came from the revolutionary leaders. In isolated actions, the Reichsdruckerei and a telegraph office were seized. No one occupied the government buildings‚Äîwhilst some armed supporters of the Ebert government gathered around the Reichskanzlei. The masses started to disperse and by midnight the centre of Berlin had been vacated. During the day, the committee had relocated to the Marstall, the barracks of the Volksmarinedivision, but had been asked to leave and thus returned to the police headquarters. There they remained, when Ebert accepted mediation by those of the USPD who had left the \\"Council of the People's Deputies\\" in late December. Ebert had just one condition: the occupation of the newspapers must end. On 7 January, the revolutionary committee declined. Whilst negotiations continued, Ebert prepared for a military response. He made Gustav Noske, since the withdrawal of the USPD a member of the Rat der Volksbeauftragten, supreme commander of the Freikorps and rallied the regular troops of the Berlin area to his cause. On the orders of Ebert, government forces commanded by Gustav Noske crushed the uprising between 9 and 12 January. Its defeat came after intense struggles, especially around the Berlin police headquarters and the publishing building of Vorw√§rts, in which a reported 165 people lost their lives. The dead included several prisoners who were summarily executed, some after they had approached the government forces under a flag of truce. Decline of the Revolutionary Stewards The January uprising led to the dissolution of the Revolutionary Steward's network, because many of its members took part in the uprising while others such as Richard M√ºller opposed it. The organization of the Revolutionary Stewards dissolved, though many of its members continued to work in the council structures.Ralf Hoffrogge, Working-Class Politics in the German Revolution. Richard M√ºller, the Revolutionary Shop Stewards and the Origins of the Council Movement, Brill Publications 2014, ., pp. 100-108. The struggles, at times approaching the level of civil war, which took place in some regions of Germany in the following months put the council movement increasingly on the defensive. Various calls for regional council republics, for example in Bremen or, more famously, the Bavarian Soviet Republic, were finally suppressed with military force by regular armed forces and right-wing Freikorps troops by mid-1919. Under the Weimar Constitution which came into force in August 1919, the republic became a pluralistic parliamentary democracy. After the defeat of the council movement, the Revolutionary Stewards still had influence and called for and helped execute a general strike against the right-wing nationalist and anti-democratic Kapp Putsch of March 1920. The strike brought the economy to a virtual stand-still and, together with the refusal of the bureaucracy to cooperate with the new government, caused the putsch to fail in a matter of days. However, in some parts of Germany, the striking workers refused to return to work and offered armed resistance to the legitimate government of president Ebert and chancellor Bauer. The most significant of these events was the Ruhr Uprising, which was crushed by Reichswehr and Freikorps in April 1920. After 1920, the former Stewards did not play a notable role in the German labour movement any more. Many former activists became members of the KPD, especially after the KPD merged with the left wing of the USPD when the latter split at the end of 1920. Occasionally it operated under the alternate name \\"United Communist Party of Germany\\" (VKPD). Other Stewards remained in the USPD and future related groups, or joined the SPD again, after a part of the remaining USPD returned to the SPD in 1922. Towards the end of 1922, the core of the local structures of the USPD in Berlin, which continued to exist as a small party, was composed largely of former Revolutionary Stewards. Some Stewards who continued to follow a party-independent \\"antiauthoritarian\\" council model joined the anarcho-syndicalist Free Workers' Union of Germany (FAUD).

Although Ma'n fought against the Abbasid Revolution, he reconciled himself with the Abbasid regime and both he and his sons, Za'ida and Sharahil held governorships and high military posts. Yazid first served under Ma'n during the latter's governorship in Sistan, where Ma'n fell in battle against the local Kharijites in 769. Under Caliph al-Mahdi (), he fought against Yusuf al-Barm in Khurasan, and in 782 took part in the great campaign against the Byzantine Empire under the future Caliph Harun al- Rashid's (). Yazid accompanied al-Mahdi's eldest son and successor al-Hadi () to his governorship of Jurjan in 783/784. After al-Hadi became Caliph, Yazid supported him in his intention‚Äîultimately cut short by his death‚Äîto remove Harun from the succession in favour of al-Hadi's own son. Yazid's loyalty was rewarded by al-Hadi with his appointment to the governorship (ostikan) of Arminiya (a large province encompassing the whole of Transcaucasia), which he governed until 788/789. His rule was harsh towards the native Christian population, and he carried out large-scale colonization of the province, particularly at Shirvan, with Arab Muslims. He was also the first of a long line of Shaybanid ostikans, beginning with his sons, and hence the progenitor of the Mazyadid dynasty that ruled in Shirvan as autonomous and later independent emirs (Shirvanshahs) until 1027. After his tenure in Arminiya, Yazid was sent to combat a Kharijite rebellion led by the fellow-Shaybanid al- Walid ibn Tarif (795/796). Yazid succeeded in defeating and killing the rebel leader in battle, ending the uprising. Yazid was re-appointed as ostikan in 799, in time to face the last Khazar attack on the Caliphate's Caucasian provinces, which he defeated. He died in Armenia in 801, and was succeeded by his son Asad.

Name The name Studeno literally means 'spring', and it and similar forms (e.g., Studenec, Studenci) are relatively common toponyms for places in Slovenia associated with springs. It is derived from Slavic *studen—åc—å '(walled) spring', from the adjective *studen—ä 'cold'. Most of the German medieval attestations of such places contain the Bavarian Middle High German element prunne 'spring' (cf. Middle High German brunne). The standard German name of the village, Brunnsee, literally means 'lake/pond formed by a spring', probably referring to a spring that was walled to collect water. The Gottscheerish form Prunnsheab (and the clipped form Sheab) correspond to the standard German: prunn(le) 'spring' + ≈ü√©a(b) 'lake, sea' (in Karl Schr√∂er's transcription).Schr√∂er, Karl Julius. 1870.

The Lisbon Theatre and Film School (Escola Superior de Teatro e Cinema) of the Polytechnic Institute of LisbonWebsite inherited the function of the National Conservatoire, founded by Almeida Garrett, in 1836, and of teaching Film, introduced in the same establishment since 1971. The main goal of the Lisbon Theatre and Film School is training in the fields of Theatre and Cinema. Sometimes it is still referred to by its former designation \\"Conservat√≥rio Nacional\\". It is a public institution of higher education created in Lisbon but now located in Amadora, Portugal. History Almeida Garrett by Pedro Augusto Guglielmi. The Lisbon Theatre and Film School was set up in Lisbon by Decree-Law nr. 310/83, dated July 1 (1983). The object of this legal document was to reconvert the National Conservatoire (Conservat√≥rio Nacional), the establishment of artistic education, and the setting up of several new establishments offering degrees in the same artistic areas as the Conservat√≥rio, among which this school, specifically directed at theatre and film education. Theatre Education had a long tradition in the National Conservatoire: it went back to the date of its creation in 1836, by Decree of Queen Maria II, in the scope of a Plan for the foundation and organisation of a National Theatre proposed by Jo√£o Baptista de Almeida Garrett, then still called Conservat√≥rio Geral de Arte Dram√°tica and formed by three Schools: Escola Dram√°tica ou de Declama√ß√£o for drama education, Escola de M√∫sica for music education (integrating the former Conservat√≥rio de M√∫sica, set up in Casa Pia by Decree of 1835) and Escola de Dan√ßa, M√≠mica e Gin√°stica Especial for dance, mime arts and especial gymnastics education. Journal of Laws (Di√°rio do Governo) of November 17th, 1836. By later reforms, the name of the CNational Conservatoire was changed, first to Conservat√≥rio Real de Lisboa and then, already under the new republican regime, to Conservat√≥rio Nacional, the name of the Escola Dram√°tica ou de Declama√ß√£o being altered to Escola de Arte de Representar. On July 4, 1914, the School of Art of Acting (Escola de Arte de Representar) was for the first time granted management autonomy. By Decree dated May 19, 1914, the scenography and setting design degree was set up in this school (to be taught ‚Äúin the big paintings room of the National Theatre Almeida Garrett which, functioning under the Escola de Arte de Representar‚Äù, would exclusively ‚Äúbe at the service andpractices of the corresponding teacher‚Äù); by Decree of August 6, 1914, the costume designer degree was also set up. As for Film Education, the corresponding degree was only set up in National Conservatoire after 1971, on a pedagogic experimental basis, in the scope of the reform process undertaken by Madalena Perdig√£o, in the time of Minister Veiga Sim√£o. By that time, the Pilot School for the Formation of Film Professionals (Escola Piloto para a Forma√ß√£o de Profissionais de Cinema) was created and its first degree initiated in 1973. From the beginning, a deep concern of this school has been to complement the technical knowledge necessary to cinema-linked professions with a more artistic component. The degree being offered today by the Department of Film of the Lisbon Theatre and Film School has gone through an evolution since 1973 but its philosophy is still the same as that of the first degree which, it should be stressed, was very much of a pioneer in Portuguese public higher education. By governmental Decree nr. 46/85, of November 22 (1985), the Lisbon Theatre and Film School - that had so far been under the Directorate General of Higher Education (Direc√ß√£o-Geral do Ensino Superior) and, since 1983, managed by an Organisation Committee formed by Professors Jorge Synek Listopad, President, and Jos√© Bogalheiro, member ‚Äì was integrated in the Polytechnic Institute of Lisbon (IPL), a public polytechnic higher education establishment created by Decree-Law nr. 513-T/79, of December 26 (1979). The Lisbon Theatre and Film School became then an organic unit of the Polytechnic Institute of Lisbon, still in a process of internal organisation by the mentioned Committee until the publication of its Statutes in Journal of Laws (Di√°rio da Rep√∫blica), 2nd series, nr. 15, of January 18, 1995. When totally new premises were built in Amadora, within the greater Lisbon area, for the Lisbon Theatre and Film School(the first building ever constructed in Portugal specifically to host a public artistic higher education establishment), it was finally possible to move from the old Caetanos' Convent (Convento dos Caetanos), in Lisbon, where Almeida Garrett¬¥s Conservat√≥rio Geral de Arte Dram√°tica had provisionally functioned, to modern premises designed to have adequate teaching rooms, studios, performing areas, library and cafeteria, all of which offer the best working conditions for its students. The bi-departmental structure of the School, a historical heritage from the previous schools of Theatre and of Film of the National Conservatoire, led to a certain pedagogic-scientific autonomy granted to the two Departments, according to the Statutes. The Lisbon Theatre and Film School has steadily been asserting itself as a reference school both at national and international level, and it has been integrated in relevant international organisations dealing not only with the specific areas concerned, like the International Theatre Institute (ITI), the CILECT ‚Äì Centre International de Liaison des √âcoles de Cinema et de Tel√©vision, but also with Arts in general, which is the case of ELIA ‚Äì European League of Institutes of the Arts. This international cooperation concern also led to efforts made to strengthen the School¬¥s active participation in teacher and student intercourse programmes, within specific programmes, like the Socrates/Erasmus and the Leonardo da Vinci, as well as bilateral agreements with Universities of Latin America (Brazil, Argentina, Mexico). The objectives of the Lisbon Theatre and Film School, according to its Statutes, are: Training of highly qualified professionals; research activities; artistic experiments and production; launching or participation in development projects; community involvement. To consistently fulfil these objectives, the School has adjusted its educational provision to the Bologne Process, its two Departments offering first and second level Degrees (Graduation and Master); it set up a Research Centre which is developing projects in partnership with a similar Centre in University of Algarve; it participates in educational development programmes at local level, as for instance the programme for curriculum improvement activities in public basic schools in the Amadora municipality, and annually produces and organises, in its own premises as well as in Theatres, Museums, Cinemas and other public spaces, numbers of performances and exhibitions of its students¬¥ dramatic and cinema practical works, attendance to all events being free to the community.

The German name D√ºrnbach also literally means 'dry creek' and may be compared to similar names in Carinthia, such as the hamlet of D√ºrnfeld in the Municipality of Magdalensberg. History Suhi Potok was a Gottschee German village. According to the Koƒçevje land registry of 1574, the village had four full farms divided into eight half-farms,Savnik, Roman, ed. 1971. Krajevni leksikon Slovenije, vol. 2. Ljubljana: Dr≈æavna zalo≈æba Slovenije, p. 245. corresponding to between 45 and 55 inhabitants. In 1770 there were 12 houses in the village.Schr√∂er, Karl Julius. 1870. W√∂rterbuch der Mundart von Gottschee. Vienna: K. u. k. Staatsdruckerei, p. 76. In 1937 the village had 13 houses and a population of 54.Krajevni leksikon Dravske Banovine. 1937. Ljubljana: Zveza za tujski promet za Slovenijo, p. 219. During the Second World War most of the village was burned down, leaving only two (out of 13) houses and the 18th-century Saint Andrew's Church. After the war, the Koƒçevje collective farm and forestry company took over management of the village's fields and pastures. Church Saint Andrew's Church A chapel of ease dedicated to Saint Andrew was built in the village in 1758 based on the plans for the parish church in Mozelj. A previous church stood at the site as early as the 17th century, indicated also by a missal from 1641. The now-abandoned church has a single nave and a bell-gable. Saint Andrew's Church is located on the edge of the village and is registered as cultural heritage.Slovenian Ministry of Culture register of national heritage reference number e≈°d 2808 The original structure was mentioned by Johann Weikhard von Valvasor in 1689, who stated that it had three altars. After the Second World War, when Suhi Potok was nearly abandoned, the church was used as a barn, after which it started to deteriorate. The originally wooden shingled roof was replaced with a tiled roof in the fall of 2006 to prevent further deterioration of the building.\\"Suhi potok: Podru≈æniƒçna cerkev sv.

Gosz's music featured the Bohemian brass style and appealed to the many ethnic groups (Dutch, Bohemian, Belgian, German and Polish) found throughout the region.  History  Romy Gosz was born on August 2, 1910 in Grimms, Wisconsin to Paul and Anna Gosz, the fourth of their seven children. At age 7, Gosz would take his first and only piano lesson. When he told his piano teacher he would not be able to make his next lesson because he had a dance job, he was told \\"not to come back at all if you can play a job with one lesson\\".http://images.library.wisc.edu/WI/EFacs/MTWCImages/OccSeries/Monograph28/reference/wi.monograph28.i0001.pdf Robert Janda, \\"Entertainment Tonight: An Account of Bands in Manitowoc County Since 1900\\", pg. 6 When he was 11, Gosz joined his father Paul and his older brother's, George and Mike, in forming the Paul Gosz Orchestra. Their first job was playing at a silver wedding anniversary in Newton, Wisconsin. The very next night, they played a golden anniversary at the J.D. Prokash hall in Rockwood, Wisconsin and the night after that, the group played a sixtieth wedding anniversary dance.Don Dornbrook, \\"Wisconsin's Romy Gosz is the King of the Polka\\", Milwaukee Journal, April 9, 1945, Green Sheet pg. 1 A few years later, Gosz's father Paul decided to work more at his day job at the local lime kiln, Allwood Lime Company, and he handed the management of the family orchestra over to George. By 1928, leadership of the group had passed to Romy, who was barely eighteen at the time. Still a minor, Gosz was unable to conduct business and manage the band legally, so he retained his father's name for the group. Early on, Gosz determined that his group should focus on the making of records and live performances. He thought that playing over the radio on a regular basis would be detrimental to the band's traveling and the resulting opportunity to interact with their audiences.Victor Greene, \\"A Passion for Polka: Old-Time Ethnic Music in America\\", 1992, p. 165 On July 5, 1929, Gosz married Antoinette Leggio at St. Ann Catholic Church in Francis Creek, Wisconsin, the same parish where he had attended school as a boy. The couple took up residence in a small home that Gosz and his father built in Rockwood. Over the next seven years, the couple would have five children (four sons and one daughter). In 1948, Gosz purchased a home with an adjacent Tavern and Dance Hall at \\"Polifka's Corners\\" (the intersection of Manitowoc County Road T and Polifka Road) near Kellnersville. Gosz and his orchestra cut their first record in 1930 at the Broadway studio in Grafton, Wisconsin. They recorded an old Bohemian tune called . Gosz commented that they did it \\"just to see what the band sounded like.\\" The recording of \\"Pilsen Polka\\" became a bestseller throughout the decade and was key to building Gosz's popularity. Later that same year, the band donated its services for the diamond jubilee celebration of St. Mary's Catholic church in Tisch Mills, Wisconsin. When the pastor, Father Rudolph James Hodik, went to Rome the following year for an audience with Pope Pius XI, he presented the pontiff with some of Gosz's recordings. Father Hodik returned home with a papal blessing for Gosz and the band. The papal blessing and a picture of Pope Pius were some of Gosz's proudest possessions and were displayed prominently in the Gosz home.Scottie Dayton, \\"Romy Gosz - The Man with the Golden Trumpet\\", Wisconsin Newmonth, November/December 1997, pg. 7 In 1931 Gosz found himself without a trumpet player. Gosz commented, \\"I knew where I could get a good pianist, but couldn't find a trumpet player, so I changed from piano to trumpet. I taught myself. In six months we made a recording with me double tonguing on the trumpet.\\" The Wisconsin American Legion was searching for a musical theme for its 1934 convention, when somebody heard Gosz's \\"The Prune Song\\". It was immediately adopted as the convention theme. Originally an old Bohemian waltz called \\"Sveskova Alej\\", Gosz increased the song's tempo and added some double tonguing to the trumpet part. This is typical of many of his recordings. Today, the song is known as \\"We Left Our Wives Back Home\\"Romy Gosz His recordings \\"Musical Clock\\" and \\"Picnic In The Woods\\" appeared in early country music charts printed by Billboard Magazine. By 1940, Gosz's band was very popular with the general Wisconsin audiences. It was around this time that a Sheboygan, Wisconsin radio station polled listeners for their favorite bandleader. In the one-week poll Gosz placed first, with a margin of seven hundred votesEleanor Steinert, \\"Pride of the Polka Belt\\", Coronet magazine, November 1945, pg. 100 over the second-place finisher, western bandleader, Gene Autry.Victor Greene, \\"A Passion for Polka: Old-Time Ethnic Music in America\\", 1992, p. 166 The national press soon took note of Gosz's popularity, with articles appearing in Billboard, Coronet, Life, Pic, and Time.\\"King of the Polka,\\" Time magazine, June 25, 1945, p. 45 On June 9, 1948, Gosz took part in a battle of the bands at the Milwaukee Arena. Competing against Louis Bashell, Lawrence Duchow, Harold Loeffelmacher and the Six Fat Dutchmen, Whoopee John Wilfahrt, and Frankie Yankovic. At the event's conclusion, the title of \\"America's Polka King\\" was awarded to Yankovic. At their peak, Gosz and his bands were on the road six nights a week, returning home for a noon radio show on Sunday and then playing a park concert, picnic, or festival in the afternoon. The band would perform from 8:00pm to 1:00am, at a pace of up to fourteen songs per hour. At the end of the night, Gosz often played up to five encores. When asked about his schedule, Gosz said, \\"We're a tough bunch around here. We have to be. We recently played 52 consecutive nights and not one of my men missed a day on his regular job.\\" Gosz spent the majority of his travels in Wisconsin, playing a circuit of towns that included: Batavia, Bonduel, Denmark, Embarrass, Freedom, Jericho, Kimberly, Krok, Luxemburg, Poland, Pulaski, Royalton, Scandinavia, Slovan, Sobieski, Sugar Bush, Symco, Waterloo, and Zachow.Eleanor Steinert, \\"Pride of the Polka Belt\\", Coronet magazine, November 1945, pg. 98 Less frequently, Gosz played in Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska and the Dakotas. Gosz handled all of his own bookings, and not being the most attentive businessman, he often double-booked his gigs. Whenever this happened, Gosz would hire a pickup band and play one engagement, and he would send his orchestra to work the other.  Death  In the latter half of August 1966, Gosz was admitted to Manitowoc Memorial Hospital to undergo gallbladder surgery. During the operation, surgeons determined that they could not complete the surgery because the gall bladder was too badly infected. This resulted in further complications, including the onset of pneumonia. All of this transpired during the week of the Manitowoc County Fair. Gosz's following was so great, it is reported that when his death was announced on August 29 to the fairgoers, the grounds were absolutely silent. The day of his funeral, over twenty-three hundred people filed by his coffin, paying their respects. Sometime after, a fan commented that, \\"When he lived, the dance floor was filled with happy people. When he died - standing room only. The church was full.\\"http://images.library.wisc.edu/WI/EFacs/MTWCImages/OccSeries/Monograph28/reference/wi.monograph28.i0001.pdf Robert Janda, \\"Entertainment Tonight: An Account of Bands in Manitowoc County Since 1900\\", pg. 8 Romy Gosz was buried in the church cemetery of the St. Ann Catholic Church in Francis Creek, Wisconsin.

The album was Gatton's fifth, but his first on a major record label‚ÄîElektra. The instrumental album covers a number of genres, including jazz, country, rockabilly, and blues. Background When Gatton signed to Elektra, their only stipulation for his first album on the label was that it should be solely instrumental. On presenting his ideas for the album to the label, they suggested he cut his version of the Simpsons theme tune. The manualist flatulence at the end of the recording may have been Gatton's response to the label's suggestion. The album's title, 88 Elmira St., is a reference to Gatton's home as a child. Gatton stated that at the time of producing the album, he \\"was playing Scotty Moore's original guitar [...] It's a Gibson ES-295, and I bought it trashed out twelve years ago. It sounded incredibly good; it had some magic in it, but I didn't know it was Scotty's. Then Billy Hancock kept offering me all kinds of money for it, way more than it should have been worth, so I said, 'What's the deal?' He said, 'I think you've got Scotty Moore's guitar there.'\\" Similarities to Moore, Al Casey and James Burton can be heard on the album. Recording The album was produced by Gatton, Billy Windsor and Ian Kimmet, recorded and mixed by George Cowan at Bearsville Studios in Woodstock, NY and mastered by Bob Ludwig at Masterdisk. The album was recorded at Bearsville Studios, New York and Big Mo Studio, Maryland. =Equipment= On the album, Gatton used a 1990 Fender Telecaster (his signature version with Joe Barden pickups), a Fender acoustic, a Martin D-28-32, a 1954 Gibson ES 295, a Gibson RB800 5 string banjo, a 1950 Fender 6-string lap steel, and a 1958 5-string Fender Precision Bass.

It was written for the Round Table Conference on Congolese independence held in Brussels, Belgium in 1960 which gave the song its name.  History  In December 1959 it was announced that a round table conference would be held in Brussels, Belgium in 1960 to discuss the future of the Belgian Congo. Joseph Kabasele's L'African Jazz and OK Jazz were both invited to perform at the event. Only two musicians from OK Jazz were able to attend, so they briefly performed with L'African Jazz. Kabasele took part in the conference, and collaborated with his musicians to produce some songs to commemorate the event. The most notable of these were \\"Table Ronde\\" and \\"Ind√©pendance Cha Cha\\". While \\"Ind√©pendance Cha Cha\\" was celebratory, \\"Table Ronde\\" was more assertive for the cause of Congolese independence. It featured a guitar solo by Nico Kasanda. The song marked a new shift in Congolese popular music away from a care-free attitude towards militant politics. During the conference the group recorded their two compositions (along with a piece by OK Jazz vocalist Victor Longomba, \\"Vive Patrice Lumumba\\") in a His Master's Voice‚Äìaffiliated studio. The record label was not interested in the recordings, so Kabasele showed the masters to various other companies before reaching an agreement with Fonior.  Impact and legacy  Musician Gilles Sala later said that Table Ronde and the other songs released with it \\"sent a musical shock wave. It was pretty extraordinary, this spontaneous, natural music.\\" Table Ronde is performed in one of the scenes of the 2000 film Lumumba, directed by Raoul Peck.

The boat had a complement of between forty-four and sixty. Service history The submarine was laid down on 25 February 1942 at the Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft yard at Kiel as yard number 665, launched on 4 November and commissioned on 19 December under the command of Oberleutnant zur See Goske von M√∂llendorf. After training with the 5th U-boat Flotilla at Kiel, U-235 was transferred to the 22nd flotilla on 29 October 1943, following her sinking in May by US bombs in Kiel. She had been raised, repaired and returned to service. She was reassigned to the 31st U-boat Flotilla on 2 April 1945, less than two weeks before her second sinking. Loss On April 14, 1945, U-235 was heading to Norway with when they encountered a small German convoy accompanied by the torpedo boat T17. All vessels had not been warned of the others' presence. But the convoy had been warned that a British submarine was in the area. U-1272 dived deep and out of trouble, but U-235 surfaced, possibly to identify herself and then as if changing her mind, also dived. T17 attacked, dropping depth charges. Any celebration on T17 was abruptly stilled when amongst the wreckage appearing were bodies in Kriegsmarine uniform. Forty-six men died; there were no survivors.

Within the diocese it is better known as Saint Stan's. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 as Church of St. Stanislaus‚ÄìCatholic and was designated as a Minor Basilica of the Roman Catholic Church on November 10, 2011 by Pope Benedict XVI. History of Saint Stanislaus Kostka Parish The Basilica of Saint Stanislaus Kostka, circa 1900. Courtesy, Polish Museum, Winona MN The congregation dates back to April 2, 1871, when leaders of Winona's Kashubian Polish community formally declared its intent to organize a parish under the patronage of St. Stanislaus Kostka. Prior to this they had been attending Mass at either the \\"Irish\\" (Saint Thomas) or the \\"German\\" (Saint Joseph) Catholic church, but they wished to worship in their own language and to be led by a Kashubian or Polish pastor. Accordingly, a small wooden sanctuary was constructed at the corner of Fourth and Carimona Streets in 1872. From its very beginning, the new Saint Stanislaus Kostka Parish served as the religious and the civic center for Winona's Kashubian Poles. The first permanent pastor was the Reverend Joseph Juskiewicz, who was succeeded in January 1875 by the Reverend Alexander Michnowski. In 1875, the Reverend Jan Romuald Byzewski (1842‚Äì1905), a Kashubian-born Franciscan forced to emigrate from German Poland due to the Kulturkampf, arrived and served as pastor until 1890. Winona grew rapidly during the 1880s and 1890s, and the continuation of the Kashubian diaspora played a major part of this population boom. By 1893, Saint Stanislaus Kostka Parish had completely outgrown its old sanctuary. Creation of a satellite Polish parish on Winona's West End was considered; indeed, such a parish, Saint Casimir, would be established in 1906. The congregation was bitterly divided on the question of whether to build a new church or expand the old. But as a matter of religious and civic pride, the parishioners of Saint Stanislaus Kostka decided to build a larger, grander 1800-seat structure on the site of their present church. The Basilica of Saint Stanislaus Kostka left The Basilica of Saint Stanislaus Kostka was designed during the winter of 1893‚Äì4 in the Polish Cathedral Style (it has also been attributed to the Romanesque style) by the Winona architectural firm of C.G. Maybury and Son, which had also designed Sacred Heart-Saint Wenceslaus Church in nearby Pine Creek, Wisconsin. The old church was demolished in the spring of 1894, under the direction of then-pastor Reverend Antoni Klawiter. While the new one was built, the parishioners worshiped in the nearby Bohemian parish of Saint John Nepomucene. The foundation stone was laid by the new pastor, Reverend Jakub W.J. Pacholski, on October 28, 1894. The Basilica was dedicated on Thanksgiving Day November 28, 1895, by the Most Reverend Joseph B. Cotter, Bishop of Winona. From the very beginning, the Basilica's great golden dome dominated the skyline of Winona, testifying to the piety and thrift of the Kashubian Polish community which built it at the then-exorbitant cost of $86,000. Interior of the Basilica decorated for Christmas The Basilica's interior has undergone many changes over time. It is adorned with beautiful stained glass windows dedicated to various saints and devotions particularly cherished by Kashubian Poles, with inscriptions in Polish. On Thanksgiving Day 1920 the parish celebrated the Basilica's dedication by consecrating a massive marble altar with a canopy supported by marble pillars. New sanctuary furniture, new confessionals, and a pipe organ were installed by Reverend Pacholski's successor as pastor, the Reverend Jozef Cieminski (a parishioner in his youth) ‚Äì along with landscaping of the entire church property. Some of the Basilica's original furnishings, along with many contemporary furnishings preserved from other churches in the diocese, can be viewed at the nearby Polish Cultural Institute and Museum. Umbrella indicating status as a basilica At 7:40 pm on Sunday, June 5, 1966, lightning from a severe electrical storm struck the Basilica's dome. According to the parish's Centennial History,St. Stanislaus Parish 1871-1971, Winona: privately published, 1971. the dome turned bright red when the lightning bolt struck and flames burst out the windows from the wooden framework inside. After costly and expensive repairs were performed, the Basilica was re-opened on Sunday, December 11, 1966. The Basilica's exterior was once more washed and renovated in preparation for the parish's centennial anniversary celebration on May 15‚Äì16, 1971. From 1991 to 1992 another extensive renovation project resulted in the main dome and towers being covered in metal.Saint Stanislaus Kostka Basilica/St. John Nepomucene parish website The seating capacity is now 1085 people, due to numerous renovations over the years. The Basilica was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 for having local significance in the theme of architecture. It was nominated for its fine architecture, a prominent manifestation of what was for decades Minnesota's largest Polish American community. Saint Stanislaus Kostka Parish School Founded in the early 1880s by Reverend Byzewski, the first Saint Stanislaus Kostka School was a one-room frame building. Classes were taught by the first parish organist, Dominik Hamerski. The school was gradually expanded to six rooms and on September 5, 1887 it was placed in the charge of the School Sisters of Notre Dame. A substantial brick convent was built for the Sisters soon afterward, to the east of the Basilica. By 1903 almost 700 students were enrolled in grades one through six, necessitating a new school to be built immediately south of the Basilica, completed in 1905. In 1966 this school building was demolished and a modern school building built in its place. This modern school building continues to serve Saint Stanislaus Elementary School to this day.

Vile noted that the original track \\"was written when I only had a couple of lines I thought were good ‚Äì my brother and I kind of jammed that song out together, to be honest. It was a sketch, but it just had a lot of vibe to it. This was before I had anything out yet, so it didn't matter what was where. I would switch lines out to see where they worked. I loved that stuff in The Fall; Mark E. Smith had all these recurring characters, like the Hip Priest, in his lyrics. He would come up different narrative concepts and recurring themes.

It is a simple aliphatic nitrile. The compound is a colourless, water-soluble liquid. It is used as a solvent and a precursor to other organic compounds. Production The main industrial route to this nitrile is the hydrogenation of acrylonitrile. It is also prepared by the ammoxidation of propanol (propionaldehyde can also be used instead):Peter Pollak, G√©rard Romeder, Ferdinand Hagedorn, Heinz-Peter Gelbke \\"Nitriles\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. :CH3CH2CH2OH + O2 \\\\+ NH3 ‚Üí CH3CH2CN + 3 H2O Propionitrile is a byproduct of the electrodimerisation of acrylonitrile to adiponitrile. In the laboratory propanenitrile can also be produced by the dehydration of propionamide, by catalytic reduction of acrylonitrile, or by distilling ethyl sulfate and potassium cyanide. Applications Propionitrile is a solvent similar to acetonitrile but with a slightly higher boiling point. It is a precursor to propylamines by hydrogenation. It is a C-3 building block in the preparation of the drug flopropione by the Houben-Hoesch reaction. Safety Propanenitrile is poisonous but weakly with an LD50 of 230 mg/kg (rats, oral). Propanenitrile has been determined to be teratogenic due to the metabolic release of cyanide. In 1979, the Kalama (Vega) plant in Beaufort, South Carolina experienced an explosion during the production of propanenitrile by nickel-catalyzed reduction of acrylonitrile.First Five-Year Review Report for Kalama Specialty Chemicals, Beaufort, Beaufort County, South Carolina, United States Environmental Protection Agency This site is now one of the two Superfund cleanup sites in South Carolina.

HORTON 2,427,676 Because of their distinctive form, some have become subject to conservation campaigns such as that at Poughkeepsie NY.Central Hudson Gas and Electric Horton Sphere, Poughkeepsie Construction and use Hortonspheres at Karlsruhe MiRO petroleum refinery Initially, Hortonspheres were constructed by riveting together separate wrought iron or steel plates, but from the 1940s, were of welded construction. The plates are formed in roller plants and cut to patterns. CBI accounts for a large proportion of spherical pressure vessels in the world. They are used extensively for LPG, as well as for other volatile gasses. CBI identifies the following uses: gasoline, anhydrous ammonia, vinyl chloride monomer (VCM), naphtha, propane, propylene, ethane, butane, NGL and butadiene. Cryogenic storage is also possible for LNG, methane, ethylene, hydrogen, and oxygen. Gases that may be stored include hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, helium and argon. Other uses have been applied to the Hortonsphere including space chambers, hyperbaric chambers, environmental chambers, vacuum vessels, process vessels, test vessels, containment vessels and surge vessels.

C. Tirulokchandar. The film stars Ravichandran and Kanchana. It focuses on a girl's family being stalked by a masked murderer, and her lover's attempts to apprehend him. Athey Kangal was produced by A. V. Meiyappan under Balasubramanian & Co, a subsidiary of his company AVM Productions. It was simultaneously filmed in Telugu as Ave Kallu. The film was released on 26 May 1967 and became a major box-office success.  Plot  A woman finds her husband just murdered. The masked murderer tries to kill her too but fails, and he escapes. The woman is left in a state of shock and becomes mentally paralysed. A murder case is registered and the investigation takes place. Susi, a college girl, comes home for vacation with her friends. She lives with her three younger paternal uncles ‚Äì the murdered man, Kamalanathan and Vimalanathan ‚Äì and her aunt, the murdered man's wife. Susi's parents had died years ago. A series of murders take place at Susi's house with every time a smoking cigar bit being left by the murderer intentionally. Police suspect the visiting doctor, a Siddha doctor close to Kamalanathan's family, butler, et cetera. Since Susi's aunt is the only eyewitness of the murderer, her life is in danger. Despite tight protection, she is killed by him. The murderer frequently calls Susi and threatens that her time is up and he is nearing her to kill her. Susi is frustrated by the incidents at her home and the threatening phone calls. Her lover Baskar promises to help. Baskar investigates Vimalanathan, and later Kamalanathan; he follows him to a strange house and a woman who wanders like a ghost. She is actually Kamalanathan's lover, who was rescued some years back by him when she attempted suicide. Kamalanathan keeps quiet as he wants Susi to get married first, then only marry his lover. Baskar sends everyone out of Susi's house for a night to lure the murderer. As expected, he enters Susi's room to kill her. Baskar fights and tries to unmask the murderer, managing only to retrieve his mask and see his eyes before he escapes. Baskar finds Vimalanathan murdered at the doorstep. Kamalanathan and Susi plan to vacate the house after celebrating Susi's birthday party. On the day of the party, the murderer attacks. Baskar chases him but loses track. He sees the Siddha doctor injured at a place who claims that the murderer attacked him and fled. No one knows why the murders are happening and who kills every member of their family. The Siddha doctor urges Kamalanathan to tell about his family which might help him find the identity of the murderer. Kamalanathan reveals that his father had an extramarital affair with a woman and they had a son. But the woman and her ten-year-old son died fifteen years ago, in a fire set by Kamalanathan's elder brother (Susi's father). Baskar theorises that the son may not have died and is actually the murderer killing the family members as revenge; he concludes that the murderer is present in the hall where all are gathered. Baskar places the murderer's mask on the faces of all the men in the hall to verify whose eyes match with the murderer's eyes, ultimately exposing the \\"Siddha doctor\\" as the illegitimate son and therefore the murderer. Baskar chases the murderer who gets injured trying to escape; while he is struggling to run, the police shoots him and he disappears suddenly. Everyone finds a secret room beneath the garden which leads to the Siddha doctor's house, and find the murderer lying dead due to the gunshot; everyone figures out that this is how he escaped after committing each murder. Baskar later marries Susi, while Kamalanathan marries his lover.  Cast  ;Male cast * Ravichandran as Baskar * S. A. Ashokan as Kamalanathan * Nagesh as Bhaskar's friend * S. V.

Meiyappan of AVM Productions wanted to produce a thriller in Tamil inspired by the films of Alfred Hitchcock, and made in colour. Director A. C. Tirulokchandar said he had a detective story ready, and it was launched as the film Athey Kangal. It was produced by Meiyappan under Balasubramanian & Co, a subsidiary of AVM. The assistant producers were M. Saravanan, M. Balasubramanian and M. S. Guhan. The dialogue was written by T. N. Balu, cinematography was handled by S. Maruti Rao, and editing by R. G. Gope. Ravichandran was cast as the male lead Bhaskar, and Kanchana as the female lead Susila. It was simultaneously filmed in Telugu as Ave Kallu. The final cut of the film measured .  Soundtrack  The soundtrack was composed by Vedha and the lyrics were written by Vaali. The song \\"Ethanai Azhagu\\" is based on \\"Pedal Pusher\\" by The Ventures, and \\"Boom Boom Maattukaran\\" is based on \\"Chim Chim Cher-ee\\" from Mary Poppins (1964). For the song \\"Pombale Oruthi Irundaalaam\\", singers A. L. Raghavan and T. M. Soundararajan came up with some lines in Saurashtra, their mother tongue. The words \\"Sodija\\" and \\"Daakara\\" in the song sound like some gibberish that Bhaskar's friend uses to frighten Susila, but in Saurashtra the words mean \\"Let me go\\" and \\"I am afraid\\".  Release and reception  Athey Kangal was released on 26 May 1967, and became a major box-office success upon release. Film historian Randor Guy praised it for the \\"tight narration and deft direction of ACT, and the impressive performances of the cast\\".

In 1970 he was arrested, accused of treasonous dealings with rebels, and sentenced to death by a military tribunal. His sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment, of which he served five years before the President ordered his release. After being released he moved to Rome and then to Canada, where he spent the rest of his life. Early career Albert Ndongmo was born on 26 September 1926 in Bafou, French Cameroons, near Dschang, to a Christian family of Bamil√©k√© people. On 19 September 1940 he entered the small seminary at Melong, against the wishes of his parents. In January 1947 he was admitted to the large seminary at Mvoly√©. A year later Castor Osend√© Afana came to the Mvoly√© seminary, and the two became close friends. Ndongmo was ordained on 21 December 1955 at Nkongsamba. He was appointed chaplain of the Nkongsamba diocese in 1959. On 15 March 1960, Ndongmo launched the journal L'Essor des jeunes to impart Christian values to young people. With this journal, Ndongmo wanted to provide a forum for open debate of contemporary problems. He saw freedom of expression as the cornerstone of an integrated system of political, social, personal and intellectual belief, and attempted to use the journal for this purpose, although he was forced to work within a very limited budget. The journal was stamped with Ndongmo's personality. He used it, and his \\"ecclesiastical immunity\\" to ignore the censors and criticize the regime. In April 1970 the archbishop Jean Zoa wanted to move L'Essor to Yaound√© and to make it a monthly Catholic journal for young people throughout the country. Although he agreed in principle with the need for a national journal, Ndongmo resisted the move and the change was not implemented. The regime viewed L'Essor des Jeunes as a subversive publication, particularly when it occasionally printed Ndongmo's pastoral letters, or extracts from his sermons, and suppressed it after arresting Ndongmo in 1970. After Cameroon gained independence in 1960, Union of the Peoples of Cameroon (UPC) rebels who had been fighting the French colonial government continued to fight the government of President Ahmadou Ahidjo, whom they considered to be a puppet of the French. Ahidjo had asked the French to lend troops to keep the peace during and after the transition to democracy. Led by General Max Briand, who had served previously in Algeria and Indochina, these troops conducted a brutal \\"cleansing\\" campaign in the Bamil√©k√© territory of the West, Centre and Littoral provinces. By some reports, over a quarter of a million people died. The rebel leader Ernest Ouandi√©, a Bamil√©k√© like Ndongmo, refused to recognise Ahidjo and continued guerilla warfare. The diocese of Nkongsamba was in the main combat zone. Bishop of Nkongsamba Ndongmo was named Bishop of Nkongsamba on 16 June 1964, was consecrated bishop on 16 August that year and was enthroned the same day by Archbishop Jean Zoa. He succeeded Paul Bouque in this position. He was the first local bishop of Nkongsamba, which at that time included the whole Bamil√©k√© area. In the later part of 1965 he attended the third and fourth sessions of the fourth period of the Second Vatican Council in Rome. He made an oral intervention on \\"the ministry and sacerdotal life of priests\\" on 16 October 1965. The intervention was incomplete, since his was the sixteenth and last of the session and he did not have time to conclude it. Cardinal Lercaro, moderating the session, politely invited him to submit his observations to the Secretariat in writing. He submitted a written intervention on \\"Christological, ecclesiological and anthropological foundations of the missionary activity of the Church\\". Ndongmo was thought to have personal political ambitions, perhaps even aspiring to the presidency. He understood and to some extent agreed with the UPC since he too was opposed to the dictatorial regime, although he did not support the revolutionary guerrilla movement. He sympathized with the Bamil√©k√© insurgents but accepted that the region need peace in order to develop economically. It was reported that he visited Algers from May to June 1968 to ask for funds for the UPC from the Algerian government. Such a trip could not have been reconciled with his pastoral duties. He may have served as a postbox, passing communications between the local and exiled branches of the UPC. His statements on political subjects earned him the hostility of others in the church as well as of the government. According to Ndongmo, in 1965 President Ahidjo asked him to try to mediate with Ernest Ouandi√©, now the last active rebel leader, to try to end the fighting. In the following years Ndongmo had a series of meetings with the rebels. In July or August 1970 Ouandi√© called for help, and Ndongmo picked him up in his car and took him to his own house, where he let him stay for several nights. Ndongmo claimed that his actions were consistent with President Ahidjo's instructions. Possibly, Ndongmo was being used as bait to capture Ouandi√©. Charges and imprisonment On 11 August 1970 Ndongmo wrote to Le Monde to contradict a false accusation that a stock of arms had been found at the \\"Mungo Plastique\\" company, of which he was the manager, and to state that two European technical advisors at that company had been expelled only because their papers were not in order. The prime minister of East Cameroon, Simon Pierre Tchoungui, asked the Pope to summon Ndongmo to Rome and to then invite him to remain there. Ahidjo and Archbishop Jean Zoa were apparently behind the request, wanting to get Ndongmo out of the way. In Rome, Ndongmo was questioned about his ownership of the plastics factory in Douala. Ndongmo explained he had set up the factory only to give the diocese financial independence, so it did not have to rely on Western aid. The Holy See was against this and other enterprises with which Ndongmo had hoped to fund the diocese, schools and hospitals and to create a retirement fund for priests and old people. He was reprimanded by the Vatican for his economic and political activity. Before leaving for Rome, Ndongmo sent Ouandi√© to take refuge with his catechist on the outskirts of Mbanga. The catechist refused to accept Ouandi√©, and alerted the police. Ouandi√© went on the run, but was in unfamiliar territory and was hunted by the local people as well as the police. Eventually, tired, thirsty and hungry, he gave himself up. Two days after Ouandi√©'s arrest, on 21 August 1970 the Minister of Justice, F√©lix Sabal Lecco, announced that the security services had discovered a plot to assassinate the head of state by Ouandie in which Ndongmo was complicit. It was clear that the authorities planned to convict Ndongmo in his absence. He managed to convince the Vatican officials to let him return to defend himself. On Ndongmo's return to Cameroon on 27 August 1970, he found from a newspaper headline that he had been suspended from his position by Rome. Pope Paul VI had named Georges Siyam Siewe as apostolic administrator \\"Sede Plena\\" for Nkongsamba, taking over all active duties. although Ndongmo remained bishop. Ndongmo went at once to visit the Bishop of Douala. A car was sent to arrest him there and take him to the military prison in Yaound√©. Ndongmo was placed in a cell of his own, separated from the other prisoners. His legs and arms were chained, although the handcuffs were removed after a protest by his lawyer. He and Ouandi√© were otherwise not mistreated, were given normal food, and often had a glass of wine with their meal. A doctor checked their condition frequently. He and the other accused were interrogated by Jean Fochiv√©, director of the regime's SEDOC political police force, over the next five months. Ouandi√© was tried in December 1970 and condemned to death. Ndongmo was tried by a military tribunal that opened on 5 January 1971. He and two others were found guilty and sentenced to death, but on 14 January 1971 his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. Ouandi√© was executed by firing squad on 15 January 1971 at Bafoussam. Ndongmo was sent to a prison camp in Tchollir√©. He resigned from his position as Bishop on 29 January 1973. The Pope named Thomas Nkuissi to succeed Ndongmo as acting bishop of Nkongsamba. The church and the state had established an uneasy truce that was severely damaged by the \\"Ndongmo affair\\". Ndongmo's arrest, trial and imprisonment engendered ongoing hostility from the church towards the Cameroon state and created intense controversy within the church. Some Catholics condemned Archbishop Zoa for being too close to the government, and for possibly assisting in removal of a popular rival. The affair also caused tension between Muslims and Christians: several churches were burned in the North. Later career President Ahidjo ordered Ndongmo's release in 1975 shortly before a presidential \\"election\\". Under an agreement between Ahidjo and the Vatican, Ndongmo had to leave Cameroon for Rome. Later he moved to Canada, where he was given citizenship and lived out the rest of his life. An acquaintance met him at Universit√© Laval in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He was in good spirits, working on his prison writings and planning to take a course at the university. He described how he had passed the time while imprisoned by gardening and \\"writing without paper.\\" Ahidjo resigned the Presidency in November 1982 and in February 1984 a Cameroon military tribunal sentenced him to death in absentia. Ndongmo visited Cameroon twice after this, once when Pope John Paul II visited the country in August 1985, and again in 1989 when he was invited to work on the episcopal council of Central African bishops at Yaounde. Albert Ndongmo died on 29 May 1992 in Quebec. His body was returned to Cameroon and was buried in the run-down cathedral at Nkongsamba in an elaborate ceremony.

She was the winner of the women's team and women's individual events at the 2012 Summer Olympics and of the women's team event again at the 2016 Summer Olympics, where she also took bronze in the individual competition. Her tally of four Olympic medals places her among the most decorated archers in Olympic history. Ki was introduced to archery in primary school and by 2010 was a member of the South Korean national team. In addition to the Olympics she has achieved gold medals at the World Archery Championships - becoming the women's recurve world champion in 2015 - the Asian Games, and the Summer Universiade, and is a three-time winner at the Archery World Cup finals. From 2015 to 2017 she held the world record score for the women's 72-arrow round and has twice held the position as the women's world number one in the World Archery Rankings. Early and personal life Ki Bo-bae was born on February 20, 1988. She was introduced to archery at eleven years old when the sport was offered by her primary school. In 2015, Ki was a graduate student at Gwangju Women's University, which allowed her to compete at the 2015 Summer Universiade, and as of 2017 she was pursuing a doctorate degree. She has expressed an interest in working with athletes of the Paralympic Games and teaching disabled children, as well as joining the International Olympic Committee as a member to assist in future bids by South Korea to host the Summer Olympics. Ki announced her forthcoming marriage shortly after winning her third Archery World Cup in September 2017. She wed in a ceremony held two months later. Ki acted as a torchbearer for the 2018 Winter Olympics torch relay. Career =2010‚Äì2011: Early accolades= Ki was selected for the South Korean archery team alongside Joo Hyun-jung and Yun Ok-hee to contest the 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou. Although eliminated by Cheng Meng of China in the quarter-finals of the women's individual competition, she won the gold medal in the women's event with Joo and Yun after the trio defeated the Chinese team in the final. At the 2011 Archery World Cup's second stage in Antalya she achieved a further team gold medal as well as a silver medal in the individual competition, finishing as runner-up to teammate Jung Dasomi. She later took what would be the first of three mixed team titles at the 2011 World Archery Championships. =2012: Double Olympic Champion= Ki (left) celebrates her 2012 gold medal win in the women's team event with Lee Sung-jin (centre) and Choi Hyeon-ju (right) The 2012 Summer Olympics in London was Ki's first appearance at the Olympics. She began the preliminary 72-arrow ranking round with a score of 671 points from a maximum of 720, tying her at the top of the standings for the women's individual event with teammate Lee Sung-jin and Chinese Taipei's Tan Ya-ting. Ki was however ranked first and awarded the number one seed for the elimination rounds on countback after landing a higher number of arrows in the central ring of the target. With a combined score of 1,993 points, Ki, Lee, and Choi Hyeon-ju also secured the number one seed for South Korea in the women's team competition. Ki and her teammates Lee and Choi delivered a narrow win over China in the final of the women's team event, which was contested prior to the individual event, to claim their nation's seventh consecutive Olympic gold medal in the discipline. As the third and final archer in the team's shooting sequence Ki was responsible for what became the final arrow of the match, securing victory over their Chinese rivals for the third successive Olympics by a single point. Ki won her second gold medal of the Games in the women's individual event contested later in the week, defeating Mexico's A√≠da Rom√°n in a closely fought final which necessitated a one-arrow shoot-off to determine the winner. Having tied 5-5 on set points over the preceding five sets of three arrows each, Ki and Rom√°n were both required to shoot a single tie-breaking arrow at the target with the archer firing closest to the centre winning. The pair both proceeded to shoot their arrows into the 8-ring of the target, but as Ki's effort was judged to have landed marginally closer to the centre, she was awarded the gold medal. Ki was the sole member of the South Korean women's archery team to win two Olympic medals in London. Speaking in a press conference after the final Ki tearfully apologised for her final arrow, stating that \\"Koreans do not shoot eights\\". She also admitted she did not watch Roman's shoot her arrow because she was too deep in prayer. Outside of the Olympics Ki delivered a strong performance in the 2012 Archery World Cup, beginning the competition with gold medals in the women's team and individual events at the opening stage in Shanghai. She qualified for the final stage held in Tokyo in September, where she advanced to the gold medal match and came from behind to defeat India's Deepika Kumari. =2013‚Äì2015: Break and world record= In 2013 Ki won two gold medals at that year's World Archery Championships in Belek, taking her second mixed team title with Oh Jin-hyek and achieving the women's team title. Defeat to Denmark's Maja Jager however eliminated her from contention for the individual crown. After shooting poorly in the national trials for the upcoming Asian Games in Incheon Ki was not selected for the national team in 2014, marking the first time in four years she had not been chosen. In an interview in the newspaper JoongAng Ilbo published at the end of the year Ki reflected that her initial response to her non-selection was one of relief, having gained freedom the strict training regimen by which team members had to abide. She later acknowledged that she had \\"relaxed too much\\" during the trials and lost her mental focus. Watching the archery competitions at the Asian Games that September, in which she performed commentary duties for the Korean broadcaster KBS, motivated her to work to return to the national squad. Her absence from the Korean team resulted in the loss of her position at the top of the World Archery Rankings, where she had held a rank of at least second since the end of the Olympics in 2012. In 2015 Ki returned to the national team after finishing the national trials in first place. At July's Summer Universiade in Gwangju she set two new world records in the ranking round, her score of 686 points for the 72-arrow round surpassing Park Sung-hyun's eleven-year-old record set at the 2004 Summer Olympics by four points, while the combined total of 2,038 points achieved by her and teammates Kang Chae-young and Choi Mi-sun set a new world's best for the women's team event. Ki's subsequent victory over Choi in the final of the women's individual event represented her first gold medal win since the Archery World Cup almost three years earlier. She additionally won gold in the mixed team event. Ki won two further gold medals at the 2015 World Archery Championships held later that summer in Copenhagen, earning a third mixed team gold with Ku Bonchan after defeating the pair of Lin Shih-chia and Kuo Cheng Wei from Chinese Taipei. She later defeated Lin for a second time in the women's individual recurve final. By mid-August she had returned to the top of the World Archery Rankings. =2016‚Äì2017: Third Olympic gold= Ki entered the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro as the sole returning member from South Korea's 2012 Olympic archery team. She was considered one of the favourites to win gold medal in the women's individual and team events, success in which would make her the first archer to defend an individual Olympic title and bring her level with the four career Olympic gold medals achieved by Kim Soo-nyung, regarded as the finest archer in the sport's history. Ki ended the ranking round with 663 points from 720, earning her the third seed for the women's individual event. With her teammates Choi Mi-sun and Chang Hye-jin finishing ranked first and second respectively, the trio also earned the top seed for the women's team competition. Ki, Chang, and Choi concluded the women's team event with victory over Russia in the final, securing her third Olympic gold medal and South Korea's eighth consecutive Olympic women's team title. Afterwards she spoke of the high expectations and pressure placed on the team to continue their winning streak, but noted \\"we just continued working together and having very strong team work and it proved to be right\\". Ki's bid to become the first Olympic archer to retain their individual title was ended by Chang in the semi-finals, who outshot Ki in what Reuters described as an \\"upset\\" result. Ki went on to defeat fellow losing semi-finalist Alejandra Valencia of Mexico in the third-placed match to win the bronze medal. Ki won her second Archery World Cup title in Odense in September, defeating Choi in the final to become the second female repeat winner in the tournament's history. The following year she achieved her third World Cup title in Rome with victory over Ksenia Perova.

Liverpool Overhead Railway carriage in storage at the Electric Railway Museum, rebuilt in 1947. The Liverpool Overhead Railway opened on 6 March 1893 with 2-car electric multiple units, the first to operate in the world. Each lightweight car had a motor that took power from a third rail. In 1902 these were replaced with two motors, which reduced the travel time. After 1945 some trains were modernised, replacing the timber body with aluminium and plywood and fitting power operated sliding doors under control of the guard. The trains were all removed from service when the railway closed in 1956. An original example was retained by the Museum of Liverpool and an example of a modernised carriage is stored at the Electric Railway Museum, Warwickshire. Service The Liverpool Overhead Railway was an elevated railway operating in and around the dockside of Liverpool that opened on 6 March 1893 with the first electric multiple units operating in the world. The railway opened with 15 two-car trains, built by Brown, Marshall & Co, each lightweight car with a motor and long, wide with seating for 41 in second class and 16 in first. Power was provided by a third rail between the tracks and air brakes were fitted, the pressure topped up at terminus stations. In the early days, a single motor coach would run off-peak. Leather high-backed seating was provided in the first class compartment, while third class consisted of wooden seating in bays of six, with hanging straps for standees during peak times. A further 4 two-car trains were built in 1894, these were only long, followed by enough motor cars and trailers were built in 1896 to allow 15 two-car trains and 8 three-car trains to be formed. These newer motor cars were fitted with motors. To meet competition from the electric tramways that offered a faster service, in 1902 the motor cars were fitted with two Dick, Kerr & Co. motors, which reduced the travel time from end to end from 32 minutes to 20 minutes. At the same time, ten motor cars were widened to to increase accommodation. Originally first and second class accommodation was provided, but after the L&YR; began running over the railway in 1905 this became first and third. The conductor rail was moved from the central position to outside the running rails at the same time. The two-car trains were lengthened to three-car with additional trailers built in 1916‚Äì18. The cars were now arranged with transverse seating, the unpowered central coach was fitted with leather- covered seats for first class passengers; third class passengers had wooden seating. The motors were replaced in 1919 by motors, and the travel time increased to 31 minutes. In 1945‚Äì47 a three car train was modernised, replacing the timber body with aluminium and plywood and fitting power operated sliding doors under control of the guard. New trains were considered too expensive so six more trains were rebuilt. The trains were all removed from service when the railway closed in 1956.

Career Born in Rugby, Warwickshire, he was interested in antiques from age 12, which led to his joining the profession on leaving school. He qualified aged 21 as a member of the Incorporated Society of Valuers and Auctioneers, which merged with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in 2000. Barby started working for a local firm in Rugby, before leaving to work in London in 1974. He was head hunted by Royal Leamington Spa-based auction house Locke and England, and he joined them in 1978 as a manager and valuer. He later became a partner, retiring from the business in 2003. Barby was an expert on \\"everything from Victorian porcelain to antique oak pedestal desks\\". Barby started his own independent valuation business, Hillmorton-based David J. Barby and Associates, in the 1990s, where he still worked at the time of his death. As an auctioneer, his affable manner made him popular, particularly with those bidding. His great success in October 2000 was the sale of a ¬£1 million collection. The Royal Leamington Society marked its Jubilee Year in 2006 with an \\"Evening with David Barby on Images of the 50s\\", at the Town Hall in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire. Similar evenings with Barby were held at Snitterfield Village Hall, Stratford-upon- Avon and other locations. Barby was well known for the charity work that he carried out, as a fundraiser for the Royal Leamington Spa Rehabilitation Hospital and Leamington Art Gallery. He was also president of the Friends of Leamington Spa Art Gallery and Museum. Barby gave a series of lectures on antiques with humorous stories of the antiques business. He gave lectures to groups such as NADFAS, Women's Institutes, and historical and arts societies, as well as on cruise ships. Barby was the subject of the July 2007 newsletter article, \\"My Life in Antiques\\", based on a speech he gave to the UK Belleek Collectors' Group Spring Meeting in 2007. Barby gave much time in sharing stories, memories, nostalgia, and passion for old things with members of the public. Charles Hanson, a friend of Barby said, \\"more important he is a man of the people\\". Television Barby appeared in the first episode of Flog It! in 2002 as the auctioneer, but was soon also employed as an expert. He was already becoming well known in a similar role on Bargain Hunt, and later appeared on Antiques Road Trip, where he became known by the nickname \\"The Master\\". Barby featured in the 500th show of the BBC programme Bargain Hunt on the red team alongside Philip Serrell. Barby also appeared in episode 1 of the TV Series Housecall on 4 February 2002. He appeared to fall in Widemarsh Street, Hereford in 2012 while filming an episode of the Antiques Road Trip. In 2011 and 2012, there were other reports of him having minor facial injuries, viewed on television. Barby was an ambassador of antiques on television. Following his death, Bargain Hunt paid tribute to Barby in an episode broadcast on 1 October 2012, with a montage of his appearances shown at the end of the programme. A similar montage by Antiques Road Trip was shown on 5 October 2012. Politics Barby stood in the Caldecott district of Rugby in 2002 as a prospective Conservative councillor, but came fourth in a ward which elected only three councillors. He took part in fundraising events such as 'Antiques Evening with David Barby' for the Solihull Conservative Association. Death and tributes Barby suffered a stroke at his Rugby home on 13 July 2012, and he died two weeks later on 25 July 2012 in a hospital in Coventry, aged 69. Over 500 people attended a memorial service at St Andrew's Church, Rugby on 2 September 2012. A tribute was given by Philip Serrell. Tributes were also made by the BBC, TV programme Flog It, and Presenter Tim Wonnacott. Wonnacott expressed his shock on behalf of the team at Bargain Hunt and spoke of his high standards and professionalism as an expert, and also his sense of humour and sense of fun. David Barby was buried at Watts Lane Cemetery, Hillmorton, in Rugby, Warwickshire.

A marina, sheltered by three sunken lake freighters operates seasonally at the site. The exhibit \\"pods\\", several pavilions suspended above a lagoon, have remained closed after the closure of the Atlantis event facility. The West Island has been repurposed for recreation use and special events.  History  The Ontario Place theme park operated annually during the summer months from 1971 until 2011. Designed originally to promote the Province of Ontario through exhibits and entertainment, its focus changed over time to be that of a theme park for families with a water park, a children's play area, and amusement rides. Exhibits in the pods were discontinued and the pods became a venue for private events. Forum concert stage had long been a primary draw to Ontario Place in its early years as it offered free concerts by a wide variety of prominent artists, for free with the price of admission to the park. Structured as a true amphitheater with seating on all sides and a recessed stage that was round and revolved during concerts, all seats offered an equal view of the stage and were offered on a first come first served basis. In the 1990s, despite the vocal protests of Eb Zeidler, the architect of the park among others, the Forum was torn down and replaced by the (misleadingly named) Amphitheatre, in truth a static proscenium arch stage with banked ticketed seating. After a long period of declining attendance, the Government of Ontario closed the facility except for its music venue and marina after the 2011 season. = Background = Cinesphere at Ontario Place Built in 1926, the CNE Ontario Government Building displayed exhibits about Ontario at the annual Canadian National Exhibition (CNE). After the success of the Ontario Pavilion at Expo 67 in Montreal, the Government of Ontario decided to replace the CNE building with a new state-of-the-art showcase. The government at first considered moving the Ontario Pavilion to a site on Toronto Island but instead decided at the instigation of Jim Ramsay, to build a facility elsewhere on the waterfront. Ontario Premier John Robarts announced the project at the opening of the CNE in August 1968. The park itself was originally conceived as an onshore exhibit, but this idea was discarded in favour of five large, architecturally unique, three-level pods in an aquatic setting somewhat similar in concept to Montreal's Expo 67 grounds (which were in the middle of the Saint Lawrence River). Each pod would be approximately in area, and suspended by steel cables from four large central pylons driven deep into the lake bed. These pods initially housed various Ontario-themed exhibits. The first model displayed to the government dismayed director Jim Ramsay: The original plans were estimated to cost to construct. Plans for the facility grew to include the Forum outdoor amphitheater, marina, nine restaurants, nine snack bars, three land rides, pedal and tour boats and an additional of landfill. = Design and construction = Ontario Place pods are anchored beneath the water. The park was built by the Ontario Department of Trade and Development. The architects were Craig, Zeidler; Strong, the structural engineers were Gordon Dowdell Associates, the landscape architects were Hough, Stansbury and Associates, and the general contractor was Secant Construction. Construction started on March 17, 1969. During the design phase, a difficult design problem developed. The cost of the open-water pod foundations alone (at the time, estimated at ) would consume almost the entire budget for the pods' construction. Architect Eb Zeidler was faced with a dilemma: how to construct the pods without the necessary budget. Zeidler developed an innovative solution: after a trip to the Caribbean, he realized that a \\"barrier reef\\" concept would cut down on wave action from the lake enough to reduce the cost of the pods' foundation to 1/10 of the original open-water estimate. After some quarrels with the Toronto Harbour Commission (due to the dangers of the unseen reef to shipping), the reef plan was modified to incorporate three artificial \\"barrier islands\\" made from city landfill. The five steel and aluminum pavilion pods are square with sides. Each pod is supported by four pipe columns, rising above the lake. Tension cables support the short-span trusses. They sit on concrete filled caissons, driven into the lake's bedrock. Each of the pavilions is connected to one another and the land by glazed steel bridges. Ontario Place was designed to have a modular use and appearance. Zeidler says that the structures were designed to \\"give an illusion of dimensionless space, exploiting technology to shape the society of tomorrow.\\" The Forum, an outdoor concert venue, was featured on a central hub-island, while a children's village would occupy an eastern island. A commercial section overlooked the water, with modular construction for shops and restaurants to the west. All would be connected by an intricately planned set of walkways and bridges. In addition, each island would have a unique colour scheme, and the entire complex was later infused with the brilliant colours and graphic design that was typical of the late 1960s and early 1970s. The children's village was designed by Eric McMillan and cost $700,000. The Forum theatre sat 3,000 and had additional grass 'seats'. The roof structure was a hyperbolic paraboloid positioned on cement bastions. It covered a revolving stage, giving near 360 degree sightlines. The roof was made out of tongue and groove plywood, covered by copper sheathing. Landscape architect Michael Hough overlaid a scale model of the University of Toronto's walking paths onto the Ontario Place plans to check for appropriate walking distances. This ensured that comfortable rest areas were placed appropriately so that children and the elderly would not need to walk too far without a comfortable seat. Ontario Place operated a rubber-wheeled tractor train and a boat to take visitors between key points on the various islands. Prevailing wind and wave conditions were also considered in the design, a scale model of which was tested in the University of Toronto's wind tunnel. Large earthwork berms planted with tall native Ontario trees were created to shelter walkways from the prevailing southwesterly winds. To the south, a cost-effective and theme-congruent plan to sink three large obsolete Great Lakes shipping vessels was implemented, which sheltered the artificial harbour from intense open-lake waves. (The same technique would later be used on Toronto Island and the Outer Harbour.) The first phase of construction was the sinking of the ships onto a stone bed, then covered in concrete forming a long breakwater. Once the perimeter was finished, work began on the of the three artificial islands. A marina was included in the project, holding up to 292 boats up to in length. There was originally some controversy about allowing a public facility to house an upscale boating dock within the new artificial harbour. However, supporters of the plan believed that the dock's integration into Ontario Place would tie the location closer to the lake via boating activity, and improve the general ambience. At Expo 70 in Osaka, Japan, the new IMAX movie technology was first exhibited. A great success, it was decided to build the first permanent IMAX installation at Ontario Place. The Cinesphere, an 800-seat theatre, was built. Its building is a 'spherical triodetic dome', with a outer radius, and a inner radius. The dome is supported by prefabricated steel aluminum alloy tubes. The design of Ontario Place has won a long list of awards including ones from the International Committee for Documentation and Conservation of Buildings of the Modern Movement, the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada, The National Trust ‚Äî Prix du XXe Si√®cle, and the American Society of Landscape Architects. In 2014, the Ontario government's Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Sport declared Ontario Place to be a \\"cultural heritage landscape of provincial significance.\\" =Opening= When Ontario Place opened on May 22, 1971, the eastern island's children's village was not yet built, postponed to July, and finally opened for the 1972 season. Initially estimated at , the final cost of construction of Ontario Place was ($ in dollars) after plans grew to encompass more features and attractions. Opening day attendance was 23,000. The park's initial size was , created by landfill. The first-year admission price: $1.00 for adults, $0.50 for students, $0.25 for children 6‚Äì12 To commemorate the opening of the theme park and promote the province of Ontario, a multi-media exhibition was created and presented inside the pavilion. Dolores Claman wrote the music and Richard Morris wrote lyrics for the music to this presentation, entitled \\"Theme from Ontario Place\\". \\"Theme from Ontario Place\\" was subsequently released by the Ontario Department of Trade and Development as a double-sided 45RPM vinyl record. It was manufactured by Quality Records (OP1971), side A containing a \\"Pop\\" version and Side B an \\"Easy Listening\\" recording. A photo of the still under construction Ontario Place was used on the cover. The purpose built Imax theatre premiered a specially commissioned film North of Superior, an 18-minute film depicting life in Northern Ontario and its first season over 1.1 million people viewed the film. In its first year, attendance was 2.5 million. However, the park had higher than expected costs and ran a deficit of $2.2 million. Winter screenings at Cinesphere were \\"financially successful.\\" The Government of Ontario raised the admission from $1 to $1.50 for adults and 50 cents to 75 cents for youth. Manager James Ramsay was replaced and returned to the Ministry of Trade and Development. Two government-run restaurants that had lost money were leased to a private operator for the second season. During the first year, visitors to the CNE had to pay admission to enter Ontario Place. Starting in the second year, admission to the CNE included free admission to Ontario place. = Changes over time = Molson Amphitheatre and Ontario Place waterpark The park was altered considerably since its inception. Redevelopment occurred on all three islands of the park; the pod buildings themselves were eventually closed to exhibit space and rented out as the \\"Atlantis\\" private event facility. In 1980, the \\"Ontario North Now\\" exhibit was built on the west island to showcase Northern Ontario. It was a combination of inter-connected silo-like buildings, topped with domes reminiscent of the Cinesphere, connected by overhead walkways, and a smaller domed movie theatre. In 1984, a boat-based water ride was added, along with a smaller exhibition center consisting of three concrete silo-like buildings. A large reflecting pool nearby was drained and used to house the addition of a major \\"climber\\" structure, a smaller stage for kids shows and several other kid-oriented attractions, reducing the complete separation of areas that had been featured in the original design. The outdoor in-the-round concert stage, The Forum, was torn down and replaced with the million Molson Amphitheatre in 1995, a much larger facility based on a bandshell design. An additional \\"Echo Beach\\" outdoor music venue was added to the north shore of the east island in 2011. On the east island, the original children's area, which was primarily \\"non-powered\\", has largely been removed. The large wood-and-rope climber area was replaced with the large \\"Soak City\\" waterpark, the first water park in Ontario. Several small fair-ground rides were later added. The large tension structure tent that covered most of the children's park was removed in 2009/10, leaving a large open area with a new stage. Many of the concrete bollards used to secure the various tents and structures can still be seen. =Operating deficit and attendance= Although proposed as a tourist attraction to promote Ontario, the park's subsidy nevertheless was a consistent concern of the Government of Ontario. The first season ran a deficit of $2.2 million, which led to an increase in admission prices the following season. In 1978, Ontario Place ran a deficit of $2.75 million while still charging $2.50 for adult admission. In the seasons of 1988 and 1989, Patti Starr, Ontario Place chair, reduced the deficit by $1.4 million by privatizing retail sales and fast-food operations, cutting advertising and increasing fees. In 1994, the Forum was torn down for the larger Molson Amphitheatre, in part to reduce the park's $4.5 million annual deficit. In 1997, Ontario Place's general manager Max Beck suggested a merger with Exhibition Place to save money. Ontario Finance Minister Jim Flaherty proposed selling off Ontario Place. In 2003, the subsidy was $3 million. Attendance was another concern for park management and new attractions were regularly introduced to gain new interest. However, attendance declined from 3 million annually in the 1970s, to 2.5 million in 1985, 2.1 million in 1989. By 2004, attendance had declined to one million annually. The Ontario Government appointed former Toronto Mayor David Crombie to revitalize the park. In its last summer operating season, attendance was 563,000. When the Ontario Gaming Commission was proposing a casino in downtown Toronto in 2012, one site mentioned was Ontario Place as a solution to declining attendance and revenues. The downtown casino was eventually stopped by opposition at Toronto City Council. The casino idea was also opposed by border cities in Ontario with existing casinos. = 2010 refurbishment = From the fall of 2010 through to the fall of 2011, over $10 million was spent on improvements. These included: * a significant refreshing and expansion of the waterpark. Froster Soak City added a new \\"family\\" waterslide, an outdoor \\"spa pool\\" and waterfall, and over 100 metres of newly landscaped beach and public promenades. These upgrades expanded Soak City's variety and added new views of the Toronto downtown waterfront. The new slide, called \\"Topsy Turvy\\", was purchased from ProSlide Technology of Ottawa, Ontario. Topsy Turvy was recognized as the \\"2010 Best New Waterslide\\" from the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA). The installation of Topsy Turvy and the engineering systems needed for its operation was completed in October 2011, too late for the 2011 final season; * upgrades to the Cinesphere. The original projection system was replaced by state-of-the-art IMAX 3D film technology by Toronto architecture firm Gow Hastings Architects, making Cinesphere the largest 3D theatre in Canada and second largest in North America. New sound systems, seats, concession areas, and interiors were also added; * introduction of an \\"in-habitat\\" ecology, conservation, and animal care exhibit called the Eco-Learning Centre. A former arcade building, the Eco-Learning Centre was established in a lagoon area of Ontario Place as a fun and informative \\"edutainment\\" attraction, and was created with displays by the World Wildlife Fund, the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority, the Royal Ontario Museum, Parks Canada, the Toronto Humane Society, and the Ministry of Natural Resources. The Eco-Learning Centre attracted over 300,000 visitors in its first year of operation. * construction of Echo Beach * general cleanliness of the park was also upgraded significantly, including the removal of over of obsolete fencing. Investments were made in entertainment, marketing and sponsorship for the 40th-anniversary celebrations. Free grounds admission was offered to the public for the first time in 20 years. Live entertainment performances were quadrupled, to over 2,000. Advertising was reinstated, with a new ad campaign developed by Draft FCB of Toronto. A significant sponsorship of the 40th birthday celebration by CTV generated over $1,500,000 in extra advertising value. Ontario Place was recognized in 2011 by IAAPA as a worldwide finalist for a \\"Brass Ring Award\\" in the category of \\"Best Integrated Marketing Campaign.\\" The results of this effort generated an improvement in attendance numbers, park revenues, and public perceptions of Ontario Place in 2011. Total park attendance increased 9% to 880,001 despite a below average year for concerts at the Molson Canadian Amphitheatre and a decline in cross-over attendance from the Canadian National Exhibition. Core park attendance increased by 72% to 563,362. First-time visitor attendance increased even more, at 89%. Revenues in all categories increased by double- digit figures, despite the fact that there was no charge for actual admission to the grounds. Scores from interview-based research into visitor perceptions also improved strongly. Favourable response to the question, \\"Ontario Place has changed for the better\\", increased by 43%, as did, \\"Ontario Place is my favourite entertainment park in the GTA\\", at 50% up. Perceptions of park cleanliness and general upkeep improved, by 34% and 37%, respectively. =Closure of theme park and redevelopment= In the summer of 2010, the Government of Ontario issued a Request for information calling for ideas from private bidders to completely redevelop the park. Ontario Place general manager Tim Casey told the Toronto Star that \\"2011 will be our 40th anniversary. It definitely needs a revitalization, that‚Äôs no surprise. It‚Äôs a blank slate, we‚Äôre open to just about anything.‚Äù A formal Request for proposals process began that fall. The government intends to transform the park from a largely seasonal facility to a year-round attraction. The redevelopment was to have included the tearing down of the Cinesphere as well as other long-standing attractions. On February 1, 2012, the government announced that the public sections of the park would be closed and redeveloped, with a target date of 2017, the year of Canada's 150th anniversary. John Tory was announced as the chair of a Minister's Advisory Panel on Revitalization. All Ontario Place facilities were closed except for the marina, the Molson Canadian Amphitheatre, the Atlantis entertainment venue and parking. Following the provincial elections in June 2014, the government announced the plans in July for Ontario Place to be developed as an urban parkland with Molson Canadian Amphitheatre, Cinesphere and the pods retained. The West Channel at Ontario Place was a venue for the 2015 Pan American Games (Athletics -marathon/race walk, cycling (road race), triathlon (cycling/run), open water swimming, triathlon (swim), water skiing and 2015 Parapan American Games (Cycling). Minor and temporary upgrades were made to accommodate use during the games. Construction was begun in March on the park and a waterfront path, which was named the William G. Davis Trail, after the Ontario premier who opened the original Ontario Place in 1971.Bradbeer, Janice. \\"Will this lakeside gem glisten again?\\". Toronto Star, May 15, 2016. page IN7 In 2017, portions of the East Island were transformed from a parking lot into Trillium Park. The new park included the William G. Davis Trail, which opened in June 2017. In November 2017, the Cinesphere re-opened with showings of Dunkirk and North of Superior as part of a regular schedule of weekend programming. The Cinesphere's screen was replaced and a new \\"IMAX with laser\\" projector was installed. In early 2018, the Government of Ontario led by Liberal Premier Kathleen Wynne solicited proposals as to new purposes for Ontario Place, but those could not include condominiums or a casino. After the Progressive Conservatives were elected in June, an announcement was made of plans to dissolve the Ontario Place Corporation. This follows the province indicating interest in establishing a casino on the lands. In November, Finance Minister Vic Fedeli suggested that the government was open to considering a new purpose for the park, without the restrictions that had been set by the previous government. In December 2018, the Government of Ontario appointed James Ginou, a Toronto businessman and Progressive Conservative fund-raiser, as the new Chair of the Board of Ontario. He had previously served in the position from 1997 until 2003. In 2019, the Government of Ontario announced that it would develop a rapid-transit line (the \\"Ontario Line\\") connecting Ontario Place to downtown Toronto and further north-east to the Ontario Science Centre. The line is targeted to open in 2027. In May 2019, at an announcement held in the Cinesphere, the Government of Ontario released a call for proposals to redevelop Ontario Place with \\"big, bold ideas\\". Proposals must not include residential units, a casino and must not require a specific monetary outlay or subsidy by the Government of Ontario. Proposals must preserve the existing amount of parkland included in the Trillium Park, preserve the existing Budweiser Stage, but otherwise permit any type of changes, subject to approval. World Monuments Fund included Ontario Place on its 2020 World Monuments Watch program alongside 24 heritage sites around the globe ‚Äúin need of timely or urgent action.‚Äù In response to the Province of Ontario‚Äôs international call for development proposals, the WMF listing demanded ‚Äúan end to top-down decision-making and the embrace of heritage to encourage community dialogue‚Äù. Following the Watch inclusion, World Monuments Fund partnered with the Architectural Conservancy Ontario and the Faculty of Architecture, Landscape and Design at the University of Toronto to protect the heritage values of Ontario Place through an initiative called \\"The Future of Ontario Place Project\\". Through a research initiative and public campaign, the Future of Ontario Place Project started working in 2020 to build public knowledge of the heritage values of the site, and to imagine the future of Ontario Place as a public cultural asset for all Ontarians. Venues and facilities The park is open daily without admission accessible by the west entrance and the Trillium Park entrance. Several venues operate with separate ticketing. The eastern entrance is used exclusively for the Budweiser Stage. =Budweiser Stage= Budweiser Stage is a 15,000-person capacity outdoor concert venue. The stage and the inner seating area is covered by a permanent roof. The Stage operates a summer season of popular music concerts. It was formerly known as the Molson Amphitheatre. =Cinesphere= Cinesphere is a 600-person capacity IMAX and IMAX3D theatre. Opened at the same time as the theme park, it screens a selection of IMAX films on weekends. It also has been used by the Toronto International Film Festival. It is an \\"IMAX with laser\\" and 70mm film theatre. The theatre is housed in a \\"triodetic-domed\\" spherical structure, similar to a geodesic dome. =Echo Beach= Developed in collaboration with concert promoter Live Nation, Echo Beach is a 5000-person general-admission outdoor concert venue designed to help re-create the popular ambience of the original Ontario Place Forum, minus the revolving stage but introducing a real sandy beach section with views of the Toronto nighttime skyline. Some of the first performers Echo Beach in 2011 included Sloan, Robyn and Platinum Blonde. The Toronto Life magazine wrote, \\"The new Echo Beach is a reason to love Toronto because music sounds better under the stars\\". For 2012, based on strong reviews and rising attendance, Live Nation increased substantially the number of concerts scheduled for Echo Beach, including Our Lady Peace, Sam Roberts, and Counting Crows. =Other facilities= Ontario Place offers 240 slips for pleasure craft in two marinas. It offers slips for seasonal and visit rentals. The marinas are open between May and October. Trillium Park is a newly- developed park on the East Island. The park provides a trail, a firepit, a picnic/meeting shelter and some special plantings. While not full redeveloped, one area of the West Island has been repurposed. It is used for cultural festivals and events. A skating rink operates during winter months and boat rentals operate during the summer months. Former attractions =Children's Village= Not ready for the first season, the Children's Village opened in July 1972, built at a cost of $700,000 on the East Island. Occupying about 2 acres, the active playground offered large nets to climb on, tube slides, a \\"foam swamp\\" of foam pieces below a plastic sheet, a \\"pogo-bird bounce\\", \\"punch-bag forest\\", a plastic climbing pyramid, a rubber forest, a large air mattress to jump on, and a total of 21 activities. Half of the village was covered by a bright orange vinyl canopy. The Village was designed by Eric MacMillan. The Village changed over time, and the active activities were replaced by the water park and amusements on the East Island. The roofed area was closed and replaced by Heritage Square which had live entertainment. Children's activities were also developed on the West Island, including a large climbing facility, games, creative activities and rides. =The Forum= The Forum was an outdoor concert venue that was an architectural landmark. It featured covered seating under a unique tent-like, metal framed, solid roof, with extra seating on the open surrounding, grassy hills. While having only half the seating capacity of the current Amphitheatre, it had (arguably) better sound, bench seating, and offered a far more intimate theatre in the round experience; featuring a rotating stage which gave every seat in the house, in turn, an excellent view. It also had the benefit of being generally free with park admission. Featured events included an annual Toronto Symphony rendition of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture, complete with the firing of the guns from the nearby HMCS Haida, and often performances by well established acts, such as BB King, Glen Campbell, Kenny Rogers, Johnny Cash, Dizzy Gillespie, Pat Metheny and Canadian acts like Lighthouse, Bruce Cockburn, The Nylons, Luba, James Brown, Men Without Hats, Doug and the Slugs, Parachute Club and Red Rider. Unfortunately, due to a riot by Teenage Head fans in 1981 (purportedly instigated by their manager, who allegedly was interested in the publicity) harder rock acts were thereafter banned from the venue. In summer of 1983, the Forum was ahead of the curve by bringing in acts like Paul Young and the Royal Family and Tina Turner just before her huge comeback the following year. The Forum was torn down at the end of the 1994 season. According to Lou Seller, the Ontario Place marketing and entertainment manager, the decision was made because \\"the Forum is quaint. It could not take big acts. The sightlines will be better, the acoustics will be better, we'll be able to offer a state-of-the-art concert experience.\\" Sellers also said that Ontario Place was looking forward to an increase in attendance at the park, which cost the provincial treasury $4.5 million annually, 30% of its budget, an amount it wanted to decrease. The plan was criticized by the original Ontario Place architect Eb Ziedler, who suggested building the facility on the east island so as to keep the Forum, which he described as an engineering achievement that should be kept, and Ontario Place's landscape architect Michael Hough who criticized the cutting of trees necessary for the new facility. The plan was met with protests at Toronto City Hall, but the City of Toronto Council did not stop the project. The project was paid for by Molson Breweries and MCA (today's Live Nation). = Froster Soak City = The splash had many valves people could interact with The waterpark began with a concrete waterslide, Canada's first, opened in 1978 on the East Island infill. It was expanded with new water attractions (Hydrofuge in 1993 and Rush River Raft Ride, Pink Twister waterslide and Purple Pipeline waterslide in 1995) and eventually to the current Soak City theme in 2001. By the time of its closure, it had five water slides, a pool and a splash pad. In the Splash Pad area of the park, many of the features were interactive and controlled by user- operable valves. The valves are free-turning ball-valves connected to large handwheels. Water park rides and features *Hydrofuge - open 1993 *Lakeside Beach Spa Pool *Pink Twister - open 1995 *Purple Pipeline - open 1995 *Rush River - open 1995 *Topsy Turvy - open August 2011 *Tipping Bucket *Splash Pad = Other attractions and venues = * ', a decommissioned Second World War destroyer that was open to the public. In the early 1960s, the ship was going to be scrapped, but volunteers raised enough money to have it saved and towed to Toronto. It opened as an attraction in August 1965 at a pier at the foot of York Street. The city had planned to build a 'Serviceman's Memorial Park' near Prince's Gates at Exhibition Place. When the organization 'Haida Inc.' ran into financial problems, the ship was taken over by the Government of Ontario and moved in 1970 to the Ontario Place site, where it was turned into an attraction. It was also used as a Sea Cadet training camp. In 2002, it was bought by Parks Canada. It was moved to a new home in Hamilton, Ontario and incorporated into a new marine museum in that city. * Future Pod, opened in 1982 in Pod 5, featuring displays and exhibits in technology, communications and energy, including a full-sized replica of the Canadarm used on the Space Shuttle. * The Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, originally opened in Ontario Place before moving to its permanent home in St. Marys, Ontario. * Ontario North Now, a themed area, made up the bulk of the west island, including the wilderness adventure ride, a simulated mine, and Muskeg Pete's Main Street. The mining exhibit became a weather exhibit in the 2000s. = List of 2011 (final) season attractions = Ontario Place mini bumper boats in action, 2009 Numerous midway rides were temporarily installed at the park in its final season. ; East Island * Acrobatic Stage Show at Heritage Square, played for part of the final season. * Power Wheels ‚Äì This ride was closed in June 2011, early in the final season of the first era of the park. * Cyclone * Mini Bumper Boats * First Flight * Free Fall * Tilt-A- Whirl * Mini Greens (mini golf) * Super Slide * 4D Ontario * Cyclone Speedway * Aquajet Racers * Froster Soak City * Waterplay Splash Pad ; ; Marina Village * Cinesphere in IMAX 3D * Atlantis ‚Äì Restaurant/Club * OP Driving School * Bumper Boats * H2O Generation Station * Cool Hoops ‚Äì Closed as of June 2011 * Marina with Lake Ontario access * Boat School * Eco-learning center * Earth Ranger * Mega Bounce * Wacky Worm ‚Äì Ontario Place's first roller-coaster ; ; West Island * Wilderness Adventure ride * 3D F/X Adventure Theatre * National Helicopters * Megamaze * The Go Zone * Treehouse Live!

It was the setting for a shootout where Dr. Harrison Blackwood, his team, and a supposed alien ally confront the evil aliens which are personally led by the alien advocacy. Ontario Place was also used as the for the filming of Urban Legends Final Cut as the \\"Tunnel of Terror\\" back in 1999. This scene shows the ride turned into a horror ride where two of the characters are killed by electrocution but the authorities believe it to be accidental.

It was planned as a sequel to the Amiga game Darkmere, but became a standalone game over the course of development, possibly in part due to Darkmere's repeated delays. Plot An unnamed hero travels across seven worlds to kill dragons, rescue Princess Kirstie and restore the ultimate power to the dragonstones to vanquish the dragon hordes. Development Dragonstone began development in August 1993, and was developed in a year. Dragonstone was originally designed as a sequel to Darkmere, but over the course of its development became a standalone game. The One reports a rumor as to the reason behind this change; they purport that this may have been due to Darkmere's numerous delays, and Core Design possibly believed that Dragonstone may release before Darkmere. The One interviewed Bob Churchill, Dragonstone's map designer, for information regarding its development in a pre-release interview. Churchill states that Dragonstone began because \\"The Darkmere programmers took forever and Mark Jones, the graphic artist, was left with nothing to do. So he started knocking up plans for a sequel - Darkstone, as it was then called ... However, the story has changed so much through development that it's become an entirely self- contained game.\\" Dragonstone was inspired by Zelda games, and Churchill states that he \\"[loves] the Zelda games to bits\\", and goes on to say that \\"There are many reasons why they're brilliant but the most obvious is that they play so nicely. The traps and puzzles are so well designed - in most cases you can see exactly what you need to do but it's the doing it which presents the problem. We wanted to do a Zelda-type game on the Amiga, because no-one has ever attempted one before.\\" Furthermore comparing Dragonstone to Zelda, Churchill states that \\"the two games are pretty close. There is plenty of wandering around and interacting with people, which is very Zelda-ish. The puzzles are similar as well - the in-game characters will request a specific object so that they can complete a task, so it's your job to retrieve it for them, thus opening up more areas to explore.\\" A difference that Churchill notes between the two games is that Dragonstone has characters that \\"move around of their own free will\\" regardless of the player's involvement, posing an example of a woodcutter in a forest who chops down trees, saying that \\"You'll keep bumping into him and you'll discover new areas which he's cleared, enabling you to explore parts of the level which were previously out of reach.\\" In regards to Dragonstone's puzzles, Churchill expresses that designing them is difficult due to the programming aspect of getting them into the game; stating that \\"because the puzzles you think up are limited by what you're doing in the actual game - the amount of sprites you can use per level, that kind of thing. You often think: 'I wish we could get this bit in,' but Barry the programmer will say it's not possible.\\" To lessen this issue, Churchill states that several sprites are reused, saying that \\"Once you've designed a sprite for a specific purpose you'll often ask yourself whether or not it's possible to use that graphic again in another puzzle. That's what I'm doing now for the Castle Level - I've used up the amount of sprites the programmer will allow so it's a case of discovering ways in which I can use them again.\\" Dragonstone's puzzles were designed to be logic-based, and Churchill states that players will \\"never have to do anything obscure to progress\\". The One notes the importance of atmosphere in adventure games, and Churchill expresses several ways Dragonstone is designed to be more immersive, such as sound effects increasing in volume the closer the player is to the source of the sound, and some \\"smart\\" graphic effects, such as \\"an interesting mosaic effect\\" which occurs when the player teleports. According to Churchill, some parts of Dragonstone were cut so the game could work on the Amiga A500. Mark Jones, Dragonstone's graphic artist, wasn't in-house for Dragonstone's development and Churchill states that \\"he had to send all the [graphics] up to us by post, which meant that any changes we wanted to make took a lot longer.\\" Churchill states that Mark Jones aimed for a \\"realistic\\" art style with Dragonstone's graphics. Reception The One gave Dragonstone an overall score of 79%, comparing the game's puzzles to Dizzy, and furthermore stating, \\"the difficulty level seems to have been aimed at the younger player. There's nothing wrong with that, but at times the game is quite challenging as far as the arcade-ness goes ... while the puzzle solving is just too easy.\\" The One expresses that they find the use of scrolls in the game's puzzles to be a crutch, as the later levels in which they are prevalent are \\"just boring - you hit the space bar, you solve the problem.\\" The first two levels rely more upon traditional puzzle solving due to the protagonist not yet having the full extent of their powers, a section of the game that The One prefers to the later levels.

History The Brothers of the Christian Schools, (Latin, Fratres Scholarum Christianarum or FSC) is a Catholic religious congregation dedicated to the teachings and charism of Saint John Baptist de La Salle, Patron Saint of Teachers. The first De La Salle School in the Philippines was opened on June 16, 1911 along Nozaleda Street in Paco, Manila at the request of the Archbishop of Manila. In 1921, the school was moved to its present site on Taft Avenue. Unable to accommodate requests for admission to the elementary grades, they had to revert an earlier policy not to expand. To date, they have spread out to different provinces. The Brothers have since opened in Green Hills, Antipolo, Lipa, Bacolod, Ilagan, Dasmari√±as, and Alabang. They have also undertaken supervision of some schools in Manila, Cavite, Bataan, Cebu, Bukidnon, Surigao del Sur, Negros Occidental, Masbate, Capiz, and Ozamis. Today, they are known as De La Salle Supervised Schools. Around 1977, the idea of having another La Salle School, this time in the Laguna area was conceptualized. This was when architect Lindy Locsin, then a member of the DLSU board of Trustees, offered to donate several hectares of his family's land to La Salle. In 1997, this donation of the Locsins was realized. La Salle purchased additional contiguous hectares of land expanding De La Salle Canlubang a sprawling fifty hectare campus. The DLSU Laguna campus is ten times bigger than the original DLSU campus at Taft Avenue, Manila. Laguna is one of the country's industrial and technological regions. Its large, industrial companies presently make it ideal for science and technological parks. De La Salle Canlubang was established in June 2003 to complement the region's role in the science and technology fields. The Integrated school opened its doors to 240 students from preschool to grade 4 and grade 8 (second year high school) during its first year. The school's curriculum emphasizes a science-oriented education. In 2012, the administrations of DLSU and DLSC approved the integration of DLSC into DLSU, becoming the De La Salle University Science and Technology Complex (DLSU-STC). Then DLSU president Br. Narciso Erguiza Jr. said the DLSU-STC would attract a big number of top students and outstanding faculty to transform the university into a leading research center in Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. In 2016, DLSU-STC opened its doors to Senior High School students. In 2018, French video game company Ubisoft opened a studio on campus. It partners with DLSU to train aspiring Filipino game developers who are part of the university's game development courses and co-develop AAA games.

History Braidhurst High School was established in 1962, making it one of the more modern secondary schools in Motherwell. Indeed, the school has recently undergone modernization works, with the pink and yellow panels replaced by a glass-exterior. In 1974, Braidhurst would convert into a six- year comprehensive school, which it has remained since. Facilities The school contains the two-storey main building, containing amenities such as library, gymnasiums, theatre/assembly hall and cafeteria, and is adjoined to a four-storey tower block, containing additional learning facilities such as a computer suite. There are also wet-weather facilities for pupils based within the main building of the school. A large indoor sports barn is also available, which is a facility capable of hosting indoor sporting events such as football, volleyball and basketball, as well as being a venue for sports clubs and physical education classes. Dressing room and shower facilities are also based inside the barn. Recently, the school has undergone some upgrades, and that includes the installation of an outdoor, full-size, floodlit, astroturf pitch that is used by the school and the wider community. There are also dressing room and shower facilities built nearby the outdoor facility. The School is also ideally located near the Greenlink Cycle Path, a direct route from Strathclyde Park to Motherwell Town Centre. Recognition The football park at Braidhurst High School. The new outdoor playing fields have meant that in 2008, Braidhurst became a designated Scottish Football Association School of football facility, one of six facilities with this status in Scotland. This meant that young footballers all around Lanarkshire could apply for a place in Braidhurst through the initiative. They would then win the SFA Quality Mark Award for outstanding educational provision. They have also been awarded the National Sports Comprehensive Status. In 2012, the school was selected as the Lanarkshire base for the SFA's Performance Schools, a system devised to support the development of the best young talented footballers across the country (there are seven such schools across Scotland). As of 2017, the dedicated coach for the young players at Braidhurst is Andy Goldie. The school has also been a winner of the Customer Service Excellence award (previously the Charter Mark) on three occasions (2001,2004,2007), for excellent public service. This is further strengthened by the wide range of clubs and activities that the school offers on a yearly basis. An HMIe Report, commissioned on 19 January 2010, stated that it noted various strengths within the school. Some of the strengths included the high level of climate for learning, the politeness of the pupils, the pupils overall good behavior, the many examples of good leadership throughout the school and the sense of identity through the schools status as a sports comprehensive and school of football. The academy teams of Motherwell Football Club use the school's sports facility for training purposes. Catchment area As well as being a secondary school for the Forgewood suburb of Motherwell, Braidhurst is also in the catchment area of other areas of Motherwell including North Motherwell, Jerviston and even Mossend.

It was originally erected for the late Frasnian Hadrosteus, from the Kellwasserkalk facies. Later, the family was subjectively subsumed into Dinichthyidae due to Hadrosteus' anatomical similarities with Dunkleosteus and Dinichthys. In 1967, Obruchev placed the enigmatic arthrodire incertae sedis Diplognathus, from the Eastern American Famennian, within Hadrosteidae, on the basis of how the two genera have similar denticle (\\"teeth\\") patterns of the inferognathals, though, Denison (1978) contests this placement. With the redefining of Dinichthyidae as a monotypic family for Dinichthys, and only a few other genera placed within Dunkleosteidae, Hadrosteidae is now seen as a valid family again.Carr, R.K. & W.J.

Wot Cheor is a greeting in Geordie dialect.  The show  Wot Cheor Geordie was a radio variety programme broadcast from the BBC Regional Studios in Newcastle. It began in the early 1940s and continued until 1956. It featured songs, plays and sketches, all in dialect; some were only moderately successful, while others were considered outstanding. Generally, the programme was a great success. In 1948 the programme title was included under the \\"variety\\" category in the BBC publicity file and it this fact brought it to the notice of London, who requested a recording. A tape was sent from Newcastle with an assurance that the dialect would be toned down and this could be done without losing its humour, Prior to this, in the 1930s the BBC attempted to expand into the regions by using local materials and local dialects (but very carefully and gently). The North East of England was no exception, and on 9 June 1937 a sketch was broadcast. It utilised the fictitious character \\"Geordie Marley\\" who had been created by Newcastle comic writer Captain Walter Dierecx . The sketch was as follows :- Programme announcer ‚Äì This is This is the Northern Programme. Here‚Äôs a tale about the day the Marley‚Äôs spent going to the place where the Blaydon Races were run. The famous races that the song was written about were held seventy-five years ago today‚Ä¶.... Marley ‚Äì (after humming the concluding bars) Hillo!, ah‚Äôll back ye knaa wat the tune is?

These are some of the regulars :- * In 1948 Leonard Barras sent a sketch for consideration, was immediately accepted and became as regular writer * Jack Robson, an Annitsford, (Northumberland born schoolmaster who wrote many songs, many of which were written for, or used in, the programme. He is responsible for \\"Whereivvor ye gan ye‚Äôre sure te find a Geordie\\" which became the show‚Äôs signature tune. * Norman Turnbull too was a regular source of material for the show * In the 1950s Bobby Thompson, known as \\"The Little Waster\\" was introduced to the programme and was a great success from the beginning. He has been describes as the \\"Tyneside Al Read\\" but this is unfair as both men developed independently. He appeared fairly regularly on the programme informing the audience of his wife, debt and the dole * The Northumberland Serenaders and the Willie Walker Band became famous and appreciated as far away as London * The Five Smith Brothers, who opened the act with \\"Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.

Background Since the end of the 7th century, Armenia was under Arab dominion and headed by an ostikan (governor) representing the Umayyad, and later Abbasid caliphates, and was the scene of numerous battles against the Byzantine Empire since the 9th century. To strengthen the Arab authority, these ostikans were implanted into various regions of Armenian emirs; the historical province of Vaspurakan was no exception to this. In opposition, the Armenian nobility created ishkhans (princes) to gradually extend their authority in the region. Biography =Youth and regency= Second son of Grigor-Derenik Artsruni, the Prince of Vaspurakan, and Sophia Bagratuni, the daughter of King Ashot I of Armenia, Gagik was born in 879 or 880. Upon the death of Grigor-Derenik in 887, Gagik Apumrvan Artsruni became regent of Vaspurakan (and later ishksan) and was given Grigor-Derenik's three children Gagik, Ashot-Sargis, and Gurgen. In response to Gagik Apumrvan Artsruni's defection in a military operation ordered by Smbat I, Gagik I Artsruni killed Gagik Apumrvan Artsruni and Ashot- Sargis was given the regency. In response to this, Smbat I promoted Gagik to the rank of general and Gurgen to marzpan (governor). =Ishkhan= Gagik succeeded his elder brother Ashot-Sargis as ishkhan in 904 and allowed Gourgen to rule over the southeastern possessions of the Artsruni family; both worked well together until the death of Gurgen in 923. After various rebel attacks, Gagik developed a talent for creating military and political strategies and worked towards decreasing the number of Muslim enclaves of Vaspurakan. =King= Gagik was an ally of the Sajid emir of Azerbaijan Yusuf ibn Abi'l-Saj, from whom he received recognition as king in 908, against the Bagratid Smbat I. His state was recognized by the Byzantine Empire, who awarded him the title of \\"prince of princes\\" traditionally borne by the pre- eminent Armenian ruler, and his legitimacy received a further boost when the Armenian catholicos, John V the Historian, abandoned Muslim-ruled Dvin for Vaspurakan in 924. However, Gagik later reversed his position and allied himself with Smbat's son and successor, Ashot II. He is also notable as the founder of the Armenian Cathedral of the Holy Cross.

He is a longtime columnist for Canada's History magazine (formerly The Beaver) and the author of many books. He has twice won the Governor General's Literary Awards. Moore immigrated to Canada with his family in 1954, was raised in Nelson and Vancouver, British Columbia, and did undergraduate studies at the University of British Columbia. He began his historical career as a researcher with the historic sites service of Parks Canada at Canada's largest historic site reconstruction, the eighteenth-century Fortress of Louisbourg on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia.Canadian Who's Who, article \\"Christopher Hugh Moore.\\" After graduate studies at the University of Ottawa (M.A., History, 1977) and work with the Heritage Canada Foundation, Moore made Louisbourg the subject of his first book, Louisbourg Portraits: Life in An Eighteenth Century Garrison Town.Toronto: Macmillan of Canada, 1982, Toronto: McClelland and Stewart, 20C00 Books Louisbourg Portraits explores eighteenth century social history through archivally based studies of ordinary people: an accused thief, a merchant, a young bride, a migrant fisherman, and a soldier.

It combines Moore's characteristic biographical focus with a new emphasis on political over social history. Moore argues that the constitutional processes of the 1860s compare well against the executive-driven deals that failed in the 1980s and 1990s due to a greater inclusion of opposing voices in the Confederation debates. He outlines the principles of Responsible Government laid out by William Warren Baldwin, Joseph Howe, Louis Hippolyte Lafontaine and Robert Baldwin which inspired Macdonald, Cartier, McGee, and the Fathers as they framed the constitution. Canadian political commentator Dalton Camp called 1867 \\"just about the best book on our history I've ever read.\\"Toronto Star, December 16, 1998 In 2011, 1867 was named one of the twelve best Canadian political books of the previous twenty-five years and published as an ebook.

At Quebec the essence of the Canadian constitution‚Äîand Canadian nationhood‚Äîwas negotiated and laid out in 72 Resolutions. These became the basis of the British North America Act 1867 and remain central to Canada's constitution.

Moore has been nominated for three National Magazine Awards Parliamentary democracy After the publication of 1867: How the Fathers Made a Deal in 1997, Moore began publishing political commentaries on parliamentary democracy in Canada. His common theme has been the lack of accountability in Canadian political leadership. Moore relates this failing to the practice (traditionally rare among parliamentary democracies worldwide) of entrusting political party leadership selection to extra-parliamentary leadership contests in which thousands of party membership holders participate. Moore argues this process means Canadian party leaders, once selected, are in practice accountable to no one, and particularly not to the elected Members of Parliament, a situation leading to the breakdown in parliamentary accountability often referred to in Canada as the \\"democratic deficit\\" or the \\"friendly dictatorship.\\" Moore's argument remains a minority view although the Reform Act, 2015 introduced in the House of Commons by Michael Chong MP has attempted to increase leaders' accountability to the parliamentary caucus.\\" . All Canadian political parties remain committed to extra-parliamentary leadership selection. Most commentators accept that making Canadian leaders accountable to members of parliament is, as prominent political scientist Donald Savoie has said, \\"unthinkable.\\"Christopher Moore, \\"The Heave - Backbenchers Fight Back,\\" National Post, Toronto, February 13, 2001. Cultural politics Long active in the Writers' Union of Canada, Moore served as national chair in 1999‚Äì2000. From 2001 to 2007, he represented creators on the board of Access Copyright, Canadian Copyright Licensing Agency. A supporter of collective licensing of copyright, he has been a critic of Access Copyright's failure to represent creators' interests fully and effectively.

It is found in West Africa from Guinea to the Niger Delta in Nigeria, the intervening countries being Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Togo, and Benin. This species was previously known as Leptopelis hyloides, but that name is actually a junior synonym of Leptopelis viridis. Etymology The specific name spiritusnoctis means \\"spirit of the night\\" and is derived from the Latin words noctu meaning \\"at night\\", and spiritus meaning \\"spirit\\" or \\"soul\\". It describes the nocturnal habit of this species and its whispering buzzing sounds, audible all over the forests during rainy nights. Description Males measure and females in snout‚Äìvent length. The colouration is variable< the dorsum is light brown to dark chocolate brown<; the anterior loreal region, canthus rostralis, and supratympanal fold are darker in colour. There is a dark, interorbital triangle that points backward and typically connects to a reversed Y- or U-like pattern in the scapular region; there may also be irregular shaped, scattered dark spots and points. An irregularly shaped lumbar blotch is almost always present. The iris is silver-grey, or yellow to red in its uppermost forth to third. The tadpoles are eel-shaped and darkly pigmented. They measure in total length, or larger. Habitat and conservation The species' natural habitats are primary and secondary evergreen forests, semi-deciduous forests, and forest galleries in savanna. It also occurs in heavily degraded former forest. It is often found in moist areas and near streams. Breeding takes place in very small puddles and temporary ponds. The tadpoles move to water after hatching from the burrows near the water where the eggs had been deposited. Leptopelis spiritusnoctis is an extremely common species that is not facing significant threats.

A busway system was recommended over an expansion of the Queensland Rail network given the existing strong role of buses in the regional transport system and its cost effectiveness compared with constructing rail lines. It was envisaged that feeder buses would serve both busway and rail stations, allowing buses to service low-density communities while bypassing peak hour traffic congestion by using the busways where appropriate.Queensland Government, Department of Transport and Main Roads. Integrated Regional Transport Plan for South East Queensland (IRTP) 1997 page 39 Retrieved 28 July 2012 This recommendation built upon the Brisbane City Council's earlier Brisbane Busway Plan which was broadened into the SEQ Regional Busway Network plan. A network of five busways was planned which, inter alia, would improve the operation of the bus fleet while reducing maintenance and running costs. Construction History Eleanor Schonell Bridge In August 1996, the Queensland Government approved the South East Transit Project which began planning and constructing the South East Busway between the Brisbane central business district and Eight Mile Plains. The first section of the busway, between the CBD and Woolloongabba, opened in September 2000 to coincide with the first match of the Olympic Games Football Tournament at the Gabba.

This was to relieve bus congestion on the CBD streets and the Victoria Bridge (caused by traffic lights operating at both ends of the bridge, seriously inhibiting the clearance of buses from the Cultural Centre busway station in peak hour.\\"Council wants to drive buses underground to keep them out of Brisbane CBD\\" Brisbane Times 6 December 2011 Significance and Criticism Brisbane's network of busways is significant because it is the largest scale adoption of busways as a form of rapid public transport in Australia. Patronage numbers have grown over the busways' 12-year existence from carrying 0 to 70 million passengers annually, reducing the growth in traffic congestion and air pollution and minimising the need for new vehicular routes into the city along the busway corridors. Brisbane's busways were designed to allow buses to service low-density suburbs and bypass peak hour congestion on major roads, linking with the rail network to improve public transport connectivity. This allows a balance between the convenience of localised bus services with the efficiency of medium haul commuter transport to the city's activity centres in a highly radial city like Brisbane.\\"Busway Solutions to meet Rapid Urban Growth\\" Sinclair Knight Merz Retrieved 8 August 2012. However, it can be argued that a system designed like this increases the likelihood of dead running and underuse of available capacity. Dead running occurs on any highly peak-oriented radial bus or rail system where additional peak direction buses are added into the schedule or operated as \\"rocket\\" express routes. After or before their run in the peak direction the buses generally run empty, whether to head out for another run, back to the depot or to be positioned prior to starting another run (such as, in the afternoon peak). On the busways many of these dead running vehicles are perceived to be underused and to contribute to congestion. The counterargument to this is that this issue is related more to the dominance of the CBD as the largest employment centre within the region and that to change this requires a shift to forced interchanging for many people, likely reducing the attractiveness of the service. It is also true that these routes generally, but not always, bypass the most congested sections of the busway network by using alternative approaches to the city such as the Captain Cook Bridge or Water Street. The perceived under-use of available capacity is where less than full services travel on the busway. It is argued that this is caused by low patronage on the off-busway portion of many suburban routes. This has been argued to lead to busway route duplication where these services then enter a busway corridor and continue on into the inner city without being full, and to increased busway vehicular congestion and unnecessary air pollution created from vehicle emissions without a correspondingly high number of passengers.Moore, Tony. Brisbane Times. 2 December 2011. \\"Call to get half-full buses off city bridge\\". Retrieved 8 August 2012. The counterargument to this is that by running these buses on the busway they provide additional available capacity to the often overcrowded spine services and that that forced interchange onto overcrowded spine services would reduce the attractiveness of bus as an travel option. The decision not to connect the Legacy Way tunnel to the Northern Busway to provide for shorter travel times from the western suburbs to the city (via the Inner City Bypass) was also criticised as short-sighted given the lack of planned busway construction to those suburbs.Sherine Conyers. Westside News, Quest Newspapers (Queensland). 3 April 2012. \\"Longer trips for bus commuters after Legacy Way bus link goes begging\\". Retrieved 8 August 2012.

There are two types of sl√°tur; bl√≥√∞m√∂r (Icelandic) or \\"blood pudding\\" and lifrarpylsa (\\"liver sausage\\"). The first is similar to Irish and British black pudding, although it does not contain the spices used in British and Irish cuisine. They are also much smoother in texture. Ingredients Ingredients for sl√°tur are sheep's blood, chopped or minced sheep's fat, rye flour, oatmeal, flour, salt, About Both blood pudding and liver pudding are prepared in a similar fashion. Pouches are cut and sewn from the stomach, as in traditional haggis, or artificial non-edible pouches can be used. They are filled with a mixture of sliced/minced fat (m√∂r) or suet, flour (rye and oats), rolled oats and either blood or finely-minced liver (sometimes kidney is also blended in). The pouches are sewn shut after filling, then they are slow boiled for 2‚Äì3 hours. Sl√°tur may be eaten hot or cold and sometimes it is pickled in whey. Blood pudding has been made using sheep's blood in Iceland since ancient times and similar recipes exist in many countries, using pig's blood instead. In previous centuries moss was used instead of imported flour. Liver pudding seems to have come into being at a much later stage; references to it appear during the mid-19th century. Offal is food of the autumn, prepared at the traditional slaughter time. Right up until the mid 20th century sl√°tur was made in every home in Iceland. Many families made slatur together as a common activity. After the economic crash in autumn 2008, there appears to have been a considerable increase in sl√°tur sales, as sl√°tur is cheap food. Prepared and cooked offal, both blood and liver pudding, is available in stores all year round but many people consider it largely as √æorramatur, at the festival of √ûorrabl√≥t, celebrated in January and February each year. Sl√°tur is presented alongside other savoury and sour dishes at this time of year, including h√°karl. Blood pudding is sometimes served with cinnamon and sugar, or sometimes with raisins. When it is served hot is usually eaten with mashed or boiled potatoes and swede/yellow turnip. It can also be cut it into slices and fried in a pan. Liver pudding is also eaten hot with potatoes. Pickled or cold new blood pudding and liver pudding are commonly cut into slices and served with porridge or a type of cold rice pudding called hr√≠sgrj√≥nagrautur.
