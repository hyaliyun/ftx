Description and classification  Dried thistle flowers at the end of summer Members of this genus grow as annual or biennial plants. The erect stem is tall, branched and furrowed but not spiny. The large, alternate leaves are waxy-lobed, toothed and thorny, as in other genera of thistle. The lower leaves are sessile (attached to the stem without petiole). The upper leaves have a clasping base. They have large, disc-shaped pink-to-purple, rarely white, solitary flower heads at the end of the stem. The flowers consist of tubular florets. The phyllaries under the flowers occur in many rows, with the outer row with spine-tipped lobes and apical spines. The fruit is a black achene with a white pappus.Flora of North America, Vol. 19, 20 and 21 Page 164, Blessed milkthistle, Silybum marianum (Linnaeus) Gaertner, Fruct. Sem.

Mild gastrointestinal distress is the most common adverse event reported for milk thistle. The incidence is the same as for placebo. A laxative effect for milk thistle has also been reported infrequently.  Claims of health benefits  Flowerhead of Silybum marianum For many centuries extracts of milk thistle have been recognized as \\"liver tonics.\\" Milk thistle has been reported to have protective effects on the liver and to greatly improve its function. It is typically used to treat liver cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis (liver inflammation), toxin-induced liver damage including the prevention of severe liver damage from Amanita phalloides ('death cap' mushroom poisoning), and gallbladder disorders. Reviews of the literature covering clinical studies of silymarin vary in their conclusions. A review examining studies with a double-blind protocol concluded that milk thistle and its derivatives has no significant effect on mortality or course of disease in individuals with alcoholic and/or hepatitis B or C disease.

It was the last propeller-driven fighter to serve with the Royal Navy, and one of the fastest production single reciprocating engine aircraft ever built. Developed during the Second World War, the Sea Fury entered service two years after the war ended. It proved to be a popular aircraft with a number of overseas militaries, and was used during the Korean War in the early 1950s, as well as against the 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba. The Sea Fury's development was formally initiated in 1943 in response to a wartime requirement of the Royal Air Force (RAF), with the aircraft initially named Fury. As the Second World War drew to a close, the RAF cancelled their order for the aircraft; however, the Royal Navy saw the type as a suitable carrier aircraft to replace a range of increasingly obsolete or poorly-suited aircraft being operated by the Fleet Air Arm. Development of the Sea Fury proceeded, and the type began entering operational service in 1947. The Sea Fury has many design similarities to Hawker's preceding Tempest fighter, having originated from a requirement for a \\"Light Tempest Fighter\\"; both the Sea Fury's wings and fuselage originate from the Tempest but were significantly modified. Production Sea Furies were fitted with the powerful Bristol Centaurus engine, and armed with four wing-mounted Hispano V cannons. While originally developed as a pure aerial fighter aircraft, the definitive Sea Fury FB.11 was a fighter-bomber, the design having been found suitable for this mission as well. The Sea Fury attracted international orders as both a carrier and land-based aircraft. It was operated by countries including Australia, Burma, Canada, Cuba, Egypt, West Germany, Iraq, and Pakistan. The type acquitted itself well in the Korean War, fighting effectively even against the MiG-15 jet fighter.Wheeler 1992, p. 87. Although the Sea Fury was retired by the majority of its military operators in the late 1950s in favour of jet-propelled aircraft, a considerable number of aircraft saw subsequent use in the civil sector, and several remain airworthy in the 21st century as heritage and racing aircraft. Development =Origins= Sea Fury T.20 at 2014 Reno Air Races The Hawker Fury was an evolutionary successor to the successful Hawker Typhoon and Tempest fighters and fighter-bombers of the Second World War. The Fury's design process was initiated in September 1942 by Sydney Camm, one of Hawker's foremost aircraft designers, to meet the Royal Air Force's requirement for a lightweight Tempest Mk II replacement; the Tempest, while a successful aircraft, had been viewed as being heavy and oversized for typical fighter duties. Developed as the \\"Tempest Light Fighter (Centaurus)\\", the semi-elliptical wing of the Tempest was incorporated, but was shortened in span by eliminating the central bay of the wing centre-section, the inner part of the undercarriage wells now extending almost to the aircraft centreline, instead of being situated level with the fuselage sides.Goulding 1986, pp. 130‚Äì131.Brown 1980, p. 82.Buttler 2000, p. 46. The fuselage was broadly similar in form to that of the Tempest, but was a fully monocoque structure, while the cockpit level was higher, affording the pilot better all-round visibility.Bridgman 1998, p. 127. The project was formalised in January 1943 when the Air Ministry issued Specification F.2/42 around the \\"Tempest Light Fighter\\".Darling 2002, pp. 12‚Äì13. This was followed up by Specification F.2/43, issued in May 1943, which required a high rate of climb of not less than 4,500 ft/min (23 m/s) from ground level to 20,000 feet (6,096 m), good fighting manoeuvrability and a maximum speed of at least 450 mph (724 km/h) at 22,000 feet (6,705 m). The armament was to be four 20mm Hispano V cannon with a total capacity of 600 rounds, plus the capability of carrying two bombs each up to 1,000 pounds (454 kg). In April 1943, Hawker had also received Specification N.7/43 from the Admiralty, who sought a navalised version of the developing aircraft; in response, Sidney Camm proposed the consolidation of both services' requirements under Specification F.2/43, with the alterations required for naval operations issued on a supplemental basis. Around 1944, the aircraft project finally received its name; the Royal Air Force's version becoming known as the Fury and the Fleet Air Arm's version as the Sea Fury.Darling 2002, pp. 12‚Äì14. Six prototypes were ordered; two were to be powered by Rolls- Royce Griffon engines, two with Centaurus XXIIs, one with a Centaurus XII and one as a test structure. Hawker used the internal designations P.1019 and P.1020 respectively for the Griffon and Centaurus versions, while P.1018 was also used for a Fury prototype which was to use a Napier Sabre IV.Darling 2002, p. 13. The first Fury to fly, on 1 September 1944, was NX798 with a Centaurus XII with rigid engine mounts, powering a Rotol four-blade propeller. Second on 27 November 1944 was LA610, which had a Griffon 85 and Rotol six- blade contra-rotating propeller. By now, development of the Fury and Sea Fury was closely interlinked so that the next prototype to fly was a Sea Fury, SR661, described under \\"Naval Conversion.\\" NX802 (25 July 1945) was the last Fury prototype, powered by a Centaurus XV. LA610 was eventually fitted with a Napier Sabre VII, which was capable of developing 3,400 to 4,000 hp (2,535‚Äì2,983 kW); this aircraft became possibly the fastest reciprocating- engine Hawker aircraft after reaching a speed of around 485 mph (780 km/h).Mason 1991, pp. 342‚Äì347. =Naval version= Sea Fury FB.11 VR930 with wings folded, at Kemble Airfield, Gloucestershire, England. Operated by the Royal Navy Historic Flight. With the end of the Second World War in Europe in sight, the RAF began cancelling many aircraft orders. Thus, the RAF's order for the Fury was cancelled before any production examples were built because the RAF already had large numbers of late Mark Spitfires and Tempests and viewed the Fury as an unnecessary overlap with these aircraft. Although the RAF had pulled out of the programme, development of the type continued as the Sea Fury. Many of the Fleet Air Arm's carrier fighters were Lend-Lease Corsairs or Seafires. The Seafire had considerable drawbacks as a naval aircraft, notably the narrow undercarriage, whilst the Corsairs had to be returned or purchased. The Admiralty opted to procure the Sea Fury as the successor to these aircraft.Darling 2002, p. 14.Mackay 1991, pp. 4‚Äì5. While the RAF contract had been cancelled, the Fury prototypes were completed and used for work in developing the Sea Fury as well as for the export market. The first Sea Fury prototype, SR661, first flew at Langley, Berkshire, on 21 February 1945, powered by a Centaurus XII engine. This prototype had a \\"stinger\\"-type tailhook for arrested carrier landings, but lacked folding wings for storage. SR666, the second prototype, which flew on 12 October 1945, was powered by a Bristol Centaurus XV that turned a new, five-bladed Rotol propeller and featured folding wings. Specification N.7/43 was modified to N.22/43, now representing an order for 200 aircraft. Of these, 100 were to be built at Boulton-Paul's Wolverhampton factory.Darling 2002, pp. 13‚Äì15. In 1945, the original order to specification N.22/43 was reduced to 100 aircraft; as a result, the manufacturing agreement with Boulton-Paul was ended and all work on the Sea Fury transferred to Hawker Aircraft's facilities at Kingston. This included the construction of what was intended to be a Boulton-Paul built Sea Fury prototype, VB857, which was transported to Kingston in January 1945; this aircraft, built to the same standard as SR666, first flew on 31 January 1946. Immediately upon completion of the first three airframes, the flight testing programme began at Kingston. It was soon discovered that the early Centaurus engine suffered frequent crankshaft failure due to a poorly designed lubrication system, which led to incidents of the engine seizing while in mid- flight. The problem was resolved when Bristol's improved Centaurus 18 engine replaced the earlier engine variant.Darling 2002, pp. 15‚Äì16. =Into production= The first production model, the Sea Fury F Mk X (later Sea Fury F.10), flew in September 1946. With the completion of flight testing at Boscombe Down in 1946, the trials process was repeated aboard the aircraft carrier . Carrier testing revealed directional stability issues related to rudder effectiveness during landing, and this was resolved by the adoption of a tail wheel lock, which also improved the wheel retraction behaviour. Several rectifying design changes were made by Hawker in response to feedback from the test pilots, including the adoption of a five-bladed Rotol propeller to greatly reduce overspeed tendencies; a re-designed rudder assembly, to increase rudder effectiveness; Dynafocal engine mountings to reduce vibration at low speeds, and an improved undercarriage with greater flexibility. These changes greatly improved the aircraft's deck landing characteristics. Arrestor hook trials initially revealed the Sea Fury to be prone to missing the wires; this was rapidly resolved by modifications to the hook dampener mechanism.Darling 2002, pp. 15‚Äì17.Mackay 1991, p. 5. By March 1947, production Sea Furies were already being produced for the Fleet Air Arm. The fourth and sixth production aircraft were used in further trials with HMS Illustrious, and the main change from the earlier aircraft was the adoption of a longer, stiffer arrestor hook. Fifty Mk X Sea Furies were produced. These were identical to the SR666 prototype except for the Centaurus 18 engine and four- bladed propeller. At least 20 of the 50 aircraft performed in the aircraft's intensive trials programme. Following the successful completion of weapons trials at the A&AEE; Boscombe Down, the Sea Fury was cleared for operational use on 31 July 1947.Darling 2002, pp. 18‚Äì19. Hawker Aircraft continued to develop and refine the Sea Fury Mk X, resulting in the more capable Sea Fury Mk 11, also known as the Sea Fury FB.11. This upgraded model had several improvements, most notable being the hydraulically powered wing folding mechanism which eased flight deck operations and the adoption of new weapons for performing air-to-ground combat. Iraq ordered a two-seat Sea Fury model and the British Admiralty followed suit. During testing, the rear canopy collapsed, leading to a redesign of the type's two-seat cockpit prior to entering service. Designated as the Sea Fury T.20, a total of 60 trainers were manufactured for the Fleet Air Arm between 1950 and 1952.Darling 2002, p. 20.Mackay 1991, p. 23. The Royal Navy bought a total of 615 Sea Furies, mostly of the Mk 11 standard.Mackay 1991, p. 10. =Export market= Hawker Aircraft was keen to market the Sea Fury to foreign operators, and conducted an intense sales drive for their export version of the aircraft, designated Sea Fury F.50. On 21 October 1946, the Royal Netherlands Navy placed an order for ten F.50 aircraft, which were basically identical to the FAA's Sea Fury Mk X aircraft, to equip the aircraft carrier HNLMS Karel Doorman (ex-).Darling 2002, p. 73. The Dutch also ordered twelve of the later Fury FB.60s in 1948 and these were delivered in 1950. A manufacturing licence was also acquired for the production of twenty-five Sea Fury FB.51s by Fokker Aircraft in the Netherlands, which were delivered from 1951 onwards.Wilson 1993 Sea Fury FB.11 Miss Merced modified for unlimited racing. It had previously served in the Royal Canadian Navy. The Sea Fury became an export success, being purchased both to operate on foreign aircraft carriers and for purely land-based roles by a number of nations, including Australia, West Germany, Iraq, Egypt, Burma, Pakistan and Cuba. Several of the nations that did not have active aircraft carriers often had the tail hooks and catapult hooks removed from their aircraft. A final variant, the Sea Fury T.20S was developed by Hawker for West Germany as target tow aircraft; these remained in service into the 1970s. Upon the type's withdrawal from military service, a large number of Sea Furies were sold to private individuals, often as a racing aircraft due to its high speed.Mackay 1991, pp. 28, 35‚Äì37, 41. The final production figures for all marks reached around 860 aircraft. Design Sea Fury FB.11 fighters of the Royal Canadian Navy The Sea Fury is a navalised aircraft, capable of operating from the aircraft carriers of the Royal Navy. It was heavily based on preceding Hawker fighter aircraft, particularly the Tempest; features such as the semi-elliptical wing and fuselage were derived directly from the Tempest but featured significant refinements, including significant strengthening to withstand the stresses of carrier landings. While the Sea Fury was lighter and smaller than the Tempest, advanced aspects of the Sea Fury's design such as its Centaurus engine meant it was also considerably more powerful and faster; the Sea Fury has the distinction of being the final and fastest of Hawker's reciprocating engine aircraft, as well as being one of the fastest production reciprocating engine fighters ever produced.Darling 2002, pp. 22‚Äì26, 28. The performance of the Sea Fury was striking; in comparison with the 15 years older Hawker Fury biplane the Sea Fury was nearly twice as fast and had double the rate of climb despite far heavier equipment and greater range. The Sea Fury Mk X was capable of attaining a maximum speed of 460 mph and climb to a height of 20,000 feet in under five minutes. The Sea Fury was reportedly a highly aerobatic aircraft with favourable flying behaviour at all heights and speeds, although intentional spinning of the aircraft was banned during the type's military service.Darling 2002, pp. 42‚Äì43. During flight displays, the Sea Fury could demonstrate its ability to perform rapid rolls at a rate of 100 degrees per second, attributed to the spring tab equipped ailerons. For extra thrust on takeoff Jet Assisted Take Off (JATO) could be used.Darling 2002, pp. 36‚Äì38.Mackay 1991, p. 16. RAN FB.11 aircraft in 2011 The Sea Fury was powered by the newly developed Bristol Centaurus reciprocating engine, which drove a five-bladed propeller. Many of the engine's subsystems, such as the fully automated cooling system, cockpit gauges, and fuel booster pump were electrical, powered by an engine-driven generator supplemented by two independent batteries. The hydraulic system, necessary to operate the retractable undercarriage, tail hook, and flaps, was pressurised to 1,800 psi by an engine-driven pump. If this failed, a hand pump in the cockpit could also power these systems. A pneumatic pump was driven by the engine for the brakes. Internal fuel was stored in a total of five self-sealing fuel tanks, two within the fuselage directly in front of the cockpit and three housed within the wings.Darling 2002, pp. 22‚Äì23, 27. Various avionics systems were used on Sea Furies; in this respect it was unusually well equipped for an aircraft of the era. Many aircraft would be equipped with on-board radar, often the ARI 5307 ZBX, which could be directly integrated with a four-channel VHF radio system. Several of the navigational aids, such as the altimeter and G2F compass, were also advanced; many of these subsystems would appear on subsequent jet aircraft with little or no alteration.Darling 2002, p. 38. Other aspects of the Sea Fury, such as the majority of the flight controls, were conventional. Some controls were electrically powered, such as the weapons controls, on-board cameras, and the gyro gunsight. Although the Sea Fury had been originally developed as a pure air superiority fighter, the Royal Navy viewed the solid construction and payload capabilities of the airframe as positive attributes for ground attack as well; accordingly, Hawker tested and cleared the type to use a wide range of armaments and support equipment.Mackay 1991, p. 7. Each aircraft had four wing-mounted 20 mm Hispano V cannon, with up to 16 rocket projectiles, or a combination of 500 lb or 1000 lb bombs being carried too. Other loads included 1000 lb incendiary bombs, mines, type 2 smoke floats or 90 gallon fuel tanks.Darling 2002, p. 19. The Sea Fury could also be fitted with both vertical and oblique cameras with a dedicated control box in the cockpit, for photo reconnaissance missions. Other ancillary equipment included chaff to evade hostile missile attack and flares.Darling 2002, pp. 23, 36‚Äì38. Operational history =United Kingdom= A Sea Fury FB.11 launches from in 1951 Sea Fury T.20 two-seat trainer of No. 1831 Squadron RNVR at RNAS Stretton, Cheshire, in 1951 778 Naval Air Squadron was the first unit of the Fleet Air Arm to receive the Sea Fury, with deliveries commencing in February 1947 to the squadron's Intensive Flying Development Unit, while 787 Squadron, the Naval Air Fighting Development Squadron, received the Sea Fury in May that year.Williams Aeroplane Monthly January 1986, p. 33.Sturtivant and Balance 1994, pp. 98‚Äì98, 109. The first operational unit to be equipped with the Sea Fury was 803 Naval Air Squadron of the Royal Canadian Navy, which replaced Seafires with Sea Furies in August 1947, with 807 Naval Air Squadron was the first operational Royal Navy Sea Fury squadron when it received the aircraft in September that year. The Seafire was ill-suited to carrier use, as the pilot's poor view of the deck and the aircraft's narrow undercarriage made both landings and takeoffs difficult. Consequently, the Sea Fury F Mk X replaced the Seafire on most carriers.\\"Hawker Sea Fury aircraft profile.\\" Aircraft Database of the Fleet Air Arm Archive 1939‚Äì1945. Retrieved: 23 March 2006. For some years the Sea Fury and Seafire operated alongside each other, with the shorter-range Seafire operating as a fleet defence fighter while the Sea Fury was employed as a longer-range fighter-bomber.Darling 2002, pp. 19‚Äì20. Sea Furies were issued to Nos. 736, 738, 759 and 778 Squadrons of the Fleet Air Arm. The F Mk X was followed by the Sea Fury FB.11 fighter-bomber variant, which eventually reached a production total of 650 aircraft. The Sea Fury remained the Fleet Air Arm's primary fighter-bomber until 1953, at which point jet-powered aircraft, such as the Hawker Sea Hawk and Supermarine Attacker, were introduced to operational service.Mackay 1991, pp. 10, 17. The Sea Fury FB.11 entered service with the fighter squadrons of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR) in August 1951. The RNVR units also operated the Sea Fury T.20 two-seat trainer version from late 1950 to give reserve pilots experience on the type before relinquishing their Supermarine Seafire aircraft. RNVR units which were equipped with the Sea Fury were Nos. 1831, 1832, 1833, 1834, 1835 and 1836 Squadrons. No. 1832, based at RAF Benson, was the last RNVR squadron to relinquish the type in August 1955 for the jet-powered Supermarine Attacker.Mackay 1991, p. 17. Korean War Following the outbreak of the Korean War on 25 June 1950, Sea Furies were dispatched to the region as a part of the British Commonwealth Forces Korea, Britain's contribution to the United Nations multinational task force to assist South Korea following an invasion by North Korea. Sea Furies were flown throughout the conflict, primarily as ground-attack aircraft, from the Royal Navy light fleet carriers , , , and the Australian carrier .\\"Sea Fury History\\". Unlimited Air Racing. Retrieved: 9 March 2007. After a Fleet Air Arm Seafire was shot down by a United States Air Force Boeing B-29 Superfortress on 28 July 1950, all Commonwealth aircraft were painted with black and white invasion stripes.Hobbs 2011, pp. 30‚Äì36. The first Sea Furies arrived with 807 Naval Air Squadron embarked on Theseus, which relieved in October 1950. Operations on Theseus were intense, and the Sea Furies of 807 Squadron flew a total of 264 combat sorties in October. During a brief rest period at the Japanese port of Iwakuni the catapult was found to be excessively worn, necessitating the launch of Sea Furies with RATOG assistance until it was repaired. In December 1950, Sea Furies conducted several strikes on bridges, airfields, and railways to disrupt North Korean logistics, flying a further 332 sorties without incurring any losses. At this early point in the war little aerial resistance was encountered and the biggest threats were ground-based anti-aircraft fire or technical problems.Darling 2002, pp. 51‚Äì52. In addition to their ground attack role, Sea Furies also performed air patrols. In this role a total of 3,900 interceptions were carried out, although none of the intercepted aircraft turned out to be hostile. During the winter period, the Sea Furies were often called upon as spotter aircraft for UN artillery around Inchon, Wonsan, and Songiin.Darling 2002, pp. 52‚Äì53. In April 1951, 804 Naval Air Squadron operating off Glory, replaced 807 Squadron, which in turn was replaced by Sydney in September 1951 with 805 and 808 Squadron RAN. The Australian carrier air group flew 2,366 combat sorties. In January 1952, Glory with 804 NAS returned to relieve Sydney following a refit in Australia. For the rest of the war Glory and Ocean relieved each other on duty. In 1952, the first Chinese MiG-15 jet fighters appeared. On 8 August 1952, Lieutenant Peter \\"Hoagy\\" Carmichael, of 802 Squadron, flying Sea Fury WJ232 from HMS Ocean, was credited with shooting down a MiG-15, marking him as one of only a few pilots of a propeller-driven aircraft to shoot down a jet during the Korean War.Mackay 1991, p. 2. The engagement occurred when Sea Furies and Fireflies were engaged by eight MiG-15s, during which one Firefly was badly damaged while the Sea Furies escaped unharmed. Some sources claim that this is the only successful engagement by a British pilot in a British aircraft during the Korean War, although a few sources claim a second MiG was downed or damaged in the same action.\\"UN Air-to-Air Victories during the Korean War, 1950‚Äì1953\\".

Australia was one of three Commonwealth nations to operate the Sea Fury, with the others being Canada and Pakistan. The type was operated by two frontline squadrons of the Royal Australian Navy, 805 Squadron and 808 Squadron; a third squadron that flew the Sea Fury, 850 Squadron, was also briefly active. Two Australian aircraft carriers, HMAS Sydney and HMAS Vengeance, employed Sea Furies in their air wings. The Sea Fury was used by Australia during the Korean War, flying from carriers based along the Korean coast in support of friendly ground forces. The Sea Fury would be operated by Australian forces between 1948 and 1962.Mackay 1991, p. 31. =Burma= Between 1957 and 1958, Burma received 21 Sea Furies, the majority of them being ex-FAA aircraft.

On 23 June 1948, the first aircraft was accepted at RCAF Rockcliffe. The type was quickly put to use replacing Canada's existing inventory of Seafires, taking on the primary role of fleet air defence operating from the aircraft carrier . Two Canadian squadrons operated the Sea Fury, Nos. 803 and 883 Squadrons, which were later renumbered as 870 and 871. Pilot training on the Sea Fury was normally conducted at the RCN's HMCS Shearwater land base. Landing difficulties with the Sea Fury were experienced following the RCN's decision to convert to the U.S. Navy's deck landing procedures, which were prone to overstressing and damaging the airframes, as the Sea Fury had been designed for a tail-down landing attitude.Darling 2002, pp. 73‚Äì74. The Sea Fury would be operated between 1948 and 1956 by the RCN, whereupon they were replaced by the jet-powered McDonnell F2H Banshee. The retired aircraft were put into storage, and some were subsequently purchased by civilians.Mackay 1991, p. 28. =Cuba= Museo Giron, Cuba in 2006 In 1958 during the Cuban Revolution, the Fuerza A√©rea del Ejercito de Cuba (FAEC) purchased a total of 17 refurbished (ex-Fleet Air Arm) Sea Furies from Hawker, comprising fifteen FB.11s and two T.20 trainers. The aircraft were briefly flown by FAEC prior to the ousting of President Fulgencio Batista and the assumption of power by Fidel Castro. Following the change in government, the Sea Furies were retained by the Fuerza A√©rea Revolucionaria (\\"Revolutionary Air Force\\"; FAR); these aircraft proved difficult to keep operational, partially because the new military lacked personnel experienced with the type. In April 1961, during the Bay of Pigs Invasion, air support for the Cuban exiles' Brigade 2506 was provided by ex-USAF, CIA-operated Douglas B-26B Invaders; United States President John F. Kennedy had decided against involving U.S. Navy aircraft.Ferrer 1982, p. 184. The only FAR fighter aircraft to see combat were three Sea Furies and five Lockheed T-33 armed jet trainers belonging to the Escuadr√≥n Persecuci√≥n y Combate (\\"Pursuit & Combat Squadron\\"), based at the San Antonio de los Ba√±os and Antonio Maceo air bases.Mario E. \\"Bay of Pigs: In the Skies Over Gir√≥n\\". 2000, (18 March 2014.)Cooper, Tom. \\"Clandestine US Operations: Cuba, 1961, Bay of Pigs\\". 2007, (18 March 2014.) Museum of the Revolution in Havana In pre-emptive attacks on 15 April, two Sea Furies were destroyed on the ground, one at Ciudad Libertad and one in a hangar near Moa. During the ensuing aerial combat, a single airborne Sea Fury was lost during the Invasion.Mackay 1991, p. 39. In the early hours of 17 April, Brigade 2506 began to land at Playa Gir√≥n. Around 06:30, a FAR formation composed of three Sea Furies, one B-26 and two T-33s started attacking the exiles' ships. At about 06:50, south of Playa Larga, the transport ship Houston was damaged by rockets and cannons from FAR aircraft, including Sea Furies piloted by Major Enrique Carreras Rojas and Captain Gustavo Bourzac; Houston caught fire and was abandoned. While attempting to land at an airbase, Carreras Rojas's Sea Fury was attacked and damaged by a CIA B-26; he was able to abort his approach and escape. Carreras Rojas later shot down another B-26. While attempting to shoot down a Curtiss C-46 transport aircraft, Nicaraguan-born pilot Carlos Ulloa crashed in the Bay of Pigs around 08:30, either due to an engine stall or being hit by anti-aircraft fire. Around 09:30, multiple FAR aircraft destroyed an ammunition ship, Rio Escondido. A Sea Fury piloted by Lieutenant Douglas Rudd also destroyed a B-26. =Netherlands= The Netherlands was the first export customer for the Sea Fury, and the Netherlands Royal Navy operated the aircraft from two of their aircraft carriers, both of which were named HNLMS Karel Doorman as they were operated at separate periods from one another. It was common for Royal Netherlands Navy vessels to operate alongside Royal Navy ships, thus Dutch Sea Furies also regularly operated from FAA land bases and RN carriers. During 1947, Dutch Sea Furies operating from HNLMS Karel Doorman were employed in a ground support capacity against insurgent fighters in the Dutch East Indies. The Dutch procured and licence-built additional Sea Furies for carrier operations, although the type was ultimately replaced by the jet-powered Hawker Sea Hawk from the late 1950s onwards.Mackay 1991, p. 33. =Pakistan= One of the largest export customers for the type was Pakistan. In 1949, an initial order for 50 Sea Fury FB.60 aircraft for the Pakistan Air Force was placed. A total of 87 new-build Sea Furies were purchased and delivered between 1950 and 1952; some ex-FAA and Iraqi Sea Furies were also subsequently purchased. The aircraft was operated by three frontline squadrons, Nos. 5, 9, and 14 Squadrons. The Sea Fury began to be replaced by the jet-powered North American F-86 Sabre in 1955, and the last Sea Furies in Pakistani service were ultimately retired in 1960.Mackay 1991, pp. 35‚Äì36.

Sea Furies were overhauled by Hawker Aircraft at their factory at Blackpool during 1959 and supplied to civil companies in Germany, equipped with target-towing gear for Luftwaffe contract flying. Some of these aircraft survive. Furies sold to Iraq were purchased by restorers in the late 1970s and are now also owned and operated by civilians.\\"Hawker Sea Fury/Fury Registry\\". warbirdregistry.org. Retrieved: 24 September 2011. Around a dozen heavily modified Sea Furies are raced regularly at the Reno Air Races .

These include Dreadnought and Furias, which have had Wasp Major engines installed. Ex-Iraqi Fury 326 (C/N 41H/643827) restored in New Zealand in the 1980s was painted as WJ232, the aircraft 'Hoagy' Carmichael flew during the 9 August 1952 action which resulted in him being credited with the destruction of a MiG-15 jet fighter,.Take Off magazine, Part 84, pp. 2338‚Äì2339. The aircraft was sold in Australia in its Royal Navy markings, with civil registration VH-SHF. The original WJ232 was sold by the Royal Navy back to Hawker, refurbished and delivered to Burma as UB467 in 1958. Many additional airframes remain as static displays in museums worldwide. One of these, ex-RCN WG565, is on display in Calgary, Alberta, in Canada. It was ferried to Alberta for instructional use in the Alberta Provincial Institute of Technology by Lieutenant Commander Derek Prout. On 1 April 1958, Flying Officer Lynn Garrison, of the 403 City of Calgary Squadron, RCAF, made the final Canadian military flight for this aircraft type. An airframe is on display outside the Granma Memorial, as part of the Museum of the Revolution in Havana. A second airframe forms an outside part of the Museo Giron in Playa Gir√≥n. During the 1989 Prestwick (Glasgow) Air Show, a Sea Fury had to be ditched in the sea as the port landing gear was stuck. The pilot parachuted to safety.Sea Fury - RNHF documentary On 31 July 2014 a Hawker Sea Fury T.20 (VX281) owned by Royal Navy Historic Flight made a controlled crash landing at the RNAS Culdrose Air Day. During the display, smoke was seen coming from the plane's engine. During an approach for an emergency landing, the undercarriage extended but failed to lock, leading to a belly landing. Lt Cdr Chris Gotke, 44, the pilot, suffered no injuries and was later awarded the Air Force Cross for his decision to continue to fly the aircraft to safety rather than parachute out and abandon it; he later stated that \\"The safety of the crowd was never a factor because the aircraft was fully controllable.\\" This aircraft returned to the air in September 2017 following repairs.BBC News Cornwall ‚Äì Aircraft crashes on to runway at Royal Navy Air Day retrieved 13 August 2014.

This should not be confused with the unrelated notion (widely used in algebraic topology) of a compactly generated space -- one whose topology is generated (in a suitable sense) by its compact subspaces.  Definition  A topological group G is said to be compactly generated if there exists a compact subset K of G such that :\\\\langle K\\\\rangle = \\\\bigcup_{n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}} (K \\\\cup K^{-1})^n = G. So if K is symmetric, i.e. K = K ‚àí1, then :G = \\\\bigcup_{n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}} K^n.  Locally compact case  This property is interesting in the case of locally compact topological groups, since locally compact compactly generated topological groups can be approximated by locally compact, separable metric factor groups of G. More precisely, for a sequence :Un of open identity neighborhoods, there exists a normal subgroup N contained in the intersection of that sequence, such that :G/N is locally compact metric separable (the Kakutani-Kodaira-Montgomery-Zippin theorem).

Parts of the hemelytra of a typical bug An elytron (; from Greek ·ºîŒªœÖœÑœÅŒøŒΩ \\"sheath, cover\\"; plural: elytra ). is a modified, hardened forewing of certain insect orders, notably beetles (Coleoptera) and a few of the true bugs (Hemiptera) such as the family Schizopteridae; in most true bugs, the forewings are instead called hemelytra (sometimes alternatively spelled as \\"hemielytra\\"), as only the basal half is thickened while the apex is membranous. An elytron is sometimes also referred to as a shard. Description The elytra primarily serve as protective wing-cases for the hindwings underneath, which are used for flying. To fly, a beetle typically opens the elytra and then extends the hindwings, flying while still holding the elytra open, though some beetles in the families Scarabaeidae and Buprestidae can fly with the elytra closed. In some groups, the elytra are fused together, rendering the insect flightless. Some of the ground beetles (family Carabidae) are a good example of this.

It was the evolution of a prototype called the SCAMP (Special Computer APL Machine Portable) that was developed at the IBM Palo Alto Scientific Center in 1973. In January 1978, IBM announced the IBM 5110, its larger cousin, and in February 1980 IBM announced the IBM 5120. The 5100 was withdrawn in March 1982. When the IBM PC was introduced in 1981, it was originally designated as the IBM 5150, putting it in the \\"5100\\" series, though its architecture was unrelated to the IBM 5100's. SCAMP, the prototype In 1973, Bill Lowe was instrumental in fostering an engineering prototype called SCAMP (Special Computer APL Machine Portable) created by Dr. Paul Friedl and a team at the IBM Los Gatos Scientific Center. SCAMP has been dubbed in PC Magazine as \\"the world's first personal computer\\" Friedl, Paul J., \\"SCAMP: The Missing Link in the PCs Past\\", PC Magazine, PC 2, No. 6, November, 1983, pp.190-197 The IBM Los Gatos engineering prototype and a design model by IBM Industrial designer Tom Hardy, were utilized internally by Lowe in his early efforts to demonstrate the viability of creating a single-user computer.Atkinson, P, (2013) DELETE: A Design History of Computer Vapourware, London: Bloomsbury Publishing. Description The IBM 5100 is based on a 16-bit processor module called PALM (Put All Logic in Microcode). The IBM 5100 Maintenance Information Manual also referred to the PALM module as the controller. The PALM could directly address 64 KiB of memory. Some configurations of the IBM 5100 had Executable ROS (ROM) and RAM memory totalling more than 64 KiB, so a simple bank switching scheme was used. The actual APL and BASIC interpreters were stored in a separate Language ROS address space which the PALM treats as a peripheral device. Prices ranged from $11,000 (16k model) to $20,000 (64k). =Portable personal computer= BYTE in December 1975 stated \\"Welcome, IBM, to personal computing\\". Describing the 5100 as \\"a 50-lb package of interactive personal computing\\", the magazine stated that with the company's announcement \\"personal computing gains an entry from the industry's production and service giant\\", albeit \\"at a premium price\\". A single integrated unit provided the keyboard, five-inch CRT display, tape drive, processor, several hundred KiB of read-only memory containing system software, and up to 64 KiB of RAM. It was the size of a small suitcase, weighed about 55 lb (25 kg), and could be transported in an optional carrying case, hence the \\"portable\\" designation. In 1975 it was an amazing technical accomplishment to package a complete computer with a large amount of ROM and RAM, CRT display, and a tape drive into a machine that small; it was two more years before the similar but much cheaper Commodore PET was released - and it was not portable. Earlier desktop computers of approximately the same size, such as the HP 9830, did not include a CRT nor nearly as much memory. =Display= The 5100 has an internal CRT (5\\" diagonal) and displays 16 lines of 64 characters. IBM provided an option switch to allow the user to display all 64 characters of each line, or only the left or right 32 characters (interspersed with spaces). Also there was a switch to display the first 512 bytes of main memory in hexadecimal for diagnostic purposes. =Mass storage= Mass storage was provided by removable quarter-inch cartridge (QIC) magnetic tape drives that use standard DC300 cartridges to store 204 Kbytes. One drive was installed in the machine and a second (Model 5106) could be added in an attached box. The data format included several types and were written in 512 byte records. =External monitor= An external video monitor (or modified television receiver) could be connected to the IBM 5100 via a BNC connector on the back panel. While the 5100 had a front panel switch to select between white on black or black on white for the internal display, this switch did not affect the external monitor, which only offered bright characters on a black background. The vertical scan rate was fixed at 60 Hz. =Communications adapter= Also in September 1975 IBM announced the IBM 5100 Communications Adapter, that allowed the 5100 to transmit data to and receive data from a remote system. It made the 5100 appear the same as an IBM 2741 Communications Terminal and was designed to be able to communicate with IBM 2741 compatible machines in start- stop mode using the EBCD (Extended Binary Coded Decimal) notation. EBCD was similar to the more common IBM EBCDIC code, but not identical. =Research Device Coupler= In Volume 16, Number 1, Page 41 (1977) of the IBM Systems Journal the article \\"The IBM 5100 and the Research Device Coupler ‚Äî A personal laboratory automation system\\" read: \\"A small laboratory automation system has been developed by using the IBM 5100 Portable Computer in conjunction with the Research Device Coupler. This compact system provides a dedicated, high-level- language computer and a versatile data acquisition and control interface for experiments in which data rates do not exceed 9600 baud. Two experiments exemplify the use of the system. The Research Device Coupler described in this paper is a prototype of the IBM 7406 Device Coupler.\\" =Different models= Available with 16 KB, 32 KB, 48 KB or 64 KB of main storage, the 5100 sold for between $8,975 and $19,975 (between c. $ and $ in today's dollars). Programming languages The 5100 was available with APL, BASIC, or both programming languages. At the time of introduction, APL was generally available only on mainframe computers, and most desktop sized computers such as the Wang 2200 or HP 9830 offered only BASIC. Machines that supported both languages provided a toggle switch on the front panel to select the language. When the engineers at IBM asked one beta tester, Donald Polonis, for his analysis, he commented that if folks had to learn APL to use it, the IBM 5100 would not make it as a personal computer. He tried to impress the fact that a personal computer had to be easy to use to be accepted. Presumably, the special APL character set and APL keyboard were the primary obstacles to newcomers learning APL easily. APL had powerful features for manipulating data as vectors and matrices, while the competing HP 9830 had to offer language extensions on an add-on ROM for matrix operations. Although not meant for regular users, the maintenance manual described a keyboard sequence to switch the 5100 into a maintenance mode. In this mode it was possible to read and write directly in RAM memory, video memory, CPU registers, interrupt vectors, clock counter, etc, using hexadecimal codes equivalent to assembly language. This allowed writing sophisticated programs directly into RAM. As this mode was a single-user system effectively running without an operating system, a determined user could manage the memory space and write stable multi-tasking programs using interrupts. Problem-solver libraries IBM offered three problem-solver libraries, contained in magnetic tape cartridges, with the IBM 5100 to provide more than 1000 interactive routines applicable to mathematical problems, statistical techniques and financial analyses. Emulator in microcode The 5100 was based on IBM's innovative concept that, using an emulator written in microcode, a small and relatively cheap computer could run programs already written for much larger, and much more expensive, existing computers, without the time and expense of writing and debugging new programs. Two such programs were included: a slightly modified version of APLSV, IBM's APL interpreter for its System/370 mainframes, and the BASIC interpreter used on IBM's System/3 minicomputer. Consequently, the 5100's microcode was written to emulate most of the functionality of both a System/370 and a System/3. IBM later used the same approach for its 1983 introduction of the XT/370 model of the IBM PC, which was a standard IBM PC XT with the addition of a System/370 emulator card.

After the death of his grandfather Emperor Frederick III, Wilhelm became crown prince at the age of six, retaining that title for more than 30 years until the fall of the empire on 9 November 1918. During World War I, he commanded the 5th Army from 1914 to 1916 and was commander of the Army Group German Crown Prince for the remainder of the war. Crown Prince Wilhelm became head of the House of Hohenzollern on 4 June 1941 following the death of his father and held the position until his own death on 20 July 1951. Early life Wilhelm was born on 6 May 1882 in the Marmorpalais of Potsdam in the Province of Brandenburg. He was the eldest son of Wilhelm II, the last German Kaiser (Emperor) (1859‚Äì1941), and his first wife, Princess Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein (1858‚Äì1921). When he was born, his great-grandfather Wilhelm I was the emperor and his grandfather Crown Prince Frederick was the heir apparent, making Wilhelm third in line to the throne. His birth sparked an argument between his parents and his grandmother Crown Princess Victoria. Before Wilhelm was born, his grandmother had expected to be asked to help find a nurse, but since her son did everything he could to snub her, the future Wilhelm II asked his aunt Helena to help. His mother was hurt and his grandmother, Queen Victoria, who was the younger Wilhelm's great-grandmother, furious.Queen Victoria's Family, A Century of Photographs, Charlotte Zeepvat When his great-grandfather and grandfather both died in 1888, six-year-old Wilhelm became the heir apparent to the German and Prussian thrones. Wilhelm was a supporter of association football, then a relatively new sport in the country, donating a cup to the German Football Association in 1908 and thereby initiating the Kronprinzenpokal (now L√§nderpokal), the oldest cup competition in German football.\\"Kick it like Kronprinz\\" Spiegel Online. Retrieved 11 June 2009 The German club BFC Preussen was also originally named BFC Friedrich Wilhelm in his honour. In 1914, the Kaiser ordered the construction of Schloss Cecilienhof in Potsdam for Prince Wilhelm and his family. The Schloss was loosely inspired by Bidston Court in Birkenhead, England, resembling a Tudor manor. Completed in 1917, it became the main residence for the Crown Prince for a time. World War I Wilhelm had been active in pushing German expansion, and sought a leading role on the outbreak of war. Despite being only thirty-two and having never commanded a unit larger than a regiment, the German Crown Prince was named commander of the 5th Army in August 1914, shortly after the outbreak of World War I. However, under the well-established Prussian/German General Staff model then in use, inexperienced nobles who were afforded commands of large army formations were always provided with (and expected to defer to the advice of) experienced chiefs of staff to assist them in their duties. As Emperor, Wilhelm's father instructed the Crown Prince to defer to the advice of his experienced chief of staff Konstantin Schmidt von Knobelsdorf.Chief of Staff: Napoleonic Wars to World War I, David Zabecki In October 1914 Wilhelm gave his first interview to a foreign correspondent and the first statement to the press made by a German noble since the outbreak of war.Elter page 74Wiegand page 3 He denied promoting military solutions to diplomatic problems, and said this in English: From August 1915 onwards, Wilhelm was given the additional role as commander of the Army Group German Crown Prince. In 1916 his troops began the Verdun Offensive, a year-long effort to destroy the French armies that would end in failure. Wilhelm relinquished command of the 5th Army in November of that year, but remained commander of the Army Group German Crown Prince for the rest of the war. 1918‚Äì34 After the outbreak of the German Revolution in 1918, both Emperor Wilhelm II and the Crown Prince signed the document of abdication. On 13 November, the former Crown Prince fled Germany, crossed into the Netherlands at Oudvroenhoven and was later interned on the island of Wieringen (now part of the mainland), near Den Helder. In the autumn of 1921, Gustav Stresemann visited Wilhelm, and the former Crown Prince voiced an interest in returning to Germany, even as a private citizen. After Stresemann became chancellor in August 1923, Wilhelm was allowed to return after giving assurances that he would not engage in politics. He chose 9 November 1923 for this, which infuriated his father, who had not been informed about the plans of his son and who felt the historic date to be inappropriate. In June 1926, a referendum on expropriating the former ruling Princes of Germany without compensation failed and as a consequence, the financial situation of the Hohenzollern family improved considerably. A settlement between the state and the family made Cecilienhof property of the state but granted a right of residence to Wilhelm and Cecilie. This was limited in duration to three generations. The family also kept the ownership of Monbijou Palace in Berlin, Ole≈õnica Castle in Silesia, and Rheinsberg Palace until 1945. Meeting Adolf Hitler in 1933 Wilhelm broke the promise he had made to Stresemann to stay out of politics. Adolf Hitler visited Wilhelm at Cecilienhof three times, in 1926, in 1933 (on the \\"Day of Potsdam\\") and in 1935. Wilhelm joined Der Stahlhelm, which merged in 1931 into the Harzburg Front, a far-right organisation of those opposed to the democratic republic. The former Crown Prince was reportedly interested in the idea of running for Reichspr√§sident as the right-wing candidate against Paul von Hindenburg in 1932, until his father (who privately supported Hindenburg) forbade him from acting on the idea. After his plans to become president had been blocked by his father, Wilhelm supported Hitler's rise to power. 1934‚Äì51 After the murder of his friend Kurt von Schleicher, the former Chancellor, in the Night of the Long Knives (1934), he withdrew from all political activities. When Wilhelm realised that Hitler had no intention of restoring the monarchy, their relationship cooled. Upon his father's death in 1941, Wilhelm succeeded him as head of the House of Hohenzollern, the former German imperial dynasty. He was approached by those in the military and the diplomatic service who wanted to replace Hitler, but Wilhelm turned them down. After the ill-fated assassination attempt on 20 July 1944, Hitler nevertheless had Wilhelm placed under supervision by the Gestapo and had his home at Cecilienhof watched. In January 1945, Wilhelm left Potsdam for Oberstdorf for a treatment of his gall and liver problems. His wife Cecilie fled in early February 1945 as the Red Army drew closer to Berlin, but they had been living apart for a long time. At the end of the war, Wilhelm's home, Cecilienhof, was seized by the Soviets. The palace was subsequently used by the Allied Powers as the venue for the Potsdam Conference. At the end of the war, Wilhelm was captured by French Moroccan troops in Baad, Austria and was interned as a (World War I) war criminal. Transferred to Hechingen, Germany, he lived for a short time in Hohenzollern Castle under house arrest before moving to a small five-room house at F√ºrstenstra√üe 16 in Hechingen where he died on 20 July 1951, of a heart attack. Three days later, his opponent in the Battle of Verdun, Marshal Philippe P√©tain, died in prison in France.The Life Of Crown Prince William by Klaus Jonas, 1961 pp. 214-30. Wilhelm and his wife are buried at Hohenzollern Castle. Family and children With his father and his son, Prince Wilhelm, in 1927 Wilhelm married Duchess Cecilie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (20 September 1886 ‚Äì 6 May 1954) in Berlin on 6 June 1905. After their marriage, the couple lived at the Crown Prince's Palace in Berlin in the winter and at the Marmorpalais in Potsdam. Cecilie was the daughter of Grand Duke Frederick Francis III, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg- Schwerin (1851‚Äì1897) and his wife, Grand Duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna of Russia (1860‚Äì1922). Their eldest son, Prince Wilhelm of Prussia, was killed fighting for the German Army in France in 1940.

He was the longest serving justice of the Supreme Court of Canada.  Early life and career  Born in Meaford, Canada West (now Ontario) to a Congregationalist minister, Duff received a Bachelor of Arts in mathematics and metaphysics from the University of Toronto in 1887. After graduation, he taught at Barrie Collegiate Institute while studying for the bar. Duff later took courses at Osgoode Hall Law School and was called to the Ontario Bar in 1893. Duff practiced as a lawyer in Fergus, Ontario after being called to the bar. In 1895, Duff moved to Victoria, British Columbia and continued his career there. In 1895, he was made a Queen's Counsel. In 1903, he took part, as junior counsel for Canada, in the Alaska Boundary arbitration. In 1923 Mount Duff (Yakutat), also known as Boundary Peak 174 was named after him. Judicial and other appointments Bust of the Rt. Hon. Sir Lyman Duff in the Supreme Court of Canada building. In 1904, he was appointed a puisne judge of the Supreme Court of British Columbia. In 1906 was appointed a justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. On January 14, 1914, he was appointed to Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council.Appointment notice at Duff was the first and only Puisne Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada to be appointed to the Imperial Privy Council. In 1924 he was elected honorary bencher of Gray's Inn, at the recommendation of Lord Birkenhead. In 1931, he served as Administrator of the Government of Canada between the departure of Lord Bessborough for England and the arrival of Lord Tweedsmuir. Duff took on the position, as the Chief Justice was unavailable. As Administrator, Duff opened Parliament and read the Speech from the Throne on 12 March 1931, becoming the first Canadian-born person to do so. In 1933, Duff was appointed Chief Justice of Canada, succeeding to Chief Justice Anglin. He was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St. Michael and St. George the following yearAppointment notice at as a result of Prime Minister Richard Bennett's temporary suspension of the Nickle Resolution. When Governor General Lord Tweedsmuir died in office on February 11, 1940, Chief Justice Duff became the Administrator of the Government. He held the office for nearly four months, until King George VI appointed Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone as Governor General on June 21, 1940. Duff was the first Canadian to hold the position, even in the interim. A Canadian-born Governor General was not appointed until Vincent Massey in 1952. Duff also heard more than eighty appeals on the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, mostly Canadian appeals; however, he never heard Privy Council appeals from the Supreme Court of Canada while he served on the latter. The last Privy Council appeal heard by Duff was the 1946 Reference Re Persons of Japanese Race. In 1942, Duff served as the sole member of a Royal Commission constituted to examine the Liberal government's conduct in relation to the defence of Hong Kong. The resulting report, which completely exonerated the government, proved to be controversial, and was seen by many as a whitewash. Upon reaching the mandatory retirement age for judges in 1939, his term of office was extended by three years by special Act of Parliament; in 1943, his term of office was extended for another year by Parliament. He retired as Chief Justice in 1944. Impact J.L. Ilsley, J.C. McRuer, Sir Lyman Duff, John T. Hackett, K.C., W.L. Mackenzie King, Thibaudeau Rinfret. Duff employed a conservative form of statutory interpretation.

Bora Laskin attacked Duff's decisions, arguing that Duff used circular reasoning and hid his policy-laden decisions behind the doctrine of stare decisis., at 1069-70.

This is primarily a Mediterranean genus, occurring in desert and coastal habitats of Southern Europe, North Africa, the Canary Islands and the Middle East. The range of one species extends eastward into Central Asia. The genus consists of annual or biennial herbaceous plants with white, sub-silky hairs on the soft stems, growing to a height of 20‚Äì50 cm. They grow on uncultivated or disturbed land and roadsides. They are hardy, surviving in dry to very dry environments or cold spells. The small, alternate, entire leaves are elliptic to obovate. They have short petioles at the base of the stem but are sessile in the upper half. The solitary inflorescence grows at the top of the branches. The large, slightly convex receptacle shows numerous, yellowish orange, hermaphrodite disc florets and two whorls of yellow ray florets. They flower from March to July. The long, villous, involucral bracts end in an apical sharp-pointed spine. The achene is glabrous or is covered with short hairs. The essential oil of Pallenis spinosa consists for the main part of oxygenated sesquiterpenoids. Pallenis maritima is a protected plant in southern France.

The umbilical vein provides convenient access to the central circulation of a neonate for restoration of blood volume and for administration of glucose and drugs. The blood pressure inside the umbilical vein is approximately 20 mmHg.Wang, Y. Vascular biology of the placenta. in Colloquium Series on Integrated Systems Physiology: from Molecule to Function. 2010. Morgan & Claypool Life Sciences. Fetal circulation The unpaired umbilical vein carries oxygen and nutrient rich blood derived from fetal-maternal blood exchange at the chorionic villi. More than two-thirds of fetal hepatic circulation is via the main portal vein, while the remainder is shunted from the left portal vein via the ductus venosus to the inferior vena cava, eventually being delivered to the fetal right atrium. Closure Closure of the umbilical vein usually occurs after the umbilical arteries have closed. This prolongs the communication between the placenta and fetal heart, allowing for a sort of autotransfusion of remaining blood from the placenta to the fetus. Within a week of birth, the neonate's umbilical vein is completely obliterated and is replaced by a fibrous cord called the round ligament of the liver (also called ligamentum teres hepatis). It extends from the umbilicus to the transverse fissure, where it joins with the falciform ligament of the liver to separate segment 4 from segments 2 and 3 of the left hepatic lobe. Recanalization Under extreme pressure, the round ligament may reopen to allow the passage of blood. Such recanalization may be evident in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Patients with cirrhosis experience rapid growth of scar tissue in and around the liver, often functionally obstructing nearby vessels. Vessel occlusion increases vascular resistance and therefore leads to hypertension. In portal hypertension, the vessels surrounding the liver are subjected to abnormally high blood pressure--so high, in fact, that the force of the blood pressing against the round ligament is sufficient to recanalize the structure. This leads to a condition called Caput medusae. Catheterization A newborn baby has a patent umbilical vein for at least a week after birth. This umbilical vein may be catheterised for ready intravenous access. It may be used as a site for regular transfusion in cases of erythroblastosis or hemolytic disease. It also provides a route for measuring central venous pressure. Additional images Image:Gray31.pngModel of human embryo 1.3 mm. long. Image:Gray39.pngScheme of placental circulation.

An alpine garden tries to imitate the conditions of the plants' place of origin. One example of this is using large stones and gravel beds, rather than the soil that naturally grows there. Though the plants can often cope with low temperatures, they dislike standing in damp soil during the winter months. The soil used is typically poor (sandy) but extremely well-drained. One of the main obstacles in developing an alpine garden is the unnatural conditions which exist in some areas, particularly mild or severe winters and heavy rainfall, such as those present in the United Kingdom and Ireland. This can be avoided by growing the plants in an alpine house or unheated greenhouse, which tries to reproduce the ideal conditions.

The genus is named after the dryads, the tree nymphs of ancient Greek mythology. The classification of Dryas within the Rosaceae has been unclear.. The genus was formerly placed in the subfamily Rosoideae, but is now placed in subfamily Dryadoideae.. The species are superficially similar to Geum (with which they share the common name avens), Potentilla and Fragaria (strawberry). However, Dryas are distinct in having flowers with eight petals (rarely seven or up to ten), instead of the five petals found in most other genera in the Rosaceae. The flowers are erect and white with a yellow centre (Dryas integrifolia, Dryas octopetala) or pendulous and all-yellow (Dryas drummondii), and held conspicuously above the small plants. This makes them very popular in rockeries and alpine gardens. The hybrid Dryas √ó suendermannii, with cream coloured flowers, has gained the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Award of Garden Merit. Dryas tolerates a wide variety of unshaded habitats, including alpine situations with sand or gravel substrate, similar substrates in flat tundra lowlands, and also fen habitats upon organic substrate where some shading from adjacent sedges or shrubs may occur. The Younger Dryas and Older Dryas stadials are geological periods of cold temperature that are named after Dryas octopetala, which flourished during that time and is used as a fossil indicator of those periods.

In 1951, a freelance salesman pitched G.W. a sketch of some proposed bank-type partitions for the United Auto Workers headquarters in Detroit. The company won the contract to manufacture the floor-to-ceiling movable walls. In 1954, the focus of Modern Products shifted toward office environments, in response to the development of modular office partitions. To reflect this new focus, the company changed its name to Modern Partitions By 1956, the business had annual revenues of $472,000 and a workforce of 50 employees, whom G.W. called ‚Äúmembers.‚Äù In 1961, G.W.‚Äôs teenage son, Dick Haworth, began working at the family business, sweeping floors and operating plant machinery. By 1964, he was an assistant sales manager, and within two years he was promoted to vice president for research and development. When he left in 1966 to serve in the U.S. Army, the company had 90 employees and annual sales of $2 million. When Dick returned from his military service in 1969, he assumed responsibility for manufacturing and new product development. His goal was to produce a new type of office furniture ‚Äî the office module system.\\"Lifetime Achievement Dick Haworth\\" Grand Rapids Business Journal, 2002-6-21 ‚ÄúMy father ended up going to a hardware store, getting a lot of bits and pieces and dumping them on a table ‚Äî and inventing the prewired partition.

In 1971, Dick introduced the Modern Office Modules (MOM) system and significantly altered the company's direction.\\"So, who is Dick Haworth?\\"(video), Interior Design Magazine, 2015-9-14 Sales grew to $6 million the following year. In 1976, Dick, then 33, took over for his dad as president and CEO. G.W.‚Äôs role shifted to board chairman. Under Dick's leadership, the company's name changed to Haworth. He grew the company by 400 percent over the next 20 years. The company focused exclusively on contract office furniture and sold its partition and movable-wall business to Trendway. Dick patented the first cubicle wall panels with internal wiring.Dukcevich, David (2000) \\"Richard Haworth Prefers Not To Take Stock\\", Forbes.com, September 29, 2000.

The top-selling panels, called Uni-Group, could be easily snapped together and eliminated the client's need to pay electricians to wire office spaces. In 1977, Haworth International Inc. was formed to set up foreign licenses for the manufacture and marketing of office interior systems. A year later, Haworth opened a national showroom in Chicago's Merchandise Mart. =1980‚Äì2000: Rapid rise and expansion= During the next two decades, Haworth developed several industry firsts ‚Äî from the first mobile office system to panel-to-panel cabling systems. Haworth also earned awards for its business and design practices, such as environmental sustainability, leadership, community service, and member job satisfaction. Under Dick's leadership, the company grew at twice the industry average.International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 39. St. James Press, 2001 By 1980, Haworth had 830 employees and annual sales of $67 million. A year later, the company moved to its headquarters to One Haworth Center in Holland. Showrooms were open or renovated in 18 North American cities and four international locations. In the early 1980s, when office seating was added to Haworth product offering being built at the Holland, Michigan Haworth Plant, the company continued its movement toward providing complete workspace solutions. By 1986, Haworth had become the third- largest office furniture manufacturer in the U.S., with sales topping $300 million and a workforce of 2,600 employees. Along with the popular panels, products include office chairs, filing cabinets, and fabrics. Later in the 1980s, Haworth pursued an aggressive expansion in North America, Europe, and Asia. In 1988, Haworth became a global company, undertaking a strategic expansion.\\"\\"Dick Haworth tells story of his family business\\" MLive.com 2010-11-3 The business acquired 15 companies in Europe and North America, then built in Asia to expand its sales and dealer network.

It means we have high- quality jobs in all of the markets that we are involved in.‚Äù The company grew dramatically in the 1990s with the acquisition office and business furniture makers around the globe such as Mueller Furniture Co., Kinetics, and Lunstead. Haworth almost quadrupled in size in the early 1990s, while the percentage of income spent on sales, administrative, and other expenses went down significantly. By 1990, Haworth had 4,240 employees and $600 million in sales. The next year, it reorganized into four regions: North America, Europe, the Middle East/Africa, and the Asia Pacific & Central America/South America. In 1992, Dick's son, Matthew Haworth, formally joined the team as a dealer associate ‚Äî the same year Haworth became the first furniture manufacturer to achieve ISO 9001 certification. Haworth reached $1 billion in annual revenue in 1994. In 1995, the company's Ideation Group formed, applying user-based research to breakthrough concepts and products such as Crossings, Irrigator, Flo, Eddy, Drift, and Wake. That same year, 30 percent of sales come from overseas. In 1996 competitor Steelcase was found at fault in a patent infringement suit brought by Haworth in 1985. Steelcase was ordered to pay $211.5 million in damages and interest. In 1997, manufacturing expanded with production at its Shanghai plant. Over a 10-year period, the company acquired 25 companies in Europe, North America, and Asia. Dick Haworth developed a lengthy process of getting to know possible acquisition targets. He explained his system in an article he authored for the January/February 1995 Mergers & Acquisitions magazine, detailing how his firm sometimes worked for five or six years with companies it hoped to buy, moving cautiously toward formal acquisition talks. For Haworth, the long period of getting to know the target company paid off. =2000 to Present: a global focus= In 2000, Haworth passed the $2 billion mark in annual revenues.

(; 8 October 1850 ‚Äì 17 September 1936) was a French chemist of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He devised Le Chatelier's principle, used by chemists and chemical engineers to predict the effect a changing condition has on a system in chemical equilibrium. Early life Le Chatelier was born on 8 October 1850 in Paris and was the son of French materials engineer Louis Le Chatelier and Louise Durand. His father was an influential figure who played important roles in the birth of the French aluminium industry, the introduction of the Martin- Siemens processes into the iron and steel industries, and the rise of railway transportation. Le Chatelier's father profoundly influenced his son's future. Henry Louis had one sister, Marie, and four brothers, Louis (1853‚Äì1928), Alfred (1855‚Äì1929), George (1857‚Äì1935), and Andr√© (1861‚Äì1929). His mother raised the children by regimen, described by Henry Louis: \\"I was accustomed to a very strict discipline: it was necessary to wake up on time, to prepare for your duties and lessons, to eat everything on your plate, etc. All my life I maintained respect for order and law. Order is one of the most perfect forms of civilization.\\"L. Guillet, R√©vue de m√©tallurgie, special edition, January 1937 As a child, Le Chatelier attended the Coll√®ge Rollin in Paris. At the age of 19, after only one year of instruction in specialized engineering, he followed in his father's footsteps by enrolling in the √âcole Polytechnique on 25 October 1869. Like all the pupils of the Polytechnique, in September 1870, Le Chatelier was named second lieutenant and later took part in the Siege of Paris. After brilliant successes in his technical schooling, he entered the √âcole des Mines in Paris in 1871. Le Chatelier married Genevi√®ve Nicolas, a friend of the family and sister of four fellow students of the Polytechnique. They had seven children, four girls and three boys, five of whom entered scientific fields; two died preceding Le Chatelier's death. Career Despite training as an engineer, and even with his interests in industrial problems, Le Chatelier chose to teach chemistry rather than pursue a career in industry. In 1887, he was appointed head of the general chemistry to the preparatory course of the √âcole des Mines in Paris. He tried unsuccessfully to get a position teaching chemistry at the √âcole polytechnique in 1884 and again in 1897. Biblioth√®que de La Sorbonne, NuBIS) At the Coll√®ge de France, Le Chatelier succeeded Sch√ºtzenberger as chair of inorganic chemistry. Later he taught at the Sorbonne university, where he replaced Henri Moissan. At the Coll√®ge de France, Le Chatelier taught: :*Phenomena of combustion (1898) :*Theory of chemical equilibria, high temperature measurements and phenomena of dissociation (1898‚Äì1899) :*Properties of metal alloys (1899‚Äì1900) :*Iron alloys (1900‚Äì1901) :*General methods of analytical chemistry (1901‚Äì1902) :*General laws of analytical chemistry (1901‚Äì1902) :*General laws of chemical mechanics (1903) :*Silica and its compounds (1905‚Äì1906) :*Some practical applications of the fundamental principles of chemistry (1906‚Äì1907) :*Properties of metals and some alloys (1907) After four unsuccessful campaigns (1884, 1897, 1898 and 1900), Le Chatelier was elected to the Acad√©mie des sciences (Academy of Science) in 1907. He was also elected to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1907. In 1924, he became an Honorary Member of the Polish Chemical Society. Scientific work In chemistry, Le Chatelier is best known for his work on his principle of chemical equilibrium, Le Chatelier's principle, and on varying solubility of salts in an ideal solution. He published no fewer than thirty papers on these topics between 1884 and 1914. His results on chemical equilibrium were presented in 1884 at the Acad√©mie des sciences in Paris. Le Chatelier also carried out extensive research on metallurgy and was one of the founders of the technical newspaper La revue de m√©tallurgie (Metallurgy Review). Part of Le Chatelier's work was devoted to industry. For example, he was a consulting engineer for a cement company, the Soci√©t√© des chaux et ciments Pavin de Lafarge, today known as Lafarge Cement. His 1887 doctoral thesis was dedicated to the subject of mortars: Recherches exp√©rimentales sur la constitution des mortiers hydrauliques (Experimental Research on the Composition of Hydraulic Mortars). Le Chatelier in 1901 attempted the direct combination of the two gases nitrogen and hydrogen at a pressure of 200 atm and 600 ¬∞C in the presence of metallic iron. An air compressor forced the mixture of gases into a steel Berthelot bomb, where a platinum spiral heated them and the reduced iron catalyst.4\\\\. \\"Henri Le Chatelier: His Publications,\\" Ceram. Abs., 16, (Oct., 1937) A terrific explosion occurred which nearly killed an assistant. Le Chatelier found that the explosion was due to the presence of air in the apparatus used. And thus it was left for Haber to succeed where several noted French chemists, including Thenard, Sainte Claire Deville and even Berthelot had failed. Less than five years later, Haber and Claude were successful in producing ammonia on a commercial scale, acknowledging that the account of Le Chatelier's failed attempt had accelerated their research. Near the end of his life, Le Chatelier wrote, \\"I let the discovery of the ammonia synthesis slip through my hands. It was the greatest blunder of my scientific career‚Äù. =Le Chatelier's principle= Le Chatelier's Principle states that a system always acts to oppose changes in chemical equilibrium; to restore equilibrium, the system will favor a chemical pathway to reduce or eliminate the disturbance so as to restabilize at thermodynamic equilibrium. Put another way, > If a chemical system at equilibrium experiences a change in concentration, > temperature or total pressure, the equilibrium will shift in order to > minimize that change. This qualitative law enables one to envision the displacement of equilibrium of a chemical reaction. For example: a change in concentration of a reaction in equilibrium for the following equation: :N2(g) + 3H2(g) ‚áå 2NH3(g) If one increases the pressure of the reactants, the reaction will tend to move towards the products to decrease the pressure of the reaction. However consider another example: in the contact process for the production of sulfuric acid, the second stage is a reversible reaction: :2SO2(g) + O2(g) ‚áå 2SO3(g) The forward reaction is exothermic and the reverse reaction is endothermic. Viewed by Le Chatelier's principle a larger amount of thermal energy in the system would favor the endothermic reverse reaction, as this would absorb the increased energy; in other words the equilibrium would shift to the reactants in order to remove the stress of added heat. For similar reasons, lower temperatures would favor the exothermic forward reaction, and produce more products. This works in this case, since due to loss of entropy the reaction becomes less exothermic as temperature increases; however reactions that become more exothermic as temperature increases would seem to violate this principle. His time in politics It was typical for scientists and engineers of the time to have a very scientific vision of the industry. In the first issue of La revue de m√©tallurgie, Le Chatelier published an article describing his convictions on the subject,H.L. Le Chatelier, \\"Role of Science in Industry\\" in La revue de m√©tallurgie, n¬∞1, 1904 page 1 to 10 discussing the scientific management theory of Frederick Winslow Taylor. In 1928, he published a book on Taylorism. Le Chatelier was politically conservative. In 1934, he published an opinion on the French forty-hour work week law in the Brussels publication Revue √©conomique internationale. However, in spite of certain anti-parliamentarian convictions, he kept away from any extremist or radical movements. His brother Alfred Le Chatelier, a former soldier, opened the Atelier de Glatigny in the rural area of Glatigny (Le Chesnay), near Versailles in 1897. The workshop made sandstone ceramics, high-quality porcelain and glassware. In 1901 the critic Henri Cazalis (alias Jean Lahor), listed the workshop as one of the best producers in France of Art Nouveau ceramics. Henry Louis Le Chatelier seems to have encouraged Alfred's workshop and assisted with experiments in the composition of porcelain and the reactions of quartz inclusions, and also designed a thermoelectric pyrometer to measure temperature in the kilns.

He attended Barnsley Grammar School and the University of Sheffield, where he supplemented his student grant with appearances as a professional wrestler, going under the ring name \\"Leon Arras the Man From Paris\\". He adopted that name from a wrestler who didn't turn up to a match one night, for whom Glover stood in. His wrestling style incorporated a lot of comedy, including the catchphrases \\"ask 'im ref\\" and \\"'ow about that then\\". In 1954 he married his first wife Elaine, and became a teacher at the same Barnsley school where he had been a pupil. He taught English and French from 1954 until 1970, some of it at Longcar Central School, Barnsley, where he met Barry Hines who was also teaching there. He managed to combine this with regular performances as \\"Leon Arras\\", whose appearances included bouts on World of Sport, and in Paris, Milan, Zurich and Barcelona. Acting career Glover's first acting job came playing Mr Sugden, the comically overbearing sports teacher in Ken Loach's film Kes (a job offered to him when Barry Hines, who wrote the film, suggested him to the director). Although untrained, Glover proved to be a skilled and flexible character actor, using techniques learnt during his wrestling career. His large bald head, stocky build, and distinctive voice, with his Yorkshire accent, garnered him many roles as tough guys and criminals. He played Bottom in A Midsummer Night's Dream (BBC TV, 1981) and had a recurring role in the classic sitcom Porridge as dim-witted prison inmate Cyril Heslop who, when accused of being illiterate, utters the memorable line \\"I read a book once! Green, it was.\\" He played Quilp in The Old Curiosity Shop, and lent his voice to a number of animated characters, including the \\"gaffer\\" of the \\"Tetley Tea Folk\\" in a long-running series of television advertisements for Tetley tea, the voice behind the advertising slogan \\"Bread wi' nowt taken out\\" for Allinson bread, and the voice of \\"Big Pig\\", the mascot for the long-running Now That's What I Call Music! album series, appearing on the TV adverts for Now 3, Now 4 and Now 5. He also appeared in An American Werewolf in London, The First Great Train Robbery, Jabberwocky, Alien 3, Leon the Pig Farmer and as General Douglas in a Bollywood hit 1942: A Love Story. He appeared seven times in Play for Today, in three of them as part of a recurring trio of Yorkshiremen: The Fishing Party, Shakespeare or Bust and Three for the Fancy. Glover's performance in Kes led to parts at the Royal Court Theatre, London, notably in Lindsay Anderson's The Changing Room (1971). A season with Britain's Royal Shakespeare Company followed, where his roles included Charles the wrestler (and, drawing on his wrestling experience, the fight arranger) in As You Like It, and a robust Peter in Romeo and Juliet. For the Royal National Theatre he appeared in The Mysteries (as God, creating the world with the help of a real fork-lift truck), Saint Joan and Don Quixote. In the film Brannigan he claimed to have lost the only fight in his acting career, fighting John Wayne. His performance in The Mysteries secured additional work in the commercial theatre. The Canterbury Tales (\\"Chaucer wi' nowt taken owt\\")(West End) was followed by a return to television and the Play for Today series, both as writer and performer and, in turn, more screen roles. Glover wrote a horror themed episode of Theatre Box called Death Angel, which aired in 1981. He went on to play Lugg, the endearing rogue manservant to Albert Campion in the series Campion, and the role of a crook, Griffiths, in the Doctor Who story Attack of the Cybermen in 1985. He played Edouard Dindon in the original London cast of La Cage aux Folles. In 1991 he starred in the second episode of Bottom, in the episode \\"Gas\\", as the perpetually angry neighbour Mr Rottweiler. At the end of his life he acted in John Godber's rugby league comedy Up 'n' Under (1998). He was also the voice for the UNO Upholstery TV adverts in 1995 and 1996. Glover also wrote over 20 plays and short films. In 1982 he was a guest presenter in series six of Friday Night Saturday Morning, a late-night BBC chat show. Gravestone Personal life Glover was married twice, secondly to television producer Tara Prem, the daughter of TV actor Bakhshi Prem. He had two children, one daughter from his first marriage and one son from his second marriage. Glover developed a brain tumour and died in a London hospital on 24 July 1997. He is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London.

Growing up as part of her father's church choir in Halifax, Nova Scotia, White competed in local singing competitions as a teenager and later trained at the Halifax Conservatory of Music. In 1941 and 1944, she made her national and international debuts as a singer, receiving critical acclaim for her performances of both classical European music and African-American spirituals. White later completed tours throughout Europe, the Caribbean, and Central and South America. When vocal difficulties and cancer eventually contributed to her retirement in 1952, White settled in Toronto and subsequently taught young Canadian musicians such as Lorne Greene, Dinah Christie, Don Francks, Robert Goulet and Anne Marie Moss. One of White's final major public appearances was a special command performance for Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip in 1964. White was declared a person of national historic significance by the Government of Canada. Her original supporters in Nova Scotia went on to establish the Nova Scotia Talent Trust, awarding annual arts scholarships to both emerging and established local artists, and the government of Nova Scotia continues to award an annual Portia White Prize. In 2007, White was posthumously awarded a lifetime achievement award by the East Coast Music Association. Early life and family The alt=Photograph of the front of the New Horizons Baptist Church Portia May White was born June 24, 1911, in Truro, Nova Scotia, the third of 13 children born to Izie Dora (White) and William Andrew White. Her mother was a descendant of Black Loyalists in Nova Scotia, while her father was the son of former slaves from Virginia; he moved to Canada independently. William attended Acadia University in Nova Scotia, later becoming the first Black Canadian to graduate from Acadia with a Doctorate of Divinity. After World War I, the White family moved to Halifax, and William became the minister of Cornwallis Street Baptist Church. Many other members of Portia White's family went on to achieve distinction in Canadian political and cultural life, including her brothers Jack, a noted Canadian labour union leader; Bill, the first Canadian of African heritage to run for political office in Canada; and Lorne, a regular performer for television show Singalong Jubilee. White also became aunt to Senator Donald Oliver and political commentator Sheila White. Portia White began her musical career at the age of six as a choir member at Cornwallis Street Baptist Church, where her mother was also the musical director. As White grew older, she became the choir director and assisted with church fundraising by singing on her father's weekly radio show. In an interview later in life, White explained that her love of music and performing had developed early: > Nobody ever told me to sing, I was born singing. I think that if nobody had > ever talked to me, I wouldn't be able to communicate in any other way but by > singing. I was always bowing in my dreams and singing before people and > parading across the stage as a very little girl. As a teenager, White entered a local singing competition with her sister June, the pair performing an aria from Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor. They won first prize. Although White wanted to pursue a singing career, she could not afford professional training at the time. White entered Dalhousie University in 1929, studying to become a teacher. From the early 1930s she taught in Africville and Lucasville, two small Halifax communities that were predominately Black Nova Scotian, and during this time White was finally able to begin paying for vocal lessons. She competed regularly at the Halifax Music Festival, winning the Helen Kennedy Silver Cup in 1935, 1937 and 1938, until the festival organizers finally decided to award her the cup permanently. In 1939, White won a scholarship to continue her musical training at the Halifax Conservatory of Music with noted Italian baritone Ernesto Vinci, and Vinci taught her using the bel canto vocal style. White soon gave her first formal recital, and after the start of World War II she continued singing in concerts and radio shows. She won awards at provincial music festivals, and in mid-1941 she met Edith Read, a visiting headmistress from a Toronto school who offered to arrange new performing opportunities for White. Singing career and later life The alt=Photograph of an audience watching a performance inside the Eaton Auditorium In November 1941, with the support of Read, 30-year-old White made her national debut as a singer in Toronto at the Eaton Auditorium. She was favourably received by audiences, even receiving a career management offer from Oxford University Press the day after her performance. Despite encountering racism as she sought out new performance bookings, White subsequently toured across Canada, performing concerts at venues that included the Governor General's Rideau Hall residence. Portia White, c. 1945 White sang both classical European music and African-American spirituals, and works by Harry T. Burleigh were a constant part of her concert repertoire. Alongside English pieces, she performed music in Italian, German, French and Spanish, and White's three-octave range attracted critical acclaim. Hector Charlesworth's review in The Globe and Mail observed White's \\"pungent expression and beauty of utterance,\\" while a critic with the Toronto Evening Telegram said she had a \\"coloured and beautifully shaded contralto... It is a natural voice, a gift from heaven.\\" White was compared to noted American contralto Marian Anderson. After auditioning for Metropolitan Opera general manager Edward Johnson, White made her international debut in New York City in 1944, becoming the first Canadian to perform at New York's Town Hall performance space. The New York Times reported her performance as \\"remarkable,\\" and Paul Bowles of the New York Herald Tribune wrote that \\"White, contralto, showed the public... that she not only has a magnificent vocal instrument, but that she also has sufficient musicianship and intelligence to do what she wishes with it.\\" White went on to sing at many more concerts across the United States. The province of Nova Scotia and the city of Halifax provided new financial support for the rising star, purchasing a white fox cape for White to wear at performances. In 1945, she signed a contract with artist agency Columbia Concerts Incorporated. A three-month tour of Central and South America and the Caribbean followed in 1946, and she sang in France and Switzerland in 1948. White was the first Black Canadian concert singer to achieve international fame. Vocal problems, an exhausting itinerary, and an eventual diagnosis of breast cancer later contributed to White's early retirement from public singing in 1952, and she settled in Toronto, where she studied with sopranos Gina Cigna and Irene Jessner at the Royal Conservatory of Music. As a vocal instructor herself, White also went on to teach some of Canada's up-and-coming musical talent, and her students included singers Lorne Greene, Dinah Christie, Don Francks, Robert Goulet, Anne Marie Moss and Judith Lander. White appeared in Halifax for a few rare performances during the 50s; although she announced her intention to resume a full-time singing career, her return to the concert circuit never fully materialized. In 1964, she sang in a command performance for Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, at the opening of the Confederation Centre of the Arts in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. This was one of her last major concerts. White died in Toronto on February 13, 1968, aged 56. Legacy and honours In 1944, White's supporters in Nova Scotia formed the Nova Scotia Talent Trust to provide her with financial assistance for her singing career. The Trust went on to establish annual scholarships for other Nova Scotian artists, and continues to award the Portia White Award to artists who show \\"exceptional commitment and potential in voice.\\" The Nova Scotia provincial government also awards a Portia White Prize for \\"cultural and artistic excellence,\\" and the 1998 inaugural Portia White Prize was awarded to Nova Scotian poet George Elliott Clarke, White's great nephew. White has been declared a person of national historic significance by the Government of Canada, and she was featured in a special issue of Millennium postage stamps celebrating Canadian achievement. At the 2007 East Coast Music Awards, White was posthumously honoured with a Dr. Helen Creighton Lifetime Achievement Award. She is the namesake of Portia White Court, a Halifax street, as well as the Portia White Atrium in Citadel High School. In 2017, the Portia White Youth Award was established as part of the African Nova Scotian Music Awards. White has been the subject of Lance Woolaver's play Portia White: First You Dream (also known simply as Portia), Sylvia Hamilton's documentary Portia White: Think on Me, and George Elliott Clarke's book Portia White.

It was discovered on 20 May 1999, by Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) at the Lincoln Laboratory's Experimental Test Site in Socorro, New Mexico, United States. It is also a Mercury-crosser and the closest known binary system to the Sun with a perihelion of just 0.2 AU.  Orbit  The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.2‚Äì1.1 AU once every 6.18 months (188 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.69 and an inclination of 39¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. A first precovery was taken by 2MASS at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory in 1998, extending the body's observation arc by one year prior to its official discovery observation at Socorro. As a potentially hazardous asteroid, it has an Earth minimum orbital intersection distance of which corresponds to 5.4 lunar distances. On 25 May 2036, it will pass from Earth.  Numbering and naming  This minor planet was numbered by the Minor Planet Center on 10 September 2003. It was named from Mohegan legend, after Moshup, a giant who lived in the coastal areas of New England. The asteroid's companion is named Squannit, after the wife of Moshup and a medicine woman of the Makiawisug (little people). The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 27 August 2019 ().  Physical characteristics  In the SMASS classification, the asteroid a characterized as a stony S-type asteroid. = Satellite = Simulated animation of the Moshup binary system. The simulation speed is approx. 12,000 times real-time. Moshup has a minor-planet moon orbiting it. The moon, named Squannit and designated , is approximately 360 metres in diameter, and orbits its primary in every 16 hours at a mean-distance of 2.6 kilometers. The presence of a companion was suggested by photometric observations made by Pravec and ≈†arounov√° and was confirmed by radar observations from Arecibo observations and announced on 23 May 2001 (also see below). Based on radar imaging, Squannit's dimensions are estimated to be meters. = Diameter and shape = Goldstone Collage of radar images taken at Arecibo in May 2019 According to radiometric observations from Arecibo Observatory, the asteroid has a mean diameter of 1.317 kilometers. The observations were taken from May 21‚Äì23, 2001, by Lance A. M. Benner, Steven J. Ostro, Jon D. Giorgini, Raymond F. Jurgens, Jean-Luc Margot and Michael C. Nolan. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link adopts a diameter of 1.3 kilometers and derives an albedo 0.26 with an absolute magnitude of 16.5. The shapes of the two bodies and their dynamics are complex.NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory Asteroid Radar Research , retrieved May 3, 2007 With a dimension of approximately kilometers for a simple triaxial ellipsoid, the asteroid has an oblate shape, which is dominated by an equatorial ridge at the body's potential-energy minimum. This bizarre property of the equatorial region means that it is close to breakup: raising a particle a meter above the surface would put it into orbit. As seen in the image at above right, the gravitational effects between the moon and the asteroid create a gigantic mountain extending in the equatorial plane around the entire asteroid. It was the first asteroid to be described as \\"muffin-shaped\\",CBS News - Scientist: Asteroid To Return In 2036, which is now understood to be a very common shape for asteroids in critical rotation, including 101955 Bennu and 162173 Ryugu. = Lightcurves = During 19‚Äì27 June 2000, a rotational lightcurve of this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations by Petr Pravec and Lenka ≈†arounov√° at Ond≈ôejov Observatory.

The distinction is particularly significant in two-party systems. In any case \\"third\\" is often used figuratively, as in \\"the third parties\\", where the intent, literally stated, is \\"the third and succeeding parties\\". For instance, in the United Kingdom a third party is a national political party, other than the Conservatives and Labour, which has at least one member in the House of Commons. From 1922 to 2015, Liberal Democrats and its predecessor Liberals was the third party. Since 2015, it is used for the Scottish National Party (SNP). In Scotland, SNP has been the dominant parliamentary party beginning with the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, with the Conservative the next largest party and Labour becoming Scotland's third party ever since. In the United States of America, there have been numerous \\"third parties\\". The largest since the mid-20th century are the Libertarian and Green Parties. In Canada provinces such as Ontario, Prince Edward Island and Quebec, nearly 50+ active political parties exist throughout the nation with several them both provincial and federal levels either did elected, formed or joined during cross-flooring. The term \\"third parties\\" is used mostly in countries with first-past-the-post voting systems, as those systems tend to create a two- party system, so that successful smaller parties are rare to stronger two- party systems like the United States. Countries using proportional representation give little advantage to the largest two parties, so they tend to elect many parties. Therefore, in those countries, three, four, or more political parties are usually elected to legislatures. In such parliamentary systems, coalitions often include smaller parties; since they may participate in a coalition government, there is not a sharp distinction with a 'major' party. In two-party systems, on the other hand, only the major parties have a serious chance of forming a government. Similarly, in presidential systems, third-party candidates are rarely elected president. e In some categorizations, a party needs to have a certain level of success to be considered a third party. Smaller parties that win only a very small share of the vote and no seats in the legislature often are termed minor or fringe parties.  Structural barriers to power  Third parties face an uphill battle in terms of electoral success due to incentives placed on voters by election algorithms. Even in instances where the potential supporter may align themselves most with a certain third party, in the face of overwhelming odds against impacting the election it makes more sense to just stay home or back a coalition party in compromise. These disincentives exist primarily in the United States perpetuating two-party rule and can be alleviated through adopting electoral reform measures in the form of voting system adaptations, which, predictably, are often backed by third parties and opposed by the primary parties. In some countries like the United States, parties with low win probability also face frequent exclusion from major debates and media coverage and denial of ballot access as well as hamstrung campaign budgets.  Canada  In Canada politics are similar to United Kingdom politics but it does instead have either one or occasionally two and three national and provincial third parties since last few decades in Canadian politics like the national New Democratic Party and most its provincial chapters, the national Green Party of Canada and some its provincial chapters, Quebec's the Parti Qu√©b√©cois since 2018, New Brunswick's the People's Alliance of New Brunswick since 2018, Ontario's the Ontario Liberal Party since 2018, Alberta's the Alberta Party since 2015, Manitoba's the Manitoba Liberal Party since 2016, and the Prince Edward Island Liberal Party since 2019.  United States  In U.S. politics, a third party is a political party other than the Democrats or Republicans, such as the Libertarians and Greens. The term \\"minor party\\" is also used in a similar manner. Such third political parties rarely win elections, as proportional representation is not used in federal or state elections, but only in some municipal elections. But however since 2018, Maine as become first state for adopted Majoritarian favor ranked-choice voting system to deduced spoiler effect nor vote splitting made under First-Past-The- Post system for both federal and primary elections, but not state elections due of their state's constitution only favor plural voting systems. A similar situation occurs with the presidential Electoral College, where Electoral College votes are often given the candidate who receives a plurality of the vote, thus bringing up accusations that certain third party presidential candidates are \\"spoiling\\" the election or splitting up segments of voters.  Parliamentary two-party systems  Third parties usually have little chance of forming a government or winning the position of head of government. Nevertheless, there are many reasons for third parties to compete. The opportunity of a national election means that attention will be paid to the positions of third parties. The larger parties might be forced to respond and adapt to their challenges, and often the larger parties copy ideas from them. Most third parties try to build their support to become one of the dominant parties, as the Labour Party in Britain and New Democratic Party in Canada did. In the Westminster system there is also the possibility of minority governments, which can give smaller parties strength disproportional to their support. Examples include the Irish Parliamentary Party which pushed for Home Rule in Ireland in the late 19th century. Challenging parties also usually appeal for votes on the basis that they will try to change the voting system to make it more competitive for all parties.

The fort, Krasnovodsk, served as Imperial Russia's base of operations against Khiva and Bukhara, and the nomadic Turkmen tribes. The railway had originally begun from Uzun-Ada on the Caspian Sea, but the terminus was shifted north to the harbour at Krasnovodsk. It fell to the Red Army in February, 1920. On November 21, 1939 was formed Krasnovodsk Oblast with the administrative center in Krasnovodsk. The oblast was repeatedly liquidated and restored (January 23, 1947 liquidated; April 4, 1952 restored; December 9, 1955 liquidated; December 27, 1973 restored; August 25, 1988 eliminated). =T√ºrkmenba≈üy= Hotel Serdar in the Awaza tourist zone January 10, 1991 in the former Krasnovodsk region formed Balkan Region (May 18, 1992 - velayat) with the center in Balkanabat. In 1993, Krasnovodsk was renamed by President for Life Saparmurat Niyazov, after his self-proclaimed title T√ºrkmenba≈üy (\\"Leader of all Turkmen\\"). Second President of Turkmenistan Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow pledged, in July 2007, to invest one billion dollars into a project slated to turn T√ºrkmenba≈üy into a major tourist resort ‚Äì the center of the Awaza tourist zone with 60 modern hotels to be built along a stretch of the Caspian Sea shoreline.Avaza Tourist Zone around Turkmenbashi The T√ºrkmenba≈üy city has two modern hotels - T√ºrkmenbashi Hotel and Charlak Hotel and old soviet Hazar Hotel. In recent years, the city made large-scale reconstruction historic district, entrance roads, vital infrastructure. A new Turkish Park and the cascade of fountains. By the end of 2012 Magtymguly Avenue had been completely renovated, the new route merged with the city's waterfront Bahry Hazar, providing the west motorway junction Balyk√ßy double out of the city along the dike, paved across the Soymonov bay speed motorway Turkmenbashi Airport‚ÄîAwaza. In 2014, the Oilworkers Palace of Culture, which was built in 1951, was renovated. The city housed the State Service of Maritime and River Transport of Turkmenistan, part of the Government of Turkmenistan.  Administrative divisions  In July 2013 as part of the city of Turkmenbashi was created two etraps - Avaza Etrap and Kenar Etrap. In Avaza Etrap, an area of 9660 hectares and includes the national tourist zone Awaza, Turkmenbashi International Airport and a few small towns. In Kenar Etrap, an area of 7262 hectares, entered the main part of the city of Turkmenbashi and the territory of the village of Kenar.

He has also written several books on some of the more sordid events in the history of Bristol, his home town, as well as guides to rugby. He was nominated for the Booker Prize in 1971 for his first novel, Goshawk Squadron. After attending Cotham Grammar School, Robinson served in the Royal Air Force as a fighter plotter, during his National Service.

The defining characteristic of a close vowel is that the tongue is positioned as close as possible to the roof of the mouth as it can be without creating a constriction. A constriction would produce a sound that would be classified as a consonant. The term \\"close\\" is recommended by the International Phonetic Association. Close vowels are often referred to as \\"high\\" vowels, as in the Americanist phonetic tradition, because the tongue is positioned high in the mouth during articulation. In the context of the phonology of any particular language, a high vowel can be any vowel that is more close than a mid vowel. That is, close-mid vowels, near-close vowels, and close vowels can all be considered high vowels.

A near-close vowel or a near-high vowel is any in a class of vowel sound used in some spoken languages. The defining characteristic of a near-close vowel is that the tongue is positioned similarly to a close vowel, but slightly less constricted. Other names for a near-close vowel are lowered close vowel and raised close-mid vowel, though the former phrase may also be used to describe a vowel that is as low as close-mid (sometimes even lower); likewise, the latter phrase may also be used to describe a vowel that is as high as close. Near-close vowels are also sometimes described as lax variants of the fully close vowels, though, depending on the language, they may not necessarily be variants of close vowels at all. It is rare for languages to contrast a near- close vowel with a close vowel and a close-mid vowel based on height alone. An example of such language is Danish, which contrasts short and long versions of the close front unrounded , near-close front unrounded and close-mid front unrounded vowels, though in order to avoid using any relative articulation diacritics, Danish and are typically transcribed with phonetically inaccurate symbols and , respectively. This contrast is not present in Conservative Danish, which realizes the latter two vowels as, respectively, close-mid and mid . It is even rarer for languages to contrast more than one close/near- close/close-mid triplet. For instance, Sotho has two such triplets: fully front and fully back . In the case of this language, the near-close vowels tend to be transcribed with the phonetically inaccurate symbols , i.e. as if they were close central. It may be somewhat more common for languages to contain allophonic vowel triplets that are not contrastive; for instance, Russian has one such triplet: * close central rounded , an allophone of between soft consonants in stressed syllables; * near-close central rounded , an allophone of between soft consonants in unstressed syllables; * close-mid central rounded , an allophone of after soft consonants.

The IPA divides the vowel space into thirds, with the close-mid vowels such as or and the open-mid vowels such as or equidistant in formant space between open or and close or . Thus a true mid front unrounded vowel can be transcribed as either a lowered (with a lowering diacritic) or as a raised (with a raising diacritic).

The \\"university\\" is not an educational institution: it is, in fact, a licensing and accreditation body that sets standards for schools operating in New York State, from pre-kindergarten through professional and graduate school, as well as for the practice of a wide variety of professions. The group of people who make decisions about and for USNY is known as the New York State Board of Regents.  History  The Board of Regents of the USNY was established by statute on May 1, 1784, to re-establish and oversee King's College as Columbia University - and any other colleges and academies incorporated in the state thereafter. On April 13, 1787, the legislature enacted a law that allowed individual educational institutions to have their own trustees (making Columbia a private institution) and gave the Regents broader responsibilities for overseeing education in New York. The new law empowered the Regents to \\"visit and inspect all the colleges, academies, and schools\\" in the state, award higher academic degrees, hold and distribute funds, and exercise other powers of a corporation. Early in the 19th century, the Regents established standards for incorporating private academies and colleges, including specifying the texts or subjects that academies must teach to qualify for state aid. Aid was restricted to those students who had passed local entrance examinations. To combat the problem of academies lowering their standards in order to attract students and get state aid, during the later nineteenth century the Regents developed and instituted educational standards for high schools statewide, through use of the Regents examinations and syllabi. The legislature gave the Regents responsibility for the New York State Library and New York State Museum in 1844 and 1845, respectively, and in 1889 and 1892 expanded the USNY's responsibilities significantly to include the incorporation and supervision of all libraries, museums, correspondence schools, and other educational institutions. An 1872 statute authorized the Regents to appoint examining and licensing boards in the state's medical schools, and in 1890 the Regents were given the exclusive power to license physicians. Also starting in 1890, the Secretary to the Board of Regents - then Melvil Dewey, also head of the State Library - supervised full-time inspectors of secondary schools, libraries, colleges, and other institutions reporting to the Regents. Starting in 1910, private trade schools were required to be licensed and inspected, and in 1923 licensing requirements were extended to correspondence schools operating in the state. In 1948, New York State established a system of support organizations known as Boards of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) across the state. The head of each BOCES, known as the District Superintendent, acts as the New York State Commissioner of Education's, and by extension, the Chancellor of the Board of Regents', field representative. =Regents College= A key former initiative of the Board of Regents, created to better bring higher education to New York State's nontraditional adult learners, was the Board of Regents' Regents External Degree Program, or REX, which became Regents College in 1984 and then the separate and independent Excelsior College in 1998-2001\\\\. This program was an outgrowth of the practice of giving World War II veterans school and college credit in recognition of their military education and experience. In 1963 the Regents introduced College Proficiency Examinations, now called Excelsior College Examinations (ECEs), initially to help teachers and nurses complete educational requirements. First named the \\"Regents External Degree Program,\\" it was established in 1971 with financial support from the Ford and Carnegie Foundations. Degrees could be granted based on a combination of college proficiency exams and classroom and correspondence courses, or on a variety of exams alone. The first degrees were conferred in 1972. This program became independent of the Education Department in 1991 but continued to be governed by the Board of Regents until 1998, at which time it fully separated from the Board of Regents to become a private, independent college. This was a scam thought up to protect the elite status of the university of the state of new york. Acdemic elites jealously guard their elite status because without it they couldn't even get a job flipping burgers at Mickey D. The school, prohibited by the terms of its \\"independence\\" agreement from continuing to use the name Regents College, adopted the name Excelsior College in 2001. Excelsior College is now a constituent member of USNY in the same way, and in only the same way, that other institutions of higher education (including private colleges) in New York State are. Like them, it has its own charter and Board of Trustees.  Current structure and functions  The Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York oversees USNY. The Board includes 17 members elected by the New York State Legislature for five-year terms. Thirteen of the Regents represent the state's 13 judicial districts (one appointed from each district), and four are at-large. The Regents serve without salary. USNY's affiliation and oversight are very broad. As a legal technicality, USNY includes all of the state's more than 7,000 public and private elementary and secondary schools; approximately 250 public and private colleges and universities; another approximately 250 proprietary (for-profit) schools; nearly 7,000 libraries; about 750 museums; all of the state's local historical societies; and 25 public broadcasting facilities. Also included in USNY are the State Archives; a special school for the blind and another special school for the deaf; as well as vocational rehabilitation and special education services. Additionally, USNY has the affiliation of, and oversight for, more than half a million professionals practicing in 58 licensed professions, ranging from accountancy to architecture to engineering to massage therapy to hair styling, as well as 200,000 public certified school teachers, counselors, and administrators. Certain education-related institutions (such as most museums) could exist in New York State without being part of USNY; however, as an example, most museums in New York State choose to be part of USNY (i.e., be chartered by the Board of Regents) in order to obtain tax-exempt nonprofit status and other benefits.About the University of the State of New York = Relationship to the state education department = The state Education Law makes the Regents the head of the New York State Education Department. The Regents select a Commissioner of Education who both runs the Education Department and is president - that is, chief executive officer - of the University. The Board of Regents also elects a chancellor from among its members, who presides over the Regents' meetings and appoints its committees. The New York State Education Department (NYSED) was created at the behest of former New York Governor Theodore Roosevelt in 1904. USNY has, as a subordinate unit, NYSED, including NYSED's various administrative personnel ‚Äî furthermore, the various schools, colleges, libraries, museums, teachers, etc., of USNY form constituent units of USNY, whereas NYSED forms a constituent and subordinate component of USNY. USNY, through its Board of Regents, generally uses NYSED as a vehicle to carry out policy created by the Regents. In other words, USNY's Board of Regents generally creates policy, whereas NYSED generally administers policy and the BOCES' District Superintendents help facilitate the roll-out of that policy in the field. The New York State Legislature can also create some education policy; such statutory education policy would become official education policy that the Commissioner of Education would also be responsible for administering. = Regents examinations and diplomas = Regents Examinations, tests administered to high school students to demonstrate mastery of various subjects, were established by the Regents and first administered in 1865. The Regents of USNY have set standards by which students may earn various levels of Regents diplomas for high school performance. = Honorary degrees = USNY can also issue honorary degrees; the honorary degrees that can be issued come from an established list contained in Rules of the Board of Regents (\\"Regents Rules\\"). USNY also has the power to directly issue (as opposed to through some other institution) diplomas, certificates, and degrees. Today, for a variety of reasons, USNY directly issues diplomas to individuals meeting graduation requirements at several postsecondary institutions in New York State.  State University of New York  Not to be confused with USNY is the State University of New York (SUNY), which is one of New York State's systems of public higher education, the other being the City University of New York (CUNY). Like all colleges and universities in the state, the 64 SUNY and 23 CUNY campus units are all part of USNY. However, the power of SUNY and CUNY units to grant degrees exists by mandate of the State Legislature; a private college or university in New York State would be allowed to grant degrees by virtue of a charter granted by the USNY Board of Regents. No institution in New York State can call itself, per New York State law, a \\"college\\" or \\"university\\", nor award academic degrees, without being chartered by NYSED and being a USNY member. Institutions in the state can, however, offer non-degree certificate programs without adhering to these requirements.

There are sixteen people in the line of succession to the Belgian throne. The monarch is considered to have acceded to the throne upon her/his taking of the oath as required by article 91 of the constitution.  Eligibility  Since 1991, Belgium practises absolute primogeniture among the descendants of King Albert II (then Prince of Li√®ge). Descendants of earlier monarchs and princes are only eligible to succeed if male and descended from King Leopold I in male-line (i.e. according to agnatic primogeniture), meaning that descendants of all Belgian princesses not descended from Albert II are barred from the throne. There are no living princes of Belgium who are not descended from Albert II, so agnatic primogeniture de facto doesn't apply to anyone anymore and the right to succeed is effectively limited to Albert II's descendants. A person is deprived of his or her rights to the crown if he or she marries without the consent of the monarch (or the consent of those exercising the monarch's powers). The lost right may be re-established by the monarch (or by those exercising the monarch's powers) in the event of parliamentary agreement.Belgian Constitution, coordinated 1994, 2005 version, art. 85 Should there be no eligible descendant of King Leopold I, the reigning monarch may name his or her heir presumptive with the approval of the Parliament, but if she or he doesn't name the heir presumptive, the throne would eventually become vacant.Belgian Constitution, coordinated 1994, 2005 version, art. 86 In the case of a vacancy, Parliament would appoint a Regent (see below), then elections would happen within two months, and the next Houses of Parliament would jointly appoint the next monarch.Belgian Constitution, coordinated 1994, 2005 version, art. 95 When King Albert II's daughter Astrid married Archduke Lorenz of Austria-Este in 1984, agnatic primogeniture being in effect, she had no succession rights and therefore did not seek the consent to her marriage. Following the introduction of absolute primogeniture among her father's descendants in 1991, it was deemed that she had obtained the necessary consent and thus assumed her place in the line along with her children.Belgian Constitution, coordinated 1994, 2005 version, title IX, section I When Prince Amedeo married in 2014, it was reported that he did not ask his uncle King Philippe's permission,http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/947/Royalty/article/detail/2406328/2015/07/28/Prins- Amedeo-niet-meer-troongerechtigd.dhtml and had therefore lost his right to the Belgian throne. However, on November 12, 2015, a Royal Decree was published which showed that consent had been given after the marriage retroactively. No head of a different state may become King (or Queen) of the Belgians, unless both Houses of Parliament separately agree to it, two-thirds of the Members being present in each House, and a two-thirds majority being required in each House.Belgian Constitution, coordinated 1994, 2005 version, art. 87  Accession  Upon the King'sSo far.

There can only be one Regent. Belgian Constitution, coordinated 1994, 2005 version, art. 92-94 In other words, unlike in the Commonwealth, in Belgium there is an interregnum between each monarch's demise (usually by death, twice so far by abdication: Leopold III and Albert II) and his successor's accession (by taking the constitutional oath of office).

Castration anxiety is an overwhelming fear of damage to, or loss of, the penis‚Äîone of Sigmund Freud's earliest psychoanalytic theories.Schwartz, Bernard J. (1955) The measurement of castration anxiety and anxiety over loss of love. Journal of Personality, 24 204-219. Although Freud regarded castration anxiety as a universal human experience, few empirical studies have been conducted on the topic. The theory is that a child has a fear of damage being done to their genitalia by the parent of the same sex (e.g. a son being afraid of his father) as punishment for sexual feelings toward the parent of the opposite sex (e.g. a son toward his mother).Farlex Partner Medical Dictionary 2012 It has been theorized that castration anxiety begins between the ages of 3 and 5, otherwise known as the phallic stage of development according to Freud.Feiner, K. (1988) A test of a theory about body integrity: Part 2. Psychoanalytic Psychology. 5(1), 71‚Äì79. Although typically associated with males, castration anxiety is theorized to be experienced in differing ways for both the male and female sexes. Literal Castration anxiety is the conscious or unconscious fear of losing all or part of the sex organs, or the function of such. In the literal sense, castration anxiety refers to the fear of having one's genitalia disfigured or removed to punish sexual desires of a child. In Freudian psychoanalysis, castration anxiety (Kastrationsangst) refers to an unconscious fear of penile loss originating during the phallic stage of psychosexual development and lasting a lifetime. According to Freud, when the infantile male becomes aware of differences between male and female genitalia he assumes that the female's penis has been removed and becomes anxious that his penis will be cut off by his rival, the father figure, as punishment for desiring the mother figure.Freud, S. (1954). The Origins Of Psycho-Analysis: Letters To Wilhelm Fliess, Drafts And Notes: 1887-1902. Edited by Marie Bonaparte, Anna Freud, Ernst Kris. Translated by Eric Mosbacher and James Strachey. New York: Basic Books. In 19th-century Europe, it was not unheard of for parents to threaten their misbehaving sons with castration or otherwise threaten their genitals. This theme is explored in the story Tupik by French writer Michel Tournier in his collection of stories entitled Le Coq de Bruy√®re (1978) and is a phenomenon Freud documents several times.Freud, Sigmund. \\"The Dissolution of the Oedipus Complex.\\" On Sexuality. Vol. 7 of Penguin Freud Library. Trans. James Strachey. Ed. Angela Richards. Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1976. 313-322. In this same period, Dr. Kellogg and others in America and English-speaking countries offered to Victorian parents circumcision and in grave instances, castration of their boys and girls as a terminal cure and punishment for a wide variety of perceived misbehaviours (such as masturbation), becoming very popular over time. Metaphorical Castration anxiety can also refer to being castrated symbolically. In the metaphorical sense, castration anxiety refers to the idea of feeling or being insignificant; there is a need to keep one's self from being dominated; whether it be socially or in a relationship.Sarnoff, I., & Corwin S.M., (1959) Castration anxiety and the fear of death. Journal of Personality, 27(3), 374. Symbolic castration anxiety refers to the fear of being degraded, dominated or made insignificant, usually an irrational fear where the person will go to extreme lengths to save their pride and/or perceives trivial things as being degrading making their anxiety restrictive and sometimes damaging. This can also tie in with literal castration anxiety in fearing the loss of virility or sexual dominance. Relation to power and control According to Freudian psychoanalysis, castration anxiety can be completely overwhelming to the individual, and can often breach other aspects of their lives. A link has been found between castration anxiety and fear of death. Although differing degrees of anxiety are common, young men who felt the most threatened in their youth tended to show chronic anxiety. Because the consequences are extreme, the fear can evolve from potential disfigurement to life-threatening situations. Essentially, castration anxiety can lead to a fear of death, and a feeling of loss of control over one's life. To feel so powerless can be detrimental to an individual's mental health. One of the most concerning problems with all of this is the idea that the individual does not recognize that their sexual desires are the cause of the emotional distress. Because of unconscious thoughts, as theorized in the ideas of psychoanalysis, the anxiety is brought to the surface where it is experienced symbolically. This will lead to the fear associated with bodily injury in castration anxiety, which can then lead to the fear of dying or being killed. Counterpart in females It is implied in Freudian psychology that both girls and boys pass through the same developmental stages: oral, anal, and phallic stages. Freud, however, believed that the results may be different because the anatomy of the different sexes is different. The counterpart of castration anxiety for females is penis envy. Penis envy, and the concept of such, was first introduced by Freud in an article published in 1908 titled \\"On the Sexual Theories of Children\\". The idea was presumed that females/girls envied those (mostly their fathers) with a penis because theirs was taken from them‚Äîessentially they were already \\"castrated\\". Freud entertained that the envy they experienced was their unconscious wish to be like a boy and to have a penis.Fancher, Raymond E. & Rutherford, Alexandra Pioneers of Psychology, W.W. Norton & Company, Inc. New York, London. 2012 Penis envy, in Freudian psychology, refers to the reaction of the female/young girl during development when she realizes that she does not possess a penis. According to Freud, this was a major development in the identity (gender and sexual) of the girl. The contemporary culture assumes that penis envy is the woman wishing they were in fact a man. This is unrelated to the notion of \\"small penis syndrome\\" which is the assumption by the man that his penis is too small. According to Freud's beliefs, girls developed a weaker superego, which he considered a consequence of penis envy. Among his many suggestions, Freud believed that during the phallic stage, young girls distance themselves from their mothers and instead envy their fathers and show this envy by showing love and affection towards their fathers. According to Cohler and Galatzer, Freud believed that all of the concepts related to penis envy were among his greatest accomplishments. However, these are also his most criticized theories as well‚Äîmost famously by Karen Horney. Empirical testing Sarnoff et al. surmised that men differ in their degree of castration anxiety through the castration threat they experienced in childhood. Therefore, these men may be expected to respond in different ways to different degrees of castration anxiety that they experience from the same sexually arousing stimulus. The experimenters aimed to demonstrate that in the absence of a particular stimulus, men who were severely threatened with castration, as children, might experience long- lasting anxiety. The researchers claimed that this anxiety is from the repressed desires for sexual contact with women. It was thought that these desires are trying to reach the men's consciousness. The experimenters deduced that unconscious anxiety of being castrated might come from the fear the consciousness has of bodily injury. The researchers concluded that individuals who are in excellent health and who have never experienced any serious accident or illness may be obsessed by gruesome and relentless fears of dying or of being killed. In another article related to castration anxiety, Hall et al. investigated whether sex differences would be found in the manifestations of castration anxiety in their subject's dreams.Hall, C., & van de Castle, R. L. \\"An empirical investigation of the castration complex in dreams\\", Journal of Personality, 1965, 33(1), 20. The researchers hypothesized that male dreamers would report more dreams that would express their fear of castration anxiety instead of dreams involving castration wish and penis envy. They further hypothesized that women will have a reversed affect, that is, female dreamers will report more dreams containing fear of castration wish and penis envy than dreams including castration anxiety. The results demonstrated that many more women than men dreamt about babies and weddings and that men had more dreams about castration anxiety than women.

It is usually a subset of the full executive cabinet of ministers. It is also quite common for a war cabinet to have senior military officers and opposition politicians as members. The War Cabinet is an English idea. When authority over the appointment of a Prime Minister shifted from the King to The House of Commons in 1782, coupled with the Reform Act of 1832, England entered the age of democracy.Britannica online, English democracy Consequently, the number of cabinet agencies began to grow. Due to dissatisfaction with the Crimean War in 1855, Prime Minister Disraeli proposed that the number of cabinet agencies never exceed 10 (he had 12 at the time). However, this didn't happen, and the number of agencies continued to grow: 15 in 1859, 21 in 1914, and 23 in 1916.Schuyler, The British War Cabinet, pg. 380 Despite talk of, \\"inner circles\\" within the Asquith Administration, all committees reported to the 23 cabinet heads, whose priorities were all civil and diverse in nature, and who had final say over war policy formation for the first two years of World War I. This cumbersome arrangement could not stand; a more efficient way of prosecuting the war was needed.  United Kingdom  = First World War = The 1916 War Cabinet The British War Cabinet During the First World War, lengthy cabinet discussions came to be seen as a source of vacillation in Britain's war effort. In December 1916 it was proposed that the Prime Minister H. H. Asquith should delegate decision-making to a small, three-man committee chaired by the Secretary of State for War, David Lloyd George. Asquith initially agreed (provided he retained the right to chair the committee if he chose) before changing his mind after being infuriated by a news story in The Times which portrayed the proposed change as a defeat for him. The political crisis grew from this point until Asquith was forced to resign as Prime Minister; he was succeeded by David Lloyd George who thereupon formed a small war cabinet. The original members of the war cabinet were:LeMay, British Government, pg. 233 *David Lloyd George *Lord Curzon of Kedleston (Lord President of the Council) *Bonar Law (Chancellor of the Exchequer) *Arthur Henderson (December 1916 ‚Äì August 1917) *Lord Milner (December 1916 ‚Äì April 1918) Lloyd George, Curzon and Bonar Law served throughout the life of the war cabinet. Later members included: *Jan Smuts (June 1917 ‚Äì January 1919) *George Barnes (May 1917 ‚Äì January 1919) *Edward Carson (July 1917 ‚Äì January 1918) *Austen Chamberlain (April 1918 ‚Äì October 1919) *Sir Eric Geddes (January 1919 ‚Äì October 1919) Unlike a normal peacetime cabinet, few of these men had departmental responsibilities ‚Äì Bonar Law, and then Chamberlain, served as chancellors of the exchequer, but the rest had no specific portfolio. The title of, \\"Minister Without Portfolio\\" was important. It allowed total devotion to war duties, without the distraction of civil cabinet responsibilities. Among others, the Foreign Secretary, Arthur Balfour, was never a member of the war cabinet, nor were the service ministers Lord Derby (Army) and Sir Edward Carson (Navy). The latter did join, but only after leaving the Admiralty. Whenever these specialties were needed, they were summoned. The legality of the war cabinet was brought into question in 1917. Previously, all cabinet members were paid based upon their cabinet status. With the creation of Ministers Without Portfolio, it was suggested that these positions go unpaid. Indeed, Lord Lansdowne, while a member without portfolio in Prime Minister Asquith's government, received no pay. The debate, which took place in the House of Commons on 13 February 1917, was decided in the new government's favor.Schuyler, Political Science Quarterly, pg. 384 Appropriations of ¬£5,000 a year (¬£350,000 in 2020) were made.CPI index The British War Cabinet marked the first time minutes were recorded of official meetings.UK Gov. blog, 9 December 1916 This innovation set the trend for all important corporate and governmental meetings since.UK National Archives, World War I war cabinet minutes The Imperial War Cabinet Imperial War Cabinet, 22 Mar 1917 Imperial War Cabinet, June 1918 From the spring (in the northern hemisphere) of 1917, the Imperial War Cabinet was formed. It's goal was to strengthen imperial federation by upgrading the status of the Dominions and India to an equal footing with that of England when coordinating war strategy. The Imperial War Cabinet met three times: from March to May of 1917, from June to August of 1918, and from October to December of 1918. Its original members included: * Arthur Henderson (British War Cabinet) * Lord Alfred Milner (British War Cabinet) * George Curzon (British War Cabinet) * Bonar Law (British War Cabinet & future Prime Minister) * Lloyd George (British War Cabinet & Prime Minister of Great Britain) * Robert Borden (Prime Minister of Canada) * W.F. Massey (Prime Minister of New Zealand) * Jan Smuts (Minister for Defence, South Africa) * S.P. Sinha (Representative of Bengal) * Maharajah of Bikanir (King of (Northern) India) * James Meston (Assistant to the Secretary of State for India, Great Britain) * Austen Chamberlain (Secretary of State for India, Great Britain) * Robert Cecil (Minister of Blockade, Great Britain) * Walter Long (Secretary of State for the Colonies, Great Britain) * Joseph Ward (Finance Minister of New Zealand) * George Perley (Overseas War Minister of Canada) * Robert Rogers (Minister of Public Works, Canada) * J.D. Hazen (Minister of the Navy, Canada) * Leopold Amery (Assistant Secretary from Great Britain) * Admiral Jellicoe (Admiral of the Navy, Great Britain) * Edward Carson (First Lord of the Admiralty (civilian head of the Navy), Great Britain) * Lord Derby (Secretary of State for War, Great Britain) * General Maurice (Director of Military Operations, Great Britain) * Maurice Hankey (Assistant Secretary from Great Britain) * Henry Lambert (Colonial Office, from Great Britain) * Major Storr (Assistant Secretary from Great Britain) To strengthen ties between countries, the writing of an Imperial Constitution was a significant priority in 1917. However, the delegates postponed the matter for another time, and they failed to take it up later. Minutes to the Imperial War Cabinet meetings are held at the National Archives (Kew), and are available online. =Second World War= Germany invaded Poland early on 1 September 1939, and after to-ing and fro-ing with French Foreign Minister Georges Bonnet, an ultimatum was presented to the Germans and on its expiry war was declared at 11am on 3 September 1939.  Chamberlain war ministry  On 3 September 1939, Neville Chamberlain announced his War Cabinet. *Prime Minister: Neville Chamberlain (Cons) *Lord Privy Seal: Sir Samuel Hoare (Cons) *Chancellor of the Exchequer: Sir John Simon (Nat. Liberal) *Foreign Secretary: Viscount Halifax (Cons) *Secretary of State for War: Leslie Hore-Belisha (Nat. Liberal) *Secretary of State for Air: Sir Kingsley Wood (Cons) *First Lord of the Admiralty: Winston Churchill (Cons) *Minister for the Coordination of Defence: Lord Chatfield (Nat.) *Minister without Portfolio: Lord Hankey (Nat. ) Dominated largely by Conservative ministers who served under Chamberlain's National Government between 1937 and 1939, the additions of Lord Hankey (a former Cabinet Secretary from the First World War) and Winston Churchill (strong anti-appeaser) seemed to give the Cabinet more balance. Unlike Lloyd George's War Cabinet, the members of this one were also heads of Government Departments. In January 1940, after disagreements with the Chiefs of Staff, Hore-Belisha resigned from the National Government, refusing a move to the post of President of the Board of Trade. He was succeeded by Oliver Stanley. It was originally the practice for the Chiefs of Staff to attend all military discussions of the Chamberlain War Cabinet. Churchill became uneasy with this, as he felt that when they attended they did not confine their comments to purely military issues. To overcome this, a Military Co-ordination Committee was set up, consisting of the three Service ministers normally chaired by Lord Chatfield. This together with the Service chiefs would co-ordinate the strategic ideas of 'top hats' and 'brass' and agree strategic proposals to put forward to the War Cabinet. Unfortunately, except when chaired by the Prime Minister, the Military Co- ordinating Committee lacked sufficient authority to override a Minister \\"fighting his corner\\". When Churchill took over from Chatfield, whilst continuing to represent the Admiralty, this introduced additional problems, and did little to improve the pre-existing ones. Chamberlain announced a further change in arrangements in the Norway debate, but this (and the Military Co-ordination Committee) was overtaken by events, the Churchill War Cabinet being run on rather different principles.Martin Gilbert, Finest Hour, Winston S Churchill 1939‚Äì1941, Book Club Associates, London 1983 page 40  Churchill war ministry  When he became Prime Minister during the Second World War, Winston Churchill formed a war cabinet, initially consisting of the following members: * Prime Minister & Minister of Defence: Winston Churchill (Conservative) * Lord President of the Council: Neville Chamberlain (Conservative) * Lord Privy Seal: Clement Attlee (Labour) * Foreign Secretary: Lord Halifax (Conservative) * Minister without Portfolio: Arthur Greenwood (Labour) Churchill strongly believed that the War Cabinet should be kept to a relatively small number of individuals to allow efficient execution of the war effort. Even so, there were a number of ministers who, though they were not members of the war cabinet, were \\"Constant Attenders\\".Winston Churchill, The Hinge of Fate, p.78. Boston, Houghton Mifflin 1950. As the War Cabinet considered issues that pertained to a given branch of the service or government due input was obtained from the respective body. The War Cabinet would undergo a number of changes in composition over the next five years. On 19 February 1942 a reconstructed War Cabinet was announced by Churchill consisting of the following members:Winston Churchill,The Hinge of Fate, p.76. Boston, Houghton Mifflin Company 1950. *Prime Minister and Minister of Defence Winston Churchill (Conservative) *Deputy Prime Minister and Secretary of State for Dominions Affairs: Clement Attlee (Labour) *Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Commons: Sir Stafford Cripps (Labour) *Lord President of the Council: John Anderson (National) *Foreign Secretary: Anthony Eden (Conservative) *Minister of Production: Oliver Lyttelton (Conservative) *Minister of Labour: Ernest Bevin (Labour) This War Cabinet was consistent with Churchill's view that members should also hold \\"responsible offices and not mere advisors at large with nothing to do but think and talk and take decisions by compromise or majority\\"Winston Churchill, The Hinge of Fate, p.75. Boston, Houghton Mifflin Company 1950.

Left to right: John Curtin, Sir Frederick Sheddon, Ben Chifley, 'Doc' Evatt, Norm Makin, Arthur Drakeford At the Imperial Conference in London in 1937, the Australian government had agreed to form a War Cabinet on the outbreak of war. The Full Cabinet approved the formation of the War Cabinet on 26 September 1939. As neither Earle Page's Country Party nor John Curtin's Australian Labor Party would join in a coalition government with Menzies' United Australia Party, the War Cabinet initially consisted of: * Robert Menzies (Prime Minister and Treasurer) * Richard Casey (Minister for Supply) * Geoffrey Street (Minister for Defence) * George McLeay (Minister for Commerce) * Henry Gullett (Minister for Information) * William Hughes (Attorney-General) In November 1939, the Department of Defence was split up. Street became Minister for the Army, Menzies also became Minister for Defence Coordination, and three more ministers joined the War Cabinet: * James Fairbairn (Minister for Air) * Frederick Stewart (Minister for the Navy) * Harry Foll (Minister for Interior) Following the deaths of Fairbairn, Stewart and Gullett in the Canberra air disaster, 1940 and the loss of seats in the 1940 Australian federal election the War Cabinet of October 1940 consisted of: * Robert Menzies (Prime Minister and Minister for Defence Coordination) * Arthur Fadden (Treasurer) * John McEwen (Minister for Air) * Percy Spender (Minister for the Army) * Billy Hughes (Attorney-General and Minister for the Navy) * Harry Foll (Minister for Interior) * Philip McBride (Minister for Munitions) (from 26 June 1941) The government was replaced by a Labor one on 3 October 1941. A new War Cabinet was formed, consisting of: * John Curtin (Prime Minister and Minister for Defence Coordination) * Frank Forde (Minister for the Army) * Ben Chifley (Treasurer) * H. V. Evatt (Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs) * Jack Beasley (Minister for Supply) * Norman Makin (Minister for the Navy and Minister for Munitions) * Arthur Drakeford (Minister for Air) * John Dedman (Minister for the Interior) (from 11 December 1941) Frederick Shedden, the Permanent Secretary of the Department of Defence, served as secretary of the War Cabinet, which met regularly throughout the war. It held its last meeting in Canberra on 19 January 1946. While the Australian war cabinets included only members of the governing party, the Advisory War Council which was established in October 1940 included members of the opposition as well. This body did not have executive powers, but from the formation of the Labor Government in October 1941 it was agreed that its decisions would be treated as War Cabinet decisions, with only some issues being formally referred to the War Cabinet for separate decision. As a result, the Advisory War Council had significant influence on Australia's war effort. United States In response to the September 11 attacks, President George W. Bush created a War Cabinet. They met at Camp David on the weekend of 15 September to shape what became the War on Terrorism. The membership was mostly, but not entirely, identical to that of the United States National Security Council. The Cabinet comprised: *President ‚Äì George W.

Dicion√°rio Liter√°rio Brasileiro. Rio de Janeiro: LTC, 1978. Career overview Carpeaux was born Otto Karpfen in 1900 in Vienna, Austria- Hungary, to a Jewish family, and lived there until 1939. At the age of 20, he enrolled at the University of Vienna to study Law. In 1925, he received a PhD in letters and philosophy and began working as a journalist. Later, he also studied exact sciences and mathematics in Leipzig, sociology and philosophy in Paris, comparative literature in Naples, and politics in Berlin. At some point in his life, Karpfen converted to Roman Catholicism, adding Maria to his name and using Fidelis as his surname for some time. This conversion was evident in his political books (such as Wege Nach Rom) and his thinking, and led to his participation in the right-wing government of Engelbert Dollfuss.Carvalho, Olavo de. \\"Introdu√ß√£o,\\" Ensaios Reunidos, 1942-1978, (Vol.1). Rio de Janeiro: UniverCidade Editora, 2005. When the Anschluss occurred and the Nazis took over Vienna, Carpeaux fled to Belgium.Kestler, Izabela Maria Furtado. Ex√≠lio e Literatura: Escritores de Fala Alem√£ durante a √âpoca do Nazismo, EdUSP, 2003. He stayed there for about a year and, at the break of the Second World War, he went to Brazil.Miguel, Salim. \\"Carpeaux Revisitado,\\" Di√°rio Catarinense, 20 de Maio de 2006. Carpeaux did not speak Portuguese at first, and he mastered the language on his own, eventually also frenchifying his lastname to \\"Carpeaux\\", considering that it would seem more prestigious among Brazilian intellectuals. At first, he was given a simple rural job, but he gradually established himself as a literary critic. His first published article was on Franz Kafka, on the newspaper Correio da Manh√£, something he did out of desperation when living under severe conditions. He was to introduce writers such as Robert Musil and Kafka to Brazilian audiences, along with the literary criticism of Wilhelm Dilthey, Benedetto Croce, Walter Benjamin and others. His first book in Portuguese came in 1942, A Cinza do Purgat√≥rio. Two years later, he became director of Funda√ß√£o Get√∫lio Vargas library. He also published essays on philosophers and sociologists such as Friedrich Engels and Max Weber, as well as on Brazilian writers he came to discover when in the country, writing on Carlos Drummond de Andrade e Graciliano Ramos. Perhaps the peak of Carpeaux's production was his eight-volume Hist√≥ria da Literatura Ocidental (History of Western Literature),Muggiati, Roberto. \\"Carpe Carpeaux!,\\" Gazeta do Povo, Janeiro de 2012. available only in Portuguese, in spite of being in public domain. Carpeaux took eight years to write his masterwork, from 1941 to 1947. Late critic Jos√© Lino Gr√ºnewald labelled it one of the brightest moments of the language in prose, despite the fact that Carpeaux was not a native speaker. It is also unique in that it focuses on creating links between all periods, in order to create an organic vision of the literary history he is telling. The book also include more than 8,000 brief criticisms and expositions of the majority of the figures discussed along the way, minus the ones cited in passing; all are dealt with in their original languages, both in expositions and quotations and in the bibliography offered. The total bibliographical amount of cited works is on the merge of 30,000 books or more. In this series, Carpeaux begins with an analysis of classical Greek and Latin literatures and proceeds until the twentieth century avant-garde movements such as surrealism and dadaism, encompassing every major literary establishments in between. For this reason, it has been called \\"definitive, encyclopaedic and multidisciplinary, a fundamental work in Brazilian literary and cultural bibliography\\". To Antonio Candido, Carpeaux's \\"universal vision allows him to surmount the eventual limitations of critic nacionalism, whose historic function is important in certain moments, but which must not serve to obliterate the true dimension of the literary phenomena, which, through its own nature, is transcendental as well as national. Carpeaux demonstrates in other moments how Brazilian literature benefits from being seen in a double perspective, such as his, capable of increasing insight and break routine.\\" Never abandoning his abomination to militarism and tyranny, Carpeaux opposed to the Brazilian Military Regime and abandoned his literary writings by 1968, in order to participate more actively on political debate. However, he did participate in the composition of an encyclopedia called Mirador. He maintained his convictions as a right-wing thinker, and died of a heart attack in 1978. Recently, his essays have been compiled by Brazilian journalist Olavo de Carvalho,Guimar√£es, J. C. \\"O Destino de Otto Maria Carpeaux,\\" Revista Bula, Dezembro de 2008. with an added introduction. Critic Mauro Souza Ventura released De Karpfen a Carpeaux, a study in the life and work of Carpeaux. Carpeaux's other works include a dense history of German literature, several books of literary criticism, a popular history of Western music and various political writings. Works * (1942).

Davis also spent multiple seasons as a third baseman and center fielder, and lesser amounts of time at other positions. He broke into the major leagues in 1890 and played through 1909. He is ranked among the top 100 players of all-time in several statistical categories. Davis was a switch hitter. After his playing career, Davis managed the Amherst College baseball team for several years. He died in a mental institution, suffering the effects of syphilis. Not much was known about Davis's life or career until the 1990s, when he gained some recognition from the city historian of his hometown of Cohoes, New York. He was elected to the Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1998. Early life Born on August 23, 1870 in Cohoes, New York, Davis was one of seven children born to Abram and Sarah Davis. His father had immigrated from Wales and his mother came from England. Davis was playing amateur baseball in Albany when he was 16 years old and he could bat from both sides of the plate. By 1889, Davis was on a team of semiprofessional and amateur players near the Hudson River in Albany. The squad was managed by Tom York, a former major league player. York recommended Davis for major league service with the Cleveland Spiders. The team signed Davis for the 1890 season. Early playing career Davis patrolled center field for the first two seasons of his career, leading the National League (NL) in outfield assists with 35 in 1890. He made three brief appearances as a pitcher in 1891, giving up seven earned runs in four innings and recording one save. That year he was among the league's top ten players in hits, doubles, triples, total bases, runs batted in (RBI), plate appearances and assists as an outfielder. Davis never appeared as a pitcher again, but his strong arm did lead the team to move him to third base in 1892, a position he played for the next five seasons. His batting average dropped almost 50 points to .241 in 1892, but he recorded 82 RBI and 36 stolen bases. New York Giants The Spiders traded Davis to the New York Giants for aging star Buck Ewing shortly before the 1893 season, and Davis blossomed in New York City. With league rules moving the pitcher's mound back to 60 feet, 6 inches that season, offensive totals jumped across the league, and Davis was at the forefront of the surge. He compiled a .355 batting average and set career highs with 27 triples and 11 home runs. He also collected 22 doubles and 37 stolen bases, while scoring 112 runs and driving in 119. He became the first player to hit a triple and a home run in the same inning. George Davis baseball card (1909‚Äì1911) Davis continued to perform at an elite level throughout the 1890s, regularly ranking among the league leaders in doubles, triples, RBI, and stolen bases. He had a batting average of more than .300 for nine consecutive seasons beginning in 1893. He began playing more shortstop in 1896 and moved to the position full-time the next season. In 1897, Davis hit .353 and registered a league-best 135 RBI. He led the league in double plays and fielding percentage four times each. During his playing career, Davis enjoyed a reputation as an intelligent and hard- working player who did not participate in dirty play. On their way to practice at the Polo Grounds on April 26, 1900, Davis and teammates Kid Gleason and Mike Grady stumbled upon a raging tenement fire. The players rushed into the building and rescued two women and a three-year-old child. The fire left 45 families homeless. Davis said, \\"I didn't do much. I just went up the ladder the same as the rest of the boys and helped to carry down women and children... I didn't do half as much as Grady and Gleason.\\" His face blistered from the heat, Davis helped his team earn a 10‚Äì10 tie with the Boston Beaneaters that evening. Later career The formation of the American League provided new financial opportunities to ballplayers, and induced by a $4,000 salary, Davis jumped to the Chicago White Sox in 1902. He attempted a return to the Giants the following season for a further raise to $6,700 (the second- highest figure in the league, after that of Nap Lajoie), but was prevented by the implementation of a peace agreement between the warring leagues. Davis sat out the bulk of the season before returning to the White Sox, with whom he spent the remainder of his career. His raw offensive statistics from this time pale before those of his earlier career, but when properly compared to a drastic league-wide decline in offense, they remain impressive. Davis stole home in Game 5 of the 1906 World Series for the champion White Sox. He also had three runs batted in for the Sox in the title-clinching Game 6 against the crosstown Chicago Cubs. His decline began for real in , though, and he retired after the season. His career totals in several statistical categories rank in the top 100 players all-time, including games played, at bats, hits, runs, doubles, triples, RBI and stolen bases. Later life Davis returned to the minor leagues for one season as player-manager of the 1910 Des Moines Boosters. He managed a bowling alley in the early 1910s. He was the Amherst College baseball coach from 1913 to 1918, then he became a car salesman. The circumstances of his death remained a mystery until baseball historian Lee Allen discovered its details through a campaign to track down historical baseball players, run in part in The Sporting News. Davis was admitted to a Philadelphia mental institution in 1934 suffering from paresis due to tertiary syphilis. He died in the institution in 1940. Davis was survived by his wife Jane, who was said to have been angry at him when he died. They had no children. His wife spent $41 to have him buried within a day at nearby Fernwood Cemetery. Legacy In a 1995 book, baseball author Bill James referred to Davis as baseball's best player who had not been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Also in 1995, Davis was featured in David Pietrusza's television film Local Heroes in the segment \\"Knocking on Cooperstown's Door.\\" In 1997, baseball researcher Frederick Ivor-Campbell said that Davis was \\"the most neglected player of the 19th century. He's definitely the best eligible player not in the Hall, and he's a lot better than a lot of guys already in.\\" Around the same time, Davis was rated the 21st best baseball player of all time in the official baseball encyclopedia, Total Baseball. Davis was up for a vote before the Hall of Fame's Veterans Committee in 1998. Before the committee voted, sportswriter Dave Anderson wrote an article in The New York Times on Davis's Hall of Fame candidacy. He pointed out the work of Cohoes city historian Walt Lipka, which favorably compared Davis to almost all of the shortstops in the Hall of Fame. Anderson supported Davis's election, saying, \\"It's as if he were discarded nearly a century ago into a time capsule that was forgotten until now... For too long, George Stacey Davis has been his era's most forgotten best player.\\" He was selected for induction that year. Prior to his Hall of Fame induction, a Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) chapter in New York put out a call to locate a descendant of Davis to be present at the induction ceremony and announced plans for a historical marker in Cohoes. As a great deal of time had passed since his death, no relatives could be located, but a group of about 50 people from Cohoes traveled to the ceremony in support of Davis.

Wrigley which existed from 1943 to 1954. The AAGPBL is the forerunner of women's professional league sports in the United States. Over 600 women played in the league, which consisted of eventually 10 teams located in the American Midwest. In 1948, league attendance peaked at over 900,000 spectators. The most successful team, the Rockford Peaches, won a league-best four championships. The 1992 motion picture A League of Their Own is a mostly fictionalized account of the early days of the league and its stars. Founding and play All-American Girls Professional Baseball League members performing calisthenics in alt= With the entry of the United States into World War II, several major league baseball executives started a new professional league with women players in order to maintain baseball in the public eye while the majority of able men were away. The founders included Philip K. Wrigley, Branch Rickey, and Paul V. Harper. They feared that Major League Baseball might even temporarily cease due to the war because of the loss of talent, as well as restrictions on team travel due to gasoline rationing. The women's initial tryouts were held at Wrigley Field in Chicago. Scouted from amateur softball games across the country, over 200 women were invited to try- out, and about 60 were selected for the league roster. Like the male major- league, the 'girls' league was also informally segregated, thus no African Americans were recruited or hired. Women were selected for their skilled play, but the player also needed to fit what was seen by marketers as a wholesome feminine ideal. The first league game was played on May 30, 1943. Scouts for the Chicago-based All-American Girls Professional Baseball League initially sought and recruited talent from the Chicago softball Metropolitan League, among with several others. However, after seeing many of their players leave for the AAGPL, it was decided to then turn the amateur Metropolitan League to a professional league. The result was the creation of the six-team National Girls Baseball League, which began in 1944, composed entirely of Chicago-area teams. The National Girls baseball League was founded by Emery Parichy, Charles Bidwill, owner of the Chicago Cardinals football team and politician Ed Kolski. Pirachy operated the Metropolitan League. Football star Red Grange was hired to preside over the league. The NGBL was much less publicized than the AAGPL, but it paralleled the AAGPL, as it also lasted until 1954 and drew up to 500,000 fans per season. For a time, the two leagues were involved in a strong rivalry for players, before meeting and calling a poaching truce in 1946. Many players and several managers appeared in both leagues.https://sabr.org/journal/article/the-international-girls-baseball- league/ In the winter of 1952‚Äì1953, players from both the AAGPL and National Girls Baseball League played together in the four‚Äìteam International Girls Baseball League based in Miami, Florida. The All-American Girls Professional Baseball League went through three periods of ownership. It was owned by chewing gum mogul Wrigley from 1943 to 1945, wealthy publicist Arthur Meyerhoff from 1945 to 1951, and the teams were individually owned from 1951 to 1954. The teams generally played in Midwestern cities. The South Bend Blue Sox and the Rockford Peaches were the only two teams that stayed in their home cities for the full period of the AAGPBL's existence. In the first season, the league played a game that was a hybrid of baseball and softball. The ball was 12 inches in circumference, the size of a regulation softball (regulation baseballs are 9 to 9 inches). The pitcher's mound was only forty feet from home plate, closer even than in regulation softball and much closer than the baseball distance of 60 feet, 6 inches. Pitchers threw underhand windmill, like in softball, and the distance between bases was 65 feet, five feet longer than in softball, but 25 feet shorter than in baseball. Major similarities between the AAGPBL and baseball included nine player teams and the use of a pitcher's mound (softball pitchers throw from flat ground). By 1948, the ball had shrunk to 10 inches, overhand pitching was allowed, and the mound was moved back to 50 feet. Over the history of the league, the rules continued to gradually approach those of baseball. By the final season in 1954, the ball was regulation baseball size, the mound was moved back to 60 feet, and the basepaths were extended to 85 feet (still five feet shorter than in regulation baseball). Teams were generally managed by men who knew competitive athletics and were former major league players, in part to demonstrate to fans that the league was serious. Salaries were above average for women and ranged from $45‚Äì$85 (or $‚Äì$ in dollars) a week during the first years of play to about $125 (or $ in dollars) per week in later years. The women's league generally went along with the men's late spring to early autumn season.[Johnson, Anne Janette. Great Women in Sports. Detroit: Visible Ink Press, 1996.] The uniforms worn by the female ballplayers consisted of a belted, short-sleeved tunic dress with a slight flare of the skirt. Rules stated that skirts were to be worn no more than six inches above the knee, but the regulation was most often ignored in order to facilitate running and fielding. A circular team logo was sewn on the front of each dress, and baseball caps featured elastic bands in the back so that they were one-size-fits-all. During spring training, the girls were required to attend Helena Rubinstein's evening charm school classes. The proper etiquette for every situation was taught, and every aspect of personal hygiene, mannerisms, and dress code was presented to all the players. In an effort to make each player as physically attractive as possible, each received a beauty kit and instructions on how to use it. As a part of the league's 'Rules of Conduct', the 'girls' were not permitted to have short hair, they could not smoke or drink in public places, and they were required to wear lipstick at all times. Fines for not following the league's rules of conduct were five dollars for the first offense, ten for the second, and suspension for the third. In 1944, Josephine \\"JoJo\\" D'Angelo was fired for cutting her hair short. The women's contracts were much stricter about behavior than in the men's league, and each team was also assigned its own chaperone by the league. The AAGPBL received extensive publicity from its inception throughout the 1940s. The league was featured in both national periodicals such as Time, Life, Seventeen, Newsweek, and American Magazine, as well as in local city newspapers. Philip Wrigley, the league's founder, believed in the value of advertising, which may have attributed to the league's extensive exposure and marketing focus. Wrigley learned to appreciate advertising from his father, William Wrigley, who had success with his chewing gum company in large part due to marketing methods. The league remained under Wrigley's advertising influence until 1951, when individual team directors took over the publicity.Fidler, Merrie A. \\"Establishing the Public Image: Publicity and Promotion, 1943 - 1944.\\" In The Origin and History of the All- American Girls Professional Baseball League, 50-68. Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2006. The league's principle advertising agent was Arthur E. Meyerhoff who handled the league's publicity from 1943 through 1950. Meyerhoff's promotional efforts focused on the value of national exposure in popular periodicals. These magazine articles attracted new fans and new players to the AAGPBL. The major publicity themes that characterized the league were ‚ÄúRecreation for War Workers,‚Äù ‚ÄúFemininity,‚Äù ‚ÄúCommunity Welfare,‚Äù and ‚ÄúFamily Entertainment.‚Äù The league shifted to decentralized league administration from 1951 to 1954. Thus, the responsibility was on individual team management to publicize and promote the teams. However, local managers were not always effective due to their lack of expertise in advertising. In the 1951 season, the league president Fred Leo asked all team presidents to provide publicity on games and training events. Only one team complied with Fred Leo's request, which led to an early 1952 preseason board meeting to discuss inadequate promotion.Fidler, Merrie A. \\"Decentralization of Publicity and Promotion, 1951-1954.\\" In The Origin and History of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, 136-142. Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2006. Due to the decentralized league administration, many of the promotion efforts from team management were aimed exclusively at local populaces. There were many promotional events with players, children's benefits, civic groups, and holiday celebrations. Along with daily newspaper reports, the primary advertising strategy was radio broadcasts. The AAGPBL peaked in attendance during the 1948 season, when 10 teams attracted 910,000 paid fans. The Rockford Peaches won the most league championships with four (1945, 1948, 1949, 1950). The Milwaukee/Grand Rapids Chicks were second with three (1944 in Milwaukee, 1947 and 1953 in Grand Rapids). The Racine Belles (1943 and 1946) and the South Bend Blue Sox (1951 and 1952) each won two, and the Kalamazoo Lassies won in the league's final season (1954). Legacy The 1992 film A League of Their Own, although fictionalized, covers the founding and play of this league. Geena Davis, Lori Petty, Rosie O'Donnell, Madonna, and Tom Hanks were the stars of the film, which was directed by Penny Marshall. The league is the forerunner of later- day professional league sports played by women. Lois Siegel documented the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League in her film Baseball Girls, which was produced by the National Film Board of Canada.

Although the AAGPBL was the first recorded professional women's baseball league, women had played baseball since the nineteenth century. The first known women's baseball team played at Vassar College in 1866,Debra A.

The Glory of Their Times: The Story of the Early Days of Baseball Told by the Men Who Played It. ) Baseball Hall of Fame members Max Carey and Jimmie Foxx managed teams in the AAGPBL. The character of Jimmy Dugan, played by Tom Hanks in A League of Their Own, was loosely based on Foxx's tenure in the league. However, several of his former AAGPBL players said that, unlike Hanks‚Äô character in the movie, Foxx was always gentlemanly around them. Logo of the All-American Girls Softball League, 1943The league went through a series of name changes during its history. It was founded as the All-American Girls Softball League, but midway through its first season of 1943, the name was changed to the All-American Girls Baseball League (AAGBBL). After the 1943 season, the official League name was again changed, to the All-American Girls Professional Ball League (AAGPBL), reflecting that players were paid from the start and further separating it from existing amateur leagues. This name was used until the end of the 1945 season, when the league reverted to All-American Girls Baseball League (AAGBBL), which it would use through 1950. When teams were sold to independent owners at the end of the 1950 season, the official League name was changed to the American Girls Baseball League (AGBL), although it continued to be popularly identified as the All-American League or the All-American Girls Baseball League (AAGBBL). When the Players' Association organized in 1986, and gained recognition by the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1988, it was finally named All-American Girls Professional Baseball League (AAGPBL). Rules of play Uniforms Reproduction 1944 Milwaukee Chicks uniform on display at Miller ParkThe uniform was a one-piece short-skirted flared tunic with a team patch in the center of the chest. The base uniform was designed by Wrigley Company art director Otis Shepard, assisted by Wrigley's wife Helen and Chicago softball player Ann Harnett, the first player signed by the league. Shepard was also the longtime art director for the Chicago Cubs and spearheaded a series of innovative uniforms beginning in 1937. Shepard designed all visual elements of the league, including game scorecards and promotional materials. For his work on the AAGPBL and the Cubs, Shepard was called the \\"chief visualizer of mid-century baseball.\\" Shepard modeled the uniform after the figure skating, field hockey, and tennis outfits of the period. The uniforms included satin shorts, knee-high baseball socks, and a baseball cap. The team patches were modeled after each respective city's seal. In the beginning, each team was issued one uniform style, to be worn in all games. Shepard unveiled the inaugural uniforms in a palette of pastel colors: green for Kenosha; yellow for Racine; blue for South Bend; and peach for Rockford. The accessories (cap, belt, stirrups) were bold darker shades of the team color. As new teams were added, they were given a new distinctive team color (gray for Milwaukee, pink for Minneapolis). Road uniforms were introduced to the league starting with the 1948 season. Theme song The theme song made famous in the 1992 film A League of Their Own was the official song of the All-American Girls Baseball League, co-written by Pepper Paire and Nalda Bird (although in the movie, the word \\"Irishmen\\" was changed to \\"Irish ones\\"). In their annual reunions since 1998, it is usual to hear the original AAGPBL players singing the song.

Many people in the 1950s thought that women were not supposed to play baseball, so most female athletes competed on other fields of endeavor. Finally, in 1980, former pitcher June Peppas launched a newsletter project to get in touch with friends, teammates, and opponents that resulted in the league's first reunion in Chicago, Illinois in 1982. The Players Association was formed after a 1986 Reunion held in Fort Wayne as part of Run, Jane, Run, a local Women's Bureau event. Historian and Baseball card publisher Sharon Roepke (author of Diamond Gals) who was circulating a petition to get the Baseball Hall of Fame to recognize the All American Girls Baseball League asked the players at the Reunion to organize to help the effort. A meeting was held at the South Bend home of Fran Janssen, and the Player's Association was born. June Peppas was nominated President.

Succession is by a change in the law in 2009 governed by absolute primogeniture. Law of succession Dynasts lose their right to the throne if they marry without the permission of the monarch, to be given in the Council of State. Individuals born to unmarried dynasts or to former dynasts who married without royal permission, and their descendants, are excluded from the throne. Further, when approving a marriage, the monarch can impose conditions that must be met in order for any resulting offspring to have succession rights. If there is no eligible person(s) to inherit the throne, the Danish Parliament (the Folketing) has the right to elect a new monarch and determine a line of succession. Line of succession * 15px King Frederick IX (1899‚Äì1972) **15px Queen Margrethe II (born 1940) *** (1) Crown Prince Frederik (b. 1968) **** (2) Prince Christian (b. 2005) **** (3) Princess Isabella (b. 2007) **** (4) Prince Vincent (b. 2011) **** (5) Princess Josephine (b. 2011) *** (6) Prince Joachim (b. 1969) **** (7) Prince Nikolai (b. 1999) **** (8) Prince Felix (b. 2002) **** (9) Prince Henrik (b. 2009) **** (10) Princess Athena (b. 2012) ** (11) Princess Benedikte (b. 1944) =Note= The consent to Princess Benedikte's marriage to Prince Richard of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg in 1968 was given on the condition that their children (and further descendants) would have to take up permanent residence in Denmark during the age of mandatory education if they were to retain their succession rights. Since the condition was not met, Princess Benedikte's children are not deemed to have succession rights and are not included in the official line of succession. It is unclear whether their own descendants will have succession rights if residing in Denmark during the age of mandatory education. One Danish constitutional scholar, the late Professor Henrik Zahle, claimed that the children of Princess Benedikte do have succession rights, but without providing any arguments for the claim. History From the London Protocol in 1852 till 1953, various male-line descendants of King Christian IX had succession rights in Denmark except George I of Greece (former Prince William of Denmark) and subsequent kings of Greece, whose rights to the Danish throne were blocked by article VI of the 1863 treaty between Denmark, France, Great Britain and Russia recognizing George I as king of the Hellenes. The new Act of Succession terminated succession rights but left the excluded individuals in possession of their titles. This created a class of people with royal titles but no rights to the throne. As a distinction, those entitled to inherit the throne are called \\"Prins til Danmark\\" (Prince to Denmark, although this distinction is not made in English) while those without succession rights are referred to as \\"Prins af Danmark\\" (Prince of Denmark). From 1853 until 1953, the crown passed according to agnatic primogeniture. The monarch in 1953, King Frederick IX, had three daughters but no sons. Before the 1953 act, the heir presumptive to the throne was Hereditary Prince Knud, the King's younger brother. The Hereditary Prince was far less popular than the King was. Further, his mother- in-law, Princess Helena, was accused of supporting the Nazi movement during the Second World War. These factors, combined with a belief that the Salic Law was outdated, resulted in the movement to change the succession law so that Frederick's eldest daughter, the then Princess Margrethe, could inherit the throne. Thus, the Salic law was changed to male-preference primogeniture in 1953, meaning that females could inherit, but only if they had no brothers. Prince Knud had three children. His sons married without the monarch's permission and lost both their royal titles and succession rights. Only Knud's daughter, the unmarried Princess Elisabeth, retained her rights to the throne. Since her death, the line of succession has consisted only of descendants of King Frederick IX. Queen Margrethe II's youngest sister, Anne-Marie, married King Constantine II of Greece in 1964. In view of the fact that she was marrying a foreign ruler, although he was himself a Prince of Denmark, consent to the marriage was given on the condition that Anne-Marie renounced her and her descendants' rights to the Danish throne. In 2008, the Danish parliament voted in favour of a new royal succession law that allows a first-born child to one day ascend the throne regardless of whether it is a boy or a girl, similar to that of Sweden and Norway. The bill was voted through two successive parliaments, and submitted to a referendum, ensuring that, in future, the heir apparent to the throne of Denmark would be the monarch's first-born child. However, the 'yes' did not change the actual line of succession at that time. The Crown Princess gave birth to twins on 8 January 2011. Upon their birth, the twins assumed the fourth and fifth place in the line of succession, according to the absolute primogeniture principle adopted, thereby not giving Prince Vincent precedence over his older sister Princess Isabella.A Prince and a Princess are born .

It is a coming- of-age story about a child (Astrid) who is separated from her mother (Ingrid) and placed in a series of foster homes. It deals with themes of motherhood. The book was selected for Oprah's Book Club in May 1999, after which it became a national bestseller. It was adapted as a 2002 film. Plot summary Astrid Magnussen is a 12-year-old girl living in Los Angeles, California with her mother, Ingrid Magnussen, a self-centered and eccentric poet. Astrid's father, Klaus Anders, left before Astrid was old enough to remember him. Ingrid begins dating a man named Barry. Eventually, Ingrid discovers that Barry is cheating on her with younger women, so she breaks into Barry's house and poisons him with a mixture of DMSO and oleander sap. Barry dies, and Ingrid is charged with his murder. Sentenced to life in prison, she promises her daughter that she will come back. Astrid is shuffled from one foster home to another for years. First, she joins Starr, a former stripper, and recovering drug addict and alcoholic. Starr has two children of her own, as well as two other foster children. Astrid (who is 14 by this time) has a sexual relationship with Starr's live-in boyfriend, Ray. As his interest in Starr diminishes, Starr relapses. One night, after confronting Ray over his relationship with Astrid (out of jealousy and not concern), Starr shoots Astrid with a .38. Astrid is hospitalized for a few weeks, at which time she begins abusing the prescription drug Demerol. After recovery Astrid is sent to live with Ed and Marvel Turlock, and their two small children, essentially as an unpaid babysitter. Astrid dislikes the couple, partially due to her dislike of the house, and partially due to Marvel's tendency to make racist statements about minorities, particularly their next-door neighbor, a beautiful African- American prostitute named Olivia Johnstone, whom Astrid befriends. Astrid admires Olivia's beauty, wealth, and hedonistic lifestyle. The Turlocks send Astrid away when they discover she associates with Olivia. Next, Astrid is sent to the home of a Hispanic woman named Amelia Ramos. Despite her wealth, Amelia starves her foster children, and Astrid resorts to eating from the garbage at school. Astrid eventually gets a new caseworker who finds her a new placement. A former actress, Claire Richards, and her husband, Ron, are Astrid's next foster parents. Claire ensures Astrid's comfort. For once, Astrid is doing well in school and pursuing art. Astrid continues corresponding with Ingrid in prison but becomes increasingly bitter towards her mother. Meanwhile, Claire suspects that Ron is having an affair. Claire, emotionally disturbed, commits suicide by overdosing. Astrid, now 17, is placed in MacLaren Children's Center (known as \\"Mac\\") where she meets an artistic boy named Paul Trout. They bond, but Astrid is sent to a new home. Astrid's final home is with Russian immigrant Rena Grushenka. Astrid, still underage, has a sexual relationship with Rena's boyfriend, Sergei. One day, after getting high on acid, Astrid begins to have memories of a woman named Annie. Meanwhile, Ingrid and her lawyer begin to build a case to get Ingrid released from prison. However, their case depends on Astrid: if she testifies that Ingrid did not murder Barry, Ingrid will likely not be sentenced. Astrid realizes that she is in a position of power over her mother and asks Ingrid who Annie is. Ingrid reveals that Annie was a babysitter with whom Ingrid left Astrid for over a year. Astrid is upset and gives Ingrid a choice: to have her testify or to see her daughter return to the person her mother knew her as. Ingrid makes the choice not to ask Astrid to lie for her. Two years later, Astrid is 20 and living with Paul in a rundown flat in Berlin, Germany. Astrid spends her time buying suitcases and transforming them into individual art pieces representing her different foster homes. Ingrid is released from prison after a new trial acquits her. Astrid realizes that if she returns to California to reunite with Ingrid, she must abandon Paul. She chooses to stay with him but longs to go. Major characters **Astrid Magnussen** : the main character, she is twelve years old when the novel opens. Artistic, shy and in the sway of her manipulative mother. The novel depicts her loss of naivety, sexual awakening, and attempts at self-definition. **Ingrid Magnussen** : Astrid's manipulative mother, who is jailed early in the novel for her murder of her lover Barry. When with Astrid, she often forgets she has a daughter and focuses on her eclectic art. Later, she attempts to control Astrid from jail. **Starr** : Astrid's first foster mother, she is a former stripper turned outspoken Christian. She is recovering from alcoholism and drug use and lives in a trailer with her children. She first shows kindness to Astrid but later grows jealous of Astrid's relationship with Ray. **'Uncle' Ray** : Starr's boyfriend, whose children call him \\"Uncle Ray.\\" A seemingly kind mechanic, he begins a sexual relationship with Astrid who is, at the time, 14. Thus the relationship is an example of sexual predation. **Olivia Johnstone** : An African-American high-class prostitute Astrid befriends while living with her second foster family, the Turlocks. Olivia introduces Astrid to a luxurious, hedonistic, and irresponsible lifestyle. **Claire Richards** : Astrid's fourth foster mother, who notices Astrid's artistic talent and encourages her to pursue school. Claire has a weak relationship with her husband, poor self- esteem, and commits suicide after encouragement from Ingrid. **Paul Trout** : An artistic boy Astrid meets while staying at MacLaren Children's Center (known as \\"Mac\\"), a facility for foster children who can't find placements. Astrid later develops a romance with Paul. **Rena Grushenka** : Astrid's final foster mother, a tough, business-savvy Russian woman. She is abrasive but encourages Astrid to make sound financial decisions and to become a good negotiator. Major themes Motherhood is a primary theme of the novel. Astrid struggles to define herself against her biological mother and her various foster mothers, while still searching for the love and acceptance her mother cannot provide from jail. The art pieces Astrid creates at the end of the novel are metaphors for her various mothers and homes. Other major themes include the nature of art; self-reflection and creation; survival of the fittest; and perfection versus imperfection. Reception The novel received good reviews and had a typical publication run for a debut novel. After being named to Oprah's Book Club in 1999, the popularity of the book skyrocketed. It became a national best seller. Currently, it has a 3.95 out of 5 star rating on GoodReads. Adaptations Fitch originally wrote the novel as a short story, which was distinguished in the 1994 edition of \\"Best American Short Stories\\". The novel was adapted into a film, White Oleander, released in 2002 starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Ren√©e Zellweger.

Previously, he had served as the Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals. Cardozo is remembered for his significant influence on the development of American common law in the 20th century, in addition to his philosophy and vivid prose style. Born in New York City, Cardozo passed the bar in 1891 after attending Columbia Law School. He won an election to the New York Supreme Court in 1913 but joined the New York Court of Appeals the following year. He won election as Chief Judge of that court in 1926. As Chief Judge, he wrote majority opinions on cases such as Palsgraf v. Long Island Rail Road Co. In 1932, President Herbert Hoover appointed Cardozo to the Supreme Court to succeed Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. Cardozo served on the Court until his death in 1938, and formed part of the liberal bloc of justices known as the Three Musketeers. He wrote the Court's majority opinion in notable cases such as Nixon v. Condon and Steward Machine Co. v. Davis. Early life and career =Early life and family= Cardozo, the son of Rebecca Washington (n√©e Nathan) and Albert Jacob Cardozo, was born in 1870 in New York City. Both Cardozo's maternal grandparents, Sara Seixas and Isaac Mendes Seixas Nathan, and his paternal grandparents, Ellen Hart and Michael H. Cardozo, were Western Sephardim of the Portuguese Jewish community, and affiliated with Manhattan's Congregation Shearith Israel. Their ancestors had immigrated to the British colonies from London, England before the American Revolution. The family were descended from Jewish-origin New Christian conversos. They left the Iberian Peninsula for Holland during the Inquisition. There they returned to the practice of Judaism. Cardozo family tradition held that their marrano (New Christians who maintained crypto-Jewish practices in secrecy) ancestors were from Portugal, although Cardozo's ancestry has not been firmly traced to that country.Mark Sherman, 'First Hispanic justice? Some say it was Cardozo', The Associated Press, 2009. But \\"Cardozo\\" (archaic spelling of Cardoso), \\"Seixas\\" and \\"Mendes\\" are the Portuguese, rather than Spanish, spelling of those common Iberian surnames. Benjamin Cardozo had a fraternal twin, his sister Emily. There were four other siblings, including an older sister Nell and older brother. Benjamin was named for his uncle, Benjamin Nathan, a vice president of the New York Stock Exchange. He was murdered in 1870 and the case was never solved. Among their many cousins, given their deep history in the US, was the poet Emma Lazarus. Other earlier relations include Francis Lewis Cardozo (1836-1903), Thomas Cardozo, and Henry Cardozo, free men of color of Charleston, South Carolina. Francis became a Presbyterian minister in New Haven, Connecticut after education in Scotland, and was elected as Secretary of State of South Carolina during the Reconstruction era. Later he worked as an educator in Washington, DC under a Republican administration.Richardson, Joe M. \\"Francis L. Cardozo: Black educator during reconstruction.\\" Journal of Negro Education 48.1 (1979): 73‚Äì83. in JSTOR Albert Cardozo, Benjamin Cardozo's father, was a judge on the Supreme Court of New York (the state's general trial court) until 1868. He was implicated in a judicial corruption scandal, sparked by the Erie Railway takeover wars, and forced to resign. The scandal also led to the creation of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York. After leaving the court, the senior Cardozo practiced law for nearly two decades more until his death in 1885. When Benjamin and Emily were young, their mother Rebecca died. The twins were raised during much of their childhood largely by their sister Nell, who was 11 years older. Benjamin remained devoted to her throughout his life. One of Benjamin's tutors was Horatio Alger. =Education= At age 15, Cardozo entered Columbia University where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.Supreme Court Justices Who Are Phi Beta Kappa Members , Phi Beta Kappa website. Retrieved Oct 4, 2009 He was admitted to Columbia Law School in 1889. Cardozo wanted to enter a profession that could enable him to support himself and his siblings, but he also hoped to restore the family name, sullied by his father's actions as a judge. Cardozo left law school after two years without a law degree. =Legal practice= Cardozo passed the bar in 1891 and began practicing appellate law alongside his older brother. Benjamin Cardozo practiced law in New York City until year-end 1913 with Simpson, Warren and Cardozo. Interested in advancement and restoring the family name, Cardozo ran for a judgeship on the New York Supreme Court. In November 1913, Cardozo was elected by a large margin to a 14-year term on that court, taking office on January 1, 1914. New York Court of Appeals In February 1914, Cardozo was designated to the New York Court of Appeals under the Amendment of 1899.Designation, The New York Times, February 3, 1914 He was reportedly the first Jew to serve on the Court of Appeals. In January 1917, he was appointed by the governor to a regular seat on the Court of Appeals to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Samuel Seabury. In November 1917, he was elected on the Democratic and Republican tickets to a 14-year term on the Court of Appeals. In 1926, he was elected, on both tickets again, to a 14-year term as Chief Judge. He took office on January 1, 1927, and resigned on March 7, 1932 to accept an appointment to the United States Supreme Court. His tenure was marked by a number of original rulings, in tort and contract law in particular. This is partly due to timing; rapid industrialization was forcing courts to look anew at old common law components to adapt to new settings. In 1921, Cardozo gave the Storrs Lectures at Yale University, which were later published as The Nature of the Judicial Process (On line version), a book that remains valuable to judges today. Shortly thereafter, Cardozo became a member of the group that founded the American Law Institute, which crafted a Restatement of the Law of Torts, Contracts, and a host of other private law subjects. He wrote three other books that also became standards in the legal world. While on the Court of Appeals, he criticized the Exclusionary rule as developed by the federal courts, saying: \\"The criminal is to go free because the constable has blundered.\\" He noted that many states had rejected the rule, but suggested that the adoption by the federal courts would affect the practice in the sovereign states.People of the State of New York v. John Defore, 150 N.E. 585 (1926). . United States Supreme Court Justice Cardozo in his robes Cardozo's Supreme Court nomination In 1932, President Herbert Hoover appointed Cardozo to the Supreme Court of the United States to succeed Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes. The New York Times said of Cardozo's appointment that \\"seldom, if ever, in the history of the Court has an appointment been so universally commended.\\" Democratic Cardozo's appointment by a Republican president has been referred to as one of the few Supreme Court appointments in history that was not motivated by partisanship or politics, but strictly based on the nominee's contribution to law. At the time Hoover was running for re-election, eventually against Democrat Franklin Roosevelt, so he may still have been considering a larger political calculation. Cardozo was confirmed by a unanimous voice vote in the Senate on February 24.(The New York Times, February 25, 1932, p. 1) On a radio broadcast on March 1, 1932, the day of Cardozo's confirmation, Clarence C. Dill, Democratic Senator for Washington, called Hoover's appointment of Cardozo \\"the finest act of his career as President\\".(The New York Times, March 2, 1932, p. 13) The entire faculty of the University of Chicago Law School had urged Hoover to nominate Cardozo, as did the deans of the law schools at Harvard, Yale, and Columbia. Justice Harlan Fiske Stone strongly urged Hoover to name Cardozo, even offering to resign to make room for him if Hoover had his heart set on someone else (Stone had suggested to Calvin Coolidge that he should nominate Cardozo in 1925 before Stone).(Handler, 1995) Hoover originally demurred; he was concerned that there were already two justices from New York, and a Jew on the court. Justice James McReynolds was known as a notorious anti-Semite. When the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, William E. Borah of Idaho, added his strong support for Cardozo, however, Hoover finally bowed to the pressure. Cardozo was a member of the Three Musketeers, along with Brandeis and Stone, who were considered to be the liberal faction of the Supreme Court. In his years as an Associate Justice, Cardozo wrote opinions that stressed the necessity for the tightest adherence to the Tenth Amendment. Death In late 1937, Cardozo had a heart attack, and in early 1938, he suffered a stroke. He died on July 9, 1938, at the age of 68. He was buried in Beth Olam Cemetery in Queens.

Honors Cardozo received the honorary degree of LL.D. from several colleges and universities, including: Columbia (1915); Yale (1921); New York (1922); Michigan (1923); Harvard (1927); St. John's (1928); St. Lawrence (1932); Williams (1932); Princeton (1932); Pennsylvania (1932); Brown (1933); and Chicago (1933). Personal life Cardozo had an apartment in this building in Washington, D.C. As an adult, Cardozo no longer practiced Judaism (he identified as an agnostic), but he was proud of his Jewish heritage.Benjamin Cardozo., Jewish Virtual Library, Of the six children born to Albert and Rebecca Cardozo, only his twin sister Emily married. She and her husband did not have any children. Constitutional law scholar Jeffrey Rosen noted in a The New York Times Book Review of Richard Polenberg's book on Cardozo: =Ethnicity= Cardozo was the second Jewish justice to be appointed to the Supreme Court. The first was Louis Brandeis, whose family was Ashkenazi. Cardozo was born into the Spanish and Portuguese Jewish community, which had traditions distinct from the Ashkenazi. Since the appointment of Justice Sonia Sotomayor in the 21st century, some commentators have suggested that Cardozo should be considered the 'first Hispanic justice.' But he did not grow up in Hispanic culture. In 1492 the Spanish Crown expelled resident Jews who would not convert, and persecuted some who did. In response to this controversy, Cardozo biographer Kaufman questioned the usage of the term \\"Hispanic\\" in Justice Cardozo's lifetime, stating: \\"Well, I think he regarded himself as a Sephardic Jew whose ancestors came from the Iberian Peninsula.\\" After centuries in British North America, Cardozo \\"confessed in 1937 that his family preserved neither the Spanish language nor Iberian cultural traditions\\". Ancestors had lived in England, the British colonies, and the United States since the 17th century. Some Latino advocacy groups, such as the National Association of Latino Elected Officials and the Hispanic National Bar Association, consider Sonia Sotomayor to be the first Hispanic justice, as she was raised in Hispanic culture.

A doorway page will affect the index of a search engine by inserting results for particular phrases while sending visitors to a different page. Doorway pages that redirect visitors without their knowledge use some form of cloaking. This usually falls under Black Hat SEO. If a visitor clicks through to a typical doorway page from a search engine results page, in most cases they will be redirected with a fast Meta refresh command to another page. Other forms of redirection include use of JavaScript and server side redirection, from the server configuration file. Some doorway pages may be dynamic pages generated by scripting languages such as Perl and PHP. Doorway pages are often easy to identify in that they have been designed primarily for search engines, not for human beings. Sometimes a doorway page is copied from another high ranking page, but this is likely to cause the search engine to detect the page as a duplicate and exclude it from the search engine listings. Because many search engines give a penalty for using the META refresh command, some doorway pages just trick the visitor into clicking on a link to get them to the desired destination page, or they use JavaScript for redirection. More sophisticated doorway pages, called Content Rich Doorways, are designed to gain high placement in search results without using redirection. They incorporate at least a minimum amount of design and navigation similar to the rest of the site to provide a more human-friendly and natural appearance. Visitors are offered standard links as calls to action. Landing pages are regularly misconstrued to equate to Doorway pages within the literature. The former are content rich pages to which traffic is directed within the context of pay-per-click campaigns and to maximize SEO campaigns. Doorway pages are also typically used for sites that maintain a blacklist of URLs known to harbor spam, such as Facebook, Tumblr and Deviantart. Cloaking Doorway pages often also employ Cloaking techniques for misdirection. Cloaked pages will show a version of that page to human visitor which is different from the one provided to crawlers - usually implemented via server side scripts. The server can differentiate between bots, crawlers and human visitors based on various flags, including source IP address and/or user-agent. Cloaking will simultaneously trick search engines to rank sites higher for irrelevant keywords, while displaying monetizing any human traffic by showing visitors spammy, often irrelevant, content. The practice of cloaking is considered to be highly manipulative and condemned within the SEO industry and by search engines, and its use can result in massive penalty or the complete removal of sites from being indexed Redirection Webmasters that use doorway pages would generally prefer that users never actually see these pages and instead be delivered to a \\"real\\" page within their sites. To achieve this goal, redirection is sometimes used. This may be as simple as installing a meta refresh tag on the doorway pages. An advanced system might make use of cloaking. In either case, such redirection may make your doorway pages unacceptable to search engines. Construction A content rich doorway page must be constructed in a Search engine friendly (SEF) manner, otherwise it may be construed as search engine spam possibly resulting in the page being banned from the index for an undisclosed amount of time. These types of doorways utilize (but are not limited to) the following: * Title Attributed images for key word support * Title Attributed links for key word support In culture Doorway pages were examined as a cultural and political phenomenon along with spam poetry and flarf.

Asparagus is its only food plant. The beetle is 6.0 mm to 9.5 mm long and slightly elongated. It is metallic blue-black in color with cream or yellow spots on its red-bordered elytra. The larvae are fat gray grubs with dark heads. The adult beetles and the larvae strip the needle-like leaves off the asparagus fronds, depriving the plants of the ability to photosynthesize and store energy for future years. They also chew the spears and lay generous amounts of eggs on them, making the crop unmarketable. The larvae feed on the plants for a few weeks, then drop to the ground to pupate. One year may see two or three generations of the beetle. The adults overwinter in a dormant state underground or in nearby leaf litter. The parasitic wasp, Tetrastichus coeruleus, occurring mainly in the United States and Europe, can cause up to 71% mortality in the field and has been successfully used for biological control. Various insecticides (such as carbamates, pyrethroids, spinetoram, and spinosad) can be considered for pest control. The similar spotted asparagus beetle (Crioceris duodecimpunctata) is also a pest as an adult, feeding on tender shoots and leaves, but since the larvae feed only on the asparagus berries it is not considered to be as important.

He played John Wayne's adversary Bart Jason in the 1966 Western El Dorado. He has played Santa Claus in several films, notably in 2003's Elf. In 2009, he starred as the voice of Carl Fredricksen in Pixar's animated film Up, and made a guest appearance on CSI: NY in the episode \\"Yahrzeit\\".

He later made frequent guest appearances with the successor to Compass, The Second City. In New York City, Asner played Jonathan Jeremiah Peachum in the Off-Broadway revival of Threepenny Opera, scored his first Broadway role in Face of a Hero alongside Jack Lemmon in 1960, and began to make inroads as a television actor, having made his TV debut in 1957 on Studio One. In two notable performances on television, Asner played Detective Sgt. Thomas Siroleo in the 1963 episode of The Outer Limits titled \\"It Crawled Out of the Woodwork\\" and the reprehensible ex-premier Brynov in the 1965 Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea episode \\"The Exile.\\" He made his film debut in 1962, in the Elvis Presley vehicle Kid Galahad.

In 1977, after the series, Asner's character was given his own show, Lou Grant (1977‚Äì82). In contrast to the Mary Tyler Moore series, a thirty-minute award- winning comedy about television journalism, the Lou Grant series was an hour- long award-winning drama about newspaper journalism.

Asner was acclaimed for his role in the ABC miniseries Roots, as Captain Davies, the morally conflicted captain of the Lord Ligonier, the slave ship that brought Kunta Kinte to America. The role earned Asner an Emmy Award, as did the similarly dark role of Axel Jordache in the miniseries Rich Man, Poor Man (1976). In contrast, he played a former pontiff in the lead role of Papa Giovanni: Ioannes XXIII (Pope John XXIII 2002), an Italian television film for RAI.

In July 2010, Asner completed recording sessions for Shattered Hopes: The True Story of the Amityville Murders; a documentary on the 1974 DeFeo murders in Amityville, New York. Asner served as the narrator for the film, which covers a forensic analysis of the murders, the trial in which 23-year-old DeFeo son Ronald DeFeo Jr., was convicted of the killings, and the subsequent \\"haunting\\" story which is revealed to be a hoax. Also in 2010, Asner played the title role in FDR, a stage production about the life of Franklin Delano Roosevelt; he has subsequently continued to tour the play throughout the country.

He subsequently toured for the next three years in \\"concert readings\\" of the play in more than a dozen cities across the United States. In 2019, PBS flagship station WNET filmed the concert reading at New York's Center for Jewish History for their All Arts channel. The performance, which is available for free, world-wide live-streaming, co-stars Tovah Feldshuh, Ned Eisenberg, and Liba Vaynberg. Further plans for Asner to perform the play have been postponed during the Coronavirus pandemic.

He endorsed Barack Obama during the 2008 United States presidential election. He was formerly a member of the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee (DSOC) and is a member of DSOC's successor, the Democratic Socialists of America. The sudden cancellation of Lou Grant in 1982 was the subject of much controversy. The show had high ratings‚Äîthe level of which should have justified its ongoing presence in primetime (it was in the ACNielsen top ten throughout its final month on the air). However, the CBS television network declined to renew it. It has been Asner's consistent position that his left-wing political views, as well as the publicity surrounding them, were the actual root causes for the show's cancellation. Asner endorsed Democratic candidate Marcy Winograd in the 2011 California 36th Congressional district special election. From 2011 to 2015, Asner worked with filmmaker Nicole Zwiren on the feature-length documentary Behind the Fear which addresses HIV/AIDS denialism.

Asner was adamantly opposed to such a merger, arguing that the planned merger would destroy the SAG's health plan and disempower actors. Asner and a group of fellow actors and voice-actors, including Martin Sheen and Ed Harris, filed (but later dropped) a lawsuit against SAG president Ken Howard and several SAG vice presidents, seeking to have the merger overturned, and the two unions separated to their pre-merger organizations.

He is the creator of the iconic underground characters The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers, Fat Freddy's Cat, and Wonder Wart-Hog.  Biography  = Early life and education = Shelton was born in Houston, Texas. He graduated from Lamar High School in Houston. He attended Washington and Lee University, Texas A&M; University, and the University of Texas at Austin, where he received his bachelor's degree in the social sciences in 1961. His early cartoons were published in the University of Texas' humor magazine The Texas Ranger. = Career = Directly after graduation, Shelton moved to New York City and got a job editing automotive magazines, where he would sneak his drawings into print. Early work of his was published in Warren Publishing's Help! The idea for the character of Wonder Wart-Hog, a porcine parody of Superman, came to him in 1961. The following year, Shelton moved back to Texas to enroll in graduate school and get a student deferment from the draft. The first two Wonder Wart-Hog stories appeared in Bacchanal, a short-lived college humor magazine, in the spring of 1962. That same year, he published (in zine form) Frank Stack's The Adventures of Jesus, one of the first underground comix; Stack wrote and drew the comic strip under the name Foolbert Sturgeon. Shelton then became editor of The Texas RangerShelton entry, Who's Who of American Comic Books, 1928‚Äì1999. Accessed Nov. 5, 2016. and published more Wonder Wart-Hog stories.

Accessed Dec. 22, 2016. for two years, he was finally drafted, but Army doctors declared him medically unfit after he admitted to taking psychedelic drugs. After this, in 1964 and 1965, he spent some time in Cleveland, where his girlfriend Pat Brown (another UT alum)Holland, Richard A. The Texas Book: Profiles, History, and Reminiscences of the University (University of Texas Press, 2006), pp. 223‚Äì299. was going to the Cleveland Institute of Art. He applied for a job at the Cleveland-based American Greeting Card Company (where a fellow underground comic artist Robert Crumb had worked) but was turned down. The period of 1965‚Äì1968 was an itinerant one for Shelton: he moved to New York to work for the underground East Village Other, and to Los Angeles to work for the Los Angeles Free Press. Around this time Shelton became art director for the Vulcan Gas Company, a rock music venue in Austin, Texas, where he worked with Jim Franklin. He created a number of posters in the style of contemporary California poster artists such as Victor Moscoso and Rick Griffin. After a year of this, he moved to San Francisco in 1968, hopeful that being closer to the action would enable him to do more poster work; as it turned out, he finally got his break in the world of underground comix. That same year, Millar Publishing Company, who had been publishing regular Wonder Wart-Hog stories since 1966, published two issues of Wonder Wart-Hog. 140,000 copies of each were printed, but distributors did not pick up the magazine, and only 40,000 of each were sold. In 1968 Shelton self-publlished Feds 'n' Heads, a collection of strips first published in the Austin underground paper The Rag (Feds 'n' Head was later re-issued multiple times by the Print Mint),Estren, Mark. A History of Underground Comics: 20th Anniversary Edition (Ronin Publishing, 2012), p. 54. Feds 'n' Heads featured Wonder Wart-Hog and what became his most famous strip, The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers. Shelton created a spin-off strip, Fat Freddy's Cat in 1969, when he also co-founded Rip Off Press with three fellow \\"expatriate\\" Texans: Fred Todd, Dave Moriaty, and cartoonist Jack Jackson. Shelton was also a regular contributor to Zap Comix and other underground titles, including Bijou Funnies, Yellow Dog, Arcade, The Rip Off Review of Western Culture, and Anarchy Comics He did the cover art for the 1973 album Doug Sahm and Band, as well as The Grateful Dead's 1978 album, Shakedown Street. He also illustrated the cover of the early classic computer magazine compilation The Best of Creative Computing Volume 2 in 1977. His most recent work, in collaboration with French cartoonist Pic, is Not Quite Dead, which appeared in Rip Off Comix #25 (Rip Off Press, Winter 1989) and in six Not Quite Dead comic books. A new Wonder Wart-Hog story appeared in Zap Comix #15 (Last Gasp, 2005), as well as The Complete Zap boxed set (Fantagraphics, 2014) which contained Zap #16; and a new Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers story appeared in Zap #16 as well. The Freak Brothers' antics are reportedly being turned into a Broadway musical, after a stop motion animated film, titled Grass Roots, fell through. Fifty Freakin' Years with the Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers was published in 2017, containing new strips by Shelton, as well as his written introduction. = Music = In 1966 Shelton formed the Gilbert Shelton Ensemble and released a 45 record on ESP Records, \\"If I Was A Hells Angel\\" b/w \\"Southern Stock Car Man\\" backed by members of Austin psychedlic-rock band The Conqueroo, Tom Bright, Bob Brown and Ed Guinn.

It lies in a farming area of the Wairarapa in New Zealand's North Island. It is located southwest of Masterton and northeast of Wellington. The town has a population of ), out of a total district population of . Carterton was founded in 1857. Originally known as Three Mile Bush, it served as housing for workers building the road between Wellington and Masterton. It was later renamed after Charles Carter, who was in charge of the building of the Black Bridge over the Waiohine River south of the town. The town describes itself as New Zealand's daffodil capital, holding a Daffodil Festival each year on the second Sunday in September, with the main event taking place at Middle Run along Gladstone Road. History Carterton was the first place in the world to elect a transgender mayor, Georgina Beyer. Beyer went on to set another world's first record, becoming the MP for Wairarapa in 1999. On 7 January 2012, a hot air balloon crashed just north of the town, killing eleven people and making headlines around the world. The balloon came into contact with a high-voltage power line supplying the town, resulting in the balloon catching fire and the town losing power briefly. In 1956, along with Masterton, Carterton became the joint first town in New Zealand to use the 111 Emergency Number. Demographics Carterton District had a population of 9,198 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 963 people (11.7%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 2,097 people (29.5%) since the 2006 census. There were 3,645 households. There were 4,524 males and 4,674 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.97 males per female. Of the total population, 1,740 people (18.9%) were aged up to 15 years, 1,281 (13.9%) were 15 to 29, 4,113 (44.7%) were 30 to 64, and 2,064 (22.4%) were 65 or older. Figures may not add up to the total due to rounding. Ethnicities were 91.4% European/PƒÅkehƒÅ, 13.4% MƒÅori, 1.8% Pacific peoples, 2.2% Asian, and 1.9% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity. The percentage of people born overseas was 16.6, compared with 27.1% nationally. Although some people objected to giving their religion, 53.1% had no religion, 35.5% were Christian, and 3.2% had other religions. Of those at least 15 years old, 1,350 (18.1%) people had a bachelor or higher degree, and 1,620 (21.7%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $29,800. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 3,492 (46.8%) people were employed full-time, 1,242 (16.7%) were part-time, and 240 (3.2%) were unemployed. Landmarks Carterton's town clock is located on High Street next to the post office. The existing tower was put into operation in September 1962, replacing the original clock tower atop the post office that was damaged in the 24 June 1942 Wairarapa earthquake. The Bank of New South Wales, showing confidence in Carterton, built a beautifully ornate bank building on the corner of Park Road and High Street North in 1912. This building is listed in the historic buildings list found in the Wairarapa Combined District Plan. In 1982, the Bank of New South Wales became Westpac and continued to occupy the building until a devastating earthquake in Christchurch (6.3 on the Richter scale) severely damaged many unreinforced masonry buildings in February 2011. After an unfavourable engineers' assessment the bank shifted out of the building approximately 150 metres south in High Street North. The building underwent substantial seismic strengthening and re-opened as the Carterton Free Presbyterian Church in July 2017. Historic Carterton Railway Station Historic Carterton railway station is located west of the town centre off Belvedere Road. The station building at the station is original, having been built when the railway opened in 1880, and has accepted passenger services ever since. It is currently leased from KiwiRail Network by the Wairarapa Railway Restoration Society. The Carterton District library on Holloway Street is New Zealand's oldest purpose-built library that is still in use as a library today. The Carterton Events Centrehttp://www.cartertonec.co.nz is also on Holloway Street. Opened in October 2011, this state-of-the-art, multi-purpose community facility is available for community and commercial use. Centrally located in the Wairarapa region, the Centre provides modern, flexible, spaces for all manner of events, shows, exhibitions, meetings and community gatherings. Interconnection of spaces throughout the Centre allows for separation and opening up of spaces to cater for different needs. The Events Centre belongs to the Carterton community, through the Carterton District Council. Carterton's Memorial Square is on the corner of High Street and Park Road and holds Carterton's World War One memorial, positioned centrally. The red granite pillar, apparently broken off at the top, symbolising the lives cut short by the war. The memorial was unveiled on 13 February 1921 by Minister of Internal Affairs George Anderson. Since the 1930s Memorial Square has been administered under an act of parliament ‚Äì the Carterton and District Memorial Square Act (1932). On Sundays from 22 February 2015, the Square began to host Carterton Farmers' Market. This weekly produce and craft event was born of the 2014 Place Making Carterton project, initiated by the Carterton District Business (Inc) group and Carterton District Council. Located 10 minutes from the Square is Stonehenge Aotearoa, built by members of The Phoenix Astronomy Society, it is a modern adaptation (opened in 2005) of the Stonehenge ruins on the Salisbury Plain of England. Education Carterton has three primary schools: * Carterton School, a state full primary (Year 1‚Äì8) school with a roll of students as of The school opened in 1861. * South End School, a state full primary (Year 1‚Äì8) school with a roll of students as of The school opened in 1962. * St Mary's School, a state-integrated Catholic full primary (Year 1‚Äì8) school with a roll of students as of The school opened in 1917 and integrated into the state education system in the early 1980s. Ponatahi Christian School a state-integrated composite (Year 1‚Äì13) Christian school, is also located in Carterton. It has a roll of students as of It was founded as a private school in 1978 and was originally sited at Ponatahi, southwest of Carterton. The school moved to its current site over the 1996‚Äì97 summer holidays, and integrated into the state education system in April 1998. There are no state secondary schools in Carterton. The nearest secondary schools are Kuranui College, 10 km away in Greytown, and Wairarapa College and Makoura College 14 km and 15 km away respectively in Masterton. Transport =Roads= The main street through Carterton is High Street - split on either side of Holloway Street into High Street North and High Street South. Other main streets include Park Road, Belvedere Road, Brooklyn Road, Pembroke Street and Holloway Street (which all run approximately east-west) and Lincoln Road (which runs approximately north-south). Other notable streets include Costley Street, Kenwyn Drive and Frederick Street. Carterton District is a rapidly expanding area which, according to inter-census dates (i.e. between 2006 and 2013) is the fastest growing local government area in the North Island with respect to population. A number of new subdivisions have assisted in this expansion such as Hartley Avenue, Daffodil Grove, Armstrong Avenue, Tararua Crescent, Carrington Drive and Mill Grove. Carterton is served by State Highway 2, the main highway between Wellington and Masterton. The highway runs the length of High Street. Carterton is served by Metlink bus route 200, which connects Carterton with Masterton, Greytown, Featherston and Martinborough. =Rail= Carterton lies on the Wairarapa Line, and is served by the Wairarapa Connection operated by KiwiRail and Transdev on behalf of Metlink, connecting Carterton to Wellington. The train serves both Carterton railway station and Matarawa railway station southwest of the township. Churches Carterton has eight congregations that regularly meet in the township.

Judaism In rabbinic Judaism sanctification means sanctifying God's name by works of mercy and martyrdom, while desecration of God's name means committing sin.Jewish Encyclopedia: Sanctification of the Name This is based on the Jewish concept of God, whose holiness is pure goodness and is transmissible by sanctifying people and things.Jewish Encyclopedia: Holiness Christianity In the various branches of Christianity sanctification usually refers to a person becoming holy, with the details differing in different branches. Justo L. Gonz√°lez, Essential Theological Terms, Westminster John Knox Press, USA, 2005, p. 155 =Roman Catholicism= The Catholic Church upholds the doctrine of sanctification, teaching that: According to the Catholic Encyclopedia \\"sanctity\\"Catholic Encyclopedia: Sanctity differs for God, individual, and corporate body. For God, it is God's unique absolute moral perfection. For the individual, it is a close union with God and the resulting moral perfection. It is essentially of God, by a divine gift. For a society, it is the ability to produce and secure holiness in its members, who display a real, not merely nominal, holiness. The Church's holiness is beyond human power, beyond natural power. Sanctity is regulated by established conventional standards. =Eastern Orthodoxy= Orthodox Christianity teaches the doctrine of theosis, whereby humans take on divine properties. A key scripture supporting this is 2 Peter 1:4. In the 4th century, Athanasius taught that God became Man that Man might become God.Athanasius: \\"On the Incarnation\\", Crestwood: Saint Vladimir's Seminary Press, 1989. p.93 Essentially, Man does not become divine, but in Christ can partake of divine nature. This Church's version of salvation restores God's image in man.Robert V. Rakestraw: \\"On Becoming God: An Evangelical Doctrine of Theosis,\\" Journal of Evangelical Theological Society 40/2 (June 1997) 257-269 One such theme is release from mortality caused by desires of the world.Veli- Matti K√§rkk√§inen: \\"One With God: Salvation as Deification and Justification,\\" Collegeville: Liturgical Press, 2004. p.18 =Lutheranism= Martin Luther, taught in his Large Catechism that Sanctification is only caused by the Holy Spirit through the powerful Word of God. The Holy Spirit uses churches to gather Christians together for the teaching and preaching of the Word of God.Lutheran Dogmaticians consider this the broad sense of sanctification. See Luther's Large Catechism, the Apostle's Creed, paragraph 53 and following Luther also viewed the Ten Commandments as means by which the Holy Spirit sanctifies. > \\"Thus we have the Ten Commandments, a commend of divine doctrine, as to what > we are to do in order that our whole life may be pleasing to God, and the > true fountain and channel from and in which everything must arise and flow > that is to be a good work, so that outside of the Ten Commandments no work > or thing can be good or pleasing to God, however great or precious it be in > the eyes of the world...whoever does attain to them is a heavenly, angelic > man, far above all holiness of the world. Only occupy yourself with them, > and try your best, apply all power and ability, and you will find so much to > do that you will neither seek nor esteem any other work or holiness.\\"From > Luther's Large Catechism, the Ten Commandments, paragraph 311 and following. > For further reading of Lutherans on Sanctification, see Sanctification in > Lutheran Theology by David P.

Lange, and Apostles‚Äô Creed, Third Article - Of Sanctification: > The Holy Ghost Works Through The Word by A. J. Kunde Pietistic Lutheranism heavily emphasizes the \\"biblical divine commands of believers to live a holy life and to strive for holy living, or sanctification.\\" =Anglicanism= A 2002 Anglican publishing house book states that ‚Äúthere is no explicit teaching on sanctification in the Anglican formularies‚Äù.Owen C. Thomas, Ellen K. Wondra, Introduction to Theology, 3rd ed (Church Publishing, 2002), 222. A glossary of the Episcopal Church (USA) gives some teaching: ‚ÄúAnglican formularies have tended to speak of sanctification as the process of God's work within us by means of which we grow into the fullness of the redeemed life.‚ÄùDon S. Armentrout and Robert Boak Slocum, eds, An Episcopal Dictionary of the Church (Church Publishing, 2000), s. v. \\"Sanctification\\", 467. Online at http://www.episcopalchurch.org/library/glossary/sanctification-0 Outside official formularies sanctification has been an issue in the Anglican Communion since its inception. The 16th century Anglican theologian Richard Hooker (1554-1600) distinguished between the ‚Äúrighteousness of justification‚Äù that is imputed by God and the ‚Äúrighteousness of sanctification‚Äù that comprises the works one does as an ‚Äúinevitable‚Äù result of being justified.Gibbs, Lee W. \\"Richard Hooker's Via Media Doctrine of Justification\\" in The Harvard Theological Review 74, no. 2 (1981): 211-220. https://www.jstor.org/stable/1509447 (accessed June 10, 2010). Jeremy Taylor (1613-1667) argued that justification and sanctification cannot be separated; they are ‚Äútwo steps in a long process‚Äù.Ralph McMichael, ed, The Vocation of Anglican Theology: Sources and Essays (SCM, 2014), 214-215. A 19th century Church of England work agreed with Jeremy Taylor that justification and sanctification are ‚Äúinseparable‚Äù. However, they are not the same thing. Justification is ‚Äúfound in Christ‚Äôs work alone‚Äù. ‚ÄúSanctification is the work of the Holy Spirit in us, and is a progressive work.‚ÄùAn Explanation of the Articles of the Church of England, Part 1 (Church of England, 1843), 53. Online at https://books.google.com/books?id=yTJWAAAAcAAJ&source;=gbs_navlinks_s =Reformed= Calvinist theologians interpret sanctification as the process of being made holy only through the merits and justification of Jesus Christ through the work of the Holy Spirit that are then reflected in man. Sanctification cannot be attained by any works-based process, but only through the works and power of the divine. When a man is unregenerate, it is his essence that sins and does evil. But when a man is justified through Christ, it is no longer the man (in his essence) that sins, but the man is acting outside of his character. In other words, the man is not being himself, he is not being true to who he is.Gerhard O. Forde, Donald L. Alexander, Sinclair B. Ferguson: \\"Christian spirituality: five views of sanctification\\", InterVarsity Press, 1988. p. 47-76 =Methodist= In Wesleyan-Arminian theology, which is upheld by the Methodist Church as well as by Holiness Churches, \\"sanctification, the beginning of holiness, begins at the new birth\\". With the Grace of God, Methodists \\"do works of piety and mercy, and these works reflect the power of sanctification\\". Examples of these means of grace (works of piety and works of mercy) that aid with sanctification include frequent reception of the sacrament of Holy Communion (work of piety), and visiting the sick and those in prison (work of mercy). Wesleyan covenant theology also emphasizes that an important aspect of sanctification is the keeping of the moral law contained in the Ten Commandments. As such, in \\"sanctification one grows to be more like Christ.\\" This process of sanctification that begins at the new birth (first work of grace) has its goal as Christian perfection, also known as entire sanctification (second work of grace), which John Wesley, the progenitor of the Methodist faith, described as a heart \\"habitually filled with the love of God and neighbor\\" and as \\"having the mind of Christ and walking as he walked\\". To John Wesley the work of entire sanctification was distinctly separate from regeneration and was \\"wrought instantaneously, though it may be approached by slow and gradual steps.\\" A more complete statement of Wesley's position goes like this: > \\"It is that habitual disposition of soul which, in the sacred writings, is > termed holiness; and which directly implies, the being cleansed from sin, > 'from all filthiness both of flesh and spirit;' and, by consequence, the > being endued with those virtues which were also in Christ Jesus; the being > so 'renewed in the spirit of our mind,' as to be 'perfect as our Father in > heaven is perfect.'\\"Wesley, J. (1872). The Works of John Wesley (Third > Edition, Vol. 5, p. 203). London: Wesleyan Methodist Book Room. This is the doctrine that by the power of God's sanctifying grace and attention upon the means of grace may cleanse a Christian of the corrupting influence of original sin in this life. It is expounded upon in the Methodist Articles of Religion:The United Methodist Church: The Articles of Religion of the Methodist Church - Of Sanctification Justification is seen as an initial step of acknowledging God's holiness, with sanctification as, through the grace and power of God, entering into it. A key scripture is Hebrews 12:14: \\"Follow after...holiness, without which no one shall see the Lord.\\" The Wesleyan Church (formerly known as the Wesleyan Methodist Church) states that sanctification has three components‚Äîinitial, progressive, and entire: John Wesley taught that outward holiness in the form of \\"right words and right actions\\" should reflect the inner transformation experienced through the second work of grace. =Pentecostalism= There are two Pentecostal positions on sanctification, entire sanctification and progressive sanctification. Roger E. Olson, The Westminster Handbook to Evangelical Theology, Westminster John Knox Press, USA, 2004, p. 319 Entire sanctification as a second work of grace, is the position of Pentecostal denominations that originally had their roots in Wesleyan-Arminian theology, such as the International Pentecostal Holiness Church, Church of God (Cleveland), Christian and Missionary Alliance , and the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel. William Kostlevy, Historical Dictionary of the Holiness Movement, Scarecrow Press, USA, 2009, p. 148 These denominations differ from the Methodist Churches (inclusive of the Holiness Movement) in that they teach the possibility of a third work of grace-- glossolalia. Progressive sanctification is the work of sanctification of the believer through grace and the decisions of the believer after the new birth. Roger E. Olson, The Westminster Handbook to Evangelical Theology, Westminster John Knox Press, USA 2004, p. 319 This is the position of other Pentecostal denominations, such as the Assemblies of God. Keith Kettenring, The Sanctification Connection: An Exploration of Human Participation in Spiritual Growth, University Press of America, USA, 2008, p. 29 Cecil M. Robeck, Jr, Amos Yong, The Cambridge Companion to Pentecostalism, Cambridge University Press, UK, 2014, p. 76 =Quakerism= George Fox, the founder of Quakerism, taught Christian perfection, also known in the Friends tradition as \\"Perfectionism\\", in which the Christian believer could be made free from sin. In his Some Principles of the Elect People of God Who in Scorn are called Quakers, for all the People throughout all Christendome to Read over, and thereby their own States to Consider, he writes in section \\"XVI. Concerning Perfection\\": The early Quakers, following Fox, taught that as a result of the New Birth through the power of the Holy Spirit, man could be free from actual sinning if he continued to rely on the inward light and \\"focus on the cross of Christ as the center of faith\\". George Fox emphasized \\"personal responsibility for faith and emancipation from sin\\" in his teaching on perfectionism. For the Christian, \\"perfectionism and freedom from sin were possible in this world\\". Some Quaker denominations were founded to emphasize this teaching, such as the Central Yearly Meeting of Friends. =Keswickianism= Keswickian theology, which emerged in the Higher Life Movement, teaches a second work of grace that occurs through \\"surrender and faith\\", in which God keeps an individual from sin. Keswickian denominations, such as the Christian and Missionary Alliance, differ from the Wesleyan-Holiness movement in that the Christian and Missionary Alliance does not see entire sanctification as cleansing one from original sin, whereas holiness denominations espousing the Wesleyan-Arminian theology affirm this belief. =The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints= In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, sanctification is viewed as a process and gift from God which makes every willing member holy, according to their repentance and righteous efforts, through the Savior Jesus Christ's matchless grace. Mark Juergensmeyer, Wade Clark Roof, Encyclopedia of Global Religion, SAGE Publications, USA, 2011, p. 1116 To become Sanctified, or Holy, one must do all that he can to live as Christ lived, according to the teachings of Christ. One must strive to live a holy life to truly be considered Holy.See D. Todd Christofferson, \\"Justification and Sanctification,\\" Ensign, June 2006; C. Eric Ott, \\"Sanctification,\\" Encyclopedia of Mormonism. In the Church's scriptural canon, one reference to sanctification appears in Helaman 3:35, in the Book of Mormon: Elder Dallin H. Oaks, then of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, also expounded on the meaning of sanctity. Islam In Islam, sanctification is termed as tazkiah, other similarly used words to the term are Islah-i qalb (reform of the heart), Ihsan (beautification), taharat (purification), Ikhlas (purity), qalb-is-salim (pure/safe/undamaged heart). Tasawuf (sufism), basically an ideology rather than a term, is mostly misinterpreted as the idea of sanctification in Islam and it is used to pray about saints, especially among Sufis, in whom it is common to say \\"that God sanctifies his secret\\" (\\"qaddasa Llahou Sirruhu\\"), and that the Saint is alive or dead.

H√∂rbiger did not arrive at his ideas through research, but said that he had received it in a \\"vision\\" in 1894. According to his ideas, ice was the basic substance of all cosmic processes, and ice moons, ice planets, and the \\"global ether\\" (also made of ice) had determined the entire development of the universe.https://bigthink.com/paul-ratner/the-weird-ice-world-cosmology- passionately-believed-by-hitler-and-other-top-nazis History By his own account, H√∂rbiger was observing the Moon when he was struck by the notion that the brightness and roughness of its surface was due to ice. Shortly after, he experienced a dream in which he was floating in space watching the swinging of a pendulum which grew longer and longer until it broke. \\"I knew that Newton had been wrong and that the sun's gravitational pull ceases to exist at three times the distance of Neptune,\\" he concluded. He worked out his concepts in collaboration with amateur astronomer and schoolteacher Philipp Fauth whom he met in 1898, and published it as Glazial-Kosmogonie in 1912. Fauth had previously produced a large (if somewhat inaccurate) lunar map and had a considerable following, which lent H√∂rbiger's ideas some respectability. It did not receive a great deal of attention at the time, but following World War I H√∂rbiger decided to change his strategy by promoting the new \\"cosmic truth\\" not only to people at universities and academies, but also to the general public. H√∂rbiger thought that if \\"the masses\\" accepted his ideas, then they might put enough pressure on the academic establishment to force his ideas into the mainstream. No effort was spared in popularising the ideas: \\"cosmotechnical\\" societies were founded, which offered public lectures that attracted large audiences, there were cosmic ice movies and radio programs, and even cosmic ice journals and novels. During this period, the name was changed from the Graeco-Latin to the more Germanic [WEL] (\\"World ice theory\\"). The followers of WEL exerted a great deal of public pressure on behalf of the ideas. The movement published posters, pamphlets, books, and even a newspaper The Key to World Events. Companies owned by adherents would only hire people who declared themselves convinced of the WEL's truth. Some followers even attended astronomical meetings to heckle, shouting, \\"Out with astronomical orthodoxy! Give us H√∂rbiger!\\" One of the early supporters of H√∂rbiger's ideas was Houston Stewart Chamberlain, the leading theorist behind the early development of the National Socialist Party in Germany in 1923. Two organizations were set up in Vienna concerned with the idea: the and the H√∂rbiger Institute. The first was formed in 1921 by a group of enthusiastic adherents of the idea, which included engineers, physicians, civil servants, and businessmen. Most had been personally acquainted with H√∂rbiger and had attended his many lectures. Among H√∂rbiger's followers was Viennese author Egon Friedell, who explained the World Ice Theory in his 1930 Cultural History of the Modern Age. Premise According to the idea, the solar system had its origin in a gigantic star into which a smaller, dead, waterlogged star fell. This impact caused a huge explosion that flung fragments of the smaller star out into interstellar space where the water condensed and froze into giant blocks of ice. A ring of such blocks formed, that we now call the Milky Way, as well as a number of solar systems among which was our own, but with many more planets than currently exist. Interplanetary space is filled with traces of hydrogen gas, which cause the planets to slowly spiral inwards, along with ice blocks. The outer planets are large mainly because they have swallowed a large number of ice blocks, but the inner planets have not swallowed nearly as many. One can see ice blocks on the move in the form of meteors, and when one collides with Earth, it produces hailstorms over an area of many square kilometers, while when one falls into the Sun, it produces a sunspot and gets vaporized, making \\"fine ice,\\" that covers the innermost planets. It was also claimed that Earth had had several satellites before it acquired the Moon; they began as planets in orbits of their own, but over long spans of time were captured one by one and slowly spiralled in towards Earth until they disintegrated and their debris became part of Earth's structure. One can supposedly identify the rock strata of several geological eras with the impacts of these satellites. It was believed that the destruction of earlier ice-moons were responsible for The Flood. The last such impact, of the \\"Tertiary\\" or \\"Cenozoic Moon\\" and the capture of our present Moon, is supposedly remembered through myths and legends. This was worked out in detail by H√∂rbiger's English follower Hans Schindler Bellamy; Bellamy recounted how as a child he would often dream about a large moon that would spiral closer and closer in until it burst, making the ground beneath roll and pitch, awakening him and giving him a very sick feeling. When he looked at the Moon's surface through a telescope, he found its surface looking troublingly familiar. When he learned of H√∂rbiger's idea in 1921, he found it a description of his dream. He explained the mythological support he found in such books as Moons, Myths, and Man, In the Beginning God, and The Book of Revelation is History. It was believed that our current Moon was the sixth since Earth began and that a new collision was inevitable. Believers argued that the great flood described in the Bible and the destruction of Atlantis were caused by the fall of previous moons. H√∂rbiger had various responses to the criticism that he received. If it was pointed out to him that his assertions did not work mathematically, he responded: \\"Calculation can only lead you astray.\\" If it was pointed out that there existed photographic evidence that the Milky Way was composed of millions of stars, he responded that the pictures had been faked by \\"reactionary\\" astronomers. He responded in a similar way when it was pointed out that the surface temperature of the Moon had been measured in excess of 100 ¬∞C in the daytime, writing to rocket expert Willy Ley: \\"Either you believe in me and learn, or you will be treated as the enemy.\\" Astronomers generally dismissed his views and the following they acquired as a \\"carnival\\". As Martin Gardner in Chapter Three of his Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science, H√∂rbiger's ideas have much in common with those of Immanuel Velikovsky.

Goehr was born in Berlin in 1932, the son of the conductor and composer Walter Goehr, a pupil of Arnold Schoenberg. In his early twenties he emerged as a central figure in the Manchester School of post-war British composers. In 1955‚Äì56 he joined Olivier Messiaen's masterclass in Paris. Although in the early sixties Goehr was considered a leader of the avant- garde, his oblique attitude to modernism‚Äîand to any movement or school whatsoever‚Äîsoon became evident. In a sequence of works including the Piano Trio (1966), the opera Arden Must Die (1966), the music-theatre piece Triptych (1968‚Äì70), the orchestral Metamorphosis/Dance (1974), and the String Quartet No. 3 (1975‚Äì76), Goehr's personal voice was revealed, arising from a highly individual use of the serial method and a fusion of elements from his double heritage of Schoenberg and Messiaen. Since the luminous 'white-note' Psalm IV setting of 1976, Goehr has urged a return to more traditional ways of composing, using familiar materials as objects of musical speculation, in contrast to the technological priorities of much present-day musical research.from the profile of Alexander Goehr on the Cambridge University Music Faculty: http://www.mus.cam.ac.uk/directory/alexander-goehr Life and works =Youth and studies = Alexander Goehr was born on 10 August 1932 in Berlin, and his family moved to Britain when he was only a few months old. Alexander came from an extremely musical family: his mother Laelia was a classically trained pianist, and his father was a Schoenberg pupil and pioneering conductor of Schoenberg, Messiaen (he conducted the UK premiere of the Turangal√Æla Symphony in 1953) and Monteverdi. As a child, Alexander grew up in a household permanently populated by composers, including M√°ty√°s Seiber and Michael Tippett. Although these premises point all too clearly to Goehr's future as a composer, his efforts as a composer were not much encouraged by his father, and he initially intended to study classics at Oxford University, but went instead to study composition at the Royal Manchester College of Music, with Richard Hall. In his composition classes Goehr became friends with young composers Peter Maxwell Davies and Harrison Birtwistle and pianist John Ogdon, with whom he founded the New Music Manchester Group. A seminal event in Goehr's development was hearing the UK premiere of Messiaen's Turangal√Æla Symphony, conducted by his father. The interest in non-Western music (for instance Indian raga) sparked by the meeting with Messiaen's music combined with the interest in medieval modes shared with Peter Maxwell Davies and Harrison Birtwistle largely influenced Goehr's first musical imaginings. His first acknowledged compositions date from these years: Songs for Babel (1951) and the Sonata for Piano, Op. 2, which was dedicated to the memory of Prokofiev, who had died that year. In 1955, Goehr left Manchester to go to Paris and study with Messiaen, and he remained in Paris until October 1956. The music scene of Paris would make a great impression on Goehr, who became good friends with Pierre Boulez and was involved in the serialist avant-garde movement of those years. Goehr experimented with Boulez's technique of bloc sonore, particularly in his first String Quartet of 1956‚Äì57. Boulez was a sort of mentor to Goehr in the late fifties, programming his new compositions in his concerts at the Marigny Theatre in Paris. It was not meant to last. Eventually Goehr's sensibility parted from Boulez's serialism. What disturbed Goehr was mainly his perception that by the mid-fifties, serialism had become a cult of stylistic purity, modelling itself on the twelve-tone works of Anton Webern. Reference to any other music was forbidden and despised, and spontaneous choice replaced with the combinatorial laws of serialism: > Choice, taste and style were dirty words; personal style, one could argue, > is necessarily a product of repetition, and the removal of repetition is, or > was believed to be, a cornerstone of classical serialism as defined by > Webern's late works [...] All this may well be seen as a kind of negative > style precept: a conscious elimination of sensuous, dramatic or expressive > elements, indeed of everything that in the popular view constitutes > music.Alexander Goehr, \\"A Letter to Pierre Boulez\\", in Finding the Key: > Selected Writings of Alexander Goehr, edited by Derrick Puffett (London and > Boston: Faber and Faber, 1998), 5. = Return to the UK, 1956‚Äì76 = Upon his return to Britain, Goehr experienced a breakthrough as a composer with the performance of his cantata The Deluge in 1957 under his father's baton. This is a big, ambitious work inspired by the writings of Sergei Eisenstein‚Äîone of Goehr's many extra- musical sources of inspiration. The soundworld could be seen to have derived from the twelve-tone cantatas of Webern, but it implicitly strives for the imposing harmonic tautness and full sonority of Prokofiev's Eisenstein cantatas. The genre of the cantata is one that Goehr would explore over and over again throughout his career. Indeed, following the success of The Deluge, Goehr was commissioned a new cantata, Sutter's Gold for choir, baritone and orchestra. However, the new work proved highly unpopular particularly with the singers, who found it impossibly difficult to perform. Indeed, the difficulty of performance is one of the reasons why Sutter's Gold was dismissed by critics upon its performance at the Leeds festival in 1961. This d√©bacle, however, had a constructive impact on Goehr: rather than dismissing criticism as the mere result of incompetence on the part of critics and performers, he genuinely faced the questions of the position of the avant-garde composer and his music: > If one wishes, one can just say that music has to be autonomous and self > sufficient; but how to sustain such a view when people who sing for pleasure > are deprived of true satisfaction in the performance of new work? [...] We > can talk about music in terms of the ideas that inform it; we can talk about > structure and techniques; we can talk about aesthetics or ethics or > politics. But we have to remember that while all this, realistic or not, is > of great importance to composers and to anyone who likes to follow what > composers are doing, what is being discussed is not the music itself but the > location of the music, the place where it exists.Alexander Goehr, \\"A Letter > to Pierre Boulez\\", in Finding the Key: Selected Writings of Alexander Goehr > (London: Faber and Faber, 1998), 5. Despite this, Goehr continued to compose choral works. Encouraged by his friendship with the choral conductor John Alldis, who was strongly committed to new music, Goehr composed his Two Choruses in 1962, which used for the first time the combination of modality and serialism which was to remain his main technical resource for the next 14 years. His search for a model of serialism that could allow for expressive freedom led him to his famous Little Symphony, Op. 15 (1963). It is a memorial to Goehr's conductor/composer father, who had unexpectedly died, and it is based upon a chord-sequence subtly modelled upon (but not quoting) the \\"Catacombs\\" movement from Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition (Goehr senior had made a close harmonic analysis of this unusual movement).Alexander Goehr, \\"Finding the Key\\", in Finding the Key: Selected Writings of Alexander Goehr (London: Faber and Faber, 1998), 291‚Äì292. This flexible approach to serialism, integrating harmonic background with bloc sonore and modality is very representative of the type of writing that Goehr developed as an alternative to the strictures of total serialism. It is no coincidence that Boulez‚Äîwho had earlier facilitated the performance of Goehr's music‚Äîrefused to programme Little Symphony: by 1963 Goehr had neatly departed from the style of his Parisian days. The sixties saw Goehr founding the Wardour Castle Summer School in Wiltshire with Peter Maxwell Davies and Harrison Birtwistle in 1964, and most importantly, the beginning of Goehr's preoccupation with opera and music theatre. In 1966 he wrote his first opera, Arden Must Die (Arden Muss Sterben), a thoroughly Brechtian setting of a Jacobean morality play which had uncomfortably contemporary political and social resonances. Goehr's striking setting of a text composed by Erich Fried in rhyming duplets makes the most of the idea of simple musical ideas that are continually distorted to a sinister and sarcastic effect. In 1967 he founded the Music Theatre Ensemble, and in 1971 he completed a three-part cycle for music theatre‚ÄîTryptich‚Äîmade up of three works: Naboth's Vineyard (1968) and Shadowplay (1970) were both explicitly written for Music Theatre Ensemble while the later Sonata about Jerusalem (1971) was commissioned by Testimonium, Jerusalem and performed by the Israel Chamber Orchestra and Gary Bertini. The end of the sixties also saw the beginning of a string of prestigious academic appointments for Goehr. In 1968‚Äì9 he was composer-in-residence at the New England Conservatory of Music, Boston, and went on to teach at Yale University as an associate professor of music. Goehr returned to Britain as visiting lecturer at Southampton University (1970‚Äì71). In 1971 he was appointed West Riding Professor of Music at the University of Leeds. Goehr left Leeds in 1976 when he was appointed Professor of Music at Cambridge University where he taught until his retirement in 1999. In Cambridge he became fellow of Trinity Hall. = 1976‚Äì96 = The year of Goehr's appointment at Cambridge coincided with a turning point in his output. In 1976, Goehr wrote a 'white-note' setting of Psalm IV. The simple, bright modal sonority of this piece marked a final departure from post-war serialism and a commitment to a more transparent soundworld. Goehr found a way of controlling harmonic pace by fusing his own modal harmonic idiom with the long abandoned practice of figured bass‚Äîthus achieving a highly idiosyncratic fusion of past and present. The output of the ensuing twenty years testified to Goehr's desire to use this new idiom to explore ideas and genres that had already become constant features of his work, such as the exploration of symphonic form: Goehr returned to symphonic form in his Sinfonia (1979) and Symphony with Chaconne (1987). Yet these years' output is disseminated most notably with a great number of ambitious vocal scores. A common feature of many of the vocal compositions of these years is the choice of subjects that function as allegories for reflection upon socio-political themes. The Death of Moses (1992) uses Moses' angry refusal to die as an allegory for the destiny of the victims of the Holocaust; while the cantata Babylon the Great is Fallen (1979) and the opera Behold the Sun (1985)‚Äîfor which Babylon the Great can be considered to be a sketch study‚Äîboth explore the themes of violent revolution via the texts from the Anabaptist uprising in M√ºnster of 1543. There are also non-political works such as the Sing, Ariel, that recalls Messiaen's stylised birdsong and sets a kaleidoscope of English poetry, and the opera Arianna (1995)‚Äîwritten on a Rinuccini libretto for L'Arianna, a lost opera by Monteverdi‚Äîis a typically idiosyncratic exploration of the soundworld of Italian Renaissance. Indeed, Goehr's engagement with Monteverdi's music dates back to the cantata The Death of Moses, which he described as \\"Monteverdi heard through Var√®se\\".Alexander Goehr, Programme note for The Death of Moses, BBC Proms 1992, Sunday 2 August 1992, p. 8. Arianna is also the piece that most overtly displays Goehr's intent to turn his reinvention of the past into a musical process that the audience can hear and identify: > The impression I aim to create is one of transparency: the listener should > perceive, both in the successive and simultaneous dimensions of the score, > the old beneath the new and the new arising from the old. We are to see a > mythological and ancient action, interpreted by a 17th-century poet in a > modern theatre.Alexander Goehr, Programme note for Arianna, The Royal Opera > House September/October 1995. = 1996‚Äì2014 = Although the last fifteen years of Goehr's output have not received the generous coverage (both in terms of academic writing and frequency of performance) of his previous work, they arguably represent the most interesting of Goehr's compositional phases. This last decade's output is heralded by the striking opera Kantan and Damask Drum of 1999, premiered at the Dortmund Opera. This opera consists in fact of two plays from the Japanese Noh theatre tradition, separated by a short kyogen humorous interlude. Typically for Goehr, the Japanese texts date back to the 15th century and have been adapted by the composer for setting. The lusciously tonal idiom does not indulge in orientalism, but rather the relationship between music and drama in Noh animates the whole work. Again, with Kantan and Damask Drum the search continues for an expressive synthesis; in this case, it is one of western and eastern, past and present. In the following years, Goehr devoted himself almost exclusively to chamber music. This is perhaps a response to the difficulties he experienced in the staging of his operas: the limited amount of financial support needed for a chamber music performance allows for music and performance venues that stray off the beaten path while allowing the composer more control over the quality of the performance.Interview given on 3 November 2007 for the BBC Music Matters Series. Through the chamber music medium Goehr gains an unprecedented rhythmic and harmonic immediacy, while his music remains ever permeable by the music and imagery of other times and places: the Piano Quintet (2000) and the Fantasie for cello and piano (2005) are haunted by rich sonorities of a thoroughly Ravel-like quality. The set of piano pieces Symmetries Disorder Reach (2007) is a barely disguised baroque suite haunted by the spirit of early Berg. Marching to Carcassonne (2003) flirts with neoclassicism and Stravinsky, and Manere for violin and clarinet (2008), based on a fragment of medieval plainchant, is a typical foray into the art of musical ornament. Also written in 2008 is Since Brass nor Stone for string quartet and percussion (2008), a memorial to Pavel Haas. Inspired by a Shakespeare sonnet, from which it borrows its title, this work is representative of the inventiveness of Goehr's recent chamber work. One reviewer described the soundworld of the work as 'hiccupping fugal patterns overlaid with intricate, delicate percussion [...] a magical garden of dappled textures'.Geoff Brown, review of the premiere of Since Brass Nor Stone on 10 July 2008 in St Andrew Holborn, London; published in The Times, 16.07.08 After an almost ten-year hiatus from the operatic medium, Goehr returned to the form with Promised End (2008‚Äì09), first performed by English Touring Opera in 2010 and based on Shakespeare's King Lear.English Touring Opera's website In the same year came When Adam Fell, a BBC commission for orchestra based on the chromatic bass from the Bach chorale 'Durch Adam's Fall ist alles Verderbt', first introduced to Goehr by his teacher Olivier Messiaen. To These Dark Steps/The Fathers are Watching (2011‚Äì12), written for tenor, children's choir and ensemble, sets texts by Israeli poet Gabriel Levin concerning the bombing of Gaza during the Iraq war and was premiered in a concert marking Goehr's 80th birthday. Largo Siciliano (2012) is a trio praised for its mastery of aural balance between the unusual combination of violin, horn and piano, 'from opening crepuscular melancholy to an ending which just seems to vanish into oblivion.'Christopher Morley, review of the premiere of Largo Siciliano on 5 July 2012 as part of Cheltenham Music Festival; published in Birmingham Post, 13 July 2012 The chamber symphony ...between the lines... (2013), the latest commission in a long-standing relationship with Birmingham Contemporary Music Group, is a monothematic work of four movements played without a break, in direct acknowledgement of Arnold Schoenberg's own Chamber Symphony op. 9. In 2004 Goehr was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Plymouth University.  Musical style  = Eclecticism and synthesis = All of Goehr's works are, in one way or another, studies in the synthesis of several, different elements. This is already apparent in his breakthrough piece, The Deluge (1957‚Äì58), which is inspired by Eisenstein's notes for a film based on a writing by Leonardo da Vinci; in other words Goehr writes music about a director's notes for a film based on the writings of a painter! Similarly, his inspiration for new compositions have ranged from the formal proportions of a late Beethoven Piano Sonata (Metamorphosis/Dance, 1973-4) to a painting by Goya (Colossus or Panic, 1990), to the sinister humour of Bertolt Brecht (Arden Must Die, 1966) or to the Japanese Noh theatre (Kantan and Damask Drum, 1999).Robin Holloway, 'Alexander Goehr at 70', in: Latham, Alison (ed.). 2003. Sing, Ariel: Essays and Thoughts for Alexander Goehr's Seventieth Birthday. With compact disc. Aldershot, England; Burlington, VT: Ashgate, pp. 3‚Äì4 Another red-thread element of The Deluge is that it takes its cue from an unfinished project‚ÄîEisenstein never carried out this particular project. Goehr will return time and again to the idea of carrying out a synthesis of fragments or unfinished projects left by other artists, albeit in a metaphorical way: the cantata The Death of Moses resonates with Schoenberg's unfinished Moses und Aron; the opera Arianna (1995) is the setting of the libretto of a lost opera by Monteverdi; and the posthumously published prose fragments by Franz Kafka lurk behind Das Gesetz der Quadrille (1979), Sur terre en l'air (1997) and Schlussgesang (1990). From a strictly technical musical level, Goehr's endeavour has long been that of unifying the contrapuntal rigour and motivic workings of the First Viennese School and Second Viennese School with a strong sense of harmonic pacing and sonority. It is indicative that Goehr should go to Paris not only to attend the classes of Messiaen at the Paris Conservatoire, but also to study counterpoint and serialism with Schoenberg scholar and composer Max Deutsch; even more indicative is the anecdote that Deutsch threw Goehr out of his house upon hearing that the young man intended to study with Messiaen as well as with him. Goehr's indebtedness to Messiaen is very strong, as is apparent in Goehr's lifelong commitment to modality as an integration to both serialism and to tonality, as well as his often bird-song inspired melodic writing, particularly in the cantata Sing, Ariel. = Engagement with the past = Goehr's interest in the musical past is far from an empty mannerism or a sign of musical conservatism, but rather an earnest, and constantly renewed exploration of his own musical roots. The music of the past does not hinder, in Goehr's view, the search for an innovative musical language: > In the composer's mind, vague memories fuse and grow into a new, conscious, > creative idea. An artist is realated to the tradition from which he comes, > and this bond has little to do with time or progress.Alexander Goehr, \\"A > Letter to Pierre Boulez\\", in Finding the Key: Selected Writings of Alexander > Goehr (London: Faber and Faber, 1998), 21. This attitude is concisely expressed by Goehr's striking assertion that \\"all art is new and all art is conservative\\". Understood in this way, his musical imagination of the past can be traced to three fundamental sources:  Walter Goehr  Although Goehr's personal relationship to his father was not unproblematic, Walter Goehr had a determining influence on his son via his work as a conductor: the composers whose work Walter championed‚ÄîArnold Schoenberg, Claudio Monteverdi, Modest Mussorgsky, Olivier Messiaen‚Äîfeature as a red-thread throughout Alexander's output. For instance, Goehr's Arianna uses the libretto of a lost opera by Monteverdi, Arianna abbandonata, and conjures up sonorities reminiscent of the Italian Renaissance. The quintet Five Objects Darkly (whose title is borrowed from a work by the painter Giorgio Morandi is a set of variations based on a musical fragment by Mussorgsky,Williams, Nicholas. 2001. \\"Goehr (2): (Peter) Alexander Goehr\\". The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, ed. S. Sadie and J. Tyrrell. London: Macmillan. and the earlier Little Symphony uses the chordal structure of Mussorgsky's Catacombs' from Pictures at an Exhibition as a harmonic backbone.Alexander Goehr, 'Finding the Key' in Finding the Key: Selected Writings of Alexander Goehr(London: Faber and Faber, 1998), 291‚Äì292  Early twentieth-century modernist composers  Walter Goehr had studied with Schoenberg and was constantly surrounded by high calibre composers such as Seiber, Tippett, and others. Goehr's strong sense of indebtment to this generation, particularly to Schoenberg, had a lot to do with his ambivalent reaction to the Darmstadt School avant-garde of the fiftiesCf. 'I was originally attracted to serialism [...] But even as a student I felt a number of reservations. I couldn't share [Boulez's] attitude towards Webern [...]. Having been brought up in a very Schoenbergian household I preferred to see Webern's achievement as an extension of Schoenberg's ideals.'. Alexander Goehr, \\"A Letter to Pierre Boulez\\", in Finding the Key: Selected Writings of Alexander Goehr (London: Faber and Faber, 1998), (in which his friend and mentor Pierre Boulez was heavily involved).  Music of the baroque and classical tradition  Goehr's interest in these musics is surely part of his Schoenbergian heritage. Just like Schoenberg, Goehr refuses to view current composition as a practice that is independent of any musical tradition, but rather, he seeks in tradition the elements for the innovation of musical language. Alexander's search for a means of controlling structure and harmony in music led him in the late seventies to an innovating interpretation of the late baroque practice of figured bass in conjunction with his personal blend of modality and serialism. This is exemplified in his setting of Psalm IV and the ensuing correlated works: Fugue and Romanza on the notes of the fourth Psalm (1976 and 1977, respectively). Goehr is also committed to the reinvention of classical forms such as the Symphony, the classical Concerto, and the Baroque Suite (from his Suite Op. 11 of 1961 right up to Symmeteries Disorder Reach of 2007). Further sources of inspiration are the treatises on musical ornamentation by Carl Philip Emanuel Bach, and Monteverdi, whose synthesis of renaissance polyphony with the early baroque move towards homophony and the control of harmony clearly mirrors Goehr's own commitment to a harmonically expressive serialist practice.

Autoionizing states are usually short-lived, and thus can be described as Fano resonances rather than normal bound states. They can be observed as variations in the ionization cross sections of atoms and molecules, by photoionization, electron ionization and other methods. As examples, several Fano resonances in the extreme ultraviolet photoionization spectrum of neon are attributed to autoionizing states.Codling, K., Madden, R.P. and Ederer, D.L. (1967), Resonances in the Photoionization Continuum of Ne I (20-150 eV), Phys. Rev. 155, 26-37 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRev.155.26 Some are due to one-electron excitations, such as a series of three strong similarly shaped peaks at energies of 45.546, 47.121 and 47.692 eV which are interpreted as 1s2 2s1 2p6 np (1P) states for n = 3, 4 and 5. These states of neutral neon lie beyond the first ionization energy because it takes more energy to excite a 2s electron than to remove a 2p electron. When autoionization occurs, the np ‚Üí 2s de- excitation provides the energy needed to remove one 2p electron and form the Ne+ ground state. Other resonances are attributed to two-electron excitations. The same neon photoionization spectrum considered above contains a fourth strong resonance in the same region at 44.979 eV but with a very different shape, which is interpreted as the 1s2 2s2 2p4 3s 3p (1P) state. For autoionization, the 3s ‚Üí 2p transition provides the energy to remove the 3p electron. Electron ionization allows the observation of some states which cannot be excited by photons due to selection rules. In neon for example again, the excitation of triplet states is forbidden by the spin selection rule ŒîS = 0, but the 1s2 2s2 2p4 3s 3p (3P) has been observed by electron ionization at 42.04 eV.Bolduc, E., Qu√©m√©ner, J.J. and Marmet, P. (1972) Autoionizing 2s2 2p4 3s 3l States of Ne and Related Ne‚àí Resonances, J. Chem. Phys. 57, 1957-66 DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.1678515 If a core electron is missing, a positive ion can autoionize further and lose a second electron in the Auger effect. In neon, X-ray excitation can remove a 1s electron, producing an excited Ne+ ion with configuration 1s1 2s2 2p6. In the subsequent Auger process a 2s ‚Üí 1s transition and simultaneous emission of a second electron from 2p leads to the Ne2+ 1s2 2s1 2p5 ionic state. Molecules, in addition, can have vibrationally autoionizing Rydberg states, in which the small amount of energy necessary to ionize a Rydberg state is provided by vibrational excitation.

It succeeded the Resettlement Administration (1935‚Äì1937). The FSA is famous for its small but highly influential photography program, 1935‚Äì44, that portrayed the challenges of rural poverty. The photographs in the FSA/Office of War Information Photograph Collection form an extensive pictorial record of American life between 1935 and 1944. This U.S. government photography project was headed for most of its existence by Roy Stryker, who guided the effort in a succession of government agencies: the Resettlement Administration (1935‚Äì1937), the Farm Security Administration (1937‚Äì1942), and the Office of War Information (1942‚Äì1944). The collection also includes photographs acquired from other governmental and nongovernmental sources, including the News Bureau at the Offices of Emergency Management (OEM), various branches of the military, and industrial corporations. In total, the black-and-white portion of the collection consists of about 175,000 black-and-white film negatives, encompassing both negatives that were printed for FSA-OWI use and those that were not printed at the time. Color transparencies also made by the FSA/OWI are available in a separate section of the catalog: FSA/OWI Color Photographs. The FSA stressed \\"rural rehabilitation\\" efforts to improve the lifestyle of very poor landowning farmers, and a program to purchase submarginal land owned by poor farmers and resettle them in group farms on land more suitable for efficient farming. Reactionary critics, including the Farm Bureau, strongly opposed the FSA as an alleged experiment in collectivizing agriculture‚Äîthat is, in bringing farmers together to work on large government-owned farms using modern techniques under the supervision of experts. After the Conservative coalition took control of Congress, it transformed the FSA into a program to help poor farmers buy land, and that program continues to operate in the 21st century as the Farmers Home Administration. Origins Walker Evans portrait of Allie Mae Burroughs (1936) The projects that were combined in 1935 to form the Resettlement Administration (RA) started in 1933 as an assortment of programs tried out by the Federal Emergency Relief Administration. The RA was headed by Rexford Tugwell, an economic advisor to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. However, Tugwell's goal moving 650,000 people into of exhausted, worn-out land was unpopular among the majority in Congress. This goal seemed socialistic to some and threatened to deprive powerful farm proprietors of their tenant workforce. The RA was thus left with only enough resources to relocate a few thousand people from and build several greenbelt cities, which planners admired as models for a cooperative future that never arrived. The main focus of the RA was to now build relief camps in California for migratory workers, especially refugees from the drought-stricken Dust Bowl of the Southwest. This move was resisted by a large share of Californians, who did not want destitute migrants to settle in their midst. The RA managed to construct 95 camps that gave migrants unaccustomed clean quarters with running water and other amenities, but the 75,000 people who had the benefit of these camps were a small share of those in need and could only stay temporarily. After facing enormous criticism for his poor management of the RA, Tugwell resigned in 1936. On January 1, 1937, with hopes of making the RA more effective, the RA was transferred to the Department of Agriculture through executive order 7530. On July 22, 1937, Congress passed the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act. This law authorized a modest credit program to assist tenant farmers to purchase land, and it was the culmination of a long effort to secure legislation for their benefit. Following the passage of the act, Congress passed the Farm Security Act into law. The Farm Security Act officially transformed the RA into the Farm Security Administration (FSA). The FSA expanded through funds given by the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act. Relief work One of the activities performed by the RA and FSA was the buying out of small farms that were not economically viable, and the setting up of 34 subsistence homestead communities, in which groups of farmers lived together under the guidance of government experts and worked a common area. They were not allowed to purchase their farms for fear that they would fall back into inefficient practices not guided by RA and FSA experts.Baldwin 1968 The Dust Bowl in the Great Plains displaced thousands of tenant farmers, sharecroppers, and laborers, many of whom (known as \\"Okies\\" or \\"Arkies\\") moved on to California. The FSA operated camps for them, such as Weedpatch Camp as depicted in The Grapes of Wrath. The RA and the FSA gave educational aid to 455,000 farm families during the period 1936-1943. In June, 1936, Roosevelt wrote: \\"You are right about the farmers who suffer through their own fault... I wish you would have a talk with Tugwell about what he is doing to educate this type of farmer to become self-sustaining. During the past year, his organization has made 104,000 farm families practically self-sustaining by supervision and education along practical lines. That is a pretty good record!\\"Sternsher 272 The FSA's primary mission was not to aid farm production or prices. Roosevelt's agricultural policy had, in fact, been to try to decrease agricultural production to increase prices. When production was discouraged, though, the tenant farmers and small holders suffered most by not being able to ship enough to market to pay rents. Many renters wanted money to buy farms, but the Agriculture Department realized there already were too many farmers, and did not have a program for farm purchases. Instead, they used education to help the poor stretch their money further. Congress, however, demanded that the FSA help tenant farmers purchase farms, and purchase loans of $191 million were made, which were eventually repaid. A much larger program was $778 million in loans (at effective rates of about 1% interest) to 950,000 tenant farmers. The goal was to make the farmer more efficient so the loans were used for new machinery, trucks, or animals, or to repay old debts. At all times, the borrower was closely advised by a government agent. Family needs were on the agenda, as the FSA set up a health insurance program and taught farm wives how to cook and raise children. Upward of a third of the amount was never repaid, as the tenants moved to much better opportunities in the cities.Meriam pp. 290‚Äì312 The FSA was also one of the authorities administering relief efforts in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico during the Great Depression. Between 1938 and 1945, under the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration, it oversaw the purchase of 590 farms with the intent of distributing land to working and middle-class Puerto Ricans. =Modernization= The FSA resettlement communities appear in the literature as efforts to ameliorate the wretched condition of southern sharecroppers and tenants, but those evicted to make way for the new settlers are virtually invisible in the historic record. The resettlement projects were part of larger efforts to modernize rural America. The removal of former tenants and their replacement by FSA clients in the lower Mississippi alluvial plain‚Äîthe Delta‚Äîreveals core elements of New Deal modernizing policies. The key concepts that guided the FSA's tenant removals were: the definition of rural poverty as rooted in the problem of tenancy; the belief that economic success entailed particular cultural practices and social forms; and the commitment by those with political power to gain local support. These assumptions undergirded acceptance of racial segregation and the criteria used to select new settlers. Alternatives could only become visible through political or legal action‚Äîcapacities sharecroppers seldom had. In succeeding decades, though, these modernizing assumptions created conditions for Delta African Americans on resettlement projects to challenge white supremacy.Jane Adams and D. Gorton, \\"This Land Ain't My Land: The Eviction of Sharecroppers by the Farm Security Administration,\\" Agricultural History Summer 2009, Vol. 83 Issue 3, pp. 323‚Äì51 =FSA and its contribution to society= The documentary photography genre describes photographs that would work as a time capsule for evidence in the future or a certain method that a person can use for a frame of reference. Facts presented in a photograph can speak for themselves after the viewer gets time to analyze it. The motto of the FSA was simply, as Beaumont Newhall insists, \\"not to inform us, but to move us.\\" Those photographers wanted the government to move and give a hand to the people, as they were completely neglected and overlooked, thus they decided to start taking photographs in a style that we today call \\"documentary photography.\\" The FSA photography has been influential due to its realist point of view, and because it works as a frame of reference and an educational tool from which later generations could learn. Society has benefited and will benefit from it for more years to come, as this photography can unveil the ambiguous and question the conditions that are taking place.Bill Ganzel, \\"FSA photography,\\" Farming in the 1930s (2003): 1‚Äì3. =Photography program= The RA and FSA are well known for the influence of their photography program, 1935‚Äì1944. Photographers and writers were hired to report and document the plight of poor farmers. The Information Division (ID) of the FSA was responsible for providing educational materials and press information to the public. Under Roy Stryker, the ID of the FSA adopted a goal of \\"introducing America to Americans.\\" Many of the most famous Depression-era photographers were fostered by the FSA project. Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, and Gordon Parks were three of the most famous FSA alumni. The FSA was also cited in Gordon Parks' autobiographical novel, A Choice of Weapons. =Photographers= Eleven photographers came to work on this project (listed in order in which they were hired): Arthur Rothstein, Theo Jung, Ben Shahn, Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, Carl Mydans, Russell Lee, Marion Post Wolcott, Jack Delano, John Vachon, and John Collier.

The photographers produced images that breathed a humanistic social visual catalyst of the sort found in novels, theatrical productions, and music of the time. Their images are now regarded as a \\"national treasure\\" in the United States, which is why this project is regarded as a work of art. Chicago's rail yards by Jack Delano, circa 1943 Together with John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath (not a government project) and documentary prose (for example Walker Evans and James Agee's Let Us Now Praise Famous Men), the FSA photography project is most responsible for creating the image of the Depression in the United States. Many of the images appeared in popular magazines. The photographers were under instruction from Washington, DC, as to what overall impression the New Deal wanted to portray. Stryker's agenda focused on his faith in social engineering, the poor conditions among tenant cotton farmers, and the very poor conditions among migrant farm workers; above all, he was committed to social reform through New Deal intervention in people's lives. Stryker demanded photographs that \\"related people to the land and vice versa\\" because these photographs reinforced the RA's position that poverty could be controlled by \\"changing land practices.\\" Though Stryker did not dictate to his photographers how they should compose the shots, he did send them lists of desirable themes, for example, \\"church\\", \\"court day\\", and \\"barns\\". Stryker sought photographs of migratory workers that would tell a story about how they lived day-to-day. He asked Dorothea Lange to emphasize cooking, sleeping, praying, and socializing.Finnegan 43‚Äì44 RA-FSA made 250,000 images of rural poverty. Fewer than half of those images survive and are housed in the Prints and Photographs Division of the Library of Congress. The library has placed all 164,000 developed negatives online. From these, some 77,000 different finished photographic prints were originally made for the press, plus 644 color images, from 1600 negatives. Documentary films The RA also funded two documentary films by Pare Lorentz: The Plow That Broke the Plains, about the creation of the Dust Bowl, and The River, about the importance of the Mississippi River. The films were deemed \\"culturally significant\\" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. World War II activities During World War II, the FSA was assigned to work under the purview of the Wartime Civil Control Administration, a subagency of the War Relocation Authority. These agencies were responsible for relocating Japanese Americans from their homes on the West Coast to Internment camps. The FSA controlled the agricultural part of the evacuation. Starting in March 1942 they were responsible for transferring the farms owned and operated by Japanese Americans to alternate operators. They were given the dual mandate of ensuring fair compensation for Japanese Americans, and for maintaining correct use of the agricultural land. During this period, Lawrence Hewes Jr was the regional director and in charge of these activities.Laurence I. Hewes, Final Report of the Participation of the Farm Security Administration in the Evacuation Program of the Wartime Civil Control Administration Civil Affairs Division Western Defense Command and Fourth Army, Farm Security Administration, United States Department of Agriculture, (San Francisco: 1942) Reformers ousted; Farmers Home Administration After the war started and millions of factory jobs in the cities were unfilled, no need for FSA remained. In late 1942, Roosevelt moved the housing programs to the National Housing Agency, and in 1943, Congress greatly reduced FSA's activities. The photographic unit was subsumed by the Office of War Information for one year, then disbanded. Finally in 1946, all the social reformers had left and FSA was replaced by a new agency, the Farmers Home Administration, which had the goal of helping finance farm purchases by tenants‚Äîand especially by war veterans‚Äîwith no personal oversight by experts. It became part of Lyndon Johnson's war on poverty in the 1960s, with a greatly expanded budget to facilitate loans to low-income rural families and cooperatives, injecting $4.2 billion into rural America.Baldwin 403 The Great Depression The Great Depression began in August 1929, when the United States economy first went into an economic recession. Although the country spent two months with declining GDP, the effects of a declining economy were not felt until the Wall Street Crash in October 1929, and a major worldwide economic downturn ensued. Although its causes are still uncertain and controversial, the net effect was a sudden and general loss of confidence in the economic future and a reduction in living standards for most ordinary Americans. The market crash highlighted a decade of high unemployment, poverty, low profits for industrial firms, deflation, plunging farm incomes, and lost opportunities for economic growth.

Biography Goehr was born in Berlin, where he studied with Arnold Schoenberg and embarked on a conducting career, before being forced as a Jew to seek employment outside Germany after working for Berlin Radio in 1932. He was invited to become music director for the Gramophone Company (later EMI), so he moved to London. In 1937, he conducted the London Philharmonic Orchestra in the premiere recording of Bizet's Symphony in C.CHARM (Centre for the History and Analysis of Recorded Music). In London at Studio No. 1, Abbey Road for HMV, on 26 November 1937. During his years as a staff conductor for EMI, he conducted the orchestra for many recordings, including accompaniments for arias sung by Beniamino Gigli, Richard Tauber and Joseph Schmidt. In more popular items, his name appears on the record labels as 'G. Walter' or 'George Walter'. In addition, he conducted for many concerto recordings, including some by Benno Moiseiwitsch, Myra Hess and others. After the war he conducted for several smaller recording companies based in Europe, including for the concerto recordings of the short-lived Australian pianist Noel Mewton-Wood. As well as teaching composition in Britain he also instructed pupils in conducting, one of whom was the young Wally Stott, later known as Angela Morley. In England he worked for the Columbia Record Company, and between 1945 and 1948 was conductor of the BBC Theatre Orchestra (the predecessor of today's BBC Concert Orchestra); he was also a skilled arranger. He was one of many musicians of European origin and training recruited by Michael Tippett for the staff of Morley College. Goehr conducted many important premieres at Morley, including the first British performance of Monteverdi's Vespro della Beata Vergine of 1610. His first successful composition was Malpopita in 1931, an opera especially designed for radio broadcast. This work was not scheduled for its first live performance until 6 May 2004, in Berlin, Prenzlauer Berg, Abspannwerk Humboldt. In 1942, he made a new arrangement of Mussorgsky's piano suite Pictures at an Exhibition with a subsidiary piano part. In 1946, he arranged a number of Mussorgsky's piano pieces into the orchestral suite Pictures from the Crimea. In 1947, Goehr composed the music for the much acclaimed film Great Expectations, directed by David Lean. He wrote several other film scores. He was also well known for conducting film soundtracks, including A Canterbury Tale, for which his friend Allan Gray had composed the score.

The fraternity has over 225 chapters and colonies across the United States and abroad with over 15,500 undergraduate members over 300,000 lifetime initiates. The fraternity's vision statement is \\"To set the standard of integrity, intellect, achievement for our members, host institutions, and the communities in which we live.\\" History Georgia Institute of Technology Pi Kappa Alpha was founded on March 1, 1868, at 47 West Range (The Range) at the University of Virginia by six graduate students: Robertson Howard, Julian Edward Wood, James Benjamin Sclater Jr., Frederick Southgate Taylor, Littleton Waller Tazewell (Bradford) and William Alexander. On March 1, 1869, exactly one year after the Alpha chapter at the University of Virginia was formed, the Beta chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha was founded at Davidson College. Theta chapter, at Rhodes College, took over the responsibilities of Alpha chapter when the Fraternity was in decline in its infancy. John Shaw Foster, a junior founder from Theta chapter, helped to reestablish Alpha chapter at the University of Virginia. Theta chapter is the longest continual running chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha, having been founded in 1878. After almost a decade of decline, Pi Kappa Alpha was \\"re-founded\\" as part of the Hampden‚ÄìSydney Convention, held in a dorm room at Hampden‚ÄìSydney College. The four delegates to the Hampden‚ÄìSydney Convention are referred to as the Junior Founders. Pi Kappa Alpha was not originally organized as a sectional fraternity; however, by constitutional provision it became so in 1889. It remained a southern fraternity until the New Orleans Convention in 1909 when Pi Kappa Alpha officially declared itself a national organization. Like many other social fraternities at the time, Pi Kappa Alpha limited its membership to white men. The race restriction was removed in 1964. Rituals Its rituals are based on Independent Order of Odd Fellows. Shield & Diamond Shield & Diamond is the official quarterly publication of Pi Kappa Alpha. It was first printed in December 1890 by Robert Adger Smythe, the then Grand Secretary and Treasurer, under the name The Pi Kappa Alpha Journal. The name was changed to Shield & Diamond in 1891. Foundation and educational programs =Pike University= Pike University is the name used for all of the fraternity's leadership programs. The program is administered by the fraternity's professional staff. Founded in 1948 as a 501(c)(3) tax exempt organization for charitable, literary & educational purposes. Events held by the university include International Convention, the Academy, the Chapter Executives Conference, and several regional Leadership Summits. Pike University grants more than $100,000 in scholarships each year. =The Pike Foundation= In 1948, Pi Kappa Alpha established and chartered the \\"Pi Kappa Alpha Memorial Foundation\\" as a 501(c)(3) organization. The foundation grants $350,000 in scholarships and grants to undergraduate members each year. It also provides funding to the fraternity and its chapters for leadership programs, scholarships, and chapter house facilities. The foundation grants initiation fee scholarships to undergraduates inducted into Phi Beta Kappa, Omicron Delta Kappa, Order of Omega, Phi Kappa Phi, and Tau Beta Pi honoraries. The Pike Foundation also maintains and operates the Memorial Headquarters in Memphis, Tennessee. This facility houses professional staffs, the Harvey T. Newell Library, and the Freeman Hart Museum. The building is a war memorial built in 1988 to recognize the military services of members who died in the line of duty. A Gold Star Memorial was dedicated on August 1, 2008. Some controversies and sexual assault cases In 1976, Samuel Mark Click, a pledge at Texas Tech University, was killed participating in a scavenger hunt as part of a hazing event. He was trying to collect a letter that was under a railroad tie when he was hit by a train. In 1988, three Pi Kappa Alpha members at Florida State University were charged in the sexual battery of a freshman female student. The victim was left in the hallway of another fraternity house. The case made national headlines for weeks. The fraternity members all struck plea deals, and the fraternity was banned from the school for twelve years. Pi Kappa Alpha was allowed to return to the school in 2000 despite strong protests. In 1988, several members of Pi Kappa Alpha were arrested for a sexual assault that took place at Stetson University. In 2002, Albert Santos, a pledge at the University of Nevada at Reno, drowned in a lake participating in a hazing ritual. He and several pledges were told to swim in a lake in their underwear but Santos could not swim. The fraternity was banned from the campus after his death. Santos' family sued the university and fraternity for negligence. In 2007, the chapter at the University of Central Florida was shut down after the fraternity racked up more than 20 misconduct and hazing violations. In 2008, 10 Pike members were arrested at Tulane University for pouring boiling hot water on pledges. The chapter was also accused of drugging and sexually assaulting several female students at the fraternity's annual bacchanal. Florida International University suspended the fraternity in 2013 after the discovery of photos on Facebook of hazing and drug deals, as well as sexually explicit photos of women taken without their consent. The UNC-Charlotte chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha was suspended after student placed in IC for alcohol-related hazing in 2013. In 2014 a county judge dismissed charges against three members, and found the fourth not guilty. The university found the fraternity guilty of hazing, and suspended its charter for eight years. In 2010, the chapter at Cornell University was placed on suspension for four years ‚Äúdue to its history of alcohol and hazing-related infractions over several years, which culminated in a Jan. 22, 2010, incident involving underage and high-risk drinking,‚Äù according to the Cornell Chronicle. The chapter was suspended again in March 2017 for violating university rules. In October 2012, the fraternity was suspended at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville following the hospitalization of a member for alcohol poisoning due to alleged \\"butt- chugging\\". In 2012, Pi Kappa Alpha pledge David Bogenberger died of a cardiac arrhythmia triggered by alcohol poisoning. According to police, Bogenberger and other pledges at an unsanctioned Northern Illinois University event were pressured into drinking large quantities of alcohol in a two-hour time. Bogenberger and 18 other pledges drank to unconsciousness. Five fraternity officers and 17 other members were convicted of misdemeanors in one of the largest hazing prosecutions in U.S. history. The chapter was suspended by the fraternity. In 2014, the leaders of the fraternity's University of Arkansas chapter were asked to resign following an unauthorized Martin Luther King, Jr. Day party that incorporated racist stereotypes. In 2014, the fraternity lost its charter at the University of Southern Mississippi following a hazing incident that led to the death of two mated flamingos. Pledges stole a flamingo from the local zoo, and in the struggle to defend its mate to her dying breath, the male was killed. The next morning, after being left on a bicycle path, the other died.Southern Mississippi fraternity rush prank goes awry, flamingo dies In 2018, the fraternity was allowed to return to the school. In April 2014, the fraternity lost its charter at the University of Virginia due to hazing pledges, however the school and the national fraternity agreed to let the chapter return for fall 2014 under an agreement that moved most Juniors and Seniors to early Alumni status and appointed a board of local fraternity alumni to oversee the group. In 2015, the former fraternity chapter president at Utah State University was charged with forcible sexual abuse, a felony, after allegedly inappropriately touching a female fellow student passed out at a party. In 2015, one member and four pledges of Pi Kappa Alpha from the University of Mississippi were arrested and charged with assault for leaving a Sigma Pi fraternity member with a concussion, broken ear drum, and broken teeth after a violent beating. The Pi Kappa Alpha member and pledges were trying to steal a donkey statue from the Sigma Pi house as part of a fraternity initiation task before the fight. The students involved were dismissed/expelled from the fraternity. In March 2015, the chapter at the University of South Carolina was suspended after a Pike member was found dead in a private home near campus that had beer kegs and St. Patrick Day decorations on the porch. The Richland County Coroner's Office called it a \\"suspicious death\\". In November 2016, the chapter at Louisiana State University placed itself voluntary suspension after a woman reported to authorities she was a victim of sexual battery by an unidentified white man in the backyard of the fraternity house during a \\"PIKE's Peak\\" party. However, the school's investigation of the chapter was closed in early December due to insufficient evidence and lack of contact with the victim. In March 2017, a Harris County Grand Jury indicted the University of Houston chapter for extreme hazing. Their pledges were severely deprived from adequate water, food, and sleep, and one was body slammed resulting in a lacerated spleen. The chapter was placed under suspension until 2023 and given a $10,000 fine. In May 2017, the chapter at California State University, Chico was charged with illegally cutting down 32 trees in the Lassen National Forest during an initiation of new pledges. They were also charged with possession of a firearm and conspiracy to commit offense or defraud the United States. The chapter was placed on suspension pending the outcome of the federal investigation. In October 2017, the chapter was sentenced to 9,800 hours of community service and a $4,000 fine after pleading guilty to cutting down and damaging trees in the Lassen National Forest by the U.S. District Court. On October 2, 2017 the chapter at Kennesaw State University was issued a cease and desist order by the university administration for repeatedly violating the student codes of conduct. In September 2017, the chapter at Iowa State University was suspended for misuse of alcoholic beverages, and for failure to appear at a university adjudication. The suspension was lifted on August 20, 2018. The chapter was placed on social probation for one year immediately after being lifted from suspension. In the fall of 2017, the chapter at University of Massachusetts Amherst was indefinitely suspended for hazing allegations. Members of the chapter were procuring alcohol for a minor during a hazing ritual which led to hospitalization due to alcohol poisoning.https://www.gazettenet.com/National- organization-suspends-UMass-fraternity-20411933 In March 2018, the chapter at Southern Methodist University was suspended for four and a half years for hazing pledges that included forcing them to drink alcohol, and forcing them to eat foods like onions and habanero peppers and drink milk.

The first game, Ridge Racer (1993), was originally released in arcades for the Namco System 22 hardware, later ported to the PlayStation two years later as a launch title. It was met with several sequels and spin-off games for multiple platforms, the latest being the iOS game Ridge Racer Draw & Drift (2016). Gameplay involves the player racing against computer-controlled opponents to be the first to finish in a race. Drifting is a core aspect of the series, and is used to keep speed while turning corners. Ridge Racer is a spiritual successor to Sim Drive (1992), a racing simulation game met with a limited release in Japanese arcades. Originally meant as an F-1 racing game, similar to Namco's own Pole Position and Final Lap series, it was instead replaced with racing on mountain roads, a popular trend for Japanese car enthusiasts at the time. The PlayStation version was a launch title for the console and an astounding success for Namco, prompting the creation of several sequels for arcades and home platforms. After Namco merged with Bandai in 2005, the series would become exclusive to consoles and later mobile phones. Several games in the franchise were released as launch titles for consoles. Earlier Ridge Racer games received critical acclaim for their graphics, gameplay and musical score, many citing it as a contributing factor to the success of the PlayStation in its early years. Later entries were criticized for straying too far from the source material and lack of content, with Ridge Racer Vita (2011) being listed among the worst video games ever made. The series is considered influential to the racing game genre. Games * Ridge Racer (1993) is the first entry in the series, originally released for arcades and running on the Namco System 22 arcade system. A PlayStation conversion was released in 1994 and 1995 as a launch title for the console. Two other versions of the game were released for arcades: Ridge Racer Full Scale, which featured a replica Eunos Roadster that the player sat in to control the game, and Ridge Racer: 3-Screen Edition, which used three different monitors to provide a peripheral vision effect, similar to Namco's earlier game Driver's Eyes (1991). A Japanese mobile phone version was released in 2000. * Ridge Racer 2 (1994) was released for arcades, running on the Namco System 22 hardware. It serves as an update to the original game, featuring multiplayer, a rear-view mirror, and a remixed soundtrack composed by Shinji Hosoe. * Rave Racer (1995) was released for arcades. It features two new tracks alongside the two present in the original Ridge Racer, and had linkable arcade cabinets that allowed for up to eight-person multiplayer. Home conversions for both the PlayStation and Microsoft Windows were announced in 1996, but were later cancelled. * Ridge Racer Revolution (1995) was released for the PlayStation. It is a modified home release of Ridge Racer 2 with three completely new and different tracks than the arcade and original games, new music, additional vehicles and multiplayer via the PlayStation Link Cable peripheral. * Rage Racer (1996) was released for the PlayStation. Alongside the introduction of series mascot Reiko Nagase, it featured customizable cars and a retries rule, both of which have become prominent throughout the franchise. It also features a more gritter and darker graphical style, a departure from the series' more colorful art style. * Pocket Racer (1996) is a spin-off arcade game released exclusively in Japan. Gameplay is near identical to the original Ridge Racer, however all the cars have instead been replaced with \\"super-deformed\\" Choro-Q- esc vehicles. A similar concept was included with Ridge Racer Revolution, titled Buggy Mode, which served as the inspiration for Pocket Racer. * R4: Ridge Racer Type 4 (1998) was released for the PlayStation, titled Ridge Racer Type 4 in Europe. It marks the debut of racing teams, which became a core aspect for all games to follow, and is the first in the series to use Gouraud shading for its graphics. Multiplayer modes are also present, being displayed in a split-screen orientation. In 2018, it was released as one of the built-in games on the PlayStation Classic mini console. * Ridge Racer 64 (2000) was released for the Nintendo 64 in North America and Europe; it was not developed by Namco, but by Nintendo Software Technology. It includes tracks from Ridge Racer and Ridge Racer Revolution, alongside new tracks and cars. * Ridge Racer V (2000) was released as a launch title for the PlayStation 2. An arcade version was released a year later, subtitled Arcade Battle. The original Ridge Racer game's free-form structure is instead replaced with Grand Prix races found in Ridge Racer Type 4. * R: Racing Evolution (2003) was released for the GameCube, PlayStation 2 and Xbox, serving as a spin-off of the franchise.

Common elements Gameplay of Ridge Racer (1994) The basic gameplay of the Ridge Racer series has remained relatively consistent throughout each installment. The objective is to race against computer-controlled opponents to finish each track in first place ‚Äî the player begins the game in last place, and have a limited number of laps around the track to complete where they can overtake opponents. Some entries have a time limit that the player must race against, with each completed lap extending the timer; if the timer reaches zero, the game ends regardless of which lap the player was on. Later entries remove the timer and instead requires the player to finish the race in a minimum-assigned place to advance to the next course. Unlike other racing games, which usually feature closed circuits, Ridge Racer instead has races laid out on streets, beaches, cities and mountains, taking place in the fictional coastal metropolis \\"Ridge City\\" ‚Äî circuit tracks are included in some entries. Nearly every entry in the series features the original tracks from Ridge Racer and Ridge Racer 2, sometimes modified to accompany for certain mechanics. Players can drift their car around corners to maintain speed, as most of the tracks were based on real-world locations that were not intended for race speeds. Ridge Racer Unbounded (2012) removes the drifting mechanic in favor of vehicular combat, similar to the Burnout franchise. The playable cars each have their own stats and mechanics, such as a faster speed or improved drifting. Many of these are also named after older Namco video games, including Dig Dug, Xevious, NebulasRay, Rolling Thunder, Bosconian and Solvalou. The PlayStation sequel R4: Ridge Racer Type 4 introduces the concept of racing teams for the series, all being named after Dig Dug, Mappy, Pac-Man, Xevious and Galaga. Similar to Namco's own Tekken series, several games feature classic Namco arcade games as short minigames that play during loading screens, a mechanic that was later trademarked by Namco ‚Äî the PlayStation home port of the original Ridge Racer features Galaxian, while Ridge Racers features New Rally-X. Completing these minigames will award the player with new tracks or cars, sometimes unlocking a full emulated version of the minigame to play. Reception The original Ridge Racer was very well received by critics for its 3D graphics, audio, and the drifting mechanics. It also received an admirable port to the PlayStation, where it became one of the best selling titles in the console's early lifetime. It is also considered as playing a part in giving Sony's system an edge over rival Sega's Saturn during 1994‚Äì1995. Its sequels during the 1990s were also highly successful, in particular Ridge Racer Type 4, often considered the series' best. Its sequel Ridge Racer V received more mediocre reviews, but the subsequent PSP title achieved very high praise. The series' 'idol' mascot Reiko Nagase, who has appeared in most games since 1995's Rave Racer, has often been rated among the most recognizable female characters in video games. In 1999, Next Generation listed the Ridge Racer series as number 11 on their \\"Top 50 Games of All Time\\", commenting that, \\"There are certainly better car simulations, but when it comes to fun, Ridge Racer, the game that helped make PlayStation cool, is the one we come back to.\\" 2006's Ridge Racer 7 is considered to have been the series' peak before declining in popularity - the Vita title was negatively received for various reasons, whilst the latest console game, Ridge Racer Unbounded, was marked with a departure from the drifting style and mechanics of what the series is known for, experimenting with a more destructive style similar to the Burnout series. The game was never as popular as its previous main titles and never had a Japanese release either.

Soda straw. A soda straw (or simply straw) is a speleothem in the form of a hollow mineral cylindrical tube. They are also known as tubular stalactites. Soda straws grow in places where water leaches slowly through cracks in rock, such as on the roofs of caves. Soda straws in caves rarely grow more than a few millimetres per year and may average one tenth of a millimetre per year.Hill, C A, and Forti, P, (1997). \\"Speleothem Growth Rates\\", Cave Minerals of the World, (2nd edition). [Huntsville, Alabama: National Speleological Society Inc.] pp 285 - 287 A soda straw can turn into a stalactite if the hole at the bottom is blocked, or if the water begins flowing on the outside surface of the hollow tube. Soda straws can also form outside the cave environment on exposed concrete surfaces as a type of calthemite, growing significantly faster than those formed on rock.  Formation  These tubes form when calcium carbonate or calcium sulfate dissolved in the water comes out of solution and is deposited. In soda straws, as each drop hovers at the tip, it deposits a ring of mineral at its edge. It then falls and a new drop takes its place. Each successive drop of water deposits a little more mineral before falling, and eventually a tube is built up. Stalagmites or flowstone may form where the water drops hit the cave floor. Soda straws are some of the most fragile of speleothems. Like helictites, they can be easily crushed or broken by the slightest touch. Because of this, soda straws are rarely seen within arms' reach in show caves or others with unrestricted access. Kartchner Caverns in southern Arizona has well-preserved soda straws because of its recent discovery in 1974 and highly regulated traffic. Outside the cave environment Straws can also form beneath man-made structures and grow significantly faster than in the natural cave environment.Hill, C A, and Forti, P, (1997).

In science fiction circles, however, it is commonly known to mean the hardware or machine parts implanted in the human body and acting as an interface between the central nervous system and the computers or machinery connected to it. More formally: :Cyberware is technology that attempts to create a working interface between machines/computers and the human nervous system, including the brain. Examples of potential cyberware cover a wide range, but current research tends to approach the field from one of two different angles: interfaces or prosthetics. Interfaces (\\"Headware\\") thumb The first variety attempts to connect directly with the brain.Fromherz, Peter; \\"Neuroelectronic Interfacing: Semiconductor Chips with Ion Channels, Nerve Cells, and Brain\\"; Nanoelectronics and Information Technology, pp. 781‚Äì810, Editor R. Waser, Wiley-VCH, Berlin, 2003 The data-jack is probably the best-known, having heavily featured in works of fiction (even in mainstream productions such as Johnny Mnemonic, the cartoon Exosquad, and The Matrix). It is the most difficult object to implement, but it is also the most important in terms of interfacing directly with the mind.Hooper, Simon (October 21, 2004) Brain chip offers hope for paralyzed CNN In science fiction the data-jack is the envisioned I/O port for the brain. Its job is to translate thoughts into something meaningful to a computer, and to translate something from a computer into meaningful thoughts for humans. Once perfected, it would allow direct communication between computers and the human mind. Large university laboratories conduct most of the experiments done in the area of direct neural interfaces. For ethical reasons, the tests are usually performed on animals or slices of brain tissue from donor brains. The mainstream research focuses on electrical impulse monitoring, recording and translating the many different electrical signals that the brain transmits. A number of companies are working on what is essentially a \\"hands-free\\" mouse or keyboard.Lusted, HS and Knapp, \\"RB Controlling Computers with Neural Signals\\". Scientific American, October 1996 This technology uses these brain signals to control computer functions. These interfaces are sometimes called brain-machine interfaces (BMI). The more intense research, concerning full in-brain interfaces, is being studied, but is in its infancy. Few can afford the huge cost of such enterprises, and those who can find the work slow-going and very far from the ultimate goals. Research has reached the level where limited control over a computer is possible using thought commands alone. After being implanted with a Massachusetts-based firm Cyberkinetics chip called BrainGate, a quadriplegic man was able to compose and check email.Khamsi, R. (2004). Paralyzed man sends e-mail by thought News@nature, doi:10.1038/news041011-9 Prosthetics (\\"Bodyware\\") thumb The second variety of cyberware consists of a more modern form of the rather old field of prosthetics. Modern prostheses attempt to deliver a natural functionality and appearance. In the sub-field where prosthetics and cyberware cross over, experiments have been done where microprocessors, capable of controlling the movements of an artificial limb, are attached to the severed nerve-endings of the patient. The patient is then taught how to operate the prosthetic, trying to learn how to move it as though it were a natural limb.Houston, V. L., Mason, C. P., Beattie, A. C., LaBlanc, K. P., Garbarini, M., Lorenze, E. J., & Thongpop, C. M. (1995). The VA- cyberware lower limb prosthetics-orthotics optical laser digitizer. Journal of Rehabilitation Research and Development, 32(1), 55. Crossing over between prostheses and interfaces are those pieces of equipment attempting to replace lost senses. An early success in this field is the cochlear implant. A tiny device inserted into the inner ear, it replaces the functionality of damaged, or missing, hair cells (the cells that, when stimulated, create the sensation of sound). This device comes firmly under the field of prosthetics, but experiments are also being performed to tap into the brain. Coupled with a speech-processor, this could be a direct link to the speech centres of the brain.Branwyn, Gareth \\"The desire to be wired\\".

It has the greatest range and concentration of any of the 17-year cicadas. Every 17 years, Brood X cicadas tunnel en masse to the surface of the ground, lay eggs, and then die off in several weeks. The combination of long dormancy, simultaneous emergence of vast numbers, and short period before the nymphs' burrowing underground to safety, allows the brood to survive even massive predation. A periodical cicada from brood X 2004 - Princeton, NJ 2004 Brood X swarm in Ohio Detail of swarm Emergence holes located under flagstone Brood X's most recent appearance was in the spring and early summer of 2004 throughout an area roughly enclosed by Illinois, Michigan, New York and Georgia. The next regular appearances will be in 2021 and 2038. However, significant numbers of periodical cicadas, believed to be Brood X emergents that were four years early, appeared throughout the brood's range in 2000 and in the Baltimore, Maryland-Washington, D.C., area in May 2017. .  History  The first known description of an emergence of Brood X appeared a May 9, 1715, entry in the journal of Rev. Andreas Sandel, the pastor of Philadelphia's \\"Gloria Dei\\" Swedish Lutheran Church. In 1737, botanist John Bartram wrote a letter that described the periodicity of the brood's emergences and his 1732 observations of the insect's insertion of their eggs into the small branches of trees northwest of Philadelphia.(1) (2) Kritsky, 2004, pp. 44-46. Bartram later recorded in greater detail within two manuscripts the brood's May 1749 emergence.(1) Kritsky, 2004, pp. 46-47. (2) Pehr Kalm, a Swedish naturalist visiting Pennsylvania and New Jersey in 1749 on behalf of his nation's government, observed in late May an emergence of Brood X. Republished by Knowledge Bank: The Ohio State University Libraries and Office of the Chief Information Officer. Retrieved 2012-10-02. When reporting the event in a paper that a Swedish academic journal published in 1756, Kalm wrote: > The general opinion is that these insects appear in these fantastic numbers > in every seventeenth year. Meanwhile, except for an occasional one which may > appear in the summer, they remain underground. > There is considerable evidence that these insects appear every seventeenth > year in Pennsylvania. Kalm then described documents (including that of Rev. Sandel and one that he had obtained from Benjamin Franklin) that had recorded in Pennsylvania the emergence from the ground of large numbers of cicadas during May 1715 and May 1732. He noted that the people who had prepared these documents had made no such reports in other years. Kalm further noted that others had informed him that they had seen cicadas only occasionally before the insects appeared in large swarms during 1749. He additionally stated that he had not heard any cicadas in Pennsylvania and New Jersey in 1750 in the same months and areas in which he had heard many in 1749. The 1715 and 1732 reports, when coupled with his own 1749 and 1750 observations, supported the previous \\"general opinion\\" that he had cited. Kalm summarized his findings in a book translated into English and published in London in 1771,Kalm, 1771, pp. 212-213. stating: > There are a kind of Locusts which about every seventeen years come hither in > incredible numbers .... In the interval between the years when they are so > numerous, they are only seen or heard single in the woods.(1) Kalm, 1771, > pp. 6-7. > (2) Moses Bartram, a son of John Bartram, described the 1766 emergence of Brood X in his Observations on the cicada, or locust of America, which appears periodically once in 16 or 17 years. Bartram noted that upon hatching from eggs deposited in the twigs of trees, the young insects ran down to the earth and \\"entered the first opening that they could find\\". He reported that he had been able to discover them below the surface, but that others had reportedly found them deep. In April 1800, Benjamin Banneker, who lived near Ellicott's Mills, Maryland, wrote in his record book that he recalled a \\"great locust year\\" in 1749, a second in 1766 during which the insects appeared to be \\"full as numerous as the first\\", and a third in 1783. He predicted that the insects \\"may be expected again in they year 1800 which is Seventeen Since their third appearance to me\\".(1) (2)  Popular culture  This is apparently the brood that emerged in 1936, inspiring Ogden Nash's poem \\"Locust-Lovers, Attention!\\", published in The New Yorker on June 20, 1936, and later reprinted in his collection I'm a Stranger Here Myself. Bob Dylan's song \\"Day of the Locusts\\" on his 1970 album New Morning refers to the Brood X cicadas that were present in Princeton, New Jersey, in June 1970 when Dylan received an honorary degree from Princeton University.(1) (2) (3) (4)  Notes   References   Further reading  * \\"Selected Internet Resources ‚Äì 17-Year Periodical Cicadas (2004)\\", Science Reference Services, Library of Congress  External links  * Brood X map * 2011 Tennessee Cicadas: Noise and Mating * Cicadas Fauna of the Eastern United States ","title":"Brood X"},{"id":"594944","text":"Frederick Reiken (born 1966) is an American author from Livingston, New Jersey He has published three novels to critical acclaim, and he teaches creative writing at Emerson College.  Early life and education  Reiken was born in New Jersey in 1966, and he attended the Pingry School. He earned a B.A. in Biology at Princeton University in 1988, where for his senior thesis he researched the behavioral ecology of island feral horses. He earned an M.F.A. at the University of California, Irvine, in 1992. Reiken is married and has two daughters.  Career  Reiken began thinking of himself as a writer after a poetry class at Princeton with J. D. McClatchy. In addition, Paul Auster's introductory fiction course and John McPhee's \\"Literature of Fact\\" course encouraged him to follow both his passions, science and writing. Following graduation in 1988, he went to the Negev desert as a wildlife biology researcher studying the population dynamics of Persian onagers, a species of wild ass. After completing his M.F.A., in 1992‚Äì1993 he was an artist-in- residence and then assistant director at Cummington Community of the Arts. From 1992 to 1998, he was a reporter, nature writer, and columnist at the Daily Hampshire Gazette. In 1997 he published his first novel. In 1992, he began writing sketches that would eventually become his second novel, published in 2000. His third novel was published in 2010. Reiken's essays and short stories have been published in The New Yorker, Western Humanities Review, Glimmer Train, and The Writer's Chronicle. Since 1999, Reikea has taught creative writing at Emerson College in Boston.  Critical response  Reiken's first novel, The Odd Sea (1998), won the Hackney Literary Award and was selected one of the best first novels of the year by Library Journal and Booklist. Jane Vandenburgh of The New York Times said the novel covers \\"mainly psychological terrain\\", of a family \\"who must somehow cope with the mysterious disappearance of the oldest son, 16-year-old Ethan...which eloquently remind us that the unfathomable can indeed happen, that the unbearable must be bravely withstood\\". Judith Rosen wrote it is \\"a contemporary tale of loss based loosely on The Odyssey\\". Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said it is \\"a haunting first novel that takes a horrifying family calamity and turns it into a form of magic... [Reiken] has skillfully balanced this pain against the hopefulness of the narrator.\\" Reiken's second novel, The Lost Legends of New Jersey (2000), was listed on The New York Times \\"Notable Book\\" list. Critic Gary Krist wrote, \\"Whether he's depicting the mournful uneasiness of two siblings on a last moonlit bike ride or the bewilderment of an estranged father giving himself over to the healing power of a Jacques Cousteau special, Reiken knows how to charge the quietest domestic scenes with consequence and emotion.\\" His third novel, Day for Night (2010), was favorably reviewed by Patrick Ness of The Guardian, who wrote it is \\"a portmanteau novel: discrete stories from different points of view that combine to tell a larger narrative\\". S. Kirk Walsh of The Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"A thought- provoking, intricate portrait of the far-reaching, intergenerational implications of the Holocaust ‚Äîand how fortuitous circumstances can bring people from both sides of a tragedy closer together, and, in some cases, further apart.\\"  Awards and honors  * 1997 Hackney Award for First Novel, The Odd Sea * 2000 New York Times Notable Books of the Year, The Lost Legends of New Jersey * 2000 Los Angeles Times Best Books of the Year, The Lost Legends of New Jersey * 2010 Finalist for the Los Angeles Times, Book Prize, Day for Night * Best novels of 2010, The Washington Post, Day for Night References  External links  NPR interview with Scott Simon, May 8, 2010 20th-century births Living people 20th- century American male writers 21st-century American male writers 20th-century American novelists 21st-century American novelists American male novelists Emerson College faculty Novelists from Massachusetts People from Livingston, New Jersey Pingry School alumni Princeton University alumni University of California, Irvine alumni ","title":"Frederick Reiken"},{"id":"594945","text":"The year 1886 in architecture involved some significant architectural events and new buildings.

A car dealership can either be a franchised dealership, which is a retailer that sells new and used cars, or a used car dealership which only sells used cars. In most cases franchised dealerships include certified pre-owned vehicles, employ trained automotive technicians, and offer financing. In the United States, direct manufacturer auto sales are prohibited in almost every state by franchise laws requiring that new cars be sold only by dealers. Used car dealers carry cars from many different manufacturers, while new car dealerships are generally franchises associated with only one manufacturer. Some new car dealerships may carry multiple brands from the same manufacturer. In some locales, dealerships have been consolidated and a single owner may control a chain of dealerships representing several different manufacturers. New car dealerships also sell used cars, and take in trade-ins and/or purchase used vehicles at auction. Most dealerships also provide a series of additional services for car buyers and owners, which are sometimes more profitable than the core business of selling cars. Selling cars Maxwell, Briscoe dealership A Monroney sticker on window Most car dealerships display their inventory in a showroom and on a car lot. Under U.S. federal law, all new cars must carry a sticker showing the offering price and summarizing the vehicle's features. Salespersons, usually those who only work on commission, negotiate with buyers to determine a final sales price. In many cases, this includes negotiating the price of a trade-in‚Äîthe dealer's purchase of the buyer's current automobile. Negotiation from the dealership's perspective is the actual to-and-fro that occurs when a salesperson works out a deal to a point where the customer is seriously considering the vehicle and makes an offer on the new vehicle, often including the customer's current vehicle as part of the deal. The salesperson then brings the offer, plus a sign of good faith from the customer, which can be a check with a deposit or a credit card to the sales manager where the monthly payment options and various pricing options that result are returned after the sales manager enters the information received from the salesperson into a CRM (customer relations management) computer program. The result is referred to as \\"desking\\" the deal. This is the final step of the negotiation process. The information generated during the desking phase includes payment and pricing options and it usually requires the customer and sales manager to sign off on the option chosen. The next step is a purchase and sales agreement or a sales agreement and the actual monetary downpayment is generated. The manager and customer sign this paperwork and then the customer is handed off to the \\"box\\" or the finance and insurance office where various add-ons are often sold that include special waxing, wheel protection, or often, extended warranty services. The final paperwork is also printed out at this phase. While some may believe that desking is part of the negotiation process, it only occurs once the salesperson has a legitimate offer on the vehicle from the customer and is able to hand the sales manager a token of good faith, as noted. A car dealer orders vehicles from the manufacturer for inventory and pays interest (called flooring or floorplanning). Dealer holdbacks are a system of payments made by the manufacturers to their dealers. The holdback payments assist the dealer's ability to stock their inventory of vehicles and improve the profitability of dealers. Typically the holdback amount is around 1% to 3% of the vehicles' manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP). Hold- back is usually not a negotiable part of the price a consumer would pay for the vehicle, but dealers will \\"give up\\" the dealer holdback to get rid of a car that has been sitting in its inventory for a long time, or if the additional sale will bring them up to the manufacturer's additional incentive payments for reaching unit bonus targets. The holdback was originally designed to help offset the cost the new car dealer has for paying interest on the money that is borrowed to keep the car in inventory but is in effect lowering the dealer's gross profit, and thus the sales commissions paid to employees. The holdback allows dealerships to promote at- or near-invoice price sales and still achieve comfortable profits on such transactions. With the advent of the Internet, the process of selling cars has undergone a considerable change. More than 70% of car purchases in the United States start with research on the Internet. This empowers the buyers with the knowledge of features of comparable cars and the prices and discounts offered by different dealers within the same geographic area. This helps the buyers during price negotiations and puts further pressure on the profit margin of the dealer.  Trading for cars  To an average dealer, the actual cash value of a trade is an opinion of what the vehicle could reasonably be sold for at auction in six weeks to three months time, less any reconditioning costs should the dealer be unable or unwilling to re-sell the trade to the public. Since most states have requirements for a dealer to warranty or even guarantee a used vehicle for a certain amount of time and or mileage if sold to the public at a certain price, a dealer must make a profit selling the previously traded car (now a used car). Trade in value is an important facet of the car deal. Trade value estimates can be found at sites such as NADA,KBB, Edmunds, CarGurus and Consumer Reports. However, most of these values are estimated from a theoretical chart that may or may not be based on recent average sales prices of a particular make and model. If a particular make and model has less accurate data available from recent auction prices the dealer will be more cautious in the appraisal of the car. Inputting an identical used car on each of the above sites will render different values. Sometimes these values will differ slightly, while at other times their sites may differ significantly. A dealer may have a manager who appraises each vehicle offered for trade. This person will often be the person who also attends used car auctions, often buying and selling on behalf of the dealer. This person will have a realistic idea of the actual cash value of the trade. A dealer will look at a trade for body damage, windshield damage, engine noise, and known problems with a particular model, and price it to re-sell it at a profit. The better way to get a real idea of what a trade car's value is to go to at least three dealers and ask them what they would pay for a trade outright. One or more dealers that handle that particular make and model when sold new should be consulted.  Additional services  Most car dealers offer a variety of financing options for the purchase of cars, including loans and leases. Financing can be highly profitable for dealerships. There have been some scandals involving discriminatory or predatory lending practices, and as a result, vehicle financing is heavily regulated in many states. For example, in California, there must be several signs prominently posted on the premises,California Vehicle Code Sections 11709, 11709.1, 11709.2 and 11709.3. and the contract must contain several prominent warnings, such as the words \\"THERE IS NO COOLING-OFF PERIOD.\\" Although the terms of installment contracts are negotiated by the dealer with the buyer, few dealers actually make loans directly to consumers. In the business such dealers are called \\"Buy Here Pay Here\\" dealerships. These stores are able to make loans directly to customers because they have some means of recovering the vehicle if the customer defaults on the loan. The means by which \\"Buy Here Pay Here\\" dealers can recover a vehicle vary by state. Most dealers utilize indirect lenders. This means that the installment loan contracts are immediately \\"assigned\\" or \\"resold\\" to third-party finance companies, often an offshoot of the car's manufacturer such as GM Financial, Ally Financial, or banks, which pay the dealer and then recover the balance by collecting the monthly installment payments promised by the buyer. To facilitate such assignments, dealers generally use one of several standard form contracts preapproved by lenders. The most popular family of contracts for the retail installment sale of vehicles in the U.S. are sold by business process vendor Reynolds and Reynolds; their contracts have been the subject of extensive (and frequently hostile) judicial interpretation in lawsuits between dealers and customers. Sometimes the dealer has the option of marking up the interest rate of the contract and retaining a portion of that markup. For example, a bank may give a wholesale money rate of 6.75% and the dealer may give the consumer an interest rate of 7.75%. The bank would then pay the dealer the difference or a portion thereof. This is a regular practice because the dealership is selling the contract to a bank just like it sold a car to the customer. Most banks or states strictly limit the amount a contract rate may be marked up (by giving a range of rates at which they will buy the contract). In many cases this amounts to little difference in the customer's payment as the amount borrowed is small by comparison to a mortgage and the term shorter. Customers may also find that a dealer can get them better rates than they can with their local bank or credit union. However, manufacturers often offer a low interest rate OR a cash rebate, if the vehicle is not financed through the dealer. Depending upon the amount of the rebate, it is prudent for the consumer to check if applying a larger rebate results in a lower payment due to the fact that s/he is financing less of the purchase. For example, if a dealer has an interest rate offer of 7.9% financing OR a $2000.00 rebate and a consumer's lending source offers 8.25%, a consumer should compare at the credit union what payments and total interest paid would be, if the consumer financed $2000.00 less at the credit union. The dealer can have their lending institution check a consumer's credit. A consumer can also allow his or her lending source to do the same and compare the results. Most financing available at new car dealerships is offered by the financing arm of the vehicle manufacturer or a local bank. Dealers may also offer other services, typically through the Finance and Insurance office. These additional services can include: * Service contracts: While any vehicle sold in the United States now comes standard with some degree of manufacturer's warranty coverage, customers have a wide range of choices to cover their vehicle from mechanical failure beyond that point. Service contracts may have the same terms of coverage as the vehicle's original manufacturer's warranty, but often they do not. Often service contracts carry a deductible as might any insurance contract. Because of the vast number of choices, it is important for consumers to be aware of the coverages before entering into an agreement. Usually these service contracts do not cover regular maintenance items such as brakes, fluids, or filters. In some states, particularly Florida, the cost of such agreements is heavily regulated. There are three main types of service contracts offered. The first is offered by the manufacturer through the dealership and is usually good at any dealership in the US that has that same franchise. When warranty repair work is required, the dealer submits a claim to the manufacturer and is reimbursed for the repair less the deductible paid by the consumer. Under this type of service agreement there is usually no incentive for the dealer to do anything but repair the car as reimbursement from the manufacturer is usually profitable. The second service contract is usually a simple insurance policy that the dealer purchases wholesale and is administered through a third party working for the dealer. This \\"third party\\" can often be a major insurance company. This money collected by the dealer from the consumer is put in a \\"reserve\\" fund for the length and / or term of the service contract. When a repair is required the dealer authorizes the repair with the third party administrator, usually before the repair is done. The third party deducts the repair expense from the dealer's reserve fund. The fewer payments or deductions made on the service contract the greater the profit to the dealer as any unused portion of the \\"reserve\\" is given back to the original selling dealer less an administration fee when the service contract retires. The third type of service contract can be purchased directly from a few automobile insurance companies. * GAP insurance: GAP insurance is protection for the loan in the event that the vehicle is lost as the result of an accident or theft. A GAP policy ensures that in the event of a total loss, the remaining payments are made on the loan so that a customer does not have to pay for a vehicle he or she no longer possesses. Many states regulate GAP insurance (New York, for example, does not allow dealerships to profit from the sale of GAP insurance). * Credit/Life/Disability insurance: It is important to note that this kind of insurance is a profit center for the dealership, working similarly to the second type of service contract described above in this article and cannot be required as a condition of the loan. Customers / Borrowers often have the option of purchasing protection for their loan should the borrower become disabled and unable to work for a period during the time the borrower is required to make payments. Often the coverage begins on the 31st or 32nd day of disability: Meaning the borrower has to be unable to work for a period greater than 30 days before a claim can be filed. Often the borrower is required to submit paperwork to validate a disability claim. Credit Life insurance will usually cover the entire remaining balance of a loan if the borrower dies within the term of the contract. Customers can often obtain this coverage from their own insurance companies. Consumers should compare rates and policies with their own insurance companies. See Consumer Reports for their opinion * Aftermarket accessories: Many dealerships offer accessories that are not offered by the manufacturer directly. These can be dangerous for consumers as some dealerships engage in illegal \\"payment packing\\"---that is, quoting an inflated monthly payment for the car in order to entice customers to agree to purchase aftermarket products offered at inaccurately low costs. One salesman for an accessories distributor was fired after he started asking questions about the legality of this practice; the resulting jury verdict of $480,003 against his former employer for wrongful termination in violation of public policy was upheld in full by a California appellate court in 2007.Casella v. SouthWest Dealer Services, Inc., 157 Cal. App. 4th 1127 (2007). As with Credit/Life/Disability insurance, there are many ways a consumer can purchase these options outside the dealership. * Maintenance agreements: Many dealerships that have their own service shops will offer pre- paid maintenance agreements. These are sometimes offered directly through the manufacturer (such as Saturn's Basic Care or Car Care programs) or by the dealership alone. Because of the vast differences in programs that can exist from dealership to dealership, it is important to know what is covered under the plan and what are the recommended service intervals (see below). *Lease Here Pay Here Contracts: With lease to purchase programs, customers are given a vehicle to lease for a time period that can range from 12 months up to 36 months. What makes this unique is the fact that these vehicle are used as opposed to new vehicle typically obtained from a new car dealer. The dealership that leases these cars is often scrutinized due to the fact that they normally serve the public that do not have strong financial abilities to maintain the obligation. The dealers are not held to the lending standards that most banks are, and also at times of bankruptcy are completely exempt in times of default leading the car dealership with the opportunity to repossesses at any time regardless of breach of contract. Some other pro- advocates say the monthly obligation on leases are cheaper because there is no sales taxes on the vehicle as opposed to the amount a buyer may pay if they are making loan payments on a new or used car purchase. Car dealers also provide maintenance and in some cases, repair service for cars. New car dealerships are more likely to provide these services, since they usually stock and sell parts and process warranty claims for the manufacturers they represent. Maintenance is typically a high-margin service and represents a significant profit center for automotive dealers.  Regulation  In the United States, most aspects of operating a car dealership are regulated at the state level. Car titles are issued and transferred by the individual states through their respective Departments of Motor Vehicles. The purchase price of a vehicle usually includes various fees which the dealer forwards to the state DMV to transfer the vehicle's title to the buyer. In many states, the DMVs also license and regulate car dealerships. In many states, car dealerships are capable of submitting all necessary forms to the DMV on behalf of the customer and are authorized to issue temporary paperwork to the customer to prove that the transaction is in process, allowing the customer to avoid a trip to the nearest DMV office. Consumer complaints against car dealerships are usually investigated by the Attorney General's office in the state where the dealership is located. In states where the DMV licenses and regulates car dealerships, the DMV may have responsibility for initially handling consumer complaints and the state AG's office becomes involved only when there is evidence that a dealer may have committed a crime. Perceptions =Customer experience= According to one survey, more than half of dealership customers would prefer to buy directly from the manufacturer, without any monetary incentives to do so. An analyst report of a direct sales model is estimated to cut the cost of a vehicle by 8.6%.Economic Effects of State Bans on Direct Manufacturer Sales to Car Buyers, U.S. Department of Justice This implies an even greater demand currently exists for a direct manufacturer sales model. However, state laws in the United States prohibit manufacturers from selling directly, and customers must buy new cars through a dealer. =Discrimination= Studies have found that some auto dealerships charge higher interest rates or otherwise raise their prices to females and ethnic minorities, including Asians, and African Americans. These issues have sometimes resulted in lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, against the dealers on the basis of discrimination based on nationality.

The current, permanent campus came into use in 1971. Herkimer College offers programs leading to associate degrees or certificates in several dozen program areas. The college has partnered with Cazenovia College to offer a bachelor's degrees in \\"Criminal Justice and Homeland Security\\" and Inclusive Early Childhood on the Herkimer campus. The College's Internet Academy offers 20 degrees, three certificates and more than 150 courses, as well as support services, completely online.  On-campus housing  Campus Meadows Campus Meadows is the largest residential quad and offers several different styles of apartments including townhouses (two double bedrooms), one-bedroom flats (one double bedroom), two-bedroom flats (two double bedrooms) and dorm-style flats (one bedroom w/ four students). Each apartment includes a full kitchen, living room and bathroom. Furnished four- person apartments, double occupancy bedrooms College Hill Apartments College Hill offers several styles of apartments including two single bedrooms, two bedrooms shared (one single bedroom and one double bedroom) and one double bedroom. Each apartment includes a full kitchen, living room and bathroom. Reservoir Run The newest of the on-campus housing quads is Reservoir Run, featuring four‚Äìperson suite style apartments. Each apartment includes a living room, full kitchen with microwave, laundry room, four single bedrooms and two bathrooms. This residential community is primarily reserved for second-year students. Furnished four-person apartments, single occupancy bedrooms  Athletics  Herkimer's athletic program began with five sports in 1970, under the direction of Tom LaPuma, and has grown to include 19 varsity offerings. With its growth has come great success with 52 NJCAA National Championships, 100 Region III titles, 142 Mountain Valley Collegiate Conference championships and 29 NJCAA Academic Team of the Year awards. In 2013-14 and 2014‚Äì15, Herkimer ranked first in the nation among two-year non-scholarship athletic programs by winning the National Alliance of Two-Year College Athletic Administrators (NATYCAA) Cup. The award recognizes excellence in two-year colleges, based on athletic success in championship competition.

She read history at St Hilda's College, Oxford. She now lives in Ely, Cambridgeshire, with her husband, the poet Lachlan Mackinnon. Biography Cope was born in Erith in Kent (now in the London Borough of Bexley), where her father Fred Cope was manager of the local department store, Hedley Mitchell. She was educated at West Lodge Preparatory School in Sidcup and Farrington's School, Chislehurst, both in Kent. Following her graduation from St Hilda's College, Oxford Cope spent fifteen years as a primary-school teacher. In 1981, she became Arts and Reviews editor for the Inner London Education Authority magazine, Contact. Five years later she became a freelance writer and was a television critic for The Spectator magazine until 1990. Five collections of her adult poetry have been published, Making Cocoa for Kingsley Amis in 1986, Serious Concerns in 1992, If I Don't Know in 2001, Family Values in 2011, and Anecdotal Evidence in 2018. She has also edited several anthologies of comic verse and was a judge of the 2007 Man Booker Prize. In 1998, she was voted the listeners' choice in a BBC Radio 4 poll to succeed Ted Hughes as Poet Laureate. When Andrew Motion's term as Poet Laureate came to an end in 2009, Cope was again widely considered a popular candidate, although she believes the post should be discontinued. Carol Ann Duffy succeeded Motion as Poet Laureate. Cope was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2010 Birthday Honours. In April 2011, the British Library purchased Cope's archive including manuscripts, school reports and 40,000 emails, the largest email archive they have bought to date. The papers also includes 67 poetry notebooks and unpublished poems. Cope commented \\"I wanted to find a good home for my archive. The timing was dictated because we had to move home, so we needed some money to buy a house, and the space. So this was the moment. I asked Andrew Motion what I should do, and he told me someone to approach at the British Library. I wasn't sure they would want it, but they did.\\" When the collection is catalogued and organised, the archive will be available to researchers.The Guardian \\"Wendy Cope's archive sold to British Library\\" 20 April 2011 In 2013, after 19 years of living together, Cope married Lachlan Mackinnon in a register office, although she has stated that she would have preferred a civil partnership. In January 2019 she was the guest on BBC Radio 4's long-running programme Desert Island Discs. Her book choice was The Compleet Molesworth, her luxury item was writing materials and her favourite track was Bach's Concerto for Two Violins and Strings in D minor. Critical reception Despite her slight output, her books have sold well and she has attracted a popular following with her lighthearted, often comical poetry, as well as achieving literary credibility winning two awards and making an award shortlist over a fourteen-year period. She has a keen eye for the everyday, mundane aspects of English life, especially the desires, frustrations, hopes, confusions and emotions in intimate relationships. Dr Rowan Williams is a well known fan of her work, writing that: \\"Wendy Cope is without doubt the wittiest of contemporary English poets, and says a lot of extremely serious things\\".\\"poetryarchive.org\\" A Tour of the Archive with Dr Rowan Williams Three haiku from Making Cocoa for Kingsley Amis, where they are presented as being written by the (fictional) Tulse Hill poet Jason Strugnell, were set by the composer Colin Matthews in 1990 as Strugnell's Haiku.Matthews, Colin (1990). Strugnell's Haiku. London: Faber Music. In 2008 Cope's poem \\"After The Lunch\\" was used as the lyric of the song \\"Waterloo Bridge\\" by jazz composer and musician Jools Holland and singer Louise Marshall. Style Some of her poems are written in the persona of a struggling male poet, Jason Strugnell, a slightly seedy figure from Tulse Hill. She displays her talent for parody with targets ranging from the sonnets of Sir Philip Sidney: > My true love hath my heart and I have hers > We swapped last Tuesday and felt quite elated > But now whenever one of us refers > To 'my heart' things get rather complicated. > to reducing T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land to limericks: > In April one seldom feels cheerful; > Dry stones, sun and dust make me fearful; > Clairvoyants distress me, > Commuters depress me‚Äî > Met Stetson and gave him an earful. > Her style has been compared to that of John Betjeman and Philip Larkin.

It was developed by a team led by food scientist Edwin Traisman (1915‚Äì2007). While many sources give its national debut as 1953, it was advertised by Kraft and retailers in several states in late 1952. Orangish-yellow in color, it usually comes in a glass jar and is used as a topping for various foods, including corn chips, and hot dogs. It is also frequently used as the cheese in a Philadelphia-style cheesesteak. It is marketed in Canada, Mexico, the Philippines, the United States, and Venezuela. Cheez Whiz is one of a number of \\"processed cheese foods\\", a category including some types of individually wrapped cheese slices. These products contain regular cheese that has been reprocessed along with additional ingredients such as emulsifiers and stabilizing agents, such as xanthan gum or carrageenan, and derive their tanginess and flavor from additional ingredients, such as citric acid and flavoring compounds. Annatto is used for coloring.  Ingredients  As of 2016, Kraft describes Cheez Whiz as a \\"cheese dip\\" with the word cheese spelled correctly. According to a Kraft spokesman, the product does include cheese, but the company has chosen to list its parts‚Äîsuch as cheese culture and milk‚Äîinstead of cheese as a component itself.  Sizes  In some markets, the product has been sold in a narrow jar that tapered narrower towards the base, and sold as a spread. When Cheez Whiz is advertised as a dip or a sauce, the jars are larger and more of a squat cylindrical shape.  Varieties  Varieties include: * Cheez Whiz * Cheez Whiz Light * Cheez Whiz Tex Mex * Salsa Con Queso * Cheez Whiz Italia * Cheez Whiz Bacon * Cheez Whiz Pimento Cheez Whiz can also be found in \\"Handi Snacks\\" products such as Ritz Cheez Whiz 'n' Crackers in Canada. Cheez Whiz was reformulated in the early 21st century. The new formula is used for Cheez Whiz Light (15.5 oz) as well as the Original Big Cheese (15 oz). The products' jars were also widened to allow dipping.  Formula change  Over the years since its creation, Kraft had altered its recipe due to changes in dairy sourcing and the regulatory environment, resulting in a reduction of cheese content. Kraft also made a change in the way that it lists its ingredients; away from listing components (like cheese) to listing its parts (such as milk and cheese culture). Such changes are common throughout the food industry, and are often done without announcement.

They are found in places that are permanently cold, such as the polar regions and the deep sea. They can be contrasted with thermophiles, which are organisms that thrive at unusually high temperatures. Psychrophile is Greek for 'cold-loving'. Many such organisms are bacteria or archaea, but some eukaryotes such as lichens, snow algae, fungi, and wingless midges, are also classified as psychrophiles. Biology The lichen Xanthoria elegans can continue to photosynthesize at ‚àí24 ¬∞C. =Habitat= The cold environments that psychrophiles inhabit are ubiquitous on Earth, as a large fraction of our planetary surface experiences temperatures lower than 15 ¬∞C. They are present in permafrost, polar ice, glaciers, snowfields and deep ocean waters. These organisms can also be found in pockets of sea ice with high salinity content. Microbial activity has been measured in soils frozen below ‚àí39 ¬∞C. In addition to their temperature limit, psychrophiles must also adapt to other extreme environmental constraints that may arise as a result of their habitat. These constraints include high pressure in the deep sea, and high salt concentration on some sea ice. =Adaptations= Psychrophiles are protected from freezing and the expansion of ice by ice-induced desiccation and vitrification (glass transition), as long as they cool slowly. Free living cells desiccate and vitrify between ‚àí10 ¬∞C and ‚àí26 ¬∞C. Cells of multicellular organisms may vitrify at temperatures below ‚àí50 ¬∞C. The cells may continue to have some metabolic activity in the extracellular fluid down to these temperatures, and they remain viable once restored to normal temperatures. They must also overcome the stiffening of their lipid cell membrane, as this is important for the survival and functionality of these organisms. To accomplish this, psychrophiles adapt lipid membrane structures that have a high content of short, unsaturated fatty acids. Compared to longer saturated fatty acids, incorporating this type of fatty acid allows for the lipid cell membrane to have a lower melting point, which increases the fluidity of the membranes. In addition, carotenoids are present in the membrane, which help modulate the fluidity of it. Antifreeze proteins are also synthesized to keep psychrophiles' internal space liquid, and to protect their DNA when temperatures drop below water's freezing point. By doing so, the protein prevents any ice formation or recrystallization process from occurring. The enzymes of these organisms have been hypothesized to engage in an activity-stability-flexibility relationship as a method for adapting to the cold; the flexibility of their enzyme structure will increase as a way to compensate for the freezing effect of their environment. Certain cryophiles, such as Gram-negative bacteria Vibrio and Aeromonas spp., can transition into a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state. During VBNC, a micro- organism can respirate and use substrates for metabolism ‚Äì however, it cannot replicate. An advantage of this state is that it is highly reversible. It has been debated whether VBNC is an active survival strategy or if eventually the organism's cells will no longer be able to be revived. There is proof however it may be very effective ‚Äì Gram positive bacteria Actinobacteria have been shown to have lived about 500,000 years in the permafrost conditions of Antarctica, Canada, and Siberia. =Taxonomic range= The wingless midge (Chironomidae) Belgica antarctica. Psychrophiles include bacteria, lichens, fungi, and insects. Among the bacteria that can tolerate extreme cold are Arthrobacter sp., Psychrobacter sp. and members of the genera Halomonas, Pseudomonas, Hyphomonas, and Sphingomonas. Another example is Chryseobacterium greenlandensis, a psychrophile that was found in 120,000-year-old ice. Umbilicaria antarctica and Xanthoria elegans are lichens that have been recorded photosynthesizing at temperatures ranging down to ‚àí24 ¬∞C, and they can grow down to around ‚àí10 ¬∞C. Some multicellular eukaryotes can also be metabolically active at sub-zero temperatures, such as some conifers; those in the Chironomidae family are still active at ‚àí16 ¬∞C. Penicillium is a genus of fungi found in a wide range of environments including extreme cold. Among the psychrophile insects, the Grylloblattidae or ice crawlers, found on mountaintops, have optimal temperatures between 1-4 ¬∞C. The wingless midge (Chironomidae) Belgica antarctica can tolerate salt, being frozen and strong ultraviolet, and has the smallest known genome of any insect. The small genome, of 99 million base pairs, is thought to be adaptive to extreme environments.  Psychrotrophic Insects  Insects that are psychrotrophic can survive cold temperatures through several general mechanisms (unlike opportunistic and chill susceptible insects): (1) chill tolerance, (2) freeze avoidance, and (3) freeze tolerance. Chill tolerant insects succumb to freezing temperatures after prolonged exposure to mild or moderate freezing temperatures. Freeze avoiding insects can survive extended periods of time at sub-freezing temperatures in a supercooled state, but die at their supercooling point. Freeze tolerant insects can survive ice crystal formation within their body at sub-freezing temperatures. Freeze tolerance within insects is argued to be on a continuum, with some insect species exhibiting partial (e.g., Tipula paludosa, Hemideina thoracica ), moderate (e.g., Cryptocercus punctulatus), and strong freezing tolerance (e.g., Eurosta solidaginis and Syrphus ribesii), and other insect species exhibiting freezing tolerance with low supercooling point (e.g., Pytho deplanatus). Psychrotrophic Bacteria Psychrotrophic microbes are able to grow at temperatures below , but have better growth rates at higher temperatures. Psychrotrophic bacteria and fungi are able to grow at refrigeration temperatures, and can be responsible for food spoilage. They provide an estimation of the product's shelf life, but also they can be found in soils, in surface and deep sea waters, in Antarctic ecosystems, and in foods. Psychrotrophic bacteria are of particular concern to the dairy industry. Most are killed by pasteurization; however, they can be present in milk as post- pasteurization contaminants due to less than adequate sanitation practices. According to the Food Science Department at Cornell University, psychrotrophs are bacteria capable of growth at temperatures at or less than . At freezing temperatures, growth of psychrotrophic bacteria becomes negligible or virtually stops.Steven C. Murphy, \\"Shelf LIfe of Fluid Milk Products -- Microbial Spoilage\\", Food Science Department, Cornell University.. Retrieved 22 November 2009. All three subunits of the RecBCD enzyme are essential for physiological activities of the enzyme in the Antarctic Pseudomonas syringae, namely, repairing of DNA damage and supporting the growth at low temperature. The RecBCD enzymes are exchangeable between the psychrophilic P. syringae and the mesophilic E. coli when provided with the entire protein complex from same species. However, the RecBC proteins (RecBCPs and RecBCEc) of the two bacteria are not equivalent; the RecBCEc is proficient in DNA recombination and repair, and supports the growth of P. syringae at low temperature, while RecBCPs is insufficient for these functions. Finally, both helicase and nuclease activity of the RecBCDPs are although important for DNA repair and growth of P. syringae at low temperature, the RecB-nuclease activity is not essential in vivo. Psychrophile Versus psychrotroph In 1940, ZoBell and Conn stated that they had never encountered \\"true psychrophiles\\" or organisms that grow best at relatively low temperatures. In 1958, J. L. Ingraham supported this by concluding that there are very few or possibly no bacteria that fit the textbook definitions of psychrophiles. Richard Y. Morita emphasizes this by using the term psychrotroph to describe organisms that do not meet the definition of psychrophiles. The confusion between the terms psychrotrophs and psychrophiles was started because investigators were unaware of the thermolability of psychrophilic organisms at the laboratory temperatures. Due to this, early investigators did not determine the cardinal temperatures for their isolates. The similarity between these two is that they are both capable of growing at zero, but optimum and upper temperature limits for the growth are lower for psychrophiles compared to psychrotrophs. Psychrophiles are also more often isolated from permanently cold habitats compared to psychrotrophs. Although psychrophilic enzymes remain under-used because the cost of production and processing at low temperatures is higher than for the commercial enzymes that are presently in use, the attention and resurgence of research interest in psychrophiles and psychrotrophs will be a contributor to the betterment of the environment and the desire to conserve energy.

In a career which lasted from 1930 until 1935, he ran fifty-one times and won twenty-nine races. A leading two-year-old in 1930, he missed most of the next season, including two of the three American Triple Crown races through injury and illness. \\"Ekky\\" returned to the track in 1934 and proved to be a dominant champion, winning numerous important stakes races in the next three years. Equipoise died in 1938 after a short but promising stud career. Background Equipoise was a chestnut bred in the United States by Harry Payne Whitney and owned by his son, Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney. He was called the \\"Chocolate Soldier\\" by his fans, due to his elegance and symmetry. His sire, Pennant, won the Belmont Futurity Stakes for Harry Payne Whitney in 1913. Equipoise's dam, Swinging, was a descendant of The Oaks winner Miami, placing him in the same Thoroughbred family as the 1897 English Triple Crown winner Galtee More and the 1902 Epsom Derby winner Ard Patrick as well as some well-known American runners, such as Intentionally and Seabiscuit. As a yearling, Equipoise was an unimpressive individual. C. V. Whitney thought so little of the ugly duckling that he sent him to his second-string trainer, Fred Hopkins. Racing career =1930-1931: early career= As a two-year-old, Equipoise ran sixteen times, claiming his first stakes victory when he won the Keene Memorial Stakes at Belmont Park. In September, he ran in the Belmont Futurity the most valuable two-year-old race of the season in which he was beaten a nose by Jamestown. Although Jamestown's victory was regarded by some as having decided the identity of the best two-year-old, he did not race again in 1930, while Equipoise went on to further success. On November 5, he beat Twenty Grand by half a length with Mate a neck away in third in the Pimlico Futurity. After starting slowly, he settled the race in the straight with what the New York Times described as \\"a brilliant burst of speed\\" to reverse two earlier defeats by Twenty Grand. When his jockey, Sonny Workman, was asked if this was his greatest race, Workman replied: \\"My greatest race? Hell, it may have been the greatest race anybody ever saw.\\" Although there were no formal awards for Thoroughbred racing in 1930, press opinion was that Equipoise's win at Pimlico entitled him to \\"a share of the 2 year old championship honors\\" Equipoise started 1931 as the favorite for the Kentucky Derby and won on his reappearance at Havre de Grace, Maryland. At the same track on April 26, he finished last of the six runners in the Chesapeake Stakes, after which he was reported to be suffering from a kidney ailment described as \\"azoturia\\" or \\"blackwater\\". Later reports ascribed his defeat to problems with his \\"shelly\\" feet. In the Preakness Stakes, which was the first of the Triple Crown races in 1931, he finished fourth behind Mate. A week later, he was withdrawn from the Derby on the day of the race and did not race again that year. =1932-1935: later career= As a four-year-old in 1932, Equipoise won ten of his fourteen starts. On May 21, he won the Metropolitan Handicap at Belmont Park from Sun Meadow, with Mate third. Equipoise, who started 3/5 favorite, won by two and a half lengths despite being eased down by Workman near the finish and was received with \\"thunderous applause\\". On May 31 at Arlington Park, Chicago, Equipoise set a world record of 1:34.4 for a mile when winning the Delavan Purse. In the Stars and Stripes Handicap at the same course four days later, he \\"outclassed\\" his opponents. On August 13, Equipoise led all the way to win the Whitney Stakes by three lengths from the three-year-old Gusto. According to the New York Times report, the win confirmed his status as the best horse in the handicap division. At five, Equipoise won seven more races. On June 3, he gave 26 pounds to the runner-up, Okapi, in again winning the Metropolitan, living up to his reputation as the \\"king of the handicap horses\\". Four days later, he ran in the Suburban Handicap carrying 132 pounds over a mile and a quarter. He won by two lengths from Osculator, with Apprentice five lengths back in third. In August, he faced the highly regarded Gallant Sir in the Hawthorne Gold Cup and won a \\"thrilling\\" race by two lengths to record his sixth successive win. His other wins included April's Philadelphia Handicap at Havre de Grace Racetrack which he won again in 1934. In September he won the Saratoga Cup in which he raced beyond a mile and a quarter for the first time and won from Gusto and Keep Out. As a six-year-old, Equipoise was kept in training with the aim of beating Sun Beau's earnings record. In the spring, he won the Philadelphia Handicap at Havre de Grace and the Dixie Handicap at Pimlico before being rested till autumn. On November 6, he overcame a wet and muddy Belmont track (described as a \\"sea of slop\\") to beat Faireno in the Whitney Gold Trophy. At the start of 1935, the seven-year- old Equipoise was sent to California for the inaugural running of the world's richest race, the Santa Anita Handicap, which was to be his final race. He showed some promise in defeat in two prep races and started favorite despite top weight of 130 pounds against what was described as \\"the greatest field of horses ever assembled\\". Equipoise's challenge ended in disappointment: according to Sonny Workman, he \\"simply wouldn't run\\" as he finished seventh to the Irish-bred Steeplechase specialist Azucar. Whitney later revealed that Equipoise had suffered a recurrence of the tendon injury which had kept him off the track in the previous summer. He was retired to stud with earnings of $338,610, the second highest in racing history up to that time. Assessment His career was greatly restricted by hoof problems, but he was still regarded by contemporary observers as the outstanding American horse of his era. Although there were no formal awards at this time, he was regarded as United States Horse of the Year in both 1932 and 1933 and as the best older horse in 1932, 1933, and 1934. In the Blood-Horse magazine ranking of the top 100 thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century, which ranked only horses that ran in North America, Equipoise was ranked #21. In their book A Century of Champions, the British writers Tony Morris and John Randall placed Equipoise at #163 in their global ranking of 20th Century Thoroughbreds. Equipoise was also inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in Saratoga Springs, New York, in 1957. Stud record Equipoise stood as a stallion for only four seasons before his death on August 4, 1938, at the age of ten. Four years later, the success of his progeny, notably the Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes winner Shut Out, saw him become America's Champion sire. References in popular culture In \\"Fugue for Tinhorns,\\" the opening number of the musical Guys and Dolls, Equipoise is referred to as the great- grandfather of one of the song's fictional racehorses. Equipoise is also one of the racing mice in the movie Stalag 17.

A member of the Democratic Party, he served as a U.S. Representative (1937-1944) and a U.S. Senator (1944-1981) from Washington. He served over 36 years in the Senate, and was the most senior member of the body during his final two years in office. Early life and education Warren Magnuson was born in Moorhead, Minnesota. His birth date is given as April 12, 1905, but the actual records of his birth are sealed. He apparently never knew his birth parents; according to various sources, his parents either died within a month of his birth, or his unmarried mother put him up for adoption. He was adopted by William Grant and Emma (n√©e Anderson) Magnuson, who gave him their name. The Magnusons were second-generation Scandinavian immigrants who operated a bar in Moorhead, and who adopted a daughter named Clara a year after adopting Warren. His adoptive father left the family in 1921. Magnuson attended Moorhead High School, where he played quarterback on the football team and was captain of the baseball team. While attending high school, he ran a YMCA camp, worked in the wheat farms, and delivered newspapers and telegrams in Moorhead and in nearby Fargo, North Dakota. He graduated in 1923, and then enrolled at the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks. In 1924, he transferred to the North Dakota Agricultural College in Fargo, which he attended for a year. He then traveled through Canada for a period of time, riding freight trains and working with threshing crews. Magnuson followed a high school girlfriend to Seattle, Washington, where he entered the University of Washington in 1925. He was a member of the Theta Chi fraternity, and worked delivering ice as a member of the Teamsters under Dave Beck. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1926, and earned a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Washington School of Law in 1929. A Democrat, he first became active in politics in 1928, volunteering for A. Scott Bullitt for governor and Al Smith for president. Early career In 1929, Magnuson was admitted to the bar and joined the law office of Judge Samuel Stern in Seattle. He served as secretary of the Seattle Municipal League from 1930 to 1931. He served as special prosecutor for King County in 1932, investigating official misconduct. He also founded the state chapter of the Young Democrats of America that same year. He was a leading supporter of repealing state Prohibition laws and establishing the state Liquor Control Board. From 1933 to 1934, Magnuson served as a member of the Washington House of Representatives from the Seattle-based 37th Legislative District. As a state legislator, he sponsored the first unemployment compensation bill in the nation. He was a delegate to the state constitutional convention in 1933. He briefly served as Assistant United States District Attorney before being elected prosecuting attorney of King County, serving from 1934 to 1936. Congressional career Magnuson was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1936, filling a vacancy caused by the sudden death of fellow Democrat Marion Zioncheck on August 7, 1936. In 1937, along with senators Homer Bone and Matthew Neely, Magnuson introduced the National Cancer Institute Act, which was signed into law by Franklin Roosevelt on August 5 of that year. He won re-election in 1938, 1940, and 1942. After the Attack on Pearl Harbor Magnuson was a staunch supporter of the U.S. war effort.Magnuson was instrumental in securing a commission in the U.S. Army for Bob Struble in 1942. Magnuson served in the United States Navy during World War II. He was aboard the aircraft carrier for several months, seeing heavy combat in the Pacific Theatre until President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered all congressmen on active duty to return home in 1942. In 1944, Magnuson successfully ran for the U.S. Senate. He was appointed on December 14, 1944 to fill the vacancy created by Homer Bone's appointment to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, thus resigning from the House and starting his service in the Senate a month early. He was re-elected in 1950, 1956, 1962, 1968, and 1974. He served on the Senate Commerce Committee throughout his tenure in the Senate, and the Senate Appropriations Committee during his final term. Magnuson served most of his tenure in the Senate alongside his friend and Democratic colleague from Washington State, Henry M. \\"Scoop\\" Jackson. Magnuson was defeated in a bid for re-election by state attorney general Slade Gorton in 1980. In August 1950, Magnuson proposed voluntary enlistment for the Japanese in the American armed forces and sent a cable request to General Douglas MacArthur on the practicality of the proposal.Arming of Germans, Japanese Proposed to Meet Red Threat (August 5, 1950) In November 1961, President John F. Kennedy visited Seattle and was an honored guest at a celebration honoring Magnuson's first 25 years in Congress. Nearly 3,000 people paid $100 each to attend the dinner. At the end of August 1966, after President Johnson announced the nominations of Charles F. Luce for Undersecretary of the Interior, John A. Carver for Federal Power Commission membership, and David S. Black for BPA administrator, Magnuson announced the Senate Commerce committee would hold hearings into the Carver nomination on September 1 and described Luce as \\"one of the most able, dedicated, productive public servants I know\\". On November 7, 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, noting Magnuson as one of the members of Congress to \\"have been part of the team that has brought this measure to the White House to make it the law of our land.\\" At least three important pieces of legislation bear his name: the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Chinese Exclusion Repeal Act of 1943 (commonly referred to as the Magnuson Act), and the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act. He was also instrumental in keeping supertankers out of Puget Sound, by slipping an amendment to a routine funding reauthorization bill through on the Senate and House consent calendars.HistoryLink.org, the online encyclopedia of Washington State history. Accessed July 19, 2006 The bill that became the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was referred to the Committee on Commerce. Magnuson played a key role in getting that bill to the floor and enacted into law despite vigorous opposition by Senator William Fulbright and other staunch segregationists. Magnuson was responsible for special legislation that allowed Poon Lim, a Chinese sailor who in 1942 survived 133 days alone at sea as a castaway, to immigrate to the U.S. Magnuson attended the May 5, 1978 dedication ceremony for Riverfront Park in Spokane. Shortly thereafter, during a town hall meeting, President Jimmy Carter said, \\"No one could be in a better political position than to be preceded and introduced by men like Tom Foley and Senator Warren Magnuson. I know of no one in the Congress than these two men who are more respected, more dedicated to serving their own people well, but who have also reached, because of their experience and knowledge, sound judgment and commitment, a position of national and even international renown and leadership.\\" Personal life In 1928, Magnuson married Eleanor Peggy \\"Peggins\\" Maddieux, who had been crowned Miss Seattle the previous year. They remained together until their divorce in 1935. Magnuson dated a number of glamorous women, including heiress and cover girl June Millarde and actress Carole Parker. In 1964, he married Jermaine Elliott Peralta (1923-2011), widowed as a teenager, in a ceremony conducted by Rev. Frederick Brown Harris at the Omni Shoreham Hotel. The couple remained together until his death, and he helped raise Peralta's daughter from her previous marriage, Juanita. Magnuson and his wife are interred in Acacia Memorial Park in Lake Forest Park, north of Seattle. Namesakes *Warren G.

In the battle, an Athenian fleet commanded by eight strategoi defeated a Spartan fleet under Callicratidas. The battle was precipitated by a Spartan victory which led to the Athenian fleet under Conon being blockaded at Mytilene; to relieve Conon, the Athenians assembled a scratch force composed largely of newly constructed ships manned by inexperienced crews. This inexperienced fleet was thus tactically inferior to the Spartans, but its commanders were able to circumvent this problem by employing new and unorthodox tactics, which allowed the Athenians to secure a dramatic and unexpected victory. Slaves and metics who participated in the battle were granted Athenian citizenship. The news of the victory itself was met with jubilation at Athens. Their joy was tempered, however, by the aftermath of the battle, in which a storm prevented the ships assigned to rescue the survivors of the 25 disabled or sunken Athenian triremes from performing their duties, and a great number of sailors drowned. A fury erupted at Athens when the public learned of this, and after a bitter struggle in the assembly six of the eight generals who had commanded the fleet were tried as a group and executed. At Sparta, meanwhile, traditionalists who had supported Callicratidas pressed for peace with Athens, knowing that a continuation of the war would lead to the re-ascendence of their opponent Lysander. This party initially prevailed, and a delegation was dispatched to Athens to make an offer of peace; the Athenians, however, rejected this offer, and Lysander departed to the Aegean to take command of the fleet for the remainder of the war, which would be decided less than a year later by his total victory at Aegospotami.  Prelude  = Callicratidas and Conon = In 406 BC, Callicratidas was appointed as the navarch of the Spartan fleet, replacing Lysander.Unless noted otherwise, all details of the prelude to the battle and the battle are drawn from Xenophon, Hellenica 1.6.1-34. Callicratidas was a traditionalist Spartan, distrustful of Persian influence and reluctant to ask for support from the Persian prince Cyrus, who had been a strong supporter of Lysander. Thus, Callicratidas was forced to assemble his fleet and funding by seeking contributions from Sparta's allies among the Greek cities of the region. In this fashion, he assembled a fleet of some 140 triremes. Conon, meanwhile, in command of the Athenian fleet at Samos, was compelled by problems with the morale of his sailors to man only 70 of the more than 100 triremes he had in his possession.Xenophon, Hellenica 1.5.20 Callicratidas, once he had assembled his fleet, sailed against Methymna, on Lesbos, which he laid siege to and stormed. From Methymna, Callicratidas could potentially move to capture the rest of Lesbos, which would clear the way for him to move his fleet to the Hellespont, where he would be athwart the all-important Athenian grain supply line. To defend Lesbos, Conon was forced to move his numerically inferior fleet from Samos to the Hekatonnesi islands near Methymna.Kagan, The Peloponnesian War, 451 When Callicratidas attacked him, however, with a fleet that had swollen to a size of 170 ships, Conon was forced to flee to Mytilene, where, in the Battle of Mytilene, he was blockaded with his fleet after losing 30 ships in a clash at the mouth of the harbor. Besieged by land and sea, Conon was powerless to act against the vastly superior forces that surrounded him, and was only barely able to slip a messenger ship out to Athens to carry the news of his plight. = The relief force = When the messenger ship reached Athens with news of Conon's situation, the assembly wasted no time in approving extreme measures to build and man a relief force. The golden statues of Nike were melted down to fund the construction of the ships,Kagan, The Peloponnesian War, 452 and slaves and metics were enlisted to crew the fleet. To ensure a sufficiently large and loyal group of crewmen, the Athenians even took the radical step of extending citizenship to thousands of slaves who rowed with the fleet.Hunt, The Slaves and Generals of Arginusae, 359-64 Over a hundred ships were prepared and manned through these measures, and contributions from allied ships raised the fleet's size to 150 triremes after it reached Samos. In a highly unorthodox arrangement, the fleet was commanded collaboratively by eight generals; these were Aristocrates, Aristogenes, Diomedon, Erasinides, Lysias, Pericles, Protomachus, and Thrasyllus. After leaving Samos, the Athenian fleet sailed to the Arginusae islands, opposite Cape Malea on Lesbos, where they camped for an evening. Callicratidas, who had sailed south to Malea with most of his fleet upon learning of the Athenians' movements, spotted their signal fires and planned to attack them by night, but was prevented from doing so by a thunderstorm, and so was forced to delay his attack until morning.  The battle  At dawn the next day, Callicratidas led his fleet out to meet the Athenians. He had 140 ships to match the Athenians' 150, having left 50 to watch Conon at Mytilene. For the first time in the war, the Spartan crews and commanders were more experienced than their Athenian opposites, as the Athenians' best crews had been at sea with Conon.Kagan, The Peloponnesian War, 454 To counter the Spartans' superior skill and maneuverability, the Athenian commanders implemented several new and innovative tactics. First, the Athenian fleet was divided into eight autonomous divisions, each commanded by one of the generals; second, they arranged their fleet in a double line instead of the traditional single line in order to prevent the Spartans from using the maneuver known as the diekplous, in which a trireme raced into a gap between two enemy ships and then wheeled to strike one of them in the side; if the Spartans attempted this against a double line, a ship from the second line could move up to attack the Spartan ship.Kagan, The Peloponnesian War, 454-56 The Athenians (yellow) used an unusual tactic with which they prevented a diekplous As the Athenians advanced, they extended their left flank out to sea, outflanking the Spartans. The superior Athenian numbers, combined with the tactics they had implemented, created a dangerous situation for the Spartans, and Callicratidas' helmsman advised him to retire without a fight, but the navarch insisted on pushing on. Dividing his force in two to meet the threat of encirclement,Diodorus Siculus, Library 13.98.4 Callicratidas led his fleet into battle. Heated fighting ensued for some time, but eventually Callicratidas, leading the Spartan right, was killed when his ship rammed an opposing ship, and resistance on the right collapsed. The left continued to resist for longer, but was unable to stand up to the entire Athenian fleet and soon joined the right wing in flight. All told, the Spartans lost some 70 ships, and the Athenians 25.Diodorus Siculus, Library 13.99.6  Aftermath  In the immediate aftermath of the battle, the Athenian commanders had to decide which of several pressing tasks to focus their attention on. Conon was still blockaded at Mytilene by 50 Spartan ships, and decisive action against those ships could lead to their destruction before they had a chance to join the remainder of Callicratidas' fleet. At the same time, however, the survivors from the 25 Athenian ships sunk or disabled in the battle remained afloat off the Arginusae islands.For the dilemma of the generals, see Kagan, The Peloponnesian War, 459-60. To address both of these concerns, the generals decided that all eight of them would sail with the majority of the fleet to Mytilene, where they would attempt to relieve Conon, while the trierarchs Thrasybulus and Theramenes would remain behind with a smaller detachment to rescue the survivors; both of these missions, however, were thwarted by the sudden arrival of a storm which drove the ships back into port. The Spartan fleet at Mytilene escaped, and rescuing the drowning sailors proved impossible.Xenophon, Hellenica 1.6.35-36 = Trial of the generals = At Athens, the public relief at this unexpected victory was quickly subsumed in a bitter rhetorical battle over who was responsible for the failure to rescue the sailors. When the generals learned that the public was angry over the failed rescue, they assumed that Thrasybulus and Theramenes, who had already returned to the city, were responsible, and accordingly wrote letters to the assembly denouncing the two trierarchs and blaming them for the disaster.The broad account followed here and in the following paragraph is that of Diodorus, 13.101. Xenophon, at 1.7, gives a different account which places much more of the blame for the trial and execution on Theramenes' shoulders. Modern scholars (see Fine The Ancient Greeks, 514-15, Kagan, The Peloponnesian War, 461-66, and Hornblower, The Greek World, 151) have generally preferred Diodorus' account at certain key points. Xenophon, however, offers more specific detail of many events, and unless otherwise noted, details given here are from his account, at Hellenica, 1.7.1-35. The trierarchs responded successfully to the allegations brought against them, and public anger now turned against the generals instead.Diodorus Siculus, Library 13.101.4 The eight generals were deposed from their office and ordered to return to Athens to stand trial; two of them, Aristogenes and Protomachus, fled, but the other six returned. Upon their return, they were imprisoned, and one of them, Erasinides, was brought to trial and convicted of several charges involving misconduct in office; this trial may represent an attempt by the generals' enemies to test the wind, since Erasinides, who had proposed abandoning the survivors altogether during the deliberations after the battle, may have been the easiest target among the six.Kagan, The Peloponnesian War, 462 The question of how the generals should be tried for their failure to rescue the survivors was then brought before the assembly. On the first day of debate, the generals were able to win the sympathy of the crowd by placing the blame for the tragedy entirely on the storm that had thwarted the rescue attempts. Unfortunately for them, however, this first day of debate was followed by the festival of the Apaturia, at which families met together; in this context, the absence of those drowned at Arginusae was painfully evident, and when the assembly next met the initiative passed to those who wished to treat the generals harshly. A politician named Callixeinus proposed that, without further debate, the assembly should vote on the guilt or innocence of the generals. Euryptolemus, a cousin of Alcibiades, and several others opposed the motion on the grounds that it was unconstitutional, but they withdrew their opposition after another politician moved that the same penalty applied to the generals be applied to them. With the opposition from the floor now silenced, the generals' accusers sought to bring their motion to a vote. The presiding officers of the assembly were the prytaneis, randomly selected councilmen from whichever tribe was assigned to oversee the assembly in a given month; at each meeting of the assembly, one of the prytaneis was appointed epistates, or president of the assembly.Kagan, The Peloponnesian War, 465 By chance, the philosopher Socrates, holding public office for the only time in his life, was epistates on the day that the generals were tried. Declaring that he would \\"do nothing that was contrary to the law\\",Xenophon, Hellenica 1.7.15 Socrates refused to put the measure to a vote. Emboldened, Euryptolemus rose again to speak, and persuaded the assembly to pass a motion ordering that the generals be tried separately. Parliamentary maneuvering, however, undid this victory, and in the end the original motion was carried; a vote was taken, and all six generals were found guilty and executed, including Pericles the Younger. The Athenians soon came to regret their decision in the case of the generals, and charges were brought against the principal instigators of the executions. These men escaped before they could be brought to trial, but Callixeinus did return to Athens several years later; despised by his fellow citizens, he died of starvation.Xenophon, Hellenica 1.7.35 = Peace offer = At Sparta, the defeat at Arginusae added to a long list of setbacks since the war in the Aegean had begun in 412 BC. The fleet, now stationed at Chios, was in poor condition, Spartans at home were discouraged, and supporters of Callicratidas were displeased by the notion that his rival Lysander would rise to power again if the war were to continue (Sparta's allies in the Aegean were demanding his return).Kagan, The Peloponnesian War, 467-68 With all these concerns in mind, the Spartan government dispatched an embassy to Athens, offering to surrender the Spartan fort at Decelea in return for peace on the basis of the status quo in the Aegean.Aristotle, Constitution of the Athenians, 34 This proposal, however, was rejected by the Athenian assembly at the urging of Cleophon. The war continued, but Athens' decision was to prove costly less than a year later when Lysander, in command of the Spartan fleet once more, decisively defeated the Athenian fleet at Aegospotami; within two years of the dramatic Athenian victory at Arginusae, the city surrendered and its walls were torn down.

The game progresses by counting up from 1 to 21, with the player who calls \\"21\\" suffering a drinking penalty before the next round starts. The loser may add one new rule to the game, and starts the new round. Rules Players are arranged in a circle, facing inwards. The game begins with one player calling the direction of play by saying, \\"I propose a game of XXXX! To my left...\\" or \\"To my right...\\" followed by a sequential series of numbers beginning with one. Variations exist for the proposal of the game depending on personal rules; this is due to some variants calling for any person who says the number \\"21\\" to drink. For example: * \\"I propose a game of 21!\\" * \\"I propose a game of 20...22!\\" * \\"I propose a game of twenty plus one!\\" * \\"I propose a game of the unspeakable number!\\" As the game progresses, each player in turn must recite one to four numbers, counting in sequence from where the previous player left off: * Saying one number (e.g. \\"one\\") passes the game to the next player in the circle in the initial direction. * Saying two numbers (e.g. \\"one, two\\") passes to the next player, but reverses direction. * Saying three numbers (e.g. \\"one, two, three\\") passes in the initial direction, but skips a player. * Saying four numbers (e.g. \\"one, two, three, four\\") reverses direction and skips a player. If a player makes a mistake, then they suffer a small to moderate drinking penalty (e.g. 2 fingers of drink) and then restart the game from 1. Mistakes include: * Hesitating to continue the game. * Calling the wrong number. * Calling a number out of turn. * Breaching any original or instated rule. Assuming there are no mistakes, the game will continue in sequence up to 21. The player who calls 21 suffers a heavy drinking penalty (e.g. finishing their drink), creates a new rule, then restarts the game from 1. Additional rules Variations on the standard rules include: * Prohibiting three players calling single numbers in a row. * \\"Doubling a double\\" - prohibits saying two numbers after two numbers. * \\"Tripling a triple\\" - prohibits either saying three numbers after three numbers, or after 2 sets of three numbers. * \\"Reversing into a hole\\" - prohibits saying two numbers after three numbers. * Prohibiting calling out a series of numbers that sum to 21 (e.g. \\"6, 7, 8\\" or \\"10, 11\\") Examples of new rules that could be instated by a player forced to call 21: * Swapping two numbers around (e.g. 3 and 13 are switched) * Replacing a number with a humorous phrase (e.g. replacing 5 with \\"skin\\" - causing the sequence 1, 2, 3, \\"foreskin\\") * Instating an underlying set of rules (e.g. left hand drinking) * Thumb master - the last player to place their thumb on the table following the thumb master must drink. * Head master - as with thumb master, but replacing the thumb with the head * Pose master - the last player to strike a pose following the pose master must drink. It is also commonplace to declare (either at the start of the game or as an additional rule) that the game be played according to the so-called \\"International Drinking Rules\\". These are a body of generally accepted but not entirely uniform rules that players understand to apply to all drinking activity and include rules for example, that drinkers must keep their little finger up whilst drinking, only drink with their left hand and, in some circles, that using the word 'drink' be prohibited and replaced with words such as 'consume' or 'imbibe'. Example The events of the example game. Andy, Bill, Cath, Dan, Ed and Fran are sitting with Andy at 12 o'clock, and the other players arranged clockwise in alphabetical order: # Andy: I propose a game of 21!

She is penalised 2 fingers of drink. # Cath drinks # Cath: I propose a game of 21! To my right: 1. {‚Üí Bill} # Bill: 2. {‚Üí Andy} The game ultimately finishes when all the numbers have been replaced, by rule changes instigated by the person who drinks on 21. Variations * Using Roman numerals. Replacing the Roman numerals with other humorous or explicit phrases can make the game more interesting (e.g. replace I with \\"No\\", V with \\"Daddy\\" and X with \\"Don't touch me!\\") * Using the binary number system. * Replacing numbers with themed sets of phrases.

In the field of molecular biology, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are a group of nuclear receptor proteins that function as transcription factors regulating the expression of genes. PPARs play essential roles in the regulation of cellular differentiation, development, and metabolism (carbohydrate, lipid, protein), and tumorigenesis of higher organisms.  Nomenclature and tissue distribution  Three types of PPARs have been identified: alpha, gamma, and delta (beta): * Œ± (alpha) - expressed in liver, kidney, heart, muscle, adipose tissue, and others * Œ≤/Œ¥ (beta/delta) - expressed in many tissues but markedly in brain, adipose tissue, and skin * Œ≥ (gamma) - although transcribed by the same gene, this PPAR through alternative splicing is expressed in three forms: ** Œ≥1 - expressed in virtually all tissues, including heart, muscle, colon, kidney, pancreas, and spleen ** Œ≥2 - expressed mainly in adipose tissue (30 amino acids longer than Œ≥1) ** Œ≥3 - expressed in macrophages, large intestine, white adipose tissue. = History = PPARs were originally identified in Xenopus frogs as receptors that induce the proliferation of peroxisomes in cells. The first PPAR (PPARŒ±) was discovered during the search of a molecular target for a group of agents then referred to as peroxisome proliferators, as they increased peroxisomal numbers in rodent liver tissue, apart from improving insulin sensitivity. These agents, pharmacologically related to the fibrates were discovered in the early 1980s. When it turned out that PPARs played a much more versatile role in biology, the agents were in turn termed PPAR ligands. The best-known PPAR ligands are the thiazolidinediones; see below for more details. After PPARŒ¥ (delta) was identified in humans in 1992, it turned out to be closely related to the PPARŒ≤ (beta) previously described during the same year in other animals (Xenopus). The name PPARŒ¥ is generally used in the US, whereas the use of the PPARŒ≤ denomination has remained in Europe where this receptor was initially discovered in Xenopus.  Physiological function  All PPARs heterodimerize with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and bind to specific regions on the DNA of target genes. These DNA sequences are termed PPREs (peroxisome proliferator hormone response elements). The DNA consensus sequence is AGGTCANAGGTCA, with N being any nucleotide. In general, this sequence occurs in the promoter region of a gene, and, when the PPAR binds its ligand, transcription of target genes is increased or decreased, depending on the gene. The RXR also forms a heterodimer with a number of other receptors (e.g., vitamin D and thyroid hormone). The function of PPARs is modified by the precise shape of their ligand-binding domain (see below) induced by ligand binding and by a number of coactivator and corepressor proteins, the presence of which can stimulate or inhibit receptor function, respectively. Endogenous ligands for the PPARs include free fatty acids, eicosanoids and Vitamin B3. PPARŒ≥ is activated by PGJ2 (a prostaglandin) and certain members of the 5-HETE family of arachidonic acid metabolites including 5-oxo-15(S)-HETE and 5-oxo- ETE.Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1736:228-236, 2005 In contrast, PPARŒ± is activated by leukotriene B4. Certain members of the 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid family of arachidonic acid metabolites, including 15(S)-HETE, 15(R)-HETE, and 15-HpETE activate to varying degrees PPAR alpha, beta/delta, and gamma.Mol. Pharmacol. 77-171-184, 2010 PPARŒ≥ activation by agonist RS5444 may inhibit anaplastic thyroid cancer growth. SeeCurr. Mol. Med. 7:532-540, 2007 for a review and critique of the roles of PPAR gamma in cancer.  Genetics  The three main forms are transcribed from different genes: * PPARŒ± - chromosome 22q12-13.1 (OMIM 170998) * PPARŒ≤/Œ¥ - chromosome 6p21.2-21.1 (OMIM 600409) * PPARŒ≥ - chromosome 3p25 (OMIM 601487). Hereditary disorders of all PPARs have been described, generally leading to a loss in function and concomitant lipodystrophy, insulin resistance, and/or acanthosis nigricans. Of PPARŒ≥, a gain-of-function mutation has been described and studied (Pro12Ala) which decreased the risk of insulin resistance; it is quite prevalent (allele frequency 0.03 - 0.12 in some populations). In contrast, pro115gln is associated with obesity. Some other polymorphisms have high incidence in populations with elevated body mass indexes.  Structure  Like other nuclear receptors, PPARs are modular in structure and contain the following functional domains: * (A/B) N-terminal region * (C) DBD (DNA-binding domain) * (D) flexible hinge region * (E) LBD (ligand binding domain) * (F) C-terminal region The DBD contains two zinc finger motifs, which bind to specific sequences of DNA known as hormone response elements when the receptor is activated. The LBD has an extensive secondary structure consisting of 13 alpha helices and a beta sheet. Natural and synthetic ligands bind to the LBD, either activating or repressing the receptor.  Pharmacology and PPAR modulators  PPARŒ± and PPARŒ≥ are the molecular targets of a number of marketed drugs. For instance the hypolipidemic fibrates activate PPARŒ±, and the anti diabetic thiazolidinediones activate PPARŒ≥. The synthetic chemical perfluorooctanoic acid activates PPARŒ± while the synthetic perfluorononanoic acid activates both PPARŒ± and PPARŒ≥. Berberine activates PPARŒ≥, as well as other natural compounds from different chemical classes.

Acknowledgments are distinct from jurats, verifications, and attestations. A jurat differs from an acknowledgement in that a jurat lacks the statement that the instrument is the act or deed of the party executing it. A verification is distinct in that it seeks to verify the factual contents of the instrument, rather than the instrument itself. Finally, an attestation occurs where a third person gives his or her name as a witness to the actual execution of an instrument.

He is regarded as one of the most important Barbary corsairs.  Early career  Born into an Albanian family on Rhodes in 1534 he began his career when he joined the crew of Turgut Reis at a very young age. He also fought alongside Piri Reis in several expeditions. In 1534 Murat Reis accompanied Hayreddin Barbarossa Pasha to Constantinople where they were received by Suleiman I and appointed to take command of the Ottoman fleet. While in Constantinople, Murat Reis participated in the construction of new warships at the naval arsenal on the Golden Horn.  Battle of Preveza  Murat Reis fought in the center-rear wing of Turgut Reis at the naval Battle of Preveza in 1538 Murat Reis took part in all of the early naval campaigns of Turgut Reis. On September 25 and 26, 1538, he was assigned with the task of preventing the ships of the Holy League under the command of Andrea Doria from landing at Preveza, and he successfully repulsed them from the shoreline. On September 28, he took part in the main combat and played an important role in the Ottoman victory at the Battle of Preveza, where he fought along with Turgut Reis in the center-rear wing of the Ottoman fleet which had a Y-shaped battle configuration. He continued to accompany Turgut Reis until being assigned as the Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Ocean fleet.  Siege and conquest of Cyprus  In 1570 Murat Reis, in command of a fleet of 25 galleys, was assigned with the task of clearing the area between Crete, Rhodes and Cyprus for the build-up of the naval siege and eventual conquest of Cyprus. He was also assigned with the task of blocking the Venetian ships based in Crete from sailing to Cyprus and assisting the Venetian forces in that island. He continued to undertake this task until the eventual surrender of Famagusta, the final Venetian stronghold on the island.  Canary Islands  In 1585 he led the first expedition of the Barbary corsairs in the Atlantic ocean and captured several of the Canary Islands. During the attacks, among others he captured the Spanish governor of Lanzarote, who was later ransomed and released.  Mediterranean campaigns  Murat Reis was later assigned with the task of controlling the lucrative trade routes between Egypt and Anatolia which were often raided by the Venetians, the French and the Maltese Knights. In 1609, he heard of the presence of a joint French-Maltese fleet of ten galleys, including the famous Galeona Rossa, a large galleon armed with 90 cannons which was known among the Ottomans as the Red Inferno, under the command of a knight named Fresine, off the island of Cyprus, and sailed there to engage them. After successfully striking the enemy ships with cannons from both long distance and close range, he severely damaged the Red Inferno and captured the ship. Six out of the ten French-Maltese galleys were captured, along with the 500 soldiers aboard, and the total of 160 cannons and 2000 muskets which they carried. During the battle Murat Reis was seriously injured. In 1609 he took part in the siege of Vlor√´, during which he died.  Legacy  Several submarines of the Turkish Navy have been named after Murat Reis (see Oru√ß Reis class submarine). One of the municipalities that form the City of Algiers, which was once the regional capital of the Ottoman Vilayet of Algeria (1517‚Äì1830), is named Bir Mourad Ra√Øs (Murat Reis' well) in his honor. Under the name 'Morato Arr√°ez, he is mentioned in several literary works of the Spanish Golden Age, for example by Miguel de Cervantes and Lope de Vega.

On 27 July 1765, he was initiated into the Masonic Order. In the late summer of 1767, on his way to Genoa, the duke fell ill and had to be landed in the harbour of Monaco. Despite the care and attention he was given, he died in the Palace of Honor√© III, Prince of Monaco, on 17 September. The state bedchamber where the ill duke died has since been known as the York Room. After his death, his body was returned to London aboard , and is interred in Westminster Abbey.

The dedication reads: *Prince Edward is an important character in Norah Lofts' historical novel The Lost Queen (1969), chronicling the life of his youngest sister, Caroline Matilda, Queen Consort of Denmark and Norway as wife of King Christian VII. Edward is mentioned as having had a special link with her, stronger than with his other siblings.

Born Giovanni Dionigi Galeni, he was also known by several other names in the Christian countries of the Mediterranean and in the literature also appears under various names. Miguel de Cervantes called him Uchali in chapter XXXIX of his Don Quixote de la Mancha. Elsewhere he was simply called Ali Pasha. John Wolf, in his The Barbary Coast, refers to him as Euldj Ali.  Early life  Giovanni Dionigi Galeni was born to the seaman Birno Galeni and his wife Pippa de Cicco, in the village of Le Castella (near modern Isola Capo Rizzuto) in Calabria, southern Italy.Corsari nel Mediterraneo: Ulu√ß Ali Reis (Occhiali, Uluj Ali) His father wanted him to receive a religious education, but on 29 April 1536, when he was about 17, Giovanni was captured by Ali Ahmed, one of the corsair captains of Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha, and was forced to serve as a galley slave. As an oar slave in an Ottoman galley, he participated in the Battle of Preveza in 1538. Within a few years, he converted to Islam and became a corsair in the fleet of Turgut Reis by 1541. This was by no means unusual; many Muslim corsairs (privateers) were captured slaves who later converted to Islam. He was a very able mariner and soon rose in the ranks, gaining sufficient prize booty to buy a share in a corsair brigantine sailing out of Algiers. Further success soon enabled him to become the captain and owner of a galley, and he gained a reputation as one of the boldest corsair reis on the Barbary Coast. Uluj Ali was in the fleet of Turgut Reis, one of the most famous corsairs in the Mediterranean, as well as an Ottoman admiral and Bey of Tripoli. Sailing with Turgut Reis, he also impressed the Ottoman admiral Piyale Pasha, with whom Turgut joined forces on a number of occasions. Due to his success in battles, the administration of the island of Samos in the Aegean Sea was awarded to him in 1550. In 1560, he was among the forces of Turgut Reis and Piyale Pasha during the Battle of Djerba.Bizimsahife.com: Battle of Djerba (1560) In 1565 he was promoted to the rank of Beylerbey (Chief Governor) of Alexandria. The same year he joined the Siege of Malta with the Ottoman Egyptian fleet, and when Turgut Reis was killed during the siege, Piyale Pasha appointed Uluj Ali to become Turgut's successor as Bey of Tripoli. Uluj took Turgut's body to Tripoli for burial, assumed control of the province, and was subsequently confirmed as Pasha of Tripoli by Sultan Suleiman I. In the following years he conducted numerous raids on the coasts of Sicily, Calabria and Naples.  Pasha of Algiers  In March 1568, the vice-regency of Algiers fell vacant, and upon the recommendation of Piyale Pasha, Sultan Selim II appointed Uluj Ali to become the Pasha and Beylerbey of Algiers, the most powerful of the increasingly autonomous Ottoman eyalets in North Africa, which were governed by the corsair-admirals appointed by the Sultan. In October 1569 he turned upon the Hafsid Sultan Hamid of Tunis, who had been restored to his throne by Spain. Marching overland with an army of some 5000, he quickly sent Hamid and his forces fleeing and made himself ruler of Tunis. Hamid found refuge in the Spanish fort at La Goulette outside Tunis. In July 1570, while ostensibly en route to Constantinople to ask the Sultan for more ships and men in order to evict the Spaniards from all of North Africa, Uluj Ali encountered five Maltese galleys, commanded by Francisco de Sant Clement, then the captain-general of the Order's galleys, near Cape Passaro in Sicily and captured four of them in the action of 1570. (Sant Clement escaped, but on returning to Malta was condemned, strangled and his body put in a sack and dumped into the harbor.) This victory caused Uluj to change his mind and return to Algiers in order to celebrate. There, in early 1571, he was faced with a mutiny of the janissaries who demanded overdue pay. He decided to put to sea, leaving the mutinous soldiers to take their pay from anyone they could find and rob. Having learned of the presence of a large Ottoman fleet at Coron in the Morea, he decided to join it. It was the fleet commanded by M√ºezzinzade Ali Pasha that was to meet disaster at Lepanto a few months later.  Lepanto  On 7 October 1571, Uluj Ali commanded the left flank of Ali Pasha's fleet in the Battle of Lepanto. He kept his squadron together in the melee, outmaneuvered his direct opponent, Giovanni Andrea Doria, and captured the flagship of the Maltese Knights with its great banner. When the Ottoman defeat became obvious, he succeeded in extricating his ships, and gathered up the scattered remaining ships of the Ottoman fleet (some forty galleys and fustas) and others along the way to Constantinople, where he arrived with 87 vessels. There he presented the great flag of the Knights of Malta to Sultan Selim II, who gave him the honorary title of Kƒ±lƒ±√ß (\\"Sword\\") and on 29 October 1571 appointed him as Kapudan Pasha (Grand Admiral) and Beylerbey of the Isles. He was subsequently known as Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Ali Pasha.  Kapudan Pasha (1572 ‚Äì 1587)  Piyale Pasha and Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Ali Pasha immediately began to rebuild the Ottoman fleet. Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Ali Pasha placed special emphasis on the construction of a number of heavier ships modeled upon the Venetian galleasses, heavier artillery for the galleys, and firearms for the soldiers on board. In June 1572, now Kapudan Pasha, he set out with 250 galleys and a large number of smaller ships to seek revenge for Lepanto. He found the Christian fleet anchored in an inlet of Morea, but his strategy of trying to lure the enemy out and inflicting damage through repeated quick thrusts meant that a full-fledged battle never materialized, because the Christian fleet was too cautious to be trapped and encircled. In 1573 Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Ali Pasha commanded the naval campaign on the coasts of Italy. In that same year, the regency of Algiers was transferred to Arab Ahmed, and Don Juan of Austria, the victor of Lepanto, recaptured Tunis. In July 1574, Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Ali Pasha sailed to Tunis with a fleet of 250 galleys and a large army under the command of Cigalazade Sinan Pasha, captured the port fortress of La Goleta on 25 August 1574, and the city of Tunis on 13 September 1574. During this expedition, on 26 July 1574, the forces of Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Ali Pasha constructed an Ottoman fortress on the coastline of Morocco, facing Andalusia in mainland Spain.Tarih Sitesi: Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Ali Pa≈üa In 1576 he raided Calabria and in 1578 put down another mutiny of the janissaries in Algiers who had assassinated Arab Ahmed. In 1584 he commanded a naval expedition to Crimea. In 1585 he put down revolts in Syria and Lebanon with the Ottoman Egyptian fleet based in Alexandria. Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Ali Pasha died on 21 June 1587 in Constantinople (Istanbul). He is buried at the Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Ali Pa≈üa Mosque (1580), designed by the renowned architect Mimar Sinan.  Legacy  * He built the Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Ali Pa≈üa Mosque (1580) and Baths (1583) in Istanbul. * Several warships and submarines of the Turkish Navy have been named after him (see Kƒ±lƒ±√ß class fast attack missile boat and Oru√ß Reis class submarine). * His statue is in the center square of Le Castella in Calabria, Italy, where he was born.

After Argentinian President Juan Per√≥n died, the students from the left of the Peronist political party organized with fervor within the country's universities and with workers, were persecuted and imprisoned. There was a military coup in 1976 and people began to disappear. Partnoy was one of those who suffered through the ordeals of becoming a political prisoner. She became an activist of the Peronist Youth Movement while attending Southern National University (see Education). She was taken from her home, leaving behind her 18-month-old daughter, on January 12, 1977, by the Argentinian Army and imprisoned at a concentration camp named The Little School (La Escuelita). For three and a half months, Partnoy was blindfolded. She was brutally beaten, starved, molested, and forced to live in inhuman conditions. She was moved from the concentration camp to the prison of Villa Floresta in Bah√≠a Blanca where she stayed for six months only to be transferred to Villa Devoto prison in Buenos Aires. She spent two and a half years as a prisoner of conscience, with no charges. In 1979, she was forced to leave the country, coming to the U.S. as a refugee with her daughter where they were reunited with her husband in Seattle, Washington. In 1985, she told her story of what had happened to her at The Little School, in an eponymous book. The world began to open its eyes to the treatment of women in reference to the disappearances of Latin Americans. Alicia Partnoy has testified before the United Nations, the Organization of American States, Amnesty International, and the Argentine Human Rights Commission. Her testimony is recorded in a compilation of testimonials by the National Commission for the Investigation of the Disappeared. She currently lives in Los Angeles, California, CA and teaches at Loyola Marymount University. In June 2007, a collection of her poems appeared in the second issue of the avant-garde Hebrew poetry and criticism magazine Daka rendered by Eran Tzelgov.  Education  Alicia Partnoy worked towards a bachelor's degree in Literature at the Universidad Nacional del Sur, in Bah√≠a Blanca, Argentina. After her three years as a political prisoner, once in exile, she would continue her studies at the University of the District of Columbia and at the American University, where she obtained a Certificate in Translation. She holds a Master's degree and a PhD from the Catholic University of America.  Career  Over the years, Alicia Partnoy has served as part-time lecturer and visiting professor at several institutions. Since 1998 she has been at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, California, where she is a professor in the Department of Modern Languages and Literatures.  Publications  Alicia Partnoy is the author, translator or editor of twelve books and a chapbook. Partnoy's most famous work is her book The Little School: Tales of Disappearance and Survival in Argentina, written originally in Spanish (La Escuelita: Relatos testimoniales), but published in her home country, Argentina, twenty years after the English edition was released in the U.S. and England. A French translation has been published by Zinnia Editions, and a Bengali translation by an alternative publishing house in Kolkata, was published in 2015. A Hebrew translation is forthcoming. Partnoy also authored the following poetry collections: Flowering Fires / Fuegos florales, Venganza de la manzana / Revenge of the Apple, and Volando bajito / Little Low Flying, as well as the chapbook Ecos l√≥gicos y otros poemares and, with her daughter Ruth Irup√© Sanabria, the children's book ¬°Escuch√°! Cuentos y versitos para los m√°s chiquitos, which includes poetry and short stories sent to Ruth from the Villa Devoto prison where her mother was held prisoner. Additionally, Partnoy edited the books Para mi hija Silvia / For My Daughter Silvia (by author Evangelina Arce, a mother of Ciudad Juarez), Las ramas hacia el mundo: antolog√≠a familiar, You Can't Drown the Fire: Latin American Women Writing in Exile, and, with Christina Fialho and Kristina Shull, Call Me Libertad: Poems between Borders. Partnoy has written numerous academic articles and has contributed chapters to Women Writing Resistance: Essays on Latin America and the Caribbean, Loss and Hope: Global, Interreligious and Interdisciplinary Perspectives, and Representing Humanity in an Age of Terror. Partnoy most recently co-authored with Martina Ramirez Happier as a Woman: Transforming Friendships, Transforming Lives.

She was given a life sentence for the attempted assassination and was released from prison on December 31, 2007, after serving 32 years. Moore and Lynette \\"Squeaky\\" Fromme are the only two women to have attempted to assassinate an American president; both of their attempts were on Gerald Ford and both took place in California within three weeks of one another. Background Moore was born in Charleston, West Virginia, the daughter of Ruth (n√©e Moore) and Olaf Kahn. Her paternal grandparents were German immigrants. Moore had been a nursing school student, Women's Army Corps recruit, and accountant. Divorced five times, she had four children before she turned to revolutionary politics in 1975. Moore comes from a Christian background. She later began practicing Judaism. Moore's friends said that she had a fascination and an obsession with Patricia Hearst. After Hearst was kidnapped by the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA), her father Randolph Hearst created the organization People In Need (PIN) to feed the poor as a response to the SLA's claims that the elder Hearst was \\"committing 'crimes' against 'the people. Moore, a volunteer bookkeeper for PIN, had been serving as an FBI informant there until the moment she attempted to assassinate Ford. Attempted assassination of Gerald Ford Reaction right after the assassination attempt Moore had been evaluated by the Secret Service earlier in 1975, but agents decided that she posed no danger to the president. She had been picked up by police on an illegal-handgun charge the day before the Ford incident, but was released. The police confiscated her .44 caliber revolver and 113 rounds of ammunition. Moore's assassination attempt took place in San Francisco on September 22, 1975, just 17 days after Lynette \\"Squeaky\\" Fromme's attempted assassination of Ford. She was standing in the crowd across the street from the St. Francis Hotel, and was about away from Ford when she fired a single shot at him with a .38 caliber revolver. She was using a gun she bought in haste that same morning and did not know the sights were 15 cm (6 inches) off the point-of-impact at that distance, and she narrowly missed. After realizing she had missed, she raised her arm again, and Oliver Sipple, a former Marine, dived towards her and grabbed her arm, possibly saving Ford's life. Sipple said at the time: \\"I saw [her gun] pointed out there and I grabbed for it. [...] I lunged and grabbed the woman's arm and the gun went off.\\"Seattle Times. \\"Ford 'won't cower' after shooting.\\" September 23, 1975. The bullet from the second shot ricocheted and hit John Ludwig, a 42-year-old taxi driver. Ludwig survived.Caught in Fate's Trajectory, Along With Gerald Ford, Lynne Duke, The Washington Post, December 30, 2006, p. D01. U.S. District Judge Samuel Conti, who sentenced Moore, voiced his opinion that Moore would have killed Ford had she had her own gun, and it was only \\"because her gun was faulty\\" that the president's life was spared. Trial and imprisonment Moore pleaded guilty to attempted assassination and was sentenced to life in prison. At her sentencing hearing Moore stated: \\"Am I sorry I tried? Yes and no. Yes, because it accomplished little except to throw away the rest of my life. And, no, I'm not sorry I tried, because at the time it seemed a correct expression of my anger.\\" She served her term at the federal women's prison in Dublin, California, where she worked in the UNICOR prison labor program for $1.25 per hour as the Lead Inmate Operating Accountant. Moore had the Federal Bureau of Prisons register number 04851-180.\\"Sara Jane Moore.\\" Federal Bureau of Prisons. Retrieved on January 9, 2010. In an interview in 2004, former President Ford described Moore as \\"off her mind\\" and said that he continued making public appearances, even after two attempts on his life within such a short time, because \\"a president has to be aggressive, has to meet the people.\\" =Release= On December 31, 2007, at age 77, Moore was slated to be released from prison on parole after serving 32 years of her life sentence. Ford had died from natural causes on December 26, 2006, one year and five days before her release. Moore has stated that she regrets the assassination attempt, saying she was \\"blinded by her radical political views\\". Moore was released under a federal law that makes parole mandatory for inmates who have served at least 30 years of a life sentence and have maintained a satisfactory disciplinary record. When asked about her crime in an interview, Moore stated, \\"I am very glad I did not succeed. I know now that I was wrong to try.\\" In February 2019, Moore was arrested for violating her parole by failing to tell her parole officer of a trip out of the country. Media On May 28, 2009, Moore appeared on NBC's Today program, her first television appearance since leaving prison on parole.NBC News msnbc.com Moore also discussed her 1979 escape from prison. She revealed that an inmate told her, \\"when jumping the fence just put your hand on the barbed wire, you'll only have a few puncture wounds.\\" She went on to say, \\"If I knew that I was going to be captured several hours later, I would have stopped at the local bar just to get a drink and a burger.\\" Excerpts from an interview with Moore by Latif Nasser appear on an episode of the radio program Radiolab titled \\"Oliver Sipple\\", which was released on September 22, 2017. In the interview, Moore discusses the scene from the day she attempted to assassinate President Ford and her perspective of being stopped by Oliver Sipple. Trivia Moore's story is one of nine assassins starring in Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman's musical Assassins. Moore, John Wilkes Booth, Charles J. Guiteau and Leon Czolgosz appear in \\"The Gun Song\\". A biography of Moore called Taking Aim at the President was published in 2009 by Geri Spieler, a writer who had a correspondence with Moore for 28 years.

Established in the 1980s in Roy, Utah, as Iomega, LenovoEMC has sold more than 410 million digital storage drives and disks. It was formerly a public company. The Zip drive was Iomega's most notable product.International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 21. St. James Press, 1998. Operations Lenovo announced the construction of a research and development facility near S√£o Paulo, Brazil, in November 2013. This facility will be dedicated to enterprise software and supporting LenovoEMC's development of high-end servers and cloud storage. Construction will cost $100 million and about 100 will be employed at the facility. It will be located in the University of Campinas Science and Technology Park, about 60 miles from S√£o Paulo.  History  Iomega logo Iomega started business in Roy, Utah in 1980 (the firm moved its headquarters to San Diego in 2001). For many years, the firm was a significant name in the data storage industry. Iomega's most famous product, the Zip Drive, was revolutionary as it offered relatively large amounts of storage on easily portable compact cartridges. The original Zip disk's 100MB capacity was a huge improvement over the 1.44MB limitation of floppy disks. The Zip Drive became a common internal and external peripheral for IBM-compatible computers and Macs. However, Zip disk cartridges sometimes failed after a short period, (commonly referred to as the \\"click of death\\"). This problem, combined with competition from CD-RW drives, caused Zip Drive sales to decline dramatically, despite later efforts to introduce larger 250MB and 750MB disk versions. Iomega eventually launched a CD-RW drive. Without the revenue from its proprietary storage cartridges, Iomega's sales and profits declined considerably. Iomega's stock price, which was over $100 at its height in the 1990s, dipped to around $2 in the mid-2000s. Trying to find a niche for itself, Iomega released devices such as the HipZip MP3 player, the FotoShow Digital Image Center, and numerous external hard drives, optical drives, and NAS products. None of these products were successful. In 2012, reporter Vincent Verweij of Dutch broadcaster Katholieke Radio Omroep revealed that the contents of at least 16,000 Iomega NAS devices were publicly available on the internet. This was due to the devices being sold with password security disabled by default. Among those affected were KLM, ING Group, and Ballast Nedam, who all had confidential material leaked in this manner. Iomega USA acknowledged the problem and said future models (starting February 2013) would come with password security enabled by default. The company said it would clearly instruct users about the risks of unsecured data.\\"A Gift for the Hackers\\", produced by Katholieke Radio Omroep, distributed on YouTube by Journeyman Pictures =Acquisition by EMC= The signing ceremony that created LenovoEMC joint venture On April 8, 2008, EMC Corporation announced plans to acquire Iomega for US$213 million.Press release EMC To Acquire Iomega.

The document has been lost and now only survives in two sets of photographs. The text purports to be an epistle of Clement of Alexandria and contains the only known references to a \\"Secret Gospel of Mark\\". Discovery and disappearance In 1973 Morton Smith published a book on a previously unknown letter of Clement of Alexandria.Morton Smith, Clement of Alexandria and a Secret Gospel of Mark (Harvard University Press) 1973 He stated that, while cataloging documents at the ancient monastery of Mar Saba in the summer of 1958, he discovered the text of the letter handwritten into the endpapers of Isaac Vossius' 1646 printed edition of the works of Ignatius of Antioch. This letter is consequently referred to as the Mar Saba letter of Clement of Alexandria. Smith also published a second book for the popular audience in 1974.Morton Smith, The Secret Gospel: The Discovery and Interpretation of the Secret Gospel According to Mark, London Victor Gollancz Ltd. 1974 . Smith's books reproduced black-and-white photographs which he stated he had taken at the time of the discovery. In 1976 a group of four scholarsProfessors David Flusser and Shlomo Pines, both of the Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Archimandrite Meliton of the Patriarchate, and G.A.G. Stroumsa, at the time a Harvard graduate student. visited Mar Saba, and viewed the manuscript. This visit remained unknown until 2003 when one of the party, G.A.G. Stroumsa, published an account of the visit.Gedaliahu A. G. Stroumsa, \\"Comments on Charles Hedrick's article: a testimony\\", Journal of Early Christian Studies 11.2 (Summer 2003), pp 147-53. In 1977 the volume containing the manuscript was taken to the library of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate in Jerusalem. That same year, the manuscript pages were removed from the bound volume by the librarian Kallistos Dourvas, to be photographed and kept separately. These photographs were published in 2000. Subsequent attempts by scholars to view the manuscript have been unsuccessful. Paleographers, working from Smith's photographs, have assigned dates from the late seventeenth to the early nineteenth centuries.Merkel, Helmut. Auf den Spuren des Urmarkus? Ein neuer Fund und seine Beurteilung. Zeitschrift f√ºr Theologie und Kirche 71 (1974): 123-144. p. 106 Text The letter, addressed to one Theodore, discusses a \\"Secret Gospel of Mark\\" and quotes two excerpts from this gospel, one of which mentions \\"the mystery of the kingdom of God.\\" Clement begins by commending Theodore's actions against the Carpocratians. He then turns to address questions posed by Theodore regarding the Gospel of Mark, a secret variant of which the Carpocratians claim to have. Clement admits to knowledge of a second secret or mystical version of the gospel, written by Mark for \\"those being perfected\\". However, he asserts that the version promoted by the Carpocratians is not an accurate representation of this; they have corrupted the original with their own false additions. To illustrate this, two ostensibly genuine excerpts from the gospel are supplied. The letter breaks off abruptly as Clement begins to explain the passages. Controversy over authenticity Scholars Philip Jenkins and Robert M. Price noticed parallels between The Secret Gospel of Mark and a novel by James Hunter published in 1940 entitled The Mystery of Mar Saba.Hypotyposeis blogEvans, Craig A. Exploring the origins of the Bible: canon formation in historical, 2008 p. 272: \\"The entire story ‚Äî finding a long-lost document in the Mar Saba Monastery that is potentially embarrassing to Christianity ‚Äî is adumbrated by James Hunter's The Mystery of Mar Saba. Indeed, one of the heroes of the story, who helps to unmask the perpetrators and expose the fraud, is Scotland Yard Inspector Lord Moreton.\\" In 1980 the Mar Saba letter was included in the revision of the standard edition of works of Clement of Alexandria: Otto St√§hlin and Ursula Treu, Clemens Alexandrinus, vol. 4.1: Register, 2nd ed. (Berlin:Akademie-Verlag, 1980), XVII‚ÄìXVIII. Nevertheless, doubts have been expressed about its authenticity. In a 1975 review of Smith's book, Quentin Quesnell raised doubts about the original manuscript and suggested that it was a forgery executed sometime between 1936 and 1958. Though Quesnell did not specifically accuse Smith, in the view of Charles W. Hedrick he \\"broadly hinted\\" that Smith was the culprit. When Quesnell wrote this, no scholar other than Smith had reported having seen the manuscript. In 2005 Stephen Carlson published Gospel Hoax: Morton Smith's Invention of Secret Mark, which also asserted that the manuscript was a hoax. By this time independent confirmation of the manuscript's existence and appearance had been presented by Hedrick and others; Carlson argued that Smith had himself written the text into the book. Earlier in the same year, Scott Brown published Mark's Other Gospel: Rethinking Morton Smith's Controversial Discovery. In this book he wrote that the Secret Gospel of Mark was an authentic writing of the evangelist. Many scholars who accept the letter as a copy of an ancient manuscript believe that it is not the work of the historical Clement. There seems to have been another pseudo-Clement, who was mentioned in the Decretum Gelasianum as \\"the other Clement of Alexandria.\\"The Development of the Canon of the New Testament - The Decretum Gelasianum The central element of initiation and progress to \\"the innermost sanctuary of that truth hidden by seven veils\\" is common to Gnostic writings and to the mystery religions of the period. Even so, Clement believed Christianity to be the pure representative of God's true Mysteries which others had stolen and corrupted: > Haste, Tiresias; believe, and thou wilt see. Christ, by whom the eyes of the > blind recover sight, will shed on thee a light brighter than the sun; night > will flee from thee, fire will fear, death will be gone; thou, old man, who > saw not Thebes, shalt see the heavens. O truly sacred mysteries! O stainless > light! My way is lighted with torches, and I survey the heavens and God; I > become holy whilst I am initiated. The Lord is the hierophant, and seals > while illuminating him who is initiated, and presents to the Father him who > believes, to be kept safe for ever. Such are the reveries of my mysteries. > If it is thy wish, be thou also initiated; and thou shall join the choir > along with angels around the unbegotten and indestructible and the only true > God, the Word of God, raising the hymn with us. ‚Äî Clement, Exhortation to > the Heathen, xii Whether or not the document is a forgery, and if so, who the forger might be remains unresolved.Solow, Andrew R., and Woollcott K.

His book Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and its Consequences (1988) was a bestseller and A Mathematician Reads the Newspaper (1995) extended the critique. In his books Paulos discusses innumeracy with quirky anecdotes, scenarios and facts, encouraging readers in the end to look at their world in a more quantitative way. He has also written on other subjects often \\"combining disparate disciplines\\", such as the mathematical and philosophical basis of humor in Mathematics and Humor and I Think, Therefore I Laugh, the stock market in A Mathematician Plays the Stock Market, quantitative aspects of narrative in Once Upon a Number, the arguments for God in Irreligion, and most recently \\"bringing mathematics to bear on...biography\\" in A Numerate Life. Paulos also wrote a mathematics-tinged column for the UK newspaper The Guardian and is a Committee for Skeptical Inquiry fellow. Paulos has appeared frequently on radio and television, including a four-part BBC adaptation of A Mathematician Reads the Newspaper and appearances on the Lehrer News Hour, 20/20, Larry King, and David Letterman. In 2001 Paulos taught a course on quantitative literacy for journalists at the Columbia University School of Journalism. The course stimulated further programs at Columbia and elsewhere in precision and data-driven journalism. His long-running \\"ABCNews.com\\" monthly column Who's CountingWho's Counting at ABC News deals with mathematical aspects of stories in the news.

According to the Book of Mormon, Alma () was a Nephite prophet who established the Church of Jesus Christ in the Americas during the reign of the wicked King Noah. One of the Book of Mormon's greatest figures, he is sometimes referred to as \\"Alma the Elder\\" as seen on the website of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to avoid confusion with his son, also named Alma, who is often called \\"Alma the Younger.\\" It is believed that he was born in roughly 174 BC. and his son Alma the Younger was born in roughly 126 BC. Narrative =Alma's conversion= While a young man, Alma was one of several corrupt priests who served King Noah in the land of Nephi. About 148 BC, a prophet named Abinadi was arrested for preaching repentance and condemning the wickedness of Noah and his people. Brought before the king and his priests, Abinadi emphatically urged them to repent and obey the gospel of Jesus Christ. Of all who heard him, only Alma was touched by Abinadi's words. When Alma began to defend Abinadi the king had Alma cast out and Abinadi burned alive. Fleeing for his life, Alma went into hiding and wrote down what Abinadi had said before the court. Alma began to preach the gospel in secret, emphasizing Abinadi's teachings \\"concerning that which was to come, and also concerning the resurrection of the dead, and the redemption of the people, which was to be brought to pass through the power, and sufferings, and death of Christ, and his resurrection and ascension into heaven\\" (). =Alma's followers= At a hidden retreat in the wilderness called the waters of Mormon, Alma baptized his listeners and organized the church of Christ among them. In time, King Noah found out where Alma's congregation was meeting, and, fearing insurrection, sent his army to destroy them. Being warned by God of the army's coming, Alma quickly led his band of approximately 450 converts into the wilderness for eight days, finally stopping in an uninhabited land which they named Helam. The people of Alma established the city of Helam there and prospered for many years, remaining faithful to God's commandments. =Return to Zarahemla= As the years passed, Alma and his people were discovered by the Lamanites and enslaved, placed under the authority of Amulon‚Äîa former priest of King Noah now united with the Lamanites‚Äîwho began to persecute Alma‚Äôs people, ‚Äúput[ting] tasks upon them, and put[ting] task- masters over them‚Äù (). Finally, in about 120 BC, Alma's people escaped the Lamanites and were led by God through the wilderness for twelve days until they arrived in the land of Zarahemla, then the chief Nephite population center. The people of Alma joyfully united with the Nephites and helped to strengthen the church of Christ in Zarahemla. Zarahemla's King Mosiah soon authorized Alma to serve as the first high priest over the Church in Zarahemla. Alma continued in this capacity for many years. When Alma's son, Alma the Younger, and the four sons of King Mosiah came of age they rebelled against the church and \\"were numbered among the unbelievers\\" (). However, as they went about to destroy the church an angel appeared and, in an experience similar to that of Saul on the road to Damascus, they were all converted. Like Saul, their subsequent efforts on behalf of the church overshadowed their previous efforts to destroy the church. Shortly before his death, Alma conferred the office of high priest upon his son. The Book of Mormon states that Alma the Elder \\"lived to fulfil the commandments of God\\" (). He died in about 91 BC. Descendants Alma had several notable descendants in the Book of Mormon narrative as shown in the family tree below:  Name  At the time Joseph Smith dictated the Book of Mormon, Alma was known only as a woman's name. Recent historical research indicates it may have been a masculine name among Jewish people around 600 B.C., which is the time Lehi left Jerusalem according to the Book of Mormon. A potential Hebrew meaning of the name may be \\"lad of God\\" and ‚ÄúHe [God] is bound.‚Äù Alma may possibly be traced to the Arabic root ‚Äòalama/‚Äô ‚Äòalima, suggesting ‚Äúknowing, erudite; distinguished; chief, chieftain.\\"  See also  * Book of Mosiah * The Record of Zeniff Notes References *.

Founded in 1919, the Moore School is located in Columbia, South Carolina and currently enrolls over 5,500 undergraduate and 800 graduate students in degree-seeking programs, including bachelor's, master's and doctorate degrees. The school is well known for its consistent high rankings in its program for international business. History The University of South Carolina (USC) began efforts to open a school of commerce as early as 1914. USC founded the school in 1919 and dean George Olson firmly established the school by the early 1920s. The school grew with the university, and by 1958, the school established the Master of Business Administration program. By 1963, AACSB gave the school full accreditation. The Professional Master of Business Administration (then called MBA-ETV) started in 1970. The Professional MBA program allows people in South Carolina to receive an MBA by taking part-time classes at remote locations and over the internet. Then in 1974 the school established its Master of International Business (MIBS). National publications hold the program in high esteem and the program continuously garners high rankings in international business. In 1998, Wall Street financier and USC graduate Darla Moore donated $25 million to the business school. In her honor the school was renamed Darla Moore School of Business, although sometimes shortened to the Moore School. The school combined its MIBS and MBA programs to form the International MBA program in 2002. The same year, the school started offering a specialization in international business for undergraduate students as a major. On April 23, 2004 the Moore School announced another gift by Darla Moore. She donated $45 million with the challenge to the university to match that sum. On September 22, 2011, the University of South Carolina broke ground on the new Darla Moore School of Business on Assembly Street next to the Carolina Coliseum. The new Darla Moore School of Business includes 35 classrooms and 136 offices for university faculty. Facilities The new Darla Moore School of Business building In August 2014, the Moore School took occupancy of its new home located at the corner of Assembly and Greene streets in downtown Columbia, SC. The building has created buzz not only for its iconic design by Rafael Vi√±oly Architects of New York, but also for its green features. The building's cantilevered and glass design maximize natural light within and, with its open interior, encourage openness and collaboration. The main level houses a visitors' center, a cafe, a trading room, and an expansive, open-air courtyard. The third and fourth levels will provide views below of the Palmetto Court, a green space that features groupings of sable palms, and the Pavilion, which will be used for lectures and special events. The new school was designed with interaction and collaboration in mind. Every level will have open spaces with flexible furnishings, outlets for technology and white boards that students, faculty, staff and others can use and adapt for meetings or team projects. Even the large open stairwells are designed to encourage interaction. The first floor is the learning level. It will feature a variety of classrooms, all designed with technology and flexibility for student collaboration in mind. It also will feature a 500-seat lecture and performance hall, the result of a partnership with, and support from, the School of Music. The cafe will have extended hours for serving visitors who attend events in the hall. The third floor will feature executive education, classrooms outfitted with advanced telepresence technology, administrative offices and a conference center with meeting spaces. Faculty offices and a research lab are located on the fourth floor. The roof, which will feature green turf to reduce heat and improve energy efficiency, is one of the myriad sustainable features of the building. Its design will maximize natural light and shade for cooling. Occupants will benefit from outdoor views and light, pristine air quality and control of heating, air and lighting in their own spaces. The building's design incorporates goals for earning a LEED Platinum and a Net-Zero rating, meaning that it will generate as much energy as it consumes. The Moore School was selected by the U.S. Energy Department to partner with its national laboratories in its Net-Zero Energy Commercial Building Partnership program. As a result of the partnership, the Moore School has benefitted from expertise in energy technologies and building systems and design and operating practices. Academics =Rank and reputation= U.S. News & World Report in its 2018 annual survey \\"America‚Äôs Best Colleges Guide\\" ranked the Moore School's undergraduate international business degree first in the United States. In the specialty of international business, the publication ranked the school No. 1 in the United States, a position the school has held for sixteen years. On the national level, in the latest ranking of graduate programs by U.S. News & World Report, the Moore School continued as the #1 American university in the international business category. The publication ranked the school #55 in the US in overall graduate business education. The Wall Street Journal ranked the Moore School 49th out of 51 national business schools in a \\"Regional Ranking\\" in the September 20, 2007 edition of the Journal. In the 2010 QS Global 200 Business Schools Report, the Darla Moore School of Business was placed 28th in North America. In the 2010 Public Accounting Report, the Masters of Accounting program was ranked 25th in the country. =Programs= Undergraduate After four years of study, undergraduate students finish their careers at the Darla Moore School of Business with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration degree. The program consist of 121 credit hours and combines a strong liberal arts background with practical business education. The core curriculum that every student studies includes marketing, management, finance and management science. After the core, usually in their junior year, students can choose a major or majors from the following areas: accounting, finance (corporate, investments, or financial services track), insurance and risk management, international business, management (entrepreneurship or human resources track), economics, marketing, management science (business information systems or global supply chain and operations management track), and real estate. The Undergraduate International Business major at the Moore School solidifies its international business rankings. Graduate =MBA Programs= International MBA The International Masters of Business Administration at the Darla Moore School of Business combines traditional business education with intensive language training in one of eight languages ‚Äì Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, or Spanish. In addition to the language tracks, the global track allows students to study the business and cultural issues of regions around the world without learning a language other than English. All tracks are 20‚Äì22 months, with the exception of Arabic, Chinese, and Japanese, which require 29‚Äì34 months of study to give students added exposure to the more complex languages and cultures of these countries. Students may also volunteer with the Peace Corps during the IMBA program, extending the program length to approximately 48 months. Students must be accepted separately to the Peace Corps' Masters' International Program. Students begin the program with an intensive core of business courses. The core lasts from July to December. In January, students begin language training in the country that natively speaks the language they are learning. Then around April 1, students begin a mandatory internship, ideally in the language they studied. After their internships are completed, students in both the language and global tracks return to the Moore School to continue their business education. Students take elective classes during their final two semesters either at USC or they may choose to complete a one-semester exchange. Professional MBA The Moore School designed the Professional MBA program as a part-time, 28-month MBA program for working professionals. Students have the options of taking classes in 20 locations throughout SC and one location in Charlotte, NC. Some classes are also broadcast over South Carolina's public television system, ETV. Although the program is over 36 years old, email and the internet are critical tools for students. The professors that teach in the program are the same professors who teach full- time students. =Other programs= Master of Accountancy The Master of Accountancy program is designed for students who have an undergraduate degree in accounting from an accredited university. The additional education provides the opportunity to specialize in a particular field of accounting, complete the professional examinations while in school, and meet the specific educational requirements to qualify for the CPA designation in some states. Although this program is a natural extension of study for students who have completed an undergraduate degree in accounting, it is open to anyone who satisfies the school's admission standards regardless of their undergraduate major. Master of Arts in Economics The Master of Arts in Economics program is designed to prepare a student for a career as a professional economist in government or business. The program also serves as an avenue toward further graduate work in the field of economics. Graduate course offerings in economics include business economics, human capital and manpower economics, quantitative economics, public finance, money and banking, economic history, economic theory, developmental economics, international economics, and industrial organization and public policy. Masters of Human Resources The MHR Program consists of 36 hours of course work plus a required six-hour internship. All internships are professional level, last at least eight weeks (most last 12 or more) and provide on-the-job experience in an actual human resources environment. Limited enrollment (approximately 30-35 new students per year) and small class size provide students with individualized attention. Master of International Business The Master of International Business Program is an interdisciplinary program that combines the development of international business expertise with an advanced understanding of international studies. The program is unique in its focus on political, economic, and socio-cultural dimensions of global business. The curriculum is designed to provide a broadened and integrative understanding of business and government interactions globally. Doctoral For those students who wish to enter academia, the Moore School offers two basic doctoral programs: Ph.D. in Business Administration and Ph.D. in Economics. These programs have a large amount of flexibility to suit the needs of each students. Graduates currently hold positions at University of Memphis, Cambridge University, Indiana University, University of Houston‚ÄìClear Lake, College of Charleston, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Furman University, East Carolina University, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency, the International Monetary Fund, BellSouth, and Bank of America.

The small removable disks store 35, 70, or 120 gigabytes and are hard-drive technology. Like a standard hard drive, the REV system uses a flying head to read and write data to a spinning platter. The removable disks contained the platter, spindle, and motor, while the drive heads and drive controller are contained within the REV drive. The drives allow for data transfer rates of about 25 megabytes per second. The REV was available as an external desktop model with FireWire, SCSI or USB 2.0 interfaces, an internal model with SCSI, ATAPI, or SATA interfaces, or an external server model which features a cartridge autoloader and SCSI interface. Iomega also offered a 320 GB network-attached storage appliance which features a built-in REV. The drives are compatible with Macintosh, Windows, and Linux operating systems, although some only with particular models or interfaces. This product, especially the server model, was marketed as a replacement of tape drive technology for enterprise data backup, with claims of higher reliability, greater speed, and random access capability. The REV was in many ways a successor to Iomega's Jaz drive, which uses a similar removable hard-disk-platter concept. However the Jaz design does not put the drive motor in the disk case. In some circles, REV drives are referred to as \\"RRD,\\" for \\"Removable Rigid Disk,\\" because SCSI REV drives identify themselves as \\"RRD\\" drives to the host OS. The disks are formatted with the UDF file system on Windows and Unix/Linux. On Apple systems, they may be formatted as HFS+ or UDF in Mac OS X. A seemingly-similar competing technology is RDX Technology. A key distinction, however, is that the REV drive heads and drive controller remain inside the drive when the hard-disk platter is removed from it. In RDX Technology, the drive heads are contained within the cartridge along with the platter and are removed along with it.

On February 22, 1974, he attempted to hijack a plane flying out of Baltimore/Washington International Airport, intending to crash into the White House in the hopes of killing President Richard Nixon. During the incident, Byck killed a policeman and a pilot but was shot by another policeman. Byck died by suicide. Early life Born to poor Jewish parents in South Philadelphia, Byck dropped out of high school in the ninth grade in order to support his impoverished family. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1954 and was honorably discharged in 1956. He married shortly thereafter, and fathered four children. Background In 1972, Byck began to suffer from severe bouts of depression after his wife divorced him and several job-related financial failures. He admitted himself to a psychiatric ward, for a two-month stay. Byck began to harbor the belief that the Nixon administration was conspiring to oppress the poor. Byck came to the notice of the Secret Service in 1972, when he threatened Nixon, whom he had resented since the Small Business Administration had turned down his loan application. Byck had also sent tape recordings to various other public figures including scientist Jonas Salk, Senator Abraham Ribicoff of Connecticut, and composer Leonard Bernstein; and had tried to join the Black Panthers. The Secret Service considered Byck to be harmless, and no action was taken at that time. Assassination attempt In early 1974, Byck made his decision to assassinate Nixon. He planned to do so by hijacking an airliner and crashing it into the White House on a day when Nixon would be there. It has been suggested (for instance, by the 2004 film dramatization of his life) that Byck was inspired by news reports of the buzzing of the White House by U.S. Army soldier Robert K. Preston in a stolen UH-1B Huey helicopter on February 17. Since Byck was already known to the Secret Service and because legal attempts to purchase a firearm might have resulted in increased scrutiny, Byck stole a .22 caliber revolver from his friend to use in the hijacking. Byck also made a bomb out of two gallon jugs of gasoline and an igniter. All through this process, Byck made audio recordings explaining his motives and his plans; he expected to be considered a hero for his actions and wanted to fully document his reasons for the assassination.Sam Byck Audio Tapes at YouTube On Friday morning, February 22, 1974, Byck drove to the Baltimore/Washington International Airport. Shortly after 7:00 a.m. EST, he shot and killed Maryland Aviation Administration policeman George Neal Ramsburghttps://www.odmp.org/officer/10989-officer-george-neal-ramsburg before storming a DC-9, Delta Air Lines Flight 523 to Atlanta, which he chose because it was the closest flight that was ready to take off. After pilots Reese (Doug) Loftin and Fred Jones told him they could not take off until wheel blocks were removed, he shot them both and grabbed a nearby passenger, ordering her to \\"fly the plane\\". Jones died as he was being removed from the aircraft after the event was concluded; Loftin survived the attack. Byck told a flight attendant to close the door, or he would blow up the plane. Anne Arundel County policemen attempted to shoot out the tires of the aircraft to prevent its take-off, but the .38 caliber bullets fired from their police- issued Smith & Wesson revolvers failed to penetrate the aircraft's tires and ricocheted off, some hitting the wing of the plane. After a standoff between Byck and police on the jetway, AAC police-officer Charles Troyer fired four shots through the aircraft door at Byck with a .357 Magnum revolver taken from the deceased Ramsburg. Two of the shots penetrated the thick window of the aircraft door and wounded Byck; before the police could gain entry to the plane, Byck committed suicide by shooting himself in the head. According to a special on the History Channel, he lived for a few minutes, dying after saying \\"help me\\" to one of the policemen who entered the plane after he had been shot. A briefcase containing the gasoline bomb was found under his body. The plane never left the gate, and Nixon's schedule was not affected by the assassination attempt, although he was in the White House at the time. It was subsequently discovered that Byck had sent a tape recording detailing his plan, which he called \\"Operation Pandora's Box\\", to news columnist Jack Anderson. A review of records disclosed that Byck had been arrested twice for protesting in front of the White House without a permit, and that he later dressed in a Santa Claus suit for another protest. Loftin, the flight's captain, recovered and resumed flying airliners several years later. In 1987, an FAA document entitled \\"Troubled Passage: The Federal Aviation Administration During the Nixon‚ÄìFord Term 1973‚Äì1977\\" was produced, which mentioned Byck's failed hijacking: \\"...though Byck lacked the skill and self- control to reach his target, he had provided a chilling reminder of the potential of violence against civil aviation. Under a more relaxed security system, his suicidal rampage might have begun when the airliner was aloft.\\" Legacy After Byck's failed assassination attempt and subsequent death, he faded into relative obscurity except among members of security organizations. The 9/11 Commission Report mentioned Byck's attempted assassination of Nixon on page 561 in note 21: In popular culture Byck is one of the (failed) assassins portrayed in Stephen Sondheim's and John Weidman's 1991 musical Assassins. His role in the musical is built largely around his tapes sent to Leonard Bernstein and other famous public figures, which he is depicted recording during two scene-length monologues, the first addressed to Bernstein and the second to Nixon himself. Byck also wears a Santa suit throughout the play in reference to a photograph of him protesting Nixon. A film based on his story, The Assassination of Richard Nixon, was released in 2004.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364961/ The Assassination of Richard Nixon. Internet Movie Database (2004).

It forms the basis for much of modern chocolate, and is used in ice cream, hot chocolate, and baking.  History  The Dutch process was developed in the early 19th century by Dutch chocolate maker Coenraad Johannes van Houten, whose father Casparus was responsible for the development of the method of removing fat from cocoa beans by hydraulic press around 1828, forming the basis for cocoa powder. These developments greatly expanded the use of cocoa, which had been mostly used as a beverage in Europe until that time.  Taste and cooking properties  Dutch processed cocoa has a neutral pH, and is not acidic like natural cocoa, so in recipes that use sodium bicarbonate (often known as bicarbonate of soda, baking soda, or bicarb) as the leavening agent‚Äîwhich relies on the acidity of the cocoa to activate it‚Äîbuttermilk, yoghurt or sour milk should be substituted for the milk in the recipe, or a dash of cream of tartar can be used to provide some acidity in the batter. There is no need to add acidity when Dutch process cocoa is used in recipes that use baking powder instead of soda for leavening. The Dutch process: * Lowers acidity * Increases solubility * Changes color * Smoothes flavor Reduction of antioxidants and flavonols Compared to other processes, Dutch process cocoa contains lower amounts of flavonols (antioxidants). The effect this has on nutritional value is disputed. Professor Irmgard Bitsch of the Institut f√ºr Ern√§hrungswissenschaft, Justus-Liebig-University Giessen claims that the reduction of antioxidants due to the process is not significant and enough polyphenols and procyanidins remain in the cocoa. One study determined that 60% of natural cocoa's original antioxidants were destroyed by light dutching and 90% were destroyed by heavy dutching. However, natural cocoa has such high levels of antioxidants that even a 60% reduction leaves it high on the list of antioxidant-rich foods.

Born in Christiania (now Oslo), Norway, he lived most his life in Copenhagen, Denmark. Svendsen's output includes two symphonies, a violin concerto, a cello concerto, and the Romance for violin, as well as a number of Norwegian Rhapsodies for orchestra. At one time Svendsen was an intimate friend of the German composer Richard Wagner. Life His father was a music teacher and Svendsen learned both the violin and clarinet from him. By the time he finished school, he was working as an orchestral musician, and occasionally made short concert tours as a violinist. In L√ºbeck, on one of his tours, he came to the attention of a wealthy merchant who made it possible for him to study from 1863-67 at the Leipzig Conservatory. He began his studies with Ferdinand David, but problems with his hand forced him to switch to composition, which he studied with Carl Reinecke. He completed his studies in Leipzig in 1867, receiving first prize in composition. During this period, Svendsen had a son out of wedlock, Johann Richard Rudolph (1867‚Äì1933). Gradually his attention turned to conducting. After spending time in Paris (1868‚Äì70) and Leipzig (1870‚Äì72), he returned to Christiania. In the summer of 1871, he went to New York City to marry Sarah (Sally, later changed to Bergljot) Levett Schmidt, whom he had met in Paris. He was conductor of the Musical Society Concerts in Christiania (1872‚Äì77), then spent three years in Germany, Italy, England and France. He returned to teach and conduct in Kristiania (1880‚Äì1883). In 1883, he was appointed principal conductor of the Royal Theater Orchestra in Copenhagen, where he lived until his death. Johan Svendsen, c.1890; portrait by Hans Heyerdahl. In 1884, he and his wife separated, and she moved to Paris. Their relationship had been chaotic for several years. A famous anecdote would have it that in 1883, in a fit of anger, she had thrown the only copy of his Symphony No. 3 in the fire. This incident was used by Henrik Ibsen in Hedda Gabler. If anything was caught up in the fire at all, it is rather unlikely it was anything near a complete symphony. However, some sketches, most likely for a symphony, were found by conductor Bjarte Engeset in 2007. They were elaborated and orchestrated by Bj√∏rn Morten Christophersen and premiered by the Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra and Engeset in 2011. Following a divorce from Sarah (10 December 1901), he married (23 December 1901) Juliette Haase, with whom he had been living and had three children. His younger son from this marriage was the famous Danish actor Eyvind Johan-Svendsen (1896‚Äì1946). 1898 Music festival in Bergen by Agnes Nyblin.

While Grieg composed mostly for small instrumentation, Svendsen composed primarily for orchestras and large ensembles. His most famous work is his Romance for violin and orchestra, Op. 26. He was very popular in Denmark and Norway during his lifetime, both as a composer and a conductor, winning many national awards and honors. However this popularity did not translate into acceptance into the international repertory of classical music. He died in Copenhagen, aged 70. Svendsen's first published work, the String Quartet in A minor, Op. 1, achieved great popular success. He quickly followed with the String Octet, Op. 3 and String Quintet, Op. 5, both of which added to his early fame. All of Svendsen's chamber music was written while he was at the Leipzig Conservatory, yet these works are not considered student works. By general consensus, Svendsen was regarded as one of the most talented students then at the Conservatory. His works won prizes and received public performances to much acclaim.

It is located in the historic region of Slavonia, near the border to Bosnia and Herzegovina. The first word in the name means New, and there's also an Old Gradi≈°ka nearby, the village of Stara Gradi≈°ka and the Bosnian town of Gradi≈°ka, previously known as Bosanska Gradi≈°ka. History Nova Gradi≈°ka in 1906 Nova Gradi≈°ka is often referred to as The Youngest Town. The town of Nova Gradi≈°ka was founded in 1748 as an outpost in the Military Frontier and was first named Friedrichsdorf in German. Already in 1750 it was renamed Neu-Gradischka which later became Nova Gradi≈°ka in the Croatian language. The Hungarian name is √öjgradiska. Before 1881, Nova Gradi≈°ka (named NEU-GRADISKA before 1850) was part of the Austrian monarchy (Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia after the compromise of 1867), in the Slavonian Military Frontier, Gradiskaner Regiment N¬∞VIII.Map of the Corinphila-Auktionen 2003. The first building constructed was the church of Saint Tereza, which is an important monument of baroque architecture in Slavonia. The old core of the town comprises the church of Saint Terezija and the old court house and prison from the 18th century. Between 1881 and 1918, Nova Gradi≈°ka was a district capital in the Po≈æega County of the Kingdom.

The church was damaged by the forces of the Republic of Serbian Krajina during the Croatian War of Independence. In XIX century the new Church of Virgin Mary on the town square was initiated. Aulic Council prevented the authorities of the Slavonian Military Frontier from destroying the church with intention to build a school at its place. Historically, there were also two Serbian Orthodox Churches in Nova Gradi≈°ka, one of them destroyed during the World War II and one during the Croatian War of Independence. Those were the Church of Saint Nicolas and the Church of the Holy Trinity. The Church of the Holy Trinity was the central orthodox church located at the town square. It was erected in 1824 at the spot of an earlier wooden church from 1955. The church was destructed by quisling Ustasha regime in 1941. The new neo-Byzantine Church of the Holy Trinity was complete in 1982 but it was detonated 9 times and destroyed during the Croatian War of Independence.

It is currently (as of 2012) published by Flying Buffalo, and has inspired several expansions. It is a satirical simulation of an end-of-the-world scenario fought mostly with nuclear weapons.  Gameplay  The game is a multiplayer game, with each player having a small cardboard playmat upon which cards are placed and revealed. It is intended to be played by 3 or more players, but can also be played with only 2. At the start of a game, each player is dealt a number of \\"population cards,\\" ranging in denomination from 1 million to 25 million people. Players must protect their population, as the total loss of population leads to player elimination. They are then dealt a number of cards, which may be of the following types: *Secrets which usually steal or reduce another player's population. *Propaganda which steal another player's population, but have no effect once war has started. *Delivery Systems usually missiles and bombers, which stay in play ready to hold a warhead. Later expansion sets add submarines and other options. *Warheads which are fitted to a Delivery System, or discarded if there is not one available for them. *Specials which are usually defensive cards to shoot down incoming missiles, or cards to increase the devastation caused by attacks. Initially, players take turns playing secrets. Once all players have played all secrets and replaced cards from the deck they can announce 'no secrets' and place two cards face down. Players then take turns during which they will play a third face-down card, and then reveal the oldest face-down card (first in, first out) and resolve it. Secrets and propaganda cards are resolved immediately upon being exposed, while missile launches take more than one turn to properly set up. The game begins in a Cold War, in which no one is yet at war and propaganda cards have full effect. Once players have a warhead fitted to a delivery system (for example by revealing a missile on one turn, then revealing a warhead on their next turn), they must launch an attack. When someone launches an attack, the threat of war is imminent. If the attack is successful, resulting in a nuclear detonation, (regardless if actual appreciable loss of life takes place) \\"war is declared,\\" the Cold War is over, and propaganda cards are now worthless until a player is eliminated, at which time the Cold War resumes. A truly successful attack reduces the target player's population; (bomb shelters and other civil defenses may mitigate against this); when a player's population reaches zero due to nuclear war, they may launch an immediate retaliatory attack (called \\"final retaliation\\") but they are noted as defeated. Often, a final retaliation will end another player's game, leading to a final retaliation by that player, and so on. Hence, in some cases, many players can be defeated in a series of tragedy in a single turn (via this mutual assured destruction method). If a player is knocked out with a propaganda card, no retaliation is allowed. If a player is eliminated by a secret while war is not declared, no final retaliation is allowed. The object of the game is to be the sole player remaining after all attacks are resolved. More often, final retaliation strikes remove all players in a chain reaction. Also, if the one and only 100-megaton bomb is exploded full force (not a \\"MIRV\\" device) and strikes a nuclear stockpile (very unlikely), a chain reaction ensues that destroys all life on the planet: everybody loses. If all players are eliminated from play, then there is no winner. Alternatively, a variant scoring system has been developed that determines a winner via a point system ‚Äî 1 point for a knock out, 2 points for a propaganda knock out, 3 points for a retaliation knock out, a variable number of points for position depending on number of players, and finally 2 points for surviving (with the survivor not necessarily being the points winner). This point system is seen by some game enthusiasts as a betrayal of the original sense of purpose for this game: to illustrate that nuclear war is a winless proposition no matter what. The delivery systems in the game reflect some of those in the American arsenal at the time each set was released, including the Polaris, Atlas and Saturn rockets. Other available delivery systems include the XB-70 Valkyrie deep penetration bomber, which had been cancelled several years prior to the base game's release, but which had two operational prototypes at the time; and the Convair B-58 Hustler, out of service for 35 years by the time it was introduced in 2004's Weapons of Mass Destruction.  Expansions  Flying Buffalo has released a number of expansions, many of which can be played separately or with the original game. Each expansion highlights the worries of the end-of-the-world scenarios‚Äîincluding actual, theoretical, and feared weapons‚Äîat the time of their releases. ;Nuclear Escalation (1983): Adds deterrents and defensive capabilities, space platforms, the \\"glow-in-the-dark nuclear death die\\", and more. ;Nuclear Proliferation (1992): Each player now represents a different country with unique special powers. Adds submarines, atomic cannons, and more. ;Nuclear War Booster Packs (1995): Packs of 8 random cards from a set of 47 new cards. ;Nuclear War Bonus Pack #1: 9 new countries, warhead cards, a set of population cards, a bumper sticker, and a player assistance chart. ;Nuclear War Bonus Pack #2 ‚Äî India/Pakistan War Variant (1999): Combines the Nuclear War game with the India Rails game. ;Weapons of Mass Destruction (2004): More cards for the game including new cards usable as either a missile or a warhead and a Deluxe Population deck featuring characters from Nodwick, Kenzer & Company and Dork Tower. ;Nuclear War Bonus Pack #3: Same as Bonus Pack #1 but with new style of deluxe population cards from Weapons of Mass Destruction. Reception In the December 1980 edition of The Space Gamer (Issue No. 34), Steve Jackson commented, \\"This is NOT an 'introductory' wargame ‚Äì it's not a wargame at all. It's a card game. Recommended for a quick social game or for when everyone is too sleepy to play anything complex.\\" In the December 1993 edition of Dragon (Issue 200), Allen Varney considered Nuclear War a classic. \\"It‚Äôs a sin for a multi-player design to throw out a player before the game is over, but in this venerable game, that‚Äôs the whole point.\\"  Awards  *Nuclear Escalation - Charles Roberts Award for Best Science Fiction Boardgame of 1983 *Nuclear Proliferation - Origins Award for Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Boardgame of 1992 *Nuclear War - inducted into the Origins Adventure Gaming Hall of Fame In 1999 Pyramid magazine named Nuclear War as one of The Millennium's Best Card Games.

The method may involve pyrolysis or thermolysis, or it may not (for instance, a simple mixture of ice and glass could be separated without breaking any chemical bonds, but organic matter contains a greater diversity of molecules, some of which are likely to break). If there are no chemical changes, just phase changes, it resembles classical distillation, although it will generally need higher temperatures. Dry distillation in which chemical changes occur is a type of destructive distillation or cracking. Uses The method has been used to obtain liquid fuels from coal and wood. It can also be used to break down mineral salts such as sulfates () through thermolysis, in this case producing sulfur dioxide (SO2) or sulfur trioxide (SO3) gas which can be dissolved in water to obtain sulfuric acid. By this method sulfuric acid was first identified and artificially produced. When substances of vegetable origin, e.g. coal, oil shale, peat or wood, are heated in the absence of air (dry distillation), they decompose into gas, liquid products and coke/charcoal. The yield and chemical nature of the decomposition products depend on the nature of the raw material and the conditions under which the dry distillation is done. Decomposition within a temperature range of 450 to about 600¬∞C is called carbonization or low-temperature degassing. At temperatures above 900¬∞C, the process is called coking or high-temperature degassing. If coal is gasified to make coal gas or carbonized to make coke then Coal tar is among the by-products. =Wood= When wood is heated above 270¬∞C it begins to carbonize. If air is absent, the final product (since there is no oxygen present to react with the wood) is charcoal. If air (which contains oxygen) is present, the wood will catch fire and burn when it reaches a temperature of about 400‚Äì500¬∞C and the fuel product is wood ash. If wood is heated away from air, first the moisture is driven off. Until this is complete, the wood temperature remains at about 100‚Äì110¬∞C. When the wood is dry its temperature rises, and at about 270¬∞C, it begins to spontaneously decompose. This is the well known exothermic reaction which takes place in charcoal burning. At this stage evolution of the by-products of wood carbonization starts. These substances are given off gradually as the temperature rises and at about 450¬∞C the evolution is complete. The solid residue, charcoal, is mainly carbon (about 70%) and small amounts of tarry substances which can be driven off or decomposed completely only by raising the temperature to above about 600¬∞C. In the common practice of charcoal burning using internal heating of the charged wood by burning a part of it, all the by-product vapors and gas escapes into the atmosphere as smoke. The by-products can be recovered by passing the off-gases through a series of water to yield so-called wood vinegar (pyroligneous acid) and the non- condensible wood gas passes on through the condenser and may be burned to provide heat. The wood gas is only usable as fuel and consists typically of 17% methane; 2% hydrogen; 23% carbon monoxide; 38% carbon dioxide; 2% oxygen and 18% nitrogen. It has a gas calorific value of about 10.8 MJoules per m3 (290 BTU/cu.ft.) i.e. about one third the value of natural gas. When deciduous tree woods are subjected to distillation, the products are methanol (wood alcohol) and charcoal. The distillation of pine wood causes Pine tar and pitch to drip away from the wood and leave behind charcoal. Birch tar from birch bark is a particularly fine tar, known as \\"Russian oil\\", suitable for leather protection. The by-products of wood tar are turpentine and charcoal. Tar kilns are dry distillation ovens, historically used in Scandinavia for producing tar from wood. They were built close to the forest, from limestone or from more primitive holes in the ground. The bottom is sloped into an outlet hole to allow the tar to pour out. The wood is split into dimensions of a finger, stacked densely, and finally covered tight with dirt and moss. If oxygen can enter, the wood might catch fire, and the production would be ruined. On top of this, a fire is stacked and lit. After a few hours, the tar starts to pour out and continues to do so for a few days.

Background According to the history compilation Samguk Sagi, he was the son of the previous king Gaeru. He became king upon Gaeru's death in 166 which was the 39th year of his reign.Samguk Sagi, Scroll 23 Relations between Baekje and the rival kingdom Silla became hostile after Gaeru had given refuge to a Sillan traitor Gilseon in 165, shortly before Chogo inherited the throne.Samguk Sagi, Scroll 23 Reign Chogo began attacking Silla in 167, and captured two castles, but the Sillans drove him and his army off. Chogo ran another campaign (188-190) against Silla, and captured several castles (Castles Mosan, Guyang, Wonsanhyang, and Yogeo). In 204, he destroyed Yocha. He also built new castles, including Castle Jeokhyeon and Sado, in captured territory, and settled people there in 210. The battles occurred around the Sobaek Mountains. In 214, he waged war against the Mohe. He led 1.000 soldiers to capture Castle Seokmun of Mohe, but the Mohe counter-attacked in the Sulcheon region of Baekje. In July 214 Silla also invaded Baekje, and captured Castle Sahyeon. Samguk Sagi: * 167 AD, autumn, seventh month. Troops secretly attacked two castles in Silla's western district. He captured 1,000 men and women and then returned. Eighth month. The King of Silla dispatched Ilgilcan Heungseon at the head of 20,000 troops to come and invaded several castles in the east of the country. The Sillan King also personally led 8,000 spirited cavalrymen and accompanied Heungseon. They went as far as the Han river when the King of Baekje determined the Sillan host was impossible to repel and returned that which had been plundered earlier. * 170 AD, spring, third month. On the last day of the month, there was a solar eclipse. Winter, tenth month. Troops were dispatched to invade the border with Silla. * 186 AD, winter, tenth month. There were no clouds but there was lightning. A comet was seen in the northwest. It disappeared after 20 days. * 187 AD, spring, fifth month. The wells of the capital and the Han River were all dry. * 188 AD, spring, second month. Extensive repairs were made to the palace. Troops were dispatched to attack the Mosan Fortress (Î™®ÏÇ∞ÏÑ±/ÊØçÂ±±Âüé) in Silla. * 189 AD, spring, fourth month. On the first day of the month, there was a solar eclipse. Autumn, seventh month. Baekje troops fought with Silla Guyang. They were defeated and more than 500 died. * 190 AD, spring, eighth month. Soldiers were dispatched to attack the district of Wonsan in the west of Silla. They advanced and surrounded Bugok Fortress. General Gudo of Silla then led 500 mounted troops to repel them, so Baekje forces feigned a retreat. Gudo pursued them to Wasan Fortress (ÏôÄÏÇ∞ÏÑ±/ËõôÂ±±Âüé) where the troops turned and gave battle and had a great victory. * 191 AD, autumn, ninth month. Chiugi (a type of comet) was seen in the horn and gullet constellations. * 199 AD, autumn, seventh month. There was an earthquake. Troops were dispatched to attack the Sillan border. * 204 AD, autumn, seventh month. Troops were dispatched to attack Yocha Fortress in Silla and sacked it. They killed the lord of the fortress, Seolbu. The King of Silla, Naehae of Silla, was furious and ordered Ibeolcan Rieum to become general and lead six squadrons of spirited troops to come and attack Baekje's Saheyon Fortress. Winter, tenth month. A comet was seen in the Eastern well. * 205 AD, autumn, seventh month. Venus intersected with the moon. * 208 AD, autumn. Because of locusts and drought the crops did not mature. There were many incidents of thievery but the king consoled them. * 209 AD, winter, tenth month. There was a typhoon that uprooted trees. * 210 AD, spring, second month. The two fortresses of Jeokhyeon and Sado were built, and residents from the east were moved there. Winter, tenth month. The Malgal came and attacked Sado Fortress but were unable to take it. They burned down the fortress gate and then escaped. * 211 AD, autumn, eighth month. In the south of the country locusts damaged the crops and the people starved. Winter, 11th month. There was no ice. * 212 AD, summer, sixth month. On the last day of the month, there was a solar eclipse. * 213 AD, autumn, seventh month. In the western district a man named Hoehoe caught a white deer and presented it to the King. The King deemed it a felicitous omen and gave him 100 stones of grain. * 214 AD, autumn, ninth month. The King ordered Jin Gwa of the northern district to lead 1,000 soldiers to attack and take the Mohe castle of Seokmun. In the winter a powerful cavalry of Malgal came and attacked, coming as far as the Sul River. The King died. Legacy The 8th king Goi is said to be Chogo's younger brother.

Its mission is to collect samples from the atmosphere for the purpose of detecting and identifying nuclear explosions. It is also informally referred to as the \\"weather bird\\" or \\"the sniffer\\" by workers on the program and international media respectively. Operational history A WC-135B at Fairford in 1988. This aircraft remains in service as a WC-135W. The same aircraft seen at RAF Alconbury in 1992 The WC-135 was introduced in December 1965, replacing Boeing WB-50 aircraft in the weather-reconnaissance and air-sampling mission. Ten aircraft were initially converted from C-135B transport aircraft and were placed in service with the 55th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron at McClellan Air Force Base, California, with the Military Airlift Command (MAC). Detachments were located at various bases throughout the United States and worldwide. The aircraft occasionally took on other roles throughout their careers; several aircraft were temporarily assigned to the 10th Airborne Command and Control Squadron at RAF Mildenhall in the late 1980s and early 1990s as training aircraft so that the unit could slow the accumulation of flight hours on its EC-135Hs, while others served as staff transports on an as-needed basis. Upon retirement from frontline weather reconnaissance service in the early 1990s, five were retained for further use. Serial no. 61-2666 was converted to an NC-135 and remains in service as a testbed for RC-135 equipment upgrades. Serial no. 61-2667 was upgraded to a WC-135W, given the project name Constant Phoenix, and remains in service with the 45th Reconnaissance Squadron at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska. Serial no. 61-2674 was converted to the first OC-135B Open Skies observation aircraft, reentering service in 1993. It was later stored in 1997 and replaced with two additional aircraft also converted from WC-135s. In 1998, a former EC-135C, serial no. 62-3582, was converted into a WC-135C, also designated Constant Phoenix. In April 2018 it was announced that three KC-135R tanker aircraft would be converted as WC-135R Constant Phoenix aircraft to replace the two aircraft operated by the 45th Reconnaissance Squadron. The first aircraft is scheduled to be converted by L3 Technologies at Greenville, Texas starting in September 2019.Air Force Times \\"Air Force to start transforming tankers into WC-135 \\"nuke sniffers\\" in FY19\\" dated April 26, 2018 Mission The WC-135B and WC-135W Constant Phoenix atmospheric-collection aircraft support national- level intelligence consumers by collecting particulate debris and gaseous effluents from accessible regions of the atmosphere in support of the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963. Features The Constant Phoenix's modifications are primarily related to the aircraft's on-board atmospheric collection suite, which allows the mission crew to detect radioactive debris \\"clouds\\" in real time. The aircraft is equipped with external flow-through devices to collect particulates on filter paper and a compressor system for whole air samples collected in high-pressure holding spheres. Despite the different designations, both the C and W carry the same mission equipment (similar to the RC-135V and W aircraft). The interior seats 33 people, including the cockpit crew, maintenance personnel, and special equipment operators from the Air Force Technical Applications Center. On operational sorties, the crew is minimized to just pilots, navigator, and special- equipment operators, to reduce radiation exposure to mission-essential personnel only. =Vela Incident= WC-135B aircraft flew 25 sorties in 1979 to try to ascertain whether a double flash in the South Atlantic that was detected by a Vela satellite was a nuclear weapons test, however, the result was inconclusive. =Pakistan & India= The Constant Phoenix aircraft was used to gather information on the nuclear tests conducted by Pakistan and India in 1998. =North Korea= On October 6, 2006, Japan's Kyodo News agency reported that a US military aircraft, equipped to detect radiation from a nuclear test, took off from southern Japan. This was believed to be part of US efforts to prepare to monitor a North Korean nuclear test. On October 9, 2006, North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported that the country had performed a successful underground nuclear test. On October 13, 2006, CNN reported: \\"The U.S. Air Force flew a WC-135 Constant Phoenix atmospheric collection aircraft on Tuesday to collect air samples from the region. A preliminary analysis of air samples from North Korea shows 'radioactive debris consistent with a North Korea nuclear test', according to a statement from the office of the top U.S. intelligence official. The statement, from the office of Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte, was sent to Capitol Hill but not released publicly. CNN obtained it from a congressional source. The national intelligence office statement said the air samples were collected Wednesday, and analysis found debris that would be consistent with a nuclear test 'in the vicinity of Punggye' on Monday. The South Korean Defense Ministry told CNN that the United States has informed it that radioactivity has been detected.\\" The aircraft was based at Offutt AFB and was sent to Kadena Air Base on Okinawa to operate during the sampling missions.Timesonline.co.uk, Cold War aircraft searches the sky for proof of test. On June 17, 2009, JoongAng Daily reported, in reference to a purported May 25 nuclear test by North Korea: \\"The U.S. Air Force twice dispatched a special reconnaissance jet, the WC-135 Constant Phoenix from Kadena Air Base in Okinawa, Japan, to collect air samples.\\"joongangdaily.joins.com, U.S. finds that North test in May was nuclear. On November 23, 2010, Sankei Shimbun reported that a WC-135 had been moved to Kadena Air Base in September 2010, in anticipation of a North Korean nuclear test. On January 31, 2013, the WC-135W was reported to be conducting surveillance flights out of Kadena Air Base in anticipation of another North Korean nuclear test. On January 6, 2016, the United States Air Force confirmed plans to soon deploy the WC-135 to test for radiation near North Korea to examine North Korea's claim that they had successfully conducted a hydrogen- bomb test on January 5 (EST). On September 8, 2016, it was reported that the WC-135 would soon begin surveillance flights near the Korean Peninsula after South Korean officials confirmed that North Korea conducted its fifth nuclear test at approximately 0:30 UTC. On April 12, 2017, it was deployed to Okinawa amid rising tensions with North Korea. North Korea conducted a missile test on April 3, 2017. On May 19, 2017, two Chinese Su-30 fighter jets intercepted a WC-135 over the East China Sea, prompting a formal complaint from the Pentagon. =Japan= On March 17, 2011, CNN reported that the WC-135W had been deployed from Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska to Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska. From there it assisted in detecting radioactive materials in the atmosphere around Japan, monitoring radioactivity released from the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant caused by the magnitude 9.0 earthquake and subsequent tsunami of March 11, 2011. =Europe= In 1986, the WC-135C was deployed to Europe to help monitor the air after the Chernobyl disaster. On February 17, 2017, it was reported that the WC-135C had been deployed to RAF Mildenhall. It was conjectured that this came in response to several reports of anomalous levels of iodine-131 coming from the Norwegian-Russian Border. As of April 10, 2017, there was no official cause of the iodine-131 release.

In the form of Œ≥-anhydrite (the anhydrous form), it is used as a desiccant. One particular hydrate is better known as plaster of Paris, and another occurs naturally as the mineral gypsum. It has many uses in industry. All forms are white solids that are poorly soluble in water.Franz Wirsching \\"Calcium Sulfate\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2012 Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. Calcium sulfate causes permanent hardness in water. Hydration states and crystallographic structures The compound exists in three levels of hydration corresponding to different crystallographic structures and to different minerals in nature: * CaSO4 (anhydrite): anhydrous state. * CaSO4 ¬∑ 2 H2O (gypsum and selenite (mineral)): dihydrate. * CaSO4 ¬∑ H2O (bassanite): hemihydrate, also known as plaster of Paris. Specific hemihydrates are sometimes distinguished: Œ±-hemihydrate and Œ≤-hemihydrate.Taylor H.F.W. (1990) Cement Chemistry. Academic Press, , pp. 186-187. Uses The main use of calcium sulfate is to produce plaster of Paris and stucco. These applications exploit the fact that calcium sulfate which has been powdered and calcined forms a moldable paste upon hydration and hardens as crystalline calcium sulfate dihydrate. It is also convenient that calcium sulfate is poorly soluble in water and does not readily dissolve in contact with water after its solidification. =Hydration and dehydration reactions= With judicious heating, gypsum converts to the partially dehydrated mineral called bassanite or plaster of Paris. This material has the formula CaSO4¬∑(nH2O), where 0.5 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 0.8. Temperatures between are required to drive off the water within its structure. The details of the temperature and time depend on ambient humidity. Temperatures as high as are used in industrial calcination, but at these temperatures Œ≥-anhydrite begins to form. The heat energy delivered to the gypsum at this time (the heat of hydration) tends to go into driving off water (as water vapor) rather than increasing the temperature of the mineral, which rises slowly until the water is gone, then increases more rapidly. The equation for the partial dehydration is: : CaSO4 ¬∑ 2 H2O -> CaSO4 ¬∑ H2O + H2O‚Üë The endothermic property of this reaction is relevant to the performance of drywall, conferring fire resistance to residential and other structures. In a fire, the structure behind a sheet of drywall will remain relatively cool as water is lost from the gypsum, thus preventing (or substantially retarding) damage to the framing (through combustion of wood members or loss of strength of steel at high temperatures) and consequent structural collapse. But at higher temperatures, calcium sulfate will release oxygen and act as an oxidizing agent. This property is used in aluminothermy. In contrast to most minerals, which when rehydrated simply form liquid or semi-liquid pastes, or remain powdery, calcined gypsum has an unusual property: when mixed with water at normal (ambient) temperatures, it quickly reverts chemically to the preferred dihydrate form, while physically \\"setting\\" to form a rigid and relatively strong gypsum crystal lattice: :CaSO4 ¬∑ H2O + H2O -> CaSO4 ¬∑ 2 H2O This reaction is exothermic and is responsible for the ease with which gypsum can be cast into various shapes including sheets (for drywall), sticks (for blackboard chalk), and molds (to immobilize broken bones, or for metal casting). Mixed with polymers, it has been used as a bone repair cement. Small amounts of calcined gypsum are added to earth to create strong structures directly from cast earth, an alternative to adobe (which loses its strength when wet). The conditions of dehydration can be changed to adjust the porosity of the hemihydrate, resulting in the so-called Œ±- and Œ≤-hemihydrates (which are more or less chemically identical). On heating to , the nearly water-free form, called Œ≥-anhydrite (CaSO4¬∑nH2O where n = 0 to 0.05) is produced. Œ≥-Anhydrite reacts slowly with water to return to the dihydrate state, a property exploited in some commercial desiccants. On heating above 250 ¬∞C, the completely anhydrous form called Œ≤-anhydrite or \\"natural\\" anhydrite is formed. Natural anhydrite does not react with water, even over geological timescales, unless very finely ground. The variable composition of the hemihydrate and Œ≥-anhydrite, and their easy inter-conversion, is due to their nearly identical crystal structures containing \\"channels\\" that can accommodate variable amounts of water, or other small molecules such as methanol. =Food industry= The calcium sulfate hydrates are used as a coagulant in products such as tofu. For the FDA, it is permitted in Cheese and Related Cheese Products; Cereal Flours; Bakery Products; Frozen Desserts; Artificial Sweeteners for Jelly & Preserves; Condiment Vegetables; and Condiment Tomatoes and some candies. It is known in the E number series as E516, and the FAO knows it as a firming agent, a flour treatment agent, a sequestrant, and a leavening agent. = Dentistry = Calcium sulfate has a long history of use in dentistry. It has been used in bone regeneration as a graft material and graft binder/extender and as a barrier in guided tissue regeneration. It is an unusually biocompatible material and is completely resorbed following implantation. It does not evoke a significant host response and creates a calcium-rich milieu in the area of implantation. =Other uses= Drierite When sold at the anhydrous state as a desiccant with a color-indicating agent under the name Drierite, it appears blue (anhydrous) or pink (hydrated) due to impregnation with cobalt(II) chloride, which functions as a moisture indicator. Up to the 1970s, commercial quantities of sulfuric acid were produced in Whitehaven (Cumbria, UK) from anhydrous calcium sulfate. Upon being mixed with shale or marl, and roasted, the sulfate liberates sulfur trioxide gas, a precursor in sulfuric acid production, the reaction also produces calcium silicate, a mineral phase essential in cement clinker production.Whitehaven Coast Archeological Survey : CaSO4 \\\\+ SiO2 -> CaSiO3 \\\\+ SO3 Production and occurrence The main sources of calcium sulfate are naturally occurring gypsum and anhydrite, which occur at many locations worldwide as evaporites. These may be extracted by open-cast quarrying or by deep mining. World production of natural gypsum is around 127 million tonnes per annum.Gypsum, USGS, 2008 In addition to natural sources, calcium sulfate is produced as a by-product in a number of processes: *In flue-gas desulfurization, exhaust gases from fossil-fuel power stations and other processes (e.g. cement manufacture) are scrubbed to reduce their sulfur oxide content, by injecting finely ground limestone or lime. This produces an impure calcium sulfite, which oxidizes on storage to calcium sulfate. *In the production of phosphoric acid from phosphate rock, calcium phosphate is treated with sulfuric acid and calcium sulfate precipitates. *In the production of hydrogen fluoride, calcium fluoride is treated with sulfuric acid, precipitating calcium sulfate. *In the refining of zinc, solutions of zinc sulfate are treated with lime to co-precipitate heavy metals such as barium. *Calcium sulfate can also be recovered and re-used from scrap drywall at construction sites. These precipitation processes tend to concentrate radioactive elements in the calcium sulfate product. This issue is particular with the phosphate by-product, since phosphate ores naturally contain uranium and its decay products such as radium-226, lead-210 and polonium-210. Calcium sulfate is also a common component of fouling deposits in industrial heat exchangers, because its solubility decreases with increasing temperature (see the specific section on the retrograde solubility). Retrograde solubility The dissolution of the different crystalline phases of calcium sulfate in water is exothermic and releases heat (decrease in Enthalpy: ŒîH < 0). As an immediate consequence, to proceed, the dissolution reaction needs to evacuate this heat that can be considered as a product of reaction. If the system is cooled, the dissolution equilibrium will evolve towards the right according to the Le Chatelier principle and calcium sulfate will dissolve more easily. The solubility of calcium sulfate increases thus when the temperature decreases. If the temperature of the system is raised, the reaction heat cannot dissipate and the equilibrium will regress towards the left according to Le Chatelier principle. The solubility of calcium sulfate decreases thus when temperature increases. This contra-intuitive solubility behaviour is called retrograde solubility. It is less common than for most of the salts whose dissolution reaction is endothermic (i.e., the reaction consumes heat: increase in Enthalpy: ŒîH > 0) and whose solubility increases with temperature. Another calcium compound, calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2, portlandite) also exhibits a retrograde solubility for the same thermodynamic reason: because its dissolution reaction is also exothermic and releases heat. So, to dissolve higher amounts of calcium sulfate or calcium hydroxide in water, it is necessary to cool down the solution close to its freezing point instead of increasing its temperature. Temperature dependence of the solubility of calcium sulfate (3 phases) in pure water. The retrograde solubility of calcium sulfate is also responsible for its precipitation in the hottest zone of heating systems and for its contribution to the formation of scale in boilers along with the precipitation of calcium carbonate whose solubility also decreases when CO2 degasses from hot water or can escape out of the system. On planet Mars 2011 findings by the Opportunity rover on the planet Mars show a form of calcium sulfate in a vein on the surface. Images suggest the mineral is gypsum.

She was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment at the Nuremberg Doctors' trial, but served only five. A survivor of Ravensbr√ºck termed her, \\"a beast masquerading as a human\\". Education and Nazi Party membership In 1937, Oberheuser obtained her medical degree in Bonn, having specialized in dermatology. Soon thereafter she joined the Nazi Party as an intern, and later served as doctor for the League of German Girls. In 1940, Oberheuser was appointed to serve as an assistant to Karl Gebhardt, then Chief Surgeon of the Schutzstaffel and Heinrich Himmler's personal doctor. War crimes Oberheuser and Gebhardt came to Ravensbr√ºck in 1942 in order to conduct experiments on its prisoners, with an emphasis on finding better methods of treating infection. They conducted gruesome medical experiments (treating purposely infected wounds with sulfanilamide, as well as bone, muscle, and nerve regeneration and transplantation) on 86 women, 74 of whom were Polish political prisoners in the camp.  Trial  Herta Oberheuser was the only female defendant in the Nuremberg \\"Doctors' trial\\", where she was convicted of crimes against humanity and sentenced to 20 years in prison.  Later life  Oberheuser was released in April 1952 for good behaviour and became a family doctor in Stocksee, near Kiel, in West Germany. She lost her position in August 1958 after a Ravensbr√ºck survivor recognized her, and the interior minister of Schleswig-Holstein, Helmut Lemke, revoked her medical license and shut down her practice. Oberheuser appealed to the Schleswig- Holstein administrative court, which rejected the appeal in December 1960. She did not practice medicine again and was fined as punishment. She died in January 1978 at the age of 66.

He shared one-half of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1989 for this work with Hans Georg Dehmelt; the other half of the Prize in that year was awarded to Norman Foster Ramsey, Jr. Early life Wolfgang Paul was born on 10 August 1913 in Lorenzkirch, Germany. He grew up in Munich where his father was a professor of pharmaceutical chemistry. After the first few years at the Technical University of Munich, he changed to the Technical University of Berlin in 1934 where he finished his Diploma in 1937 at the group of Hans Geiger. He followed his doctorate adviser Hans Kopfermann to the University of Kiel and after being drafted to the air force he finished his PhD in 1940 at the Technical University of Berlin. During World War II, he researched isotope separation, which is necessary to produce fissionable material for use in making nuclear weapons. Academic career For several years he was a private lecturer at the University of G√∂ttingen with Hans Kopfermann. He became a professor of Experimental Physics at the University of Bonn and stayed there from 1952 until 1993. For two years from 1965 to 1967 he was director of the Division of Nuclear Physics at CERN. Scientific results He developed techniques for trapping charged particles mass spectrometry by electric quadrupole fields in the 1950s. Paul traps are used extensively today to contain and study ions. He developed molecular beam lenses and worked on a 500 MeV electron synchrotron, followed by one at 2500 MeV in 1965. Later he worked on containing slow neutrons in magnetic storage rings, measuring the free neutron lifetime. He humorously referred to Wolfgang Pauli as his imaginary part. G√∂ttingen Manifesto In 1957, Paul was a signatory of the G√∂ttingen Manifesto, a declaration of 18 leading nuclear scientists of West Germany against arming the West German army with tactical nuclear weapons.

Its local government area is the City of Manningham. At the , Warrandyte had a population of 5,520. At the 2016 census, Warrandyte had a population of 5,502 and a median age of 43 years old. Warrandyte is bounded in the west by the Mullum Mullum Creek and Target Road, in the north by the Yarra River, in the east by Jumping Creek and Anzac Road, and in the south by an irregular line from Reynolds Road, north of Donvale, Park Orchards and Warrandyte South. Warrandyte was founded as a Victorian town, located in the once gold-rich rolling hills east of Melbourne, and is now on the north-eastern boundary of suburban Melbourne. Gold was first discovered in the town in 1851 and together, with towns like Bendigo and Ballarat, led the way in gold discoveries during the Victorian gold rush. Today Warrandyte retains much of its past in its surviving buildings of the Colonial period and remains a twin community with North Warrandyte, which borders the Yarra River to its north. Etymology In Australian Aboriginal mythology (see dreamtime), a Wurundjeri dreamtime story tells of a great eagle; \\"the all powerful, ever watchful creator of the world\\", named Bunjil, who \\"once gazed down upon his people from the star Altair and saw their wrong doing. Awaiting their return, with a mighty crash of thunder, he hurled down a star to destroy them\\". Where the star struck created a gorge in which much of the town today is located. Bunjil's people remembered the spot, and referred to it as Warrandyte, speculated to mean \\"that which is thrown\\".Warrandyte Diary, Number 389, August 2006.\\" History In 1851, gold was first discovered in Victoria, in Warrandyte, at Anderson's Creek, by Louis Michel, the approximate location of the site is marked by a cairn on Fourth Hill, in the Warrandyte State Park. While some mining did occur in the area throughout the peak of the gold rush, it was not until the late 19th century, after gold discoveries reduced in the more popular regions, that the area around Warrandyte was intensively mined, particularly around Fourth Hill and Whipstick Gully. Some areas continued to be mined up until the 1960s. Warrandyte Post Office opened on 1 August 1857. Clara Southern, The Road to Warrandyte, ca. 1905‚Äì1910 In the early 20th century, Warrandyte became a popular destination for artists of the Heidelberg School, who sought subject matter further into the bush. This led to the development of an artists camp and small colony. Though not as substantial as the older colonies at Heidelberg and Box Hill, several artists, such as Clara Southern and Walter Withers, who were associated with the Heidelberg School, took up residence in Warrandyte.Hammond, Victoria; Peers, Juliet. Completing the Picture: Women Artists and the Heidelberg Era. Artmoves, 1992. , p. 26 Others followed, including Penleigh Boyd, Harold Herbert, Jo Sweatman and Gus McLaren. =Bushfires= Major bushfires have swept through Warrandyte throughout history, and the town was at the centre of the Black Friday bushfires in 1939, in which 71 people lost their lives. The 1962 fires also devastated North Warrandyte. Many houses were destroyed and many lifes lost. In 2009 the Black Saturday fires in Kinglake were 15 minutes away from North Warrandyte. On February 9th of 2014, a bushfire broke out in Warrandyte burning approximately 10 hectares and destroying 3 houses. Major bushfires to have swept through Warrandyte include: *1851 - 6 February \\"Black Thursday\\" *1939 - 13 January \\"Black Friday\\" *1962 - 14‚Äì16 January *2014 - 9 February Geography Pound Bend Tunnel was created by gold miners during the gold rush to divert the Yarra River Warrandyte is situated on the southern banks of the Yarra River. The river and hills surrounding the town were once rich in gold and the ruins of mineshafts and tunnels can be found throughout the Warrandyte State Park, amongst other locations. While the central town itself is nestled into a gorge on the river, the suburb covers a reasonably large area of land and can be divided up into the following sections: Central Warrandyte comprises the main street of Ringwood-Warrandyte Road and Heidelberg-Warrandyte Road (Yarra Street), Pound Bend and the southern banks of the Yarra River. Andersons Creek flows from neighbouring South Warrandyte and Warranwood into the Yarra just before the beginning of Pound Bend. This area is where several gullies converge and create a geographical hole, with Fourth Hill to the east and the hills on the eastern banks of the Mullum Mullum Creek to the west. This becomes evident when driving through Warrandyte on Heidelberg-Warrandyte Road, as the hills guide the road down towards Andersons Creek. The Eastern banks of the Mullum Mullum Creek were home to vast orchards overflowing from neighbouring East Doncaster and as a result, much of the vegetation has been cleared. Today the area is covered in large residential properties due to local council regulations allowing land to be subdivided into larger sites. Transportation Deciduous trees alongside the main street in Warrandyte during autumn Warrandyte is serviced primarily by the private car, however a bus service actively operates along the main roads of Ringwood-Warrandyte Road and Heidelberg-Warrandyte Road (Yarra Street). Community The Warrandyte Festival, one of the last remaining volunteer-run festivals in Victoria, is held every year in mid March. Typically, the festival features a variety of attractions. Many stalls sell local produce or crafts and there are numerous historical exhibits, as well as safety demonstrations by the CFA. Facilities Warrandyte contains a general post office, tennis courts, a community centre, an RSL, several bed and breakfasts, restaurants, a police station, a CFA Fire Station, two kindergartens, two recreational ovals (AFL Football and Cricket), Warrandyte Community Church, Uniting and Anglican places of worship, Andersons Creek Cemetery and a Scout hall, canoe launching ramps, a skatepark, nurseries and tearooms and the Crystal Brook Holiday Centre.Melways Street Directory, 33rd Edition 2006. It also has a thriving arts community including theatre, pottery and painting centred at the Mechanics Institute Hall.

Using cryo-electron microscopy it has been found that a much smaller periplasmic space is also present in gram-positive bacteria., Matias, V. R., and T. J. Beveridge. 2005. Cryo-electron microscopy reveals native polymeric cell wall structure in Bacillus subtilis 168 and the existence of a periplasmic space. Mol.

J Bacteriol. 188:6652-6660. The periplasm may constitute up to 40% of the total cell volume of gram-negative bacteria, but is a much smaller percentage in gram-positive bacteria. Several types of enzyme are present in the periplasm including alkaline phosphatases, cyclic phosphodiesterases, acid phosphatases and 5‚Äô-nucleotidases. Although the bacteria are conventionally divided into two main groups‚Äîgram-positive and gram-negative, based upon their Gram-stain retention property‚Äîthis classification system is ambiguous as it can refer to three distinct aspects (staining result, cell-envelope organization, taxonomic group), which do not necessarily coalesce for some bacterial species.Gupta, R.S. (1998) Protein phylogenies and signature sequences: A reappraisal of evolutionary relationships among archaebacteria, eubacteria and eukaryotes. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

A phylum level perspective on bacterial cell envelope architecture. Trends Microbiol. 18:464-470. However, although Gram-staining response of bacteria is an empirical criterion, its basis lies in the marked differences in the ultrastructure and chemical composition of the two main kinds of bacteria. These bacteria are distinguished from each other based on the presence or absence of an outer lipid membrane, which is a more reliable and fundamental characteristic of the bacterial cells.Gupta, R. S. (1998). What are archaebacteria: life‚Äôs third domain or monoderm prokaryotes related to Gram- positive bacteria? A new proposal for the classification of prokaryotic organisms. Molecular Microbiology.29(3):695-707. All gram-positive bacteria are bounded by a single unit lipid membrane; they generally contain a thick layer (20-80 nm) of peptidoglycan responsible for retaining the Gram-stain. A number of other bacteria which are bounded by a single membrane but stain gram-negative due to either lack of the peptidoglycan layer (viz., mycoplasmas) or their inability to retain the Gram-stain due to their cell wall composition, also show close relationship to the gram-positive bacteria. For the bacterial (prokaryotic) cells that are bounded by a single cell membrane the term \\"monoderm bacteria\\" or \\"monoderm prokaryotes\\" has been proposed. In contrast to gram-positive bacteria, all archetypical gram- negative bacteria are bounded by a cytoplasmic membrane as well as an outer cell membrane; they contain only a thin layer of peptidoglycan (2‚Äì3 nm) between these membranes. The presence of both inner and outer cell membranes forms and define the periplasmic space or periplasmic compartment. These bacterial cells with two membranes have been designated as diderm bacteria. The distinction between the monoderm and diderm prokaryotes is supported by conserved signature indels in a number of important proteins (viz. DnaK, GroEL).Gupta, R. S. (2011). Origin of diderm (Gram-negative) bacteria: antibiotic selection pressure rather than endosymbiosis likely led to the evolution of bacterial cells with two membranes. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. 100:171-182. In diderm bacteria, the periplasm contains a thin cell wall composed of peptidoglycan. In addition, it includes solutes such as ions and proteins, which are involved in wide variety of functions ranging from nutrient binding, transport, folding, degradation, substrate hydrolysis, to peptidoglycan synthesis, electron transport, and alteration of substances toxic to the cell (xenobiotic metabolism). Importantly, the periplasm is devoid of ATP. References Further reading * D. White, The Physiology and Biochemistry of Prokaryotes, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2000, pp. 22\\\\.

It advocates for the independence of Saskatchewan and libertarian ideals. The party is led by Neil Fenske and is not affiliated with any federal party.  History  The WIP of Saskatchewan was formed on July 12, 2003, and nominated 17 candidates for the November 5, 2003 provincial election. These candidates won a total of 2,735 votes, or 0.64% of the provincial total. The former party president was Frank Serfas, and the former deputy leader was David Sawkiw. The party nominated eight candidates for the 2007 election, two in the 2011 election, and four in the 2016 election. The party is not affiliated with the Western Canada Concept Party of British Columbia or the British Columbia-based Western Block Party, and has made considerable effort to distance itself from Doug Christie, the leader of those parties. Whereas Christie has been mired in controversy for defending Holocaust deniers and has been accused of being an anti-Semite, the WIP of Saskatchewan has made an explicit statement in support of the State of Israel. The WIP of Saskatchewan also has no ties with the Separation Party of Alberta, the Western Canada Party, or the Alberta Independence Party.  Ideology  The WIP of Saskatchewan's platform is libertarian and secular in nature, a distinguishing feature from some of the other separatist parties in Western Canada. It supports fiscally conservative and socially moderate policies. Though the party was originally established with a pro-independence stance, in recent years it has focused less on separatism and has instead advocated for strengthened political power at the federal level for Saskatchewan, to combat the perceived notion of Western alienation.

The first aircraft was delivered to the 89th Airlift Wing at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland in late June 1998. Two further second-hand Boeing 757s were acquired in 2010 for government use although it is not clear which agency they are operated by; they have been frequently associated with the Foreign Emergency Support Team of the U.S. State Department.\\"Foreign Emergency Support Team (FEST)\\". US Department of State. Retrieved on May 8, 2013 The additional two aircraft, designated C-32B, have been modified with aerial refueling equipment and extended range fuel cells giving them a range.

Byeonhan was one of the Samhan (or \\"Three Hans\\"), along with Mahan and Jinhan. History This early part of the Three Kingdoms period is sometimes called the Proto‚ÄìThree Kingdoms period. Byeonhan, like the other Samhan confederacies, appears descended from the Jin state of southern Korea. Archaeological evidence indicates an increase in military activity and weapons production among the Byeonhan in the 3rd century, especially an increase in iron arrowheads and cuirasses (Barnes 2000). This may be associated with the decline of Byeonhan and the rise of the more centralized Gaya Confederacy, which most Byeonhan states joined. Gaya was subsequently annexed by Silla, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. Culture and trade The Chinese Records of Three Kingdoms state that the language and culture of Byeonhan was essentially the same as Jinhan, and archaeological artifacts show little difference. Byeonhan may have simply referred to the chiefdoms in the south and west of the Nakdong River valley which were not formal members of the Jinhan confederacy. According to the 3rd-century Chinese chronicle Records of Three Kingdoms, Byeonhan was known for the production of iron; it exported iron to the Han commanderies to the north, Yamato Japan and the rest of the Korean peninsula. It was also a center of stoneware manufacture. Member statelets According to the Records of Three Kingdoms, Byeonhan consisted of 12 statelets: * Mirimidong (), present-day Miryang. * Jeopdo (), present-day Haman. * Gojamidong (), present-day Goseong. * Gosunsi (), present-day Jinju, Sacheon or Goseong. * Ballo (), present-day Seongju. * Nangno (), present-day Hadong or Namhae. * Gunmi (), present-day Sacheon. * Mioyama (), present-day Goryeong. * Gamno (), present-day Gimcheon. * Guya (), present-day Gimhae. * Jujoma (), present-day Gimcheon. * Anya (), present-day Haman. * Dongno (), present-day Dongnae.

In 1961 it was merged into the United States Strike Command (STRICOM). The word \\"STRAC\\" was also used to describe a well organized, well turned-out soldier or unit. Background STRAC was a designation given to the XVIII Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, in 1958. The designation was, in reality, the assignment of an additional mission rather than a true designation. The additional mission was to provide a flexible strike capability that could deploy worldwide on short notice without declaration of an emergency. The 4th Infantry Division at Fort Lewis, Washington, Combat Command A of the 1st Armored Division at Fort Hood, Texas, and the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, were designated as STRAC's first-line divisions, while the 1st Infantry Division at Fort Riley, Kansas, and the 82d Airborne Division at Fort Bragg were to provide backup in the event of general war. The 5th Logistical Command (later reflagged as 1st Logistical Command), also at Fort Bragg, would provide the corps with logistics support, while Fort Bragg's XVIII Airborne Corps Artillery would control artillery units.Mark A.

The 3d Armored Cavalry Regiment returned to the United States from Germany in February 1958, and was once again stationed at Fort Meade. The regiment became part of STRAC and, from 1958 to 1961, it was the recipient of four STRAC streamers, awarded for superior readiness and training. In reaction to the Berlin Crisis, the regiment redeployed to Germany in October 1961. Alerted for movement on 10 October, although scattered at different training sites along the Eastern Seaboard, the regiment arrived at its new duty stations of Baumholder and Kaiserslautern exactly thirty days later.http://www.hood.army.mil/3d_acr/docs/part_2.pdf STRAC and the XVIII Airborne Corps provided the Army forces to the Navy's CINCLANT as unified commander during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Flexible response September 1961, Fort Hood again became the home for the III Corps, and in February 1962, III Corps was assigned as part of the STRAC.http://pao.hood.army.mil/Sub/Hood_History.htm In March 1962 the 2nd Infantry Division was designated as a Strategic Army Corps (STRAC) unit. Following this the Division became engaged in intensified combat training, tactical training, and field training exercises, in addition to special training designed to improve operational readiness. Limitations Although the STRAC mission was to provide an easily deployable force for use in a limited war or other emergency, its ability to deploy overseas was limited by airlift constraints. Without the declaration of a national emergency, the required lift assets would not be released to support a STRAC deployment. The Army faced problems with both the Air Force who would provide the expected transportation and from foreign governments for the expected use of their airspace and airports.p.240 O'Connell, Aaron B.

He was also the President of Vanuatu for two brief periods lasting about a month each, during 1994 and 2004.  Biography  Maseng had been acting president of Vanuatu from January 30 to March 2, 1994, while he was speaker of parliament and an acting president was needed in the interval between the expiry of a president's term and the next presidential election. In the 2004 presidential elections, Maseng was one of 32 candidates, and a two-thirds majority in parliament was needed to win. Balloting started on April 8, but this session and another session on April 10 failed to result in the required majority for any candidate. In the fourth round of balloting on April 12 (Easter Monday), Maseng defeated the government's candidate, Kalkot Mataskelekele, by a vote of 41 to 16, and was sworn in immediately. He was removed as president on May 11, 2004, by the Supreme Court, which ruled that the election was invalid because of a rule banning people with criminal records from being elected. It had been revealed that he was serving a suspended sentence on corruption charges, including receiving stolen goods. He was a member of the conservative Francophone Union of Moderate Parties.

Until the building of Highbury Square it was the most developed garden square in London built as private housing. At one time it was home to more than 70 MPs, and at least 10 Lords. At the time of its construction its 1,250 upmarket flats were billed by Sir Nikolaus Pevsner as the \\"largest self-contained block of flats in Europe\\". To an extent, their design has been a model for later municipal developments. History Grosvenor Road entrance to Dolphin Square Dolphin Square is on the site of the former works of the developer and builder Thomas Cubitt, who created the surrounding Pimlico district in the 19th century. An Army clothing factory was built on the site after Cubitt's death, and stood until 1933, when the leasehold on the site reverted to the Duke of Westminster. An American company, the Frederick French Corporation, bought the freehold for the site from the Duke, with plans to build a large residential development, Ormonde Court. The precarious financial situation of the Frederick French Corporation resulted in the sale of the site to Richard Rylands Costain (founder of the nascent Costain Group), who began to construct his own development in 1935. Lord Amulree formally opened the building on 25 November 1936. A. P. Herbert, writing in Dolphin Square (a promotional booklet produced for Costains in 1935, with illustrations by H. M. Bateman) described the Square as \\"a city of 1,250 flats, each enjoying at the same time most of the advantages of the separate house and the big communal dwelling place\\". The provision of a restaurant made him fear that \\"fortunate wives will not have enough to do. A little drudgery is good for wives, perhaps. The Dolphin lady may be spoiled\\". On purchasing the site, Costain remarked to a colleague: \\"in two or three years we'll either drive up to this spot in a Rolls-Royce, or we'll be standing here selling matches\\". In 1958, Costains sold Dolphin Square, as it was now known, for ¬£2.4 million to Sir Maxwell Joseph, who sold it to Lintang Investments in 1959 for ¬£3.1 million. Westminster City Council bought the lease of the block for ¬£4.5 million in the mid-1960s, and subsequently sub-let it to the Dolphin Square Trust, an effective housing association, which had been newly created for the purpose. In January 2006, the Trust and the Council sold Dolphin Square to the American Westbrook Holdings group for ¬£200 million. Accommodation is provided in 13 blocks (or \\"houses\\"), each named after a famous navigator or admiral. At the south (Thames) side of the Square the houses are Grenville, Drake, Raleigh and Hawkins. Moving from the river up the west side, there are Nelson, Howard, Beatty, and Duncan. A hotel and administration offices, on the north side of the Square, are in Dolphin House, previously known as Rodney. Heading south from the hotel there are Keyes, Hood, Collingwood and Frobisher. The estate contains a swimming pool, bar, brasserie (all of which were renovated in 2008), gymnasium, and shopping arcade. In the basement are a launderette and car park. A tennis court and croquet lawn overlook the River Thames. Until 21 January 1970, London Transport bus route 134 showed PIMLICO Dolphin Square as a destination and terminated in Chichester Street.  Architecture  Costains appointed the architect Gordon Jeeves to design Dolphin Square and he was assisted by Cecil Eve. Oscar Faber was the consultant engineer. Up to that point, Dolphin Square was Jeeves's largest project and he had played a part in designing other London buildings such as the National Radiator Building and later at Berkeley Square House. Dolphin Square is a neo-Georgian building and has a reinforced concrete structure with external facings of brick and stone. Original sound proofing was provided by compressed cork insulation in the floors. The original cost for the construction of Dolphin Square and its 1,310 flats was around ¬£2,000,000. In total, it was estimated that 200,000 tonnes of earth was moved, 125,000 tons of concrete used, 12 million bricks used on the external walls and 6,700 Crittal windows installed during construction. When it opened it had flats varying in size from one-bedroom suites to flats with five bedrooms, a maid's room and three bathrooms. Onsite facilities provided for residents when completed included shops, a children‚Äôs centre and nursery, library and, in the basement, a garage for up to 300 cars. The planned riverside wharf, which would have included a cafe, marina and a terraced garden leading from Grosvenor Road to the Thames, was never built. The 3.5 acres (1.4 ha) of communal gardens were designed by Richard Sudell, president of the Institute of Landscape Architects, and since 2018 are (unlike the building) Grade II listed. The gardens are a mix of formal and informal planting with expanses of lawn, with areas themed to reflect garden styles from different parts of the world. The gardens and buildings form part of the Dolphin Square conservation area. Residents Dolphin Square The proximity of Dolphin Square to the Palace of Westminster and the headquarters of the intelligence agencies MI5 (Thames House) and MI6 (Vauxhall Cross) has attracted many politicians, peers, civil servants and intelligence agency personnel as residents. Politicians who have lived in the development include Harold Wilson, David Steel, William Hague, Estelle Morris, Beverley Hughes, Michael Mates, John Langford-Holt and Iain Mills. (Mills died in his flat in the square's Duncan House.) Other notable residents have included comedians Ben Lyon and Bud Flanagan, actor Peter Finch, writer Radclyffe Hall, former Lord Chief Justice Lord Goddard, journalist Norman Cliff, tennis writer Bud Collins, Anne, Princess Royal, and Profumo affair topless showgirls Christine Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies. Australian tennis player Rod Laver stayed here for the 1969 Wimbledon championships during his Grand Slam season. ;Soviet spy arrest John Vassall, the Soviet spy, was arrested at apartment 807 in the square's Hood House in 1962. Oswald Mosley and his wife Diana Mitford, Lady Mosley, left their apartment at Dolphin Square for internment in 1940 during the Second World War. ;Wartime base for Free French Government Grenville House was the headquarters of General De Gaulle's Free French during World War II and number 308 Hood House was used by MI5 section B5(b) responsible for infiltrating agents into potentially subversive groups from 1924 to 1946. ;Allegations by John Mann of abuse in 1998 and 2014 and discredited allegation In November 2014, Labour MP John Mann told the Daily Mail that he handed evidence of \\"abuse parties\\" by prominent MPs at Dolphin Square to the police in 1998 but that the case was quickly shelved on the orders of \\"those at the top\\". The Metropolitan Police Service opened an inquiry the same month under Operation Fairbank into allegations that prominent MPs used the block of flats as a venue for child abuse. Carl Beech, then known publicly under the pseudonym \\"Nick\\", made false allegations against several prominent men, claiming that he was taken to Dolphin Square regularly as a young boy and abused. Exaro and the BBC News both carried interviews with Beech in which he lied about being abused at Dolphin Square. The force simultaneously launched a related murder inquiry under the name Operation Midland, in relation to Beech's claims that he saw an MP strangle a child to death. On 21 March 2016, the Metropolitan Police announced that this had been closed without any charges. That year it emerged that Beech's statements were fabrications, and the police's coverage was rebuked for being seen to legitimise the claims. In 2019, Beech was convicted of making up allegations of a VIP paedophile ring. In popular culture Scenes in the 1967 sci-fi horror The Sorcerers were filmed in and around Dolphin Square. British jazz baritone saxophonist Ronnie Ross released the jazz album Cleopatra's Needle (1968), containing its first track titled \\"Dolphin Square\\", which, according to the sleeve notes, was \\"dedicated to a party, at which Zoot Sims was present, once held in a flat there ('It must have been a good one, because I don't remember it')\\". In the video for Culture Club's 1982 UK number one single \\"Do You Really Want to Hurt Me\\", scenes were filmed in the swimming pool inside the Dolphin Square complex. In British novelist Kate Atkinson's 2018 spy novel Transcription, MI5 runs a small counterespionage operation from Nelson House in Dolphin Square.

Biography  Brooks was born in Rome, New York. He attended college at the University of Rochester and subsequently studied homeopathic medicine in New York City. He dropped out after two years, however, and returned to Rochester where he married Anne Shepard in 1909. He found employment with an advertising agency in Utica, and then \\"retired\\" in 1911, evidently because he came into a considerable inheritance. His retirement was not permanent; in 1917, he went to work for the American Red Cross and he later did editorial work for several magazines, including \\"a nonfiction stint with The New Yorker 1932‚Äì1933\\". In 1940, he turned to writing for his full-time occupation. He married Dorothy Collins following the death of Anne in 1952. The first works that Brooks published were poems and short stories. Among these were a series of short stories featuring \\"a talking horse and his drunken owner\\" which was the basis for the 1960s television comedy series Mister Ed. His most enduring works, however, are the 26 books that he wrote about Freddy the Pig and his friends. Anthony Boucher and J. Francis McComas praised Freddy and the Spaceship because it \\"offers wit, sound structural plotting, genuine character-humor, and admirable English prose\\".\\"Recommended Reading\\", The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, January 1954, p. 95. Brooks died of a heart attack at his home in Roxbury, New York at age 72. He is buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in Hamilton, New York. In 2009, Overlook Press published Talking Animals and Others: The Life and Work of Walter R. Brooks, Creator of Freddy the Pig by Michael Cart . Mister Ed stories The first story that he published featuring the character Mister Ed was ‚ÄúThe Talking Horse‚Äù, featured in Liberty magazine for September 18, 1937, which contained two illustrations by Tony Sarge. The last in the series was ‚ÄúWith Teeth and Tail‚Äù, which appeared in the August 1945 issue of Argosy magazine. The short story ‚ÄúEd Signs the Pledge‚Äù in Argosy, June 1944, was reportedly the story that Arthur Lubin used to sell the concept for the Mister Ed comedy series to TV executives. The series was produced by Filmways and was syndicated initially. It was picked up by CBS in 1961 and ran on the network until 1966. In January 1963, Bantam in New York City published a paperback collection of the Mister Ed stories entitled The Original Mr. Ed which featured illustrations by Bob Bugg.Patten, Fred.

Eligibility  Under the constitution of Monaco, the crown passes according to male-preference cognatic primogeniture. Only persons descended from the reigning monarch and the reigning monarch's siblings and their descendants, whose parents have been married at some point with the monarch's approval, and who are Monegasque citizens are eligible. Children born as a result of adultery are permanently excluded. A dynast forfeits succession rights if he or she marries without the monarch's permission, along with descendants of the unapproved marriage, but can be restored into the line of succession if the marriage produces no issue and ends before the demise of the crown.Monaco Should no one be eligible to succeed according to the succession laws, a council of regency takes power until the Crown Council elects a new monarch from among the more distant descendants of the House of Grimaldi.  Line of succession  The list below includes only persons eligible to succeed to the throne (numbered 1 to 16) and the illegitimate children who would enter the line if their parents ever married. *15px Prince Rainier III (1923‚Äì2005) **15px Prince Albert II (b. 1958) *** Alexandre Grimaldi-Coste (b. 2003) *** (1) Hereditary Prince Jacques (b. 2014) *** (2) Princess Gabriella, Countess of Carlad√®s (b. 2014) ** (3) Caroline, Princess of Hanover (b. 1957) *** (4) Andrea Casiraghi (b. 1984) **** (5) Alexandre (Sasha) Casiraghi (b. 2013) **** (6) Maximilian Casiraghi (b. 2018) **** (7) India Casiraghi (b. 2015) *** (8) Pierre Casiraghi (b. 1987) **** (9) Stefano Casiraghi (b. 2017) **** (10) Francesco Casiraghi (b. 2018) *** (11) Charlotte Casiraghi (b. 1986) **** Rapha√´l Elmaleh (b. 2013) **** (12) Balthazar Rassam (b. 2018) *** (13) Princess Alexandra of Hanover (b. 1999) ** (14) Princess St√©phanie (b. 1965) *** (15) Louis Ducruet (b. 1992) ***(16) Pauline Ducruet (b. 1994) *** Camille Gottlieb (b. 1998) A person born to a dynast who was not married to the other parent at the time of birth (such as Alexandre Grimaldi-Coste, Camille Gottlieb or Rapha√´l Elmaleh) does not have any succession rights unless legitimized by his or her parents' subsequent marriage (Civil Code 229 states: \\"Les enfants l√©gitim√©s par le mariage subs√©quent auront les m√™mes droits que s'ils √©taient n√©s de ce mariage\\"). Louis and Pauline Ducruet, Alexandre (Sasha) Casiraghi and Balthazar Rassam have been legitimised by their parents' subsequent marriages. Jazmin Grace Grimaldi cannot be legitimated through her parents subsequent marriage because her mother's divorce proceedings were not finalized by the time of Jazmin's birth. As such, Jazmin is legally the product of adultery and cannot be legitimated through the subsequent marriage of her biological parents. 2002 changes Until 2002, the crown of Monaco could only pass to the direct descendants, including adopted children, of the reigning prince. As a result, Princess Antoinette was not in the line of succession and Princesses Caroline and St√©phanie would have lost their places in line at the moment of Prince Albert's accession, and there would be no further dynasts eligible to succeed to the throne. This possibility had two implications, namely that a) the throne might fall vacant and Monaco might officially become a protectorate of France should Prince Albert inherit the crown and then die without fathering or adopting a legitimate heir or b) Prince Albert might adopt an unrelated person as his heir, thereby breaking the genealogical line of the House of Grimaldi. In 2002, changes were made to the Constitution of Monaco which eliminated that concern by excluding adopted children from the line of succession and providing that, if the sovereign has no legitimate child, the crown passes to one of the dynastic siblings of the sovereign or, if not living, to one of their legitimate descendants.

Life  After studying theology at the University of Berlin, his interest in astronomy and mathematics led him to study astronomy under C. A. F. Peters at the University of K√∂nigsberg. Marth went to England in 1853 to work for George Bishop, a rich wine merchant and patron of astronomy, who financed a London observatory (in operation from 1836 to 1861). At that time, paid jobs in astronomy were quite rare. He worked as William Lassell's assistant in Malta, discovering 600 nebulae. He also discovered one of the earlier asteroids found, 29 Amphitrite, and the galaxies NGC 3, NGC 4 and NGC 15. He also did work in double stars, discovering NGC 30 in 1864. From 1883 to 1897 he worked at the Markree Observatory in Ireland where he was the second director appointed in its second period of operation. He made extensive ephemerides of solar system bodies. He even performed calculations of transits of various planets from other planets, predicting transits of Earth from Mars and many others. Craters on the Moon and Mars are named for him. The crater Marth on the Moon is about 3 km in diameter. References External links * A.

Fact-checking can be conducted before (ante hoc) or after (post hoc) the text is published or otherwise disseminated. Internal fact- checking is such checking done in-house by the publisher; when the text is analyzed by a third party, the process is called external fact-checking. Ante hoc fact-checking aims to identify errors so that the text can be corrected before dissemination, or perhaps rejected. Post hoc fact-checking is most often followed by a written report of inaccuracies, sometimes with a visual metric provided by the checking organization (e.g., Pinocchios from The Washington Post Fact Checker, or TRUTH-O-METER ratings from PolitiFact). Several organizations are devoted to post hoc fact-checking: examples include FactCheck.org and PolitiFact in the US, and Full Fact in the UK. External post hoc fact-checking organizations first arose in the US in the early 2000s, and the concept grew in relevance and spread to various other countries during the 2010s. The US remains the largest market for fact-checking. Research on the impact of fact-checking is relatively recent, but the existing research suggests that fact-checking does indeed correct perceptions among citizens as well as discourage politicians from spreading false or misleading claims.  Post hoc fact-checking  External post hoc fact-checking by independent organizations began in the United States in the early 2000s. In the 2010s, particularly following the 2016 election of Donald Trump as US President, fact-checking gained a rise in popularity and spread to multiple countries mostly in Europe and Latin America. However, the US remains the largest market for fact-checking. = Consistency across fact-checkers = One study finds that fact-checkers PolitiFact, FactCheck.org, and Washington Post's Fact Checker overwhelmingly agree on their evaluations of claims. However, a study by Morgan Marietta, David C. Barker and Todd Bowser found \\"substantial differences in the questions asked and the answers offered.\\" They concluded that this limited the \\"usefulness of fact-checking for citizens trying to decide which version of disputed realities to believe.\\" A paper by Chloe Lim, PhD student at Stanford University, found little overlap in the statements that fact-checkers check. Out of 1,065 fact-checks by PolitiFact and 240 fact- checks by The Washington Posts Fact-Checker, there were only 70 statements that both fact-checkers checked. The study found that the fact-checkers gave consistent ratings for 56 out of 70 statements, which means that one out every five times, the two fact-checkers disagree on the accuracy of statements. = Effects = Studies of post hoc fact-checking have made clear that such efforts often result in changes in the behavior, in general, of both the speaker (making them more careful in their pronouncements) and of the listener or reader (making them more discerning with regard to the factual accuracy of content); observations include the propensities of audiences to be completely unswayed by corrections to errors regarding the most divisive subjects, or the tendency to be more greatly persuaded by corrections of negative reporting (e.g., \\"attack ads\\"), and to see minds changed only when the individual in error was someone reasonably like-minded to begin with.Amazeen, Michelle (2015) \\"Monkey Cage: Sometimes political fact-checking works. Sometimes it doesn't. Here's what can make the difference.,\\" The Washington Post (online), 3 June 2015, see , accessed 27 July 2015.  Correcting misperceptions  A 2015 study found evidence of a \\"backfire effect\\" (correcting false information may make partisan individuals cling more strongly to their views): \\"Corrective information adapted from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website significantly reduced belief in the myth that the flu vaccine can give patients the flu as well as concerns about its safety. However, the correction also significantly reduced intent to vaccinate among respondents with high levels of concern about vaccine side effects‚Äîa response that was not observed among those with low levels of concern.\\" A 2017 study attempted to replicate the findings of the 2015 study but failed to do so. A 2016 study found little evidence for the \\"backfire effect\\": \\"By and large, citizens heed factual information, even when such information challenges their partisan and ideological commitments.\\" A study of Donald Trump supporters during the 2016 race similarly found little evidence for the backfire effect: \\"When respondents read a news article about Mr. Trump's speech that included F.B.I. statistics indicating that crime had \\"fallen dramatically and consistently over time,\\" their misperceptions about crime declined compared with those who saw a version of the article that omitted corrective information (though misperceptions persisted among a sizable minority).\\" A 2018 study found no evidence of a backfire effect. Studies have shown that fact-checking can affect citizens' belief in the accuracy of claims made in political advertisement. A 2020 study by Paris School of Economics and Sciences Po economists found that falsehoods by Marine Le Pen during the 2017 French presidential election campaign (i) successfully persuaded voters, (ii) lost their persuasiveness when fact-checked, and (iii) did not reduce voters' political support for Le Pen when her claims were fact-checked. A 2017 study in the Journal of Politics found that \\"individuals consistently update political beliefs in the appropriate direction, even on facts that have clear implications for political party reputations, though they do so cautiously and with some bias... Interestingly, those who identify with one of the political parties are no more biased or cautious than pure independents in their learning, conditional on initial beliefs.\\" A study by Yale University cognitive scientists Gordon Pennycook and David G. Rand found that Facebook tags of fake articles \\"did significantly reduce their perceived accuracy relative to a control without tags, but only modestly\\". A Dartmouth study led by Brendan Nyhan found that Facebook tags had a greater impact than the Yale study found. A \\"disputed\\" tag on a false headline reduced the number of respondents who considered the headline accurate from 29% to 19%, whereas a \\"rated false\\" tag pushed the number down to 16%. A 2019 study found that the \\"disputed\\" tag reduced Facebook users' intentions to share a fake news story. The Yale study found evidence of a backfire effect among Trump supporters younger than 26 years whereby the presence of both untagged and tagged fake articles made the untagged fake articles appear more accurate. In response to research which questioned the effectiveness of the Facebook \\"disputed\\" tags, Facebook decided to drop the tags in December 2017 and would instead put articles which fact-checked a fake news story next to the fake news story link whenever it is shared on Facebook. Based on the findings of a 2017 study in the journal Psychological Science, the most effective ways to reduce misinformation through corrections is by: * limiting detailed descriptions of / or arguments in favor of the misinformation; * walking through the reasons why a piece of misinformation is false rather than just labelling it false; * presenting new and credible information which allows readers to update their knowledge of events and understand why they developed an inaccurate understanding in the first place; * using video, as videos appear to be more effective than text at increasing attention and reducing confusion, making videos more effective at correcting misperception than text. A 2019 meta- analysis of research into the effects of fact-checking on misinformation found that fact-checking has substantial positive impacts on political beliefs, but that this impact weakened when fact-checkers used \\"truth scales\\", refuted only parts of a claim and when they fact-checked campaign-related statements. Individuals' preexisting beliefs, ideology, and knowledge affected to what extent the fact-checking had an impact. A 2019 study in the Journal of Experimental Political Science found \\"strong evidence that citizens are willing to accept corrections to fake news, regardless of their ideology and the content of the fake stories.\\" A paper by Andrew Guess (of Princeton University), Brendan Nyhan (Dartmouth College) and Jason Reifler (University of Exeter) found that consumers of fake news tended to have less favorable views of fact-checking, in particular Trump supporters. The paper found that fake news consumers rarely encountered fact-checks: \\"only about half of the Americans who visited a fake news website during the study period also saw any fact-check from one of the dedicated fact-checking website (14.0%).\\" A 2018 study found that Republicans were more likely to correct their false information on voter fraud if the correction came from Breitbart News rather than a non-partisan neutral source such as PolitiFact. A 2020 study found that exposure to fact-checks had durable effects on reducing misperceptions.  Political discourse  A 2015 experimental study found that fact-checking can encourage politicians to not spread misinformation. The study found that it might help improve political discourse by increasing the reputational costs or risks of spreading misinformation for political elites. The researchers sent, \\"a series of letters about the risks to their reputation and electoral security if they were caught making questionable statements. The legislators who were sent these letters were substantially less likely to receive a negative fact-checking rating or to have their accuracy questioned publicly, suggesting that fact-checking can reduce inaccuracy when it poses a salient threat.\\"  Political preferences  One experimental study found that fact-checking during debates affected viewers' assessment of the candidates' debate performance and \\"greater willingness to vote for a candidate when the fact-check indicates that the candidate is being honest.\\" A study of Trump supporters during the 2016 presidential campaign found that while fact-checks of false claims made by Trump reduced his supporters' belief in the false claims in question, the corrections did not alter their attitudes towards Trump. A 2019 study found that \\"summary fact-checking\\", where the fact-checker summarizes how many false statements a politician has made, has a greater impact on reducing support for a politician than fact-checking of individual statements made by the politician. =Criticism and controversies= Political fact-checking is sometimes criticized as being opinion journalism. Criticism has included that fact-checking organizations in themselves are biased or that it is impossible to apply absolute terms such as \\"true\\" or \\"false\\" to inherently debatable claims. In September 2016, a Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey found that \\"just 29% of all Likely U.S. Voters trust media fact-checking of candidates' comments. Sixty-two percent (62%) believe instead that news organizations skew the facts to help candidates they support.\\" = Informal fact-checking = Individual readers perform some types of fact-checking, such as comparing claims in one news story against claims in another. Rabbi Moshe Benovitz, has observed that: \\"modern students use their wireless worlds to augment skepticism and to reject dogma.\\" He says this has positive implications for values development: = Detecting fake news = Fake news has become increasingly prevalent over the last few years, with the 2016 election revealing that online media platforms were especially susceptible to disseminating disinformation and misinformation . Fake news articles tend to come from satirical news websites or individual websites with an incentive to propagate false information, either as clickbait or to serve a purpose. Since these articles typically hope to intentionally promote biased or incorrect information, these articles are difficult to detect. When identifying a source of information, one must look at many attributes, including but not limited to the content of the email and social media engagements. The language, specifically, is typically more inflammatory in fake news than real articles, in part because the purpose is to confuse and generate clicks. Furthermore, modeling techniques such as n-gram encodings and bag of words have served as other linguistic techniques to determine the legitimacy of a news course. On top of that, researchers have determined that visual-based cues also play a factor in categorizing an article, specifically some features can be designed to assess if a picture was legitimate, and provides us more clarity on the news. There is also many social context features that can play a role, as well as the model of spreading the news. Websites such as ‚ÄúSnopes‚Äù try to detect this information manually, while certain universities are trying to build mathematical models to do this themselves. Some individuals and organizations publish their fact-checking efforts on the internet. These may have a special subject-matter focus, such as Snopes.com's focus on urban legends or the Reporters' Lab at Duke University's focus on providing resources to journalists. = Fake News and Social Media = The adaptation of social media as a legitimate and commonly used platform has created extensive concerns for fake news in this domain. The spread of fake news via social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram presents the opportunity for extremely negative effects on society therefore new fields of research regarding fake news detection on social media is gaining momentum. However, fake news detection on social media presents challenges that renders previous data mining and detection techniques inadequate. As such, researchers are calling for more work to be done regarding fake news as characterized against psychology and social theories and adapting existing data mining algorithms to apply to social media networks. Further, multiple scientific articles have been published urging the field further to find automatic ways in which fake news can be filtered out of social media timelines.  Ongoing research in fact-checking and detecting fake news  Donald Trump, a prominent figure in regards to fake news Since the 2016 United States presidential election, fake news has been a popular topic of discussion by President Trump and news outlets. The reality of fake news had become omnipresent, and a lot of research has gone into understanding, identifying, and combating fake news. Also, a number of researchers began with the usage of fake news to influence the 2016 presidential campaign. One research found evidence of pro-Trump fake news being selectively targeted on conservatives and pro-Trump supporters in 2016. The researchers found that social media sites, Facebook in particular, to be powerful platforms to spread certain fake news to targeted groups to appeal to their sentiments during the 2016 presidential race. Additionally, researchers from Stanford, NYU, and NBER found evidence to show how engagement with fake news on Facebook and Twitter was high throughout 2016. Recently, a lot of work has gone into detecting and identifying fake news through machine learning and artificial intelligence. In 2018, researchers at MIT's CSAIL (Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab) created and tested a machine learning algorithm to identify false information by looking for common patterns, words, and symbols that typically appear in fake news. More so, they released an open-source data set with a large catalog of historical news sources with their veracity scores to encourage other researchers to explore and develop new methods and technologies for detecting fake news. International Fact-Checking Day The concept for International Fact- Checking Day was introduced at a conference for journalists and fact-checkers at the London School of Economics in June 2014. The holiday was officially created in 2016 and first celebrated on April 2, 2017. The idea for International Fact-Checking day rose out of the many misinformation campaigns found on the internet, particularly social media sites. It rose in importance after the 2016 elections, which brought fake news, as well as accusations of it, to the forefront of media issues. The holiday is held on April 2 because \\"April 1 is a day for fools. April 2 is a day for facts.\\" Activities for International Fact-Checking Day consist of various media organizations contributing to fact-checking resources, articles, and lessons for students and the general public to learn more about how to identify fake news and stop the spread of misinformation. 2020's International Fact-Checking Day focused specifically on how to accurately identify information about COVID-19.  Ante hoc fact-checking  Among the benefits of printing only checked copy is that it averts serious, sometimes costly, problems. These problems can include lawsuits for mistakes that damage people or businesses, but even small mistakes can cause a loss of reputation for the publication. The loss of reputation is often the more significant motivating factor for journalists. Fact checkers verify that the names, dates, and facts in an article or book are correct. For example, they may contact a person who is quoted in a proposed news article and ask the person whether this quotation is correct, or how to spell the person's name. Fact-checkers are primarily useful in catching accidental mistakes; they are not guaranteed safeguards against those who wish to commit journalistic frauds. = As a career = Professional fact checkers have generally been hired by newspapers, magazines, and book publishers, probably starting in the early 1920s with the creation of Time magazine in the United States, though they were not originally called \\"fact-checkers\\". Fact checkers may be aspiring writers, future editors, or freelancers engaged other projects; others are career professionals. Historically, the field was considered women's work, and from the time of the first professional American fact checker through at least the 1970s, the fact checkers at a media company might be entirely female or primarily so. The number of people employed in fact-checking varies by publication. Some organizations have substantial fact- checking departments. For example, The New Yorker magazine had 16 fact checkers in 2003. Others may hire freelancers per piece, or may combine fact- checking with other duties. Magazines are more likely to use fact checkers than newspapers. Television and radio programs rarely employ dedicated fact checkers, and instead expect others, including senior staff, to engage in fact-checking in addition to their other duties. =Checking original reportage= Stephen Glass began his journalism career as a fact-checker. He went on to invent fictitious stories, which he submitted as reportage, and which fact-checkers at The New Republic (and other weeklies for which he worked) never flagged. Michael Kelly, who edited some of Glass's concocted stories, blamed himself, rather than the fact-checkers, saying: \\"Any fact- checking system is built on trust ... If a reporter is willing to fake notes, it defeats the system. Anyway, the real vetting system is not fact-checking but the editor.\\" = Education on fact-checking = With the circulation of fake news on the internet, many organizations have dedicated time to create guidelines to help read to verify the information they are consuming. Many universities across America provide university students resources and tools to help them verify their sources. Universities provide access to research guides that help students conduct thorough research with reputable sources within academia. Organizations like FactCheck.org, OntheMedia.org, and PolitiFact.com provide procedural guidelines that help individuals navigate the process to fact-check a source. MIT and Stanford began an online MOOC course in the fall of 2020 called Sorting Truth From Fiction: Civic Online Reasoning. This course is for educators that want to teach students how to do basic fact-checking. =Books on professional fact-checking= * Sarah Harrison Smith spent some time and also headed the fact-checking department for The New York Times. She is the author of the book, The Fact Checker's Bible. * Jim Fingal worked for several years as a fact-checker at The Believer and McSweeney's and is co- author with John D'Agata of The Lifespan of a Fact which is an inside look at the struggle between fact-checker (Fingal) and author (D'Agata) over an essay that pushed the limits of the acceptable \\"artistic license\\" for a non-fiction work. = Alumni of the role = The following is a list of individuals for whom it has been reported, reliably, that they have played such a fact- checking role at some point in their careers, often as a stepping point to other journalistic endeavors, or to an independent writing career: * Susan Choi ‚Äì American novelist * Anderson Cooper ‚Äì Television anchorman * Esther Dyson ‚Äì technologist * Nancy Franklin ‚Äì New Yorker staff writer * William Gaddis ‚Äì American novelist * Virginia Heffernan ‚Äì The New York Times television critic * Roger Hodge ‚Äì Former editor, Harper's Magazine * David D.

It was invented in 1865 and patented and put into production in 1870, and was the first commercially produced typewriter.  Design  The writing ball (Danish: skrivekugle) was invented in 1865 by the reverend Rasmus Malling-Hansen (1835‚Äì1890) principal of the Royal Institute for the Deaf-Mutes in Copenhagen. The Hansen ball was a combination of unusual design and ergonomic innovations: its distinctive feature was an arrangement of 52 keys on a large brass hemisphere, causing the machine to resemble an oversized pincushion. From the book Hvem er Skrivekuglens Opfinder, written by Malling-Hansen's daughter Johanne Agerskov, we know how Malling-Hansen made experiments with a model of his writing ball made out of porcelain. He tried out different placements of the letters on the keys, to work out the placement that led to the quickest writing speed. He ended up placing the most frequently used letters to be touched by the fastest writing fingers, and also placed most of the vowels to the left and the consonants to the right. This, together with the short pistons which went directly through the ball, made the writing speed of the writing ball very fast. Like most of the early 19th-century typewriters, it did not allow the paper to be seen as it passed through the device. = Early designs = The first models typed on a paper attached to a cylinder, which could be made to move both rotationally with the cylinder and longitudinally along the cylinder, enabling the user to format and space the letters manually. The user would attach a piece of white paper and a sheet of coloring paper onto the cylinder by way of several clips. These models also included an electro-magnet for the Ball which controlled both the typewriter's movement and manipulation, thus making Malling-Hansen's machine the first electric typewriter. This electro-magnet was powered by a 10 or 12-cell battery, and controlled a mechanical escapement in the typewriter's clockwork, moving the carriage a fixed amount each time one of the pistons was depressed. = Improvements = Malling-Hansen made several improvements on his invention throughout the 1870s and 1880s, and in 1874 he patented the next model, and now the cylinder was replaced by a flat mechanical paper-frame. The electromagnetic battery was still used to move the paper along as the Ball typed upon it, and the design led to a lower possibility for error. Malling- Hansen improved further on his design, and created a semi-cylindrical frame to hold one sheet of paper. This best known model was first patented in 1875, and now the battery was replaced by a mechanical escapement. All these improvements made for a simpler and more compact writing apparatus.  Sale and popular use  It was exhibited at a great industrial exhibition in Copenhagen in 1873, at the world exhibition in Vienna in 1873, and at the Paris exhibition or Exposition Universelle. All through the 1870s it won several awards. The writing ball was sold in many countries in Europe, and it is known that it was still in use in offices in London as late as 1909. But due to its hand-crafted production, it was overtaken in the market by the mass-produced Sholes and Glidden typewriter which E. Remington and Sons started to make in 1873. Malling-Hansen also invented a very high speed writing machine for stenography, called the Takygraf, and a copying technique called the Xerografi‚Äîboth invented in 1872. More-or-less intact Hansen balls have fetched hundreds of thousands of Euros in auctions. Few remain in existence today. In 1881, when he had serious problems with his sight, Friedrich Nietzsche wanted to buy a typewriter to enable him to continue his writing, and from letters to his sister it is known that he personally was in contact with \\"the inventor of the typewriter, Mr Malling-Hansen from Copenhagen\\". He mentioned to his sister that he had received letters and also a typewritten postcard as an example. Nietzsche received his writing ball in 1882 directly from the inventor, Rasmus Malling-Hansen, in Copenhagen, Denmark. It was the newest model, the portable tall one with a color ribbon, serial number 125, and several typescripts are known to have been written by him on this writing ball (approximately 60). It is known that Nietzsche was also familiar with the newest model from E. Remington and Sons (model 2), but he wanted to buy a portable typewriter, so he chose to buy the Malling-Hansen writing ball, as this model was lightweight and easy to carry. Unfortunately, Nietzsche wasn't totally satisfied with his purchase and never really mastered the use of the instrument. A number of theories have been advanced to explain why Nietzsche did not make more use of it. For example, R√ºdiger Safranski indicates it was \\"defective\\".R√ºdiger Safranski, Nietzsche: A Philosophical Biography, W. W. Norton & Company, 2002, p250 New research indicates Nietzsche was not aware that his trouble in using the machine had been caused by damage to it during transportation to Genoa in Italy, where he lived at the time,Dieter Eberwein, Nietzsches Schreibkugel, Eberwein Typoskript, 2005 and when he turned to a mechanic who had no typewriter repair skills, the man managed to damage the writing ball even more. Nietzsche claimed that his thoughts were influenced by his use of a typewriter (\\"Our writing instruments contribute to our thoughts\\", 1882).Don Ihde, Bodies in Technology, University of Minnesota Press, 2001, p97 As one researcher has noted, \\"Nietzsche's interest in rhetoric and his experience of the typewriter framed his understanding of language in a highly symbolic way: the traditions of the philosophy of language versus the scientific and technological conditions of knowledge.\\"Christian Emden, Nietzsche on Language, Consciousness, and the Body, University of Illinois Press, 2005, p28 On February 16, 1882 he even made a poem about his writing ball.

The church was named in honor of the missionary Saint Francis Xavier. It was raised to the status of a Minor Basilica in 1956. The church and rectory were listed together on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. History The Main Altar (foreground) and former High Altar (background) Dyersville was originally settled by English immigrants. Within a few years the English moved on, and many German immigrants began to arrive in the area. A parish was founded to serve these immigrants in 1859. The first St. Francis Xavier Church was completed in 1862. The parish grew quickly and the church had to be doubled in size by 1869. By 1880, it became clear that with the increasing Catholic population of Dyersville and the surrounding area, the old church building would no longer be adequate. A new church building program was begun in the mid-1880s. The parish decided on a large Gothic Revival style building in order to serve the increased population. Dubuque architects Fridolin Heer, Sr. and his son Fridolin Heer, Jr. designed the church. The priest at the time, Anton Kortenkamp (1834-1889), also had the foresight to have the altar placed upon a foundation of solid rock, which is one of the requirements for an altar to be consecrated. Construction was begun in 1887, and the cornerstone was laid on June 3, 1888. The new church was dedicated by Bishop John Hennessy on December 3, 1889. When the building was dedicated, special trains brought people from all over the state of Iowa to witness the ceremony. It cost approximately $100,000 dollars to build the church. After the completion of the present building, the old church was converted into classrooms. It was later torn down after a new school was completed. Electric lights were added to the church in 1904. The interior of the church is decorated with a number of paintings and frescoes. Much of this work was done by Milwaukee artists Clotilda and Alphonse Brielmaier from 1904 to 1905. Work to either touch-up the original frescoes or to partially cover some of them was done in 1930 and 1955. The rectory was built to the west of the church in 1935. The brick residence contains 14 rooms. The rooms are a combination of private living space and offices. A. J. Osterhaus Construction of Dyersville was the contractor who built the rectory. A garage and a passageway connects it to the Basilica. Wall fresco details The move to elevate St. Francis Xavier to a minor basilica began in the 1940s. Then-Father Mathias M. Hoffman, who had served as a military chaplain in Europe in World War I and World War II, began to advance the cause to Vatican officials. The cause was furthered when a high ranking German Cardinal, Konrad von Preysing, visited the church. In the mid-1950s the church building was consecrated. On the interior there are a number of small gold crosses on the side walls, marking the twelve places where the church walls were anointed with chrism when the church was consecrated. Once consecrated a church building may never be used for any other purpose and only a consecrated church can be elevated to the rank of a Basilica. Previously the parish had worked hard to attain and maintain a debt- free status, a preliminary requirement before a church can be consecrated. On May 11, 1956 the church was elevated to the rank of a Minor Basilica by Pope Pius XII. It was the twelfth church in the United States to receive this honor. A mass officially naming the church as a Basilica attracted crowds from all over the state, as well as many high ranking clergy. An addition was made to the south side of the Basilica in 1989. It contains a handicapped elevator, restrooms and access to the basement of the Basilica. In the mid-1990s, the parish began to offer a Tridentine Mass at 12:00 p.m. on Sundays. This mass is either said or sung in Latin according to the 1962 Rite. At other times the Noon Mass is offered in Spanish. The interior of the church was refurbished from 2000 to 2001. The paintings and frescoes were cleaned. Other frescoes that were hidden under coats of paint were restored. The Baldacchino, the main altars, the side altars, and the statues were cleaned and restored. This was possible due to a gift from a parishioner. The church building The Rose Window The basilica features Ruskinian Gothic Revival architecture. The two steeples are tall with crosses that cap the spires. This helps make the church visible from miles away across the rolling lightly forested farmland. Pilots often use these steeples as landmarks during flights. The church is a rectangular structure that measures and is high. It has a polygonal apse on its west side. The interior includes columns and vaulted ceilings. The church has a seating capacity of about 1,000 people. There are about 5,000 people total in the parish. The church has 64 large cathedral glass windows. There are two notable windows in the church. The first is the rose window above the entrances to the church, installed in 1959. It replaced a conventional church window on which the framework had become deteriorated. An Indian motif was selected in recognition of many local Indian tribes that inhabited this area 150 years earlier. The nave looking to ward the altar. The two side altars were designed by J. E. Brielmaier and erected by the Dubuque Altar Company in March 1897. They measure and are made of butternut. Mary's altar is called \\"The Coronation\\" and Joseph's is called \\"The Holy Family\\". Brielmaier also designed the butternut Baldacchino over the high altar, which is carved Italian marble by the Milwaukee Monument Company, and they were both installed in December 1897. The Baldacchino rises to a height of . The wood carved crucifix above the altar was created in 1873 for the original church. The ornate pulpit from 1906 sits to the left of the altar. Also carved in butternut, it was originally located in the nave and had a carved canopy over it. It was moved into chancel in the 1940s and the canopy was removed at that time. The images carved on the pulpit include the Evangelists: Matthew, Mark, Luke, John as well as the Apostles Peter and Paul; and five Doctors of the Western Church: Ambrose, Jerome, Gregory, Augustine and Thomas Aquinas. A free-standing altar was commissioned from the John C. Kaiser Company of Dubuque and created by Fritz Ganshirt. It was installed in 1973. St. Francis Xavier ministering to the Indians Above the high altar is a large central painting of the heavenly liturgy mentioned in Revelations 5: the Adoration of the Mystical Lamb of God. To the right are images of the prophets that include John the Baptist, Noah holding the ark, David playing the harp, Melichisedech holding bread and wine, Moses holding the Ten Commandments, and the Three Magi with their gifts. The image of Msgr. M.M. Hoffmann, the pastor when the church was named a Basilica, was added in 2000. To the left are images of saints that include the Blessed Virgin Mary, George with a spear, Lawrence with a gridiron, Stephen with stones, Joseph with a lily, Rose of Lima with a crown of roses, Peter with keys, Paul with sword, Henry the King, Boniface, Francis of Assisi, Francis Xavier, Catherine, and Cecilia playing the organ. An image of the Rev. George W. Heer, who was pastor of the parish when the original painting was done, was added during its restoration. The Stations of the Cross that line side walls were installed in 1959. The plaster bas reliefs replaced the original set that dated from 1870, which had deteriorated. The images on the center aisle were installed in 1998. It is the first floor of its kind in the United States to combine \\"epoxy based terrazzo, and computer generated water jet laser cutting for the brass molds.\\" The symbols in the floor include the coats of arms of the Archdiocese of Dubuque, Pope Pius XII, the Basilica, and the Papal insignia of the Tiara and Keys. In 1971 a new organ was installed in the church that replaced the Basilica's original pipe organ, which dated from 1913. The 27-rank organ located in the rear gallery is a custom made instrument designed for the Basilica by the Wicks Organ Company of Highland, Illinois. The organ was designed keeping in mind the size of the church and the acoustical qualities of the building. In 2019 the organ was rebuilt and expanded by the Reuter Organ Company, giving the organ a new facade of speaking pipes and adding the choir division that had been left out of the 1971 organ. Additionally due to damage from a lightning strike shortly after the 1971 organ was installed, the organ was experiencing issues with its electrical system. This electrical system was replaced with a fiber optic system which is much more resistant to electrical issues than the older organ. Because one of the roles of the basilica is to serve as the Pope's church in the event he would visit the area, the church features a special bell called a Tintinnabulum, and an umbrella called an Umbraculum. Visitation of the Pope has been heavily rumored in Vatican circles as part of the next North American trip, scheduled for 2019, and funds are expected to be appropriated so that the umbrella can be opened all the way.

Blades Hall and the Dunlap Technology building are also visible. Charles C. Myers Library Meyers Teaching and Administrative Center under construction The University of Dubuque (UD) is a private Presbyterian university in Dubuque, Iowa. About 2,200 students attend the university. History The University of Dubuque has had a long history in Dubuque since its founding in 1852. It has gone through many changes over the years and has recently experienced a controversial, but prosperous rebirth. =Early years= The institution currently known as the University of Dubuque was founded by the Rev. Adrian Van Vliet, who was pastor of the German Presbyterian Church, now known as the First Presbyterian Church of Dubuque, in 1852 to train ministers to serve the influx of immigrants to the upper midwest. Van Vliet believed the large number of immigrants -- particularly German farmers and miners -- would need ministers of the gospel for the communities they were establishing. He began by training two young men, conducting classes in his home. Although Van Vliet was Dutch, until 1896 all classes were conducted in German. Initially the school was Van Vliet's independent endeavor. In 1864 the Presbytery of Dubuque assumed control of the institution, and it became known as The German Theological School of The North West. In 1870 the Presbyterian Church of the United States took control of the school. In 1871, following the death of Van Vliet, Jacob Conzett was selected to lead the school. In 1872 the school moved to a brick building on the north side of 17th street, where it would remain for the next 35 years. In 1901 Cornelius Martin Steffens came on board as financial secretary. He proved to be an outstanding fund raiser. He also helped the school expand its curriculum. A liberal arts college and academy were added to the school, and the first college degrees were granted in 1906. It was Steffens's idea to move the school to larger quarters. Property on the western edge of the city was acquired in 1905 for that purpose. Steffens served as school president from 1908 to 1924. The school moved to its present location on University Avenue in 1907. The first buildings constructed at this new location were the Administration Building (1907, later renamed Steffens Hall), Severance Hall (1911), the University Bookstore (1912), McCormick Gymnasium (1915), Peters Commons (1916), and Van Vliet Hall (1926). All except Steffens Hall are still standing. Steffens Hall was demolished in 1980 and replaced with Blades Hall, but some of its archways were preserved and can be seen today. In 1911 the college became coeducational. In 1916 the school, then known as the Dubuque German College and Seminary, dropped the word \\"German\\" from its name, due in part to anti-German sentiment inflamed by the First World War, and became known as Dubuque College. However, present-day Loras College, located just down the street, also called itself Dubuque College. In the end, neither school kept that name. The Roman Catholic school took the name of Mathias Loras, first archbishop of Dubuque, while the Presbyterian school became the University of Dubuque on June 17, 1920. =Expansion= The new portion of the Goldthorp Science Hall, under construction in March 2006. A portion of the original building can be seen at the right rear of the image. In the 1950s and 60s, during the administration of Dr. Gaylord Couchman, a number of building projects took place: the Seminary Library (1955), Smith Hall, a seminary residence (1956), Goldthorp Science Hall (1959), Aitchison Hall, a women's residence (1963), Ficke-Laird Library (1966), Cassat Hall, a men's residence (1966), and Donnell Hall, another men's residence (1967). McCormick Gymnasium was expanded in 1967. Another large addition to it, named the Stoltz Sports Center, was made later. The original building was also renovated to include a new indoor swimming pool, racquetball courts, a hall of fame, and a multi- purpose area. =Controversy, change, and new leadership= In 1999, the university informed 14 professors, 10 of whom held tenured positions, that they would lose their positions due to a financial crisis. A report by The American Association of University Professors raised concerns about this action, and the AAUP placed the university on its list of censured administrations (where it still remains). The university was granted a provisional six-year accreditation by the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools due to concerns about academics in the wake of the financial crisis. In 2005, however, the university was granted a full accreditation after a lengthy review process. In 2003 the university received an endowment to implement the Lester G. Wendt and Michael Lester Wendt Character Initiative, currently overseen by the Wendt Center for Character Education, which among other tasks encourages ethical character development of university students and integration of the same into the university curriculum. Also associated with the Wendt name was a Wendt University Professorship, granted in 2005 to Dr. Paul Jeffries, a professor of philosophy. (Note that this is not Paul C. Jeffries, also a Ph.D. in philosophy, who used to be in academia but now works in technology.) As the Wendt professor, Dr. Jeffries was to oversee the initiative and \\"speak broadly\\" about it in the university and external community. During the same year, Dr. Jeffries came up for a new tenure contract. The university offered him a contract, but he objected to a provision restricting negative speech about the university, which he felt could interfere with his objectivity in speaking about ethics and character. The offer of tenure was immediately revoked and Dr. Jeffries was dismissed from the university, an action that stirred considerable unrest among students and faculty. =Continued development= The university has completed building additional student housing on land adjacent to Dodge Street, the main east-west thoroughfare through the city. This property remained vacant for many years until the new apartments were built. Park Village apartments are typically only available to upperclassmen. The university currently has approximately 2000 students in attendance. Academics The University of Dubuque consists of a Theological Seminary and three schools: *School of Business *School of Liberal Arts *School of Professional Programs The university is accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, the Council on Aviation Accreditation, and the Association of Theological Schools in North America. It is also approved by the State of Iowa Department of Education. Athletics The school has been involved in intercollegiate sports for many decades. The teams are called the Spartans, and the school colors are blue and white. There was a brief period, from 1925 to 1928, when the university withdrew from intercollegiate sports and focused on intramural competition. This was done because University president Karl Wettstone was opposed to the commercialization of sports and the recruiting of athletes with offers of free tuition, room, and board. There also were concerns about the salaries some coaches had received, which were felt to be excessive compared to the compensation paid other department heads. Following the reinstatement of intercollegiate competition, the University of Dubuque joined the Iowa Conference, now known as the American Rivers Conference, in 1929. The University of Dubuque is a member of NCAA Division III, and is part of the American Rivers Conference, which, in addition to the University of Dubuque, currently includes Buena Vista University, Coe College, Central College, Luther College, Loras College, Nebraska Wesleyan University, Simpson College, and Wartburg College. Men's varsity sports include football, baseball, basketball, cross-country, golf, soccer, lacrosse, indoor and outdoor track, tennis, and wrestling. Women's varsity sports include basketball, soccer, golf, cross country, softball, volleyball, lacrosse, track, and tennis. In 2008, the school officially recognized its first club sports team, ice hockey. Students now have the opportunity to participate in an increasingly popular winter sport against other conference rivals including Loras and Cornell college while attending the University of Dubuque. A recent addition to club sport includes a campus Bass Fishing team which is one of the top-ranked in the country.matt klaes Notable alumni Notable graduates of the University of Dubuque include Walter Soboleff, a Tlingit scholar, elder and religious leader. He was the first Native Alaskan to become an ordained Presbyterian minister. Solomon \\"Sol\\" Butler, a track star who set national and world records, competed in the 1920s Olympics and was one of the first black players in the National Football League as well as an early actor in Hollywood films. 1926 graduate of the University, Nemesio Rodriguez, an exchange student from Lima, Peru, later went on to become the prime minister of education for the country of Peru (he also married classmate of '26, Florence Parker), actor Tony Danza, a star of the TV sitcoms Taxi and Who's the Boss?; and novelist Eckhard Gerdes, author of thirteen published novels, including My Landlady the Lobotomist and Hugh Moore. George O'Leary, former football coach at the University of Central Florida played football at the university in the 1960s but did not graduate. O'Leary gained notoriety when he was hired then dropped as Notre Dame head coach when it was discovered that he fabricated his resume. Field of Dreams movie location Along with other places in Dubuque County, the university was used as a shooting location for the motion picture Field of Dreams. The Seminary Library, Blades Hall, and Van Vliet Hall were used in a scene where Kevin Costner's character is researching Terrance Mann. The movie made it appear the library was located in Van Vliet Hall, which is incorrect. Van Vliet is currently an office building, although a new administration building was recently completed. Also, the spot where Annie parked the family pickup truck was and still is in a \\"no parking\\" zone.

Most are small, sturdy and evergreen. The leaves, often densely covered in trichomes, spring directly from the rootstocks. Many of them are desert ferns, curling up during dry times and reviving with the coming of moisture. At the ends of veins sporangia, or spore-bearing structures, are protected by leaf margins, which curl over them. Taxonomy The genus name is derived from the Greek words œáŒµ·øñŒªŒøœÇ (cheilos), meaning \\"lip,\\" and ·ºÑŒΩŒ∏ŒøœÇ (anthos), meaning \\"flower.\\" Cheilanthes as traditionally circumscribed is now known to be highly paraphyletic, comprising at least four generically separate groups. The type species, C. micropteris, is most closely allied to the genera Aleuritopteris and Sinopteris (Schuettpelz et al.). In the early 21st century, many species, principally from the New World, were moved into the new genus Gaga and the revived genus Myriopteris. Further work remains to be done to render Cheilanthes monophyletic. Members of many other cheilanthoid genera have at times been given names in the genus. Species The circumscription of the genus was uncertain . The Checklist of Ferns and Lycophytes of the World lists species in several distinct groups. Cheilanthes sensu stricto contains about 20 species from North and tropical Central and South America: *Cheilanthes arequipensis (Maxon) R.M.Tryon & A.F.Tryon *Cheilanthes fractifera Tryon *Cheilanthes glutinosa M.Kessler & A.R.Sm. *Cheilanthes incarum Maxon *Cheilanthes incisa Kunze ex Mett. *Cheilanthes juergensii Rosenst. *Cheilanthes laciniata Sodiro *Cheilanthes leonardii Maxon *Cheilanthes leucopoda Link *Cheilanthes lonchophylla (R.M.Tryon) R.M.Tryon & A.F.Tryon *Cheilanthes macleanii (J.Sm.)

He is senior research fellow at the Centre for Contemporary Aristotelian Studies in Ethics and Politics (CASEP) at London Metropolitan University, Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at the University of Notre Dame, and Permanent Senior Distinguished Research Fellow at the Notre Dame Center for Ethics and Culture.. During his lengthy academic career, he also taught at Brandeis University, Duke University, Vanderbilt University, and Boston University. Biography MacIntyre was born on 12 January 1929 in Glasgow, to Eneas and Greta (Chalmers) MacIntyre. He was educated at Queen Mary, University of London, and has a Master of Arts degree from the University of Manchester and from the University of Oxford. He began his teaching career in 1951 at Manchester. He married Ann Peri with whom he had two daughters, Jean and Toni. He taught at the University of Leeds, the University of Essex and the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, before moving to the US in around 1969. MacIntyre has been something of an intellectual nomad, having taught at many universities in the US. He has held the following positions: *Professor of History of Ideas, Brandeis University (1969 or 1970), * Dean of the College of Arts and Professor of Philosophy, Boston University (1972), *Henry Luce Professor, Wellesley College (1980), *W.

He has also been a visiting professor at Princeton University, and is a former president of the American Philosophical Association. In 2010, he was awarded the Aquinas Medal by the American Catholic Philosophical Association. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (elected 1985), the British Academy (1994), the Royal Irish Academy (1999), and the American Philosophical Society (2005). From 2000 he was the Rev. John A. O'Brien Senior Research Professor in the Department of Philosophy (emeritus since 2010) at the University of Notre Dame, Indiana, US. He is also professor emerit and emeritus at Duke University. in July 2010 became senior research fellow at London Metropolitan University's Centre for Contemporary Aristotelian Studies in Ethics and Politics. Since his retirement from active teaching in 2010, he remains the senior distinguished research fellow of the Notre Dame Center for Ethics and Culture, where he retains an office. He continues to make public presentations, including an annual keynote as part of the Center for Ethics and Culture's Fall Conference.. He has been married three times. From 1953 to 1963 he was married to Ann Peri, with whom he had two daughters. From 1963 to 1977 he was married to former teacher and now poet Susan Willans, with whom he had a son and daughter. Since 1977 he has been married to philosopher Lynn Joy, who is also on the philosophy faculty at Notre Dame. Philosophical approach MacIntyre's approach to moral philosophy interweaves a number of complex strands. Although he largely aims to revive an Aristotelian moral philosophy based on the virtues, he claims a \\"peculiarly modern understanding\\" of this task.After Virtue, (Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame Press, 3rd edn, 2007) xii. This \\"peculiarly modern understanding\\" largely concerns MacIntyre's approach to moral disputes. Unlike some analytic philosophers who try to generate moral consensus on the basis of rationality, MacIntyre uses the historical development of ethics to circumvent the modern problem of \\"incommensurable\\" moral notions, whose merits cannot be compared in any common framework. Following Hegel and Collingwood, he offers a \\"philosophical history\\" (as opposed to analytical and phenomenological approaches) in which he concedes from the beginning that \\"there are no neutral standards available by appeal to which any rational agent whatsoever could determine\\" the conclusions of moral philosophy.After Virtue, 3, xiii. In his most famous work, After Virtue, he deprecates the attempt of Enlightenment thinkers to deduce a universal rational morality independent of teleology, whose failure led to the rejection of moral rationality altogether by successors such as Friedrich Nietzsche, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Charles Stevenson. He emphasizes how this overestimation of reason led to Nietzsche's utter repudiation of the possibility of moral rationality.After Virtue, 257 By contrast, MacIntyre attempts to reclaim more modest forms of moral rationality and argumentation which claim neither finality nor logical certainty, but which can hold up against relativistic or emotivist denials of any moral rationality whatsoever (the mistaken conclusion of Nietzsche, Sartre, and Stevenson). He revives the tradition of Aristotelian ethics with its teleological account of the good and of moral actions, as fulfilled in the medieval writings of Thomas Aquinas. This Aristotelian-Thomistic tradition, he proposes, presents \\"the best theory so far,\\" both of how things are and how we ought to act. More generally, according to MacIntyre, moral disputes always take place within and between rival traditions of thought relying on an inherited store of ideas, presuppositions, types of arguments and shared understandings and approaches. Even though there is no definitive way for one tradition in moral philosophy to logically refute another, nevertheless opposing views can dispute each others' internal coherence, resolution of imaginative dilemmas and epistemic crises, and achievement of fruitful results.After Virtue, xii‚Äìxiii Major writings =After Virtue (1981)= Probably his most widely read work, After Virtue was written when MacIntyre was already in his fifties. Up to then, MacIntyre had been a relatively influential analytic philosopher of Marxist bent whose moral inquiries had been conducted in a \\"piecemeal way, focusing first on this problem and then on that, in a mode characteristic of much analytic philosophy.\\"The Tasks of Philosophy: Selected Essays, Vol. 1 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006) viii However, after reading the works of Thomas Kuhn and Imre Lakatos on philosophy of science and epistemology, MacIntyre was inspired to change the entire direction of his thought, tearing up the manuscript he had been working on and deciding to view the problems of modern moral and political philosophy \\"not from the standpoint of liberal modernity, but instead from the standpoint of‚Ä¶ Aristotelian moral and political practice.\\"The Tasks of Philosophy: Selected Essays, Vol. 1, viii. In general terms, the task of After Virtue is to account both for the dysfunction of modern moral discourse in modern society and to rehabilitate the alternative of teleological rationality in Aristotelian virtue ethics. MacIntyre's philippic articulates a politics of self-defence for local communities who aspire to protect their traditional way of life from the corrosive capitalist free market. =Whose Justice? Which Rationality? (1988)= MacIntyre's second major work of his mature period takes up the problem of giving an account of philosophical rationality within the context of his notion of \\"traditions,\\" which had still remained under-theorized in After Virtue. Specifically, MacIntyre argues that rival and largely incompatible conceptions of justice are the outcome of rival and largely incompatible forms of practical rationality. These competing forms of practical rationality and their attendant ideas of justice are in turn the result of \\"socially embodied traditions of rational inquiry.\\"\\"Pr√©cis of Whose Justice? Which Rationality?\\" in MacIntyre Reader, ed. Kelvin Knight (Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame Press, 1998) 107. Although MacIntyre's treatment of traditions is quite complex he does give a relatively concise definition: \\"A tradition is an argument extended through time in which certain fundamental agreements are defined and redefined\\" in terms of both internal and external debates.Whose Justice? Which Rationality? (Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame Press, 1988) 12. Much of Whose Justice? Which Rationality? is therefore engaged in the task of not only giving the reader examples of what MacIntyre considers actual rival traditions and the different ways they can split apart, integrate, or defeat one another (e.g. Aristotelian, Augustinian, Thomist, Humean) but also with substantiating how practical rationality and a conception of justice help constitute those traditions. Specifically, according to him, the differing accounts of justice that are presented by Aristotle and Hume are due to the underlying differences in their conceptual schemes. MacIntyre argues that despite their incommensurability there are various ways in which alien traditions might engage one another rationally ‚Äì most especially via a form of immanent critique which makes use of empathetic imagination to then put the rival tradition into \\"epistemic crisis\\" but also by being able to solve shared or analogous problems and dilemmas from within one's own tradition which remain insoluble from the rival approach.Whose Justice? Which Rationality?, 361‚Äì362. MacIntyre's account also defends three further theses: first, that all rational human inquiry is conducted whether knowingly or not from within a tradition; second, that the incommensurable conceptual schemes of rival traditions do not entail either relativism or perspectivism; third, that although the arguments of the book are themselves attempts at universally valid insights they are nevertheless given from within a particular tradition (that of Thomist Aristotelianism) and that this need not imply any philosophical inconsistency. =Three Rival Versions of Moral Inquiry (1990)= Three Rival Versions of Moral Inquiry was first presented by MacIntyre as part of the Gifford lecture series at the University of Edinburgh in 1988 and is considered by many the third part in a trilogy of philosophical argumentation that commenced with After Virtue. As its title implies, MacIntyre's aim in this book is to examine three major rival traditions of moral inquiry on the intellectual scene today (encyclopaedic, genealogical and traditional) which each in turn was given defence from a canonical piece published in the late nineteenth century (the Ninth Edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Friedrich Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morals and Pope Leo XIII's Aeterni Patris, respectively). MacIntyre's book ultimately conducts a complex series of both interior and exterior critiques of the encyclopaedic and genealogical positions in an attempt to vindicate philosophical Thomism as the most persuasive form of moral inquiry currently on offer. His critique in chapter IX of Nietzsche's and Michel Foucault's genealogical mode as implicitly committed to an emancipatory and continuous notion of self which they cannot account for on their own terms has been of particular influence. The tradition-bound account of rational inquiry MacIntyre articulated and deployed throughout these lectures suggests reforms, explored by MacIntyre in chapter X, both for the lecture as a genre and for the university as an institution. To advance rational inquiry, MacIntyre argues that lectures ought to take account of the tradition-constituted roles both of lecturer and of student. Lecturers as members of explicitly articulated traditions should engage students, recognized as standing in various relationships to the lecturer's own and/or rival traditions, on material situated in the historically-contextualized progress of the lecturer's home tradition. In support of such lectures and of tradition-bound inquiry on the research front, universities should become forums for growing and engaging rival traditions. For students, such forums would invite intentional formation within a tradition, and support learning how to profitably confront rival traditions through imaginative participation in them. For researchers, inquiry at the frontier must advance toward holistic, inter-disciplinary accounts, at once both theoretical and practical, undertaken together by members of communities of practitioners bound together in traditions. Such tradition-bound inquiry contributes to the advancement of researchers' host traditions on their own terms. Moreover, undertaking such inquiry in a reformed university setting would support encounter among host traditions and their rivals, and thus visibility as traditions both to themselves and to others through imaginative engagement with rival perspectives. The public hosting of such engagements at suitably-reformed universities, including opportunities for agreement from complementary perspectives and for sharpening differences, would support both adjudication among the mutual claims to rational superiority among rival traditions, and initiation of students into the skill sets required to profitably join and assess such encounters. =Dependent Rational Animals (1999)= While After Virtue attempted to give an account of the virtues exclusively by recourse to social practices and the understanding of individual selves in light of \\"quests\\" and \\"traditions,\\" Dependent Rational Animals was a self-conscious effort by MacIntyre to ground virtues in an account of biology. MacIntyre writes the following of this shift in the preface to the book: \\"Although there is indeed good reason to repudiate important elements in Aristotle's biology, I now judge that I was in error in supposing an ethics independent of biology to be possible.\\"Dependent Rational Animals (Chicago: Carus Publishing, 1999) x More specifically, Dependent Rational Animals tries to make a holistic case on the basis of our best current knowledge (as opposed to an ahistorical, foundational claim) that \\"human vulnerability and disability\\" are the \\"central features of human life\\" and that Thomistic \\"virtues of dependency\\" are needed for individual human beings to flourish in their passage from stages of infancy to adulthood and old age. As MacIntyre puts it: > It is most often to others that we owe our survival, let alone our > flourishing ... It will be a central thesis of this book that the virtues > that we need, if we are to develop from our animal condition into that of > independent rational agents, and the virtues that we need, if we are to > confront and respond to vulnerability and disability both in ourselves and > in others, belong to one and the same set of virtues, the distinctive > virtues of dependent rational animalsDependent Rational Animals, 1, 5 Engaging with scientific texts on human biology as well as works of philosophical anthropology, MacIntyre identifies the human species as existing on a continuous scale of both intelligence and dependency with other animals such as dolphins. One of his main goals is to undermine what he sees as the fiction of the disembodied, independent reasoner who determines ethical and moral questions autonomously and what he calls the \\"illusion of self- sufficiency\\" that runs through much of Western ethics culminating in Nietzsche's √úbermensch.Dependent Rational Animals, 127 In its place he tries to show that our embodied dependencies are a definitive characteristic of our species and reveal the need for certain kinds of virtuous dispositions if we are ever to flourish into independent reasoners capable of weighing the intellectual intricacies of moral philosophy in the first place. Virtue ethics MacIntyre is a key figure in the recent surge of interest in virtue ethics, which identifies the central question of morality as having to do with the habits and knowledge concerning how to live a good life. His approach seeks to demonstrate that good judgment emanates from good character. Being a good person is not about seeking to follow formal rules. In elaborating this approach, MacIntyre understands himself to be reworking the Aristotelian idea of an ethical teleology. MacIntyre emphasises the importance of moral goods defined in respect to a community engaged in a 'practice'‚Äîwhich he calls 'internal goods' or 'goods of excellence'‚Äîrather than focusing on practice- independent obligation of a moral agent (deontological ethics) or the consequences of a particular act (utilitarianism). Before its recent resurgence, virtue ethics in European/American academia had been primarily associated with pre-modern philosophers (e.g. Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas). MacIntyre has argued that Aquinas' synthesis of Augustinianism with Aristotelianism is more insightful than modern moral theories by focusing upon the telos ('end', or completion) of a social practice and of a human life, within the context of which the morality of acts may be evaluated. His seminal work in the area of virtue ethics can be found in his 1981 book, After Virtue. MacIntyre intends the idea of virtue to supplement, rather than replace, moral rules. Indeed, he describes certain moral rules as 'exceptionless' or unconditional. MacIntyre considers his work to be outside \\"virtue ethics\\" due to his affirmation of virtues as embedded in specific, historically grounded, social practices.MacIntyre, ‚ÄúOn having survived the academic moral philosophy of the twentieth century‚Äù, lecture of March 2009 Politics Politically, MacIntyre's ethics informs a defence of the Aristotelian 'goods of excellence' internal to practices against the modern pursuit of 'external goods', such as money, power, and status, that are characteristic of rule-based, utilitarian, Weberian modern institutions. He has been described as a 'revolutionary Aristotelian' because of his attempt to combine historical insights from his Marxist past with those of Thomas Aquinas and Aristotle after MacIntyre's conversion to Catholicism. For him, liberalism and postmodern consumerism not only justify capitalism but also sustain and inform it over the long term. At the same time, he says that \\"Marxists have always fallen back into relatively straightforward versions of Kantianism or utilitarianism\\" and criticises Marxism as just another form of radical individualism. He says about Marxists that \\"as they move towards power they always tend to become Weberians.\\" Informed by that critique, Aristotelianism loses its sense of elitist complacency; moral excellence ceases to be part of a particular, historical practice in ancient Greece and becomes a universal quality of those who understand that good judgment emanates from good character. It has been argued that MacIntyre's thought is unable to provide a coherent and effective model for a justifiable and politically stable political order because of its neglect of political theology. In 1951 in student debates at Manchester MacIntyre described himself as a Disraeli Tory but later was a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain (leaving in 1956), briefly of the Socialist Labour League, and later of the Socialist Review Group/International Socialists.. Religion MacIntyre converted to Roman Catholicism in the early 1980s, and now does his work against the background of what he calls an \\"Augustinian Thomist approach to moral philosophy.\\" In an interview with Prospect, MacIntyre explains that his conversion to Catholicism occurred in his fifties as a \\"result of being convinced of Thomism while attempting to disabuse his students of its authenticity.\\". Also, in his book Whose Justice, Which Rationality? there is a section towards the end that is perhaps autobiographical when he explains how one is chosen by a tradition and may reflect his own conversion to Roman Catholicism.Whose Justice, Which Rationality? 1988, pp. 393‚Äì95. Parallel recent developments in the methods of philosophical research, which carry resonances with MacIntyre's take on Thomism, are witnessed with a modern approach to Avicennism (the historical legacies that were built upon the philosophy of Avicenna or Ibn Sina) as embodied in the works of Nader El-Bizri in connection with Islam, even though the orientation is phenomenological instead of being analytic, and the focus is on ontology rather than moral philosophy. Fuller accounts of MacIntyre's view of the relationship between philosophy and religion in general and Thomism and Catholicism in particular can be found in his essays \\"Philosophy recalled to its tasks\\" and \\"Truth as a good\\" (both found in the collection The Tasks of Philosophy) as well as in the survey of the Catholic philosophical tradition he gives in God, Philosophy and Universities.The Tasks of Philosophy: Selected Essays, Vol. 1 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006); God, Philosophy and Universities (Plymouth, UK: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, 2009) Bibliography *1953.

Early life Gaunson was born in Sydney, New South Wales, the fourth son of Francis Gaunson and his wife Elizabeth. David Gaunson was educated in Sydney, and at Brighton, Victoria. Having served his articles to his brother-in-law, Hon. J. M. Grant, he was admitted an attorney of Victoria in 1869 and practised in Melbourne. Political career After fighting two unsuccessful contests in 1871, and in 1872 unsuccessfully opposing the Hon. J. G. Francis, the then premier, at Richmond, Gaunson was returned to the Victorian Legislative Assembly in 1875 for Ararat, which constituency he continued to represent until July 1881. Gaunson was a prominent member of the \\"Stonewall\\" party led by Graham Berry, which, after unparalleled agitation in Parliament and in the country, ultimately annihilated the followers of Sir James McCulloch at the general election in 1877. Subsequently, however, Gaunson acted in opposition to Berry, and also opposed the Service Government formed in 1880. In the following year, on the formation of the O'Loghlen Ministry, Gaunson accepted a portfolio as President of the Board of Lands and Works and Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey. However, on presenting himself for re-election after his acceptance of office, he was defeated in Ararat by the Hon. William Wilson, and had to resign his position in the Ministry, which he had only held from 9 July to 2 August. He was elected to the seat of Emerald Hill in October 1883. He was returned to the Assembly at the general election in March 1886, but on his contesting Melbourne South at the next general election in March 1889, he was defeated by William Mountain. In June 1904, Gaunson was elected to represent Public Officers in the Assembly, serving until December 1906. He also unsuccessfully contested Assembly elections for Emerald Hill in 1892, Carlton in 1900 and East Melbourne in 1907. Ned Kelly case Gaunson claimed to have found a loophole in the prosecution case whereby Kelly was not guilty of murder as the police unit attacking him was out to kill him and thus Kelly fired in self-defence. This argument was not carried by the defence lawyer in the actual trial and Kelly went to hang. Involvement with John Wren At the dawn of the 20th century, Gaunson became involved with John Wren, a businessman who ran an illegal tote in the working class suburb of Collingwood, Melbourne. The police eventually caught up with Wren who went to Gaunson for help. What happened is not clear, but Gaunson managed to get the police off Wren's back. Gaunson advised Wren on the best ways to cover-up his illegal betting activities. His alleged role in the Wren machine is referred to in the Frank Hardy novel, Power Without Glory, in which the character \\"Garside\\" is clearly based on Gaunson. Gaunson remained a controversial political and legal figure throughout his life. His contemporary, Alfred Deakin, described him as \\"endowed with a musical voice, good presence, fine flow of language, great quickness of mind, readiness of retort and a good deal of industry, ability and humour, ... only disqualified from marked successes by his utter instability, egregious egotism, want of consistency and violence of temper\\".

Some recipes call for sweetened condensed milk. Macaroons are sometimes baked on edible rice paper placed on a baking tray.  Etymology  The name \\"macaroon\\" comes from the Italian maccarone or maccherone meaning \\"paste\\", referring to the original almond paste ingredient; this word itself derives from ammaccare, meaning \\"to crush\\". Origins Culinary historians write that macaroons can be traced to an Italian monastery of the 8th or 9th century. The monks came to France in 1533, joined by the pastry chefs of Catherine de' Medici, wife of King Henry II. Later, two Benedictine nuns, Sister Marguerite and Sister Marie-Elisabeth, came to Nancy seeking asylum during the French Revolution. The two women paid for their housing by baking and selling macaroon cookies, and thus became known as the \\"Macaroon Sisters\\". Italian Jews later adopted the cookie because it has no flour or leavening (macaroons are leavened by egg whites) and can be eaten during the eight-day observation of Passover. It was introduced to other European Jews and became popular as a year-round sweet. Recipes for macaroons appear in recipe books at least as early as 1725 (Robert Smith's Court Cookery, or the Complete English Cook), and use egg whites and almond paste. Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management includes a typical traditional recipe. Over time, coconut was added to the ground almonds and, in certain recipes, replaced them. Potato starch is also sometimes included in the recipe, to give the macaroons more body. Regional varieties =Dominican Republic= Macaroons in the Dominican Republic are very dark. Grated coconut is mixed with ginger and cinnamon. =France= There are many regional variations of French macaroon.The coconut macaroon is known as the \\"Congolais\\", or \\"le rocher √† la noix de coco\\". =India= Thoothukudi in Tamil Nadu and Mangaluru in Karnataka have their own varieties of macaroon made with cashews and egg whites, adapted from those introduced in colonial times. =Ireland= A macaroon chocolate bar is made by Wilton Candy in Co. Kildare, Ireland. The description on the packaging is \\"macaroon pieces in Irish milk chocolate.\\" It was first made in 1937. Cleeve's Irish Confectionery also make a macaroon chocolate bar - ingredients include cocoa butter, milk powder and desiccated coconut. =Italy= Ricciarelli are a soft almond variety originating from Siena. Amaretti di Saronno are a usually crunchy variety from Saronno. Both are often served on special occasions such as Christmas. =Philippines= Philippine coconut macaroons Philippine coconut macaroons are uniquely cake-like in texture. They are slightly crunchy on the outside and soft, moist, and chewy on the inside. They are usually baked into colorful tiny cupcake wrappers and topped with a raisin. They are popular during holidays and special occasions. =Puerto Rico= In Puerto Rico, coconut macaroons are called besitos de coco (little coconut kisses). A few variations of besitos de coco can be found on the island, the most popular ones including lemon zest and vanilla as additional ingredients. =Scotland= Macaroon chocolate bars are also popular in Scotland. Buchanan's make a macaroon with Belgian chocolate and toasted coconut. They are a long-established family business based in Greenock. Scottish Macaroon is made with a paste of potato and sugar. Buchanan's Macaroon Bar =Spain= The carajito is a macaroon variant made with hazelnuts and honey from the town of Salas, Asturias in northern Spain. A larger size version is commonly known as sultana or suspiros del moro. =Turkey= Acƒ±badem kurabiyesi is a traditional Turkish variety made of almonds, sugar and egg whites. The traditional recipes include a small amount of bitter almonds, which gives this cookie its name. Because bitter almonds are not readily available, almond extract is typically used as a substitute. These cookies are part of the stock-in trade of almost every bakery in Turkey, as they are seldom made at home. =United Kingdom= In Britain generally, the traditional almond macaroon often includes almond essence to strengthen the flavour, and is topped with an almond flake. Coconut macaroons are also popular. In Scotland, the Scottish macaroon has a dense, sugary centre and is covered in chocolate and roasted coconut. Traditionally they were made with cold leftovers of mashed potatoes and sugar loaf. When the macaroon bar became commercial the recipe no longer used mashed potato because of shelf life limitations. The modern macaroon is made from a combination (depending on producer) of sugar, glucose, water and egg white. These ingredients make a fondant centre. This recipe was reportedly discovered by accident in Coatbridge in 1931, when confectioner John Justice Lees was said to have botched the formula for making a chocolate fondant bar and threw coconut over it in disgust, producing the first macaroon bar. =United States= Coconut macaroons Coconut macaroon is the best known variety in America. Commercially made coconut macaroons are generally dense, moist and sweet, and often dipped in chocolate. Homemade macaroons and varieties produced by smaller bakeries are commonly light and fluffy. Macaroons made with coconuts are often piped out with a star shaped tip, whereas macaroons made with nuts are more likely shaped individually due to the stiffness of the dough. Because of their lack of wheat and leavening ingredients, macaroons are often consumed during Passover in many Jewish homes.

It was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1970. Macroscope was first published in 1969 and in some respects reflects the idealistic values of that time. The plot involves, among other things, an extension of the Peckham Experiment, mathematicians John Conway and Michael Paterson's game of sprouts, astrology, the poetry of Sidney Lanier, the history of Phoenicia, and commentary on the value of a dedicated teacher of a subject contrasted with a practicing engineer of that subject attempting to teach it, all in a kaleidoscopic combination. The book fills a unique place in Anthony's work as one that has garnered good reviews from hard-core science fiction fans as well as his usual audience of fantasy fans.  Plot  The central plot device is the \\"macroscope\\", a large crystal that can be used to focus a newly discovered type of particle, the \\"macron\\". Macrons are not subject to many of the effects that interfere with light, and as a result the macroscope can focus on any location in space-time with exceptional clarity, producing what is essentially a telescope of infinite resolution in the space- time continuum. The macroscope has been built into a solar-orbiting space station where scientists visit to book time on the device. Using it, they are able to explore space like never before. Among their many discoveries are numerous planets and two intelligent alien races. Using the macroscope, observers were able to look into one race's historical records, finding numerous parallels with human life on Earth. The race is now in societal decline, and the implications are worrying. The macroscope's clear view across space also makes it an ideal communications system for intelligent races, who broadcast signals by generating macrons, a technique not yet understood on Earth. However, over-riding all of these signals is another of enormous power, one of such strength that it must have been constructed by a Type II civilization. This signal repeats itself, starting with instructions on basic math and progressing to ever-more complex information. Viewers with high enough intelligence, an IQ of 150, reach a point where the information causes them to go insane or die. Those without the intelligence to understand the advanced portions of the signal are unaffected. The signal appears to be a deliberate attempt to \\"jam\\" macroscopic communications, blocking those with the ability to understand the other signals from being able to see them. They refer to the blocking signal simply as the \\"destroyer\\". The protagonist of the story, Ivo Archer, is taken to the macroscope station on the invitation of a childhood friend, Brad Carpenter. Ivo has an unexplained link to a mysterious hyper-intelligent character, Sch√∂n, and Brad believes Sch√∂n may be able to break through the destroyer signal. Ivo is not so convinced, and is reluctant to ask for Sch√∂n's help. This reluctance is cause for some misunderstanding with Brad's girlfriend, Afra Summerfield, with whom Ivo falls hopelessly in love. While inadvertently viewing the destroyer signal with Brad and a Senator visiting the project, only Ivo survives the experience. Afra concludes Ivo is not intelligent enough to be affected, and finds him somewhat beneath her as a result. The Senator's death sparks a series of events that lead to Ivo, Afra and two other station members, Harold and Beatryx, stealing the macroscope. Afra, still in love with Brad and hoping to find a cure, brings his body along, now in a vegetative state. They detach the macroscope from the station and fly off with it while United Nations ships give chase. With time on their hands, Ivo turns to the macroscope and finds a way to avoid being overwhelmed by the destroyer signal. This reveals a number of broadcasts from farther out in space. Ivo demonstrates this technique to the others, allowing Harold and Afra to view the signals formerly being hidden. Harold, a talented engineer, uses the information from one of the signals to build a device reducing their bodies to a liquid state, allowing them to accelerate at 10 g and escape the pursuing ships. They travel to Neptune space, following a cryptic message left by Sch√∂n. Here they set up camp on Triton. Afra attempts to cure Brad by shocking him while he is being reconstituted from the liquid state, but the attempt fails and Brad is killed. Over time, and with further help from Ivo, the group watches a benign form of the entire broadcast, which they come to call \\"traveller\\". The liquefaction technique is only the first of many shown in the traveller signal, which describes an entire suite of technologies that allow interstellar travel. Using the instructions in the signal, they convert Neptune into an interstellar spaceship. Sch√∂n briefly makes his first appearance during construction, revealing himself to be an alternate personality within Ivo's brain. Sch√∂n is ostensibly the body's \\"owner\\", having created the Ivo personality to avoid being the subject of experimentation. Sch√∂n has frightening intelligence, but having given over his body to Ivo at the age of five, is still a child and largely without morals. In an attempt to take control of the body, Sch√∂n traps Ivo in a historical drama running in his own brain. Over time, Ivo sees parallels between the characters in the drama and the group in the ship, and eventually escapes the illusion and re-asserts control. The group decides to hunt down the source of the destroyer signal in an effort to turn it off. Travelling 15,000 light years from Earth, they find it is being broadcast from an abandoned space station. Exploring the inner portions of the station, which is a large museum, they are individually drawn into a series of visions that reveal different aspects of the nature of the destroyer and its history. The traveller signal had arrived relatively late in the history of the galaxy, in the midst of flourishing communications via macroscope. Armed with the ability for interstellar travel, wars broke out that destroyed countless civilizations. The destroyer station, one of six in the galaxy, was set up to prevent this until the races reached the required level of cultural sophistication, if they ever did. Emerging from one of these visions, Afra discovers that Sch√∂n has once again taken over from Ivo. Intelligent enough that the signal would kill him, he has solved this problem via surgery that altered his brain chemistry to block most of the signal. This took six months to complete, keeping him \\"pinned\\" during the interval. Sch√∂n plays a game with Afra, now the only other surviving member of the original group, with the stakes being that the winner gets to select who, Sch√∂n or Ivo, gets the body. During the game, the real reason for Ivo's creation comes forth; the original Ivo was a girl with intelligence similar to Sch√∂n's, a situation neither could tolerate. After murdering her during a game played to the death with rules only the two of them could comprehend, Sch√∂n created the new Ivo to escape the retribution of his peers. Playing the game by the rules and losing, Afra instead tricks Sch√∂n into the room broadcasting the destroyer signal. Here it is so powerful that it overwhelms Sch√∂n's surgical blocks, and Ivo is able to take control. Now in command of his own personality, along with all of Sch√∂n's intellectual capacity, Ivo wins Afra's heart. At the end of the story the reader is left to decide whether or not the people of Earth are mature enough and ready for interstellar travel. Themes Macroscope's story is interwoven by many themes taken from a variety of sources. Among these are references to the personality traits each of the four members of the group embody. Harold is a student of astrology, and through his character each of the group member's signs are revealed; Ivo is a fire sign, Afra earth, Harold air, and Beatryx water. At several points, Anthony mentions that only the four together, acting as a unit, can solve the problems presented to them. These traits are explored throughout the book, but especially during the closing sequences, where they form the basis of the game between Afra and Sch√∂n.Brigg Anthony also explores the concepts of logic and understanding, especially through Afra. Her attempt to revive Brad had no hope of succeeding, something she was aware of, but ignored. During a mock trial following Brad's death, Harold explores the differences between emotion and logic, demonstrating that Afra's deliberate clamping down of her emotions led her to subvert logic. This is again explored later in the book, as Sch√∂n battles her. Anthony also uses Ivo as a stand-in for Sidney Lanier, a poet. Portions of Lanier's poetry are used throughout the book, and in other cases passages of the book closely reflect themes in Lanier's work. Through flashbacks throughout the book, Lanier's life is explored. Next to last, Brad and Ivo/Sch√∂n both come from a special project in Philadelphia clearly modelled in some ways on Britain's Peckham Experiment, initiated during the Great Depression. That project showed the great benefits of most improvements of overall health care in a community context, not just for the clinical health of the participants, but the effectiveness of the Peckham social milieu on reducing social problems, in particular, poverty. Finally, the overarching theme of the book explores mankind's potential for self-destruction, seen both through the example of the \\"prob\\" race as well as an exploration of humanity. Early in the book Brad complains that the population of 5 billion is unsustainable unless mankind reaches the stars, but he doubts their ability and maturity to do so. This theme is covered throughout the work, including the closing sentence.

It was first released in 2001. It was followed by a sequel in 2012, Payback 2. Gameplay The game is similar in gameplay to the original GTA, with new camera angles and more weapons being obvious differences. The player can use shotguns grenades, as well as weapons such as remote controlled cars carrying explosives. The game also supports four-player multiplayer deathmatch. The Game Boy Advance version includes eleven cities.  Development  It was originally a fan's project to make an Amiga clone of Grand Theft Auto. In the author's own words, \\"every effort has been made to ensure that Payback beats GTA in every way.\\" The game was eventually expanded into a commercial release, and in 2002 Apex Designs announced plans to bring it to Microsoft Windows, Macintosh, and the Game Boy Advance (GBA). The Mac version was speedily released, but there is still no word on the Windows version's released date. A version for the GP2X handheld has since been released. Despite the game being a clone of GTA, even copying car names such as the \\"Mundaneo\\", Rockstar has made no attempt to stop Apex Designs from publishing this game, or warn them about infringing on their copyrighted materials. The GBA version was also finished, but Apex Designs couldn't initially find a publisher. After numerous failed attempts to get it published, it was not until late 2004 that DSI Games finally picked up the game. An iOS version of Payback was announced on December 29, 2008 and released on January 28, 2009. It contains all the features of the GP2X version. The developers announced that it was going to be released on January 15; however due to a bug, it was pushed back to January 28. A behind-the-scenes report is listed on their website. A sequel to Payback, Payback 2 for iOS and Android devices, was released on 4th October 2012 Additional content The Amiga version allowed fans to make their own deathmatch maps (see the link below).

Established in 1884, it is based in Commercial Street, Spitalfields, and was the first university-affiliated institution of the worldwide Settlement movement‚Äîa reformist social agenda that strove to get the rich and poor to live more closely together in an interdependent community. It was founded by Henrietta and Samuel Barnett in the economically depressed East End, and was named in memory of their friend and fellow reformer, Oxford historian Arnold Toynbee, who had died the previous year. Toynbee Hall continues to strive to bridge the gap between people of all social and financial backgrounds, with a focus on working towards a future without poverty. History Shortly after their marriage in 1873, Samuel Barnett and his wife, Henrietta, moved to the Whitechapel district of the East End of London.https://socialwelfare.library.vcu.edu/settlement-houses/toynbee-hall/ Barnett worked as a vicar at St Jude's church, where he saw poverty at first hand. Late-Victorian Whitechapel was known for its overcrowded living spaces and high criminal activity. In the area of Whitechapel alone, the mortality rate for children under the age of five was around 60% mostly due to the tight living conditions. Charles Booth, another social reformer, mapped London according to eight different social classes, finding that around 70% of people living in the East End were in the lowest three classes. Map of Whitechapel from Charles Booth's Labour and Life of the People (1889). Residential buildings are coloured to represent the economic class of the occupants: Yellow (‚ÄúUpper-middle and Upper classes, Wealthy‚Äù), red (\\"Lower middle class ‚Äì Well-to-do middle class\\"), pink (\\"Fairly comfortable good ordinary earnings\\"), blue (\\"Intermittent or casual earnings\\"), and black (\\"lowest class...occasional labourers, street sellers, loafers, criminals and semi- criminals\\"). Toynbee Hall (not named) stands towards the southern end of Commercial Street. Whitechapel was also a place where many different immigrants settled. The Great Famine of Ireland in the 19th century led to many Irish settling in Whitechapel. Also, many Jewish immigrants settled in Whitechapel after fleeing from persecution in Western Europe at the time. The Barnetts used their roles in the parish to improve the Whitechapel area. They built a church library, introduced art exhibits, brought university lecturers in, and took their parishioners on excursions to the homes of the wealthy and to universities.The Barnetts also tried to encourage officials to improve sanitation and housing and to build more playgrounds and washhouses. However, the attempts the Barnetts made with the parish had little effect on the East End community as a whole. The parish did not reach everyone that lived in the East End. Many of the people did not involve themselves with the established church. In an effort to improve the wellbeing of the community, Barnett had the idea of sharing knowledge and culture. His proposal was to have university students come as volunteers to share their knowledge: the students would be able to help the poor, and at the same time witness poverty at first hand, and potentially develop solutions for it. In 1883, Barnett gave a lecture at St John's College, Oxford to gain support for his idea. Barnett was able to gather enough support and a committee called the \\"University Settlement of East London\\" was set up by Oxford. With these ideas and the support of universities, Barnett founded Toynbee Hall, the first settlement house in the world. Named after another social reformer, Arnold Toynbee, Toynbee Hall first opened its doors on Christmas Eve in 1884. Samuel Barnett was named as the first warden of the hall and Oxford and Cambridge university students came to work at the hall. By 1910 more settlement houses were founded in England in the areas of Manchester, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee, Birmingham, Liverpool, and elsewhere in London; as well as in Holland, France, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Austria, and the United States. In 1911 the leaders of the social settlement movement founded the National Federation of Settlements. One of the best known settlement houses that was inspired after a visit to Toynbee Hall is Hull House in Chicago, founded by Jane Addams and Ellen Gates Starr in 1889. Over time Toynbee Hall implemented many different educational community programmes. At its opening, Toynbee Hall introduced University Extension Society lectures. These lectures were taught by university professors. At the programme's peak, in the 1890s, classes were taught in over 134 topics including; literature, zoology, ethics, philosophy, etc. In order to further promote education, 36 societies or clubs were created in different areas, such as, music, art, history, and science. One of these societies was founded in 1889 and was called the \\"Toynbee Travellers\\". This group was created after a group of Toynbee Hall residents travelled to Belgium in 1887. Toynbee Hall also began hosting Smoking Room Debates in which community members and invited speakers would come to debate issues of the day. This tradition continued for over twenty years. In 1899, the Poor Man's Lawyer service was introduced. This programme gives free legal services to those who can not afford it, and continues to the present day. The Settlement movement Dorset Street, Spitalfields), photographed for Jack London's book The People of the Abyss The international Settlement movement began at Toynbee Hall, where a community centre was formed that attracted university students who wished to live or \\"settle\\" among the underprivileged in London's economically depressed East End. They came, according to Samuel Barnett, \\"to learn, as much as to teach, to receive as much as to give\\". As at most Settlement houses, its social workers‚Äîstudents from Oxford and Cambridge Universities, among others‚Äîresided at Toynbee Hall and sought thereby to get to know their neighbors and their needs on a more intimate, personal level.Article in the 'University Review' 919050, quoted in H. O. Barnett, op. cit., p.311 Toynbee Hall rejected the concept of a community centre as a location for Christian proselytisingas seen in the efforts of the Salvation Army. This principle is reflected in the decision to name it after the social reformer, Arnold Toynbee, who had died in 1883, aged 30. As Henrietta Barnett explained, the name would be \\"free from every possible savor of a mission.\\" From the beginning, it was non-sectarian and welcomed people of all faiths, despite having been founded by a Church of England cleric. It saw its purpose as more educational than charitable, in a missionary sense. Gertrude Himmelfarb lists some of the activities offered by Toynbee Hall in a typical month: \\"evening classes on arithmetic, writing, drawing, citizenship, chemistry, nursing, and music (...); afternoon classes for girls on dressmaking, writing and composition, geography, bookkeeping, needlework, hygiene, reading and recitation, French, singing, cooking, and swimming; and evening sessions devoted to the discussion of legal principles and current social issues\\". By 1900 there were over 100 settlements in the United States and across the UK,National Federation of Settlements accessed 10 July 2013 and in 1911 the leaders of the social settlement movement founded the National Federation of Settlements.Social Welfare History website. Current activity Today, Toynbee Hall provides a range of programmes and activities, broadly broken down into: youth, the elderly, financial inclusion, debt, advice, free legal advice and community engagement. Each year over 400 volunteers help to deliver the charity's services. In 2006 Toynbee Hall launched Capitalise, a pan-London free debt advice service to support 20,000 people a year with their money worries. In April 2019 this service was rebranded as Debt Free London. In 2007 the Toynbee Studios opened in part of the building offering dance and media studios and a theatre. Buildings Toynbee Hall, the original building that houses the organisation of the same name, is located in Commercial Street, Spitalfields, in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. It was designed by Elijah Hoole in a Tudor-Gothic style, and was formally opened in January 1885.Briggs and Macartney 1984, pp. 1, 22‚Äì23. It was built on the site of a disused industrial school, and adjacent to the church of St Jude (built in 1845‚Äì46, but demolished in 1927). It was designated a Grade II listed building in 1973. The front of the building bears a Greater London Council blue plaque, erected in 1984, commemorating Jimmy Mallon, warden 1919‚Äì54. Since its foundation, the charity has expanded from the original building into a number of extensions and other neighbouring buildings.

Bourdain was a 1978 graduate of The Culinary Institute of America and a veteran of a number of professional kitchens in his long career, which included many years spent as an executive chef at Brasserie Les Halles in Manhattan. He first became known for his bestselling book Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly (2000). His first food and world-travel television show A Cook's Tour ran for 35 episodes on the Food Network in 2002 and 2003. In 2005, he began hosting the Travel Channel's culinary and cultural adventure programs Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations (2005‚Äì2012) and The Layover (2011‚Äì2013). In 2013, he began a three-season run as a judge on The Taste, and concurrently switched his travelogue programming to CNN to host Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown. Though best known for his culinary writings and television presentations, along with several books on food and cooking and travel adventures, Bourdain also wrote both fiction and historical nonfiction. On June 8, 2018, Bourdain died by suicide while on location in France for Parts Unknown. Early life Anthony Michael Bourdain was born in New York City on June 25, 1956, the oldest of two sons of Gladys (n√©e Sacksman) and Pierre Bourdain.Mack, Patricia. \\"The Cook, The Thief...\\", The Record (Bergen County), October 25, 2000; accessed March 30, 2011. \\"Anthony Bourdain, the Leonia native with the French-sounding name, took a leave from his job as an executive chef at Brasserie Les Halles in New York City.\\" Although he was not raised in a specified religion, his father was Catholic, while his mother was Jewish. Bourdain stated that, though he was considered Jewish by Judaism's definition, \\"I've never been in a synagogue. I don't believe in a higher power. But that doesn't make me any less Jewish, I don't think.\\" His family was not religious either. At the time of Bourdain's birth, Pierre was a salesman at a New York City camera store, as well as a floor manager at a record store. He later became an executive for Columbia Records, and Gladys was a staff editor at The New York Times. Bourdain's paternal grandparents were French; his paternal grandfather emigrated from Arcachon to New York following World War I.A Cook's Tour, episode 1.9: \\"Childhood Flavors\\"; 2000Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations, episode 5.4: \\"Uruguay\\"; July 28, 2008 Bourdain's father spent summers in France as a boy and grew up speaking French. Bourdain spent most of his childhood in Leonia, New Jersey. In a 2014 interview, Bourdain talked about how in the 1960s, after seeing films, he would go to a restaurant afterwards with friends to discuss the film. In his youth, Bourdain was a member of the Boy Scouts of America. Culinary training and career Bourdain's love of food was kindled in his youth while on a family vacation in France when he tried his first oyster on a fisherman's boat. He graduated from the Dwight-Englewood School‚Äîan independent coeducational college-preparatory day school in Englewood, New Jersey‚Äîin 1973, then enrolled at Vassar College, but dropped out after two years. He worked in seafood restaurants in Provincetown, Massachusetts, while attending Vassar, which inspired his decision to pursue cooking as a career. Bourdain attended The Culinary Institute of America, graduating in 1978. From there he went on to run various restaurant kitchens in New York City, including the Supper Club, One Fifth Avenue, and Sullivan's. In 1988, Bourdain became an executive chef at Brasserie Les Halles. Based in Manhattan, at the time the brand had additional restaurants in Miami, Washington, D.C., and Tokyo. Bourdain remained an executive chef there for many years, and, even when no longer formally employed at Les Halles, maintained a relationship with the restaurant, which described him in January 2014 as their \\"chef at large.\\" Les Halles closed in 2017, after filing for bankruptcy. Media career =Writing= In the mid-1980s, Bourdain began submitting unsolicited work for publication to Between C & D, a literary magazine of the Lower East Side. The magazine eventually published a piece that Bourdain had written about a chef who was trying to purchase heroin in the Lower East Side. In 1985, Bourdain signed up for a writing workshop with Gordon Lish. In 1990, Bourdain received a small book advance from Random House, after meeting a Random House editor. His first book, a culinary mystery Bone in the Throat, was published in 1995. He paid for his own book tour, but he did not find success. His second mystery book, Gone Bamboo, also performed poorly in sales. Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly (2000), a New York Times bestseller, was an expansion of his 1999 New Yorker article \\"Don't Eat Before Reading This.\\" A prequel to the book, Medium Raw: A Bloody Valentine to the World of Food and the People Who Cook, was published in 2010. He wrote two more bestselling nonfiction books: A Cook's Tour (2001), an account of his food and travel exploits around the world, written in conjunction with his first television series of the same title, and The Nasty Bits (2006), another collection of essays centered on food. His additional books include Anthony Bourdain's Les Halles Cookbook, a hypothetical historical investigation Typhoid Mary: An Urban Historical, and No Reservations: Around the World on an Empty Stomach. His articles and essays appeared in many publications, including in The New Yorker, The New York Times, The Times of London, the Los Angeles Times, The Observer, Gourmet, Maxim, and Esquire (UK) magazines; Scotland on Sunday, The Face, Food Arts, Limb by Limb, BlackBook, The Independent, Best Life, the Financial Times, and Town & Country. His blog for the third season of Top Chef was nominated for a Webby Award for Best Blog (in the Cultural/Personal category) in 2008. In 2012, Bourdain co-wrote the original graphic novel Get Jiro! along with Joel Rose; its art was by Langdon Foss. In 2015, Bourdain joined the travel, food, and politics publication Roads & Kingdoms as the site's sole investor and editor-at-large. Over the next several years, Bourdain contributed to the site and edited the Dispatched By Bourdain series. Bourdain and Roads & Kingdoms also partnered on the digital series Explore Parts Unknown, which launched in 2017 and won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Short Form Nonfiction or Reality Series in 2018. =Television= As series host Bourdain's principal occupation between 2002 until his death in 2018 was a series of food and travel shows. Bourdain described the concept as, \\"I travel around the world, eat a lot of shit, and basically do whatever the fuck I want\\". Nigella Lawson noted that Bourdain had an, \\"incredibly beautiful style when he talks that ranges from erudite to brilliantly slangy\\". =A Cook's Tour (2002‚Äì2003)= The acclaim surrounding Bourdain's memoir Kitchen Confidential led to an offer by the Food Network for him to host his own food and world-travel show, A Cook's Tour, which premiered in January 2002. It ran for 35 episodes, through 2003. =No Reservations (2005‚Äì2012)= In July 2005, he premiered a new, somewhat similar television series, Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations, on the Travel Channel. As a further result of the immense popularity of Kitchen Confidential, the Fox sitcom Kitchen Confidential aired in 2005, in which the character Jack Bourdain is based loosely on Anthony Bourdain's biography and persona. In July 2006, he and his crew were in Beirut filming an episode of No Reservations when the Israel-Lebanon conflict broke out unexpectedly after the crew had filmed only a few hours of footage for the food and travel show. His producers compiled behind-the-scenes footage of him and his production staff, including not only their initial attempts to film the episode, but also their firsthand encounters with Hezbollah supporters, their days of waiting for news with other expatriates in a Beirut hotel, and their eventual escape aided by a fixer (unseen in the footage), whom Bourdain dubbed Mr. Wolf after Harvey Keitel's character in Pulp Fiction. Bourdain and his crew were finally evacuated with other American citizens, on the morning of July 20, by the United States Marine Corps. The Beirut No Reservations episode, which aired on August 21, 2006, was nominated for an Emmy Award in 2007. =The Layover (2011‚Äì2013)= The Travel Channel announced in July 2011 that it would be adding a second one-hour, 10-episode Bourdain show to be titled The Layover, which premiered November 21, 2011. Each episode featured an exploration of a city that can be undertaken within an air travel layover of 24 to 48 hours. The series ran for 20 episodes, through February 2013. Bourdain executive produced a similar show hosted by celebrities called The Getaway, which lasted two seasons on Esquire Network. =Parts Unknown (2013‚Äì2018)= Bourdain with his Peabody Award in 2014 In May 2012, Bourdain announced that he would be leaving the Travel Channel. In December he explained on his blog that his departure was due to his frustration with the channel's new ownership using his voice and image to make it seem as if he were endorsing a car brand, and the channel's creating three \\"special episodes\\" consisting solely of clips from the seven official episodes of that season. He went on to host Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown for CNN. The program focuses on other cuisines, cultures and politics and premiered April 14, 2013. President Barack Obama was featured on the program in an episode filmed in Vietnam that aired in September 2016. The two talked over a beer at a local Vietnamese restaurant. The show was filmed and is set in places as diverse as Libya, Tokyo, the Punjab region, Jamaica, Turkey, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Far West Texas and Armenia. Top Chef and other guest appearances =Food programs= Between 2012 and 2017, he served as narrator and executive producer for several episodes of the award-winning PBS series The Mind of a Chef. The series moved from PBS to Facebook Watch in 2017. From 2013 to 2015 he was an executive producer and appeared as a judge and mentor in ABC's cooking- competition show The Taste. He earned an Emmy nomination for each season. Bourdain appeared five times as guest judge on Bravo's Top Chef reality cooking competition program: first in the November 2006 \\"Thanksgiving\\" episode of Season 2, and again in June 2007 in the first episode of Season 3, judging the \\"exotic surf and turf\\" competition that featured ingredients including abalone, alligator, black chicken, geoduck and eel. His third appearance was also in Season 3, as an expert on air travel, judging the competitors' airplane meals. He also wrote weekly blog commentaries for many of the Season 3 episodes, filling in as a guest blogger while Top Chef judge Tom Colicchio was busy opening a new restaurant. He next appeared as a guest judge for the opening episode of Season 4, in which pairs of chefs competed head-to-head in the preparation of various classic dishes, and again in the Season 4 Restaurant Wars episode, temporarily taking the place of head judge Tom Colicchio, who was at a charity event. He appeared as a guest judge in episode 12 of Top Chef: D.C. (Season 7), where he judged the cheftestants' meals they made for NASA. He was also one of the main judges on Top Chef All-Stars (Top Chef, Season 8). He made a guest appearance on the August 6, 2007 New York City episode of Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern, and Zimmern himself appeared as a guest on the New York City episode of Bourdain's No Reservations airing the same day. On October 20, 2008 Bourdain hosted a special, At the Table with Anthony Bourdain, on the Travel Channel. =Other series= Bourdain appeared in an episode of TLC's reality show Miami Ink, aired on August 28, 2006, in which artist Chris Garver tattooed a skull on his right shoulder. Bourdain, who noted it was his fourth tattoo, said that one reason for the skull was that he wished to balance the ouroboros tattoo he had inked on his opposite shoulder in Malaysia, while filming Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations. He was a consultant and writer for the television series Treme. In 2010, he appeared on Nick Jr.'s Yo Gabba Gabba! as Dr. Tony. In 2011, he voiced himself in a cameo on an episode of The Simpsons titled \\"The Food Wife\\", in which Marge, Lisa, and Bart start a food blog called The Three Mouthkateers. He appeared in a 2013 episode of the animated series Archer (S04E07), voicing chef Lance Casteau, a parody of himself. In 2015, he voiced a fictionalized version of himself on an episode of Sanjay and Craig titled \\"Snake Parts Unknown\\". From 2015 to 2017, Bourdain hosted Raw Craft, a series of short videos released on YouTube. The series followed Bourdain as he visited various artisans who produce various craft items by hand, including iron skillets, suits, saxophones, and kitchen knives. The series was produced by William Grant & Sons to promote their Balvenie distillery's products. =Publishing= Ecco Press announced in September 2011 that Bourdain would have his own publishing line, Anthony Bourdain Books, which would include acquiring between three and five titles per year that \\"reflect his remarkably eclectic tastes\\". The first books that the imprint published, released in 2013, include L.A. Son: My Life, My City, My Food by Roy Choi, Tien Nguyen, and Natasha Phan, Prophets of Smoked Meat by Daniel Vaughn, and Pain Don't Hurt by Mark Miller. Bourdain also announced plans to publish a book by Marilyn Hagerty. In describing the line, he said, \\"This will be a line of books for people with strong voices who are good at something‚Äîwho speak with authority. Discern nothing from this initial list‚Äîother than a general affection for people who cook food and like food. The ability to kick people in the head is just as compelling to us‚Äîas long as that's coupled with an ability to vividly describe the experience. We are just as intent on crossing genres as we are enthusiastic about our first three authors. It only gets weirder from here.\\" Shortly after Bourdain's death, HarperCollins announced the publishing line would shut down after the remaining works under contract are published. =Film= Bourdain appeared as himself in the 2015 film The Big Short, in which he used seafood stew as an analogy for a collateralized debt obligation. He also produced and starred in Wasted! The Story of Food Waste. Public persona Bourdain in 2007 Drew Magary, in a column for GQ, reflected that Bourdain was heir in spirit to Hunter S. Thompson. The Smithsonian Institution declared Bourdain \\"the original rock star\\" of the culinary world, while his public persona was characterized by Gothamist as \\"culinary bad boy\\". Due to his liberal use of profanity and sexual references in his television show No Reservations, the network added viewer-discretion advisories to each episode. Bourdain was known for consuming exotic local specialty dishes, having eaten black-colored blood sausages called mustamakkara in FinlandAL: Julkkiskokki ahmaisi puoli kiloa mustaamakkaraa (in Finnish)IS: Anthony Bourdain rakastui Suomen vierailullaan mielipiteit√§ jakavaan perinneruokaan: ‚ÄùGood stuff!‚Äù (in Finnish) and also \\"sheep testicles in Morocco, ant eggs in Puebla, Mexico, a raw seal eyeball as part of a traditional Inuit seal hunt, and an entire cobra‚Äîbeating heart, blood, bile, and meat‚Äîin Vietnam\\". Bourdain was quoted as saying that a Chicken McNugget was the most disgusting thing he ever ate, despite his fondness for Popeyes chicken. He also declared that the unwashed warthog rectum he ate in NamibiaAnthony Bourdain: No Reservations, episode 3.4: \\"Namibia\\"; January 22, 2007 was \\"the worst meal of [his] life\\", along with the fermented shark he ate in Iceland.Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations, episode 1.2: \\"Iceland\\"; August 1, 2005 Bourdain was noted for his put-downs of celebrity chefs, such as Paula Deen, Bobby Flay, Guy Fieri, Sandra Lee, and Rachael Ray, and appeared irritated by both the overt commercialism of the celebrity cooking industry and its lack of culinary authenticity. He voiced a \\"serious disdain for food demigods like Alan Richman, Alice Waters, and Alain Ducasse.\\" Bourdain recognized the irony of his transformation into a celebrity chef and began to qualify his insults; in the 2007 New Orleans episode of No Reservations, he reconciled with Emeril Lagasse.Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations, episode 4.5: \\"New Orleans\\"; February 4, 2008 He was outspoken in his praise for chefs he admired, particularly Ferran Adri√†, Juan Mari Arzak, Fergus Henderson, Jos√© Andr√©s, Thomas Keller, Martin Picard, √âric Ripert, and Marco Pierre White, as well as his former proteg√© and colleagues at Brasserie Les Halles.Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations, episode 4.10: \\"Into the Fire\\"; March 10, 2008 He spoke very highly of Julia Child's influence on him. Bourdain was known for his sarcastic comments about vegan and vegetarian activists, considering their lifestyle \\"rude\\" to the inhabitants of many countries he visited. He considered vegetarianism, except in the case of religious exemptions, a \\"First World luxury\\". However, he also believed that Americans eat too much meat, and admired vegetarians and vegans who put aside their beliefs when visiting different cultures in order to be respectful of their hosts. Bourdain's book, The Nasty Bits, is dedicated to \\"Joey, Johnny, and Dee Dee\\" of the Ramones. He declared fond appreciation for their music, as well that of other early punk bands such as Dead Boys, and The Voidoids. He said that the playing of music by Billy Joel, Elton John, or the Grateful Dead in his kitchen was grounds for firing. Joel was a fan of Bourdain's, and visited the restaurant. On No Reservations and Parts Unknown, he dined with and interviewed many musicians, both in the U.S. and elsewhere, with a special focus on glam and punk rockers such as Alice Cooper, David Johansen, Marky Ramone and Iggy Pop. He featured contemporary band Queens of the Stone Age on No Reservations several times, and they composed and performed the theme song for Parts Unknown. Personal life Bourdain married his high school girlfriend, Nancy Putkoski, in 1985, and they remained together for two decades, divorcing in 2005. On April 20, 2007, he married Ottavia Busia, a mixed martial artist. The couple's daughter, Ariane, was born in 2007. Bourdain said having to be away from his family for 250 days a year working on his television shows was a strain. Busia appeared in several episodes of No Reservations, notably the ones in her birthplace of Sardinia, Tuscany, Rome, Rio de Janeiro and Naples. The couple separated in 2016. In 2017, Bourdain began a relationship with the Italian actress Asia Argento, who he met when she appeared on the Rome episode of Parts Unknown. Bourdain practiced the martial art Brazilian jiu-jitsu, earning a blue belt in August 2015. He won gold at the IBJJF New York Spring International Open Championship in 2016, in the Middleweight Master 5 (age 51 and older) division. Bourdain was known to be a heavy smoker. In a nod to Bourdain's two- pack-a-day cigarette habit, Thomas Keller once served him a 20-course tasting menu which included a mid-meal ‚Äúcoffee and cigarette,‚Äù a coffee custard infused with tobacco, with a foie gras mousse. Bourdain stopped smoking in 2007 for his daughter. A former user of cocaine, heroin, and LSD, Bourdain wrote in Kitchen Confidential of his experience in a trendy SoHo restaurant in 1981, where he and his friends were often high. Bourdain said drugs influenced his decisions, and that he sent a busboy to Alphabet City to obtain cannabis, methaqualone, cocaine, LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, secobarbital, tuinal, amphetamine, codeine and heroin. Death Hotel Chambard in Kaysersberg (pictured in 2015), where Bourdain was found dead In early June 2018, Bourdain was working on an episode of Parts Unknown in Strasbourg, with his frequent collaborator and friend √âric Ripert. On June 8, Ripert became worried when Bourdain had missed dinner and breakfast. He subsequently found Bourdain dead of an apparent suicide by hanging in his room at Le Chambard hotel in Kaysersberg near Colmar. Christian de Rocquigny du Fayel, the public prosecutor for Colmar, said Bourdain's body bore no signs of violence and the suicide appeared to be an impulsive act. Rocquigny du Fayel disclosed that Bourdain's toxicology results were negative for narcotics, showing only a trace of a therapeutic non-narcotic medication. Bourdain's body was cremated in France on June 13, 2018, and his ashes were returned to the United States two days later. =Reactions and tributes= Memorial at Brasserie Les HallesBourdain's mother, Gladys Bourdain, told The New York Times: \\"He is absolutely the last person in the world I would have ever dreamed would do something like this.\\" Following the news of Bourdain's death, various celebrity chefs and other public figures expressed sentiments of condolence. Among them were fellow chefs Andrew Zimmern and Gordon Ramsay, and former astronaut Scott Kelly. CNN issued a statement, saying that Bourdain's \\"talents never ceased to amaze us and we will miss him very much.\\" Former U.S. President Barack Obama, who dined with Bourdain in Vietnam on an episode of Parts Unknown, wrote on Twitter: \\"He taught us about food‚Äîbut more importantly, about its ability to bring us together. To make us a little less afraid of the unknown.\\" On June 8, 2018, CNN aired Remembering Anthony Bourdain, a tribute program. In the days following Bourdain's death, fans paid tribute to him outside his now-closed former place of employment, Brasserie Les Halles. Cooks and restaurant owners gathered together and held tribute dinners and memorials and donated net sales to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. In August 2018, CNN announced that it would broadcast a final, posthumous season of Parts Unknown, completing its remaining episodes using narration and additional interviews from featured guests, and two retrospective episodes paying tribute to the series and Bourdain's legacy. A collection of Bourdain's personal items were sold at auction in October 2019, raising $1.8 million, part of which is to support the Anthony Bourdain Legacy Scholarship at his alma mater, The Culinary Institute of America. The most expensive item sold was his custom Bob Kramer Steel and Meteorite Chef's knife, selling at a record $231,250. Interests and advocacy In an assessment of Bourdain's life for The Nation, David Klion wrote that, \\"Bourdain understood that the point of journalism is to tell the truth, to challenge the powerful, to expose wrongdoing. But his unique gift was to make doing all that look fun rather than grim or tedious.\\"What Bourdain Gave Us by David Klion, The Nation, June 8, 2018 According to Klion, Bourdain's shows \\"made it possible to believe that social justice and earthly delights weren't mutually exclusive, and he pursued both with the same earnest reverence.\\" Bourdain advocated for communicating the value of traditional or \\"peasant\\" foods, including all of the varietal bits and unused animal parts not usually eaten by affluent, 21st-century Americans.Bourdain, Anthony (2006). The Nasty Bits. New York: Bloomsbury. He also praised the quality of freshly prepared street food in other countries‚Äîespecially developing countries‚Äîcompared to fast-food chains in the U.S.Bourdain, Anthony (2001). A Cook's Tour: In Search of the Perfect Meal. New York: Bloomsbury. Regarding Western moral criticism of cuisine in developing countries, Bourdain stated: \\"Let's call this criticism what it is: racism. There are a lot of practices from the developing world that I find personally repellent, from my privileged Western point of view. But I don't feel like I have such a moral high ground that I can walk around lecturing people in developing nations on how they should live their lives.\\" With regard to criticism of the Chinese, Bourdain stated: \\"The way in which people dismiss whole centuries-old cultures‚Äìoften older than their own and usually non-white‚Äìwith just utter contempt aggravates me. People who suggest I shouldn't go to a country like China, look at or film it, because some people eat dog there, I find that racist, frankly. Understand people first: their economic, living situation.\\" Regarding the myth that monosodium glutamate in Chinese food is unhealthy, Bourdain said: \\"It's a lie. You know what causes Chinese restaurant syndrome? Racism. 'Ooh I have a headache; it must have been the Chinese guy.'\\" He championed industrious Spanish-speaking immigrants‚Äîfrom Mexico, Ecuador, and other Central and South American countries‚Äîwho are cooks and chefs in many U.S. restaurants, including upscale establishments, regardless of cuisine.Master chef Douglas Rodriguez, on the July 8, 2009 episode of Top Chef Masters, stated that 60% of restaurant kitchen workers in the U.S. are Latinos. He considered them talented chefs and invaluable cooks, underpaid and unrecognized even though they have become the backbone of the U.S. restaurant industry. In 2017, Bourdain became a vocal advocate against sexual harassment in the restaurant industry, speaking out about celebrity chefs Mario Batali and John Besh, and in Hollywood, particularly following his then girlfriend Asia Argento's sexual abuse allegations against Harvey Weinstein. Bourdain accused Hollywood director Quentin Tarantino of \\"complicity\\" in the Weinstein sex scandal.

The area, which takes its name from Paternoster Row, once centre of the London publishing trade, was devastated by aerial bombardment in The Blitz during the Second World War. It is now the location of the London Stock Exchange which relocated there from Threadneedle Street in 2004. It is also the location of investment banks such as Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Nomura Securities Co., and of fund manager Fidelity Investments. The square itself, i.e. the plaza, is privately owned public space. In 2004, Christopher Wren's 1669 Temple Bar Gate was re-erected here as an entrance way to the plaza. The Square is near the top of a modest rise known as Ludgate Hill, the highest part of the City of London. It is characterised by its pedestrianisation and colonnades. World War II bombing The City of London was hit by one of the heaviest night raids of The Blitz on the night of 29 December 1940. Buildings on Paternoster Row, housing the publishing companies Simpkins and Marshall, Hutchinsons, Blackwoods, and Longmans and Collins were destroyed. St Paul's Cathedral remained intact.  1960s rebuilding  In 1956, the Corporation of London published Sir William Holford's proposals for redeveloping the precinct north of St Paul's Cathedral. Holford's report attempted to resolve problems of traffic flow in the vicinity of the cathedral, while protecting the cathedral's presence as a national monument on the highest ground of the City, at the top of Ludgate Hill, on the north bank of the Thames.Pevsner, Nikolaus and Games, Stephen (ed), Pevsner: The Complete Broadcasts, \\"A Setting for St. Paul's\\", Ashgate 2014 The report was controversial, however, because it introduced a decisively modern note alongside the foremost work of Britain's foremost 17th-century architect, Sir Christopher Wren. Rebuilding was carried out between 1961‚Äì7, but it involved only part of Holford's concept ‚Äî the area of Paternoster Square between St Paul's churchyard and Newgate Street ‚Äî and this included undistinguished buildings by other architects and the omission of some of Holford's features. The new Paternoster Square soon became very unpopular, and (in the eyes of many) its grim presence immediately north of one of the capital's prime tourist attractions was seen as an embarrassment. Robert Finch, the Lord Mayor of London, wrote of it in The Guardian in 2004, that it was made up of \\"ghastly, monolithic constructions without definition or character\\".  1980s and 1990s  In the late 1980s, many existing tenants moved to other London sites leading to vacant premises. This prompted landlords and the City of London to welcome proposals to redevelop. In 1987, a body awarded a prize for a plan by Arup associates; this was not implemented as complicated, bold and postmodern. In 1990 a front-running scheme arose by John Simpson sponsored by a newspaper competition and championed by The Prince of Wales; this proposed classical features, which would have been sympathetic with the nearby cathedral. The City's architecturally more radical planners for large commercial buildings refused these plans, as pastiche, even though the scheme that was eventually realised also draws heavily from classical architecture, complete with Corinthian columns and classical mouldings. In 1996 planning permissions were granted for the masterplan by Sir William Whitfield ‚Äî then planned in detail and built. By October 2003 the redeveloped square was complete, lined with buildings by Whitfield's firm and others. Among the first new tenants was the London Stock Exchange. Occupy London and public space controversy The London Stock Exchange was the initial target for the protesters of Occupy London on 15 October 2011. Attempts to occupy Paternoster Square were thwarted by police, Police sealed off the entrance to Paternoster Square. A High Court injunction had been granted against public access to the square, defining it as private property. The square was repeatedly described as 'public space' in the plans for Paternoster Square, meaning the public is granted access but does not designate the square as a right of way under English law, thus the owner can limit access at any time. Monuments and sculpture St Paul's Cathedral dome and the Paternoster Square Column, from Paternoster Square The main monument in the redeveloped square is the 75 ft (23m) tall Paternoster Square Column.Paternoster Square Column It is a Corinthian column of Portland stone topped by a gold leaf covered flaming copper urn, which is illuminated by fibre-optic lighting at night. The column was designed by William Whitfield's firm Whitfield Partners, and also serves as a ventilation shaft for a service road that runs beneath the square. At the north end of the square is the bronze Paternoster (also known as Shepherd and Sheep) by Dame Elisabeth Frink. The statue was commissioned for the previous Paternoster Square complex in 1975, and was replaced on a new plinth following the redevelopment. Another sculpture in the square is Paternoster Vents by Thomas Heatherwick. Temple Bar Gate, a Wren- designed stone archway constructed between 1669 and 1672 on Fleet Street at Temple Bar (the historic western ceremonial entrance to the City), has been in front of the cathedral side entrance since 2004. Contractors were paid ¬£3,000,000 to restore it and move it from a site in Theobalds Park by the Corporation of London, which received donations from the Temple Bar Trust and more than one Livery Company.

He was a Liberal member of the Australian House of Representatives from October 1998 to August 2013, representing the Division of Hume in New South Wales. Biography =Early life= Schultz was born in Melbourne, Victoria, and was a meat processing worker before entering politics. He was a field officer for the Liberal Party (1986‚Äì88) and a member of the Cootamundra Shire Council (1983‚Äì91). =Career= Schultz was the member for Burrinjuck in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1988 to 1998, before being elected to represent Hume at the 1998 federal election. He was subsequently returned at the 2001, 2004, 2007 and 2010 elections. He gained national media attention in the lead up to the privatisation of Telstra claiming that he would not support the legislation but would not \\"cross the floor\\". In the end he abstained from voting on the matter. Alby Schultz was one of the several Liberal Party politicians along with Don Randall, Wilson Tuckey, Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, Dennis Jensen and Sophie Mirabella, who boycotted Parliament on the day that the formal apology to the Stolen Generations was made by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. Schultz apologised in June 2009 for a physical confrontation with one of his Liberal parliamentary colleagues in a party room meeting in Parliament House. He had been angered by a remark made by Chris Pearce, the member for Aston in Victoria, during a debate about whether the Liberal Party should run candidates against National Party MPs. Schultz reportedly responded by grabbing Pearce around the neck. He later apologised to Pearce and the entire party room for the incident. In September 2012 he prompted an investigation by the Department of Parliamentary Service on concern of a \\"serious security breach\\" when he became aware his private calendar became accessible on other MP's computers. The investigation determined that his own office was responsible for the error when configuring the email service, by nominating access to multiple users.

This can be done by comparing two files bit-by- bit, but requires two copies of the same file, and may miss systematic corruptions which might occur to both files. A more popular approach is to generate a hash of the copied file and comparing that to the hash of the original file.  Integrity verification  File integrity can be compromised, usually referred to as the file becoming corrupted. A file can become corrupted by a variety of ways: faulty storage media, errors in transmission, write errors during copying or moving, software bugs, and so on. Hash-based verification ensures that a file has not been corrupted by comparing the file's hash value to a previously calculated value. If these values match, the file is presumed to be unmodified. Due to the nature of hash functions, hash collisions may result in false positives, but the likelihood of collisions is often negligible with random corruption.  Authenticity verification  It is often desirable to verify that a file hasn't been modified in transmission or storage by untrusted parties, for example, to include malicious code such as viruses or backdoors. To verify the authenticity, a classical hash function is not enough as they are not designed to be collision resistant; it is computationally trivial for an attacker to cause deliberate hash collisions, meaning that a malicious change in the file is not detected by a hash comparison. In cryptography, this attack is called a preimage attack. For this purpose, cryptographic hash functions are employed often. As long as the hash sums cannot be tampered with -- for example, if they are communicated over a secure channel -- the files can be presumed to be intact. Alternatively, digital signatures can be employed to assure tamper resistance.  File formats  A checksum file is a small file that contains the checksums of other files. There are a few well-known checksum file formats. \\"Checksum\\". Several utilities, such as md5deep, can use such checksum files to automatically verify an entire directory of files in one operation. The particular hash algorithm used is often indicated by the file extension of the checksum file. The \\".sha1\\" file extension indicates a checksum file containing 160-bit SHA-1 hashes in sha1sum format. The \\".md5\\" file extension, or a file named \\"MD5SUMS\\", indicates a checksum file containing 128-bit MD5 hashes in md5sum format. The \\".sfv\\" file extension indicates a checksum file containing 32-bit CRC32 checksums in simple file verification format. The \\"crc.list\\" file indicates a checksum file containing 32-bit CRC checksums in brik format. As of 2012, best practice recommendations is to use SHA-2 or SHA-3 to generate new file integrity digests; and to accept MD5 and SHA1 digests for backward compatibility if stronger digests are not available. The theoretically weaker SHA1, the weaker MD5, or much weaker CRC were previously commonly used for file integrity checks.NIST. \\"NIST's policy on hash functions\\" . 2012.

CRC checksums cannot be used to verify the authenticity of files, as CRC32 is not a collision resistant hash function -- even if the hash sum file is not tampered with, it is computationally trivial for an attacker to replace a file with the same CRC digest as the original file, meaning that a malicious change in the file is not detected by a CRC comparison.

Popularly called the \\"City Summit\\", it brought together high-level representatives of national and local governments, as well as private sector, NGOs, research and training institutions and the media. Universal goals of ensuring adequate shelter for all and human settlements safer, healthier and more livable cities, inspired by the Charter of the United Nations, were discussed and endorsed. Habitat II received its impetus from the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and General Assembly resolution A/RES/47/180. The conference outcomes were integrated in the Istanbul Declaration and the Habitat Agenda, and adopted as a new global action plan to realize sustainable human settlements. The Secretary-General of the Conference was Dr. Wally N'Dow. The objectives for Habitat II were stated as: in the long term, to arrest the deterioration of global human settlements conditions and ultimately create the conditions for achieving improvements in the living environment of all people on a sustainable basis, with special attention to the needs and contributions of women and vulnerable social groups whose quality of life and participation in development have been hampered by exclusion and inequality, affecting the poor in general;to adopt a general statement of principles and commitments and formulate a related global plan of action capable of guiding national and international efforts through the first two decades of the next century. A new mandate for the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (UNCHS) was derived to support and monitor the implementation of the Habitat Agenda adopted at the Conference and approved by the General Assembly.

The Andronovo, BMAC and Yaz cultures have often been associated with Indo-Iranian migrations. The GGC (Swat), Cemetery H, Copper Hoard and PGW cultures are candidates for cultures associated with Indo-Aryan migrations. The Bactria‚ÄìMargiana Archaeological Complex (short BMAC), also known as the Oxus civilization, is the modern archaeological designation for a Bronze Age civilization of Central Asia, dated to c. 2400‚Äì1900 BC in its urban phase or Integration Era,Vidale, Massimo, 2017. Treasures from the Oxus, I.B. Tauris, pp. 9, 18, & Table 1, located in present-day northern Afghanistan, eastern Turkmenistan, southern Uzbekistan and western Tajikistan, centred on the upper Amu Darya (Oxus River) in Bactria, and at Murghab river delta in Margiana. Its sites were discovered and named by the Soviet archaeologist Viktor Sarianidi (1976). Bactria was the Greek name for the area of Bactra (modern Balkh), in what is now northern Afghanistan, and Margiana was the Greek name for the Persian satrapy of Margu≈°, the capital of which was Merv, in modern-day southeastern Turkmenistan. Sarianidi's excavations from the late 1970s onward revealed numerous monumental structures in many sites, fortified by impressive walls and gates. Reports on the BMAC were mostly confined to Soviet journals,See Sarianidi, V. I. 1976. \\"Issledovanija pamjatnikov Dashlyiskogo Oazisa,\\" in Drevnii Baktria, vol. 1. Moscow: Akademia Nauk. a journalist from The New York Times wrote in 2001 that he thought that during the years of the Soviet Union, the findings were largely unknown to the West until Sarianidi's work began to be translated in the 1990s,John Noble Wilford, (May 13, 2001). \\"In Ruin, Symbols on a Stone Hint at a Lost Asian Culture\\", in New York Times. however there were already some publications by Soviet authors, like Masson, Sarianidi, Atagarryev, and Berdiev, in Western World since the 1970s at least.Kurbanov, Aydogdy, (14 September 2018). \\"A brief history of archaeological research in Turkmenistan from the beginning of the 20th century until the present\\", in Arch√©Orient.Atagarryev E., and Berdiev O.K., (1970). \\"The Archaeological Exploration of Turkmenistan in the Year of Soviet Power\\", East and West 20, pp. 285-306.Masson, V.M., and V.I.

Development =Early Food Producing Era= There is archaeological evidence of settlement in the well-watered northern foothills of the Kopet Dag during the Neolithic period, in this region, at Jeitun (or Djeitun), mud brick houses were first occupied during Early Food Producing Era, also known as Jeitun Neolithic from c. 7200 to 4600 BC.Vidale, Massimo, (2017). Treasures from the Oxus, p. 9, Table 1. The inhabitants were farmers who kept herds of goats and sheep and grew wheat and barley, with origins in southwest Asia. Jeitun has given its name to the whole Neolithic period in the northern foothills of the Kopet Dag. At the late Neolithic site of Chagylly Depe, farmers increasingly grew the kinds of crops that are typically associated with irrigation in an arid environment, such as hexaploid bread wheat, which became predominant during the Chalcolithic period. This region is dotted with the multi-period hallmarks characteristic of the ancient Near East, similar to those southwest of the Kopet Dag in the Gorgan Plain in Iran. Female statuette, an example of a \\"Bactrian princess\\"; late 3rd‚Äìearly 2nd millennium BC; steatite or chlorite and alabaster; 9 √ó 9.4 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York City) =Regionalization Era= Regionalization Era begins in Anau IA with a pre-Chalcolithic phase also in Kopet Dag piedmont region from 4600 to 4000 BC, then Chalcolithic period develops from 4000 to 2800 BC in Namazga I-III, Ilgynly Depe, and Altyn Depe. During this Copper Age, the population of the region grew. Archaeologist Vadim Mikhaƒ≠lovich Masson, who led the South Turkmenistan Complex Archaeological Expedition from 1946, sees signs that people migrated to the region from central Iran at this time, bringing metallurgy and other innovations, but thinks that the newcomers soon blended with the Jeitun farmers. (Vadim was the son of archaeologist Mikhail Masson, who already started work in this same area previously.) By contrast a re- excavation of Monjukli Depe in 2010 found a distinct break in settlement history between the late neolithic and early chalcolithic eras there.Reinhard Bernbeck et al., \\"A-II Spatial Effects of Technological Innovations and Changing Ways of Life,\\" in Friederike Fless, Gerd Gra√ühoff, Michael Meyer (eds.), Reports of the Research Groups at the Topoi Plenary Session 2010, eTopoi: Journal for Ancient Studies, Special Volume 1 (2011).Monjukli Depe artefacts (in German). Altyn-Depe location on the modern Middle East map as well as location of other Eneolithic cultures (Harappa and Mohenjo-daro). Major chalcolithic settlements sprang up at Kara-Depe and Namazga-Depe. In addition, there were smaller settlements at Anau, Dashlyji, and Yassy-depe. Settlements similar to the early level at Anau also appeared further east‚Äì in the ancient delta of the river Tedzen, the site of the Geoksiur Oasis. About 3500 BC, the cultural unity of the area split into two pottery styles: colourful in the west (Anau, Kara-Depe and Namazga-Depe) and more austere in the east at Altyn-Depe and the Geoksiur Oasis settlements. This may reflect the formation of two tribal groups. It seems that around 3000 BC, people from Geoksiur migrated into the Murghab delta (where small, scattered settlements appeared) and reached further east into the Zerafshan Valley in Transoxiana. In both areas pottery typical of Geoksiur was in use. In Transoxiana they settled at Sarazm near Pendjikent. To the south the foundation layers of Shahr-i Sh≈çkhta on the bank of the Helmand river in south-eastern Iran contained pottery of the Altyn-Depe and Geoksiur type. Thus the farmers of Iran, Turkmenistan and Afghanistan were connected by a scattering of farming settlements. =Late Regionalization Era= In the Early Bronze Age, at the end of Late Regionalization Era (2800 to 2400 BC), the culture of the Kopet Dag oases and Altyn-Depe developed a proto-urban society. This corresponds to level IV at Namazga-Depe. Altyn-Depe was a major centre even then. Pottery was wheel-turned. Grapes were grown. =Integration Era= The height of this urban development was reached in the Middle Bronze Age also known as Integration Era, corresponding to Namazga-Depe level V (c. 2400-2000 BC). Namazga Depe reaching c. 52 hectares and holding maybe 17‚Äì20,000 inhabitants, and Altyn Depe with its maximum size of c. 25 hectares and 7-10,000 inhabitants, were the two big cities in Kopet Dag piedmont.Vidale, Massimo, (2017). Treasures from the Oxus, pp. 10, 18. It is this Bronze Age culture which has been given the BMAC name. Gonur Depe is the largest of all settlements in this period and is located at the delta of Murghab river in southern Turkmenistan (Margiana region) with an area of around 55 hectares. An almost elliptical fortified complex, known as Gonur North includes the so- called \\"Monumental Palace\\", other minor buildings, temples and ritual places, together with the \\"Royal Necropolis\\", and water reservoirs, all dating from around 2400 to 1900 BC.Frenez, Dennys, (2018). \\"Manufacturing and trade of Asian elephant ivory in Bronze Age Middle Asia: Evidence from Gonur Depe (Margiana, Turkmenistan)\\" in Archaeological Research in Asia 15, p. 15. In Bactria, Northern Afghanistan, the site Dashly 3 is regarded to be also from Middle Bronze Age period to Late Bronze Age (2300-1700 BCE), the old Dashly 3 complex, sometimes identified as a palace, is a fortified rectangular 88 m x 84 m compound. The square building had massive double outer walls and in the middle of each wall was a protruding salient composed of a T-shaped corridor flanked by two L-shaped corridors.K.E. Eduljee, \\"Dashly\\",(2005). Material culture Bird-headed man with snakes; 2000-1500 BC; bronze; 7.30 cm; from Northern Afghanistan; Los Angeles County Museum of Art (USA) =Agriculture and economy= The inhabitants of the BMAC were sedentary people who practised irrigation farming of wheat and barley. With their impressive material culture including monumental architecture, bronze tools, ceramics, and jewellery of semiprecious stones, the complex exhibits many of the hallmarks of civilisation. The complex can be compared to proto-urban settlements in the Helmand basin at Mundigak in western Afghanistan and Shahr-e Sukhteh in eastern Iran, or at Harappa and Mohenjo-daro in the Indus Valley. Models of two-wheeled carts from c. 3000 BC found at Altyn-Depe are the earliest evidence of wheeled transport in Central Asia, though model wheels have come from contexts possibly somewhat earlier. Judging by the type of harness, carts were initially pulled by oxen, or a bull. However camels were domesticated within the BMAC. A model of a cart drawn by a camel of c. 2200 BC was found at Altyn-Depe. =Art= Fertility goddesses, named \\"Bactrian princesses\\", made from limestone, chlorite and clay reflect agrarian Bronze Age society, while the extensive corpus of metal objects point to a sophisticated tradition of metalworking. Wearing large stylised dresses, as well as headdresses that merge with the hair, \\"Bactrian princesses\\" embody the ranking goddess, character of the central Asian mythology that plays a regulatory role, pacifying the untamed forces.

The palace of north Gonur measures 150 metres by 140 metres, the temple at Togolok 140 metres by 100 metres, the fort at Kelleli 3 125 metres by 125 metres, and the house of a local ruler at Adji Kui 25 metres by 25 metres. Each of these formidable structures has been extensively excavated. While they all have impressive fortification walls, gates, and buttresses, it is not always clear why one structure is identified as a temple and another as a palace. Mallory points out that the BMAC fortified settlements such as Gonur and Togolok resemble the qila, the type of fort known in this region in the historical period. They may be circular or rectangular and have up to three encircling walls. Within the forts are residential quarters, workshops and temples. The people of the BMAC culture were very proficient at working in a variety of metals including bronze, copper, silver, and gold. This is attested through the many metal artefacts found throughout the sites. Extensive irrigation systems have been discovered at the Geoksiur Oasis. =Writing= The discovery of a single tiny stone seal (known as the \\"Anau seal\\") with geometric markings from the BMAC site at Anau in Turkmenistan in 2000 led some to claim that the Bactria-Margiana complex had also developed writing, and thus may indeed be considered a literate civilisation. It bears five markings which are similar to Chinese \\"small seal\\" characters. The only match to the Anau seal is a small jet seal of almost identical shape from Niy√§ (near modern Minfeng) along the southern Silk Road in Xinjiang, originally thought to be from the Western Han dynasty but now thought to date to 700 BC. Interactions with other cultures BMAC materials have been found in the Indus Valley Civilisation, on the Iranian Plateau, and in the Persian Gulf. Finds within BMAC sites provide further evidence of trade and cultural contacts. They include an Elamite-type cylinder seal and a Harappan seal stamped with an elephant and Indus script found at Gonur-depe. The relationship between Altyn- Depe and the Indus Valley seems to have been particularly strong. Among the finds there were two Harappan seals and ivory objects. The Harappan settlement of Shortugai in Northern Afghanistan on the banks of the Amu Darya probably served as a trading station. There is evidence of sustained contact between the BMAC and the Eurasian steppes to the north, intensifying c. 2000 BC. In the delta of the Amu Darya where it reaches the Aral Sea, its waters were channelled for irrigation agriculture by people whose remains resemble those of the nomads of the Andronovo culture. This is interpreted as nomads settling down to agriculture, after contact with the BMAC, known as the Tazabagyab culture. About 1900 BC, the walled BMAC centres decreased sharply in size. Each oasis developed its own types of pottery and other objects. Also pottery of the Tazabagyab-Andronovo culture to the north appeared widely in the Bactrian and Margian countryside. Many BMAC strongholds continued to be occupied and Tazabagyab-Andronovo coarse incised pottery occurs within them (along with the previous BMAC pottery) as well as in pastoral camps outside the mudbrick walls. In the highlands above the Bactrian oases in Tajikistan, kurgan cemeteries of the Vaksh and Bishkent type appeared with pottery that mixed elements of the late BMAC and Tazabagyab-Andronovo traditions.David Anthony, The Horse, the Wheel and Language (2007), pp.452‚Äì56. In southern Bactrian sites like Sappali Tepe too, increasing links with the Andronovo culture are seen. During the period 1700 - 1500 BCE, metal artifacts from Sappali Tepe derive from the Tazabagyab-Andronovo culture. Relationship with Indo-Iranians The Bactria‚ÄìMargiana complex has attracted attention as a candidate for those looking for the material counterparts to the Indo-Iranians (Aryans), a major linguistic branch that split off from the Proto-Indo- Europeans. Sarianidi himself advocates identifying the complex as Indo- Iranian, describing it as the result of a migration from southwestern Iran. Bactria‚ÄìMargiana material has been found at Susa, Shahdad, and Tepe Yahya in Iran, but Lamberg-Karlovsky does not see this as evidence that the complex originated in southeastern Iran. \\"The limited materials of this complex are intrusive in each of the sites on the Iranian Plateau as they are in sites of the Arabian peninsula.\\" A significant section of the archaeologists are more inclined to see the culture as begun by farmers in the Near Eastern Neolithic tradition, but infiltrated by Indo-Iranian speakers from the Andronovo culture in its late phase, creating a hybrid. In this perspective, Proto-Indo-Aryan developed within the composite culture before moving south into the Indian subcontinent. The Andronovo, BMAC and Yaz cultures have often been associated with Indo-Iranian migrations. As James P. Mallory phrased it: According to recent studies BMAC was not a primary contributor to later South-Asian genetics. = Possible evidence for a BMAC substratum in Indo-Iranian = As argued by Michael Witzel and Alexander Lubotsky, there is a proposed substratum in Proto-Indo-Iranian which can be plausibly identified with the original language of the BMAC. Moreover, Lubotsky points out a larger number of words apparently borrowed from the same language, which are only attested in Indo-Aryan and therefore evidence of a substratum in Vedic Sanskrit. He explains this by proposing that Indo-Aryan speakers probably formed the vanguard of the movement into south-central Asia and many of the BMAC loanwords which entered Iranian may have been mediated through Indo-Aryan. Michael Witzel points out that the borrowed vocabulary includes words from agriculture, village and town life, flora and fauna, ritual and religion, so providing evidence for the acculturation of Indo-Iranian speakers into the world of urban civilisation.  Genetics  In 2018, Narasimhan and co-authors analyzed BMAC skeletons from the Bronze Age sites of Bustan, Dzharkutan, Gonur Tepe, and Sapalli Tepe. The male specimens belonged to haplogroup E1b1a (1/18), E1b1b (1/18), G (2/18), J* (2/18), J1 (1/18), J2 (4/18), L (2/18), R* (1/18), R1b (1/18), R2 (2/18), and T (1/18). A follow-up study by Narasimhan and co-authors (2019) suggested the primary BMAC population largely derived from preceding local Copper Age peoples who were in turn related to prehistoric farmers from the Iranian plateau and to a lesser extent early Anatolian farmers and hunter-gatherers from Western Siberia, and they did not contribute substantially to later populations further south in the Indus Valley. They found no evidence that the samples extracted from the BMAC sites derived any part of their ancestry from Yamnaya culture people, who are seen as Proto-Indo-Europeans in the Kurgan hypothesis, the most influential theory on the Proto-Indo-European homeland.

This term is used most often in reference to the preparation of insects, such as crickets and mealworms, or mice which are used as food for reptile pets. Insects that are raised commercially for the pet trade are themselves of little nutritional value. By providing the prey animals with a high quality diet prior to feeding, they become a more nutritious meal for the predator.Merck Veterinary Manual. www.merckvetmanual.com Gut loading can be accomplished by providing fruits, vegetables, and cereals or a nutritionally complete manufactured diet. Several commercial products are available and are fortified specifically for gut loading. These products often include varying combinations of carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber. Importance Gut loading is considered most important if the primary source of nutrition is from insects. This is due to the fact that commercially raised insects are very nutrient poor compared to wild counterparts. This is especially true of vitamin A, among many other nutrients. Gut loading is considered less important when animals such as mice are used as prey. This is because of the large amount of digestible energy and other nutrients a mammal contains in its tissues. It is also a less common practice when rodents are fed, because it is usually preferred to feed pre-killed prey from the store to protect the predator from being bitten. Methods Gut loading is designed to increase the nutrition of the prey's body and to fill the digestive tract of the prey with nutrients. As the term suggests, gut loading is usually looked upon as a way to get essential nutrients into a reptile via the ingestion of the digestive tract of the prey. The two methods of nutrient uptake are important due to the ability of the prey to process nutrients into a digestible form for the predator. For example, most prey can digest complex carbohydrates into other forms of nutritional energy which the predator can use. However, gut loading nutrients like calcium do not have to be digested by their prey before its death in order to be available to the predator.

The hat is known in Ireland as a paddy cap, in Scotland as a bunnet, in Wales as a Dai cap, in New Zealand as a cheese-cutter, and in the United States as a driving cap. Cloths used to make the cap include wool, tweed (most common), and cotton. Less common materials may include leather, linen, or corduroy. The inside of the cap is commonly lined for comfort and warmth. History Woolen flat cap Flat cap, side view, herringbone pattern The style can be traced back to the 14th century in Northern England, when it was more likely to be called a \\"bonnet\\". This term was replaced by \\"cap\\" before about 1700, except in Scotland, where it continues to be referred to as a bunnet in Scots. A 1571 Act of the English Parliament was enacted to stimulate domestic wool consumption and general trade. It decreed that on Sundays and holidays, all males over 6 years of age, except for the nobility and \\"persons of degree\\", were to wear woolen caps or pay a fine of three farthings (0.75 penny, or about ¬£0.003) per day. The Act was not repealed until 1597, though by then the flat cap had become firmly entrenched as a recognised mark of a non-noble person, such as a burgher, a tradesman, or an apprentice. The style may have been the same as the Tudor bonnet still used in some styles of academic dress. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, when men predominantly wore some form of headgear, flat caps were commonly worn throughout Great Britain and Ireland. Versions in finer cloth were also considered to be suitable casual countryside wear for upper-class Englishmen. Flat caps were worn by fashionable young men in the 1920s. Boys of all classes in the United Kingdom wore flat caps during this period. In the United States, the caps were worn from the 1890s. The cap grew in popularity at the turn of the 20th century and was at the time standard boys' wear. They were worn to school, for casual wear, and with suits. Flat caps were almost always worn with knicker suits in the 1910s and 1920s. Both flat caps and knickerbockers declined in popularity during the 1930s. The flat cap made its way to southern Italy in the late 1800s, likely brought by British servicemen. In Turkey, the flat cap became the main headgear for men after it became a replacement for the fez, which was banned by Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk in 1925. Academic regalia One of the flat hats worn in academia is known as a bonnet or Tudor bonnet and derives directly from medieval headgear of the period of the original 1571 Act. It remains ceremonial wear by members of the academic community in many countries, usually as the headgear of doctoral graduates. Commonly, it has a soft, round crown and a stiff, flat brim. The bonnet is often made of black velvet and trimmed, between crown and brim, with gold cord and tassels. Some universities opt to trim their bonnets with coloured cord and tassels. Some stylistic varieties of this bonnet are: *The Canterbury cap is a flat-topped, soft cloth hat with a round headband deeper at the back than at the front. *The Oxford bonnet has a black ribbon between crown and brim. *The John Knox cap is a soft, square cap made from black velvet and worn by the doctors of certain Scottish universities, as well as Durham University in England, the University of Calgary, and Queens' University in Canada. It is also worn by the holders of higher doctorates of the University of Liverpool and Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. The academic cap (mortar board), however, is more widely used in academia. British popular culture In British popular culture, the flat cap (or \\"flat hat\\") is typically associated with older working-class men, especially those in Northern England,Katie Wales (2006). Northern English: a cultural and social history. p. 26. Cambridge University Press and the West Country, as personified by Fred Dibnah (Lancashire) and comic strip anti-hero Andy Capp (Teesside). The flat cap's strong connection with the working class and the East End of London is illustrated by Jim Branning of the television soap opera EastEnders and Del- Boy Trotter of Only Fools and Horses. Taxicab and bus drivers are often depicted wearing a flat cap, as comedically portrayed by Gareth Hale and Norman Pace's (Hale and Pace) \\"London cabbies\\" television sketches. In the BBC show Peaky Blinders, characters show their membership of the Birmingham gang by sewing razor blades into the peak of their flat caps, supposedly for use as a weapon.AC/DC vocalist Brian Johnson, a native of Newcastle, customarily wears a flat cap on stage and frequently off.Anthony Bozza (2009). Why AC/DC Matters. p.54.

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, British public figures including David Beckham, Guy Ritchie, Richard Blackwood, and the Prince of Wales wore the flat cap. North American culture The flat cap hat is associated in North American (chiefly US) popular culture with city newsboys (i.e., street-corner newspaper sellers), the style sometimes being called a \\"newsboy\\" or newsboy cap, sometimes referred to as a \\"Kangol hat\\" due to conflation with the brand that makes certain styles of flat caps. It is also sometimes seen worn by older non- professional or amateur golfers. Current popularity Dick Berggren is known for wearing a flat cap. The style has remained popular among groups of people in the Great Britain, Ireland, and North America. The cap is sometimes associated with older men, significantly in South Korea, but has been popular (along with the newsboy cap) among some segments of younger people, for example, in cities such as Boston and Pittsburgh with a large Irish-American population. It has appeared in the hip hop subculture, sometimes worn back-to- front or cocked to the side. It is also very common among men and women in San Francisco, California. In Turkey, it is highly popular amongst men, mostly working-class. The English rugby league team Featherstone Rovers supporters' nickname is \\"the Flat Cappers\\", because supporters in years gone by attended matches wearing them as did most other teams' supporters. The black leather flat cap is often combined with a patched-up sport coat or leather jacket and dark clothes (sometimes combined with a bee-striped convict‚Äôs shirt) in popular culture to depict a burglar, mugger, or robber, occasionally with a domino mask. The comic book character the Goon is based on this archetype of the flat-capped street tough from vintage cartoons and comics. The Canadian team in the 1998 Winter Olympics wore red flat caps designed by Roots in the opening ceremony parade of nations. In addition, the US team in the 2008 Summer Olympics also wore white flat caps designed by Polo Ralph Lauren during the parade of nations. It is commonly worn within the gopnik subculture in Russia.

The USSOCOM version of the MK23 came paired with a laser aiming module (LAM) and suppressor. The USSOCOM MK23 was adopted by the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) for special operations units, beating out the nearest competitor, Colt's OHWS. Development of the pistol began in 1991 as special operations representatives identified the need for an \\"Offensive Handgun Weapons System‚ÄîSpecial Operations Peculiar\\", and delivery of the pistols began in May 1996 to the special operation units. While the USSOCOM MK23 designation usually applies to the complete system, it is also commonly used in reference to the pistol component alone. The LAM and suppressor were developed by Insight Technology and Knight's Armament Company (KAC), respectively. The civilian version of the Mk23 sold by itself is designated the Mark 23. Overview The MK 23 is considered a match grade pistol, and is capable of making a group at . The MK 23 is designed for exceptional durability in harsh environments, being waterproof and corrosion- resistant. It uses a polygonal barrel design, which is reported to improve accuracy and durability, and is much more expensive to produce. It also features an ambidextrous safety and magazine release on both sides of the frame. The magazine release is at the rear edge of the trigger guard, which is wide enough to allow the use of gloves. A decocking lever is on the left side, which will silently lower the cocked hammer. The MK 23 is part of a larger weapon system that includes an attachable Laser Aiming Module (LAM), a suppressor, and some other features such as a special high-pressure match cartridge (.45 +P ammunition). The firearm was tested and found to be capable of firing tens of thousands of rounds without a barrel change. It remains reliable in harsh conditions, making it suitable for use by special forces. The .45 ACP round has considerable stopping power and yet is subsonic, making it suitable for use with a suppressor. Development In 1989, US SOCOM began reviewing their equipment to see which gear fit the needs of their special close quarters battle role. Studying small arms revealed that there were 120 types and configurations of infantry weapons in different units. The logistics of getting spare parts for all these weapons was overwhelming. In response, SOCOM decided to standardize small arms among all units. One area of improvement was the pistol, undertaken by the Offensive Handgun Weapon System (OHWS) competition. It would replace pistols like the 9 mm M9, which was used by regular troops as a secondary weapon. SOCOM's use of small units that operate in close means that pistols are more likely to be used as primary weapons.MK23 Mod 0: The Crew-Served Pistol - SAdefensejournal.com, 10 June 2013 The caliber for the OHWS was quickly decided not to be the NATO standard 9 mm due to lack of stopping power. The FBI had selected the 10 mm auto to replace their 9 mm pistols, but it was too powerful, few manufacturers produced it, and the round caused short weapon service life. The .45 ACP caliber was chosen and improved upon with the high velocity, high pressure +P loading. The OHWS pistol had to fire many types of rounds in addition to the +P cartridge and have a long service life with the high pressure ammo. The M1911 had been proven in service for over 70 years, but was rejected. High pressure rounds would destroy it and it did not fire reliably with a suppressor. Upgrading the M1911 would cost more than it was worth, so it was decided that they would select an entirely new design. A request for quote was for a system that included a pistol, suppressor, and laser aiming module. The pistol had to be corrosion resistant, have a high mean rounds between failures (MRBF), and be able to serve as a primary weapon. After several tests, Heckler & Koch and Colt submissions were selected to move to phase I of the OHWS program in August 1991. They were awarded developmental contracts to produce 30 systems. At the time the program was beginning, HK was studying what aspects were most desirable in handguns for the U.S. civilian market. They came up with a design that had these features including reliability, durability, affordability, and others by February 1991. Colt however essentially drew upon existing technologies for their submission called the Colt OHWS. They used an M1911 frame that could accept a 10-round magazine, the decocking mechanism from the Colt Double Eagle, and the rotating barrel locking system from the All American 2000. The barrel of the Colt OHWS could not directly attach a suppressor, so a mounting was added to a rail in front of the handguard. Colt was eliminated after phase I, leaving only HK to move on to phase II. This phase subjected the pistols to the strictest reliability testing any pistol ever went through. The requirement was for no less than 2,000 MRBF; the HK OHWS averaged 6,027 MRBF and could reach 15,122 MRBF. Three pistols went through a 30,000-round endurance test and maintained accuracy of at 25 meters; only the O-ring needed replacement after 20,000 rounds. The weapons worked in temperatures from -25 degrees Fahrenheit to 140 degrees Fahrenheit while exposed to mud, ice, and sand. Phase III was the awarding of a production contract to HK in June 1995. Their pistol was type classified as the Mark 23 Mod 0, and 1,950 systems were ordered at $1,186 each. All pistols were produced in Germany and the first was delivered to SOCOM on 1 May 1996. Even though the Mark 23 had performed admirably, several factors worked against its use. Previous operators were trained to fire multiple 9 mm rounds and they thought firing extra rounds made up for not using harder hitting but larger and heavier .45 ACP rounds. The introduction of the smaller and lighter HK USP, political pressures, and shortages of +P ammunition also contributed against the pistol. As the War on Terror went on, operators saw the effectiveness of the .45 ACP in combat and renewed use of the Mark 23, as well as other pistols chambered for the round. Adoption The MK 23 MOD 0 was built as an \\"offensive\\" handgun for U.S. special operations forces under USSOCOM, per request made in 1989. Military versions of the firearm have the writing \\"MK23 USSOCOM\\" engraved on the slide. The first MK 23 production models were delivered to SOCOM on May 1, 1996.Dockery, Kevin. Special Warfare Special Weapons: The Arms & Equipment of the UDT and SEALs from 1943 to the Present (Chicago: Emperor's Press), 51. HK commercially markets the MK 23 and derivatives of it, but not the complete SOCOM system. The suppressor is made by Knight's Armament Company, and was selected over the one HK originally included as part of its entry. Insight Technology won the contract to produce the laser aiming module, later designated AN/PEQ-6. One version of the LAM produces a visible light dot, while another produces an infrared dot that can only be seen through night vision goggles. There have since been different LAM models and, at least commercially, different suppressors as well. It has been reported by some users that the cumulative effects of recoil may occasionally cause the can of the suppressor to become slightly unscrewed, but that it is relatively easy to improvise solutions for the problem. =Civilian Mark 23= Heckler & Koch has offered the MK 23 on the civilian market and law enforcement as the MARK 23. It is distributed by its subsidiaries HK Inc. (United States) and HKJS GmbH (Germany). The models for the U.S. market initially came with a 10-round magazine, to comply with the U.S. Assault Weapons Ban. The ban has now expired, and the civilian Mark 23 comes with the same 12-round magazine as the government variants, except in a few states that enforce their own bans on magazines larger than 10 rounds. In Canada, the Mark 23 pistol is still supplied only with 10-round magazines, as per the 1995 Firearms Act. According to the Operators Manual,MK 23 Operators Manual there are few differences between the civilian Mark 23 and the government MK 23. These differences are the slide engraving \\"Mark 23\\" which is only for the first half of the first year of production in 1996 (KG date code), the roll- mark \\"MARK 23\\" which is for mid 1996 to now, these instead of \\"MK23 USSOCOM\\", Matte vs shiny finish for different civilian years, tan vs black frame (500 tan ones were made), and a barrel conforming to SAAMI headspace specifications for the military vs civilian made, as the military barrels were made to allow ball ammunition to work more reliably. Alternatives In spite of its positive points, the MK 23's large size and weight have resulted in some criticism. The handgun was designed for offense rather than defense, the size and weight intentionally incorporated to help absorb recoil forces and retain greater accuracy; but this also decreased its ease of use, comfort, and draw speed in defensive situations which require a more conventional, compact pistol. In response, HK developed the USP Tactical pistol based on the original USP; USP Tactical and MK 23 look similar indeed being a different pistols by design and purpose, the Tactical retains much of the performance of the MK 23 without the bulky size. It uses a different suppressor (due to 16 X 1mm left handed threading, as opposed to 16 X 1mm right-handed on the MK 23). An even more compact pistol than the USP Tactical for counter-terrorist and special forces use is the HK USP Compact Tactical, which has its own optional LAM. The USP-CT is lighter and is capable of fitting a suppressor, making it a prime choice for Special Forces on covert operations. Recently, HK has developed the HK 45, a much more contoured pistol based on the P2000, P8 and P30 models.

It is situated on the Gulf of California, near the mouth of the Mayo River. It is located at latitude . Huatabampo is 34 km southwest of Navojoa via Sonora State Highway 56 and Sonora State Highway 149. Mexican Federal Highway 15 can be accessed via Sonora State Highway 176. It is notable as the home of revolutionary general √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n, a successful chickpea farmer before the Mexican Revolution, and now his burial site. Etymology The name Huatabampo is from the local Mayo language, \\"Huata\\" (Willow) + \\"Bampo\\" (Water), or \\"Willow in/near the Water\\". Huatabampo is also known as \\"Tierra de Generales\\" (Land of Generals) since during the Mexican Revolution (1910‚Äì1917) several high-ranking revolutionary generals emerged from this town. Among them, √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n (1880‚Äì1928), who was born in Navojoa, but lived for many years in Huatabampo, the only undefeated general in the war. He was elected President of the Mexican Republic (1920‚Äì1924) after the war, being an important link between the war-devastated country and the first stages of political, economical and social development. He was assassinated in 1928 after elected to a second term and before he took office. He is buried in the old local cemetery. Other generals from the area were General Jos√© Tiburcio Otero Toledo (1834‚Äì1900), a famous military and a governor of Sonora, and General Ignacio Otero Pablos (1896‚Äì1970), who was Ambassador to the Dominican Republic and Venezuela and also a candidate for governor of Sonora. Demographics The population was 74,533 in 2005, with 29,789 inhabitants living in the municipal seat.

As of 2005 the per capita income for the municipality of Huatabampo was $5,984 and the Human Development Index was 0.8002. Economy Huatabampo is a major agricultural producer for the area, its produce includes chickpeas as well as assorted fruit, vegetable and cereal crops. Cattle and swine raising is also very important. Since Huatabampo has 120 km of coastline, fishing plays a major role in the economy. There are over 3,000 registered fishermen and around 20 open sea trawlers, in addition to almost one thousand small boats. Shrimp raising has also become a major industry in recent years. In 2000 there were 8 industries for industrialization of sardines, crab, and shrimp. The production of fish oil and fish flour is also important. Tourism The city attracts a considerable number of tourists, primarily from the United States, due to its beaches and spas.

History The style was popular in Europe and North America in the early 20th centuries among both boys and adult men. As the name suggests, it was at the time associated with newspaper boys. This gives rise to a misunderstanding. It is true that many newspaper boys and other working boys at the time wore flat caps along with other styles. This style was not, however, worn only by boys. Flat caps were very common for North American and European men and boys of all classes during the early 20th century and were almost universal during the 1910s-20s, particularly among the working 'lower' classes. A great many photographs of the period show these caps worn not only by newsboys, but by dockworkers, high steel workers, shipwrights, costermongers, farmers, beggars, bandits, artisans, and tradesmen of many types. This is also well attested in novels and films of this period and just after. 8 piece style caps are essentially an offshoot of a scottish tam o' shanter.

It runs roughly, GlobalSecurity.org: Grand Trunk Road from Teknaf, Bangladesh west to Kabul, Afghanistan, passing through Chittagong and Dhaka in Bangladesh, Kolkata, Allahabad (Prayagraj), Delhi, and Amritsar in India, and Lahore, Rawalpindi, and Peshawar in Pakistan. Chandragupta Maurya of the Mauryan Empire in ancient India, built his highway along this ancient route called Uttarapatha in the 3rd century BC, extending it from the mouth of the Ganges to the north-western frontier of the Empire. Further improvements to this road were made under Ashoka. It was rebuilt many times under Sher Shah Suri, the Mughals and the British along a partly similar route.Romila Thapar, p. 236, Early India: From the Origins to AD 1300 The old route was re-aligned by Suri to Sonargaon and Rohtas.Vadime Elisseeff, p. 159-162, The Silk Roads: Highways of Culture and CommerceFarooqui Salma Ahmed, p. 234, A Comprehensive History of Medieval India: From Twelfth to the Mid- Eighteenth Century The Afghan end of the road was rebuilt under Mahmud Shah Durrani.

Over the centuries, the road acted as one of the major trade routes in the region and facilitated both travel and postal communication. The Grand Trunk Road is still used for transportation in present-day Indian subcontinent, where parts of the road have been widened and included in the national highway system.  History  = Ancient times = The Buddhist literature and Indian epics such as Mahabharata provide the existence of Grand Trunk road even before the Mauryan empire and was called Uttarpatha or the \\"Northern road\\". The road connected the eastern region of India with central Asia or Bactria. = Mauryan Empire = The precursor of the modern Grand Trunk road was built by the emperor Chandragupta Maurya and was based on the highway running from Susa to Sardis.Benjamin Walker, p. 69, Hindu World: An Encyclopedic Survey of Hinduism. In Two Volumes. Volume II M-Z During the time of the Mauryan Empire in the 3rd century BCE, overland trade between India and several parts of Western Asia and Bactria world went through the cities of the north-west, primarily Takshashila and Purushapura modern-day Peshawar (in present-day in Pakistan). Takshashila was well connected by roads with other parts of the Mauryan Empire. The Mauryas had maintained this very ancient highway from Takshashila to Patliputra (present-day Patna in India). Chandragupta Maurya had a whole army of officials overseeing the maintenance of this road as told by the Greek diplomat Megasthenes who spent fifteen years at the Mauryan court. Constructed in eight stages, this road is said to have connected the cities of Purushapura, Takshashila, Hastinapura, Kanyakubja, Prayag, Patliputra and Tamralipta, a distance of around . The route of Chandragupta was built over the ancient \\"Uttarapatha\\" or the Northern Road, which had been mentioned by PƒÅ·πáini. The emperor Ashoka had it recorded in his edict about having trees planted, wells built at every half kos and many \\"nimisdhayas\\", which is often translated as rest-houses along the route. The emperor Kanishka is also known to have controlled the Uttarapatha. = Sur and Mughal Empires = Sher Shah Suri, the medieval ruler of the Sur Empire, took to rebuilding Chandragupta's Royal Road in the 16th century., The old route was further rerouted at Sonargaon and Rohtas and its breadth increased. Fruit trees and shade trees were planted. At every 2 kos, a sarai was built, the number of kos minars and baolis increased. Gardens were also built alongside some sections of the highway. Those who stopped at the sarai were provided food for free. His son Islam Shah Suri constructed an additional sarai in- between every sarai originally built by Sher Shah Suri on the road toward Bengal. More sarais were built under the Mughals. Jahangir under his reign issued a decree that all sarais be built of burnt brick and stone. Broad- leaved trees were planted in the stretch between Lahore and Agra and he built bridges overall water bodies that were situated on the path of the highways. The route was referred to as \\"Sadak-e-Azam\\" by Suri, and \\"Badshahi Sadak\\" during Mughals.Anu Kapur, p. 84, Mapping Place Names of India = British Empire = A scene from the Ambala cantonment during the British India. In the 1830s the East India Company started a program of metalled road construction, for both commercial and administrative purposes.

A Public Works Department along with a training institute (the erstwhile Thomason College of Civil Engineering) which is now known as the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee was founded, to train and employ local surveyors, engineers, and overseers, to perform the work, and in future maintain it and other roads. The road is mentioned in a number of literary works including those of Foster and Rudyard Kipling. Kipling described the road as: \\"Look! Look again! and chumars, bankers and tinkers, barbers and bunnias, pilgrims ‚Äì and potters ‚Äì all the world going and coming.

It is a widespread and common resident breeder in much of Sub-Saharan Africa and into Arabia. The African grey hornbill has escaped or been deliberately released in to Florida, USA, but there is no evidence that the population is breeding and may only persist due to continuing releases or escapes. This bird prefers open woodland and savannah. The female lays two to four white eggs in a tree hollow, which is blocked off during incubation with a cement made of mud, droppings and fruit pulp. There is only one narrow aperture, just big enough for the male to transfer food to the mother and the chicks. When the chicks and female outgrow the nest, the mother breaks out and rebuilds the wall, after which both parents feed the chicks. At in length, this is a large bird, although it is one of the smaller hornbills. It has mainly grey plumage, but the head, flight feathers and long tail are a darker shade. There is a white line down each side of the head and one on the back which is visible only in flight. The long curved bill is black and has a small casque and a creamy horizontal stripe. The male has a black bill, whereas the female has red on the mandibles. The plumage of the male and female is similar. Immature birds are more uniformly grey. The flight is undulating. The similarly sized red- billed hornbill has uniformly grey plumage. The African grey hornbill is omnivorous, taking insects, fruit and reptiles. It feeds mainly in trees.

Formally, a mortgage lender (mortgagee), or other lienholder, obtains a termination of a mortgage borrower (mortgagor)'s equitable right of redemption, either by court order or by operation of law (after following a specific statutory procedure). Usually a lender obtains a security interest from a borrower who mortgages or pledges an asset like a house to secure the loan. If the borrower defaults and the lender tries to repossess the property, courts of equity can grant the borrower the equitable right of redemption if the borrower repays the debt. While this equitable right exists, it is a cloud on title and the lender cannot be sure that they can repossess the property.BFP v. Resolution Trust Corporation, . Therefore, through the process of foreclosure, the lender seeks to immediately terminate the equitable right of redemption and take both legal and equitable title to the property in fee simple.Terrell v. Allison, 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) 289 (1875). Other lien holders can also foreclose the owner's right of redemption for other debts, such as for overdue taxes, unpaid contractors' bills or overdue homeowner association dues or assessments. The foreclosure process as applied to residential mortgage loans is a bank or other secured creditor selling or repossessing a parcel of real property after the owner has failed to comply with an agreement between the lender and borrower called a \\"mortgage\\" or \\"deed of trust\\". Commonly, the violation of the mortgage is a default in payment of a promissory note, secured by a lien on the property. When the process is complete, the lender can sell the property and keep the proceeds to pay off its mortgage and any legal costs, and it is typically said that \\"the lender has foreclosed its mortgage or lien\\". If the promissory note was made with a recourse clause and if the sale does not bring enough to pay the existing balance of principal and fees, then the mortgagee can file a claim for a deficiency judgment. In many states in the United States, items included to calculate the amount of a deficiency judgment include the loan principal, accrued interest and attorney fees less the amount the lender bid at the foreclosure sale. Types The mortgage holder can usually initiate foreclosure at a time specified in the mortgage documents, typically some period of time after a default condition occurs. In the United States, Canada and many other countries, several types of foreclosure exist. In the US for example, two of themnamely, by judicial sale and by power of saleare widely used, but other modes are possible in a few other U.S. states. =Judicial= Foreclosure by judicial sale, commonly called judicial foreclosure, involves the sale of the mortgaged property under the supervision of a court. The proceeds go first to satisfy the mortgage, then other lien holders, and finally the mortgagor/borrower if any proceeds are left. Judicial foreclosure is available in every US state and required in many (Florida requires judicial foreclosure). The lender initiates judicial foreclosure by filing a lawsuit against the borrower. As with all other legal actions, all parties must be notified of the foreclosure, but notification requirements vary significantly from state to state in the US. A judicial decision is announced after the exchange of pleadings at a (usually short) hearing in a state or local court in the US. In some rather rare instances, foreclosures are filed in US federal courts. A judicial officer supervises the sale and executes the legal papers and deed if any. This may be done by a superior court judge or a referee specially appointed by a court of judicial privacy. =Nonjudicial= Foreclosure by power of sale, also called nonjudicial foreclosure, and is authorized by many states if a power of sale clause is included in the mortgage or if a deed of trust with such a clause was used, instead of an actual mortgage. In some US states, like California and Texas, nearly all so- called mortgages are actually deeds of trust. This process involves the sale of the property by the mortgage holder without court supervision (as elaborated upon below). This process is generally much faster and cheaper than foreclosure by judicial sale. As in judicial sale, the mortgage holder and other lien holders are respectively first and second claimants to the proceeds from the sale. =Strict= Other types of foreclosure are considered minor because of their limited availability. Under strict foreclosure, which is available in a few states including Connecticut, New Hampshire and Vermont, if the mortgagee wins the court case, the court orders the defaulted mortgagor to pay the mortgage within a specified period of time. Should the mortgagor fail to do so, the mortgage holder gains the title to the property with no obligation to sell it. This type of foreclosure is generally available only when the value of the property is less than the debt (\\"under water\\"). Historically, strict foreclosure was the original method of foreclosure. Acceleration Acceleration is a clause that is usually found in Sections 16, 17, or 18 of a typical mortgage in the US. Not all accelerations are the same for each mortgage, as it depends on the terms and conditions between lender and obligated mortgagor(s). When a term in the mortgage has been broken, the acceleration clause goes into effect. It can declare the entire payable debt to the lender if the borrower(s) were to transfer the title at a future date to a purchaser. The clause in the mortgage also instructs that a notice of acceleration must be served to the obligated mortgagor(s) who signed the Note. Each mortgage gives a time period for the debtor(s) to cure their loan. The most common time periods allot to debtor(s) is usually 30 days, but for commercial property it can be 10 days. The notice of acceleration is called a Demand and/or Breach Letter. In the letter it informs the Borrower(s) that they have 10 or 30 days from the date on the letter to reinstate their loan. Demand/Breach letters are sent out by Certified and Regular mail to all notable addresses of the Borrower(s). Also in the acceleration of the mortgage the lender must provide a payoff quote that is estimated 30 days from the date of the letter. This letter is called an FDCPA (Fair Debt Collections Practices Acts) letter and/or Initial Communication Letter. Once the Borrower(s) receives the two letters providing a time period to reinstate or pay off their loan the lender must wait until that time expires in to take further action. When the 10 or 30 days have passed that means that the acceleration has expired and the Lender can move forward with foreclosing on the property. The lender will also include any unpaid property taxes and delinquent payments in this amount, so if the borrower does not have significant equity they will owe more than the original amount of the mortgage. Lenders may also accelerate a loan if there is a transfer clause, obligating the mortgagor to notify the lender of any transfer, whether; a lease-option, lease-hold of 3 years or more, land contracts, agreement for deed, transfer of title or interest in the property. The vast majority (but not all) of mortgages today have acceleration clauses. The holder of a mortgage without this clause has only two options: either to wait until all of the payments come due or convince a court to compel a sale of some parts of the property in lieu of the past due payments. Alternatively, the court may order the property sold subject to the mortgage, with the proceeds from the sale going to the payments owed the mortgage holder. Process The process of foreclosure can be rapid or lengthy and varies from state to state. Other options such as refinancing, a short sale, alternate financing, temporary arrangements with the lender, or even bankruptcy may present homeowners with ways to avoid foreclosure. Websites which can connect individual borrowers and homeowners to lenders are increasingly offered as mechanisms to bypass traditional lenders while meeting payment obligations for mortgage providers. Although there are slight differences between the states, the foreclosure process generally follows a timeline beginning with initial missed payments, moving to a sale being scheduled and finally a redemption period (if available). =Strict and judicial= In the United States, there are two types of foreclosure in most states described by common law. Using a \\"deed in lieu of foreclosure,\\" or \\"strict foreclosure\\", the noteholder claims the title and possession of the property back in full satisfaction of a debt, usually on contract. In the proceeding simply known as foreclosure (or, perhaps, distinguished as \\"judicial foreclosure\\"), the lender must sue the defaulting borrower in state court. Upon final judgment (usually summary judgment) in the lender's favor, the property is subject to auction by the county sheriff or some other officer of the court. Many states require this sort of proceeding in some or all cases of foreclosure to protect any equity the debtor may have in the property, in case the value of the debt being foreclosed on is substantially less than the market value of the real property; this also discourages a strategic foreclosure by a lender who wants to obtain the property. In this foreclosure, the sheriff then issues a deed to the winning bidder at auction. Banks and other institutional lenders may bid in the amount of the owed debt at the sale but there are a number of other factors that may influence the bid, and if no other buyers step forward the lender receives title to the real property in return. =Nonjudicial= Historically, the vast majority of judicial foreclosures have been unopposed, since most defaulting borrowers have no money to hire counsel. Therefore, the U.S. financial services industry has lobbied since the mid-19th century for faster foreclosure procedures that would not clog up state courts with uncontested cases, and would lower the cost of credit (because it must always have the cost of recovering collateral built-in). Lenders have also argued that taking foreclosures out of the courts is actually kinder and less traumatic to defaulting borrowers, as it avoids the in terrorem effects of being sued. In response, a slight majority of U.S. states have adopted nonjudicial foreclosure procedures in which the mortgagee (or more commonly the mortgagee's servicer's attorney, designated agent, or trustee) gives the debtor a notice of default (NOD) and the mortgagee's intent to sell the real property in a form prescribed by state statute; the NOD in some states must also be recorded against the property. This type of foreclosure is commonly called \\"statutory\\" or \\"nonjudicial\\" foreclosure, as opposed to \\"judicial\\", because the mortgagee does not need to file an actual lawsuit to initiate the foreclosure. A few states impose additional procedural requirements such as having documents stamped by a court clerk; Colorado requires the use of a county \\"public trustee,\\" a government official, rather than a private trustee specializing in carrying out foreclosures. However, in most states, the only government official involved in a nonjudicial foreclosure is the county recorder, who merely records any pre-sale notices and the trustee's deed upon sale. In this \\"power-of-sale\\" type of foreclosure, if the debtor fails to cure the default, or use other lawful means (such as filing for bankruptcy to temporarily stay the foreclosure) to stop the sale, the mortgagee or its representative conduct a public auction in a manner similar to the sheriff's auction. Notably, the lender itself can bid for the property at the auction, and is the only bidder that can make a \\"credit bid\\" (a bid based on the outstanding debt itself) while all other bidders must be able to immediately (or within a very short period of time) present the auctioneer with cash or a cash equivalent like a cashier's check. In May 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court, resolved uncertainty surrounding a secured creditor's right to credit bid in a sale under a Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan. In RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated Bank, 566 U.S.  (2012), the Court found it was obligated to interpret the bankruptcy code ‚Äúclearly and predictably using well established principles of statutory construction‚Äù resolving the lingering uncertainties of credit bidding under a chapter 11 plan and upholding secured creditors‚Äô rights. The highest bidder at the auction becomes the owner of the real property, free and clear of interest of the former owner, but possibly encumbered by liens superior to the foreclosed mortgage (e.g., a senior mortgage, unpaid property taxes, weed/demolition liens). Further legal action, such as an eviction, may be necessary to obtain possession of the premises if the former occupant fails to voluntarily vacate. =Defenses= In some US states, particularly those where only judicial foreclosure is available, the constitutional issue of due process has affected the ability of some lenders to foreclose. In Ohio, the US federal district court for the Northern District of Ohio has dismissed numerous foreclosure actions by lenders because of the inability of the alleged lender to prove that they are the real party in interest.JUDGE CHRISTOPHER A. BOYKO, ‚ÄúUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT NORTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO (EASTERN DIVISION)‚Äù, filed 10-31-2007 Retrieved July 12, 2008 The same happened in a Colorado district court case in June 2008.Block Colorado Foreclosure Blog www.blockcoloradoforeclosure.com In contrast, in six federal judicial circuits and the majority of nonjudicial foreclosure states (like California), due process has already been judicially determined to be a frivolous defense.Apao v. Bank of New York, 324 F.3d 1091 (9th Cir. 2003). The entire point of nonjudicial foreclosure is that there is no state actor (i.e., a court) involved.Garfinkle v. Superior Court, 21 Cal. 3d 268 (1978). This was a decision of the Supreme Court of California in favor of Wells Fargo. The constitutional right of due process protects people only from violations of their civil rights by state actors, not private actors. (The involvement of the county clerk or recorder in recording the necessary documents has been held to be insufficient to invoke due process, since they are required by statute to record all documents presented that meet minimum formatting requirements and are denied the discretion to decide whether a particular foreclosure should proceed.) A further rationale is that under the principle of freedom of contract, if debtors wish to enjoy the additional protection of the formalities of judicial foreclosure, it is their burden to find a lender willing to provide a loan secured by a traditional conventional mortgage instead of a deed of trust with a power of sale. Courts have also rejected as frivolous the argument that the mere legislative act of authorizing or regulating the nonjudicial foreclosure process thereby transforms the process itself into state action. In turn, since there is no right to due process in nonjudicial foreclosure, it has been held that it is irrelevant whether the borrower had actual notice (i.e., subjective awareness) of the foreclosure, as long as the foreclosure trustee performed the tasks prescribed by statute in an attempt to give notice.I.E. Associates v. Safeco Title Ins. Co., 39 Cal. 3d 281 (1985). =Equitable foreclosure= \\"Strict foreclosure\\" available in some states is an equitable right of the foreclosure sale purchaser. The purchaser must petition a court for a decree that cancels any junior lien holder's rights to the senior debt. If the junior lien holder fails to object within the judicially established time frame, his lien is canceled and the purchaser's title is cleared. This effect is the same as the strict foreclosure that occurred in English common law of equity as a response to the development of the equity of redemption. =Title search and tax lien issues= In most jurisdictions, it is customary for the foreclosing lender to obtain a title search of the real property and to notify all other persons who may have liens on the property, whether by judgment, by contract, or by statute or other law, so that they may appear and assert their interest in the foreclosure litigation. This is accomplished through the filing of a lis pendens as part of the lawsuit and recordation of it in order to provide public notice of the pendency of the foreclosure action. In all U.S. jurisdictions, a lender who conducts a foreclosure sale of real property that has a federal tax lien must give 25 days notice of the sale to the Internal Revenue Service. Failure to give notice results in the lien remaining attached to the real property after the sale. Therefore, it is imperative the lender search local federal tax liens, so that if parties to the foreclosure have a federal tax lien filed against them, the proper notice to the IRS is given. A detailed explanation by the IRS of the federal tax lien process can be found.Notice of Federal Tax Lien ‚Äî Internal Revenue Service United States Department of the Treasury Retrieved 16 March 2008lawsuit and recordation of it in order to provide public notice of the pendency of the foreclosure action. In all U.S. jurisdictions a lender who conducts a foreclosure sale of real property which is the subject of a federal tax lien must give 25 days' notice of the sale to the Internal Revenue Service: failure to give notice to the IRS results in the lien remaining attached to the real property after the sale. Therefore, it is imperative the lender search local federal tax liens so if parties involved in the foreclosure have a federal tax lien filed against them, the proper notice to the IRS is given. A detailed explanation by the IRS of the federal tax lien process can be found Contesting a foreclosure Because the right of redemption is an equitable right, foreclosure is an action in equity. To keep the right of redemption, the debtor may be able to petition the court for an injunction. If repossession is imminent, the debtor must seek a temporary restraining order. However, the debtor may have to post a bond in the amount of the debt. This protects the creditor if the attempt to stop foreclosure is simply an attempt to escape the debt. A debtor may also challenge the validity of the debt in a claim against the bank to stop the foreclosure and sue for damages. In a foreclosure proceeding, the lender also bears the burden of proving they have standing to foreclose. Several U.S. states, including California,Arnolds Management Corp. v. Eischen, 158 Cal. App. 3d 575, 205 Cal. Rptr. 15 (1984). Georgia,Berry v. Government Nat. Mortgage Association, 231 Ga. 503, 202 S.E.2d 450 (1973). and TexasGinther- Davis Ctr., Ltd. v. Houston Nat'l Bank, 600 S.W.2d 856, 864 (Tex. Civ. App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1980, writ ref'd n.r.e). impose a \\"tender\\" condition precedent upon borrowers seeking to challenge a wrongful foreclosure, which is rooted in the maxim of equity principle that \\"he who seeks equity must first do equity\\", as well as the common law rule that the party seeking rescission of a contract must first return all benefits received under the contract. In other words, to challenge an allegedly wrongful foreclosure, the borrower must make legal tender of the entire remaining balance of the debt prior to the foreclosure sale. California has one of the strictest forms of this rule, in that the funds must be received by the lender before the sale. One tender attempt was held inadequate when the check arrived via FedEx on a Monday, three days after the foreclosure sale had already occurred on Friday.Nguyen v. Calhoun, 105 Cal. App. 4th 428, 129 Cal. Rptr. 2d 436 (2003). At least one textbook has attacked the paradox inherent in the tender rule‚Äînamely, if the borrower actually had enough cash to promptly pay the entire balance, they would have already paid it off and the lender would not be trying to foreclose upon them in the first placeGrant S. Nelson and Dale A. Whitman, Real Estate Finance Law, 5th ed. (St. Paul: West, 2007), ¬ß 7.22 at 879.‚Äîbut it continues to be the law in the aforementioned states. Occasionally, borrowers have raised enough cash at the last minute (usually through desperate fire sales of other unencumbered assets) to offer good tender and have thereby preserved their rights to challenge the foreclosure process. Courts have been unsympathetic to attempts by such borrowers to recover fire sale losses from foreclosing lenders.Price v. Wells Fargo Bank, 213 Cal. App. 3d 465, 476, 261 Cal. Rptr. 735 (1989). One noteworthy court case questions the legality of the foreclosure practice is sometimes cited as proof of various claims regarding lending. In the case First National Bank of Montgomery v. Jerome Daly, Jerome Daly claimed that the bank did not offer a legal form of consideration because the money loaned to him was created upon signing of the loan contract. The myth reports that Daly won, did not have to repay the loan, and the bank could not repossess his property. In fact, the \\"ruling\\" (widely referred to as the \\"Credit River Decision\\") was ruled a nullity by the courts. In a recent New York case, the Court rejected a lender's attempt to foreclose on summary judgment because the lender failed to submit proper affidavits and papers in support of its foreclosure action and also, the papers and affidavits that were submitted were not prepared in the ordinary course of business. Many borrowers' attorneys will establish a lender proof of compliance with the 90-day pre-foreclosure notice requirement in order to delay and prolong forecosure proceedings giving the borrower an extra 3 months to clean their record and pay off debt.https://rew-online.com/2016/10/opinion-recent-efforts- to-speed-up-foreclosure-proceedings-in-n-y/ Foreclosure auction When the entity (in the US, typically a county sheriff or designee) auctions a foreclosed property the noteholder may set the starting price as the remaining balance on the mortgage loan. However, there are a number of issues that affect how pricing for properties is considered, including bankruptcy rulings. In a weak market, the foreclosing party may set the starting price at a lower amount if it believes the real estate securing the loan is worth less than the remaining principal of the loan. Time from notice of foreclosures to actual property sales depends on many factors, such as the method of foreclosure (judicial or non-judicial). When the remaining mortgage balance is higher than the actual home value, the foreclosing party is unlikely to attract auction bids at this price level. A house that has gone through a foreclosure auction and failed to attract any acceptable bids may remain the property of the owner of the mortgage. That inventory is called REO (real estate owned). In these situations, the owner/servicer tries to sell it through standard real estate channels. Further borrower's obligations The mortgagor may be required to pay for Private Mortgage Insurance, or PMI, for as long as the principal of his or her primary mortgage is above 80% of the value of his or her property. In most situations, insurance requirements guarantee that the lender gets back some pre-defined proportion of the loan value, either from foreclosure auction proceeds or from PMI or a combination of those. Nevertheless, in an illiquid real estate market or if real estate prices drop, the property being foreclosed could be sold for less than the remaining balance on the primary mortgage loan, and there may be no insurance to cover the loss. In this case, the court overseeing the foreclosure process may enter a deficiency judgment against the mortgagor. Deficiency judgments can be used to place a lien on the borrower's other property that obligates the mortgagor to repay the difference. It gives lender a legal right to collect the remainder of debt out of mortgagor's other assets (if any). There are exceptions to this rule. If the mortgage is a non-recourse debt (which is often the case with owner- occupied residential mortgages in the U.S.), lender may not go after borrower's assets to recoup his losses. Lender's ability to pursue deficiency judgment may be restricted by state laws. In California and some other US states, original mortgages (the ones taken out at the time of purchase) are typically non-recourse loans; however, refinanced loans and home equity lines of credit are not. If the lender chooses not to pursue deficiency judgment‚Äîor cannot because the mortgage is non-recourse‚Äîand accepts the loss, the borrower may have to pay income taxes on the unrepaid amount if it can be considered \\"forgiven debt\\". However, recent changes in tax laws may change the way these amounts are reported. Any liens resulting from other loans against the property being foreclosed (second mortgages, HELOCs) are \\"wiped out\\" by foreclosure. Renegotiation alternative In the wake of the United States housing bubble and the subsequent subprime mortgage crisis there has been increased interest in renegotiation or modification of the mortgage loans rather than foreclosure, and some commentators have speculated that the crisis was exacerbated by the \\"unwillingness of lenders to renegotiate mortgages\\". Several policies, including the U.S. Treasury sponsored Hope Now initiative and the 2009 \\"Making Home Affordable\\" plan have offered incentives to renegotiate mortgages. Renegotiations can include lowering the principal due or temporarily reducing the interest rate. A 2009 study by Federal Reserve economists found that even using a broad definition of renegotiation, only 3% of \\"seriously delinquent borrowers\\" received a modification. The leading theory attributes the lack of renegotiation to securitization and a large number of claimants with security interest in the mortgage. There is some support behind this theory, but an analysis of the data found that renegotiation rates were similar among unsecuritized and securitized mortgages. The authors of the analysis argue that banks don't typically renegotiate because they expect to make more money with a foreclosure, as renegotiation imposes \\"self-cure\\" and \\"redefault\\" risks.Adelino et al. (2009). Why Don‚Äôt Lenders Renegotiate More Home Mortgages? Redefaults, Self-Cures, and Securitization . Federal Reserve Bank of Boston Discussion Paper. Government supported programs such as Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) may provide homeowners the ability to refinance their mortgages if they are unable to obtain a traditional refinance due to their declined home value.\\"Avoiding Foreclosure\\" , HUD.GOV, July 20, 2012 A dual-tracking process appeared to be in use by many lenders, however, where the lender would simultaneously talk to the borrower about a \\"loan modification\\", but also move ahead with a foreclosure sale of the borrower's property. Borrowers were heard to complain that they were misled by these practices and would often be \\"surprised\\" that their home had been sold at foreclosure auction, as they believed they were in a \\"loan modification process\\". California has enacted legislation to eliminate this type of \\"dual-tracking\\" - The Homeowner Bill of Rights - AB 278, SB 900, That went into effect on January 1, 2013.California Homeowner Bill of Rights Reviewed 2013-07-20 Experiences of households post-foreclosure A 2011 research paper by the Federal Reserve Board, ‚ÄúThe Post-Foreclosure Experience of U.S. Households,‚Äù used credit reports from more than 37 million individuals between 1999 and 2010 to measure post-foreclosure behavior, especially in regard to future borrowing and housing consumption. The study found that: 1) On average 23% of people experiencing foreclosure had moved within a year of the foreclosure process starting. In the same time, a control group (not facing foreclosure) had only a 12% migration rate; 2) Only 30% of post- foreclosure borrowers moved to neighborhoods with median income at least 25% lower than their previous neighborhood; 3) The majority of post-foreclosure migrants do not end up in substantially less-desirable neighborhoods or more crowded living conditions; 4) There was no significant difference in household size between the post-foreclosure and control groups. However, only 17% of the post-foreclosure individuals had the same number and composition of household members after a foreclosure than before. By comparison, the control group maintained the same household companions in 46% of cases; and, 5) Only about 20% of post-foreclosure individuals chose to live in households where one person maintained a mortgage. Overall, the authors conclude that it is ‚Äúdifficult to say whether this small effect is because the shock that leads to foreclosure is not long-lasting, because the credit constraints imposed by having a foreclosure on one‚Äôs credit report are not large, or because housing services are more inelastic than other forms of consumption.\\" Reviewed 2013-07-20 Affected demographics Recent housing studies indicate that minority households disproportionately experience foreclosures. Other overly represented groups include African Americans, renter households, households with children, and foreign-born homeowners. For example, statistics show that African American buyers are 3.3 times more likely than white buyers to be in foreclosure, while Latino and Asian buyers are 2.5 and 1.6 times more likely, respectively. As another statistical example, over 60 per cent of the foreclosures that occurred in New York City in 2007 involved rental properties. Twenty percent of the foreclosures nationwide were from rental properties. One reason for this is that the majority of these people have borrowed with risky subprime loans. There is a major lack of research done in this area posing problems for three reasons. One, not being able to describe who experiences foreclosure makes it challenging to develop policies and programs that can prevent/reduce this trend for the future. Second, researchers cannot tell the extent to which recent foreclosures have reversed the advances in homeownership that some groups, historically lacking equal access, have made. Third, research is focused too much on community-level effects even though it is the individual households that are most strongly affected.Allen, R. Who Experiences Foreclosures? The Characteristics of Households Experiencing a Foreclosure in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Housing Studies, 26(6), 845-866. Many people cite their own or their family members medical conditions as the primary reason for undergoing a foreclosure. Many do not have health insurance and are unable to adequately provide for their medical needs. This again points to the fact that foreclosures affects already vulnerable populations.Pollack, C., & Lynch, J. (2009). Health Status of People Undergoing Foreclosure in the Philadelphia Region. American Journal of Public Health, 99(10), 1833-1839. Credit scores are greatly impacted after a foreclosure. The average number of points reduced when you are 30 days late on your mortgage payment is 40 - 110 points, 90 days late is 70 - 135 points, and a finalized foreclosure, short sale or deed-in-lieu is 85 - 160 points.Les Christie, \\"How foreclosure impacts your credit score\\" , CNN Money, April 22, 2012 Recent trends In 2009, the United States Congress tried to rescue the economy with a $700 billion bailout for the financial industry; however, there was a growing consensus that the deepening collapse of the housing market was at the heart of the country's acute economic downturn. After spending billions of dollars rescuing financial institutions only to see the economy spiral even deeper into crisis, both liberal and conservative economists and lawmakers pushed to redirect an economic stimulus bill to what they saw as the core problem: the housing market. But beneath the consensus over helping the housing market, there were huge differences over who should benefit under the competing plans. Democrats wanted to aim money directly at people in the greatest distress; and Republicans wanted to aim money at almost all homebuyers, on the theory that a rising tide would eventually lift all boats. In 2010, there was a 14% increase in the number of homes receiving a default notice between July and September. In that year one in every 45 homes received a foreclosure filing and the problem has become more widespread with the increasing rates of unemployment across the nation. Banks have become extremely aggressive without much patience for those who have fallen behind on their mortgage payments, and there are more families entering the foreclosure process sooner than ever. In 2011, banks were on track to repossess over 800,000 homes.Associated Press. \\"Sharp Rise in Foreclosures as Banks Move in - Business - Real Estate ‚Äì Msnbc.com.\\" NBC News - Breaking News, Science and Tech News, World News, US News, Local News- NBC News.

In 2010, the highest rates of foreclosure filings were in Las Vegas, Nevada; Fort Myers, Florida; Modesto, California; Scottsdale, Arizona; Miami, Florida; and Ontario, California. The geographic diversity of these cities is made up for by the fact they these are all relatively metropolitan areas. Big cities like Houston, Texas saw a 26% increase in 2010, 23% in Seattle, Washington and 21% in Atlanta, Georgia. These cities had the lowest rates of unemployment. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the cities with the lowest rates of foreclosure were Rome, NY; South Burlington, VT; Charleston, WV; Bryan, TX; and Tuscaloosa, AL.Hoak, Amy. \\"Top 10 Cities Where Foreclosure Rates Are Highest ‚Äì MarketWatch.\\"MarketWatch - Stock Market Quotes, Business News, Financial News.

Not surprisingly, these areas had some of the highest nationwide rates of unemployment, helping to further demonstrate this correlation. A quote from RealtyTrac CEO James Saccacio summarizes the recent trends: > ‚ÄúForeclosure floodwaters receded somewhat in 2010 in the nation‚Äôs hardest- > hit housing markets. Even so, foreclosure levels remained five to 10 times > higher than historic norms in most of those hard-hit markets, where deep > fault-lines of risk remain and could potentially trigger more waves of > foreclosure activity in 2011 and beyond.‚Äù As per the foreclosure data report of RealtyTrac for January 2014, 1 in every 1,058 homes in U.S received a foreclosure filing. This figure falls in the higher spectrum of foreclosure frequency. As of August 2014, the foreclosure rate was 33.7%, 1.7% up from the last year. The rise in foreclosure activity has been most significant in New York and New Jersey, the two most densely populated areas in U.S. Closely following them is Florida. Impact of foreclosure alt=Outer door and window of a house with several paper notices taped to both of them The impact of foreclosure goes beyond just homeowners but also expands to towns and neighborhoods as a whole.

For any given time frame, foreclosures have a greater negative impact when they are closer to the property attempting to be sold. The conventional view suggested is that the increase in foreclosures will cause declines in the sales value of neighboring properties, which, in turn, will lead to an extension of the housing crisis.Rogers, W. H., & Winter, W. (2009). The Impact of Foreclosures on Neighboring Housing Sales. Journal of Real Estate Research, 31(4), 455-479. Another significant impact from increased foreclosure rates is on school mobility of children. In general, research suggests that switching schools is damaging for children, although this does significantly depend on the quality of the origin and destination schools. A study done in New York City revealed that students who changed schools most often entered a school with lower, on average, test scores and overall school performance. The effect of these moves on academic performance for individual students requires further research.Been, V., Ellen, I., Schwartz, A., Stiefel, L., & Weinstein, M. (2011).

Retrieved from proquest; fee required access Foreclosures also have an emotional and physical effect on people. In one particular study of 250 recruited participants who had experienced foreclosure, 36.7% met screening criteria for major depression. By country =Australia and New Zealand= Foreclosure has been prohibited by law in New Zealand for well over a century. Instead the mortgagee realises the security through sale, the exercise of the power of sale also being regulated by statute. In both of these countries statutory reform has altered the manner in which real property dealings are conducted. What is termed a \\"mortgage\\" is a legal interest that is registered against the fee simple title of the property. Since in both countries, the Torrens title system of land registration is used, being registered as proprietor or as a mortgagee creates an indefeasible interest (unless the acquisition of the registration was by land transfer fraud). The mortgagee therefore never holds the fee simple, and there is a statutory process for initiating and conducting a mortgagee sale in the event that the mortgagor defaults. In New Zealand, as in England, say, the land title database is now electronic so there are no paper \\"title documents\\". =Ireland= In Ireland, foreclosure has been abolished by the Land and Conveyancing Reform Act 2009 but Chapter 4 of Part 9 of the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009 provides for vesting orders that are equivalent to foreclosure but may only be used by NAMA. =People's Republic of China= Foreclosure in the People's Republic of China takes place as a form of debt enforcement proceedings under strict judicial foreclosure, which is only allowed by law of guarantee and law of property right. China amended the Constitution of the Peoples's Republic of China (adopted April 12, 1988), to allow transfer of land rights, from \\"granted land rights\\" to \\"allocated land rights\\" thus paving the way for private land ownership, allowing for the renting, leasing, and mortgage of land. The 1990 Regulations on Granting Land Use Rights dealt further with this followed by the Urban Real Estate Law (adopted July 5, 1994),Pacific Rim Law and Policy Journal; vol 8 no. 3 page 516 -Retrieved 2013-07-21 the \\"Security Law of the People's Republic of China\\" (adopted June 30, 1995), and then the \\"Urban Mortgage Measures\\" (issued May 9, 1997)Pacific Rim Law Policy Journal; vol 8 no.3 page 518 -Retrieved 2013-07-21 resulting in land privatization and mortgage lending practices. Mortgages and foreclosure Chinese law and mortgage practices have progressed with safeguards to prevent foreclosures as much as possible. These include mandatory secondary security, rescission (Chinese Contract Law), and maintaining accounts at the lending bank to cover any defaults without prior notice to the borrower.Pacific Rim Law Policy Journal; vol 8 No.3 page 558 -Retrieved 2013-07-20 A mortgagee may sue on a note without foreclosing, obtain a general judgment, and collect that judgment against other property of the mortgagor, without foreclosing. When all other avenues have failed a lender may seek a judgement of foreclosure. Under the \\"Civil Procedure Law\\", foreclosures should be finalized in a six-month time frame but this is dependent on several things including if the mortgager applies to the court for execution of the judgment.Pacific Rim Law Policy Journal; vol 8 No.3 page 564 Mortgages are formally foreclosed at auction by a licensed auction specialist.Pacific Rim Law and Policy Journal; vol 8 no. 3 page 568 (b) -Retrieved 2013-07-21 =Philippines= There are two modes of foreclosure in the Philippines. A mortgagee may foreclose either judicially or extrajudicially, as governed by Rule 68 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure and Act. No. 3135, respectively. A judicial foreclosure is done by filing a complaint in the Regional Trial Court of the place where the property is located. The judge renders judgment, ordering the mortgagor to pay the debt within a period of 90‚Äì120 days. If the debt is not paid within the said period, a foreclosure sale satisfies the judgment. In an extrajudicial foreclosure, the mortgagee need not initiate an action in court but may simply file an application before the Clerk of Court to secure attendance of the Sheriff who conducts the public sale. This is done pursuant to a power of sale. Note that these two modes specifically apply to real estate mortgages. Foreclosure of chattel mortgages (mortgage of movable property) are governed by Sec. 14 of Act No. 1506, which gives the mortgagee the right to sell the chattel at a public sale. It has also been held that as regards chattel mortgages, the law does not prohibit that the foreclosure sale be done privately if it is agreed upon by the parties. =Spain= Unlike in the United States, where a foreclosure means the end of the line, the foreclosure hearing in Spain is just the beginning of the homeowner's troubles. They will have to work for the bank for many years and will be unable to ever own anything‚Äîeven a car. Spanish mortgage holders are responsible for the full amount of the loan to the bank in addition to penalty interest charges, and court fees. Much of this can be attributed to Spain having the highest unemployment rate in the \\"euro zone\\". Unlike in the US, bankruptcy is not an adequate solution since mortgage debt is specifically excluded. Unlike other European countries, you cannot go to the courts for any sort of debt relief. There has been much contention over these policies in the Spanish Parliament but the government is convinced that keeping these policies will prevent Spanish banks from ever experiencing something similar to the US mayhem. With repossessed real estate properties on their books worth about ‚Ç¨100 billion the banks in Spain are eager to get rid of foreclosures. =South Africa= For a developing country, there is a high rate of foreclosures in South Africa because of the privatisation of housing delivery. One of the biggest opponents of foreclosures is the Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign which sees foreclosures as unconstitutional and a particular burden on vulnerable poor populations.Fighting Foreclosure in South Africa April 7, 2009 =Switzerland= In Switzerland, foreclosure takes place as a form of debt enforcement which is served by the overlord of debt (currently Lord Overton Sheraton) proceedings under Swiss insolvency law. =United Kingdom= In the United Kingdom, foreclosure is a little-used remedy which vests the property in the mortgagee with the mortgagor having neither the right to any surplus from the sale nor liability for any shortfall. Because this remedy can be harsh, courts almost never allow it especially if a large surplus is likely to be realised, furthermore when a substantial surplus is unlikely to be realised then mortgagees are disinclined to seek foreclosure in the first place since that remedy leaves them no recourse to recover a shortfall. Instead, the courts usually grant an order for possession and an order for sale, which both mitigates some of the harshness of the repossession by allowing the sale while allowing lenders further recourse to recover any balance owing following a sale. The United Kingdom foreclosure system is unique and true foreclosures are quite uncommon. More commonly, lenders pursue a process called mortgage possession (or alternatively, \\"repossession\\" in cases where the bank originally sold the property too). Both mortgage (re)possession and foreclosure are quite similar, with the main differences being the treatment of any funds that exceed the amount borrowed and liability for any shortfall. In the case of mortgage possession or repossession, if the home is sold or auctioned for a price that exceeds the loan balance, those funds are returned to the consumer. If the proceeds from a mortgage possession are insufficient to cover the loan then the debtor remains liable for the balance, although in most cases this will become an unsecured debt and the mortgage company will be treated on an equitable basis with the debtor's other unsecured creditors (particularly if the debtor simultaneously or subsequently becomes bankrupt or enters into a voluntary arrangement with creditors). By contrast, in the case of foreclosure the mortgage company retains all rights to proceeds from a sale or auction but the debtor is not liable for any shortfall. The UK foreclosure and mortgage possession/repossession system favors consumers over lenders, as the United Kingdom has some pre-action protocols in place. Mortgage companies are required to work with homeowners to arrive at a resolution and it is possible to delay court action (ultimately, enabling many to avoid the loss of their home) in situations where the borrower has enrolled in individual programs or if the borrower's income is about to improve significantly with a new job or other measures that would allow them to pay off the arrears. There is no precise parallel to an American short sale, although the UK does have a process known as Assisted Voluntary Sale. An Assisted Voluntary Sale does have some negative credit impact for the consumer, but the adverse effect is less pronounced than one might suffer if the case were to proceed to the courts.

Ministers are appointed by the Governor-General, on the advice of the Prime Minister, who is the leader of the cabinet. Cabinet meetings are strictly private and occur once a week where vital issues are discussed and policy formulated. The Cabinet is also composed of a number of Cabinet committees focused on governance and specific policy issues. Outside the Cabinet there is an Outer Ministry and also a number of Assistant Ministers (designated as Parliamentary Secretaries under the Ministers of State Act 1952), responsible for a specific policy area and reporting directly to a senior Cabinet minister of their portfolio. The Cabinet, the Outer Ministry, and the Assistant Ministers collectively form the full Commonwealth Ministry of the government of the day. As with the Prime Minister of Australia, the Constitution of Australia does not recognise the Cabinet as a legal entity; these roles actually exist solely by convention. Decisions of Cabinet do not in and of themselves have legal force. Instead, it convenes to function as a practical \\"foreshadowing\\" of the Business of the Federal Executive Council, which is, officially (as per the Constitution), Australia's highest formal governmental body established by Chapter II of the Constitution of Australia. In practice, the Federal Executive Council meets solely to endorse and give legal force to decisions already made by the Cabinet. All members of the Cabinet are members of the Executive Council. While the nominal presiding officer, the Governor-General almost never attends Executive Council meetings. A senior member of the Cabinet holds the office of Vice-President of the Executive Council and acts as presiding officer of the Executive Council in place of the Governor-General.  History  Until 1956 Cabinet comprised all ministers. The growth of the ministry in the 1940s and 1950s made this increasingly impractical, and in 1956 Liberal Prime Minister Robert Menzies created a two-tier ministry, with only senior ministers being members of Cabinet, while the other ministers are in the outer ministry. This practice has been continued by all governments since, with the exception of the Whitlam Government. When the non-Labor parties have been in power, the Prime Minister has advised the Governor-General on all Cabinet and ministerial appointments at his own discretion, although in practice he consults with senior colleagues in making appointments. When the Liberal Party and its predecessors (the Nationalist Party and the United Australia Party) have been in coalition with the National Party (or its predecessor the Country Party), the leader of the junior Coalition party has had the right to nominate his party's members of the Coalition ministry, and to be consulted by the Prime Minister on the allocation of their portfolios. When the Labor Party first held office under Chris Watson, Watson assumed the right to choose members of the Cabinet. In 1907, however, the party decided that future Labor Cabinets would be elected by members of the Parliamentary Labor Party, the Caucus, and this practice was followed until 2007. The Prime Minister retained the right to allocate portfolios. In practice, Labor Prime Ministers exercised a predominant influence over who was elected to Labor Cabinets, although leaders of party factions also exercised considerable influence. Under two-tier ministerial arrangements introduced in 1987, each senior or \\"portfolio\\" Minister was a member of the Cabinet. In 1996 this was modified by the Howard government, whereby two portfolio Ministers, one being the Attorney-General, were not members of Cabinet, and one portfolio had two Cabinet Ministers. In subsequent Howard Ministries, and the 2007 Rudd Labor Ministry, all portfolio Ministers were in the Cabinet. Before the 2007 election, Kevin Rudd announced that if Labor won the election he would dispense with this tradition and appoint the ministry himself. In fact, the Caucus rule requiring the election of ministers remains in place. At the first Caucus meeting after the election, Rudd announced the members of his chosen ministry, and the Caucus then elected them unopposed, thus preserving the outward form of Caucus election. Function  In a parliamentary context, the Cabinet is of little procedural consequence; its relationship to Parliament being similar to the relationship between the Ministry as a whole and Parliament. It is fundamentally an administrative mechanism to assist with the decision-making process of the Executive Government.  Composition  Members of both the House of Representatives and Senate are eligible to serve as ministers and parliamentary secretaries. A minister does not have to be a member of either house, but Section 64 of the Constitution of Australia requires the minister to become a member within three months. The Prime Minister and Treasurer are traditionally members of the House of Representatives, but the Constitution does not have such a requirement. As amended in 1987, the Minister of State Act 1952 permits up to 30 ministers. As members of one house cannot speak in the other, ministers in each house serve as representatives of colleagues in the other for answering questions and other procedures. every government since federation has had senators serve as ministers. The Senate typically provides one-quarter to one- third of the ministry. Some former senators and others have proposed that senators should not be eligible to serve as ministers, stating that doing so is inappropriate for members of a chamber that act as the states' house and a house of review and because governments are only responsible to the House of Representatives. John Uhr and Senator Baden Teague state that an advantage of senators serving in ministries is that the Senate can compel them to answer questions about the government. Since the introduction of the two-tier ministry, meetings of Cabinet are attended by members only, although other ministers may attend if an area of their portfolio is on the agenda. Cabinet meetings are chaired by the Prime Minister, and a senior public servant is present to write the minutes and record decisions.FAQ: Executive Government ‚Äì The Cabinet , Parliamentary Education Office. Since 1942, every member of the Cabinet has been a member of the Australian Labor Party, the Liberal Party of Australia, or the National Party of Australia.  Cabinet collective responsibility  The Australian Cabinet follows the traditions of the British parliamentary cabinet system, in following the principle of cabinet collective responsibility. While the Cabinet is responsible to parliament for making policy decisions, Cabinet discussions are confidential and are not disclosed to the public apart from the announcement of decisions. This secrecy is necessary to ensure that items of national security are not made public, and so that ministers can speak freely and disagree with each other during discussions. Ministers are bound by a principle of cabinet solidarity, meaning that once cabinet has made a decision, all ministers must publicly support and defend that decision, regardless of their personal views on the subject.Australia's system of government, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Cabinet documents are held separately from other documents and may be destroyed once no longer in use, or when a change of government occurs.Cabinet Handbook, 5th Edition , p32, Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.

Despite this, several filing cabinets containing classified documents were obtained by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation after they were sold at a government surplus auction. The documents, aspects of which were published in January 2018, reveal the inner workings of recent governments, and have been characterized by the ABC as the largest breach of cabinet security in the nation's history.

Current Cabinet   Shadow Cabinet  Led by the Leader of the Opposition, the Opposition in parliament appoints from its ranks a Shadow Cabinet to monitor government ministers and present itself as an alternative government. The portfolios of shadow ministers usually correspond with those of the government. When the Liberal and National parties are in Opposition, the Shadow Cabinet is appointed by the Leader of the Opposition in consultation with the Leader of the Nationals. When Labor has been in Opposition, the Caucus has elected the Shadow Ministry and the Leader has allocated portfolios. Smaller opposition parties often appoint spokespersons for Cabinet portfolios, but these are not referred to as a Shadow Cabinet.

Despite the population numbering only around 6 million, the Bugis are influential in the politics in modern Indonesia, and historically influential on the Malay peninsula and other parts of the archipelago where they have migrated, starting in the late seventeenth century. The third president of Indonesia, B.J. Habibie (1998‚Äì1999), and the former Vice President of Indonesia, Jusuf Kalla were Bugis, sixth Prime Minister, Najib Razak and current Prime Minister of Malaysia, Muhyiddin Yassin have Bugis ancestry. Although many Bugis people live in the large port cities of Makassar and Parepare, the majority are farmers who grow wet rice on the lowland plains to the north and west of the town of Maros. The name Bugis is an exonym which represents an older form of the name; (To) Ugi is the endonym. The Bugis people speak a distinct regional language in addition to Indonesian, called Basa Ugi, Bugis or Bugis. In reality, there are several dialects, some of which are sufficiently different from others to be considered separate languages. The Bugis language belongs to the South Sulawesi language group; other members include the Maksar language, Torajan, Mandar and Enrekang, each being a series of dialects.Mills, R.F. 1975.

Pictured accompanied by court ladies. =Origin= Homeland in Sulawesi, Indonesia The homeland of the Buginese is the area around Lake Tempe and Lake Sidenreng in the Walannae Depression in the southwest peninsula of Sulawesi. It was here that the ancestors of the present-day Bugis settled, probably in the mid- to late second millennium BC. The area is rich in fish and wildlife and the annual fluctuation of Lake Tempe (a reservoir lake for the Bila and Walannae rivers) allows speculative planting of wet rice, while the hills can be farmed by swidden or shifting cultivation, wet rice, gathering and hunting. Around AD 1200 the availability of prestigious imported goods including Chinese and Southeast Asian ceramics and Gujerati print-block textiles, coupled with newly discovered sources of iron ore in Luwu stimulated an agrarian revolution which expanded from the great lakes region into the lowland plains to the east, south and west of the Walennae depression. This led over the next 400 years to the development of the major kingdoms of South Sulawesi, and the social transformation of chiefly societies into hierarchical proto-states.Caldwell, I. 1995.

The conclusion in 1669 of a protracted civil war led to a diaspora of Bugis and their entry into the politics of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. The Bugis played an important role in defeating Jambi and had a huge influence in Sultanate of Johor. Apart from the Malays, another influential faction in Johor at that time was the Minangkabau. Both the Buginese and the Minangkabau realised how the death of Sultan Mahmud II had provided them with the chance to exert power in Johor. Under the leadership of Daeng Parani, the descendants of two families settled on the Linggi and Selangor rivers and became the power behind the Johor throne, with the creation of the office of the Yang Dipertuan Muda (Yam Tuan Muda), or Bugis underking. \\"History\\", Embassy of Malaysia, Seoul In northern Australia Long before European colonialists extended their influence into these waters, the Makassarese, the Bajau, and the Buginese built elegant, ocean-going schooners in which they plied the trade routes. Intrepid and doughty, they travelled as far east as the Aru Islands, off New Guinea, where they traded in the skins of birds of paradise and medicinal masoya bark, and to northern Australia, where they exchanged shells, birds'-nests and mother-of-pearl for knives and salt with Aboriginal tribes. The Buginese sailors left their mark and culture on an area of the northern Australian coast which stretches over two thousand kilometres from the Kimberley to the Gulf of Carpentaria. Throughout these parts of northern Australia, there is much evidence of a significant Bugis presence. Each year, the Bugis sailors would sail down on the northwestern monsoon in their wooden padewakang. They would stay in Australian waters for several months to trade and take trepang (or dried sea cucumber) before returning to Makassar on the dry season off shore winds. As Thomas Forrest wrote in A Voyage from Calcutta to the Mergui Archipelago (1792), S.78 ff., ‚ÄúThe Buggesses in general are a high-spirited people; they will not bear ill usage... They deserve the character given of Malays in general, by Monsieur Poivre, in his Travels of a Philosopher, 'fond of adventures, emigration, and capable of undertaking the most dangerous enterprizes'.‚Äù Lifestyle Bugis traditional clothing. Most present-day Buginese now earn their living as rice farmers, traders or fishermen. Women help with the agricultural cycle and work in the homes. Most Bugis people live in stilted houses, sometimes three meters (9 ft) or more off the ground, with plank walls and floors. Many of the marriages are still arranged by parents and ideally take place between cousins. The Bugis recognise a cousin up to the ninth degree. A newlywed couple often lives with the wife's family for the first few years of their marriage (matrilocal). The Bugis diet consists mainly of rice, maize, fish, chicken, vegetables, fruit and coffee. On festive occasions, goat is served as a special dish. It has been argued that the Bugis people recognise five separate genders. These are makkunrai and oroan√©, which are similar to cisgender male and female respectively, as well as calabai, calalai, and bissu, which are less easily comparable to Western ideas of gender. Religion A few west coast rulers converted to Christianity in the mid-16th century, but failure by the Portuguese at Malacca to provide priests meant that this did not last. In the early 17th century, the Minangkabau ulama, Dato Ri Bandang, Dato Ri Tiro, and Dato Ri Patimang spread Islam in South Sulawesi. The Bugis converted from indigenous animistic practices and beliefs to Islam. By 1611, all the Makasar and Bugis kingdoms had converted to Islam. According to Nurman Said 95% of the Bugis are Muslims. There are a small number of Bugis who do not take Islam as their religion. Some Bugis converted to Christianity by means of marriage but their number remained small. A Bugis community living in Amparita in the Sidenreng Rappang Regency remains in pre-Islamic belief and is called as Tolotang. Because most Bugis people are Muslims, the Hajj is seen as a prestige by them. In literature A settlement of Bugis people in the fictional country of Patusan plays a key role in Joseph Conrad's novel Lord Jim.

Early life  Bonnet was born in Bassillac, Dordogne, the son of a lawyer.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 98. He studied law and political science at the √âcole Libre des Sciences Politiques and Sorbonne.  Early career  He went to work as an auditeur at the Conseil d'√©tat. In 1911, he launched a political career after marrying Odette Pelletan, the granddaughter of Eugene Pelletan. Bonnet's wife, often known as Madame Soutien-Georges, ran a salon, and had great ambitions for her husband; one contemporary reported that Madame Bonnet was \\"so wildly ambitious for her husband that when a new ministry was being formed he was afraid to go home at night unless he had captured a post for himself.\\"Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 104. Many privately mocked Bonnet for the way in which his wife dominated him.May, Ernest Strange Victory, New York: Hill & Wang, 2000 page 160. The moniker \\"Madame Soutien-Georges\\" directed towards her was a French pun on the word for \\"brassiere\\" (soutien-gorge) and was both a reference to Madame Bonnet and to the size of her breasts. In 1914, Bonnet joined the French Army and in 1918 served as director of demobilization. During his service in World War I, Bonnet was a much-decorated soldier who won the Croix de guerre medal for bravery under fire.Young, Robert France and the Origins of the Second World War, New York: St. Martin's Press, 1996 page 146. In 1919, Bonnet served as a secretary to the French delegation at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 and wrote a book, Lettres √° un Bourgeois de 1914, that called for widespread social reforms. Bonnet served in the Chamber of Deputies from 1924 to 1928 and again from 1929 to 1940. He was appointed undersecretary of state in 1925, the first in a series of high ministerial positions throughout the 1920s and 1930s. During his time as in the Chamber, Bonnet was regarded as a leading expert in financial and economic matters. As a minister, Bonnet had a reputation for hard work, always being well prepared in parliamentary debates and excelling at political intrigue. In 1932, Bonnet headed the French delegation at the Lausanne Conference.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 99. During the Lausanne Conference, British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald, commenting on Bonnet's abilities, asked: \\"Why isn't he in the Cabinet?\\". In 1933, Bonnet was a prominent member of the French delegation to the London Conference, where he was a leading critic of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's actions during the conference.Morrison, Rodney \\"The London Monetary and Economic Conference of 1933: A Public Goods Analysis\\" American Journal of Economics and Sociology, Volume 52, Number. 3, July 1993 pages 312 & 314. In 1936, Bonnet emerged as the leader of 18 Radical deputies who objected to their party's participation in the Front Populaire. As a result, the French Premier L√©on Blum effectively exiled Bonnet in January 1937 by appointing him Ambassador to the United States, even though Bonnet did not speak English. Upon hearing of Bonnet's appointment, the American Ambassador to France, William Christian Bullitt, Jr. wrote to President Franklin D. Roosevelt about Bonnet: > I don't think you'll like him. He is extremely intelligent and competent on > economic and financial matters, but he's not a man of character. You may > remember that he led the French delegation to the London economic conference > where he led the attacks against you.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the > Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 page 254. Despite his short stay in the United States and his inability to speak English, Bonnet thereafter and for the rest of his life claimed to be an expert on all things American.Lacaze, Yvon \\"Daladier, Bonnet and the Decision- Making Process During the Munich Crisis, 1938\\" pages 215‚Äì233 from French Foreign and Defence Policy, 1918‚Äì1940 pages 224‚Äì225 On 28 June 1937, Bonnet returned to France when the Premier Camille Chautemps appointed him Finance Minister.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 page 251. Bonnet's first major act as Finance Minister was to oversee the devaluation of the franc (the second devaluation in less than nine months), with the value of the franc going from 110.8 francs per British pound to 147.20. The devaluation was forced on Bonnet by the fact that the 10 billion francs that had been set aside in September 1936 in a Currency Reserve Fund to defend the value of the franc following the devaluation of that year had been spent by the middle of 1937. As Finance Minister, Bonnet imposed sharp cuts in military spending.Frankstein, Robert \\"French Appeasement Policies\\" pages 236‚Äì245 from The Fascist Challenge and the Policy of Appeasement edited by Wolfgang Mommsen & Lothar Kettenacker, George Allen & Unwin: London, United Kingdom, 1983 pages 240‚Äì242. Bonnet felt that the costs of the arms race with Germany were such that it was better for France to reach an understanding that might end the arms race than continue to spend gargantuan sums on the military.Frankstein, Robert \\"French Appeasement Policies\\" pages 236‚Äì245 from The Fascist Challenge and the Policy of Appeasement edited by Wolfgang Mommsen & Lothar Kettenacker, George Allen & Unwin: London, United Kingdom, 1983 page 240. Besides for the economic problems associated with budgetary stability and his attempts to maintain the value of the franc against currency speculation, Bonnet was concerned with the social conflict caused by the need for increased taxation and decreased social services to pay for arms.Frankstein, Robert \\"French Appeasement Policies\\" pages 236‚Äì245 from The Fascist Challenge and the Policy of Appeasement edited by Wolfgang Mommsen & Lothar Kettenacker, George Allen & Unwin: London, United Kingdom, 1983 pages 242‚Äì244. In a meeting with Franz von Papen, the German Ambassador to Austria, in November 1937, Bonnet and Chautemps expressed the hope that an understanding might be reached in which France might accept Central and Eastern Europe as Germany's sphere of influence in return for German acceptance of Western Europe as France's sphere of influence.Frankstein, Robert \\"French Appeasement Policies\\" pages 236‚Äì245 from The Fascist Challenge and the Policy of Appeasement edited by Wolfgang Mommsen & Lothar Kettenacker, George Allen & Unwin: London, United Kingdom, 1983 page 241. Moreover, Bonnet became the leading spokesman within the French Cabinet for the idea that the French alliance system in Eastern Europe, the so-called cordon sanitaire, was a net liability that only served to embroil France in conflicts with Germany.Frankstein, Robert \\"French Appeasement Policies\\" pages 236‚Äì245 from The Fascist Challenge and the Policy of Appeasement edited by Wolfgang Mommsen & Lothar Lettenacke, George Allen & Unwin: London, United Kingdom, 1983 page 240. Throughout his career, Bonnet was noted as an advocate of \\"sacred egoism\\" and that France must do what helped French interests over any other country's.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 page 272. Bonnet regarded himself as a \\"realist\\", and his thinking on foreign policy tended to be colored in equal measure by pragmatism and insularity.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road to War, London: Macmillan, 1989 page 130. Bonnet's cuts in military spending led to a clash with War Minister √âdouard Daladier. Daladier persuaded the Cabinet to rescind the most severe cuts to the French Army budget, pointing out that in the current international climate, the Army needed more funding, not less.Frankstein, Robert \\"French Appeasement Policies\\" pages 236‚Äì245 from The Fascist Challenge and the Policy of Appeasement edited by Wolfgang Mommsen & Lothar Lettenacke, George Allen & Unwin: London, United Kingdom, 1983 pages 241‚Äì242. Since the Ministers of the Air and the Marine were not as substantial personalities as Daladier, the French Navy and French Air Force were not able to reverse the Finance Minister's cuts.Frankstein, Robert \\"French Appeasement Policies\\" pages 236‚Äì245 from The Fascist Challenge and the Policy of Appeasement edited by Wolfgang Mommsen & Lothar Lettenacke, George Allen & Unwin: London, United Kingdom, 1983 page 242. In January 1938, following the fall of Chautemps's government, Bonnet made a serious effort to form a new government, but in the end, had to content himself with being appointed Minister of State.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 99‚Äì100.  Foreign Minister, 1938‚Äì1939  = Before the May Crisis = In April 1938, following the fall of the second Blum government, Bonnet was appointed Foreign Minister under Daladier as Premier (despite their quarrel in 1937, they had reconciled). Bonnet was a staunch supporter of the Munich Agreement in 1938 and was firmly opposed to taking military action against German expansion; for the most part, he preferred to follow a course of appeasement. In 1938‚Äì1939, there were three factions within the French government. One, led by Bonnet, felt that France could not afford an arms race with Nazi Germany and sought a d√©tente with the Reich.Frankenstein, Robert \\"The Decline of France and French Appeasement Policies, 1936-9\\" pages 236‚Äì245 from The Fascist Challenge and the Policy of Appeasement edited by Wolfgang Mommsen and Lothar Kettenacker, George Allen & Unwin, London, United Kingdom, 1983 pages 240‚Äì243.Jackson, Peter \\"Intelligence and the End of Appeasement\\" pages 234‚Äì260 from French Foreign and Defence Policy, 1918‚Äì1940 The Decline and Fall of A Great Power edited by Robert Boyce, London, United Kingdom: Routledge, 1998 page 246. As an expert in financial matters and a former Finance minister, Bonnet was acutely aware of the damages inflicted by the arms race on an economy already weakened by the Great Depression. A second faction, led by Paul Reynaud, Jean Zay, and Georges Mandel, favored a policy of resistance to German expansionism. A third faction, led by Daladier, stood halfway between the other two and favored appeasement of Germany to buy time to re-arm. Daladier thus left foreign policy largely to Bonnet as the best way of avoiding a war with Germany in 1938.Lacaze, Yvon \\"Daladier, Bonnet and the Decision-Making Process During the Munich Crisis, 1938\\" pages 215‚Äì233 from French Foreign and Defence Policy, 1918‚Äì1940 The Decline and Fall of A Great Power page 225. In addition, Daladier felt that the best way of watching Bonnet was to include him in the Cabinet: he wished to keep the Popular Front, but Bonnet wanted it to end.Lacaze, Yvon \\"Daladier, Bonnet and the Decision-Making Process During the Munich Crisis, 1938\\" pages 215‚Äì233 from French Foreign and Defence Policy, 1918‚Äì1940 The Decline and Fall of A Great Power pages 224‚Äì225. Daladier's thought if Bonnet were outside of the Cabinet, his ability to engage in intrigues to break up the Popular Front and seize the Premiership for himself would be correspondingly increased; including him in the Cabinet limited his room to manoeuvre. An additional complication in the Daladier-Bonnet relationship was posed by Bonnet's desire for the premiership, which gradually led to a breakdown with his once warm relations with Daladier.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 109‚Äì110. Bonnet was extremely critical of what he regarded as the \\"warmongers\\" of the Quai d'Orsay, and from the very beginning of his time as foreign minister, he tended to exclude his senior officials from the decision-making progress, preferring instead to concentrate authority in his own hands.Lacaze, Yvon \\"Daladier, Bonnet and the Decision-Making Process During the Munich Crisis, 1938\\" pages 215‚Äì233 from French Foreign and Defence Policy, 1918‚Äì1940 The Decline and Fall of A Great Power page 224. In Bonnet's opinion, the French-Czechoslovakian treaty of 1924, which committed France to come to the aid of CzechoSlovakia in the event of a German invasion, was a millstone that could lead France into a disastrous war with Germany.May, Ernest Strange Victory, New York: Hill & Wang, 2000 page 161 Bonnet believed that the best course for France in 1938 was to pressure the Czechoslovak government into conceding to German demands and so prevent a Franco-German war. If the Czechoslovaks refused to make concessions, that refusal could be used as an excuse for ending the Franco-Czechoslovak alliance. While pursuing this course, Bonnet kept uninformed not only his senior officials at the Quai d'Orsay, but also sometimes even Daladier himself. This led the Premier to rebuke his Foreign Minister several times for behaving as if French foreign policy was made by \\"one minister\\".May, Ernest Strange Victory, New York: Hill & Wang, 2000 pages 162‚Äì163 Between 27 and 29 April 1938, Bonnet visited London with Daladier for meetings with Neville Chamberlain and Lord Halifax to discuss the possibility of a German-Czechoslovak war breaking out, and what the two governments could do to stop such a war. During the talks, the French ministers argued for firm declarations that both nations would go to war in the event of a German aggression and agreed to a British suggestion that the two nations pressure Prague into making concessions to the Sudeten Heimfront of Konrad Henlein. The London summit marked the beginning of a pattern that was to last throughout 1938, where the French would begin talks with the British by demanding a harder line against the Reich, and then agree to follow the British line.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 180. In the view of Bonnet and Daladier, these tactics allowed them to carry out their foreign policy goals while providing them with a cover from domestic critics by presenting their foreign policy as the result of British pressure.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 180; Young, Robert France and the Origins of the Second World War, New York: St. Martin's Press, 1996 page 58. As Bonnet told the American Ambassador William Christian Bullitt, Jr., his \\"whole policy was based on allowing the British full latitude to work out the dispute\\" because otherwise, France would have to bear the main responsibility for pressuring concessions on Czechoslovakia. Throughout summer 1938, Bonnet allowed most of the diplomatic pressure applied to President Edvard Bene≈° for concessions to Henlein to come from London. This led to sharp complaints from the British that Bonnet should do more to apply pressure on Bene≈°.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 189 & 194. Between 9 and 14 May 1938, Bonnet attended the meeting of the League Council of the League of Nations in Geneva, Switzerland.Weinberg, Gerhard The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany Starting World War II, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980 page 363. During the meeting, Bonnet met with the Soviet Foreign Commissar Maxim Litvinov, who offered vague and evasive answers to Bonnet's questions about what the Soviet Union proposed to do in the event of a German attack on Czechoslovakia. At the same time, Bonnet was informed by the Polish and Romanian delegations that if Germany invaded Czechoslovakia, they would refuse the Red Army transit rights to Czechoslovakia's aid and that any Soviet violation of their neutrality would be resisted with force.Weinberg, Gerhard The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany Starting World War II, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980 pages 363‚Äì364. After the League meeting, Bonnet met with Lord Halifax in Paris, where he urged Halifax to \\"work as hard as he could for a settlement in Czechoslovakia so that the French would not be faced with a crisis which they definitely did not want to face\\".Weinberg, Gerhard The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany Starting World War II, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980 page 364. As Halifax reported to the British Cabinet, Bonnet: \\"wanted His Majesty's Government to put as much pressure as possible on Dr. Bene≈° to reach a settlement with the Sudeten-Deutsch in order to save France from the cruel dilemma between dishonouring her agreement [the Franco-Czechoslovak alliance of 1924] or becoming involved in war\\". = May Crisis = During the May Crisis of 1938, on 21 May, Bonnet advised Lord Halifax that Britain should warn Berlin that if the Germans attacked Czechoslovakia, then Britain would become involved in the ensuing war, only to be informed that London had already delivered such a warning.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 190. In a talk with the British Ambassador, Sir Eric Phipps, Bonnet attacked Bene≈° for ordering Czechoslovak mobilization without informing France first and criticized Prague's for its \\"hasty action\\", but at a meeting with the Czechoslovak Minister to Paris, ≈†tefan Osusk√Ω, on 21 May, Bonnet did not criticize Prague in violation of his promises to Phipps. Phipps urged Bonnet to use the crisis as an excuse to renounce the Franco-Czechoslovak alliance of 1924, but Bonnet refused unless France could secure a stronger commitment from Britain to come to France's aid in the event of war with Germany. During the crisis, Bonnet issued a cautiously-worded press statement supporting Prague, but refused to issue a d√©marche in Berlin.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 191. At a subsequent meeting with Phipps on 22 May, Bonnet was informed not to interpret the British warnings to Berlin during the May Crisis as a blank cheque for British support for either Czechoslovakia or France. Bonnet took \\"copious notes\\" on the British message and stated: \\"if Czechoslovakia were really unreasonable, the French Government might well declare that France considered herself released from her bond\\". On 25 May 1938, Bonnet told the German Ambassador to France, Count Johannes von Welczeck, that France would honour her alliance with Czechoslovakia should Germany invade that nation and highlighted his main foreign policy goals when he declared: \\"if the problem of the minorities in Czechoslovakia was settled peacefully, economic and disarmament problems might be considered\\". On 31 May 1938, Bonnet refused a British request for an Anglo-French d√©marche to Bene≈° demanding concessions to the Sudeten German Heimfront, but promised to commit the French Minister in Prague, Victor de Lacroix, to do more to pressure the Czechoslovaks. In his instructions to Lacroix for the d√©marche, Bonnet instead merely asked for more information and stated: \\"The information that you have transmitted to me on the state of the negotiations between the Prime Minister and the representatives of the Sudetens does not allow me to pronounce as fully as the British Government believes itself able to do on the character and substance of M. Henlein's proposals.... I ask you, therefore to obtain urgently the necessary details on the proposals submitted to M. Hod≈æa....\\"Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 192. The British discovery of Bonnet's instructions, which Lacroix inadvertently revealed to the British Minister in Prague, Sir Basil Newton, led to much Anglo-French recrimination. = To Munich = Bonnet was the leading voice for appeasement in France. He was a \\"munichois\\"‚Äîthat is, a defeatist and pacifist.Daniel Hucker, \\"Public Opinion between Munich and Prague: The View from the French Embassy.\\" Contemporary British History 25.3 (2011): 407‚Äì427. Throughout the spring and early summer of 1938, Bonnet refused to apply pressure through official channels and instead used unofficial emissaries to carry the message that France might not go to war in the event of a German invasion, leading Prague to place more assurance on French statements of public support that was warranted.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 194. Bonnet had his friend, the journalist Jules Saurerwein, tell Bene≈° in an interview,:\\"Victory is not a state that endures forever\\".Lacaze, Yvon \\"Daladier, Bonnet and the Decision-Making Process During the Munich Crisis, 1938\\" pages 215‚Äì233 from French Foreign and Defence Policy, 1918‚Äì1940 The Decline and Fall of A Great Power page 217. Not until 17 July 1938 did Bonnet issue a set of instructions to Lacroix, which explicitly warned Bene≈° and his Prime Minister, Milan Hod≈æa that because of the attitude of the British, France could not risk a war in 1938, and Prague should do its utmost to reach a settlement with Germany.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 197. Starting with the May Crisis, Bonnet began a campaign of lobbying the United States to become involved in European affairs, asking that Washington inform Prague that in the event of a German-Czechoslovak war the \\"Czech government would not have the sympathy of the American government if it should not attempt seriously to produce a peaceful solution... by making concessions to the Sudeten Germans which would satisfy Hitler and Henlein\\".Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 208. In a meeting with the American Ambassador William Christian Bullitt, Jr. on 16 May 1938, Bonnet stated his belief that another war with Germany would be more dreadful then any previous war and that Bonnet \\"would fight to the limit against the involvement of France in the war\\".Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 209. As part of his effort to gain Bullitt's trust, Bonnet showed the American notes received from the British government during the May crisis.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 177. In a radio broadcast sent directly to the United States on 4 July 1938, Bonnet proclaimed his belief in the \\"common ideals\\" that linked France and the United States as a way of pressuring for greater American interest in the crisis in Central Europe. In June 1938, there was a major dispute between Daladier and Bonnet over the question of continuing French arms shipments to the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War. The Italian intervention in the Spanish Civil War had created a major strategic problem for French policy-makers. Because of Germany's greater population, it was considered crucial in France to tap the vast manpower of North Africa to compensate for it. This strategy required French control of the western Mediterranean to ensure that no inference would be possible with troop convoys from Algeria to Marseilles. As a result of the Italian intervention in Spain's civil war, a number of Italian bases had been set up in the strategic Balearic Islands. It was widely feared in France that the Italians would at least receive permission from the Spanish Nationalists to make their presence in the Balerics permanent or even would ask for and receive the cession of the Balearics. The prospect of a Franco-German war breaking out with the Italians siding with the latter and using the Balearics to make naval and air attacks on French troop convoys was considered to be highly undesirable by French decision-makers and a major objective of French foreign policy in the late 1930s was to remove the Italians from the Balearics. Daladier was in favor of continuing arms shipments to the Spanish Republicans as long as the Italian forces were in Spain, but Bonnet argued for ending arms supplies as a way of improving relations with Italy and even told the British Ambassador, Sir Eric Phipps, that his country should \\"lay great stress with Daladier on the importance to the Pyrenees frontier remaining closed\\".Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 188 It was Bonnet's hope that ending arms supplies for the Spanish Republic would be reciprocated by a total Italian withdraw from all Spanish territory, especially the Balearics. Bonnet was successful in having the frontier closed. Following reports from General Joseph Vuillemin of the French Air Force after a visit to Germany about the strength of the Luftwaffe, and a memo from Andr√© Fran√ßois-Poncet, the French Ambassador to Germany, on 18 August 1938 stating it was quite likely that Adolf Hitler planned to attack Czechoslovakia sometime soon, Bonnet began quite insistent that a joint Anglo- French warning be sent to Berlin against plans to invade Czechoslovakia. On 22 August 1938, Bonnet had Charles Corbin, the French Ambassador in London, press for an explicit British commitment to come to France's side in the event of war breaking out in Central Europe and used the ensuing British refusal as a reason to justify France's lack of intervention in a German-Czechoslovak conflict.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 202‚Äì203 Starting in August 1938, Bonnet started to become hostile towards what he felt was Daladier's excessive belligerence and lack of willingness to compromise with the Germans and often urged in private that Daladier change his stance. In early September 1938, as part of his effort to prevent war through a mixture of threat and conciliation, Bonnet had a series of meetings with Count Welczeck, telling him that France would honor the terms of the Franco-Czechoslovak treaty should the Germans invade Czechoslovakia, while insisting that his government was quite open to a compromise solution.Lacaze, Yvon \\"Daladier, Bonnet and the Decision- Making Process During the Munich Crisis, 1938\\" pages 215‚Äì233 from French Foreign and Defence Policy, 1918‚Äì1940 The Decline and Fall of A Great Power page 218. During a speech delivered on 4 September 1938 at the unveiling of a commemorative plaque at Pointe de Grave honoring La Fayette's's departure to America in 1777 and the arrival of the American Expeditionary Force in 1917, Bonnet stated in obliquely that France would go to war if Germany attacked Czechoslovakia and expressed the hope that the US would fight on France's side. During the same ceremony, Ambassador Bullitt stated that \\"France and the United States were united in war and peace\\", leading to a storm of criticism by American isolationists and a statement from President Franklin D. Roosevelt that it was \\"100 per cent wrong\\" the U.S. would join a \\"stop-Hitler bloc\\". Roosevelt's statement had the effect of confirming Bonnet in his course of seeking to avoid a war with Germany.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 209‚Äì210. In addition, a highly exaggerated estimate of the strength of the Luftwaffe presented by Charles Lindbergh in August 1938, supplemented by a highly negative assessment of the ability of the Arm√©e de l'Air by the Air Force's General Joseph Vuillemin to survive a war had the effect of reinforcing Bonnet's determination to avoid a war with Germany.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 240‚Äì242. When it appeared quite likely in mid-September 1938 that war could break out at any moment in Central Europe following Hitler's violent speech blasting Czechoslovakia on 12 September and a failed revolt in the Sudetenland, Bonnet become quite frantic in his efforts to save the peace.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 210 Bonnet told Phipps: \\"I repeated all this with emotion to Sir Eric Phipps telling him that at no price should we allow ourselves to be involved in war without having weighted all the consequences and without having measured in particular the state of our military forces\\". On 14 September, Bonnet told Phipps: \\"We cannot sacrifice ten million men in order to prevent three and half million Sudetens joining the Reich\\".Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 211 Bonnet went on to advocate as his preferred solution to the crisis the neutralization of Czechoslovakia with wide-ranging autonomy for the Sudetenland, but he was prepared as a \\"last resort\\" to accept a plebiscite on the Sudetenlanders joining Germany. During the same speech, Bonnet \\"expressed great indignation with the Czechs who, it seems, mean to mobilise without consulting the French... he has therefore given a broad hint to Bene≈° that France may have to reconsider her obligations\\", and that \\"we are not ready for war and we must therefore make the most far-reaching concessions to the Sudetens and to Germany\\". At a summit meeting in London with the leading British ministers on 18 September, Bonnet and Daladier agreed formally to the idea of ceding the Sudetenland to Germany, but pressed strongly as the price for making such a concession, a British guarantee of the remainder of Czechoslovakia.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 213‚Äì214 On his return to Paris, in a meeting with ≈†tefan Osusk√Ω, Bonnet was very vehement for Prague to agree to the Anglo-French plan agreed to in London at once.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 215 In a letter to Daladier on 24 September 1938, Bonnet wrote, \\"If France declared war against Germany, her position would be weaker than at any time since 1919. In fact, France in this case would have to stand alone on land the force of the combined German and Italian armies, without counting Japan, which in the Far East, will doubtless attack Indo-China.... For five months, night and day, in the course of our confident collaboration, we have struggled for peace. I beg you to continue in this course. It is the only one which can save the country....\\"Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 221 At the same time, Bonnet's relations with Ren√© Massigli, the Quai d'Orsay's Political Director, began to deteriorate quite rapidly as Massigli felt that Bonnet was too anxious to avoid a war at any price.Lacaze, Yvon \\"Daladier, Bonnet and the Decision-Making Process During the Munich Crisis, 1938\\", p. 215‚Äì233 from French Foreign and Defence Policy, 1918‚Äì1940 The Decline and Fall of A Great Power page 227. On 25 September 1938, Daladier and Bonnet returned to London for another set of meetings with British leaders; during this summit, Bonnet said almost nothing.Lacaze, Yvon \\"Daladier, Bonnet and the Decision-Making Process During the Munich Crisis, 1938\\" pages 215‚Äì233 from French Foreign and Defence Policy, 1918‚Äì1940 The Decline and Fall of A Great Power page 220. When Britain rejected Hitler's Bad Godesberg ultimatum on 26 September, Bonnet sought to prevent the news of the British rejection appearing in the French press, as it now appeared that British were pushing the French towards war, and deprived Bonnet of using British pressure as an excuse.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 220‚Äì221 As the crisis reached its climax in late September 1938, Bonnet called upon his peace lobby, a collection of various politicians, journalists and industrialists to pressure the Cabinet against going to war for Czechoslovakia.Lacaze, Yvon \\"Daladier, Bonnet and the Decision-Making Process During the Munich Crisis, 1938\\" pages 215‚Äì233 from French Foreign and Defence Policy, 1918‚Äì1940 The Decline and Fall of A Great Power pages 225‚Äì226. Some of the prominent members of Bonnet's \\"peace lobby\\" were the politicians' Jean Mistler, Henri B√©renger, Jean Montigny, Anatole de Monzie, Fran√ßois Pi√©tri, Lucien Lamoureux, Joseph Caillaux, the industrialist Marcel Boussac, and the journalists Jacques Sauerwein, Emile Roche, L√©on Bass√©e, and Emmanuel Berl. Together with Bonnet, the peace lobby sought to influence the government both within the corridors of power and by appealing to public opinion.Lacaze, Yvon \\"Daladier, Bonnet and the Decision-Making Process During the Munich Crisis, 1938\\" pages 215‚Äì233 from French Foreign and Defence Policy, 1918‚Äì1940 The Decline and Fall of A Great Power page 226. In this regard, Bonnet especially valued the contribution of his close friend Bass√©e, who served as the political director of the Havas news agency. Another unofficial member of the \\"peace lobby\\" was Phipps, whose dispatches to London often reflected Bonnet's influence. The most celebrated of Phipps's dispatches was a message on 24 September 1938 which claimed that \\"all that is best in France is against war, almost at any price\\" and that they were opposed by a \\"small, but noisy and corrupt, war group\\". In the aftermath of the British rejection of the Bad Godesberg ultimatum, Daladier stated at a Cabinet meeting that if Hitler persisted with the terms of the ultimatum, France \\"intended to go to war\\".Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road to War, London: Macmillan, 1989 page 132. At a Cabinet meeting on 27 September, Bonnet spoke out against French mobilization and threatened to resign if the Cabinet were to order such a step.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 222 The atmosphere at the Cabinet meeting was very tense as Daladier insisted upon mobilization; this led to many heated words between the Premier and his Foreign Minister.Lacaze, Yvon \\"Daladier, Bonnet and the Decision-Making Process During the Munich Crisis, 1938\\" pages 215‚Äì233 from French Foreign and Defence Policy, 1918‚Äì1940 The Decline and Fall of A Great Power pages 221. = Munich = The crisis was suddenly averted on 29 September, when Chamberlain announced that he had received an invitation from Benito Mussolini for a four- power conference to be held on 30 September in Munich to settle the crisis. Bonnet was very much in favor of the Munich conference of 30 September, which averted the war Bonnet opposed, but he was not part of the French delegation to it.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 224 After the Munich Conference, Bonnet visited his hometown of P√©rigueux, where he was greeted with a deluge of flowers and shouts of \\"Vive Bonnet!\\" and \\"Merci Bonnet!\\"Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road to War, London: Macmillan, 1989 page 133. = 1938 after Munich = Relations between Bonnet and his officials at the Quai d'Orsay, especially Ren√© Massigli were very poor, leading to Bonnet to condemn Massigli quite strongly in his memoirs.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 149 In turn, Massigli was to accuse Bonnet of seeking to alter the documentary record in his favor.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 142 In the aftermath of Munich, relations between Bonnet and Massigli, which were poor to begin with, declined even further. On 24 October 1938, Bonnet had Massigli sacked as the Quai d'Orsay's Political Director and exiled him by having him serve as Ambassador to Turkey.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 page 316. Massiglii first learnt of his sacking by reading his morning newspaper.May, Ernest Strange Victory, New York: Hill & Wang, 2000 page 179. On the same day that Massigli was exiled, Pierre Comert, the Director of the Quai d'Orsay's Press Service, whose news releases during the Czechoslovak crisis were not in accord with the line that Bonnet wanted to hear, was sent off to the American department.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 page 73. Bonnet had also wanted to sack the Quai d'Orsay's Secretary-General Alexis Saint-Leg√©r L√©ger and replace him with a man more in tune with Bonnet's views, but Saint-Leg√©r L√©ger's increasing friendship with Daladier served to protect him. A popular legend has it that Saint-Leg√©r L√©ger was not fired because he knew too much about stock market speculations that Bonnet was alleged to have engaged in during the war crisis of September 1938, but there is no evidence to support this story.May, Ernest Strange Victroy, New York: Hill & Wang, 2000 page 179. In the aftermath of the purge, Bonnet was congratulated by Phipps for removing the \\"warmongers\\" Massigli and Comert from the Quai d'Orsay, but Phipps went on to complain that Saint-Leg√©r L√©ger should have been sacked as well. In response, Bonnet claimed that he and Saint-Leg√©r L√©ger saw \\"eye to eye\\", leading to Phipps, who knew about the true state of relations between the two to remark drily, \\"in that case the eyes must be astigmatic\\". On 2 October 1938, the Royal Marine General Sir Maurice Hankey wrote in his diary about the recent visit to Paris by Sir Winston Churchill and Sir Edward Spears to contact anti-appeasement politicians in France: \\"Winston Churchill's sudden visit to France by aeroplane, accompanied by General Spears, and his visit only to the members of the French government like Mandel, who is opposed to the policy of peace, was most improper-Bonnet, the French Foreign Minister has complained about it, asking what we would say if our prominent French statesmen did the same: he has also protested against being rung up by Churchill and Spears from London for information\\".Kersaudy, Fran√ßois Churchill and de Gaulle, Saddle Brook: Stratford Press, 1981 page 32 On 19 October 1938, at the last meeting between the French Ambassador to Germany Andr√© Fran√ßois-Poncet and Adolf Hitler, the former had suggested to the latter that a Franco-German Declaration of Friendship might offer a way of improving relations between the two countries and avoiding a repeat of the crisis of September 1938. When Fran√ßois-Poncet reported to Paris Hitler's favorable attitude towards such a declaration, and his willingness to send his Foreign Minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop, to Paris to sign the proposed declaration, Bonnet enthusiastically embraced the idea. Bonnet felt that such a declaration might open the way for a series of economic and cultural agreements that would end forever the prospect of another Franco-German war. Bonnet was also jealous over the Anglo-German Declaration of 30 September that Chamberlain had forced upon Hitler after the Munich Conference and wanted his own declaration.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 page 72. In October 1938, the French opened secret talks with the Americans to start buying American aircraft to make up productivity deficiencies in the French aircraft industry.Keylor, William \\"France and the Illusion of American Support, 1919‚Äì1940\\" pages 204‚Äì244 from The French Defeat of 1940 Reassessments edited by Joel Blatt Berghahn Books: Providence 1998 pages 234‚Äì235 Daladier commented that \\"If I had three or four thousand aircraft Munich would never have happened\\".Keylor, William \\"France and the Illusion of American Support, 1919‚Äì1940\\" pages 204‚Äì244 from The French Defeat of 1940 Reassessments edited by Joel Blatt Berghahn Books: Providence 1998 page 234 Major problems in the Franco-American talks were the issue of how the French were to pay for the American planes and the implications of American neutrality acts.Keylor, William, \\"France and the Illusion of American Support, 1919‚Äì1940\\" pages 204‚Äì244 from The French Defeat of 1940 Reassessments edited by Joel Blatt Berghahn Books: Providence 1998 pages 235‚Äì236 In addition, the American Johnson Act forbade loans to nations that had defaulted on their debts.Keylor, William \\"France and the Illusion of American Support, 1919‚Äì1940\\" pages 204‚Äì244 from The French Defeat of 1940 Reassessments edited by Joel Blatt Berghahn Books: Providence 1998 page 237 In February 1939, the French offered to cede their possessions in the Caribbean and the Pacific together with a lump sum payment of ten billion francs.Keylor, William \\"France and the Illusion of American Support, 1919‚Äì1940\\" pages 204‚Äì244 from The French Defeat of 1940 Reassessments edited by Joel Blatt Berghahn Books: Providence 1998 page 238 Throughout his career, Bonnet was widely respected for his intelligence but often inspired great mistrust in others, in part because of his highly secretive methods of working and his preference for verbal as opposed to written instructions.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 pages 74‚Äì75; Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 103 & 141‚Äì142 During his time as Foreign Minister, Bonnet was distrusted by the British, Daladier and senior officials in the Quai d'Orsay, all of whom suspected that he was in some way not quite being honest with them. Neville Chamberlain described Bonnet as \\"clever, but ambitious and an intriguer\\".Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 102 Georges Mandel said: \\"His long nose sniffs danger and responsibility from afar. He will hide under any flat stone to avoid it\\".Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 103 The French columnist Andr√© G√©raud, who wrote under the pen-name Pertinax, stated that Bonnet pursued only the line \\"of least resistance\\". Sir Winston Churchill described him as \\"the quintessence of defeatism\\". In December 1938, Lord Halifax's private secretary Oliver Harvey referred to Bonnet as \\"a public danger to his own country and to ours\\". In December 1939, the British Chief Diplomatic Advisor Robert Vansittart wrote: \\"As to M. Bonnet he had better trust to time and oblivion rather than to coloured self-defence. He did a lot of really dirty work in 1938... if I ever had to play cards with M. Bonnet again I would always run through the pack first, just to make sure that the joker had been duly removed\\". And throughout Berlin Diary the author William L. Shirer referred to him as \\"the insufferable Georges Bonnet\\". Others were more sympathetic to Bonnet. Lord Halifax wrote in response to Vansittart's memo that: \\"I am disposed to think but I know it is a minority view that M. Bonnet is not so black (or so yellow) as he is often painted\\". Joseph Paul-Boncour, a political opponent of Bonnet's, spoke of his great \\"kindness and help\\".Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 104 The editor of the Le Petit Parisien, √âlie J. Bois, felt that Bonnet had \\"the makings of a good, perhaps a great, foreign minister\\". On another occasion, Bois, who disliked Bonnet, wrote of Bonnet's \\"features... instinct with... the intelligence of a fox on the alert\\". Bonnet's friend, Anatole de Monzie, commented: \\"Whilst very courageous in the long run, he is much less so in the heat of the moment.... Because he is reticent, he is accused of lying or of deceit. False accusation.... Bonnet is discreet so that his policy may be successful.... There is in him an obvious ability, an excessive flexibility. He jumps too quickly, on to the bandwagon, on to all bandwagons. What does it matter to me?... If he aims for the goal and means to reach it by devious means, I care only for the goal. Now I note that having adopted the peace party, he is sticking to it with all the foresight of a statesman\\". The French historian Yvon Lacaze has argued against the popular image of Bonnet as a slick and amoral opportunist, and instead attributes Bonnet's views about avoiding another war with Germany to his memories of service in the trenches of World War I. On 30 November 1938, there were \\"spontaneous\\" demonstrations in the Italian Chamber of Deputies organized by Benito Mussolini and his Foreign Minister, Count Galeazzo Ciano, who demanded that France cede Tunisia, Corsica and French Somaliland to Italy.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 page 323. In response, Bonnet sent out a message to Andr√© Fran√ßois-Poncet, now the French Ambassador in Rome, to inform him that he should see Count Ciano to complain:\\"Such behavior may appear rather unusual in the presence of the French Ambassador and immediately following the unconditional recognition of the Italian Empire\\", referring to the annexation of Ethiopia. In the fall of 1938, Bonnet started to advocate the ending of the French alliance system in Eastern Europe and ordered his officials at the Quai d'Orsay to start preparing grounds for renouncing the French treaties with the Soviet Union and Poland.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 265‚Äì266. Speaking before the Foreign Affairs Commission on the Chamber of Deputies in October 1938, Bonnet spoke of his desire to \\"restructure\\" the French alliance system in Eastern Europe and of his wish to \\"renegotiate\\" treaties which might bring France into a war \\"when French security is not directly threatened\\".Jackson, Peter \\"Intelligence and the End of Appeasement\\" pages 234‚Äì260 from French Foreign and Defence Policy, 1918‚Äì1940 edited by Robert Boyce, London, United Kingdom: Routledge, 1998 page 244. In his efforts to end the eastern alliances, Bonnet found his hands tied by opposition from other members of the French government. As he noted during talks in October with a group of Deputies who had formally asked the Foreign Minister to end French commitments in Eastern Europe: \\"If I was free, I would carry out your policy; but I am not: I would have against me the majority of the Cabinet, led by Reynaud and Mandel, and I cannot count on Daladier, for Gamelin believes that in the event of war Polish military assistance would be indispensable\\".Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 266. As part of his general tendency towards seeking to weaken the French eastern alliances, Bonnet did his best to put off giving the international guarantee to Czecho-Slovakia that France had promised in the Munich Agreement.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 269‚Äì270. On 25 November 1938, Bonnet informed the French Ambassador to Poland, L√©on No√´l, that France should find an excuse for terminating the 1921 Franco- Polish alliance, but found that his views on this issue created considerable opposition within the Quai d'Orsay, where it was argued that Poland was too valuable an ally to be abandoned, and that if France renounced the Polish alliance, Warsaw would align herself with Berlin (the Polish Foreign Minister Colonel J√≥zef Beck was widely, if erroneously, believed in France to be pro- German).Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 271. In December 1938, during the visit of the German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop to Paris to sign the largely meaningless French-German non-aggression pact,France Signs \\"No- War\\" Pact with Germany, Chicago Tribune, 7 December 1938 Ribbentrop had conversations with Bonnet that he later claimed included a promise to him that France would recognize all of Eastern Europe as Germany's exclusive sphere of influence. This led to a long war of words between the two foreign ministers in the summer of 1939 over just what precisely Bonnet actually said to Ribbentrop.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 290‚Äì292. Ribbentrop was to use Bonnet's alleged statement to convince Hitler that France would not go to war in the defence of Poland in 1939. Both Bonnet and Saint-Leg√©r L√©ger were quite vehement in insisting that no such remark was ever made.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 page 75. =The Danzig crisis= In January 1939, Bonnet commissioned a study for the French cabinet that concluded that the 1935 Franco-Soviet alliance was now defunct, and there were no grounds for hope about help from the Soviet Union.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 page 331. Rumours in the French press over the winter of 1938‚Äì39 that France was seeking the end of the eastern alliances generated concerns both in the Chamber of Deputies and in the press, leading Bonnet to state in a speech to the Chamber on 26 January 1939: \\"So, gentlemen, let us dispose of the legend that our policy has destroyed the engagements that we have contracted in Eastern Europe with the USSR and with Poland. These engagements remain in force and they must be applied in the same spirit in which they were conceived\\".Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 276. In response to Bonnet's speech, Ribbentrop summoned the French Ambassador to Germany, Robert Coulondre, on 6 February 1939 to offer a formal protest over his speech.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 page 321 Ribbentrop told Coulondre that because of Bonnet's alleged statement of 6 December 1938 accepting Eastern Europe as Germany's zone of influence meant that \\"France's commitments in Eastern Europe\\" were now \\"off limits\\".Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 page 321 Besides seeking to end the cordon sanitaire, Bonnet's major initiative in foreign policy after Munich was a series of economic agreements he sought to negotiate with the Germans. Bonnet's economic diplomacy was intended to achieve four goals: *He wanted to end Great Depression in France; *Like many other appeasers on both sides of the Channel, Bonnet believed that German foreign policy was driven by economic grievances, not by Nazi racial theories about Lebensraum, which Bonnet considered farfetched that he felt that the Nazis did not take their ideology seriously. Thus, arrangements to offer Germany greater prosperity would tame German complaints against the existing international order and reduce international tension. *Like other economic experts around the world in the 1930s, Bonnet was disturbed by the implications of the increasing tendency in Germany towards protectionism, currency manipulation, use of \\"blocked accounts\\" for foreign businesses in Germany and foreign holders of German debt, autarky, a growing etatism in the German economy, and the German drive to create their own economic zone in Europe. Bonnet felt that Franco-German economic agreements would at least ensure that France would not be locked out of the German economic sphere of influence and even moderate some of the more worrisome German economic practices. *He wanted a Franco-German friendship that would both banish the prospect of another war, and end the arms race that had placed such a burden on the French economy. However, during the winter of 1938‚Äì1939, negotiations with the Germans proceeded slowly, in large part because the Germans refused to abandon the economic practices that caused such concern. The atmosphere, following the German destruction of Czecho-Slovakia (as Czechoslovakia had been renamed), on 15 March 1939 was not considered conductive for France to be pursuing any sort of agreements with the Germans, and the talks were called off, never to be resumed. At the same time, Bonnet ordered Charles Corbin, the French Ambassador in London to warn Chamberlain and Lord Halifax during their scheduled visit to Rome in January 1939 against any weakening of Anglo-French relations at the expense of improved Anglo- Italian relations. During a meeting between Fran√ßois-Poncet and Count Ciano, the Italian Foreign Minister claimed that the demonstrations were purely \\"spontaneous\\" and did not reflect the views of his government.Duroselle, Jean- Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 page 324. As part of an effort to gain British support against the Italian campaign, Bonnet issued a statement that France would always rush to Britain's aid in the event of aggression, hoping that his statement might lead to a similar British statement.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 page 93. In early January 1939, Bonnet and Daladier approved of the idea of sending the banker Paul Baudoin as an unofficial diplomat to find out just what exactly the Italians wanted from France.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 page 326. The reasoning for the Baudoin mission was if the price of Italian friendship was not too expensive, it might be worth paying as a way of detaching Italy from Germany, thus reducing France's potential enemies. When Baudoin visited Rome in February 1939, he reported that the Italians were asking for only some economic concessions from the French in the Horn of Africa and Italian representation on the board of the Compagnie universelle du canal maritime de Suez.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 pages 326‚Äì327. However, before any decisions were made in Paris about accepting the Italian demands or not, the news of Baudoin's secret visit was leaked to the French press, forcing Bonnet to disavow Baudoin. In response to furious complaints from Fran√ßois-Poncet about Baudoin's mission, which he had first learned about after the story had been leaked, Bonnet replied to Fran√ßois-Poncet: \\"The rumors you are telling me have no basis in fact. You are fully aware that any conversation, any Franco-Italian negotiation official or unofficial could only be handled by you, and that no direct or indirect transaction could not be considered outside your purview\\". In January 1939, negotiations were opened between the French and Turkey over resolving the Hatay dispute.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 pages 364‚Äì365. Leading the French team were Gabriel Puaux, the High Commissioner of Syria and Massigli, the French Ambassador in Ankara.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 page 365. The continuing feud between Massigli and Bonnet was reflected in Bonnet's habit of refusing Massigli negotiating instructions for weeks on end, thereby placing Massigli in an embarrassing situation when he attempted talks with the Turks. During the talks, Bonnet had first backed Puaux, against any weakening of French control over the Sanjak of Alexandretta before deciding upon settling the dispute in favor of the Turks as a way of potentially winning Turkish support in the event of a war with Germany.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 pages 365‚Äì366. Despite efforts to maintain some sort of French presence in Alexandretta, the Franco-Turkish talks were to end in June 1939, with the Turks being given total control over the disputed region.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 pages 366‚Äì367. By early 1939, it was clear that the days of the Spanish Republic were numbered, and Bonnet felt that it was time for France to recognize the Spanish Nationalists as the legitimate government of Spain (until that time, Paris had recognized the Republican government as the legitimate government).Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 pages 338‚Äì339. On 20 January 1939, Bonnet had a meeting with the former president of Mexico, Francisco Le√≥n de la Barra, who was living in exile in Paris, and asked that de la Barra serve as an unofficial French diplomat in talks with the Spanish Nationalists.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 page 339. In response to reports from de la Barra that ties between General Francisco Franco and the Axis powers were strained, Bonnet then sent out Senator L√©on B√©rard to sound out the Nationalists about establishing diplomatic relations. Bonnet told B√©rard to inform General Jordana, the Nationalist Foreign Minister that if General Franco was willing to promise that all German and Italian forces were to be withdrawn after the end of the Spanish Civil War, then Paris would recognize the Nationalists. The major dispute during the talks between B√©rard and Jourdana was if the recognition of the Burgos government would be de jure, as Franco wanted, or de facto, as Bonnet wanted and if Franco would promise to remain neutral should a Franco- German war occur.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 pages 340‚Äì341. However. by February 1939, Bonnet believed that the rapid collapse of the Republican war effort made recognition of the Burgos government imperative if France were to have any hope of having influence with General Franco, and on 28 February 1939, France broke diplomatic relations with the Republican government in Madrid and recognized the Nationalist government in Burgos.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 page 341. Much to the relief of Bonnet, General Franco kept his word about ensuring the withdrawal of Axis forces from Spanish territory, especially the departure of the Italians from the Balearic Islands. In early 1939, the British Embassy in Paris was bombarded with a series of reports that public opinion in France was highly dejected and demoralized, and that unless Britain made the \\"continental commitment\\" (unequivocally linking British security to French security and committing to sending a large British Expeditionary Force to France like the one ultimately sent in World War I), the French would resign themselves to becoming a German satellite state.Young, Robert J. In Command of France French Foreign Policy and Military Planning, 1933‚Äì1940, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America, 1978 pages 222‚Äì224 These reports, which secretly originated with the French government, hoped to pressure the British into making the long-sought \\"continental commitment\\".Young, Robert J. In Command of France French Foreign Policy and Military Planning, 1933‚Äì1940, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America, 1978 pages 222‚Äì224; Duroselle, Jean- Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 pages 331‚Äì332. The French were assisted in a conspiracy of convenience by the leadership of the British Army, which disliked the funding implications of Chamberlain's \\"limited liability\\" doctrine that held that in the next war, British efforts were to be largely limited to the sea and air, army playing an ancillary role at best. The French effort for a British \\"continental commitment\\" was given a huge and unexpected boost by the \\"Dutch war scare\\" of January 1939. In response to the \\"Dutch war scare\\", which gripped London in late January 1939 when the British government received false reports of an imminent German invasion of the Netherlands, Halifax had Phipps inquire what France would do if such an invasion took place. The Germans were then believed to have planned to overrun the Netherlands and use Dutch airfields to launch a bombing campaign meant to achieve a knockout blow against Britain, and raze British cities to the ground.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 pages 102‚Äì103. The French attitude towards a German invasion of the Netherlands was crucial because France was the only country in Western Europe that possessed an army large enough and modern enough to save the Dutch. Moreover, the importance of France to British security had increased following a violent anti-British propaganda campaign launched in Germany in November 1938, which had led the Chamberlain government to perceive German foreign policy as anti-British. This scare was combined with rumours that Bonnet was secretly attempting to negotiate a Franco-German \\"special relationship\\" that might leave Britain facing a hostile Germany without any allies who possessed the large armies that Britain lacked. In response to Phipps's message, Bonnet had Charles Corbin, the French ambassador in London, inform Lord Halifax that the French attitude towards German aggression towards the Netherlands would depend upon what the British attitude towards France was if the latter were the victim of aggression.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 pages 331‚Äì332. Chamberlain stated to the House of Commons on 6 February 1939 that any German attack on France would automatically be considered an attack on Britain, thereby leading the British to make the \\"continental commitment\\" to send a large army to the defense of France that successive French diplomats had struggled to obtain since 1919. In March 1939, following the German destruction of the rump state of Czechoslovakia and the proclamation of the Reich Protectorate of Bohemia- Moravia, Bonnet had Herv√© Alphand of the Ministry of Commerce, who was in Berlin to negotiate a trade treaty, recalled in protest.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 301. The German move badly damaged Bonnet's creditability, and as part of the aftermath, 17 French intellectuals sent out a letter calling for an inquiry into Bonnet's conduct of foreign affairs.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 302. Ties between Daladier and Bonnet were strained when in protest over the German coup, Daladier ordered the recall of Robert Coulondre, the French Ambassador to Germany, without consulting Bonnet, who was much offended by Daladier's act. In April 1939, Bonnet in turn went behind Daladier's back in suggesting for Britain to apply pressure on the French premier to make more concessions to Italy regarding the Franco-Italian disputes over influence in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea regions.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 308. The differences in opinion between Daladier and Bonnet over the question of making concessions to Italy, which Daladier was firmly opposed to, led Daladier increasingly to take control of foreign policy by dealing directly with the Quai d'Orsay's Secretary-General Alexis Saint-Leg√©r L√©ger and pushing Bonnet aside from April 1939 onwards.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 314‚Äì316. In April 1939, Daladier told the Romanian foreign minister Grigore Gafencu \\"he was going to get rid of Bonnet quite shortly\\", and on 6 May, Daladier stated to Bullit he had a great deal of \\"...mistrust of Bonnet and said that he might replace him in the immediate future\\".Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 327. As Count Welczeck noted in May 1939: \\"Bonnet was ...a man who would go to the utmost limits to avoid a European war up to the last moment. He regretted therefore that foreign affairs were so much more in the hands of M. Daladier than M. Bonnet\\".Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 319. During the \\"Romanian war scare\\" of March 1939, when the Romanian government, as part of an effort to enlist British support against German demands for the control of the Romanian oil industry, had the Romanian Minister in London Virgil Tilea make a series of highly misleading statements to the British government to the effect that they were under the verge of an immediate German invasion, Bonnet happened to be in London as part of the company accompanying the state visit of President Albert Lebrun.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 page 178. The importance of Romania was that Germany possessed no oil of its own and was highly-dependent on oil from the New World (the coal liquefaction plants that were to supply Germany with oil during World War II were not yet in operation). As such, a naval blockade of Germany would have had highly damaging effects on the German economy, and conversely, a German seizure of Romania would undermine the effectiveness of a blockade. When the war scare began on 18 March 1939, Bonnet's first response was to inform the Romanians that they should accept aid from the Soviet Union as there was nothing France could do to save them. The Romanians rejected the French advice while Jakob Suritz, the Soviet Ambassador to France, stated the Soviet Union would take no initiatives in resisting German aggression in Eastern Europe, and France must show the way. During an emergency meeting with Halifax on 20 March, Bonnet sought to shift responsibility to dealing with the crisis onto British shoulders and strongly suggested that the ideal state for saving Romania and its oil was Poland.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 pages 178‚Äì179. Bonnet argued that Britain should take the lead in persuading the Poles to come to Romania's aid and suggested that if Poland were involved, then perhaps the Romanians might be persuaded to accept Soviet aid as well. Bonnet's reasons for arguing that Britain should take the lead in persuading Poland to come to Romania's aid were his fear that if France made such an effort, the price of Polish support would a tightening of the Franco-Polish alliance, which was counter to Bonnet's general policy of seeking to weaken France's eastern alliances. On 23 March 1939, in another meeting with Lord Halifax, Bonnet mentioned that he had received a series of messages from Fran√ßois-Poncet, claiming that it would create a highly negative impression on Mussolini and would hamper efforts to detach him from his alignment with Germany if Britain and France aligned themselves with only the Soviet Union.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 page 179. Bonnet's statement was to lead the British government into considering the idea of making a \\"guarantee\\" of Polish independence as the best way of securing Polish support for Romania. In this way, Bonnet played a major, if indirect role in the progress leading to the British \\"guarantee\\" of Poland on 31 March 1939. Following the British \\"guarantee\\" of Polish independence on 31 March 1939, followed by the announcements that London wished to build a \\"peace front\\" to resist aggression in April 1939, Bonnet felt there was now a great opportunity of building an Anglo-French-Soviet combination that might deter Germany from war.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road to War, London: Macmillan, 1989 page 138. On 14 April 1939, Bonnet had a meeting with the Soviet Ambassador to France, Jakob Suritz, and asked \\"in a form to be determined\\" for the Soviet Union to provide military support for Poland and Romania if those nations were attacked by Germany.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 page 349. Bonnet suggested to Suritz that an Annexe to the Franco-Soviet Pact of 1935 should be added: the Soviet Union would go to war if Germany attacked either Poland or Romania.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 page 227. In particular, Bonnet stated: \\"It was obvious that there had to be an agreement between the USSR and Romania or the USSR and Poland for the Franco-Soviet Pact to come usefully into play\\". Suritz commented that unless the Poles and Romanians allowed the Red Army transit rights, there was little that the Soviet Union could do for those nations, leading Bonnet to reply that he felt he could pressure both nations into agreeing to provide the desired transit rights. Bonnet commented that he felt it was time to \\"begin immediate discussions between France and the USSR in order to precisely determine the help the USSR could provide to Romania and Poland in the event of German aggression\\". In contrast to his enthusiasm for improving ties with Moscow in the spring of 1939, Bonnet felt the opposite about relations with Warsaw. In May 1939, during talks in Paris with the Poles aimed at strengthening the political and military aspects of the Franco-Polish alliance, Bonnet sabotaged the negotiations by bogging down the talks on the political accord on procedural details, ensuring that no political accord was signed, the precondition for the military accords (not until 3 September 1939 was the political accord finally signed).Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 319‚Äì322. Bonnet's reasons in seeking to block the signing of the Franco-Polish political accord were a way of applying pressure on the Poles to grant the Soviets transit rights, and because in case the negotiations for the \\"grand alliance\\" failed, Bonnet did not wish to see France any more committed to Poland's defense. In June 1939, Bonnet's reputation was badly damaged when the French agent of the Dienststelle Ribbentrop, Otto Abetz, was expelled from France for engaging in espionage, French newspaper editors were charged with receiving bribes from Abetz, and the name of Bonnet's wife was prominently mentioned in connection with the Abetz case as a close friend of the two editors, but despite much lucid speculation in the French press at the time, that no evidence has ever emerged linking Bonnet or his wife to German espionage or bribery.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 332. During the ultimately failed talks for an Anglo-Franco-Soviet alliance in the spring and summer of 1939, Bonnet and the rest of the French leadership pressed quite strongly for the revived Triple Entente, often to the considerable discomfort of the British.Young, Robert J. In Command of France, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, United States of America, 1978 pages 236‚Äì237 In the spring and summer of 1939, Bonnet very strongly believed that a \\"grand alliance\\" of the Soviet Union, Great Britain and France would deter Germany from attacking Poland.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 page 272. At a meeting with Lord Halifax on 20‚Äì21 May 1939 in Geneva, Daladier, Bonnet and Saint-Leg√©r pressured the British Foreign Secretary repeatedly for a \\"grand alliance\\" as the only way of stopping another world war.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 pages 352‚Äì353. In the spring of 1939, Bonnet went so far as to inform Moscow that he supported turning over all of eastern Poland to the Soviet Union regardless of what the Poles felt about the issue if that was to be the price of the Soviet alliance.Imlay, Talbot \\"France and the Phony War, 1939‚Äì1940\\" pages 261‚Äì280 from French Foreign and Defence Policy, 1918‚Äì1940 edited by Robert Boyce page 264. On 2 June 1939, when the Soviet government offered up its definition of what constituted \\"aggression\\", upon which the intended alliance was to come into play, Bonnet sided with the Soviets against the British, who felt that the Soviet definition of \\"aggression\\", especially \\"indirect aggression\\" was too loose a definition and phrased in such a manner as to imply the Soviet right of inference in the internal affairs of nations of Eastern Europe.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 page 353. On 1 July 1939, in response to a message from the Soviet Foreign Commissar Vyacheslav Molotov about what nations the intended \\"grand alliance\\" was meant to protect, Bonnet sent a telegraph in reply stating the purpose of the \\"grand alliance\\" was \\"the mutual solidarity of the three great powers... in those conditions the number of countries guaranteed is unimportant\\".Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 page 355. Besides working for the \\"peace front\\" with Britain and the Soviet Union, Bonnet tried to enlist Turkey in the \\"peace front\\" in July 1939 by arranging for the French and British treasuries to provide financial support to Ankara.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 pages 308‚Äì309. By early July 1939, Bonnet grew increasingly irritated over what he regarded as British foot-dragging in the talks with the Soviets and Polish refusing to grant transit rights to the Red Army.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 page 356. Bonnet wrote to Lord Halifax at this time stating \\"We are reaching a critical moment, where we find it necessary to do everything possible to succeed\\". As part of an effort to save the talks, Bonnet wrote up and presented, to both London and Moscow, the text of a joint communiqu√© stating to the world their determination to resist aggression and that they \\"agreed on the main points of the political agreement\\". Bonnet's effort was blocked by Molotov, who stated his government had no interest in issuing such a communiqu√©.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 page 357. In August 1939, Bonnet took up a Turkish effort of mediation between the British and the Soviets as part of an attempt to break the deadlock.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 page 310. When the Anglo-Franco-Soviet talks were on the verge of breaking down in August 1939 over the issue of transit rights for the Red Army in Poland, Bonnet instructed the French Embassy in Moscow to inform the Kremlin falsely that the Poles had granted the desired transit rights as part of a desperate bid to rescue the alliance talks with the Soviets.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War pages 337‚Äì338. At the same time, immense French diplomatic pressure was applied in Warsaw for the Poles to agree to the transit rights for the Red Army, but the Polish Foreign Minister, J√≥zef Beck was very firm in refusing to consider such an idea. On 19 August 1939, Beck stated in a message to Paris: \\"We have not got a military agreement with the USSR. We do not want to have one\\". The conclusion of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact of 23 August 1939 left Bonnet highly dejected, believing the prospect of Soviet economic support for Germany would undermine the effectiveness of a British naval blockade of Germany (which was widely assumed in France to be a prerequisite of defeating Germany), and hence his return to advocating renouncing the Polish alliance as the best way of avoiding war for France.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 page 272; Imlay, Talbot \\"France and the Phony War, 1939‚Äì1940\\" pages 261‚Äì280 from French Foreign and Defence Policy, 1918‚Äì1940 edited by Robert Boyce pages 265‚Äì267. = August 1939: the Last Months of Peace = After the Non-Aggression Pact, Bonnet urged Daladier that the French should inform the Poles that they should give the Free City of Danzig (modern Gda≈Ñsk, Poland) to Germany, and if the Poles refused, the French should use that refusal as an excuse to renounce the alliance with Poland.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road to War, London: Macmillan, 1989 page 139. At a cabinet meeting on 22 August 1939, Bonnet spoke against French mobilization and argued that France should seek to find a way to end the alliance with Poland.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 337‚Äì338. Bonnet supported by St. L√©ger-L√©ger and Daladier argued for making one more attempt to win the Soviet alliance.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 page 467. Reynaud and Mandel both spoke for French mobilization, which Bonnet argued would increase Polish \\"intransigence\\"; Bonnet's comment about mobilization was \\"I do not ask for this\\". At a meeting of the Standing Committee on National Defence, which comprised the Premier, the Ministers of Defence, the Navy, the Air and Foreign Affairs and all of the top French military officials on 23 August 1939, Bonnet sought to pressure General Maurice Gamelin into stating that France could not risk a war in 1939, stating that France should find a way of renouncing the 1921 alliance with Poland.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 339‚Äì341. Bonnet argued that Poland could be saved with only Soviet support, no longer possible because of the Non-Aggression Pact.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 page 468 Bonnet asserted that oil-rich Romania, helmed in by Germany and the Soviet Union, would now lean towards the totalitarian states and that the Soviets would not allow Turkey to enter the war if Germany attacked a state in the Balkans. At that meeting, Bonnet's arguments for abandoning Poland were countered by General Gamelin, who argued that if war came, there was little France could do for the Poles (whom Gamelin felt could hold out for about three months), but to abandon Poland would be equivalent to abandoning great power status for France.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road to War, London: Macmillan, 1989 page 140. As Bonnet continued his efforts against going to war for Poland, Daladier increasingly came to feel that appointing Bonnet to the Qui d'Orsay had been a mistake and now consumed with hatred for Bonnet.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road to War, London: Macmillan, 1989 page 140; Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 page 544. Juliusz ≈Åukasiewicz, the Polish Ambassador to France, accused Bonnet of \\"preparing a new Munich behind our backs\\". On 31 August 1939, Bonnet was the leading spokesman for the idea of using the peace mediation proposals of Benito Mussolini as a pretext for ending the alliance with Poland but was overruled by the French cabinet led by Daladier.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 345‚Äì346. Bonnet together his close ally, the Public Works Minister, Anatole de Monzie, sought to pressure some of the more hesitant hawks in the Cabinet such as Charles Pomaret, Henri Queuille and Jean Zay, into endorsing accepting Mussolini's offer.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 page 544 At that meeting, Bonnet stated that French should accept the Italian offer and reject the British precondition for acceptance, namely the demobilization of the German Army. Daladier, strongly supported by General Gamelin, argued that Mussolini's proposed peace conference was a trap, and the French should find a reason not to attend Mussolini's proposed conference.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road to War, London: Macmillan, 1989 page 141. = Final attempts to stop war = When Bonnet first learned of the German attack on Poland at 8:20 a.m., on 1 September 1939, his first reaction was to contact the Italian Ambassador to France, Baron Raffaele Guariglia, and informed him that France had accepted Mussolini's mediation offer.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 page 545. Bonnet then ordered Fran√ßois-Poncet to see Mussolini about when the peace conference could begin. Bonnet argued very strongly in the cabinet against a French declaration of war and instead urged that the French take up Mussolini's mediation offer; if the Poles refused to attend Mussolini's conference (which was widely expected since Mussolini's revised peace plan on 1 September called for an armistice, not for the removal of German troops from Poland, the major Polish precondition to accepting the Italian plan), the French should denounce the Polish alliance.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 346‚Äì350. Later, that same day, Bonnet ordered the Ambassador in London, Charles Corbin, to tell the British that Mussolini's peace offers had been accepted.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 page 546. Corbin, in turn, reported that now that war had begun, the British were starting to lose interest in the Italian mediation offer. Likewise, Ambassador L√©on No√´l, in Warsaw, was instructed to see if the Poles would agree to attending Mussolini's proposed conference, only to receive an angry reply from Beck about when France proposed to honor the Franco-Polish alliance by declaring war on Germany. Strong British pressure for a warning to be delivered in Berlin made Bonnet reluctantly order Ambassador Robert Coulondre late on the afternoon of the 1st to warn Ribbentrop that if the Germans continued with their aggression, then France would declare war on Germany.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 pages 549‚Äì550. At midnight on 1 September, Bonnet had Havas issue a statement saying: \\"The French government has today, as have several other Governments, received an Italian proposal looking to the resolution of Europe's difficulties. After due consideration the French government has given a \\"positive response\\"\\".Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 page 550. On the morning of 2 September, an angry scene occurred at the Quai d'Orsay when the Polish Ambassador Juliusz ≈Åukasiewicz marched in unannounced and during a stormy interview with Bonnet demanded to know why France had not declared war yet.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 pages 568‚Äì570. Later that same day, Bonnet during a phone conversation with Count Ciano made a great point of insisting that the French d√©marche of 1 September was not an ultimatum, urging that the Italians start the peace conference as soon as possible.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 page 572. Though both Bonnet and the Italians were serious about the conference, the proposed conference was blocked when Halifax stated that unless the Germans withdrew from Poland immediately, Britain would not attend. During a phone call to Halifax later on 2 September, Bonnet could not persuade Halifax to drop the precondition about a German withdrawal.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 pages 573‚Äì574. At about 5:00 p.m., Bonnet had another tempestuous interview with ≈Åukasiewicz, who pressed very strongly for a French declaration of war and accused Bonnet of plotting to keep France neutral.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 page 576. As part of an effort to gain British acceptance of the Italian plan, Bonnet sought to see if it were possible for the Germans to stage a \\"symbolic withdrawal\\" from Poland, only to learn from Lord Halifax that a \\"symbolic withdrawal\\" was not acceptable and from Ribbentrop that the Germans had no interest in any sort of peace conference.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 pages 583‚Äì585. Bonnet, together with his allies in the \\"peace lobby\\" both within and without the government such as Anatole de Monzie, Jean Mistler, Marcel D√©at, Paul Faure, Paul Baudoin, Pierre Laval, Ren√© Belin, Adrien Marquet, and Gaston Bergery, all spent 1‚Äì3 September lobbying the Daladier government, the Senate and the Chamber against going to war with Germany.Irvine, William \\"Domestic Politics and the Fall of France in 1940\\" pages 85‚Äì99 from The French Defeat of 1940 edited by Joel Blatt, Providence: Berghahn Books 1998 pages 96‚Äì97Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 346‚Äì351. On 3 September 1939, Britain declared war on Germany, which had the effect of resolving the debate in Paris and Daladier finally having the French declaration of war issued later that same day. For a week after the war was declared, Daladier avoided having the cabinet meet to ensure that Bonnet would not have a chance to put forward his views about seeking peace with Germany.R√©au, Elisabeth du \\"√âdouard Daladier: The Conduct of the War and the Beginnings of Defeat\\" pages 100‚Äì125 from The French Defeat of 1940 Reassessments edited by Joel Blatt Berghahn Books: Providence 1998 page 106. Bonnet was demoted to minister of justice on 13 September 1939. Later career In the latter half of March 1940, Bonnet together with his \\"peace lobby\\" allies such as Anatole de Monzie, Pierre- √âtienne Flandin, Pierre Laval, Jean Montigny, Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour, Georges Scapini, Ren√© Dommanage, Gaston Bergery, Ren√© Chateau, and Ren√© Brunet, made a major lobbying effort to have Laval appointed foreign minister as a prelude to making peace with Germany.Irvine, William \\"Domestic Politics and the Fall of France in 1940\\" pages 85‚Äì99 from The French Defeat of 1940 Reassessments edited by Joel Blatt Berghahn Books: Providence 1998 page 97 Besides chairing meetings of the \\"peace lobby\\", which met six times during the Dr√¥le de guerre, Bonnet otherwise remained silent as Justice Minister.Irvine, William \\"Domestic Politics and the Fall of France in 1940\\" pages 85‚Äì99 from The French Defeat of 1940 Reassessments edited by Joel Blatt Berghahn Books: Providence 1998 page 97 On 21 June 1940, Bonnet together with Pierre Laval helped to pressure President Albert Lebrun into changing his mind about leaving for Algeria.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 101. Bonnet supported the Vichy government and served on the National Council from December 1940, but the council never met, and his role in Vichy was small. Bonnet spent most of World War II living on his estate in the Dordogne and attempting to secure himself an office in Vichy, though Bonnet was later to claim to have been involved in the Resistance. According to Gestapo records, Bonnet contacted the Germans once in February 1941 to see if it were possible if the Germans would pressure Laval to include him in the Cabinet and again in June 1943 to reassure them that he had no intention of leaving France to join the Allies. In November 1942, Bonnet agreed, albeit very reluctantly to testify for the prosecution at the planned trial of Herschel Grynszpan.Steinweis, Alan The Trials of Herschel Grynszpan: Anti-Jewish Policy and German Propaganda, 1938-1942 pages 471-488 from German Studies Review, Volume 31, Issue #3, October 2008 page 481. Bonnet was to testify that his efforts at reaching a rapprochement with the Reich had been sabotaged by the Jews, who were intent on starting a war with Germany, and that Grynszpan had assassinated Ernst von Rath as part of an alleged Jewish conspiracy to push France into war with Germany. However, the trial was never held as Gryszpan's planned defense that he was having a homosexual relationship with Rath, and had shot him as part of a lover's quarrel meant from the German viewpoint the trial was too risky as people might have believed that claim.Steinweis, Alan The Trials of Herschel Grynszpan: Anti- Jewish Policy and German Propaganda, 1938-1942 pages 471-488 from German Studies Review, Volume 31, Issue #3, October 2008 page 484. On 5 April 1944, Bonnet left France for Switzerland, where he was to stay until March 1950.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 101‚Äì102. After the war, proceedings were begun against him but eventually dropped, but he was expelled from the Radical Party in 1944. During his time in exile, Bonnet was to write a five-volume set of memoirs.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 101‚Äì103. Bonnet throughout his career had been very much concerned with his reputation, and during his time as Foreign Minister had a team of journalists to engage in what is known in France as Bonnetiste writing, namely a series of books and pamphlets meant to glorify Bonnet as the defender of the peace and Europe's savior.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 400. After leaving the Quai d'Orsay, Bonnet took with him a large number of official papers, which he then used to support the claims made in his voluminous memoirs, where Bonnet depicted himself as waging a singlehanded heroic battle to save the peace.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 398‚Äì401. Many have charged Bonnet with \\"editing\\" his papers to present himself in the best possible light, regardless of the facts. In particular, criticism has centered on some of the contradictory claims in the Bonnet memoirs. At various points, Bonnet claimed it was British pressure that drove France towards Munich in 1938 and that his government wanted to fight for Czechoslovakia. At other times, Bonnet states the military and economic situation in 1938 was such that France could not risk a war that year. In the early 1950s, Bonnet had a debate on the pages of the Times Literary Supplement with one of his leading critics, the British historian Sir Lewis Bernstein Namier over some of the claims contained in his memoirs.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 183‚Äì184 At issue was whether Bonnet had, as Namier charged, snubbed an offer by the Polish foreign minister Colonel J√≥zef Beck in May 1938 to have Poland come to the aid of Czechoslovakia in the event of a German attack. Bonnet denied that such an offer had been made, which led Namier to accuse Bonnet of seeking to falsify the documentary record. Namier was able to establish that Bonnet had been less than honest in his account, and concluded the debate in 1953 with the words: \\"The Polish offer, for what it was worth, was first torpedoed by Bonnet the statesman, and next obliterated by Bonnet the historian\\".Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 184 The real significance of the debate was over Bonnet's freedom of maneuver. In his memoirs, Bonnet claimed that he had been often forced by circumstances beyond his control to carry out a foreign policy that he opposed. Namier charged that Bonnet had other options and was carrying out the same foreign policy that he had wanted to carry out. In 1953, he was allowed to run for office again, and in 1956, Bonnet returned to his old seat in the Dordogne.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 102. Readmitted to the Radicals in 1952, he was once again expelled in 1955 for refusing to support Pierre Mend√®s France. Nevertheless, he was once again elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1956 and continued to serve in that body until 1968, when he lost his seat.
