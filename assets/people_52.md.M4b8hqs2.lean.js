The mountain is situated in eastern Snohomish County, in the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. Its nearest higher peak is White Mountain, to the northeast, along with Indian Head Peak to the east. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Sauk River. The mountain's name honors Mackinaw Johnson, a prospector who had a cabin in the vicinity. Geology The North Cascades feature some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. Glacier Peak, a stratovolcano that is north of Johnson Mountain, began forming in the mid-Pleistocene.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. Climate Johnson Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.

Miia K. Kivipelto (born 1973) is a Finnish neuroscientist and professor at the University of Eastern Finland and Karolinska Institute. Her research focuses on dementia and Alzheimer's disease.  Early life and education  Kivipelto was born in Alaj√§rvi, Finland in 1973. She studied medicine at the University of Kuopio (now University of Eastern Finland) and received her MD in 1999, specializing in geriatrics. She received her PhD in 2002 after defending her dissertation on vascular risk factors in Alzheimer's disease. In a 2017 interview, Kivipelto attributed her interest in dementia, Alzheimer's, and diseases of aging to her close relationship with her grandmother, who developed Alzheimer's when she was young. Kivipelto held a post-doctoral fellowship at the Karolinska Institute from 2002‚Äì2005. In 2006, Kivipelto was appointed associate professor of neuroepidemiology at the University of Kuopio. Kivipelto became a senior lecturer at the Karolinska Institute (KI) in 2010 and was appointed professor of clinical geriatric epidemiology there in 2011. She is a deputy director of the KI Aging Research Center and the KI Memory Clinic clinical trial unit at the Karolinska University Hospital in Huddinge.  Research  Kivipelto studies the epidemiology, prevention, and treatment of dementia, which is a decline in cognitive function strongly associated with ageing and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Her research has identified connections between memory disorders and vascular risk factors such as high blood lipids and high blood pressure, as well as general health risk factors such as poor physical fitness and obesity. Kivipelto published a composite risk score to predict dementia risk based on these factors in 2006 following the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Dementia (CAIDE) population-based study. From 2009‚Äì2011, Kivipelto led the Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER) clinical trial, which demonstrated that a multidomain intervention of diet, exercise, cognitive training, and vascular risk monitoring may preserve cognitive functioning in elderly people with high dementia risk. She currently leads the World Wide FINGERS initiative, which aims to replicate multi-domain dementia prevention trials and share data internationally.

Set by the Tauherenikau River on the plain below the junction of the Tararua and Rimutaka ranges Fernside was built in 1924 to replace a house destroyed by fire. The current building is the work of the educated tastes of client, Ella, Mrs Charles Elgar and her 29-year-old architect, Heathcote Helmore. The house is near Featherston down a tree-lined mile-long (1.6 kilometres) drive from State Highway 2 and surrounded by 20 acres of expertly maintained and landscaped gardens. The gardens have mature features much more than a century old. The associated farmland which gave it the title homestead has been under separate ownership since 1945.

He is assumed to have returned to Wood to finish his articles after the Armistice. He won admission to the Institute of Architects in April 1920. With a younger architect friend, Guy Cotterill, he set out to gather overseas experience. They travelled to England in July 1920 on the ship S.S. Ionic with the retiring Governor-General and when they docked in Newport News took up his offer to take them in Liverpool's car to Yorktown where the young men took a deep interest in the colonial architecture of Virginia.UC Research Repository Robert Jonathan Esau.

However there is no record of participation by Gertrude Jekyll in any schemes for Fernside‚Äôs gardens. He started with Lutyens at the beginning of October 1921. On at least one occasion Helmore exhibited some of his drawings to Queen Mary. He may have worked on minor buildings near the Viceroy's house in New Delhi.

She was twice world champion. Shooting career Kanthak was born in 1958 in Torgau, Saxony; at the time located in East Germany. The leader of her school choir in the nearby Arzberg, Klaus M√ºller, was also a trainer in sport shooting and she was asked, aged 12 or 13, to come along to a shooting session where her talent was discovered. Competing for Gesellschaft f√ºr Sport und Technik (GST)-Club Leipzig, her first international competition was in 1974 in Thun, Switzerland. Competing as a 16-year-old (the youngest of the approximately 1000 competitors), she came fourth at the 1974 World Championships in the women's 50 m rifle three positions. At the 1975 European Championships in Sofia, she won silver behind Anka Pelova in the 50 m rifle three positions, and won gold in the 60 m lying position. Her strong performance was the main reason for the East German women to win the team competition. At the 1976 European 10 m Events Championships in Paris, France, in February 1976, Kanthak came third in the mixed event and became European champion with the junior team. Kanthak went to the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Canada, where she was so nervous that she couldn't see the target properly. In the mixed 50 metre rifle three positions she came 32nd, and in the mixed 50 metre rifle prone she was 51st. At the 1976 European Championships in Skopje, Yugoslavia, Kanthak was again beaten by Pelova in the 50 m rifle three positions event, but the GDR women won gold as a team. Their result of 1,772 rings set a new world record. In the 50 m rifle prone event, Kanthak showed poor form and came fifth as an individual but won silver with the team. At the February 1977 European Championships held at Les Escaldes, Andorra, where competitions were held in air gun disciplines, Kanthak won silver with the air rifle and gold with the women's team. At the September 1977 European Championships in Bucharest, Romania, Kanthak did not place among the top ten in the mixed 50 meter rifle prone event but was the highest-placed competitor from East Germany. At the October 1977 European Championships for women and juniors in Rome, Italy, Kanthak won three gold medals: in the 50 meter rifle prone event, the 50 m rifle three positions event, and in the latter discipline also with the women's team. In the 50 m rifle three positions event, she improved Pelova's 1975 world record by two rings to 582 points. For her success, she was awarded the Ernst Schneller Medal in gold in December 1977, the highest award given out by the Gesellschaft f√ºr Sport und Technik. At the February 1978 European Championships held at Copenhagen, Denmark, where competitions were held in air gun disciplines, Kanthak came seventh in the individual air rifle competition, and won silver with the team in that event. She competed under her married name Helbig at the 1978 European Championships for women and juniors in H√§meenlinna, Finland, in the 50 metre rifle three positions event and won a silver medal. At the March 1979 European Championships held at Graz, Austria, where competitions were held in air gun disciplines, Helbig won a bronze medal in the individual air rifle competition, and silver with the team in that event. At an international competition in Suhl, East Germany, Helbig equalled her 1977 world record in the 50 m rifle three positions event. In April 1979, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) decided that women would first compete in their own shooting events in the 1984 Summer Olympics. As women were outperformed by men, East Germany did not nominate any women for the 1980 Summer Olympics. As the Eastern Bloc boycotted the 1984 Summer Olympics, Ray competed at the Friendship Games in Moscow instead. She won a bronze medal in the 10 metre air rifle event and won gold in the 50 metre rifle three positions event. Immediately afterwards, she was awarded a Patriotic Order of Merit in gold. Ray intended to temporarily retire in 1985 when she became pregnant. Her aim was to restart her shooting career so that she could compete at the 1986 World Championships in her home country held at Suhl, but her husband died during her pregnancy and she did not get back to shooting. At GST-Club Leipzig, she had been trained by Helga B√∂rners, Gerda Vo√ü, and Herbert Golla. Ray won more than 30 individual national championships during her career. Ray was a judge at the shooting competition at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. Private life In 1978, she married fellow sport shooter Hans-J√ºrgen Helbig. Her husband would compete at the 1980 Summer Olympics where he came 8th in the mixed 50 metre running target. In 1978 and 1979, she was referred to in the media as Marlies Helbig-Kanthak, and during 1980 either by this double-barrel name or as Marlies Helbig. From 1981, she was exclusively referred to under her husband's name only. In 1984, she married Eugen Ray. Her second husband had gone to the 1980 Summer Olympics as a sprinter and had, in the 1982/83 season, unsuccessfully tried his luck as a bobsledder. The first mention of her new surname appeared in August 1984, and she was mostly referred to as Marlies Ray-Helbig for the rest of 1984, and mostly as Marlies Ray during 1985. Her husband, who worked for the Police, died in a traffic crash while driving a police car on 18 January 1986. She was pregnant at the time and their son, who was to be named after his father, was born in June 1986. She studied clinical psychology. She lives in Wermsdorf and has been self-employed as a psychotherapist in D√∂beln since 2007.

History According to a self-published work by the Massachusetts State Council of the Knights of Columbus, in 1967, their organization voted to establish a non-profit corporation to construct affordable housing. The Boston Redevelopment Authority selected them to develop a parcel, but the Supreme Council of the Order did not like the idea. The Massachusetts State Council constructed the Christopher Columbus Waterfront Park instead in honor of their patron, Christopher Columbus. Other sources suggest the park was originally going to be known as Waterfront Park, planned by the efforts of local banker Frank S. Christian (d. 1970), the placement of an Italian marble statue of Columbus was entirely ad hoc, and the park was only renamed for Christopher Columbus through the efforts of local provocateur Arthur Stivaletta with the approval of Mayor Kevin White in the weeks prior to his 1979 reelection with new-found Italian-American support. The Massachusetts Beirut Memorial on the site was dedicated in the park in 1992. In 1999, the director of the Massachusetts Historical Society denounced the park as a poor use of city resources with inappropriate symbolism, observing that Boston has no connection to Christopher Columbus. He recommended restoring the park to commemorate its historical use as a fishing wharf. The Columbus statue was frequently vandalized: with red paint and the word \\"murderer\\" in 2004, beheaded for the first time in 2006, and spray painted with \\"Black Lives Matter\\" in 2015. Most recently, in the early morning hours of June 9, 2020, the head portion of the statue of Columbus was removed and stolen. Mayor Marty Walsh said the remaining portion of the stature would be removed and placed into storage and the city would be reviewing if the Italian marble statue would ever be placed in a high visibility location in the future. Walsh announced a few days prior to Columbus Day 2020 that the statue would not return, and would instead possibly be replaced with one commemorating Italian immigrants to America under the guidance of the Boston Art Commission.

By 1948 he was senior History and Economics master at Brisbane Grammar School and undertook further studies in education at Harvard University, from where he graduated as Doctor of Education. In 1951 he was appointed Education Officer with the Commonwealth Office of Education. He was employed as editor by Educational Press, of Sydney, and was responsible for the Australian Children's Newspaper (1953‚Äì ) and The ABC Children's Hour Annual #1‚Äì#5 (1956‚Äì58, 1960‚Äì61), and The Australian Children's Annual #6‚Äì#8 (1963‚Äì65). referred to here as Dr Hepworth. Monty Wedd was a frequent collaborator. In 1960 he established the Australian Reading Research Foundation to investigate and treat dyslexia. He died in Hornsby, New South Wales Family Hepworth married Edna Olive Wilton on 16 January 1941; they had at least one son. Bibliography *Hepworth, T. S.

From the 1970s through 2000s under CEOs Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer, Microsoft viewed the community creation and sharing of communal code, later to be known as free and open source software, as a threat to its business, and both executives spoke negatively against it. In the 2010s, as the industry turned towards cloud, embedded, and mobile computing‚Äîtechnologies powered by open source advances‚ÄîCEO Satya Nadella led Microsoft towards open source adoption although Microsoft's traditional Windows business continued to grow throughout this period generating revenues of 26.8 billion in the third quarter of 2018, while Microsoft's Azure cloud revenues nearly doubled its revenue. Microsoft open sourced some of its code, including the .NET Framework and Visual Studio Code, and made investments in Linux development, server technology, and organizations, including the Linux Foundation and Open Source Initiative. Linux-based operating systems power the company's Azure cloud services. Microsoft acquired GitHub, the largest host for open source project infrastructure, in 2018. Microsoft is among the site's most active contributors. This acquisition lead a few projects to migrate away from GitHub. This proved a short lived phenomenon because by 2019 there were over 10 million new users of GitHub. Since 2018, Microsoft is one of the biggest open source contributors in the world, measured by the number of employees actively contributing to open source projects on GitHub, the largest host of source code in the world.Microsoft may be the world's largest open source contributor, but developers don't care--yetWho really contributes to open source  History  = Initial stance on open source = Altair 8K BASIC on paper tape. In 1976, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates expressed frustration with most computer hobbyists who were using his company's software without having paid for it. The paradigm of freely sharing computer source code‚Äîa practice known as open source‚Äîtraces back to the earliest commercial computers, whose user groups shared code to reduce duplicate work and costs. Following an antitrust suit that forced the unbundling of IBM's hardware and software, a proprietary software industry grew throughout the 1970s, in which companies sought to protect their software products. The technology company Microsoft was founded in this period and has long been an embodiment of the proprietary paradigm and its tension with open source practices, well before the terms \\"free software\\" or \\"open source\\" were coined. Within a year of founding Microsoft, Bill Gates wrote an open letter that positioned the hobbyist act of copying software as a form of theft. Microsoft successfully expanded in personal computer and enterprise server markets through the 1990s, partially on the strength of the company's marketing strategies. By the late 1990s, Microsoft came to view the growing open source movement as a threat to their revenue and platform. Internal strategy memos from this period, known as the Halloween documents, describe the company's potential approaches to stopping open source momentum. One strategy was \\"embrace-extend-extinguish\\", in which Microsoft would adopt standard technology, add proprietary extensions, and upon establishing a customer base, would lock consumers into the proprietary extension to assert a monopoly of the space. The memos also acknowledged open source as a methodology capable of meeting or exceeding proprietary development methodology. Microsoft downplayed these memos as the opinions of an individual employee and not Microsoft's official position. While many major companies worked with open source software in the 2000s, the decade was also marked by a \\"perennial war\\" between Microsoft and open source in which Microsoft continued to view open source as a scourge on its business and developed a reputation as the archenemy of the free and open source movement. Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer likened Linux to a kind of cancer on intellectual property. Microsoft sued Lindows, a Linux operating system that could run Microsoft Windows applications, as a trademark violation. The court rejected the claim and after Microsoft purchased its trademark, the software changed its name to Linspire. In 2002, Microsoft began experimenting with 'shared source', including the Shared Source Common Language Infrastructure, the core of .NET Framework. = Adoption =  2000s  In April 2004, Windows Installer XML (WiX) was the first Microsoft project to be released under an open-source license, the Common Public License. Initially hosted on SourceForge, it was also the first Microsoft project to be hosted externally. In September 2004 Microsoft released its FlexWiki, making its source code available on SourceForge. The engine is open source, also licensed under the Common Public License. FlexWiki was the third Microsoft project to be distributed via SourceForge, after WiX and Windows Template Library (WTL). In 2005, Microsoft released the F# programming language under the Apache License 2.0. In 2006 Microsoft launched its CodePlex open source code hosting site, to provide hosting for open-source developers targeting Microsoft platforms. Microsoft also ported PHP to Windows under PHP License and partnered with Novell to improve open source interoperability in 2006. The Open Source Initiative approved the Microsoft Public License (MS-PL) and Microsoft Reciprocal License (MS-RL) in 2007. Microsoft open sourced IronRuby, IronPython, and xUnit.net under MS-PL in 2007. In 2008, Microsoft joined the Apache Software Foundation.Microsoft Joins Apache Software Foundation Microsoft first began contributing to the Linux kernel in 2009. In 2010, Microsoft Research and Wikipedia joined forces to launch WikiBhasha, an open- source multi-lingual content creation tool for the online encyclopedia.\\"Write wikis in any language with new multilingual content creation tool\\" (Relaxnews story), The Independent, 20 October 2010. Retrieved 10 December 2010.  2010s  Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in 2014 Miguel de Icaza, founding member of the Mono, and Xamarin projects and member of the board of directors of the .NET Foundation In 2014, Satya Nadella was named the new CEO of Microsoft. Microsoft began to adopt open source into its core business. In contrast to Ballmer's stance, Nadella presented a slide that read, \\"Microsoft loves Linux\\". At the time of the acquisition of GitHub, Nadella said of Microsoft, \\"We are all in on open source.\\" As the industry trended towards cloud, embedded, and mobile computing, Microsoft turned to open source to stay apace in these open source dominated fields. Microsoft's adoption of open source included several surprising turns. In 2014, the company opened the source of its .NET Framework to promote its software ecosystem and stimulate cross-platform development. In 2015, Microsoft co-founded the Node.js FoundationMicrosoft moves, with others, to help create the Node.js Foundation and joined the R Foundation. The same year, Microsoft also open sourced Matter Center, Microsoft's legal practice management software and also Chakra, the Microsoft Edge JavaScript engine at the time. Microsoft opened the keynote speech at All Things Open in 2015 by stating that: In 2016, Microsoft introduced Windows Subsystem for Linux, which lets Linux applications run on the Windows operating system. The company invested in Linux server technology and Linux development to promote cross-platform compatibility and collaboration with open source companies and communities, culminating with Microsoft's platinum sponsorship of the Linux Foundation and seat on its Board of Directors. Microsoft released SQL Server and the now open source PowerShell for Linux. Also, Microsoft began porting Sysinternals tools, including ProcDump and ProcMon, to Linux. In March 2016, Ballmer changed his stance on Linux, saying that he supports his successor Satya Nadella's open source commitments. He maintained that his comments in 2001 were right at the time but that times have changed. Commentators have noted the adoption of open source and the change of strategy at Microsoft:Linux and open source have won, get over it Microsoft joined the Open Source Initiative, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, and the MariaDB Foundation in 2017. The Open Source Initiative, formerly a target of Microsoft, used the occasion of Microsoft's sponsorship as a milestone for open source software's widespread acceptance. Also the same year, the Windows development was moved to git and Microsoft open sourced the Git Virtual File System (GVFS) developed for that purpose. Microsoft opened the Microsoft Store to open source applications and gave the keynote speech at the Open Source Summit North America 2017 in Los Angeles. Microsoft delivered the keynote of the 2018 Southern California Linux Expo, a major convention. Microsoft developed Linux-based operating systems for use with its Azure cloud services. Azure Cloud Switch supports the Azure infrastructure and is based on open source and proprietary technology, and Azure Sphere powers Internet of things devices. As part of its announcement, Microsoft acknowledged Linux's role in small devices where the full Windows operating system would be unnecessary. In 2018, Microsoft joined the Open Invention Network and cross-licensed 60,000 patents with the open source community.What does Microsoft joining the Open Invention Network mean for you? Nat Friedman, CEO of Microsoft's GitHub subsidiary, the largest host of source code in the world Also in 2018, Microsoft acquired GitHub, the largest host for open source project infrastructure. Microsoft is among the site's most active contributors and the site hosts the source code for Microsoft's Visual Studio Code and .NET runtime system. The company, though, has received some criticism for only providing limited returns to the Linux community, since the GPL license lets Microsoft modify Linux source code for internal use without sharing those changes. In 2019, Microsoft's Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 transitioned from an emulated Linux kernel to a full Linux kernel within a virtual machine, improving processor performance manifold. In-keeping with the GPL open source license, Microsoft will submit its kernel improvements for accommodation into the master, public release. In 2019, Microsoft included OpenSSH in Windows, released Windows Calculator as open source under MIT License on GitHub, and transitioned its Edge browser to use the open source Chromium as the basis.  2020s  In 2020, Microsoft open sourced the Java extension for Microsoft SQL Server, MsQuic (a Windows NT kernel library for the QUIC general-purpose transport layer network protocol),Microsoft open- sources in-house library for handling QUIC connections  ZDNet Project Petridish, a neural architecture search algorithm for deep learning,Microsoft Open-Sources Project Petridish for Deep-Learning Optimization and the Fluid Framework for building distributed, real-time collaborative web applications.

The formation of women's labor unions in South Korea began in the late 1970s with the Minjung movement, as it is based on the mobilization of young female factory workers and martial law suspended labor rights. Women in South Korea are typically irregular workers, who are not protected by labor laws, make up to 35% less in wages than men, and are less likely to be a union member. The representation of women in leadership positions in unions are also stark with few unions such as the Korean Federation of Trade Unions (KCTU) trying to increase their number of women leaders. The unions that represent women include the Korean Women Workers Association (KWWA) which is under the umbrella organization Korean Women's Associations United (KWAU), Seoul Women's‚Äô Trade union (SWTU), Korean Women's Trade Union (KWTU).  Early Union Activity  Women in Korea began organizing while still under Japanese occupation in the early 20th century. The first documented women-only union organized a strike at the Kyongsong Rubber factory in Seoul to protest the mistreatment of women workers. After Japanese occupation, Korea was ruled by a military dictatorship that closely monitored union activity. In 1970, activist Jeon Tae-il (or Chun Tae-il) committed suicide by self-immolation to protest the treatment of women garment workers. This would spark more union activity.  Minjung movement  See also Minjung = Factory Girls' Movement (Yo'Kong Undong) = Under the rule of General Park Chung-Hee (1961-1979), women who worked in factories dealt with sexual harassment, low wages, poor working conditions, and were targets of police brutality. These women lead the union movement and elected the first woman to the position of union president in 1972. The Garment Makers Union (Chunggye Pibok Union), lead by Lee So Sun, a woman, participated in the union movement and represented 200,000 women employed at Seoul's Peace Market. The YH Union protested the closure of the YH Company, a wig factory, and demanded better working conditions and pay. Women of the union locked themselves in the company building, and the ensuing police raid resulted in the death of Kim Kyoung-sook, who would become a martyr for the movement.  Korean Women Workers Associations United  See also Korean Women Workers Association and Korean Women's Associations United. From 1989 to 1991, the Korean Women Workers Association (KWWA) formed groups in various regions in Korea. In 1992, the regional groups came together to form the Korean Women Workers Associations United (KWWAU). The KWWAU is now made up of 33 other organizations and works with the government to promote the welfare of women workers. Organizations that fall under the KWWAU include the Korean Women's Trade Union (KWTU) and the Korean Women Workers Association (KWWA). The KWWAU has also expanded the issues it deals with. In 2004, they organized the \\"Women Workers Initiative Challenge Against Globalization.\\" In 2001, the KWTU and KWWAU launched a campaign to raise the minimum wage which led to a 12.6% increase per month. = Korean Women's Trade Union = The KWTU formed in 1999 under the umbrella of the Korean Women's Associations United. It is Korea's largest women-only union, with nine branches and approximately 5000 members. KWTU's membership is actually continuing to expand. However, the reach of the KWTU is limited because it, along with other women-only unions, are classified as \\"second\\" unions, which limits their recruitment in workplaces that already have a union. So, KWTU often organizes in workplaces without unions. Members of the union are mostly irregular workers. The KWTU conducts collective bargaining on behalf of its members, education activities, and fundraising activities. The KWTU, along with the SWTU, Korean Congress of Trade Unions (KCTU), and the Federation of Korean Trade Unions (FKTU) joined the Council to Reform the Maternity Protection Act in 2002. The KWTU has also worked with these organizations to change labor legislation to protect independent workers.  Post-Democratization  The Asian Financial Crisis lead to the implementation of neoliberal policies, which lead to a chae-bol centered economy, insecure job market, and increase in migrant workers. = Background = After the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997, South Korea transitioned to neoliberal policies which has led to large companies, or chae-bols, and an insecure job market. The chae-bol centered economy has undermined unions by creating more competitive work environments, through what they call 'New Management Strategy' (shin geyongyeong jeollyak), and deregulating labor by lobbying for easier hiring and firing processes and outsourcing jobs. Irregular workers, who are largely women under 20 and over 60, have been the main participants in unions. The pay discrepancies between male and female irregular workers is large, with women making 40% of the men's hourly wage. Unions such as the FKTU and KCTU have been criticized for their lack of female and precarious worker membership. Various laws have been put into place to protect women from workplace discrimination, including the Gender Equality Law, Gender Discrimination Prevention and Relief Law, and the Public Sector Female Employment Incentive System. In 2000, the Action Center for the Restoration of Irregular Women Worker's Rights was formed to advocate for irregular women workers. = 1998: Hyundai Motors Union = In 1998, after the Hyundai Motors Union went on strike for 14 days in response to a sweep of lay- offs, the union agreed to their employers offer of dismissing 277 workers, 144 of them being women who worked in the cafeteria. These women were fired then re-hired as subcontracted workers, which meant lower wages and less benefits, under the idea that they would be rehired later on. The Hyundai Motors Union did not support the cafeteria workers, so the women went on a hunger strike for 14 days until the union agreed to their demands for direct employment. The women and the union did not have their demands met, and the women would continue working as subcontracted employees. = 1999: Golf Caddies Union = In 1999, the management at the 88 Country Club (88CC) fired gold caddies over the age of 40, claiming it was for the safety of the workers, while the 12 women fired saw it as discrimination, since many of the golf caddies were older women. The KWWAU helped the women form the Chang Po Hoi (Iris Group), who lead a 14-day campaign to get their jobs back. The campaign resulted in all 12 women being rehired. In October 1999, the Chang Po Hoi formed an official union under the KWTU. The management at 88CC would not work with the union because the gold caddies were not classified as legitimate workers. In May 2000, the Ministry of Labor classified them as legitimate workers, which would lead to a bargaining agreement between the union and 88CC management. = 1996-2000: Janitors Union = Janitors, who were mostly women and over the age of 35, at Inha University and Seoul National University were also affected by the outsourcing of jobs. Inha University outsourced the custodial jobs which placed workers under one year contracts, and monthly wages of about 400,000 won. In February 1999, JH cleaning company, one of the companies with contracts with Inha University, changed the wages so that the workers would be paid less, would not get severance pay, would not get bonuses, and have to work at another site. One janitor, Sun-ho, went to the KWTU's Incheon branch, who helped her form the janitor's union in October 2000. The union would go on to negotiate with the university, and when the university denied their requests after five times, the union organized a strike on campus which lead to an increase in wages and benefits. In May 1996, Seoul National University began outsourcing custodial jobs for four years, when all custodial positions, except for those in the main University Administration building were outsourced. Throughout these four years, the workers' wages would gradually get smaller and smaller, and hundreds and thousands of workers were let go. In January 2000, the workers formed the Seoul National University Building Services union. = 2007: E-Land Strike = On July 1, 2007 800 E-Land unionists took over the Homever store in Seoul for almost three weeks to protest E-land's hiring and firing practices that negatively affected the mostly female workers above the age of thirty. During the occupation of the store, police blocked the entrance and eventually ended the occupation, which resulted in solidarity protests and 30 civic organizations condemning the treatment of the unionists. The union would be on strike for 510 days until Samsung Tesco bought the Homever outlet.In 2013, a 22-day strike was organized by the Korean Railroad Corporation Union to protest the tactics of KORAIL. = 2004: KTX Strike = In 2004, KORAIL's KTX bullet train hired 351 female attendants with the promise of job security, when they were actually hired by another sector of the railroad administration on nine month contracts. After hearing of this, almost all of the women joined the Korean Railway Workers Union (KRWU), part of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU), to which KORAIL responded to by firing 280 striking attendants. Union members would continue to protest for the next 12 years, until 180 female attendants were rehired in 2018.

Life Roberts was born into a well-established landed gentry family in County Cork, whose ancestors had settled there from Kent about 1630. His mother was of Scottish origins, descended from the Colonel Stewart who was governor of Edinburgh Castle and took part in the Jacobite rising of 1715.W. F.

A portrait is reported of Roberts and his twin brother at the age of sixteen. He entered TCD in 1833. He was awarded a classical scholarship in 1836, but studied mostly under the notable mathematician and natural philosopher James MacCullagh. On graduating BA in 1838, he was elected a fellow of Trinity, and in 1862 became Erasmus Smith's Professor of Mathematics, a position he held until 1879, when he was elected as Senior Fellow.William Fellows Sedgwick \\"ROBERTS, MICHAEL (1817‚Äì1882), mathematician\\" in Dictionary of National Biography, Volume 48 In 1848 he had been appointed the first Professor of Mathematics at Queen's College, Galway, but he resigned from the position before the college opened to students in 1849. Research Among Roberts's earlier lectures were a series on the Theory of Invariants and Covariants, on which he published papers. Next he took an interest in hyperelliptic integrals, a subject developed by Jacobi, Riemann, and Weierstrass. In 1871 he published a \\"Tract on the Addition of Elliptic and Hyperelliptic Integrals\\", constructing a trigonometry of hyperelliptic functions on the analogy of that of elliptic functions. Roberts discovered many properties of geodesic lines and lines of curvature on the ellipsoid, especially in relation to umbilics, and from 1845 published papers in the Journal de Math√©matiques, the Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal, Nouvelles Annales de Math√©matiques. In 1850 he wrote in the Journal de Math√©matiques of the lines of curvature and asymptotic lines on a surface, at any point of which the sum of the principal curvatures is zero. The International Exhibition of 1851 at Hyde Park displayed a small model ellipsoid, on which the lines of curvature had been traced according to a method Roberts invented. Roberts published several papers on the properties and functions of the roots of algebraic equations, and on covariants and invariants. From 1868 to 1873 he published work in Annali di Matematica, including in 1869 and 1871 two papers on Abelian function. Personal life In 1851, Roberts married Kate Atkin, a daughter of John Drew Atkin, of Merrion Square, Dublin, and they had seven children, three sons and four daughters.

Early life Byrne was born on November 29, 1897, in Roxbury, Boston. He attended Mechanic Arts High School, Burdett College, Boston University, and Suffolk Law School. He passed the bar in 1923 and began practicing law following his graduation the next year. During World War I, he served in the United States Navy. Political career From 1925 to 1929, Byrne represented the 12th Suffolk District in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. In 1928 he was an unsuccessful candidate for Suffolk County Registrar of Deeds. In 1933, Byrne joined the Suffolk County District Attorney's office, where he developed a close relationship with DA William J. Foley. He tried a number of murder cases and beginning in 1942 he exclusively handled grand jury work. A close friend of Governor Paul A. Dever, Byrne was mentioned as a candidate for a number of prominent positions, including Boston Police Commissioner. Foley died on December 1, 1952 and on December 17, Dever appointed Byrne to succeed him. Byrne was chosen despite pressure to give the job to Foley's son, a Boston City Councilor, or another well known political figure. Following his appointment, Byrne gave up his private law practice, making him the first district attorney in Massachusetts not to have any outside business or professional activities. Throughout his tenure as DA, Byrne opposed Boston's Combat Zone. Following the murder of Andrew Puopolo, Byrne received the support of Mayor Kevin White and the Boston Redevelopment Authority and began a crackdown on the vice district. Byrne also established the Suffolk County Investigation and Prosecution Project (SCIPP) to combat organized and white collar crime and the Major Violators Division to expedite to prosecution of violent crimes. SCIPP's work with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives led to convictions of organized crime leaders Raymond L. S. Patriarca, Enrico Tameleo, Peter Limone, and Ilario Zannino and political figures Paul Ellison and George Maitland. Byrne was also the lead prosecutor of the perpetrators of the Great Brink's Robbery, as the federal statute of limitations had expired and only state charges could be brought against the gang. In 1965, Byrne had the Muhammad Ali vs. Sonny Liston fight banned from Boston, calling it a \\"setup\\", \\"unlicensed\\", and a \\"common nuisance.\\" As a result, the fight was moved to Lewiston, Maine.

The focal point of the Caballera vs. Caballera series of shows is one or more traditional Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"Bet matches\\", where all competitors in the match risk their hair on the outcome of the match. The Lucha de Apuestas is considered the most prestigious match type in lucha libre, especially when a wrestlers mask is on the line, but the \\"hair vs. hair\\" stipulation is held in almost as high regard. For the July 2016 Caballera vs. Caballera main event IWRG Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion Mr. Electro faced off against long-time rival M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. Mr. Electro lost the match and as a result, had his hair shaved off afterward. In the semi-final match Trauma I lost to rival Canis Lupus in a match where the storyline was that the winner would win 50.000,00 MEX. In the fourth match of the night El Hijo de Dos Caras defeated Danny Casas to win the IWRG Junior de Juniors Championship. Production =Background= In Lucha libre the wrestling mask holds a sacred place, with the most anticipated and prestigious matches being those where a wrestler's mask is on the line, a so-called Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\" where the loser would be forced to unmask in the middle of the ring and state their birth name. Winning a mask is considered a bigger accomplishment in lucha libre than winning a professional wrestling championship and usually draws more people and press coverage. Losing a mask is often a watershed moment in a wrestler's career, they give up the mystique and prestige of being an enmascarado (masked wrestler) but usually come with a higher than usual payment from the promoter. =Storylines= The event featured six professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Event The opening match saw rookies Drag√≥n Fly and The Tiger defeated Demonio Infernal and Skanda. It appeared that Demonio Infernal was only pinned for a two count, but the referee continued anyway. In the second match Las Tortugas Ninja (Leo, Mike and Rafy) defended the Distrito Federal Trios Championship for the second time in their reign, against Los Insoportables (\\"The Undesirable\\"; Apolo Estrada Jr., Eterno, and Rel√°mpago. Las Tortugas won the third and deciding fall to retain their championship. The third math saw the tecnico team of Chicano, Pantera, and Veneno defeated the trio of Herodes Jr., Toscano, and Trauma I where the focal point of the match was an ongoing storyline feud between Veneno and Trauma II. Danny Casas defended the IWRG Junior de Juniors Championship for the first time since he won it four months prior. During the math El Hijo de Dos Caras made it clear that he was now portraying a rudo as he cheated to win both the first and third fall to win the championship. The semi-final match continued to build on a long-running storyline feud between Trauma I and Canis Lupus that had been going on for months prior. For the match, IWRG made it a one fall match, where the winner supposedly would get 50.000 pesos. In the end, Trauma I was disqualified as the referee saw him foul Canis Lupus. The main event Lucha de Apuestas match between M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. and Mr. Electro immediately turned into a brawl between the two rivals, leading to both wrestlers bleeding profusely by the end of the match. Mr. Electro won the first fall, with M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. winning the second to push the match to a third and deciding fall. During the last fall, both wrestlers used a beer bottle as a weapon, accidentally knocking the referee down. Moments later M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. broke the bottle over Mr. Electro's head and pinned him as a second referee ran to the ring to count to three.

D. Spradlin, released in 1986. Plot In 1972, Major Kendall Laird (John Lithgow) as a Survivors Assistance officer, is charged with helping the families of soldiers killed in action for as long as he may be needed. He is escorting the remains of Dwight Johnson, an Army Lieutenant, for delivering them to his parents Luther (Morgan Freeman) and Ada (CCH Pounder) at Rockville, Georgia, which he estimates will be a short duty, and one in which he will have nothing really helpful to do. The funeral is prevented from taking place because, despite desegregation being legally in effect since years ago, the town still is deeply segregationist, and its authorities refuse the deceased to be interred in the local \\"for caucasians only\\" cemetery. They propose Lt. Johnson's burial to take place in the cemetery for Blacks located in the outskirts of the town, notwithstanding his unit has recommended him for the Silver Star. The Lieutenant's parents refuse to give in, and they are willing to have his son's body kept in their church's safeguard until the town and cemetery's authorities change their minds. Major Laird searches for a way to break the impasse with the help of Eudora McCallister (Frances Sternhagen), the lady who sold the Johnsons a plot of her property in the cemetery, and the local newspaper's editor Sam Jennings (G. D. Spradlin). This one suggests that telling the Lieutenant's story would effect a change, so the Major starts an informal quest for biographical data. His first interviews with family and acquaintances reveal the young Lt. Johnson was an extraordinary man, but the interviews with the soldiers of his unit suggest there was something wrong in the way the Lieutenant was killed, given that in their telling of the events they keep repeating the same words as if rehearsed, and one of them plainly refuses to talk without legal counsel. After many attempts and trying several approaches, Major Laird has to draw upon his own dormant self-assurance and authority to force the soldiers to reveal what happened exactly. The death of the Lieutenant resulted from his unit ultimately mistrusting his command abilities because of his race, and their recommendation for the decoration came from their guilt, as the lieutenant died saving their lives. Finally, as the story comes to light, Lieutenant Dwight Johnson gets the funeral with full military honors he deserved as a decorated war hero, in the grave his parents had chosen for him, not without a final confrontation with the recalcitrant local authorities.

Description  This small anemone has a diameter of 10‚Äì15 millimetres with a range of colours that can appear to be iridescent. When underwater it extends short, fine, smooth tentacles that are 2‚Äì5 millimetres long with rounded tips. These are arranged in three to four crowded whorls along the edge of the disc. The inner tentacles can be twice as long as the outer tentacles. Tentacle colour can range between light yellow and deep brown and often feature green, blue or red tinges. Its central disc can be a similar colour to the tentacles or a contrasting colour such as white, purple or orange and usually features radial markings. Its mouth can be light blue, bright pink or purple, and often has a lighter colour on the interior. The anemone's column is usually a deep brown colour, but can also be green, blue, or yellow.

Malmberg critically examined the ideas of fasting, naturopathy, vegetarianism, low-protein diets, Gayelord Hauser's Eliminative Feeding System, Hay diet, mucusless diet and many others. A review in the Journal of the American Medical Association concluded that \\"the book may well be recommended by all physicians to patients who are interested in being disillusioned relative to the fallacies that recur again and again in the field of nutrition.\\" The American Journal of Clinical Pathology, commented that \\"this excellent expose of fads and fadists who have plied their trade on the unsuspecting public is well worth reading. Physicians can do a real service for their patients by seeing that they procure a copy of it.\\" A 1937 review in The Philippine Journal of Science described the book as a \\"startling revelation of the different diet fads and medicinal frauds that are now found in the market... In this book one will find many popular diets in vogue in America, criticized severely and their inconsistencies and dangers clearly presented.\\" Publications Nonfiction *Diet and Die (New York: Hillman-Curl Inc, 1935) *140 Million Patients: The Revealing Facts Behind Health and Medical Care in America (New York: Reynal & Hitchcock, 1947) *America is Also Scandinavian (New York: G.

Her work has been exhibited at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston and the Frist Art Museum, and is included in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  Life  Lucy T. Pettway was the fourth of 14 children born to Mary Ann and Tom O. Pettway. She farmed on her family's property and spent the rest of her life primarily farming and quilting. Her family's farm harvested common crops like cotton, corn, peas, peanuts, sugarcane, and millet (sorghum). Much like her father's assistant, Lucy was a reliable farmhand, doing work like plowing that the other girls were not allowed to do. Her schooling was augmented by the harvesting seasons. She typically went to school between the very end of November and the beginning of March. She stopped attending school at the age of twenty because by then she was already married, with one child, and had only progressed to the fifth grade. In Gee's Bend, however, this was normal and she recalled many people older than her in her final fifth grade class. Wilcox County built a dam near Miller's Ferry, which flooded her family's 10 acres, thus destroying their farm. After that, Lucy spent most of her time piecing quilts.  Work  Lucy began making quilts under her mother's and aunts' instruction when she was twelve years old. The first quilt she completed was in the locally named \\"Lazy Gal\\" style, which consisted of long strips sewn vertically. The second style she created was a \\"Nine Patch,\\" which is nine separately designed quilt rectangles pieced together. Initially, like most young quilters, her primary material was repurposed clothing. Lucy T.'s Great-Aunt Lucy worked for a white employer in Camden, Alabama. They gave her a quilting book which contained numerous, detailed patterns. From this book, Lucy T. learned patterns rarely seen in other Gee's Bend quilts, such as \\"Stars,\\" \\"Monkey Wrench,\\" \\"Snowball,\\" etc. Her oeuvre in the Souls Grown Deep Foundation collection is incredibly diverse, boasting more than 10 different pattern types in a 14 quilt collection. Never one to idle, Lucy brought material to piece and quilt into the fields with her if she ever had spare time. She always made new blocks and patterns during her lunch breaks. She did not stop quilting until her mid-70's when she developed high blood pressure, which made it incredibly hard for her to focus on her patterns. She described her \\"head swimming\\" from her illness. Lucy died at the age of 83.  References  1921 births 2004 deaths 20th-century American women artists ","title":"Lucy T.

It burrows into soft mud or sand, and when covered with water extends its tentacles to feed on tiny particles of detritus.  Distribution and habitat  E. neozelanica is found in New Zealand, in intertidal areas such as harbour mouths or rock pools where silt and mud accumulates. Being small and so similar in colour to the substrate it lives in, E. neozelanica is a cryptic species most often found when sand or mud is passed through a fine sieve.  Description  Illustrations of E. neozelanica by Farquhar that accompanied its 1898 description. The tentacle- fringed capitulum and three-part body can be clearly seen. This tiny anemone has a diameter of just 5 millimetres and a length of 30‚Äì50 millimetres. Its long worm-like body is divided into three parts: physa, scapus, and capitulum. The physa is a bulbous bladder-like organ covered with tiny suckers, used in burrowing. The scapus or body column is wrinkly and covered with a rough cuticle that can be brown, grey, or orange in colour, with a narrow neck at the top connecting it to the capitulum or oral end. E. neozelanica has on its capitulum sixteen or more transparent tentacles, usually in two whorls of eight, that are pinkish white to buff yellow or brown in colour. Each tentacle in the outer whorl corresponds with one of eight brown lines that originate on the scapus as longitudinal double white lines.  Behaviour and diet  This worm-like sea anemone thrusts its body into soft mud or sand before anchoring itself in place by slightly swelling its body column. Only its oral disc and tentacles are visible above the silt. It feeds on organic detritus, extending its fine tentacles across the surface of the sediment.

History  Vampire amoebae were first discovered in 1865 by Leon Cienkowski.Cienkowski, L. (1865). Beitr√§ge zur kenntniss der monaden. Archiv F√ºr Mikroskopische Anatomie, 1(1), 203-232. doi:10.1007/BF02961414 These amoebae were given the genus name Vampyrella due to their bright red colouration and their distinct feeding habits in which they perforate the cell wall of their host and draw out the inner contents of the cell, resembling that of folklore vampires. At present, the vampyrellids are placed taxonomically in the cercozoan subphylum Endomyxa along with some soil dwelling taxa.Hess, S., Sausen, N., & Melkonian, M. (2012). Shedding light on vampires: The phylogeny of vampyrellid amoebae revisited. PLOS One, 7(2), e31165. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0031165 The clade within Endomyxa, Vampyrellida West, 1901, consists of the genera Theratomyxa, Platyreta, ‚ÄòArachnula‚Äô, Leptophrys and Vampyrella. Molecular sequence data exist for two families: Vampyrellidae and Leptophyridae. Frequently, Vampyrella is the only genus represented in Vampyrellidae.  Organism and life stages  Most members of Vampyrella obligatorily alternate between a free living trophozoite stage and cyst stage. In the trophozoite stage amoebae are free moving. Vampyrella is characterized by a roughly spherical shape, however, it often changes shapeLeidy, J., Biodiversity Heritage Library, & Canadian Libraries. (1879).

Observations on \\"Vampyrella penula-Stylodinium sphaera\\" and the ultrastructure of the reproductive cyst. American Journal of Botany, 73(9), 1341-1350. doi:10.2307/2444068 Numerous long colourless pseudopodia extend in all directions giving trophozoites an isodiametric morphotype. These pseudopodia can be as long as three times the diameter of the cell body and may be branched or unbranched. The pseudopodia may accumulate in the direction in which the organism moves. Shorter, slow moving, pin-like pseudopodia are projected and withdrawn very quickly from the cell body in addition to having longer pseudopodia. Many vacuoles can sometimes be seen in the periphery of the organi in addition to large, bubble-like non-contractile vacuoles. Young trophozoites range from about 25-40um, while mature trophozoites can reach to about 70um. Organisms tend to have multiple spherical nuclei with a central compact nucleolus. Some species of Vampyrella have been observed to fuse with each other to form large plasmodia with the same structure and colouration as a single free-living cell. This has been observed when food has been limited. = Cyst stage = Following the trophozoite stage, cells enter an obligatory digestive and a later reproductive cyst stage. Cysts tend to appear roundish or elliptical and flattened on the side attached to a substrate. Cysts range from 50 to 100um in size. During digestion the cyst will turn from green to red, orange or brown colours. The cyst is covered in two envelopes. The outer envelope is softer and used to attach to a substrate such as filamentous food (algae). A stalk may or may not be present. The inner envelope is stronger and surrounds the cell while cell division takes place. After cell division, the daughter cells leave the cyst envelope leaving behind food remnants. During unfavourable conditions the cell may enter into a resting phase. Sex is currently unknown in the genus. = Mitosis = Orthomitosis in Vampyrella occurs late in the cyst stage. Neither microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs) nor centrioles are present during mitosis. While in the trophozoite life stage and early cyst stage, the cell is in interphase. Heterochromatin decrease upon entering the cyst stage as the cell prepares for mitosis. The spherical nuclei increase in size from 1.5-2.0 um in the trophozoite stage to 2.5-3.5 um. The pars granulosa becomes more prominent within the cyst and the components begin to mix with the pars fibrosa. During prophase, chromosomes are condensed and bundles of microtubules appear on either side of the nuclei. The nucleolus begins to disintegrate within the nucleus. In metaphase, the nucleus takes on a cylindrical shape. Centric mitotic spindles do not reach the poles of the nucleus. The compacted chromosomes then create an equatorial plate with microtubules running through the plate. No kinetochores are present. Vesicles begin to accumulate near the chromosomes and the inner membrane of the intact nuclear envelope. The chromatids separate and the nuclei elongate in anaphase. This is followed by an increase in vesicles on the inner membrane. During telophase, the nuclei form a dumbbell shape. Vesicles begin to fuse around the chromosomes to form a new nuclear envelope as the older envelope disintegrates. After karyokinesis, the cell undergoes cytokinesis. At this point the nuclei are already spherical and resemble that of mature trophozoites.  Habitat and predation  Vampyrellids can be found in a wide variety of habitats, soil, freshwater or marine, but members of Vampyrella tend to be found in freshwater environments. Vampire amoebae of this genus are heterotrophic and feed on algae, notably Spirogyra Lloyd, F. E. (1926). Some features of structure and behavior in Vampyrella lateritia. Science, 63(1631), 364-365. doi:10.1126/science.63.1631.364 but also Chaetophora or Mougeotia. When attacking, the Vampyrella organism flattens along the filament surface of its prey. Upon attachment, the long pseudopodia disappear leaving only shorter pin-like pseudopodia. A violent shock motion is usually observed as the Vampyrella attacks the algae. Within minutes cell wall digestion initiates and the vampyrellid begins to swell as the contents of the algae are drained. The cell wall begins to bend inward due to a loss in turgor pressure causing adjacent cells of the algae to have greater pressure. Upon fully digesting through the cell wall, a hole is created in the cell wall of the algae. The vampyrellid swells rapidly and the prey cell disarticulates. The protoplast of the prey is then sucked out into a food vacuole. Remaining contents are then drawn out using pseudopodia. The vampyrellid uses its pseudopodia to move from cell to cell repeating the process. Excess water absorbed from prey cells is removed by numerous small contractile vacuoles on the periphery of the organism, maintaining an only slightly increased size after each meal. Vampyrella have been observed to both perforate the cell wall on the cell body as well as breaking the joints between algal cells to acquire the contents of the cell. Vampyrella have also shown to be selective of food type. Once in contact with filaments, it brings its body toward the filament. If the algae are rejected it will move on. Among this selectivity, there is also differences among species within the genus. This has been observed as Vampyrella lateritia refuse to eat Oedogonium while it will be eaten by Vampyrella pendula.  Ecology  Vampyrella are known to be algivorous predators which can be detrimental to the biomass of microalgal cultures. Some green microalgae are capable of rapid growth and synthesize large quantities of protein, starch and lipid. In addition, microalgae can be used in carbon capture, animal feeding, waste water bioremediation and biofuels. The main cause in loss of microalgal culture biomass is microbial contamination.Gong, Y., Patterson, D. J., Li, Y., Hu, Z., Sommerfeld, M., Chen, Y., & Hu, Q. (2015).

Biography A native of Yonkers, New York, Waring was the daughter of hat manufacturer John T. Waring; her father was the original builder of Greystone, later to become the home of Samuel J. Tilden and Samuel Untermyer. For much of her life she was active in the affairs of the Episcopal Church, serving on the Westchester County branch of the women's auxiliary of the board of missions, and chairing the women's auxiliary of St. John's Protestant Episcopal Church; at one time she was vice- chairman of the women's auxiliary of the Episcopal Diocese of New York. She was a member of the Colony Club of New York and the Society of Mayflower Descendants. Interested in the history of stenciling, she compiled a large collection of stencil designs taken from rooms and furniture. Her research, along with that of Esther Stevens Brazer, was instrumental in reviving interest in the art of stenciling in the twentieth century, some years after it had gone out of fashion. Her 1937 book, Early American Stencils on Walls and Furniture, has been called \\"seminal\\" and \\"definitive\\" in the field. Waring died in Yonkers after a long illness. She is buried at Woodlawn Cemetery. A collection of Waring's photographs of stencils, likely made in connection with the publication of her book in 1937, is held by the Archives of American Art of the Smithsonian Institution; it contains images of work by Moses Eaton, Jr., William Eaton, Ivers White, George Lord, Lambert Hitchcock, Jarred Johnson, and Thomas Jefferson Gildersleeve.

It requires an understanding of the different types of historic firearms and knowledge in the care and treatment of organic and inorganic materials, as firearms are composed of many types of materials, from wood to metal, that are fitted together. History The term historic firearm refers to armaments used prior to the 20th Century. Firearms vary greatly in type, function, firing mechanisms, and decorative elements. Firearms are composite objects, meaning they are made of different materials Storch, P., Tech Talk Part I, Curatorial Care of Firearms, Minnesota Historical Society, 1998. https://www.connectingtocollections.org/wp- content/uploads/2016/03/TechTalkSeptember1998.pdf/ Generally, the core components of historic firearms are metal (iron, steel, brass) and wood. Decorative elements may include other metals like gold or silver, and organic materials such as bone, antler, and ivory. Animal hide and sinew may also have been used to repair damaged firearms or build a new weapon using multiple parts. Historic firearms are identified by barrel style, how they are loaded, and by lock, the firing mechanism. Firearms can first be classified by the barrel style which is described as either a smoothbore or rifle. The barrel of a smoothbore has a smooth interior whereas a rifle barrel has a helical grove cut into it Historic firearms may be grouped based on how they are loaded; they will be referred to as muzzle-loaded or breech-loaded. Muzzle-loaded firearms are loaded through the front end of the barrel National Park Service, Conserve O Gram, Caring for Historic Longarms: Storage and Handling Requirements, 1999. https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/10-01.pdf/ and were typically left loaded and ready for use White, P. R., The Care and Preservation of Firearms, Canadian Conservation Institute Technical Bulletin 16, 1995. http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2016/pch/NM95-55-16-1995-eng.pdf/ A muzzle-loaded firearm means that a lock was used to hold and ignite the gunpower which fired the gun. Breech-loaded firearms, first introduced in the 16th century, are loaded with cartridges or shells through the rear of the barrel and have a variety of ignition switches. A third way historic firearms can also be categorized is by their firing mechanism known as a lock. Several types of locks have been developed over the centuries; however, the most common types found in the United States are the matchlock, wheel-lock, flintlock, and percussion cap. =Types of Historic Firearms= The earliest lock was the Matchlock that used a match to ignite the powder. These were smoothbore and muzzle-loaded. The Harquebus (Arquebus) and muskets prior to the 17th century are two examples of a matchlock The Wheellock, was developed around 1500, used a spring loaded wheel to create an ignition. Like the matchlock, wheel-locks were smoothbore and muzzle-loaded. Muskets and pistols were made with the wheel-lock. Developed in the 17th century, the Flintlock used a flint strike to ignite the gunpower and fire the weapon. Flintlocks were used for a variety of firearms, ranging from pistols to muskets and rifles. Their barrels could be smoothbore or rifle and were muzzle-loaded or breech-loaded. The Percussion Cap was introduced in the early 1800s and eventually replaced the flintlock. The percussion cap lock was very similar to the flintlock and many flintlocks were converted into percussion caps. Percussion cap firearms were muzzle-loaded, but as with flintlocks, they could have a smooth or rifled barrel. Agents of Deterioration and Preventative Conservation Agents of deterioration are the forces that cause physical, chemical, and biological damage and lead to irreversible losses to museum collections National Park Service: Museum Handbook, Part I, Chapter 4, 2012. Preventative conservators work to maintain the health of museum collections by taking steps to prevent or reduce the effects of agents of deterioration on objects. =Physical Forces= Physical forces may damage objects directly or cause indirect damage through the collision between the object and parts or other objects Canadian Conservation Institute, Agents of Deterioration: Physical Forces, 2018. https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation- institute/services/agents-deterioration/physical-forces.html/ Damage to objects is the result of five possible physical forces: impact, shock, vibration, abrasion, and pressure. For historic firearms the highest risk of damage is from impact. If not held properly, there is a risk that the firearm may be dropped or bumped into surrounding objects or fixtures. Impact damage can also happen if the firearm is not mounted correctly when it is on display and it falls. Damage from impact may cause cracking, breaking, and chipping of wood and other organic materials; and may dent, scratch, or break off metal components. To reduce the risk of damage by physical forces, historic firearms should be supported with both hands and held in front of the body, have proper display mounts, and be stored in appropriate cases padded with microfoam. The person handling the firearm should exercise caution and be aware of his/her surroundings when moving the object to avoid bumping it into other firearms, objects, or fixtures. =Incorrect Temperature= Incorrect temperature can damage the wood components. A combination of long-term or excessive light exposure with high temperatures will cause the wood to crack and lose its shape. High temperatures will have a similar effect on rawhide and semi-tanned leather, ivory, bone, and antler. To slow the process of deterioration, historic firearms should be kept at temperatures kept below 72F =Incorrect Relative Humidity= Relative humidity affects both the wood and metal components of firearms. Too low of a humidity can cause the wood and other organic material to dry and crack. Humidity that is too high, above 65%, can cause the wood to swell, can corrode the metal, and conducive to mold growth. The preferred range for relative humidity is between 45% and 50%; however, accounting for seasonal changes an acceptable range is 35% to 60%. The preferred range of relative humidity for antler, bone, and ivory is 45% to 55% Canadian Conservation Institute, Care of Ivory, Bone, Horn, and Antler, 2019. https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/conservation- preservation-publications/canadian-conservation-institute-notes/care-ivory- bone-horn-antler.html / Rawhide or semi-tanned leather, if used on the firearm, is also affected by humidity. Animal hide will absorb moisture creating an ideal habitat for mold growth and if the humidity is too low, the hide will split or potentially damage the firearm. As with antler, bone, and ivory, animal hide is most stable with a relative humidity of 45% to 55% Canadian Conservation Institute, Care of Rawhide and Semi-tanned Leather, 2019. https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/conservation- preservation-publications/canadian-conservation-institute-notes/care-rawhide- semi-tanned-leather.html / =Water= Water is damaging to most historic objects. For historic firearms, water will cause corrosion of metal components, swell wood, and encourage mold growth. Water will also cause antler, bone, and ivory to swell. Animal rawhide and semi-tanned leather will absorb moisture and will be at risk for mold growth. It could also become discolored. Historic firearms should be stored away or protected from potential water sources, such as exposed water pipes or off the ground if there is a risk of flooding. =Fire= Historic firearms are at risk for damage if they are exposed to fire and can result in the loss of the object. Wood and other organic materials will burn, and metal may melt or become disfigured. If the firearm has not been checked for residual gunpowder or lodged ammunition and is still loaded, the fire may ignite the gunpowder and result in an accidental discharge. Firearms should be kept away from combustible chemicals and objects. =Light, UV, Infrared= High light levels are harmful to the organic materials found on historic firearms. Long term or high intensity exposure to light will cause darkening or fading of wood, ivory, bone, and antler, depending on the material. Exposure to UV light will fade and bleach wood, and infrared light will dry and fade the wood components. To prevent damage from light exposure, UV filters can be used on lights and window and display glass. Light sources for display cases should be positioned outside of the case. After reaching the maximum exposure of 100 lux for eight hours per day, six days a week for a year, the historic firearm should be removed from display and stored in a box or cabinet. =Pests= Pests are insects and animals that disfigure, damage, and destroy museum collections Canadian Conservation Institute, Agents of Deterioration: Pests, 2018. https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/agents- deterioration/pests.html / The organic materials on historic firearms are susceptible to pest infestation. Woodboring beetles and rodents are a threat to the wood materials. Bone, antler, ivory, and rawhide or semi-tanned leather attract Dermestidae, as the black carpet beetle and black larder beetle which feed on protein. Firearm collections should be monitored for evidence of borings, larva castings, and gnaw marks. Regular cleaning of the firearm and display area will help to prevent a pest infestation. =Pollutants= Pollutants are environmental agents, chemical or physical, that can alter the aesthetic appearance or damage objects Canadian Conservation Institute, Agents of Deterioration: Pollutants, 2018. https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/agents- deterioration/pollutants.html/ Dust, composed of dirt, fibers, skin cells, and pollen, is a common pollutant, but if not removed can lead to damage. On historic firearms, dust will absorb moisture, attract pests, and abrade the surface. Regular cleaning will reduce the build-up of dust and other particulate matter. Other pollutants will react chemically with the object, potentially causing permanent damage. Improper storage or display materials can react to the metal components and cause corrosion. One material that should not be stored with firearms is leather which will corrode the metal as it off-gases. Storage and display materials can be tested using the Oddy Test to determine if they will react to the firearm's components. =Disassociation= Disassociation is the loss of data, objects, or association between objects Canadian Conservation Institute, Agents of Deterioration: Disassociation, 2019. https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation- institute/services/agents-deterioration/dissociation.html / It can occur when documentation is lost, objects or their parts are damaged or removed and lost. With historic firearms, disassociation can happen when the weapon is disassembled for cleaning or the firing pins are removed to deter theft or accidental firing. Without proper labeling and tracking, the parts may be lost. Serial numbers and maker's marks can be removed if the firearm is cleaned with abrasive chemicals. To prevent disassociation, all components should be labeled, serial numbers noted, and if the part is removed its location should be recorded. When cleaning the firearm, appropriate cleaning agents and waxes should be used to prevent the loss of historical data. =Thieves and Vandals= In the United States, historic firearms do not need to be registered and are a popular collector's item, making them potential targets for theft. To deter theft museums may decide to remove the firing pin, thus making the gun inoperable and less desirable to thieves. When on display, firearms should be kept in cases made of acrylic, polycarbonate, or safety glass, and they should be locked or screwed shut. In storage areas firearms should also be locked in a secure area or in metal drawer units and, there should be a minimal number of keys available to unlock display or storage cases The keys also should not be easily replicated. If the firearms are used for research, researchers should be monitored by staff and not be allowed coats or backpacks in the research area because some historic firearms are quite small and could easily fit in a coat pocket. Handling Proper handling is important to preventing damage to historic firearms. Gloves, either nitrile or white cotton, should be worn every time the firearm is handled as the natural oils, salts, and acids from skin can cause corrosion on the metal surfaces Nebraska State Historical Society, Gerald R. Ford Conservation Center: Caring for your firearms, 2017.https://history.nebraska.gov/sites/history.nebraska.gov/files/divisions- doc/Caring%20for%20Historic%20Firearms.pdf Longarms should not be carried by the wrist of the stock and should instead be kept in front of the body and supported by both hands . As a safety precaution, firearms should be checked to make sure they are not loaded. For breech-loading firearms, after opening the action, a light should be shined down the barrel or a small mirror used to look at the breech to see if the barrel is blocked. A conservator should be contacted if the barrel is blocked and the cartridge cannot be easily removed. To check muzzle-loading firearms, a cleaning rod is inserted down the barrel and marked, the rod is then removed and aligned with the muzzle. If the difference between where the rod is marked and the touch hole is greater than 1.5 inches, the barrel is most likely loaded and a conservator should be consulted. Storage Historic firearms should be stored away from pollutants such as wool or silk which contain sulfur and leather, each of which will corrode metal as it off-gases. Small firearms and long arms can be stored in acid-free boxes and should be supported or cushioned with polyethylene foam or acid free tissue. Long arms can also be stored in boxes and supported like small firearms. If, however; the longarms cannot be stored in boxes, they should be stored vertically with barrels down and padded with polyethlene foam. The firearms should be stored with the locks upright. Environment The environment in which historic objects are held greatly impacts their overall long-term health. For historic firearms it is important to recognize that because of their composite nature, each material will respond differently to environmental stresses which can in turn affect adjacent surfaces. Generally, the acceptable environmental controls of historic firearms are a relative humidity between 35 and 50% and a temperature below 72¬∞. Although their tolerances may vary, UV and infrared light will damage the materials of historic firearms and should be monitored. Treatment The conservation of historic firearms requires knowledge of the care and treatment of organic and inorganic materials. Treatment can range from simple cleaning to conservation- restoration and return to firing capabilities. Prior to treatment, three factors should be considered: has the source of the damage been eliminated, what is the extent of the damage, and what are the long-term effects of the treatment. General guidelines for conservation treatment of any object is to make sure the treatment is reversible, treatments and materials should be chemically and physically compatible, and the treatment must use stable chemicals that will not off-gas or react with the object creating further deterioration. Other than general cleaning as part of a museum's housekeeping routine, treatment should be performed by a conservator. =Cleaning= Cleaning historic firearms begins with an examination of its condition to ensure it can withstand the cleaning procedure. A partial disassembly may be necessary; however, it is not recommended for matchlocks and wheellocks as their screws and pins are not easily removed. Loose dust and dirt can be removed with a soft brush, such as a hake brush, and the debris directed toward a vacuum nozzle. Commercial cleaning products and varnishes, and brass and silver polishes should be avoided as these items may damage the firearm. Sometimes conservation grade waxes, like Renaissance wax, are used to improve the firearm's appearance and guard against dust. =Conservation- Restoration= Conservation-restoration work on historic firearms is a series of procedures designed to stabilize, repair or restore parts, and stop deterioration. Stabilizing a firearm means establishing the ideal environment conditions, removing corrosion, replacing missing components, and repairing broken parts. For example, if the wrist of a long arm is cracked, a conservator would repair the breakage which would stabilize the firearm, enabling its use for display or research. The goal of restoration work may be returning the firearm to original form, returning all the mechanical components to working order, or returning it to firing capabilities. Conservation-restoration of historic firearms requires the skilled work of a conservator.

He was trained in Uday Shankar's school of modern dance. He is regarded as a pioneer in modern Indian dance. For his contributions to the field, he received the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award for Contemporary Choreography in 1976.  Early life  Narendra Sharma was born on 21 September 1924 in Bulandshahar, Uttar Pradesh. He ran away from home at a young age to enrol in Uday Shankar's cultural centre at Almora, where he was mentored by Uday Shankar and Zohra Sehgal. He was initially denied admission due to his young age. In a 2002 interview, Sharma recalled: \\"They asked me to get the consent of my guardian, but I had closed all doors behind me. When that night I was sitting on a footpath, Dada (Pt Uday Shankar) called me over. He registered my zeal and accepted me as a student. I was the youngest in Dada‚Äôs first batch of students who were taught contemporary Indian ballet at Almora.\\"  Career  Sharma started his career in Bombay, where he came under the influence of the Indian People's Theatre Association. His early experiments in choreography were in collaboration with Sachin Shankar, a nephew of Uday Shankar's. In 1954, he moved to Delhi and started his long association with Modern School, New Delhi, as full-time dance teacher. Sharma's move to Delhi was the result of an invitation from the school at the express desire of principal M. N. Kapur. Working with children and adolescents, he cboreographed over 300 productions. During the early years in Delhi, Sharma also worked with the Shriram Bharatiya Kala Kendra and helped to create the Ramlila. In the late 1960s, he taught dance for two years at the University of Washington. In 1972, he set up an independent dance group, Bhoomika. In the 1980s he choreographed several major public performances, e.g. at the opening ceremony of the 1982 Asian Games. After his retirement from Modern School, Sharma continued to train students and choreograph productions, and remained active as a dancer even in his late seventies. He died on 14 January 2008.

At its peak, Dan-Air employed 4,500 people and flew more than six million passengers a year. In 1961, the company, by then headquartered at 36/38, New Broad Street, London EC2, announced that it was forming a new department to charter tonnage for dry cargo business and that L. H. R. Rigg, a chartered surveyor, had been appointed as its manager.Fairplay Weekly Shipping Journal, Vol. 200 (1961), p. 21 By 1971, the original company was still active in shipping and aviation, the shipping activities conducted directly by the Company, the aviation activities through Dan-Air Services Limited, trading as Dan-Air, and had several other subsidiaries. In that year, Frederick Newman, as Chairman, supported by John Wingett Davies (1908‚Äì1991), Deputy Chairman, the son of the other founding partner, Captain Davies, announced that the company was to be floated on the London Stock Exchange, with its ownership to be transferred into a new public company called Davies and Newman Holdings Limited. Having quoted shares would bring financial openness, greater respect, and an injection of new capital, with the result that services were expanded. Position in 1971 Hambros Bank floated the new Davies and Newman Holdings Limited by an initial public offering in October 1971, when the offer was of 1,133,000 ordinary shares of 25p each in the new company, priced at 130 pence per share, payable in full on application. The position of the existing Davies and Newman company in 1971 was outlined by the Chairman as follows: ;Shipping Shipping activities, managed directly by Davies and Newman, were largely based on the company's long-standing connections with major oil companies and with Norwegian and other shipowners. The shipping activities were conducted through: *The Tanker Chartering Department, accounting for some 80 per cent of the turnover on shipping activities, had close working links with major British oil companies and with connections in Scandinavia, New York, Paris, Tokyo, Lisbon, Greece, Italy, and other parts of the world. The business negotiated ranged from single voyage charters, on which the Company received a single commission, to long-term charters and consecutive-voyage charters, lasting between one and twenty years, with commission paid in instalments over the period. Twenty-year time charters for two tankers, each of about 470,000 tons, had recently been arranged. *General Chartering Department: as a member of the Baltic Exchange, the company had recently formed this Department to deal wilh the chartering of dry cargo vessels and bulk-carriers. *Sale and Purchase Department: the Company acted as agents for the placing of shipbuilding contracts and for buying and selling second-hand ships, dealing with all types of vessels, from trawlers to ocean liners, negotiating their sale or purchase, either for trading purposes or for breaking-up. *Ships Agency Department: acting on behalf of Shell, Texaco, and other owners, handling tankers calling in the River Thames, at Thameshaven and Canvey Island, with more than 500 vessels handled each year. ;Aviation Aviation Activities began in the early 1950s as an Air Broking Department within Davies and Newman, and in 1953 Dan-Air was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary, to deal with all such business. *The package holiday business was most of the aviation activity, under contracts varying in length from one to five years, with Clarksons, Lunn Poly, Global, and other tour operators. Dan-Air's share of the British airlines' package holiday business was estimated to be about 14 per cent in 1970, and it was about 80 per cent of the company's aviation turnover. Spain was the main package holiday destination, with flights also to Italy, Greece, Yugoslavia, Germany, Switzerland, and other countries. A Dan-Air Comet 4 *Scheduled services included the ‚ÄúLink City‚Äù service between Bristol, Cardiff, Liverpool, Manchester, and Newcastle, and since June 1971 there was also a service between Leeds and Glasgow; the overseas scheduled services were between Liverpool and Amsterdam and between Newcastle and Southern Norway. In November 1970, Dan-Air had obtained a Civil Aeronautics Board permit, usually valid for five years, to operate charter flights to the United States, which had begun in February 1971. *Dan-Air's present fleet included Comets, BAC One-Elevens, and a Boeing 707: a further BAC One-Eleven and a second Boeing 707 had been ordered for delivery in early 1972. *In 1970 the total number of passenger flights was about 750,000 and this figure was expected to be higher in 1971. *Dan-Air had its main operational base at Gatwick Airport, with subsidiary bases at Luton and Manchester, and also provided facilities for its own and other British and foreign airlines‚Äô aircraft at Newcastle, Teesside, Liverpool, Bristol, and Cardiff. ;Other subsidiaries *Dan-Air Engineering was a wholly owned subsidiary mainly engaged in servicing and maintaining Dan- Air's aircraft at Lasham Airfield in Hampshire, but also undertaking outside contracts. Since 1955 this company had had approval by the Air Registration Board to carry out approved maintenance, and this approval now applied to all types of piston-engined aircraft and some types of jet. Mr. B. V. S. Williams, aged 53, was the Managing Director and had joined the Group in 1956. *Davies and Newman Travel Limited, another wholly owned subsidiary, had a shop in the City of London selling inclusive tour holidays. *The Group also had interests in airline support activities, including a car hire company at Gatwick, a bonded store at Gatwick (Dan-Air Bonded Store Limited, 50 percent) and flight kitchens at Bristol and Teesside. ;Employees and premises In October 1971 the Group had about eighty employees on the shipping side and about 1,200 on the aviation side, including about 220 pilots and flight engineers, about 200 air- hostesses, about 450 ground engineers, and about 300 other ground staff. The Group had its head offices of some 11,400 square feet at Bilbao House, 36/38 New Broad Street, London, EC2M 1NH, and it also occupied other offices in London of some 8,200 square feet, plus others at Thameshaven, the base of the Ships Agency Department. Dan-Air Engineering Limited had a lease expiring in 1982 of some 19 acres at Lasham Airfield, with two hangars, plus various workshops, stores, and administrative offices. Dan-Air also had the use of the runway, suitable for jet aircraft. The Group owned a freehold house at Lowfield Heath, Sussex, and also occupied offices and workshops at Gatwick, Bristol, and Newcastle Airports, and offices at Cardiff, Liverpool, Manchester, Teesside, Luton, and Berlin Tegel Airports, and premises at Horsham, Sussex, used for training. All these premises, except for Lasham and the house at Lowfield Heath, were held on leases expiring by the end of 1975.

Haggarty, the New York Cloak and Suit House, the New York Store) was a department store chain founded in Los Angeles in 1906 and which closed in May 1970 due to not keeping up with fashion trends and a resulting $4.4 million in debts. It had more than a dozen branches at its peak. The chain was founded by J. J. Haggarty (1860‚Äì1935) who by 1905 had served for three and a half years and department manager and buyer for Jacoby Bros. department store, when he decided to open his own store, the New York Cloak and Suit House, occupying what had been the location of the City of London store at 337-339 S. Broadway. The store opened March 6, 1905, and was decidedly upscale, positioning itself as a large specialty store carrying ladies', misses' and children's ready-to-wear. It had four stories, each furnished in a different color scheme; first floor: fancy goods; second floor: evening gowns, opera wraps, cloaks, suits and skirts; third floor: millinery, dressmaking parlors and art; fourth floor: caf√© and restaurant.

The store had a 350-foot-long series of display windows under an arcade, the first such feature of a retail store in Los Angeles. store at 337-9 Broadway was occupied by the self-service New York Dresseteria, then later, Sweet Sixteen. After Mr. Haggarty's death the chain was bought by Clyde H. DeAcres, who had been president of Sherman, Clay and Co. in San Francisco, retailers of musical instruments. In 1938, DeAcres opened a four-story branch store in Beverly Hills on Wilshire Boulevard near Rodeo Drive. At the time of the chain's demise the principal owner was Mrs. Lila M. Ash, the wife of Roy Ash, the president of Litton Industries, a large defense contractor. She had invested about $9.5 million in Haggarty's. Branches Shortly before bankruptcy in 1970, the chain operated locations in Beverly Hills (the lease on which was acquired by Roos-Atkins), Palm Springs, Downey, Canoga Park, and four Hafter's-Haggarty's shops in the San Diego area. Previous branches in existence were Santa Ana and Bakersfield. The Downtown Seventh and Grand store had closed in 1963. Mansions Mr. Haggarty built a mansion in the West Adams district of Los Angeles at 3330 West Adams Blvd., and a 32-room Mediterranean-style, $750,000 summer home (1928) on the Palos Verdes Peninsula at 415 Paseo del Mar, near Malaga Cove, with lawns and gardens designed by the Olmsted Brothers and furnishings from Italy.

Glory Mountain is situated southeast of Trapper Lake on the shared border of North Cascades National Park and Glacier Peak Wilderness. The nearest higher peak is Trapper Mountain, to the west. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into Cottonwood Creek and Flat Creek, both tributaries of the Stehekin River. An unofficially named secondary peak called Halleluja Peak lies to the west of the summit. Climate Glory Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Glory Mountain seen from Sahale Peak Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite spires. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The U-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Since the congregation is paired with the Mariental Reformed Church, where the Rev. Johan Dunn is the current pastor since 2017, it also serves members from Mariental, Kalkrand, Maltah√∂he, Stampriet, and Gochas. The collective Keetmanshoop-Mariental area is enormous, almost the size of the United Kingdom. The distance between L√ºderitz and Stampriet is 500 km, and the even the distance between the two congregational seats, Keetmanshoop and Mariental, is 230 km.  Foundation  The Keetmanshoop Reformed Church was founded in 1936 as only the fifth GKSA church in South West Africa (SWA), after the first three (Gobabis, Outjo, Aranos) were founded to serve the mostly GKSA worshipers of the Dorsland Trek exodus who had returned to SWA from Angola between 1928 and 1930. The Bitterwater Reformed Church was founded in 1935 but dissolved in 1964, leaving Keetmanshoop the fourth oldest GKSA church in the territory. Keetmanshoop was the first of these churches not connected to the Angola-Afrikaner repatriation, since most of its members were immigrants from Cape and Transvaal provinces who had settled in Keetmanshoop, Mariental, and Karasburg.  First church building: Background  The first GKSA church building in Keetmanshoop, where the congregation worshiped from 1951 to 2001, was originally a Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NGK) building purchased in 1920 as the latter denomination's first church built in SWA. It was used as early as 1896 as the Krabbenhoft wagon factory. Later owned by Karel Johann Kakob Ehret and Franz August Steguweit, it became the headquarters of the painting and art dealing firm Ehret, Frey en Kie. In 1920, the Keetmanshoop church ward council bought the building for ¬£3,000. The Keetmanshoop Reformed Church (NGK) was founded in 1924 as a daughter church of the Mariental Reformed Church (NGK) (founded in 1898, then known as Gibeon). Before the building could be used for worship, it had to be renovated, for which Val Wurth and Metje & Ziegler won the contract. Whoever laid the keystone is forgotten. Pews were purchased from the Brothers Kappelhoff in L√ºderitz. After the founding of the NGK church, the Keetmanshoop church council decided on June 8, 1955, to expand the church hall by 30 feet. The collections flowed quickly, even in Natal, where the pastor, the Rev. H.J. Potgieter, was on sabbatical. Even the Vryheid Reformed Church (NGK), in northern Natal, contributed. The renovated church opened on February 20-21, 1926. Later, a gallery was added. After the construction of a new church for the NGK in 1945, the first Afrikaner tower church in SWA, the hall church doubled as a meeting hall, which the church council also allowed the GKSA to use for their services.  First church building purchased  On June 10, 1950, the NGK decided to sell the old building, preferably to the local GKSA church. On September 16, 1950, the GKSA church council, after a conference, agreed to buy the building for ¬£2,800, a bargain compared to the ¬£3,000 the NGK had paid for it in 1920 and the improvements made to it since then. The transfer was officially made on July 21, 1951. The Keetmanshoop GKSA church used this building until 2001. During the Rev. H.A. Louw's tenure in the 1950s, the church was renovated one more, and under the Rev. D.F. Coetzee in the 1980s, a nursery was added. In 2001, the church council sold it for N$330,000,returning it to commercial use once more.  Second church building  The current Keetmanshoop GKSA building, purchased by the church council in 2001, was also a former NGK church, in this case the Keetmanshoop-Noord Reformed Church, spun off from the Keetmanshoop NGK church in 1958 but reabsorbed in 2000 due to the decline in both congregations' membership. It was built in the 1970s in the \\"tent church\\" style pioneered by its architect J. Anthonie Smith. The construction was contracted to the firm, K.W. Wurth, and cost R98,890. The keystone was laid on August 18, 1972, and the solemn dedication was held February 22-23, 1975. The church's organ came from an old NGK church in Wolseley, Western Cape, also built by Smith, which had to be demolished due to damage from a September 29, 1969 earthquake. The congregation then bought the organ for R3,000 from the Keetmanshoop-Noord church, and their new church, designed by Smith, was built with its own new organ. The firm of Cooper, Gill & Tomkins, based out of Cape Town, rebuilt and modernized the older organ for R10,000. With the reincorporation of Keetmanshoop-Noord into the Keetmanshoop NGK church, as in 1950, there was once again only one church building for the GKSA, which acquired the building for the fair price of N$300,000, less than they had paid for the old church after adjusting for inflation. The dedication of the church into the GKSA was made on November 17-18, 2001. The Mariental Reformed Church and the Karasburg Reformed Church were both spun off from Keetmanshoop in 1966. Karasburg operated joint services with Keetmanshoop and Mariental from 1979 to 2006.

His later paintings are in the Troubadour style.  Life and work  He was a student of Jean-Baptiste Regnault. He exhibited at the Salon beginning in 1800 and won the Gold Medal in 1824 for \\"Derni√®re b√©n√©diction de l'√©v√™que Bourlier\\" (The last blessing of ). Under the July Monarchy, he was responsible for pictorial restorative work at the galleries in the Ch√¢teau de Versailles and the \\"Galerie de Diane\\" at the palais des Tuileries. He also did church decorations. In 1834, he was a major exhibitor at the \\"Exposition d'objets d'arts et d'industrie anciens et modernes\\" in Bordeaux, from which all profits were distributed to the poor. His works may be seen at museums throughout France as well as the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

On January 17, 2019, Governor Jim Justice chose Hardesty to fill the vacancy, and Hardesty assumed office the following day. The appointment caused some controversy, as Hardesty had been a registered coal lobbyist whose clients included several companies affiliated with Justice.

It is usually found in the mid to low tidal zone of exposed beaches living in tidal pools or between rocks where there is sand. Its body is usually encrusted in sand with only its tentacles exposed. It sometimes attaches pieces of shell and other debris to its stalk, a strategy that is thought to reduce erosion. The giant shore anemone has no known predators but is parasitised by the gastropod Epitonium (Hyaloscala) jukesianum, which uses its modified radula to pierce the anemone and suck out bodily fluids.  Description  This large anemone has a diameter of between 10 and 12 centimetres. It is best known for its vibrant colours and its central disc area can be green, pink, blue, or brown. Its tentacles are usually a different colour to the central disc and can be blue, mauve, orange or white. When underwater it extends up to 190 short blunt tentacles. These have perforated tips that resemble warts and eject fine streams of water when the animal is stimulated. Tentacles are arranged in four or more whorls which are all of the same length.  Diet  Giant shore anemones feed on shrimp, small fish and small crabs, which they capture using stinging cells on their tentacles to paralyse prey. Once caught, they will suck prey into their central cavity to be broken down by digestive enzymes. Shells and other items that are indigestible will be expelled back through the central opening.

As their way of seeking justice, domestic workers implemented the strategy of \\"pan-toting‚Äù by \\"re- appropriating the material assets of their employers for their use.\\"Hunter, p. 60.  Origins  Pan-toting originated in slavery in the United States, during the nineteenth century, among the African-American population. This practice evolved during the transition from slave to free labor, as an expression of a \\"moral economy\\". It is consistent with the \\"vales\\" and perquisites claimed by servants across cultures, dating back centuries. After the end of the Civil War and the abolition of slavery, African-American domestic workers, as free laborers, continued this practice, to express their opposition to work conditions that deprived them of a decent standard of living, drawing on decades of experiences with creative resistance. African- American domestic workers also claimed the right to this form of compensation due to their former status as slaves, for the unpaid work they had then performed for their masters and the white community.Hunter, p. 227. In addition to paying low wages, some employers were dishonest about wages owed, deprived workers of wages for a length of time, or outright refused to pay wages. These deprived and frustrated workers then used pan-toting as a counter-measure, both for making ends meet and asserting their new-found freedom. There were various forms of compensation that domestic workers could receive instead of actual wages. The most common item was food; and the cook, who had easy access to leftover food from their employer's kitchen, was the most likely to engage in pan-toting. Clothing was also taken as partial compensation. Household laborers expected employers to acknowledge their duty to ensure basic needs by supplementing wages with leftover food, or they would reclaim the fruits of their labor without the employers' consent.Hunter, pp. 60-61. Some employers knowingly allowed the practice, openly admitting that they paid low wages with the workers' getting the table scraps in mind. Other employers interpreted \\"free\\" labor to mean their expropriating labor without compensation. If the employer did not recognize this obligation, some workers would leave without consent.Hunter, p. 61.  Dependence  Many African- American workers and their families depended on this form of payment. This leftover food was important to their survival. For example, the \\"service pan\\" augmented wages in almost two-thirds of the employers' households in Athens, Georgia, in 1913.Sharpless, p. 74. A \\"Negro Nurse\\", writing in 1912, describes this dependence: > Well, I‚Äôll be frank with you, if it were not for the service pan, I don‚Äôt > know what the majority of our Southern colored families would do. The > service pan is the mainstay in many a home...others may denounce the service > pan, and say that it is used to support idle Negroes but many a time, when I > was a cook and had the responsibility of rearing my three children upon my > lone shoulders, many a time I have had the occasion to bless the Lord for > the service pan!Sharpless, pp. 74-75. Consequently, because African-American domestic workers and their families relied on \\"pan-toting\\", their diets were decided by, and depended on, the white employer. Most poignantly, Richard Wright remembered waiting for his mothers' employers to finish their meals so that he could learn what his own dinner would be: > If the white people left anything, my brother and I would eat well; but if > they did not, we would have our usual bread and tea.

I could not understand why some people had food and > others did not.Sharpless, pp. 102-103. \\"Toting\\" was a custom important to African-American families, but it could not always ensure a steady supply of food. Some employers recognized this. One employer stated: > ...there are hungry children in the cabin awaiting their mothers return, > when I give out my meals I bear these little blackberry pickaninnies in > mind, and I never wound the feelings of any cook by asking her 'what that is > she has under her apron'...I know what it is ‚Äì every biscuit, scrap of meat, > or bit of cake she can save during the day, and if possible, a little sugar > filched from the pantry.Hunter, p. 132.  Advantages  = Advantages for the worker = Domestic workers, who had no legal remedies to redress grievances, could use pan-toting to alleviate the effects of being poorly paid and to counter employers' dishonesty involving wages. For many domestic workers, pan-toting meant the difference between starvation and survival. It allowed them to stretch their resources and put food on the dinner table for their family. For some, pan-toting was seen as adding to the status of being a domestic worker, as it gave them greater control over their employer and their employment. = Advantages for the employer = The system of pan-toting had advantages for employers, too. Most notably, it meant that they could \\"pay less in cash wages, and they might hope, that because her family would have some at the end of the day, the cook would take extra care with the food, producing a finer result\\".Sharpless, p. 154. In addition to the cash savings, some employers who allowed toting could have the psychological benefit of seeing \\"reinforced the stereotype of African Americans as morally bankrupt and shifty characters and reinforced the notions of black inferiority and dependency and white paternalism\\".  Disadvantages for workers  Due to its origins in slavery, pan-toting is usually associated with keeping black domestics as inferior and reliant on their white employer, while allowing the employer to feel superior. Many white employers saw the practice as charity that allowed them to escape accountability for \\"paying substandard wages that engendered the need for the 'gift. Many argued pan- toting was a form of payment and used it to justify the low wages. \\"We know that most of this so-called 'food' is left-overs, cold scraps and the like which we would not use on our tables again,\\" a city-dwelling, self-proclaimed \\"Old Time Southerner\\" admitted. \\"We know that our servants are paid a small wage.\\" Another employer similarly conceded: \\"Totin' was a well-established custom, and should be remembered if the wages paid to seem horrifyingly small\\". The quality of the food from pan-toting was not always good or plentiful. African-American families received leftover food on the employers' terms, and the quality was often poor. \\"Washingtonian Nellie Willoughby recalled receiving leftover roast beef ‚Äì the tough, hard ends of the cut\\".Sharpless, p. 75. The family often had to wait long hours for the worker to return home with the food. \\"Educator William Henry Holtzclaw, born about 1875, remembered genuine hunger waiting for his mother to return from her cooking job\\". Furthermore, white families ate foods strange to some African- American palates, and families who relied on the service pan sometimes had to accept uncommon food not of their choosing. Audrey Smith recalled having to learn to eat the pheasant, lamb, and veal that her mother, Georgia Anderson, brought home from Maymont. Throughout the South, cooks for Jewish families brought home chopped liver, kugel, and other Eastern European delicacies as part of their \\"hookarm\\". If the food was good, plentiful, and regular, the cook might gratefully accept the service pan; but if the supply were inconsistent, the cook's family suffered.Sharpless, p. 76.  Rejection by workers  Some domestic workers took the opposite approach and rejected pan- toting. \\"To preserve this valued independence, three black domestics explained, they avoided borrowing from whites, even if this meant going without much-needed money.\\"Tucker (1987), p. 10. Some black domestics rejected such borrowing because it meant they were \\"still linked to white families in ways that were but one step away from the plantation system\\". From 1900, domestic workers felt \\"an uneasiness about such 'gifts. \\"I told them I didn't tote\\", said one, discussing the \\"old days\\" about slavery, when whites did not pay, except by giving food in the \\"service pan\\". Black women correctly associated these gifts with a system designed to keep them in the service of whites, and leaving them without the monetary means to achieve a higher standard of living. Several African-American domestic workers began to refuse food and claimed they would not tote, especially in the 1920s. Many white women remembered black domestic workers refusing to tote and \\"making it a condition of their acceptance of a job that they not be asked to do so\\".Tucker (1988), p. 146. These workers expressed a sense of disapproval and did not want to be compensated with leftover food in lieu of higher wages.  Regarded by employers as theft  A number of white employers and authorities began to denounce pan-toting as theft and a crime. Katharine Du Pre Lumpkin recalled her upbringing in an upper-class white home: \\"We verily believed that a Negro could not help but steal. So we acted accordingly. We must lock up our valuables. We children should never leave the key in the food pantry door, but turn it and put it back in its hiding place\\". Another employer celebrated the departure of a cook as they believed her to be a thief: \\"This is our Emancipation day! We are free from Susan Bell...She has been robbing our table for months to support her mother\\". A number of African-American domestic workers denied such accusations. In 1912, The Independent‚Äîa progressive New York City journal edited at the time by a prominent abolitionist, Henry Ward Beecher‚Äîprinted a quasi-autobiographical account of servant life by an African-American who was born and raised in the South and was a domestic worker for more than 30 years. In this journal she mentions the practice of pan-toting. She states: > I do not deny that the cooks find opportunity to hide away at times, along > with the cold 'grub' a little sugar, a little flour, a little meal, or a > little piece of soap; but I indignantly deny that we are thieves. We don't > steal; we just 'take' things‚Äîthey are a part of the oral contract, expressed > or implied. We understand it, and most of the white folks understand it. As domestic workers became more resistant, employers became more repressive and began attacking pan-toting in an attempt to control them. They believed it resulted in the spouses of domestic workers becoming lazy and that it would poorly affect the economy if healthy men were not working. They therefore wanted pan-toting banned. This song about black men portrays the attitude employers resented: > I doan has to work so ha'd I's got a gal in a white man's ya'd Ebery night > 'bout half pas' eight I goes 'round to the white man's gate She brings me > butter and she brings me la'd I doan has to work so ha'd!Hunter, p. 226. Some whites disagreed with such attempts to ban the practice. \\"Some feared that ending the tradition would alienate black women and encourage them to quit\\". Domestic workers in Thomasville, Georgia, threatened to quit if regulations monitoring pan-toting were passed. This resulted in the town's newspaper warning officials to exercise caution. Other employers recognized that criminalizing customary rights would be perceived as insulting to domestic workers. \\"The cook's dignity is a factor in all domestic service contracts. That dignity is immediately offended if the housewife questions her about the rations she totes off after supper\\", a Montgomery newspaper editorialized. The \\"Old Time Southerner\\" stated her objections to regulating pan-toting: \\"If I consent to my servant taking a little food home that is my business\\".

B. C. Drew, was an American lawyer and politician who served as the 10th Florida Attorney General.  Early life and military service  Drew was born in Newmarket, New Hampshire in 1843. At some point before the American Civil War, Drew moved to Madison, Wisconsin. On January 24, 1864, Drew was commissioned as a second lieutenant for Company F of the newly created 35th Wisconsin, fighting with them at the Battle of Spanish Fort and the Battle of Fort Blakeley during the Mobile Campaign. On January 14, 1865, Drew was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant. He was mustered out of service on May 17, 1865. After the war, Drew moved to Oshkosh, Wisconsin and became a local lawyer.  Political career  In 1871, Drew, via the favor of powerful friends, was appointed by Harrison Reed, the Governor of Florida, as the Florida Attorney General, succeeding Sherman Conant, who had been appointed a United States Marshal. Drew, a Republican, abandoned his first wife, Winifred, in Oshkosh and moved to Jacksonville, Florida in order to take office. By February 1872, Reed was proving to be an unpopular governor among both Democrats and Republicans, and he refused to extend Drew's tenure as Florida Attorney General. During Reed's second impeachment trial in the Florida Senate, Samuel T. Day, the Lieutenant Governor of Florida, attempted to oust Reed from power by declaring himself acting governor. Day's conspiracy was joined by Drew and two state senators. In May 1872, Drew joined the newly- founded Liberal Republican Party in defiance of Reed, and was one of Florida's delegates to the 1872 Liberal Republican convention, serving on the Committee on Credentials and the Committee on Platform. However, on May 4, 1872, while Drew was preoccupied at the convention, the Florida Senate ruled that Day's coup was unconstitutional and reappointed Reed as governor. Drew was removed from office that day, and was replaced by Horatio Bisbee, Jr., who was the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Florida. Drew, knowing his political reputation in Florida was tarnished, left the state altogether and became a lawyer in Washington, D.C. After the 1872 election and the collapse of the Liberal Republican Party, he rejoined the Republican Party. Despite his opposition to President Ulysses S. Grant during the 1872 election, Grant, likely with the urging of Drew's congressional allies, nominated him as the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Florida in 1873 following Bisbee's resignation. Though voting on his appointment was delayed in Congress by the Radical Republicans due to his former membership of the Liberal Republican Party and his betrayal of Reed, Drew was eventually confirmed by the United States Senate in 1874.  Later career and retirement  After leaving his position as United States Attorney around 1880, Drew permanently settled in Washington, D.C. and opened a private law firm in the city. Drew worked as a broker for several railroads in West Virginia. In December 1894, Drew helped the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad purchase 54,000 acres (84.375 square miles) of land near Horse Creek, West Virginia, which allowed for the connection of the railroad to the Kanawha River. Drew retired by 1900 and moved to Europe, though he fled back to America following the outbreak of World War I. Drew first lived in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, before moving to the Ravenswood Mansion in St. Albans, West Virginia. Drew also owned the Cummer House in Jacksonville, Florida, and often spent winters there.  Personal life and death  Drew fell ill two weeks after arriving in Jacksonville, Florida, and died at his vacation home on November 4, 1924. He is buried in Jacksonville's Evergreen Cemetery and is interred with his third wife. Drew was married three times. His first marriage was to Winifred Ellis (1848-1901) from Wisconsin in the 1860s, until he abandoned her in 1871 in order to move to Florida. After moving to Washington, D.C., Drew married Sarah Jane Salter (1843-1886), until her death in 1886. He was married a final time to Ella A. (1857‚Äì?), until his death.

Katarapko Game Reserve was a protected area in the Australian state of South Australia located about north-east of the state capital of Adelaide and on the opposite side of the Murray River to the town of Loxton. The game reserve consisted of the following land both on Katarapko Island within the floodplain of the Murray River and to the island‚Äôs immediate west and north both on the floodplain and adjacent high ground - sections 73 to 79, 89 and 91 to 94 in the Cobdogla Irrigation Area in the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Katarapko, and section 1958 in the Berri Irrigation Area, ‚ÄúOut of Hundreds.‚Äù As of 1980, the game reserve covered an area of . The land first received protected area status in 1970 when the full extent of Katarapko Island received protection under two separate state statutes: one part of the island (i.e. section 73) was declared simultaneously as a fauna conservation reserve and as a game reserve under the Fauna Conservation Act 1964 while the remainder (i.e. section 74) was declared as the Katarapko National Park under the National Park Act 1966. In 1972, the entire island was declared as a game reserve under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 with the name, the Katarapko Game Reserve. The boundaries of the game reserve were varied in the years 1973, 1979, 1983 and 1985 by the addition of land from the floodplain to the west and to the north of Katarapko Island, and from the high ground to the west of the island. In 1984, a draft management plan was offered for public comment. However, this document did not proceed because of ‚Äúsignificant public opposition‚Äù to proposals for ‚Äúroads, a visitor centre and a staff residence‚Äù located within the game reserve. The proposed works were not included in the management plan for the game reserve‚Äôs successor, the Murray River National Park, which published in 1994 for the additional reason of cost due to the ‚Äúpresent stringent economic climate.‚Äù On 20 June 1991, the game reserve was abolished, and all of its land holding was constituted under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 as the Murray River National Park.

They were led by HabibullƒÅh KalakƒÅni, and in January 1929 they managed to take control of the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul, establishing the Emirate of Afghanistan. Following military reversals in the Afghan Civil War (1928‚Äì1929), they were forced out of the capital in October 1929. Saqqawist activity ended in 1931.  Name  The name derives from Kalakani's nickname, Bacha-e Saqaw (literally son of the water carrier). The period in which Kalakani ruled Kabul, 17 January to 13 October 1929, is known as the \\"Saqqawist period\\".  History  An animated map of the Afghan Civil War of 1928-1929. Red = Saqqawists, Blue = Anti-Saqqawists. This map does not show the concurrent Soviet intervention against the Basmachi in northern Afghanistan. HabibullƒÅh KalakƒÅni began resistance against the government in 1924, after he deserted from the Afghan Royal army, which at the time was fighting against the Khost rebellion. Kalakani began a life of Banditry, since he considered the occupations common among the Kuhdamanis, like viticulture and selling firewood, to be beneath him, reasoning that these could hardly ever provide wheat bread for his table. Instead, he began to rob caravans and nearby villages. He was joined by Sayyid Husayn and Malik Muhsin, as well as others, totaling 24 in all. For three years, they lived in mountain caves, venturing out during the day to rob and hiding out at night, all the time fearful of government retaliation. Sometime later, Kalakani fled to Peshawar where he was a tea seller and a petty thief. In November 1928, while a Shinwari revolt was occurring in Jalalabad, the Saqqawists besieged Jabal al-Siraj, beginning the Afghan Civil War. On 17 January, they took Kabul, beginning what is known as the \\"Saqqawist period\\". In October 1929, a series of intense battles succeeded at forcing Kalakani to retreat into Kabul, and subsequently into the Arg. On 13 October 1929, the Arg was captured by forces loyal to Muhammad Nadir Khan, ending the Saqqawist period. During the reign of Nadir, the Saqqawists attempted another uprising, the Kuhistan rebellion, which was crushed within a week. The last Saqqawist holdout, Herat, fell to the Afghan government in 1931.  Membership and support  The Saqqawists saw widespread support among Afghanistan's Tajik population. The Saqqawist attack on Kabul in January 1929 was supported by the religious establishment as a way to reverse Amanullah's reforms. However, HabibullƒÅh KalakƒÅni \\"did not have the caliber to serve as the head of the state\\" and lost conservative support once in power. On 14 April 1929, Fayz Muhammad estimated the Saqqawists to number 20,000.  Ideology  Kalakani declared himself to be a \\"defender of Islam\\".  International relations  Despite taking control of Kabul, The Saqqawist government of Afghanistan was unable to obtain any diplomatic recognition. Nonetheless, the Saqqawists allied themselves with the Basmachi movement, allowing them to operate in Northern Afghanistan, and revoking the \\"Pact of Neutrality and Non-Aggression\\" that Afghanistan had signed with the Soviet Union following the end of the Urtatagai conflict, which obligated Afghanistan to restrain Basmachi border raids.  Human rights abuse  During the Afghan Civil War, there were incidents of rape and looting among Saqqawist troops. One such incident took place on 28 June 1929, when Saqqawists attacked the Hazara settlement of Qalah-i Karim, looting anything movable and driving off livestock. Another incident, which took place on 23 July 1929, was described by contemporary Afghan historian Fayz Muhammad as follows:  References  1924 establishments in Afghanistan 1931 disestablishments in Afghanistan Rebel groups in Afghanistan Conservatism in Afghanistan ","title":"Saqqawists"},{"id":"60557654","text":"Haoranjiania is a Gram-negative and non-spore-forming genus of bacteria from the family of Chitinophagaceae with one known species (Haoranjiania flava).

Ruth A. M. Schmidt is in the center. Military geology is the application of geological theory to warfare and the peacetime practices of the military. The formal practice of military geology began during the Napoleonic Wars; however, geotechnical knowledge has been applied since the earliest days of siege warfare. In modern warfare military geologists are used for terrain analysis, engineering, and the identification of resources. Military geologists have included both specially trained military personnel and civilians incorporated into the military. The peacetime application of military geology includes the building of infrastructure, typically during local emergencies or foreign peacekeeping deployments. Warfare can change the physical geology. Examples of this include artillery shattering the bedrock on the Western Front during World War I and the detonation of nuclear weapons creating new rock types. Military research has also led to many important geological discoveries.  Terrain analysis  Brancaster beach in England was used for amphibious tank practice as its sand was similar to that of Normandy. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers drilling a well in Cameroon as part of the \\"Civic Action\\" project Trinitite (in green) produced by the Trinity Nuclear Test Geologists have been employed since the Napoleonic Wars to provide an analysis of terrain which was expected to become a war theater, both in case of an upcoming battle and to assess the difficulty of logistical supply. Academically, it has been found that battles are likely to occur on rocks of Permian, Triassic, or Upper Carboniferous age, possibly due to their typical relief and drainage. More practically, geology has been used in identifying the best Allied invasion sites during World War II, including those in North Africa, Italy, and France. This included studying the properties of the sand of Normandy beaches, the tolerance of the soil in the hinterland to bombardment, the sediment of the English Channel sea floor, and the occurrence of landslides in Sicily. Likewise, German geologists created maps of southern England for Operation Sea Lion, identifying quarry locations and the suitability of rock types to excavate trenchers, etc. In the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea, very rugged terrain is due to the structure of metamorphic rocks, while the best flat land is underlain by granite. During the Korean War, these flat areas were used as military staging grounds by the North Koreans. It has been suggested that an understanding of the fracture and foliation patterns of the metamorphic rocks could help a field commander. This field partially overlaps with military geography. For this reason the British Army employed geographers in this role until the end of 1941, when it joined international common practice and started using geologists.  Geotechnical engineering  Geologists have been involved in the construction of forts, tunnels, and bunkers both during military conflicts and in peacetime. This included digging tunnels in northeastern Italy and Austria during the so-called mine war in World War I. The rocks of the Dolomites are different from those in other theaters and specialists were required in order to design the tunnels. Explosives were then put in the tunnels and detonated, to cause rock falls and undercut enemy troops. Geology is also used in determining the likely resistance of enemy defenses to shelling and bombing. In World War II, this task was performed by the Allies as they advanced across German-occupied Europe, assessing the likely effect of bombing bridges and shelling defenses in light of the local geology. During peacetime, similar methods have been used, such as the decision to locate the American Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the salt domes of the Gulf Coast.  Resource acquisition  Geologists are used to determine both the location and accessibility of strategic and tactical resources during war. In the case of the D Day landings and the 2003 invasion of Iraq, ground water and aggregate were the two most important geological resources to identify for the campaign. The aggregate was required both for roading metal and for the construction of airfields. Since 1966, the German Army has also been using geologists to mitigate and predict the environmental effects of civilian resource extraction.  Forensics  Geology has been used in many military intelligence investigations. During World War II, the American Military Geology Unit discovered the origin of balloon bombs which had been dispatched towards North America from Japan. They accomplished this by determining from which beach the sand in the balloon's ballast originated. Knowledge of rock types and seismic propagation also allows geologists to distinguish between natural and nuclear test initiated earthquakes.  Effect of warfare on rocks Military activity affects the physical geology. This was first noted through the intensive shelling on the Western Front during World War I, which caused the shattering of the bedrock and changed the rocks' permeability. New minerals, rocks, and land-forms are also a byproduct of nuclear testing.  Discoveries by military  Military research has led to many geological discoveries; however, secrecy has often delayed some of the possible progress. The Austrian Army of World War I included geologists called Kriegsgeologen who were allowed to carry out non- military scientific investigation during the war. Discoveries have included new natural resource deposits and the mapping of magnetic stripes on the ocean floor, leading to the idea of plate tectonics.

They typically replace standard economy class fares as the cheapest option for passengers and generally come with more restrictions compared to standard economy fares. Restrictions vary between different airlines, but they generally include not allowing passengers to change or cancel tickets or select seats for free. They are seen as a strategy for market segmentation. In the United States, Delta Air Lines was the first airline to introduce basic economy fares in 2012. Following Delta's launch of such fares, United Airlines, American Airlines, Alaska Airlines, JetBlue, and Hawaiian Airlines have all introduced some version of basic economy, though the restrictions of each airline vary. Outside the United States, several airlines have introduced fares with similar restrictions under different names, such as hand baggage only or hand luggage only fares. The introduction of basic economy airfares has been generally negatively received. Although many airlines initially claimed that these fares were introduced as a way for them to compete more effectively with low-cost carriers (LCCs), basic economy fares were gradually expanded to routes without LCC competition. Many publications instead saw them as a market segmentation strategy to encourage passengers to pay extra for standard economy to avoid the restrictions associated with basic economy, thus providing airlines extra revenue. Purpose Basic economy fares have been widely described as a market segmentation strategy for airlines to upsell customers to more expensive fares, instead of a product that airlines want customers to purchase. Former British Airways pricing executive Jeremy Quek described basic economy as \\"just another product that airlines are using to further segment the marketplace\\". Writing for Bloomberg News, Justin Bachman argued that basic economy fares cause passengers to pay more to fly, and that airlines increase revenue by increasing standard economy fares while introducing basic economy, causing customers to trade up to standard economy. Bachman described this phenomenon as \\"sleight-of-hand marketing\\". In Runway Girl Network, aviation writer Seth Miller argued that basic economy is not about helping airlines compete with LCCs, but instead is a way for airlines to increase incremental revenue. As evidence of the trend, Miller pointed out that while basic economy fares were initially confined to markets where full-service carriers compete with LCCs, they were subsequently expanded to domestic flights without LCC competition. He noted that basic economy works well at pressuring passengers to spend more money for the same product. By market =United States= In September 2018, the CAPA Centre for Aviation described basic economy fares as a \\"permanent fixture\\" in the United States market. The publication pointed out that segmented fares have been effective at increasing revenue for Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and United Airlines‚Äîthree of the largest international airlines in the United States. CAPA further noted that the resulting larger pool of lower fares has placed pressure on the revenue growth of Spirit Airlines and Frontier Airlines, two ultra-low-cost carriers. Delta Air Lines Delta Air Lines Airbus A220 economy class cabin In 2012, Delta Air Lines became the first U.S. airline to introduce basic economy. Delta initially limited the availability of these fares to routes where it competed against LCC Spirit Airlines, calling basic economy its \\"Spirit-match fare\\" in its 2015 earnings call. The fares were available in 75 markets in early 2015 and 500 in early 2016. Delta subsequently expanded the fares to all 20,000 domestic markets, including routes where it faces no competition from LCCs. Delta president Glen Hauenstein noted that Delta received $20 million in extra revenue from basic economy fares from January to March 2016. Hauenstein also said that more than 50% of passengers bought up from basic economy to more expensive fares when they were presented with warnings about restrictions associated with basic economy during the sales process. In October 2017, Delta executives said that they did not want customers to purchase basic economy fares, seeing the fares both as a defensive measure against low-cost airlines offering low fares, and as a way to lure prospective customers into buying more expensive options. In April 2018, Delta introduced basic economy on transatlantic flights. , basic economy passengers on Delta receive a free carry-on allowance, but are not allowed to select seats or change, cancel, or upgrade their ticket after purchase, regardless of elite status. Seats are assigned at check-in. United Airlines United Airlines Boeing 787 economy class cabin United Airlines announced its basic economy fares in November 2016 and began selling basic economy tickets in early 2017. These fares do not include overhead baggage space or earn elite miles. Grant Martin of Skift described United's roll-out of basic economy fares as \\"the most widespread and aggressive\\" of the three major U.S. full-service carriers. In November 2017, United revealed plans to reduce its basic economy offerings due to revenue loss resulting from customers opting for other airlines that price-matched United without basic economy restrictions. Despite the initial setback, United announced an expansion of basic economy fares in January 2018. In June 2018, the airline introduced basic economy on transatlantic flights, together with its joint venture partners Air Canada, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Lufthansa and Swiss International Air Lines. United aimed to generate $1 billion in additional revenue by 2020 via cabin segmentation, including its basic economy fares and premium economy. Dave Bartels, vice president for pricing and revenue management at United, said that the airline never saw basic economy as a tool to compete against discount airlines, but instead is a \\"segmentation tool\\" to split more price-sensitive customers from those who are willing to pay extra for fewer restrictions. , basic economy passengers on United do not receive overhead space for carry-on baggage and may only bring a personal item that fits under the seat in front, except for transatlantic flights where basic economy passengers continue to receive a carry-on baggage allowance. Changes and cancellations are not allowed, and basic economy fares earn half the elite qualifying miles compared to standard economy fares. Seat assignment up to 48 hours in advance is available for a fee. In October 2018, United CCO Andrew Nocella announced that the airline had no plans to change its carry-on baggage restriction, which is more restrictive compared to American and Delta. American Airlines American Airlines introduced basic economy fares for 10 markets in February 2017, following Delta and United. Initially, American did not provide basic economy passengers with free overhead space for carry-on baggage, except for its AAdvantage elite members, who still receive the standard free checked bag allowance. In April 2018, the airline introduced basic economy on transatlantic flights, including one free carry-on and the ability to select seats in advance for a fee, together with its joint venture partners British Airways, Iberia and Finnair. In September 2018, American re- introduced a free carry-on for basic economy passengers in addition to a personal item, a change the airline attributed to basic economy revenue not meeting expectations. , basic economy passengers on American are allowed one free carry-on and may select seats for a fee within 48 hours of departure, but are placed in the last boarding group. Basic economy fares earn half the elite qualifying miles compared to standard economy fares. Upgrades and changes are not allowed. On international flights, seat selection and changes are available for a fee at any time after booking. Alaska Airlines In April 2018, Alaska Airlines announced its version of basic economy called Saver Fares, with the fares rolling out from January 2019. , basic economy fares on Alaska include a free carry-on allowance and free seat selection, but only for seats at the back of the aircraft. Changes and cancellations are not allowed after 24 hours of booking. In addition, basic economy passengers are the last to board. JetBlue Airways In October 2018, JetBlue Airways president Joanna Geraghty announced plans to introduce basic economy fares starting in late 2019, in response to competitors introducing basic economy on routes flown by JetBlue. On November 12, 2019, JetBlue introduced \\"Blue basic\\", a basic economy option on JetBlue routes. Passengers are allowed to bring a carry-on bag. Blue basic flyers board last, select a seat at check-in, cannot cancel or change flights, and earn fewer frequent flyer miles. Hawaiian Airlines Hawaiian Airlines announced plans to introduce basic economy fares in December 2018. On September 23, 2019, the airline launched its basic economy product, Main Cabin Basic, which is available on limited flights for travel dates starting from October 21. Main Cabin Basic passengers receive complimentary meals and are allowed to bring a standard carry-on bag and a personal item. However, they do not get advance seat assignments, are not allowed to make changes to flights and are the last to board. =Europe= Hand-baggage only fares are common across most European airlines on flights within Europe. Hugh Morris of The Daily Telegraph described the introduction of such fares by European airlines as following in the footsteps of major U.S. airlines who have introduced basic economy fares. European full-service airlines that offer basic economy or hand-baggage only fares on transatlantic flights include: *International Airlines Group airlines British Airways, Finnair, Iberia and Aer Lingus; *Virgin Atlantic; *Air France‚ÄìKLM group airlines Air France and KLM; *Alitalia; and *Lufthansa Group airlines Lufthansa, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines and Swiss International Air Lines. These fares generally do not include a checked-baggage allowance and do not allow passengers to select seats in advance or make changes after booking. However, they do include a hand-baggage allowance and in-flight entertainment and meals. In addition to being a segmentation strategy, the introduction of such fares to transatlantic flights are also viewed as a way for full-service airlines to more effectively compete with long-haul LCCs such as Norwegian and WOW air. United Kingdom In 2016, British Airways introduced its basic economy fares, which do not include checked baggage, on European routes. These fares allow two pieces of hand baggage. In December 2017, the airline introduced a group-boarding policy, which placed basic economy passengers in the last boarding group. In April 2018, British Airways expanded its basic economy fares to long-haul flights, including transatlantic flights and flights to other destinations. These fares include in-flight meals, allow two pieces of hand baggage and offer advance seat selection for a fee. The airline introduced these fares together with its joint venture partners American, Iberia and Finnair. In March 2018, Virgin Atlantic introduced its hand-baggage only fares, as it changed its economy-class fare structure to provide three fare types. Its hand-baggage only offering, branded as Economy Light, does not include a checked-baggage allowance and free seat assignment. =Asia= In India, LCC SpiceJet introduced hand-baggage only fares in June 2015. These fares must be purchased at least 30 days in advance. They include a hand- baggage allowance in addition to a personal item, but do not include free checked baggage. The airline's regular economy-class fares, which are more expensive, include checked baggage within the fare. Abu Dhabi-based airline Etihad Airways introduced hand-baggage only fares on limited routes in September 2018, following a successful trial in late 2017. These fares include a hand-baggage allowance of , but not checked baggage. Shanghai-based airline China Eastern Airlines introduced basic economy fares in July 2019. These fares do not allow refunds, changes, upgrades, advance seat assignments, online check-in or checked baggage. Passengers on these fares board last. Reception Most corporations have prevented their employees from buying basic economy fares because of their limitations. For example, when cancellations occur, business travelers on basic economy cannot change to another flight and may have to purchase expensive last-minute tickets, eliminating any potential savings from the lower fares. Several airline pricing executives have noted that this corporate blockade is what airlines had hoped for, and that this strategy of product segmentation is effective at segregating business travelers from the most price-sensitive customers. Scott McCartney of The Wall Street Journal compared basic economy fares to other pricing strategies used by airlines to charge more from corporate travelers, such as Saturday-night stay requirements, advance-purchase requirements and frequent-flyer programs switching to giving miles based on airfare rather than distance traveled. William J. McGee of Consumer Reports stated that basic economy fares \\"come with significant trade-offs\\", and that being unaware of the restrictions may result in additional fees that negate savings from the fare difference with standard economy. However, McGee noted that basic economy fares may still be preferable to cheaper fares on ultra-low-cost carriers due to more flights, newer aircraft and higher reliability offered by major airlines. In response to a freedom of information request, the United States Department of Transportation released nearly 50 pages of customer complaints between May and September 2017, during which airlines widely rolled out basic economy fares. Barbara Peterson of Cond√© Nast Traveler observed that these complaints included passengers not knowing the airport check-in requirement, and online travel agencies not displaying limitations of basic economy fares to customers.

Originally developed as the 152 mm air defense gun KS-52 in 1949, the gun had a muzzle velocity of 1030 m/s, firing a 49 kg shell at 10 rounds per minute with a travel weight of 46 tons. After inspection by the Soviet Artillery Committee (the Artkom) and the Ministry of Armaments, work on the KS-52 was halted in 1949. Resolution No. 2966-1727 of November 26, 1951 from the Council of MInisters approved development of a \\"152 mm air defense gun on the basis of the KS-30\\", which was entrusted to OKB-8 and the Design Bureau of Plant No.172. Its head designer was Tsyrulnikov. The new gun, carrying the designation KM-52, was not fully developed until 1954. The Technical Council of the Ministry of Defense Industry inspected the gun on January 28-29, 1955. Production work of the KM-52 and its shells were distributed to different factories; the gun itself was mainly assigned to Plant No.172 (now Motovilikha Plants), who received different gun parts from other plants, including barrels from Plant No.232 (now Obukhov State Plant), which were in turn made from technical drawings by Plant No.8, GSP-152 traverse mechanisms from TsNII-173 (headed by Monastyrsky). Plant No.710 (now the defunct Podolsk Electro-Mechanical Plant). Shells were developed in NII-24, built by Plant No.73 with casings developed by NII-147. Firing mechanisms were developed from that of the SM-27 gun. Plant No.221 (now Titan- Barrikady) also prepared two barrels and sent them to Plant No.172 in 1955. The KM-52 underwent factory testing in December 1955, and was delivered on December 28. The KM-52's gun carriage did not differ greatly from that of the KS-30. It achieved a rate of fire of 16-17 rounds per minute and 16 units were accepted into service in 1957. Controlled experiments with the gun in 1957 produced some results, but a Resolution adopted by the Council of Ministers in June 1958 halted development of rocket assisted projectiles for the KM-52 alongside all work on the gun.

Rev Limit is a racing game similar to Ridge Racer and Gran Turismo, where the player must maneuver any of the cars to compete against either artificially intelligent opponents or another human opponent on various race tracks set across multiple locations. The game features various modes to choose from at the main menu, such as Arcade, Time Attack, Championship and Versus Battle. Players can also change weather conditions, automatic or manual transmission for the vehicle, number of laps and more. The Option screen allows the player to configure the control settings and other options. In Arcade mode, the courses are grouped into six different classes to choose before racing.

The airfield is located approximately north-northeast of Bath; about west of London Opened in 1941 it was used initially by the RAF and then later by the United States Army Air Forces. During the war it was used primarily as night fighter interceptor airfield. After the war it was closed in 1946. Today the remains of the airfield are located on private property and are used as agricultural fields. History Built on a kerbed Long barrow site, where a cremation urn was found, near a burial of a long necked beaker, and a bronze dagger, these are believed to be from the Beaker people. The kerbed Long Barrows were then flattened to make way for the airfield. It was originally planned as a satellite for the Maintenance Unit at nearby RAF Colerne but by the time construction work started in 1940 it had been selected as a sector station by No. 10 Group of RAF Fighter Command. RAF Charmy Down was opened late in 1940 and originally had a grass surface with landing strips of , both south east to north west and north east to south west. It was later upgraded to the Class A airfield standard set by the British Air Ministry in 1941, the main feature of which was a set of three converging runways each containing a concrete runway for takeoffs and landings, optimally placed at 60-degree angles to each other in a triangular pattern. In addition a wide tarmac perimeter track and 39 aircraft dispersal points was constructed. These were 12 double pens and 15 single standings. The technical site was connected to the ground station and airfield consisted of 12 Blister hangars and one Bellman hangar and various organisational, component and field maintenance shops along with the maintenance personnel necessary to keep the aircraft airworthy and to quickly repair light and moderate battle damage. Depot personnel performed depot-level maintenance on aircraft as well as performing major structural repair on severely damaged combat aircraft. The ammunition dump was located on the north side of the airfield, outside the perimeter track surrounded by large dirt mounds and concrete storage pens for storing the ammunition required by the aircraft. =Royal Air Force use= RAF Charmy Down in 1943 The first occupant of Charmy Down was No. 87 Squadron RAF, with night-fighting Hawker Hurricanes, In the summer of 1941 Boulton Paul Defiants appeared and Westland Whirlwinds and Turbinlite Havocs of 125 and 263 squadrons respectively were to be seen the following year. 137 Squadron replaced No 263 Squadron in September 1941. In November 1941 417 Squadron of the Royal Canadian Air Force was formed here. Hawker Hurricane Mark IIC night fighters on the airfield During 1942 various other squadrons were posted to Charmy Down including 533 Squadron which was formed on 8 September 1942, from No. 1454 (Turbinlite) Flight,Rawlings, John D.R. Fighter Squadrons of the RAF and their Aircraft. London: Macdonald & Jane's (Publishers) Ltd., 1969 (2nd edition 1976, reprinted 1978). . page 465 as part of No. 10 Group RAF in Fighter Command. Instead of operating only Turbinlite and Airborne Intercept (AI) radar equipped aircraft (Havocs and Bostons) and working together with a normal nightfighter unit, such as the Hawker Hurricanes of 87 Squadron, the unit also flew with their own Hurricanes. It was disbanded at Charmy Down on 25 January 1943, when Turbinlite squadrons were, due to lack of success on their part and the rapid development of AI radar, thought to be superfluous. A Supermarine Spitfire Operational Training Unit took over in 1943 and stayed until the airfield was turned over to the USAAF in November 1943. =United States Army Air Forces use= Remains of the aircraft Shooting-in Butt used to test the installed guns. Taken in 2010 Charmy Down was known as USAAF Station AAF 487 for security reasons by the USAAF during the war, and by which it was referred to instead of location. The airfield code/USAAF Station Code was \\"CH\\". 4th Tactical Air Depot Service groups were deployed there late in 1943 to operate the 4th Tactical Air Depot, which was intended to repair, modify and maintain Allison-engined fighter types, primarily Lockheed P-38 Lightnings and North American P-51 Mustangs. For unrecorded reasons, it was decided to transfer this operation to Kingston Bagpuize early in 1944, possibly for better local logistics and communications in the Oxford area. Nevertheless, IX Air Force Service Command activities continued at Charmy Down until the autumn of 1944. 422d, 423d and 425th Night Fighter Squadrons The Ninth Air Force was scheduled to receive three night fighter squadrons with a mission to effect night air defence of US airfields when these were established on the Continent. RAF Charmy Down was selected as an airfield for these squadrons which would arrive individually, not as part of a group, and were to be equipped with the new Northrop P-61 Black Widow. Personnel of the 422nd Night Fighter Squadron arrived first on 7 March 1944 and had their aircrews posted to various RAF night fighter and signal schools for theatre indoctrination. =Postwar use= After the end of hostilities in Europe, the airfield returned to the RAF. There was little flying from the station although it was not officially closed until October 1946. From the January 1946 to October 1946, No 92 Gliding School, Air Training Corps used the airfield and it was home to the Personnel Resettlement Centre for Australians. In the 1950s, Charmy Down was included as a low priority on the list of sites for the deployment of the ROTOR radar system. Construction started in May 1953 but was abandoned in April 1955, and only ground works now remain. Current use The old control tower in 2010 With the facility released from military control, the airfield stood intact yet disused for many years. Eventually the hangars were removed, but the outline of the runways can still be seen in aerial photography and test probing (2018) suggests the runways remain approximately 5 cm below the now grassed over tarmac. Most of the perimeter track still remains mostly in a half-width condition, as do several of the derelict buildings, including the control tower, a few of the Blister hangars still remain and are used for farm storage. Most of the pillboxes also remain but, being largely subterranean, are filled in. The ammunition dumps, also derelict, remain. Bath and North East Somerset Council has considered, but rejected, the option of building a Park and Ride for Bath on Charmy Down. Part of the 06/24 runway serves as a microlight airstrip (2018), and model aircraft are flown further along (NNE) the same runway. A large part of the old RAF Charmy Down airfield, and some adjacent land, is currently owned by Wessex Water who own Monkswood Reservoir, built in 1896, situated north of the airfield.

C. Ruyl) was a trader with the Dutch East Indies Company (VOC) who is best known for producing the first translation of portions of the Bible in the Malay language. Very little is known about Ruyl except for his work in translating the Bible and his mission to Morocco.  Background  Ruyl is known to have come from Enkhuizen and his first visit to the East Indies was probably in 1600 and by the time the VOC had established their permanent trading posts in Banten in 1603 and Batavia in 1611, was already established as a koopman or merchant in the region with a relatively good command of the Malay language, the regional lingua franca of trade. The VOC was not only chartered with a monopoly on trade in the East Indies by the Dutch Republic but also on all aspects of Dutch involvement in the East Indies. While the VOC did not encourage missionary work, it did sponsor chaplains, both clerical and lay (of which Ruyl may have been one), for the Dutch population as well as tolerated efforts to proselytise native Roman Catholics who had been converted by Portuguese missionaries earlier, particularly in Ambon. With the partially Protestant Reformation inspired Dutch Revolt still ongoing in the home provinces against the Roman Catholic Spanish Empire (of which Portugal was then a part of), the motivation to undermine Portuguese trade and religious influence in the East Indies may have motivated this tolerance of proselytisation.  Translation work  Front page of \\"Sovrat A. B. C.\\", translated into Malay from Philip van Marnix's \\"A. B. Boek\\" by Albert Ruyl in 1611 The VOC published a primer entitled (), a translation of Philip van Marnix's A. B. Boek, in 1611. While the translator is not mentioned, it is widely credited to Ruyl and was mentioned in the foreword of Ruyl's 1612 translation of van Marnix's small catechism, Spieghel, van de Maleysche Tale. In 1612, Ruyl had completed his translation of the Gospel of Matthew in the Malay language in the Jawi script, the common script that was used to then write Malay. This was however published in 1629 in the Latin script as a Dutch-Malay diglot. This was followed by a translation of the Gospel of Mark that was also published as a Dutch-Malay diglot in 1638 which also included translations of the Ten Commandments, the Benedictus, the Greater Doxology, the Magnificat, the Nunc dimittis, the Apostles Creed, the Lord's Prayer, and a few other liturgical prayers and canticles. This work was later published together with the translation of the Gospels of John and Luke that was done by a VOC clerk, Jan Van Hasel in 1646. Ruyl's translations were based on early Dutch translations of the Bible that were themselves based on translations of the Vulgate and Martin Luther's translation. It was only after the official Statenvertaling version of the Dutch Bible was published in 1637 was it used as the basis of later translations in the seventeenth century.  Commissioner to Morocco  In 1622, the States General of the Netherlands assigned Ruyl as a Commissioner to lead a mission to Morocco, a state that was allied with the Dutch Republic, to explore the building of a port in Ras Cantin. He was accompanied in the mission by Joseph Pallache and Jacob Gool. Ruyl's relationship with the Pallaches was extremely strained and he stayed in Morocco for seven months, mostly in Safi, without ever being granted permission to inspect the Ras Cantin area or an audience with the Sultan, Mulay Zidan. Upon the irrevocable failure of the Moroccan mission, he was granted permission to return to the Netherlands with the newly appointed Moroccan ambassador, Yussef Biscaino. Upon his return, Biscaino's first act was to lodge a formal complaint with the States-General on the alleged misconduct of Ruyl and the States-General was forced to place Ruyl under house arrest and forbade his entry into The Hague. While Ruyl's mission to Morocco was deemed a failure, his detailed journals provide a lot of information about the Pallaches and the socio-political situation of Morocco in that period. Not much is known about Ruyl's fate after his house arrest.

The species is named in honor of the Swedish naturalist Gustaf von Paykull (1757‚Äì1826).  Description  (It has no common name only a Scientific name)As is evident from the common name of its kind, S. paykulliana resembles black widow spiders in shape and color markings. The female S. paykulliana body length is from 8 mm, to 12 mm when pregnant. The abdomen is globular, colored a shiny black, with two non-overlapping stripes, one dorsal and one lateral. This differentiates it from true black widow spiders that have dorsal and ventral markings. The stripes are ivory-yellow on young females and orange-red on mature ones. The male is only about half the size of the female, with less prominent markings. S. paykulliana's venom is much less potent than the true black widows', and its effect on humans is minor, similar to a wasp sting.  Behavior  Female S. paykulliana taking care of its egg sac. S. paykulliana spins typical tangled three-dimensional webs, usually on sloping ground covered with vegetation. A cocoon is spun around the eggs. In Yugoslavia, the spiderlings hatch at the end of summer, hibernate in the winter, and reach adulthood at the beginning of the next summer.

She led the 2003 single-mothers struggle against austerity decrees limiting child allotments, a policy initiated by then-finance minister Binyamin Netanyahu as part of a program to cut government spending in the areas of welfare and aid, which was aimed primarily at income support and other programs aimed at marginalized sectors of the population, such as single mothers.  The protest  On July 2, 2003, Knafo set out on a march from her home in the southern town of Mitzpe Ramon to the Ministry of Finance in Jerusalem. She walked along main and side roads carrying an Israeli flag. The march, which was about , took her a week. Along the way, she was joined by other single mothers and families, and was followed closely by the media, becoming a national \\"cause c√©l√®bre\\". When she arrived in Jerusalem, she joined the single-mothers protest encampment which was set up in front of the government offices, bringing major media attention to the mothers and families there. Netanyahu's initial response to Knafo was: \\"Go to work! If you have the ability to march, you can go to work\\". Following Knafo's march, other groups joined the expanding protest, including representatives of disability rights groups and the elderly. The media interest in Knafo continues, and she was interviewed and quoted frequently. The struggle for which she became a symbol was sometimes called \\"The July Revolution\\" or \\"Revolt of the Poor\\". Along her way, Knafo garnered support from various social activism and interest groups, among them Ahoti, the Mizrahi feminist movement, New Israel Fund, and more. Several Mizrahi feminist from Ahoti joined specifically to protect Knafo from the police, who tried several times to curtail her march.Lavie, Smadar. The Knafo Chronicles : Marching on Jerusalem With Israel's Silent Majority, Affilia: Journal of Women and Social Work. Vol. 27 (3): 300-315. , 2012 Increasing public pressure was applied to Netanyahu to change his plan. He made some changes, which Knafo and other protesters called \\"cosmetic\\", and rejected. In August, Knafo and several other leaders of \\"the mothers' movement\\" went on a hunger strike. Knafo fasted for 18 days, before she agreed to break her strike in the President's residence, at his request, as he voiced support and appreciation for her struggle. However, as the protest continued, the residents in the protest encampment began experiencing divisiveness. The Jerusalem group of single mothers wanted to escalate the struggle, and create disruption by blocking roads and the like, while Knafo and Ilana Azoulay, another leader in the protest, preferred to continue protesting peacefully. On September 25, 2003, Knafo left the encampment and returned home, only to discover she had been fired from her job. She later called the protest \\"a carnival that accomplished nothing. People need to take to the streets.\\"  After the protest  Knafo continues to appear in the media and at public events. She was part of the Israeli delegation to the launching ceremony of the Geneva Initiative in 2003. When the single-mothers struggle faded from the public eye, 44 year old Knafo posed nude for a pornographic website. Later, she sued the site claiming she was never paid. In September 2005, her oldest son committed suicide while under arrest for theft and battery against his girlfriend. He was 25, and Knafo stated that he suffered from mental problems. In October 2006, Knafo joined Meretz, and indicated she might run in the party primaries. In 2011 Knafo became spokesperson for the supermarket chain Mega Bull. This turned out to be a controversial move, and she was seen by some as selling out to the \\"tycoons\\". In November 2016 Knafo set out on another march, this time to the residence of prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu, together with other social activists, under the slogan \\"two year budget with social corrections\\". In January 2019, Knafo joined the cast of the Israeli version of Celebrity Big Brother. Knafo who is divorced and has three children, is a vegan. She works at a hotel in Mitzpe Ramon. Before that, she worked in housekeeping at a residential school, generally working two part-time jobs at a time. She spoke out about being an \\"outsourced\\" worker when the government was considering raising the minimum wage: \\"I don't have a pension, or benefits, and I can't even think about my old age. But if the minimum wage is raised, it will harm us, because employers will turn elsewhere. Anyway, I listen to the news and laugh. The minimum wage will never go up, it's bullshit.\\"  Additional reading  * Lavie, Smadar. \\"The Knafo Chronicles : Marching on Jerusalem With Israel's Silent Majority\\", Affilia: Journal of Women and Social Work.

Basel won 4‚Äì3 and it was the club's first ever national title. Haftl scored two goals in the final and there were two other fellow Austrians in the team, Ferdinand Wesely and Josef Chloupek. Haftl ended his football career playing two seasons for Young Fellows Z√ºrich from 1935 to 1937. In the season 1938‚Äì39 he joined SC Wacker Wien as trainer and remained there until December 1941, International Haftl played three times for his country. His first international appearance for Austria came in May 1925 against Hungary. In this home fixture in Wien, he scored his two international goals, the first in the 38th minute and the second in the 88th. Austria won 3‚Äì1. His second international game was an away game against the same opponents. His last game for Austria was against Italy on 7 April 1929.

It won the 1981 Whitbread Book Award for novel of the year and in 2017, on its republication by Northern Ireland's Turnpike Books, was described by his publisher as the \\"begetter of Northern noir\\".James Doyle, \\"Silver's City, begetter of Northern noir\\", Irish Times, 2 August 2017 \\"Northern noir\\", also known as Ulster noir,\\"Ulster noir draws on Northern Ireland's dark history of conflict\\", The Observer, 11 May 2014. is the Northern Ireland equivalent of Scandinavian Nordic noir, a distinct genre of crime fiction. Publication After some 15 years of the Troubles, Northern Ireland's increasingly violent sectarian conflict, \\"Silver's City\\", publication in September 1981 by Secker & Warburg, introduced a new authenticity to the literature of Northern Ireland. Probing the open wound of divided Ulster loyalists, amid the killings and bombings, it is one of the seminal fictional portraits of the Troubles. Reassessing the book on its republication in 2017, Daniel Magennis wrote for the International Crime Fiction Research Group: 'Silver's City is a menacing and expertly written thriller which explores the disaffection of a people with their own home and lays bare the corrosive effects of casual and causeless violence. Silver's City is a place where violence seems woven into its fabric, a desolate stage for the self-defeating blood sport that was much ‚Äì if not all ‚Äì of the Troubles. ' Plot summary While Belfast is torn apart by a vicious, undeclared war, two men are engaged in a bitter and equally destructive private battle for vengeance. Ned Galloway, a streetwise hired gun, has abducted 'Silver' Steele a jailed Loyalist folk-hero who fired the first shot of the Troubles. Galloway's purpose ‚Äì to prove who wields the real power in the city's battle-torn streets. While Galloway believes his anarchic skills can buy him a kind of freedom, Steele, having swapped a cell for the illusion of freedom, discovers that he no longer understands the mechanism and principles of the city he once fought for. Together they plunge towards the final confrontation. A confrontation where all who believe they pull the strings are proved dangerously, murderously wrong. Reception Although \\"Poor Lazarus\\", Leitch's second novel, had won the Guardian Fiction Prize in 1969 and Leitch's reputation was growing, some in Northern Ireland's literary establishment ‚Äì notably the poet and defender of Protestant culture, John Hewitt ‚Äì had singled Leitch out for letting down the Protestant community. Hewitt was particularly critical of the 'extraordinary outburst' against Orangeism in Poor Lazarus.Sarah Ferris, Poet John Hewitt, 1907‚Äì1987 and Criticism of Northern Irish Protestant Writing, Mellen Press, p.114 Silver's City was Leitch's fourth novel, written when he had left Northern Ireland for London. As Leitch recalled it in an interview with David Roy for The Irish News in 2017: \\"I think it got one review in Belfast, in [literary magazine] The Honest Ulsterman ... My friends had been trying to keep it from me and when I saw it I just went ballistic ‚Äì because it was the most awful, scurrilous, personal attack on the book ... because it was 'dirty'. I was ready to kill this bastard ‚Äì and then about three days later it won the bloody Whitbread Prize!\\".Interview by James Roy in The Irish News, 25 May 2017. Apart from winning the Whitbread, it received highly respectful reviews from the English press. *William Boyd, whose novel A Good Man in Africa was to win the Whitbread Prize for first novel in the same year, wrote in The Sunday Telegraph: 'It's not the action of the novel which stays in the mind so much as the precise delineation of the two personalities, both alien and both finely and unsettlingly rendered. ' *The London Review of Books, in a review by the literary critic Graham Hough,Graham Hough review, London Review of Books, Volume 3, No. 18, 10 October 1981 said: 'Maurice Leitch is a writer of considerable and sombre power. This is an arresting, imaginative evocation of a world so gangrened by hate and cruelty as to be beyond redemption. Its status, intended or achieved, as a historical report is something that an outsider can hardly judge.' *When the first paperback edition of the book appeared in 1983, by Abacus, they quoted similar words from the Observer: 'Tight-lipped and tautly-bound venture into the destitutions of modern Belfast. The urban wilderness of Ulster... is well caught. But more, so is the spiritual desert of the embattled Ulster mind.' Radio adaptation In 1995, a new paperback edition of Silver's City was published by Minerva.Library of Congress Location, \\"Silver's City\\", Miranda, London, 1995 In the same year, Leitch dramatised the book for BBC Radio 4's Monday Play,Silver's City by Maurice Leitch, BBC Radio 4, 1995, BBC Genome a slot for the harder hitting dramas on the network.

Despite the fact that the epicenter was in Zambales, most of the damage to infrastructure occurred in the neighboring province of Pampanga, which suffered damage to 29 buildings and structures.  Earthquake  United States Geological Survey shake map for the 2019 Luzon earthquake; a maximum Mercalli intensity scale value of 6.6 was observed in Gutad, Floridablanca, Pampanga The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) initially reported an earthquake of magnitude 5.7 striking at 17:11 PST with an epicenter two kilometers N 28¬∞ E of Castillejos, Zambales. The report was later revised to an earthquake of magnitude 6.1 with epicenter 18 kilometers N 58¬∞ E of Castillejos. The fault from which the earthquake originated is yet to be determined, with geologists focusing on two nearby fault systems, the Iba Fault and the East Zambales Fault, trying to ascertain the source of the earthquake.  Casualties  As of April 29, 2019, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council confirmed 18 deaths, 3 people missing and 256 injuries. Of the 18 reported dead, 5 were reported in the collapsed Chuzon Supermarket in the municipality of Porac, 7 were reported elsewhere in the town, 2 in Lubao, 1 in Angeles, and 1 in San Marcelino, Zambales.  Damage and effects  State seismologists said that Zambales had been spared from the earthquake destruction, despite the location of the epicenter being there, although the reports of fatalities and the damage have yet to be received by the local authorities. The neighboring province of Pampanga suffered damage to 29 structures/buildings and was the area most affected by the earthquake, due to the province sitting on soft sediment and alluvial soil. According to governor Lilia Pineda, several structures in the province were damaged by the quake, including a 4-story supermarket in Porac, the Bataan-Pampanga boundary arch and the main terminal of Clark International Airport, as well as old churches in Lubao and Porac, where the stone bell tower of the 19th-century Santa Catalina de Alejandria Church collapsed. Due to the collapse of the 4-story Chuzon Supermarket, the Department of Interior and Local Government had to suspend all business permits of Chuzon Supermarket and its branches, as well as to conduct an investigation regarding the collapse of the 4-storey commercial establishment, which was built 4 years ago. (0:01- ) \\"Apat na taon pa lamang nakatayo ang gusali ng Chuzon Supermarket sa mismong bayan ng Porac, Pampanga.\\" / (1:54- ) \\"Pinasususpendi na ng DILG sa mga lokal na pamahalaan ang lahat ng business permits ng mga sangay ng Chuzon Supermarket.\\" There have been at least 421 aftershocks reported but only 8 were felt. in Central Luzon 5 dams were damaged and \\"needed immediate repairs\\", with an estimated cost of 20 million pesos, according to the National Irrigation Administration (NIA). PHIVOLCS stated that the volcano Mount Pinatubo, located near the earthquake's epicenter, has not shown any \\"anomalous activity\\". Pinatubo is known for its major eruption in 1991, which may have been related to a major 7.7 magnitude earthquake in 1990. PHIVOLCS added that the earthquake could not trigger an eruption of Pinatubo, explaining that the volcano's magma supply has not sufficiently replenished since 1991 to allow for an eruption. On April 25, the Philippine National Police (PNP) released the CCTV footage of the collapsed Chuzon Supermarket; the video shows the actual collapse of the second floor of the building in just 10 seconds after the earthquake.At 0:39 of video, the earthquake hits at CCTV timestamp 05:07:21 before losing the live transmission at 05:07:28. = Power = Power outages were reported in the provinces of Bataan, La Union, Pampanga and Pangasinan. They were also experienced in parts of Quezon, Batangas, Camarines Sur and Sorsogon, where power supply has since been restored. The National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) issued an alert level at yellow status on the Luzon grid after the initial earthquake. = Schools, colleges and universities = Following the earthquake, classes in all levels were suspended. Numerous schools, Universities and colleges that were affected by the earthquake announced class suspension for April 23 and 24. The Department of Education ordered the thorough inspection of school buildings and facilities in the affected areas. A 10-story building of Emilio Aguinaldo College along United Nations Avenue in Manila was reported to have tilted and leaned onto the adjacent building, causing its fiberglass terrace to hit the other building. Soil liquefaction underneath the building was seen as probable causes. One lane of United Nations Avenue was closed to vehicular traffic to ensure the safety of motorists. An assessment team composed of private and local government structural engineers stated that the building's structural integrity remains intact. = Transport = Train services in Metro Manila were halted followed by an extensive inspection. All lines were closed for the rest of the day. Train services were expected to resume when the inspection results came out with the findings that the railway system sustained no damage. A crack on the girder was reported at the Line 2 Recto Station, but it came from an existing damage and was not earthquake related according to the Department of Transportation (DOTr). It was also superficial in nature.  Rescue efforts  The authorities began the search and rescue operations for the survivors in the collapsed supermarket in Porac; however, the operation was suspended when a 4.5-magnitude aftershock hit the neighboring town in Castillejos, Zambales on April 24 at 2:02am (PST).

Emerson (born January 18, 1952) is an Emeritus Professor of Biological Sciences at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies who uncovered details about how cancer becomes drug resistant. She is currently at the Oregon Health & Science University‚Äôs Knight Cancer Institute. She is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.  Early life and education  Emerson was born in Eugene, Oregon. Her parents divorced when she was young and her mother became a traveller. Her father was an amateur boxer and he mother was a gambler. Emerson attended the La Ch√¢telainie School for Girls in Neuch√¢tel for a year. She studied biology at the University of California, San Diego. To support her studies, she worked as a carhop at Shoney's and a waitress at a steakhouse. During her undergraduate studies she spent a year at the University of St Andrews (1972), where she worked with Donald Helinski and Peter Geiduschek. She joined Washington University in St. Louis for her graduate studies, earning a PhD in molecular biology in 1981 under the supervision of Robert G. Roeder. She faced some challenges during her doctoral studies, but was helped by Shirley M. Tilghman who visited Seattle as a guest speaker. Emerson was a postdoctoral research associate at the National Institutes of Health, where she started to work on transcription. She has continued to investigate how transcription can malfunction and cause disease throughout her academic career.  Research and career  Emerson joined the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in 1986. She joined at the same time as Katherine Jones. She was awarded a Pew Scholars Award, and held an adjunct position at the University of California, San Diego. Emerson was promoted to professor in 1999. Emerson's lab considered how genes are turned on and off throughout the course of cancer. The study of how tumour suppressant genes are silenced during cancer has been the pursuit of many scientists. Emerson identified a novel regulator of gene expression in cancer. She identified the functions of the tumour suppressing protein p53, which is mutated in the majority of human cancers and impairs cell cycle arrest apoptosis. Emerson investigated p53 using biochemical and cell-based analyses. She also studied the protein TGF beta 1, a transforming growth factor, which was understood to suppress the development of cancer. Emerson found that once a cell drifts into a precancerous state TGF beta 1 can in fact act to promote cancer. She went on to study how stress response in breast tissue can promote early cancer formation. She has studied the Beta globin gene family, and found it is activated by EKLF, a zinc finger containing transcription factor. She has worked with the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine. In 2017 Emerson filed a gender discrimination lawsuit against the Salk Institute. She led a report that assessed the culture of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, finding that women were less likely to be hired and received the smallest labs, despite raising more National Institutes of Health funding. In April 2018 the story broke that Inder Verma had been serially harassing women at the Salk Institute, and Emerson had been one of his victims in September 2001. He was put on administrative leave and subsequently resigned before the board of trustees took action in June 2018. Emerson's case went to trial and was settled in November 2018. Emerson spent over thirty years at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. She left in 2017, when her contract was not renewed as she did not secure grant funding to pay for half of her salary. She joined the Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU), where she is a Distinguished Scientists who directs research initiatives. She was named a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2015.

The time line may have a name that reflects the amount of time, such as \\"10-second line\\" or \\"8-second line\\". Correspondingly, a violation of the rule may be called a 10-second violation or an 8-second violation. History The rule was introduced in 1933. It was basketball's first time restriction on possession of the ball, predating the shot clock by over two decades. FIBA and the NBA specified 10 seconds, but adopted an 8-second limit in 2000 and 2001, respectively. In college basketball, the interval remains 10 seconds. Procedure The time limit is marked off by an official waving his arm to visibly count, if there is no shot clock available or the shot clock is turned off. However, women's college basketball introduced the 10-second limit in 2013‚Äì14, and provided that officials will not count the ten seconds but \\"will use the shot clock to determine if a 10-second violation has occurred.\\" The referee calls a violation if the offense still has the ball in the backcourt when the shot clock has counted down from 30 to 20 and now shows 19 (which first occurs at 19.9 seconds left). Men's college basketball has had the same rule since 2015-16, when the shot clock changed from 35 seconds to 30 seconds. In the NBA and FIBA, the shot clock marks off the 8-second count. Analogs in other sports In field lacrosse, a team has 20 seconds to get the ball across the midfield line any way it can, and then 10 seconds to get the ball into its opponents' goal box. To satisfy the latter limit it is not necessary that a player in possession of the ball enter the box; although that is the most common way of doing so, that count is ended if the ball simply touches the ground inside the box. Officials typically use a timer for the 20-second count, as they may also at the same time be counting the four seconds a defensive player is allowed to stay in the goal crease with the ball, and count off the ten seconds manually.

Life and military career The son of Ralph Frankland-Payne- Gallwey and his wife, Edith Alice Usborne, he was born at Blackrock in Ireland. He was educated at Eton College, before enlisting in the 4th Battalion, York and Lancaster Regiment as a second lieutenant in February 1900. He was transferred to the Grenadier Guards in August 1900, with whom he served in South Africa during the Second Boer War. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in April 1904, while in June 1908 he was made a member of the Royal Victorian Order (fifth class). He was promoted to the rank of captain in July 1908 and was seconded to the Macedonian Gendarmerie. He made his debut in first-class cricket for the Marylebone Cricket Club against Yorkshire in May 1912 at Lord's. Later in the same month he played a first-class match for the British Army cricket team against the Royal Navy at Lord's. He scored 37 runs across his two matches and took 2 wickets with his right-arm fast bowling. He served during the opening stages of the First World War, travelling to France with the 2nd Grenadier Guards in August 1914. He was reported missing in action in September 1914, and despite rumours that he had been taken prisoner by the Germans, these proved to be unfounded and he is believed to have been killed in action on 14 September at Vendresse-Beaulne.

Her first two books Calme et Tranquille (2016) and Le Sillon (2018) are published by \\"Le Tripode\\". For these first novels, the author drew inspiration from Turkey, a country dear to her, in order to weave her narrative. With Calme et tranquille, Manteau wrote a biographical account between intimate memories and collective drama, or when violence suddenly breaks into daily life. For Le Sillon, the author focuses on the story of Hrant Dink, a Turkish journalist and writer of Armenian origin, who was murdered for defending an ideal of peace. She associates him with her own wandering in the streets of Istanbul. In 2018, she received the Prix Renaudot for this second book.

Early life  Marks was born on 1 April 1861 in Croydon, Surrey (now London), the son of John G. Marks. His family included a number of successful artists, including Henry Stacey Marks (1829-1898) and Frederick Walker (1840-1875), both uncles, and William Walker, his great- grandfather. His grandfather was the jeweller W. H. Walker. His early career included roles as a clerk (not, as might be expected, as an apprentice silversmith) to a firm of silversmiths,possibly Holland, Aldwinckle & Slater of Jewin Crescent, City of London rising to be a manager at a wool merchants, Masurel & Fils (still extant, as Segard Masurel). In 1888, while still at Masurel & Fils, he married Florence Elizabeth Ford.  Career  A standing cup and cover (1900‚Äì01) by Marks, now in the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum Marks gave his first solo exhibition in 1895, at the jewellers Johnson, Walker & Tolhurst, 80 Aldersgate Street, in the City of London. He exhibited there regularly, until 1901. Between 1897 and 1903 exhibited at the Royal Academy, Walker Art Gallery, Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts, and Leeds City Art Gallery. He had a solo show at the Fine Art Society in London in May 1899. His maker's mark, his initials 'GM', was registered at Goldsmiths' Hall in 1896. In 1897 he made the body of a silver casket, to a design by George Frampton, for the Skinner's Company (subsequently presented to the Speaker of the House of Commons, William Court Gully. Frampton made the enamelled lid. It is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum. His own silver work, in the Arts and Crafts style, was characterised by being unpolished and unturned, so still showing the marks left by his tools. He designed all his own pieces, which were produced by hand, without the use of dies, and with no piece duplicated. They were decorated with subjects from nature, such as flowers, fruit, and leaves, or, on later works, fish or lizards. and were occasionally embellished with semi-precious stones. He also produced a few works in pewter, and on at last one occasion, a casket in patinated steel, with bronze and silver inlay. His clients included Edward VII, for whom he made cups and bowls, and Croydon Borough Council, for whom he made the official ceremonial mace. He died on 5 February 1905, aged 43, after a long period of ill health. His estate was valued at probate at ¬£3,120 14s 7d.  Legacy  Marks' works are in a number of significant collections, including those of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths,, the Worshipful Company of Pewterers, the Honourable Society of the Inner Temple, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Fitzwilliam Museum (two silver pieces and four in pewter), the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum and the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. The Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths say he was \\"regarded as one of the most skilled silversmith of his generation\\".

January 6, 1849) was a member of the Vincentian Order of priests connected to mission work (Congregation of the Mission) serving the mid-western section of the United States. Ecclesiastical career Europe Cellini was born in the province of Ascoli Piceno, Marche Region, Italy around 1781. By 1818 he was the chaplain of the Hospital Santo Sprito in Rome in the Rione neighborhood near Vatican City. That same year (at age thirty-seven) he was accorded the habit of the Vincentian Order (whose patron is St. Vincent de Paul) and through the command of Bishop Louis Dubourg of St. Louis who was seeking priests to fulfill missionary work in the United States, Cellini and two other priests, Filippo Borgna and Antonio Potini, traveled to the Midwestern section of the U.S. Journey to America Cellini sailed from Livorno, Italy on July 2, 1818 to Gibraltar where on the 24th, he took another ship to Philadelphia. His journey from Europe to the U.S. took a reported ‚Äúsixty-five days‚Äù with sixty of those days on open water without sight of land. Upon arrival at Philadelphia (landing around October 4), passengers were placed into quarantine. He wrote to Italy on October 8 informing Rome of his arrival. Proof of the letter exists in the archives at the Montecitorio in Rome. At that time, the Montecitorio was the seat of the Curia apostolica or, papal court.Rothensteiner, J. E. \\"Chronicles of an old Missouri parish: Historical sketches of St. Michael's Church, Fredericktown, Madison County, MO.\\" St. Louis, Mo, Amerika Print, 1971. Missouri The clergymen ultimately settled at St. Mary of the Barrens in Perryville, Missouri in 1819.Holweck, F. G. (1918). Historical archives of the Archdiocese of St. Louis. St. Louis: Catholic Historical Society of St. Louis. In the early 1800s the parish church and its surrounding community was in a very primitive state. The young community lacked basic shelter and so Cellini and others, including Du Bourg, ‚Äúlabored like hired work [men]‚Äù in the sun. After a period of time in Missouri, Cellini was then appointed ‚ÄúProcurator and General Factotum‚Äù of the parish church, that is he was charged with handling financial matters along with general clerical duties. In this period, Cellini was serving a community of ‚Äúseventy French people‚Äù, a fact found in a letter written by Joseph Rosati who would later serve as first bishop of the Diocese of Saint Louis. Cellini received his education in Italy and Italian was his native language. However once assigned to the Midwestern region of the U.S., he had to communicate with parishioners in their native tongues‚ÄîFrench and English. ‚ÄúThe zealous father preached every Sunday in French or English, but never could, in these alien tongues, acquire that perfect mastery‚Ä¶he possessed in the Italian. Besides he was subject to a slight stammer in his speech, which was scarcely noticeable except when the right word failed him.‚Äù In published accounts of the era the reverend listed as Francis, under the English variant of his given name or he is seen listed as Francois, the French variant. Louisiana From Missouri, Cellini went on to serve as Pastor of Sacred Heart in Grand Coteau, Louisiana where he worked from 1822-1824. He is also documented as having been a part of St. Charles Borromeo Catholic Church in Grand Coteau.Widman, C. M., & W.,\\"Outlines of history‚ÄîSt. Charles' Church, Grand Coteau, La\\",September 01, 1898, \\"Records of the American Catholic Historical Society of Philadelphia\\" pages 9, 3, 343-351.H√©bert, D. J., Southwest Louisiana records (1750-1900). Rayne, La, 2001, H√©bert Publications. There is historical debate on why he left Grand Coteau, especially when his work was needed there and he not only ministered spiritual needs but his medical abilities were extensive, owing to the fact he‚Äôd reportedly been ‚Äúa surgeon in the Italian army‚Äù so his skills were commanded.Shoemaker, F. \\"Madison County. \\"Missouri Historical Review\\", 53 (1), 10-21, 1958. Cellini‚Äôs combination of clergyman-doctor was unique and was a bonus to the Catholic Church in the Midwest. ‚Äú‚Ä¶ the good Father found himself he also found body miseries and ills that called forth his sympathy and healing power.‚Äù Fueling debate as to why he left Louisiana, information in the St. Louis Catholic Historical Review of January‚ÄìApril 1922 noted Cellini took it upon himself to accept a donation in the name of the parish inter- vivos (third-party fiduciary relationship) from Mary Smith (nee, Santee) of Opelousas, Louisiana while she was ill. The large donation was to be used for a preparatory seminary and Smith had a history of providing donations to the church at Opelousas.Rothensteiner, J. E.,\\"The First Years of Bishop Kenrick‚Äôs Administration of St. Louis Diocese\\", St. Louis Catholic Historical Review, 5 (4), 10-21, 1922. It was Cellini‚Äôs (and possibly Potini‚Äôs) personal acceptance of the donation consisting of slaves, personal effects and real estate holdings that troubled church hierarchy. Even Smith reportedly asked Cellini to ‚Äúannul the donation‚Äù so to avoid trouble over the ‚Äúappearance of the transaction‚Äù. Tensions involving Cellini reached a climax to the point there were ‚Äúthreats on his life‚Äù.Rybolt, J. E., \\"The American Vincentians: A popular history of the congregation of the mission in the United States 1815-1987\\", Brooklyn: Vincentian Studies Institute,1988. Cellini‚Äôs superiors (chiefly Dubourg and Rosati) made a decision at that point to suspend him as well as to remove him from his post. Brief return to Europe Over this, Cellini became angry and met with Rosati to appeal for a ‚Äúdemission of vows‚Äù and a return to Rome. In the summer of 1825, Cellini did return to Rome and from there filed a complaint stating, ‚Äú‚Ä¶Bishop Du Bourg had deprived him of the office of a Parish Priest‚Ä¶in the diocese of Bardstown (Kentucky).‚Äù Due to a lack of historical documentation, there is a gap on the whereabouts of Cellini during the mid-1820s. The gap is likely due to the fact he simply remained in Italy under the supervision of Antonio Baccari, Vicar General of the Congregation of the Mission in Rome, without much contact with United States prelates. Return to Missouri However, his time overseas was short. Cellini was back in the United States by 1827 as member of the diocesan clergy of St. Louis, Missouri. Rosati, then in St. Louis, assigned him to the Parishes of Prairie du Rocher and Kaskaskia (both in Randolph County, Illinois) where he remained until 1830 (some sources claim 1829).Illinois Catholic Historical Society,1919, \\"Illinois catholic historical review\\". Chicago, Ill,Loyola University Press.Vincentian Heritage Journal, Vol. 5, Issue 2, Article 5, Fall 1984 Recollections of the Establishment of the Congregation of the Mission in the United States, part 6, Joseph Rosati C.M. Following his departure from Illinois, Cellini was appointed pastor of St. Michael the Archangel Parish in Fredericktown, Missouri. Cellini either purchased the land for the sanctuary through his own funds or made the purchase on behalf of the curia. Per Rosati's report to the Leopoldine Society of Europe on March 10, 1830 he notes, ‚ÄúAs the Catholic population was increasing, Cellini in 1829 started the work of building a church on his land in Fredericktown‚Äù. It is estimated the new church was completed by 1831. At this time, Smith of Opelousas, Louisiana returned to aid the clergy helping fund the first institution for higher learning in Madison County, Missouri. It was through her donations that a convent for the Sisters of Loretto was built under Cellini‚Äôs direction. In addition, a school for girls was completed. Proof of the school is documented in the ‚ÄúShepherd of the Valley‚Äù, the first Catholic newspaper published west of the Mississippi River. Vicar General of St Louis In 1845, Cellini was made Vicar General of the Diocese of St. Louis.\\"Catholic Cabinet and Chronicle of Religious Intelligence\\", Vol. 2. 1845, St. Louis, Missouri In his advanced age, he remained primarily in St. Louis and retired to the structure that is today the House of the Guardian Angel, founded by the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul. Death At the time of his death on January 6, 1849, Cellini was reportedly the eldest priest in the St. Louis Diocese. Subsequently that same year, his godchild died of cholera as did diocese benefactor Smith.Archdiocese of Saint Louis Archives and Records, Correspondence between Archbishop Kenrick and priests, 1849 Cellini is buried at Calvary Cemetery and Mausoleum, St. Louis, Missouri.

It originates from the Reno canal, which owes its name (and waters) to the Reno River, from which it originates at the Chiusa di Casalecchio di Reno.  Geography  The Navile runs from south to north; it goes through the town of Bologna and crosses the Bolognese plain until it joins the Reno river once again near Passo Segni after a journey of about 40 km, of which 5.3 from the Chiusa di Casalecchio to Bova di Via Lame (where the Port was located). Its regime is partly determined by adjustments of the locks, partly by the collection of meteoric waters in Bologna and a portion of the plain; its ordinary average flow rates can be estimated at 10 cubic meters per second, while the maximum flow can reach 100 cubic meters per second.  History  The Chiusa di Casalecchio di Reno, where the Canale di Reno originates, was built in the upper Middle Ages as an impressive work of hydraulic engineering in masonry: the Chiusa has a width of over 250 meters and the intake work with the canal and the spillovers has a length of over 2 km, entirely in masonry, which made it one of the most outstanding such works in Europe at the time. It is thought that the primitive construction dates back to before the year 1000, but according to other Authors the date of the first construction is the 1191. Destroyed several times by the ruinous floods of the Reno, it has always been rebuilt and represents, still today, one of the greatest examples of hydraulic engineering existing and built before the advent of reinforced concrete. In 1548 the first port was built in Bologna, along the Navile, to serve the increasing commercial flows to and from the city. The canal was used for navigation until as late as 1948. After the Port of Bologna was dismantled, the canal has been exclusively used for irrigation and reclamation, as it is no longer suitable for navigable use. Sometimes, during floods, it floods into the countryside. The reclamation canal Diversivo collects the excess water from the Navile and joins the Savena canal at Casoni, part of the municipality of Malalbergo. However, a series of locks remain of the Bolognese port system and of the navigable past. In 1866, water from a well nearby the Port was bottled and locally sold; it was explicitly advertised as healthy, although the city had suffered from cholera until a few years earlier.Marco Poli, Cose d'altri tempi.

He is also a former city manager of Kazan, former deputy of the State Duma, member of the United Russia political party, and co- owner of the scientific and production company Potok Inter.  Education  In April 2006, a press release was distributed by the Kazan City Duma apparatus, which stated that \\"Marat Zagidullov has three degrees in higher education, including a diploma from the University of California at Los Angeles.\\" However, after an investigation by Kazan journalist Irek Murtazin, who concluded that Marat Zagidullov was expelled from the University of California, Zagidullov's biography was amended on the official website of the executive committee: instead of \\"graduated from the University of California\\" they wrote \\"he studied at the University of California.\\"  Career  At the age of 22, he became the general director of the commercial house Rus, owned by his uncle, Rafael Gimalov. From 1998 to 1999, Zagidullov was the Executive Director of the Central Fuel Company. In 2000, he was appointed Head of the Property Management Department of Finance, Credit, Insurance and Foreign Economic Organizations of the State Property Committee. Two years after the appointment, Zagidullov's apartment was robbed, and significant damage was caused: > A lot of value can be found in rented apartments of some high officials. On > February 25, 2002, the 27-year-old head of the State Property Committee of > the Russian Federation, Marat Zagidullov, said that at 5.30 am five > unidentified men in sportswear got into his rented apartment on Bolshaya > Dorogomilovskaya Street, broke the lock, tied up a sleepy lodger and stole > $6,000, a Pioneer TV, a cashmere jacket, a mink coat, a Panasonic video > recorder, a Sony CD player, a Cartier wristwatch, a Sony video camera, and a > leather jacket and then disappeared. The total material damage amounted to > 3.6 million rubles. In 2004, Zagidullov was Advisor to the President of Transcreditbank, First CEO Deputy of Motovilikha Plants and then Chairman of the Board of Directors of Ekonatsbank, which subsequently went bankrupt. From 2005, Zagidullov was Chairman of the Board of Directors of Sibintek. In 2006, he headed the executive committee of the Kazan municipal union. From 2007 to 2011, he was a State Duma deputy on the federal list of United Russia party candidates.  City manager of Kazan  When Zagidullov was city manager of Kazan, he organized the purchase of nearly 800 Chinese buses to replenish the city's public transport fleet through a network of intermediary firms that ensured a several-fold increase in the purchase price compared to the manufacturer's price. Within a few years, the city authorities decided to completely get rid of these buses due to frequent breakdowns and a lack of spare parts. The company Sibintek, shares of which Zagidullov bought from YUKOS before taking office as Kazan city manager, became the executor of the largest IT programs of the Kazan mayor's office headed by himself.  Criminal case  In 2013, Nikolai Bukhvalov, CEO of Motovilikha Plants, appealed to the Investigative Committee of Russia, requesting a legal assessment of the actions of former shareholder Marat Zagidullov. According to the applicant, while managing the enterprise from 2002 to 2009, Zagidullov, acting together with others, caused property damage to the company of more than 1.268 billion rubles by issuing loans to a number of legal entities that were not subsequently returned. Shortly thereafter, a criminal case was initiated into the question of property damage to Motovilikha Plants. However, in November 2014, the criminal case was discontinued \\"due to the absence of corpus delicti in the actions of the defendants.\\"  Investments  Zagidullov invested in the system integrator Sibintek, the system of instant payments Qiwi India and a social network advertising business. Zagidullov's investment activities are regularly covered by the Kommersant newspaper journalist Elena Kiselyova. = Potok Inter = In 2014, Zagidullov acquired half of the air disinfection unit manufacturer Potok Inter, estimating the amount of further investment in the company at $200 million over the next three years. According to Zagidullov, the production of Potok Inter has no analogues, destroys any microorganisms (including viruses), passing them through a tense electric field, and is patented in Russia, the EU and the USA. The company's website states that air disinfection occurs due to the effect of electroporation of the microorganism cell membrane. Potok Inter is a consistently unprofitable enterprise; the total loss for 2013‚Äì2018 amounted to 500 million rubles. In 2016, the company announced that it intended to file for bankruptcy. = Eurokappa = Zagidullov is the primary owner of Sun Smile LLC (trademark \\"Eurokappa\\"), whose losses for 2017 and 2018 amounted to 16.8 and 85.2 million rubles, respectively.

Booth's writings covered the early Federation of Australia from a Queensland perspective, possibly influenced by the earlier 1890s Central Queensland Territorial Separation League and the ongoing North Queensland separation movements. Personal life Heber Hedley Booth was one of four surviving children of Ernest Hardwick Booth (d. 1915) and Mary Annie Wilcox (d. 1896). Ernest served as chair for a gold mine, was later an auctioneer, although was insolvent by 1898. Brother James went on to become a surgeon based in Melbourne, and later president of the Australian Literary Society. First educated at Gympie on a scholarship, he spent three years at the Brisbane Grammar School, before being employed at fifteen years-of-age with the postal service as a telegraphist at Greenmount, near Toowoomba in 1879. Following Greenmount, he was posted to Rockhampton from 1882 to 1898. On 30 January 1895, Booth married Harriett Elizabeth de Gruchy, the daughter of John William de Gruchy and Isabella Leslie, of Highfields, Toowoomba. Her father was from Jersey, Channel Islands, and a mother from Dublin, Ireland. Harriett was born in Toowoomba. He was later chosen to take charge of the telegraph station at Junction Creek near Georgetown. Harriett found herself as the only non-indigenous woman in the area for over six months. In July 1900, Booth was transferred to Ingham. His postmaster postings formed his poems: Boulia, Cooktown, Maytown, Palmer, Richmond, Springsure, Thornborough, Burketown (1903‚Äì1908), Normanton (1908‚Äì1909), Cloncurry (1911), Proserpine (1912‚Äì1923), Paddington (1925), and Kilcoy (1925). After fifty years of employment, Booth retired from the post and telegraph department in Kilcoy in 1929, and he and his wife moved to Redcliffe. Booth was a member of the Queensland Authors and Artists' Association, as well as the Brisbane Chess Club. His wife Harriett, aged 67, died on 19 January 1931 at Saint Helen's Private Hospital, Peel Street, South Brisbane, and was interred at the Toowong Cemetery. Later he moved in as a boarder with former Brisbane socialite and Girl Guides leader, and The Telegraph journalist Phoebe Edith Kingsnorth 'Aunt Jo' Kirwan (1896‚Äì1989) at Moggill Road, Taringa, Brisbane. After a long illness Booth died on 9 August 1936, and cremated at the Mount Thompson Crematorium. Kirwan was nominated as the executor of his will. Poetry It was once opined that Booth, unlike other Queensland poets of the time including James Brunton Stephens (1835‚Äì1902) and George Essex Evans (1863‚Äì1909)), was a Queenslander by birth. Booth's pen name Opal was an association with his State of origin, Queensland; although he had written under Haidee previously. Due to his movement through the State due to his employment, many of his poems referred to northern Australia. Through his first posting to Greenmount Booth met lifelong friend Arthur Hoey Davis (1868‚Äì1935), better known as the author Steele Rudd. Rudyard Kipling appeared to have influenced the Queensland poet in some of his writings, while it was indicated he borrowed from George Meredith and Longfellow, and even Henry Lawson. Booth's poems were published under his pen name in the Australian newspapers. The release of his anthology was considered to be a mixture of 'the gay and the serious' with 'no definite style in the verses'. Opalodes: Patriotic and miscellaneous verses, dedicated to his wife, was printed by Powell and Company in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia in August 1909, priced at two shillings and sixpence (123 pages). Poems were given as of 'no particular literary quality, but they have in them a good swing and the embodiment of a patriotic hope'. One critique commented 'For Mr. Booth is content to publish some of the least metrical lines which ever passed for verse'. It has several divisions: 'Patriotic', 'Triolets' (an eight line poem with only two rhymes, in the form of 'ABxAxxAB'), and 'Breezes from the Gulf of Carpentaria'. Poems included 'The dawn of Federation', 'Edelweiss', 'Bereaved', 'Reincarnation', 'The ballad of the Burketown alligator', 'Trafalgar', 'The Australian Fleet', 'Estranged: A Gulfie's reverie', 'An Australian matron's challenge to the men of our Commonwealth', 'The great Gulf conference', 'Ballade of Gladstone (Queensland)', 'Queensland in 1902-03', 'Sunset on the Berserker Mountains', 'The young commander', 'Easter-tide', and 'To many a Queensland mate'. A number of comments contained political comment of proceedings of the time, such as the White Australia policy and 'The federal capital site through northern glasses'. Heber H. Booth, date unknown His patriotic efforts can be seen in 'Australia, our own' (third of five verses): :Ne'er before the world has seen, ::Australia, Beloved! :Such a young and untried Queen, ::Australia, Our Own, :Trusted with such ample sway :As is yours to wield always, :Through the blinding lightnings play :Round your ocean circled throne, Australia‚Äî :As we list to your bugles blown. Several of Booth's poems were included in Louis Lataver's collection of the best Australian sonnets. After what became his only published anthology, Booth produced some more patriotic and other verses. Reflecting his posting at the North Queensland sugar cane town, he wrote in 1913 (last two verses): :The scrubs were upriven, the plains were part cleared, :And soon happy homes o'er the landscape appeared, :While the serpentine river‚Äîa miniature Nile, :Saw the township of Proserpine born with a smile. :So Proserpine grows, scarce three leagues from the sea, :And twines round all hearts, for her welcome is free; :And the three thousand souls who no further would roam, :To thirty shall swell, who will love her as‚Äî\\"Home.\\" It was suggested that this type of 'conventional Australian verse... will probably win the wider public'.

Background Prior to the Lunacy (Scotland) Act, lunacy legislation in Scotland was enshrined in the Madhouses (Scotland) Act 1815 which established the right of Scottish Sheriffs to order the inspection of madhouses. However the Scottish Lunacy Commission inquiry which reported in 1857 found that the official oversight of mental health institutions \\"remained at best variable and at worst simply inadequate\\". It recommended the formation of a \\"Scottish Lunacy Board\\" who would address the shortfall in oversight. Provisions The legislation created a General Board of Commissioners in Lunacy for Scotland. It also created district boards with the power to establish and operate publicly funded \\"district asylums\\" for patients who could not afford the fees charged by existing private and charitable \\"Royal Asylums\\". These existing \\"Royal Asylums\\" (with Royal Charters) included the Aberdeen Royal Lunatic Asylum, the Crichton Royal Institution, the Dundee Royal Lunatic Asylum, the Royal Edinburgh Lunatic Asylum, the Glasgow Royal Lunatic Asylum, the Montrose Royal Lunatic Asylum and James Murray's Royal Lunatic Asylum.Keane, p. 30 The aim of the legislation was to establish a network of \\"district asylums\\" with coverage throughout Scotland.

Sunazawa is respected for helping make the Ainu culture known to the world through his works performed in the Ainu manner. Sunazawa is also known for designing the Ainu flag in 1971. His son Oki, an Ainu Japanese musician, applies the same approach to music. Biography =Early years= He was born as Hisao Sunazawa in 1931 to parents Koa-kanno and Peramonkoro Sunazawa who were prominent figures in the movement for Ainu land and civil rights. \\"Bikki\\" was a nickname from his boyhood. His mother Peramonkoro was also one of the most respected Japan's textile artists of the twentieth century. In his late teens, Sunazawa worked with his family and other people to establish a new settlement. He left Hokkaido for Tokyo at the age of 21 to get caught up in the Japan's avant-garde art world of the 1950s and 1960s. He was later recognized as a leading sculptor in Japanese post-war art. By the 1970s, he returned to Hokkaido and was heavily involved in the Ainu liberation movement. =Later years= Having to disguise his Ainu art because of the ban imposed by the Japanese in the early twentieth century, Sunazawa devoted all his life to the defense of the Ainu culture. He was one of the first initiators of establishing connections with the Native American tribes, through the exhibition of some of his sculptures in British Columbia where he settled for a time. With his fame growing, he continued to use his art to disseminate Ainu culture via explanations of his creations, interviews, relations within the artistic community, and so on. As a sign of respect, two Japanese amateur astronomers, Kin Endate and Kazuro Watanabe, gave his name to the minor planet 5372 that they discovered on November 29, 1987. =Death= Bikki Sunazawa died on January 25, 1989 because of bone marrow cancer in the Sapporo Aiiku Hospital.

Their family was enslaved to David Leggroan of Mississippi. On May 4th, 1858, she married Samuel Chambers, and they were freed together after the American Civil War.  Samuel Chambers  Chambers was born in Pickens County, Alabama on 21 May, 1831, to James Davidson, and his slave, Hester Gillespie. He was secretly baptized at the age of 13 by Thomas Preston, a recent convert to the church. In 1850, he married Priscilla Beasley, with whom he had one child, named Peter. After the Civil War, he began sharecropping and shoemaking for a living.  Life in Utah  In 1870, Samuel and Amanda migrated to Utah with her brother Edward and his wife, along with Samuel's teenaged son. They arrived in Salt Lake City on April 27, 1870. The Chambers quickly became involved with the activities of the Eighth ward, Samuel receiving a calling as an assistant deacon, and Amanda becoming a Relief society \\"deaconess\\". They became very successful in fruit and berry cultivation. In 1875, Amanda was baptized into the church, after living in Utah for 5 years. Both Samuel and Amanda received their patriarchal blessings on September 5th, 1874, from patriarch John Smith, which stated that they would live long lives, prosper among the saints, and be blessed materially. Amanda died on March 10th, 1929, at the age of 85, and Samuel passed several months later, on November 7th, 1929. They were posthumously sealed together and to their parents in the Jordan River Utah Temple, on April 20th, 1984.

He played a key role in the early Muslim conquests of Egypt, Barqa (Cyrenaica) and Ifriqiya. When the latter province fell to a Byzantine‚ÄìBerber alliance in 682, Zuhayr was given command of the army to restore Arab rule. During that campaign, he temporarily retook Kairouan, the Arabs' capital in Ifriqiya, and killed the Berber chief Kasila, but was slain by Byzantine raiders on his way back to Barqa. Life The purported tomb of Zuhayr ibn Qays in Derna, Libya (pictured in 2010) Zuhayr belonged to the Bali tribe, itself part of the larger Quda'a confederation that was present throughout Syria and the northern Hejaz.Khoury 2002, p. 559. He is considered by some Muslim sources, namely Ibn Hajar and al-Suyuti, as a sahabi (companion) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, while al-Suyuti also places him with the second-generation of Muslims, known as the tabi'un. According to Ibn Hajar, Zuhayr participated in the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 639. He later served as a lieutenant commander in the army of Uqba ibn Nafi during the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb in 670. In that campaign, he played a role in the capture of Sirte and was made its governor. The Arabs established the town of Kairouan in Ifriqiya to garrison their troops and families and when Uqba advanced west of Kairouan, Zuhayr accompanied him.Talbi 1986, p. 518. As Uqba campaigned in the region of Sous (in modern-day Morocco), he ordered Zuhayr to return with the majority of the Arab troops to Kairouan to defend the city from an impending Byzantine attack. Uqba was subsequently slain by the Byzantine-backed Berbers led by Kasila in 682.McKenna 2011, p. 40. Panic ensued among the Arab troops of Kairouan; the majority sided with Hanash al-San'ani, who advocated for withdrawal to Barqa (Cyrenaica), while Zuhayr favored resistance. The army ultimately withdrew. Meanwhile, a major political crisis gripped much of the Umayyad Caliphate with the outbreak of the Second Muslim Civil War. Zuhayr entered the service of the governor of Egypt, Ibn Jahdam, who was allied with the Umayyads' rival, the Mecca-based Caliph Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr. He fought alongside Ibn Jahdam during an assault against the Umayyad prince and general Abd al-Aziz ibn Marwan at Ayla on Syria's Red Sea coast. The Umayyads ultimately seized Egypt and Abd al-Aziz became its governor, after which he and Zuhayr reconciled, though Abd al-Aziz remained wary of him. He installed Zuhayr as deputy governor of Barqa with instructions to combat the resurgent Byzantines. Tensions developed between the governor and Zuhayr when the former disparaged him; Zuhayr responded that because of his role in the rescension of the Qur'an, he ought to be treated honorably. According to the historian Mohamed Talbi, Abd al-Aziz's brother, the Caliph Abd al-Malik, appointed Zuhayr to lead a campaign to defeat the Byzantine‚ÄìBerber alliance and restore the Arab position in Ifriqiya. To that end, Zuhayr recaptured Kairouan and drove the Berbers west to Mams, where he slew Kasila. It is unclear when these events precisely occurred, but it was sometime prior to Zuhayr's death at the hands of Byzantine raiders in Barqa in 688. In that incident, the historian Reif Georges Khoury writes that Zuhayr \\"died valiantly with 70 of his companions before the rest of the troops could come to his aid\\".

He is best known for being the winner of the 1978 Cheltenham Gold Cup. He had the physical build of a chaser but was also a fluent mover. He was hit with leg trouble when at the height of his career.  Background and early days in Ireland  Foaled in 1971, Midnight Court was sired by the 1963 Ascot Gold Cup winner Twilight Alley. Midnight Court‚Äôs dam Strumpet, won a low grade maiden race on the flat.Chasers & Hurdlers 1977/78 A Timeform Publication Portway Press Ltd Midnight Court was bred at the Airlie Stud in Ireland.airliestud.com Reared as a store horse, he was sold to Toss Taaffe then went through the Tom Costello academy.Thoroughbred Owner Breeder July 9, 2015 He won two races over hurdles as well as winning a bumper race. He was then bought and transferred to England, where he went into training with Fred Winter at Uplands Stables, Lambourn.  1976/77 season  Midnight Court appeared on the racecourse six times, winning on three occasions. His first two outings came in handicap hurdles in November. He won both, firstly over two and a half miles at Chepstow, then over a furlong further at Newbury. Midnight Court was then switched to fences for his remaining four outings. After finishing third over three miles at Ascot, then being brought down on his next run, he opened his account over fences when winning the Beech Open Novices Chase over two and a half miles at Sandown Park in March. Ridden by his regular jockey John Francome, he delivered his challenge at the final fence and went to the front on the run-in to beat Arlonstown Boy by two lengths. On his final appearance, in the Heinz Novices Handicap Chase over two and a half miles at Ascot, Midnight Court carried 11st 11lb in to second place behind Commandant, leading for much of the race but tiring and being caught on the run-in.  1977/78 season  Midnight Court was unbeaten in seven starts which culminated with a victory in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. His first two starts were over two and a half miles, an Embassy Premier Chase qualifier at Newbury in October, then the Baxter Gate Chase at Doncaster where he won narrowly from Casamayor after receiving a bump from another runner in the home straight. Midnight Court‚Äôs next two appearances, both prior to Christmas, were over three miles at Ascot. He won the Kirk And Kirk Handicap Chase by five lengths from Ghost Writer, to whom he was conceding 10 lb, then the SGB Chase by two lengths from Master Spy, carrying top weight of 12 st. In both contests Midnight Court had too much late pace for his rivals and won with Francome easing up. In what was intended to be his preparation race for Cheltenham, Midnight Court reverted to two and a half miles when lining up for the Morgan Grenfell Geoffrey Gilbey Memorial Handicap Chase at Newbury, where he carried two stone more than the runner up Young Arthur. Originally scheduled for its normal March date, the 1978 Cheltenham Gold Cup was postponed due to snow making the course unraceable. The rescheduled Gold Cup took place four weeks later. In the interim period Midnight Court had appeared in the Aynsley China Cup Chase at Chepstow, where he won without being stretched. Run on ground described as Good, ten runners lined up for the Cheltenham Gold Cup. Midnight Court started the 5/2 second favourite behind the Fulke Walwyn-trained Fort Devon. The field included the 1976 winner of the race, Royal Frolic, the recent Irish Grand National winner Brown Lad, and the King George VI Chase winner Bachelor‚Äôs Hall. In the race, Francome sat Midnight Court prominently behind the leaders. Rounding the home turn, Midnight Court came up on the inside to join Fort Devon and Royal Frolic. Francome sent Midnight Court to the front and by the second last, the pair were pulling clear. They jumped the last ten lengths ahead of Royal Frolic, who took a heavy fall, and passed the post seven lengths clear of the staying-on Brown Lad, with Master H back in third. Midnight Court ended the season with a Timeform rating of 164, and received the organisation‚Äôs ‚ÄòBest Staying Chaser‚Äô award.  1978/1979 season  Midnight Court sustained an injury in his off fore leg and missed the whole of the season.  1979/1980 season  Midnight Court appeared twice without winning. He reappeared in the four-runner Peterborough Chase at Huntingdon in November, after a twenty month absence from action. The Timeform representative at the track described him as looking ‚Äúunusually soft in condition for a runner from the Winter stable‚Äù,Chasers & Hurdlers 1979/80 A Timeform Publication Portway Press Ltd and he finished third with the race being won by his stable companion Chumson. Midnight Court then reverted to hurdles in the Long Walk Hurdle at Ascot where he finished fifth, beaten a long way. It was discovered that he had sustained a tendon injury which put him out of action for the remainder of the season.  1980/1981 season  Midnight Court ran seven times, winning once. The victory came in his first run of the season, in the Tote Treble Hurdle at Cheltenham in January. After pulling up in another hurdle race on his next start he then switched back to fences, carrying top weight in the Jerry M Handicap Chase at Lingfield. He tired in the later stages to finish a respectable third. The Raceform representative at the meeting, John Sharratt, wrote, ‚ÄúTo be realistic, this does not appear good enough for another successful tilt at the Gold Cup but one more run over fences could see him more of his old self.‚ÄùChaseform Note Book 1980/1981 Published by Raceform Ltd Midnight Court appeared again less than two weeks later when he fell before halfway in a handicap chase at Newbury. Midnight Court then lined up for the 1981 running of the Cheltenham Gold Cup. Starting at 14/1, he made headway at halfway, but was beaten four fences from the finish and eventually came home last of the nine finishers, the race won by the Peter Easterby-trained Little Owl. Midnight Court appeared twice after the Gold Cup, falling on both occasions. On the final start, in the Three Fives Golden Miller Chase at Cheltenham he was disputing the lead when he came down at the second last. He ended the season with a Timeform rating of 155.Chasers & Hurdlers 1980/81 A Timeform Publication Portway Press Ltd  1981/1982 season  After being sent hunting, Midnight Court returned to Fred Winter and won three of his four starts, ridden by the stable‚Äôs amateur rider Oliver Sherwood on each occasion. He reappeared in a Foxhunters race at Newbury in February where he beat inferior rivals comfortably. His next race was later in the month in the Pennine Chase at Doncaster. He faced two rivals, including the 1981 Cheltenham Gold Cup runner-up Night Nurse. Midnight Court ran a highly credible race to finish in second place, twelve lengths behind Night Nurse. A week prior to the Cheltenham Gold Cup he contested a Foxhunters race at Wincanton, winning without being troubled. The Raceform representative at the meeting wrote, ‚Äú‚Ä¶ he is not the horse he was and talk of the Gold Cup would seem to be wishful thinking.‚ÄùChaseform Note Book 1981/1982 Published by Raceform Ltd Midnight Court missed the Gold Cup and instead ran in a Foxhunters race at Newcastle later in the week. Starting long odds on, he won easily. Midnight Court ended the season with a Timeform rating of 139, indicating that he was now far inferior to the horse he was at his peak.Chasers & Hurdlers 1981/82 A Timeform Publication Portway Press Ltd  Later career After leaving Fred Winter Midnight Court returned to his owner Mrs Olive Jackson. He ran in three Foxhunter races as a thirteen year old in the spring of 1984. On the second of those outings he won at Nottingham.

The main raw materials are wheat flour and chili. After adding water, salt, sugar, natural pigment and other surface, the flour is extruded under high temperature, then mixed with chili and other seasonings including preservatives whose component matches Chinese food additive Standard GB2760. Processed food products entail some risks, particularly in smaller kitchens. Specific risks are the quality of oil, food additives such as carmine and sanitation.  History  Latiao (Spicy strip), originated in Pingjiang County, Hunan. It was at first called mianjin (). Later, Pingjiang people called it . Latiao is made from flour that is cooked and seasoned, and is not fried and spicy. Pingjiang has a history of making dried sauce, spicy sauce and spicy bean curd, which are important parts of the Pingjiang industry. In 1998, a major flood disaster occurred in Hunan, which led to a serious loss of agricultural products. Soybean, the main raw material for sauce industry, experienced a large decline in production.This directly caused a devastating blow to the dried sauce industry. In order to support the family, farmers urgently needed a new approach. Qiu Pingjiang, Li Mengneng, and Zhong Qingyuan used wheat flour instead of soy flour. Using single-screw extrusion machinery, adding chili, pepper, cumin, sugar, salt, vegetable oil and other condiments, they invented Latiao. In 1990 Latiao debuted and quickly became popular across China.

The NF's rise in 1973‚Äì74 was noticed by the leaders of major social and political groups but they generally ignored it, hoping that depriving it of additional publicity would hasten its decline. Two groups that took a different approach were the Jewish community and the far- left. Concerned by the Front's anti-Semitism, the Board of Deputies of British Jews for instance produced anti-NF literature. The British far-left followed the older arguments of Marxist thinkers like Leon Trotsky that a fascist movement was being prepared by the ruling bourgeois amid capitalist crisis to replace the liberal democratic order with an authoritarian state that could crush the working-class movement. Approaches to the NF differed among far-left groups. The Communist Party of Great Britain and Labour Party Young Socialists sought to mobilise the labour movement against racism to diffuse the NF's appeal. The International Marxist Group and International Socialists/Socialist Workers Party instead favoured direct action to disrupt the NF, holding to the slogan: \\"No platform for fascists\\". At its April 1974 annual conference, the National Union of Students‚Äîthen influenced by the International Marxist Group‚Äîadopted a 'no platform' policy regarding the NF. The National Union of Mineworkers called for a government ban of the party. By the October 1974 election, the Labour Party forbade its candidates to share public platforms, radio, or television slots with NF candidates. 120 Labour-controlled councils banned the party from using local municipal halls. In the mid-1970s, Labour and the Trade Union Congress (TUC) helped mobilise the trade union movement at the grassroots level against the NF. The TUC had previously been reticent about launching large-scale anti-racist campaigns, but agreed to do so amid growing far-left pressure and an awareness of the threat to trade unionism posed by a resurgent fascist movement. In 1977, a joint Labour/TUC project launched a political broadcast that interspersed footage of the NF with that of Hitler and Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini; it also issued a leaflet titled \\"The National Front is a Nazi Front\\" containing the phrase: \\"Yesterday ‚Äì the Jews; today coloured people; tomorrow you\\". Anti-fascist and anti-racist groups appeared in response to the NF and other racist activities, co-ordinating their efforts through the National Co-Ordinating Committee founded in September 1977. In November 1977, various left and far-left groups launched the Anti-Nazi League (ANL); it attracted public endorsements from several Labour politicians, trade union leaders, academics, actors, and sports people. Some of these later distanced themselves from it amid concerns that its sub-campaign, School Kids Against the Nazis, was politicising school pupils with far-left propaganda. In 1976 Rock Against Racism was launched, holding two well-attended music festivals in London in 1978; performers included The Clash and Steel Pulse. In 1977, the British Council of Churches assembly agreed to launch its own anti-fascist and anti-racist organisation, resulting in the creation of Christians Against Racism and Fascism in January 1978. Many opposed to the NF were cautious about joining groups with prominent far-left contingents, and as a more moderate alternative to the ANL, in December 1977 the MP Joan Lestor founded the Joint Committee Against Racialism (JCAR), which united Labour, Conservative, and Liberal Party members. JCAR was endorsed by Labour, the Liberal Party, the Executive Council of the National Union of the Conservative Party, the National Union of Students, the Board of Deputies of British Jews, the British Council of Churches, the Supreme Council of the Sikhs, the Federation of Bangladeshi Organisations, the Indian Workers' Association, the West Indian Standing Conference, and the British Youth Council. Taylor noted that by the end of 1977, an \\"unprecedented range of groups from almost every section of British society spreading right across the political spectrum had declared an intention to oppose the NF and the racism upon which it fed\\". In June 1978, the Anti-Racist Anti-Fascist Coordinating Committee (ARAFCC) and the National Co-ordinating Committee held a joint conference to which delegates came from student unions, trades councils, political parties, and groups representing women, ethnic minorities, and the gay community. Although designed to organise a united front against the NF and racism, it failed to do so amid arguments about tactics and approach. Far-left activists demonstrated outside NF meetings and encouraged landlords to bar the NF from using their premises; in some instances, they physically attacked NF members. Many anti-fascists and leftists seeking to obstruct the NF were basing their strategy on a quote attributed to Hitler: \\"Only one thing could have stopped our movement ‚Äì if our adversaries had understood its principle and from the first day smashed with the utmost brutality the nucleus of our new movement.\\" References =Works cited=  * National Front (UK) Anti-fascism in the United Kingdom ","title":"Opposition to the National Front (UK)"},{"id":"60560890","text":"Za√¢ma d'Banlieue was a female-led collective for immigrant youth in the suburbs of Lyon, France which existed between 1979 and 1984.

Activists were reached directly through close social ties between individuals, for instance through friends and family networks. Further, the organized actions and modes of operation were also mainly organized through random operation.

The collective's feminism-related discourse combined criticism on the family with a general critique on the conditions of existence of women at large. Girls‚Äô difficulties within families were viewed to reflect the difficulties of confirming oneself at the level of society. Za√¢ma d‚ÄôBanlieue considered gendered societal and familial issues as one and hereby actively prevented any discourse particularly directed against Muslim male figures within families individually. Female activists emphasized the need to avoid any stigmatization of brothers and fathers in the feminist discourse.Nasri, Foued. 2011. \\"Za√¢ma D'banlieue (1979-1984): Les P√©r√©grinations D'un Collectif F√©minin Au Sein Des Luttes De L‚ÄôImmigration\\".

He was bred in Florida and exported as a two- year-old to Japan where he began his career on dirt and won two races before switching to turf to win the Asahi Hai Futurity Stakes. At the end of the year he was the top-rated juvenile in Japan and took the JRA Award for Best Two- Year-Old Colt. In the following year he was beaten in the Spring Stakes and the Satsuki Sho before reverting to dirt and winning the Leopard Stakes. He raced sporadically over the next two seasons but never won again. Background Asia Express is a chestnut horse standing 1.66 metres high with white socks on his hind leg bred in Florida by Ocala Farm. In March 2013 the colt was consigned to the Ocala Breeders' Sales Company Selected Sale of Two- Year-Olds in Training and was bought for $230,000 by Narvick International. He was exported to Japan where he entered the ownership of Yukio Baba and was sent into training with Takahisa Tezuka. He was sired by Henny Hughes, a sprinter whose biggest wins came in the King's Bishop Stakes and Vosburgh Stakes in 2006. As a breeding stallion he is best known as the sire of Beholder. Asia Express's dam, Running Bobcats showed good racing ability, winning nine of her thirty-one races and $377,494 in prize money. She was descended from River Crossing who was a half-sister to Fall Aspen, the female- line ancestor of Dubai Millennium, Timber Country, Mehthaaf and Elnadim. Asia Express is a very large horse by Thoroughbred standards, weighing between 524 kg and 554 kg during his racing career. Racing career =2013: two-year- old season= Asia Express's trainer Takahisa Tezuka Asia Express began his races with two starts on the dirt track at Tokyo. On his racecourse debut he contested an event for previously unraced juveniles over 1200 metres on 3 November and won by more than four lengths from Autumn Love. Three weeks later he recorded another wide-margin victory as he came home seven lengths clear of Pean and fourteen others in the Oxalis Sho over 1400 metres. For his final run of the season, Asia Express was switched to the turf and moved up sharply in class for the Grade 1 Asahi Hai Futurity Stakes over 1600 metres at Nakayama Racecourse on 15 December. Ridden by the visiting English jockey Ryan Moore he was made the 7.7/1 fourth choice in a sixteen-runner field behind Atom, Pray And Real and Bel Canto (Fantasy Stakes). Asia Express raced in mid-division made a forward move on the final turn and was then switched to the outside to produce a strong run in the straight. He gained the advantage from the fading front-runner Bel Canto 100 metres from the finish and drew away to win by one and a quarter lengths and a neck from Shonan Archive and Win Full Bloom. Moore commented \\"He surprised me, he quickened up so well. He's a special horse, because not many do both dirt and grass. His future should be bright. He feels like he hasn't got to the bottom of it yet, like there's more to come.\\" In the JRA Awards for 2013 Asia Express topped the poll for the JRA Award for Best Two-Year-Old Colt taking 279 of the 280 votes. In the official Japanese rankings for 2013, he was the top-rated juvenile, ahead of the filly Red Reveur. =2014: three-year-old season= On his first run as a three-year-old Asia Express contested the Spring Stakes (a major trial race for the Satsuki Sho) over 1800 metres at Nakayama on 23 March he was made the 1.3/1 favourite but sustained his first defeat as he was beaten into second place by Rosa Gigantea. In the Satsuki Sho over 2000 metres at Nakayama the colt started the 6.5/1 fifth choice in the betting but after disputing the lead 200 metres from the finish he faded to finish sixth behind Isla Bonita, beaten two and a half lengths by the winner. After a two-month break Asia Express returned to the Tokyo dirt track but ran very poorly as he finished unplaced behind Red Alvis when odds-on favourite for the Grade 3 Unicorn Stakes. On 10 August the colt faced Red Alvis again in the Grade 3 Leopard Stakes on the dirt at Niigata Racecourse and started the 2.3/1 favourite in a fifteen-runner field. Ridden by Keita Tosaki he won decisively, coming home three and a half lengths clear of Cry Smile, with Red Alvis in fourth. Asia Express was rated the best Japanese three-year-old on dirt for the 2014 season. =2015 & 2016: later career= Asia Express raced on dirt throughout his later career. On 26 March 2015 the colt began his third campaign in the Listed Nagoya Daishoten in which he started odds-on favourite but was beaten half a length by the six-year-old Meisho Columbo. A month later he was the beaten favourite again as he finished second to Kurino Star O in the Grade 3 Antares Stakes over 1800 metres at Hanshin Racecourse. In his two other races that year he finished fifth to Incantation in the Grade 3 Heian Stakes at Kyoto Racecourse in May and fourth to Danon Liberty in the Listed BSN Sho at Niigata in August. After more than a year off the track, Asia Express returned for a final run at Fukushima Racecourse in November 2016 when he finished unplaced in the Listed Fukushima Minyu Cup.

The congregation was founded in 1966, the same year as the Karasburg Reformed Church, and as of 2015 was the eleventh oldest GKSA congregation in Namibia. Initially, southern South West Africa (SWA) was sparsely populated, and the Mariental and Karasburg districts were nested under a congregation headquartered in Keetmanshoop, the capital of the south. On February 27, 1932, the Rev. H.F.V. Kruger founded the Keetmanshoop district, which was raised to a full-fledged congregation on June 28, 1936 as the Keetmanshoop Reformed Church. On March 25, 1950, the Rev. D.C.S. van der Merwe, then based in Windhoek, was named pastor covering the entire southern area of SWA, and to that end, he began holding services in a primary school classroom in Mariental. At a congregation meeting in Mariental on May 25, 1963, it was decided to begin raising money to build a church. The church council approached the municipality, which granted two large plots of land to build the GKSA church. The building committee included Brothers Pieter van Vuuren (chairman), Boy de Waal, Z.P. Venter, and P.J. Nel, and Sisters H.C. Venter, C. Viljoen, C. Visser, and J. Horn, along with the Rev. Benoni van der Walt, pastor at Keetmanshoop from 1963 to 1969. Sales, collection plate drives, and even sheep farming revenues raised the needed construction fund. The building committee decided on a slightly altered version of the Karasburg church building plan. J. Notzen won the construction contract with a bid of R8,500. The church wound up costing R13,000, with pews for 120, two communion tables, and 20 chairs included. Expenses were already paid by completion. Jasper Visser built the pulpit as well as the wooden doors later damaged by burglars. A member made the original candelabra above the pulpit from a Cobra Boot Polish can tied to the roof with a dog chain. It was later replaced after newer members complained. On the keystone, the coat of arms of the GKSA is engraved along with the words of Psalm 24:10: \\"Who is he, this King of glory? The Lord Almighty‚Äîhe is the King of glory.\\" In a box behind the keystone are documents identifying the building committee and church council members, the contractor, and the nature of the fundraising. The dedication finally occurred on Saturday, November 28, 1964. Early in the 21st century, the building's west facade changed somewhat. The nursery was converted into an office and hall, and a rectory was built for the pastor alongside the church as well.

Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 590 U.S. _ (2020), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case which ruled that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects transgender people from employment discrimination. Aimee Stephens was a funeral home employee who had presented herself as male up until 2013. On July 31, 2013, she wrote to her employer, the Harris Funeral Homes group, so that they could be prepared for her decision to undergo gender reassignment surgery, telling them that after a vacation, she planned to return dressed in female attire that otherwise followed the employee handbook. She was fired shortly after the letter was sent, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission helped to represent Stephens in court. The District Court ruled for the funeral homes, stating Title VII did not cover transgender people and that as a religious organization under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the company had a right to dismiss Stephens for non-conformity. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decision, concluded Title VII did include protection for transgender people, which Harris Funeral Homes petitioned the Supreme Court to review. About a month before the Supreme Court decision, Stephens died from health complications. Representation of her case continued through her estate. The case was heard on October 8, 2019, alongside two other cases, Bostock v. Clayton County and Altitude Express, Inc. v. Zarda which dealt with Title VII protection related to sexual orientation. The Court ruled in a 6‚Äì3 decision under Bostock but covering all three cases on June 15, 2020, that Title VII protection extends to gay and transgender people.Supreme Court Ruling 2020-06-15 (pages 1 ‚Äì 33 in the linked document)  Case background  Stephens at the Supreme Court on October 8, 2019 In the United States, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was a landmark piece of legislation to prevent discrimination across race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Among its titles include Title VII, relating to equal employment opportunities and employment discrimination, with the same classes protected against discrimination in employment as well. However, at issue has remained how the Act covers the areas of gender identity as well as sexual orientation as they are not mentioned explicitly. This has led to disjointed coverage of LGBT and gender identity rights with some states issuing specific anti-discrimination for these groups. At the federal level, the House of Representatives have passed a 2019 amendment to the Act, the Equality Act, to explicitly grant these classes protection from discrimination under the Civil Rights Act, but such legislation has yet to be ratified by the Senate as of May 2020. Stephens considered herself a transgender woman for most of her adult life but presented herself as a male, which reportedly caused her constant emotional stress. In 2013, she decided to come out to family and friends, and arranged to undergo reassignment surgery within the next year, expressing herself as a woman prior to transition as part of real-life experience. At that time, she had been an employee of R.G. &. G.R. Harris Funeral Homes for six years, and had an excellent work record. She wrote her supervisor regarding this matter prior to taking a vacation from work, and as to help with the transition, she would return to work in attire appropriate for female employees as outlined in their employee handbook. Two weeks later, Stephens was notified by mail that she had been terminated by the funeral home's owner Thomas Rost. They attempted to mediate an amicable departure, with Rost offering Stephens a severance package, but she refused to take it. Stephens filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), believing she had been discriminated against due to being transgender. EEOC agreed and took the case against the funeral home to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. There in 2016, the district court found for the funeral home on two bases: first, that in Title VII neither transgender persons nor gender identity were protected classes, and second, that because Rost was a devout Christian who does not accept that one can change one's gender, and ran the homes under his religion, that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act gave him the ability to fire Stephens if she would not conform. The EEOC appealed to the Sixth Circuit. In March 2018, the Sixth Circuit reversed the decision, ruling that Title VII's \\"discrimination by sex\\" does include transgender persons. The court also considered that the funeral home had failed to show how the Civil Rights Act burdened Rost from expressing his religious freedom. Part of the Sixth's decision rested on the 1989 case Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins which states that employers cannot discriminate against employees for failure to conform to the stereotypical behavior of a man or woman. The case revolves around protections relating to public and private employees from being discriminated upon because of sex and whether this applies to gender identity for transgender persons. In May 2020, before the Supreme Court had issued a decision, Stephens entered hospice care, as her long-term kidney disease had become untreatable. She died on May 12, 2020 at age 59. Stephens's ACLU lawyers said that the case would be carried on by her estate.  Supreme Court  The funeral home, represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom, filed a petition in the U.S. Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari, asking the Court to hear the case. There has been a circuit split on the issue of whether Title VII protects employees from employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. The Second Circuit in Zarda v. Altitude Express, Inc. and the Seventh Circuit in Hively v. Ivy Tech Community College found that the Title VII protects employees from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation; the Eleventh Circuit in Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia came to the opposite conclusion. The U.S. Department of Justice filed a brief with the Supreme Court in October 2018 arguing that the Sixth Circuit had decided wrongly and that Harris Funeral Homes had a right to fire an employee for being transgender. The Court granted the cert petition (agreeing to hear the appeal) for Harris Funeral Homes in April 2019, alongside a pair of cases consolidated under Bostock which raised the same question related to Title VII discrimination against sexual orientation. Harris and these cases were heard on October 8, 2019. In oral arguments, the Court's conservative justices argued that because Congress had not included gender identity at the time of the Civil Rights Act and had not updated the law to include it, the Court should not create new law beyond Congress's intentions. Arguments also centered on how the word \\"sex\\" in Title VII could be interpreted to include transgender individuals. = Decision = References External links * Discrimination against transgender people United States Supreme Court cases United States transgender rights case law United States employment discrimination case law ","title":"R.G. &amp; G.R.

There was regional variation in the levels of support that the NF received during the 1970s, reflected both in the share of the vote (1%) it gained and the size and number of its branches Its strength was centred heavily in England; its support was far weaker in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. In England, its support clustered along the South Coast and in the cities of London and Birmingham. This distribution had \\"strong parallels\\" with the earlier support of the BUF. Finances The National Front was not open about its finances, but often stressed that it was short of funds and required more money to finance its operations. It is likely that in its heyday, it had just enough money to pay for its two full-time officials, three head office secretaries, and party expenses. Walker noted that in 1974, the NF raised at least ¬£50,000. That same year, it went into debt to finance its electoral campaigns. Its central funds came from several main sources: membership dues, the sale of its publications, donations, and lotteries. During the 1970s, branches were given financial targets they were expected to attain through selling Spearhead and the NF's newssheet Britain First. Branches also held jumble sales, totes, and social events as a means of raising funds. Branches were not held responsible for providing funds for the party's headquarters, but were expected to finance their own candidates in election campaigns. The party also succeeded in raising additional funds during its rallies and meetings, where donations were specifically requested from the attendees. It had several wealthy supporters who provided donations of up to ¬£20,000, including sympathisers in apartheid-era South Africa, and in France. It also received funds from individuals in the Arab world to finance the publication of material espousing anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and Holocaust denial. Membership =Numbers= The NF faced a high turnover in its membership. In 1977, Walker described the party's membership as being \\"like a bath with both taps running and the plughole empty. Members pour in and pour out.\\" Fielding echoed this, stating that the NF's \\"stable membership\\" was lower than the number of people who have \\"passed through\\" it; Taylor suggested that during the 1970s, \\"at least 12,000\\" people joined and then left the party. The Front refused to officially disclose the number of members that it had. Thurlow suggested that \\"the most reliable estimates\\" were those produced by the anti-fascist investigatory magazine Searchlight. Following its establishment, the NF claimed to have 4,000 members in 1968, and in February 1974 a branch chairman claimed that it had 20,000 members. Fielding suggested that it probably had about 21,000 members in early 1975, of whom 6,000 to 8,000 were \\"paper members\\" who had not renewed their membership subscriptions but not officially terminated their membership. Searchlight claimed that from its origins with 4,000 members in 1968, the party reached a peak membership of 17,500 in 1972, which had declined to 10,000 in 1979, to 3,148 in 1984, and to 1,000 in January 1985. An estimate of party membership in 1989 put adherents of the Flag Group at about 3,000 and of the Strasserite faction at about 600. Thurlow noted that even at its peak in the 1970s, the Front's membership was still only half that of the BUF during its 1930s heyday. =Profile= No adequate sociological sampling of NF members took place, but interviews with members were carried out during the 1970s by Taylor, Fielding, and Billig. Max Hanna noted that as of 1973, most NF members were \\"from the skilled working class and lower-middle class\\" but that there was variation according to branch. Fielding observed that most party members during the late 1970s were working-class, but that the party's South Coast branches had a higher concentration of lower middle-class members. He observed that party activism was generally carried out by upper working and lower middle-class members rather than by their lower working-class and upper middle-class counterparts. Fielding noted that the party contained individuals of all age ranges, although added that certain branches had a concentration of retirees. He observed a greater number of men in their thirties or fifties rather than their forties, suggesting that the latter were typically too preoccupied with raising families to involve themselves heavily in NF matters. Hanna also described \\"men in their thirties\\" as the party's main cohort. The male numerical dominance was in common with most UK political parties in the period, although the Front differed from these other parties in cultivating an image of \\"overwhelming masculinity\\" and \\"virulent machismo\\". NF members were sociologically regarded as political deviants, and thus parts of the cultic milieu. Fielding's interviews with NF members in the 1970s led him to conclude that \\"there is something exceptional about the NF member, and particularly about the activist\\", for they differed from other members of society in their willingness to join a politically extreme group. Fielding found that NF members were concerned about their image and sensitive to ideas that they were \\"fascistic\\" or \\"cranky\\", instead thinking of themselves as \\"patriots\\" or \\"nationalists\\". He found them more accepting of the term \\"racist\\", with some referring to themselves as such. He noted that race was the main issue that led members to joining the Front, and that they generally perceived their racial ideas to be \\"common sense\\". He added that members made \\"harsh expressions of prejudice\\" against non-white Britons, citing one woman member who called on her branch to \\"get out there and smash that bleedin' wog filth\\", a group she juxtaposed with \\"respectable people like us\\". A variant of the National Front flag Fielding found that \\"ordinary members feel uneasy about Britain's present political life but cannot express why this is\\". A common perception among members was that life had changed for the worse in Britain and they often used the expression: \\"the country is going to the dogs\\". As evidence, they cited what they believed were declining standards of living, the erosion of British identity, and the collapse of the British Empire. Members typically looked with pride on the UK's past military and colonial exploits, and wanted the country to return to a preeminent position on the world stage. There was a widespread perception among NF members that Britain's political leaders were corrupt and cruel, and a tendency toward believing and espousing conspiracy theories. Fielding believed that some of the membership were \\"motivated by a search for community and reassurance in a world they find difficult to understand\\". For some, joining the NF was a psychological act of defiance against society, while many had joined because their friends and relatives had done so. Fielding suggested that the NF's moral indignation regarding perceived slackers and anti-social elements had particular appeal for upper working and lower middle-class Britons because these were the sectors of society which felt that they worked hardest for the least reward. The large number of individuals who joined and soon left the party might in part be due to the fact that many had joined on the basis of its populist appeals against immigration, only to express shock or dismay upon discovering its underlying fascist ideology. In other cases, individuals may have left because they felt that the hardship they encountered‚Äîostracisation by friends and colleagues, job losses, verbal abuses, and on rare occasion physical assault‚Äîbecame too much to endure, particularly as the party's fortunes declined in the latter 1970s. During the 1970s, the NF consistently attempted to attract youth, having formed specific sub-groups to focus on this campaign. Many of the youth attracted to the group may have done so as a form of youthful rebellion, enjoying the \\"shock value\\" that party membership offered; in this they had similarities with the contemporary punk movement of the late 1970s. Ryan Shaffer stated that the party's shift away from traditional campaigning during the 1980s and its growing affiliation with neo-Nazi youth groups resulted in its appeal becoming restricted to \\"mostly young people\\". Voter base During its 1970s heyday, one of the strongest areas of National Front support was Bethnal Green (pictured), part of London's East End. The NF's electoral support was overwhelmingly urban and English, with little support in rural parts of England or in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. According to Walker, the 1974 election results suggested that at the time the NF's electoral heartlands were in London's East End and in Inner London's north-east suburbs. He noted that it typically gained much support from \\"respectable working-class\\" areas, where many traditional Labour voters who felt let down by Labour governments were attracted by its racial appeals. In 1978, the psephologist Michael Steed argued that comparing the voting data of the NF to older far-right parties suggested that \\"there has been a very constant level of potential N.F. support for at least ten and perhaps twenty years, simply awaiting an opportunity to express itself.\\" Examining the party's East End support in greater depth, the sociologist Christopher T. Husbands argued that NF support was not evenly distributed across the region, but was constrained to a \\"relatively restricted area\\", the two or three square miles containing Bethnal Green, Shoreditch, Hoxton, and Haggerston. He noted that even in urban strongholds such as these, \\"only a minority even of their white residents were sympathetic\\" to the NF. A 1978 survey in the East End by New Society found that while most white residents thought the immigration rate too high, many related positive encounters and friendships with Afro-Caribbean and Asian migrants and opposed the NF. A number mocked the Front‚Äîone called them \\"a load of ponces\\" who did not want to work, another satirised \\"all the blokes in their Action Man gear\\"‚Äîalthough were cautious about doing so publicly, fearing violent retaliation. A 1977 survey conducted by Essex University found that 8% of those polled were likely to vote for the Front, and that the party had \\"strong support amongst the working class, the young and the poorly educated\\". This survey found that support for the party was strongest in the East Midlands (10%), followed by London (8%), East Anglia (7%), the West Midlands (6%), and then Yorkshire and Humberside (6%). A report published in 1980 instead found that Greater London and the West Midlands were the NF's greatest areas of support, together making up 48% of its national vote share. However, this study similarly found a strong link to class, with 72% of NF supporters being working class; it noted that support was \\"somewhat stronger among the skilled working class than among the semi- and unskilled workers.\\" This study also found that 71% of the NF's support came from men. This close link with majority male support was also evident in other far-right movements of the period, such as the George Wallace Movement in the United States, and echoed the disproportionate number of men who worked for the party. The 1980 study also examined views of the NF among the broader British electorate. This found that 6% would \\"seriously consider\\" voting for the NF, while 1% would \\"strongly agree\\" with the idea of voting for it. Two thirds of respondents believed that the NF stirred up racial tensions to advance its own cause, 64% believed that there was a Nazi element to the party, and 56% believed that the NF wanted Britain to become a dictatorship. However, Taylor suggested that many of those who voted for the NF did so not because they wanted to see the UK become a fascist state but because they were attracted by its anti-immigrant appeals. During the 1970s, both Tyndall and NF members reiterated the belief that \\"all decent people\\" agreed with their policies; they thus sought to eschew the idea that the NF was extraordinary or extreme in its views. =Explanations= Various explanations for the NF's 1970s electoral growth held that it was impacted by the levels of non-white immigration into an area. In 1976, Webster claimed that his party did best \\"when an immigrant problem is in sight nearby\\", in white-dominated areas close to migrant communities. One argument was that areas with large non-white immigrant communities were most susceptible to NF support; according to this view, the higher the non-white population, the higher the resentment among local whites and the greater the support for the NF. An alternate explanation is that the NF did particularly well in areas where the non-white population was moderately sized rather than large; according to this, local whites turned to the NF because they were fearful that the area's non-white population would grow larger, particularly if neighbouring areas already had large non-white populations. On examining voting data from the 1977 Greater London Council election, the political scientist Paul Whiteley argued that the NF picked up on the votes of alienated working-class individuals by \\"providing simple answers to complex problems\\". He argued that the NF's vote share was best explained by the \\"working-class authoritarianism\\" phenomenon examined in the United States by S. M. Lipset. Christopher Husbands instead believed that \\"local working-class cultures\\" were \\"the crucial factor for understanding some pro-NF susceptibility\\". He cited earlier studies indicating that \\"territorial sensitivity\\" was an element of English working-class culture, with this \\"localism\\" manifesting as corollaries of \\"parochialism and a sensitivity to supposed threat\\". He argued that this led many working-class English people to create personal identities based on their neighbourhood rather than their profession, leaving many more susceptible to far-right appeals based on location rather than leftist ones based on workplace solidarity. He argued that there were parallels with the Netherlands, where urban working-class communities had also expressed support for the far-right, although not in France, Germany, or Italy, where the urban proletariat had not offered substantial support for far-right parties.

He played a decisive role in the royal campaign against the Byzantine Empire in 1071. Biography Jan (also Ian or John) elevated into the position of isp√°n of Sopron County by 1071, during the reign of Solomon, King of Hungary. His dignity is the earliest evidence of the existence of the county since at least the second half of the 11th century. Pecheneg troops pillaged Syrmia (now in Serbia) in 1071. As King Solomon and his cousin, Duke G√©za suspected that the soldiers of the Byzantine garrison at Belgrade () incited the marauders against Hungary, they decided to attack the fortress. The Hungarian army crossed the river Sava and laid siege to Belgrade. Upon the request of the Byzantine commander, Niketas, the Pechenegs sent a relief army, but they were defeated and annihilated by Jan and his troops from Sopron County on their route to Belgrade. Thereafter, the Hungarians took Belgrade after a siege of three months. Following the campaign, Solomon and G√©za have gifted and rewarded Jan generously. Historian P√©ter Kov√°cs considers the author of the 14th-century Illuminated Chronicle used biblical, antique and medieval literary tropes of the metaphor \\"tamquam lapis limpidissimus vasa fictilia contrivisset\\", when described Jan's heroism. Earlier assumptions (for instance, literary historian J√°nos Horv√°th, Jr.) sought that metaphor in the folk tradition.

Her work has been featured in exhibitions since 1979. Early life and education Judith Schwarz was born 1944 in Vancouver, British Columbia and is based in Toronto, Ontario. She earned a Bachelor‚Äôs degree from the University of British Columbia (1966), attended the Vancouver School of Art (1973‚Äì1976), and received a Master of Fine Arts degree from York University (1978).  Career  Schwarz is an Associate Professor at York University in Toronto, where she teaches sculpture and drawing at both graduate and undergraduate levels. In 1978 she began her career at York University and in 1995 she received a full- time appointment to the Faculty of Fine Arts. Schwarz is known for her outdoor abstract sculptures, integrating art with the environment. Schwarz's earliest sculptural exhibit, entitled Parallel Language (1987), was a three-part work juxtaposing a circular die-cut steel sheet wall mounted, angling out from it onto the floor‚Äîa steel beam, and a leaf shaped steel stencil next to a beautiful slab of oak. In a review written by Linda Genereux in Artforum, Genereux states \\"The strength of Judith Schwarz's work depends upon her dexterous handling of material and a growing vocabulary of forms...\\" Her work can be found in many public collections across Canada and in the US, including the Canada Council Art Bank, the National Gallery of Canada, the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, Royal Bank of Canada, the University of Oregon and the York University. The National Gallery purchased two of her drawings in 1983: Low Light Drawing, Series A, #10 (1981) and Head Stand (1982); and then in 1987 purchased a set of four videotapes: I am an artist, My name is‚Ä¶, a collaboration between Schwarz and Elizabeth MacKenzie. Schwarz has created public commissions in both Vancouver and Toronto, Canada. Among her commissions in Toronto are the Nautilus Gateway (1992), a stainless steel and bronze sculpture in Waterpark Place, Bay Street and Queen's Quay and Spiral Fountain (1990), a bronze fountain for the Hotel Deck at Skydome. Schwarz's sculpture Pacific Spiral (2003) was among 350 outdoor artworks celebrated in Vancouver during the 2014 Culture Days Celebration, as part of a national Culture Days campaign designed to promote artistic activities across Canada. :In Francois-Marc Gagnon's description of Schwarz's sculptures in The Canadian Encyclopedia, Gagnon states ...\\"the elegant, flame-cut steel cosmological configurations of Judith Schwarz invent rather than transform cultural signs and devices whose mysteries are embedded as much in the juxtaposition of the materials, glass, steel, and wood as in their form.\\" In 1990 at the 75th Anniversary of the Emily Awards, Schwarz was presented with an Emily Award. She was among the 75 distinguished alumni of Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design that were recognized for their outstanding career achievements. The University of Waterloo Art Gallery circulated a 10-year retrospective of Schwarz's work, titled Dissembling Structures, curated by James D. Campbell. This exhibition was presented at the University of Waterloo Art Gallery, Waterloo (1998), the Concordia University's Leonard & Bina Ellen Art Gallery, Toronto (1998), and the Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design's Charles S.

Gabriel Bengtsson Oxenstierna af Korsholm och Wasa, 1st Count of Korsholma and Vaasa, Finnish: Gabriel Pentinpoika Oxenstierna, (18 March 1586 at Lindholmen Castle, V√§sterg√∂tland ‚Äì 12 December 1656 at Edsberg Manor, Sollentuna) was a Swedish statesman, jurist and diplomat.  Biography  Oxenstierna was the son of Bengt Gabrielsson Oxenstierna the Elder, councillor to Duke Charles of S√∂dermanland, N√§rke and V√§rmland (later King Charles IX), and his first wife Sigrid Gustafsdotter (Tre Rosor). He was orphaned at an early age. Like other contemporary members of the influential Oxenstierna family, he was educated abroad and entered the service of King Charles IX upon his return in 1606. He retained royal favour during the rule of King Gustavus Adolphus and was made Governor-General of Reval and Swedish Estonia in 1611, subsequently being appointed Privy Councillor and Master of the Ordnance in 1617. Alongside his more famous cousins, Lord Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna and Gabriel Gustafsson Oxenstierna, he was made responsible for arming the Swedish army during the Polish‚ÄìSwedish War and was part of the governing council in the King's absence. He was made Hovr√§ttsr√•d and Lawspeaker of V√§rmland in 1627 and was part of the Swedish diplomatic delegation to the Holy Roman Emperor during the 1630 peace negotiations in Danzig. In 1631, he was appointed Governor-General of Finland, continuing the work of his predecessor Nils Turesson Bielke to improve the central administration and legal system. He returned to Stockholm after the death of King Gustavus Adolphus to become part of the regency council for Queen Christina in 1633, becoming Lord High Treasurer of Sweden in 1634. However, the Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna and Steward Gabriel Gustafsson Oxenstierna thought him less suited for the post, as he was inexperienced on state economics and unable to stop the embezzlement of state funds during the regency. In 1645, the Oxenstierna administration was removed by Queen Christina upon reaching maturity. The Queen appointed Oxenstierna Governor- General of Swedish Livonia in 1645, a post which he resigned from in 1647. He was created 1st Count of Korsholma and Vaasa by the Queen in 1651, one of the largest fiefdoms in Sweden, and was appointed supreme naval administrator as Lord High Admiral of Sweden in 1652, without previous naval experience. He improved the finances of his county, but received numerous complaints from the peasantry of Ostrobothnia due to tax increases and labour requirements. Oxenstierna died in 1656 at Edsberg Manor in present-day Sollentuna and was buried in Fasterna Church.  Family  Oxenstierna married Anna Gustafsdotter Ban√©r (1585‚Äì1656) in Stockholm on 7 October 1610. He fathered eleven children, among them Gabriel, Bengt and Gustaf Gabrielsson Oxenstierna. He was older half-brother to Bengt Bengtsson Oxenstierna and cousin to Axel and Gabriel Gustafsson Oxenstierna. Oxenstierna founded the comital af Korsholm and Wasa branch of the Oxenstierna family, the only male-line branch still in existence today.  References  * Nordisk familjebok, Oxenstierna, 13.

While X. yus closely resembles other cheloniellids, such as Triopus or Duslia, X. yus can be easily distinguished from its relatives by the presence of a pair of raptorial limbs that extend from underneath the head region, or cephalon. Etymology The generic name is derived from \\"X,\\" meaning \\"hunter\\" in Latin, and \\"US,\\" meaning \\"extraordinary,\\" thus referring to the animal's large raptorial appendages that were most probably used for seizing prey. The specific name, yus, is a kind of three-pronged spear, in reference to the triple-pointed postabdomen. Geological setting The fossils of X. yus are found in the Telychian-aged Brandon Bridge Formation in Southeastern Wisconsin, near Waukesha. The nature of the local (bio)sedimentation suggests that the area was an offshore, shallow-water environment, and that the fossils found in this site were brought there from nearby areas via water currents. The various corpses were then left undisturbed long enough for algae and sediments to cover them before they decayed or were disturbed by scavengers or burrowing organisms.

Leadership and branches In its 1970s heyday, the National Front was headed by its directorate, a body of seven to twenty party members. With strict control over local and regional organisations, the directorate determined party policy, controlled its structures and finances, oversaw admissions and expulsions, and determined tactics. A third of the directorate were required to stand down every year, with a postal ballot of the membership to determine their replacements. Between 1971 and 1975, the directorate elected two of its members to be the most senior figures in the party, the chairman and deputy chairman. However, at the 1977 annual general meeting it agreed‚Äîat Tyndall's instigation‚Äîthat the chairman would instead be elected through a postal ballot of the membership. As the directorate met in London infrequently, in practice the running of the party was left to the chairman and deputy chairman. The formal organisation resulted in the party's elite having most of the power, with the membership exerting little control over policy or the actions of party leaders. Fielding suggested that this centralisation of power would have presaged the framework of any NF government had they obtained power. As with most other UK political parties, in the 1970s the NF's elite was overwhelmingly male, middle-class, and relatively young. The party's constitution did not acknowledge the existence of factions, although the Front had a long history of factional rivalry within its ranks, with Wilkinson noting that it had been plagued by \\"personal squabbles and splits\\" among its hierarchy. One variant of the National Front flag The NF's local presence was divided into \\"groups\\", which had under twelve members, and \\"branches\\", which had over twelve. The NF was not eager to publicise how many branches were active. Fielding stated that in July 1973 the party had 32 branches and 80 groups, while Walker claimed that in January 1974, it had 30 branches and 54 groups. The majority were in south-east England, with 11 branches and 8 groups in Greater London and 5 branches and 22 groups elsewhere in the south-east. It had five branches and 3 groups in the midlands, 7 branches and 11 groups in the north, 1 branch and 7 groups in western Britain, and one group each in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Each branch or group had its own five-person committee, with annual elections for the committee positions. NF branch meetings were much like those of other British political parties, preoccupied largely with practical issues like raising finances. Typically, branch meetings took place in a pub. Some NF branches also established supporters' associations for individuals who backed the NF but were not willing to become members out of fear of potential repercussions. In April 1974, the party introduced regional councils to co-ordinate between the national party and its local groups and branches. These regional councils were required to contain two members from each branch in the region. Supporter organisations were established among white communities of British descent elsewhere in the world; in New Zealand in 1977 and in Australia, Canada, and South Africa in 1978. After the Strasserite faction secured control in 1986, it formally adopted a cadre system of leadership. This made the party more elitist, creating what the Strasserites called \\"a revolutionary cadre party ‚Äì a movement run by its most dedicated and active members rather than by armchair nationalists\\". This was linked to the idea‚Äîpromoted through a book by Holland‚Äîthat each NF member should be a \\"political soldier\\", a \\"New Type of Man\\" who rejected the \\"materialist nightmare\\" of contemporary capitalist society and underwent a personal \\"Spiritual Revolution\\" through which they dedicated themselves fully to the nation. Security and violence The Front was preoccupied with security, refusing to reveal information about its leader's standard working hours or the number of staff at its headquarters. During the 1970s, it created a card-index and photo file of its opponents' names and addresses. To guard its marches from anti-fascists, the NF formed \\"defence groups\\" largely made up of young men‚Äîby 1974 called the \\"Honour Guard\\"‚Äîwhose members often carried makeshift weapons like iron bars and bicycle chains. These marches often took place in areas that had experienced high levels of immigration; in doing so the NF sought to instil fear in immigrant communities, whip up racial tensions, and generate publicity by clashing with counter-protesters, all of which it could exploit politically. These tactics have continued into more recent times; in August 2017, around thirty NF supporters marched in Grantham, Lincolnshire, where they clashed with members of the Midland Anti-Fascist Network. In some instances, local authorities banned its marches; in 2012, Aberdeen City Council rejected the NF's request to hold a procession down Aberdeen's Union Street on Hitler's birthday. Plaque memorialising the \\"Battle of Lewisham\\" in which anti-fascist protesters combatted a National Front march in 1977 The Front claimed that its members only resorted to violence in self- defence. On observing the group during the 1970s however, Fielding noted that \\"the NF uses force aggressively\\", and was \\"not above exacting revenge\\" on its critics. Fielding believed the most notable violent clash involving the NF was the Red Lion Square disorders in June 1974. An NF meeting at central London's Conway Hall resulted in clashes between the NF, anti-fascists, and police stationed to keep the peace; 54 demonstrators were arrested, many were injured, and one anti-fascist, Kevin Gateley, was killed. Gateley's was the first death at a British demonstration since 1919. Another prominent clash took place in Lewisham, south-east London in August 1977. The NF marchers were met by a group called the All Lewisham Campaign against Racism and Fascism (ALCARAF), although Trotskyist groups regarded ALCARAF's peaceful response as ineffective and attacked the NF marchers, resulting in the \\"Battle of Lewisham\\". In April 1979, an anti-NF demonstration in Southall clashed with police seeking to keep the NF and anti-fascists apart; the violence resulted in the death of Blair Peach. The NF also disrupted the meetings of anti- fascist groups and mainstream politicians. In November 1975, NF activists attacked a National Council of Civil Liberties meeting at the University of Manchester, with eight people requiring hospitalisation. In another instance, 80 NF activists stormed a meeting held by the Liberal Party to discuss the Rhodesian Bush War and the transition to black-majority rule in Rhodesia. NF members threw flour bombs and chairs at the delegates while chanting \\"White Power\\". Another event disrupted by the NF was a town hall meeting in Newham, where members pelted the Home Secretary Roy Jenkins with flour bombs and manure. There have also been actions carried out by right-wing extremists where covert NF involvement was suspected but not proven. This can result from NF members engaging in \\"freelance\\" activism not authorised by the party hierarchy. For instance, in February 1974, several men put up NF posters in Brighton, assaulted passers by whom they accused of being Jewish, and attacked staff at the Communist Party of Britain (Marxist-Leninist) bookshop. The local NF branch denied knowledge of the incident or the individuals in question. In June 1978, the Anti-Nazi League headquarters was hit by an arson attack; the slogan \\"NF Rules OK\\" was graffitied on the building. Again, the NF denied responsibility. The party's leadership showed little concern with the violent activities of such members and supporters, and openly praised some of its members convicted of violent criminal activity. Sub-groups and propaganda output The NF promoted its cause through various sub-groups and organisations. Tyndall believed the NF should take control of the trade union movement and suppress the leftists within it. In June 1974, it launched the NF Trade Unionists Association, and also issued a sporadic and short-lived magazine aimed at trade unionists, The British Worker. During the 1970s it encouraged members to infiltrate other groups, such as the Hunt Saboteurs Association and ratepayers' and residents' associations, to promote the NF within them. In 1978, the party's directorate established a legal department to deal with the growing number of members being charged with inciting racial hatred under the 1976 Race Relations Act. In 1973, the political scientist Max Hanna noted that the party was planning on rearing its own academics. That decade, it formed a Student Association, and issued the student magazine Spark. The NF Student Association initially tried recruiting students on university campuses, but on having little success it refocused attention towards recruitment in schools and sixth forms. In 1978 it launched the Young National Front (YNF), membership was restricted to 14 to 25 years olds; it was through this group that Griffin and Pearce, later influential party figures, joined. The YNF issued a newsletter, Bulldog, which was edited by Pearce, and held \\"training seminars\\" for schoolchildren. The YNF distributed leaflets and copies of Bulldog at football matches and concerts that it believed would attract large numbers of white working-class people, and organised its own football competition between YNF teams from different cities. The YNF also encouraged young women to join the party and used sexualised imagery of its female members to attract young male recruits. Bulldog for instance carried an advert urging female supporters to become \\"a Bulldog bird\\" by sending in photographs of themselves, \\"the sexier the better\\", for publication in the magazine. The NF observed how the left mobilised anti-fascist support through musical ventures like Rock Against Racism, and decided to employ similar techniques. In 1979, Pearce‚Äîthen the YNF leader‚Äîestablished Rock Against Communism (RAC), through which the NF held concerts featuring neo-Nazi skinhead bands. The first RAC event was held in Conway Hall in August 1979, and featured performances by The Dentists, Homicide, and White Boss. Tyndall and other senior NF members liked the opportunity for expanding party membership that RAC offered them, but were concerned that associations with the skinhead subculture would damage the NF's image. After Tyndall left the party, in 1982 RAC was revived with Skrewdriver as its flagship band; they had been having difficulty finding venues willing to host them due to the violence that often accompanied its performances. In 1983 the NF launched a record label, White Noise Records, which became a new means of disseminating NF ideas and an important source of revenue for several years. The RAC had difficulty finding venues willing to stage its concerts, although in 1984 it got around this by staging its first large open-air concert at the rural home of Nick Griffin's parents in Suffolk. The assembled crowd responded to Skrewdriver's performance with Nazi salutes and calls of \\"sieg heil\\" while the band's Ian Stuart responded with \\"Fucking right Seig Heil, fucking nigger bashing\\". To further promote this music scene, senior NF members also established the White Noise Club which distributed the White Noise magazine internationally. Later in the 1980s, Skrewdriver broke from the NF and the White Noise Club to establish its own far-right music promotion network, Blood & Honour.

The original WJAZ was first licensed in the summer of 1922, and the next year began broadcasting from the Edgewater Beach Hotel in Chicago. However, it was soon determined that a suburban transmitter location would be preferable, and Zenith began preparations to re-establish WJAZ's operations at a more suitable site. Following operation for a few weeks by the Chicago Tribune as WGN, the station license for the original WJAZ was sold to the hotel management, and the call letters changed to WEBH. In order to maintain control of the well- known WJAZ call sign until the new facility was ready, in 1924 Zenith briefly renamed a second Chicago station, WSAX, to WJAZ. Later that year, Zenith prepared a portable broadcasting station, mounted on a truck body, in order to evaluate potential new transmitter locations, and this mobile unit inherited the WJAZ call letters. Roving test broadcasts were made from various sites surrounding Chicago, and Mount Pleasant, Illinois was ultimately selected for the new transmitter location. In 1925, the replacement facility was completed, and the WJAZ call sign was transferred from the portable unit to the new station. The next year WJAZ gained national notoriety, when Zenith made an unauthorized change in its transmitting frequency, directly challenging the Department of Commerce's authority under the Radio Act of 1912 to assign frequencies. The courts sided with WJAZ; as a result the Radio Act of 1927 was enacted, which strengthened the government's regulatory powers and established the Federal Radio Commission. WJAZ was deleted in 1931, after a co-channel station in Kentucky successfully petitioned for full-time use of the shared frequency. History =Initial authorization (1922-1924)= Audiences at the Edgewater Beach Hotel could watch WJAZ studio performances through sound- proofed plate-glass windows (1923)\\"The March of Radio\\" (WJAZ studio photograph), Radio Broadcast, July 1923, page 277. WJAZ was first licensed on August 17, 1922\\"Thirteen Stations Licensed\\" (during the week of August 12‚Äì19, 1922), New York Evening World, August 23, 1922, page 15. to the Chicago Radio Laboratory (reorganized in 1924 as the Zenith Radio Corporation), for operation on the standard \\"entertainment\\" wavelength of 360 meters (833 kHz).\\"New Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, September 1, 1922, page 3. Its call letters were randomly assigned from a sequential alphabetical list maintained by the Department of Commerce. WJAZ initially had a very limited broadcasting schedule. It gained prominence when it began broadcasting from a newly constructed studio located on the ground floor of the Edgewater Beach Hotel on May 12, 1923.\\"Radio News\\", Forest Park (Illinois) Review, May 12, 1923, page 2. For publicity, the general public was invited to watch performances through soundproof three-ply plate glass windows.\\"World's Most Powerful Broadcasting Station\\", Popular Science Monthly, September 1923, page 62.\\"In the Crystal Studio at WJAZ\\", Radio Broadcast, October 1923, page 456. The transmitter and antenna were located adjacent to the hotel building. The station provided general entertainment programming, and was primarily used to promote the sale of Zenith-brand radio receivers. One unusual feature was a series of midnight transmissions, operating under the experimental call sign \\"9XN\\", as one of the stations communicating with Dr. Donald B. MacMillan's Arctic expedition aboard the schooner Bowdoin, which became icebound and isolated 11 degrees below the North Pole.\\"Peeps into Broadcast Stations: Chicago Enters Northern Solitude\\", The Wireless Age, February 1924, page 42.\\"With MacMillan and Radio, North of Civilization\\", Radio Broadcast, October 1923, pages 500-507. Effective May 15, 1923, government regulators allocated a band of \\"Class B\\" frequencies, reserved for stations that had quality programming and more powerful transmitters. 670 kHz was allocated for use in the Chicago area,\\"Allocation of New Wave Lengths for Class B Stations\\", Radio World, April 28, 1923, page 6. and both WJAZ and WMAQ (now WSCR) were assigned to this frequency on a timesharing basis.\\"Alterations and Corrections\\", Radio Service Bulletin, June 1, 1923, page 11. Zenith soon found that operating a high-powered station within Chicago city limits caused extensive \\"blanketing\\" interference to nearby receivers, and decided to relocate WJAZ to a suburban transmitter site. A short-term agreement was made with the Chicago Tribune to take over the existing station's programming, which went into effect on March 29, 1924, and at the same time the station's call letters were changed to WGN and the transmitting frequency to 810 kHz.WGN: A Pictorial History, WGN, Inc., 1961, pages 9-16.\\"Alterations and Corrections\\", Radio Service Bulletin, April 1, 1924, page 9. The Tribune agreement only lasted a few weeks, and the station was then sold to the Edgewater Beach Hotel management, which changed the call letters to WEBH.\\"Alterations and Corrections\\", Radio Service Bulletin, June 2, 1924, page 7. (WEBH was eventually deleted in November 1928 when it was consolidated with KYW: \\"Strike out all particulars\\" Radio Service Bulletin, November 30, 1928, page 12.) =Temporary transfer (1924)= In order to maintain control over the WJAZ call letters while the new suburban facility was under construction, Zenith arranged to have the call sign of its second, low-powered Chicago station, located at the McCormick building and broadcasting on 1120 kHz, changed from WSAX to WJAZ.\\"Three Chicago Stations Change\\", Radio Age, July 1924, page 53.\\"Alterations and Corrections\\", Radio Service Bulletin, June 2, 1924, page 8.

Many communities surrounding Chicago expressed interest in becoming the permanent location for the re-established WJAZ. Zenith's president, E. F. McDonald, Jr., was quoted as saying \\"...the station will be erected where the community desires it. It goes without saying that a lot of advertising benefits will accrue to the place that will get the new WJAZ.\\"\\"First Portable Broadcaster Will Be Zenith Built\\", Pittsburgh Daily Post, August 13, 1924, Radio Broadcasting News section, page 2. However, the communities may not have been fully aware that they would only be hosting the transmitter site, with the station's studios remaining in Chicago. In order to evaluate the various locations, as well as generate publicity for the parent company, in the fall of 1924 Zenith constructed a 100-watt portable broadcasting station, mounted on the back of a 1-ton Federal-Knight truck.\\"New Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, October 1, 1924, page 3. (At the same time, Zenith's low-powered station reverted to its original call sign of WSAX, after it had been WJAZ for a few months: \\"Alterations and Corrections\\", Radio Service Bulletin, October 1, 1924, page 5. This restored WSAX was ultimately deleted the next year: \\"Strike out all particulars\\", Radio Service Bulletin, July 1, 1925, page 10.) The WJAZ call sign was transferred to this mobile outfit, which also transmitted on 1120 kHz. Befitting a portable, the station was completely self contained: the storage batteries that powered the transmitter were charged by an on-board generator, and it carried its own antenna, with gold-plated antenna wires supported by telescoping masts. Zenith reported that it would be evaluating sites within 100 miles (160 km) of Chicago.\\"Radio Gossip and News: WJAZ's Portable Station\\", Washington (D.C.) Evening Star, November 16, 1924, Part 1, page 39. \\"Seek New Location With Portable Set\\", Radio Digest, October 25, 1924, page 8. Broadcasts from each community featured entertainment plus speeches by local dignitaries. During the solar eclipse of January 24, 1925, the station was transported to Escanaba, Michigan, to document the effects of the dimming sun on radio transmissions.\\"Tests of Radio During Eclipse Confirm Wave Length Theories\\", Washington (D.C.) Evening Star, January 25, 1925, page 3. Following the selection of Mount Prospect as the permanent transmitter site, the portable station began making publicity tours, first through the midwest,\\"Musicians Here to Give Program\\", Findlay (Ohio) Morning Republican, May 2, 1925, page 2. followed by the western states, including Pikes Peak, Colorado.\\"The Far West Gets its Radio Thrill\\", Radio Age, October 1925, page 72. During the summer of 1925, in order to free up the call letters for transfer to the new permanent station, the portable's call sign was changed to WSAX, which it held until its deletion in the summer of 1928.Portable's call changed from WJAZ to WSAX: \\"Alterations and Corrections\\", Radio Service Bulletin, September 1, 1925, page 7; WSAX deletion: \\"Zone 5 Deleted Stations\\", Second Annual Report of the Federal Radio Commission For the Year Ended June 30, 1928, page 154. =Re-licensing (1925)= Following completion of the Mount Prospect transmission site, Zenith's revived WJAZ was licensed on October 1, 1925.\\"New Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, October 1, 1925, page 3. Its new studio was located on the 23rd floor of the Straus Building in Chicago.\\"WJAZ's New Studio\\", Radio Broadcast, October 1925, pages 767-769. The station's quality equipment and high power qualified it for classification as a \\"Class B\\" station. However, during the previous year the number of well- financed stations had steadily increased, and regulators at the Department of Commerce initially believed that there were no unused \\"Class B\\" assignments available for use by the station. In response, E. F. McDonald developed a compromise. He noted that KOA, the powerful General Electric station in Denver, Colorado, which had been exclusively assigned to the Class B frequency of 930 kHz, did not broadcast on Thursday nights, when it and other local stations observed \\"silent night\\", staying off the air so that local listeners could receive distant stations. Thus, McDonald proposed that, with KOA off the air, WJAZ could be permitted to broadcast on 930 kHz on Thursday evenings for two hours, from 10:00 p.m. to midnight Central time. In addition, McDonald reassured the Department of Commerce that \\"Our station is concerned with the sole purpose of giving to the public the highest form of entertainment in but a limited time. We have felt that to do this, sufficient high class talent could not be secured continuously throughout the year for more than two hours a week.\\" KOA management, plus two Cincinnati stations operating on an adjacent frequency, consented to this arrangement.The Beginning of Broadcast Regulation in the Twentieth Century by Marvin R. Bensman, 2000, pages 159-160. \\"Wave piracy\\" legal dispute (1926) February 1926 publicity photograph of the WJAZ engineering staff dressed as \\"wave pirates\\".WJAZ \\"wave pirates\\" publicity photograph, Popular Radio, May 1926, page 90. Despite E. F. McDonald's initial expression of satisfaction with a broadcast schedule of just two hours per week, he soon began demanding expanded hours after partnering with the Chicago Herald for additional programming, and Zenith's general counsel, Irving Herriott, later testified that \\"At no time was it the intention to be satisfied with two hours a week.\\"Senate Radio Control Hearings, January 8-9, 1926, page 289. The United States at this time had an informal agreement with Canada that six designated AM band frequencies would be used exclusively by Canadian stations. In early January 1926, McDonald directed WJAZ to move from its 930 kHz assignment to 910 kHz, one of the restricted Canadian frequencies, and begin expanded hours of operation. The U.S. government accused WJAZ of \\"pirating\\" the Canadian frequency and ordered the station to return to 930 kHz, while threatening legal action if it did not comply. However, McDonald was defiant, countering that \\"...Zenith Radio Corporation intends to litigate in every possible way the questions involved\\".\\"U. S. Questions WJAZ's Wave Right\\", Radio Age, March 1926, page 19. On February 5, 1926, WJAZ broadcast the operetta \\"The Pirate\\", and publicity photographs of engineering staff dressed as \\"wave pirates\\" were distributed to newspapers and magazines.\\"'Yo- ho-ho'\\" Sing Pirates Bold\\", Radio Digest, April 3, 1926, pages 5, 8. On January 20, the federal suit United States versus Zenith Radio Corporation and E. F. McDonald was filed in Chicago. McDonald expected a narrow ruling in his favor, claiming that only a small number of stations, including WJAZ, held the \\"Class D Developmental\\" licenses that were free from normal restrictions. However, some earlier legal challenges had raised doubts about the extent that the Department of Commerce, under the provisions of the Radio Act of 1912, could restrict licenses and designate transmitting frequencies, and the actual outcome was sweeping. On April 16, 1926, Judge James H. Wilkerson's ruling was announced, which stated that under the 1912 Act the Commerce Department in fact could not limit the number of broadcasting licenses issued, or designate station frequencies. The U.S. government reviewed whether to appeal this decision, but Acting Attorney General William Donovan sided with the original decision.Benson (2000) pages 167-175.\\"Federal Regulation of Radio Broadcasting\\" by Acting Attorney William J. Donovan (July 8, 1926), Official Opinions of the Attorneys General of the United States, Volume 35, 1929, pages 126-132. The immediate result of the court case was a large increase in the number of stations, reaching over 730 by the time the Radio Act of 1927 was passed in February 1927 to restore government control. This act formed the Federal Radio Commission (FRC), which was tasked with undoing the disruption which the WJAZ case had triggered. On May 3, 1927 the first of numerous reassignments shifted WJAZ away from the Canadian frequency to 760 kHz,\\"List of broadcasting stations issued temporary permits\\" (May 3, 1927), Radio Service Bulletin, April 30, 1927, page 12. and this was followed the next month by a move 1140 kHz.\\"Broadcasting Stations\\" (Effective June 15, 1927), Radio Service Bulletin, May 31, 1927, page 6. On November 11, 1928, implementation of the FRC's General Order 40 resulted in a major reorganization of the AM broadcasting band. WJAZ was reassigned to 1480 kHz, and required to divide hours on this frequency with two other Illinois stations: WHT in Deerfield, and WORD in Batavia.\\"Broadcasting Stations, by wave lengths, effective November 11, 1928\\", Commercial and Government Radio Stations of the United States (edition June 30, 1928), page 176. WIBO, Des Plaines, Illinois, was originally said to also be moving to 1480 kHz, but instead was assigned first to 570 kHz, then 560 kHz. Station deletion (1931) In early 1929 a newly licensed station, WCKY in Covington, Kentucky, was added as a fourth assignment to the three Chicago-area stations broadcasting on 1480 kHz.\\"New Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, February 28, 1929, page 5.

In early 1930 all four stations were reassigned from 1480 kHz to 1490 kHz.\\"Alterations and Corrections\\", Radio Service Bulletin, February 28, 1930, page 23.

Unsatisfied with its somewhat limited schedule, WCKY petitioned the FRC to delete the two remaining Chicago-area stations, and give it unlimited use of the frequency. An FRC examiner recommended that this request be denied, however a review by the full commission ruled on October 30, 1931 in favor of WCKY, and ordered both WJAZ and WCHI deleted. As part of its justification, the Commission noted that, even though WJAZ was only allocated two hours a day, it was not broadcasting during all of its available hours, in addition to operating with less than its full authorized power of 5,000 watts.\\"Six More Stations Ordered Silenced\\", Broadcasting, November 1, 1931, page 12.

Bettelmann is of German origin and is mentioned as early as 1841. It closely resembles Battle.  Rules  The rules appear to have changed little in over a century. The following are based on Pierer (1841), G√∂√∂ck (1967) and M√ºller (1994). The game is usually played by children and originally used a 32-card German-suited pack (Pierer and G√∂√∂ck); later rules (Feder and M√ºller) only cite French-suited cards. Both players are given 16 cards, unseen, which they place face down in front of them. Non-dealer plays his top card to the table, face up. Dealer then plays his top card. Cards rank in their natural order and the trick is taken by the highest ranking card, regardless of suit. The trick winner adds the trick to the bottom of his pile. If the two cards are the same rank, they remain in place and are captured by the winner of the next trick (Pierer) or the player who played the first card wins (G√∂√∂ck, M√ºller). The latter suggests that the trick winner leads to the next trick although this is nowhere stated by either source. The first player to run out of cards is the Beggar (Bettelmann) and loses the game. Pierer adds the rule that, if a player is down to his last 3 cards, he may then look at them and (presumably) play them in any order to the next trick(s). If he wins a trick such that he now has more than 3 cards again, he turns his cards face down again and the trick is placed at the bottom of his pile. Pierer also adds that \\"if more than two play, the cards are dealt and played in the same way\\".  Tod und Leben  In some sources the rules for Tod und Leben are identical to those of Bettelmann.See for example Tod und Leben at www.pagat.com However, Feder (1980), G√∂√∂ck (1967), M√ºller (1994) and Ethische Kultur (1893) all state that, in Tod und Leben, the cards are first divided into those of the red suits - the Goodies (die Guten) or Life (Leben) - and those of the black suits - the Baddies (die B√∂sen) or Death (Tod). One player plays with the reds and the other with the blacks. The highest-ranking card wins the trick regardless of suit; if equal ranking cards are played, they are left in situ and taken by the winner of the next trick. The overall winner is the first one to capture all the cards.  References   Literature  * _ (1893). Ethische Kultur: Halbmonatsschrift f√ºr Ethisch- Soziale Reformen. Volume 1. * Feder, Jan (1980).

Building The small neo-baroque palace at Hardenbergstrasse 21‚Äì23 was built in 1889. Located near the Berlin Zoologischer Garten railway station (where the Amerika Haus Berlin is now located), it was the ostentatious residence of its bourgeois owners (Wilhelm and Anna Koch). After the death of the owner's family, it initially served film and stage actors (B√ºhne und Film e.V.) as their elegant club.

Was nicht im Baedeker steht. Berlin, M√ºnchen 1927, p. 69, In addition to the restaurant and bar, the establishment offered a grand garden on the rear side of the house, where guests could sit under the trees and dance on a dance floor throughout the night. Famous musicians and bands, such as Mike Danzi, Paul Godwin, Ren√© Dumont, Dajos B√©la, Harry Revel and Bernhard Barenblatt played for an \\"audience who have the necessary wherewithal\\", according to the Berlin Journalist Adolf Stein alias ‚ÄúRumpelstilzchen‚Äù on the occasion of the opening of the restaurant. Changes of owner and name The Wall Street Crash of 1929 (Black Thursday) and the Great Depression that followed, plus the pressure of competition between the entertainment bars, rapidly downgraded the economic situation of many gastronomic companies. In 1929, the ‚ÄúVilla d‚ÄôEste‚Äù had already passed into the hands of Jewish restaurateur, Josef K√∂nig, and renamed as ‚ÄúCafe K√∂nig am Zoo ‚Äì Villa d‚ÄôEste‚Äù. Possibly, as a prediction of the upcoming threat of the political situation, K√∂nig sold his ownership of the ‚ÄúVilla d‚ÄôEste‚Äù, in the spring of 1932. The new owner renamed the restaurant as ‚ÄúKaffee Aquarium‚Äù. But from the viewpoint of Berlin society, the building continued to be known as ‚ÄúVilla d‚ÄôEste‚Äù.

The ship's name is an 18th-century word derived from the French \\"gardez l‚Äôeau\\" (\\"mind the water\\"), used in Edinburgh to warn passers-by of waste about to be thrown from a window into the street below. Prior to 1978, the city of Edinburgh's waste was discharged into the Forth from a series of eight outlets along the coastline, where it often washed back up on beaches and rocks. Construction and description Built at a cost of ¬£1.87 million by Ferguson Brothers (Port Glasgow) Ltd. in Port Glasgow, Gardyloos task was to remove Edinburgh's sludge waste for disposal in two spots in the North Sea. The ship was launched on 4 February 1976 and was registered as a British ship with Official Number 366470 on 29 August in the same year. Later Gardyloo was allocated IMO Number 7427180 as its permanent identity. Gardyloo was LOA and ( LBP, with a beam of and depth of .

Sewage service The ship did not go immediately into service from Leith, but was first chartered to Strathclyde Regional Council for a year from October 1976 as a replacement for their sludge vessel Shieldhall. Beginning in 1978, Gardyloo made its sewage dumping trip up to three times a week, leaving Leith Docks at 8am to release its cargo at a spot close to the Bell Rock from May until October, and off St Abb's from October to May. It returned to Leith Docks around 6pm. In more than 2600 voyages, the MV Gardyloo dumped 8.5 million tonnes of sewage. The trip was open to the public, and during the 21 years of its operation, the MV Gardyloo carried 6000 passengers This practice ceased at the end of 1998, when dumping was banned by the EU Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, and Seafield Waste Water Treatment Works was extended to perform secondary treatment on the sewage, after which it went to a landfill site. Tanker service After being laid up at Hull, MV Gardyloo was sold to Unilink Group in London, then to Whittaker Tanker Co., to Delta Tank Shipping Ltd, by whom it was renamed Delta Tank. In 2004 the ship was sold to the state shipping enterprise Azerbaijan Caspian Shipping of Baku and has, since 2006, been managed by Meridian Shipping & Management LLC, Baku, as the water carrier Shollar.

It stars Leah Lewis, Daniel Diemer, Alexxis Lemire, and Collin Chou. Netflix released the film on May 1, 2020 to positive reviews. The film received the Founders Award for Best Narrative Feature at the 2020 Tribeca Film Festival. Plot Friendless student Ellie Chu lives in the remote town of Squahamish, where she makes extra money writing homework papers for her fellow students. She lives with her widowed father and performs most of his duties as station master and signalman. She is approached by Paul Munsky, an inarticulate football player, to write a love letter to Aster Flores, a girl at their school. Ellie is secretly in love with Aster and initially refuses, but accepts the work after learning that her home's electricity will be shut off if they fail to make a minimum payment. Aster is dating Trig, a boy from a wealthy family, and Ellie (posing as Paul) begins a heartfelt correspondence with Aster in letters and text messages. The two begin to connect over their shared interests in literature and art, though Aster believes she is communicating with Paul. Meanwhile, Ellie's English teacher encourages her to apply to Grinnell College, but Ellie plans to stay in Squahamish, despite being unhappy there, because she doesn't want to leave her father. Ellie sets up Paul on a date with Aster, but it goes badly because Paul is unable to converse with her like Ellie can. Ellie regards this as the end of their attempts, but after Paul defends her from bullies, she agrees to teach him about art and literature. Ellie and Paul begin to bond as they open up about their familial struggles. Paul's second date with Aster goes as badly as the first, but Ellie saves the evening by texting Aster, pretending to be Paul, who abruptly professes his romantic interest in Aster, and later tells Ellie that he kissed her. Paul brings Ellie to a party and takes her to his home after she becomes intoxicated, where he sees letters in her bag addressed to food critics, presumably about his sausage creations. Aster invites Ellie to spend the day together. She takes her to a hidden hot spring where they swim and share an intimate conversation. Aster reveals that Trig intends to marry her, while Ellie reveals that she does not believe in God and talks about her deceased mother. Meanwhile, at Ellie's house, Paul and her father bond as they make sausages. Later, Ellie watches from her window as Paul and Aster kiss, and she decides to apply to Grinnell. After a game, mistakenly believing that she loves him, and having developed feelings for her, Paul attempts to kiss Ellie, but she rejects him. Aster sees them and walks away angrily. Paul realizes that Ellie loves Aster and, due to his religious upbringing, tells Ellie that it is a sin. When Paul delivers sausage to Ellie's father, Ellie's father and Paul have a conversation about love and asks Paul if he's ever loved someone so much that he didn't want to change anything about them. Trig proposes to Aster at a church service, but Ellie and Paul publicly interrupt the moment. Aster realizes that Ellie wrote the letters and texts to her, slaps Paul, and storms out. Before leaving for Grinnell, Ellie apologizes to Aster for deceiving her. Aster admits she may have had feelings for Ellie and that she is applying to art school. Ellie kisses Aster and tells her that she'll see her in a couple of years. Paul sees Ellie off at the train platform and tells her that his sausages have received good reviews, and that he'll keep visiting her father. As in Ek Villain, the movie they watched together, Paul runs besides the train as it leaves. Ellie laughs at his silliness, then observes the passengers around her as she goes off to start a new journey in her life. Cast Production In April 2019, it was announced Leah Lewis, Alexxis Lemire, Daniel Diemer, Becky Ann Baker, Catherine Curtin, Wolfgang Novogratz, and Enrique Murciano had joined the cast of the film, with Alice Wu directing from a screenplay she wrote. Wu and Anthony Bregman served as producers on the film, with Netflix distributing. In June 2019, it was announced that Collin Chou joined the cast. =Filming= Principal photography began on April 22, 2019 in New York and concluded on May 31, 2019. Release It was scheduled to have its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 18, 2020. However, the festival was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was released on May 1, 2020. Critical response On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 97% based on 90 reviews, and an average rating of 7.89/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"For viewers in search of an uncommonly smart, tender, and funny coming-of-age story, The Half of It has everything. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 75 out of 100 based on 20 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Decider said the plot is \\"an unbearably cute premise‚Äîa modern-day Cyrano de Bergerac with a queer twist‚Äîthat seems so perfect and so obvious, it‚Äôs a wonder the movie hasn‚Äôt been made yet\\", and \\"an adorable teen film that will no doubt service an extremely underserved audience.\\" Rolling Stone praised the direction, stating that \\"the gentle touch Wu uses as a filmmaker, which only occasionally drifts into tidiness, does not dull the edges of her quietly revolutionary achievement in telling the story of a young lesbian immigrant‚Äôs journey to self-acceptance. In a movie brimming over with the pleasures of the unexpected, that‚Äôs the best part.\\" The New York Times noted that \\"Wu suffuses the film with a painfully mature understanding of the ache of longing for the impossible.\\" Bitch magazine wrote that \\"while these teenage-focused...movies flirt with the idea of lesbian relationships, they quickly pivot before their casual interest can evolve into any fully realized romance\\", with the film's story seeming \\"to be more about the halfway happiness Ellie's given: maybe some acceptance, maybe a friend, maybe a first love. It's not the happy story we were sold via the trailer, and it feels like more promises that only halfway delivered.\\" Leah Lewis (the actress who portrayed Ellie Chu) told Teen Vogue in an interview on 1 May 2020 that: \\"Most people think a love story has an equation, and that's usually boy meets girl, girl meets boy, or girl meets girl.\\" However, in this case \\"[i]t's a self-love story because these characters don't really end up with each other, but at the very end, they end up with _something_. For me, that's even more valuable than just finding your other half; it's finding a part of yourself along the way. It is a love story, it's just not a 'romance' story.\\" In a post dated May 22, 2020, A.O.

These beliefs, including nationalism, racism, and opposition to Marxism, have been compared to fascism, although the party rejected the term as a description of its political stance. Far-right politics, fascism, and neo-Nazism A far right or extreme right party, the National Front had both commonalities and differences with older far-right groups. Political scientists and historians characterise it as fascist, or neo-fascist. The political psychologist Michael Billig noted that the NF displayed many of fascism's recurring traits: an emphasis on nationalism and racism, an anti-Marxist stance, statism and a support for the retention of capitalism, and a threatening stance towards democracy and personal freedom. The historian Martin Durham stated that the NF‚Äîlike France's National Front and Germany's The Republicans‚Äîrepresented \\"the direct descendants of classical fascism\\". Its fascism was nevertheless not identical to that of the 1930s, and the sociologist Christopher T. Husbands cautioned against trying to understand it through comparisons with Italian Fascism or German Nazism as they existed when they were in power. The NF rejected the term \\"fascist\\" to describe itself. As well as denying its leaders' previous fascist activities, it claimed that it could not be fascist because it took part in elections. The political scientist Stan Taylor argued that this claim was obsolete, for many previous fascist parties‚Äîincluding the British Union of Fascists, the German Nazi Party, and the Italian National Fascist Party‚Äîalso stood in elections. In avoiding the \\"fascist\\" label, the NF was typical of fascist groups operating after the Second World War; these post-war fascists had to contend with the legacy of the war and the Holocaust, and thus tried to hide their intellectual pedigrees from voters. The NF's founders tried to present it as a nationalist party unconnected to historical fascism, recognising that this would be vital if it were to succeed as an electoral force. To do so it adopted \\"new labels, styles and tactics\\" to present itself as a \\"respectable political party\\". As with other politically extreme groups, the image the Front presented to the public was a limited and more moderate version of the ideology of its inner core of members. As noted by Billig, the NF's \\"ideological core, and its genocidal tendencies, are hidden\\" so as not to scare off potential recruits sympathetic to its nationalism and anti-immigration stance but not its anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. While noting that its views on race departed considerably \\"from what is normal or acceptable to the average citizen\\" in the UK, the political scientist Nigel Fielding observed that many of its other views were grounded in what would be considered \\"popular common-sense opinion\\" across the political right. In the 1970s, several NF policies were close to the views common in the right-wing of the Conservative Party, although Tyndall distanced the NF from conservatism, stating in Spearhead that his party did not stand \\"for some kind of super-reactionary conservatism ‚Äî more Tory than the Tories\\", but was a revolutionary force pursuing a radical transformation of Britain. In proposing radical reform while emphasising ties to the past, Fielding noted that the NF was \\"not blindly traditionalist\\" but \\"wishes to return to what it conceives of as the spirit of the old order\\", even if its conception of the \\"old order\\" was historically inaccurate. =Factions= During its history, the NF contained various factions with distinct ideological positions. From the party's early days until the 1980 Tyndall/Webster split, its ideology and propaganda output was dominated by the ex-GBM faction. According to Wilkinson, this faction's leadership was \\"deeply imbued with Nazi ideas\\" and retained \\"intimate connections with small Neo-Nazi cells in Britain and abroad\\". According to Thurlow, the ex-GBM faction oversaw \\"an attempt to portray the essentials of Nazi ideology in more rational language and seemingly reasonable arguments\\". He added that the party's leadership in this period displayed a \\"barely concealed Nazism\\", and that they treated the party as a means by which to attract those with anti-immigrant sentiments and \\"convert\\" them \\"into fascists\\". Taylor also regarded the 1970s NF as a Nazi outfit because of its specific fixation on anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, a feature not present in all fascist groups. In his words, the NF's \\"full ideology\\" was, \\"in a large number of respects\\", identical to the original German Nazism. In the late 1970s, the \\"Populist\\" faction grew and challenged the ex-GBM faction's dominance; according to Thurlow, its members were \\"pseudo-Conservative racial populists\\", representing the party's \\"non-fascist and ostensibly more democratic element\\". After Tyndall and Webster were ousted and replaced by Brons and Anderson, a new faction took control of the party whose members regarded themselves as Strasserite, drawing inspiration from German Nazi Party members Otto Strasser and Gregor Strasser. This faction embraced the Third Position ideology and drew inspiration from Gaddafi's Third International Theory; their views have also been characterised as National Bolshevist. Ethnic nationalism and racism One variant of the National Front logo used by the party The National Front is a British nationalist party, and in its early policy statements declared that it \\"pledged to work for the restoration of full national sovereignty for Britain in all affairs\\". It rejected internationalism and thus opposed both liberalism and communism, contrasting their internationalist espousal of universal values with its view that different nations should have their own distinct values. Labelling itself a racial nationalist party, the NF's concept of nationalism was bound up with that of race. NF members typically referred to themselves as \\"racialists\\", while Durham stated that the NF was \\"undeniably a racist organisation\\". It claimed that humanity divides up into biologically distinct races with their own physical and social characteristics. Although some of its published material referred purely to a division between \\"white\\" and \\"black\\" races, elsewhere it referred to a wider array of racial groups, among them the \\"Nordics\\", \\"Caucasoids\\", \\"Negroids\\", \\"Semites\\", and \\"Turco-Armonoids\\". It claimed that within racial groups can be found \\"nations\\", a form of \\"race within a race\\"; many party activists nevertheless used the terms \\"race\\" and \\"nation\\" interchangeably. The NF claimed the existence of a distinct British racial \\"nation\\", all the members of which shared common interests; Welsh nationalism and Scottish nationalism were condemned as threats to British racial unity. It viewed class as a false and needless distinction among the British race, rejecting the concept of class war as \\"nonsense\\", and‚Äîlike most fascist groups‚Äîtried to attract support across class boundaries. For the NF, patriotism was deemed essential to the cohesion and morale of the British nation, with nationalism being regarded as a vital component of patriotism. Members of the National Front regarded themselves as British patriots, and the party made heavy use of British patriotic symbolism, such as that of the Union flag and of Remembrance Day. Fielding believed that the \\"dialectic of insiders and outsiders\\" was the \\"linchpin of its ideology\\", and noted that the NF's \\"rigid boundaries between in-group and out-group\\" was typical of the far- right. In its 1974 electoral manifesto, the NF called for a \\"vigorous birth- rate\\" among the white British, claiming that any ensuing overpopulation of the UK could be resolved by emigration to the British Commonwealth. Tyndall defended Nazi Germany's lebensraum policy, and under his leadership the NF promoted imperialist views about expanding British territory to serve as \\"living space\\" for the country's growing population. As of 1979, the party was combining this policy with eugenicist ideas, calling for the improvement of the quality as well as the quantity of the white British racial group. By 2011, the party's website was utilising the Fourteen Words slogan: \\"We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.\\" White supremacism The National Front is a white supremacist party. Rejecting the concept of racial equality, it argued that different races can be ranked on a hierarchy based on differing abilities. It believed that the \\"higher races\\" struggle against one another for world domination, and that that racial segregation was natural and ordained by God. It promoted the conspiracy theory that non-whites were intentionally encouraged to migrate to Britain and other white-majority countries to breed with the indigenous inhabitants and thus bring about \\"white genocide\\" through assimilation. It opposed inter-racial marriage and miscegenation‚Äîtypically referring to the latter as \\"mongrelisation\\"‚Äîand displayed particular anxiety about black men seducing white women. Odal rune The NF claimed that most non-white racial groups were genetically inferior to \\"Caucasoids and Mongoloids\\". It claimed that whites are inherently superior to blacks, with the latter contributing nothing to humanity. In the mid-1970s, Tyndall used Spearhead to claim that \\"the negro has a smaller brain and a much less complex cerebral structure\\" than white Europeans; in the early 1980s, Nationalism Today carried articles maintaining that black Africans had lower average IQs than white Europeans and thus were unfit \\"to go to white schools\\" or \\"live in white society\\". In depicting black people, the NF promoted what Billig characterised as \\"an image of savagery and primitiveness\\"; its published material presented black people as dirty and unhygienic, infected with disease, and incapable of governing themselves. Spearhead featured references to black people being cannibals, and at least one article claimed they ate dirt and faeces. The NF claimed its racial prejudice arose from a natural human desire for racial preservation rather than mere hatred; thus, it sought to present itself as being more than a hate group. The party wanted to establish academic support for its racial views, placing great importance on scientific racist publications. Its booklist offered academic and quasi-academic books endorsing scientific racism, and early party literature regularly referenced the work of Hans Eysenck, William Shockley, Arthur Jensen, and Richard Herrnstein. Spearhead and other NF publications repeatedly cited articles from the scientific racist journal Mankind Quarterly. In citing these studies, the party claimed that its views were scientific and that those who rejected them were not. Fielding nevertheless observed that the NF's racial views rely \\"as much on blind assertion, on faith, as on 'scientific' sources\\". Anti-immigrationism and repatriation The cornerstone of the National Front's manifesto since 1974 has been the compulsory deportation of all non-white immigrants, along with their descendants, as well as the white British partners in mixed-race relationships. It stated that the \\"repatriation\\" process could take ten years, adding that before deportation, non-whites would be stripped of British citizenship and placed behind white Britons when it comes to access to welfare, education, and housing. It accompanied this with a call to prohibit future non-white migration to Britain. In the 1970s, the NF stated that it did not oppose the arrival of white immigrants from Commonwealth countries, but called for \\"firm controls\\" on the migration of whites from other countries. During its first decade, the party emphasised the claim that it was the politicians who enabled immigration‚Äîrather than migrants themselves‚Äîwho were to blame. In 1969, it stated: \\"Your enemies are not the coloured immigrants, but the British government which let them come in hundreds of thousands.\\" The NF claimed that non-white migration to Britain was masterminded by communists and promoted by the Labour Party, who believed it would boost their vote, and the Conservative Party, who saw migrants as cheap labour. Its early manifestos and other publications generally avoided describing non-whites with derogatory terms like \\"wog\\" or \\"nigger\\", although such language was used at party rallies. As it developed, the NF press included racially inflammatory headlines like \\"Black Savages Terrorize Old Folk\\" and \\"Asians Import Bizarre Sex-Murder Rites\\", also comparing non-white migrants with vermin by describing areas with large African and Asian communities as \\"immigrant-infested\\". The NF linked other political themes to race and immigration, and targeted concerns among the white British population about immigrants being competition for jobs, housing, and welfare. Among the \\"standard forms of NF propaganda\\" was the claim that immigrants carried diseases like leprosy and tuberculosis, that they placed a heavy burden on the National Health Service (NHS), and that incompetent and poorly trained migrant staff were detrimental to the NHS. It maintained that school quality was eroded by black pupils, that the employment of black workers left many whites unemployed, and that blacks were a source of crime. It claimed that immigrants evaded taxes, and that they were arrogant, aggressive, and unhygienic in the workplace. This anti-immigrant discourse was similar to that employed against Ashkenazi Jewish migrants in the late 19th century and also echoed the response to gypsies and Huguenots in 17th-century England. Anti-Semitism The NF is racially anti-Semitic. It claimed that Jews form a biologically distinct race‚Äîone of the world's \\"higher races\\"‚Äîand that they seek to destroy the white \\"Caucasoid\\" race by encouraging internal divisions within it and by promoting internationalism and miscegenation to weaken it through racial mixing. This Jewish cabal, the NF argued, orchestrated non-white migration into Britain. The party claimed that the Jewish race did this to plunge other \\"higher races\\" in disarray so that they would be left dominant. As related in Spearhead, this achieved, \\"the Jewish nation would be the only surviving ethnically identifiable population group amid a mongrelised world population\\", the latter being easier for the Jewish cabal to control. The NF profess the view that those disagreeing with its claims on this issue are ignorant of reality. Such views are a conspiracy theory, part of a longstanding conspiracist tradition about secretive groups manipulating international events that stretches back to the 18th century. The NF's anti-Semitic variant of this myth owes much to the 19th century Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a Russian anti-Semitic forgery, and is virtually identical to claims previously articulated by the British Union of Fascists (BUF). Whereas the BUF was explicit in presenting this global conspiracy as being run by Jews, the NF‚Äîaware of considerable public disapproval of anti- Semitism following the Holocaust‚Äîwas more circumspect, using code-words like \\"Money Power\\", \\"internationalist\\", \\"cosmopolitan\\", \\"alien\\", \\"rootless\\", \\"shifty\\", \\"money-lenders\\", and \\"usurers\\" in place of \\"Jews\\". In the 1970s, the NF rejected the characterisation of its policies as \\"anti-Semitism\\". Instead, it called itself \\"anti-Zionist\\", claiming that it only opposed \\"Zionists\\" rather than all Jews. Within the NF, the word \\"Zionism\\" is not used in the commonly understood manner‚Äîto describe the ideology promoting the formation of a Jewish state‚Äîbut rather applied to the Jewish cabal secretly manipulating the world. For instance, one issue of Spearhead stated that \\"the twin evils of International Finance and International Communism\\" are \\"perhaps better described as International Zionism\\". Fielding observed that in the party, the term \\"Zionist\\" was used indiscriminately and without precision, often against any of its critics, and that its activists often exhibited anti-Semitic attitudes. Many of the Front's central members‚Äîamong them Chesterton, Tyndall, and Webster‚Äîhad a long history of anti-Semitic activity before joining the party. For instance, in 1963, Tyndall claimed that \\"Jewry is a world pest wherever it is found in the world today. The Jews are more clever and more financially powerful than other people and have to be eradicated before they destroy the Aryan peoples.\\" In an early edition of Spearhead, Tyndall stated: \\"if Britain were to become Jew-clean she would have no nigger neighbours to worry about... It is the Jews who are our misfortune: T-h-e J-e-w-s. Do you hear me? THE JEWS?\\" While some of its senior members had previously called for a genocide of the Jews, the party itself engaged in Holocaust denial, referring to the Holocaust as \\"the six million myth\\" in its literature. In promoting Holocaust denial, NF members might be trying to rehabilitate Hitler and the Nazi regime among the British population. It is possible that most senior NF figures are aware that the Holocaust really happened, but deny its occurrence solely for tactical reasons. Government and the state The Green Book of Muammar Gaddafi (pictured). According to Fielding, the NF's commitment to parliamentary democracy was \\"not ideological but functional.\\" During the 1970s, the Front alleged that the UK's liberal democracy was \\"bogus democracy\\" and declared that it would forge \\"a genuinely democratic political system\\", introducing public referenda on major issues. In making claims such as that \\"true democracy is that which is representative of the will of the people\\", the latter being presented as a monolithic entity, the NF engaged in populist rhetoric. Fielding nevertheless believed that \\"the essence of the NF ideology is incompatible with democracy\\" and instead reflects an \\"elitist tendency\\" quite at odds with the \\"populist rhetoric\\" that it used to promote its message. The NF saw democracy as a luxury that was subordinate to the cause of preserving the nation. In Spearhead, Tyndall stated that although he would support parliamentary democracy if he thought it in the national interest, \\"the survival, and the national recovery of Britain stand as top priority over all. We will support whatever political methods are necessary to attain that end.\\" He called for governance by a strong leader, an individual unencumbered by political parties and elections so that they could focus on the national interest rather than the interests of sub-groups or short-term considerations. In Spearhead, Tyndall stated that \\"it is only in banana republics, where the 'sophisticated' Western institutions of a multi- or two- party system, powerful trade unions and a 'free' press have not yet taken root, that there is still scope for men of real personality and decision to emerge and truly lead.\\" It also expressed support for the retention of the British monarchy. Observing that \\"there is in NF ideology a strong orientation to charismatic leadership and authoritarian control\\", Fielding believed that had the NF achieved political office it would have marginalised parliament and governed in a totalitarian manner. Under the party's Strasserite leadership during the 1980s, the NF adopted a radically different position on governance, influenced heavily by the Third International Theory propounded by Libya's leader Muammar Gaddafi in his The Green Book. It promoted the establishment of communal political structures, with street councils, area councils, county councils, and a National People's Council \\"for each of the British Nations\\". In its view of this future, the British population would be armed and trained in military tactics, allowing for the establishment of local militias rather than a state-controlled professional army. International institutions and relations From its early years, the Front opposed the UK's membership of the European Economic Community (EEC), deeming it a threat to British national sovereignty, and seeing the EEC as part of the international Jewish conspiracy's plan for a one world government. During the early 1970s it called on members to obstruct the EEC bureaucracy in any way possible, urging them to \\"defy the law ‚Äì be prepared to go to prison too as a gesture of defiance\\" against the EEC. In March 1975 it sought affiliation with the National Referendum Campaign (NRC), then campaigning for the UK to leave the EEC in that year's referendum. After the NRC rejected the offer, NF members disrupted an NRC meeting at London's Conway Hall. The National Front called for the UK's withdrawal from the European Economic Community (flag pictured) To replace the EEC, the NF called for the UK to establish stronger links with the \\"White countries\\" of the British Commonwealth, namely Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, but also the white-minority governments of Rhodesia and South Africa. According to the Front, this would \\"strengthen the ethnic, cultural and family ties between peoples of British stock all over the world\\". It stated that an NF-led UK would not remain allied to the United States because the latter was dominated by the Jewish world conspiracy, and called for withdrawal from the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, with Britain instead boosting its defensive capabilities by producing more nuclear weapons. It stipulated that it would cease the payment of foreign aid, and called for withdrawal from the United Nations, claiming that the organisation was a \\"major weapon of International Finance\\" and unduly impacted by a \\"Communist and AfroAsian [sic] influence\\". During the 1970s the Front was British unionist, advocating for the unity of the United Kingdom. From the late 1960s onward, it supported the Ulster Unionists, deeming Irish republicanism a communist conspiracy to undermine British unity. As NF leader, Tyndall insisted that Britain must \\"destroy [Irish] republicanism, not just violent republicanism ‚Äì as represented by the IRA ‚Äì but republicanism in every shape and form\\". In Spearhead, he nevertheless critiqued Northern Ireland's \\"religious squabbles\\" between Catholic and Protestant as \\"absurd\\". The NF argued that the UK had been too soft in dealing with militant Irish republicans; it argued that military courts should replace civil ones, that IRA members should be interned, and that those guilty of sabotage or murder should be executed. In the early 1970s it alleged that the Irish Republic was harbouring republican militants, \\"an act of war\\" that required trade sanctions. In the 1970s the NF endorsed the right-wing Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party, but many Ulster Unionists were suspicious of the NF; in 1973 the Ulster Defence Association proscribed it as \\"a neo-Nazi movement\\". In 1985‚Äîby which time Strasserites dominated the NF‚Äîit called on Northern Ireland to unilaterally declare independence from the UK in response to the Anglo-Irish Agreement. Economic policy During the 1970s, the Front claimed to be neither capitalist nor socialist, advocating an economic system drawing on both. It endorsed private enterprise but rejected laissez-faire capitalism, claiming that the latter places the interests of business above that of the nation. It promoted economic nationalism, calling for maximum national self-sufficiency and a rejection of international free trade. In this, it wanted to separate Britain from the international financial system, which it believed was controlled by the Jewish conspiracy. The NF opposed foreign ownership of British industry, arguing that North Sea Oil production should only be in the hands of British companies. Its policies were protectionist and monetarist, advocating the state control of banking and financial services, and calling for a state bank to provide interest free loans to fund the construction of municipal housing. These economic views were common across Britain's far-right, for instance being akin to those of Oswald Mosley and his BUF. Its opposition to unrestricted free markets led various Conservatives to regard it as a socialist party, a classification not endorsed by academic observers. After the Strasserite faction took control of the party in the 1980s, it adopted distributist policies, maintaining the emphasis on an economic system neither capitalist nor socialist. In the party's material from 1980, it claimed that \\"Capitalism and Communism\\" were \\"twin evils\\" to be overcome by \\"Revolutionary Nationalism\\". In keeping with the Strasserite's distributist doctrine, the 1980s NF called for all large business and industry to be broken up and redistributed into a tripartite system: small privately owned enterprises, workers' co-operatives, and‚Äîin the case of financial institutions and heavy industry‚Äînationalised enterprises. Retaining the party's longstanding economic nationalism, the Strasserite leadership called for the abolition of the stock exchange, with the introduction of import controls and bans on the export of capital. As a solution to unemployment, the party stated that it would encourage urban-to-rural migration, with heavily mechanised agriculture being replaced by small, privately owned, labour-intensive farms. This policy was likely influenced by the far-right's general antipathy toward urban living and its belief in the superiority of rural life. Social issues London LGBT Pride march in 2007; the party has tried to protest against various Pride parades The NF adopted a strong anti-permissive stance. It claimed that what it perceived as the growing permissiveness of British society had resulted in moral decadence and social decay, and alleged that this was orchestrated by the Jewish conspiracy. Tyndall called for a moral \\"regeneration\\" penetrating \\"every sphere of work and leisure\\", with an NF government criminalising \\"the promotion of art, literature or entertainment by which public moral standards might be endangered\\". Although it placed little importance on religion, during the 1970s, the party claimed that God had set forth absolute moral values. While it endorsed Ulster loyalism it did not share its emphasis on defending Protestantism. The party is anti-feminist, having described feminism as \\"puerile Marxist rubbish\\". It is highly critical of changes to traditional gender roles, with Spearhead noting that the NF sees \\"the feminine role as principally one of wife, mother and home maker\\". In the party's first year, it largely ignored the 1967 Abortion Act that legalised abortion in Britain, although by 1974 had adopted an anti-abortion stance, stating that abortions should only be legal in medical emergencies. According to Tyndall, the legalisation of abortion was part of a conspiracy to reduce the white British birth rate; he also claimed that the provision of birth control was part of this conspiracy. The issue decreased in resonance within the party during the early 1980s but was re-emphasised when the Strasserites took control: in 1987, National Front News claimed that abortion was \\"the greatest and most fundamentally evil holocaust that the world has ever seen\\". The party censures homosexuality, supporting the reintroduction of Section 28 and the recriminalisation of same-sex sexual activity. From its early years, the party has opposed mixed race marriages. During the 1970s, NF activists were involved in anti-prostitution campaigns, and in 1977 joined protests against the Paedophile Information Exchange. In the 1970s, the NF claimed that the teaching profession was full of communists‚Äîin 1978 it issued the leaflet How to Spot a Red Teacher to school pupils‚Äîand stated that under an NF government all teachers deemed unsuitable would be fired. That decade, the party stressed its belief that education should be suited to the varying academic abilities of different students although did not outright condemn the comprehensive school system. It called for greater emphasis on examinations and sporting competitions, with a rejection of \\"slapdash Leftwing-inspired teaching fads\\". It stated that it would emphasise the teaching of British history to encourage patriotic sentiment, while expanding the place of science and technology in the curriculum at the expense of the social sciences, lambasting the latter as \\"a mere form of academic Marxism\\". In further education, it called for stronger emphasis on training in technology and industrial management. The Front exalts self-sufficiency, asserting that the individual should be willing to serve the state and that citizens' rights should be subordinate to their duties. During the 1970s, the Front expressed opposition to the UK's welfare state as it then existed, instead promoting a self-help ideology. It stated that it would end perceptions of the UK as a \\"loafer's paradise\\" by ensuring that all those capable of working do so rather than subsisting on unemployment benefits. It stated that a rudimentary welfare state should nevertheless exist in order to provide support for the \\"very young, very old, the sick and the disabled\\". Since its early years, the NF promoted a tough stance on law and order, calling for harsher sentences for criminals, tougher prisons, and the reintroduction of capital punishment. It rejected the idea that an individual's misdeeds should be attributed to their societal background, placing an emphasis on self-responsibility. The party focused on crimes committed by black people and migrants, and linked racially integrated schools with crime, saying that \\"every white parent whose children attend racially integrated schools\\" would be aware of \\"negro crime ... Rapes, muggings, and even murder\\". Webster made connections with crime statistics regarding the African-American community in the United States. These, Webster argued, showed that \\"adult negroids fall below other races in acceptable behaviour\\", lamenting that \\"the criminal Blacks cannot help themselves\\". It also called for the scrapping of the Race Relations Act 1965, arguing that individuals should have the legal right to racially discriminate against others. In the 1970s the party also called for the reintroduction of national service.

Opened by Mar√≠a del Carmen Tobar, it originally was a bar and billiards room but expanded to have a dance hall. The bar attracted women from a wide variety of backgrounds including non-lesbian women. In the early years of the Spanish democratic transition the bar was accepted because its owner was well connected in the local government through Daniela her band-mate. The police still occasionally raided the bar, however, during its early years. Tobar played an active role in making Daniel's the center of lesbian life in Barcelona, sponsoring sports teams and a theater group. The bar also sold feminist literature, including the magazine call Red de Amazonas. The bar later closed, but would be remembered in books and exhibits for its importance in the lesbian history of Spain.  History  Daniel's was one of the first lesbian bars in Spain and one of the first LGBTQ bars in Barcelona. It was located at Plaza de Cardona 7‚Äì8, in the Sant Gervasi neighborhood. Daniel's was opened in 1975 by Mar√≠a del Carmen Tobar (born in 1943 in Barcelona), shortly after Franco's death. It was named after a musical group, Daniela, which Tobar had founded with Teresa and Gisele.Llamas, R., & Vila, F. (1997). Spain: Passion for Life. Una historia del movimiento de lesbianas y gays en el Estado espa√±ol. Conciencia de un singular deseo, 189-224. The bar was originally opened as a non-profit association to avoid the high tax rate. For this reason, patrons had to ring a bell outside to gain entrance, and were only admitted if they were known to Tobar herself. The original bar consisted of a small bar downstairs which served drinks, and a staircase leading up to a second floor room, which held a billiards table and had benches lining the walls. The bar was decorated with an English pub motif and had many mirrors, red velvet and dim lighting. Within a few years of it opening, Tobar acquired a room adjacent to the bar that served as a dance hall. As Daniel's was the only women's bar in the city, the bar attracted a large range of female clientele from around Barcelona and the region, including non-lesbian clientele. Among the numerous patrons were housewives, high school and university-aged girls, lesbian prostitutes, famous Spanish celebrities and more. The music of Mari Trini was frequently playing in the bar's early days, and Tobar hired Maria Giralt, a prominent LGBTQ activist from Barcelona, as the bar's DJ. Maria Giralt worked at Daniel's for a period of ten months. Because lesbian and homosexual activity were still not technically legal when the bar was opened, it had a red light above the dance floor to warn of imminent police raids. When the light illuminated, the patrons would stop dancing and sit with board games and cards to appear inconspicuous. While these women were not at a high risk of being arrested due to the 1970 Law on dangerousness and social rehabilitation's targeting of gay men, the families of these women often sent them to psychiatric facilities because of their sexuality. This was sometimes viewed as even worse than jail. The bar was raided by police several times in its first few years of operation, though their justifications for raiding were always vague. They'd claim the need to ensure that the bar and its patrons were obeying good manners and displaying good morals, language akin to that of the 1970 law. Tobar was keen to support lesbians and women not just through nightlife, but also throughout daily life. Consequently, the bar sponsored women's soccer teams, basketball teams and a theater group, Five Stars & the Comet. The theater group met in the dance hall at Daniel's, and performed an improv show called ‚ÄúSala de espera.\\" Daniel's was one of the few places in Spain to sell the Spanish feminist magazine called Laberint, later renamed Red de Amazonas. Daniel's was an important focal point, providing social cohesion to the emerging lesbian community in the post-Francoist era. The bar no longer exists. Tobar passed away in 2009. However, her bar lives on in legacy and was featured at an exhibition in early 2013 at Ateneo de Madrid titled Women under suspicion. Memory and sexuality (1930-1980).  References in Culture  Daniel's was referenced in a volume of essays by Uruguayan writer Peri Rossi called Fatas√≠as Er√≥ticas in which two Italian women enter Daniel's bar after passing the scrutiny of its very protective owner, Maria del Carmen Tobar. It was also mentioned in a book published in 2019 called Barcelona Feminista 1975-1988. In 2016 the legacy of the now closed bar was featured in a YouTube video posted on the Travelqueers channel, in which women were interviewed about the history of the bar, their sentiments about its closure and how it has survived in memory and culture.

The statewide laws and policies identified as beneficial for LGBTQ populations are hate crime laws, a non- discrimination law specific to college and universities, non-discrimination policy for state employees on the basis of sexual orientation, an anti-cyber bullying law, transgender inclusion in sports, and changes for name and gender marker on drivers licenses. St. Louis City Ordinance No. 67119 extends the city anti-discrimination policy to protect individuals on the basis of gender identity and sexuality. The Civil Rights Enforcement Agency (CREA) is responsible for processing claims. St. Louis County also has anti- discrimination protections for LGBT residents. In 2017, a sergeant in St. Louis County Police Department filed an EEOC discrimination lawsuit alleging that he was told to \\"tone down your gayness\\" in order to be eligible for promotion. Shortly thereafter he was transferred to another precinct and assigned to night shift. St. Louis County argued against the case on the basis that discrimination against sexual minorities is not illegal in Missouri. The officer agreed to a $10.25 million settlement in 2020.  History  = pre-1950 = Prior to European colonization, the region was inhabited by members of the Mississippian, Illini, Missouria, and Osage peoples. Understandings of gender and sexuality differ among indigenous cultures. While much ancestral knowledge has been lost through colonization and forced assimilation, it is known that the Osage recognized Mixu'ga, one of the identities under the modern two-spirit umbrella.Pruden, Harlan and Edmo, Se- ah-dom. \\"Two-Spirit People: Sex, Gender & Sexuality in Historic and Contemporary America.\\" National Congress of American Indians. http://www.ncai.org/policy-research-center/initiatives/Pruden- Edmo_TwoSpiritPeople.pdf Despite the Indian Removal Act and other attempts to displace indigenous people, members of the Osage nation continue to reside in the area and are working to preserve Sugarloaf Mound. A St. Louis medical textbook publisher released The Story of a Life, the first recognized American homosexual autobiography in 1901. The author, using the pseudonym Claude Hartland, wrote about his mental health and experiences with doctors related to sexuality and gender identity as well as descriptions of homosexual social life in downtown St. Louis. = 1950-1960s = In the late 1950s, a competition for \\"female impersonators\\" called Miss Fannie's Ball was organized by the Jolly Jesters social club, with proceeds going to St. Louis African American institutions. The event is a continuing annual Halloween night celebration that has been hosted at various venues, including Masonic Prince Hall Grand Lodge and Chase Park Plaza. During the Halloween festivities of 1969, nine young people were arrested without explanation while leaving the Onyx Room, one of the most popular gay bars of the time. At the station they were charged for \\"masquerading\\" (i.e. appearing publicly in women's clothing). Dressing in clothing not in accordance with one's perceived sex had been prohibited by a municipal ordinance since 1864. Arrests at LGBT establishments were common, but the events of that Halloween ignited the first recorded protest by gay activists in St. Louis. The Mandrake Society, the first gay rights group of St. Louis, mobilized the community. They spread news of the arrests by phone to gather supporters at police headquarters, assisted with bail, and hired legal representation. The charges were eventually dropped, marking a significant victory for St. Louis gay rights activists. The 1969 Halloween arrests are sometimes referred to as \\"St. Louis' Stonewall\\" because of its importance as a flash-point of community resistance and organization. In 1968, Laud Humphreys presented his research on male-male sexual activities in public restrooms in Forest Park, later published as the controversial Tearoom Trade. = 1970-1980s = Places known to be gathering sites for lesbians, including a bar and coffeehouse in south city, were firebombed in the 1970s. In 1972, Goldstein Johnson challenged the city's masquerading law with support from the ACLU of Missouri. Johnson had been arrested twice and served 45 days at the city workhouse for wearing women's clothes. Johnson was murdered before a decision could be made. More than 200 masquerading arrests were made from 1970 up to when the law was successfully overturned in 1986. Various pride marches and demonstrations were organized throughout the 1970s. Chuck Charleston, a bartender at Red Bull in East St. Louis, organized a procession of cars that ended in a large gathering in Forest Park in 1971. Student organizations held celebrations and hosted nationally known activists at Washington University and Southern Illinois University Edwardsville. Metropolitan Community Church in St. Louis was established in 1972 with a mission to serve the gay and lesbian community. The church served as a center for organizing and hosted a gay pride rally in 1977. The first city sanctioned Celebration of Lesbian and Gay Pride occurred April 12‚Äì20, 1980, with a full week of activities, ending with the landmark Walk for Charity and Rally. Sponsors included community and ally businesses as well as religious organizations. Some participants used pseudonyms or wore disguises in fear of reprisal. St. Louis Effort for AIDS was established by volunteers in 1985, raising money to support people affected by HIV/AIDS through Dining Out For Life and drag shows. In 1989, the organization Blacks Assisting Blacks Against AIDS (BABAA) was established to educate the St. Louis African American community about HIV/AIDS. They later found a physical office and did educational outreach, including distributing condoms at clubs. = 1990-2000s = In 1990, the St. Louis Gender Foundation began public outreach, including HIV/AIDS education and a booth at Pride. They had previously met privately as Tri-Ess or the Gateway Femmes. University of Missouri‚ÄìSt. Louis was among the first to recognize LGBT History Month, founded by graduate student Rodney Wilson in 1994. In 1995, BABAA and other African American community members organized B-Boy Blues Festival, and in 1999 established the annual St. Louis Black Pride.  Gayborhoods  = Historical = St. Louis's gayborhoods have a rocky history at best. In the mid-twentieth century, gay neighborhoods were shaped by redlining and white flight. Due to discriminatory practices and social marginalization, white gay establishments emerged in the liminal spaces between predominately white and predominately black neighborhoods. Laud Humphreys described such areas as \\"gay ghettos\\" where black neighborhoods provided the protection of anonymity to white gay men. Black gays and lesbians lacked such privilege and also faced discrimination from their white counterparts that often limited their socializing to private parties. For all LGBTQ St. Louisans then, employment and housing discrimination often excluded them from the suburbs or affluent neighborhoods.  Midtown  This neighborhood includes the former entertainment district known as Gaslight Square. From the 1930s to the 1970s, Grand and Olive was the most continuously popular part of the city for lesbian and gay establishments. Among them was Dante's Inferno, one of the oldest identified gay bars in St. Louis, notorious for hosting drag shows. The gay bars were in close proximity to Black residential neighborhoods, however many businesses refused to serve black clientele. The bar Zebra marketed itself as a multiracial space, \\"a beautiful blend of black and white.\\" This area was also the site of the Onyx Room police raid.  Central West End  During the 1950s-1970s the Central West End also became a hub for LGBT nightlife and came to be known as St. Louis's original gayborhood. In 1969 the Mandrake Society was founded in the Central West End. They, and other homophile organizations, often met at Trinity Episcopal Church in the early 70s. \\"The Center,\\" operated by the Metropolitan Life Services Corporation, was located at 4940 McPherson Avenue and hosted a library, community meetings, and counseling services from 1976-1978. The vegetarian cafe collective Sunshine Inn operated in the neighborhood 1972-1998 and hosted the 1987 national meeting for National Coalition of Black Lesbians and Gays. From the 1970s through the 1990s, however, the Central West End was subject to gentrification. As a result, members of the LGBT community moved away from the area and many LGBT establishments were forced to close. Coffee Cartel was closely aligned with the community and frequent sponsor of LGBT events until its closure in 2018. LGBT-owned Left Bank Books has been located on Euclid Avenue since 1969.  North St. Louis  Northside establishments primarily catering to black gays and lesbians included 1960s Bills Bar and Grill, which was a critical venue for Ethel Sawyer's sociology masters thesis, ‚ÄúA Study of a Public Lesbian Community.‚Äù = Present-day =  The Grove  Between the 1990s and 2010s, the Grove, in Forest Park Southeast, became the \\"heir apparent\\" to the Central West End's LGBT club scene. Although the Grove remains the most high-profile gayborhood in St. Louis, the rise of mainstream venues and other markers of gentrification have raised alarms among the LGBTQ community that the history of the Central West End may be repeating itself. In addition to gay bars, the Pride Center and Transgender Memorial Garden are located in the neighborhood.  Tower Grove  The neighborhoods around Tower Grove Park have long been a popular area for LGBT residents. The organizing group of the 1980 pride activities was the Magnolia Committee, named after Magnolia Street on the north side of the park. In addition to the annual Tower Grove Pride festivities, many LGBT businesses line the street on South Grand.  Soulard  Until 2014, the longest operating gay bar in St. Louis, Clementines, was located in Soulard. Clementines was one of several gay bars to be established in Soulard in the 1970s and 1980s when many buildings in the neighborhood were abandoned and property values were low. Many bars in the area are gay friendly and host drag shows. The St. Louis Metropolitan Community Church is also in Soulard.  Carondelet  Several gay bars line South Broadway in the Carondelet neighborhood. It is also the original home of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet who were early advocates for LGBT inclusion and continue to actively support the transgender community. Metro East The former glory of the East St. Louis nightclub scene included bars that catered to LGBTQ clientele, including an active ballroom and drag scene. New bars and social institutions have since been established, and a small community is growing in Alton, Illinois. The first Alton Pride Fall Festival is to occur October 2020.

Farahany poses the question: what value should be placed on the thoughts in our head and what rights should humans have to be able to decide when, if ever, those thoughts are shared. The implications behind technology that can read thoughts are already being realized in China where some workers are required to wear EEG machines under their hats in order to collect information on that worker's productivity, focus, and mood.

While there, he was surprised at the mark-ups that were charged for the price of the products, versus the real cost to produce the products.Brandon Truaxe: the man who will change the way you buy beauty, Evening Standard, 4 May 2017 Truaxe founded software development firm, Schematte Corporation, and nutritional supplements company, Organic Senses Ltd. Both companies were dissolved in 2007 and 2008 for failure to file annual returns. In 2003, Truaxe founded his first skin care brand Euoko with partner Julio Torres, supported by Pasquale Cusano, a Vancouver jeweler, who served as his mentor and investor.Jamie Rosen: The Mix Master, W Magazine, 1 April 2008 Brandon resigned from the company in 2011. In 2012 he launched Indeed Labs, which includes the Nanoblur collection. Truaxe later left Indeed Labs to found Deciem.How to launch a fast-growing cosmetics company, Cosmetics Business, 17 June 2016  DECIEM  In 2012, Truaxe founded DECIEM The Abnormal Beauty Company. DECIEM functioned as an umbrella company for more than 10 other brands. In April 2013, DECIEM debuted its first brand, Inhibitif, followed by The Chemistry Brand, Fountain and Grow Gorgeous. During the period of his non-compete clauses, he created the anti-aging hand cream for The Chemistry Brand. It was an instant bestseller when it launched, partly because people were using it on their faces - Truaxe had \\"thrown down the gauntlet\\". DECIEM's multi-brand strategy was driven by a vertically integrated structure: It had its own laboratory, in-house manufacturing, in-house e-commerce, in-store stores, and proprietary marketing infrastructure. In August 2016, Truaxe launched DECIEM's The Ordinary product line with twenty- seven products, combining cutting-edge science with modest price points. He was realising his mission to \\"democratise serious skincare\\". It first sold exclusively online, then in various department stores, and about 30 company- owned stores it opened in Canada, the US, the UK, Mexico, South Korea and the Netherlands. In June 2017 Truaxe's success attracted the attention of leading beauty conglomerate Est√©e Lauder Companies (ELC), which acquired an equity ownership of 28% (one-third equal partner) in DECIEM for $50 million. At the time, Truaxe released a statement praising ELC for embracing ‚Ä≥our margins, our pricing strategy, our future plans (and) our disruptiveness‚Ä≥.Brandon Truaxe, controversial founder of Toronto-based beauty brand DECIEM, has died, The Star, 21 January 2019 His decision was driven by the fact that the company simply could not keep up with the consumer demand for their products. In late 2018, DECIEM was in 42 stores worldwide and sold more than one product every second.Deciem and Indeed Labs lead tributes to founder Brandon Truaxe, who died aged 40, Cosmetics Business, 21 January 2019 2016 Truaxe received, among others awards, the Luxury Briefing Award (ideas and excellence across the luxury industry) in the ‚ÄúInnovation in Beauty‚Äù category.

Under his leadership, annual revenue was headed to $300 million in sales, with plans to quickly quintuple in size in 2019.  Controversy  In early 2018, Truaxe was accused of erratic behavior. His employee, Nicola Kilner Reddington stated that \\"Before 2018, he barely even drank alcohol,\\" responding to reports that he was ingesting psychedelic mushrooms in front of employees, convinced of their creative and spiritual benefits. According to an interview with the Financial Post, Truaxe took crystal meth in Britain, leading to an arrest and treatment. In October 2018, ELC sought legal action after Truaxe ordered all of Deciem's operations to close with immediate effect due to \\"financial crimes\\". Truaxe was ousted as CEO, and Nicola Kilner Reddington was appointed as the sole CEO. A few days later, a restraining order was issued against Truaxe after he had sent emails to ELC chair emeritus Leonard Lauder and other executives. Andrew Ross, executive vice president of strategy and new business development at ELC, and Pasquale Cusano, the Vancouver jeweller, were now the company's only board members. ELC's injunction also led to the appointment of Pricewaterhouse Coopers to investigate, and report to the board, the alleged financial crimes.Deciem Founder Brandon Truaxe Has Been Ousted, Women's Wear Daily, 12 October 2018 Only a few months later, Truaxe died at age 40.

She served as co-Editor- in-Chief from its inception until 2017, when she and partner David Hershkovits sold the company. In her column of 32 years, \\"Note From Kim,\\" Hastreiter observed and articulated cultural movements and trends that she saw forming, deciphering the transforming zeitgeist. She currently resides in Greenwich Village, New York City.  Biography  = Early life = Hastreiter was born to Gloria and Walter Hastreiter in West Orange, New Jersey. She has one sibling, Laurie. After high school she attended Washington University in St. Louis for two years and then went to Nova Scotia School of Art and Design, where she received her BFA. She then pursued an MFA from California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, CA, where she was mentored by conceptual artist John Baldessari. In 1976, Hastreiter decided to drive cross-country to New York, with performer Joey Arias, to become a conceptual artist. While working as a salesgirl in a Madison Avenue fashion boutique, she befriended photographer Bill Cunningham who helped her get her first editorial job at the SoHo Weekly News. = Career = At the SoHo Weekly News, Hastreiter served as the Style Editor, where she worked on fashion stories collaborating with artists like Robert Mapplethorpe, Keith Haring, and Kenny Scharf, among others. While working there, she met journalist David Hershkovits, who became her business partner after the SoHo Weekly News closed suddenly. Together they founded Paper Magazine in 1984, in the kitchen of her Tribeca loft. Through her work at Paper, Hastreiter became known for her creative collaborations with artists, designers, illustrators, and photographers. She was also behind several historical collaborations between creatives, connecting artists and designers such as Keith Haring and Vivienne Westwood for a collection together in the early 80s. She notably connected Target to designers through an innovative spread in the May 2002 issue of Paper, wherein she asked the following creatives to envision products that both had artful design and utilitarian functionality: Isaac Mizrahi, Isabel Toledo, Ruben Toledo, Toland Grinell, Stefan Sagmeister, Kate Spade, Andy Spade, Maira Kalman, Vladimir Kagan, Geoffrey Beene, Betsey Johnson, Bridget de Socio, Manolo Blahnik, Ingo Maurer, and Tucker Viemeister. In 2017, Hastreiter and Hershkovits sold their stake in Paper to Tom Florio[5], former chief executive of Advanstar Fashion Group, and Drew Elliot, the chief creative officer of Paper. In December of 2017, she launched her consultation firm, Kim Hastreiter OG, LLC. In addition, she now serves as an editor at the Barcelona-based design magazine, Apartamento.  Curatorial Projects  In the 90s, Hastreiter annually curated three-day 24-hour pop-up art stores in Los Angeles that she called ‚Äúcultural department stores.‚Äù In 2006, Hastreiter and Jeffrey Deitch conceptualized the first of what would be become several iterations of the 24-hour pop-ups for Art Basel Miami. In Hastreiter's words, ‚ÄúThe store is an art piece on the manic nature of consumerism. No matter what‚Äôs happening, you‚Äôve got to keep it pure to keep it good.‚Äù The store sold creative collaborations as a political statement about the blurred lines between art and commerce, and included items from names such as John Waters and Jeff Koons. Hastreiter recalls, \\"We had Eli Broad waiting in line just to get in. By the end, the place looked like it had been stripped by termites.‚Äù After a successful run in Miami, Hastreiter decided to bring the project, which she dubbed the Super Duper Market, to Los Angeles just one year later, and continued to do so for two more years. The Super Duper Market played with the concept of clashing high- and low-fashion, showcasing quality goods, from couture to streetwear. In 2008, for the fourth Super Duper Market, Hastreiter celebrated the new cultural edge of young, independent food producers around America. Some featured creatives included Rodarte, Fruition, and Undefeated. Music at the event was handled by 17 different local Los Angeles acts, including Charles Lester, Harper Simon, Lady Tigra, and Black Black.  Published works  Hastreiter has co-authored two books on style and culture with David Hershkovits, From Abfab to Zen: Paper's Guide to Pop Culture and 20 Years of Style: The World According to Paper. In 2007, she wrote a book about industrial designer, Ingo Maurer, called Provoking Magic: Lighting of Ingo Maurer, in collaboration with the Cooper-Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum. In 2010, she wrote a book on the life and work of late fashion designer, Geoffrey Beene, titled Geoffrey Beene: American Fashion Rebel. In 2016, she edited a book called @heaven, which was about death in the digital era. In 2019, Hastreiter edited and wrote the foreword for a set of four books on the work of Paige Powell, published by Dashwood Books in collaboration with Gucci. Hastreiter also wrote the foreword for Target: 20 Years of Design for All, published by Rizzoli.  Awards and distinctions  Hastreiter has received the Accessories Council Ace Award (2010), the Council of Fashion Designers of America Eugenia Shepard Award (2010), and Pratt Institute's Legend Award (2014). Hastreiter has been interviewed for three documentaries: Bill Cunningham: New York (2010), Arias with a Twist (2010), and The Universe of Keith Haring (2008). She also appeared in one episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians (Season 10 Episode 7) in 2015.

This crab lives commensally in the atrial chamber of a small ascidian (sea squirt). It is found in the tropical western Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. Taxonomy In Mary J. Rathbun's original description of this species, she placed it in the then broadly defined Pinnotheres. It remained there for most of the 20th century until Ernesto Campos, while revising the Pinnotheridae, noted that most species with a 2-segmented palp on the third maxilliped were anomalous in Pinnotheres. This led to the segregation of multiple genera, of which Tunicotheres, defined in 1996, was one. Description Members of this family are tiny, soft-bodied crabs commonly known as pea crabs. Males of this species have carapace widths of up to and females of up to . Ecology This crab has been found as an endosymbiont of several species of host tunicate including Styela plicata, Phallusia nigra, Molgula occidentalis and Polycarpa spongiabilis. Usually, a single crab occupies the atrial chamber of a single tunicate. Questing males will seek to enter tunicates that are occupied by unberried females (those not brooding eggs), but will avoid those containing males, or females carrying eggs and developing larvae. Tunicotheres moseri has a reduced developmental cycle, with the eggs and all larval stages being retained in the brood pouch of the female. The developing young finally leave the abdominal pouch and the host tunicate as first instar juveniles. The crabs are found in solitary residence in their tunicate host far more often than would be expected statistically. This seems to be due to territoriality, but does not occur because of aggression between a resident and an invading crab; the resident crab stations itself close to the atrial siphon and in most cases the intruder is deterred from attempting to enter. Additionally, the crabs seem to use an agonistic avoidance strategy and likely detect, by chemical or tactile cues, which tunicates are already occupied, moving on promptly from occupied hosts to find unoccupied ones.

She is a product of the American college soccer system. Club career As a young girl Kathellen loved football but mainly had to play futsal. She found opportunities for field soccer limited in her native Baixada Santista, especially after Santos FC's women's section was closed in 2012. Kathellen applied for an athletic scholarship to the United States and was selected by Monroe College of the National Junior College Athletic Association. After two successful years with Monroe College she spent her two remaining years of college eligibility with Louisville Cardinals and UCF Knights, respectively, in NCAA Division I. She subsequently received an offer from FC Girondins de Bordeaux and joined the French Division 1 F√©minine club halfway through their 2017‚Äì18 season. In May 2018 she signed a two-year extension to her contract. After a successful 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup with Brazil, and an elite level performance against France, Kathellen was linked to many major European clubs, including newly promoted CD Tac√≥n, due to become Real Madrid for season 2020‚Äì21. Instead she remained with Bordeaux for a further season, then joined Italian Serie A club Inter Milan in August 2020. International career Brazil women's national football team head coach Vad√£o called Kathellen up for the first time in June 2018, for a training camp ahead of the 2018 Tournament of Nations. As the tournament fell outside the FIFA International Match Calendar, some regular national team players were not released by their clubs, causing Vad√£o to consider other players. On 26 July 2018, she earned her first cap for the senior Brazil women's national team at the 2018 Tournament of Nations, appearing as a substitute for Daiane Limeira in a 3‚Äì1 defeat by Australia. A year later, Kathellen was subsequently called up by Brazil for the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup. She started the preparation camp as the main backup for the experienced pair of centre backs M√¥nica and √ârika. After √ârika was forced out of the competition by injury, Kathellen was made a regular starter. Despite being the youngest Brazilian player in the lineup for the Round of 16 game thriller against France, Kathellen delivered a major performance.

The company is headquartered in Redmond, Washington, United States, and has an engineering center in Queensland, Australia, where they were founded. History The company was founded in 2009 in Australia to research various technologies for electric motors. In 2017, it developed a motor that became their prototype and led to pivoting the company to focus on Electric Aviation and move its headquarters to Redmond, Washington. The Magni5, its original prototype electric motor, was developed in 2017. In June 2018, MagniX publicly stated plans to fly an electric Cessna 208 Caravan with a motor for up to an hour, by August 2019. By then, the company's Magni5 electric motor could produce peak at 2,500 rpm at 95% efficiency with a 53 kg (117 lb) dry mass motor, having a 5 kW/kg power density. The Magni5 competes with the , Siemens SP260D for the Extra 330LE. By September 2018, a electric motor with a propeller had been tested on a Cessna iron bird. The Caravan was expected to fly by the fall of 2019 and by 2022 MagniX estimates electric aircraft could fly up to by 2024. The motor ran on a test dynamometer for 1,000 hours. The iron bird is a Caravan forward fuselage used as a test bed, with the usual PT6 turboprop engine replaced by an electric motor, inverter and a liquid-cooling system, including radiators, driving a Cessna 206 propeller. The production motor will produce at 1,900 rpm, down from the test motor's 2,500 rpm, allowing the installation of the propeller without a reduction gearbox. By April 2019, the Magni250 375 hp (280 kW) was offered for the Eviation Alice as a second power option after Siemens 260kW motors, as MagniX had accumulated over 1,500 hours of ground tests in Redmond and Australia. By then, MagniX partnered with Harbour Air to electrify its entire fleet: the first converted aircraft was to be a DHC-2 Beaver serving as the test prototype for the magniX motor, energy storage, and control systems. On December 10, 2019, the eBeaver flew for the first time. Low energy density but proven lithium-ion batteries filled the cabin and took the prototype to its maximum gross weight to provide enough energy for a 15 min flight with a 25 min reserve. The first flight of the modified Cessna 208B Grand Caravan was completed at Grant County International Airport on May 28, 2020. The eCaravan is powered by a motor and a , 750V lithium-ion battery. Its 30 min first flight consumed $6 worth of electricity, needing 30-40 min of charging. The Magni500-powered variant can fly with 4-5 passengers while keeping reserve power, and aims for a certification by the end of 2021, hoping to operate 100-mile flights with a full load of nine passengers with better batteries.

Six games were played in Norway, but the first was played in Leipzig. The team travelled with 15 players, their trainer Kert√©sz and two functionaries. The journey started with a train ride on 2 June 1930 at quarter past seven in the morning from Basel and they arrived in Leipzig at half passed eight that evening. The game against VfB Leipzig was played the next evening. The following one and a half days were spent travelling by train, train, ship, train and train again to Drammen in Norway. Only a few hours after their arrival, the team played a game against a joint team Mj√∏ndalen IF / SBK Drafn. The next day was a train journey to Porsgrunn and two matches in 24 hours. Following that they travelled per bus and then by ship in a 48-hour journey to Bergen for a match against SK Brann. Another ship voyage, this time to Stavanger, two games against Viking FK, then a ship voyage back to Bergen. Finally, the tour ended with three train journeys in three days, Bergen/Oslo/Berlin/Basel, arriving at home on 20 June. The result of this tour was seven games, four wins, one draw, two defeats and approximately 160 hours of travelling. Ardizzoia was participant in this tour and he played in 5 of these games. Ardizzoia was a member of the Basel squad that won the Swiss Cup in the 1932‚Äì33 season. The final was played in the Hardturm stadium against Grasshopper Club. Basel won 4‚Äì3 and this was the club's first ever national title. Ardizzoia did not play in that game and ended his football playing time at the end of that season.

The film stars Robert Nolan as a man who wakes up to find that his ailing wife, laying beside him in bed, has died in the middle of night. After finally getting out of bed the husband proceeds to go about the day as if nothing has happened, systematically going through his 'to-do' list that was left on the fridge for him by his wife. As the husband attempts to complete the tasks, his interactions with various people and things along the way become increasingly aggressive, often in a darkly funny manner. As he completes his list it becomes very clear that he is not coping with the loss of his wife very well at all, becoming emotionally unhinged, resulting in him taking his own life at the end. The film premiered at the 2013 Calgary International Film Festival. The US premiere was at the 2013 Anchorage International Film Festival where it won the Audience Choice Award. The film was released theatrically in Canada on January 24, 2014 by Indiecan Entertainment.
