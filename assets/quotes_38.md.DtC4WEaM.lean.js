It was built in 1927. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 3 June 2005.  History  The Nanango Butter Factory, bounded by George Street and Sandy Creek, Nanango, is closely linked to the development of the Nanango district, as well as the rise and fall of the dairy industry in Queensland. The original factory, made of timber, was built in 1905. The current factory, of concrete and brick construction, was erected in 1927, extended to the north in 1953, and retains a number of its outbuildings and structures. These include loading bays, concrete tanks, sheds, and an office building. The South Burnett district was first settled by Europeans in the early 1840s, as pastoralists worked their way north from the Darling Downs. By 1842 the sheep station Taromeo had been established by Simon Scott. Two other sheep stations were established shortly thereafter: Nanango, by William Elliot Oliver, and Tarong, by John Borthwick. Taromeo, Nanango and Tarong had all switched to beef cattle by the 1880s. Oliver's Head Station was at a creek two miles west of the site of the town of Nanango. The latter grew around an inn established by Jacob Goode in 1848, after he was allowed to camp near a waterhole on Nanango Station. The tracks from the Darling Downs and Brisbane converged at Goode's Inn on their way to Gayndah. Nanango is one of Queensland's oldest towns. A post office was established at Goode's Inn in 1850, and in 1857 Nanango was gazetted for Courts of Petty Session, with a Courthouse being built in 1859. In 1861 the town of Nanango was surveyed, and the first sale of town blocks occurred in 1862, between today's Henry, Appin, George and Alfred Streets. James Nash found gold seven miles southeast of Inn in 1866, and the \\"Seven Mile Diggings\\" helped to increase the population of the area. Closer settlement began after an 1875 petition, and in 1876 regulations were for drawn up for monthly land courts, the first of which occurred in Nanango in 1877. In 1879 the Barambah Divisional Board was formed, and its office was built in Nanango in 1883. The 1884 Agricultural Lands Purchase Act aided in the resumption of part of Nanango Station for selection by farmers, who produced wheat and butter for the local market. Timber getting was also an industry in the area. Initially, local farmers kept a few cows for domestic purposes, and town dwellers paid a fee to have a house cow that could be grazed on the town common. The first commercial dairy farm was started near Nanango in 1865, but this was a small operation that had to cart its cream overland to Gympie. By the 1890s events were occurring that would lead to the rapid growth of commercial dairy farming around Nanango, such as the advent of mechanical cream separators in Australia in the 1880s; the Babcock butterfat test; government grading of butter; and the advent of refrigerated shipping from Brisbane in 1884. In the late 1880s and early 1890s the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock used a Travelling Dairy to demonstrate techniques and equipment to potential dairy farmers. The 1893 Meat and Dairy Produce Act, which established subsidies for dairy farmers, and the 1894 Agricultural Lands Purchase Act also aided commercial dairying. Between 1894 and 1919 a large amount of land was repurchased by the Queensland Government from pastoralists, was and offered as agricultural selections. Closer settlement legislation between 1906 and 1917 also played its part in creating small agricultural service towns, as did the spread of Queensland's railway network. In 1890 there were of rail-line in Queensland. By 1910 there was and by 1920, . Between 1910 and 1920, most of the lines built were branch lines for agriculture. The Co-operative movement, where producers held shares in the enterprises that processed and sold their product, had been developed in Switzerland during the 1880s, and was transferred from Victoria to Queensland by dairy immigrants during the 1890s and the first decade of the twentieth century. In 1900 the South Burnett carried of crops, 7000 sheep, and 84,000 cattle. Dairying became a mainstay of the Nanango district between 1900 and 1914, the period of the industry's most rapid development. In 1903, the year that the Shire of Nanango was formed, the railway line reached Wondai. In December of that year a thrice-weekly cream van run from Kunioon to the railhead was organised by Mr William Selby. Four farmers from Booie had begun carting their cream to Wondai earlier that year. From Wondai, the cream travelled by train to Gympie. In 1904 meetings were called at Nanango to consider a Co-operative butter factory, and in July 1904 the Nanango Co-operative Dairy Company was formed. The company was floated in February 1905, and in October a tender to build the factory was allocated to Waugh and Josephson. A single story timber factory was built in late 1905 for (a second story was later added in September 1907). Machinery and plant cost a further . The first Annual General Meeting of the Co-operative was held in February 1906, and 1565 shares were allotted to 152 shareholders, 115 of those being fully paid up. Butter manufacture commenced in April 1906, and by November the factory was also supplying ice. By 1906 the railway was moving closer to Nanango, and the first consignment of three tonnes of butter was dispatched from the Kingaroy railhead (1904). Nanango butter soon developed a reputation for excellence; in June 1906 the factory's product won first prize at the Maryborough show. Catalysts for dairying occurring around this time included the 1904 and 1905 Dairy Produce Acts; a cream testing certificate for officers in butter factories, introduced in 1906; and the 1906 Closer settlement Act. By 1910 there were 100 suppliers for the Nanango factory, which produced of butter. In 1911 the railway reached Nanango from the north, and in 1913 it reached Yarraman from the south. On 25 October 1918, a fire started by lightning destroyed the factory, which was re-opened on 15 December 1919. By 1920, there were 5,000 sheep in the South Burnett compared to 230,000 beef and dairy cattle, with 10,000 pigs and of crops. The Cactoblastis cactorum insect was introduced in 1923, and its defeat of the prickly pear enabled the Queensland dairy industry to rebuild and expand during the late 1920s, leading to the 1930s dairy boom. Also during the 1920s Butter and Cheese Boards were formed to equalise market prices, and the Nanango Co- operative Dairy Company became the Nanango Co-operative Dairy Association in 1924. By 1925 there were 320 suppliers to the factory. On 13 October 1926 the factory burned once more, shortly after an equipment upgrade, and it was re- built in concrete at a cost of about . The Minister for Works, Michael J. Kirwan, officially opened the factory on 21 October 1927. In October 1929 a Mr W.G. Counsel of the Electric Supply Works, Warwick, recommended that the butter factory supply electricity to the town, using its engine to power a generator. Electricity was supplied from the factory to the Nanango Shire Council between March 1933 and March 1948. By the 1930s, dairying was the most widely spread agricultural industry in Queensland, and it was the state's second most profitable export industry from 1936 to 1941. In 1938 there were five co-operative butter factories in the South Burnett: Nanango (since 1906), Kingaroy Butter Factory (1907), South Burnett Co-operative Dairy Association Factory (Murgon, 1911), Wondai (1931), and Proston (1935). In 1940 the factory at Nanango peaked at 483 suppliers. A cheese factory was established during World War II to feed the troops, but it only operated between January 1942 and November 1943. The building still stands to the north of the butter factory. In the 1947-48 financial year of butter was produced at the Nanango factory, and in 1948 the Nanango Dairy Co-operative Trading Society as created as a subsidiary of the Nanango Co-operative Dairy Association. By 1950 the South Burnett was carrying 650 sheep, 130,000 dairy cows (ten percent of the Queensland total), 110,000 beef cattle, 70,000 pigs, and of crops. However, as demand and prices for butter dropped in the 1950s, the decline of dairying accelerated. In 1953 the Nanango butter factory started producing butter milk powder, and a brick annex was added to the northern end of the factory to house the roller-drying plant. Butter consumption per capita in Australia dropped from to between 1957 and 1972, and Britain joining the European Economic Community provided another blow to prices. Irregular seasonal conditions and a lack of profits led many dairy farmers to drop out of the industry, and by 1975 the factory had 66 suppliers left. 1977 witnessed the end of the butter and cheese price equalisation scheme, and in May of that year butter production ended at Nanango. The factory continued to act as a depot for bulk milk tanker collections, which had begun in 1972. When the Nanango Dairy Co-operative Association closed the factory in 1986 only 37 milk suppliers remained. The railway line that used to run alongside the western side of the factory has disappeared, as has a large water cooler that stood to the northeast of the factory. A 1929 Ruston Hornsby Model 9XHC 132 horsepower diesel engine, with a seven-foot flywheel, and a 1935 Ruston Hornsby Model VER 220 horsepower diesel of , remained on site until June 2004. These engines would have been used to run the factory's machinery, as well as to generate electricity for Nanango. A gas fitting business currently occupies the northern extension of the main factory building, and a plumber uses the southern end. To the south of the factory the old office building, of late 1920s construction, is now a residence/home business.  Description  The main factory building is two stories high, rectangular, and runs parallel to George Street, on a north-south axis. It is constructed of concrete, with a brick extension to the north, and has fibrous cement sheeting and battens on the upper levels to the north and south. It has a gabled roof of galvanised iron with skylights, and a clerestory runs along the apex of the southern part of the roof. The western side of the building facing George Street has been stuccoed. There are four doors, a high-set roller door, and two hatches on the western side of the factory, five roller doors on the south side, and a roller door on the north side. There is a high-set loading bay with roller door on the southern end of the east side, and a concrete loading dock juts out between this and the engine room to the north. Windows are generally steel- framed with wire-covered panes, or consist of panelled glass louvres. Internally the factory is divided into two main sections with concrete floors, and the smaller northern end currently contains an office facing George Street, with a larger open section behind. The southern end has a small office on a raised section facing George Street, and a large open area behind this, with a coldroom and storeroom on the George Street side, north of the office. A door on the east side of the southern section leads from the main space through to the engine room. On the east side of the factory is an attached single-story engine room, with gabled roof of galvanised iron, constructed of rendered brick, with metal strapping set into the render. Steel loops are welded to the strapping at intervals. The engine room has a smaller northern section, with a roller door exiting the north side, and a double steel door exits the southern section to the east. The engine room has a concrete floor, and contains the concrete mounting pads of removed equipment, and one small engine. A hole has recently been cut into the floor of the engine room, near the largest concrete mounting. South of the factory, across a large concrete pad, is the old office building of the Nanango Dairy Co-operative Association. It faces George Street, and is constructed of brick with a concrete and stucco frontage. To the east of the concrete pad are two open sheds of steel and timber construction, and an enclosed timber shed. To the east of the factory and engine room are a number of other structures. Running south to north these include: a small overgrown shed, related to the factory's cooling system; a rectangular semi-underground covered concrete tank; a brick toilet block; two underground concrete tanks next to the engine room; a small open-topped semi- underground concrete water tank; and an open two-storied twin-gabled loading bay, constructed of steel and timber and clad in galvanised iron. It has raised vents at each apex, clad in curved galvanised iron sheeting.  Heritage listing  Nanango Butter Factory Building was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 3 June 2005 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The 1927 Nanango butter factory, built on a site that was used for butter production from 1906 to 1977, is evidence of the growth and decline of the dairy industry within the Nanango Shire, and within Queensland. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The decline in the Queensland dairy industry in the 1960s and 1970s, and the resulting closure of small town butter factories, means that ex-butter factories that are relatively intact are now becoming uncommon. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The layout of the factory, with its large internal space, loading bays, cold room, engine room, exterior water tanks, office building and other secondary structures demonstrates the principle characteristics of an early twentieth century butter factory.

History The first Balochi feature film, Hammal-o-Mahganj, was produced by Anwar Iqbal and released in Pakistan in 1976. However, the film never made it to the screen amidst protests by cultural activists who alleged it misrepresented Baloch culture. A slogan used by the protest movement was \\"Balochi film chalay ga tou cinema jalay ga\\" (If Balochi films are screened, cinemas will be burnt). Analysts believe the film's release became politicised, as PPP activists favoured the film while Baloch nationalist groups opposed it. Iqbal later arranged a private screening of the film to address the reservations, where Sindh's labour minister-cum-PPP leader Abdullah Baloch was a key attendee. According to The News, those who viewed it \\"agreed that the film did not have anything that went against the Baloch culture\\". The declining quality of erstwhile Punjabi and Pashto cinema reportedly contributed to the Baloch activists' sentiments. This is believed to have dented the Balochi film industry's initial growth. In 1989, the Iranian film Dadshah was released in Balochi dubbing. The film was based on Mir Dad Shah of Iranian Balochistan. In the subsequent years, cinema growth in Balochistan remained slow in line with the stagnant growth of Pakistan's film industry. An uncertain security situation further led to nearly half of Quetta's cinema houses facing closure by 2010. The availability of films via Blu-rays, DVDs, VCRs and cable networks has also hampered the cinema-going trend. Re-emergence In recent years, a younger generation of Baloch filmmakers has emerged in Balochistan and Karachi, as part of the new wave of Pakistani cinema. This phase has witnessed the production of quality short films as well as documentaries focusing on social and political issues, such as Ich Gushgi Nahe (Keep Silent) in 2007. In 2013, The Line of Freedom, a short film based on Balochistan's human rights situation, was produced by Noordin Mengal, Bhawal Mengal and David Whitney, starring British and Baloch actors. In 2014, the Lyari Film Festival was held in Karachi's Lyari neighbourhood, which is famous for its Baloch community. Several Balochi short films were screened at the event. The Nosach Films Academy, which organised the event, provides support to Balochi filmmakers in Lyari. In 2016, Ahsan Shah's Jaawar (Ongoing Situation), which focuses on the Lyari gang war, won the first prize at Bahrain's International Youth Creativity Awards. The same year, Sawaad (Ocean) was screened at the Lok Virsa Museum in Islamabad. An upcoming filmmaker is Haneef Shareef, who has directed popular hits such as Balaach, Manzil, Mani Pethaa Braath Nesth and Kareem from 2009 to 2014. Other recent Balochi films include Jageen, Ganjen Gwadar, Rahdarbar, Aadenk, Zoorak, Betach, Drandeh, Karwaan, Hankain, Maath, Bemuraad, Begowaah, Pendok 2 and Showanag. Balochistan has served as a filming location or subject of portrayal in multiple Urdu films, television serials and documentaries. There have also been foreign documentaries made on the region. As of 2002, there were 8 main theatres in Quetta and a few in Makran, Sibi, Kalat and Zhob. Quetta's 3D Weplex Pak Force Cinema, opened in 2016, currently features the largest curved screen in Pakistan. Other popular single-screen cinemas in the city are Paradise, Imdad and Delight. In Iran, Balochi theatre is in its infancy stage and is concentrated mainly in Zahedan, Iranshahr, and Khash. As of 2008, Zahedan-based Honorkadeh Saba was the sole cultural institution promoting Balochi cinema and theatre.

It is now undergoing rehabilitation through the efforts of the city government. The whole property on which it stands has been renamed as the Dominican Heritage Hill and Nature Park. A panoramic view of the city unfolds from its vantage point, the stone crucifix on the outdoor patio of the hotel's second floor. History =Dominican vacation house= In 1911, American friars of the Order of Preachers (commonly known as \\"Dominican Order\\") along with a few Spanish members made plans for the construction of a vacation house for them and the nuns of their order in Baguio. One of the members of the order, Fr. Roque Rua√±o, O.P., the same architect of the main building of the current campus of the University of Santo Tomas, designed the building. A 17-hectare hill property was acquired from Americans who reside in Baguio and construction is said to have started in 1913 and was supervised by Ruano himself. It was then inaugurated in May 1915. To take advantage of tax exemptions, the order set up a seminary named Colegio del Santissimo Rosario on June 1915 but due to the very small enrollment, the school closed two years later and the building was reverted to its original use. The hill where the building stands was christened as \\"Dominican Hill\\". During World War II, the people fleeing from the Japanese sought refuge within its walls. Japanese forces invaded the property and turned it into their headquarters, making it as the last bastion and garrison of the Japanese Imperial Army. Their secret police known as the Kempeitai, committed barbaric acts in the place such as torturing, raping, and decapitating priests, nuns, as well as refugees. During the liberation of the Philippines in April 1945, the American forces bombed the place and partially hit the right wing of the building while Japanese forces committed suicide. Between 1945-1947, the building underwent restoration. =As a hotel= One of the corridors of the Dominican Hill Retreat House. The former hotel's fountain can be seen in the far left. Diplomat Hotels, Inc. acquired ownership of the property in 1973 and remodeled thoroughly the interior into a 33-bedroom hotel but still retaining the unique features which was earlier established by the Dominican friars. The hotel was managed by Antonio Agapito \\"Tony\\" Agpaoa, a Baguio-based entrepreneur and faith healer famous for psychic surgery. Agpaoa suffered a heart attack and was diagnosed with brain hemorrhage in the 1980s. He died in 1987 of the ailments. Since his death, the hotel ceased operations and was abandoned. Following its abandonment, the place was looted and sacked. The building also sustained significant damage during the 1990 Luzon earthquake. Recent use NHCP Marker of the Diplomat Hotel The Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council, formerly known as the Ministry of Human Settlements, took over the ownership of the hotel. The Presidential Management Staff (PMS) came next. The hill is currently named as Dominican Heritage Hill and Nature Park. The PMS stated that the property was conveyed to City Government of Baguio and was declared a National Historical Site through TCT No. T-85948 in 5 April 2005. The Deed of Conveyance and City Resolutions provided for the rehabilitation of the old building and the development of the property into a park by obligating the city. It is now under the maintenance of the City Environment and Parks Management Office (CEPMO). In May 2012, Baguio inaugurated two new function halls in the hotel as part of the development of Baguio Dominican Heritage Hill and Nature Park as a preserved heritage site and to promote tourism. The halls could be rented for P200 an hour or P2,000 a day for weddings, trainings and workshops among others. The entire property was declared as a historical site through City Resolution No. 168, series of 2013. The city would next seek its declaration by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines as a National Historical Site. Today, the place is a favorite spot for photography, airsoft tournaments, film making, wedding receptions and photography, cosplay photoshoots and many more.

A frequent inhabitant of the intertidal zone also seen attached to wharf piles, it is among the larger sea-stars found in New Zealand. Adults often pray on mussels, forcing the shells open by applying pressure for long periods with the tube feet.  Description  With a diameter of up to 350mm in subtidal forms, the colouration of A. scabra varies from orange through dark red to brown, or light blue to grey. The dorsal surface is covered in speckled plates, from the center of which protrude one or two short, stubby white spines which are specialised ossicles. These spines are blunt on top, becoming sharper and sometimes longer on the sides of the arms. Spines can appear blue in juveniles. The madreporite is not obvious. Tube feet are a combination of off-white and bright orange. Intertidal individuals are generally smaller with thicker dermal plates, allowing them greater protection when being tossed about by waves. Despite this they are still found to be more damaged than subtidal individuals.Town, John C.

Therefore migratory and resident A. scabra in a location all result from random movement. Juveniles are more adventurous than adults in the coastal intertidal - they show considerable movement patterns within the intertidal and shallow sublittoral zones, not venturing beyond 20m in depth.Town, John, C. 1980.  Breeding  Sexual maturity is achieved when there is a decrease in overall ossicle (endoskeleton) thickness with a simultaneous radial increase to at least 110mm. A. scabra can undergo both sexual and asexual (fissiparous) processes of reproduction. Environmental influences induce gametogenesis and gamete maturation, with water temperature a major factor. Offspring disperse through the means of larval transport or epiplanktontic drift (drift occurring between the surface and 100m in depth). This free dispersal reduces local intraspecific competition as local currents carry gametes away from the spawn site. Spawning occurs throughout late August and early September, or when plankton richness is at a local maximum. Larvae are planktotropic.Town, John, C. 1980.  Diet  For A. scabra, individual size relates to diet composition (larger predators eat larger prey). J. C. Town (1981) found a population feeding on species of 60 different genera.Town, John C. (1981). \\"Prey characteristics and dietary composition in intertidal Astrostole scabra (Echinodermata: Asteroidea)\\". New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research. Retrieved 2018-02-14. Highest feeding frequencies are shown in individuals in the radius range of 10-29mm, with peaks of activity in the months of May and June. Those in the 50-89mm radius range have an eating frequency more constant than all other sizes. Not only is the frequency of foraging larger in small individuals, they also eat larger portion sizes. There are shifts in dietary composition as the species increases in size. In specimens of 10-19mm radii, rissoid and eatoniellid molluscs compose 46% of the food source, with trochids and chitons a mere 10%. However, for specimens with a radius of 30-39mm, rissoids and eatoniellids only contribute 2.6% of the diet, and chitons constitute 21%. Rissoids and eatoniellids are a minor food source for all A. scabra of radius 29mm-89mm, and are completely absent from the diet of individuals with radius >89mm. Chitons and trochids remain in the diet until radius exceeds 159mm. Increased radii coincides with an increase in spiral-shell gastropod and chiton consumption. These types of prey would normally be too large for a small seastar to consume. This change in diet is vital to survival and longevity because it results in little to no competition between individuals of different sizes, and may be a considerable factor in the ecological success of this starfish.Town, John, C. 1981.

He is the convenor of Youngspiration, a localist political group in Hong Kong that leans towards Hong Kong independence, and is also leader & spokesperson of the pro-independence Hong Kong National Front. He was elected to the Legislative Council of Hong Kong as a member for New Territories East in the 2016 Hong Kong Legislative Council election. Triggered by his actions to make an independence political statement during the oath- taking ceremony, he faced a legal challenge from the government and was later stripped of his office by the court on 15 November 2016. Background Leung graduated from the City University of Hong Kong and was the president of the City University of Hong Kong Students' Union in 2007. It was reported that he supported the government's appointment of Way Kuo to be the president of the City University of Hong Kong and developed a close relationship with the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong. Leung later admitted that they have met but he did not agree with their stance. He became a digital marketer after his graduation. In January 2015, Leung established Youngspiration with a group of like-minded people who participated in the 2014 Occupy protests, often dubbed the \\"Umbrella Movement\\". It stands on a localist platform, against the influx of Chinese immigrants and tourists. In the 2015 District Council election, Youngspiration fielded nine candidates, in which Leung himself stood in Kwun Lung against pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB) Yeung Hoi-wing who succeeded veteran Ip Kwok-him. Leung lost the election by a margin of about 900 votes. Only one of the nine Youngspiration candidates was elected. Legislative Councillor and disqualification In the 2016 Legislative Council election, Youngspiration formed an electoral alliance under the name of \\"ALLinHK\\" with other newly founded Umbrella groups. Leung planned to stand in the Hong Kong Island constituency but later stood in New Territories West. He withdrew his nomination at the last moment and led his own ticket in New Territories East as a backup plan right before Hong Kong Indigenous' Edward Leung was disqualified by the Electoral Affairs Commission (EAC) for his pro- independence stance. Baggio Leung was elected, receiving 37,997 votes. On 12 October 2016 in the first meeting of the session, Leung and his party colleague Yau Wai-ching inserted their own words into the official script and had their oaths rejected. They were criticised for pronouncing China as \\"Jee- na\\", a term considered derogatory since the Second Sino-Japanese War, and Yau was mispronouncing \\"People's Republic of China\\" as \\"people's re-fucking of Jee-na\\". As a result, their qualification as legislators was challenged by the government in court. The National People's Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC) intervened in the court case by interpreting Article 104 of the Basic Law of Hong Kong to \\"clarify\\" the provision of the legislators to swear allegiance to Hong Kong as part of China when they take office, by insisting oath taking be conducted sincerely and accurately, and later stating that China would firmly oppose Hong Kong independence. On 15 November 2016, the court vacated the two legislators' seats on the grounds they did not take their oaths \\"faithfully and truthfully\\". On 26 August 2017, the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong refused to appeal the case as they did not have a reasonably arguable case. Leung and Yau were found to have manifestly refused and wilfully omitted to take their oath ‚Äì an act classed as declining and neglecting it. In May 2020, Leung faced a court ruling where the Legislative Council Commission demanded a repayment of HK$930,000 (US $120,000). The commission claimed he mistakenly received the funds and salary intended for lawmakers. A bankruptcy order was asked to be petitioned against him. Speaking about the legal proceedings, Leung remarked on his preparedness and that \\"being declared bankrupt was minor compared to being jailed for life under Beijing‚Äôs new national security law for Hong Kong.\\" References Notes 1986 births Hong Kong localists Living people Alumni of the City University of Hong Kong Youngspiration politicians Members of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong HK LegCo Members 2016‚Äì2020 People expelled from public office Political repression in Hong Kong ","title":"Baggio Leung"},{"id":"51432569","text":"Coogler is a surname of German origin, and an Americanized version of Kugler.

He was a contemporary of fellow expatriate artists Urushibara Mokuchu, Yoshio Markino and Kurihara Chuji. In October 1914, he married Mabel Davies in Chelsea. During the war, he worked with the British Red Cross in providing support and entertainment for wounded soldiers in art and lacquerwork and, later, in displays of Judo and Kendo, firstly at Kitchener House in Hyde Park and subsequently at Richmond House, Surrey, earning a British Red Cross Society Commendation. Unlike the majority of the Japanese community, who returned home as a result of anti-Japanese feeling during the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II, Matsuyama appears to have remained in Britain, becoming a naturalised British Citizen in 1947. Art Like the painter Sato Takezou, Matsuyama studied at the Chelsea School of Art, while also working as a decorative painter, restorer and lacquer repairer. He exhibited his watercolours widely within the Japanese community, including at the Japanese Club in Cavendish Square, as noted in the London newspaper of the Japanese community, the Nichiei Shinshi. He was also, however, an active and successful member of the British art world, exhibiting from 1916 at the Royal Academy, as well as at the Royal Scottish Academy, with the National Portrait SocietyCatalogue of the Spring Exhibition, 1915, held at the Grosvenor Gallery, 51a New Bond Street., W. (Eighteenth London Exhibition) and regional art galleries. He was a member of the Holborn artists‚Äô society and was elected an Associate of the British Watercolour Society ‚Äì an honour he was asked to resign in 1947, in the aftermath of World War II. Matsuyama‚Äôs subject matter ranged from floral still lifes and interiors to delicate representations of the English countryside, often carefully annotated with date and location. He was best known as a landscapist, painting scenes of London and Surrey, particularly the area around his home in Holmwood near Dorking, but also undertook picturesque painting tours to Cornwall, North Wales and the Lake District. However, he appears never to have been able to devote his life entirely to painting, earning a living as a decorative painter in country houses, and, from 1926, working full time as a theatrical and scene painter in London's West End. A major exhibition of his work was held in 1987 by J Collins & Son of Bideford, with catalogue notes provided in association with one of Matsuyama‚Äôs sons.

Early life  Le Moine was born on December 21, 1723 in Paris. He came from humble beginnings as the son of a merchant with whom he worked until his early adulthood. There is not much biographical information available until the late 1740s when he arrived at the abbey at Marmoutier. It is known that he spent a period training under a group of Maurist Benedictine monks who were influential on his future archival activities.  Formative career  In the early 1750s Le Moine established himself working under Guillaume Roussel, the archivist of the cathedral of Saint-Martin in Tours and Dom Guillaume Gerou at the abbey at Marmoutier. During this time, he expanded his concentration on medieval documents and their archival place in libraries and other repositories. Under the guidance of Roussel and Gerou, he was involved in their organization and reference for the benefit of seigneurial lords. Seigneurial and ecclesiastical archives would later become his specialty. After nearly a decade working with Roussel and Gerou, Le Moine started his own activities at the Cathedral Chapter in Tours. Le Moine was responsible for the organization of several smaller archives and archival fonds of ecclesiastical bodies linked to the Tours cathedral.  La Diplomatique pratique  Le Moine is best known for the diplomatique- pratique,Lemoine, P. Camille. Diplomatique pratique, ou Trait√© de l'arrangement des archives et tr√©sors des chartes: ouvrage n√©cessaire aux commissaires √† terriers [...] & √† tous ceux qui veulent s'adonner √† l'√©tude des monumens de l'antiquit√©. A Metz: chez Joseph Antoine, 1765 a monograph entirely devoted to archives and archival management and description. The Diplomatique pratique was essentially a manual for archivists based on Le Moine‚Äôs years of experience working in local and church archives. The book starts with several sections relating to the training of archivists and the character qualities which are necessary and even what is needed to maintain their health under unique working conditions. The main body of the work highlights Le Moine‚Äôs core archival protocol which consists of six steps. Step 1 ‚Äì Separate documents into high level categories and create containers for each. Step 2 ‚Äì Divide each container into bundles based on a coherent subject. Step 3 ‚Äì Carefully open and unfold ancient parchments and date each item. Step 4 - Thorough analysis and assessment of all documents including the detailed study of the contents and theme.* Step 5 ‚Äì Ordering of documents using a consistent naming convention and the assignment of shelf numbers. Step 6 ‚Äì Create an inventory document as the source of ongoing records management. * This process was most important to LeMoine since the evaluation of the theme was what differentiated the work of an archivist from that of simple record storage. This process was also challenging because it often involved the review of records in other languages.

He was father of the social activists Alaa Abd El-Fattah, Sanaa Seif and Mona Seif. His wife was social activist and professor Laila Soueif, sister of novelist Ahdaf Soueif.  Early years  Ahmed Seif El-Islam was born in Hosh Eissa, Beheira Governorate . He graduated from the Faculty of Economics and Political Science of Cairo University in 1977. While serving a five-year sentence in prison for a free speech case, he earned a degree in law from Cairo University in 1989. He also received a degree in criminal law from the same university.  Political, legal and human rights activism  In the 1970s, Seif was a leader in the student movement; accordingly, he was arrested and tortured by the police forces several times, especially in the so-called ‚Äúorganized popular movement‚Äù case. In prison and during his detention period, he got his bachelor's degree in Law. After he was released, he volunteered to defend defendants with various affiliations, in cases concerning opinion; such as the ‚ÄúRevolutionary Socialists‚Äù and ‚ÄúIslamic Liberation Party‚Äù cases in 2003 and 2004, respectively. He also defended many cases before the high Constitutional Court. In 2008, Seif was part of the team defending 49 persons, who were tried before the high State Security Court in Tanta, North Cairo. They were accused of participating in popular protests on 6 April 2008. The protest was in solidarity with the Mahala workers strike, which was primarily in the state- run textile industry, in response to low wages and rising food costs; however, violent clashes between the police and protestors took part. The lawyers‚Äô team claimed that all confessions from the side of defendants were taken under the pressure of torture during their detention period. The case ended up acquitting and freeing 27 defendants and convicting 22 others. Seif was one of the lawyers defending the 13 defendants, who were affiliated to Abdullah Azzam Brigades and were accused of the Taba terrorist bombing in 2004. 3 of them were sentenced to death and other to life imprisonment; however, the Security Council of Armed Forces didn‚Äôt ratify the sentences and the defendants went to rehearing and retrial. Seif raised concerns about the unconstitutionality of the court; accordingly, the retrials were postponed till the 13th of December 2013, in order to provide measure certificate that proves the unconstitutionality of the court and the annulment of Emergency Law. After the January 25 uprising, Seif was a member of the Personal Liberty Protection Commission, which was formulated by Presidential Decree number 5 for 2012. The commission was responsible for reviewing all cases of civilians, who were tried and sentenced by a military court in the period between 25 January 2011 and 30 June 2012. It was also mandated to review situations of all political prisoners, who were held by the Ministry of Interior or other entities. Finally, the commission was assigned to examine cases of protestors who were sentenced by civilian courts.  Detention  Seif was detained four times, twice during the Sadat era and twice during the Mubarak era. In 1972 Seif was held in custody for two days for joining student demonstrations demanding the liberation of Sinai. In the following year he was detained for 8 months after participating in protests rejecting president Sadat's speech and the deferment of the decision of the upcoming war with Israel, Seif and his mates were released days before the October War and stated that \\"he had not been tortured in prison\\". In 1983 Seif and 16 others were accused of membership in a leftist organization, but only Seif and 4 of his mates spent 5 years in Citadel prison. Seif suffered during his time in prison, he was beaten and tortured by electricity, until his arm and leg were broken. A legal complaint was submitted regarding the incident but was ignored. Commenting on that, Seif said \\"I Had the Chance to escape to London when my Wife Dr. Laila and my son Alaa were there but I changed my mind although the security were willing to help me escaping to get rid of me as a political activist but I had an agreement with my wife to turn myself in, despite the fact that my wife was pregnant with my second kid Mona, I chose to spend 5 years in prison in my country rather than escape and live at least 15 years away, so I turned myself in, and I had received my law degree in prison, but the history repeats itself my daughter was born during my time in prison and the same happened with my son Alaa, his son khalid was born while his father in prison,\\" The experience of detention and torture pushed Seif to dedicate his activities to defending human rights. Seif was also detained for two days in 2011 on the third of February, the day known as \\"Battle of the Camel\\", when the security forces stormed Hisham Mubarak Law Center and arrested Seif and other human rights activists and Journalists.  Death  Seif died on 27 August 2014 from complications following heart surgery at Qasr El-Einy hospital in Cairo, aged 63. Two of his three children ‚Äì Alaa Abd-elFattah and Sanaa Seif - were unable to visit their father in hospital because they had been jailed for taking part in protests against the law banning unsanctioned demonstrations.

The main event and highlights from several of the matches on the show were broadcast the following day on AYM Sports in Mexico and matches from the show were later posted online by the Lucha+ TV show. In the main event of the show, a Lucha de Apuestas or \\"bet match\\", Trauma I defeated Canis Lupus, forcing him to unmask and reveal his real name, H√©ctor L√≥pez. Also on the show Imposible defeated Heddi Karaoui to win the IWRG Intercontinental Middleweight Championship and the team of Veneno and Chicano became the number one contenders for the IWRG Intercontinental Tag Team Championship. Production =Background= In Lucha libre the wrestling mask holds a sacred place, with the most anticipated and prestigious matches being those where a wrestler's mask is on the line, a so-called Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\" where the loser would be forced to unmask in the middle of the ring and state their birth name. Winning a mask is considered a bigger accomplishment in lucha libre than winning a professional wrestling championship. The M√°scara vs. M√°scara show was the third of three major shows held within a week of each other, produced by the three biggest lucha libre promotions in Mexico, AAA, Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) and IWRG. The first show, AAA's Tripleman√≠a XXIV, which took on Sunday August 28 at the Arena Ciudad de M√©xico with Psycho Clown defeating Pagano in a Lucha de Apuestas match in the main event. The second major lucha libre show, the CMLL 83rd Anniversary Show, took place five days after Tripleman√≠a on September 2 at Arena M√©xico where Dragon Lee defeated La M√°scara in a match where both their masks were on the line. Finally IWRG held the M√°scara vs. M√°scara show two days later on September 4. =Storylines= Trauma I, one of the wrestlers risking his mask in the main event The event featured six professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they performed in matches with a pre-determined outcome. In early 2016 Trauma I defeated El Hijo de Dos Caras to win the IWRG Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship in the main event of IWRG's 2016 Triangular de la Muerte (\\"Triangle of Death\\") show. Subsequently, Trauma I and his brother Trauma II became involved in a storyline feud with Los Insoportables (\\"The Unbearables\\") team of Canis Lupus and Eterno). This led to Los Traumas defeating Los Insportables in the main event of IWRG's Choque de Rudos (\\"Villain Shock\\"). A few weeks later Los Insportables gained a measure of revenge by defeating Los Traumas. On April 13 Los Traumas and their father Negro Navarro successfully defended the IWRG Intercontinental Trios Championship against Canis Lupus, Eterno and Apolo Estrada Jr. Throughout the storyline the focal point was on the issues between Trauma I and Canis Lupus, which lead to Canis Lupus defeating Trauma I in the main event of the Lucha de Fieras (\\"Fierce Fight\\"). On April 24 Canis Lupus played a key role in M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. defeating Trauma I to win the IWRG Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship, attacking Trauma I when the referee was not looking. After the match Canis Lupus demanded a title match as he helped M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. win the championship. The following week the two faced off in a match where both wrestlers would bleed heavily during the match. Following M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. cheating to retain the championship Trauma I came to the ring, challenging both wrestlers to a Lucha de Apuestas match. In June Mr. Electro began working for IWRG on a regular basis and ends up winning the IWRG Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship on June 12. From that point on the storyline turned into a four-way feud between Trauma I, Canis Lupus, M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. and Mr. Electro. On July 10 Mr. Electro defeated M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. in the main event of IWRG's Gran Mano a Mano Esperando where Mr. Electro defeated M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. after hitting him with a light tube. Following the match both agreed to put their hair on the line in a Lucha de Apuestas match the following week. A week later Mascara Ano 2000 Jr. pinned Mr. Electro, forcing Mr. Electro to have his hair shaved off as a result. Afterwards Canis Lupus challenged Mascara Ano 2000 Jr. to another Lucha de Apuestas match where Canis Lupus would put his mask on the line. The match took place on August 8 and was Canis Lupus pin Mascara Ano 2000 Jr. in the third fall to win the match. While Mascara Ano 2000 Jr. was being shaved bald Trauma I came to ringside and challenged Canis Lupus to put his mask on the line. Canis Lupus agreed with IWRG announcing that both wrestlers would risk their hair in the main event of IWRG's September 4 show. In the week after IWRG made the match official Box y Lucha magazine stated it was \\"IWRG's biggest Apuestas match in years\\", noting the high profile of both masked wrestlers involved in the match. On August 25 IWRG released the poster for the M√°scara vs. M√°scara event, which revealed the six match show details. Pantera, one half of the IWRG Intercontinental Tag Team Championship team The father/son team of Pantera and El Hijo del Pantera won the IWRG Intercontinental Tag Team Championship from Los Gringos VIP (Apolo Estrada Jr. and El Hijo del Diablo on November 22, 2015. The team only defended the championship once between November 2015 and August 2016, defeating the father son team of Negro Navarro and Trauma II on February 7, 2016. To determine the next number one contenders for the tag team championship they booked a four- way tag team match where the winners would be given the next match. None of the four teams in the tournament had team together prior, but were paired up by IWRG. The teams include El Hijo de Dos Caras and Trauma II, M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. and Toscano, Mr. Electro and Herodes Jr. and finally Veneno vs. Chicano, On August 21 then reigning IWRG Intercontinental Lightweight Champion Imposible announced that he was vacating the championship after having held it for 1142 days, starting on July 7, 2013. Imposible decided he wanted to move up to the middleweight class and wanted to challenge for the IWRG Intercontinental Middleweight Championship. IWRG agreed and gave him a championship match against reigning champion Heddi Karaoui at M√°scara vs. M√°scara. The match will be Karaoui's second championship defense since winning the championship on October 25, 2015. IWRG announced three additional matches without any ongoing storylines leading into the matches but featuring several IWRG regulars including Distrito Federal Trios Champions Los Tortuga Ninja (a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle inspired group of masked wrestlers; Leo, Mikey and Rafy teaming with fourth Tortuga Leelo) to face off against Hananoka, Hip Hop Man, Killer Jr. and Yakuza in the third match of the night. In the second match of the night long time IWRG wrestlers Black Terry and Cerebro Negro (part of Los Terrible Cerebros) team up with Pantera I to take on two-thirds of Los Mariachis Locos, El Hijo del Diablo and Diablo Jr., who team up with Violencia Jr. The opening match saw rivals Dragon Fly and Demonio Infernal on opposite sides of an eight-man tag team match where Dragon Fly teams up with Alas de Oro, Aramis and Diosa Atena, while Demoio Infernal teams up with Ara√±a de Plata, Skanda and Lili Darth. On August 3, in the main event of IWRG's most recent M√°scara vs. Cabellera show, Dragon Fly defeated Demonio Infernal in a Lucha de Apuestas, forcing Demonio Infiernal to unmask afterwards. Event Alas de Acero was originally advertised for the opening event, but he was replaced by Cadillac on the night of the event, with no official explanation given. The team of Ara√±a de Plata, Demonio Infernal, Lilith Dark and Skanda defeated Aramis, Cadillac, Diosa Atenea and Drag√≥n Fly, two falls to one. The focal point of the second match of the night was the ongoing, escalating feud between El Hijo del Diablo and Black Terry. The match saw Hijo del Diablo, Diablo Jr. and Violencia Jr. defeat Black Terry, Cerebro Negro and Pantera I by underhanded means. After the match both Hijo del Diablo and Black Terry made challenges for a Lucha de Apuestas, hair vs. hair match, that was then made official for September 18. In the third match of the night IWRG regulars Los Tortugas Ninja defeated Hip Hop Man and the \\"Outsiders\\" Hanaoka, Hip Hop Man, Killer Jr., Yakuza. For the IWRG Intercontinental Middleweight Championship match Imposible was accompanied by his Los Mariachis de la Muerte team member El Hijo del Diablo. During the match defending champion Karaoui hit his head and was bleeding throughout the closing portions of the match. In the end Imposible pinned Karaoui to become the 36th IWRG Intercontinental Middleweight Champion. The semi-main event tag team math was contested first fall wins the match rules, which led to all teams fighting to stay alive, breaking up pinfalls throughout out the match. In the end Veneno pinned El Hijo del Dos Casas to win the match and thus earned a title opportunity for himself and Chicano. For the Lucha de Apuestas match Trauma I had Mr. Elektro in his corner while Canis Lupus was accompanied by M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. While both wrestlers lend moral support neither of the corner-men interfered during the match. Canis Lupus won the first fall, putting Trauma I at a disadvantage. Trauma I won the second fall with a submission, leading to the third fall. Canis Lupus was bleeding by the beginning of the third fall, which escalated throughout the match, leaving blood stains all over the canvas as the match progressed. During the third and deciding fall of the main event Trauma I accidentally hit the referee, which gave Canis Lupus the opportunity to use a Piledriver on Trauma I. In lucha libre the piledriver is a banned moved and is always played up as being very damaging to the neck of the recipient. The move was not enough to finish the match as Trauma I managed to lift his shoulder at the last seconds. The match was momentarily stopped for a doctor to check on Trauma I, but to the surprise of everyone in the arena Trauma I insisted on fighting, ending up trapping Canis Lupus in a figure-four leglock, forcing Canis Lupus to submit. After the match, Trauma I was fitted with a neck brace to sell the damage from the pile driver. As a result of his loss Canis Lupus had to unmask and reveal his real name, H√©ctor L√≥pez, that he was 32 years old and had been a wrestler for 10 years. L√≥pez brought his girlfriend into the ring to do the actual unmasking, after which he proposed to her, which she accepted. Aftermath The main event and highlights from several of the matches on the show were broadcast the following day on AYM Sports in Mexico. Some of matches from the show were later posted online by the Lucha+ TV show as well. After being named the number one contenders for the IWRG Intercontinental Tag Team Championship Chicano and Veneno were given a match for the championship the following week on September 11. During the match the actual lights in Arena Naucalpan went out, promoting the fans in attendance to take out their cell phones and lighting up the arena as Chicano and Veneno defeated El Pantera and El Hijo del Pantera to win the championship. While both Black Terry and El Hijo del Diablo agreed to a Lucha de Apuestas match for September 18, IWRG did not actually announce that match as part of their September 18th show.

Medieval chronicles unanimously stated that the Sz√©kelys were descended from the Huns and settled in the Carpathian Basin centuries before the Hungarians (or Magyars) conquered the territory in the late 9th century. This theory is refuted by most modern specialists. According to a widely accepted modern hypothesis, the Sz√©kelys were originally a Turkic people who joined the Magyars in the Pontic steppes. Other scholars say, the Sz√©kelys were descended from the border guards of the Kingdom of Hungary who settled in the easternmost region of the Carpathian Basin and preserved their special privileges for centuries. According to a fourth theory, the Sz√©kelys' origin can be traced back to the Late Avar population of the Carpathian Basin.  Medieval chronicles  Medieval chronicles associated the Sz√©kelys with the Huns, also claiming that both the Huns and the Hungarians were descended from the Scythians. Medieval scholars also agreed that the Sz√©kelys had already been present in the Carpathian Basin before the Hungarians (or Magyars) conquered the territory. The early 13th- century Gesta Hungarorum was the first to mention that the Sz√©kelys \\"were previously the peoples\\"Anonymus, Notary of King B√©la: The Deeds of the Hungarians (ch. 50.), p. 109. of Attila the Hun. According to the same source, the Sz√©kelys \\"gave their sons as hostages along with diverse gifts\\" to the Hungarian chieftain, ≈êsb≈ë, at the K√∂r√∂s River before joining his campaign against Menumorut. Simon of K√©za stated that the Sz√©kelys were \\"remnants of the Huns\\" who \\"remained on the field of Csigla\\"Simon of K√©za: The Deeds of the Hungarians (ch. 21.), p. 71. after the fall of the Hunnic Empire. In contrast with the Gesta Hungarorum, K√©za said, the Sz√©kelys joined the Hungarians \\"on the borders of Ruthenia\\" when the Hungarians crossed the Carpathian Mountains. All subsequent Hungarian chronicles repeated K√©za's story and most scholars accepted the identification of the Sz√©kelys with the Huns for centuries. The theory was also mentioned in Istv√°n Werb≈ëczy's Tripartitum, which was published several times in Sz√©kely Land after 1517. As a consequence, it cannot be decided whether the Sz√©kelys' well-documented own tradition of their Hunnic origin is a genuine part of their folklore, or it is only an adoption of a medieval scholarly fabrication. Most Sz√©kelys still regard themselves as descendants of the Huns, but the majority of modern scholars refute this theory.  Modern scholarship  The linguist P√°l Hunfalvy was the first scholar to question the association of the Sz√©kelys with the Huns in the 1870s. However, scholars have not reached a consensus about the origin of the Sz√©kelys. The modern theories can be divided into three major groups. = Late Avars = Medieval chronicles are evidence that the Sz√©kelys were regarded as a distinct ethnic group which had settled in the Carpathian Basin before the Hungarians. Some scholars (especially Gyula L√°szl√≥ and P√°l Engel) say that the Sz√©kelys are the direct descendants of the \\"Late Avar\\" population of the region. The \\"Late Avar\\" period started around 700 A.D., and lasted for about a century. Artifacts (mostly buckles and strap ends) decorated with floral patterns and griffins are the most featured items of the assemblages for this period. L√°szl√≥ and Engel attribute this new archaeological horizon to a group of Onogurs who had fled from the Pontic steppes to the West after the Khazars destroyed their empire around 680. According to most scholars, the Onogurs spoke a Turkic language, but L√°szl√≥ proposed that they were a Hungarian- speaking group. A charter of Louis the German, King of East Francia, mentioned the Wangariorum marcas (\\"Wangars' frontier\\") around 860, implying that Onogurs still lived in the westernmost region of the Carpathian Basin in the second half of the 9th century. Most scholars refute the association of the Sz√©kelys with the \\"Late Avars\\" or Onogurs. = Social group: Hungarian border guards = The Sz√©kelys speak the Hungarian language \\"without any trace of a Turkic substratum\\", indicating that they did not have a language shift during their history, according to scholars, who propose that the Sz√©kelys were descended from privileged Hungarian groups. Most place names in Sz√©kely Land are of Hungarian origin, showing that the Sz√©kelys spoke Hungarian when they settled in the region. The three main Hungarian dialects of Sz√©kely Land are closely connected to the Hungarian variants spoken along the western and southwestern borders of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary. The dialect of the Sz√©kelys of Marossz√©k is similar to the dialects spoken by the Hungarian communities near Pressburg (now Bratislava in Slovakia) and in southern Burgenland. The Hungarian variant of Udvarhelysz√©k is closely related to the tongue of the Hungarians in Baranya County and Slavonia. The easternmost Sz√©kely communities' dialect is connected to the Hungarian variant of Burgenland. Other important social phenomenon supports the social group thesis. If Sz√©kely men moved to the cities or towns in Sz√©kelyland, they lost their Sz√©kely social status and identity immediately, moreover the new townsmen and the Sz√©kely villagers considered each other as extraneous. It also confirms that Sz√©kelys considered themselves as a special Hungarian social group rather than a real separate ethnic group in the medieval and early modern period.Judit Balogh: Sz√©kelyudvarhely v√°rosi elitj√©nek kialakul√°sa a 16-17. sz√°zad fordul√≥j√°n (The development of the elite of the towns in Sz√©kelyudvarhely) LINK: A very similar social phenomenon and a new strong local identity emerged in Hajd√∫s√°g region of Hungary in the early modern period, when the Hajd√∫ soldiers got feudal privileges and own territory from prince Stephen Bocskai. = Associated people = According to a widely accepted scholarly theory, the Sz√©kelys had originally been a Turkic people who joined the Magyars in the Pontic steppes (to the east of the Carpathian Basin). Written sources evidence, the Sz√©kelys were regarded a separate ethnic group in the Middle Ages. Simon of K√©za wrote of the \\"Hungarian and Sz√©kely forces\\"Simon of K√©za: The Deeds of the Hungarians (ch. 71.), p. 145. of Andrew II of Hungary; a charter of William, Bishop of Transylvania, distinguished the Hungarians and Sz√©kelys in 1213. The Sz√©kelys were listed along with other peoples in the Middle Ages, also indicating that they were considered an ethnic group. In 1250, a royal charter enumerated the Saxons, Vlachs, Sz√©kelys and Pechenegs when mentioning a campaign against Bulgaria; the 14th-century Hungarian chronicles wrote of Sz√©kelys and Pechenegs participating in the Battle of Ol≈°ava.  Alternative theories  Humanist scholar Petrus Ransanus was the first to propose an alternative theory about the origin of the Sz√©kelys. Based on the Latin Siculus form of their ethnonym, he said that Sicilian soldiers who allegedly fought in the army in Attila the Hun were the Sz√©kelys' ancestors. Jesuit priest Ferenc Fasching stated that the Sz√©kelys were descended from a Jasz group whom B√©la IV of Hungary had supposedly settled in Transylvania. Nicolae Iorga proposed that the Sz√©kelys were originally Romanians, but he abandoned this theory.

A special double-length episode, it was written and storyboarded by Raven M. Molisee, Paul Villeco, Hilary Florido, and Lauren Zuke. The episode was first broadcast on Cartoon Network on November 17, 2016, and was viewed by 1.385 million viewers. In this episode, Steven Universe meets his grumpy, intolerant uncle Andy, who is upset with the loss of his family's closeness and traditions, and attempts to make him feel welcome as part of Steven's family of extraterrestrial magical Gems. The episode was controversial among critics for its addition of an apparently bigoted character to the diverse and accepting world of Steven Universe, especially in the context of what they perceived to be a growing influence of bigotry in contemporary politics. Plot Steven (Zach Callison) visits Peridot (Shelby Rabara) and Lapis Lazuli (Jennifer Paz), Gems who have fled the Gem Homeworld, at the barn that they have made into their home. Peridot and Lapis have taken up farming, but they are dismayed to learn that vegetables do not come to life walking and talking. Steven, using his power to create sentient plants, licks a pumpkin seed. The next morning, it has come to life as a barking pumpkin-dog, which Peridot and Lapis adopt as a pet. Just then, a biplane lands near the barn. The pilot (Dave Willis) emerges, ranting indignantly about the modifications Lapis and Peridot have made to the structure. He denounces them as hobos and hippies squatting on his property. Lapis and Peridot prepare to attack him while Steven calls his father, Greg (Tom Scharpling), for help. When Greg arrives with Garnet (Estelle), Amethyst (Michaela Dietz), and Pearl (Deedee Magno Hall), he introduces the pilot as his cousin, Andy DeMayo. Though delighted to learn Steven is his nephew, Andy is angry at Greg for separating himself from their family, and for allowing \\"illegal aliens\\" to live in the barn. He reminisces about the annual family reunions the DeMayos used to hold at the barn, and so Steven offers to prepare a festive dinner to convince Andy to let Lapis and Peridot stay. The Gems begin harvesting vegetables and preparing the meal; but tensions rise between the Gems and Andy when Peridot and Pearl build a stove by disassembling an airplane engine that was a valued memento of Andy's parents. The Gems leave to buy party supplies, and Andy begins to relax, telling Steven about his love of flying. When the Gems return with a confused assortment of wedding, baby shower, and funeral supplies, Andy takes it in stride. But at dinner, Andy is alienated by the Gems' strangeness and confused by their in-jokes, and when they thank each other for helping prepare dinner, Andy is left out. Feeling excluded, Andy leaves in his plane. Steven has Lapis fly him up to Andy's plane. In mid-air, Andy tells Steven about his frustration that other members of his family have moved on; Steven tells Andy that he wants to be part of the family and get to know his uncle. When Steven slips and falls off the plane, Andy dives to catch him. As they fly back to the barn, Andy admits that he bears some responsibility himself for losing touch with family. The Gems awkwardly welcome him back, and Greg and Andy reconcile and embrace. Production Episodes of Steven Universe are written by their storyboard artists. As a 23-minute episode, \\"Gem Harvest\\" had a larger storyboard team than a typical 11-minute episode, including Raven M. Molisee, Paul Villeco, Hilary Florido, and Lauren Zuke. Dave Willis guest-starred in the role of Uncle Andy; some critics noted a similarity between Willis's performance as Andy and his role as Carl Brutananadilewski on Aqua Teen Hunger Force. Reception \\"Gem Harvest\\" met with a mixed reception from critics. Reviewers noted that the episode's theme, focusing on welcoming a bigoted older relative to a family dinner and helping him learn to accept other ways of life, was timely to the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday; but several found this narrative to be uncomfortable or in bad taste in the context of its broadcast shortly after the 2016 United States presidential election. Eric Thurm, reviewing the episode for The A.V. Club, gave it a grade of B, calling it \\"sweet but somewhat lacking\\". He praised the episode's theme of the flexibility of what family can mean, as well as its successful inclusion of a large cast of characters and the complexity of Greg's relationship with Andy. On the other hand, he describes Andy's character as thinly drawn, and calls the episode \\"disingenuous\\" in implying that prejudices such as those Andy exhibits‚Äîhis contempt for \\"hippies\\" and immigrants, and support for \\"traditional marriage\\"‚Äîcan be as easily overcome as the episode portrays. He compared the episode negatively to \\"Bismuth\\", the previous double-length special. Vrai Kaiser, writing for The Mary Sue, disliked the episode. They felt that the episode was inappropriate for a world in which conservative politics such as Andy's were ascendant, finding its narrative of reconciliation unrealistically optimistic. Although they respected the writers' attempt to tackle \\"larger, darker\\" thematic issues, they felt the episode \\"bit off way, way more than it could chew\\" in attempting to do so. Writing for ComicsAlliance, Elle Collins and Katie Schenkel found the episode's timing \\"cringeworthy\\" and its message \\"simplistic\\", finding it hard to sympathize with Andy in the context of contemporary politics; they said the episode would have been better if some of Andy's reactionary attitudes had been omitted. However, they did enjoy the portrayal of Peridot and Lapis's relationship, and appreciated Andy's character development over the course of the episode. On the other hand, Mey Rude, writing for Autostraddle, reviewed the episode positively. She characterized Andy as a \\"Trump voter\\", noting his antipathy to non-traditional families, vegetarians, and \\"illegal aliens\\", and valued the episode's narrative for providing hope that such a character could be persuaded to accept the \\"completely non-nuclear family\\" of the Gems. Zach Blumenfeld, writing for Paste, agreed, calling the episode \\"exactly what the country needs right now\\", praising the episode for its emphasis on the importance of empathy for connecting with those who fear change.

Cosmon or Cosmonium is a hypothetical form of matter where the Universe would have been in a dense form of matter as a particle named Cosmon. The idea was originally proposed by Georges Lema√Ætre who suggested the idea of a 'primeval atom‚Äô (L'Hypoth√®se de l'Atome Primitif) 1946. He illustrated the idea by imagining an object 30 times larger than the volume of the sun containing all the matter of the Universe. Its density would be around 10^{15}\\\\text{g cm}^{-3}. In his view this exploded somewhere between 20‚Äì60 billion years ago. The idea of a primeval ‚Äúsuper-atom‚Äù lived on and was developed forward by Maurice Goldhaber in 1956. In his proposal there would have been a point, which had been called a Universon, that would have collapsed into a Cosmon and an Anticosmon pair. Goldhaber was wondering about why is there any matter if equal amount of matter and antimatter was formed in the beginning of the big bang. One explanation for this is the asymmetry of matter meaning that there could have been slightly more matter than antimatter, for instance 1001 matter particles to every 1000 antimatter. In Goldhabers model cosmon and anticosmon would have flown apart and therefore explaining issue without asymmetry. In 1989 Hans Dehmelt attempted to modernize the idea of the primeval atom. In this hypothesis, Cosmonium would have been the heaviest form of matter at the beginning of the big bang.

Fenwick manuscript, compiled in the second half of the 19th century, is a compilation of Northumbrian pipe music, together with other material associated with the instrument. Fenwick was a tailor, who lived in North Shields from about 1841. The same town was the home of the Reid family of pipers and pipemakers, and several other prominent pipers lived nearby. By 1894 Fenwick was described as \\"one of the oldest and best-known small pipes players in the county\\";Shields Daily Gazette, January 12th, 1894. Retrieved from British Newspaper Archive. by this time he seems to have been playing for about 50 years. The manuscript was apparently being compiled throughout this period. Significance This source is particularly important, in that for many of the tunes Fenwick is careful to indicate his source for the version he gives. For instance, in some cases Fenwick gives a provenance from Cornelius Stanton, and occasionally via Stanton to John Peacock. Two of the tunes from Stanton, in Stanton's own hand, Little wot ye wha's coming and Blackett of Wylam were attributed by him to Peacock, although it is not in the collection of Peacock's tunes published about 1800. These tunes are also known from the manuscripts of Peacock's pupil Robert Bewick, but any direct association of them with Peacock had previously been conjectural. Another important group of tunes have an attribution to Robert Reid, or his children James Reid and Elizabeth Oliver. One of the Reid tunes is a 5-strain set of The Dorrington Lads, from Mrs Oliver, whose comment is noted that \\"This is most likely the same copy that poor Will Allen was trying to play when his Spirit was called Home to a more blissful Rest\\". This version was known, from the Rook manuscript, but its association with the Reid family was not. Given Robert Reid's father Robert Reed's known association with James Allan, this link is entirely possible. Further, some tunes or versions are otherwise unknown - a version of Shew's the Way to Wallington, from James Reid, is distinct from previously known sets. One long variation set, of six strains, on the tune \\"Highland Black Laddie\\", called \\"Highland Laddie\\" in the manuscript, is attributed to Robert Mackintosh, a Scottish violinist and composer, whose son Abraham had settled in Newcastle; it seems to be unknown elsewhere, but an unusual variant of the same tune in the Rook manuscript, also called \\"Highland Laddie\\", is thematically related to the final pair of these variations - together they suggest that the original composition had eight strains. Some printed dance music in the collection is particularly associated with the North Shields area; further, the well known tune \\"Lamshaw's Fancy\\", is here called \\"Lamshaw of North Shield's Fancy\\", which must refer specifically to Young William Lamshaw, who lived in the town, and was an early player of the keyed smallpipes - the tune's compass, from D to a, fits the earliest form of the keyed instrument. History The manuscript includes, a body of tunes in Cornelius Stanton's hand, consisting of simple traditional tunes as well as popular songs from the 1840s and 1850s, including several by Stephen Foster, and the music hall song \\"Villikins and his Dinah\\". These simple tunes, well known at the time, would all be suitable for a beginner. So it is reasonable to suppose that these form the earliest part of the manuscript, perhaps from when Fenwick was learning to play, but certainly after 1840, and before Stanton's death in 1866. An alternative less likely reading is that Fenwick asked Stanton for a collection of tunes that he could use for teaching. The collection seems to have continued to grow throughout Fenwick's life, for example including tunes he received from Elizabeth Oliver in 1883, and material for Fenwick's own tutor, published more than a decade later in 1897. After Fenwick died in 1907, the manuscript, probably still a collection of loose papers, passed to the Newcastle antiquarian Richard Welford, who had been active in the Northumbrian Small Pipes Society; he would probably have known Fenwick, a Committee member of the Society, from this time. From him it passed to C.O.P. Gibson of Bywell. It was probably Gibson who showed the manuscript to G.G. Armstrong, who lived nearby; his notebooks contain tunes stated as being from Fenwick's manuscript, including Elizabeth Oliver's variation set on Maggie Lauder, since published in the Northumbrian Pipers' Third Tune Book.Northumbrian Pipers' Third Tune Book, ed. Ann Sessoms, The Northumbrian Pipers' Society, 1991, p. 20. At some point the manuscript was bound, and its compiler misidentified as J.W. Fenwick, a solicitor of Hexham. As Welford would almost certainly have known Fenwick, it was perhaps Gibson who misidentified him. The manuscript came onto the market in May 2016, and is currently in private hands. The current owner has placed some information on the webpage.http://northshieldsnsp.co.uk/the-j-w-fenwick-collection-of- northumberland-small-pipe-music/ This page includes a detailed section on tunes associated with the Reid family, including images from relevant pages of the manuscript. It is expected that as more is learned about the manuscript and its contents, this website will be expanded. Compiler Despite an identification, made in the manuscript, of Fenwick with a solicitor of that name who lived in Hexham, which is apparently an mistake by a later owner, the records of the Northumbrian Small Pipes Society show that after 1890 James Fenwick was a tailor, living in North Shields. This seems to tie in with an 1851 census entry, listing a James Fenwick, tailor and publican, at the Phoenix Inn in Bedford Street, North Shields. Intermediate identifications are tentative, as the name James Fenwick is common locally. As well as his involvement with the NSPS, in particularly compiling a tutor for the instrument, published by them,J. W. Fenwick, Instructions for playing the Northumbrian Small Pipes, Northumbrian Small Pipes Society, 1897. he had previously been involved with John Collingwood Bruce and the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne, when they were organising a series of piping competitions in the 1870s. A surviving letter from Bruce to Fenwick, pasted into the MS, shows that a version of Fenwick's Instructions for playing the small-pipes existed as early as 1877.

He was murdered along with his eldest son Donald at Dingwall Castle during a feud with the Earl of Sutherland, chief of the Clan Sutherland. Early life Iye Mackay was the son of Donald Mackay, 3rd of Strathnaver and his wife who was a daughter of Iye (MacNeil) of Gigha. Feud with the Earl of Sutherland Between Iye Mackay, 4th of Strathnaver and the Sutherland family there was a feud that caused much blood-shed on either side. According to Sir Robert Gordon, 1st Baronet (1580 ‚Äì 1656), who was a younger son of Alexander Gordon, 12th Earl of Sutherland, \\"the Earl of Sutherland had great controversy with the house and family of Mackay, chief of the Clan Vic-Morgan of Stathnaver, which did continue a long time between the inhabitants of Sutherland and Strahnaver, although with some intermission\\".Mackay, Angus (1906). p. 44. Quoting: Gordon, Sir Robert, A Genealogical History of the Earldom of Sutherland. According to historian Angus Mackay, this account corroborates with a complaint made by William, 5th Earl of Sutherland in 1342 when he applied to the Pope for a dispensation of marriage with Margaret Bruce (daughter of Robert I of Scotland) against \\"an ancient enemy\\" who caused \\"wars, disputes and many offences, in these parts\\".Mackay, Angus (1906). p. 44. Quoting: Theiner‚Äôs Monumenta Vetera. p. 278. According to historian William Fraser, if as contended the Mackays are descendants of Malcolm MacHeth, 1st Earl of Ross, then it would make sense for them to be referred to as an ancient enemy of the Sutherlands, as the MacHeths gave trouble to the Scottish kings and their henchmen in the north the Earls of Sutherland.Mackay, Angus (1906). p. 45. Quoting: Fraser, Sir William. K.C.B., The Sutherland Book. Map showing the Mackay chief‚Äôs territory of Strathnaver in relation to the lands of Sutherland, held by the Earl of Sutherland According to the Blackcastle MS (which was written by Alexander Mackay of Blackcastle who had access to the Mackay chief‚Äôs family charters and papers), a meeting was arranged in 1370 at Dingwall between the Earl of Sutherland and Mackay to settle the dispute. Present at the meeting was the Earl of Sutherland along with his brother Nicholas Sutherland, 1st of Duffus and Iye Mackay along with his son Donald. Mackay was about to succeed in his claim and the Sutherlands became so irritated that Nicholas Sutherland rose in the night and murdered both Iye Mackay and his son Donald. Sir Robert Gordon‚Äôs version of events agrees with this account, but he adds that the meeting actually took place at Dingwall Castle. Gordon also adds that one of arbiters was the Lord of the Isles. Historian Angus Mackay concludes that the Earl of Ross would also have been one of the arbiters of a case tried in his own castle and that it is not unlikely that the Earl of Buchan who was justiciar for the north would also have been present. Angus Mackay gives some background information as to what may have caused the feud between the Mackays and Sutherlands: In 1345, David II of Scotland granted a charter to the Earl of Sutherland and his wife Margaret Bruce who was the sister of David II which gave Sutherland almost kingly powers in Sutherland. The Earl had only one son with Margaret Bruce, John of Sutherland, who was to succeed the childless David II of Scotland as king. However, John of Sutherland died of plague in London and David was succeeded in the throne by his nephew, Robert II of Scotland. Around this time the king's physician was Farquhar Mackay, son of Iye Mackay, 4th of Strathnaver, member of the family that was the Sutherland‚Äôs \\"ancient enemy\\". Farquhar Mackay had also received a charter from the Earl of Buchan, confined by the king for the lands of Melness in the parish of Durness. It suited royal policy to put pressure upon the Earl of Sutherland by favouring their \\"ancient enemy\\", Mackay of Strathnaver. Although the regality of the Earl of Sutherland did not include Strathnaver, Iye Mackay of Strathnaver also held lands in Sutherland, close to the borders of Ross-shire, and vexing the claim of Sutherland's powers of regality over him, tried to have the matter submitted to arbitration when in favourable circumstances. Thus just when Mackay was in sight of receiving a favourable judgement, he and his son were killed by Nicolas Sutherland in the dead of night at Dingwall Castle. Family The known children of Iye Mackay, 4th of Strathnaver were: #Donald Mackay, 5th of Strathnaver, murdered with his father at Dingwall Castle in 1370. #Farquhar Mackay, physician to Robert II of Scotland. #Mariota Mackay, who was the wife of Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan, otherwise known as the Wolf of Badenoch. Iye Mackay, 4th of Strathnaver was succeeded by his grandson Angus Mackay, 6th of Strathnaver, eldest son of Iye's son Donald.

Corpuz made Gawilan part of a persons with disability (PWD) swimming team he was handling and the Forest Hills resort pool became a place for Gawilan to train. Gawilan's first swimming competition was the 2008 Philippine Olympic Festival which was held in Cagayan de Oro, he was almost disqualified after competition officials learned that he forgot his swimming trunks but was allowed to compete wearing bulky cargo pants. Gawilan finished second in the competition which included members of PWD national team. The first placer, a native of Iligan and PWD national team member urged him to go to Manila and Gawilan became a member of the national team himself. He has joined numerous tournaments in India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Myanmar, New Zealand, and Singapore and has won at least 15 international medals by November 2014. Initially competed under the S8 classification, Gawilan later competed under the S7 classification after a change in regulations by the International Paralympic Committee. He trains under National Para Swimming Team Coaches Tony Ong and Ral Rosario. =Asian Para Games= Gawilan with his medals which he won at the 2018 Asian Para Games. Ernie Gawilan has competed in the Asian Para Games. At the 2014 Asian Para Games in Incheon, South Korea, he won three bronze medals, the most among the Philippine delegation. In the 2018 edition hosted Jakarta, Indonesia, Gawilan won the Philippines' first ever gold medal in the history of the games in the men's 200 meter individual medley SM7. He also won a silver in the 50 meter freestyle S7 event in the same edition. =Summer Paralympics= At the 2015 ASEAN Para Games in Singapore, Gawilan satisfied the Olympic qualifying time of 4:48.29 after he won a gold medal at the men's 400-meter freestyle S8 event with the time of 4:48.49. The feat qualified him for the 2016 Summer Paralympics to be held in Rio de Janeiro. The result was also an ASEAN Para Games recording beating the former record result of 5:03.09, as well as Gawilan's previous personal best of 4:53.67. The performance was followed by another gold at the men's 200 individual medley event. Before winning a gold medal at the games, Gawilan clinched the silver medal at the men's 100m freestyle event. At the 2016 Summer Paralympics, Gawilan competed at the 400-meter freestyle, 100-meter freestyle and 100-meter backstroke events. Gawilan is set to return at the 2020 Summer Paralympics after he attained the minimum qualifying time for the 400m freestyle S6 event. However he is to compete in a qualifying tournament to officially reclassify his disability and formalize his qualification.

Early life and career Humphrey Stafford was the eldest son and heir of Ralph Stafford (died 1410), and came from a family with a strong tradition of military service for the English crown.Carpenter, C., Locality and Polity: A Study of Warwickshire Landed Society 1401-1499 (Cambridge, 1992), 80 n. 156. Sometime before 1400 he had married Elizabeth Burdet, of Huncote, Leicestershire. His marriage brought him a substantial landed estate in both that county, and also in Wiltshire. Stafford's early life has been described Carol Rawcliffe as being 'full of violent incident.' In early 1401, he was suspected of the murder of a Worcestershire man, but although the earl of Warwick was sent to arrest him, he appears to have avoided capture. His father entered into bonds to keep the peace with the victim's family, and within a coupe of years, Humphrey Stafford was a member of the Prince of Wales' retinue. He probably fought with him at the Battle of Shrewsbury (21 July 1403), and by 1404, he had received a Royal pardon for the murder and exoneration by the King's council. His father and uncle Humphrey Stafford (d.1413) of Southwick, Wiltshire and Hooke, Dorset, provided securities for him. However, he was soon further embroiled in law-breaking and violence. In 1405, William, Lord Abergavenny accused him of illegally entering Bergavenny's manor and forest of Feckenham, including illegally hunting and fishing, and beating up his retainers. At least one of those servants succeeded in having Stafford bound over to keep the peace with him. Later life and death In 1410, Stafford was elected MP for Worcestershire, and a year later his father died, leaving him a patrimony based there, Staffordshire and Warwickshire. Following his father's death, he again agreed to join the Prince of Wales' army in Calais, altthough probably did not leave until early 1412. Rawcliffe notes that at some point around this time, Stafford had patched up relations with some of his earlier adversaries. For example, the earl of Warwick appointed him deputy Sheriff of Worcestershire in November 1411, and when he was elected MP in 1415 his running mate was the same retainer of Lord Bergavenny that had successfully had him bound-over ten years earlier. Stafford joined the second royal campaign to France in 1417, during which campaign in Normandy he was appears to have been knighted. It also seems that it was on this campaign that Humphrey Stafford died on 20 February 1419. His heir was his son by Elizabeth, who had predeceased him,Richardson, D., Plantagenet Ancestry: A Study In Colonial And Medieval Families (2nd Edition, 2011), 221. John Stafford (died 1422). Still a minor on Humphrey's death, his inheritance was managed by his relative, Sir Richard Stafford.

Accessed 15 September 2016. The project was announced at the Africa Aerospace and Defence exhibition in September 2014, by the state-owned defence industrial group Denel. Design and development The SARA project originated in 2012 when a SARA Steering Committee, co-chaired by the CEOs of Denel Aerostructures SOC Ltd and Denel Aviation, was set up. Various options were considered. A high wing configuration was selected for SARA to meet the issue of foreign object debris, for example stones thrown up by the propellers during landing, taking off and taxiing. SARA will have a degree of STOL capability, but will not be optimised for STOL operations as it affects other performance parameters negatively. It will be certified under Part 25 of the US Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR 25) with up to 24 seats. It is now in a concept design phase based on market research. Three versions of the SARA are planned - an airliner version with 24 passengers; a combi version able to carry 12 passengers and one LD2 cargo pallet; and a freight version able to transport three LD2 pallets. It is planned to have a maximum takeoff weight of and a pressurised cabin. Preliminary and detailed design stages are still to come with no final design yet. Denel is currently building a full-size mock-up of the SARA to be used as a test rig to check the ease of ingress and egress of passengers; seating layouts; internal cabin arrangements; basic cockpit arrangements; and other parameters. The development phase will probably last five years, with a prototype aircraft to be manufactured by 2020 or 2021.

These textiles are ‚Äònoted for the assurance and originality of the designs, their distinctive and subtle colouring, and the quality of the materials selected‚Äô Early life and education Barron was born in Taplow, Buckinghamshire, the daughter of Walter Barron and Alice Clark Barron. She encountered block printing in her mid teens while on a sketching holiday in Normandy, when the tutor gave her some old printing blocks to experiment with. On realising that the blocks were designed for textiles not paper, she researched further in the library of the Victoria and Albert Museum. She attended the Slade School of Fine Art, where she studied fine art under Henry Tonks, but continued her independent efforts to experiment with printing and learn about dyeing techniques.Barley Roscoe, \\"Phyllis Barron and Dorothy Larcher\\" in Margot Coatts, ed., Pioneers of Modern Craft: Twelve Essays Profiling Key Figures in the History of Twentieth-Century Craft (Manchester University Press 1997). Career In 1917, Barron had her first exhibition and subsequently showed her work at several exhibitions at the Brook Street Gallery together with weaving from Ethel Mairet‚Äôs workshop. Some of Barron's earliest commissions came from the Duke of Westminster's architect, Detmar Blow;Marjorie Orpin Gaylard, \\"Phylis Barron (1890-1964), Dorothy Larcher (1884-1952): Textile Designers and Block Printers\\" The Journal of the Decorative Arts Society 1890-1940 3(1979): 32-39. she created all the textiles used in the Duke's yacht, in his estate offices and in his hunting lodge. The Duke introduced Barron to Coco Chanel, who placed an order of Barron's cushions for her garden. She also exhibited pieces at the Omega Workshops but never became further involved in running the business. In 1923, Barron and Dorothy Larcher began to share a workshop in Parkhill Road, Hampstead, dyeing and block- printing their designs on textiles, and selling the results to interior decorators and fashion designers. Barron favored geometric prints. Enid Marx served as their apprentice from 1925 to 1927.

Barron and Larcher relocated their work to Hambutts House, Painswick, Gloucestershire, in 1930. Stables on the property became a workshop with a large dyeing vat for working with indigo. The grounds became gardens filled with flowers and other plants useful to their work, either practically or as visual inspiration. Among their major commissions they provided hand-printed linen for the interior furnishings, including upholstery and curtains, of a new wing at Girton College, Cambridge in 1932,Lesley Jackson, Twentieth Century Pattern Design (Princeton Architectural Press 2007): 69-70. and curtains for the choir stalls at Winchester Cathedral.Barley Roscoe, \\"Barron, (Mabel) Phyllis (1890-1964)\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press 2014).

The temple is located in a shrine in Ekambareswarar Temple, the largest temple in the town of Kanchipuram, located in the northern part of the town. The temple gopuram (gateway tower) is 59 m tall, which is one of the tallest gopurams in India. The temple is glorified in the Divya Prabandha, the early medieval Tamil canon of the Azhwar saints from the 6th‚Äì9th centuries AD. It is one of the 108 Divyadesam dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshiped as Nilathingal Thunda Perumal and his consort Lakshmi as Nilathingal Thunda Nayagi. Six daily rituals and two major yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the Vaikunta Ekadasi festival, celebrated during the Tamil month of Margazhi (December - January), is the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Unlike other Vaishnavite temples where a Vaishnavite priest officiates, the temples has a Saiva priest as it in inside a Shiva temple. Legend Legend indicating churning of Ocean of Milk Parvati, the consort of Shiva was doing penance under the temple's ancient Mango tree near Vegavathi river. In order to test her devotion Shiva sent fire on her. Goddess Parvati prayed to her brother, Vishnu for help. Vishnu took the crescent from Shiva's head and reflected the rays which then cooled down the tree as well as Parvati. Shiva wanted to test Parvati again and sent the river Ganga (Ganges) to disrupt her penance. Parvati prayed to Ganga and convinced her that both of them were sisters and so she should not harm her. Subsequently, Ganga did not disturb her penance and Parvati made a Shiva Linga out of sand to get united with Shiva. Shiva came to be known as Ekambareswarar or \\"Lord of Mango Tree\\" and Vishnu as Nilathingal Thundam. As per Hindu legend, Parvathi was doing penance at this place to attain the blessings of her husband Shiva. She sought the help of Vishnu to help her in the cause. Vishnu appeared as Vamana with a conch and disc and radiated light as moon. It is believed that Vishnu appeared for Chandra (moon) and Shiva. As per another legend, when Devas (celestial deities) and Asuras (demons) were churning the Ocean of Milk, Vishnu helped them as a tortoise Kurma holding the mount. The snake Vasuki using as a rope for churning emanated poison that turned the skin colour of the tortoise from blue to black. Vishnu reached out to Brahma for resolution, who advised him to worship Shiva. It is believed that Sun and moon are the two eyes of Shiva. He opened his left moon eye to ease the pain of Vishnu with the cold lunar rays. On account of it, the presiding deity came to be known as Nilathingal Thunda Perumal. History The Ekambareswarar temple is one of the most ancient in India having been in existence since at least 600 AD. 2nd century AD Tamil poetry speaks of Kama kottam, and the Kumara kottam (currently the Kamakashi Amman temple and the Subramanya temple).Initially temple was built by Pallavas. The Vedantist Kachiyapper served as a priest at the temple. The existing structure then, was pulled down and rebuilt by the later Chola Kings. Adi Sankara, the 10th- century saint got Kanchipuram remodeled along with expansion of this temple along with Kamakshi Amman temple and Varadaraja Perumal Temple with the help of local rulers. The Vijayanagar kings, during the 15th century, also made lot of contributions to the temple and later developed by Vallal Pachiyappa Mudaliar used to go regularly from Chennai to Kanchipuram to worship in this temple, he spent significant money he amazed during British rule on the temple renovation, Pachiyappa Mudaliar seated at horse back can be seen in the temple pillar. At the later stage a similar temple with same name Ekambareswarar was constructed in Chennai by Pachiappa Mudaliar in order to avoid travelling time to Kanchipuram. The Archaeological Survey of India report of 1905‚Äì06 indicates widespread renovation activities carried out in the temple by Nattukottai Chettiar. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Architecture Legend of the temple in a stucco image The temple is located on the first precinct around the Ekambareswarar Temple, located to the South West of the sanctum. Nilathingal Thundam Perumal is seen in standing posture facing West in the shrine under Purushasuktha Vimana. There is no separate shrine for the consort Nilanthingal Nayagi, neither there is any separate festival image. The shrine faces West, while the Ekamabareswarar shrine faces the East. The Ekambareswarar temple covers an area of over . Reaching a height of , the temple's Raja gopuram (the entrance tower to the temple) is one of the tallest in South India. One notable feature of the temple is the Aayiram Kaal Mandapam, or the \\"hallway with a thousand pillars\\", which was built by the Vijayanagar Kings. The temple's inner walls are decorated with an array of 1,008 Siva lingams. The temple has five prakarams (or courtyards) and has a thousand-pillared hall. Kampai Tirtha, the temple tank is believed to have an underground holy river. The fourth courtyard contains a small Ganesha temple and a pond. The third courtyard contains lot of smaller shrines. The sanctum sanctorum contains the lingam along with the image of Shiva. Religious importance Unlike other Vishnu temples that have Vaishnavite priests, this temple has only Saivite priests as the temple is located on the premises of a Shiva temple. There are no separate festivals celebrated for the presiding deity. The temple is revered in Nalayira Divya Prabandham, the 7th‚Äì9th century Vaishnava canon, by Thirumangai Azhwar in one hymn. The temple is classified as a Divyadesam, one of the 108 Vishnu temples that are mentioned in the book. The consort of Nilathingal Thundam Perumal (also called Chandrasoodeswarar Perumal) is called Nilathingal Thunda Nayagi (also called Ver Oruvar Illa Valli). The temple is one of the three rare Divyadesams, with the other being Govindaraja Perumal Temple and Thirukalvanur, that are housed in a Shiva temple. Only Saivite priests perform rituals in the temple. Festivals and religious practices Image of the temple tower The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. Being inside the premises of a Shiva temple, the priests belong to the Saivite community. The temple rituals are performed six times a day: Ushathkalam at 7:00 a.m., Kalasanthi at 8:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 12:00 p.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m., Irandamkalam at 7:00 p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 10:00 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Govindarajan and Pundarikavalli. During the last step of worship, nagaswaram (pipe instrument) and tavil (percussion instrument) are played, religious instructions in the Vedas (sacred text) are recited by priests, and worshippers prostrate themselves in front of the temple mast. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. The 10-day Vaikunta Ekadasi festival celebrated during the Tamil month of Margazhi (December - January) is the most prominent festival celebrated in the temple. There are special poojas performed during every new moon day.

He was born Karl Hermann \\"Wulff\\" Scherchen in Berlin, the son of the German conductor Hermann Scherchen. Britten and Scherchen first met at the International Society for Contemporary Music Festival in Florence in March 1934, when Scherchen was 13 and there only because of his father's professional commitments. The 20-year- old Britten was there to attend performances of his own music. They became friends, even sharing one raincoat between the two of them in the Siena rain, but did not stay in contact after the festival. In 1936 Wulff Scherchen's mother brought him to England, to escape the rise of Nazism in Germany, where they settled in Cambridge and he attended the Perse School. On discovering Scherchen was in England, Britten invited him to visit his home, an old windmill in Suffolk. A romantic friendship developed, as attested to by the large quantity of extant but unpublished correspondence. In 1939 Britten went to the US with Peter Pears, ostensibly for work but also to escape the entry of Great Britain into World War II. While Britten was away. Scherchen was offered a place to study engineering at Queen Mary College, London (which had been evacuated to Cambridge), but in May 1940 he was arrested, interned as an enemy alien and shipped to Monteith POW Camp in Canada. Their correspondence continued, though hampered by the war's censors and unreliable delivery. His frustration at being interned is clear, and he is embarrassed to ask Britten to send him clothing, books, and money for toothpaste. To obtain his release, Scherchen voluntarily enlisted with the Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps in 1942, which required him to change his name. He returned to England and trained with the Royal Engineers as a bomb disposal expert. Britten and Scherchen met only once more, in 1942, but the relationship had not survived the long separation. Scherchen took the last name of a woman from the air force he had met, Pauline Woolford, and became known as John Woolford. They married in 1943. In the 1980s the couple emigrated to Australia where two of their four children had already been living. They were inseparable until Pauline Woolford's death in January 2016. Scherchen was the dedicatee of the song \\"Antique\\" in Britten's song cycle Les Illuminations (1939‚Äì40). Britten handed him a gift of a signed copy of the published score at their last meeting in London in 1942. Scherchen was also the inspiration behind Young Apollo, a work for piano and strings which Britten withdrew without explanation after only two performances in 1939. In 2015 the Australian composer Lyle Chan discovered that Wulff Scherchen was still alive and living in Australia. Chan met Scherchen, then aged 95, and obtained his consent to make a song cycle out of the letters between him and Britten, which chart their entire romantic friendship from their first meeting to the break-up of their relationship under the strain of Scherchen's wartime incarceration as an enemy alien. The Brisbane Festival presented the world premiere of the work, Serenade for Tenor, Saxophone and Orchestra (‚ÄúMy Dear Benjamin‚Äù) in September 2016, performed by the Queensland Symphony Orchestra.

C. BrƒÉtianu Street in Ia»ôi, Romania. It is dedicated to the Beheading of St. John the Baptist. In 1610, during the reign of Prince Constantin MovilƒÉ, a wooden church dedicated to Parascheva of the Balkans was built around the city's fish market. This was later moved to the site of the current church. Upon the insistence of his mother, the nun Elisafta, Prince Miron Barnovschi-MovilƒÉ began to build the latter from stone between 1626 and 1629. During his reign, the church was completed up to the top of the windows and a new dedication selected. Beheaded by the Ottomans in 1633, he did not live to see the church complete, as mentioned on a marble plaque above the foyer door. Instead, Vasile Lupu ensured it was finished. It has been suggested that Lupu performed the work out of remorse, as Barnovschi's execution was partly due to his insistences. Andi Emanuel Mihalache, History at the Ia»ôi County Cultural Office site When it was done in 1634, it was the first fortified church in Moldavia. The style forms part of the traditional Moldavian architecture, but the bell tower is endowed with parapets. The bridge is entirely fortified, with gaps for arrows and rifles, and a path for lookouts. Nicolae Pintilie, History at the Saint John the Baptist parish site It has been speculated that the Ottoman ban on repairing military buildings did not apply to churches. The bell, from 1628, is Barnovschi's gift, and was cast at Lviv. The church was associated with the local beggars' guild. Paul of Aleppo visited in 1653, writing that he saw displayed in the nave a portrait of Barnovschi on a white horse. In 1803, upon the request of Metropolitan , it became a dependency of the . Repaired in 1854 and 1873, the church had a small foyer added on the southwestern side in 1875. In 1913, the landowner Vasile Rusovici financed an extensive renovation that included a new fence, still in place. Other repairs took place in 1942, 1965 and, following the 1977 Vrancea earthquake, in 1984-1986, with a new round beginning in 2006. The school for church singers in the parish yard functioned until 1948, when it was shut down by the communist regime.

He won a silver medal in the javelin at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London. Athletics career =2012 Summer Paralympics= Naas took up athletics after being spotted by a coach whilst playing football. He took up the javelin, but dropped the sport in 2009 after a coach said he lacked the athleticism. He returned to the sport in 2010, taking up the javelin full-time. His results at local competitions saw him selected for the Iraq team at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London, where he attended training camps in Baghdad and Turkey. At the Games he entered the F40 category javelin event. There in his fifth throw he recorded a distance of 43.27m, a new world record that put him into the lead. On seeing the distance, Naas cartwheeled across the track before falling to his knees, to the delight of the crowd. Unfortunately for Naas he failed to win the event, after China's Wang Zhiming recorded a distance of 47.95m in his final throw to set a new world record and take gold. Despite being beaten into silver medal place the crowd responded with rapturous applause when he took to the podium to receive his medal. Buoyed by the reaction at London and having won one of only a handful of medals for his country, Naas believed that he would return to his home a \\"...king of sport in Iraq\\" and a national symbol. The reality was very different. When he arrived back in Iraq, there was no one to greet him and he took a taxi alone from Baghdad airport to his home in Batha. He spent his prize money, given to him through various government sources, buying a plot of land in Batha. He was forced to return to work at his family's grocery stall, and now continues to train using rudimentary equipment, without a coach or training grounds. =2016 Summer Paralympics= At the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio, the International Paralympic Committee, despite just four years earlier choosing to create two different categories for athletes of short stature to create a fairer playing field, dropped Nass' F40 javelin event from the Games' schedule. Naas still qualified for the Games but he was again placed into the same grouping as the F41 athletes, and there was no points system used to give the F40 athletes greater weighting to their distances. This saw Naas fail to make the final eight, even though his second round throw of 35.29 metres was a new world record for the T40 class. A year later the same situation occurred at the 2017 World Para Athletics Championships in London. Naas qualified for the javelin throw (F41), this time finishing fifth behind the F41 athletes, with another world record of 38.90 metres.

It was released in January 1979 as the band's fourth single (reaching number 51 in the UK singles chart) and appeared on their second album, Chairs Missing.  Content  The song originally appeared on their 1978 album Chairs Missing. The song is based on Graham Lewis's fascination with the Serpentine leaf miner insect and details the life cycle of the insect. EMI recognised that the song could potentially be a hit single, but were concerned that it was too short, measuring only 1 minute 45 seconds. Unusually the label asked the band to make a longer version for the single. The band added an additional verse and chorus, and a piano solo played by producer Mike Thorne, pushing the length to 2 minutes 51 seconds. EMI were confident that the song could become a hit and commercial breakthrough for the band. The single soon entered the charts reaching number 51 and the BBC approached EMI and asked them to appear on the long running music show Top of the Pops if the single continued to rise. At the time Top of the Pops was one of the few opportunities for acts to promote their work on national television, with over 15 million viewers. However the British Market Research Bureau who compiled the UK Singles Chart claimed that there was an attempt to rig the chart by EMI personnel buying multiple copies of the single in chart return shops. Although EMI strenuously denied any attempts at rigging the chart, that weeks sales were not included. Despite selling twice as many copies as the previous week, these sales weren't included and subsequently the single dropped down the chart and Wire's chance to appear on Top of The Pops disappeared along with their chance to reach a wider audience. Wire's place was instead taken by Donny and Marie Osmond who were in London for a concert. Reviewing the single for the NME, Charles Shaar Murray wrote \\"This record is white and shows the dirt. Its surface is injured but rarely hurt. Guitars twang, keyboards ching, a voice intones. It is 3.55, your reviewer groans. It sounds soft and squishy, I can't hear the words. Time passes, how absurd. This group are overrated your correspondent demurs ... sod it I'm bored.\\" Cover versions \\"Outdoor Miner\\" has been covered by several artists. Notable versions include Lush in 1992, Flying Saucer Attack in 1994, The Lightning Seeds and Luna in 1996. In a unique move, a tribute album to the song was released in 2004 on the 25th anniversary of the song, A Houseguest's Wish: Translations of Wire's \\"Outdoor Miner\\" features 19 different interpretations of the song. As well as the Lush and Flying Saucer Attack covers, it features covers by Sharron Kraus, Boy Division and Adam Franklin amongst others.

She has lived in the United Kingdom since the early 1960s. She became the lead singer of The Serenaders and often travels back and forth from the Caribbean Islands performing as a reggae and soca artist. History Born and raised in Jamaica, the young gospel singer Curtis left St. Ann's, Jamaica in the 1960s as a teenager for a better life and education in England. She continued her musical career from her new home in Highbury and Islington, London. Whilst studying in college in the 1970s, Curtis sang in many local bands before she decided it was time to seriously pursue her singing career. =1970s= Yvonne Curtis with the Serenaders in 1978 A local recording producer needed a backing vocalist for his musical project and a contest was held in Stockwell, South London. Having been advised to enter, the young Curtis came second in the contest to her best friend who came first from which producer took them both on asking them to conduct vocals session works. During the mid-1970s Curtis joined a local band called the Okendoes and Chalis thereafter to which she found no real success. After many different small projects in 1975 and no real commercial success she began working with a record label called Third World Music under Shelly Barrett aka Count Shelly who released Curtis's first song entitled \\"What's Your Name\\" which was an instant success. Things began moving and she soon left Third World Records to sign with London's Empire Records which was a subsidiary division of Jamaica's Channel One Studios with whom she released another hit song called 'Convenient Woman', written by Curtis. After two years she left Empire Records to release her own single called 'No Charge' which was on World Sounds Records before joining a successful Reggae band called The Serenaders who were signed to Brown's Music Records. The first release by this band was a single entitled 'Only for Lovers' and soon after came 'Sweet Loving' which was a successful hit song written by Curtis. The song did extremely well and caused a huge demand for her tours and performances globally. During 1994 she travelled to (Germany), Nicaragua and Brazil creating a fan base and was performing for the Warehouse Showcase show which was televised for the UK's, London's Carlton Television to which she also appeared. In 1998 she appeared with Pete Campbell on The Big Breakfast on Channel 4 and featured in songs by the Reggae Boys. During this time she was constantly writing and recording songs under Brown's Music & World Sounds Records both as a solo artist and under the band named 'Wavet' which included further performances at the Royal Albert Hall in London. =The mid-2000s= In year 2000 The Serenaders fell apart upon the death of three of its members and Curtis went back to World Sound Records to continue recording her new songs. In 2013 on a joint venture with Browns Records she released an album entitled 'Lets Unite in Love' which was distributed VP Records in the US. The album was an instant success and caused a notable demand for Curtis' music worldwide. In 2015 Curtis met record producer and label owner Mark Anthony Blak Prophetz and joined Digital Jukebox Records in 2015. The first release was a three CD compilation of her greatest hits, followed by a crossover version of the Christmas medley ‚ÄòWhen a Child is Born‚Äô & ‚ÄòMary's Boy Child‚Äô. John Nolan, a journalist and reviewer for 'Reggae in New York' spoke very highly of the album's success in the United States, stating, \\"Often the most talented artists go for decades without the commercial recognition they deserve. Despite her lack of commercial success Curtis is a driving force in reggae music with an evolving sound that has spanned the entire reggae spectrum. Since 1978 she has released 11 albums, as well as numerous compilations and singles.\\". =Today= Curtis goes back and forth from Jamaica, the Caribbean to London and has found her home with Digital Jukebox Records and is continuing to release and write new songs with her producers. During a radio interview in Gloucester by presenter Perry Jay for the Reggae Time Show, Jay described the show as absolutely fantastic stating how the crowds would continuously sing her songs back to her in appreciation.\\" In a recent interview by Yasmine Peru writer for The Gleaner, she spoke of the success of Yvonne's global hit song 'Sweet Senation', its success and how she was initially introduced to the UK's music executive Mark Anthony (Blak Prophetz) owner of Digital Jukebox Records in 2015. Yvonne was a regular act on the weekly Carlton Television Show - called 'The Warehouse' which was presented by British comedian Miles Crawford in the mid 80's where she was and still is considered one of the hardest-working Jamaican female reggae vocalist in the business. Through her challenges on the road to recognition and her soon-to-be-released documentary, Untold Reggae, which traces her life from her roots in Steer Town, St Ann, to the present, Yvonne is very excited about her future and return to perform in South America. During the following month she was interviewed by Jerade James for Future Topic Magazine & Black British Musicians reminising her performance at the London's Royal Albert Hall for the Barbados Independence during the mid 90's function along with other reputable Soca music artists like the Mighty Gabby & Grynner.

The division was created in June 1949 by the Regulation of the Re- Designations of All Organizations and Units of the Army, issued by Central Military Commission on November 1, 1948, being formed from the People's Liberation Army 5th Independent Brigade. The division's history can be traced to 2nd Independent Brigade of the Jinzhong Military District, formed in October 1948. Though the extent of the service of the 21st Division would be limited, it would participate in the Chinese Civil War through support of other divisions, such as those in the Taiyuan Campaign. The division would participate in the Battle of Weinan in before it would be moved to southern China to continue minor operations there until the end of the Civil War. In March of 1950, the 21st Division participated in the construction of the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway in central China. The division would be dissolved in October 1950, before the railway was completed in October 1952, to become the similarly short-lived 4th Artillery Training Base, the predecessor to the 31st Artillery Division.  Structure  The 21st division was part of the North China military region, the successor to the Chinese former Beijing Military Region, and the current Northern Theater Command. For the time of its service, the division was part of the 1st Field Army of the Chinese 7th Army. From its creation in 1949 to its disillusion in 1950, the division was composed of three separate regiments. Those being: * 61st Regiment; * 62nd Regiment; * 63rd Regiment. Leading the division was the division's brigadier, Fan Zhongxiang (). Fan, an early member of the Chinese Communist Party, became the 21st division's sole brigadier from its creation in 1949 until its disbanding in 1950. A participant on the Long March, Fan would become one of the People's Republic of China's founding generals in 1953 after his career in leading the 21st division and its successor, the 31st Anti-tank Artillery Division. During the Korean War, Fan was awarded the rank of Major General while still retaining his role as brigadier of the 21st Division's successors until his retirement in 1982. The political capabilities of the division were led by Li Jianliang () as its political commissar. Li, along with Fan, took part in the Long March, though Li took part in the Second Sino-Japanese War as part of the infamous Eighth Route Army before his service in the 21st Division. Though the division did have multiple commanders under the central command of Fan Zhongxiang and Li Jianliang, two of the division's best known commanders include figures such as Li Yuanming () and Duan Shikai ().263x263px  Service  With much of its early leadership and base of soldiers from Shanxi, the division would be sent to participate in the larger capture of Kuomintang- controlled territory across neighboring Shaanxi in early- to mid-1949. Gradually, the area around the city of Weinan was captured by the 21st Division and its allies, only facing minor fighting as the city itself was fully captured by about the middle of the year. The city, previously faced with a Communist insurgency, housed little resistance as time went on and the general advance of the People's Liberation Army continued. After the fall of Weinan, the 21st Division was moved to South-Western China, facing little combat in the areas already controlled by the People's Republic of China. By the time of the war's end, the division was sent to Gansu, where it would participate in the construction of the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway, a sub-section of the Longhai Railway that would be completed in 1953. Included as part of the so-called \\"trailbreakers\\" () of the railway, being some of the first to participate in its construction and expansion.  Dissolution  The division was led as part of the 1st Field Army of the People's Liberation Army's 7th Army. Despite it only being in service for two years, in October 1950 it was disbanded to become the similarly short-lived 4th Artillery Training Base, becoming the 31st Anti-tank Artillery Division after that. Many of the commanders of the 21st Division would still be involved either in the division's successors, or would be involved in larger roles as part of the 7th Army itself. An example being Duan Shikai, a commander of the 21st division who would become the director of the political department of the 7th Army itself later.

Biography  Boris Naumovich Ginsburg was born on June 21, 1933 in the city of Krivoi Rog. He spent his youth and his brief life in Kiev. From 1941 to 1944, together with his mother and younger sister, he was evacuated to Krasnodar and later to Turkmenistan. In 1947 the family joined their father in Magadan, where Boris spent his childhood years. His talent for drawing, discovered in early childhood, brought the young man to T.G. Shevchenko Kiev Republican Art School. Having graduated, he entered the Graphic department of the Kiev Art Institute (1952‚Äì1958). He was fortunate to have V. Kasiyan and I. Pleschinsky as his tutors, and A. Paschenko, a famous Ukrainian graphic artist and a talented teacher, as his thesis supervisor. He graduated from the Art Institute with the honours degree and in the same year the twenty-five-year- old became the member of the Union of Artists of Ukraine. While still a student, his works were exhibited at Ukraine and USSR wide exhibitions. They attracted the attention of laymen and specialists alike with their perfection of form, profound meaning and accomplished craftsmanship. During his brief life the artist managed to create, monumental in their stature and execution, a series of lithographs dedicated to creative labour: \\"About People of Work\\" (1957‚Äì1958), \\"The New Ukrainian Semiletka Buildings\\" (1959‚Äì1960), \\"People of the Semiletka\\" (1960‚Äì1961) Like the majority of Ukrainian artists of the time, he engaged with the literary classics, creating a series of works dedicated to T. Shevchenko (1961‚Äì1962), illustrations to the great poet's works and to L. Ukrainka's poetry. Despite these considerable achievements for a budding artist, in 1960-1962 he continued to study at the creative workshops of the Academy of Arts of the USSR in Kiev, under the patronage of the National Artist of the USSR Michail Deregus.  Work  Steelmakers. 1957 Waiting for a Suburban Electric Train. 1960 The artist was destined to create his entire legacy in just five years. There was no early, middle or late period in his professional life. This established gradation was compacted into five short years filled with creative search, struggle with humdrum existence, faith in his talent and irrepressible strive for perfection. At the time there were neither monographs nor extensive articles in art journals dedicated to his work, as he was just a budding young artist. All this and recognition, success and fame were just a beckoning alluring dream then. And it all was bound to happen to the artist, as, with his thesis alone, he revealed his great talent to the world. His thesis series of easel graphic works \\"About People of Work\\" (1958) demonstrated not only a rather high level of academic proficiency, but also Boris‚Äô own perspective on the obligatory, in those days, depiction of socialist everyday life. He brought a personality to the foreground of his graphic sheet, abandoning the stereotype of portraying \\"an ordinary soviet man\\". For the six completed lithographs of the series the artist created numerous sketches, demonstrating a wide variety of the compositional ideas and subject interpretations. Alongside genre drawings, the artist completed portraits in coal, creating an expressive gallery of manly, proud and intellectual images of steelmakers. \\"The New Ukrainian Semiletka Buildings\\" (1959‚Äì1960) is also a lithographic series, created on a commission by the Union of Artists, in which, alongside the key moments of Kremenchug Hydro Electric Station construction, a lot of attention is paid to the rank and file participants of the grandiose building project. In this series the artist emphasizes images of women, as if juxtaposing the beauty and fragility of the female figures with the surrounding construction giants. The artist also remained true to the humanistic concept of art in the third lithographic series \\"The People of Semiletka\\" (1960‚Äì1961). \\"Reminiscence of the Black Sea\\" became the most vivid and the most unconventional of the series. Through the prism of his depicting the fishermen's work one could clearly observe the unmistakable romantic notes of the European art tradition. Not only was Boris Ginsburg a master of lithography, he also had a perfect command of watercolour technique; he sensed its specificities and masterfully varied intense and serene colours. It gave the artist an opportunity to create, amazing in their execution, watercolours of sea views, piers and ships at anchor. Crimean landscapes always excited Boris‚Äô creative imagination. The biggest attraction for him was the subtle beauty of Koktebel, which had become a magnet for creative circles when Maximillian Voloshyn settled there. The artist's refined personality, as if merging with the translucent watercolours, was expressed in the lyrical landscapes, imbued with gentle crystal fragility. The Three Ships. 1962 Although for the artist the sea was not only primordial beauty imbued with inimitable harmony, but also a dwelling place of the manmade objects- the ships. In depiction of the latter he predominantly employs graphic techniques: coal sketching, graphite pencil, drypoint print, etching and linocut print. He is unsurpassed as regards compositional variations in depicting ships or fishermen's life. Every sheet is representative of the original nonrecurring compositional scheme, the most corresponding to realizing each concrete artistic idea. The lyrical nature of the artist's character, to a great extent, defined his perspective on the interpretation of the soviet woman- worker image. Remaining confined to the unavoidable industrial themes of the official commissions, he first and for most emphasizes the femininity in his fish factory workers, helmswomen, attendants and electricians. Even the drab shapelessness of their working uniforms is powerless to conceal it. Every work reveals to the viewer a \\"soviet Madonna\\"; slightly mysterious with her hint of a smile and averted daydreaming gaze. Perhaps she is not always beautiful, but inimitably unique, and thusly so attractive. Zoya. 1959 However, his favourite and most frequently portrayed model was his wife Zoya. He could draw her endlessly: at the seaside, sleeping, lying sick in bed with a high fever, running to the skating rink, reading a book, dreaming, sad, leaning over her textbooks and exhausted after a busy working day. Everyone expresses his love as he can: writing poems, bringing flowers, showering with gifts. Boris Ginsburg expressed his love with what he knew best: his countless portrait drawings of his young wife. Amongst his works there also were commissioned portraits of outstanding historical personalities: Nikolay Przhevalsky, Victor Hugo and Heinrich Heine. For each one he managed not only to convey the portrait features, but also recreate a characteristic emotional image, as some echo of their famous literary masterpieces or scientific achievements. Gardens in Bloom. 1960 His amazing ability to see beauty in the mundane was reflected in the artist's approach to the landscape. His pencil drawings are, indeed, unique in their invocation of the post war Kiev atmosphere. Old wooden cottages, curved streets, infrequent cars, Kudryavsky Descent, Andreevsky Descent, Podol; on these sheets the quiet city life of the 1950s is forever preserved on these sheets by the keen hand of the artist. Incidentally, whatever genre Boris Ginsburg employed, he always found the trappings of life quite odious. So it is not by chance, that his cityscapes are always genuine and authentic; they win the viewer over with their sincerity and spirituality. Boris Ginsburg is also concise and even fragmentary in his landscapes- miniatures. What is meant here is not size. A little forest clearing, lonely oak trees or pines on the edge of a meadow, a delicately lacy tree brunch in early spring; everything is imbued with the solemnity of being, affirmation of the beauty of the mundane. An apple tree in bloom, a little bridge over a stream and a village street are all elevated to the eternal and the beautiful in the eye of the artist. Every nation, every people has its own eternal cultural values. For the Ukrainians they are first and foremost Taras Shevchenko's and Lesya Ukrainka's poetry. The Poet's Destiny. 1962 Boris Ginsburg was inspired not only by the literary works of the Great Kobzar, but also by his tragic destiny. It resulted in the creation of printed lithographs reflecting the most dramatic moments from the poet's life, when he was exiled by court order to a distant military outpost and banned from writing and drawing. To some degree it was reminiscent of the events in Boris Ginsburg's own life. In the artist's private archive there is a small notebook with sketches of numerous searches for various characters from T. Shevchenko's poems. The only completed works were created for the poems \\"The Owl\\" and \\"The Neophyte\\". The illustrations to Lesya Ukrainka's poems \\"The Sinner\\" and \\"In the Catacombs\\" are imbued with the unvanquished spirit. It's no coincidence that of all her poems the artist chose the ones with main themes of strong spirit, freedom or striving to break out of slavish submission even by paying the ultimate price of one's own life. These were the last works in Boris Ginsburg artistic career. \\"It is very difficult to make people, who did not know Boris, his inner world, fine sense of humour, cheerful laughter and secret sorrow in his eyes, encyclopaedic knowledge, complete and utter helplessness in day to day life and constant process of creative search to understand. It is a complicated task, but it is also my duty, so I will try.\\" It was an introduction to the memoirs written by Boris Ginsburg's widow Zoya Davydovna Ginsburg. It was exclusively due to her efforts, her amazing charm and energy (despite her quite advanced years) that the name of Boris Ginsburg was brought back from oblivion. She became the main instigator and organizer of three personal exhibitions (1964, 2010, 2013), the author and sponsor in creating an album dedicated to the artist life's work \\"Boris Ginsburg, A Bright Light of a Short Life.\\" Zoya Davydovna also wrote the most touching chapter of this book: recollections of their youth, which are paramount to coming close to understanding the work and personality of Boris Ginsburg, feel his living presence, hear his words, comprehend his ideas, share his emotions and joy brought on by first success. These were the first steps of his creative life, such a promising beginning...

It was released in Japan by Toho on August 6, 2016. Plot Rudolf is a domestic little black cat from the little town of Gifu (region of Chubu, the center of Japan) who never left his home, being cared for by the child Rie, his owner. When Rie's mother asks her to visit his grandmother to take her food, Rudolf follows Rie out of the house in the wish to know the world outside the home. But when Rudolf runs afoul of a fishmonger, running away and gets inside a trailer of a truck, he's knocked out cold by a broom the fishmonger threw. When Rudolf wakes up and gets out from the trailer to explore, he meets \\"Gottalot\\", a big bobtailed street cat who lets Rudolf sleep under a temple. The next morning, Gottalot and Rudolf traverse the town, as Rudolf learns that Gottalot was given a lot of names by the people he encountered, but when he asks Gottalot if he was a pet cat, he leaves in a huff. Soon after, Rudolf encounters another cat by the name of Buchi with a habit of imitating martial arts moves and yelling \\"Hyah\\", who tells Rudolf that Gottalot was known as the Junk Tiger. He also tells Rudolf about a dangerous dog by the name of Devil. As Buchi offers to let Rudolf hang around his house, he explains Gottalot's fight against a Doberman, who threatens to tear his ear off if He returns. Buchi cuts the story short when He sees a beautiful Siamese cat and goes after Her, but says goodbye to Rudolf. Returning to the temple, Gottalot after learning that Buchi told Rudolf about his past, Gottalot explains that next to Devil's house is where His owner used to live until He went to the United States, leaving Him. but taught Him one thing, the ability to read. After Gottalot and Rudolf encounter Devil, Gottalot explained that since He became a stray, Devil looked down on Him. After Meeting up with Buchi, Gottalot and Rudolf infiltrate the school and enter a classroom, where Rudolf and Buchi become intrigued with the books, encouraging Rudolf to learn to read as Gottalot says that Rudolf will also need to learn how to write. the days went by as Rudolf learned to read, write and understand the Japanese characters. one day, when one of the teachers is watching TV, Rudolf sees His hometown, which is Gifu, which is known for the cable cars and castles. despite knowing that Gifu is over a hundred miles away, Rudolf decides to find a way to get home, by going into a truck heading for Gifu, but what He entered was a freezer truck. Gottalot and Buchi chase after the truck and retrieve Rudolf (frozen in a small block of ice) and free Him. but Gottalot berates Rudolf for almost freezing to death. Autumn came, and when a poster about a tour bus to Gifu, Rudolf and Gottalot ask Buchi, who becomes enticed to a Scottish Fold Cat named Misha who tells them that the Bus will come at November 10 on 6:30 AM. later in the day, Gottalot was injured by Devil. So, Rudolf tells Buchi to watch over Gottalot as He alerts the schoolteacher and leads Him to Gottalot, the teacher says that Gottalot is still alive as He brings the injured cat to a doctor for medical attention. Buchi explains to Rudolf how Gottalot got hurt. the schoolteacher then tells the cats that Gottalot will stay with Him as He'll need to rest for 2 weeks. In the Schoolteacher's house, Gottalot apologizes for making Rudolf worry, as Rudolf thanks Him for watching over Him as He says goodbye. Rudolf then faces Devil in a fight and despite Devil having the home advantage, Rudolf (with Buchi's fake out) beats Devil. but since Devil can't swim, He asks for help. Rudolf and Buchi then make Him swear that He won't bully any cat ever again, to which Devil agrees to. Rudolf returns to Gottalot, who says that the tour bus left, so He won't be going back to Gifu. as the month's pass, Gottalot is fully recovered but isn't coming outside much. At spring, Buchi and Misha are dating, and Devil calmed down after their fight and explained that before Gottalot's owner moved away, Gottalot and Devil were good friends, but they broke off when Gottalot became a stray. Devil then has Rudolf give His food to Gottalot as a token of His apology. Later, Gottalot then helps Rudolf learn about the license plates of cars, signifying where They come from, along with Chinese text. One night, Gottalot explains that He'll be going to the United States, shocking everyone, since Gottalot's owner isn't going to return to his house as it is being remodeled.

Coblentz. It was first published in Amazing Stories magazine in 1931 and first published in book form in 1958 by Avalon Books. The novel is a satire on the American economic and political system as they existed in 1931. Plot In the Eight Hundredth Millennium the sun is fading and Earth is freezing over. Humanity needs a new home if it is to survive and Venus has been chosen for exploration. Seven expeditions have gone to Venus and vanished: now the eighth is leaving. Physicist Erom Reve discovers, to his dismay, that his traveling companion will be Daolgi Kar, a self-styled poet who brings his little dog Tippy. Reaching Venus, the men must bail out of their spacecar before meteors destroy it. They descend under electric parachutes and then make their way across the alien landscape until they come to a city, where they are captured and put into a zoo. Over several weeks they learn the rudiments of the Venusian language. After convincing the Venusians that they are not animals, the two men (with Tippy) are sent to prison for entering the nation of Wultho illegally. There they refine their knowledge of the local language and customs. After a year Erom and Daolgi are sent to work in a sawdust factory. Daolgi‚Äôs inattention to his job leads to a fire that burns down the sawdust factory. In the confusion the two men and Tippy escape from the city and take refuge in the countryside. They end up living in a cave by the sea and Erom struggles to make green glass, the highest denomination of Venusian currency. When he succeeds in making two large chunks of it, he and Daolgi go to a village. They are given a hostile reception as vagabonds until Erom displays some green glass, then the villagers welcome him and Daolgi as Large Letter Men. When the Earthmen hear rumors of white-skinned giants terrorizing a distant continent, Erom arranges an expedition by airship to investigate his suspicion that the monsters are actually members of the previous expeditions from Earth. They arrive at a Wulthonian outpost and plunge into the jungle, where they find a small hamlet occupied by humans. Using a crude wireless telegraph, the explorers have gathered in all of the expeditions as they crash-landed on Venus and now they live in peace with their neighbors. Having already established himself as the owner of a town in Wultho, Erom convinces the others to come back with him and possibly find a way to contact Earth. With the help of two of the others, Erom returns to the seaside cave and makes a large quantity of green glass. He uses the new wealth to become the richest and most powerful man on Venus. Working in secret, Erom has a set of new spacecars built for him and his friends and he builds a radio capable of communicating with Earth. A foreign dignitary comes to his town and one of his companions inadvertently insults him, thereby triggering a planetwide war. Their greed for colored glass exceeded only by their eagerness to slaughter each other, the Venusians use a newly invented death ray in their orgy of self-annihilation. The humans, in their spacecars, head back to Earth to prepare for Humanity‚Äôs move to soon-to-be-depopulated Venus. Publication history *1931, USA, Radio-Science Publications, Inc.

He studied at the University of Oxford and became an Anglican curate in Oxford. He adopted High Calvinist opinions, and in 1831 gave a polemic sermon before the university in which he questioned received opinions on free will and salvation, and criticised the university and the Church of England for ignoring the principles of their faith and appointing unsuitable clergy in response to political influence. He then went on an outdoor preaching tour, and as a result was ejected from the Church of England. He formed his own nonconformist church and flirted with Irving's Catholic Apostolic Church before setting up a Strict Baptist chapel. Origins Henry Bellenden Bulteel was born at Plymstock in Devon on 14 September 1800, the fourth of ten children of Thomas Hillersdon Bulteel of Bellevue House in the parish of Plymstock in Devon, by his wife Anne Harris, a daughter and co-heiress of Christopher Harris of Bellevue (3rd son of John Harris of Radford in the parish of Plymstock).Prince, John, (1643‚Äì1723) The Worthies of Devon, 1810 edition, London, p.471, 1810 Notes Bulteel's ancestors had Huguenot origins and had founded the Naval Bank in nearby Plymouth, Devon, in 1774. His brothers went into the navy. Early years He attended Eton College, where one of his eyes was knocked out by a cricket ball. He matriculated at Brasenose College, Oxford, on 1 April 1818. As an undergraduate he gained a reputation for rowdiness, and once started a riot between \\"town and gown\\" (paying pupils and King's Scholars) during the disturbances over the attempted divorce of Queen Caroline. In 1822 he was stroke of the winning Brasenose boat in the race on the Isis. Oxford fellow and curate Bulteel obtained a bachelor's degree in 1822. and was elected fellow of Exeter College on 30 June 1823. In 1824 he rowed for his college as a Fellow of Exeter. He took his master's degree in 1824 and became curate of St Ebbe's Church, Oxford, in 1826. Bulteel was a member of the Oxford Auxiliary of the Church Missionary Society, as was John Henry Newman, who would later also leave the Church of England. He adopted high Calvinist and antinomian views. Bulteel's passion and intensity had great impact on his contemporaries at Oxford. For a short period William Ewart Gladstone fell under Bulteel's influence. On 5 February 1827 Thomas Byrth (1793‚Äì1849), then curate at St Clement's Church, Oxford, wrote that Bulteel \\"has created a most powerful sensation here, by preaching ultra-Calvinism, and circulating Dr Hawker's tracts.\\" Bulteel's evangelical views became so extreme that the university authorities banned students from attending his sermons. Joseph Charles Philpot, a high Calvinist and fellow of Worcester College, wrote, On 6 October 1829 Bulteel scandalized genteel Oxford by marrying Eleanor Sadler, a pastry cook and sister of Alderman C. J. Sadler, of High Street, Oxford. As was the custom, he then had to vacate his fellowship at Exeter. On 6 February 1831 Bulteel preached a Sermon on 1 Corinthians ii. 12 at St. Mary's, Oxford, before the University of Oxford. The sermon discussed predestination, free will, justification, and salvation. It included outspoken views on the state of the universities and the Church of England, and caused great excitement. William Gladstone wrote that he \\"always remembered among the wonderful sights of his life St Mary's 'crammed in all parts by all orders when Mr Bulteel, an outlying calvinist, preached his accusatory sermon (some of it too true) against the university. The sermon was printed and ran to six editions. Many replies and comments were published. In his sermon Bulteel said God \\"doth but reckon that such and such sinners shall become righteous, and, lo! they become righteous instantly, God bestowing upon them faith to lay hold on the robe of Christ's everlasting righteousness, and clothe themselves with these garments of salvation.\\" Righteousness was thus a gift of God rather than the result of a person's deliberate choice. He said that the thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England, which were meant to ensure that only spiritual men joined the ministry, were being ignored. Worldly sinners were allowed to enter the church as a result of political influence. He complained that the college and university authorities would not give proper recommendations to strong Calvinist graduates, but gave good recommendations to \\"men notorious for nothing so much in their day as profaneness, debauchery, and all kind of riotous living.\\" This could clearly be taken as a reference to his own appointment. He argued that the Church of England needed reform as much as the Church of Rome. In the summer of 1831 Bulteel toured the west of England. His friend William Tiptaft wrote, \\"We shall preach in churches, chapels, barns, rooms, or in the open air. We shall, if the Lord strengthens us for the work, give great offence. But it is a glorious work to preach the everlasting gospel. It is the very purpose for which I was ordained. Christ will not turn us out of His Church for following His steps in preaching the gospel in every city and village. I should not be surprised if the Bishop withdraw Bulteel's license as he is only a curate.\\" This last prediction proved accurate. Richard Bagot, Bishop of Oxford, revoked Bulteel's license on 10 August 1831. The churchwardens refused Bulteel access to his church. Bulteel accused the bishop of being \\"an officer of the Church of Antichrist\\" and said he could preach where he wanted without the bishop's permission. He continued to preach in Oxford outdoors, drawing large crowds. Later years Friends of Bulteel raised money and built a chapel for him at the back of Pembroke College, Oxford. The chapel was named St. Ebbe's Chapel, but was often called Bulteel's Chapel. He preached there based on the teachings of the Plymouth Brethren. The members of the congregation were called Bulteelers. St. Ebbe's Chapel later became the Commercial Road Baptist Chapel. In 1832 Bulteel visited London and attended the Rev. Edward Irving's chapel. He adopted some of Irving's ideas, and published a book that told how he had cured the illnesses of three women through prayers and intercession, and restored them to health. Bulteel was one of a small number of Evangelical clergymen who joined Irving's Catholic Apostolic Church. Benjamin Wills Newton, an early member of the Plymouth Brethren, was a friend of Bulteel, but turned against the Irvingites when Bulteel began to \\"heal\\" members of his congregation and to make bizarre theological speculations based on his religious experience. In May 1833 Bulteel became disillusioned with Irvine's teachings, and told John Hill of \\"his gracious deliverance from the awful delusions concerning supernatural gifts\\". He had come to consider that the gifts were false and that Irving's views on the human nature of Christ was incorrect. After leaving the Irvingites Bulteel set up a Strict Baptist chapel in Oxford. A well-written anonymous poem published in 1845 that denounced the Oxford Movement and John Henry Newman was attributed to him but is likely to be by Richard Burdon. Around 1846 Bulteel left Oxford, and seems to have joined the Plymouth Brethren. Henry Bellenden Bulteel died on 28 December 1866 in Plymouth at the age of 66. Publications  *.

In 1046, Magnus made his uncle Harald Hardrada joint monarch of Norway. The following year, Magnus died and Harald became sole King of Norway. Subsequently, Einar began moving against the increasingly unpopular and tyrannical King Harald. When her spouse and son were both assassinated upon orders by king Harald in 1050, Bergljot raised an army. They attacked the royal estate to kill the king as vengeance, but by then he had already fled.

The business moved next door to 107‚Äì109 Charing Cross Road in 2014, in a redevelopment of the old Saint Martin's School of Art building. The building was demolished in 2017. History The building was designed by the architects F. Taperell and H. Haase and built from 1927 before opening in 1929. It was at one time claimed to be the world's largest bookshop. William Foyle stated that it was \\"the world's first purpose-built bookshop\\", (although this is disputed), as well as the world's largest. In 1932, on hearing that the Nazis were burning books, William Foyle sent Adolf Hitler a telegram asking if he could buy them instead. During the Second World War, to safeguard the store from the effects of the Blitz, sandbags filled with old books were used, and the roof was \\"covered\\" with copies of Hitler's Mein Kampf. In an account in The Argonaut, \\"News reels this week are showing a clerk of Foyle's of London stacking copies of Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf in place of sand bags on the roof of the store as a protection against air raids!\\" In 1940, a bomb which landed in Charing Cross Road itself nearly destroyed the bookshop, and a bridge was built over the large crater, christened \\"Foyles Bridge\\" by William Foyle.

The genus is solely known from a single Eocene fossil found in North America. At the time of its description the new genus was composed of a single species named Ypresiosirex orthosemos. History and classification Y. orthosemos is known only from one fossil, a part and counterpart holotype, specimen number RBCM.EH2015.004.0001.001A&B;, which is housed in the collections of the Royal British Columbia Museum in Victoria, British Columbia. Ypresiosirex was described from a specimen which was recovered from outcrops of the early Eocene, Ypresian McAbee Fossil Beds near Cache Creek, British Columbia. The unnamed formation outcropping at the McAbee Fossil Beds preserve an upland temperate flora that was first interpreted as being Microthermal, although further study has shown them to be more mesothermal in nature. The plant community preserved in the McAbee Fossil Beds site is mostly broadleaf pollen with alder and elm dominating, and may represent a successional forest involving multiple volcanic ash eruptions. Ypresiosirex was first studied by the paleoentomologists S. Bruce Archibald from Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia and Alexandr Rasnitsyn of the A. A. Borissiak Paleontological Institute. Their 2015 type description of the new genus and species was published in the journal Canadian Entomologist. The genus name Ypresiosirex was coined by the researchers as a combination of Ypresian, the age of the fossil, and Sirex a horntail genus name. The specific epithet orthosemos is derived from Greek meaning \\"with vertical stipes\\", alluding to the corrugated texture of the wing membrane at its base. Ypresiosirex orthosemos was one of three sawfly species described in Archibald & Rasnitsyn's 2015 paper, the other two being Ulteramus republicensis and Cuspilongus cachecreekensis, from the Klondike Mountain Formation and the McAbee fossil beds respectively. Description The single described female of Ypresiosirex is mostly complete, missing the very apical section of the ovipositor. The female has a body length of approximately and an overall preserved length of with the partially preserved ovipositor included. The body is dark in coloration overall, with an area of the mid-abdomen possibly lighter, though the change in color may be the result of preservation showing the ventral color and not the dorsal color. The fore-wings show darkening near the base which grades to hyaline for the rest of the membrane. In some areas of the head and thorax preservation is detailed enough to show the surfaces had a patterning of shallow densely spaced pits. Placement of the genus into Siricidae was based on the modified abdomen tip which forms a cornus. The basal area of the wings shows distinct corrugation running from the leading edge to the rear edge, which is not seen in any other hymenopterans.

Athanasius and Cyrill Church Ss. Athanasius and Cyrill Church () is a Romanian Orthodox church located at 20 Sf√¢ntul Atanasie Street in Ia»ôi, Romania. It is dedicated to Saints Athanasius of Alexandria and Cyril of Alexandria. The church was built from 1672 to 1674; historian Gheorghe GhibƒÉnescu asserts that Prince »òtefan Petriceicu made contributions. An unconfirmed legend states that the builder was the former Patriarch Nectarius of Jerusalem. The ktitor has not been established; it may have been Atanasie Patelaros, administrator of Greek monastic properties in Moldavia. Short history at the Ss. Athanasius and Cyrill parish site The building was seriously damaged by fire in 1822 and 1844, and by bombardments during World War II in 1941 and 1944. The Vrancea earthquake of 1977 also caused damage, making new repairs necessary. The Vulpe Church was its filial for a time, and its priests served there between 1972 and 1997, when the building was closed. A cemetery functioned in the graveyard until 1946, when it was closed and all the headstones removed. Since 1997, the church serves as a chapel for the Orthodox women's society and for the nearby tuberculosis hospital. CƒÉtƒÉlina Mihalache, History at the Ia»ôi County Cultural Office site The church was built outside the old city walls, in a place known as the paupers' cemetery. Atop the vestibule, it has a single massive square spire, with five bells inside. Trefoil in shape, it has a foyer, vestibule, nave and altar; it is in the usual Moldavian style. The exterior walls are plastered and decorated with pilasters on two levels, one deep and the other in relief. Gheorghe Bal»ô noted the prettiness of the iconostasis. The entrance is to the south. Today, the interior walls are not painted, merely decorated with icons, but they appear to have been painted in 1855 by an artist from Sibiu. The church's valuables include two large 18th-century bells; a chalice from 1856; a silvered icon of the Virgin Mary from 1845; and 18th-century church books in Old Church Slavonic, Greek and Romanian Cyrillic. An 1847 icon of Sabbas the Sanctified was brought by the donor from Mar Saba in 1905. The icon of the church's painters is also of note, old and decorated in silver. In 1854, the first church choir in Moldavia was established here, after the Russian model. It was active for nearly six years, until the death of its founder, aga Evdochim Ianov; the initial director was Gheorghe Burada. The church is listed as a historic monument by Romania's Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs.

They made pedestrian controlled vehicles (PCVs) and ride-on vehicles between 1934 and 1961. The manufacturing of battery electric road vehicles was then sold on to Morrison-Electricar who continued to build two Electruk models for the dairy industry. Major purchasers of their products included Express Dairies and the London Co-operative Society. History TH Lewis Ltd were based in Watford, to the north-west of London, and worked closely with London's Express Dairy Company for many years. Express Dairies began retailing milk in 1858, and were based at Fetter Lane in central London. At the time, most of London's milk came from cowsheds situated within the city, but George Barham saw the potential of using the railways to bring milk to London from farms in the Home Counties. He founded the Express Country Milk Co. in 1864, pioneering improvements in hygienic milk production and improving its quality. His company became the Express Dairy Co. Ltd. in 1881, and he was knighted in 1904 for his services to the dairy industry. Mr Lewis began building milk floats, milk carts and horse-drawn vehicles for Express Dairies in 1873, and his business became a limited company in 1899. The first chairman of the new company was Mr. Titus Barham, George's son, who was chairman of Express Dairies from 1913 to 1937. From 1921, TH Lewis handled the maintenance of a fleet of steam wagons and motor vehicles owned by Express Dairies, and in 1931, the company was taken over by Express, as part of a reorganisation of their business. Maintenance of vehicles used for retailing was split off from those used for the collection and distribution of milk, and the first electric milk floats were purchased. TH Lewis were responsible for their maintenance, along with horse-drawn floats and push carts used in the delivery of milk. They then designed two types of electric vehicle for Express, the first of which entered service in 1934. A 4-wheeled pedestrian controlled vehicle, registration number RVW 723, operated by A J Brackin & Sons, at Victoria House Corner, Hadleigh, Essex, around 1969 They produced a 3-wheeled pedestrian controlled vehicle (PCV) with a 3.5 cwt payload. The chassis was made of steel channel, and was of welded construction. A 128 Amp-hour battery was fitted, and it did not include a speed controller, but had a fixed speed of on level ground. The battery drove a motor which was connected to the rear axle by reduction gearing, and the controls included a clutch. This configuration gave a range of around , and all electrical wiring was installed in conduits. By 1943 they were producing a ride-on 3-wheeled vehicle, suitable for use in hilly districts. It had a single speed of , and operation of the control contactor was by rods which were fixed to the handle bar. Operation of the parking brake ensured that the contactor was disabled. The series traction motor drove the front wheel through a spiral bevel reduction gear. The standard battery fitted was of 144 Amp-hour capacity, and gave a similar range to the PCV, but with an increased load of 6 cwt. In his summary of all models available during the war, Hills makes no mention of a Lewis Electruk 4-wheeled design. In addition to manufacturing and servicing for Express Dairies and other companies, TH Lewis took on the role of distributor and service agency for vehicles made by Northern Coach Builders (later Smith Electric Vehicles) in London and the south east. To assist in this task, they maintained servicing depots in London and in Bromley, Kent. They produced a new model for the 1954 Dairy Show, which was marketed as the Electruk Rider 25 cwt model. The chassis was constructed out of box-section beams, with the batteries mounted on either side between the wheels. The motor was mounted in the centre of the vehicle, and drove the rear axle through double reduction gearing. A 16-cell Tudor battery was fitted as standard, and its 161 Amp-hour capacity gave a range of around . Power for the motor was supplied by a mechanically operated controller, while the hydraulic brakes were manufactured by Lockhead, and the cam-operated steering gear by Bishop. One unusual feature was that the steering wheel was mounted vertically, but this enabled the cab to be relatively short, improving visibility for the driver. The model showcased included a full width dairy cabinet behind the cab, divided vertically by a shelf, and fitted with two windows on either side. In 1955, Express Dairies required more of this type of vehicle than the manufacturing facilities at TH Lewis could produce, and they therefore asked Ross Auto Engineering Ltd, who were based in Southport, Merseyside, to produce 168 vehicles to the same design as the Electruk 10 cwt Rider Pram. These vehicles carry a Helecs Vehicles Ltd chassis plate, but in all other respects were identical to the vehicles made by TH Lewis. They were one of the first companies to provide storage for dry goods on their vehicles, and demonstrated a type AER float with a grocery box behind the cab at the 1955 Dairy Show. The box included an ice compartment, to keep the goods fresh in hot weather. Their exhibits at the 1958 Dairy Show included a standard 25 cwt milk float with a walk-through cab and a vertical steering wheel, which was fitted with a contactor-type controller. They also featured a chassis with a hydraulically actuated carbon- pile controller, designed to give smoother starting. The controller was still in the design phase, but was expected to be available as on option on vehicles in early 1959. =Acquisition= The company was acquired by Austin Crompton Parkinson, the parent company of Morrison-Electricar, in 1961, and Morrisons continued to make two of their models. These were the Electruk Rider, which could be driven while standing up or from a high bench seat, which became the model E15, and a pedestrian controlled vehicle, which became the model DPC3. Both Express Dairies and the London Co-operative Society had large fleets of the Electruk Rider, and continued to add to them with purchases of the E15. Express Dairies had a fleet of some 2,200 milk floats in 1963, which included 1,220 Electruk Riders and 180 Electruk pedestrian controlled vehicles. Preservation The Transport Museum, Wythall in south Birmingham has a fully restored Helecs variant of the Lewis Electruk on display, and owns the chassis of a second vehicle. They are believed to be the only two of the variants in existence, but the museum's website states that at least two of the vehicles built by TH Lewis are also still extant.

The prosoma is brown, with a bright median stripe, which has parallel margins with white hair. The sternum is dark brown and the legs are a uniform dark brown, almost black. The opisthosoma is dark brown with a slightly darker cardiac spot. The males are in length, the larger females . Male Habitat and ecology The spider lives in dry litter and bark in sunny coppiced areas or clearings in woods, on stony chalk grassland with a short sward, on burnt heathland (up to approximately four years after the heath has been burnt) or bare patches of ground in older heathland. X. nemoralis has occurred in large numbers in sparsely vegetated man-made sites, such as railway ballast, almost to the exclusion of other wolf-spiders. In mainland Europe, it can be found on the sunny edges of coniferous forest up to 1800 m above sea level. Female Xerolycosa nemoralis are known to excavate shallow depressions in soil.

The early 11th century Romanesque church was destroyed by the Mongols and rebuilt from the thirteenth to the fifteenth century. After the expulsion of the Turks the interior was redesigned between 1635 and 1650 by the Italian master Giovanni Battista Rava in the early Baroque style. The tower was completed only in 1680. The complete work of the church lasted until the 1770s The last restoration was carried out between 1968 and 1972. The cathedral obtained in 1997 the status of Minor Basilica, awarded by Pope John Paul II. Pulpit The pulpit belongs to the definitive period of the interior when the most important Baroque features were added under Bishop Count Ferenc Zichy in the 1770s. Its architect and sculptor remains unknown but it is attributed to Melchior Hefele. The classicizing late Baroque structure was built at the first pillar of the nave on the left side. It was made of red marble with a marble side stair supported by a pillar; the main support forms a Doric column with a fluted shaft. The pulpit itself is shaped like a shell with a solid parapet articulated by panels and pilasters and decorated with gilt wooden carvings of rosettes, bay leaf garlands and acanthus leaves. The wrought-iron railing was made in 1783 by a craftsman who incised the date and his initials (J.K.) into the doorway post. The railing and the door are richly decorated with roses, garlands, leaves and bows. The abat-voix is painted woodwork with dark yellow marbleizing, decorated with rosettes, brackets and leaves. On the underside there is a silvery dove surrounded by a meander strip; on the top an allegorical female statue representing the Church is holding a chalice and a church model. The canopy-like base of the statue is decorated with wreathes and it is surrounded by four putti holding the Tablets of Stone and the cross, flanked by flowering urns. The statues of the abat- voix were created in a more traditional Baroque taste than the other parts of the pulpit which already show the growing influence of Neoclassicism.Bedy Vince: A gy≈ëri sz√©kesegyh√°z t√∂rt√©nete, Gy≈ër, 1936, pp. 27 and 132 See also * Roman Catholicism in Hungary * List of cathedrals in Hungary * Assumption Cathedral (disambiguation), other cathedrals with the same dedication Internal view References Roman Catholic cathedrals in Hungary Buildings and structures in Gy≈ër Roman Catholic churches completed in 1770 Basilica churches in Hungary ","title":"Cathedral Basilica of Gy≈ër"},{"id":"51435091","text":"The Slatino furnace model is an ancient ceramic artefact excavated at an archeological site near Slatino in Bulgaria.

Biography Knowles matriculated at Downing College, Cambridge and graduated in 1905 with B.A. Receiving medical education at St Mary's Hospital, London, he was made M.R.S.C in 1907 and L.R.C.P. Lond. in 1907. As a British officer in the Indian Medical Service he was made lieutenant on 1 February 1908, captain on 1 February 1911, major on 1 August 1919, and lieutenant-colonel on 1 August 1927; upon his death in 1936 he held the rank of colonel. He became a professor of protozoology at the Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine in 1928. Knowles was the director of the Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine from 1933 to 1935; in the directorship his predecessor was Hugh William Acton and his successor was Sir Ram Nath Chopra. P. knowlesi Giuseppe Franchini published in 1927 what is generally believed to be the first description of the Plasmodium species now known as P. knowlesi. At the Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine, in 1931 H. G. M. Campbell detected P. knowlesi in a macaque imported from Singapore. Campbell showed his discovery to his supervisor L. Everard Napier, who injected the strain into three monkeys, one of which developed symptoms of malaria. Aware of the Protozoological Department's search for a monkey malaria strain, Napier and Campbell gave the infected monkey to the physician Biraj Mohan Das Gupta, working under Knowles. Das Gupta maintained the Plasmodium species by serial passage in monkeys until Knowles returned from leave. In 1932, Knowles and Das Gupta published their description of the Plasmodiium species and their account of how it could be transmitted from monkey to human by blood passage to three human volunteers. The Plasmodium species was named Plasmodium knowlesi by Sinton and Mulligan in 1932. The first natural infection of P. knowlesi in humans was observed in 1965.

He was an influential member of the north Midlands gentry, due to his own office holding as well as the fact that his family was a cadet branch of the powerful Stafford family, later Dukes of Buckingham. Early life and career Sir John Stafford was closely involved in the affairs of the senior branch of the baronial house, and his mother was a daughter of Ralph Stafford, 1st Earl of Stafford. Born around 1355,Richardson, D., Plantagenet Ancestry: A Study In Colonial And Medieval Families (2nd Edition, 2011), 220. in August 1373 Stafford made a 'highly advantageous marriage' with Maud Hastang of Leamington Hastings, Warwickshire, who was her father's heiress, and potentially a wealthy woman. Carol Rawcliffe has speculated that this marriage was arranged in order to strengthen the bond between the two branches. He spent the next few years expanding and consolidating his estates, both through inheritance (some from his father), purchase, and suit at Chancery. He worked closely with his brother Humphrey Stafford (died 1413), and probably served with him on the expedition to Flanders in 1373 with the second Earl of Stafford, who at some point in this period granted him an annuity of ¬£10 per annum. In 1383 he left for the continent again as part of Henry Despenser, Bishop of Norwich's attempted Crusade against the Antipope Clement VII. The campaign though, as Rawcliffe says, 'was abandoned within less than six months.' This appears to have been the last of his forays abroad; yet, unlike his brother, he sems to have held far fewer offices than could be expected. Rawcliffe tentatively suggests this could have been caused by a ' belligerent temperament.' For example, he was imprisoned for much of 1390 in the Tower of London. Later career Following the deposition of King Richard II, both branches of the Staffords supported the new king, Henry IV. Both Ralph and the new Earl of Stafford, Edmund assisted the suppression of the earl of Kent's rebellion in January 1400. They also took part in the invasion of Scotland that summer; this yielded little result and led, within a couple of weeks, to a swift return to England.Sadler, J., Border Fury: England and Scotland at War, 1296-1598 (Harlow, 2005), 296-7. Ralph also appears to have involved himself in his son's quarrels with Lord Bergavenny in Feckenham and was bound over with him in 1401. Death In Rawcliffe's words, his 'last years passed quietly enough,' and his last major involvement in politics was his attendance in the 1407 Staffordshire parliamentary elections. He died on 1 March 1410; his wife was already dead. His heir was Humphrey Stafford (died 1419).

Designed in early 1889 and constructed in late 1890 by Seattle Lodge No. 7 of the International Order of Odd Fellows and designed for use by all of the city's Odd Fellow lodges, it is the earliest known surviving work of Seattle architect William E. Boone and George Meeker and remains in an almost perfect state of preservation. The Barnes building has played an important role in the Belltown Community and Seattle's dance community. It was used by the Odd Fellows for 17 years before their departure to a newer, bigger hall in 1909 and was home to a variety of fraternal & secret societies throughout the early 20th century, with the Free and Accepted Masons being the primary tenant until their own Hall was built in 1915. The ground floor has been a host to a variety of tenants since 1890 ranging from furniture sales to dry goods to farm implement sales and sleeping bag manufacturing, most recently being home to several bars. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places as The Barnes Building on February 24, 1975.http://focus.nps.gov/AssetDetail/NRIS/75001853 History The Seattle Lodge No. 7 of Odd Fellows, first organized in 1876, had been meeting on this block since 1877 when Seattle pioneer and Belltown namesake William Bell had a hall constructed for their use on the lot where the Austin A. Bell Building currently stands. The cost of fitting out the hall was split evenly between Seattle's two major lodges, Olive Branch Lodge No. 4 and Seattle Lodge No. 7 and soon became host to numerous social & benevolent organizations. By the end of the 1880s Seattle Lodge No. 7 was the largest Odd Fellows lodge in the state with membership nearing 200. In early 1889, it was announced that the lodge planned to build a new substantial brick building on their lot. After reviewing several competing designs, they chose those of veteran architect William E. Boone, who at the time was partnered with George Meeker. The building, to cost $30,000 was to be four stories in height with a basement. The first floor would be devoted to a single retail space, while the second floor would have a large assembly hall in back with offices in front. The third and fourth floors would contain the Odd Fellows' meeting space and divided offices. While the plans for the building remained the same, the location would change slightly. The Odd fellows had purchased the lot immediately south of their hall and planned to move the building, which they had also purchased from the Bell family, onto the lot until finances permitted the construction of their new building. Construction finally began in late July 1890, just as the first wave of re-construction following the Great Seattle Fire was winding down. Despite the advancement of architectural styles in the wake of the fire, the Odd Fellows stuck with Boone's rusticated Victorian design. The old wooden hall was once again moved, to the corner of Depot and Wall streets where the lodge would continue to meet while their new building was built. The cornerstone was laid in a ceremony on August 27, 1890 with over 200 lodge members and onlookers present. A time capsule was placed within the cornerstone containing copies of the lodge archives and other historical documents. Construction progressed rapidly- The lodge was completely under roof by October, the ground floor was occupied by the Belltown Furniture Company by November and fraternal functions were being held in the building by December, although the main meeting hall wasn't fully in use until January 1891. Within a year the Belltown Furniture Company moved out of the first floor and the Seattle Dry Goods Store took its place, only for that store to go out of business by February 1893, likely a casualty of the Panic of 1893. The next tenant to occupy the ground floor around the turn of the century was the Seattle Vehicle and Implement Company, who sold Moline Wagons and John Deere implements. By the early 1900s, the Odd Fellows began to outgrow their space, with various lodges being forced to rent extra space around the city for their needs. In 1905 the leading lodges of Seattle purchased land in the Capitol Hill neighborhood and constructed a new lodge, completed in 1908. After the Odd Fellows' departure from their building in 1909 the lodge rooms remained in use by other fraternal organizations including the Loyal Order of Moose and the Free and Accepted Masons. At this point the building became known as the Masonic Temple until 1915, when the Masons too relocated to larger quarters on Capitol Hill. The other organizations remained and throughout the 1920s were joined by many social and religious organizations such as the Pentecostal Mission and the International Bible Students Association. During this time the building was referred to as Ingram Hall and became a popular place for dances and dance classes. A ghost sign on the rear of the building that advertises \\"Ballroom Dancing\\" can still be seen today. In the 1970s the building was home to the Seattle Dance Center, opened by the First Chamber Dance Company, Seattle's first resident professional ballet company. The building, now being referred to as the Barnes Building, was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 24, 1975 and became a city of Seattle Landmark in 1978. The building was occupied by the Belltown Pub on the ground floor from 2010 until its closure on May 28, 2019, with the owners citing high operating costs. The Screwdriver Bar currently occupies the basement while the upper floors are rented out as Class C office space.

He was notable for his command of the 80th Division during World War I. He also served as interim commander of IX Corps and commander of VI Corps after the war. In addition, his later command assignments included the Newport News Port of Debarkation, the Coast Artillery Training Center, and Third Corps Area. Cronkhite was the subject of national attention in the early 1920s when he advocated publicly for the investigation into the death of his son to be reopened; Alexander P. Cronkhite was an Army major stationed at Camp Lewis, Washington in 1918 when he died as the result of a gunshot. An investigation determined that the wound was accidental and self-inflicted; Cronkhite's public campaign led to the indictment of two soldiers who had been with Alexander Cronkhite at the time of his death. The 1924 trial of one ended in an acquittal, and charges against the second were dropped. Cronkhite's public campaign to renew the investigation brought him into disfavor with senior Army leadership, and he was retired against his wishes in 1923. After his retirement, Cronkhite lived in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area and became active in veterans' groups. He was also a frequent speaker at military reunions and other public events. Cronkhite died in Florida in 1937 and was buried at West Point Cemetery. Early life Adelbert Cronkhite was born in Litchfield, New York on January 6, 1861. His father was a surgeon in the Army, and Cronkhite was raised at military posts throughout the United States. He was appointed to the United States Military Academy from Arizona in 1878; he graduated in 1882 ranked 10th in his class, and was assigned to the Field Artillery branch. Start of career Cronkhite was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 4th Artillery Regiment and assigned to the garrison at Fort Warren, Massachusetts. He then attended the Artillery School at Fort Monroe, Virginia; after graduating, he remained on the faculty until 1888. In July 1888, Cronkhite was assigned to the garrison at Fort Trumbull, Connecticut. From May to October 1889 he served at Fort McPherson, Georgia, and he was assigned to Fort Barrancas, Florida until July 1890. Cronkhite was promoted to first lieutenant in the 4th Artillery in January 1889. From 1890 to 1891 Cronkhite served at Fort Riley, Kansas. From January to August 1891 he served in South Dakota during operations against Native Americans at the end of the Sioux Wars. He was Professor of Military Science at the Michigan Military Academy from 1891 to 1892. Cronkhite then returned to Fort McPherson, where he performed garrison duty until May 1893. He served at Fort McHenry, Maryland from 1893 to 1896, and then returned to Fort Riley, where he served until 1898. Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Cronkhite organized and trained units intended for combat overseas, serving at Jackson Barracks, Louisiana, Camp Thomas, Georgia, and Tampa, Florida. He served in Puerto Rico with the 4th Artillery during the second half of 1898, and took part in the Battle of Coamo. He returned to the United States for demobilization in Savannah, Georgia before traveling to his regiment's home base at Fort Riley. Cronkhite was promoted to captain in March 1899. Post- Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War After taking an extended post-war leave, Cronkhite performed garrison duty at Fort Terry, New York. From June 1899 to September 1901 he was assigned as adjutant of the School of Submarine Defense at Fort Totten, New York. (The School of Submarine Defense taught the use of torpedoes and naval mines for protecting harbors.) When the Artillery Corps was divided into Field Artillery and Coast Artillery, Cronkhite opted to serve with the Coast Artillery. From September 1901 to May 1904 Cronkhite was assigned to Fort Douglas, Utah as commander of the 22nd Field Artillery Battery. He then performed temporary duty as a quartermaster until July 1906. In November 1905, he received promotion to major. Cronkhite performed extended duty on the staff of the Army's Department of the East from 1906 to 1911, including inspector general, artillery officer, and coast defense officer. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in January 1909, and colonel in August 1911. From September 1911 to October 1914, Cronkhite commanded the garrison at Fort Totten. He was then assigned to command the Panama Coast Artillery District‚Äîthe coastal defenses of Panama and the Panama Canal Zone. He was promoted to brigadier general in May 1917, and major general in August 1917, and he remained in Panama until September 1917. World War I Cronkhite as commander of the 80th Division in World War I. As the Army expanded during its wartime mobilization, Cronkhite was appointed to command the 80th Division, an organization created with draftees from Virginia, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey. He organized and trained the division at Camp Lee, Virginia, and led it to France as part of the American Expeditionary Forces. He remained in command during the division's 1918 combat operations, including the First Battle of the Somme, the Battle of Saint-Mihiel and the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. Cronkhite commanded IX Corps from November 1918 to January 1919, and VI Corps from January to April 1919. He returned to command of the 80th Division in May so that he could lead it home to the United States for demobilization. Post-World War I Cronkhite returned to the United States in May 1919, and commanded the Newport News Port of Debarkation until September. His other post-war assignments included chief of officer classification for the Coast Artillery Corps, commander of the Coast Artillery Training Center at Fort Monroe and the coastal defenses of the Chesapeake Bay, and member of the Army's General Selection Board that determined which officers would be retained in the Army after the post-World War I demobilization was complete. In September 1920, Cronkhite was assigned to command Third Corps Area with headquarters at Fort Howard. From November 1920 to January 1921 Cronkhite served temporarily as military aide to Secretary of State Bainbridge Colby during Colby's extended mission in South America. Investigation into son's death Alexander P. Cronkhite as a West Point senior in 1915. Adelbert Cronkhite's son Alexander Pennington Cronkhite, nicknamed \\"Buddy\\", was a 1915 graduate of West Point. In October 1918, he was serving as a major commanding a battalion in a Camp Lewis, Washington engineer regiment. Major Cronkhite died of a gunshot wound while at a Camp Lewis training area; subsequent investigation determined that the wound was self- inflicted, and that it was accidental. Some members of Alexander Cronkhite's regiment talked among themselves and raised the possibility of suicide. Others suggested that a sergeant who was with Cronkhite at the time of his death might have been the shooter. Adelbert Cronkhite and his wife refused to accept the finding that the shooting was accidental. After hiring private detectives to re-interview witnesses and having a second autopsy performed, they were convinced that their son had been murdered. In Adelbert Cronkhite's view, the sergeant who was with his son on the day of the shooting (Roland Pothier) and the captain in temporary command of Alexander Cronkhite's troops at the time of the shooting (Robert Rosenbluth) were responsible. (Alexander Cronkhite was not in command on the day of his death because he was recovering after having been hospitalized with influenza.) 1918 photo of Alexander Cronkhite by Underwood & Underwood. Reproduced in Chicago Tribune, February 15, 1923. For two years, Adelbert Cronkhite attempted to have the War Department re-open the investigation. When this did not happen, he tried to convince the Justice Department to pursue the investigation and prosecute the two soldiers he believed to be guilty. The Justice Department eventually took up the investigation, and law enforcement agents were able to obtain multiple confessions from the sergeant who had been with Alexander Cronkhite at the time of the shooting; the sergeant implicated the captain who had been in temporary command. With no motive immediately obvious, Adelbert Cronkhite suggested that the killing of his son was part of a plot to ruin his, Adelbert's, reputation. Because the captain who was implicated was Jewish, members of the right wing press, led by Henry Ford's newspaper The Dearborn Independent, claimed that the shooting was murder, and that the captain had forced the sergeant to carry it out in the captain's supposed role as a \\"'German Jew Spy' and also a Bolshevik agent\\". The sergeant eventually repudiated his confessions, claiming they had been coerced. The agents who obtained them admitted to harsh interrogation techniques, so the confessions were excluded at the sergeant's trial in October 1924. With the prosecution case largely consisting of the argument that it was impossible for Alexander Cronkhite to have shot himself by accident, given the angle of the shot and the distance of the gun from his body when it was fired, their central claim collapsed when a friend of Alexander Cronkhite's, Eugene M. Caffey, and a second officer each demonstrated in court that an accidental shooting that fit the circumstances was not only possible, but that it was simple to recreate a plausible series of events which could have resulted in Alexander Cronkhite pulling the trigger by mistake. The sergeant was quickly acquitted; charges against the captain were soon dropped. Adelbert Cronkhite had refused to accept assignment as commander of the Panama Canal Zone so that he could continue to pursue the investigation into his son's death. This refusal, coupled with his public denunciation of the Attorney General for not pursuing the case rapidly enough, brought him into disfavor with the Secretary of War John W. Weeks and John J. Pershing, the Army Chief of Staff. As a result, Cronkhite was retired against his will \\"for the convenience of the government\\" in 1923. Awards Cronkhite received the Distinguished Service Medal for his World War I service. In addition, he was a recipient of the French Croix de Guerre with Palm and Legion of Honor (Commander), and the British Order of St Michael and St George (Knight Commander). In addition to his United States Army and international military awards, Cronkhite was also a recipient of the Virginia Distinguished Service Medal, which the governor and adjutant general presented to several individuals who commanded Virginia soldiers during World War I, including Philippe P√©tain and John J. Pershing. =Distinguished Service Medal citation= The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Army Distinguished Service Medal to Major General Adelbert Cronkhite, United States Army, for exceptionally meritorious and distinguished services to the Government of the United States, in a duty of great responsibility during World War I. General Cronkhite commanded the 80th Division during the Argonne- Meuse offensive, where he demonstrated great ability as a leader and proved himself a commander of initiative and courage. General Orders: War Department, General Orders No. 12 (1919) Action Date: World War I Service: Army Rank: Major General Company: Commanding General Division: 80th Division, American Expeditionary Forces Later life After retiring, Cronkhite lived in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area, was active in several veterans' organizations, and was a sought after speaker for reunions, Independence Day commemorations, and other ceremonies. Until the end of his life he argued that his son had not died accidentally, and that the murderers had gone unpunished. Death and burial He died in St. Petersburg, Florida on June 15, 1937. He was buried at West Point Cemetery, Section K, Site 26. Family Adelbert Cronkhite's father was Henry M. Cronkhite, a physician and Union Army veteran of the American Civil War who remained in the Army until retiring as a lieutenant colonel in 1895. His mother was Eleanor (Nellis) Cronkhite (1837‚Äì1892). He was the husband of Annie Estelle Pennington (1865-1932), the daughter of Army Brigadier General Alexander Cummings McWhorter Pennington Jr. Her other family members included grandfather Alexander C. M. Pennington Sr., a member of Congress from New Jersey, as well as other members of the Pennington family who served in offices including Governor of New Jersey and Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. In addition to their son Alexander, Adelbert and Annie Cronkhite were the parents of a daughter, Dorothy (1890-1954). Following the death of his first wife, in 1933 Cronkhite married Gertrude E. Horne of Pittsburgh. Gertrude Horne Cronkhite was active in veterans' organizations, and died in Pittsburgh on February 3, 1954. Published works In 1893, Cronkhite authored Gunnery for Non-commissioned Officers. This work was a compilation of information on cannons, ammunition, fuses, and other details necessary to master the use of artillery in combat. Legacy The Army honored Cronkhite by naming a Marin County, California Coast Artillery post as Fort Cronkhite in the late 1930s. The fort was abandoned after World War II. The site, which is now part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, includes the Marine Mammal Center. The remains of the military post also include a disarmed but intact 16-inch gun battery.

It is dedicated to Thomas the Apostle and to Catherine of Alexandria. The church was built in 1807 on the west face of Muntenimii Hill, offering a view over the northwestern part of the city. The initial ktitors were Toma Cozma and his wife Ecaterina; he was a local boyar who steadily rose through the ranks: »ôetrar, medelnicer, paharnic and ban. It has been suggested that he was of Roma origin. Andi Emanuel Mihalache, History at the Ia»ôi County Cultural Office site The church he built was small and simple in form, without spires. It was made a metochion of Iviron on Mount Athos, and was known as the church of the potters' guild. The next ktitorissa, Maria Anastasiu Apostol Ketreanca, added a bell tower during an 1847 reparation, as attested on a plaque on the western wall. It is this inscription that notes the 1807 construction date. However, the icon of Saint Thomas, to the right of the entrance, shows the ktitor as a paharnic, indicating a date for the icon before 1806, when he was elevated to ban. As icons were ordered near the point of a church's completion, it is possible the building was finished around 1804. Maria also expanded the vestibule, built a space for vestments on the south facade and a surrounding wall. Part of the vestibule ceiling collapsed in 1924. Repairs were undertaken in 1930-1932: the spire was rebuilt in brick, while exterior buttresses and an interior balcony for the choir were added. During World War II, the church was located in the vicinity of where German troops were quartered. On August 20, 1944, it was bombed and the altar area collapsed in flames. Repairs took place between 1950 and 1954. Following the 1977 Vrancea earthquake, the bell tower was reinforced in 1980-1982. The church is made of stone, in a trefoil plan, with two powerful buttresses. The altar and side apses are circular on the interior and exterior. There is a small foyer. Short history at the Toma Cozma parish site A primary school functioned near the church during the 19th century, giving rise to the name of the street on which it is located. Also, a boys' primary school where Ion CreangƒÉ taught was temporarily housed there. Eunuchs from the PƒÉcurari district formed part of the congregation. The Toma Cozma Popular Athenaeum was housed in the church in the first part of the 20th century. This institution hosted cultural meetings, edited a magazine, founded lecture halls and ran a choir and theater troupe. In 1929, it raised a monument to Mihai Eminescu that since 1957 has sat near the Central University Library. A. D. Xenopol was baptized in the church. The church walls feature nine large icons in 1837 by the Italian Giovanni Schiavoni, and ordered by Veniamin Costache. Another, showing Ss. Peter and John, is by Octav BƒÉncilƒÉ. The church's property includes liturgical objects such as a Gospel Book and 19th-century communion boxes, censers and crosses; sculpted candlesticks, pulpits and choirs; the carved oak iconostasis, richly ornamented and painted with neo- Byzantine icons; and the altar, with old icons and valuable liturgical books. It is rumored that in the past, the church owned a fragment of the Virgin Mary's dress and of Christ's burial shroud.

He was a mathematician and cryptanalyst during World War II at the Wehrmacht signals intelligence agency, Inspectorate 7/VI from 1941 to 1942 (which would later become the General der Nachrichtenaufkl√§rung. In 1942 he was transferred to the OKW/Chi Section IIb. His specialty was the production of codes and ciphers, and the security studies of Army systems. After the war he was director of the Astronomical Calculation Institute (German: Astronomisches Rechen-Institut) in Heidelberg, Germany. Life Walter Fricke was born in Leimbach-Mansfeld near Merseburg, Germany. His father was a carpenter who worked as a miner in the copper-schist mines at Mansfeld. Walter Fricke attended a high school Stephaneum in Aschersleben and passed the final examination (Abitur) in 1934. After high school, he enrolled as a student at Frederick William University in East Berlin, studying astronomy, mathematics and physics. His teachers there included Paul ten Bruggencate and August Kopff in astronomy, Erhard Schmidt in mathematics and Max von Laue in physics. In 1935, he published his first astronomy papers. These were critiques of Edwin Hubble's studies made at Mount Wilson Observatory on the distribution of spiral nebulae. In 1939, while resident at the G√∂ttingen Observatory, he received his doctorate with a thesis titled Influence of a resisting agent in the dynamics of dense stellar systems (Einflu√ü eines widerstehenden Mittels in der Dynamik dichter Sternsysteme). He obtained a scholarship to the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, which was arranged with the help of British theoretical cosmologist Dr George C. McVittie, which was due to start on 1 October 1939 but had to be cancelled because of the start of World War II in September 1939. On 1 May 1940 he started work at Hamburg Observatory, and later in that year was drafted into the Signal Corps (Nachrichtentruppe). On 15 May 1941 he was posted to Inspektorate 7, the cipher bureau of the Wehrmacht (German Armed Forces) high command, although as an astronomer he knew nothing about cryptography and cryptanalysis. Professor Otto Heckmann, director of the Hamburg Observatory, tried to lure him back to continue working on problems specifically related to war work that he had been occupied with before he was drafted: tables of air and ship navigation, aerodynamic problems for aeroplanes traveling at speeds over 1300 km/hour as well as rockets flying at speeds of more than 3000 km/hour. These were purely solutions to differential equations which were allocated to various institutions for solving. A minor planet discovered on 15 February 1941 by Karl Wilhelm Reinmuth in Heidelberg was named \\"1561 Fricke\\" in his honour. In 1942 he was appointed the assistant astronomer at the Hamburg Observatory at Bergedorf, but could only take the position up in 1946 due to conscription. In 1943 Fricke married Marianne Fricke (n√©e Traute). They had a daughter, Maxi- Marianne Fricke. His wife Marianne died in 1987. In 1951, he received his habilitation from University of Hamburg. In 1953, after receiving a fellowship from the German Science Foundation, he went to the United States for a year, working at the Yerkes, Mount Wilson, Palomar and Princeton University Observatories. After returning, he became a tenured member (Wissenschaftlicher Rat) of the Hamburg Observatory. In December 1954, Dr Fricke was made the provisional director of the Astronomical Calculation Institute in Heidelberg. Heidelberg University appointed him an honorary professor in 1955 and a personal full professor in 1958. In 1961 he became a regular full professor of theoretical astronomy at Heidelberg. Fricke served as president of the International Astronomical Union Commissions 4 (1958‚Äì1964) and 8 (1970‚Äì1973), and as vice president of the IAU from 1964 to 1967. On 1 April 1983 he retired as professor emeritus. Dr. Drh.c.mult Fricke stayed on as Director of the Institute until 30 September 1985, and continued his scientific work until he was hospitalized with cancer in 1987. Scientific work Fricke had a wide interest in astronomy. His first publications dealt with problems in theoretical and observational astronomy. Then for the next two decades, from the time of his thesis onwards, his interests focused on stellar dynamics, working from the observatory in Bergedorf. His favourite subject was the photographic surface photometry survey of the Andromeda Nebula. In addition, in 1951 he published with Otto Heckmann and Pascual Jordan an important work for the extension of Einstein's theory of gravity. After being appointed to the Astronomical Calculation Institute, Fricke concentrated on fundamental astrometry. He worked specifically to improve the fundamental reference system, a series of measurements of the position and motions of a series of fundamental stars that is important for study of kinematics and dynamics of objects within the Galactic system. The production of this kind of fundamental catalogue, which provided the astronomical representation of an inertial system, was part of the institute's important work. His finest contribution to astronomy was the derivation, together with his colleagues and his predecessor August Kopff, of the Fourth Fundamental Catalogue (FK4), published in 1963. The FK5 catalogue was strongly associated with his name, but he was unable to view it when it was published; it used a new constant of precession which he derived himself and adopted by the IAU in 1976. Fricke made significant contributions toward the establishment of the European Southern Observatory in 1962 and the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy (Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr Astronomie) in Heidelberg, with its observatory in Calar Alto, Spain. Cryptographic work See also Crytanalysis of Double Playfair. While in the military, Fricke studied German cipher methods and devised new ones. Fricke's initial task was working on the solving of the double stop system, NS 42, code named the Double Playfair (Doppelkastenschl√ºssel). The Army, Air Force and Police used the Double Playfair system as a medium-grade hand cipher in World War II. The Playfair TS 42 single stop system had already been broken at that point if there were more than 3000 letters of traffic a day. After a year's work, they solved the problem by using vertical bigram frequencies. As the text was written in double lines of 17 or 21 and the substitutions taken vertically, plain text bigram frequencies could not be used. Combined frequencies of pairs of single letters showed a sharp drop after the top three values, EE, EN and NE (the last two had the same frequency). Of a text length of 10000, they could place the three values only initially. Hollerith counts (frequency analysis) were undertaken against messages from the Polish War, but as these were of a stereotypical nature, words could only be guessed after high-frequency digraphs (i.e. pairs of letters) had been created. Using this method led to the recovery of more pairs, and the guessing of words. However, the solution was never used, as even though they believed 3000 letters would be enough to break a message, the Army never informed them what the actual volume of traffic was, so the system continued in use. Around the same time, he worked on the French C36 cipher machine with fixed lugs, designed by Boris Hagelin, which was solved by cribs. He later heard from others that cribs were no longer needed. The head of his section at OKH/Chi (Army Cipher Office) was Hans Pietsch, who managed eight mathematicians in the group. He remained there until 1 November 1944, when he was transferred to the OKW/Chi. At this time Inspektorate 7 was forbidden to create new systems, which was strictly restricted to OKW/Chi. At OKW/Chi, Dr Fricke managed Section IIb of Chi II (Group 2), the main group managing OKW/Chi's interception services. Section IIb, which developed German code and cypher systems (camouflage, codes and cyphers, and telephone secrecy) and also advised on the production of keys and the supervision of production, had a staff of 14. OKW/Chi cipher bureau was a strictly military organization. In 1942, he developed the codebook (Schl√ºsseltafel) for enciphering tables for 3 letter field codes. Before that were used without encipherment. Daily changing trigraphic substitution tables were introduced, initially made by Hollerith machines. He stated in his TICOM interview that there were two master decks of 500 cards each, with a trigraph on each card. Late in the war, the Hollerith machine section moved to Weimar, so Walter Fricke told the printer to make up a set of three-letter slugs of type corresponding to the code groups, which were called Logotypen. The printer had the plain code values in alphabetical order in a form, with blank spaces for the encrypted values. He was told to draw two logos from the mixed batch and place the second one opposite that plain value which was the same as the first. This procedure was repeated until the reciprocal table was created. It also had the effect of enabled untrained workers to make fewer mistakes. He went on to design and develop the raster key hand cipher (Rasterschluessel 44), which was to replace the double playfair cipher. A study was made on the British cipher raster, Cysquare which was created by John Tiltman in 1941. The Cysquare cipher had been pinched from Britain, when Rommel's Afrika Korps overran British units and captured the Cysquare and pads with their instruction booklets. Fricke found it to be excellent, a very secure and practical hand cipher, but he didn't know if it had been broken, with the English using 40 letters and large number of abbreviations. He knew that if German forces used the cipher as it was, it soon would be broken because of longer messages. In order to use longer messages, 26 rows were created, of which 24 were used at any one time. The requirement was to choose all rasters from a systematically constructed field, and to satisfy the following requirements simultaneously: * All rasters should have a fixed number of columns with 20 white cells, a fixed number with 18 and so on. * Vertically adjacent white cells should be kept to a minimum. * And when they did not occur, they must not be less than eight nor more than 12 white cells apart. These conditions were difficult to achieve, since as soon as one requirement was achieved the others would go wrong. The purpose of making all from the same field was to avoid special cases. However, they were eventually required to be made from 20 to 40 master fields. As regards changing keys, the printer was given lead strips bearing the pattern of each of the 36 rows, of which 24 were chosen for each raster. The minimum message length was initially set to 60 characters but was lowered to 45 by the army after some use. Fricke asked the TICOM interrogators :whether the cipher was ever solved, because he was convinced if properly used it would be unbreakable, but they never knew whether mistakes were made which rendered it soluble. They replied it would be impossible for them to give him an answer. Fricke stated that they always wanted to work on their own traffic just as they would on foreign material, but were never allowed to. He never understood how the army actually used the cipher and never saw any real traffic. When they asked for real traffic, they were offered specially prepared messages, one of which read :We are standing in Berlin and see the Polish infantry coming down the Frankfurter Allee. They reflected on the fact that the work on Russian systems showed that these systems were secure if properly used, but if the cryptographers in Moscow could only see how they were used they would be very unhappy.

Designed by notable Northwest architect Elmer Fisher, It was constructed in the latter half of 1889 as an investment property by Seattle politician Alonzo Hull (1843-1929), and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 27, 1983. It is adjacent to the Battery Street Tunnel's south portal. History The Hull Building was built in 1889 by Alonzo Hull (1843-1929), a Pennsylvania native and American Civil War veteran who had arrived in Seattle a year prior via Little Rock, Arkansas and quickly began buying property. He took an active role in the local Republican Party and served on the Seattle City Council throughout the 1890s where he helped establish the city's water system and was vital in securing the Cedar River Water shed as Seattle's primary water source. In February 1889 Hull purchased the lot at the Northwest corner of 1st Avenue (then known as Front Street) and Battery Street for $13,000 from Dr. E.C. Kilbourne, kitty corner to William Bell's grand hotel that formed the nucleus of the burgeoning North Seattle neighborhood AKA Belltown. At Kilbourne's urging, Hull commissioned architect Elmer Fisher to design a 3-story brick building to occupy the lot with construction beginning that Spring. Completed in January 1890, Hull's $30,000 building was one of the first substantial brick buildings completed in the neighborhood. Featuring a restrained Victorian motif with exposed corbelled brick, pressed tin trimmings and cast iron storefront columns, it was typical of Fisher's style just prior to the Great Seattle Fire. The building contained 3 store rooms facing First Avenue while the upper floors were used as working class apartments, home to the likes of cooks, stenographers, ship captains, and clerks and owners of the downstairs businesses. One of the building's earliest retail tenants was the Barnes & Co. Pharmacy; drug stores under various names would operate in the corner store for most of the early 20th century. The lack of commercial development in Belltown after the early 20th century helped preserve the building's character and eventually the upper floors fell vacant and have remained so to the present day. At some point the building's cornices were replaced with near replicas but otherwise the building has had minimal restoration work. The Hull building was purchased by the Eng Family in 1958, who operated A-1 Laundry out the building's first floor and basement for 58 years, closing in 2016 and putting the building up for sale. It was purchased by Hull Building LLC.

With a history dating back to 1798, it is a well-preserved example of diversified 19th-century farmstead, made further distinctive by the remains of a sauna, the product of ownership by two Finnish families in the 20th century. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. Description and history The Spaulding Farm property consists of of land on the east side of South Hill Road, roughly midway between Godfrey Road and South Hill Cross Road. The roughly rectangular parcel is lined on its north by a stone wall, and most of its southern edge by fencing, and consists mostly of lands used for pasture and haymaking, with some woodlands towards the back of the property. The farmstead is clustered near the western end of the property, with the house set about back from the road. It is a handsome 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, oriented with its main facade to the south and an ell extending to the north. Outbuildings on the property include two barns, both from the 19th century, a milkhouse, and a storage shed. Foundational remnants exist for a third barn, and for a modest structure that was probably built in the 1930s as a sauna. with The farmstead was developed in the 1790s by Zachariah Spaulding, who built the farmhouse in 1798. He was prominent in local civic affairs, serving in town offices and in the state legislature. In addition to agricultural uses, he briefly operated a brickmaking operation on the property in the 1810s, but apparently ended the effort due to inferior clay, taken from the streambed on the property. His son continued to work the land until 1885, when it was sold out of the family. The farm was in active use, generally as a diversified operation with multiple products, through about 1974.

He started out with the intention to study medicine but this was frustrated by the death of his father. His full- time profession from 1816 was as a customs officer in Gothenburg, where he was customs administrator from 1834 to 1856. When he retired he spent most of his time working on natural history, especially from 1840 to 1862, during which time he also became a conservator at the G√∂teborg Natural History Museum. He is best known for his book Araneae suecicae descriptae in 1862 in which he described 308 species of spider found in Sweden. Of these, 124 had already been described by Carl Linnaeus, Charles De Geer and Carl Jakob Sundevall. He appears to have been something of a mentor to Tamerlan Thorell who lived in Gothernborg until he went to university at Uppsala and was familiar with Westring's collection of spiders and how to identify them since he had been a schoolboy. He was one of the founders and most active promoters of the G√∂teborg City Museum, serving on its board from 1840 to 1874. He became a member of the Royal Society of Sciences and Letters in Gothenburg in 1843, a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1863 and several foreign entomological associations. Westring was married to Bridget Christina Thorsell but was a widower when he died. He did not have any children but appears to have fostered a relative of his wife, Johan Peterson, to whom he left the bulk of his estate. When he died he bequeathed his collections of specimens and library to the G√∂teborg Natural History Museum. He also left a cabinet made of mahogany which contained some specimens, including many type specimens, to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, this cabinet is now in the Swedish Museum of Natural History.

Kushi promoted the macrobiotic philosophy and diet, a Taoist-influenced spiritual practice emphasizing organic and seasonal foods. Background Kushi was born with the name Tomoko Yokoyama in Yokota, Japan. She worked as a school teacher until the end of World War II, when she joined noted macrobiotic activist George Ohsawa's World Government Association and changed her name to Aveline. Kushi moved to the United States on behalf of the group in 1951, and studied at the University of Illinois and Columbia University. Kushi married fellow macrobiotic advocate Michio Kushi in 1954. Career Together, Aveline and Michio Kushi moved to Boston, where Aveline opened a health food store, Erehwon, among the first in the nation. The store soon expanded to Los Angeles, and Kushi sold the company in 1983.

Personal life  His father, Johann von Fries, was one of the richest men in the Austrian Empire, thanks to many successful financial and industrial ventures. In 1800, at the time when Moritz von Fries married Princess Maria Theresa zu Hohenlohe- Waldenburg-Schillingsf√ºrst he owned 80% of the family bank, which was itself worth 2.5 million guilders. However, this was the height of von Fries' social and financial success, as the inflation and other economic troubles of the Napoleonic Wars coupled with the vast expenses of his standard of living progressively eroded his fortune. By 1826 von Fries was bankrupt, and moved to Paris with his second wife, dying shortly thereafter. His children were left penniless. An admirer of music, Von Fries was also a collector of books and art. His art collection (which he inherited from his brother Johann and then substantially expanded) included over 300 works, including those by Raphael, van Dyck and Rembrandt, and his library extended to over 2,000 books. However, this extensive collection was all sold for the benefit of his creditors after his bankruptcy.  Legacy  Today, von Fries is principally remembered for his patronage of the musical life of Vienna. A member of the Gesellschaft der Associierten Cavaliere, an association of noblemen that organised exclusive concerts with the leading musicians of the day, he also organised many private concerts and musical soirees, where he supported many musicians and composers, most notably Joseph Haydn, Ludwig van Beethoven and Franz Schubert. Haydn's oratorio The Creation was performed at the family residence, the Palais Fries, in April 1800, and Haydn also dedicated his last, unfinished, string quintet to von Fries. It was at one of Fries's soirees that Beethoven was reportedly challenged to a trial of skill by Daniel Steibelt who consequently left Vienna in embarrassment. Beethoven dedicated two piano and violin sonatas, Op. 23 and Op. 24, to Fries, in return for his financial support. Von Fries inadvertently compromised the publication of these sonatas - Beethoven had arranged that, as their sponsor, the sonatas would be supplied to von Fries in manuscript for his exclusive enjoyment for a year prior to putting them to press. However, von Fries was tricked into supplying these manuscripts to the publisher Artaria, who immediately brought out a 'pirated' edition without Beethoven's permission. However, this error was evidently not fatal to Fries's relationship with Beethoven, who went on to dedicate his Op. 29 quintet and his Seventh Symphony to him.

The Hindu temple is dated to the 6th century and is one of the earliest surviving stone temples in Gujarat.; Quote: \\"The earliest image in the region can be dated to the fourth century CE and a worn out figure at the temple of Gop dates to between 525 and 550 CE\\". The original temple had a square plan, a mandapa and covered circumambulation passage which are lost, and a pyramidal masonry roof which is ruined but whose partial remains have survived. The temple has a height of which includes a small tower. The roof of the tower is decorated with arch-like gavaksha window shapes below an amalaka cogged wheel-shaped crown. Location It is located on the bank of Vartu river and south-west of the Gop hill of Barda Hills. The Zinavari village is also known as Juna or Nana Gop and is located east of Gop village. It is located north of Ghumli, on a hill top. Alt URL History The ancient temple of Gop is considered the earliest surviving stone temple of Saurashtra, Gujarat. Burgess in 1876 estimated it not later than 6th century. Sankalia states that the temple belongs to 5th century but not earlier than Uparkot caves of Junagadh based on the Kahu-Jo-Darro stupa of Mirpurkhas. Alt URL The temple is generally dated to late 6th century (575-600 CE). K. V. Soundara Rajan assigned the first half of the 7th century. The most probable date considered now is the last quarter of 6th century (Maitraka period) to the first half of the 7th century. The temple is protected monument by Archeological Survey of India and is designated as Monument of National Importance (N-GJ-133). Description The small, 23 feet tall Gop temple has a square plan. The temple has a square plan to which were added bricked double courtyards centuries later. The temple was bigger and included a mandapa and a roofed pradakshina-patha (circumambulation passage), but most of it was damaged and has fallen away leaving a peculiar looking skeletal structure. The sanctum walls remain standing and parts above the shikhara. The shrine is 10 feet 9 inches square from inside. It is 23 feet high and has 2 feet 6 inches thick walls. The walls are plain without any ornamentation and perpendicular to height till 17 feet and over it survives the pyramidal shikhara. Each course is about 8 inches deep and is jointed. Thus it is built from stones without any kind of cement. At 11 feet from the floor, there are four holes in the front and back walls, each 14 inches high, probably for joists; and over them, in side walls, are six smaller holes, probably for rafters. The sanctum faces the east. Its front wall fell and seems rebuilt at someone with the inner sides of the stones turned out, showing the sockets of the clamps with which the stones had been secured. There is an inscription on the left jamb of the door which Burgess was unable to decipher. Sketch of ruined roof (north side). The arch shaped motifs include reliefs. Inscription on the left jamb of the door The shikhara (spire) is formed by six or seven courses having beveled edges followed by square faces and at last the apex covered by single slab. It follows corbel principle, the interior is hollow. From outside, it rises in tiers having three clear divisions. The lowest division has two gavakshas or arch-shaped motifs on each side, with some images carved in. The apex is crowned by a single stone amalaka (stone disc) on it. Some figures on the Shikhara are identifiable. There is Ganesha figure still visible in the west side and another Deva figure on the north side. There are a series of holes 2 feet below the string-course which supported beams that once supported the roof of inner courtyard. Of two courtyards, the inner courtyard is mostly broken. It was 35 feet 2 inches square with bay on the east side 18 feet 4 inches by 7 feet 3 inches. It may have served as parikrama path so it is sandhara (with circumambulatory path) type of temple. The basement of it was decorated on all four sides by one niche in centre and one each at the corners. These are empty, but likely had sculpture inside. The stretch between these niche was ornamented with small figures such as dwarfs. The outer courtyard was about 9 feet wide. It was probably open above or at least laterally. There are two figures of deities in yellow stone inside the shrine. It can not be decided who are they exactly. They are locally known as Rama and Lakshaman. The Ram figure has high square Mukuta or head-dress while Lakshamana has low crown, long ear-rings, ringlets and holds spear in right hand. The temple features iconography of Vishnu, Skandha, Surya (the solar deity) and the temple has been locally called Surya Mandir. The site also shows iconography of Shivaism, with evidence that Hindu monks lived here. Influences and resemblances The temple is an unusual architectural variation on the Nagara style. It has resemblances with early Dravidian temples of Pattadakal and Aihole. It also have similarities with temples of Kashmir in arrangement of roof and the trefoil niches on outside wall of inner courtyard. Such temples include Martand Sun Temple, Pandrethan and Payar temples though all of them are later than 8th century. Gupta period temples, the temple is on high and square plinth, jagati, with a projection on the east. But the plinth is much higher and is made of heavy blocks of stone which is characteristic local form. The temple has chaitya-windows similar to Uparkot caves of Junagadh but they had lost their use as vedika so they must have evolved later. The sculpture of Kahu-Jo-Darro stupa of Mirpurkhas has similarities with sculptures of Gop temple. As it is dated 4th to 5th century, the Gop temple may belonged to similar period. The radiocarbon dating of wood beam from the temple dating has confirmed its age of 550 AD.

Two were built in 1930 to a government contract. Design Michel Wibault was one of the pioneers of all-metal aircraft, along with Hugo Junkers and Claudius Dornier. The Wibault 220, designed for the night reconnaissance role and with a crew of three (hence the R.N.3 designation), had both metal structure and covering, the latter longitudinally corrugated for stiffness where required. Its high, cantilever wing had a rectangular plan centre-section and trapezoidal outer panels. The latter also tapered in section, mostly on the underside, providing a little dihedral. High aspect ratio, unbalanced ailerons filled the outer panels' trailing edges. The wing was built around two –Ü-section spars. Like other Wibault aircraft built before the Wibault 280, the ribs projected through the wing surface, which was constructed from metal strips with turned up edges. The Wibault 220 was powered by two Gnome-Rh√¥ne 9Ac Jupiter nine-cylinder radial engines, each wing-mounted under the outer centre-section. They were attached at three points on the front and rear spars by a system of duralumin plates and steel tubes and were enclosed in teardrop cowlings with their cylinder heads exposed for cooling. Its flat-sided fuselage was dural framed, with all sides covered in corrugated dural sheet. The upper- and undersides had rounded deckings. The nose was semi-cylindrical in plan and contained an open cockpit for the navigator, who was provided with a flexibly mounted pair of machine guns. The pilot was also in an open cockpit, which was built into the wing leading edge; the rear gunner/observer's position was a little behind the trailing edge, equipped with another pair of flexibly mounted guns. Its floor had an opening into which a reconnaissance camera could be fitted. The gunner also had access to a ventral gun position. Behind him the fuselage tapered slightly to a conventional, cantilever tail with its triangular tailplane mounted on top and carrying narrow chord elevators. The fin was also triangular, with a tall, trapezoidal rudder which extended to the keel. The Wibault 220 had fixed, conventional landing gear with its mainwheels on V-struts hinged to the lower fuselage frames. The wheels were positioned below the engines, to which they were connected by vertical Messier oleo legs so that the track was a generous . The tailskid also had a Messier shock absorber and was steerable. Development The French Senate approved the order for two examples of the Wibault 220 in March 1930 and both were reported as under construction in April. By late May 1930 one was being tested at Villacoublay and by early June Raoul Ribi√®re had made several flights. After that, nothing more about the 220 appears in the French aviation journals.

It is named after Saul X. Levmore and Elizabeth Early Cook who presented it in 1981. It assumes that the cake is two- dimensional. It requires two knives and four cuts, so some partners may receive disconnected pieces.  Procedure  We name the partners Alice, Bob and Carl. Initially, Alice cuts the cake to three pieces equal in her eyes. Bob and Carl each point to their favorite piece. Easy case: Bob and Carl point to different pieces. Each receives his favorite piece and Alice the remaining piece. Hard case: Bob and Carl point to the same piece. Say this is piece X and the other pieces are Y and Z. Now Alice takes two knives and moves them simultaneously over piece X: ** Knife #1 is moved horizontally from the left of piece X to its right. It divides piece X to two pieces: the left piece XL and the right piece XR. ** Knife #2 is moved vertically, to the left of Knife #1, such that XL is divided to two equal pieces in her eyes: the left-top XLT and the left-bottom XLB. Initially XR=X, so for Bob and Carl it is bigger than Y and Z. Moreover, Initially XLT and XLB are empty so XR is bigger than the two pairs: Y+XLT and Z+XLB. As Knife #1 moves rightwards, XR shrinks while XLT and XLB grows. At some point, either Bob or Carl thinks that XR equals one of the two pairs. The first one that thinks there is equality, shouts \\"stop!\\" and receives his chosen pair. Alice receives the other pair, and the non-shouter receive XR.  Analysis  We analyze the case when Bob shouted \\"stop!\\" and picked the pair Y+XLT. Alice gets Z+XLB and Carl gets XR. The division is envy-free because: * For Alice, Z>X>XR so Alice does not envy Carl. Moreover, Z=Y and XLB=XLT so Alice does not envy Bob. * For Bob, Y+XLT=XR>Z+XLB, so Bob does not envy. * For Carl, XR is larger than both pairs (since he did not shout) so he does not envy. The other cases are analogous.  Variants  It is possible to let the shouter choose one of the four pairs: Y+XLT, Y+XLB, Z+XLT, Z+XLB. This modification favors the non-shouter, since the shouter will typically shout \\"stop\\" sooner. Levmore and Cook presented a generalization of their procedure for 4 partners. However, it was later shown that this generalization does not work in all cases.

GMR Goa International Airport Limited (GGIAL), a special purpose vehicle (SPV), will develop the airport. The Rs. 3000 Crore airport will be built under the Build Operate Transfer (BOT) model in four phases, with the first phase costing a total of Rs 1,500 crore. It was expected to be completed by financial year 2019-20, but has been delayed to 2022 due to a Supreme Court order, that impeded work on site. The concession period for the Greenfield project will be 40 years with a possible extension of another 20 years through a bid process. The airport will cater to 4.4 million passengers in the first phase and 13.1 million by the end of the fourth phase. The project will operate on hybrid till model with 30% cross subsidy and the concession offers 232 acres of land for commercial city side development for a period of 60 years. History Goa's current airport at Dabolim is a civil enclave operated by the Airports Authority of India (AAI) at a military airfield owned by the Indian Navy. Civilian and military operations share a common runway and result in severe airside congestion. This deters long term growth of civilian traffic at the airport. The Central Government had given its in-principle approval for a second airport in the state of Goa as early as March 2000, however the project was stuck for 14 years due to land acquisition issues and local litigation. The ICAO's techno-economic feasibility report submitted in 2013, that projected air traffic of 10 million passengers at Goa by 2035, eventually established the feasibility of the Mopa project. The Goa Government issued a Request for Qualification (RFQ) for the project in October 2014 Five bidders, GMR Group, GVK Group, the Airports Authority of India (AAI), Essel Infra and Voluptas developers evinced interest. Essel Infra partnered with Zurich Airports, and Voluptas Developers, which belongs to the Hiranandani group tied-up with Vinci Airports, Rome, to bid for the airport project. On October 28, 2015, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change granted environment clearance to the project. The Request for Proposal (RFP) for the project were issued in January 2016, seeking bids from interested companies to construct the airport. Two of the five companies that responded to the RFQ decided not to participate in the RFP. The bids were opened in August 2016. GMR Airports Limited, a subsidiary of GMR Infrastructure Limited won the competitive bid to develop and operate the airport. The Airports Authority of India emerged as the second highest bidder followed by the consortium of Essel Infra-Incheon. In October, GMR Airports Limited formed the SPV called GMR Goa international airport limited (GGIAL) to raise funds for, design, construct and run the project. GMR Airports Ltd signed a concession agreement with the government of Goa on 8 November 2016. In 2016, the State Government proposed to establish an Aviation Skill Development centre in order to provide employment opportunities at the airport to local youth. The concessionaire would be required to give preference to bona-fide Goans for all jobs at the airport. This Aviation Skill Development Centre was initially to be set up by the concessionaire either at the Pernem ITI campus or any other ITI centre. However, in 2020, the location of the proposed centre was shifted to the airport premises itself. Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone of the project on 13 November 2016. In January 2017, the Goa government declared an area within five km2 radius of the airport as 'Mopa international airport planning area' for the purpose of regulating growth near the project area. GGIAL and the Union ministry of civil aviation (MoCA) signed a MoU in Delhi on 31 March 2017 for necessary support from the Centre to develop the airport. GGIAL invited tenders for the Engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contract in June 2017, which was awarded to Philippines based Megawide Construction Corporation in February 2018. The Goa government finally put its stamp on the project by enacting \\"The Goa (Mopa Airport Development Authority) Act, 2018\\" on 5 September 2018. Subsequently, the Union Home Ministry gave security clearance for the construction in October 2018. On 18 January 2019, the Supreme Court ordered the Goa government and GGIAL to maintain status quo on the project due to environmental impact. Construction of phase 1 of the airport was underway when the top court had given its order. The Court allowed resuming of construction work at the project site in January 2019. The state government has acquired 78.41 lakh square metres of land for the proposed airport from villages of Casarvarnem, Chandel, Varconda, Uguem and Mopa in Pernem taluka. GGIAL expects the airport to be in operation by May 2020 or earlier with a Code 'E' compliant, 3.75 kilometre long runway with Rapid Exit Taxiways. The airport will have an Integrated Passenger Terminal Building, Air-traffic control and meteorological facilities, a Cargo terminal and ancillary facilities for processing and storage, Aircraft Rescue & Fire Fighting facilities as well as Infrastructure for Aircraft Fuelling.

Access to the town square from Delhi Gate is through the smaller Chitta Gate. Structures located in the square Wazir Khan Chowk features the tomb of the Sufi saint Said Soaf, and the Well of Dina Nath. Restoration The Well of Dina Nath was restored in partnership with the Aga Khan Trust for Culture. In 2012, the Pilot Urban Conservation and Infrastructure Improvement Project‚Äîthe Shahi Guzargah Project was launched by the Government of Punjab, and the Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC) which restored a section of Shahi Guzargah which included the Wazir Khan Chowk. Prior to completion of the project's first phase, the square had been encroached upon by illegally erected shops which blocked off much of the mosque from the surrounding neighborhood. The first phase of the project removed illegally constructed shops, restoring views of the mosque. Wazir Khan Chowk was extensively rehabilitated by removal of 73 illegally constructed buildings, while the well of Dina Nath was also restored. Power lines along the project corridor were also placed underground. The Chitta Gate at the eastern entrance to Wazir Khan Chowk was rehabilitated. In December 2015, further efforts to restore the site were launched by the AKTC with funding from the Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation - a programme run by the United States Department of State. Under the million plan, the town square will be lowered to the original depth found during the Mughal era in order to fully expose the mosque's original fa√ßade. Shopkeepers which have occupied hujras, or cells in the mosque designed for religious study, will also be removed, while two historic homes will also be restored. The project will also include further restoration works to the Dina Nath well, and will also include improved outdoor lighting. The project will restore the square to its original appearance, and is expected to require 18 months for completion. The government of the United States of America has provided $1.1 million of the projects costs.

Its stated purpose was \\"activating and connecting the broad strata of women ... regardless of their political, national or religious affiliation ... and involving them in the national-liberation struggle\\". It was one of the organizations that gave rise to the Women's Antifascist Front of Yugoslavia in December 1942.  Purpose and goals  Front page of the first issue of ≈Ωena u borbi, June 1943 The organization's primary goal was ensuring the participation of Croatian women in military resistance to the Nazi occupation of Yugoslavia and the Nazi puppet-state called Independent State of Croatia (NDH). Other tasks included disseminating antifascist pamphlets, popularizing the accomplishments of the Soviet Union, and organizing non-military forms of resistance. The struggle for gender equality was also an official task; though stated vaguely and almost as an afterthought, it developed into a central purpose of the AF≈Ω. Although the Communist Party sincerely wanted to improve the status of women, the AF≈Ω itself was envisaged primarily as a pliable organization through which women would be drawn into the resistance movement. The various AF≈Ω, however, soon developed started acting independently of the Party. Some sections came to identify as explicitly feminist rather than exclusively antifascist. These \\"errors that tend toward feminism\\", as termed by the Party officials, were most evident in Croatia. The organization ran orphanages in liberated territories, with the earliest in Yugoslavia being those in central Croatian regions of Lika and Kordun. In Croatia alone the AF≈Ω ran 100 wartime children's homes. Women were tasked with sustaining the local economy through agriculture, transporting food and ammunition from villages to the front, but also for acts of sabotage and diversion, such as destroying enemy crops, telephone lines, roads and railways. As there was no equivalent organization set up to educate men, Croatia's AF≈Ω leadership soon noted that in some areas women were becoming significantly more interested in politics and involved in campaigns than men in their villages.  Ethnic composition  Delegates arriving at the second regional conference of the Slavonian AF≈Ω in Slavonska Po≈æega, September 1944 Inter-ethnic distrust posed a great problem to Croatia's AF≈Ω during the \\"fratricidal war\\". The occupying forces targeted Jewish and Serbian Orthodox population, with the collaboration of the Croat Usta≈°a militia. Much like the Partisan movement itself, the AF≈Ω attracted mostly Serbs in those parts of Croatia that were nominally under the NDH, while Croat women formed a majority of members in Dalmatia and Gorski kotar, parts of the country directly annexed by Italy. Drawing Croats in the NDH- controlled areas into the AF≈Ω required time and effort, especially because the disproportionate number of Serb members made it seem like a primarily Serb movement. Serb women, on the other hand, were often hostile to their Croat compatriots who wished to join Partisan-sponsored organizations such as the AF≈Ω.  Councils  The first Council of the Women's Antifascist Front of Croatia was held in January 1943, two years after the organization itself was founded, and was the first republican council to follow the December 1942 first council of the Women's Antifascist Front of Yugoslavia. Croatia's AF≈Ω was the largest AF≈Ω organization, numbering 9,348 activists and 1,667 councils in January 1943. 3,130 activists and 627 councils were located in occupied Croatia. Croatia's AF≈Ω network was also the most developed and best organized. AF≈Ω councils sprung throughout the Partisan-liberated areas of Croatia. Local councils reported to the regional, which were subordinate to the republic's council, which in turn answered to the federal council. Initially the most active, and with extraordinary achievements in the war effort, was the regional AF≈Ω for Lika in Croatia proper. It succeeded in publishing the first wartime women's journal, ≈Ωena u borbi (\\"Woman in the Struggle\\"), in the midst of the 1942 counter-insurgency Operation Trio. The journal turned out to be very effective in mobilising the women of Lika, and served as an example for other wartime journals issued by various AF≈Ω forums.

The camp offers an array of outdoor activities, including water and field sports and hiking, and indoor arts and crafts programs, all generally infused with an educational purpose. It has a full 7 and a half week session, as well as two three-week sessions, typically running from late June to mid-August. During the off-season, its facilities are used as the Hulbert Outdoor Center, an educational center for adults, children, school groups and special events.

Camper residential facilities are divided into clusters, most located within view of the road, and consist of a combination of cabins and tents set on platforms. Other facilities include a boat shed, craft building, infirmary, and a castle, as well as several structures and buildings that have been built by campers over the years. with History The camp was founded in 1922 by Harriet Farnsworth Gulick and Edward Leeds Gulick, and was the third camp they established on either Lake Morey or Lake Fairlee. All 6 camps are now operated by the Aloha Foundation, founded to continue the Gulick's legacy. The property, a farm since about 1850, was first used as a girls' camp called Camp Kia-Ora between 1917 and 1922. That camp was not a financial success, and its owners sold to the Gulicks, who at that time already had more than ten years' experience in operating camps. The camp was run by appointees of the Gulicks, and later their children, until the Aloha Foundation was organized in 1968.

The memorial was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens with sculpture by Sir George Frampton and closely resembles Fordham War Memorial in Cambridgeshire, which was also a collaboration between Lutyens and Frampton. It was unveiled in 1921 and is today a grade II listed building. Background In the aftermath of the First World War and its unprecedented casualties, thousands of war memorials were built across Britain. Amongst the most prominent designers of memorials was the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, described by Historic England as \\"the leading English architect of his generation\\". Lutyens designed the Cenotaph on Whitehall in London, which became the focus for the national Remembrance Sunday commemorations, as well as the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing‚Äîthe largest British war memorial anywhere in the world‚Äîand the Stone of Remembrance which appears in all large Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries and in several of Lutyens's civic war memorials. Hove's memorial is unusual among Lutyens' works in that it features a bronze statue of Saint George, a feature shared only with Fordham War Memorial in Cambridgeshire. The proposal for a war memorial in Hove was first noted in the vestry notes section of the local newspaper, and the project apparently progressed smoothly. As in many places, a war memorial committee was formed in Hove to handle the town's commemorations. The committee appointed Lutyens as the architect and he made several proposals for the design of Hove's war memorial, including an obelisk or a cenotaph and erected a wooden model of the latter on Hove Lawns on the seafront, but these were rejected in favour of the statue of St George. The committee's preferred site, in Palmeira Gardens, was rejected by the landowner, leaving the committee with three sites on Grand Avenue. Lutyens chose a site in the middle of the road, towards the southern end of Grand Avenue, in June 1920. History and design The lower sections of the memorial, showing the inscriptions, partially obscured by a poppy wreath laid at a remembrance service. The memorial consists of a bronze statue of Saint George holding a sword by the blade below the hilt, sculpted by Sir George Frampton, which stands on a grey granite Doric column. At the bottom of the column is a two-staged square plinth and below that is base of three square stone blocks. The whole memorial stands on three shallow stone steps, taking the memorial to a total height of . At the corners of the bottom step are low stone bollards, which are part of the original design, next to which are metal lamp pillars, which are a modern addition. The memorial does not include a space for the names of the fallen; these are instead recorded on a bronze plaque which was placed in Hove Library.Skelton, p. 75.Skelton, p. 169. The plinth contains the memorial's inscriptions (inscriptions relating to the Second World War were added at a later date). The main inscription is on the north face: \\"IN EVER GLORIOUS MEMORY OF HOVE CITIZENS WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES FOR THEIR COUNTRY IN THE GREAT WAR AND WORLD WAR\\". The south face reads \\"THEIR NAME LIVETH FOR EVERMORE\\", while the dates of the First and Second World Wars are inscribed in Roman numerals on each face higher on the plinth: \\"MCMXIV TO MCMXIX\\" (1914‚Äì1919) on the north and south faces and \\"MCMXXXIX TO MCMXLV\\" (1939‚Äì1945) on the east and west. The total cost of the memorial was ¬£1,537 (1920). The memorial was unveiled on 27 February 1921 by Charles Wyndham, 3rd Baron Leconfield, the Lord Lieutenant of Sussex. Lutyens was away in India but sent his office manager, AJ Thomas, in his place. Lutyens adapted the design for a proposal for a war memorial in Shere in Surrey, but the memorial committee there opted for a different architect and design.Skelton, p. 148. Hove War Memorial was designated a grade II listed building on 2 November 1992. In March 2015, as part of commemorations for the centenary of the First World War, Lutyens' war memorials were recognised as a \\"national collection\\" and all of his free-standing memorials in England were listed or had their listing status reviewed and their National Heritage List for England list entries were updated and expanded.

The well's construction by in the 19th century by a Sikh nobleman sparked controversy, given its location in the immediate vicinity of the Wazir Khan Mosque. History The well was commissioned by Raja Dina Nath in the mid 19th century under the reign of Ranjit Singh. The well was not built as an open well, but is instead enclosed within a walled structure. Legend It is said that Nath wished to build his well near the site of a well dug Sufi saint Said Soaf despite strong objections from local Muslim leaders who viewed construction of a second well to be antagonistic to the saint's memory. Disregarding their warnings and objections, Dina Nath ordered construction to begin on the site. After 200 metres of digging, labourers could not tap a water source, and refused to dig any further, much to the embarrassment of Dina Nath. The well has remained dry ever since, and remains a local monument. Restoration The well fell into disrepair, and was eventually surrounded by illegally constructed shops which had encroached upon the Wazir Khan Chowk. In 2012, the Aga Khan Trust for Culture and the Government of Punjab launched restoration efforts which have since removed the illegal shops, restoring public access to the well.

Iron Bottom Sound in Honiara. The Honiara Central Market (locally referred to as \\"Central Market\\") is a fish, flower, clothing, fruit and vegetable market (including fresh coconut water), which also sells shell money, and other local crafts such as palm-frond broomsticks, jewellery, coconut oil and hair tonics in Honiara, the capital of Solomon Islands; offering the largest fresh produce and fish outlets of the country. The market \\"dominates\\" the national internal trade, starting from early after its creation in the 1950s, and up until today. It is one of the two markets owned and operated by the Honiara City Council (the other being the Kukum Market). For more information, cf. ¬ß Management. The market has its own water frontage at Iron Bottom Sound, in order for boats to be pulled in. As such, fisherman can take their catches straight to the market via a boat ramp, seen as significant symbol of how the freshness of fish is valued by Solomon Islanders. Selling occurs both in the permanently covered building, as well as at its sides. The market offers the cheapest food in Honiara. Some women migrate temporarily to Honiara to sell their products at the market. The market is seen as a meeting place for the diverse ethnic groups in Solomon Islands, and produce is transported there from across the whole country. Furthermore, it has been typified as an indication of the state of the country as a whole. In 2006, the Honiara City Council allocated part of the market's space for the sale of a consistent range of flowers and pot plants all year round. In 2014, there were around a thousand market vendors, of which 80% were estimated to be women. Males also help unloading and setting up market produce.  Waste and pollution  The Honiara City Council is responsible for collecting waste from the market, which is composed for 94% of compostable organic waste, and is dumped at Honiara's dumpsite \\"Ranadi Landfill\\". On 9 December 2015, imagery of un-emptied rubbish bins at the street-side of the market hit a major local newspaper. Such images of bad waste management were first published on the popular private Facebook group \\"Forum Solomon Islands International (FSII)\\", where they triggered wide public criticism of the failure of business houses and the Honiara City Council to keep the city tidied. Sir Thomas Koh Chan's shipwreck (MV Yandina) at the market's boat ramp, in March 2016. One of the vessels of which market vendors have asked the immediate removal. In January 2016, the head of the Solomon Islands Indigenous Peoples Human Rights Advocacy Association (SIIPHRAA), Moses Ramo said that the condition of the Central Market is unacceptable, referring to a failed waste management. Moses Ramo also insinuated that the uncleanliness is negative for tourism. In March 2016, market vendors at the Central Market from at least five different provinces of Solomon Islands urged an immediate removal of the two shipwrecks at the market jetty, which have been lying there for multiple years. One of the shipwrecks (MV Yandina) is owned by businessman and former Minister Sir Thomas Koh Chan, the other one (MV Bikoi II) by Shortland Shipping Company. An individual had already pleaded for removal of the wreck \\"MV Bikoi II\\" in February 2016. The Honiara City Council also warns vendors not to use the natural (sea) water source at the market:  Honiara Central Market Vendors‚Äô Association  Market vendors during a workshop in 2014, part of initial workshops series by UN Women's Markets for Change (M4C) project, which formed the Honiara Central Market Vendors‚Äô Association. The Honiara Central Market Vendors‚Äô Association (HCMVA) was opened and registered in 2014, followed by the registration of a market vendors' association in Auki in 2015. Both were registered under the Solomon Islands Charitable Trust Act. UN Women cooperates with market vendors and associations of both the Central Market, as well as with those of Auki Market. HCMVA formed as a result of initial workshops series by UN Women's Markets for Change (M4C) project, which is funded for the largest part by the Australian Government.  Crime  The country's \\"ethnic tensions\\" firstly sprung up at the market. During these tensions, in May 2000, a headless body of a Guadalcanese man was dumped at the market with a note on it linking the murder to ongoing peace talks and claiming that the Prime Minister would be the next one to die. Approaching the end of 2007, the police reported to have arrested more than two hundred young men who sold kwaso (a type of illegal local homebrew) at the market. In 2009, there were active student surveys of the sex trade involving market women and young girls from the Central Market. In 2014, fishermen, who were paid to transport girls to foreign fishing vessels outside the harbour of Honiara, described the Central Market as one of \\"the most evident or well-known pickup spots\\" for prostitution.  Management  The market management is headed by a market manager, supervised by Honiara City Council's Finance Director. In 2009, there were eight security guards (who, combined, cover the area day and night) and six full-time cleaners employed at the market; three further workers were in charge of the \\"ice house\\" (which features an ice maker, used for fish). A market vendor receives a stall space when they are early enough to buy a ticket which allows one to rent one meter of stall space per separate vendor. Nevertheless, some people reserve their stall the night beforehand (for the fee cost of ). Outside of the main space of the market, it is possible to reserve more stall space. There exists different types of market fees depend on the kind of goods to be sold by a vendor. , those market fees ranged from (e.g. the \\"Crop Market Fee\\") to (e.g. the price to store fish in an Esky). , a parking fee costed . The Honiara City Council raised a total of and for the years 2006 and 2008 respectively, due to the collection of market fees. The Honiara City Council does not regulate prices of the products sold at Kukum Market and Honiara Central Market. In 2009, it was stated that the increased use of the site had surpassed its capacity. The Honiara City Council reportedly planned to solve this problem by creating extra markets across the city which were to ease the traffic jams on Mendana Avenue at the Central Market.

He is the founding editor of the Journal of Industry, Competition and Trade and was the project leader for the analytical principles underpinning the competition reports of the European Commission's Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs.

He was on the supervisory board of the holding company of nationalized Austrian companies. His work encompasses theoretical essays on decisions made under uncertainty by companies and essays on the policy-relevant assessment of the competitiveness of nations (for the European Commission and the OECD). He has written articles for the Advisory Council for Economic and Social Affairs as well as the reform dialogue of the Austrian Federal Government. Over the past few years, he has focused increasingly on the causes and consequences of the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08 and European economic policy strategies. . Recently he published on globalization, the future role of Europe in the new world order with the USA as ‚Äúsole remaining superpower‚Äù retreating from multilateralism and China on the way back to Number 1. He discusses possible cooperation with Africa in combating climate change as well mitigating the refugee streams to Europe. He led the research project Welfare, Wealth and Work for Europe from 2012 to 2016.The research work leading to these results were supported pursuant to the financial aid agreement no. 290647 in the course of the Seventh Framework Programme for Research of the European Union FP7/2007-2013. This is the largest socio-economic project in the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for Research. It was funded by the European Union and coordinated by the Austrian Institute of Economic Research. It was a key academic project accompanying the European Union's Europe 2020 strategy the EU's growth strategy for the coming decade. In a changing world, the EU wants to become a smart, sustainable and inclusive economy. and extending it beyond, providing a basis for a more dynamic, green and socially- oriented society.See website of the Europe 2020 strategy for further details. The closing report and the executive summary were presented in Brussels in February 2016 to the European Parliament, the European Commission and the media in a final conference at which Kenneth Arrow of Stanford University held the welcoming address. A white paper was prepared under his leadership in 2006 on Austrian economic policy entitled \\"More employment through growth on the basis of innovation and qualification\\", which had a major influence on Austrian economic policy.. In industrial policy, Aiginger advocates the concept of a systemic industrial policy which cooperates with innovation policy, labor market and competition policy with the final goal of serving societal needs. If it is designed strategically, a \\"green industrial policy\\" must not reduce price competitiveness but should actually create a competitive advantage. This issue is explored in depth in a special volume of the Journal of Industry, Competition and Trade. Higher costs for energy or emission at an industrial location should be offset by lower taxes on labor and a better supply of research resources, universities and technical colleges. In this way, a country gains competitive advantages that are important for the future, it becomes a technological leader in renewable energies and energy efficiency, and saves costs associated with making up for environmental damage. It is a main message of Aiginger's work not to equate competitiveness with low costs or to measure it using the external balance, but to measure it by outcomes, specifically defining competitiveness as the \\"ability to deliver Beyond GDP goals\\". Industrialized countries must follow a strategy based on quality. A cost strategy can be copied by low-income countries at any time (the \\"high road strategy vs. the low road strategy\\"). The broad definition of competitiveness was also recently adopted by the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) \\\\- A consultative body of the European Union in which the trade unions originally wanted to reject the new \\"national committees for competitiveness\\" because they feared an overly restrictive, cost-cutting policy. Following a change in the definition of competitiveness in the direction of fulfilling targets that go \\"beyond GDP\\", as proposed by Aiginger and WWWforEurope, \\\\- A Seventh Framework Programme for Research project funded by the EU the EESC was able to approve the creation of new commissions. Karl Aiginger continues to work on European issues in the Policy Crossover Center, Vienna-Europa and at the Vienna University of Economics and Business from an increasingly interdisciplinary standpoint.

It reorganized the State University System of Florida and empowered the Florida Board of Control to govern the system. The act, named for legislator Henry Holland Buckman, mandated the consolidation of the state's six institutions of higher education into three: one for white men, one for white women, and one for African Americans. Four of the institutions ‚Äì the University of Florida at Lake City (formerly Florida Agricultural College) in Lake City, the East Florida Seminary in Gainesville, the St. Petersburg Normal and Industrial School in St. Petersburg, and the South Florida Military College in Bartow ‚Äì were merged into the new University of the State of Florida. The University of the State of Florida served as the institution for white men; the State Normal School for Colored Students (the future Florida A&M; University) served African Americans, and the Florida Female College, later named the Florida State College for Women (the future Florida State University) served white women. A fourth school provided specialized training and education for the deaf and blind (the Florida School for the Deaf and Blind). The Buckman Act was discontinued following World War II, when the establishment of the GI Bill provided a financial vehicle for returning U.S. military veterans, the overwhelming majority of them male, to pursue a college education that they could not have otherwise afforded. Single gender provisions of the Buckman Act at the University of Florida (UF) and the Florida State College for Women (FSCW) were officially eliminated in 1947. FSCW (formerly known as Florida State College) returned to coeducational status, while UF became coeducational for the first time. In 1953, the former State Normal School for Colored Students, by then known as the Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes, was renamed to its current title of Florida Agricultural & Mechanical University (FAMU). Civil rights efforts in the early 1960s also led to all three institutions becoming racially integrated during that decade, although FAMU remains a historically black university, with over 87% of its student body African-American as of 2014.

The baths fell into disuse by the 18th century during the decline and fall of the Mughal Empire. From the early British period onwards the building was used for different purposes - as a primary school, dispensary, and recreational centre as well as an office for the local municipality. Additionally, shops were built into the building‚Äôs northern, western and southern fa√ßades. Excavations as part of restoration works completed in 2015 revealed that substantial parts of the building had previously been demolished, likely to make way for the reconstruction of Delhi Gate building in the 1860s. Layout Some walls were adorned with Mughal-era frescoes which still remain intact. The hammam consisted of three parts: the jama khana (dressing area), nim garm (warm baths), and garm (hot baths). The baths were gender segregated, and contained a reception chamber as well as a small prayer room. =Architecture= In keeping with Persian tradition, the baths were illuminated by sunlight which filtered through several openings in the bath's ceiling which also aided ventilation. Most of the hammam's interior was preserved intact, and several Mughal era frescoes have been preserved. As the fa√ßade had few windows, merchant shops were permitted to operate along the hammam's outer walls. Conservation The hammam was recently renovated. The Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC), with funding from the government of Norway, began restoration works at the baths to conserve the space, restore the original layout of the building, and to uncover and preserve Mughal-era frescoes which decorated the building's walls. Works were completed in 2015, and are the improvements are said to have changed the surroundings \\"dramatically.\\" In 2016, UNESCO awarded the Shahi Hamam restoration project an Award of Merit for its \\"high degree of technical proficiency\\" and \\"for returning the ornate Shahi Hammam to its former prominence.\\" Excavations have unearthed a water heating structure, drainage systems, and under-floor remains of its hypocausts.

She works at Lyla Films in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Early life Born to La Presse reporter Gaston Lafontaine, Lyse studied literature at the Universit√© de Montr√©al and earned her degree. She married St√©phane Venne and managed the rock band Offenbach in 1972. She became a stage manager on the 1974 film The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz, and married her second husband, moving to The Bahamas for two years before returning to Canada. Career In 1976, Lafontaine served as location manager for the film The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane, starring Jodie Foster. Lafontaine met Lauzon when he was pitching his screenplay for L√©olo (1992), which other producers had rejected. It became the first film she produced, with Aim√©e Danis, for which they were nominated for the Genie Award for Best Motion Picture. While in Italy during filming, Lauzon gave Lafontaine a letter thanking her for her ineptitude in business, which he considered necessary to make a film with feeling. She kept it as a cherished keepsake. Working with Dolan, she produced Laurence Anyways (2012) and served as an associate producer for Mommy (2014). Dolan's Laurence Anyways was inspired by Lafontaine's ex-boyfriend Luc Baillairg√©, the father of her son Mika√´l, who had a small part in L√©olo. With Dolan, she personally traveled to London in 2017 to work on his The Death and Life of John F. Donovan. In 2015, Lafontaine produced La Passion d‚ÄôAugustine with Fran√ßois Tremblay, winning the Qu√©bec Cin√©ma Award for Best Film.

Steinberg (1847‚Äì1923)Devera Stocker, When Grandfather Julius Came to Michigan, in Michigan Jewish History, November 1965, The Jewish Historical Society of Michigan was a businessman and theatre entrepreneur in Michigan, United States. Steinberg was born February 18, 1847, in Suwalki, Russian Poland. To avoid conscription he emigrated in 1868 to Traverse City, Michigan, not yet a village at the time, and became the first Jew to settle there.Michigan Jewish History vol 19-2, June 1979, Official Publication of The Jewish Historical Society of Michigan. Together with his wife Mary (Marion Starska, who arrived four years after her husband), Julius established a mercantile business and raised seven children. The store, which remained in the Steinberg family for over 50 years, closed in 1922 as the J.H. Steinberg Store. In 1891 Julius built the Steinberg's Grand Opera House above the store with a seating capacity of 700-800 at a cost of $60,000. The first production occurred in 1894 starring Walker Whiteside, a leading American actor, in Hamlet.Al Barnes, Julius H. Steinberg, Early Jewish Pioneer of Traverse City and The Steinberg Grand Opera House, in Michigan Jewish History, vol 14-2, June, 1974, Jewish Historical Society of Michigan, pp 24-30. Movies were shown in the opera house for a short time until a Michigan law was passed in 1915 forbidding the showing of movies in second floor theaters. Consequently, Julius Steinberg built the Lyric Theater next to the opera house in 1916; the Lyric Theater was remodeled in 1950 and renamed the State Theater, which is still active. Steinberg died on April 4 1923 in Detroit after a short illness and was interred at the Machpelah Cemetery in Ferndale, Michigan.

He received the habit of Dominican Order, made profession on 30 April 1609 and was known as Hermano Pedro de Santa Catalina (Br Peter of St Catherine). He studied philosophy in the Royal Priory of Holy Cross in Segovia, then theology at the Priory of St. Thomas in √Åvila.Garc√≠a OP, Jos√© Delgado \\"Witnesses of the Faith in the Orient, Dominican Martyrs of Japan, China, and Vietnam\\", Provincial Secretariat of Missions, 2006  Missionary  In 1613, James Aduarte arrived to recruit missionaries for the Far East. V√°squez was chosen for this mission after showing great enthusiasm. V√°squez and Aduarte departed Spain and sailed to the Philippines via Mexico, They arrived in Manila at the end of April 1615. V√°squez's first assignment was in the province of Cagayan. He learned the regional language at Lal-lo, Cagayan in New Segovia. For the next five years, he was assigned to pastoral care within the Philippines. In 1621, V√°squez was then appointed to act as Superior of St. Vincent Community in Balunguei. He was not happy with this apostolate and repeatedly asked to be allowed to go to Japan, as the martyrdom of Alphonso Navarrete, in 1617, had made a profound impression on him. Ultimately, his superiors granted his request. In July 1621, he left Manila for his new apostolate work in Nagasaki.  Arrest and martyrdom  Because of the shortage of missionaries, V√°squez promptly started his mission work in the spring of 1622, once he educated himself with the language. On 14 August, he disguised himself as a Japanese guard, with a pair of swords slung at his side, he entered the prison of Nagasaki. He marched boldly through three sets of doors guarded by eight sentinels, without being discovered, to reach the imprisoned Christians and administer the Sacraments to them. Two renounced Christians, whose confessions he heard, exposed V√°squez's cover. In spite of these traitors, he escaped detection. He continued the intense labor of preparing many Christians who, he believed, would be martyred before long. V√°squez and his fellow missionaries were able to witness the cruel executions. In early November 1622, he was appointed acting Vicar-Provincial. Before his arrest, V√°squez had been working with Domingo Castellet, ministering to the Christians in Arima, ≈åmura, and Nagasaki. During Holy Week, April 1623, V√°squez was in great danger of being arrested, but managed to evade capture. After his escape, he met Castellet in Fuchi before proceeding to Inasa, a village in the mountains, where he was unexpectedly arrested on 27 April. He was then taken to the courthouse for a hearing on the matter of his illegal activities. After the trial, he was sentenced to prison in Nagasaki. On 15 June 1623, he was transferred to prison in ≈åmura. In the local prison, he joined Luis Sotelo OFM, Miguel de Carvalho SJ and two Japanese Franciscans, Ludovicus Sasada and tertiary Ludovicus Baba.Fros SJ, Henryk \\"Saints and Blessed of the Society of Jesus\\", Krak√≥w: Wydawnictwo Apostolstwa Modlitwy, pp. 108‚Äì9, 1992, On 24 August, a death sentence was ordered, which was performed the next day in ≈åmura.Borrelli, Antonio \\"Blessed Michael Carvalho, Jesuit martyr\\", 2005-02-22 On 25 August 1624, V√°squez and his companions were burned at the stake. The ashes of these martyrs, whose dead bodies we re-burnt, to prevent them being carried away by the Christians, were cast into the sea, however Castellet managed to secure a small portion of the relics of V√°squez. His relics were eventually deposited in the Jesuit church in Macau. V√°squez was beatified by Pope Pius IX on 7 July 1867.. In the Roman Catholic Church, his feast day is celebrated on 25 August, as well as 10 September, the anniversary of the massacre of 205 Japanese martyrs.

It is based on a railway journey Thomas took on 24 June 1914, during which his train briefly stopped at the now-closed station in the Gloucestershire village of Adlestrop. The poem was written, not during or immediately after the 1914 journey, but at Thomas's leisure. He began making notes for it the following January, and created several versions of the poem before it was ready for publication. Since then, the poem has become symbolic of a turning-point in Thomas's literary career, and is used as such in the title of Jean Moorcroft Wilson's 2015 biography of the poet. Although not, strictly speaking, a war poem, it has become popular in anthologies because of its reference to a peaceful time and place, only a short time before the outbreak of the First World War. Thomas enlisted the following year, and was killed in 1917, just before the poem was due to be printed in his collection Poems, published by Henry Holt and Company. It was published in the New Statesman, three weeks after he died. Thomas's earlier career had mainly been as a writer of prose, his first collection of poems having been published only in 1916. The change in creative direction is often attributed to the influence of Robert Frost. One hundred years to the day after the original journey, an \\"Adlestrop Centenary Special\\" Cotswold Line train was arranged, carrying 200 passengers from Oxford to Moreton-in-Marsh and stopping at Adlestrop in the place where the station formerly stood. Adlestrop village also held a celebration to mark the centenary, with a public reading of the poem by Robert Hardy. Text of the poem Yes. I remember Adlestrop The name, because one afternoon Of heat, the express-train drew up there Unwontedly. It was late June. The steam hissed. Someone cleared his throat. No one left and no one came On the bare platform. What I saw Was Adlestrop‚Äîonly the name And willows, willow-herb, and grass, And meadowsweet, and haycocks dry, No whit less still and lonely fair Than the high cloudlets in the sky.

Located at the northern end of the Vitiaz Strait, Long Island was an important staging point for Japanese barges moving between Rabaul and Wewak until 26 December 1943, when a force of 220 Australian and American soldiers landed on the island. It was not occupied by the Japanese at the time, and there was no fighting. At the time, it represented the furthest Allied advance into Japanese-held territory. It was developed into a radar station. Background =Geography= Long Island lies at the northern end of the Vitiaz Strait. It is roughly circular in shape, and about in diameter, with an area of about . There are two prominent peaks, the Mount Reamur in the north, and the Cerisy Peak in the south. Most of the interior is taken up by Lake Wisdom, which is above sea level. Inside the lake is an active volcanic cone. Offshore there is a north westerly current. There were two settlements, Bok in the south east and Malala in the north east. The population of the island was about 250, all native. The island had once supported a larger population, but it had been wiped out by a volcanic eruption. The 1660 Plinian eruption was the third largest volcanic eruption recorded in the last 2,000 years. It was more powerful than the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa, and buried Long Island under of volcanic ash. =Strategy= alt=Map depicting the movement of military forces around the Huon Peninsula Fighting in the South West Pacific Area in late 1943 and early 1944 was dominated by General Douglas MacArthur's Operation Cartwheel, a series of operations directed at isolating and neutralising Rabaul, the main base of the Imperial Japanese forces. The Huon Peninsula campaign started well, with victories in the landing at Lae and landing at Nadzab but faltered in the face of inclement weather, unfavourable terrain, and tenacious and aggressive Japanese opposition, both on land and in the air. The initiative passed to Lieutenant General Hataz≈ç Adachi's Japanese XVIII Army which launched a series of counter-attacks in the Battle of Finschhafen. The Allied air, ground and naval forces set out to cut the Japanese supply line, which was by barges moving along the coast between Madang and Fortification Point. Long Island was an important staging point for Japanese barges moving between Rabaul and Madang. In Allied hands, it could be a useful site for a radar station and observation post, and could provide radar coverage for the upcoming landing at Saidor. On 22 December 1943, the commander of Alamo Force, Lieutenant General Walter Krueger, issued his Field Order No. 8, directing the 2nd Engineer Special Brigade to seize Long Island. The operation was codenamed \\"Sanatogen\\", and was undertaken concurrently to landings around Cape Gloucester, on New Britain. Preliminaries A party of coastwatchers consisting of three Australians from the Allied Intelligence Bureau (AIB) and four natives, were landed on Long Island by a PT boat on 6 October 1943. Their role was to watch for and report on aircraft coming from Madang. At the time of their arrival, there were at least two Japanese parties on the island, but in November they reported that the Japanese had left. The mission commander, Major Leonard Kaplan, flew to Finschhafen on 22 December with two amphibian scouts. At 18:00 the following day they boarded a PT boat that took them to Long Island. They landed on the island at 23:45, guided by lights set up by the AIB. Reassured that there were no Japanese on the island, Kaplan re-embarked and returned to Finschhafen, leaving the two amphibian scouts behind to reconnoitre the island, and to set up lights to guide landing craft during the landing. Meanwhile, on 22 December the participating elements of the 2nd Engineer Special Brigade set out from Oro Bay for Finschhafen, from whence the assault would be staged. A detachment of 3 officers and 32 men from the Boat Battalion of the 592nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment (EBSR) manned three LCVPs and five LCMs. One LCVP acted as a navigation boat; the remaining two, with one officer and eight other ranks, would remain on Long Island with the garrison. The assault troops were 150 men from Company D, Shore Battalion, 592nd EBSR. At Finschhafen they met up with the Australians of No. 338 Radar Station RAAF, who would man the radar installation on Long Island. This unit had flown in from Jacksons and Wards Airfields around Port Moresby in 11 transport aircraft. It was commanded by Pilot Officer Alan Lum. To help establish the radar station, they were accompanied by some technical experts from No. 41 Wing RAAF. All told, there were 35 RAAF personnel, bringing the assault force to a total of 220 men. A planned rehearsal on 24 December was scrubbed due to an air raid alert. Krueger supervised the drafting of the final landing plan. A final briefing was given at 08:30 on 25 December, and all boats were loaded and equipment stowed by 12:00. The men then sat down to their Christmas dinner of roast turkey. The equipment included two 37 mm guns, four 60 mm mortars, four bazookas, a canvas water tank, a TD9 bulldozer, two jeeps, a jeep trailer with a water tank, and two .50-caliber machine guns. Landing The LCMs and LCVPs set out on the voyage from Finschhafen at 14:15, and made its way along the coast in broad daylight without being engaged by Japanese aircraft or vessels. Three PT boats, carrying the 90 men of Company D who would make up the first wave, set out from Finschhafen at 18:00. Being faster, they overtook the landing craft during the night. They arrived off Malala at 23:45, a quarter of an hour late; but this was of no consequence as there was no preliminary air or naval bombardment owing to there being no Japanese present. The men transferred from the PT boats to six rubber boats. This was not easily accomplished; since there had been no rehearsal, they were unaccustomed to the craft. Guided by the lights the amphibian scouts had set up ashore, the rubber boats set out at 00:20. The surf conditions were rough, and two boats capsized; but neither men nor equipment were lost. The entire first wave was safely ashore by 02:00 on 26 December. The second wave, the landing craft, arrived off the island at 05:20, eighty minutes late. The beach grade was found to be steep, resulting in a surf. The force waited until daylight before two LCMs unsuccessfully attempted to beach. They broached, soaking the radar equipment in salt water. A search was then made for a more suitable beach, and one was found south of Cape Reamur. Some of equipment were unloaded by 13:00, and the navigation boat LCVP and five LCMs set sail for Finschhafen. The radar equipment was moved inland and covered by tarpaulins. The following night rains caused Lake Wisdom to overflow and the equipment was subjected to a torrent of fresh water. Outcome On 27 December 1943 the radar equipment was moved to a hilltop on the east coast. Two generators were towed on sleds. The radar station personnel had considerable difficulty keeping the equipment operational in the hot, wet and humid climate, and there were numerous failures. The wet season had begun by the end of December, and the equipment was affected. Two replacement power supplies and a replacement transmitter and receiver for the radar unit arrived on 27 January 1944. By April 1944, the Allies had advanced along the coast to Madang, and the main Japanese air threat was coming from Wewak. No. 338 Radar Station was therefore ordered to move to Matafuna Point on the west coast. This took a week to accomplish. A flying fox was used to bring the equipment back down to sea level. The station was operational again at 19:00 on 11 April 1944. It finally ceased operation on 28 January 1945. The garrison was for a time the most advanced Allied position in the theatre, and Brigadier General William F. Heavey, the commander of the 2nd Engineer Special Brigade, of which the 592nd EBSR was part, was surprised when its capture was officially announced in December 1943. Rumours were rife among the garrison that the Japanese might attempt to recapture the island and eliminate the radar station. No attempt was made; the Japanese accepted the loss of their staging point. The engineers built defences, camp sites and facilities for the radar station. An airstrip for light Piper Cub aircraft long and wide was built in five days. Resupply came from Finschhafen in LCMs and the occasional PT boat. On 17 February 1944, the 592nd EBSR Group departed Long Island in an LCVP and seven LCMs of the Boat Battalion. Krueger praised the 592nd EBSR Group, who \\"by a display of aggressiveness and superior seamanship, accomplished its mission in the face of unusual odds.\\" Notes References    1943 in Papua New Guinea Battles and conflicts without fatalities Battles and operations of World War II involving Papua New Guinea Battles of World War II involving Australia Battles of World War II involving the United States Conflicts in 1943 December 1943 events Operation Cartwheel South West Pacific theatre of World War II ","title":"Landing on Long Island"},{"id":"51438046","text":"Justice Morton may refer to: *James Morton (Massachusetts judge), an Associate Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court *John Morton (American politician), an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania *Marcus Morton, an Associate Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court *Marcus Morton (judge), a Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, and son of the previous ","title":"Justice Morton"},{"id":"51438061","text":"All Tvvins are an Irish pop band from Dublin.

Little of the fauna on, above or in the seas surrounding the isles was described prior to the 19th century, when birds and fish started to be described. Most records of other animals date from the 20th century onwards. Historical overview There are few pre-19th-century records for animals. William Borlase published The Natural History of Cornwall in 1758, commenting on the number of rabbits, and Jonathan Couch's A Cornish Fauna gave an account of some the animals known in Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. In the 19th century, following the fashion of the time, birds were shot and stuffed, especially by Augustus Smith and his predecessors on Tresco. Egg collecting was allowed and in the Natural History Museum there are, in the collection, forty-five eggs taken between 1880 and 1936 from Annett, even though it was a bird sanctuary.Robinson, P. (2003) The Birds of the Isles of Scilly. London: Christopher Helm. Newspapers recorded some of the fish caught but there was little recording of other groups of animals. It was in the 20th century when regular accounts can be found for other animal groups following visits from naturalists who often published their observations in the scientific literature. For example, William Bristow visited the islands on three occasions from 1927‚Äì1934, recording spiders including on some of the uninhabited islands. The Cornwall Bird Watching and Preservation Society published bird reports from the 1930s onwards and the Isles of Scilly Bird Group (founded 2000) took over publishing their own annual reports ‚Äì Isles of Scilly Bird and Natural History Review ‚Äì which included other groups of animals such as the diptera. Planarian (flatworms) Fourteen species of terrestrial flatworms have been recorded in Britain and Ireland with five found on the Isles of Scilly. Only three or four of the fourteen species are native with two recorded on Tresco. * The Australian flatworm (Australoplana sanguinea) ‚Äì a flatworm from Australia and New Zealand and first found on Tresco in 1960.

Odonata The Atlas of the Dragonflies of Britain and Ireland published in 1996 listed just three species; blue-tailed damselfly, common darter (both breeding residents) and the migrant hawker. The pools can be slightly brackish at times and only species that can tolerate these conditions can establish populations on the islands. Steve Jones compiled a list which was published in the Cornwall Dragonfly Group Newsletter (numbers 6‚Äì8) and the list below is based on that information. In comparison, at that time, Cornwall had 23 breeding species and 28 species recorded. * Common blue damselfly (Enallagma cyathigerum) ‚Äì in 1994 an ovipositing female was at Lower Moors, St Mary's. * Blue-tailed damselfly (Ischnura elegans) ‚Äì can tolerate brackish conditions and breeds on St Agnes, St Mary's and Tresco. * Migrant hawker (Aeshna mixta) ‚Äì increased sightings since the mid-1990s on St Agnes, St Mary's and Tresco. * Southern hawker (A. cyanea) ‚Äì recorded on St Mary's in October 1992 and October 1996 and from Tresco also in October 1996. * Common hawker (A. juncea) ‚Äì Great Pool, Tresco in October 1992. * Emperor dragonfly (Anax imperator) ‚Äì individuals seen on St Mary's, September 1992 and August 1996. * Green darner (A. junius) ‚Äì At least two individuals (male and female) were found on St Agnes on 10 September 1998 (just one day after the first record for the Western Palaearctic in Cornwall, the previous day).

Reception Reviewing a 2016 performance by the pianist Sergio Tiempo and the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Mark Swed of the Los Angeles Times called the concerto \\"a work of brutalist, magical realism\\" and wrote, \\"There are atmospheric and percussive moments when the score sounds slightly too much like Argentine Bart√≥k, but there are also unusual evocations of eerie rain- forest weirdness and great thundering percussive romps. The massive solo part, fearlessly played by Sergio Tiempo, ranges from hauntingly jazzy bits to great bursts of keyboard color that the Venezuelan pianist seemed born to reveal.\\" of The New York Times similarly remarked, \\"The concerto's chugging rhythms make Ginastera's lively atonal idiom feel accessible, understandable.

She was a pioneer within her profession in her country. Barch debuted at the Royal Danish Theatre in Copenhagen at the age of 14 in the 1758-59 season. In a nation which had until then mostly stage artists of foreign origin, Barch belonged to the pioneers of Danish ballet dancers, and is among the very first identified native Danish ballet dancers: the season of 1758-59 was the perhaps first time native dancers participated in the ballet of the theater. At the time of her debut, she was engaged to her colleague and future spouse, Carl Vilhelm Barch (1743-1805), the son of a craftsman, who debuted as a dancer at the same occasion and shared her pioneer position. It is known that he, at least, had been educated by the theater's Italian ballet master Antonio Como, and it is possible that she was too. Como, formerly a member of the Italian company of Pietro Mingotti, had been appointed the first ballet master of the theater only three years before, with the task to educate its first ballet troupe. The Barch couple made a great success at their debut and became popular with the audience. She was admired for her talent and her ability and given a permanent position at the theater. In 1761, when Marie Barch was insulted by the theater's first female dancer at the time, the Italian Anna Geringhelli Como (married to the ballet master), her fianc√© complained to the ballet master, who had them both fired. This, however, caused such protests among the public that they were both given their positions back, and was great with much applause by the public at their return. The incident eventually lead to the Como couple losing their place at the theater in 1763. Barch enjoyed a successful career for forty years. Her spouse became the first Danish dancer to study abroad (Vienna, in 1763) and became second dancer, composer and titular ballet master before he retired in 1775. Marie Barch did not retire until after the 1798-99 season.

It is only found within the Pinal Mountains of central Arizona. Due to its extremely limited known range, Oligocentria pinalensis is at a high risk of becoming extinct from isolated events, such as a forest fire. There is not enough current population data to make a full conclusion of its present status. Although it has been listed by the NatureServe conservation status as \\"GH\\" or possibly extinct, date of listing of status was 2002. The species was first described by F.H. Benjamin, a pan-pacific entomologist, in a publication from 1932.  Description  Oligocentria pinalensis has been described as a medium to large sized moth, with a long forewing that typically extends two times longer than the hindwing and has a stout body for its wing size. The head has scale tufts and the antennae are bispectinate on males and filiform in females. They have a well developed proboscis that is coiled and their abdomen is densely covered in long slender scales and tufts. They are dull- colored, usually being brown, tan or gray or varying mixtures of the three colors. The larvae have bare stout bodies, and have two MD setae above their spiracle on their abdomen, versus the usual one for other members of Oligocentria.  Range  The only known range of the moth is the Pinal Mountains in Gila County, Arizona, a mountain range that covers approximately 45,760 acres.

She was active in Sweden in 1764‚Äì76, where she was regarded as one of the stars of the Royal Swedish Ballet. Marie-Ren√©e Frossard was married to her colleague Louis Frossard. She was engaged at the Com√©die-Italienne in Paris in 1757, in Vienna in 1759 and in Brussels in 1761‚Äì62. From 1764 until 1770, she and her spouse were engaged at the Du Londel Troupe in Sweden, where they were regarded as two of the most noted members. The French theater was dissolved by Gustav III of Sweden in 1771, who wished to establish a native theater, opera and ballet. When the Swedish Royal ballet was founded in 1773, however, there were almost no native ballet dancers at all, with the exception of the very few, such as Charlotte Slottsberg, who had been trained in the French theater. Ballet master Louis Gallodier therefore recommended the king to recall some of the French dancers to perform and educate native dancers as students. The Frossard couple were among those French artists employed in the first pioneer troupe of the Swedish Royal Ballet. These French dancers were the first stars of the Swedish Royal Ballet until their native students had matured as artists, and Marie-Ren√©e Frossard, Louis Frossard, Elisabeth Soligny and Ninon Dubois Le Clerc, were referred to as the foundation of the royal ballet. Aside from their position in the ballet, they also participated in the French Theater of Gustav III. The Frossards were specialists in the art form \\"danse de caract√©re et pantomime\\". During the 1774-75 season, they made a success as members of the Sami people in the opera Birger Jarl written by the king himself. Their status as elite stars is exemplified by their salaries: in 1774, the Frossards were given a salary of 25.000 $. This compared to the salary of the opera singer Lovisa Augusti who, though a star at the Royal Swedish Opera, only had $6000. The Frossards left Sweden in 1776. They were engaged at Lyon in France in 1782-85, and at the Com√©die-Italienne in Paris in 1785-91.  References  * Klas Ralf: Operan 200 √•r. Jubelboken.

Judicial Watch, a plaintiff in ongoing lawsuits pertaining to Clinton, alleged that email communications, obtained via FOIA requests, between officials at the Clinton Foundation and top aides of Secretary of State Clinton show improper ties between the Clinton Foundation and the State Department. Clinton denied these allegations. A Clinton spokesperson and others dismissed the controversy as election-year politics. Beginning in 2015, multiple investigations were conducted into alleged wrongdoing by the Foundation, including a two-year inquiry initiated by the Trump Justice Department, but through 2019 no evidence of wrongdoing was found.https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/justice-dept-winds- down-clinton-related-inquiry-once-championed-by-trump-it-found-nothing-of- consequence/2020/01/09/ca83932e-32f9-11ea-a053-dc6d944ba776_story.html Background =Foundation= The Clinton Foundation, founded in 1997 by former US President Bill Clinton is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that describes its mission as to \\"strengthen the capacity of people in the United States and throughout the world to meet the challenges of global interdependence.\\"\\"Leadership Team\\" , clintonfoundation.org; accessed September 18, 2016. Charity watchdog group Charity Navigator, which has an ongoing relationship with the Foundation, gave it its highest possible rating, four out of four stars, after its customary review of the Foundation's financial records and tax statements. =Confirmation hearings= In January 2009, when then Senator and former First Lady Hillary Clinton appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee as a nominee for Secretary of State for the Obama administration, Senator Richard Lugar (the senior Republican on the committee) said that the Foundation was ‚Äúa unique complication that would have to be managed with great care and transparency.‚Äù Lugar said that the foundation could create the impression that foreign donors were giving money to gain access at the State Department: \\"The core of the problem is that foreign governments and entities may perceive the Clinton Foundation as a means to gain favor with the Secretary of State\\". Before her confirmation as Secretary of State, Clinton approved a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the Foundation and the administration. The agreement permitted donations from governments who had contributed to the Foundation in the past, but prohibited contributions from governments that had not previously donated unless they were approved by the State Department's ethics office. The memorandum was intended to ensure that foreign governments would not view contributions to the Foundation as a means to curry favor with the US State Department. The MOU promised that the foundation would publish all contributors' names, and would seek prior approval from the State Department ethics office for new foreign donors.Bolton, Alexander. \\"Cornyn: Clinton duped Congress during confirmation\\", The Hill (September 5, 2016). Operation of Foundation =Access to Clinton= A top donor to the foundation, Raj Fernando, was placed on the International Security Advisory Board within the State Department. A piece in the Atlantic, referring to an ABC News story, described Fernando as being \\"significantly less qualified\\" than other members of that Board. The request for his appointment came from Secretary Clinton's office, and Fernando resigned shortly after ABC News made inquiries about it.Graham, David. \\"From Whitewater to Benghazi: A Clinton-Scandal Primer\\", The Atlantic (September 2, 2016): \\"She also said she was unaware of the requirement that she turn over her emails when she left office, which she said might be due in part to a concussion she suffered in 2012....\\" Dennis Cheng had served as the chief development officer of the Clinton Foundation from 2011 to 2015, when he became the national finance director of Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. =Donations by foreign entities= In February 2015, The Washington Post reported that during Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State, the Clinton Foundation accepted several million dollars in donations from seven foreign governments, in compliance with the MOU it had signed with the State Department. One donation of $500,000 from Algeria to the Clinton Foundation's Haiti relief fund was found to have not been vetted by the State Department, in violation of Clinton's agreement with the administration. The Post noted that the donation \\"coincided with a spike\\" in lobbying efforts by Algeria of the State Department regarding their human rights record. =Uranium One= From 2009‚Äì13, the Russian atomic energy agency (Rosatom) acquired Uranium One, a Canadian company with global uranium mining stakes including 20% of the uranium production capacity in the United States. Since uranium is considered a strategic asset with national security implications, the acquisition was analyzed by a committee of nine government agencies, including the State Department, which was then headed by Clinton. The voting members of the committee can object to such a foreign transaction, but the final decision then rests with the president. In April 2015, The New York Times reported that, during the acquisition, the family foundation of Uranium One's chairman made $2.35 million in donations to the Clinton Foundation. The donations which were legal were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons, despite a prior agreement to do so. In addition, a Russian investment bank with ties to the Kremlin and which was promoting Uranium One stock paid Bill Clinton $500,000 for a speech in Moscow shortly after the acquisition was announced. Numerous Republican figures, including President Trump, have accused Hillary Clinton of wrong-doing related to Uranium One. Trump said, \\"Hillary Clinton gave them 20 percent of our uranium, gave Russia, for a big payment.\\" According to the Los Angeles Times, \\"independent analysts said the facts did not support Trump‚Äôs assertion of scandal.\\" FactCheck.org reported that there was \\"no evidence\\" connecting the bribery allegations investigated by the Select Committee with the Uranium One‚ÄìRosatom merger deal. In October 2017, the Washington Post fact-checker said that the fatal flaw in the accusations levied against Clinton is that she \\"by all accounts, did not participate in any discussions regarding the Uranium One sale which ‚Äî as we noted ‚Äî does not actually result in the removal of uranium from the United States.\\" PBS mirrored the assessments by FactCheck.org and The Washington Post, noting that no uranium left the country, there is nothing to indicate Clinton was personally involved in the Uranium One sale, and that the State Department was one out of nine agencies that had to unanimously approve the Uranium One sale. In 2015, the spokesman for the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission said that \\"no Uranium One, Inc.-produced uranium has been shipped directly to Russia and the U.S. Government has not authorized any country to re-transfer U.S. uranium to Russia\\"; in 2017, the spokesman said that the statement was still true. This claim contradicts statements made by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission spokesman in 2015 who confirmed yellowcake had been shipped to Canada, and a spokeswoman for Uranium One who said \\"25 percent had gone to Western Europe and Japan.\\" On October 25, 2017 the FBI removed the \\"gag order\\" on their informant related to the Uranium One deal controversy. As the informant lawyer, Victoria Toensing, stated that the informant \\"work uncovering the Russian nuclear bribery case and the efforts he witnessed by Moscow to gain influence with the Clintons in hopes of winning favorable uranium decisions from the Obama administration\\". During a C-SPAN interview, Clinton denied being bribed to approve the deal, and that all such allegations had been \\"debunked repeatedly\\". During an interview on Lou Dobbs Tonight, Toensing was ask about what she may have learned from the informant, she claimed that \\"It‚Äôs quite significant\\", the informant ‚Äúcan tell what all the Russians were talking about during the time that all these bribery payments were made‚Äù. On November 16, 2017, during an exclusive interview with Reuters, the FBI secret informant William Douglas Campbell (former lobbyist for Tenex, the US-based arm of Rosatom) decided to speak out publicly for the first time. On March 8, 2018 The Hill reported, \\"A confidential informant [Campbell] billed by House Republicans as having ‚Äúexplosive‚Äù information about the 2010 Uranium One deal approved during Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of State provided ‚Äúno evidence of a quid pro quo‚Äù involving Clinton, Democratic staff said in a summary of the informant's closed-door testimony obtained by The Hill on Thursday.\\" CNN reported that the summary document also stated that the Justice Department had expressed concerns about Campbell's credibility due to \\"inconsistencies between Campbell's statements and documents\\" in an investigation into Tenex in 2015. =Switzerland's largest bank= When Clinton took office as Secretary of State, the Internal Revenue Service was suing Switzerland's largest bank, UBS AG, to obtain information on Americans with secret accounts at the bank. The bank's situation was complicated by the fact that, by acceding to the IRS's requests, the bank would potentially violate Switzerland's secrecy laws. Following what The Wall Street Journal referred to as \\"an unusual intervention by the top U.S. diplomat\\", Clinton announced a tentative settlement between UBS and the IRS. Based on the terms of the settlement, UBS provided information on the identities of 4,450 Americans with accounts at the bank out of a total of 52,000 requested by the IRS. The agreement was criticized by some lawmakers in the U.S. who had been seeking additional information. Following the settlement in 2009, UBS's donations to the Clinton Foundation increased significantly. Through 2008, the bank had donated $60,000 cumulatively to the Foundation. By 2014, the total had grown to $600,000. The bank also paid Bill Clinton $1.5 million for a series of question-and-answer sessions with its CEO, which was the top source of corporate speech income for Clinton between 2001 and 2014. =Emails between Clinton Foundation and State Department= A number of emails released by Judicial Watch in August 2016 from Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State included dialogue between Doug Band, an official at the Clinton Foundation and personal aide to Bill Clinton, and top aides of Hillary Clinton. In one exchange in April 2009, Band lobbied for a job at the State Department on behalf of someone else saying it was \\"important to take care of (redacted).\\" Clinton's aide, Huma Abedin, responded \\"Personnel has been sending him options\\". In June 2009, Band emailed Abedin requesting a meeting with Clinton for Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain, the heir apparent and First Deputy Prime Minister. Band referred to the Prince as ‚Äúa good friend of ours.‚Äù In 2005, the Prince had committed to contribute $32 million to scholarships through the Clinton Global Initiative. Abedin responded, offering the Prince a meeting, noting \\"We have reached out thru official channels.\\" In December 2010, Band and Abedin exchanged emails regarding efforts to obtain invitations to an official lunch with Chinese President Hu Jintao for Clinton Foundation donors. The potential guests who were discussed included Bob McCann, then-president of wealth management at UBS, Judith Rodin, Rockefeller Foundation president, and Hikmet Ersek, Western Union CEO. Band requested that Rodin be seated at the same table as Vice President Joe Biden. According to CNN, the emails \\"raise questions about the Clinton Foundation's influence on the State Department and its relations during her tenure\\". The Clinton campaign denied that the State Department took any actions based on contributions to the Clinton Foundation. Controversy The Clinton Foundation has been praised as a force for good and condemned as a \\"slush fund\\".Zurcher, Anthony. \\"US election: Why is Clinton's foundation so controversial?\\", BBC (August 23, 2016): \\"The Clinton Foundation's value is in the eye of the beholder. It has been lauded as force for good in the world. It has also been condemned as a 'slush fund' for the Clinton family and a front for official corruption\\". The fact-checking organization Politifact says it is mostly true that the Clintons do not take from the foundation any salary, any other money, nor benefit personally.Carroll, Lauren. \\"Fact-checking the Clinton Foundation controversy\\", Politifact (September 1, 2016). Supporters of the Clintons say that the controversy obscures valuable work done by the foundation.Mukherjee, Sy. \\"What Bill and Hillary Clinton's Controversial Foundation Actually Does\\", Fortune, August 27, 2016. while others assert that the foundation made it possible for donors to gain access to Secretary Clinton, and influence her official actions. =Associated Press story= In 2016, the Associated Press published a controversial story based on logs of meetings Clinton took as Secretary of State. In the story, the AP stated that at least 85 of 154 people from private interests that Clinton met or had phone conversations with while Secretary of State donated to the Clinton Foundation. In total, the 85 donors contributed as much as $156 million to the Foundation. The AP described the number as an \\"extraordinary proportion indicating her possible ethics challenges if elected president\\". The AP promoted its story with a tweet claiming that \\"more than half those who met Clinton as Cabinet secretary gave money to Clinton Foundation\\", which has been criticized because it does not make clear that the analysis was performed on meetings with people who were not federal employees or foreign government representatives among other reasons. By excluding Clinton's meetings with government officials from the U.S. and other countries, the majority of her diplomatic work, the AP's count included only a small subcategory of fewer than 5% of the people Clinton met with as secretary of state. The AP, explaining the omission, said that \\"such meetings would presumably have been part of her diplomatic duties\\". Further, among the private donors with whom Clinton met were internationally known individuals such as Melinda Gates, Elie Wiesel, and Muhammad Yunus. Reporters from other news outlets immediately noticed, and commented on, the AP's selective use of information and misleading tweet. The report was called a \\"big failure\\" in an opinion piece by Paul Reyes of CNN, because it presented \\"facts out of context and somehow built a whole report around Clinton having done nothing wrong\\".Reyes, Paul. \\"AP's 'Big Story' on Clinton Foundation is big failure\\", CNN (August 29, 2016). A piece in the Washington Monthly stated that AP \\"took some interesting information they gathered and spun it into something it wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶scandalous.\\"LeTourneau, Nancy. \\"How the AP Spun the Story About the Clinton Foundation\\", Washington Monthly (August 24, 2016). Others described the story as botched or \\"seriously flawed\\". Matthew Yglesias wrote that the AP story's conclusions \\"turned out not to be true\\".Yglesias, Matthew. \\"The AP‚Äôs big expos√© on Hillary meeting with Clinton Foundation donors is a mess\\", Vox (August 24, 2016). A Clinton spokesman said of the story, ‚ÄúIt cherry-picked a limited subset of Secretary Clinton's schedule to give a distorted portrayal of how often she crossed paths with individuals connected to charitable donations to the Clinton Foundation.‚Äù Despite criticism from other journalists, and calls from Clinton and others for the AP to retract its tweet, the AP defended its story, \\" although its Executive Editor did admit that its tweet had been \\"sloppy\\". =Transparency and foreign donations= Despite the MOU between the Clinton Foundation and the Obama Administration, the foundation's Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) failed to report donors from 2009 to 2013, though later sought to rectify that omission. A CHAI spokeswoman blamed this omission on oversight. According to PolitiFact, the Clinton Foundation was allowed to accept millions of dollars from Australia, Dominican Republic, Kuwait, Norway, Qatar and Oman because of the clause in the MOU which allows previous donors to continue to fund the foundation's programs. Conservative columnist Jennifer Rubin opined that the Qatari donation raised ethical questions because Qatar is \\"a prominent backer of Hamas.\\" Without notifying the State Department, the Clinton Foundation accepted donations from Algeria, which donated for the first time in 2010, and from the United Kingdom, which tripled its support of the foundation's health programs between 2009 and 2012. Foundation officials blamed the case of Algeria on a lack of oversight and argued that the UK donation did not constitute \\"material increase\\" in support for the foundation. Charity Watch, a nonprofit charity watchdog organization, has given the Clinton Foundation an \\"A rating\\" overall, higher than the American Red Cross, and the \\"highest rated\\" grade for \\"Transparency and Governance\\".Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, CharityWatch.org; accessed October 18, 2017. The charity watchdog group Charity Navigator gave the Clinton Foundation its highest possible rating, four out of four stars, after reviewing its financial records and tax statements. =Reaction to controversy in 2016= Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders, during his unsuccessful presidential campaign, criticized Clinton for a conflict of interest: \\"Do I have a problem when a sitting secretary of State and a foundation run by her husband collects many, many dollars from foreign governments ‚Äî governments which are dictatorships? Yeah, I do have a problem with that. Yeah, I do\\".Hellmann, Jessie. \\"Sanders hits Clinton Foundation over foreign donations\\", The Hill (June 5, 2016). Republican Senator John Cornyn, who voted for Clinton's confirmation in 2009, says that she duped Congress, that he now regrets his vote, and that President Obama should appoint a special prosecutor to investigate whether donors to the foundation gained improper access at the State Department. An August 30, 2016 editorial by The New York Times opined there was no proof that donors to the foundation received special favors from Hillary Clinton when she was Secretary of State.\\"Cutting Ties to the Clinton Foundation\\", The New York Times (August 30, 2016). However, the Times added that there was reason to question where the Clinton Foundation ended and where the State Department began. =FBI investigations= In October 2016, The Wall Street Journal reported that four field offices of the Federal Bureau of Investigation‚Äîin New York, Los Angeles, Washington, and Little Rock, Ark. -- had been collecting information about the Clinton Foundation to determine whether \\"there was evidence of financial crimes or influence-peddling.\\" According to the WSJ article, FBI officials presented their findings to the Justice Department in February 2016, but \\"the meeting didn't go well\\". Justice Department officials felt the cases were weak and saw little reason to continue the investigations. However, the New York FBI field office continued to pursue the matter, leading to reports that some New York agents were feuding with the Justice Department and basing their investigation in part on media accounts and in particular on the book Clinton Cash, written by Peter Schweizer, a senior editor-at-large for Breitbart News. In a reported separate investigation, the Washington field office had been investigating Terry McAuliffe before he became a board member of the Clinton Foundation. The Washington Post reported in January 2020 that an additional Justice Department investigation into the matter, initiated after Donald Trump took office in 2017, was winding down after finding nothing worth pursuing.

Early life and family Born in Castlemaine, Australia on 7 May 1865, Beck was the son of Sarah Beck ( Taylor) and her husband Richard Beck. Beck and his family settled in Dunedin, New Zealand shortly after his birth. Beck married Edith Chick on 8 June 1896, in Port Chalmers, New Zealand. They had three children during their marriage. Military career Beck was a Torpedoman Second Class in No 2 Service Company, Permanent Militia, Port Chalmers, in the 1890s. With the Garrison Torpedo Boat Corps abandoned by Imperial decree just after the turn of the century. Beck relocated to Auckland and by 1904 was employed by the Defence Stores Department as the Defence Storekeeper for the Northern District Stores Depot, Goal Reserve, Mount Eden, with the rank of Honorary Lieutenant in the New Zealand Staff Corps. In 1914 he was the Officer in charge of the Camp Ordnance for the Auckland Divisional Camp at Hautapu near Cambridge in April 1914. The Camp ran from 28 April to 11 May and he was responsible for managing store issued from the Auckland Defence Stores, including; > \\"66 indicating flags, 80 Axes, 100 picks and handles, 800 water buckets, 800 > wash basins, 82 picket ropes, 81 brooms, 5000 groundsheets, 13 roberts > cookers, 13 horse troughs, 20 overall suits, 1320yards galvanised iron > piping, a 2000 gal water tank, 1 large swimming bath, 11 flagstaffs, 500 > nose bags, 566 pairs of boots, 455 mattress covers, 500 blankets\\". As the Defence Storekeeper for Auckland he was soon granted the honorary rank of Captain and attached the New Zealand Staff Corps. On the declaration of World War I, Beck was mobilised deployed with the main body of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force, departing Wellington on 3 December 1914 on the troopship TSS Maunganui. Once in Suez, Egypt he was then attached to the New Zealand & Australian Headquarters Ordnance (NZ & Aust HQ Ordnance) of the New Zealand and Australian Division as the Deputy Assistant Director of Ordnance Services. Beck was part of General Godley's Headquarter and thus was amongst those in the first landing at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915. Lieutenant Colonel Fenwick, ADMS, another New Zealander, was part of the Headquarters landing party describes the events on that day: > \\"we were all ready to land but were kept waiting and waiting until about > 9.00am. Some barges were moored alongside and a string of boats outside of > these on the starboard side. Colonels Braithwaite, Chaytor and Manders, > Major Hughes and Captain Beck and I got into the first boat. We were > frightfully hampered by our kit ‚Äì overcoat, revolver, glasses, map case, > haversack, three days rations, firewood, Red Cross satchel, water bottle ‚Äì > like elephants. It was certainty that we would drown if we got sunk. > \\"After waiting, a steam picket boat came along in charge of a very fat rosy > midshipman. he took our string of boats in tow and we were off. Our boat > grounded about 50 feet from the shore and we all hopped out. Of course I > fell into a hole up to my neck. I could hardly struggle ashore and when I > did the first thing I saw was Beck sitting on a stone, roaring with laughter > at us. Billy Beck was the first New Zealander of Godley's force (there were > New Zealanders serving in the Australian Division) to get onto Gallipoli. So not only was Beck one of the first New Zealanders ashore it would appear that he was also a bit of a character and The Hawera & Normanby Star, 24 June 1916 had this to say about Captain Beck's service at Gallipoli: > Finally, there was Captain William Beck, an ordinary officer. \\"Beachy Bill\\" > was in charge of the store ‚Äì a miserable little place ‚Äì and whenever he put > his nose out of the door bullets tried to hit it. The Turkish gun in Olive > Grove was named after him, \\"Beachy Bill.\\" The store was simply a shot under > fire and Bill looked out and went on with his work just as if no bullets > were about. He was the most courteous and humorous, and no assistant at > Whiteley's could have been more pleasing and courteous than the brave > storekeeper on Anzac Beach. General Birdwood never failed to call on Captain > Beck or call out as he passed on his daily rounds, asking if he were there, > and they all dreaded that some day there would be no reply from a gaunt > figure still in death. But Captain Beck was only concerned for the safety of > his customers. He hurried them away, never himself. On 1 August Beck was transferred to duty in Alexandria never to return to Gallipoli. Beck invalided back to New Zealand on the RMS Tahiti 20 November 1915 and a medical board had found him \\"incapacitated for military duty\\" on 25 November 1915. On 16 February 1916 he transferred into the New Zealand Army Ordnance Corps on its formation. On 27 April 1916 he was stuck off the strength of the NZEF and transferred to the reserve list of officers with the rank of Captain. He then resumed his pre-war duties at the Northern District Ordnance Depot. After the war Beck was retrenched from the military as part of the post war reductions. In civilian life, he worked for the Public Works Department. He retired in Wellington and died on 15 January 1947. He was interred in the soldiers' section of the Karori Cemetery, in Wellington.

History Fort√© was created as an integrated solution for developing and managing client/server applications. Fort√© 4GL consists of an application server, tools for deploying and monitoring an application and an object oriented proprietary programming language, TOOL (transactional object oriented language). Given that TOOL only runs on the Fort√© application server, many users simply refer to their \\"TOOL\\" applications as \\"Fort√©\\" applications. The product itself was 3.5 million lines of C/C++ software, ported to approximately twelve different operating system environments, spanning the range from IBM mainframes and Microsoft Windows PC's. The first release of Fort√© 4GL was published in August 1994. After releasing this initial product, Fort√© Inc. proceeded to build several extensions including: *Web Enterprise - an HTML-wrapper interface for rich-client applications to publish their screens through web servers. *Forte Express - a rapid database GUI interface kit, released in July 1995. *Conductor - a high-performance work flow engine capable of choreographing activities, released in March 1997. *Fort√© Fusion - an integration backbone to link external systems using XML messaging and tie in with the Conductor engine. In 1999, Fort√© Software came out with a version of Forte based on java instead of TOOL, named SynerJ, also referred to as \\"Fort√© for Java\\". As with the original TOOL-based products this consisted of a development IDE, a code repository, and a runtime environment. This new java product was of interest to Sun Microsystems who bought out the company. The TOOL-based listed above were bundled together and re-branded as Unified Development Server (UDS) and Integration Server (IS) under the IPlanet division. The server modules were later bundled together as Enterprise Application Integration (EAI). Sun declared the product's end-of-life, indicating no future plans to continue development of the product. Sun's official support of Forte ceased at the end of April, 2009.Sun phases out UDS Capabilities Being an enterprise application development system, Fort√© supported close linkage to a number of different relational database systems, including Oracle, Sybase, Microsoft SQL Server, Informix, and DB2. These linkages could be via SQL embedded within the TOOL code, or via SQL constructed on the fly. It also had support for distributed applications: the developer would create an instance of a specific class, which would be placed on a user-specified server. Calls to methods through instance would be sent across the network transparently; the developer would not need to know the underlying details of how the call would be transmitted. Programming Language TOOL TOOL is an object-oriented language with the following features (among others): * automatic garbage collection * referenced based, no pointers * single inheritance and interfaces * supports multi-threaded programming * integrated statements for database access * event handling * exception handling * strong integration with GUI * one common base class called \`Object\` TOOL code is case-insensitive. A statement is always terminated by the semicolon. Compound statements are enclosed by the keywords \`begin\` and \`end\`. Comments are indicated by // or -- (remainder of line becomes a comment), /* ... */. Data Types The Simple Data Types are: * boolean * float * double * char * string * Integer data types ** i1, ui1 (signed / unsigned one byte integer) ** i2, ui2 (signed / unsigned two bytes integer) ** i4, ui4 (signed / unsigned four bytes integer) ** integer (signed four bytes integer, same as i4) ** short (signed integer, at least two bytes, same as int) ** int (signed integer, at least two bytes) ** long(signed integer, at least four bytes) The corresponding object data types are (some examples): * BooleanData, BooleanNullable * IntegerData, IntegerNullable * DoubleData, DoubleNullable * TextData, TextNullable Arrays are indicated by the keywords \`Array of\`.

Founded in 2013 by comedians Beth Newell and Sarah Pappalardo, the site has received praise from reviewers for its satirical pieces including advice columns, news stories, and listicles. History Beth Newell began taking classes and performing at the Upright Citizens Brigade (UCB) in 2005, later teaching at New York's Magnet Theater. Sarah Pappalardo was a comedy performer and writer while attending college in Chicago and worked as a freelance writer. The two founded Reductress in April 2013 after a conversation between Newell and Pappalardo about tropes they observed in popular media targeted towards women. By August 2016, the site reached 1.7 million monthly global visits, with a record monthly readership of 2.4 million hits in November 2014. In 2016, in response to a comedian being banned from the UCB after being accused of rape and sexual assault by multiple women, Reductress dedicated its entire landing page to stories satirizing the tactics of rapists and rape culture. The website has an office in the Flatiron District of Manhattan, New York. In October 2016, Reductress released a book, How To Win At Feminism: The Definitive Guide To Having It All‚ÄîAnd Then Some! Written by Newell, Pappalardo, and Anna Drezen, the book was published by HarperOne. Style and content Reductress is a feminist news satire site. Conceived as a parody of women's magazines and the clickbait headlines they often employ, the site gradually expanded its focus to satirizing the ways women's media attempt to capitalize on feminism while still espousing values \\"that make [women] feel inadequate.\\" The site has also parodied aspects of feminism, such as white feminism or feminism that lacks awareness of privilege. Reductress publishes satirical advice columns, news stories, confessionals, listicles, and profiles, paired with a stock photo. The style of its articles has been compared to that of The Onion. Newell and Pappalardo have expressed interest in creating more video content for the site. Reception Gaby Dunn of The Daily Dot described Reductress as \\"not only biting, 'goes-there' hilarious, [but] a fantastic, sad, and much-needed look at the way the media talks down to women\\". Writing for The Guardian, Morwenna Ferrier said that the site's \\"headlines are cutting, but the comedy is sometimes subtle enough to dupe readers\\", citing the headline \\"We're Piercing My Baby's Tongue\\" as an example. Brian Raftery opined in Wired that Reductress \\"quickly became one of the funniest and most focused humor outlets on the web\\" with articles like \\"Actually, I'm an Intersectional Men's Rights Activist\\" and \\"How To Friendzone Ethan While He's Still Inside You\\". Particular praise was levied for Reductress August 2016 series of articles regarding rape which were viewed as a powerful reaction to a national pattern of sexual violence and a strong example of the power of humor to \\"confront even the most seemingly unseemly topics, so long as it's done with honesty, empathy, and a shit-ton of sagacious fury.\\" See also * List of satirical news websites References External links * Mass media in New York City Internet properties established in 2013 Satirical magazines published in the United States Online magazines published in the United States American satirical websites Feminist websites ","title":"Reductress"},{"id":"51438828","text":"Yellowhawk Creek is a stream in the U.S. state of Washington.

The Navy then completed Inconstants construction. =Early service= Between 11 November and 29 December 1811 Inconstant was at Livorno, under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau Cornette de Venancourt.Fonds Marine, p.438. then between 27 August and 11 September 1812 she was at Porto Ercole and Portoferraio.Fonds Marine, p.461. She was at Portoferraio on 26 September 1813.Fonds Marine, p.480. On 18 January 1814 she was again at Livorno.Fonds Marine, p.493. =Napoleon and the Elban Navy= Following the Treaty of Fontainebleau, the victorious allies exiled Emperor Napoleon I to Elba after his forced abdication in 1814. He arrived at Portoferraio on 30 May 1814. He was allowed to keep a personal guard of six hundred men and a small navy. Inconstant left Toulon on 24 April 1814 to carry Napoleon from St Tropez to Elba, but at Napoleon's insistence, that task fell to the frigate . Still, Inconstant sailed to Elba on 25 May 1814 and three days later she was enrolled in his navy. Her role was to maintain his communications with Leghorn. For most of her time with Napoleon, Inconstant was under the command of Lieutenant Fran√ßois-Louis Taillade. She transported Napoleon and 40 troops for the re-occupation and fortification of the islands of Pianosa and Palmaiola. In addition to transporting passengers and mail between Elba and Italy, with her crew augmented by 50 soldiers, she cruised against Barbary pirates. On 6 January 1815 a gale drove Inconstant on shore. She was gotten off, with much difficulty five days later, only to have another storm again drive her ashore, this time causing even more damage. Napoleon temporarily relieved Taillade of command, replacing him with a man named Jean Fran√ßois Chautard. Taillade returned to (shared) command in time for Napoleon's departure from Elba. On 26 February 1815, Napoleon used Inconstant to escape from exile in Elba. Between 26 February and 1 March 1815 she ferried Napoleon and his generals between Elba and Golfe Juan. After Napoleon's defeat in the Hundred Days, The French navy reintegrated Inconstant in March 1815. Dryade escorted her to Toulon on 24 May. =Return to French naval service= The French navy rebuilt Inconstant at Toulon between September 1822 and her relaunching on 14 March 1823. She then took part in the Spanish expedition in 1823, which restored the monarchy in Spain and put an end to the Trienio Liberal. Inconstant notably recaptured the merchantman Nativit√©, from Marseilles, on 26 June. Between 7 April 1823 and 26 November, Inconstant was at Toulon, and then sailed on a mission to Brazil. She was under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau Abel Aubert du Petit-Thouars.Fonds Marine, p.579. Inconstant was on the Brazil station from 10 December 1823 to 6 March 1826. In August 1824 Inconstant sailed from Rio de Janeiro to S√¢o Salvador and then to Pernambuco, where she took up station. By this time Dupetit Thouars had received promotion to capitaine de fr√©gate.Fonds Marine, p.591. By 2 June 1825 Inconstant was back at Rio de Janeiro.Fonds Marine, p.607. She returned from Brazil and then was at the √âcole navale (Naval School) from 1827 to 1829. From 1 February 1829 to 9 January 1832 Inconstant was on a cruise that took her from Brest to Newfoundland and Brazil. She then underwent a refit in 1834. Inconstant left Saint Louis, Senegal on 6 February 1835 for France, ferrying officers of Africain. On 8 December 1835 Inconstant departed Brest, bound for Cayenne. She grounded in the Amazon River on 10 January 1836 but managed to refloat herself. Inconstant was stationed at French Guiana from 1838 to 1840. Fate Inconstant was condemned on 17 August 1842. She was broken up in dry dock ‚Ññ 6 at Brest, starting on 4 December 1843.

U. S. Post Office, New London, 1932. Morris B. Payne (1885-1961) was an American architect from New London, Connecticut. He was also major general in the Connecticut National Guard and commanded 43rd Infantry Division at the beginning of World War II. Life and career Morris Benham Payne was born in Waterford, Connecticut on January 19, 1885. He attended the public schools. Wishing to become a civil engineer, he entered the offices of Daball & Crandall, a New London engineering firm. from 1906 to 1912 he was employed by the United States engineering department. When he left government work in 1912, he established a partnership with architect James S. Duffy as Duffy & Payne, architects and engineers. They went separate ways in 1913, and Payne worked alone for the next two years.A Modern History of New London County, Connecticut. Ed. Benjamin Tinkham Marshall. Vol. 2. New York: Lewis Historical Publishing Co., 1922. In late 1915, he established a partnership with B. Bouis Adams, an architect from Washington, DC.American Contractor 11 Dec. 1915: 67. Payne went abroad to France in 1917 with the Coast Artillery Corps, at which point Adams managed the office alone. Due to his declining health in Payne's absence, he closed the office in late 1918,American Architect 14 Aug. 1918: 206. Boston. and died in February 1919. Payne returned in January of that year, and after Adams' death, established a new partnership, Payne & Griswold, with Harry Todd Griswold.American Contractor 23 Aug. 1919: 32. Chicago. Edward R. Keefe joined the partnership in 1920, which became Payne, Griswold & Keefe. Griswold withdrew in 1922, after which point the firm existed as Payne & Keefe.American Contractor 13 May 1922: 37. New York. Payne & Keefe existed at least through the early 1950s. =Military career= Payne enlisted in the Connecticut National Guard in 1902 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Coast Artillery Corps in 1906. He was promoted to major in 1912 and was mobilized for service on the Mexican border in 1916. He was remobilized in 1917 and served on active duty during World War I. After the war, he was promoted to colonel in 1921 and brigadier general in 1923 when he was appointed Quartermaster General of the Connecticut National Guard. On July 18, 1927 he was promoted to major general and placed in command of the 43rd Division. In February 1941 the division was mobilized and Payne served as its commander until he was relieved of command in August of that year. Payne's relief was, apparently, not due to any misconduct on his part but because of an Army policy to replace National Guard division commanders with Regular Army officers. =Death and burial= Payne died on January 31, 1961 and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery. He was an active Freemason. Legacy One of Payne's buildings, the U. S. Post Office in New London, has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In addition, many of his works in New London, Old Lyme, and Groton contribute to listed historic districts. In a 1921 publication detailing Connecticut domestic architecture, the work of Payne's firm was described as \\"...in the style so highly esteemed by the Founders. The people here seem to revere the architectural traditions of their old homes, but it appears to be a reverence thoroughly intermixed with discriminatory appreciation which counts for a clientele that stimulates because of its intelligent enthusiasm\\".\\"Perpetuating Colonial Traditions\\".

Personal life Louis Ginsberg was born in Newark, New Jersey on October 1, 1895, to Pincus Ginsberg and Rebecca Schectman Ginsberg. His siblings included Abraham (Abe), Rose, Clara, and Hannah (Honey). Louis was stimulated to write poetry by Margaret Coult, a high school teacher who had him read Milton's L'Allegro or Il Penseroso, and write a poem like it. He retired from Central High School in 1961, although he began to teach grammar and composition at the Paterson, New Jersey extension of Rutgers University until 1976. Louis and Naomi had two sons, Eugene Brooks Ginsberg in 1921 and Allen Ginsberg in 1926, both of whom became poets. Their marriage ended in divorce due to Naomi's institutionalization for mental illness. Her illness was the focal point for Allen's poem Kaddish, in which he wrote: \\"and Louis needing a poor divorce, he wants to get married soon\\". Louis married Edith Ginsberg in 1950 with whom he spent the rest of his life. Louis died on July 6, 1976, and his son Allen, who learned to rhyme from his father, wrote the rhyming poem, Father Death Blues for him on July 8, 1976 over Lake Michigan. The last stanza of this poem appears on Allen Ginsberg's gravestone, which is between the gravestones for Louis and Edith. Portraits of the Ginsberg family were taken by photographer Richard Avedon and exhibited at the Gagosian Gallery and the Israel Museum. Poetry Louis' poems appeared in The Nation, The New Republic, The New York Times, Munsey's Magazine, The Forum, Rutgers' Alumni Quarterly, The Philadelphia Inquirer, Contemporary Verse, The Masses, the New York Evening Post, Argosy, the Newark Evening News and other periodicals, as well as in Modern American Poetry: A Critical Anthology, Third Revised Edition (1925) and Modern British Poetry, both edited by Louis Untermeyer. Louis' first book of poetry, The Attic of the Past and other Lyrics, was privately published. He subsidized the publishing of The Everlasting Minute in 1937. In 1970, William Morrow and Company published Morning in Spring, his third book and the first book that he did not have to subsidize. Allen Ginsberg wrote the introduction to this book. Louis' last book, Our Times, was never published on its own. Michael Fournier collected and edited his poems, including those that would have been in Our Times. Microscope A lost poem by Louis Ginsberg, entitled Microscope, was found in a copy of the seventeenth edition of Simon Henry Gage's book The Microscope in the Rare and Manuscript Collections at Cornell University. Puns Louis Ginsberg published puns in the Newark Star Ledger under the heading \\"Keep an O'Pun Mind\\". He often asked and answered, \\"Is life worth living? It depends on the liver.\\" His collection of puns was never published but they can be found in Box 2, Folder 9 in the Louis Ginsberg Papers at Stanford University. Louis Ginsberg, who died of liver and spleen cancer, told his son Allen Ginsberg, \\"I never thought my pun would come back to bite me.\\" Letters The letters written between Louis Ginsberg and his son Allen Ginsberg were edited by Michael Schumacher and published as Family Business: Selected Letters Between a Father and Son.

On 1 July 1993, the aircraft operating the flight, a Fokker F28 Fellowship 3000 registered as PK-GFU, crashed into the sea after it struck a small hill near Jefman Airport. Forty-one people were killed in the crash. The crash was the deadliest in Merpati Nusantara Airlines' history. Investigators concluded that the pilot of the aircraft unintentionally flew into high terrain. Subsequent damage caused the aircraft to crash into the sea off Jefman Airport. Accident On 1 July 1993, the Fokker F28 Fellowship was approaching Jefman Airport at a relatively low height. Survivors recalled that the distance between the ground and the aircraft was less than one metre. The aircraft suddenly climbed then the left landing gear struck the summit of a small hill. Survivors stated that there was a loud bang when it happened. Some passengers were thrown from their seats inside the aircraft. Parts of the wing detached, and the aircraft began to spin. The aircraft then overran the airport and crashed into the sea, breaking into three main sections. Most of the victims were found still strapped to their seats and several bodies floated to the surface. Search and rescue units were deployed immediately after the crash. Local fishermen arrived first on the crash site and helped a young boy and a man from the site. Several people survived the crash, but some died from their injuries. A man survived the crash and saved an unconscious boy from the water. While handing the boy over to a local fisherman, he suddenly became unconscious and later died. News of the crash began to break at 15:00 - 16:00 WIB. Relatives of the victims were informed about the crash and were transported to the crash site. They arrived the following day. The evacuation process was relatively quick, as the crash site was easily accessible. Aircraft The aircraft involved in the crash was a Fokker F28 Fellowship 3000 registered as PK-GFU with a serial number of 11131. The aircraft had its first flight in April 1978. It was delivered the same year and after service with Garuda Indonesia it was sold to Merpati Nusantara Airlines in 1989. Investigation Weather conditions were reported as bad at the time of the crash. Eyewitnesses stated that heavy rain was accompanied by strong wind. Merpati spokesman also stated that the weather in and around Sorong was \\"inclement\\", including the area of Jefman Airport. Thick black clouds could be seen at the time of the crash. Reports revealed that air traffic controllers had warned the crew of Flight 724 to abort their landing attempt and divert to Biak Airport. However, the pilot of Flight 724 insisted on landing at Jefman Airport. When the pilot started the descent the aircraft turned towards the sea instead of the runway. The pilot seemed to be disoriented due to the inclement weather conditions. Seconds later, the crew realized their mistakes and executed a climb, but failed. The front part of the aircraft did manage to avoid the hill, however the rear part of the aircraft hit it. The aircraft then broke into three sections and crashed into the sea.

The pipeline was projected to run from the Bakken oil fields in western North Dakota to southern Illinois, crossing beneath the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers, as well as under part of Lake Oahe near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation. Many in the Standing Rock tribe and surrounding communities consider the pipeline to constitute a serious threat to the region's water. The construction is also seen as a direct threat to ancient burial grounds and cultural sites of historic importance. In April 2016, youth from Standing Rock and surrounding Native American communities organized a campaign to stop the pipeline, calling themselves, \\"ReZpect Our Water\\". Inspired by the youth, several adults, including Joye Braun of the Indigenous Environmental Network and tribal historian LaDonna Brave Bull Allard established a water protectors' camp as a center for direct action, spiritual resistance to the pipeline, cultural preservation, and defense of Indigenous sovereignty. Over the summer, the youth undertook a cross-country run from Standing Rock to Washington D.C. to raise awareness of the struggle. The #NoDAPL hashtag began to trend on social media and, gradually, the camps at Standing Rock grew to thousands of people. Attempts to remove the protesters gained a great deal of media attention. In September 2016, construction workers bulldozed a section of privately owned land the tribe had claimed as sacred ground, and when protesters trespassed into the area security workers used attack dogs which bit at least six of the protesters and one horse. In October 2016, police with riot gear and military equipment cleared an encampment that was directly in the proposed pipeline's path. In November 2016, police use of water cannons on protesters in freezing weather drew significant media attention. During the protest numerous high- profile activists and Congressional Democrats spoke out for the rights of the tribe. Bernie Sanders actively supported the movement and President Obama spoke with tribal leaders and offered his support. Standing Rock Chairman David Archambault II, who was himself arrested and strip searched while protesting, gave numerous interviews explaining the tribe's positions; he also addressed the tribe's positions at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland. In December 2016, under President Barack Obama's administration the Corps of Engineers denied an easement for construction of the pipeline under the Missouri River. On January 24, 2017, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that reversed the Obama legislation and advanced the construction of the pipeline, expediting the environmental review, which Trump described as an \\"incredibly cumbersome, long, horrible permitting process.\\" On February 7, 2017, President Trump authorized the Army Corps of Engineers to proceed, ending the environmental impact assessment and the associated public comment period. The pipeline was completed by April and its first oil was delivered on May 14, 2017. A United States District Judge ruled in March 2020 that the government had not studied the pipeline's \\"effects on the quality of the human environment\\" enough, ordering the United States Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a new environmental impact review. In July 2020, a District Court judge issued a ruling for the pipeline to be shut down and emptied of oil pending a new environmental review. The temporary shutdown order was overturned by a U.S. appeals court on August 5, though the environmental review was ordered to continue.

The pipeline was planned by Dakota Access, LLC, a subsidiary of the Dallas, Texas corporation Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. It begins in the Bakken oil fields in Northwest North Dakota and travels in a more or less straight line southeast, through South Dakota and Iowa, ending at the oil terminal near Patoka, Illinois. According to court records, the pipeline was due for delivery on January 1, 2017. Routing the pipeline across the Missouri River near Bismarck was rejected because of the route's proximity to municipal water sources; residential areas; and road, wetland, and waterway crossings. The Bismarck route would also have been 11 miles (18 km) longer. The alternative selected by the Corps of Engineers crosses underneath the Missouri River half a mile (800 m) from the Standing Rock Indian Reservation and parallels the existing Northern Border Pipeline. A spill could have major adverse effects on the waters that the Tribe and individuals in the area rely upon. Using a permit process that treated the pipeline as a series of small construction sites, the pipeline was granted an exemption from the environmental review required by the Clean Water Act and the National Environmental Policy Act. However, citing potential effects on the Native tribes, most notably the Standing Rock Sioux, in March and April 2016 the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Interior (DOI), and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation asked the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a formal Environmental Impact Assessment and issue an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). Noting that the water system serving Fort Yates on the Standing Rock Reservation was only 10 miles (16 km) downstream of where the pipeline would cross Lake Oahe and the Missouri River, the EPA recommended that the Army Corps revise its Environmental Assessment and open up a second public comment period. \\"Based on our improved understanding of the project setting, we also recommend addressing additional concerns regarding environmental justice and emergency response actions to spills/leaks.\\" The DOI also expressed concerns about the pipeline's proximity to the tribe's water source: > The routing of a 12- to 30-inch crude oil pipeline in close proximity to and > upstream of the Reservation is of serious concern to the Department. When > establishing the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's permanent homeland, the U.S. > reserved waters of sufficient quantity and quality to serve the purposes of > the Reservation. The Department holds more than 800,000 acres of land in > trust for the Tribe that could be impacted by a leak or spill. Further, a > spill could impact the waters that the Tribe and individual tribal members > residing in that area rely upon for drinking and other purposes. We believe > that, if the pipeline's current route along the edge of the Reservation > remains an option, the potential impact on trust resources in this > particular situation necessitates full analysis and disclosure of potential > impacts through the preparation of an [Environmental Impact Statement]. As of September 2016, the United States Department of Justice had received more than 33,000 petitions to review all permits and order a full review of the project's environmental effects. Sacred Stone Camp Sacred Stone Camp Campsite location Sacred Stone Camp was founded by Standing Rock's Historic Preservation Officer, LaDonna Brave Bull Allard, on April 1, 2016, as a center for cultural preservation and spiritual resistance to the Dakota Access pipeline. In the spring and early summer of 2016, Allard and other Indigenous leaders focused on media outreach, resulting in tribal delegations and individuals coming to stand with them from all over the country and, eventually, the world. As the numbers grew beyond what Allard's land could support, an overflow camp was also established nearby, which came to be known as the Oƒçh√©thi ≈†ak√≥wi≈ã camp (the Lak»ü√≥tiyapi name for the Great Sioux Nation or Seven Fires Council). In September, Allard said: > Of the 380 archaeological sites that face desecration along the entire > pipeline route, from North Dakota to Illinois, 26 of them are right here at > the confluence of these two rivers. It is a historic trading ground, a place > held sacred not only by the Sioux Nations, but also the Arikara, the Mandan, > and the Northern Cheyenne... The U.S. government is wiping out our most > important cultural and spiritual areas. And as it erases our footprint from > the world, it erases us as a people. These sites must be protected, or our > world will end, it is that simple. Our young people have a right to know who > they are. They have a right to language, to culture, to tradition. The way > they learn these things is through connection to our lands and our history. > If we allow an oil company to dig through and destroy our histories, our > ancestors, our hearts and souls as a people, is that not genocide? By late September NBC News reported that members of more than 300 federally recognized Native American tribes were residing in the three main camps, alongside an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 pipeline resistance supporters. Several thousand more gathered at the camps on weekends. As winter approached numbers grew lower, but the protesters winterized and prepared for an indefinite stay. In October another camp, called \\"Winter Camp\\", was established via trespassing on private property directly in the proposed pipeline's path on the property recently purchased by Energy Transfer Partners. Citing eminent domain, the Native American protesters declared that the land rightly belongs to them under the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1851). Though the initial territory agreed to in the treaty was later broken up into smaller reservations, the treaty was never nullified and was being invoked as law. On October 27, police in riot gear with crowd control equipment and supported by National Guard members removed the protesters from the new encampment.  Indigenous youth groups = ReZpect Our Water = ReZpect Our Water - logo of the water runners, youth who ran from Standing Rock to Washington DC to protest the Dakota Access Pipeline in the summer of 2016 ReZpect Our Water is an indigenous youth group that formed to oppose the pipeline. They have been very active in raising public awareness through social media, petitions, teach-ins, rallies, and videos. In May 2016, 13-year-old Anna Lee Rain Yellowhammer and thirty young people launched a petition that opposed the pipeline. It quickly gathered over 80,000 signatures, including celebrity endorsements such as Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Russell. In April 2016, ReZpect Our Water organized a 2,000 mile cross-country \\"spiritual run\\" from North Dakota to Washington, D.C., to protest the construction of the pipeline. Upon the groups arrival they delivered a petition with 160,000 signatures to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Speaking about the legacy of indigenous women's activism in a June 2016 interview with Truthout, Tokata Iron Eyes, a 12-year-old Lakota girl who has been one of the leading youth organizers in the campaign, said: > Women were the people who held the tribe together and they were the > willpower of the tribe and its strength. So, just knowing that we come from > such powerful genes makes us feel strong inside. Activist Naomi Klein also interviewed Iron Eyes; she posted a Facebook video of the interview which gained more than a million views in 24 hours. = The International Indigenous Youth Council = The International Indigenous Youth Council has also been active in protests against the pipeline and advocacy for Native American needs. The group was founded by Jaslyn Charger (Cheyenne River Sioux of Eagle Butte, South Dakota). Tara Houska (Ojibwe, Couchiching First Nation of International Falls, Minnesota), national campaigns director of Honor the Earth, has actively helped to explain the protest aims. Eryn Wise (Jicarilla Apache and Laguna tribes), Council communications director, hopes to relate history from the Indigenous people's point of view: \\"We don't ever hear the narrative of indigenous people. We hear people writing our narratives for us.\\" Protests Standing Rock Water protectors In September 2014, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribal (SRST) council met with Energy Transfer representatives for an initial consultation, which was more than a month before the pipeline's first formal submission to the Army Corps.{{cite web url=https://digitalcommons.law.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1134&context;=jelr/  title=The Untold Story of the Dakota Access Pipeline: How Politics Almost Undermined the Rule of Law  journal=LSU Journal of Energy Law and Resources  date=June 6, 2018  accessdate=October 20, 2020  author=Daryl Owen} At the beginning of the meeting, Councilman David Archambault II indicated the tribe's opposition to the project within treaty boundaries, stating, \\"So just that you know: this is something that the tribe is not supporting.\\" Additional SRST representatives voiced opposition and concerns about the pipeline. Pipeline protests were reported as early as October 2014, when Iowa community and environmental activists presented 2,300 petitions to Iowa Governor Terry Branstad asking him to sign a state executive order to stop it. Voicing concerns for damage to wildlife habitat and sacred sites, the Sac & Fox Tribe of the Mississippi in Iowa (Meskwaki Nation) also objected to the route and formally lodged their opposition in early 2015. Tribal members were also among those who opposed the Keystone XL pipeline. In a letter to the Iowa Utilities Board, Tribal chairwoman Judith Bender wrote: > As a people that have lived in North America for thousands of years, we have > environmental concerns about the land and drinking water... Our main concern > is Iowa's aquifers might be significantly damaged. And it will only take one > mistake and life in Iowa will change for the next thousands of years. We > think that should be protected, because it is the water that gives Iowa the > best way of life. The tribe sued for an injunction on the grounds that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had failed to conduct a proper environmental and cultural impact study. Protests had escalated at the pipeline site in North Dakota, with numbers swelling from just a bare handful of people to hundreds and then thousands over the summer. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe believes that the pipeline would put the Missouri River, the water source for the reservation, at risk. They pointed out two recent spills on other pipeline systems, a 2010 pipeline spill into the Kalamazoo River in Michigan, which cost over billion to clean up with significant contamination remaining, and a 2015 Bakken crude oil spill into the Yellowstone River in Montana. The Tribe was also concerned that the pipeline route may run through sacred Sioux sites. In August 2016 protests were held, halting a portion of the pipeline near Cannon Ball, North Dakota. Protests continued and drew indigenous people from throughout North America, as well as other supporters. A number of planned arrests occurred when people locked themselves to heavy machinery. On August 23, Standing Rock Sioux Tribe released a list of 87 tribal governments who wrote resolutions, proclamations and letters of support stating their solidarity with Standing Rock and the Sioux people. Since then, many more Native American organizations, politicians, environmental groups and civil rights groups joined the effort in North Dakota, including the Black Lives Matter movement, indigenous leaders from the Amazon Basin of South America, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, the 2016 Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein and her running mate Ajamu Baraka, and many more. The Washington Post called it a \\"National movement for Native Americans.\\" As of September, the protest constituted the single largest gathering of Native Americans in more than 100 years. =Security firm use of dogs and pepper spray against protesters= On September 3, 2016, during Labor Day weekend, the Dakota Access Pipeline brought in a private security firm when the company used bulldozers to dig up part of the pipeline route that contained possible burial sites and culturally significant artifacts; it was subject to a pending injunction motion. The bulldozers arrived within a day after the tribe filed legal action. Energy Transfer bulldozers cut a two-mile (3200 m) long, 150-foot (45 m) wide path through the contested area. The report by Goodman When protesters crossed the perimeter fence onto private property to stop the bulldozers, they were confronted with pepper spray and guard dogs. At least six protesters were treated for dog bites, and an estimated 30 were pepper-sprayed before the guards and their dogs left the scene in trucks. A woman that had taken part in the incident stated, \\"The cops watched the whole thing from up on the hills. It felt like they were trying to provoke us into being violent when we're peaceful.\\" The incident was filmed by Amy Goodman and a crew from Democracy Now! Footage shows several people with dog bites and a dog with blood on its muzzle. Frost Kennels of Hartville, Ohio, acknowledged that they were involved in the incident on September 3. Executive director for Private Investigator Security Guard Services Geoff Dutton said Frost Kennels and its owner, Bob Frost, were not licensed by the state of Ohio to provide security services or guard dogs. Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier said they were investigating both sides in the incident, including wounds inflicted by the dogs, and that they had no prior knowledge of the use of dogs until a 9-1-1 call was made. When asked why the deputies who witnessed the incident did not intervene, Kirchmeier cited officer security concerns, and said: > Any suggestion that today's event was a peaceful protest is false. This was > more like a riot than a protest. Individuals crossed onto private property > and accosted private security officers with wooden posts and flag poles. The > aggression and violence displayed here today is unlawful and should not be > repeated. While no arrests were made at the scene, we are actively > investigating the incident and individuals who organized and participated in > this unlawful event. After viewing footage of the attack, a law enforcement consultant who trains police dogs called it \\"absolutely appalling\\" and \\"reprehensible\\". \\"Taking bite dogs and putting them at the end of a leash to intimidate, threaten and prevent crime is not appropriate.\\" A former K-9 officer for the Grand Forks Police Department who now owns a security firm that uses dogs for drug detection said, \\"It reminded me of the civil rights movement back in the '60s. I didn't think it was appropriate. They were overwhelmed and it just wasn't proper use of the dogs.\\" The American Civil Liberties Union of North Dakota spoke out against the use of dogs and pepper spray and asked that the state officials \\"treat everyone fairly and equally.\\" Speaking on September 4, Ojibwe activist and former Green Party vice presidential candidate Winona LaDuke said, \\"North Dakota regulators are really, I would say, in bed with the oil industry and so they have looked the other way.\\" = High-profile arrests = On August 11‚Äì12, 18 people were arrested, including Standing Rock Tribal Chairman David Archambault II who was charged with disorderly conduct. Along with the tribal council, Archambault had sued the Army Corps of Engineers days before his arrest. He was himself sued on August 16 by Dakota Access, LLC, which sought \\"restraining orders and unspecified monetary damages.\\" On August 30, 2 women, Ruby Montoya and Jessica Reznicek were arrested for conspiracy to damage an energy facility, four counts each of malicious use of fire and the use of fire to commit a felony. The two set fire to machinery and tools and then used a torch to pierce the metal piping and valves. The charges they were indicted for carry up to 110 years in prison, one of the largest sentences on environmental activists in the past decade. On September 7 an arrest warrant was also issued in Morton County for Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein and her running mate Ajamu Baraka on misdemeanor counts of criminal trespass and criminal mischief. Stein had spray-painted \\"I approve this message\\" and Baraka wrote the word \\"decolonize\\" on a bulldozer. A warrant for journalist Amy Goodman's arrest was issued by Morton County on September 8. She was charged with criminal trespass related to the filming done on September 3. The prosecutor, Ladd Erickson, said Goodman was like a protester because she was only giving time to the protesters' side of the story. In response to praise from Erickson, Matt Taibbi wrote, \\"a prosecutor who arrests a reporter because he doesn't think she's 'balanced' enough is basically telling future reporters what needs to be in their stories to avoid arrest. This is totally improper and un-American.\\" On October 1, Canadian journalist Ed Ou, on assignment with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to cover the protests, was detained at the US border for six hours, with his cell phones and other electronic media confiscated. Ou was eventually denied entry to the US without explanation. The American Civil Liberties Union requested that any data collected from Ou's electronic devices be destroyed and that he be given assurance that he would not be harassed again. Speaking on October 5, Standing Rock Tribal Chairman David Archambault II said that as of that date 135 anti- pipeline demonstrators had been arrested. Archambault also said that law enforcement officers were \\"heightening the danger\\" by using anti-riot gear. Saying, \\"Confronting men, women, and children while outfitted in gear more suited for the battlefield is a disproportionate response\\", Amnesty International also expressed concern about the militant response to the protesters. On October 13, Goodman announced her intention to turn herself in to the Morton County‚ÄìMandan Corrections Center on Monday, October 17, to face misdemeanor riot charges. (Though she had originally been charged with criminal trespass, the prosecutor said that there were \\"legal issues with proving the notice of trespassing requirements in the statute.\\") She stated that she would be fighting the charges against her as a First Amendment violation. The Committee to Protect Journalists, the North Dakota Newspaper Association, the American Civil Liberties Union in North Dakota, and the Freedom of the Press Foundation all expressed concern over the developing challenge to freedom of the press. On October 17, District Judge John Grinsteiner did not find probable cause for multiple riot charges, including the one brought against Goodman. Following the judge's decision, Kirchmeier reasserted that trespassing would lead to arrest, while the state prosecutor said that the investigation would remain open pending new evidence. = Harsh treatment = As of mid-October, there had been over 140 arrests. Some protesters who were arrested for misdemeanors and taken to the Morton County jail reported what they considered harsh and unusual treatment. Sara Jumping Eagle, a physician on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, said that she was required to remove all of her clothing and \\"squat and cough\\" when she was arrested for disorderly conduct. In another such case, LaDonna Brave Bull Allard, who founded Sacred Stone Camp, said that when her daughter was arrested and taken into custody she was \\"strip-searched in front of multiple male officers, then left for hours in her cell, naked and freezing.\\" Cody Hall from Cheyenne River Reservation in South Dakota also reported being strip- searched. He was held for four days without bail or bond and then charged with two misdemeanors. Actress Shailene Woodley, arrested on October 10 along with 27 others, also said she was strip-searched, adding, \\"Never did it cross my mind that while trying to protect clean water, trying to ensure a future where our children have access to an element essential for human survival, would I be strip-searched. I was just shocked.\\" Amnesty International spoke out against the use of strip searches and said that they had sent a letter to the Morton County Sheriff's Department expressing concern about the degree of force used against people taking part in the protests. They sent a delegation of human rights observers to monitor law enforcement's response to the protests. Protesters said they were blasted with high-pitched sound cannons and described being held in \\"what appeared to be\\" dog kennels, with identifying numbers written on their arms. Linda Black Elk tweeted, \\"Our sisters who got arrested were stripped, marked with numbers, and held in dog kennels. Sound familiar?\\" = Police move to clear camp = On October 27, 2016 police from several agencies, including North Dakota state troopers, the National Guard, and other law enforcement agencies from surrounding states, began an intensive operation to clear out a protest camp and blockades along Highway 1806. The Morton County Sheriff's Department said in a statement: \\"Protesters' escalated unlawful behavior this weekend by setting up illegal roadblocks, trespassing onto private property and establishing an encampment, has forced law enforcement to respond at this time. I can't stress it enough, this is a public safety issue. We cannot have protesters blocking county roads, blocking state highways, or trespassing on private property.\\" A Seattle Times journalist present at the confrontation described it as \\"scary\\". On the PBS Newshour, she said that she had spent the previous night in the camp \\"with tribal members who were singing their death songs. I mean, they were very worried about the possibility of violence. And who wouldn't be? You have seen law enforcement marshaled from six states, armored personnel carriers, hundreds and hundreds of law enforcement officers with concussion grenades, mace, Tasers, batons. And they used all of it. I mean, it was frightening to watch.\\" She said that the confrontation ended the following day and said, \\"the law enforcement officers had advance[d] more than 100 yards with five armored personnel carriers side by side, hundreds of law enforcement officers advancing on them. And it finally took an elder to actually walk by himself in between the two lines, stand there, face his people, and say: 'Go home. We're here to fight the pipeline, not these people, and we can only win this with prayer.'\\" Responding to the confrontation, on October 28 Amnesty International published a press release saying in part: \\"These people should not be treated like the enemy. Police must keep the peace using minimal force appropriate to the situation. Confronting men, women, and children while outfitted in gear more suited for the battlefield is a disproportionate response. Under International law and standards, arrests should not be used to intimidate or prevent people from participating in peaceful assembly.\\" Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza contrasted the aggressive police action with the treatment of the organizers of a standoff at an Oregon wildlife refuge (acquitted of federal charges on the same day as the police raid of the camp), saying \\"If you're white, you can occupy federal property ... and get found not guilty. No teargas, no tanks, no rubber bullets ... If you're indigenous and fighting to protect our earth, and the water we depend on to survive, you get tear gassed, media blackouts, tanks and all that.\\" =Protesters move to clear blocked bridge and police respond= On the evening of November 20, protesters attempted to open Backwater Bridge on Highway 1806, which had been blocked since October 27. The bridge is about a mile (1600 m) south of where the pipeline developer plans to drill. According to the sheriff's department, the bridge was closed for safety reasons \\"due to damage caused after protesters set numerous fires\\" on it on October 27. But the protesters believe that the police used the closure to \\"lock [them] in\\" and that the closure blocked access for emergency vehicles coming from the north. According to news reports, the police launched an attack on the protesters with water cannons in weather, along with teargas, rubber bullets, and concussion grenades, injuring hundreds. The police said the protesters had been \\"very aggressive\\" and that the water was used to put out multiple fires they had set, while the protesters said the fires were peaceful bonfires used to keep warm. A number of videos posted on social media show protesters being doused with continuous streams of water. Initially the Morton County Sheriff's Office said the water was used only to put out fires, but the following day Sheriff Kirchmeier corrected that statement, saying, \\"Some of the water was used to repel some of the protest activities\\" and adding that it was \\"sprayed more as a mist and we didn't want to get it directly on them but we wanted to make sure to use it as a measure to keep everybody safe.\\" A woman's arm was seriously injured by an explosion that protesters claimed was part of a concussion grenade but which police suggest may have been an exploding propane canister. The victim's father stated in a press conference that his daughter had seen a police officer throw the explosive device directly at her as she was backing away. The Morton County Sheriff's Department denied using concussion grenades, and reported that protesters were throwing expended propane canisters at police during this period. Law enforcement, including the ATF and North Dakota Bureau of Criminal Investigation, are investigating the incident. By December the protest camp had dwindled to a few hundred people due to the construction work stoppage and harsh winter weather. Standing Rock Chairman Dave Archambault called for the camp to disband because of the weather and the possibility of contamination of the river with garbage and debris during the spring flood. He asked people to clean up the area and to leave. In January 2017, it was reported that the cost of policing the pipeline protests in North Dakota had surpassed $22 million. In February 2017, amid concerns that warmer weather would accelerate flooding of the area, removal of garbage and debris from the campsite began to prevent the contamination of the river. Archambault indicated that funds from the $6 million in donations the tribe received to support its fight would be used to clean up the garbage, building material and human waste at the camp. The tribe began coordinating cleanup of the site in January 2017. =Police clear remaining protesters from camp= On February 22, 2017, the protest site was cleared. Although many left voluntarily, ten people were arrested. On February 23, National Guard and law enforcement officers evicted the remaining protesters. Thirty-three people were arrested. After the protest site was abandoned, sanitation crews cleared garbage from the protest; this included abandoned cars and human waste. Also abandoned were 12 dogs. North Dakota Department of Emergency Services estimated that about 48 million pounds of garbage was removed; the cost of cleaning up the protest site was about $1 million. Standing Rock Sioux Tribe legal proceedings Lake Oahe in winter On July 27, 2016, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe sued the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to stop the pipeline. The tribe also sought a preliminary injunction. On September 9, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg denied the motion. Later the same day, a joint statement was issued by the US Departments of Justice, Army, and Interior temporarily halting the project on federal land bordering or under the Lake Oahe reservoir. The US federal government asked the company for a \\"voluntary pause\\" on construction near that area until further study was done on the region extending 20 miles (32 km) around Lake Oahe. In closing the agency representatives said: > Finally, we fully support the rights of all Americans to assemble and speak > freely. In recent days, we have seen thousands of demonstrators come > together peacefully, with support from scores of sovereign tribal > governments, to exercise their First Amendment rights and to voice heartfelt > concerns about the environment and historic, sacred sites. It is now > incumbent on all of us to develop a path forward that serves the broadest > public interest. Energy Transfer Partners rejected the request to voluntarily halt construction on all surrounding private land and resumed construction within 48 hours. On September 13, chairman and CEO of Energy Transfer Partners Kelcy Warren responded to the federal government's request, saying concerns about the pipeline's impact on the water supply were \\"unfounded.\\" Warren said that \\"multiple archaeological studies conducted with state historic preservation offices found no sacred items along the route\\". They did not indicate that they would voluntarily cease work on the pipeline. Warren wrote that the company will meet with officials in Washington \\"to understand their position and reiterate our commitment to bring the Dakota Access Pipeline into operation.\\" On October 5, federal appeals judges heard arguments over whether to stop work on the pipeline; a ruling was not expected for several weeks. At that time the Army Corps of Engineers had not yet made a final decision on whether to grant an easement to build under the Missouri River. Under questioning, a pipeline attorney said that \\"if the court allowed it, the company would continue building up to the lake's edge even before the easement decision, because each extra month of delay will cost the company more than $80 million\\". =Army Corps of Engineers delays decision= On November 14, the Army Corps of Engineers said it needed more time to study the impact of the plan. In a news release, they said: \\"The Army has determined that additional discussion and analysis are warranted in light of the history of the Great Sioux Nation's dispossessions of lands, the importance of Lake Oahe to the Tribe, our government-to-government relationship, and the statute governing easements through government property.\\" Energy Transfer Partners responded by criticizing the Obama administration for \\"political interference\\" and said that \\"further delay in the consideration of this case would add millions of dollars more each month in costs which cannot be recovered.\\" North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple criticized the decision saying the pipeline would be safe and that the decision was \\"long overdue\\". Craig Stevens, spokesman for the MAIN Coalition, a labor group, called the Corps's announcement \\"yet another attempt at death by delay\\" and said the Obama administration \\"has chosen to further fan the flames of protest by more inaction.\\" North Dakota Senator John Hoeven said in a statement that the delay \\"will only prolong the disruption in the region caused by protests and make life difficult for everyone who lives and works in the area.\\" Speaking on the PBS Newshour on November 16, Energy Transfer Partners CEO Kelcy Warren responded to questions about the Tribe's two main concerns, damage to ancestral sites and the potential of water contamination if a leak occurred: > Well, first of all, I think this is well known by now. We're not on any > Indian property at all, no Native American property. We're on private lands. > That's number one. Number two, this pipeline is new steel pipe. We're boring > underneath Lake Oahe. It's going to go 90 feet to 150 feet (27.5-45.7 m) > below the lake's surface. It's thick wall pipe, extra thick, by the way, > more so than just the normal pipe that we lay. Also, on each side of the > lake, there's automated valves that, if in the very, very unlikely situation > there were to be a leak, our control room shuts down the pipe, encapsulates > that small section that could be in peril. So, that's just not going to > happen. Number one, we're not going to have a leak. I can't promise that, of > course, but that ‚Äî no one would get on airplanes if they thought they were > going to crash. And, number two, there is no way there would be any crude > contaminate their water supply. They're 70 miles (110 km) downstream. On December 4, the Army announced that it would not grant an easement for the pipeline to be drilled under Lake Oahe. The announcement was made by the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works), Jo-Ellen Darcy: > Although we have had continuing discussion and exchanges of new information > with the Standing Rock Sioux and Dakota Access, it's clear that there's more > work to do. The best way to complete that work responsibly and expeditiously > is to explore alternate routes for the pipeline crossing. Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics Partners issued a same-day response: > The White House's directive today to the Corps for further delay is just the > latest in a series of overt and transparent political actions by an > administration which has abandoned the rule of law in favor of currying > favor with a narrow and extreme political constituency. As stated all along, > ETP and SXL fully expect to complete construction of the pipeline without > any additional rerouting in and around Lake Oahe. Nothing this > Administration has done today changes that in any way. = Dakota Access, LLC permitted to continue construction = On January 24, 2017, newly elected President Donald Trump signed an executive order allowing the pipeline's construction to proceed. On February 8, 2017, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) granted Dakota Access, LLC an easement based on the Mineral Leasing Act to cross Lake Oahe and finish construction of the pipeline. On February 9, 2017, the Court dismissed the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe's motion for a restraining order citing Religious Freedom Restoration Act violations, claiming an oil spill would disrupt their ability to worship freely. On February 14, 2017, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe filed a motion for summary judgment. The motion asked the Court to rule on unresolved legal questions concerning USACE, including the meeting of National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requirements and the violation of Tribal treaty rights. The motion addressed three claims: 1) the lawful requirement of a full, transparent and public environmental review for any federal action that has \\"significant\\" environmental effects, 2) Tribal treaty rights that guarantee the integrity of their reservation, and 3) the reversal of decisions from the previous administration. Federal Court finds the environmental study inadequate On June 14, 2017, Federal Judge James Boasberg ruled that the permits authorizing the pipeline to cross the Missouri River ultimately violated NEPA. In a ninety-one page decision, Judge Boasberg wrote, \\"the Court agrees that [the Corps] did not adequately consider the impacts of an oil spill on fishing rights, hunting rights, or environmental justice, or the degree to which the pipeline's effects are likely to be highly controversial\\". USACE failed to comply with NEPA because their Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) did not address the following: (1) likelihood that the project would be controversial, (2) the consequence of an oil spill on fishing and hunting rights, and (3) the environmental justice impact of the project. The court halted construction on the pipeline until USACE could adequately address these concerns. The Court's finding did not include a decision on continuing pipeline operation, but did request an additional briefing on the subject. Judge Boasberg asked the parties to submit legal briefs on the question of whether the Court should shut down the pipeline pending the completion of a lawful environmental review. On August 7, 2017, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe filed a legal brief arguing in favor of pipeline shutdown during the environmental review process. The Tribes received support from law professors and practitioners, tribes and tribal organizations, and other amicus parties. The Court granted the Tribes' motion for summary judgment for three reasons. First, the Court held that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers failed to address expert critiques of Dakota Access, LLC's oil spill risk analysis. Second, the Court found fault in USACE's disregard of impacts an oil spill would have on the Tribes' Treaty rights to fish and hunt. Finally, the Court found that USACE conducted a skewed assessment that reached the conclusion that the selected site raised no environmental justice concerns. Under the Court's order, USACE will reassess these questions and come to a new decision on if a full environmental impact statement is required. On October 11, 2017, the Court ruled that DAPL could continue to operate while USACE reassessed the environmental impact of the pipeline. While the Court did not find that shutting down the pipeline would cause a major economic disruption as claimed by DAPL, they refused to shut the pipeline down during the impact study due to the possibility that USACE would be able to justify its decision to not do a full environmental review. USACE predicts that the review will be finished by April 2018. Following the Court's finding a statement was issued by Earthjustice Attorney Jan Hasselman, who is representing the Tribe. > Today's decision is a disappointing continuation of a historic pattern: > other people get all the profits, and the Tribes get all the risk and harm. > The court already found that the Corps violated the law when it issued the > permits without thoroughly considering the impact on the people of Standing > Rock. The company should not be allowed to continue operating while the > Corps studies that threat., Safety measures imposed Following a 200,000 gallon Keystone pipeline oil spill in November 2017, Judge Boasberg imposed several interim measures over the ongoing operation of the Dakota Access pipeline. The Court ordered three measures, which had been requested by the Tribe. According to a report published by Earthjustice, a non-profit public interest law organization dedicated to environmental issues: > The Court ordered the Corps and DAPL to work with the Tribes to complete oil > spill response plans at Lake Oahe. Up to now, the Tribe has been kept in the > dark about spill response planning and was not involved in the process of > developing plans to address spills at Lake Oahe. Second, the Court ordered > an independent audit of DAPL's compliance with the permit conditions and > standards. The Tribe has to be involved in the selection of an auditor. > Finally, DAPL must file regular reports on any incidents or repairs on the > pipeline. Such reporting is not currently required by law, which means the > public does not learn about the nearly constant spills and leaks of oil that > occur on major pipelines. The conditions were all opposed by the Corps and by DAPL. =2020 legal proceedings= The tribe sued and in March 2020 a federal judge sided with them and ordered USACE to do a full environmental impact statement. In a 42-page decision Judge James Boasberg said the environmental analysis by both the companies behind the pipeline and the Corps was severely lacking. ‚ÄúIn projects of this scope, it is not difficult for an opponent to find fault with many conclusions made by an operator and relied on by the agency, but here, there is considerably more than a few isolated comments raising insubstantial concerns. The many commenters in this case pointed to serious gaps in crucial parts of the Corps‚Äô analysis ‚Äî to name a few, that the pipeline‚Äôs leak- detection system was unlikely to work, that it was not designed to catch slow spills, that the operator‚Äôs serious history of incidents had not been taken into account, and that the worst-case scenario used by the Corps was potentially only a fraction of what a realistic figure would be.\\" The case will continue. In July 2020, saying federal officials failed to carry out a complete analysis of its environmental impacts, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg ruled that the pipeline must be shut down by August 5 and remain shutdown while the Army Corps of Engineers conducts a more extensive environmental review than the one done that allowed the pipeline to begin transporting oil three years previously. Pipeline owner Energy Transfer said they would appeal. On August 5, the Court of Appeals sided with Energy Transfer to allow the pipeline to stay open, saying the lower-court judge \\"did not make the findings necessary for injunctive relief.\\" However the appellate court did not grant Energy Transfer's motion to block the review, saying the company had \\"failed to make a strong showing of likely success.\\"  Prosecutions of protesters  = Federal = Federal prosecutors brought indictments against at least five indigenous activists from the protests. Dion Ortiz, James \\"Angry Bird\\" White, Michael \\"Little Feather\\" Giron, and Michael \\"Rattler\\" Markus were all convicted of one count of civil disorder. RedFawn Fallis was convicted of civil disorder and illegal possession of a gun by a convicted felon. White was sentenced to serve twenty-four months of probation. The other five protesters were incarcerated in federal prison, Ortiz for 16 months, Giron and Markus for 36 months, and Fallis for 57 months. = State = There were hundreds of arrests of indigenous protesters and their allies. This included journalists, such as Amy Goodman, political figures such as Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka, actress Shailene Woodley, and numerous members of the left-leaning media collective Unicorn Riot. According to the Water Protector Legal Collective over 800 state criminal cases were brought by North Dakota prosecutors. Of these nearly 400 resulted in dismissals of charges, 42 ended in not-guilty verdicts at trial, nearly 200 were subjected to pre-trial diversion, and just 26 cases ended in convictions after trials. There are still 42 open cases before the state court.  TigerSwan security firm  In December 2016, it was reported by Charlie May that Dakota Access LLC had hired the firm TigerSwan to provide security during the protest. In May 2017, internal TigerSwan documents leaked to The Intercept and other documents obtained through public records requests revealed a close collaboration between the pipeline company and local, state, and federal law enforcement as they carried out \\"military-style counterterrorism measures\\" to suppress the protesters. TigerSwan also collected information used to assist prosecutors in building cases against protesters, and used social media in an attempt to sway public support for the pipeline. One of the released documents called the pipeline opposition movement \\"an ideologically driven insurgency with a strong religious component\\" that operated along a \\"jihadist insurgency model\\". The Intercept reported that \\"Energy Transfer Partners has continued to retain TigerSwan long after most of the anti-pipeline campers left North Dakota, and the most recent TigerSwan reports emphasize the threat of growing activism around other pipeline projects across the country.\\" Presidential memorandum by Donald Trump Banner against the pipeline in a 2017 inauguration day protest in Minnesota In December 2016, while still directed by the Obama administration, the Army Corps of Engineers decided that further study to address tribal concerns was needed and launched a study on January 18, 2017. But on January 24, newly elected President Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum to advance the construction of the pipeline under \\"terms and conditions to be negotiated\\". The order would expedite the environmental review that Trump described as an \\"incredibly cumbersome, long, horrible permitting process.\\" Trump signing the Presidential memorandum to advance the construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. January 24, 2017 On February 7, 2017, Trump authorized the Army Corps of Engineers to proceed, ending its environmental impact assessment and the associated public comment period. The director of the Indigenous Environmental Network released a statement saying: \\"The granting of an easement, without any environmental review or tribal consultation, is not the end of this fight‚Äîit is the new beginning. Expect mass resistance far beyond what Trump has seen so far. ... Our tribal nations and Indigenous grassroots peoples on the front lines have had no input on this process.\\" Standing Rock chairman David Archambault II said, \\"We are not opposed to energy independence. We are opposed to reckless and politically motivated development projects, like DAPL, that ignore our treaty rights and risk our water. Creating a second Flint does not make America great again.\\" Appearing as a guest on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on February 12, actress and activist Shailene Woodley said that, rather than gather at the Dakota protest site, the best way to oppose the pipeline may be to boycott banks that fund it and to take part in local protests.

Standing Rock solidarity march in San Francisco, November 2016. Native Nations Rise march in Washington D.C., March 2017. Many Sioux Tribes passed resolutions in support of Standing Rock, including the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, Crow Creek Tribe, the Oglala Sioux Tribe, and the Rosebud Sioux Tribe. Oklahoma tribes also expressed support for the pipeline protest movement. In August, Principal Chief Bill John Baker of the Cherokee Nation said, \\"As Indian people, we have a right to protect our lands and protect our water rights. That's our responsibility to the next seven generations.\\" Senator Bernie Sanders said he \\"join[s] with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and the many tribal nations fighting this dangerous pipeline. Like the Keystone XL pipeline, which I opposed since day one, the Dakota Access fracked oil pipeline, will transport some of the dirtiest fuel on the planet. Regardless of the court's decision, the Dakota Access pipeline must be stopped. As a nation, our job is to break our addiction to fossil fuels, not increase our dependence on oil.\\"Bernie Sanders releases a statement opposing Dakota Access Pipeline. KSFY, August 25, 2016. Field reporter Jordan Chariton (of The Young Turks' on-the-road program TYT Politics) was one of the most active journalists participating in the protests. He commented on the scant presence of journalists from mainstream networks such as CNN and MSNBC. =Online Presence= Along with the hashtag #NoDAPL, many other hashtags sprang up on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram to protest the pipeline. The hashtags included #ReZpectOurWater, which is a play on \\"reservations\\", #StandWithStandingRock, and #WaterisLife. Activist Naomi Klein posted a Facebook video in which she interviewed a youth, Iron Eyes, which gained more than a million views in 24 hours. In December 2016, Klein, writing an editorial in The Nation shortly after the Army Corps of Engineers had turned down the permit for the Dakota Access Pipeline to be built under the Missouri River, said, \\"The Lesson from Standing Rock: Organizing and Resistance Can Win.\\" As a long standing climate change activist, Klein said that past resistance has brought about change incrementally and only after a delay following mass actions. However, she wrote, Standing Rock had been \\"different.\\" > Standing Rock is different. This time the movement was still out on the land > in massive numbers when the news came down. The line between resistance and > results is bright and undeniable. That kind of victory is rare precisely > because it's contagious, because it shows people everywhere that organizing > and resistance are not futile. And as Donald Trump moves closer and closer > to the White House, that message is very important indeed. However, calling the Army Corps of Engineers request for further study an \\"incredibly cumbersome, long, horrible permitting process,\\" on January 24, newly elected President Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum to advance the construction of the pipeline. = Solidarity march in Denver = On September 8, about 500 Native Americans and other protesters marched in Denver to show solidarity with the Standing Rock Americans. State Representative Joe Salazar spoke about the safety of pipelines and described a recent Colorado Oil and Gas Association statement on oil pipeline safety as \\"full of lies.\\" = Solidarity march in Seattle = On September 16, a rally and march was held in Seattle to show solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. The mayor of Seattle and city council members joined leaders from Northwest tribes from Quinualt, Makah, Lummi, Suquamish, Tulalip, Swinomish, Puyallup and others to show opposition to the pipeline. Fawn Sharp, president of the Quinault Indian Nation and the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians, said that while the tribes are \\"determined to win this fight\\", a \\"deeper fix\\" is needed. \\"The U.S. must recognize that we have political equality. This is much larger than a specific infrastructure project. It goes to the fundamental relationship.\\" = Cities declaring opposition to the pipeline = According to the Grand Forks Herald, on October 13 the governments of 19 cities, including St. Louis and Minneapolis, had passed ordinances to support the Standing Rock tribe in opposition of the pipeline. In October, the Morton County Sheriff requested police from surrounding areas to assist in regulating the protests near the pipeline. The Dane County Sheriff's office of Wisconsin sent 10 deputies to aid the local police, but they were recalled a few days later because of opposition from the Dane County residents and county officials. = Plea to President Obama to adhere to treaties = In an October 28 public statement, Chief Arvol Looking Horse, spiritual leader and Keeper of the Sacred Pipe Bundle of the Lakota/Dakota/Nakota Nations, invoked his role as the voice of traditional government of the Great Sioux Nation and called upon President Barack Obama to communicate \\"nation to nation, as indicated by our treaties.\\" Looking Horse called upon President Obama to keep his word: > When you met with our people on your campaign trail in Sioux Falls, South > Dakota, you stated that you are a lawyer and understand treaty documents. > You told us that you realized our treaties were violated and you would > address these violations against our people if you became President. This > was your Word. =\\"National Day of Action\\"= On November 15, hundreds of cities held protests against the pipeline in a coordinated protest which organizers called a \\"National Day of Action.\\" Hundreds of protesters gathered peacefully in Chicago, Los Angeles, Manhattan, Denver, and other cities; dozens of protesters were arrested, including demonstrators in Mandan, North Dakota, where protesters were arrested after blocking a railroad. Tara Houska, Director for Honor the Earth, spoke at a rally in New York City saying, \\"Because of the power of social media and the millions of those at Standing Rock, the Army Corps are going to invite the tribe in to discuss their concerns.\\" Senator Bernie Sanders spoke at a protest in front of the White House. Robert Kennedy Jr. visited the protest camp and spoke to the protesters. He commented on the PBS Newshour: \\"I think they have a lot of courage. I think they're standing up for America, that they're standing up in the face of a bully.\\" = Thanksgiving Day protests = Thanksgiving Day has been described as a reminder of the strained relationship between the U.S. government and native people. On the November 24 holiday, several thousand continued to protest the pipeline; some estimated that the number of protesters, which fluctuates, doubled that day. Hundreds of people joined the protest that day, including groups from California, Oregon, Wisconsin, Colorado, South Carolina, and Washington. Protesters built a floating bridge to Turtle Island, considered sacred ground, and 400 gathered near the bridge, some crossing over to perform a prayer ceremony. The influx of many new people over Thanksgiving weekend caused new problems, according to some activists. Some criticized a group of young, mostly white, people at the protest for treating it like a festival such as Burning Man by bringing drugs and alcohol, requiring supplies and provisions rather than sustaining themselves, or performing unsolicited live music. Actress Jane Fonda was one of a delegation of 50 people who served a Thanksgiving dinner in nearby Mandan, capturing media attention. Business owners traveled from as far as Massachusetts and Pennsylvania to serve food to protesters at Standing Rock. A Thanksgiving Day protest in Portland, Oregon drew about 350 in heavy rain. =Support from military veterans= In November, a group called Veterans Stand for Standing Rock formed to participate in nonviolent intervention to defend the demonstrators from what the group has called \\"assault and intimidation at the hands of the militarized police force.\\" According to The New York Times, \\"as many as 2,000 veterans\\" indicated that they would gather at the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation to serve as \\"human shields\\" for protesters. The organizers of these protests included a retired Baltimore police sergeant and Wes Clark, Jr., the son of former Supreme NATO Commander and 2004 presidential candidate Wesley Clark. Wes Clark, Jr is affiliated with The Young Turks. Following the executive order made by President Trump in January 2017 which overturned the decision of former President Obama to halt the construction of the pipeline and the February order in which he authorized the Army Corps of Engineers to proceed, US veterans returned to Standing Rock to a form human shield to protect Dakota Access pipeline protesters. Air force veteran Elizabeth Williams said, \\"We are prepared to put our bodies between Native elders and a privatized military force. We've stood in the face of fire before. We feel a responsibility to use the skills we have.\\" =Corporate support= In February 2017, Seattle, Washington's city council unanimously voted to not renew its contract with Wells Fargo in a move that cites the bank's role as a lender to the Dakota Access Pipeline project as well as its \\"creation of millions of bogus accounts\\" and said the bidding process for its next banking partner would involve \\"social responsibility.\\" The City Council in Davis, California, took a similar action, voting unanimously to find a new bank to handle its accounts by the end of 2017.2 Cities To Pull More Than $3 Billion From Wells Fargo Over Dakota Access Pipeline =Native Nations Rise march in Washington D.C.= Native Nations March in Washington, DC. 2017 In March 2017, the Standing Rock Sioux tribe led a four-day protest in Washington D.C., culminating in the Native Nations Rise march on March 10. The protesters marched through the capital, pausing to erect a tipi at Trump International Hotel, and rallied in front of the White House. Reactions In September 2016, Senator Bernie Sanders spoke to a crowd of about 3,000 members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and other tribal nations and supporters at a protest held outside of the White House. Saying \\"the pipeline threatens the environment and water resources and exploits Native Americans\\", he asked President Obama to take action and conduct a full environmental and cultural impact analysis of the project, which he believed would kill the pipeline. Following the use of the National Guard and police in riot gear to remove protesters from a protest camp in October, Sanders again called on the president to suspend construction of the pipeline. In a letter to the President, Sanders said in part: \\"It is deeply distressing to me that the federal government is putting the profits of the oil industry ahead of the treaty and sovereign rights of Native American communities. Mr. President, you took a bold and principled stand against the Keystone Pipeline ‚Äì I ask you to take a similar stand against the Dakota Access Pipeline.\\" Saying that the Dakota Access pipeline project is part of a \\"long history of pushing the impacts of pollution onto the most economically and politically disadvantaged people and communities across this country\\", Representative Ra√∫l Grijalva, the ranking Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, on September 22 asked the Army Corps of Engineers to withdraw the existing permits for the pipeline. Saying \\"the project's current permits should be suspended and all construction stopped until a complete environmental and cultural review has been completed for the entire project\\", Senators Sanders, Dianne Feinstein, Ed Markey, Patrick Leahy and Benjamin Cardin on October 13 called on President Barack Obama to order a comprehensive environmental review of the pipeline project. They also requested stronger tribal consultation for the contested part of the route. Calling the proposed pipeline route \\"the ripest case of environmental racism I have seen in a long time\\", on October 26 the Reverend Jesse Jackson announced support for the movement, saying, \\"The tribes of this country have sacrificed a lot so this great country could be built. With promises broken, land stolen and sacred lands desecrated, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is standing up for their right to clean water. They have lost land for settlers to farm, more land for gold in the Black Hills, and then again, even more, land for the dam that was built for hydropower. When will the taking stop?\\" In September, Obama spoke to tribal representatives, saying, \\"I know that many of you have come together across tribes and across the country to support the community at Standing Rock. And together, you're making your voices heard.\\" He again discussed the protest movement on November 2, saying: > We're monitoring this closely. My view is that there is a way for us to > accommodate sacred lands of Native Americans. And I think that right now the > Army Corps is examining whether there are ways to reroute this pipeline. > We're going to let it play out for several more weeks and determine whether > or not this can be resolved in a way that I think is properly attentive to > the traditions of First Americans. Several members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives weighed in on the protest on November 29, 2016. Senators Al Franken of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey called upon U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch to investigate the tactics of law enforcement officers against peaceful protesters, and to send monitors to track any violence against protesters. Several members of the House made statements as well, and Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii announced plans to join hundreds of other military veterans in protecting the protesters in early December. Native American lacrosse players Lyle Thompson and his brothers Miles, Jeremy and Hiana and others including Bill O'Brien and Scott Marr, used social media to support the protesters. They visited the camp as well, bringing lacrosse sticks and organizing games, giving instructions to those who had never before played the game. Following President Trump's January 2017 reversal of the Court decisions made under the Obama administration, the players said that they planned to continue with their support. Following her unexpected win in the 2018 New York Democratic primary race, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez credited the time she spent at the protest camp as the reason for her decision run for political office. In an interview she recalled her visit to Standing Rock as a tipping point, saying that she had previously felt that the only way to effectively run for office was if you had access to wealth, social influence, and power. But her visit to North Dakota, where she saw others \\"putting their whole lives and everything that they had on the line for the protection of their community,\\" inspired her to begin to work within her own community.  United Nations presentation  On September 20, 2016, Standing Rock Chairman David Archambault II addressed the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland, where he called \\"upon all parties to stop the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline.\\" Citing the 1851 Treaty of Traverse des Sioux and 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie, two treaties ratified by the U.S. Senate that recognize the Sioux's national sovereignty, Archambault told the Council that \\"the oil companies and the government of the United States have failed to respect our sovereign rights.\\" On September 22, 2016, Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, a United Nations expert on the rights of indigenous peoples, admonished the U.S., saying, \\"The tribe was denied access to information and excluded from consultations at the planning stage of the project, and environmental assessments failed to disclose the presence and proximity of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation.\\" She also responded to the rights of pipeline protesters, saying, \\"The U.S. authorities should fully protect and facilitate the right to freedom of peaceful assembly of indigenous peoples, which plays a key role in empowering their ability to claim other rights.\\"  See also  * Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples *Line 3 Pipeline * Hindmarsh Island bridge controversy - a similar dispute in Australia in the 1990s involving a clash between indigenous rights and property rights * Indigenous Environmental Network * Indigenous land rights * Indigenous rights *Keystone Pipeline * List of oil spills * List of pipeline accidents in the United States in the 21st century * List of United States treaties ¬ß U.S.‚ÄìNative American treaties * List of natural gas pipelines in North America * List of oil pipelines in North America * List of oil refineries in North America *List of incidents of civil unrest in the United States *#NODAPL * Pipeline transport * Treaty of Fort Laramie (1851) * Treaty rights  References   External links  * Camp of the Sacred Stones - First Water Protectors camp formed at Standing Rock *Water Protector Legal Collective - Non-profit legal organization formed to defend Water Protectors * ReZpect Our Water - Standing Rock Youth and Water Runners * NoDAPL Twitter feed * NoDAPL Archive * Memorandum Opinion of \\"Standing Rock Sioux Tribe vs U.S. Army Corps of Engineers\\" - September 2016 - U.S. District Court * DAPL Pipeline Facts - Oil Industry information about the pipeline 2016 protests 2017 protests Articles containing video clips Environmental justice Environmental controversies Environmental protests in the United States Indigenous peoples and the environment Indigenous politics in North America Indigenous rights Minority rights Native American nationalism Nonviolent occupation Indigenous Political advocacy groups in the United States Protest tactics Missouri River Mississippi River Water law in the United States Water organizations in the United States 2016 in North Dakota 2017 in North Dakota Police brutality in the United States ","title":"Dakota Access Pipeline protests"},{"id":"51439309","text":"Lumla is the headqarter of eponymous subdivision, tehsil and Legislative Assembly of Arunachal Pradesh in the Tawang district of Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh.Tawang dist details> The current MLA (August-2016) of this constituency is Jambey Tashi.

It is based on the 1941 novella Up at the Villa by W. Somerset Maugham. Plot A recently widowed Englishwoman, Mary Panton (Kristin Scott Thomas), is staying at the villa of some wealthy friends outside of Florence, Italy in 1938. After meeting her old friend Sir Edgar Swift (James Fox) at a party celebrating the Munich Agreement, she is surprised when he proposes marriage to her the next day. She asks for a few days to think the proposal over, and he agrees to meet with her on his return from Rome. That evening, at a party hosted by her friend, the Princess San Ferdinando (Anne Bancroft), she meets a married American man named Rowley Flint (Sean Penn), who has a reputation for being a rogue. A violinist (Jeremy Davies) arrives to entertain the guests but is so terrible that the Princess has him removed. Out of sympathy Mary leaves him a large tip. Rowley drives Mary home, but on the way stops at a small church, where she confesses that her husband was an abusive alcoholic who died in a car crash, leaving her destitute. Rowley tries to kiss her but Mary slaps him and drives away. She is so flustered that she almost collides with a young man in the road, who turns out to be the violinist from the restaurant. Seeing that he is poor and hungry, she invites him up to the house for a meal. He tells her that his name is Karl Richter and that he is a refugee from Austria, where he was persecuted for resisting the Nazi government. When the young man declares how beautiful Mary is, she has sex with him out of sympathy. He leaves the next morning. That same day Mary is summoned to a meeting between the English expatriates and the city authorities, where the local Fascist administrator, Beppino Leopardi (Massimo Ghini), informs them that they will have to register with the police to continue living in Italy. Later that night, she is shocked when Karl appears in her bedroom, declaring that he loves her and wants to be with her. When she explains that she only slept with him out of \\"pity\\", he is enraged and attacks her. She grabs a gun given to her by Sir Edgar Swift, but Karl swipes the gun and aims it at her. At the last second, however, he shoots himself. In a blind panic and aware of the serious scandal that could result, Mary calls Rowley and pleads with him to assist her. He arrives and the two transfer the body to the woods down the road, where Rowley plants an unregistered gun of his so that the suicide cannot be traced back to Mary. He keeps Sir Edgar Swift's gun on him. The next day the two appear to have escaped being connected with the suicide, until Leopardi arrives at Mary's. He announces that the Florence police have arrested Rowley for possessing a handgun belonging to Sir Edgar Swift which was not registered when he entered Italy. Aware that Rowley could be imprisoned and Edgar implicated, Mary seeks out the Princess. She gets the Princess drunk and coaxes her into admitting that she had once blackmailed Leopardi by sending him financial documents showing him to have embezzled money. Mary heads straight for the Princess' home, where she manages to steal the documents on the pretense of delivering flowers. Mary goes to Leopardi's office and blackmails him with the documents to release Rowley. He is enraged but eventually submits to her demands so that she is able to take a wounded Rowley home. Although she admits to having feelings for Rowley, the two agree that he could not be faithful to her and they part. Later that evening Mary meets with Edgar, where she confesses everything that had occurred over the past few days. He is surprisingly understanding and says that he still wishes to marry her, but that he will have to give up the Viceroyship of India for fear of the story ever getting out and causing a scandal. Mary does not want to ruin his career, and ultimately admits that she does not love him and will not marry him. After he leaves Mary packs her bags to return to London. The Princess arrives at the villa, and tells Mary that she is a fool for rejecting the wealthy and powerful Swift because of her attraction to Rowley. At the terminal the next day, Mary boards the train alone and is surprised when Rowley joins her in the car.

Feirstein Graduate School of Cinema, more commonly referred to as the Feirstein Graduate School of Cinema, is a film school and one of the graduate schools of Brooklyn College, a senior college within the City University of New York. It is located on the Steiner Studios film lot in Brooklyn, New York. Feirstein is the first public graduate film school in New York City and is the only public graduate film school in the United States located on a working film lot. The school is named after Barry Feirstein, a donor and Brooklyn College alumnus. Development was officially announced in January 2011, and funding was provided by private donations and by investments from New York City and New York State. Though Feirstein initially aimed to open for the fall 2013 semester, the school accepted its inaugural class for the 2015-2016 academic year.  History  The Feirstein Graduate School of Cinema was developed between Brooklyn College of the City University of New York and Steiner Studios. Douglas Steiner and founding director Jonathan Wacks wished to promote diversification of the film industry. Development was first referenced by Michael Bloomberg in his January 2011 State of the City address and was officially announced the same month. The school initially aimed to open for the fall 2013 semester. New York City invested over $8 million into the development of the school. Funding was provided through the Mayor's Office of Media and Entertainment, the New York City Council, Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, the City University of New York, and the Made in NY program. New York State also invested $5 million. Brooklyn College alumnus Barry Feirstein donated $5 million to development, and the school is named in his honor. The school is the first public graduate film school in New York City. The school accepted its first cohort for the 2015-2016 academic year and was officially opened by Mayor Bill de Blasio in October 2015. = Awards = The Feirstein website, designed by Brooklyn United, won a 2015 Webby Award for best School/University website. Feirstein was awarded a 2016 Building Brooklyn Award for Education by the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce; the award is given to \\"recently completed construction and renovation projects that enrich Brooklyn‚Äôs neighborhoods and economy\\".  Building and facilities  Feirstein occupies two floors of Building 1 on the Steiner Studios film lot in Brooklyn, New York. It is the only public graduate school in the United States located on a working film lot. Steiner and Wacks felt that integration into a film lot better facilitated entry into professional filmmaking. The facilities designed by Dattner Architects include a foley studio, an ADR studio, a sound mixing studio, and a sound stage. The school's systems and post-production courses use Avid Technology's editing software. Oscar-winning director Steven Soderbergh is on the advisory council to the school and described it to Worth magazine as \\"by any standard one of the best facilities I have ever walked in to. I certainly never set foot in anything like that until I started working for studios.\\"https://www.worth.com/destinations-2017-new-york/  Academics and admissions  Feirstein has two degree programs, Master of Arts in Cinema Studies and Master of Fine Arts. The Master of Fine Arts degree program is further divided into multiple academic tracks. Upon the school's opening, these tracks were: cinematography, directing, post-production, producing, screenwriting. Digital animation and visual effects, media scoring, and sonic arts tracks were offered beginning in the 2016-2017 academic year. However, the media scoring and sonic arts programs are also part of Brooklyn College's conservatory of music. Applications are accepted on a rolling admission policy and are not accepted for the spring semester. Each Master of Fine Arts track accepts fourteen students, except for cinema studies and screenwriting. Feirstein began accepting applications in November 2014 and accepted 69 students for the fall 2015 semester. The inaugural class was about 50% women, 43-46% persons of color, and 70% students from New York.  Notable faculty and staff  Jonathan Wacks serves as academic director. Feirstein's advisory board includes Darren Aronofsky, Celia Costas, Ethan Hawke, Steven Soderbergh, and Fisher Stevens.

According to an 1868 inscription on a cross placed on the altar table and donated by Prince Carol I of Romania, the church had also belonged to the blanket-makers' guild. Andi Emanuel Mihalache, History at the Ia»ôi County Cultural Office site Three semi-legendary stories surround the foundation of the first church. One holds that it was established by a great boyar named Vulpe. Another says that a hunter pursued a rare fox (vulpe in Romanian) for a long time, promising he would build a church where he killed it, which he did. A third holds that the blanket-makers built the church, naming it after the material they used in their wares. There was formerly a cemetery in the churchyard, and two of its headstones, now gone, were still visible in the early 20th century. One was heart-shaped and mentioned the Union of the Principalities. Another was square, with a torch in each corner, and commemorated a woman who participated in the Moldavian Revolution of 1848.

Beeton was born on Gun Carriage Island, part of the Furneaux Group in the eastern Bass Strait, in what was then the colony of Van Diemen's Land. Her father was Thomas Beeton, who was descended from a London Jewish family and had been transported to Tasmania in 1817 after mutinying from the Royal Navy. After completing his sentence in 1824, he established himself as a sealer in Bass Strait. He subsequently purchased an Aboriginal woman, known as Bet Smith, to be his wife. Bet Smith, whose Palawa name was Emmerenna, had been abducted from Cape Portland as a child by John Harrington, a sealer, and had been \\"claimed\\" by Thomas Tucker, another sealer, after Harrington's death in 1824, who then sold her to Beeton.Nigel Prickett, \\"Trans-Tasman stories: Australian Aborigines in New Zealand sealing and shore whaling\\", in Geoffrey Clark, Foss Leach, and Sue O'Connor (eds.), Terra Australis, vol. 29, June 2008, ANU Press, pp. 360‚Äì361 In 1831, two years after Beeton was born, her father was forced to leave Gun Carriage Island so that George Augustus Robinson, the Protector of Aborigines, could establish an Aboriginal-only settlement. However, Thomas Beeton then requested that his family be allowed to live with him, which was approved by the colony's Lieutenant-Governor, George Arthur. In the meantime, Robinson's settlement had been moved to Flinders Island, allowing the Beeton family to live on Gun Carriage Island. As Lucy Beeton grew older, she was taught by her father how to sail and do business, and was later sent to George Town and Launceston (on the Tasmanian mainland) to be tutored.

Early life and career Rodgers was born on 13 October 1827 in Howard County, Missouri, to Ebenezer Rodgers and Purinelia Jackson Rodgers. Ebenezer was a native of Wales and emigrated to America in 1818. He settled in the Boonslick region of Missouri and worked as a teacher. In 1833 he moved to Upper Alton, Illinois, where he served as a preacher and helped get Shurtleff College off the ground and running. Purinelia was the daughter of Capt. John Jackson, a veteran of the War of 1812. Andrew Rodgers was educated at Shurtleff College. In 1844, at the age of seventeen, he clerked at a hardware store and pursued a business life until the outbreak of the Mexican-American War in 1846. In 1846, Rodgers volunteered to fight in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and joined Company E of the Second Illinois Regiment under the leadership of Col. William Henry Bissell. Their unit saw substantial action at the Battle of Buena Vista. Afterward Rodgers set out to California in 1849 along with thousands of others in the California Gold Rush. In 1851 he was appointed deputy sheriff of Sacramento by Benjamin McCulloch and then later served a second term while still mining. At the death of his father in 1853, Rodgers returned home to Illinois and farmed. American Civil War In 1862, Rodgers volunteered to fight in the American Civil War, joined the 80th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment, and was chosen its lieutenant colonel. As part of the 80th Illinois, Rodgers saw substantial action at the Battle of Perryville in the fall of 1862, where he was effectively the regimental commander due to Col. Thomas Allen's absence at the battle scene. With Allen's resignation in April 1863, Rodgers took command as colonel. The unit was an integral part of Streight's Raid in northern Alabama. Due largely to poor supplies and poor planning it ended with the defeat and capture of the men at Cedar Bluff, Alabama, by Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest. As a captured officer, Rodgers was sent to Libby Prison in Richmond, Virginia, and spent a year there where he was forced to endure its many horrors, including disease, tight confinement, and malnutrition. Later he was moved to Macon, Georgia, and then to Charleston along with about fifty other officers where he was used by the rebels as a hostage to prevent Union fire on the city. In July 1864 Rodgers was exchanged and returned home. Gen. William Rosecrans persuaded Rodgers to recruit and organize the 144th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Rodgers ultimately organized approximately 800 men in the 144th and Gov. Richard Yates offered Rodgers the colonelcy of the unit, but he turned down the offer and opted for discharge from the Army. Some sources suggest Rodgers was upset he was not offered command of his old unit, the 80th Illinois, but later in life Rodgers suggested he was simply tired and worn out from fighting and his time in prison. Life after the war After his discharge from the Army, Rodgers returned home to Illinois and focused on farming and his growing family, which eventually included two sons and two daughters. Rodgers was nominated as the Democratic Party's nominee for Madison County Clerk in 1865, but lost. In 1870 he was nominated as the Democratic candidate for the Illinois House of Representatives and won. In 1896 he was Mayor of Upper Alton, which has since been incorporated in the larger city of Alton. Rodgers died on 20 January 1922 at the age of ninety-four.

Background The peasants uprising was connected to the 1905 Revolution and the October Manifesto, as the country was gripped by a revolutionary and rebellious atmosphere following Tsar Nicholas II reactionary policies. After Bloody Sunday in February, large instances of rebellion exploded throughout the country, initiating the 1905 Revolution. The revolution forced the reactionary Tsar to make concessions, and in October he issued a manifesto granting some civil liberties to prevent the national from slipping into chaos, trying to 'pacify' the country. The 'Bolsheviks' The general 'mood of rebellion' riding the country quickly spread to the provinces and the countryside. Seeing the weakness of the government, they started organising rent strikes in an effort to force the landowners to pay out higher wages. They began trespassing on the land of the gentry, chopping down trees and harvesting their hay. When early summer came and it became clear that the harvest had failed, the peasants started launching large, organised attacks on the estates; they would loot the properties, and set the manor on fire, making the landowner flee.Figes, p. 182 The uprising was mainly caused by the peasants misunderstanding the October Manifesto as a license to seize the countryside from the gentry: despite some rural unrest in the spring of 1905, and more in the summer, the unrest only 'exploded' after October 17. Several witnesses noted how the night sky was illuminated by the amount of burning manors, and how long lines of peasant carts drawn by horses filled the roads, packed with stolen items. In the violence there was also a much 'culture smashing', and peasants went out to destroy anything that 'smacked of superfluous wealth': setting fire to libraries, smashing antiques and dumping faeces on the expensive oriental carpets all took place. Some also seized the expensive works of art, the fine china, and the luxurious clothes and divided it amongst themselves along with the captured farming equipment. There was also a reported case of a group of peasants breaking apart a grand piano, sharing out the ivory keys. Most violence occurred in the so-called 'Central Agricultural Zone', location of the largest estates and the poorest peasants. Much violence also occurred in the Baltic region, with the least violence happening in the West and South. Those most prone to become involved were young villagers and soldiers returning from the Far East. The largest destruction took place in Saratov Governorate, where more destruction of manors took place than anywhere else in the country. Once landowners had been driven out, the peasants returned to their communes, refusing to pay tax or obey government law, as well as driving out local officials and conservative priests. Despite the large destruction there were only one confirmed account of a landowner being killed, although reports report that 50 non-communal peasants who were particularly disliked were murdered. The main aim of the uprisings were however only to deprive the squires and non-peasant landowners of the opportunity to make money of the countryside, and a saying was that the peasants were just 'smoking them out'. One observer noted how the violence were almost purely directed towards the property and not the owners, saying that 'the peasants had no use whatever for landlords, but needed the land'.Pipes, p. 48 During this 'Great Fear of 1905', many landowners seemed open to accept expropriation and concessions to save themselves. Trepov had once even said to Sergey Witte: 'I myself am a landowner and I would be glad to relinquish half of my land if I were convinced that under these conditions I could keep the remainder.' However, as the revolutionary mood died down, the landowners became less willing to compromise.Figes, p. 220 The army was called to put down the disorder, but the vast majority of the Imperial Russian Army's private soldiers were peasants, and the soldiers' morale was severely impacted by news received from their own villages. As the army was called out to put down the peasant uprisings' of 1905-06, many units ‚Äî especially in the infantry, which consisted mainly of peasants ‚Äî refused to obey orders and mutinied in favor of the Revolution; between autumn 1905 and winter 1906 over 400 mutinies took place, causing the army to be brought to the brink of collapse, with it taking several years to restore something close to order.Figes, p. 57 Aftermath and reaction Almost 3000 manors were destroyed by the 'Jaquerie of 1905-06', 15 percent of the country total. In some areas, the revolt was accompanied by pogroms against Jews. What followed the uprisings was a wave of 'gentry reaction'. Organisations like the United Nobility was formed to protect the gentry's properties, and the provincial zemstvos changed nature from being 'liberal strongholds' to 'bastions of law and order'. With the most destruction finding place in Saratov, Stolypin's daughter wrote of how 'the steppe lit up at night by the burning manor houses' and how the long lines of peasants and carts moving across the red horizon looked like 'a peasant army coming home from its wars'. It played an important role in convincing Governor of Saratov, Stolypin, that a land reform was necessary.Figes, p. 223 References Bibliography 1905 Russian Revolution Russian Empire ","title":"Russian Peasants' uprising of 1905‚Äì6"},{"id":"51439802","text":"The Benajah Gray Log House is a historic loghouse in Antioch, Tennessee, U.S..

The seat had been significantly redistributed before the election, losing all of its area near Palmerston and all but erasing the Country Liberal majority. Amid the CLP's collapse in Darwin at that election, Collins won the seat for Labor on a swing of over eight percent.

Its original appearance has not been preserved, and the present church owes its form to repairs carried out in 1761. At that point, the foyer was added (initially open, later closed) with the bell tower above it. Consular reports indicate that Janissaries burned the church in 1822.

Early life and career Worden moved to Australia with her family in 1981, attending school in Adelaide. She moved to Ngukkurr in the Northern Territory in 1985. Worden was an Alderman on the City of Darwin Council for three years. She was the Chair of the Community and Cultural, and Arts and Cultural Development Committees. She has been critical of Lord Mayor Katrina Fong Lim. Before entering politics, Worden worked at the Northern Territory Department of Housing overseeing complaints and compliance. Worden has been married twice. She has four children and five grandchildren. Politics Worden challenged Deputy Chief Minister Peter Styles in his seat of Sanderson. She won in a rout, taking over 60 percent of the vote on a swing of over 13 percent amid the CLP's near-meltdown in Darwin, enough to turn Sanderson into a safe Labor seat at one stroke. She actually won enough votes on the first count to take the seat without the need for preferences. Worden consolidated her hold on the seat in 2020, picking up a swing of over eight percent. She now sits on a majority of 19.5 percent, making Sanderson the second-safest seat in the Territory.

They were one of the most popular groups in the Albuquerque area and enjoyed local hits from both sides of their 1966 single \\"How Can I\\" b/w \\"Impressin'\\". Their work has come to the attention of garage rock enthusiasts with the release of the 1996 anthology Impressin', which features their complete recordings. History The Kreeg formed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 1966, out of another earlier band known first as the Goldenaires then the Prophets. Their lineup consisted of Bob Sturtcman, who had previously played with another local band, the Goldenaires, on rhythm guitar and vocals, Hap Blackstock on bass and vocals, Larry Inks (lead guitar), and Russ Sturtcman on drums. Hap Blackstock was eventually replaced by Ray Trujillo on bass. When the Prophets decided to change their name, rhythm guitarist Bob Sturtcman came up with idea to call the band \\"the Blitzkrieg\\", but the group decided to shorten it, first to \\"the Krieg\\", then finally the Kreeg, mainly out concern for the numerous World War II veterans living in Albuquerque. Going back to the Prophets, the band was heavily influenced by the Beatles, but eventually started listening to some of the harder, more blues-based British bands such as the Rolling Stones, Them, the Yardbirds, the Kinks, and the Animals, as well as American folk rock and garage-oriented bands such as the Beau Brummels and the Leaves. The Kreeg developed a sound that combined blues and folk rock influences. Bob Sturtcman wrote several songs, and the group recorded a few demos. The Kreeg were the first band signed to Dick Stewart's Albuquerque-based Lance Records, and their debut single, \\"How Can I\\" b/w \\"Impressin'\\", released in November 1966, supplied two minor local hits and sold well enough to convince Lance to sign more local rock bands, and eventually they became the home to many of the area's top groups. The Kreeg were popular in the Albuquerque area, making a steady living playing fraternity parties and high school homecoming dances. According to Bob Sturtcman: \\"...from local airplay, we garnered a lot of clout for bookings, which kept us busy every weekend\\". When lead guitarist Larry Inks decided to move to California the group began to disintegrate, and with Vietnam War draft looming, by the end of 1968 the Kreeg were no more. Bob Sturtcman later became an architect and lives in Ranchos de Taos, New Mexico. Russ Sturtcman died in 2014. In the aftermath of the Kreeg, Bob and Russ Sturtcman played together in Mother Sturtcman's Jam and Jellies up through 1969, and that year released a single‚Äîa version of the Yardbirds' \\"For Your Love.\\" They subsequently played in a band called Albatross, based in Taos, New Mexico, during the early 1970s. In the 1990s, the CD anthology, Impressin', featuring the Kreeg's complete recordings, including official releases, demos, and live tracks, was assembled by Bob Sturtcman and Dick Stewart and released on Collectables Records in 1996. The anthology has been noted for its informative liner notes and discography. \\"How Can I\\" and \\"Impressin'\\" were included on the Sixties Archives #4: Florida & New Mexico Punk on Eva Records in 1991. The song \\"Impressin'\\" was featured on Garage Beat '66 Volume 1: Like What, Me Worry?! released in 2004 by Sundazed Records.

He is a Labor Party member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly since 2016, representing the electorate of Namatjira until 2020 and Electoral division of Gwoja thereafter. He is of Aranda and Gurindji descent. Early years and career Paech grew up in Alice Springs. He is the son of an Eastern Arrernte woman, his father is a descendant of German immigrants. He was elected to the Alice Springs Town Council in 2012. Paech completed his secondary education at Anzac Hill High, Alice Springs, Northern Territory. He later studied at Charles Darwin University in the field of land management, conservation and horticulture production. Paech has been a sound advocate for infrastructure investments, economic development opportunities and employment pathways that retain our people in the regional, remote and rural areas. Paech has a long-standing relationships with the Aboriginal community controlled sector in the Central Australian community. He is the great-grandson of legendary bushman Walter Smith. Paech is the only openly gay male MP in the NT Legislative Assembly; before entering politics, he was a prominent LGBT rights activist. Politics Paech was preselected as the Labor candidate for Namatjira for the 2016 Territory election. The seat's incumbent since 2005 (dating to when the seat was known as MacDonnell), independent Alison Anderson, was retiring after three terms. On paper, Paech faced daunting odds. The seat had a notional Country Liberal Party majority of 20.8 percent, and a redistribution had seemingly consolidated the CLP's hold on the seat by pushing it into Alice Springs. However, Anderson, who had served under four banners during her tenure (Labor, CLP, independent, Palmer United and independent again) endorsed Paech as her successor; she is a longtime indigenous activist, and retained substantial goodwill in the area. The ABC's Antony Green believed that Anderson's endorsement made Namatjira \\"a certain Labor gain.\\"Green, Antony. NT election preview. ABC News, 2016-08-08. Paech won the seat resoundingly, taking 59 percent of the two-party vote on a swing of over 29 percent, the second-largest swing of the election‚Äîenough to revert Namatjira to its traditional status as a safe Labor seat. He was subsequently made Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees. Paech is the first openly gay indigenous MP in Australia. He gave his maiden parliamentary speech on 19 October 2016, in which he said he entered the chamber \\"eternally proud of who I am and where I come from ... I am young, I am gay, I am black; a true-blue Territorian. I am a proud face of the diversity and future of the great Australian Labor party.\\" He added: \\"I look forward to the day when this country will recognise my rights as equal rights, when I too can marry in my country, on my country, as a recognised first Australian.\\" In June 2020, Paech was elected Speaker of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, replacing Kezia Purick who resigned after findings of corrupt conduct against her by the Northern Territory Independent Commissioner Against Corruption. He won the new seat of Gwoja at the 2020 Territory election.

It's easy to hear Wilson at the peak of his very formidable powers, and this recording is highly recommended for those who enjoy the modern mainstream big- band sound of now\\".

It was released in September 2015 for Windows and Mac OS X through the download service Steam, as well as for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The game received mixed reviews from critics, complimenting its graphics, sound, and experimental nature, but criticizing its brevity.  Gameplay  The first segment of a stage. The player controls two laser beams using the twin sticks of the controller, or by using their hands with an Intel RealSense camera. The player must then enter a stage and go through several phases where different actions are required. First, the player collects \\"memory molecules\\" by pressing one or both of the lasers at the correct time and position along with the beat. Second, they must \\"harmonize\\" the memory, which involves hitting targets that come towards the player using precise positioning. Third, they warp out of the stage, and must avoid barriers called \\"mental blocks\\". Finally, they must use a QTE to \\"materialize\\" the memory. The player's score is multiplied depending on how much of a combo they maintain, up to a combo of 40 targets hit or avoided in a row. The score is then uploaded to an online leaderboard.  Plot  The game revolves around a long-dead astronaut who is discovered by an advanced alien race. In order to learn what he was, the aliens use advanced technology to reconstruct his memories. They view the memories of his life, relationships, and career, which culminate in errant meteoroids impacting his spaceship, with his final memory being drifting through the Solar System. After viewing all his memories, they finally realize the true nature of humanity, and leave him to drift in space yet again. It is heavily implied that the astronaut was a member of the crew of the ship Iktomi in a subsequent game released by the studio, Tharsis, and the game developers have acknowledged that both games share the same fictional universe.  Development  The game's soundtrack was composed by Chris Osborn.  Reception  Laserlife received mixed reviews, with an aggregate score of 65/100 on Metacritic for the PlayStation 4 version. Heidi Kemps of VentureBeat rated it 85/100, calling the game \\"short but engaging\\" and praising the imagery, controls, gameplay, and music, but criticizing the \\"'busy' visual design\\" and \\"framerate drops\\" as well as the short length. Jaz Rignall of USGamer rated it 70/100, saying that it is \\"psychedelic\\" with \\"killer tunes\\", but also criticizing the length and eclectic nature of the game. Sparky Clarkson of GameCritics rated it 40/100, saying that the game's controls caused him \\"physical pain\\", the soundtrack was \\"boring\\" due to its repetitiveness, and that the score was \\"essentially meaningless\\".
