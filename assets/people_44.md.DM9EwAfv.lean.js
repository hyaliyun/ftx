It has also been known at different times as Mount Pleasant Brook and Spring Valley Creek. At its full former reach, the source of Mud Creek began near Downsview Airport and flow approximately 11.5km southeast to its mouth at the Don River. Now considered one of Toronto's lost rivers, much of the creek is now buried, with the sole surface portions visible consisting of a 2.1km stretch starting from Moore Park Ravine at the Moore Park neighbourhood to the Don River. However, with positive results of recent conservation efforts, it is also brought forward as a success story for good ravine management.  Former reach  The former path of Mud Creek can still be seen in the geography from the Downsview neighbourhood, to Mount Pleasant Cemetery, and into the depression at the beginning of Moore Park Ravine. However, almost all of the former reach of Mud Creek was buried. The source was believed to be near Downsview Airport where it flowed towards the intersection of Champlain Boulevard and Highway 401, From there it crossed into the present-day location of the Baycrest Medical Center parking lot and flowed south to around Ranee Avenue and Ridgevale Drive and then through a greenbelt that is now Woburn Park. Crossing Lawrence Avenue, it flowed into the present day Caribou Park and then followed the southeast curve of Coldstream Avenue, where flow from the local catchment is briefly visible in the Kimbark-Coldstream Ravine until it enters the sewers and is diverted east. From the ravine, the former Mud Creek travelled south east, crossing Avenue Road into Lytton Park and then flowed south following the path of Rosewell Avenue into Eglinton Park. The creek exited the southeast corner of the Eglinton Park near Edith street, where the former presence of Mud Creek is still felt by local residents from the high soil water-table. From the park, it then travelled southeast crossing Yonge Street at Hillsdale Avenue. From there, Mud Creek flowed through what is now paved over as Tulis Drive, past the southwest corner of June Rowlands Park and into Mount Pleasant Cemetery at the Mount Pleasant Road, where the high water-table present even today waters a small wetland garden. The waters from the former creek then flowed southeast to exit into Moore Park Ravine.  Surface section  alt= The sole remaining section of Mud Creek that flows is the open section south of Moore Avenue, starting at the Moor Park Ravine. Much of the water flowing in this surface portion of Mud Creek is not from its former or local watershed, rather it is diverted from the Forman and Bayview Avenue storm sewers located north east of the ravine, which drains the Upper Cudmore Creek watershed. The open section of Mud Creek runs 2.1km to the Don River, mostly adjacent to the Beltline Trail where it is buried for short stretches as it is repeatedly diverted to opposite sides of the trail before finally emerging through the Don Valley Brick Works. = Moore Park Ravine = Mud Creek ran next to Moore Park station of the Toronto Belt Line Railway. Moore Park Ravine begins just south of Moore Avenue and ends with the open space of the Don River valley. Adjoining Mont Pleasant Cemetery, the first portion of the ravine from Moore Avenue to Heath Street (c. 1890s Clarence Avenue) was known as Spring Valley and was marketed by the Toronto Belt Line Railway Company as such with the name also applied to the creek. The creek and the ravine is considered one of the best nature walks in Toronto. = Don Valley Brick Works = The creek enters into the Don River valley at the Don Valley Brick Works, where its flow bifurcates through or adjacent to the ponds, and then re-converges shortly before exiting into the Don River south of Bayview Avenue. The ponds serves to hold and provide biological filtration for the inflow from Mud Creek prior to discharge into the Don River, and is part of Toronto storm-water management strategy. Due to the geology and depth of the ravine, erosion and foresting work has been ongoing to preserve its integrity as well as the Beltline Trail that runs through it.

The brother and successor of Juya Chanyu, he reigned from 8 BC to 13 AD. Wuzhuliu sent his son Wududiyasi to the Han imperial court upon his accession and arranged for his son Jiliukun to go to the Han court upon his death. Wuzhuliu died in 13 AD and was succeeded by his brother, Wulei Chanyu. Wuzhuliu refused to return land to the Wusun but returned hostages to them. In 3 BC, Wuzhuliu proposed a visit to the Han court. The Han were initially reluctant but eventually agreed after Yang Xiong advised Emperor Ai of Han that it would be unwise to rebuff such a gesture. Wuzhuliu visited Chang'an in 1 BC. In 6 AD, two kings of the Jushi, Gugou and Tangdou, fled to the Xiongnu. However, Wuzhuliu turned them over to the Han due to the convention of four clauses, whereby he would not harbour fugitives from China, the Wusun, the Wuhuan, or the city states of the Western Regions. In return the Han sent gifts to the chanyu. However, among the gifts was a seal which aroused suspicions from Wuzhuliu that the text it bore implied a degradation of his status. The Han envoys smashed the seal but it was too late. The Xiongnu came into conflict with the Wuhuan and took territory from them. They were criticized for this by the Han as it contravened the terms of their convention. In response Wuzhuliu sent a large force under Puhuluzi to show his strength near Shuofang Commandery. In 10 AD, Hulanzhi, elder brother of the king of Jushi, fled to the Xiongnu. Four Han officials also defected to the Xiongnu. Wang Mang attempted to split the Xiongnu among 15 chanyus and named two, Xiao Chanyu and Shun Chanyu, which angered Wuzhuliu. In 11 AD, Wuzhuliu retaliated by sending an armed expedition to Yunzhong, Yanmen, and Shuofang commanderies, slaughtering a number of civilians. In 13 AD, Wuzhuliu died and was succeeded by his brother, Wulei Chanyu, who had previously been named Xiao Chanyu by the Han.

The two can be distinguished by the difference in the blue and black chain-like pattern of the ocelli. O. bimaculatus hunt and feed on a diverse number of benthic organisms that also reside off the coast of Southern California. Once the octopus reaches sexual maturity, it shortly dies after mating, which is approximately 12‚Äì18 months after hatching. Embryonic development tends to be rapid due to this short lifespan of these organisms.  Description  Octopus bimaculatus is typically light brown and spotted in color with a distinctive blue and black false eye, or ocellus, under each eye. The mantle, including the beak and mouth, is located at the center of eight tentacles. Each of the tentacles is lined with suckers that are used to help with grasping prey, rocks, and forming shelters. Similar to other octopus species, O. bimaculatus has skin covered in chromatophores. During the post- larval stage, there are only a few chromatophores and they are called the \\"founder chromatophores.\\" However, as the octopus matures, more chromatophores form and cover the skin. These chromatophores are pigments that the octopus can expand to create large disc of color that can blend in with the surrounding environment. This is an important behavior that can be used in both defense against predators or to remain hidden from prey before an ambush attack. Fully mature octopus grow to be about 18 inches long. = Distinctive features = O. bimaculatus gets its name \\"two-spotted octopus\\" from the blue and black ocelli under each eye. One potential function of these bright blue ocelli is to allow the octopus to appear as a different animal with large eyes as it swims swiftly through the water. O. bimaculatus is often confused with Octopus bimaculoides due to the similarity in looks, however they are two different species. They both have these two distinctive black and blue ocelli beneath the eyes and above the arms, however there are a few key differences in their features to tell the two species apart. The blue ring of the ocelli for Octopus bimaculatus does not have the same distinctive chain-like pattern that the Octopus bimaculoides has. For O. bimaculatus the pattern is still chain-like but more irregular, asymmetrical, and disproportionate while for O. bimaculoides the chain-like pattern is more symmetrical and orderly. The two also differ in egg size, with Octopus bimaculatus eggs being much smaller that hatch into planktonic larvae rather than benthic hatchlings like octopus bimaculoides. Additionally, octopus bimaculatus is generally the larger of the two species. Difference in chain-like pattern of ocelli between O. bimaculatus and O. bimaculoides  Feeding  = Diet = O. bimaculatus is known to prey on crustaceans, snails, chitons, limpets, and bivalves. Studies have observed the predator-prey interactions between the O. bimaculatus and the Californian Scorpionfish (Scorpaena guttata) in aquariums. Findings suggest that the Californian Scorpionfish is included in the diet of O. bimaculatus in their natural habitat, specifically juvenile Scorpionfish. As juveniles, the octopus tend to prey on smaller benthic, marine invertebrates which include chitons, bivalves, snails, and crabs. Additionally, diet appears to be strongly influenced by location, season, and sex. = Hunting = O. bimaculatus hunt regularly by swimming along the seafloor and pouncing at their prey using their web to feel if they successfully captured their prey. After capture, they use their beak and radula to consume their prey. There has been observations of certain species of fish following the octopus into kelp forests looking for scraps from the octopus prey.  Habitat  O. bimaculatus mainly resides off the coast of Southern California in the intertidal and subtidal regions. These octopus have been observed in kelp forests, bed rock, and rock walls. Typically found on the seafloor, these octopus occupy areas beneath rocks, inside of holes and inside crevices. Juvenile octopus utilize the smaller areas in bedrock, including empty shells found around the bedrock. Frequently used shells for shelter include the shells of Cypraea spadicea, Astraea undosa, and Hinnites giganteus. Larger octopus have the ability and power to \\"blow\\" sand or move sand to create shelter. They do this through a mechanism called jet propulsion, which allow them to pump water out quickly through a siphon exerting enough force to move sediment. This process allows the octopus to dig deep holes for shelter in a matter of minutes. The arms of O. bimaculatus are also useful in creating shelter. Each arm is covered in suckers that give the octopus the ability to grip and move smooth wet surfaces such as rocks and shells. Octopus tend to move from shelter to shelter only residing in one shelter for a short 1-3 month time period before moving onto the next. Octopus leave their shelters for a number of reasons, the primary reason being to forage. Other reasons include competition for space with other octopus or fleeing an area with high risk of predation. Predators known to hunt O. bimaculatus include the California sheephead (Semicossyphus pulcher), the kelp bass (Paralabrax clathratus), and the California moray eel (Gymnothorax mordax)  Lifespan  O. bimaculatus lives about 12‚Äì18 months. Young are planktonic for one to several months before settling on the ground. However, in captivity, O. bimaculatus has been observed to live up to 2 years.  Reproduction  Most matings occur in May and June when water temperatures are rising, but they may mate throughout the year. Most females then lay their eggs between April and August. Mating ranges from 10 to 60 minutes long. During this time, the male extends a modified arm called the hectocotylus which transfers spermatophores to the female. After the eggs are fertilized, the females lay their eggs in a sheltered area protected by rocks. The amount of eggs laid depends on the size on the female, but typically the number of eggs are very high, with the average being approximately 20,000 eggs, about 100 to 250 per strand. The larger females tend to lay more eggs than the smaller females. After the eggs are laid, the females stay to care for and protect the eggs until they hatch into planktonic larvae. Females tend to die during the process of watching over the eggs due to starvation and exhaustion.  Development  The stages of development on average range over a period of 50.4 days after fertilization occurs. The eggs fully develop over a range of 30‚Äì90 days depending on water temperature. Studies have found development time is shortest, 31 days, when the water temperature is at 19.7 degrees C. There are two major stages in the development; the rapid initial stage and the second slower stage. Newly hatched eggs are planktonic and on average are 4 mm long from the top of the mantle to the end of the arms. Much of the embryonic development is similar and can be described by the development of Octopus vulgaris.

Grier is a former superintendent of the Houston Independent School District (HISD), the largest school district in the State of Texas, as well as the San Diego Unified School District (SDUSD) and Guilford County Schools. Early life He was born into a low income family, in which members were poorly educated, in Fairmont, North Carolina. He was the first member of his family to attend university and received his PhD from Vanderbilt University. Mimi Swartz of Texas Monthly stated that his PhD \\"was no doubt a source of pride, an indication of just how far he had come.\\" Career In a twenty-five year span, Grier worked for eight different school districts. He initially served as an athletic coach and later as a teacher. He first became a school superintendent at age 34. Grier served as the superintendent of Guilford County Schools for fewer than eight years. Swartz stated that this length of service was \\"a lifetime in the annals of superintendents\\" in the U.S. He served as the superintendent of San Diego USD for one and one half years; Swartz described his SDUSD term as \\"combative\\". Once the SDUSD board ended supporting Grier, he looked for other employment opportunities. =Houston Independent School District= Grier, who arrived in Houston in August 2009, began his term at HISD after all members of that district's board voted to hire him in September 2009. Grier's wife saw promotional material for HISD and suggested going to that district, which had two times the budget and overall size of the previous one. HISD board members wanted to improve the district's perceived standing - among the best of urban districts but still below average overall - without installing too much radical change, and they felt that a stronger personality was needed to check Gayle Fallon, the head of the Houston Federation of Teachers. While the previous superintendent, Abelardo Saavedra, decentralized management at HISD, Grier re-centralized it. Grier established the Apollo 20 program, using a more rigorous curriculum at schools known for having low test scores. Swartz characterized Apollo 20 as being similar to that of KIPP, a charter school network. Swartz explained that rising superintendents tend to enact innovative programs as those who are perceived as doing too little are often fired, and that for Grier Apollo 20 serves as his \\"novel program that attracts attention and helps them advance when the end comes, as it inevitably does.\\" Grier also commissioned a study that concluded that magnet school programs - previously seen as being highly successful in HISD - should be severely curtailed. Swartz stated that initially Grier, who was perceived as being \\"brusque\\", was seen as a potential reformer who could make necessary changes and that in July 2010 Grier \\"was still a pretty popular guy\\". The Houston Chronicle initially ran content supportive of Grier. However Swartz stated that by 2011 several vocal groups made heated rhetoric against Grier. She explained there were members of the public who believed Grier was too ambitious and trying to change too many things at once, contrasting him with Saavedra, who she stated was perceived as having accomplished relatively little. A May 2011 editorial by a teacher leaving HISD in the Chronicle was the first article in that paper that was critical of Grier. Swartz described Grier as \\"smart and articulate and charming\\" but that since people often have different facets of their personalities, it means other characterizations may also be accurate. The business networks of Houston and the HISD board were in favor of Grier. Grier resigned effective March 1, 2016; his work was to end on February 29. His contract was originally scheduled to end in June of that year. Laura Isensee of Houston Public Media stated that the length of Grier's term outlasted the three-year average for a superintendent of a large school district.

It is in the eastern portion of the New Bilibid Prison Reservation lying close to the NBP Gate 1 at its boundary with Camella Homes Alabang IV-A and the Tensuan villages of Poblacion along the South Luzon Expressway. The lake lies just to north of the Magdaong River which flows down to the southern boundary of the reservation into Muntinlupa's border with Bacoor. It has no visible inlets or outlets. Its water level depends mainly on ground water level or precipitation amount. Jamboree Lake is in a hilly area and is surrounded by trees and greenery, with a depressed garden, known simply as Sunken Garden, located immediately to the southwest. Near its southern edge is the Memorial Hill that features a vintage Japanese cannon used during World War II, as well as a grotto statue of Our Lady of Lourdes and the burial ground of Major Eriberto Misa, the longest serving director of the New Bilibid Prison. The lake and its gardens are bounded by General Paulino Santos Avenue and Insular Prison Road. The main prison facility and maximum security compound is located south of Jamboree Lake at the southern end of General Paulino Santos Avenue. The lake contains habitats of tilapia and silver perch. History Very little is known about the lake's origins, other than the presence of a small replica of the Statue of Liberty that once stood in the middle of the lake during the 1940s. With the transfer of inmates from the Old Bilibid Prison (Bilibid Viejo or C√°rcel y Presidio Correccional) in Santa Cruz, Manila to this new facility in 1941, the lands surrounding the lake served as the prison's food production area. Early inmates from the Cordillera Administrative Region helped develop the area by building terraces along the lake's shoreline reminiscent of the rice terraces in their native Ifugao. The lake also figured during World War II and was also near the site where the first regular masses were held in the 1950s before a permanent chapel (Our Lady of Mercy) was built to serve the prison employees and inmates. In 1955, the Statue of Liberty replica was replaced by the Lady of Justice statue designed by former Bureau of Corrections officer Moses Saunar. The lake was declared a \\"cultural and historical wealth\\" by the local government and was placed under the jurisdiction and management of the Muntinlupa Cultural Affairs Office and Tourism Council in 1999.

He played mainly in the position of defender, but also as midfielder. He was known as Enderlin (II) because his brother Alfred Enderlin (I) played for Basel during the same period, but as a forward. Club career Between the years 1926 and 1935 Enderlin (II) played a total of 182 games for Basel scoring just one goal. 109 of these games were in the Swiss Serie A, twenty in the Swiss Cup and 53 were friendly games. He scored his only goal during the test game in Norway, in Porsgrunn, against Ur√¶dd FK on 9 June 1930. A well-documented curiosity was that at the end of Basel's 1929‚Äì30 season, the team set off on a Scandinavian football tour, including a visit to Germany. Six games were played in Norway, but the first was played in Leipzig. The team travelled with 15 players, their trainer Kert√©sz and two functionaries. The journey started with a train ride on 2 June 1930 at quarter past seven in the morning from Basel and they arrived in Leipzig at half passed eight that evening. The game against VfB Leipzig was played the next evening. The following one and a half days were spent travelling by train, train, ship, train and train again to Drammen in Norway. Only a few hours after their arrival, the team played a game against a joint team Mj√∏ndalen IF / SBK Drafn. The next day was a train journey to Porsgrunn and two matches in 24 hours. Following that they travelled per bus and then by ship in a 48-hour journey to Bergen for a match against SK Brann. Another ship voyage, this time to Stavanger, two games against Viking FK, then a ship voyage back to Bergen. Finally, the tour ended with three train journeys in three days, Bergen/Oslo/Berlin/Basel, arriving at home on 20 June. The result of this tour was seven games, four wins, one draw, two defeats and approximately 160 hours of travelling. Enderlin (II) was participant in this tour. He played in five games and scored that one goal. He was a member of the Basel team that won the Swiss Cup in the 1932‚Äì33 season. The final was played in the Hardturm stadium against Grasshopper Club. Basel won 4‚Äì3 and this was the club's first ever national title.

Battle of Sheriffmuir Harrison joined the army and was a cornet in the 4th Dragoon Guards in 1697, ADC to the Duke of Ormonde, Lord lieutenant of Ireland before 1705, captain and lieutenant colonel in the 1st Foot Guards in 1705, brevet colonel in 1707 and colonel of the 6th Foot from 1708 to 1716. He was adjutant-general in Spain in 1708 and brought back Lord Stanhope‚Äôs despatches after the victory at the Battle of Saragossa in 1710, for which he received ¬£1,000 from Queen Anne. In 1715 he was adjutant-general in Scotland where he was present at the Battle of Sheriffmuir and brought the Duke of Argyll's despatches to George I, who gave him ¬£500. He sold his regiment in March 1716. Harrison stood for Parliament at Steyning at a by-election in 1724, but was defeated in a contest. He was brought in as Member of Parliament for Old Sarum at a by-election on 30 May 1728 when Thomas Pitt recruited two voters to defeat the single supporter of Henry Fox. In Parliament he voted with the Administration on the Hessians in 1730 but against them on the excise bill in 1733 and on the repeal of the Septennial Act in 1734. He was not chosen again at the 1734 British general election and when Thomas Pitt put up his brother William Pitt for Old Sarum at a by-election in 1735, Harrison offered to pay him off, which William Pitt considered absurd and impertinent. Harrison was probably unmarried and died before 1755. His brothers Edward and George Harrison were also MPs.

To aid in the support of his family, Eagleson secured an engagement as a supernumerary at New York's Bowery Theatre. He made his first appearance on the stage as an actor in 1863-64, at Albany, with James H. Hackett in King Henry IV, assuming the stage name Thomas Wallace Keene. He was married, September 29, 1861, to Margaret A., daughter of Ann and James Creighton. He served as a volunteer in the American Civil War, 1861-65, and after its close joined a stock company in Newark, New Jersey. He played juvenile parts with leading stars at Wood's theatre. New York City, in 1867. He joined the stock company of the National Theatre, Cincinnati, Ohio, and traveled through the west taking the parts of Macbeth, Hamlet and Richard III, 1869. He played burlesque and melodramatic parts at Wood's Museum, New York city, 1870-74. Between engagements at Wood's Museum in 1870 he made his debut in London, England, in the leading role of Across the Continent, and after a tour of the provinces he returned to Wood's Museum and appeared as Joe Morgan in Ten Nights in a Bar-Room. He supported E. L. Davenport, Charlotte Cushman and Clara Morris, and in 1875 was leading man to John McCullough in California. In 1876 when Edwin Booth played an engagement there Keene alternated the roles of Iago and Othello with Booth, and Cassius, Brutus and Mark Antony with Booth and McCullough, and played Iago to McCullough's Othello and Macduff to his Macbeth.

He was engaged by Eugene Tompkins of the Boston Theatre, in 1879, and made a sensation by his acting of Couplan the drunkard in Zola's Drink and also played the leading roles in a number of Shakespearean plays. He starred under the management of William R. Hayden for eight successive seasons (1880-88) in a repertory of Shakespeare's plays. In style he was essentially melodramatic. A paralytic shock rendered him speechless in 1886, but electrical treatment enabled him to resume his profession. His last appearance was in the character of Richelieu at Hamilton, Ontario, May 23, 1898. He resided in Castleton Corners, Staten Island, for the last 16 years of his life, amassing of library of some 2,600 books as well as costumes, autographs, and other theatre memorabilia.

Each episode, the characters and context of one chapter in the Harry Potter series are explored through a different central theme like 'vulnerability', 'betrayal', or 'friendship'. The podcast, which charted #2 on the US iTunes Charts a few months after its inception in 2016, has been described as \\"Bible studies for J.K. Rowling fans\\". History The project originated at Harvard Divinity School, where both founders studied and shared an interest in religion without God - with Vanessa Zoltan describing herself as \\"an atheist and a Jew and a humanist\\" and Casper Ter Kuile training as a minister for non-religious people. The inspiration for the podcast was a lecture by Zoltan on reading Jane Eyre as a sacred text, which Ter Kuile attended. As a fan of the Harry Potter books, he persuaded Zoltan to attempt to apply the same method of sacred reading to Harry Potter. In 2015, the duo started a weekly book club in the off-campus Humanist Hub. They chose the Harry Potter series because of its wide cultural reach and its coverage of life's big questions - like love, friendship, family and loss - with Ter Kuile noting that Harry Potter is \\"often a text that people turn to in real times of trouble\\". When the book club grew in popularity and gained interest internationally, Zoltan and Ter Kuile decided to turn their project into a podcast. Harvard Divinity student Ariana Nedelman, an experienced digital producer, was enlisted to help make the transition from book club to podcast production. A Kickstarter project was set up to fund the production, which successfully raised $3,549 - exceeding their original $3,000 goal. On April 17, 2020, it was announced that after the podcast went through all seven books, the podcast would restart the series with Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone again. With this announcement came the news that after Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was finished on the podcast, the host Casper Ter Kuile would be leaving, and the podcast would instead be hosted by Vanessa Zoltan and Matt Potts, an Episcopal Priest and an Associate Professor of Religion and Literature and of Ministry Studies at Harvard Divinity School, who has visited the show as a guest on numerous occasions. Format The podcast follows the composition of the Harry Potter book series; each regular podcast episode covers a chapter of the book, and each podcast season ends when the book is finished. Besides discussing a different chapter each week, every episode also has a different theme through which the text is explored, like 'love', 'forgiveness', 'duty', or 'heartbreak'. Most episodes follow the same format. Recurring segments include: * Opening Story from one of the hosts (or sometimes a guest) that relates to and encompasses the theme of the episode. * 30-second recap, in which the hosts compete to summarize this week's chapter as comprehensively as possible; * Reading and discussing the chapter through the week's theme. For instance, in an episode about shame, the show explored ways in which the characters can be seen to act out of shame or embarrassment. * Sacred reading: a specific sacred reading practice is applied to part of the chapter. Practices used include chavruta, pardes, florilegium and lectio divina. * Fan voicemail: listeners of the podcast send in their own personal stories related to the book or a topic discussed in a previous episode. The topics are usually quite serious; for instance in season 3 a listener from Austin, Texas shared her thoughts on the recent University of Texas stabbing related to the theme of forgiveness. * Blessing: the podcast closes with Zoltan and Ter Kuile each choosing to bless a character from the chapter. Since the inception of the podcast, Zoltan has endeavoured to always pledge her blessing each episode to a female character in the chapter, which has, in some instances, particularly highlighted the complete absence of female presence in some chapters of Harry Potter. Episodes Harry Potter and the Sacred Text features several different types of episodes: regular episodes of the show discuss individual chapters of the Harry Potter books at a rate of one chapter per podcast episode; in addition, each season of the show ends with a wrap-up episode that discusses the volume as a whole and at least one Owl Post episode, wherein at least one of the hosts listens and responds to several listener voicemails. These episodes often feature a guest, who is invited to speak on a topic related to understanding and practicing spirituality. There are also eleven full-length special episodes, including a look at Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, a recording of the very first Harry Potter and the Sacred Text Live Event, extended conversations with special guests to the show, looks ahead to what the team is excited about for future episodes, and others. These episodes typically run between 30 and 45 minutes. As of June 21, 2020, there are 202 full-length regular episodes of the podcast. In addition, eight episodes of the series The Women of Harry Potter were originally released in the Harry Potter and the Sacred Text feed as special episodes, mostly throughout Season 5. These episodes, offering in depth blessings for and character discussions of the women from the Harry Potter Story, were moved into their own show feed beginning with Season 6 and then discontinued as a separate entity; instead being offered as a perk of becoming a member to the show's Patreon. Host Casper ter Kuile has also released special readings of poems for Christmas and the band Harry and the Potters recorded a song called \\"Don't Be a Dursley\\" as a part of the show's fundraiser for RAICES. The show has released notes to its community in seven instances: during Season 2, a note post-2016 US Presidential election; during Season 3, a note on white supremacy after the massacre at Charlottesville; during Season 4, an update on a contest the show was running; during Season 5, a note on the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court of the United States; during Season 6, a note on the Don't Be A Dursley campaign to raise money to aid RAICES and a second note toward the end of the season at the beginning of the Covid-19 lockdown in the United States; and during Season 7, a note announcing a fundraiser in support of Black Lives Matter. Other activities Zoltan and Ter Kuile also host live shows, which are 'inspired' by the podcast but include more interactive elements. Live events have included games, live music, audience participation and meditations. Harry Potter and the Sacred Text live shows have been featured at conventions like LeakyCon, PodCon and Nerdcon:Nerdfighteria. While the original book club started by Zoltan and Ter Kuile continues to this day, local reading groups for Harry Potter and the Sacred Text have sprung up all around the US as well as in the UK, Europe, Canada and Australia. Reception Harry Potter and the Sacred Text charted #2 on the iTunes Podcast Charts in August 2016 and has around 100,000 listeners per week. The podcast was listed in The Guardian's \\"50 best podcasts of 2016\\", taking the number two spot in the category \\"Culture and Sport\\", and featured second on Entertainment Weekly's \\"Must List\\" in September 2016 According to The Daily Dot, \\"the beauty of the podcast comes from the storytelling and analysis\\". They consider the show a fascinating way to revisit the Harry Potter books, adding that it \\"manages to respect and reflect on a range of faiths and religions from around the world.\\" The Jewish Journal describes Harry Potter and the Sacred Text as \\"proudly idealistic, but also grounded in realism\\", while the Utah Statesman praises the hosts' charm: \\"Zoltan and ter Kuile have been accomplishing their goal of relating Harry Potter text to real-world lessons, but it is their nerdy and friendly personalities that keep me coming back for more each week.\\" However, some publications express reservations about co-opting religious language for secular texts. Conservative journal LifeZette posits: \\"Fans of the podcast are using terminology previously used by or about Christian believers to describe their trust in Jesus Christ as Savior, yet now they‚Äôre talking about ‚Ä¶ a wizard.\\" and says about Vanessa Zoltan \\"Clearly, she and her colleagues are 'up to something.'\\" Religious journal First Things gives a mixed review, criticising the lack of solid basis for its definition of 'sacred' and noting: \\"It seems that the hosts of this show are great on quips, but not so good on metaphysics\\". However, they praise the podcast's humble approach to the text and consider it part of a valuable literary culture that loves books for their 'hidden gifts': \\"much of HPST is simply an exercise in thoughtful reading‚Äîthe kind of joyful reflection that draws avid readers and makes avid readers, that reminds us how great books comes alive when we trust them to teach us something\\".

Originally studied by Felix Klein in the complex projective plane in connection with the Klein quartic, it was first realized in the Euclidean plane by Branko Gr√ºnbaum and John F. Rigby. History and notation The Gr√ºnbaum‚ÄìRigby configuration was known to Felix Klein, William Burnside, and H. S. M. Coxeter.; ; ; . Its original description by Klein in 1879 marked the first appearance in the mathematical literature of a 4-configuration, a system of points and lines with four points per line and four lines per point. In Klein's description, these points and lines belong to the complex projective plane, a space whose coordinates are complex numbers rather than the real-number coordinates of the Euclidean plane. The geometric realisation of this configuration as points and lines in the Euclidean plane, based on overlaying three regular heptagrams, was only established much later, by . Their paper on it became the first of a series of works on configurations by Gr√ºnbaum, and contained the first published graphical depiction of a 4-configuration. In the notation of configurations, configurations with 21 points, 21 lines, 4 points per line and 4 lines per point are denoted (214). However, the notation does not specify the configuration itself, only its type (the numbers of points, lines, and incidences). It also does not specify whether the configuration is purely combinatorial (an abstract incidence pattern of lines and points) or whether the points and lines of the configuration are realizable in the Euclidean plane or another standard geometry. The type (214) is highly ambiguous: there is an unknown but large number of (combinatorial) configurations of this type, 200 of which were listed by . Construction The Gr√ºnbaum‚ÄìRigby configuration can be constructed from the seven points of a regular heptagon and its 14 interior diagonals. To complete the 21 points and lines of the configuration, these must be augmented by 14 more points and seven more lines. The remaining 14 points of the configuration are the points where pairs of equal-length diagonals of the heptagon cross each other. These form two smaller heptagons, one for each of the two lengths of diagonal; the sides of these smaller heptagons are the diagonals of the outer heptagon. Each of the two smaller heptagons has 14 diagonals, seven of which are shared with the other smaller heptagon. The seven shared diagonals are the remaining seven lines of the configuration. The original construction of the Gr√ºnbaum‚ÄìRigby configuration by Klein viewed its points and lines as belonging to the complex projective plane, rather than the Euclidean plane. In this space, the points and lines form the perspective centers and axes of the perspective transformations of the Klein quartic.. See transl. p. 297. They have the same pattern of point-line intersections as the Euclidean version of the configuration. The finite projective plane PG(2,7) has 57 points and 57 lines, and can be given coordinates based on the integers modulo 7. In this space, every conic C (the set of solutions to a two-variable quadratic equation modulo 7) has 28 secant lines through pairs of its points, 8 tangent lines through a single point, and 21 nonsecant lines that are disjoint from C. Dually, there are 28 points where pairs of tangent lines meet, 8 points on C, and 21 interior points that do not belong to any tangent line. The 21 nonsecant lines and 21 interior points form an instance of the Gr√ºnbaum‚ÄìRigby configuration, meaning that again these points and lines have the same pattern of intersections. Properties The projective dual of this configuration, a system of points and lines with a point for every line of the configuration and a line for every point, and with the same point-line incidences, is the same configuration. The symmetry group of the configuration includes symmetries that take any incident pair of points and lines to any other incident pair. The Gr√ºnbaum‚ÄìRigby configuration is an example of a polycyclic configuration, that is, a configuration with cyclic symmetry, such that each orbit of points or lines has the same number of elements.

As the founder of Voters Not Politicians, she organized thousands of volunteers who collected over 425,000 voter signatures for Proposal 2, a ballot initiative amending the state constitution to create an independent redistricting commission. The campaign garnered national attention and brought in millions of dollars in donations. Opponents sued to keep the measure off the ballot, but the Michigan Court of Appeals and the Michigan Supreme Court allowed it, and on November 6, 2018, the state electorate voted overwhelmingly to pass Proposal 2. Fahey now serves as Executive Director of The People, a national nonpartisan reform organization.  Education and early career  Fahey earned degrees in Sustainable Business and Community Leadership from Aquinas College in 2011. After college she worked for SpartanNash, creating a successful sustainability program for the grocery chain. She then went to work for the Michigan Recycling Coalition as a program coordinator.  Voters Not Politicians  Fahey, an independent voter, became concerned about the country's increasing political polarization during the 2016 election season. Gerrymandering was an issue she believed most people could agree on regardless of their political party. Shortly after the November election, she posted a message on Facebook: \\"I'd like to take on gerrymandering in Michigan. If you're interested in doing this as well, please let me know.\\" Dozens of people responded and formed a citizens group called Voters Not Politicians (VNP). On March 4, 2017, around 70 people attended the group's first town hall meeting in the Marquette, Michigan, public library. In all, VNP held 33 such meetings in as many days, asking people across the state how they thought a fair redistricting system should work. Volunteers also studied other states' systems and sought advice from election law experts. They wrote a proposal for a ballot initiative which would create a 13-member redistricting commission consisting of four Republicans, four Democrats, and five voters with no party affiliation, all to be selected through a random drawing of registered voters, supervised by the Michigan Secretary of State. The proposal barred anyone from serving on the commission who had held a politically-affiliated position within the past six years, including elected officials, candidates, lobbyists, and political consultants. The ballot initiative, known as the Independent Redistricting Commission Initiative, or simply Proposal 2, was approved by the Board of State Canvassers in August 2017. VNP then had 180 days to collect the over 315,000 signatures required to get the proposal on the November 2018 ballot. With no physical home office and almost no funds, Fahey organized an estimated 4,000 volunteers who collected over 425,000 signatures from all 83 Michigan counties, and turned them in two months before the deadline. Opponents funded by the Michigan Chamber of Commerce sued twice to have the measure kept off the ballot, arguing that it was too expansive to be considered an amendment to the state constitution and that a state constitutional convention was required. The Michigan Court of Appeals ruled in favor of VNP in June 2018, and in July, the Michigan Supreme Court ruled 4-3 in VNP's favor. By that time, VNP volunteers had already knocked on tens of thousands of doors, talking to voters about Proposal 2. They often crowdsourced on social media to solve problems on the fly. For example, a local business owner who contacted the group through Facebook mass-produced thousands of inexpensive clipboards for the canvassers to use. The campaign garnered attention from political figures such as former President Barack Obama and former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and, as Election Day drew near, took in millions of dollars in donations. On November 6, 2018, Michigan voters overwhelmingly approved Proposal 2. At the election night party in Detroit, Fahey said, \\"The thing we proved tonight is that we are our own saviors. We the people can save ourselves.\\" Slay the Dragon, a documentary about Fahey and VNP produced by Participant Media, premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York on April 27, 2019.

It is also the first novel in the War Between the Provinces series, a fantasy version retelling of the American Civil War. Plot When Avram (a parody of Abraham Lincoln) became King of Detina (Detinu is \\"United\\" spelled backwards - a parody of the USA) following the death of his father King Buchan (a parody of James Buchanan), he declared he intended to liberate the blond serfs from their ties to the land. The northern provinces (a parody of the Southern United States), where most of the serfs lived, do not accept his lordship. The hot north was a land of broad estates, whose noble overlords took the serfs' labor and gave back next to nothing. Those provinces secede from Detina, choosing Avram's cousin, Grand Duke Geoffrey (a parody of Jefferson Davis), as their king in his place. Avram refuses to let Geoffrey rule the north without a challenge. The southern provinces (a parody of the Union), full of merchants and smallholders stood solidly behind him. So he sent armies clad in gray against the north. Geoffrey raised his own army, and arrayed his men in blue made from the indigo much raised on northern estates to distinguish them from the southrons. This begins the Detian Civil War. In Sentry Peak, the story begins with Detina general Guildenstern (a parody of Union General Rosecrans; the name comes from Shakespeare's Hamlet, where Rosencranz is a minor character, as is Guildenstern) going on his war unicorn to meet Thraxton the Braggart (a parody of Confederate general Braxton Bragg) of the northern provinces, for a clash at Sentry Peak (a parody of Lookout Mountain) near Rising Rock (a parody of Chattanooga, Tennessee - whose name means \\"rock rising to a point\\" in the Creek language). Guildenstern is accompanied by Lieutenant General George, nicknamed \\"doubting George\\" (a parody of Major General George H. Thomas, commander of the Union XIV Corps). Everything else in the story is a parody in a vein similar to these examples.

Her lab also determined these inhibitors' mechanism of action and ways the virus could develop resistance to them. Hazuda has also performed extensive research and led the development of antivirals for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) including Elbasvir and Grazoprevir. She currently serves as Vice President for Infectious Diseases Discovery for Merck and Chief Scientific Officer of their MRL Cambridge Exploratory Science Center.  Early life and education  Hazuda was raised in Hillsborough, New Jersey. Her father was an engineer and her mother worked in the regulatory-compliance division of Janssen Pharmaceutica (now a part of Johnson & Johnson). She initially pursued a premedical degree at Georgetown University, but fell in love with research during a part-time job in a lab and decided to go into drug discovery. She earned got a B.S. from Rutgers University, followed by a PhD in biochemistry from the State University of New York at Stony Brook, where she trained with Cheng-Wen Wu. She then did a post-doctoral research fellowship at Smith, Kline, and French in the department of Molecular Genetics.  Career and research  Hazuda joined Merck in 1989, where she started as a Senior Research Biochemist in the antiviral research group. She was initially assigned to work on influenza, but she asked to be switched to HIV research. She continues to oversee Merck's HIV research, which includes the development of long-acting antiretrovirals. She has also been instrumental in the development of antiviral treatments for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), leading the development of antivirals for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) including Elbasvir and Grazoprevir. Additionally, as Chief Scientific Officer of the Merck Research Laboratory Cambridge Exploratory Science Center she oversees research on interactions between the human microbiome and immunity. She previously served as Global Director of Scientific Affairs for Antivirals in Merck's division of Global Human Health, as well as co-site head of basic research for the Merck West Point research facility. Hazuda is on the editorial board of the American Chemical Society Journal on Anti-infectives Research and the Journal of Viral Eradication. She previously served on the scientific advisory boards of and the Center for Aids Research (CFAR) of UCLA and the Gladstone Institute as well as the NIH Aids Research Advisory Committee (ARAC). She is a member of The Forum for HCV Collaborative Research, the NCI Basic Sciences Board of Scientific Counselors, and the Scientific Program Advisory Council of the American Foundation for Aids Research (AMFAR). = Research on HIV-1 integrase inhibitors = As a retrovirus, HIV has an RNA genome which it reverse transcribes into a double-stranded DNA copy, which it then inserts into the host cell's genome. This insertion is done by an enzyme called integrase which has several sequential functions: it binds to the ends of the viral DNA and processes them by removing a couple of nucleotides from each end. It then aids the 3'OH of the viral DNA in attacking the phosphodiester backbone of the host DNA, cleaving it at an integration site and attaching the viral DNA in a step called strand transfer. Cellular enzymes then fill in the gaps. Hazuda was not the first or only scientist working to develop integrase inhibitors. However, whereas most scientists were focused on blocking the early steps (and were not having much success), Hazuda focused on the later, strand transfer, step. In order to screen for inhibitors of this step, she had to develop a new assay, which involved viral \\"donor DNA\\" mimics attached to the wells of a plate and labeled target DNA. Integrase strand transfer activity was measured by the labeled DNA getting stuck to the well after unreacted products were washed off. The assay worked, but it was incompatible with the available robots, so she and two assistants, over several months in 1999, had to pipet over 250,000 compounds by hand. In 2000, her group published two key papers showing effective integrase inhibitors could be made. She demonstrated that the inhibitors she had identified acted as Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitor (InSTI), binding to viral DNA-bound integrase, chelating the active site magnesium ions, and thereby preventing the complex from binding to cellular DNA. Through a collaboration with Merck researchers in Rome, raltegravir (Isentress) was found - it was originally developed as a potential hepatitis C polymerase inhibitor which was found to be ineffective for that purpose. It was approved by the FDA for use in patients with HIV in October 2007.  Honors and awards  Hazuda has received the Bernie Field Lecture Award and the David Barry DART (Development of Antiretroviral Therapies) Achievement Award. The integrase inhibitor she led the development of, Isentress (ralteglavir), was awarded the Prix Galien prize in 2008. She was awarded the Italian Premio Galeno Award for this work. In 2019 she Ohio State University presented her with the Distinguished Research Career Award. In 2017, she was part of a team of chemists awarded the ‚ÄúHeroes of Chemistry‚Äù award from the American Chemical Society for the development of the HCV combination therapy Elbasvir/Grazoprevir.

The posterior end is rounded or truncate and the anterior end is narrowed; however, cells can span from ovoid, to fusiform or triangular, to elongately oval. A distinguishing feature of the euglenoids is the presence of proteinaceous pellicle strips that are underlined with microtubules.Larsen, Jacob; Patterson, David J. (1990). \\"Some flagellates (Protista) from tropical marine sediments‚Äù. Journal of Natural History, 24 (4): 801-937. doi:10.1080/00222939000770571 In Petalomonas, cells are covered with approximately a dozen thickly, fused pellicle strips making the cell very rigid and possibly resistant to surface ice crystal formation that can disrupt the cell. These pellicle strips, unlike most euglenoids, are lacking grooves or troughs; however, species specific pellicle features, such as pleat-like thickenings at the joints of pellicle strips, that characterize P. cantuscygni, can distinguish certain species. Strong ribs or keels are also evident in these cells, which can be arranged spirally or relatively straight, ranging in width. Some species may contain furrows that vary in size and depth, and can be located dorsally and/or ventrally on the body of the cell. The cells also have an abundance of paramylon bodies, typically used for the storage of starch, that are observed in all species. The feeding structure, not visible under light microscopy, is relatively simple consisting of a pocket-like cavity ending with a cytostome, lined with microtubules for phagocytosis.Breglia, Susana A.; Yubuki, N.; Leander, Brian S.

The movement of this flagellum is very minimal with some vibration at the tip; however, some species are observed to have vigorously, whipping flagellum that result in rapid rotation and oscillation of the cell body. These euglenoids have also been observed to glide forward using the body, while the flagellum is used to contact the substrate. The nucleus is located centrally to the left side of the cell. Life history In euglenoids, sexual reproduction is unknown; however, asexual reproduction has been observed to occur in this genus through longitudinal fission, where the division occurs very quickly, starting at the anterior end of the cell.

While the initial design for this monument was completed by the Renaissance sculptor Andrea Verrochio, the present arrangement, completed centuries later, was assembled with substantial modifications by lesser-known artists. History Bozetto of Monument by Verrochio at Victoria and Albert Museum Niccol√≤ Forteguerri (1419 ‚Äì 1473), nephew of Pope Pius II, was a legate, general and cardinal of the Roman Catholic church. Upon his death, his remains were interred with another monument in the church of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere in Rome;The recumbant effigy, a traditional medieval representation of deceased individuals, of Cardinal Forteguerri at Sant Cecilia was sculpted by Mino da Fiesole. but his posthumous patronage and endowments, which included the Biblioteca Forteguerriana and an allied school in Pistoia, prompted his town to honor his memory with a local monument. The negotiations leading to Verrochio's contract were complex. The Operai di San Jacopo or Works Commission of the Cathedral of San Jacopo in Pistoia, issued in 1473 a call for proposals for a monument from 5 sculptors, mostly based in Florence. Other than Verrochio, we do not know who the competitors for the project were, nor what their proposals depicted. It appears the proposal by Verrocchio was the initial first choice of the Operai; however, they balked at the exorbitant cost (350 ducats), since the local council had budgeted only 1100 lire. The relations of Verrochio and the Operai soon soured, and by 1477, the Operai elected to award the commisssion to another sculptor, Piero Pollaiuolo, who was then active in Pistoia, and who had quoted a cost of 380 florins. However, the Pistoiese council, established by the Florentine administration, still favored Verrochio, and this disagreement led in 1478 to arbitration by Lorenzo de Medici.Verocchio, by Maud Cruttwell; Scribner and Sons, New York (1904): Pages 125-128.The unfinished monument by Andrea del Verrocchio to the Cardinal Niccol√≤ Forteguerri at Pistoia, by Elizabeth Wilder (1932). From the archives of Pistoia, it is known the arbitration led to the reassignment of the commission to Verrocchio, but we do not have details of how such a decision was made. While some documents state that the sculptures in Verrochio's studio were nearly complete by November 1483;Verrocchio havendo in buonaparte tracto a fine la sepultura(Provvisioni dell' Arch. Comm. di Pistoja, Lib. 68 a c. 7.) cited by M Cruttwell, page 129. once Verrochio had left, more disagreements emerged about payment for transport to Pistoia, and about the quality of the work. By 1483, Verrocchio had departed from Florence to work in Venice on the prestigious commission of the bronze equestrian statue of the condottiere Colleoni. Thus back in Florence, some of the figures appear to have been completed by assistants, led by Lorenzo di Credi. Upon arrival to Pistoia in 1488, the Operai employed Lorenzetto Lotti and Giovanni Francesco Rustici to repair or alter the sculptures of Charity and the kneeling cardinal. This latter sculpture, in particular, was to have been of poor quality. Thus the tomb, as planned, remained incomplete for over two centuries, with the sculptures in the chapel embedded in a stucco background. Some have opinionated that the allegories of Faith, Hope, Charity and the figure of Christ were sculpted by Verrochio, while most of the angels were not. In 1660s, Cardinal Rospigliosi endowed the Cathedral a relic of St Bartholemew. It was initially placed in monument before Forteguerri cenotaph, but over the next century it was decided to dedicate that chapel entirely to the Saint, and displace the Forteguerri monument to first bay of left aisle. To complete the move, a poorly known Florentine sculptor, Gaetano Masoni, was hired in 1753-1754 to moved the monument. He added a late baroque marble volute frames and two crying putti. Masoni in the process trimmed some of the other sculptures. The sculptures also have been compressed into a smaller space than originally planned. The poorly carved statue of the kneeling cardinal was substituted by a bust of the cardinal, all encased around volutes with a small dark marble sarcophagus. This is not the only Forteguerri monument to suffer exile from its original positioning, the 19th-century monument of the cardinal in Piazza Santo Spirito was moved here from its former position in the Piazza del Duomo.Piazza Santo Spirito. Bozzetto of Forteguerri Monument in London The Victoria and Albert Museum in London has a small terracotta model or bozzetto that is attributed to Verrochio, perhaps the model selected in the initial competition. However, the provenance of the bozzetto is not complete, hence it is possible, that it was completed by some later artist. If the model only reflects Verocchio's work, it would be a prescient style for its time. Intended to be nearly three stories high, the Christ in a Mandorla is held aloft by four angels, while at the base, triangulating around the kneeling cardinal, are women emblematic of the three theologic virtues: Faith (on left, proffering the cross), Charity (atop, suckling an infant), and Hope (on right, gazing upward).Victoria and Albert museum, entry for bozzetto. The model has some elements whose style is archaic, while other elements are prescient of Baroque styles. For example, the benedicent Christ in the Mandorla is a typically medieval trope. The triangular arrangement of the three theologic virtues, is locked to an allegoric Renaissance vocabulary. However, the lone figure of the praying cardinal, surrounded by the animated figures, is almost baroque in its rendition, lacking the impassive rigid arrangement of much high-Renaissance sculpture.The Sculptures of Andrea Del Verrocchio, by Andrew Butterfield.Bolletino d'Arte, article on Foreteguerri monument. Prato Cathedral bas-relief (1473) There are some similarities between the bozzetto and a bas-relief (1473) for the pulpit of Prato Cathedral, depicting the Madonna della Cintola (Our Lady of the Holy Girdle of Thomas). This bas-relief was sculpted by Antonio Rossellino and Mino da Fiesole, and depicts the Virgin inside a mandorla held aloft by angels.

It was released on 30 June 2017 on CD and digital download, and on 29 September it was available on vinyl. It is Jay Aston's first studio album under the Gene Loves Jezebel name since The Thornfield Sessions in 2003.  Background  After the splitting of the original Gene Loves Jezebel, Jay Aston came close to walking away from music. His version of the band had only released the semi-acoustic The Thornfield Sessions in 2003, while his brother's, Michael, version had released three albums between 1999 and 2003. In 2010, Aston received a call asking if he wanted to sing on a Rolling Stones tribute album ‚Äì this sparked the musician's interest once again. Soon, Aston was performing solo shows and even released an album with bassist Pete Rizzo, but it would take until 2017 for the two to work on another Gene Loves Jezebel album. For Dance Underwater they enlisted Peter Walsh as producer, who also worked on Gene Loves Jezebel's House of Dolls and Heavenly Bodies albums, and one of their most popular songs, \\"Desire\\" from 1986. The album was funded through PledgeMusic, and by the end of the fundraiser, they managed to reach over 25% of the original goal. On 27 April, the first single, \\"Summertime\\", was released, and two months later, on 30 June, the album was released on CD and digital formats; vinyl would come on 29 September.  Reception  Dance Underwater received mixed reviews. New Noise Magazine felt \\"Charmed Life (Never Give In)\\" was too autotuned, but found the rest of the album to have the same \\"mix of goth, rock, and pop\\" the band is known for from the 1980s. The reviewer felt there was no desire to reinvent the music. Meanwhile, Mark Rockpit from The Rockpit found the album to be a \\"great return to form [by] evoking the moods and beats of thirty years ago.\\" He found the songs to contain \\"velvety rhythms\\", \\"orther-worldly vibes\\", and \\"beautiful honesty\\". Rockpit finished his review by stating that \\"I Don't Wanna Dance Underwater\\" is the best song on the best album he's heard all year. He applauded the band for continuing to make music with the same depth and richness as they did thirty years prior. Alfie Vera Mella from Cryptic Rock also found the album worthy of high praise, giving it five stars for its \\"sentimental ballads\\" and \\"funky grooves\\", a contrast to Dom Lawson of Classic Rock who found it all to be too \\"polished and polite\\".

According to Vasari, the work is from the Sant'Elisabetta della congrega dei Preti chapel in Florence's church of San Michele alle Trombe (a church rededicated to Elizabeth in 1517). Albertinelli collaborated with Fra Bartolomeo until 1503, when the latter took his vows as a Dominican.

The mountain is situated in Chelan County, in the Wenatchee National Forest. Its nearest higher peak is Clark Mountain, to the southwest, and Brahma Peak is set to the south. Precipitation runoff from it drains into Buck Creek, Chiwawa River, and Napeequa River, each a tributary of the Wenatchee River. The mountain's name was applied by Albert Hale Sylvester (1871-1944), a pioneer surveyor, explorer, topographer, and forest supervisor in the Cascades. Geology The North Cascades feature some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. Glacier Peak, a stratovolcano that is west of Buck Mountain, began forming in the mid-Pleistocene.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Several glaciers lie on the slopes of Buck Mountain. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. Climate Buck Mountain from the southeast Buck Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above .Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger.

They are promoting for all sections of the sports club Zrinjski, but they mostly follow its football department. They got their name in 1998, 6 years after Zrinjski's work was restored. They took the name of the fan-based Ultras Movement in European football. The official song of Ultras, fans of H≈†K Zrinjski Mostar, is \\"Gori brate\\", and they support their club from the grandstand - Stajanje. Colours used by Ultras on transparencies and boards are black, white and red. History =1992‚Äì1994= At the beginning of 1992, the work of H≈†K Zrinjski Mostar was restored in Meƒëugorje, and with its renewal, the winding in the town of Neretva slowly arouses and is organized.https://hskzrinjski.ba/povijestkluba/ As early as 1993, the idea of launching a fan group was created in the fans' minds, which would have the goal of organizing cheering at the matches of Zrinjski. In the course of that year, an idea arose, that those fiercest fans of Zrinjski are called Ultras, modeled on fan groups across Europe. =1994= In April 1994, the Initiative Committee of the Fan Club Zrinjski, Ultras, was created, which was aimed at organizing a Fan Assembly within two years. However, because of the war circumstances, what could have been done within two years wasn't done. They played for the matches, and Zrinjski played very friendly games in Imotski and ≈†iroki Brijeg. In 1994, in Mostar, the final match for the champion of the then Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia in Zrinjski was played at the stadium Zrinjski against the team Mladost Dubint from ≈†iroki Brijeg (today's NK ≈†iroki Brijeg). In quite an interesting game, fans failed to see a single goal, and the result remained 0:0. At that match, about 5,000 spectators were gathered, and there were around 300 - 400 of the most fervent ones, which were placed on the central western table of the H≈†K Zrinjski stadium. In this game, for the first time, a transparency with the Ultras label was placed. This match has remained memorable after the first organized gathering of Ultras at the matches of its beloved club. This game has written a new history of organized cheering in the city of Neretva. A year later, the Ultras are gathering in basketball matches in Zrinjski, and there are frequent departures on the visiting courts also. =1997 and 1998= In 1997, in the Croatian Lodge \\"Herceg Stjepan Kosaƒça\\", the first Assembly of the Fan Club was held in Mostar, where more than 400 members of this support group gathered. After that meeting, one of the ultras podium groups was a fan club named Zrinjevci, which was common in all games played by Zrinjski. During this period there are numerous guest appearances throughout Herzegovina, and go to Busovaƒça, Kiseljak, Vitez, Prozor-Rama, Ora≈°je and other cities where the First League of Herzeg-Bosnia was played.https://www.jabuka.tv/prije-23-godine-krenula- prva-sezona-lige-herceg-bosne-u-kojoj-je-mladost-dubint-osvojila-titulu- prvaka/ One year later, Zrinjski is trying to compete for the Euro Cups for the first time in the playoffs for the champions of Bosnia and Herzegovina (the Premier League of BiH has not yet existed, and the Croatian League and the Bosniak Clubs were playing in the playoffs at UEFA's prizes ). The nuns were in the group together with the ≈Ωeljezniƒçar and Bosnia from Visoko, and all the matches were played at the Ko≈°evo Olympic Stadium in Sarajevo. It can be rightly said that Ultras were the ones who first crossed the then war line with the fanciful features and came to Sarajevo. Approximately 10,000 spectators gathered in the Ko≈°evo Stadium, about 50 Ultras, which were more than excellent, but neither their cheering helped Zrinjska to score a victory.

It is dedicated to saint Andrew the Apostle.  History  The church was designed by architects Hippolyte Durand and Hippolyte Guichenn√© and built in the neo-Gothic style in the neighborhood between 1856 and 1869, under Napol√©on III's reign. It was built on the site of a former Jansenist high school. Its construction was mainly funded by a bequest (several donations totalling more than 5 million Francs) from banker Jacques Taurin de Lormand, who died in 1847. The town council allocated additional money for ending the works and purchasing furniture. The church was consecrated on March 7, 1862. The Capuchins' Church neighboring St Andrew's was demolished. On December 13, 1895, the vault partly collapsed on the organ lofts because the ground was swampy. The 74-meter-high spires, which were too heavy, were demolished in 1901 and replaced by the two current belfry towers in 1903.  Architecture  In the shape of a Latin cross, the church's design was inspired from the 13th-century Gothic churches with two front towers and an imposing rosette over the doors. It has three ribbed naves. The inside of the church features a painting by L√©on Bonnat (1833-1922) of Bayonne, which represents the Assumption of Mary. Another painting by Joseph Pascau (1875-1944) of Bayonne shows the Holy Family. The pipe organ was donated by Napol√©on III in 1862 and inaugurated on April 9, 1836. It was made by and Jean-Jacob G√∂tty of Bordeaux, with 32 stops and 3 manuals.

It covered an area of some west and south of the town of Knaresborough, between the River Nidd and the River Wharfe, then in the West Riding of Yorkshire and now in North Yorkshire.  Origins  The earliest surviving reference to the Forest was in 1167, during the reign of Henry II, and it was probably created in the 12th century. Its formation has been linked to Hugh de Moreville, Constable of the Castle and Liberty of Knaresborough, or to William de Stutville, Governor of Knaresborough Castle from 1177 to 1203. The Liberty of Knaresborough lay outside the Forest north of the River Nidd, and it seems that freemen of the Liberty had no rights of pasture in the Forest. The Forest was a particular favourite of Henry II and King John. Edward III settled the Honour of Knaresborough (which included the Castle and Liberty of Knaresborough as well as the Forest) on his wife Philippa. When she died in 1369, Edward granted the Honour to his son John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster. The Honour has remained in the ownership of the Duchy of Lancaster to the present day.  Administration  The Forest was not a continuous stretch of woodland, but a hunting area subject to special rules for conserving game. Its inhabitants lived in villages and hamlets surrounded by meadows and arable land. The Forest was at first divided into three \\"constabularies\\": Thruscross, which included the hamlets of Bramley, Darley, Hill, Holme, Menwith, Padside and Thornthwaite; Clint, with the five hamlets of Birstwith, Fearnhill, Felliscliffe, Hampsthwaite and Rowden; and Killinghall, with the hamlets of Beckwith, Rossett and Bilton-with-Harrogate. The hamlets later became eleven separate constabularies: Beckwith with Rossett, Bilton-with-Harrogate, Birstwith, Clifton, Clint, Felliscliffe, Hampsthwaite, Killinghall, Menwith with Darley, Thruscross and Timble. Within the forest there were two areas, Haverah Park and Bilton Park, which were fenced off as deer parks, allowing game to enter but not to escape. The remains of a hunting lodge, known as John O'Gaunt's Castle, can still be seen in Haverah Park. In 1380 John of Gaunt ordered the building of a hunting lodge in Bilton Park: the building, remodelled in the 19th century, is now known as Bilton Hall. The inhabitants of the Royal Forest were subject to a body of law which forbade hunting of deer and hunting with bows and arrows or hounds, and provided for fines for cutting down trees. They were in effect tenants of the Crown, but they had security of tenure and could transfer their rights. Provided that they did not interfere with the king's hunting, they were free to make their livings in the Forest. Economic activity included farming, milling and other industries such as mining. There are records of iron forging from 1206, but the industry declined in the 14th century because the wood which supplied the forges was used up.  Decline  By Tudor times the Forest had outlived its original purpose, and English monarchs no longer spent their time hunting. The Forest had been stripped of many of its trees, largely for the sale of timber for the iron smelting industry. A survey in 1604 found only 410 standing trees left in Haverah Park. James I was interested in sport and discouraged disafforestation, but his son Charles I did not. In 1628 Charles I sold off both Bilton Park and Haverah Park. The town of Harrogate grew within the Forest in the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1770 an Act of Enclosure divided the Forest. Some of the Forest remained in the hands of the Duchy, some was allocated to tithe owners, and an area of Harrogate was allocated as a public open space known as The Stray. The visible remains of the Forest include a large number of boundary stones erected during the last perambulation of the boundaries conducted in 1767.

An English translation by Megan McDowell was published in 2017 through Riverhead Books. The novel has elements of psychological fiction and takes inspiration from the environmental problems in Argentina.  Plot summary  Waking up disoriented in a clinic, Amanda begins a conversation with a young boy named David. He urges Amanda to try to remember what happened before she came to the clinic. Through the constant cajoling of David, Amanda recounts her memories as she attempts to piece together what happened to her. Amanda tells how she met David's mother, Carla, while staying at a rented house in the country. After a day at the lake, Carla told Amanda about her son David and how he came to be the way he is now. The story involves her husband Omar and his prized stallion. One day Carla noticed that the horse was missing. She and David went looking for the horse and found it sipping from a stream. David played in the stream, but when Carla saw that there was a dead bird nearby, she quickly got David out of the water. After a few days, the horse became severely ill and died. Carla, realizing that David might also be infected, hurriedly took David to the mysterious woman, reputed as a healer, who lived in the green house. This woman told Carla that David could be saved, but he would be forever different as his soul would be split into two portions through a process called transmigration. But it would allow him to survive. Carla agrees to save David, but after the treatment, she recognizes how he has changed and she refuses to touch him, calling him a ‚Äúmonster.‚Äù Back in the present, David urges Amanda to explain what her ‚Äúrescue distance,‚Äù is. It is Amanda's way of keeping her daughter Nina safe, by constantly calculating the maximal distance from her to assure that she can be rescued if necessary. Amanda tells of her visit into town with Nina where they encounter a little girl with a deformed leg. Amanda, pensive after this encounter, goes to the green house to ask the mysterious woman what she knows. When she gets back, Carla is there and warns her that David is in the house. Amanda, worried how his presence may affect her daughter, forces David to leave and then decides that she and Nina will leave the town as soon as possible. She has Nina pack her bag, but before leaving, decides that she needs to talk to Carla one more time. Amanda and Nina find Carla at the mayor's house, and she invites them to see the stables. They wait for Carla outside where some men are unloading a truck full of barrels, filled with an unknown substance. They wait in the grass, watching the men work. When Carla comes out, Amanda and Nina stand up and realize that they are now wet from the dew. In the present, David interrupts Amanda's story to point out that this is an important detail - they were not wet from dew, but from something else. Amanda, returning to her story, recalls how Carla revealed more about David and his recovery - it took a long time for David to start speaking again. Meanwhile, animals kept mysteriously dying around David, including a neighbor's dog. At this news, Amanda begins to feel sick and has to lie down in the field. Carla drives her to the clinic, and Nina then starts to feel sick too. At the clinic, the nurse informs them that they have just had too much sun. They are released and Carla takes them to her house where Amanda and Nina lie down for a nap together. David again interrupts to tell Amanda that they were poisoned. Amanda then recalls that she drove Nina to town to get some water. They saw a group of children cross the road who are deformed like David. Amanda got out of the car and collapsed. She is taken back to the clinic, while Nina is taken to the green house. Amanda then recounts the story through the eyes of her husband who went to see Carla's husband Omar at their house. He asks Omar about what happened to Nina. Omar does not have an answer. Omar confesses that Carla has left town. David comes into the room; Amanda's husband decides to leave, never to return.  Main characters  = Amanda = Amanda is the mother of Nina. She is protective and very concerned with her daughter's welfare, constantly calculating a \\"rescue distance\\". She lives with her husband and daughter in the capital and came to the country with Nina for a vacation. She does not know why she is in a clinic. = David = David is the son of Carla and Omar. He drank poisoned water when he was three years old and nearly died, but was saved by the woman in the green house through the process of transmigration. After recovering from his poisoning, David does not act like he used to. He no longer refers to Carla as \\"Mom\\". = Carla = Carla is the mother of David, wife of Omar. She was an accountant for a local farm. After the incident with David, she begins to describe him as a monster. She becomes a friend to Amanda and warns her to stay away from David. = Nina = Nina is Amanda's daughter. She eventually becomes poisoned like the other children. = Omar = Omar is the husband of Carla and father of David. He was once a successful racehorse breeder but lost his best horses after they were poisoned by the stream. = Woman in the Green House = She is a local woman known for her healing abilities. She uses supernatural powers to keep the poisoned kids alive. She healed both David and Nina after they were poisoned.  Cultural background  Schweblin drew inspiration for her novel from the use of harmful pesticides in farming towns throughout Argentina, which she stated causes multiple issues. Schweblin states that Argentina is a major producer of soybeans, a product related with pesticides. It is also one of the world's top producers of genetically engineered crops, mainly soybeans designed to resist pesticides. This allows for excess spraying of herbicides with no negative effects to the crops. Pesticides can have several effects on the members of farming towns in Argentina, including birth defects and other health issues. This is illustrated in the novel as many children in the town have birth defects. Pesticides, along with other agricultural runoff, can drain into water sources causing contamination. There are many communities without running water, and their water sources are contaminated by agricultural runoff containing pesticides. In some cases, old pesticide containers are even used to collect rainwater. This is seen within the novel as several characters are poisoned through local water sources.  Reception  = Critical response = Reception for Fever Dream has been predominantly positive. NPR praises the novel for its use of horror in highlighting the use of toxic agricultural chemicals calling it \\"an exceptional example of the short-and-creepy form\\". An article from The New Yorker says that the book is \\"so enigmatic and so disciplined...[that] it belongs to a new literary genre altogether\\". = Accolades = * Tigre Juan Literary Award (2015) *The Man Booker International Prize Shortlist (2017) * The Morning News Tournament of Books Winner (2018) * Shirley Jackson Award for best novella (2017)  See also  * Pesticide *Pesticide poisoning  References  2014 novels 2010s horror novels Argentine novels Psychological thriller novels ","title":"Fever Dream (Samanta Schweblin novel)"},{"id":"60496264","text":"A Hidden Life may refer to: * A Hidden Life (memoir), a memoir by Johanna Reiss * A Hidden Life (2001 film), a Brazilian drama film * A Hidden Life (2019 film), a historical drama film directed by Terrence Malick ","title":"A Hidden Life"},{"id":"60496266","text":"Detail Detail of the Massacre of the Innocents and Landscape with an Annunciation Visitation with Saint Nicholas and Saint Anthony is a c.1490 oil on panel painting by Piero di Cosimo, now in the National Gallery of Art of Washington.

Trademarked as EverCrisp, the MAIA-1 variety is a cross between two existing apple cultivars ‚Äì the Honeycrisp and Fuji. Originally produced in Ohio, EverCrisp has since expanded to apple-growing regions across the Midwest in Michigan, Illinois and Indiana, and in the Northeast in Pennsylvania and New York. The apple entered the public marketplace in 2017.  History  = EverCrisp = Mitch Lynd of Lynd Fruit Farms in Patakasla, Ohio developed MAIA-1 during 1998 and 1999. Lynd pollinated and collected the pioneer seeds, Honeycrisp and Fuji, in 1998, germinated the first seedlings in 1998-1999, and carried out much of the organisational work that enabled the seedlings to be disseminated to farmers for experimental cultivation and development. With the help of several apple- growers at Lynd's request, the MAIA-1 variety had the chance to grow and evolve in Midwestern soil. In 2007, the first tester seedlings began to fruit. The initial fruits were selected and evaluated through internal tastings. If successful, the fruit would advance to external tastings. In late-2008, David Doud of Countryline Orchards in Roann, Indiana produced an MAIA-1 apple from a test tree called MDD5-44. According to EverCrisp, Doud described MAIA-1 as the ‚Äúapple with the 21st century crunch‚Äù and thought ‚Äúit was better than any other apple he was growing‚Äù MAIA-1, soon to be trademarked as EverCrisp, was the first fruit variety released by the MAIA. After almost 20 years of development, EverCrisp became publicly available for purchase and consumption in late-October 2017. According to the EverCrisp Apple website, EverCrisp is available from orchards across the Midwest and Northeast, grocery stores such as Lunds & Byerlys and Heinen's Fine Foods, and markets such as Greenmarket Framers Market in New York and Kissel Hill Fruit Farm & Market in Pennsylvania. As of October 2018, EverCrisp is grown in 350 orchards across 32 states. The MAIA estimates they have planted more than 600,000 EverCrisp trees across the United States since the apple's development. EverCrisp is considered a ‚Äúclub apple‚Äù variety. This means that apple growers who want to breed, harvest, and sell EverCrisp are required to purchase a membership and license. According to Good Fruit Grower magazine, EverCrisp growers need to purchase a US$100 per year membership, a royalty fee of $1 per tree, trademark and logo fees of 20 cents per tree for four to ten years, and 30 cents per tree for eleven to twenty years. Bill Dodd, the president of the MAIA, released a statement on the MAIA's website in 2014 assuring that ‚Äúno one will be excluded‚Äù from buying into the EverCrisp club. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to limit who has access,‚Äù Dodd said. = Midwest Apple Improvement Association (MAIA) = The Midwest Apple Improvement Association (MAIA) is an organisation founded by apple-growers Mitch Lynd and Ed Fackler in the mid-1990s. Although the MAIA is an independent organisation, it is advised by Dr. Diane Miller at Ohio State University. According to The MAIA, the organisation grew out of a need for apple cultivars that were both suited to the climate and harvesting challenges of the Midwest. The MAIA's membership were looking for a later and longer-harvesting-period fruit than the Honeycrisp, suitable for growing in the central and southern Midwest. Approximately 50 apple-growers in the Midwestern region pledged to commit US$100 per year for 15 years toward crossbreeding and growing new apple varieties on their independent orchards. During MAIA's first breeding year, beginning in the spring of 1997, 5300 seedlings were developed and grown through crossbreeding existing apple cultivars as GoldRush, Sweet Sixteen, Crimson Crisp, HoneyCrisp, Fuji, and Golden Delicious. The MAIA estimates over 50,000 seedlings have been distributed to MAIA members since the organisations inception over two decades ago. On the back of EverCrisp's success, the MAIA released two new apple varieties in early-2017, ‚ÄòCrunch-A-Bunch‚Äô and ‚ÄòBakers Delight‚Äô. According to Growing Produce magazine, the new cultivars formally known as MAIA-11 and MAIA-12 were designed not only for commercial growers but for apple hobbyists and ‚Äúbackyard growers‚Äù too. The varieties are sold and distributed exclusively by Gurney's Seed and Nursery Company, mail delivering the new MAIA seeds to home apple-growers throughout the US, and through Early Morning and Wafler Nurseries for commercial orchardists. According to Growing Produce, both varieties offer unique flavour profiles and disease, browning and pest resistance. In 2018 Bill Dodd, president of the MAIA, estimated that 70,000 to 80,000 bushels (a bushel holds approximately 125 medium apples) were to come from the 700,000 apple-trees MAIA have planted since the organisations inception. According to OZY magazine, Dodd predicts that one million apple trees will have been planted under the MAIA by 2020. ‚ÄúOne of our goals for our breeding program is to have a full season of varieties,‚Äù Dodd stated in an interview with Growing Produce magazine in late-2017. According to OZY, these new trademarked apple varieties, ‚ÄòSummerset‚Äô, ‚ÄòRosalee‚Äô, ‚ÄòSweet Zinger‚Äô and ‚ÄòLudacrisp‚Äô, are set to be released by 2021. In the next two to three years, the MAIA expect to have early, midseason, and late-season apple varieties available to the public through orchards, nurseries, independent groceries, and grocery-chains. As of early-2018, the MAIA had more than 450 members worldwide. By 2019, MAIA reported that it had 700 members. = Designer Fruit = Designer apple variety WA 38, trademarked as alt= In an article titled ‚ÄòNew Wave Varieties Upset the Apple Cart‚Äô, OZY magazine reported in December 2018 that ‚ÄúEverCrisp is among a slew of new commercial [apple] varieties,‚Äù that are not only ‚Äújuicy, crunchy and flavourful, [but] can be stored longer and have a higher disease resistance‚Äù. EverCrisp is firmly within what has been referred to by Quartzy magazine as the ‚Äúdesigner fruit era\\". Among other successful designer apples as Cosmic Crisp, SweeTango and Zestar, EverCrisp is part of a new generation of apple cultivars that are ‚Äúmore delicious, beautiful, convenient for eaters and more productive for growers,\\" According to OZY, consumer demand for better quality produce and a wider variety of cultivars are the central forces driving the expanding market of designer apples in the U.S. According to Vox, apple breeders are certainly listening. Organisations such as the MAIA are working hard to meet consumer demand by releasing new apples, each with their own nuances. Vox reports that there's an apple for everyone; some look better than others, some are anti-browning, some are crunchier, warmer, cooler, sweeter or more tart. According to Quartzy, this wave of new designer cultivars have the potential to trump old favourites such as Red Delicious, Granny Smith, McIntosh and Honeycrisp.OZY too is aware of this trend, reporting that if institutions such as the MAIA and Washington State University continue to release new apple varieties and the steady rate of apple consumption in the U.S. endures, older apple varieties will eventually be displaced. Beyond the apple itself, marketing has been an important factor in the success of club apples such as EverCrisp and Cosmic Crisp. According to The Packer magazine, Rena Montedoro, vice president of sales and marketing for Crunch Time Apple Growers, said, ‚Äúthe names of apples influence the consumer. They speak to each apple,\\" EverCrisp is marketed as the apple whose \\"name says it all\\". The EverCrisp Apple website claims that EverCrisp is a \\"durable apple [that] maintains sweetness and firmness like no other.\\" Although marketing campaigns for independent patented fruit varieties are a relatively new phenomenon, trademarked apple cultivars such as Cosmic Crisp are already experiencing success. According to Seattle magazine, Cosmic Crisp's marketing campaign is heavily focused on consumer research. Through think taste tests and focus groups, Cosmic Crisp has been able to generate significant \\"buzz\\" before it has even hit the shelf. According to a Quartzy article in late-2017, Washington State has planted more than 12 million Cosmic Crisp trees in preparation for its debut.  Cultivation  Trademarked apple SweeTango being harvested. (2010)EverCrisp is a late-season apple, ripening in mid-October and harvested in October to November depending on the region. On David Doud's orchard in north-central Indiana, EverCrisp is ripe between October 10 to October 15. Doud states that EverCrisp can be harvested with no complications for three weekends in October. In northern Indiana, EverCrisp has exhibited watercore if left to hang on the tree till November. Co-founder of the MAIA Mitch Lynd says that EverCrisp is \\"more grower friendly,\\" than the Fuji apple. Unlike Fuji, a variety that typically produces more trees than fruit, EverCrisp produces more apples than trees.  Appearance and Flavour  According to EverCrisp Apple, the MAIA-1 variety is sweet, crisp, firm and dense just like its parent cultivar Honeycrisp. Director for floral and produce at Tops Friendly Markets, Jeff Cady, describes EverCrisp to have a strong HoneyCrisp flavour with a distinct Fuji-like tang. A panel of taste- testers at Bloomberg said EverCrisp had an \\"in-your-face candied-apple sweetness, with a background tang and monstrous crunch.\\" EverCrisp describes the appearance of their MAIA-1 variety as a \\"blushed rosey red over a cream background.\\" Growing Produce notes that while EverCrisp has a texture similar to Honeycrisp, its external shape and appearance most resembles the Fuji apple. The MAIA states EverCrisp has a \\"slightly harder\\" exterior than Honeycrisp. In a press release from EverCrisp Apple, Dave Rennhack of Rannhack Orchards Market testified to EverCrisp's capacity to store well. ‚ÄúThe apple eats even better after two or three months in the cooler,\\" said Dave. \\"The flavour mellows out a bit and the coloration turns from an underlying green cast to pineapple gold, making the apple very appealing.‚Äù Bill Dodd, president of the MAIA, said EverCrisp has the storability of Fuji with the lasting crunch of Honeycrisp. \\"EverCrisp can last on the counter for two weeks where the Honeycrisp will start losing quality,\\" said Dodd.  Reception  According to U.S. media sources, EverCrisp has been largely well-received by apple orchardists in the Midwest. In an interview with Good Fruit Grower magazine, Bear Mountain Orchards owner John Lott expressed his opinion regarding the MAIA's management of EverCrisp. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs being marketed as a variety by growers at every level,‚Äù Lott said, ‚Äú[It's] not branded in a box like most club varieties.‚Äù Bruce Hollabaugh, wholesale apple distributor in Pennsylvania, commends the MAIA's approach to managing EverCrisp as an inclusive club apple. \\"It's refreshing to see guys like us, a grassroots organisation of growers, that's trying to make apples better for the right reasons.\\" In late-2018, Brain Garwood of Garwood Orchards said ‚ÄúEverCrisp is a great apple for us as it continues to bring people to the orchard,\\" Promoters say EverCrisp is enjoying a rapid increase in activity among fruit farmers, partly because the fruit is said to lack the problems of thin skin and tree disease susceptibility that are alleged to plague the popular Honeycrisp parent. According to U.S. media sources, this positive sentiment has followed through with independent and wholesale distributors. In an interview with The Produce News in March 2019, Ward Dobbins of United Apple Sales said EverCrisp's quality has gotten \\"even stronger as [the] trees mature.\\" Dobbins says this has enabled him to \\"work closely with retail partners in providing supply assurance to give them a true apple advantage late in the season.\\" Vinnie Latessa, director of produce for Heinen's Grocery Store, says that \\"EverCrisp is rivaling sales of Honeycrisp [and is] a close second in our lineup of apples from a sales and volume standpoint.\\" Scott Swindeman, co- owner of Applewood Orchards in Michigan, said that his supply of fruit from EverCrisp trees has increased by approximately 25 percent since his harvest in 2017. According to a consumer study conducted in November 2010 by Diane Miller, tree fruit Extension specialist at Ohio State University, EverCrisp \\"rated higher than Fuji and Cameo and was equivalent to Honeycrisp and SweeTango.\\" The MAIA is optimistic that \\"once people try EverCrisp, they will come back for more.\\"  References  Apple cultivars Ohio State University ","title":"EverCrisp"},{"id":"60496310","title":"Rise to the Occasion (song)"},{"id":"60496347","text":"Psalm 150 (French: Psaume 150) is a psalm setting by C√©sar Franck. He wrote the composition, setting Psalm 150 for four-part choir, orchestra and organ, in 1883. It was published in 1896 by Breitkopf & H√§rtel. Carus-Verlag published an arrangement for choir, strings and organ. The incipit in French is \\"Halleluiah! Louez le Dieu, cach√© dans ses saints tabernacles\\".  History  Psalm 150, the final psalm of the Book of Psalms, calls to praise God in music, listing nine types of instruments. It is also called \\"the musicians' psalm\\". It has inspired composers such as Anton Bruckner, Igor Stravinsky, and Benjamin Britten. Franck was born in Li√®ge but worked in Paris as an organist of various churches, in the end at the Cavaill√©-Coll organ of Sainte-Clotilde, where he served from 1858 until his death. He was a professor of organ at the Conservatoire de Paris from 1872. He composed church music from motets to oratorios. His most popular work was a setting of the hymn Panis angelicus from 1872. In 1883, he set Psalm 150 in French, \\"Halleluiah! Louez le Dieu, cach√© dans ses saints tabernacles\\", for choir, orchestra and organ, on a commission by the Institut National des Jeunes Aveugles, an institution for young blind people, for the inauguration of its organ. The composition was published in 1896 by Breitkopf & H√§rtel, after the composer's death. Carus- Verlag published an arrangement for choir, strings and organ. Carus-Verlag published a version for choir, strings and organ, with optional harp and percussion, in 1976 in order to retain the work's sonority but make it accessible for smaller groups, especially church choirs in the liturgy. Carus also published an organ version, with text in French, German and Latin.  Music  Franck's psalm setting is one of his late works, in symphonic writing, with bold harmonies and chromatism, and an unusual form. The composition in one movement is set in D major in common time and marked Poco allegretto ma maestoso. Franck used the orchestra like extended organ stops. The tonality often shifts between major and minor. The choral writing is simple compared to the instrumental lines. The duration is given as five minutes. The composition begins with a long instrumental introduction, very soft and in long notes, with D sounding throughout. The bass voices enter softly in measure 26, with the word \\"Halleluiah\\", also on D, imitated by the altos a measure later, while the accompaniment turns to steady quarter notes. After four measures of more melodious instrumental lines in dotted rhythm, tenors and sopranos imitate the sequence, now on A and stronger. In a third imitation, all voices sing \\"Halleluiah\\" several times on D, again stronger. After the long building, the basses alone begin in measure 45 to sing the first two verses of the psalm with a chorale-like melody. The text of the following two verses, mentioning the instruments, is rendered from measure 61 by all voices in imitation, and more lively in both voices and accompaniment, ending in homophony in measure 75. The motifs of the melodious interlude are picked up by the voices, beginning with the tenors, then with added sopranos, finally all four, to express the fifth and sixth psalm verses, about everything breathing praise the Lord. A very loud climax is reached in measure 96. A measure later, the text of verses 1 and 2 returns with the melody, now sung by all in unison. The text and music of verses 3 and 4 are also repeated and lead to several forceful repetitions of \\"Halleluiah\\".  Recordings  In 1996, an organ version of Franck's Psalm 150 was included in a recording Most Sacred Banquet by the St. Thomas Choir of Men and Boys at Saint Thomas Church in Manhattan, conducted by Gerre Hancock, who also performed sacred music such as Durufl√©'s Quatre Motets sur des th√®mes gr√©goriens. It was part of a 1998 album of Festive Christmas Music, performed by the Knabenkantorei Basel conducted by Beat Raaflaub, which also contains carols and other psalm settings.

It was probably built at the beginning of the third century BC. Description The tomb consists of two vaulted chambers: an antechamber and a burial chamber and a disproportionately large monumental facade. The structure was covered by an earthen tumulus, which was 1.5 m high and had a diameter of about 10 m; it was removed during excavation. =Facade= The facade is 8.68 m wide and 8.6 m high. It once had a triangular pediment with a tympanum containing relief decoration, but this is almost entirely lost as a result of severe damage suffered by the facade in antiquity. Below this, there is an upper story with six Ionic columns in antis, which are 1.46 m high. In between these columns are seven 'false windows'. The upper part of most of these has also been lost. Below the columns, is a relief frieze depicting a battle of horsemen & infantry, who are probably Macedonians and Persians. The figures are made from lime mortar, their armour and clothes are painted, and the background is dark blue. Below this, there is a cornice with floral designs on a dark blue background and an entablature made up of dark blue triglyphs and metopes with a centauromachy. The lower half of the facade consists of four Doric columns in antis. The doorway to the antechamber is in the central intercolumniation. The tomb is best-known for the four paintings in the lower half of the facade. These are located in the upper part of the spaces between the Doric columns. In the outer left space, there is a warrior, depicted frontally, looking slightly to the right. His left hand rests on the sheath of his sword, while his right hand holds a spear point down. He wears a short red chiton with a white cuirass over the top, a yellow chlamys over the right shoulder, and high yellow boots. In the inner left space there is Hermes Psychopompus, who lead the spirits of the dead down to the underworld. He is depicted frontally, moving to right, with his head turned to the left. His right arm is stretched out as if beckoning to the warrior and his left hand holds the caduceus, but he does not wear the petasus or winged sandles. He wears a dark red chiton, a pale blue chlamys with purple edges, and tall yellow boots. In the spaces to the right of the door, are Aeacus and Rhadamanthys, two of the three judges of the dead, each identified by an inscription above them ( and ). Aeacus is shown on the inner right intercolumniation, in profile, seated on a cubic chair and looking to the left. His left hand is raised over his head and holds a long rod; his right hand is on his thigh. He wears a brown himation, which covers his entire body except for one shoulder and his upper chest. There is a ribbon and a wreath in his hair. His beard is rather wild. Rhadamanthys in the outer right intercolumiation is also depicted as an old man, with a wild beard and a wreath, but he is shown standing, in three-quarter view, resting on his staff. His himation is paler than Aeacus'. If the warrior is interpreted as a depiction of the tomb's occupant, then the series of images depicts the deceased being led down to judgement in Hades. This is the source of the tomb's usual name. =Interior= The interior of the structure is made up of two separate barrel-vaulted structures. The antechamber is unusually large: 6.5 m wide, 2.12 m long and 7.7 m high. This is because it is built to match the monumental scale of the facade. The chamber seems to have been unpainted, but it was severely damaged in antiquity and has not been fully excavated. The burial chamber is also barrel-vaulted, but is much smaller, measuring 4.8 m wide, 4.72 m long, and 5.26 m high. The walls are covered in stucco. A white podium with a cornice runs around the base of the wall, supporting white stucco pilasters in low relief, which themselves support an architrave, topped by a cornice. The wall between the pilasters is painted red, and the faux architectural members are decorated with painted rosettes. The design recalls wall painting in houses from the same period that have been excavated in Pella and Delos. The grave goods included a wooden couch with ivory elements, most notably a small sculpture of a woman, which was found in the antechamber. Excavation The tomb was discovered during road construction in 1954 and excavated by from 1954 to 1964. In 1998, it was re-excavated and restored by Liana Stefani. Finds from this excavation are stored in the Archaeological Museum of Veroia. The tomb is protected by a modern structure.

It is part of the collection of the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra. Subject The painting depicts Gwendoline ‚ÄòDee‚Äô Ryrie, the \\"squatter's daughter\\" wearing a white shirt and jodhpurs standing by her horse in her family's farming property at Michelago, in New South Wales, Australia. Lambert had met Ryrie's father Major General Sir Granville Ryrie during World War I in Palestine while working as an official war artist. The horse itself was a gift to Gwendoline from Lambert. Composition In this painting Lambert set out to take a more formal approach to the Australian landscape, looking to reduce the landscape to definite forms. Lambert described his portrayal of Ryrie as \\"like a figure on a Greek vase\\" passing \\"gracefully across the foreground\\". Provenance Lambert sold the painting in 1926 to Englishman George Pitt-Rivers. The painting was acquired by the National Gallery of Australia in 1991 with the assistance of James Fairfax and Philip Bacon and the people of Australia. Reception The first exhibition of The Squatter's Daughter \\"created a stir\\" with its formalist approach to the Australian landscape. Howard Ashton was critical of the painting claiming that it lacked emotion. Another critic commented: \\"The Lambert landscape, The Squatter‚Äôs Daughter, will be of unique interest ‚Ä¶ as representing a direct break with the Streeton convention\\" while Hans Heysen remarked that the painting was \\"different from anything else painted in Australia\\" and later that it was \\"an object lesson for the young landscape painters of Australia\\".

Early history The College initially took the form of a beit midrash attended by elderly men of learning who studied the Talmud there, under the directorship Dr. Louis L√∂we. The Spanish and Portuguese Jews' Congregation in London assumed the administration of the College after Montefiore's death in 1885, and the College languished after the death of L√∂we in 1888. After Moses Gaster was appointed principal in 1890, the College was re-organized into a modern rabbinical training college. The former members of the institution were dismissed, and students between the age of 16 and 21 with a B.A. or comparable university degree were invited to move into the College for a period of five years to become academically trained rabbis. The College ordained its first two students, William Henry Greenburg and Henry Barnstein, on 4 November 1895, to much controversy. Judith Lady Montefiore College was moved to London in 1961 (its building demolished in 1964), and closed in 1985. The site of the college is now owned by Ramsgate Town Council and maintained by volunteers as a dedicated woodland. Re-establishment The College was re-opened in London in 2005 as a centre for higher Torah education. Its semikhah (ordination) programme was opened in January 2006 on the premises of and in co-operation with the Bevis Marks Synagogue. The programme is accepted by the Rabbinical Council of America, and is now operated in collaboration with the Israel-based Kollel Eretz Hemda. Since November 2016, Montefiore has offered a program for dayanim (rabbinic judges), also in collaboration with Eretz Hemda.

The mountain is situated in Chelan County, on land managed by Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. Its nearest higher neighbor is Kololo Peaks, to the north. Indian Head Peak is the second-highest point on Wenatchee Ridge, a subrange which also includes Mount Saul, Whittier Peak, and Mount David. Precipitation runoff from it drains into Indian Creek and White River, tributaries of the Wenatchee River. The mountain's name was applied by Albert Hale Sylvester (1871-1944), a pioneer surveyor, explorer, topographer, and forest supervisor in the Cascades. Geology The North Cascades feature some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. Indian Head Peak showing the north aspect with small remaining glacier The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. Glacier Peak, a stratovolcano that is north of Indian Head Peak, began forming in the mid-Pleistocene.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Due to Glacier Peak's proximity to Indian Head Peak, volcanic ash is common in the area. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. Climate Indian Head Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak.

However, this genus does impose taxonomic problems due to the varying historical descriptions of Heteronema species and its similarity to the genus Paranema. The species H. exaratum, was the first heteronemid with a skidding motion to be sequenced, which led to the discovery that it was not closely related to H. scaphrum, contrary to what was previously assumed, but instead to a sister group of primary osmotrophs. This suggests that skidding heteronemids can also be distinguished phylogenetically, being more closely related to Anisoma, Dinema and Aphageae, than to other species within Heteronema. Taxonomy This genus was first described by F√©lix Dujardin, a French zoologist in 1841 as having variable shape, then typified in 1970 by Bourelly as an Anisonema.Dujardin, F.

There was difficulty separating this genus from Paranema; however, in 1967 Leedale described Parenema to be different based on a more flattened morphology and a trailing flagellum pressed to the side of the cell compared to Heteronema.

Individuals are assigned to this genus if they have characteristic such as an ingestion apparatus, a capacity for flagellar movement and a recurrent flagellum that is not adpressed to the ventral side of the cell.Breglia, Susana A.; Yubuki, Naoji; Leander, Brian S. (2013). ‚ÄúUltrastructure and Molecular Phylogenetic Position of Heteronema scaphrum: A Eukaryovorous Euglenid with a Cytoproct‚Äù. Journal of Eukaryotic Microbiology. 2: 107-120. doi: 10.1111/jeu.12014 The cells are covered with a large number of proteinaceous pellicle strips with microtubules lined underneath. These pellicle strips are a distinguishing feature of the euglenoids, that allows the cells to undergo metaboly, giving the cell flexibility and movement. Heteronema, under the light microscope, is morphologically similar to Paranema, where both groups are metabolic, have the ability to glide, have visible feedings rods and two different flagellum on opposite ends of the cell. Heteronema is separated into two specific morphogroups, one consisting of elongate and very flexible cells that move by gliding, holding the anterior flagellum out in front of the cell. This morphogroup includes the species H. scaphrum. In contrast, the second group consists of ovoid, more rigid cells that have a characteristic rapid ‚Äúskidding‚Äù swimming behaviour. Examples of species within this group are H. ovale and H. exaratum. The skidding behaviour is very similar to the primary osmotrophs, where the motion is powered by the beating of the anterior flagellum, positioned in a curve to the right of the cell, in a sinusoidal pattern.Larsen, Jacob; Patterson, David J. (1990). ‚ÄúSome flagellates (Protista) from tropical marine sediments‚Äù. Journal of Natural History. 24 (4): 801-937. doi:10.1080/00222939000770571 This may also reflect the evolution of ancestral phagotrophic euglenoids, where almost all species swam poorly and relied on gliding instead of flagellar movement. The flagella are hollow with heteromorphic paraxonemal rods, covered with sheaths of hairs. In accordance to its name, the anterior emergent flagella is longer and thicker, directed anteriorly and used for locomotion, and the shorter, thinner flagellum is directed posteriorly. The feeding apparatus is usually quite small, composed of separate microtubule rods and surrounded by spiral striations at the anterior end of the cell.Schroeckh, Sabrina; Lee Won J.; Patterson, David J. (2006). ‚ÄúFree-living heterotrophic euglenids from freshwater sites in mainland Australia‚Äù. Hydrobiologia. 493:1-3. doi: 10.1023/A:1025457801420 Habitat and ecology Heteronema is generally widespread and commonly found in brackish pools and fresh water ponds; however, some species are observed to exist in marine environments. These euglenoids are phagotrophic, making them important in benthic systems and microbial food webs. Life history There is no sexual reproduction observed in the euglenoids; however, asexual reproduction can occur through mitosis followed by cytokinesis, where basal bodies and flagellar systems replicate first, followed by the feeding system.

These data sources include observations networks, such as the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), the National Phenology Network (NPN), and the Pan-European Phenology Database (PEP725), remote sensing, herbarium specimens, and citizen science observations. The initial focus during ontology development was to capture phenological data about one plant or a population of plants as observed by a person, and this enabled integration of data across disparate observation network sources. Because phenological scorings vary in their methods and reporting, this allows these data to be aggregated and compared. Changes in plant phenology can be linked to different climate factors depending on the species, such precipitation or growing degree days. Aggregated data about the timing of plant life cycle stages at different places and times can provide information about spatiotemporal patterns within and among species, and potentially offer insight into how plants may change or shift their life cycles in response to climate change. These shifts can have implications for agriculture and various biodiversity research avenues, such as shifts in pollinator and host life cycles.  General structure  The structure of the Plant Phenology Ontology relies on integrated terms from other ontologies, notably the Basic Formal Ontology, the Plant Ontology, the Information Artifact Ontology, and the Biological Collections Ontology. The basic structure of the PPO models the 'observing process' (BCO:0000003), which has an input of a 'whole plant' (PO:0000003) and an output of a 'measurement datum' (IAO:0000109). The value of the 'measurement datum' is determined by what was observed or not observed on the plant. Measurement data in the PPO are numbers of upper counts and lower counts for some 'plant structure' (PO:0009011) on the observed plant. When the upper and lower counts both equal zero, an absence is inferred for that trait by the ontology using the HermiT reasoner. Plant Ontology anatomy terms were used to enable the ontology to infer the presence or absence of hierarchical phenological traits using the reasoner. For example, if pollen- releasing flower heads are observed to be present (PPO:0002340) with an upper count of five and lower count of five (meaning there are exactly five pollen- releasing flower heads on the observed plant), the reasoned ontology can also infer that floral structures are present (PPO:0002026) on the plant.  Recent developments  Because most observation networks were only established in the early 2000s, they contain a wealth of plant phenological data for the 21st century, but do not offer insight into historical baselines. Herbarium specimens inherently capture the phenological traits of a plant in a specific location at a specific time. Because some herbarium collections date back to the 17th century, herbarium specimens represent an enormous amount of historical phenology data. These data would enable researchers to address new questions about how much the current climate has shifted from historical baselines. Efforts have been made to expand the scope of the ontology to include observations made on herbarium specimens. Because the backbone of the existing PPO is built around the concept of whole plants, new logic had to be added to enable reasoning over data from parts of plants, because this is usually, though not always, what is captured by an herbarium specimen. The concept of 'portion of a plant' was added to the ontology, and a new relationship 'is or was part of' was added to describe how a 'portion of a plant' relates to a 'whole plant'. The new PPO release allows integration of phenology data from herbarium specimens, provided that observations or phenological scorings for the specimens already exist.  Global Plant Phenology Data Portal  The Global Plant Phenology Data Portal is an interface that allows users to see data that have been ingested by the PPO. It provides a way for those unfamiliar with the ontology to search for and download plant phenology data of interest. It has also served as a proof of concept during ontology development, and as a means of checking these data.

The Royal Roads Military College Band was the College military marching band for the Royal Roads Military College in Hatley Park, near Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. It was formed in 1975 after the College was 35 years old. History In 1955, the then 15 year old RRMC had a drum and bugle corps. During its existence it had performed at limited occasions, slowly evolving from a purely percussionist group. Twenty years later, a full brass and reed band was formed. By the end of the bugle band's existence, it was mostly composed of cadets from No.3 Squadron. Warrant Officer George Dunn became the college's first full-time Bandmaster, serving from 1975 to 1979. During his tenure, he obtained the equipment needed to create a Pipe Band which was attached to the brass and reed band. The band was authorized to form a 15 member voluntary Pipe Band (consisting of 10 Pipers and 5 Drummers) on 12 January 1978. The Ex-Cadet Club provided the kilts that same year and gave the band feather bonnets in 1980.PO1 T.R. Vickery POl, Bandmaster, \\"Royal Roads Military College Pipe and Drum Band\\" in ‚ÄúPipe Bands in British Columbia.‚Äù (British Columbia, 1990) The band was part of the welcoming honors for the Royal Visit of Queen Elizabeth II to the province in 1983, with the then bandmaster composing a slow march titled Dunsmuir Castle, arranged for the massed bands of the RRMC. It was named after coal magnate James Dunsmuir. Since the MacKenzie tartan was initially adopted by Royal Military College of Canada (the senior military college), it became the tartan for all military college pipe bands including the one at RRMC. In 1990, a request to the National Defence Headquarters in Ottawa to adopt the Clan Murray tartan, was endorsed and was unveiled a year later in time for the graduation parade. Repertoire The bands performed traditional military, pop, modern and highland music, as well as a few jazz and contemporary numbers. The repertoire of the band followed the following formula: *RRMC Marches **Quick: \\"Hatley Park\\" **Slow: \\"Royal Roads Slow (Going Home)\\" **\\"The Standard of St. George\\" (the former unofficial march) *\\"March of the Peers (played in honour of academic staff of the Canadian Defence AcademyRegimental Marches ) *Tri-Service March Past **\\"Heart of Oak\\" (Maritime Command) **\\"Celer Paratus Callidus\\" (Land Force Command) **\\"RCAF March Past\\" (Air Command) *\\"The Maple Leaf Forever\\" (For the marching of the colours at RRMC parades) *\\"Pathfinders\\" (During the precision drill display at the annual Sunset Ceremony) *\\"The British Grenadiers\\" (for Advance and Review Orders) *Traditional pipes and drums tunes **\\"Scotland the Brave/We're no Awa Te Bide Awa\\" **\\"Green Hills of Tyrol\\" **\\"The Skye Boat Song\\" **\\"Flower of Scotland\\" **\\"The Barren Rocks of Aden/Mary's Wedding\\" *\\"The Globe and Laurel\\" (To honour the Royal Marines) =Original Compositions= *Dunsmuir Castle *March Colonel George Logan - Composed by Cadet Pipe Major Daniel V.

The Pipe Section and the Drum Section also performed at mess dinners; parades; sporting events; ceremonies (official or squadron); funerals; wing events; Christmas and Graduation Balls; private events; and holidays. The 50th anniversary year of the RRMC in 1990 was one of the busiest years for the band in terms of the number of activities the band did.

It was translated into English by Tess Lewis in 2017. The story follows an anxious, depressed woman named Christine as she works through emotional turmoil following the end of her relationship with her lover and first lesbian partner Marie-Christine. Christine conveys her thoughts in a very disconnected manner as she discusses with readers the complicated relationships with her ex-lover, her ex-husband, her young daughter, and her father, who instigated an incestuous relationship with Christine when she was a teenager.  Plot summary  The novel begins shortly after the end of Christine and Marie- Christine's three-month long sapphic affair. In the first and longest section of the book, entitled \\"No Man's Land,\\" Christine reacts to the demise of her relationship with Marie-Christine and examines the other relationships in her life, including her relationship with her daughter L√©onore and her ex-husband Claude. The next section entitled \\"Christmas\\" is divided into several subsections. It begins by detailing the events that occurred between December 25th and 27th, ending with a physical altercation between Christine and Marie- Christine and their separation. Christine then defines several words she identifies with, including incest, mental illness, paranoia, narcissism, homosexuality, subject, suicide, perversion, sadomasochism, nazism, hysteria, desire, and schizophrenia, respectively. She follows these definitions with examples of how these words apply to her life, and descriptions of her interactions with other individuals in her life in an effort to understand these words and how they apply to her specifically, as well as flashbacks to her and Marie-Christine's relationship in early December. This section ends with Christine describing a trip to the cinema that she took with her daughter, L√©onore. In the final and shortest section of the novel, \\"Valda Candy\\", Christine describes in detail her incestuous relationship with her father, beginning when she was 14 and ending when she was 16. She then describes her relationship with 30-year-old Marc, a friend of her mother's, that began shortly after the end of her physical relationship with her father. Christine's focus then shifts back to her relationship with her father. Christine ends the novel by revealing that at age 26, she had resumed the incestuous relationship with her father.  Character list  * Christine ** The narrator of the novel. * Marie-Christine ** Christine's former lover. *Nadine ** A mutual friend of Christine and Marie-Christine. *L√©onore ** Christine and Claude's 6-year-old daughter. * Claude ** L√©onore's father and Christine's ex-husband. * Pierre ** Christine's father and the instigator of the past incestuous relationship. * Marc ** Christine's 30 year old lover whom she was with at age 16. ***  Themes  = Power dynamics = Angot often describes in her novels the incestuous relationship she had with her father, beginning when she was a teenager and lasting into her late twenties. This relationship exists in many conflicting circumstances, such as \\"domination and compliance, coercion and consensuality, fascination and fear, and abuse and mutual pleasure.\\" Angot uses her position as an author to bring an intimate topic not often discussed, incest, into the public sphere. The public arena that Angot targets both suppresses and exhibits the private relationship Christine was involved in. By creating this contradictory environment in her novels, Angot seeks to create a metaphor for power dynamics in many facets of society.  Writing style  Angot writes using short, fragmented sentences in her writing to create an environment of unreliability. By using contradictory phrases and unresolved paths of thought, Angot replicates the thoughts of a superficially conscious individual, and expects the readers to piece together the disconnected thoughts. Angot also uses a style of writing known as autofiction, where the author and the protagonist share the same name and occasionally the same experiences. Angot has repeatedly described how her writing echoes her life, but she also has described the character Christine as her own entity whose identity shifts within the various novels she is featured in. Angot insists that you must be yourself when writing, but also allows her character to have its own freedom to shape its identity within the circumstances of its novel.  Translation  Incest, the English translation of L'inceste, was published in 2017 by Tess Lewis. Lewis follows Angot's writing style closely, and precisely emulates the short, at times incoherent, sentences and phrases Angot uses in her writing. Lewis' translation was nominated for the Best Translated Book Award in 2018.  Critical reception  Angot received criticism for the close resemblance between her characters and those related to her , creating a debate regarding the role of fiction in regards to public action, as well as the responsibility of an author to control the implications created by their works. Angot was sued in 2013 by Elise Bidoit for defamation of her character in Angot's novel Les Petits, and Bidoit won the lawsuit. = Awards = Incest was a finalist for the 2018 Albertine Prize, and was also nominated for the Best Translated Book Award in 2018 at the Best Translated Book Awards (BTBAs).

At , she is the largest ship commissioned for and to ever operate for Costa, and is the fifth-largest cruise ship in the world, . Costa Smeralda is also the second cruise ship in the world to be fully powered by liquefied natural gas (LNG), making Costa the second cruise line to operate a ship running on LNG, after sister brand, AIDA Cruises, became the first in 2018. Costa Smeralda is set to have a sister ship, , that is scheduled for delivery in 2021. Her inaugural cruise sailed on 21 December 2019.  Design and description  As a liquefied natural gas (LNG)-powered vessel, Costa Smeralda is powered by duel-fuel hybrid engines and receives all of its onboard and navigational power from LNG. Costa Smeralda derives its design and technical template from the original prototype of the Helios class, which would later come to form AIDAnova.

The system gives the vessel a service speed of .  Construction and career  = Planning and construction = On 15 June 2015, Carnival Corporation announced an order for four 180,000 gross-ton cruise ships powered by liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Meyer Turku in Turku, Finland, with one of the ships eventually being built for Costa. On 13 September 2017, Costa announced the name of its first LNG-powered vessel as Costa Smeralda, after the Costa Smeralda (\\"Emerald coast\\") in Sardinia, at the ship's steel-cutting ceremony at Meyer Turku's shipyard. 4 July 2018 marked the beginning of the ship's hull assembly with the keel laying and coin ceremonies. She was floated out from the shipyard on 15 March 2019. The ship began a round of sea trials on 7 October 2019. A separate round of sea trials began on 16 November 2019 and was successfully completed shortly thereafter. Meyer Turku constructed the ship with the help from sister yard, Neptun Werft, in supplying a section containing the ship's main and auxiliary machinery and related systems. = Delivery and christening = Costa Smeraldas delivery was marred by extensive construction delays that postponed her debut by two months and caused Costa to scrap initial inaugural festivities, including her maiden voyage, that were planned for the ship. Costa Smeraldas two postponements in delivery marks four substantial delays overall in construction and delivery for an Excellence-class vessel, after also experienced two postponements in delivery in 2018 at Meyer Werft. The ship was originally slated to be delivered in October 2019. Her debut was scheduled to be on 20 October 2019, with a 15-day maiden cruise from Hamburg to Savona. Her christening ceremony was scheduled to be on 3 November 2019 in Savona, after which she would begin cruising the Western Mediterranean. On 16 September 2019, Meyer Turku and Costa announced that Costa Smeraldas delivery would be postponed by approximately one month, to mid-November 2019, citing technical complexities with the construction. All cruises and ceremonies scheduled prior to this date were subsequently cancelled and the ship's maiden cruise was postponed to 30 November 2019 and moved from Hamburg to Savona. On 29 October 2019, Meyer Turku announced a second postponement in delivery for Costa Smeralda and restated the complexities as the reason for driving the project's timeline beyond the planned schedule. The inaugural voyage from Savona was now postponed to 21 December 2019. On 5 December 2019, Meyer Turku delivered Costa Smeralda to Costa at the Meyer Turku shipyard. She was christened by her godmother, Pen√©lope Cruz, on 22 February 2020 in Savona. = Operational career = Following her delivery, Costa Smeralda left Turku on 6 December 2019 for the Mediterranean for travel industry presentations in Barcelona on 18 December, in Marseille on 19 December, and in Savona on 20 December. She officially debuted on 21 December 2019 from Savona for her inaugural cruise, calling in Marseille, Barcelona, Palma de Mallorca, Civitavecchia, and La Spezia. For her inaugural season, she continued sailing weekly voyages, with Cagliari later scheduled to replace La Spezia for summer 2020 and Palermo later replacing Cagliari in winter 2020‚Äì2021. From April 2021 to October 2021, Costa Smeralda is scheduled to cruise in the Persian Gulf from Dubai for the first time.  Coronavirus quarantine  In January 2020, the vessel and her 6,000 passengers were quarantined at the Italian port of Civitavecchia following two suspected cases of SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus) infection related to the COVID-19 pandemic. A spokesperson from Costa Cruises stated that a 54-year-old woman aboard the cruise ship was suffering from a fever and that she and her husband were both being tested. They were later found to be uninfected by SARS-CoV-2 and passengers were allowed to go on shore the next day.

It is translated from the Dutch by David Colmer. The satirical work focuses on modern society's excessive materialism and individualism. Set primarily in a location known as \\"Dreamland\\", an amusement park designed to integrate animals into a human society, the story is told from the perspective of an unnamed captive gorilla as he progresses through the trials of becoming human.  Plot synopsis  Verhelst's novel opens in the first-person narrative of a young gorilla. The narrator and his family are captured from their home in the jungle by poachers. The family is chained together and forced to march to an unknown destination, with some members dying from the harsh conditions of the journey. The caravan eventually reaches a coast where the prisoners are crowded into a ship and sent on a long journey overseas. Finally, the ship reaches a large, man-made facility, where the family is divided by gender. The narrator, along with the other males, learns to speak and act like a human from a human trainer. After the completion of their training, the group joins many other animals of multiple species for their final test: a cocktail party. At this party, all the animals mingle and dance with their new human skills. Following the party, the narrator is brought to a sort of amusement park, \\"Dreamland\\", where the animals are assigned various human jobs based on their capabilities. The narrator gradually gains trust from the higher-ranked humans, eventually obtaining a position training animals himself. He gains enough trust from his supervisors to earn a badge showing his rank as fully human, where he is promoted to a management position and a nice apartment. However, the narrator soon begins to notice some suspicious activity among the humans at the park, leading to an impromptu, frenzied investigation of suspicious shipments of animals. This investigation peaks with a devastating fire that destroys the park ‚Äì the cause of which is unknown. The narrator ends up with a mindless job in the financially devastated city near the park, where he eventually befriends Lucia, the daughter of Dreamland's owner, and comes to live with her. The novel closes with an image of Lucia in front of a sunset.  Literary elements  = Genre = Verhelst is one of the most prominent writers of Flemish Postmodernism. Flemish Postmodernism characteristically criticizes modern society as well as contemporary thinking in general, which can be seen in The Man I Becames satirical tone with the subjects of smartphones, emphasis on small-talk, and corporate life as the narrator becomes increasingly integrated into human society. = Themes and allegory = The narrator's abduction from the jungle is highly reminiscent of the Atlantic slave trade. They are chained and brought upon a grueling sea journey in the brig of a ship where they are all packed together and eventually separated. The narrator and the other animals are subjected to constant training exercises with severe punishments for failure. This scenario is described through a confused narration, paralleling many stories told from the perspective of slavery. These themes can also be seen as a reflection of slavery to the digital world and social structure in the corporate sphere. Satire is one of the primary literary techniques of the work, as The Man I Became satirizes the parts of human culture that are often viewed as negatives by postmodern standards. The narrator is placed against his will in a society of other animals trying to play the game of social interaction through small talk to gain notoriety and ascend the ranks to become fully human. This goal of achieving true humanity is what takes away the narrator's own identity, as he is stripped away from his life in the jungle as a gorilla, to be trained to follow the human rules of Dreamland. This is Verhelst's way of pointing out the way in which contemporary society strips individuals of their individuality. It also invokes criticism of animals being forced to perform in circuses and other events. = Style = Verhelst's narrative style in the novel blends unnatural narratology and cognitive narratology. Verhelst layers the unnatural human narration with the cognitive experience of a non-human animal. Verhelst uses a blend of these two narration styles to best represent the first-person perspective of a gorilla. In other words, while Verhelst's protagonist is not human, he blends its non-human experiences with human narration and emotions to create an unlikely relatable character. Additionally, Verhelst utilizes short chapters throughout the novel, creating a sense of frenzy and dream-like storytelling from his narrator.  Publication information  The Man I Became was originally published in Dutch by Uitgeverij Prometheus as Geschiedenis van een berg during 2013 in both print and e-book format. An English translation by David Colmer was released in 2016 by Peirene Press in print and e-book format.  Critical reception  Critical reception for The Man I Became has been mostly positive. The novel has received both criticism and praise for its plot style. The Oxford Review described the plot as Verhelst's narrator posing vague questions about the nature of humanity that remain unanswered, which they found both frustrating and fascinating, as well as integral to the story's form. In a review for The Guardian, Nicholas Lezard compared the work to Will Self‚Äôs Great Apes and James Lever‚Äôs Me Cheeta, stating that it \\"seems at first to be a not-too-sophisticated satire on humanity\\" but that it was ultimately a \\"haunting, apocalyptic novella, supremely and deliberately difficult to pin down\\". In a review for the original Dutch version, De Volkskrant's Arjan Peters felt that the book was longer than it needed to be as the narrator's mature morality was clear early on and that it felt like a children's book that was stretched out for adult audiences. A reviewer for NRC Handelsblad was also critical, stating that they saw the narrator as too mature for an ape that has only just joined humanity and that this felt like a cliche Verhelst should have avoided. = Awards = * PEN Translates Award (2015, won)  References  Postmodern novels Dutch novels 2013 novels ","title":"The Man I Became"},{"id":"60496984","text":"Brian D.

The song is the first promotional single off of their debut studio album, Songs of Praise. The single was released on 20 September 2017 through Dead Oceans.  Background  In an interview with National Public Radio, lead singer, Charlie Steen, described that track as a fl√¢neur's perspective on the psychological and emotionally draining effects of a doomed relationship\\". Steen further described the track as \\"a moment where all of the worries and thoughts one might feel within this entrapment are isolated and embraced ‚Äì a moment where the futility of reasoning is accepted.\\" The song features a call-and-response set of vocals between lead singer Steen and bassist Josh Finerty. Per an interview with NPR, the idea of that was to represent the trapping feeling of being in a relationship that almost feels like you're talking with yourself. The song went through several renditions as the band formed before the entire band contributed to the vocals at the ending of the track. Per Steen this gave the song a \\"schoolboy-choir [sound], vaguely angelic finale that we were looking for.\\"  Critical reception  Writing for National Public Radio (NPR), Bob Boilen called \\"Concrete\\" a passionate song with \\"call-and-response stuttered guitars\\". Boilen compared the track to fellow British post-punk band, Gang of Four. Boilen however said that Shame's music, and the song Concrete specifically feel \\"vital\\" with \\"19-year-old [Charlie] Steen and bassist Josh Finerty screaming at each other, revealing the inner dialog of the song's main character\\". In a separate NPR review of the track, Lars Gotrich described a song that lurches like a vampire bat and kicks grinning teeth. Cady Siregar, writing for The Quietus compared their song to post-punk band, Fat White Family, describing the song as \\"highly politicised songwriting and their merry-go-round of raucous hedonism on and off stage has perhaps inevitably drawn comparisons with Fat White Family - and Shame are part of the south London scene that spawned Fat Whites. But they have also helped revive the good old ‚ÄòIs guitar music dead?‚Äô debate; Shame are, undeniably and perhaps frustratingly, all white men and that tired old debate seems only to include bands of white men.\\" John Norris, writing for Billboard praised the track for its exhilarating sound, and compared the track to Parquet Courts, Slint, The Clash, Beck, and Gang of Four. Norris said that the song has a \\"witty, melodic, fiery and addictive vibe\\".  Music video  A corresponding music video was released on 20 September 2017, the same day as the single's release.

It was built in the first half of the third century BC. Description The tomb consists of a monumental facade and two vaulted chambers (an antechamber and a burial chamber), covered over by an earthen tumulus 2.5 m high and 15-17 m in diameter. =Facade= The facade is shaped like that of a Greek temple, with four engaged Ionic columns supporting an architrave and a pediment. The metre- high triangular tympanum is painted with a depiction of an old man and woman, who are presumably the tomb's occupants, lying together on a couch at a symposium. Both are depicted in three-quarter view, facing left. The man lies on the left, wearing a white chiton and a red himation with a purple border. He has a grey beard and holds a temple key in his right hand, probably indicating that he held a religious office. His head turns to the right, to look at the old woman, who is presumably his wife. She wears a yellow chiton and a purple himation, and props her head up with her right arm. The background is dark blue. Unusually, there are antefixes on the apex of the pediment and at each corner. These are shaped like palmettes. Six blocks of poros stone sealed the tomb's entrance. =Interior= The antechamber is 4.10 m wide and 2 m long. The lower part of the walls is painted black and the upper part is white, with bands of black and white separating the two sections. The unique painted design on the ceiling, consisting of six palmettes and water lilies on a light blue background, is the source of the tomb's modern name. A large marble double door (3.5 m tall and 0.9 m wide) in the rear wall of the chamber led to the burial chamber. It was found in pieces, shattered in antiquity when the tomb was robbed. The burial chamber is 4.05 m wide and 5.1 m long. The walls are painted to resemble marble revetment, with the lower part in black, the upper part in red, and a white band separating the two sections. The ceiling is painted yellow. A stone base on the right side of this chamber toward the rear once supported the larnax, which contained the ashes of the deceased occupant of the tomb, but it was taken when the tomb was robbed in ancient times. Several fragments of ivory sculpture have been recovered, which apparently derive from battle scenes and Dionysiac scenes that once decorated a wooden couch. Excavation The tomb was discovered in 1971 after illegal excavations. It was then excavated by Katerina Rhomiopoulou from 1971 to 1973. A metal structure was built over the tomb in 1988 to protect it from the elements, but restoration work is still ongoing.

Life  Born in New Jersey in 1984, Becker received his BA in philosophy and physics from Cornell in 2006, a MS in Physics from University of Michigan in 2007 and a PhD in Physics from University of Michigan with Dragen Huterer as his doctoral advisor in 2012. His thesis was on primordial non-Gaussianity, which he summarized in popular terms as, \\"I was trying to find out how much we can learn about the way stuff was arranged in the early universe by looking at the way stuff is arranged in the universe right now.\\" Becker worked at New Scientist magazine, and he was a researcher in the Labs division of the Public Library of Science (PLOS). , he was a visiting scholar at the Office for History of Science and Technology at the University of California, Berkeley. Becker joined the California Quantum Interpretation Network, \\"a research collaboration among faculty and staff at multiple UC campuses and other universities across California, focusing on the interpretation of quantum physics.\\"  What is Real?  In 2016, Becker received a grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation to write a book. The resulting work, What is Real? (2018), focused on the question of what exactly quantum physics says about the nature of reality. The book deals with the personalities behind the competing interpretations of quantum physics as well as the historical factors that influenced the debate‚Äîfactors such as military spending on physics research due to World War II, the Cold War ethos that caused the eschewing of physicists thought to be Marxist, the assumed infallibility of John von Neumann, the sexism that quashed the work of Grete Hermann the female mathematician who first spotted von Neumann's error, and the sway of prominent philosophical schools of the period, like the logical positivists of the Vienna Circle. Niels Bohr looms large in the book as the charismatic figure whose stature and obtuse writing style made it hard for alternate interpretations to be voiced. The book also challenges the popular portrayal of Albert Einstein as a behind-the-times thinker who couldn't accept the new paradigm. Becker argues that Einstein's thought experiments aimed at quantum dynamics are not stodgy quibbles with the seeming randomness of quantum physics, as characterized by the popularity of the quote that \\"God does not play dice\\". Rather, Einstein's thought experiments are apt critiques of action at a distance. The book was reviewed by the New York Times, New York Review of Books, Science and New Scientist, among others. In Physics Today, David Wallace called the book \\"a superb contribution both to popular understanding of quantum theory and to ongoing debates among experts.\\" In the Wall Street Journal, Andrew Crumey said, \\"Adam Becker tells a fascinating if complex story of quantum dissidents.\\" And in Nature, Ramin Skibba said \\"What Is Real? is an argument for keeping an open mind. Becker reminds us that we need humility as we investigate the myriad interpretations and narratives that explain the same data.\\" The book was among the finalists for the PEN/E. O. Wilson Literary Science Writing Award and Physics World magazine's Book of the Year. Reviews in Science News and the American Journal of Physics were more negative, criticizing the book for historical inaccuracies and philosophical oversimplifications. Sheldon Lee Glashow was also critical. In his blog, Peter Woit took issue with what he saw as Becker's vilification of Niels Bohr and endorsement of Hugh Everett's Many-worlds interpretation, to which Becker replied that he intended to do neither.

Since the second half of the 20th century, it has had increased scholarly interest. Confucianism is often studied under the umbrella of Chinese philosophy, and American scholars of Confucianism generally teach in university philosophy or religion departments. Whether Confucianism should be categorized as a religion, philosophy, or tradition has been controversial in U.S. academia. Contemporary discussion of Confucianism in the U.S. centers on questions about its modern relevance in America and its ability to be studied and practiced outside China and East Asia. Major topics discussed by scholars of Confucianism in the U.S. include Confucian humaneness (ren), ritual (li), Confucianism in global cultural dialogue, and its relationship to universal values. Compared to Buddhism (another East Asian tradition which has been widely popularized and practiced in the U.S.), Confucianism has received little attention beyond a small circle of academic specialists. Apart from occasional lectures on Confucianism, Confucius Institutes across the United States have little influence in promoting Confucian philosophy or Confucianism as a way of life. The association of Confucianism with historical and political expressions which endorsed hierarchical relationships and suppressed individual rights may have prevented it from achieving a wider influence in the U.S. because it is seen as conflicting with American (and universal) values of democracy and human rights. Contemporary American scholars of Confucianism are exploring the possibility of a dialogue between Confucianism and universal values, and applying Confucian teachings to modern American life.  History  The history of Confucianism in the U.S. can be separated into three periods. = 1830s to early 1900s = Since the 1830s, a number of missionaries traveled to China to spread Christianity and wrote accounts of Confucianism. Among them were Elijah Coleman Bridgman (1801-1861), Samuel Wells Williams (1812-1884), and Arthur Henderson Smith (1845-1932). In addition to their missionary work, they studied the Chinese language and familiarized themselves with Chinese culture. Williams' 1848 book, The Middle Kingdom, was the first comprehensive scholarly work on China by an American. He spoke highly of Confucius, and considered the Analects incomparable to any other book in history with the exception of the Bible. During the 1870s, institutions devoted to China studies and Confucianism began to take root at Yale and Harvard Universities and the University of California. = Early 20th century = The general attitudes of American scholars toward Confucianism during this period can be grouped into two strands. One group (heavily influenced by Max Weber) viewed it as inferior to Western, Christian-based culture and the reason for the stagnation of contemporary Chinese society. Another school of thought, represented by Sinologist H. G. Greel, affirmed the value of interpersonal bonds (ren lun) in Confucianism and regarded Confucius as one of the most important figures in human history. Greel argued that Confucianism played a constructive role in influencing the Age of Enlightenment, examining Confucianism in detail in Confucius and the Chinese Way (1949) and Birth of China (1936).  China  In comparison to a growing interest in Confucianism in the U.S., the 1905 abandonment of the civil-service- examination system posed a major challenge to the significance of Confucianism in China (since the examination was largely based on mastery of classical Confucian texts). The 1911 collapse of the Qing dynasty and the New Culture Movement, led by Chinese students and intellectuals, also dealt major blows to traditional Chinese values, practices and language. Chinese intellectuals became increasingly drawn to liberalism or Marxism as they tried to develop a model of what a new China should look like. Some, such as Liang Shuming (1893-1988), Zhang Junmai (1886-1969) and Xiong Shili (1885-1968), continued to defend Confucianism as a solution to China's ills. = Late 20th century = Confucian scholarship flourished during the late 20th century. A number of New Confucian scholars from mainland China emigrated to the U.S. after the founding of the People's Republic of China, including Zhang Junmai (Carson Chang) and He Lin. Their proteges, such as Tu Weiming, Cheng Chungying, Yu Ying-shih, and Liu Shuxian, established a new emphasis on Confucian study in the United States. The period also saw growing American interest in Confucianism and Chinese culture, marked by watershed events such as the founding of the PRC and the Korean War. The work of Mou Zongsan also informed Confucian scholarship in America during this period. Mou is known as part of the second generation of New Confucians; contemporaries include Tang Junyi and Xu Fuguan. Confucian scholars who came to the U.S. engage with Western philosophers such as Hegel and Kant, re-interpreting classical texts and responding to global democratization and the rule of law characterizing the second half of the century. A number of institutions devoted to the study of China and Confucianism emerged during this period, including the John King Fairbank Center of Harvard University and the University of Hawaii. Prominent American scholars of Confucianism in the U.S. during this period include William Theodore de Bary, Benjamin Schwartz, Thomas A. Metzger, David Hall, and Roger T. Ames.  Contemporary scholarship  = Philosophy = The controversy about categorizing Confucianism as a philosophy is tied to the controversy surrounding Chinese philosophy and the issue of translation. The Chinese word for philosophy (zhe xue) is a translation from the Japanese which came into existence during the early 20th century. Hu Shih's Outline of a History of Chinese Philosophy (1918) and Feng Youlan's History of Chinese Philosophy (1934) established the concept of Confucianism as a philosophy. Controversies about categorizing Confucianism as philosophy stem from China and the West; Western philosophers question Confucianism's metaphysical sophistication, and objections from China argue that categorizing Confucianism as philosophy violates key aspects of the tradition. = Tradition = More than a subject of theoretical inquiry, Confucianism is related to practices that seek to improve oneself and one's world. Contemporary Confucian scholars in the U.S. differ about the inheritance of rituals (the historical practice of Confucian traditions), emphasizing Confucianism's practical aspects in orienting one's ethical life: the way one perceives (and acts) in the world. The view of Confucianism as a tradition challenges the way it should be practiced today. In Contemporary Confucian Political Philosophy, Stephen Angle writes: \\"It may not be as easy to know how to practice Confucianism today as it once was\\", because \\"pre-twentieth century Chinese society had various well- trodden paths to follow, based in part in a deeply ingrained ritualization of life\\". Angle also argues that the practice of Confucianism in modern times can benefit from \\"critical modern innovations like broad political participation, the rule of law, and the active rooting out of social oppression.\\" = Religion = Whether Confucianism can be categorized as a religion is controversial. According to Bin Song of Boston University, it as \\"deeply spiritual, but not religious.\\" American Confucian scholars Philip J. Ivanhoe, Robert Cummings Neville, and Tu Weiming agree about Confucianism's religious aspect. Ivanhoe describes Confucian spirituality as a means of integrating oneself into the larger patterns of life embedded in society and nature: \\"Cultivating the self in order to take one‚Äôs place in this universal scheme describes the central task of life\\". Neville lists three criteria for a religious tradition‚Äîa cosmology, a body of rituals, and a path of spiritual perfection‚Äîand believes that all three apply to Confucianism. Tu defines Confucian religiosity as communal self-transformation and a faithful response to the transcendent, characterizing it as the Confucian prescription \\"for learning to be fully human\\". Confucianism believes that the ultimate meaning of life is realizable through ordinary daily existence. = Ruism = Bin Song uses the term \\"Ruism\\" instead of \\"Confucianism\\". According to Song, \\"Confucianism\\" implies the absolute authority of Confucius' teachings and \\"no one in the Ru tradition would have ever dared to critique Confucius in any conceivable way.\\" He believes that the term \\"Ruism\\" better captures the spirit of criticism he sees in the teachings of great Ru thinkers such as Confucius, Mencius, and Wang Yangming. Song seeks to the shed light on the spiritual dimension of Ruism, which encourages autonomy and criticism and departs from religious dogmatism. = Philosophical schools = Robert Cummings Neville proposes that scholars of Confucianism in the U.S. fall into three major categories: interpretive philosophers who are devoted to translation, bridging philosophers who compare Confucianism with Western thought, and normative philosophers who aim to promote Confucianism's contemporary significance in global cultural conversations. Although there are no sharp divisions between the philosophical schools, the primarily-interpretive philosophers were generally trained as historians and textual critics; normative thinkers were generally trained as philosophers.  Interpretive philosophers  William Theodore de Bary has taught East Asian thought for many years at Columbia University, and has trained many scholars of Chinese philosophy in the United States and Canada. He has led the Columbia University Seminar on Neo- Confucianism, edited the Sources of Chinese Tradition (1960) and edited and contributed to a number of conference volumes, including Self and Society in Ming Thought (1970) and The Unfolding of Neo-Confucianism (1975).  Bridging philosophers  Herbert Fingarette's Confucius: The Secular as Sacred has been an important book on Chinese philosophy for Western philosophers. Fingarette's thesis is that the Confucian notion of ritual to make social relations possible and to be the medium of ethics. David Shepherd Nivison of Stanford University also contributed to the solution of contemporary Western philosophical problems. Nivison's major work was The Ways of Confucianism: Investigations in Chinese Philosophy (1996). Philip J. Ivanhoe, an American historian of Confucianism and a philosophy professor, relates Confucian thought to contemporary philosophical problems (primarily ethics). Ivanhoe's book Confucian Moral Self Cultivation (1993) studies six thinkers: Confucius, Mencius, Xunzi, Zhu Xi, Wang Yangming, and Dai Zhen, showing the contemporary relevance of their thought.  Normative philosophers  Normative philosophers identify some Chinese school (such as Confucianism or Daoism) as central to their own heritage; their main philosophic intent is neither interpretation nor comparison, but the normative engagement of contemporary philosophical problems. Philosophers in this category include Roger T. Ames, David Hall, Tu Weiming, and Chung-ying Cheng. Roger T. Ames and David Hall, professors at the University of Hawaii, collaborated on three books: Thinking Through Confucius (1987), Anticipating China (1995), and Thinking from the Han (1998). Ames and Hall contrast Western and Chinese cultures and distill each into certain essential characteristics. Western culture is based on transcendent ordering principles; Chinese culture is based on \\"correlative thinking\\", identifying classifications which are themselves correlated. = Boston Confucians =  Origin  The Boston Confucians are a group of philosophers who believe that Confucianism is a portable tradition which can be applied to contexts outside its pre-modern- Chinese origin. Attendees of a 1992 Confucian-Christianity conference began to refer to Robert Cummings Neville, a Confucian scholar and Christian theologian from Boston University, and his colleagues as \\"Boston Confucians.\\" Although the term \\"Boston Confucianism\\" was used as \\"affectionate teasing and tongue- in-cheek self-description,\\" it came to be used as \\"a semi-serious label\\" for the view that \\"Confucianism is not limited to East Asian ethnic application\\" and \\"has something genuinely interesting and helpful to bring to contemporary philosophical discussions\\". In addition to Neville, major figures of Boston Confucianism are John Berthrong and Tu Weiming. Bin Song has published a series of articles in the Huffington Post about the contemporary relevance of Ruism. Among Boston Confucians, the \\"North-of-the-Charles\\" school (Tu Weiming and his Harvard colleagues) emphasizes \\"Mencian humaneness and expresses with new subtlety the Confucian worry that the Christian creation myth has some objectionable literal commitments to God as a being separate from the world\\".  Humanity (Ren)  The classical Confucian term ren (benevolence or humaneness) is central to the Confucian ideal as seen by the Boston Confucians, although different members have nuanced disagreements about its implications. Tu Weiming understands ren as supreme self-cultivation and the fullest manifestation of humanity. Tu's interpretation of humanity is in line with Mencius' notion of the inherent goodness of human nature and the continuity of that nature with the development of civilization. Tu notes the \\"gradual process of extension of love,\\" and the expression of our humanity that \\"ren is most exemplified in our caring toward our relatives (qin qin).\\" He spells out the spiritual dimension in the attainment of humaneness, an \\"inseparability of the Human Way and the Way of Heaven.\\" Robert Neville, agreeing with Tu on the central importance of humanity in Confucian thought, echoes Xunzi's concern that people need rituals to achieve humanity because they are selfish by nature. Xunzi is less confident about the readiness of human nature to develop full-fledged morality, emphasizing the importance of environment and rituals to \\"set aright\\" the inborn nature of humanity. Neville compares the Confucian concept of ren and the Christian notion of love, noting an agreement between Confucius and Christians that the capacity for love is inborn and definitive of what it means to be human.  Ritual propriety (Li)  The interpretation of ritual propriety in Boston Confucianism stems from two strands of Confucian thinking. Tu Weiming's Mencian tradition is that humans' feelings about what is appropriate is inborn, but Neville emphasizes Xunzi's ritual propriety; human endowments are undetermined, and we must learn to approach moral perfection through rituals. For Tu, humanity (ren) is the inner essence of human nature; the heavenly principle (tian li) must express itself in external social relations through ritual propriety. He disagrees that li refers only to structured ceremonies, saying that \\"it points to a concrete way whereby one enters into communion with others\\". Neville emphasizes the need for ritual propriety to act as a corrective for emotion: \\"Our feelings can provide emotive power in all directions, but need learned discrimination to find appropriate objects and appropriate responses.\\" He sees ritual propriety as necessary to achieve ren.  Dialogue  The idea of civilized dialogue is advanced by Tu Weiming about Confucianism's contemporary global relevance. Tu identifies the twenty-first century as a new Axial Age, in which cultural and religious pluralism can foster constructive dialogue between traditions and civilizations. The concept of dialogue between civilizations was also a response to the theory of the \\"clash of civilizations\\" proposed by Samuel P. Huntington, who argued that international conflict in the post-Cold War era was primarily caused by conflicts between cultural and religious identities. In contrast, Tu is hopeful that with \\"tolerance, recognition, and respect\\" the possibility exists for two partners in dialogue to \\"take the other as reference\\" and learn from each other. Tu sees Confucianism as having unique value in dialogue between civilizations, which must exist to sustain its relevance as a living tradition. He proposes that the development of Confucianism can be separated into three epochs: classical Confucianism (traced back to early thinkers such as Confucius, Mencius, and Xunzi), Neo-Confucianism (during the Song and Ming dynasties), and 20th-century New Confucianism. The defining characteristic of the latter is its participation in global civilizational dialogue. Tu sees Confucian humanism as an important spiritual resource in responding to global challenges such as the ecological crisis, social alienation, anomie and egoism. Confucianism would also benefit from participation in such a dialogue; according to Tu, \\"If the well-being of humanity is its central concern, Confucian humanism in the third epoch cannot afford to be confined to East Asian culture. A global perspective is needed to universalize its concerns. Confucians can benefit from dialogue with Jewish, Christian, and Islamic theologians, with Buddhists, with Marxists, and with Freudian and post- Freudian psychologists.\\". Tu believes that New Confucianism must respond to four challenges from the West: (1) scientific inquiry, (2) democracy, (3) Western religiosity and its sense of transcendence, and (4) the Freudian psychological exploration of human nature.  Controversy  Bryan Van Norden, in his review of the book Boston Confucianism, questions the originality of Boston Confucians' argument about the portability of Confucian tradition. Van Norden suggests that the portability of Confucianism had already been widely acknowledged before the book was published. The emergence of Neo-Confucianism in the Song and Ming dynasties and the spread of Confucianism to other parts of Asia were examples of Confucianism as an evolving, portable tradition. According to Van Norden, \\"Neville's label is original, but the concept is not.\\" Stephen C. Angle, a Confucian philosopher and professor of philosophy and East Asian studies at Wesleyan University, writes in his essay \\"American Confucianism: Between Tradition and Universal Values\\" that Boston Confucianism has had a limited impact in promoting Confucian values and practices in the U.S. The Chinese Confucian world has criticized Tu Weiming's use of Western religious concepts and terminology in describing Confucianism, which they consider inappropriate.  Progressive Confucianism  Progressive Confucianism is a term coined by Stephen C. Angle which sheds light on Confucianism's engagement with universal values such as democracy and human rights. Angle gives the term a two-dimensional meaning; it describes the core Confucian commitment to individual and collective moral progress, and believes that ethical insight can lead to progressive political change (which leads to greater realization of our potential for virtue). It is influenced by Mou Zongsan's idea of \\"self-restriction\\", which connects morality and the rule of law. Major concerns of Angle's Progressive Confucianism include human rights, the rule of law, and gender equality. His prescription of Confucianism for progressive political change is in line with \\"a kind of constitutional democracy,\\" but he stresses that Progressive Confucianism is more than constitutional democracy. Angle offers a creative Confucian interpretation of ritual (an aspect of Confucianism often criticized for its association with hierarchical relationships, filial piety and oppression), writing that \\"Progressive Confucians must stand against oppression, notwithstanding historical Confucian complacency concerning many types of oppression\\". For Angle, trogressive changes in political institutions and social relationships is compatible with Confucianism and essential to upholding its essence: \\"the ideal of all individuals developing their capacities for virtue‚Äîultimately aiming at sagehood‚Äîthrough their relationships with one another and with their environment.\\" = Critiques = Tongdong Bai, a professor of philosophy at Fudan University, wrote about Angle's Progressive Confucianism that there may be more alternatives to Confucian political institutions than liberal democracy. Bai said that contemporary Confucian political thinkers, such as Daniel A. Bell, Jiang Qing and himself, \\"don't believe that history ends with liberal democracy,\\" but would \\"try to offer alternatives, such as a hybrid regime that combines democratic elements with meritocratic elements.\\" Bao Wenxin, a researcher at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, wrote that the layers of meaning embedded in the Chinese word \\"progressive\\" (ËøõÊ≠•) may have rendered the label of Progressive Confucianism a vague one. Bao suggests that Angle's argument that Progressive Confucianism promotes collective moral progress may not be as evident in traditional Confucianism before the 20th century. According to Leigh Jenco, Angle's creation of a modernized Confucianism is almost ironic: \\"Confucianism becomes relevant and 'modern' only to the extent that it can incorporate certain prior commitments to such key values as rule of law and human rights\\".

Akavi was kidnapped in Syria in October 2013 and subsequently taken hostage by Islamic State forces in May 2014. Akavi's captivity remained a tightly-held secret by the New Zealand Government and media for the past five years. On 15 March 2019, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) disclosed her identity following the fall of the Islamic State's last stronghold in Syria. New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters has confirmed that the New Zealand Government is still trying to rescue and bring her home. Background Louisa Akavi is a New Zealander of Cook Islander descent. She grew up in Rarotonga and grew up in Welington's Porirua suburb. Akavi completed her training at Wellington Hospital in 1977 and then worked as a staff nurse for two years. She later traveled to Scotland to do midwifery training and also worked for two years in London. After returning to New Zealand, Akavi worked at Wellington Hospital before joining the New Zealand Red Cross. After joining the Red Cross, Akavi worked in several countries including Malaysia, Hong Kong, Somalia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Bosnia, the Solomon Islands, Iraq and Chechnya. While on assignment in Chechnya in 1996, Akavi survived an attack on the ICRC Hospital of Novye Atagi which claimed the lives of six other Red Cross workers including fellow New Zealander Sheryl Thayer. In 1999, Akavi was awarded the Florence Nightingale Medal, the Red Cross' highest honour. In 2003, Akavi went on a Red Cross assignment in Iraq. In 2013, she went on another assignment to Syria during the Syrian Civil War. Kidnapping and captivity On 13 October 2013, the then 62-year old Louisa Akavi was part of a Red Cross convoy consisting of seven ICRC workers including two drivers who were kidnapped by armed gunmen near the town of Saraqeb in Syria's Idlib Governorate. While the other hostages were released, Akavi and the two Syrian drivers Alaa Rajab and Nabil Bakdounes were not. As of April 2019, the status and whereabouts of the two Syrian drivers remain unknown. According to The Guardian, Akavi was on her 17th mission with the Red Cross. The ICRC issued a televised press release but avoided identifying the names and nationalities of the kidnapped workers. The New Zealand Government was made aware of Akavi's kidnapping but did not publicise her case to avoid endangering her and encouraging her captors to issue ransom demands. The then-Foreign Minister Murray McCully also ruled out paying ransom demands, citing New Zealand's policy of not paying ransoms to terrorist groups. According to McCully, the Fifth National Government received no direct communications from her captors. The ICRC also reportedly received a proof of life from Akavi's captors in 2014, which is regarded as a precursor to a ransom. The Red Cross also has a policy of not paying ransoms. It also kept Akavi's captivity a secret in the hope of a \\"positive outcome.\\" One of her captors was reportedly Mohammed Emwazi, the British Arab national known as \\"Jihadi John.\\" Akavi was also reportedly held captive alongside several other Western hostages including the journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and the aid workers David Haines and Kayla Mueller, who were subsequently murdered by their ISIS captors. Akavi reportedly befriended Mueller while in ISIS captivity but the two were later separated. In July 2014, a failed US operation to rescue both women resulted in ISIS threats to execute both women. While Mueller later died in ISIS captivity, Akavi was reportedly kept alive due to her nursing skills and put to work in an ISIS-controlled hospital by late 2016; making her one of ISIS's longest surviving hostages alongside British journalist John Cantlie and Italian Jesuit priest Paolo Dall'Oglio. Rescue attempts According to the New Zealand news media company Stuff, the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service and Government Communications Security Bureau were involved in negotiations about Akavi's release or possible rescue. Stuff also disclosed that the elite New Zealand Special Air Service were deployed in Iraq around 2017 to advise on Akavi's location and movements from intelligence gleaned from both the GCSB and foreign intelligence services and to liaise with Western coalition forces for a possible rescue mission. This mission did not proceed due to a lack of reliable intelligence on her whereabouts. In February 2019, it was reported that three hostages including a Red Cross worker were being used as bargaining chips by ISIS to secure the safe passage of their fighters following the loss of ISIS territory to Syrian Democratic Forces. Despite reports that Akavi was sighted in the area near Al-Baghuz Fawqani around March 2019, searches turned up empty-handed. By mid-April, Government ministers were informed by New Zealand's intelligence services that her status was \\"under review\\"; meaning that they no longer had certainty she was still alive. Media coverage and subsequent developments On 15 March, the New Zealand Red Cross's Secretary General, Niamh Lawless broke its silence on Louisa Akavi's captivity, reiterating its call for Akavi's captors to release her and expressing its support for her family. The International Committee of the Red Cross also issued a statement seeking information about the whereabouts of Akavi and two Syrian drivers Syrian drivers Alaa Rajab and Nabil Bakdounes, who had been part of the Red Cross convoy. This story was covered by several New Zealand media outlets including Radio New Zealand, Stuff, the New Zealand Herald, and 1 News as well as international outlets including the New York Times, The Guardian, ABC News, and the Japan Times. The New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters has also issued statements that the New Zealand Government is making efforts to rescue Akavi. Both Peters and Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern have criticized the International Committee of the Red Cross' decision to disclose Akavi's identity as reckless and \\"rolling the dice on people's lives\\". Ardern has stated that she preferred that such information remain outside the public domain. In response, the International Committee of the Red Cross defended its decision to disclose Akavi's plight, asserting it had done so with the consultation of the New Zealand Government. Following the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a US Delta Force operation in late October 2019, Prime Minister Ardern said that the Government and its Coalition partners had received no information on the whereabouts of Akavi. A senior government source said they had not given up hope she was still alive but admitted that hope was dwindling due to the lack of any new information or positive sightings.

It aired on 29 April 2018 in the United States and 6 October 2018 in the United Kingdom. Villanelle (Jodie Comer) is made to work with other people to take someone out, while Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh) has her eyes on the same target. Synopsis Bill's funeral is held in the UK. As Frank (Darren Boyd) delivers the eulogy, Eve is overwhelmed by emotions and walks out. Elena (Kirby Howell-Baptiste) asks Eve for her next step, and Eve replies \\"I want to kill her [Villanelle]. With my bare hands.\\" Villanelle throws a lavish birthday party for Konstantin (Kim Bodnia) in her apartment. Konstantin admonishes her for her unsanctioned killing of Bill, and as punishment she will have to work with others for her next job. She subtly warns Konstantin that she is aware of his daughter. Villanelle travels to England and meets her fellow assassins, Diego (Edward Akrout) and Nadia (Olivia Ross). Villanelle and Nadia scuffle, but Diego breaks up the fight. Nadia, who is in a relationship with Diego, tells Villanelle that their target is a member of the British intelligence services. Niko (Owen McDonnell) implores Eve to pull out of the investigation after Bill's death. He also informs Eve that her suitcase appeared on their doorstep. She opens the suitcase to find it full of expensive designer clothing, along with a bottle of perfume called \\"La Villanelle\\" and a card with the message \\"Sorry Baby\\". Kenny's (Sean Delaney) analysis of the documents supplied by Jin (Lobo Chan) reveals a financial connection to a prep school. Eve consults with Carolyn (Fiona Shaw), revealing the mole as Frank. Kenny tracks Frank to a house in a village in Buckinghamshire, and Eve and Elena drive there to observe him. Villanelle, Diego, and Nadia are notified that their target is Frank, and arrive at the village in a minivan. Villanelle and Nadia pose as colleagues of Frank to gain access to the house, but are held up at his house by an accomplice. Frank flees in a vehicle, and the assassins give chase. Frank's van is slower than the assassins', and he had to stop when he reached a farm. Eve calls Frank, and he tells her that he is being targeted. The assassins riddle Frank's stationary vehicle with bullets, but Frank had already climbed out and hid in nearby bushes on the advice of Eve. Villanelle provokes Diego into drawing his weapon on her, prompting Nadia to yell out Villanelle's real name, Oksana, and revealing that the two were in a relationship. Nadia convinces Diego that she will shoot Villanelle, then turns her gun on him instead. Villanelle pledges to prove herself to Nadia after previously betraying her, but only as a lure to get Nadia to the back of the minivan, running her over with it twice. Eve talks Frank into making a run to her and Elena's car. Frank runs across a field, with Villanelle in pursuit on foot. Frank manages to scramble up a hill and climb into the car just as Villanelle appears. She locks eyes with Eve, raises a pistol, and fires. Production =La Villanelle perfume= The words on the perfume bottle At the start of the episode, Villanelle has returned Eve's stolen suitcase but packed it with luxurious fashion, including a bottle of perfume called \\"La Villanelle\\". Critics point to the \\"great deal of thought\\" and \\"care\\" that has gone into the selection, showing \\"intimacy\\" on Villanelle's part. It is also an act that reveals her name to Eve, a \\"perfume clue\\", with Eve knowing to literally chase the scent. In the episode, the perfume box is also where the note reading \\"Sorry Baby x\\" is tucked in, with one critic asking if it is \\"an apology or a taunt\\" and exploring Villanelle's psyche and intentions towards Eve; another outright calls it \\"a sexy way to taunt her\\". In the Codename Villanelle book, hearing the dark backstory of the perfume is how Villanelle chooses her name. Before the episode aired, another critic had written that Villanelle's name was (to the average viewer) \\"off- putting\\" because it is \\"a bad pun on 'villainess'\\" and \\"a name for a Bond girl\\", and that it was only clever if you had read the books where it is explained that the character was \\"inspired toward the nom de guerre [...] by the label on a decadent perfume\\". An unrelated perfume of the same name had been released in March 2018 by Belgian parfumier Kamila Aubre; Aubre said that she \\"noticed some unusual statistics on her website\\" after the episode's release but had assumed the increase in purchases would be because of a \\"beauty blogger\\" mentioning the product, having not heard of the show. Reception Inkoo Kang of Vulture criticized the storytelling in the episode, noting that at halfway through the season it was not showing \\"the tightest mystery ever written\\", instead relying on \\"female prickliness, especially in professional settings\\" to create drama. Comparatively, Kayti Burt of Den of Geek noted how the use of \\"as tight a period of time as possible\\" was done well to \\"intensify the urgency of the drama\\", saying that the episode \\"is the best this good show has ever been\\" because of how the timing allowed \\"just enough\\" opportunity to consider Villanelle's actions but still move the plot along in \\"intriguing\\" ways. Lisa Weidenfeld of The A.V. Club comments on how \\"the whole plotline serves as an important reminder of the way Killing Eve toys with how you feel about Villanelle\\", and notes that it is \\"the first episode where we really see Eve and Villanelle going head to head\\", as they are both hunting down Frank. Kang also says that this episode \\"made [her] realize that [she] just [doesn't] care about Eve's unhappy marriage\\" because of how it gives no backstory to explain Eve's coldness towards Niko; Burt celebrates the characterization of Eve only allowing Elena to comfort her because of their shared understanding, and the inverted marriage dynamics revealing sexist narratives and presenting the \\"complicated mundanity of relationship imbalances\\". Whilst Kang criticizes the specific line \\"We all know you care about me, but sometimes I think it's all you have\\", saying Eve \\"is [being] a jerk for the sake of it\\", IndieWire's Hanh Nguyen calls it a \\"heartbreaking\\" encapsulation of the complex relationship and \\"inevitable breakdown of the Polastris' marriage\\". Both Burt and Nguyen discuss the shot of Eve's face during the funeral scene, with Burt saying that the camera staying \\"glued to her pained face for much longer than we are used to\\" traps the viewer in Eve's guilt-laden mind. Nguyen says that the \\"simplest approach\\" allows Eve \\"to just be\\" and is \\"especially effective when she must deal with grief\\", which she claims Sandra Oh makes \\"riveting\\". On the supporting characters, Weidenfeld says that \\"Nadia and Diego basically serve the purpose of proving how much better at [being an assassin] Villanelle is\\". Nguyen says that \\"[Phoebe] Waller-Bridge's keen understanding of humor in any situation\\" means that Diego was \\"memorable for the brief time viewers got to know him\\". Burt examines the approach to relationships Villanelle takes in this episode. Villanelle gives gifts to both Eve and Konstantin which also serve to threaten them, and nonchalantly kills ex-girlfriend Nadia; Burt suggests that Villanelle can't kill someone \\"until she tricks them into believing her performance of affection\\", which Nadia does. She also calls it \\"great\\" how the show \\"does diverse sexual orientation so casually\\". As an American, Weidenfeld questions if the Received Pronunciation accent Villanelle adopts during the episode is Jodie Comer's real accent, with Burt (also American) believing that it is and saying this was \\"both bizarre and fun to hear\\". Comer, a native of Liverpool, actually has a Scouse accent in real life. Weidenfeld, however, does assert that even she knows \\"fanny is slang for vagina\\". On Rotten Tomatoes the episode has a 100% rating from 6 reviews.

Originally written in Arabic, the novel recounts the 1976 Ebola outbreak.  Plot  On a hot, humid August day in 1976, The Democratic Republic of Congo is the setting of the first major Ebola outbreak. Unfortunately, the outbreak is difficult to contain and control due to the squalid living conditions as a result of deep poverty, and the population's ignorance and apathy regarding the virus. These 2 factors help the Ebola strain to fester and spread to an epidemic affecting the city Kinshasa heavily. As luck would have it, an ordinary Sudanese factory worker by the name Lewis, who happened to stop through Kinshasa on his way back to his home, contracted the virus from an escort during an adulterous romp and consequently brought it back to his home in Nzara to subsequently spread like wildfire. The novel goes on and shows Ebola's path of destruction in Nzara through Lewis' social connections and its devastating effect on the town as a whole.  Main Characters  * Lewis Nawa: Lewis engages in many affairs outside of his loveless marriage with his wife Tina, and he is responsible for bringing the deadly Ebola virus to his hometown of Nzara in the south of Sudan. He works in a Sudanese factory owned by James Riyyak. While he did contract Ebola and was the person responsible for bringing the virus to his city, he was one of the few people who survived through the virus. * Elaine: Elaine was Lewis‚Äôs mistress and a chambermaid from Kinshasa, Congo that is the first character specified to die from Ebola. Lewis made regular visits to see her and was devastated by her sudden death. Elaine contracted the virus from another man she was sleeping with. * Jamandi Ahmed: Jamandi is a magician declining in popularity that performs on the streets every day for money. Jamandi has been around so long that the street her performs on is unofficially named after him. * Kanini: Kanini is an abused, young girl born in the stable outside Kinshasa. Desperate for money, she engages in relations with Lewis and unknowingly infects him with the Ebola virus. * Ruwadi Monti (‚ÄúThe Needle‚Äù): Ruwadi is a famous blind guitar player that performs concerts around Africa. Upon his arrival to Nzara, the Ebola outbreak is exponentially growing. * Darina: Darina is a youthful, pretty girl in her twenties that acts as Ruwadi‚Äôs ‚Äúpersonal walking stick‚Äù. * Anami Okiyano: Originally from Kenya but a long time Nzara resident, Anami is a single man in his sixties and the creator behind the Man of the Year award. Anami also works in the factory owned by James Riyyak with Lewis. * James Riyyak: Riyyak is a former ex-rebel and the owner of the factory and Nzara. He is hated by all of his workers and has a cruel, brutish, and greedy reputation around the region. * Tina Azacouri: Restricted by societal roles, Tina is thirty-seven year old woman trapped in her lifeless marriage with her husband Lewis. She spends her time selling water on the streets with her mother. The only hope she has in her marriage is to have a child before it is too late.  Critical Reception  Critical reception for Ebola '76 was mostly positive and the novel also received positive reader responses. The Guardian was mixed in their review, stating that \\"Like a medieval danse macabre, Ebola leads a parade of wretches to the grave, but Tag Elsir‚Äôs apparent disdain for his characters robs his narrative of empathy and leaves the reader indifferent to the fate of Lewis, the blind guitarist Ruwadi, the washed‚Äëup magician Jamadi and the rest.\\" Asymptote was more favorable, writing that \\"Though it is a quick fictional account, Ebola ‚Äô76 is an educational read about the emergence of the Ebola virus and how it could have possibly spread from the DRC to South Sudan.\\" Reviewing for the American Historical Association, Shatha Almutawa felt that \\"Despite the gravity of the subject of the novel, the language is witty and the mood light-seeing the world from the perspective of the virus, after all, is very different from seeing it from the perspective of grief-stricken men who lost their lovers.\\"  See also  * Ebola virus *The Hot Zone References Ebola Historical novels ","title":"Ebola '76"},{"id":"60497600","text":"Oshay Keyona Nelson-Lawes (born 27 June 1996) is a Canadian-born Jamaican footballer who plays as a forward for the Oakville Blue Devils and the Jamaica women's national team.

Two months later, he established Twin Engine to work in the planning and production of anime and to also act as a network of animation studios, both in partnership and ownership. In November 2015, Yamamoto established Geno Studio with the former Manglobe staff in order to complete the Genocidal Organ film, which was left incomplete due to Manglobe's bankruptcy. In 2016, Twin Engine established Twin Engine Digital Animation Studio, which mostly acts as a sub-contracting studio. Months later, Twin Engine established Relation Inc., a company that mainly deals with advertisement; around the same time, Twin Engine also formed animation studio Revoroot. Aside from Geno Studio, Revoroot and Studio Colorido, which are subsidiaries of Twin Engine, other studios have also partnered with the company, such as Science Saru, Wit Studio, and Lay-duce, with the latter's CEO also belonging to Twin Engine's board of directors. Since its establishment, Twin Engine worked in anime mainly with Fuji TV in the Noitamina programming block due to Yamamoto's previous relationship with the company, but since 2018, Twin Engine productions have not been exclusive to the block and have begun to be part of other TV stations.

At the start of the Syrian popular uprising, Abounaddara posted a new short video on Vimeo in April 2011 and distributed it via social media every Friday.Their films are the antithesis of amateur footage from the Syrian civil war, often recorded by a shaky camera, with a poor or completely unnoticed tone of a moment of intense violence or emotional release.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337779153_Abounaddara_and_the_global_visual_politics_of_the_%27right_to_the_image%27They won the 2014 Vera List Center Prize for Art and Politics.

Location The power line starts at Olkaria, in Nakuru County, about , by road, north-west of Nairobi, and runs in a north-westerly direction to the Ketraco electricity substation in Lessos, in Nandi County. From there, the power line travels further north-west to Eldoret, in Uasin Gishu County. There, the power line turns southwesterly in direction, to terminate in the city of Kisumu, on the eastern shores of Lake Victoria. The power line measures approximately , in length. Overview This power line is intended to transmit power from the Olkaria geothermal electricity complex to the Western Kenya counties in the former Nyanza Province, bordering Lake Victoria. Prior to this line being constructed, the region depended on high cost thermal power derived from fossil fuels (at US$0.34 per kWh) or expensive energy imported from neighboring Uganda at US$0.22 per kWh. The transmission line is intended to supply energy to the region is sufficient quantities and at reasonable rates. Construction This power line project is split into three lots. The first lot, consisting a 400kV line, measuring , stretches from Olkaria to Lessos with maximum carrying capacity of 1,200 megawatts. The second lot, from Lessos to Kisumu, measures and is a 220kV line, capable of transmitting 400 megawatts of power. The third lot consists of three new substations at Olkaria, Lessos and Kisumu, with a new switch yard at Kibos. The contractors on this project include (a) Kalpaturi Power Transmission Company of India (b) NARI Group Corporation, of China and (c) Sieyuan Electric Company and China. The cost of this project is valued at US$94.7 million (KSh9.5 billion). Construction is funded with loans from the Japan International Corporation Agency (JICA).

Originally published by Chaosium in 1984, it was updated and republished in 1996 and 2018. Publication history In 1983, while Larry DiTillio was on strike from his job as a television and movie screenwriter, he was hired by various game companies to write role- playing adventures. One such assignment was Masks of Nyarlathotep for Chaosium, which he co-wrote with Lynn Willis. It was published the same year. In 1996, the campaign was revised, expanded and re-released as The Complete Masks of Nyarlathotep. In 2018, it was comprehensively revised and updated for use with Call of Cthulhu 7th Edition, and optionally for the Pulp Cthulhu supplement. It included a brand new chapter set in Peru. It was released as a three volume slipcase. Description Masks of Nyarlathotep is a boxed set adventure that includes a 160-page perfect-bound softcover book (1983 edition), as well as a variety of handouts given to the players at various points; these include newspaper clippings, handwritten letters, business cards and a matchbox. An edition published in 1990 added eight color plates of scenes from the adventures rendered by Nick Smith, Keith Berdak, Tom Sullivan, and Mark Roland, as well as full color cover art by Lee Gibbons. In the 1996 revision, The Complete Masks of Nyarlathotep, the handouts are printed on the pages of the new edition, meaning the gamemaster has to photocopy those pages in order to give the players the handouts at the appropriate times. The campaign is a series of five sequential adventures that pit the investigators against Nyarlathotep, the Crawling Chaos and Outer God: # The first adventure is set in New York, where the Investigators are drawn into the campaign by a gruesome death. # Following clues, the Investigators move to London, seeking information both on a mysterious cult, and the ill-fated Carlyle Expedition. # The Investigators move to Cairo, where they follow various clues, some of them red herrings. # The fourth chapter is set in and around Nairobi, as the Investigators try to discover how the Carlyle Expedition came to an end. # The last chapter takes the Investigators to Shanghai, where they must put all the clues together to bring a dangerous threat to an end. Reception In the May-June 1985 edition of The Space Gamer (No. 74), Matthew J. Costello was impressed, saying \\"The project is, in sum, massive and largely successful. Perhaps only TSR's Dragonlance series rivals it in size. And while some flavor may have escaped from this ghoulish stew, there's much here to delight Keepers, Investigators, and admirers of H.P. Lovecraft.\\" In the November 1985 edition of White Dwarf (Issue #71), Phil Frances lauded this book as \\"undoutedly the finest... supplement to come from Chaosium.\\" Frances believed the series of adventures presented several possible problems, including a plot that was too complex for beginning gamemasters, and the high mortality rate among adventurers due to the extremely deadly adversaries. He concluded by giving it an excellent rating of 9 out of 9, saying \\"Masks Of Nyarlathotep is an adventure that is fun for both sides to play... This is the best campaign I have ever seen, from Chaosium or other sources.\\" In the June 1990 edition of Dragon (Issue 158), Jim Bambra called this book \\"some of the most powerful and deadly adventures ever written.\\" Bambra lauded the \\"superb narrative and the tantalizing clues [that] carry the Investigators along at a cracking pace.\\" He concluded, \\"Masks of Nyarlathotep is the epitome of COC adventures. It contains detective work, action, and indescribable horrors in all the right quantities. The writing and editing are first class; the adventures perfectly capture what COC is all about. No one should be without a copy of Masks of Nyarlathotep.\\" According to game historian Shannon Appelcline, Masks of Nyarlathotep is considered by many critics to be one of the best roleplaying adventures of all time.

A number of cist graves and a single chamber tomb are located in the vicinity. The structure seems to date to the late fourth or early third century BCE. Description The tomb consists of a monumental facade and two vaulted chambers (an antechamber and a burial chamber) on an east-west axis, covered by an extremely large earthen tumulus 19.5 m high and 76 m in diameter. Excavation has left parts of this tumulus in danger of subsidence. There was a 14.7 m long, 3.5 m wide dromos, paved with clay and gravel, which approached the facade from the west at a slightly oblique angle. The 7.83 m high facade consists of four engaged Ionic columns. The middle two of these are half-columns, while the outer two are quarter columns, directly abutting the antae. These once supported an entablature and pediment, but these are lost. Bronze elements from the door were found, including sixty nails, a knocker, a handle, and a Medusa head, all of which are now in the Istanbul Archaeological Museum. The antechamber is 5.4 m wide, 2.6 m long, and 6.35 m high. The walls are unusually thick, at 0.92 m. The walls were covered with painted stucco. The top third of the wall was painted white, the middle third was red, and the bottom third was painted as white imitation marble revetment with black bands at the top and bottom. The wall separating the antechamber from the burial chamber was largely intact in 1910, but large sections of it have now collapsed. A large marble door to burial chamber, decorated with discs, handle and head of Medusa, all covered in gold, led to the burial chamber. It is now in the Istanbul Archaeological Museum. The burial chamber is 4.07 m wide, 5.08 m long, and 5.29 m high. The walls are even thicker than those of the antechamber, measuring 1.25 m. The walls were covered in white stucco, but do not seem to have been painted. The floor was decorated with black, red, and yellow lozenges, but these no longer survive. There is a sarcophagus along the entire back wall, which is 1.3 m high, divided into two unequal parts. The left section once contained the actual sarcophagus, while the smaller section on the right held grave goods. The actual burial was a pit on the central axis of the tomb underneath the sarcophagus. Remains of a wooden larnax, which once held the remains of the deceased, were found in this pit, covered by cypress planks and four marble slabs. The remains of a tunnel dug into the tomb by grave robbers in antiquity are still visible in the southwest corner of the chamber. Excavation The tomb had already been looted and suffered earthquake damage when it was discovered and excavated in 1910 by Theodore Makridi, from whom it takes its modern name. Largely ignored for most of the twentieth century, further excavations were undertaken by Katerina Tzanavari in the 1990s, which uncovered part of the tumulus and a number of fragments which had become separated from the structure. An extensive restoration project was undertaken between 2012 and 2017, including extensive work to ensure the integrity of the tumulus, partially restore the structure (anastylosis) and ensure its structural integrity, protect it from the elements, and make it accessible to visitors.

In fact, she was the only black woman to successfully make a land claim in Oregon under the Homestead Act of 1862. She was the inspiration for Jane Kirkpatrick's 2014 novel A Light In The Wilderness.  Early life  Carson was born into slavery in Kentucky around 1814. Little is known of her early life besides that some time before 1845, she arrived in Missouri. It is presumed that she was involved in the hemp or tobacco farming industries as a field hand, a house servant, or both. It is also presumed that she might have been either a Baptist or a Methodist and may have attended Sunday services in her owner‚Äôs church, with an all-black congregation, or both.  Life in Oregon  In 1844, she set out in a 6-month journey on the Oregon Trail for Oregon with David Carson, an Irish immigrant who owned land in Platte County and had become an American citizen in 1844. It is not clear whether Letitia was ever enslaved by David. However, by the time they began their journey to Oregon, he recognized her as a free person. On June 9, 1845, Carson gave birth to their daughter, Martha Jane somewhere along the South Platte River. Upon their arrival, the Carsons staked a 640-acre land claim in the Soap Creek Valley, located in modern-day Benton County, Oregon. Government officials reduced the Carsons' land claim by half in 1850 to 320 acres since David and Letitia could not legally marry, as Letitia was black and the Donation Land Act provided up to 640 acres for solely married couples, in addition to black people at the time being ineligible to make a land claim in Oregon. Letitia Carson gave birth to a son, Adam Andrew Jackson, in 1849. According to the 1850 U.S. Federal Census, Letitia and David lived in Benton, Oregon Territory, with their two children. = Trials over land ownership = In September 1852, David Carson died from an illness. When he died, Letitia and their children were excluded from his estate settlement, and their wealthy white neighbor Greenberry Smith was named executor of his estate instead. Smith claimed that Carson and the children were slaves who \\"were themselves property and therefore could not be heirs to the estate.\\" For her children's benefit, Carson filed a lawsuit and took Smith to court to recover an equitable portion of David's estate, stating that David Carson had promised \\"he would make me his sole heir or that he would give me his entire property\\" in the event of his death, even though this was not ever put into writing. She asked that the court award her $7,450 as compensation for her seven years of work on the Soap Creek Valley claim, \\"plus the value of livestock and other property to which she claimed she was entitled.\\" On May 12, 1855, Carson was awarded $300 by a Benton County Jury, plus $229.50 to pay her court costs. On October 25, 1856, a federal court awarded her $1399.75 for the loss of her cattle. Although she won both of these lawsuits, her accomplishments were not acknowledged in the local press at the time. During or after the federal trial, Carson moved with her children to the upper Cow Creek Valley of Douglas County, Oregon, where she worked as a midwife who was well known among community members. Oregon became a state and adopted its 1857 Constitution in 1859, which stated that blacks were banned from migrating to the area. The Constitution also enforced the ban on property ownership, voting rights, and the right to sue in court to black residents in the area. In 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed the Homestead Act, and the law changed to not ban homesteaders based on race. On June 17, 1863, Carson then filed a 160-acre claim under the Homestead Act of 1862 on South Myrtle Creek in Douglas County, Oregon as a widow and single mother of two children Her claim was certified on October 1, 1869 by President Ulysses S. Grant. Her claim was one of the first 71 homestead claims to ever be certified in the United States, and she was the only black woman to successfully file an Oregon claim under the act. Carson spent the rest of her life on her claim. Today, South Myrtle Creek is known as Letitia Creek. She built \\"a two-story house, a barn, [and] smokehouse\\" on the property, which also included a fruit orchard, which according to the 1870 Census lists her real estate and personal property value at $1,000 and $625, respectively. Carson lived another 20 years on her property before she died at the age of 73 or 74 on February 2, 1888, and was buried at Stephens Cemetery in Myrtle Creek, Oregon. The Letitia Carson Pioneer Apple Tree was named after her by researchers who completed a cultural resource inventory of the property owned by Oregon State University. = Daughter Martha Jane Carson = Carson's daughter, Martha Jane, moved to the Umatilla Indian Reservation in 1886. On November 26, 1864, Martha gave birth to a daughter, Mary Alice Bingham, presumed to be the daughter of Solomon Bingham who also lived in Douglas County during this time. Martha had ten more children with her husband Narcisse Lavadour, whom she married on January 19, 1868; Narcisse's father was a retired Hudson's Bay Company employee and his mother was from the Walla Walla tribe . He claimed an allotment of land on the Umatilla Reservation. Martha and Narcisse's children were Agnes (1870‚Äì1941), Ira (1872‚Äìn.d.), Ada (1873‚Äìn.d.), Albert (1875‚Äìn.d.); Ida Ethel (1877‚Äìn.d.),Fred (1879‚Äìn.d.), Millie (1883‚Äìn.d.), Nelson (1886‚Äìn.d.), Grace (1888‚Äìn.d.), and Thomas (1890‚Äìn.d.). A year after Narcisse's death in 1893, Martha married Charles Carpenter. After divorcing him in 1910, Martha died on July 17, 1911, at the age of 66. She was buried at the Athena Cemetery in Umatilla County, Oregon. = Son Adam ‚ÄúAndrew Jackson‚Äù Carson = Carson's son, Adam ‚ÄúAndrew Jackson‚Äù, farmed in the Canyonville area and was known for his skill as horse trainer. He never married and lived in Douglas County nearly his entire life until his death on September 14, 1922 at the age of 73. He was buried at the Stephens Cemetery, Myrtle Creek, Douglas County, Oregon, next to his mother.  Legacy  Carson is the heroine of Jane Kirkpatrick's 2014 historical fiction novel, A Light In The Wilderness. The novel chronicles her relationship with David Carson, journey to Oregon, and legal battle with Greenberry Smith.

Hemphill was born in Atlantic City, New Jersey. His father, Herbert W. Hemphill, Sr., was a businessman who had made his fortune with a fleet of wicker rolling chairs on the Atlantic City boardwalk; his mother, Emma Bryant Bradley Hemphill, was the niece of William Clark Bradley. She died when her son was ten. She collected Dresden china, which fired in him his own interest in collecting. As a youth he accumulated marbles, stamps, duck decoys, puzzle jugs, and glass bottles. For a time he lived in Columbus, Georgia, where he attended the Wynnton School. Later he attended the Lawrenceville School and the Solebury School, where he evinced an interest in art and theater. In 1948 he spent time at Bard College working with Stefan Hirsch. Hemphill moved to New York City in 1949 to begin a career as an artist, but he quickly found himself more at home with collecting. He began by acquiring African sculpture, moving to the field of modern European and American Art, and ultimately came to focus on folk art, inspired by the example of such collectors as Abby Aldrich Rockefeller and Jean Lipman. In the early 1950s he focused on early American weathervanes, portraits, watercolors, and furniture, and in 1956 he purchased a pair of non-traditional cigar store Indians from an auction of the collection amassed by Rudolph Haffenreffer. His interest in Americana was heightened by reading the work of Jean Lipman. He was one of six founders, collectors and dealers, of the Museum of Early American Folk Art in 1961; the others were Adele Earnest, Cordelia Hamilton, Marian Willard, Burt Martinson, and Arthur Bullowa. The following year he co- organized its inaugural exhibition; he also donated a Flag Gate of c. 1876 as the first object in the permanent collection, and in 1964 he became the institution's first full-time curator, spending the following decade developing a slate of widely respected exhibitions and other programs. In 1968 artists and collectors Michael and Julie Hall introduced Hemphill to Edgar Tolson, a meeting which he would later describe as an epiphany. Its result was that he began to consider purchasing the work of living folk artists for his own collection, which grew in its ethnic and national diversity. This culminated in the 1970 exhibition, \\"Twentieth-Century Folk Art\\", and the book Twentieth-Century Folk Art and Artists, co-authored with Julia Weissman, in 1974. Both would go on to influence several generations of collectors, dealers, curators, and critics in their attitudes towards folk art. Indeed, so influential was Hemphill that in 1982 he was named \\"Mr. American Folk Art\\" by Connoisseur magazine. Hemphill was noted to be unable to pass a display of unusual or noteworthy items without stopping to browse. Other collectors came to refer to the sort of work he championed as \\"Hemphill things\\", and it was sometimes said that he had a \\"360-degree eye\\". Artists represented in his collection of nearly 3,000 items included Mart√≠n Ram√≠rez, Howard Finster, Jon Serl, Bessie Harvey, Sister Gertrude Morgan, and Joseph Yoakum. Between 1973 and 1990 twenty-five American museums featured portions of Hemphill's collection on exhibit, and in 1976 some pieces were shown in Japan under the auspices of the American Bicentennial Commission. Starting in 1967 he began curating shows with Mary Black, and two years later he mounted his first independent show. An active trustee emeritus and member of the Collections Committee at the American Folk Art Museum, he was a regular donor to collections around the United States; most notably, between 1986 and 1998 more than six hundred works from his collection entered the holdings of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, which celebrated the acquisition with a 1990 exhibition and catalogue, Made with Passion: The Hemphill Folk Art Collection. In 1976 Hemphill organized the exhibition \\"Folk Sculpture USA\\" at the Brooklyn Museum; he consulted on a wide variety of exhibitions during his career, being named a guest curator at the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum in 1980. 1989 saw him become one of the founding members of the national advisory board of the Folk Art Society of America, a position he occupied until his death. In 1990 he received the Society's first annual Award of Distinction. In 1987 he received the James Smithson Society Founder medal from the Smithsonian Institution. He lectured widely, at such venues as the Smithsonian Institution and the Library of Congress as well as various universities. Hemphill died of heart failure in New York City. Two of his own artworks reside in the collection of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, a Portrait of Hermine Katz, Atlantic City, of 1949 and a Chandelier of unknown date. Also in the collection is a 1978 portrait of Hemphill by Howard Finster, THE HERBERT WADE HEMPHILL J.R. COLLECTION FOUNDER OF AMERICAN FOLK ART THE MAN WHO PRESERVES THE LONE AND FORGOTTEN. THE UNKNOWN COLLECTION, whose title is taken in part from the Folk Art Society's statement upon awarding him the Award of Distinction, in which he was described as \\"the man who preserves the lone and forgotten\\". Another portrait of Hemphill, by Malcah Zeldis and dated 1990, is in the collection of the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum.

He was best known for his work in New Confucianism and his theories which attempt to fusion Marxism and Chinese culture. Early life Fang Keli was born in June 1938 in Xiangtan, Hunan, China. His father, , was a historian and professor at Wuhan University. His mother was a chief-leader of Women's Work, also at Wuhan University. Fang said that, ‚Äú[he] was, naturally, influenced by [his] family‚Äôs tradition both intellectually and culturally. But growing up [Fang] was influenced more greatly by the historical period, the collective life in school and the education [he] got from the Communist Party and [his] teachers.‚Äù Later, the influence of history and Communism would greatly affect Fang's work. As a student Fang earned high marks and was a leader in both the Young Pioneers and the Communist Youth League. One year prior to his enrollment at Renmin University, the Anti-Rightist campaign began and Fang was disciplined by the Communist Youth League for undisclosed reasons. He cites this as an ‚Äúimportant turning point in [his] life.‚Äù In 1958, Fang was sent to work in rural Beijing where he would partake in hard labor for six months. In July 1962, he graduated from Renmin University's philosophy department. Then, between 1964 and 1965, Fang participated in the Four Clean-ups of the Socialist Education Movement. In 1969, Fang was made to enroll in the cadre's school at the People's University in Jiangxi province where he would become an active worker and gain first-hand experience with social reform. During these formative years, Fang would learn a crucial lesson about practice and its role in apprehending a greater level of understanding. Career Fang published his first major work, The Theory of the Unity of Knowing and Doing in Chinese Philosophical History, in 1982. It was one of the first books concerning Chinese philosophy to be published after the Cultural Revolution. As the title suggests, the seminal work dealt largely with topics addressed in Mao Zedong‚Äôs On Practice and was generally favorable towards Marxism. Fang‚Äôs interests were broad through the early 1980s, a time which saw the scholar making contributions in such topics as the distinction between Chinese concepts of ‚ÄúTao‚Äù and ‚ÄúQi.‚Äù The latter half of the 1980s, continuing into the 1990s marked a new phase in which ruxue began to receive consideration as a means of ‚Äúsinicizing‚Äù Marxism in China.Makeham, John. Lost Soul: \\"Confucianism\\" in Contemporary Chinese Academic Discourse. Published by the Harvard University Asia Center for the Harvard-Yenching Institute, 2008. Fang would play a crucial role in this movement and it was during this time that Fang would make his bones. In 1986, Fang, then working at Nankai University in Tianjin, helped to found an academic group of over 50 researchers which studied Contemporary New Confucianism, or Contemporary New Ru Learning (Dangdai xin ruxue).Ro≈°ker, Jana S. Modern Confucianism and Chinese Theories of Modernization, 2015. This undertaking would span a decade's time, making it the most costly and extensive humanities project ever sponsored by China's Ministry of Education.Swain, New Ru Learning From 1994 to 2000 Fang served as President of the Graduate School of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. He was elected an academician of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in 2006.  Philosophy  The 1986 research team would lead Fang to conclude that, as of the May 4th Movement, New Ru Learning, Marxism and Western liberalism were most prominent schools of thought in the nation.Tongqi, Lin, et al. ‚ÄúChinese Philosophy: A Philosophical Essay on the ‚ÄòState-of-the-Art.‚Äô‚Äù The Journal of Asian Studies, vol. 54, no. 3, 1995, pp. 727‚Äì758. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/2059449. This equivocation of New Ru Learning and Marxism pushed the former to an elevated status in the public eye, despite Fang's protests. Contrary to the public clamor for New Ru Learning, Fang saw ruxue as a fundamentally feudal ideology‚Äîthough he still believed there was historical and cultural value to be derived from it. He explained that all ideologies, their predecessors and their successors function within the context of one another. In this way all ideas retain a level of relevance. Fang championed the idea of critical inheritance, which he developed from the philosophy of his contemporary, Zhang Dainian. Though similar ideas had been promulgated as early as the old Chinese idiom, develop what is positive and discard what is negative (qu zao qu jing), Zhang's rendition was different in that it factored the West into its equation. Zhang sought to first divide traditional Chinese culture into its dross and its essence, its worthy and unworthy, then to do the same with Western culture and synthesize the two to achieve a ‚Äòsynthetic creation.‚Äô Of this, Fang said: > ‚ÄúI personally accepted the cultural propositions of the school of > comprehensive innovation represented by Mr. Zhang, and I summarized the > basic ideas of this school in the following words: to make the past serve > the present; to make foreign things serve China; to be critical of > inheritance and comprehensively innovate.‚Äù Fang sought to combine Chinese culture with Marxism and thereby create an improved society. Relative to some of his peers, he was quite moderate and condemned more essentialist positions: > ‚Äú‚Ä¶I approve of the theory of cultural comprehensive innovation instead of > ‚ÄúCultural Radicalism‚Äù or ‚ÄúCultural Conservatism‚Äù. Based on this kind of > cultural standpoint, I believe that the way of ‚Äúwholesale Westernization‚Äù > and ‚Äúthe revival of Confucianism‚Äù will go nowhere in China.‚Äù Fang did not wish for a revival of Ruism, nor did he want China to be thoroughly Westernized. Delving further into Zhang's model of synthetic creation, Fang laid out four tenets for cultural application. Firstly, one must have an open mindset which is malleable and thoughtful. Second, neither Chinese culture nor Western culture should be overly dominant. For synthesis, it is important to keep Chinese tradition and to then learn from the West. Third, the manner of critical inheritance ought not to be metaphysical, but rather dialectical. Lastly, Fang likens the process to eating and digestion: one must combine unlike elements and then convert them into positive energy. Fang has taught for over 45 years at various universities. He cited teaching as his main work, ranking it above even his highly regarded work as a researcher. Fang viewed many of his research-related endeavors as ultimately serving to educate the younger generation. Conflicting perspectives For his work on the New Ru Learning project, Fang was criticized for angling towards his Marxist inclinations‚ÄîLi Minghui argued that rather than assessing New Ru Learning objectively, Fang actively worked to funnel the study into his own ideology. In 1989 Jiang Qing, a controversial Confucian thinker, published an article in which he identified the failure to revive Confucianism as China's greatest problem. He suggested that ‚ÄúConfucianism should replace Marxism, be restored to its lofty historical status, and become the orthodox thought representing the life and spirit of the Chinese nation.‚ÄùJones, David, editor. ‚ÄúA Critique of Jiang Qing‚Äôs ‚ÄòPolitical Confucianism.‚Äô‚Äù Confucianism: Its Roots and Global Significance, by Ming-Huei Lee, University of Hawai'i Press, Honolulu, 2017, pp. 102‚Äì112. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv3zp043.13. In response to Jiang, Fang offered multiple scathing reviews, all but dismissing the inclination to hold Confucianism as the ultimate ideal.

He is the Executive Director for Brazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Haiti, Panama, Philippines, Suriname and Trinidad & Tobago at the Executive Board of Directors of the World Bank Group and its Affiliates. Weintraub previously served as Minister of Education of Brazil and as investment banking executive at Banco Votorantim and is known for controversial actions of racism and mismanagement during his tenure as the head of the Ministry of Education. Biography Weintraub was born in S√£o Paulo into a Jewish father, Mauro Weintraub, and a non-Jewish mother, Mariliza Bragan√ßa de Vasconcelos, both doctors who studied at Faculty of Medicine of Sorocaba. He is a professor at the Federal University of S√£o Paulo (Unifesp), Master in Administration in Finance for Get√∫lio Vargas Foundation (FGV), and graduated in Economic Sciences at the University of S√£o Paulo (USP) in 1994. An executive of the financial market with over 20 years of experience, he acted as the lead economist and director of Banco Votorantim and as a partner in Quest Investimentos. He was a member of the transition team of the government of President Bolsonaro, and was Secretary-Executive of the Chief of Staff Onyx Lorenzoni. He became a member of Bolsonaro's transition cabinet in November 2018. =Ministry of Education= Entry On 8 April 2019, Bolsonaro appointed Weintraub as the new Minister of Education, replacing Ricardo V√©lez Rodr√≠guez. Weintraub is close to Onyx Lorenzoni, the current Chief of Staff whom he previously served as Executive-Secretary. Departure On 18 June 2020, after 14 months in office, Weintraub announced his resignation from the Ministry in a video with Bolsonaro posted on social media. On the night of the following day (19), before his exoneration was published, Weintraub traveled to the United States. To travel, Weintraub took advantage of the diplomatic passport conceded to ministers, due to the fact that the US' travel restrictions related to COVID-19 barred civilians from Brazil starting on 29 May. This was cause for controversy, as a request to the Supreme Federal Court for the apprehension of Weintraub's passport had been filed the day before he traveled, motivated by the two open investigations against him. On 20 June 2020, his resignation from the position of Minister of Education was published on the government's official journal. On 23 June 2020, the resignation date was rectified to be the previous day, 19 June 2020. The government also published a note stating that Weintraub's resignation request was only formally received after he'd already left the country, on the 20th, and that Weintraub himself requested his resignation be retroactivelly changed to the 19th. =World Bank= In July 2020, Weintraub was elected as an executive director of the World Bank for a term ending on 31 October 2020. Controversies = Racist statements = In March 2020 Weintraub was reported from a video of a meeting with President Bolsonaro openly giving hate speech against indigenous peoples. At the same meeting, Weintraub also made statements against the Chinese people. Although Weintraub is a descendant of a Jewish family, he is openly against minority rights and values. And in a contradictory way he used the word \\"people\\" to make politics against these people. = Accusations regarding drugs in universities = In November 2019, during an interview with Jornal da Cidade, Weintraub accused federal universities of cultivating cannabis and preparing methamphetamine in chemistry labs, but did not present any evidence to support his claims: After the fact, 10 state deputies of Bahia presented an interpellation, questioning Weintraub's accusations. The then-minister responded by saying that his declarations were generic and that he had no intention of accusing any specific persons. Weintraub's statements would therefore be considered as an exercise of free speech. = Emmanuel Macron = In August 2019, Weintraub wrote that the French people had elected a president \\"devoid of any character\\" and that Macron is \\"nothing but a worthless opportunist who seeks support from the French agricultural lobby\\". = Filming in class = In April 2019, Weintraub stated that the filming of teachers by students during class is a right held by the latter, calling it an \\"individual liberty\\". Responding to the minister's statements, jurists argued that the unauthorized filming of teachers in class may violate the fundamental rights of educators, and is unconstitutional. = Crack conspiracy theory = In a 2018 interview Weintraub claimed that crack was introduced to Brazil by communists in order to weaken the country. He also said that FARC, a Colombia guerilla movement, had been invited as honored guests to the Foro de S√£o Paulo, an annual gathering of Latin American leftist parties. These comments led The Guardian to brand Weintraub as a conspiracy theorist.  Spelling mistakes  On multiple occasions, the then-Minister of Education wrote incorrect or otherwise improper Portuguese, with spelling mistakes or grammatical errors, on official documents and social media. In January 2020, in a tweet to Eduardo Bolsonaro, Weintraub wrote \\"imprecionante\\" instead of \\"impressionante\\", roughly equivalent to writing \\"imprecive\\" instead of \\"impressive\\", in English.

The St. Aloysius Church is a Catholic church in Spokane, Washington, United States. It is deeply associated with Gonzaga University, a local Jesuit institute.  History  Jesuit missionaries arrived in the Pacific Northwest between 1842 and 1866. Among them was Father DeSmet, S.J. who eventually founded Gonzaga University in 1887. The first location of worship for the Jesuits who attempted to found the university was the St. Joseph church, a rudimentary wooden structure. Under the direction of Father Mackin, a project to construct a new church for the university was proposed in 1904. Due to controversy and rumors that the church would be erected without the support of resident worshipers, the project was delayed. In 1909 the project resumed under the supervision of Father Goller. The St. Joseph church was relocated and space for the new St. Aloysius church was ready for construction. Estimated cost for the building was $100,000, half of which had been promised by donors and $30,000 already collected. The first published sketch of the building appeared in the Spokesman-Review on October 10, 1909. The first cornerstone was laid on October 24. Accompanied by a ceremony with large attendance numbers, a parchment was laid inside the stone that read: \\"The First Cornerstone of this Holy Temple, Dedicated to St. Aloysius Gonzaga, was laid and blessed, in the presence of a great concourse of clergy and people, and with due solemnity, by the Rt. Rev. Edward John O‚ÄôDea, Bishop of the Diocese of Seattle. To the Greater Glory of God.\\" The final mass of the St. Joseph church was held on October 11, 1911. St. Aloysius was opened on October 12, almost two years after the construction began. Of the thousands of people that showed for the opening mass at St. Aloysius, only 200 were admitted. Celebration and a large banquet ensued for all attendees with speeches from many influential religious leaders of the time.  Architecture  The historic twin-cross steeples at the entrance of St. Aloysius Church St. Aloysius Church was designed by Preusse & Zittel of Spokane, a prominent design firm in Washington at the time. The church is described as having adapted Romanesque-style architecture. Romanesque architecture incorporates large circular windows, large doors, and vaulting ceiling and roof structures. This type of architecture attempts to emulate a Gothic ambiance. The church seems as if it has vast amounts of space and allows natural light to illuminate the space. Perhaps most important of the Romanesque-style architecture, is the priority of structural strength and solidity. St. Aloysius Church is famous for its twin steeples that can be seen from many locations across the Gonzaga University campus and Spokane. Illuminated by 40 lights, the crosses atop the steeples are meant to be seen at every hour. Inside, the church features oak woodwork, Italian marble altars, and one pipe organ. The firm responsible for designing the church‚Äôs Stations of the Cross was the Mayers‚Äô Studio of Germany. Mayers‚Äô was also tasked with designing the stained-glass windows surrounding the church that depict Jesuit saints and the life of St. Aloysius himself. In recent years, four new windows have been added.  Membership  Many Jesuits, members of the Roman Catholic church, make their home at Gonzaga University, utilizing the St. Aloysius Church as one of their primary centers of worship. Jesuits belong to the Society of Jesus, a religious order founded in 1540 by St. Ignatius of Loyola. The Jesuits serve a special role as versatile and nomadic priests trained to handle any case regarding the Church. As an organization with a firm foundation set in doctrinal practice, the Society of Jesus utilizes the Constitutions and Spiritual Exercises written by St. Ignatius. As an institution founded upon Jesuit values, Gonzaga University represents an important part of the Catholic community in Spokane. Gonzaga University and the St. Aloysius Church are overseen by the Catholic Diocese of Spokane. This particular diocese, established in 1913, encompasses an area of 24,356 square miles and includes 80 Catholic parish communities. In 2017, Gonzaga University constructed the Della Strada Jesuit Community, a religious center close to the Gonzaga campus, as an acknowledgment of the Jesuits‚Äô involvement in the academic and religious community. As part of the Della Strada community, Jesuits provide education, religious guidance, and assistance to the surrounding community.  Namesake  A statue dedicated to St. Aloysius outside the church entrance. Both Gonzaga University and St. Aloysius Church inherit their namesake from Saint Aloysius Gonzaga, the ‚ÄúPatron of Youth‚Äù and Catholic saint of enviable piety. Saint Aloysius Gonzaga lived a rather brief but impactful life, one admired by followers of Catholicism to this day. Aloysius, known at the time as Luigi de Gonzaga, was born on March 9, 1568 to a family of Italian aristocracy. Many events throughout his upbringing led him to develop a distaste for the opulent lifestyle his family led. Upon discovering a book about Jesuits, scholars and agents of the Roman Catholic religion, who were working in India, he was inspired to join their ranks as a member of the Society of Jesus. For years he struggled with his family as they tried to dissuade him of his decision, but he eventually gave up rights to his inheritance in order to pursue a life of religious devotion. A plaque detailing the life of St. Aloysius is at the foot of his memorial near the church. Aloysius Gonzaga, the Latin form of St. Aloysius‚Äôs Italian birthname, is known to have lived an incredibly pious life. His dedication led him to Rome, where he committed his time to caring for those afflicted by the plague of 1591. Despite his superiors‚Äô wishes, he continued to tend to the sick and eventually contracted the plague, which led to his death at the age of 23 on June 21, 1591.

Delaney MD, MCh, PhD, FRCSI, FACS, FASCRS, FRCSI (Hon.) is an Irish- American colorectal surgeon, CEO and President of the Cleveland Clinic Florida Region, and Professor of Surgery at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine. He was previously Chairman of the Digestive Disease & Surgery Institute (DDSI) at the Cleveland Clinic. He is both a Fellow and Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and a Fellow of both the American College of Surgeons and American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons. Delaney's research contributions include various aspects of surgery, surgical cost-efficiency and surgical education, while his clinical research contributions include developing enhanced recovery pathways in minimally invasive laparoscopic colorectal surgery, carcinoma of the colon and rectum, Crohn's disease and Ulcerative colitis, sphincter-saving surgery, re-operative abdominal surgery, and colonoscopy.  Education  Delaney earned his medical degree from the University College of Dublin School of Medicine in 1989, winning the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital gold medal in surgery. In 1992, he became a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and earned his master's degree in surgery (MCh) in 1994. He earned his Ph.D. in 2000 from UCD, originally moving to the United States to work under Thomas Starzl, the father of transplant surgery, and John Fung, at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in the areas of immunology, hepatobiliary disease and transplantation, as he planned to become a liver transplant surgeon.  Career  Delaney joined the Cleveland Clinic in 1999 on a one-year surgical fellowship to train with Victor Fazio. He was appointed an attending staff member in 2000, where he was a member of the departments of Colorectal Surgery and Minimally Invasive Surgery until 2005 when he was recruited to serve as chief of the Division of Colorectal Surgery and vice-chairman of the Department of Surgery at University Hospitals Case Medical Center and Case Western Reserve University, where he was Professor of Surgery for 10 years. In 2014, he was appointed as interim chair of the Department of Surgery at University Hospitals Case Medical Center and interim surgeon-in-chief of the University Hospitals Health System, while maintaining his role as chief of the division of colorectal surgery and surgical director of the UH Digestive Health Institute. In 2015, Delaney was recruited to be the Chairman of the Digestive Disease and Surgery Institute (DDSI) at the Cleveland Clinic and has held the Victor W. Fazio MD Endowed Chair in Colorectal Surgery since 2016. As the chairman of the Clinic's Digestive Disease and Surgery Institute, Delaney oversees 800 employees, including more than 185 staff physicians working at the institute and manages the following clinical areas across all Cleveland Clinic locations globally: acute care/trauma surgery, bariatric surgery, breast surgery, colorectal surgery, gastroenterology, general surgery, hepatology, hepato-pancreato-biliary surgery, nutrition, pediatric surgery, and transplant surgery. In 2019, the Digestive Disease and Surgery Institute was ranked #2 nationally by U.S. News & World Report for gastroenterology and GI surgery. Delaney was listed as a possible successor to Dr. Toby Cosgrove as the CEO of the Cleveland Clinic while the Chairman of the Digestive Disease and Surgery Institute in 2017. In 2020, Delaney was appointed as CEO and President of Cleveland Clinic Florida region. The region includes five hospital, a state-of-the-art research center, and numerous outpatient centers located in five counties across Southeast Florida.  Research  Delaney has published more than 350 manuscripts, 15 books, and many book chapters in scientific journals related to surgical education, colon and rectal cancer surgery, minimally invasive laparoscopic colorectal surgery, re-operative abdominal surgery, peri-operative care for intestinal surgery, and inflammatory bowel disease and diverticulitis. As of October 2020, Delaney has been cited 19,530 times and has a h-index of 77. He has been on the editorial board for 14 journals, including Diseases of the Colon & Rectum, World Journal of Surgery, The American Journal of Surgery, Techniques in Coloproctology, and Polish Journal of Surgery, and has acted as an invited reviewer for every major surgical journal. Delaney has delivered over 300 invited lectures internationally. = Clinical research = Delaney's clinical contributions include work in minimally invasive laparoscopic colorectal surgery to enhance recovery, of which he has demonstrated associated short and long-term cost- savings. His other work includes patient quality of life, surgical education, procedures for carcinomas of the colon and rectum, sphincter-saving surgery, re-operative abdominal surgery, Crohn's disease and Ulcerative colitis, and colonoscopy. Delaney has developed various enhanced recovery pathways after surgery since an initial publication by his team on \\"Fast-track\\" surgery in 2001, which when combined with less-invasive surgery, have cut hospital stays for colorectal resection to two and a half days on average. = Cost- efficiency research = Delaney has had a major focus on work relating to cost-efficiency and value in healthcare, as well as surgical quality, which led to his invention of an affordable quality metric called the HARM Score.  HARM Score  Delaney developed the HARM Score, standing for (H)ospit(A)l stay, (R)eadmission, and (M)ortality, to accurately measure patient outcomes and quality of care inexpensively, as an alternative for hospitals not participating in the foremost National Surgical Quality improvement Program (NSQIP) because of expense and complexity. Using routinely captured data, the HARM Score decreased administrative costs associated with quality care improvement programs, while being almost universally applicable regardless of the size of the hospital. The HARM score has since been assessed and validated by others on bariatric patients, prompting the creation of the BAR-HARM score.  Innovation  = Patents = Delaney holds five patents for medical devices, techniques, and processes.  * = Socrates Analytics, Inc. = In 2012, Delaney founded a software company called Socrates Analytics, Inc. to help hospitals and physicians collect and analyze hospital billing, administrative and operating room data. Socrates automated the collection of information stored across a number of data systems to allow hospitals to capture entire episodes of patient care, integrating disparate hospital administrative software systems to facilitate reporting on operational metrics. He created the venture while Chief of the Division of Colorectal Surgery at UH Case Medical Center, seeking to find what factors truly drove cost in the operating room and were associated with readmissions within 30 days of discharge. Delaney was quoted saying, \\"Socrates gives hospitals the opportunity to interpret complex administrative data and view trends, outliers and variability in the process, so they can improve their efficiency and terms of care.\\" Delaney recruited a former McKesson executive, Jim Evans, to be the company's Chief Executive Officer. Socrates attracted over $1.5 million in capital and established several national distribution partnerships.  Honors and awards  In 2001, Delaney was chosen to deliver the 24th Millin Lecture and awarded the prestigious Millin Medal by Royal College of Surgeons Ireland,http://www.rcsi.ie/files/newsevents/docs/20180523040006_Milin%20Meeting%20Programme%202017_F.pdf named in honor of Terence Millin, the late Irish surgeon. RCSI President Kenneth Mealy (left) and Professor Deborah McNamara (right) Delaney was recognized as the Jeffrey L. Ponsky MD Endowed Professor of Surgical Education at Case Western Reserve University in 2009, the inaugural Murdough Master Clinician in Colorectal Surgery in 2011, and the Victor W. Fazio MD Endowed Chair in Colorectal Surgery at the Cleveland Clinic in 2016.https://www.sgna.org/Portals/0/DDSI_Week_2019_brochure_FINAL2.pdf?ver=2019-01-29-160413-257 Delaney is past President of the International Society of Laparoscopic Colorectal Surgery and the Midwest Surgical Association. He has also been the Treasurer of the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons and has previously received awards from the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland, as well as from colorectal societies in Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Brazil, and across North America.https://www.fascrs.org/sites/default/files/images/PDFs/delaney_short_bio_.pdf In September 2018, Delaney was invited to deliver the keynote address at the 43rd Sir Peter Freyer Memorial Lecture and Surgical Symposium in Galway, Ireland. In December 2018, Delaney was awarded an Honorary Fellowship from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. He was the second person to be awarded an Honorary Fellowship, the highest distinction the College has to offer, who had already received a Fellowship from the Royal College, for his work as a \\"leading international figure in the field of coloproctology.\\" Delaney is highlighted in the EPIC Museum of Irish Emigration in Dublin, Ireland, having \\"emigrated from Ireland and found success as a physician abroad.\\"  Personal life  Delaney is married to Clare Delaney and has two children, Michelle and Peter. His father, Dr. Peter V. Delaney, was a colorectal surgeon, fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, and founder of an annual fixture on the Irish surgical calendar, the Sylvester O'Halloran Perioperative Symposium and meeting. In the acknowledgement for his book, Delaney credits his father, Peter, \\"whose love of surgery and its ability to help others led [Conor] to this field.\\" Delaney's maternal great-grandfather was Edward Peter O'Kelly, who served two terms as a Member of the British House of Commons.

The mountain is situated on the crest of the Cascade Range, on the shared border of Snohomish County and Chelan County, and also straddling the boundary between Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest and Wenatchee National Forest. Its nearest higher peak is Glacier Peak, to the north. Precipitation runoff and melt-water from the White River Glacier on the southeast slope drains into White River. On the west slope, the White Chuck Glacier drains into the White Chuck River, and the Suiattle Glacier and Honeycomb Glacier on the north and east sides drain into the Suiattle River. Surrounded by these glaciers, Fred Beckey in his Cascade Alpine Guide describes the mountain as being almost a nunatak. Geology The North Cascades feature some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. Glacier Peak, a stratovolcano that is north of Kololo Peaks, began forming in the mid-Pleistocene.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. Climate Kololo Peaks is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift).Looking down at Kololo Peaks from Glacier Peak As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above .Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger.

His first exhibition at the Salon came in 1796 and he would continue to exhibit there until his death. In 1802, he was awarded the Prix de Rome for his depiction of Julius Sabinus and Epponina before Vespasian. From 1802 to 1806, he is listed as a pensioner at the Academy of France in Rome, a period when young French artists were in a rather tenuous position due to the former occupation of Rome by the French Army. By 1808, when the French had occupied Rome again, he was back in Paris and presented a painting at the Salon that showed King Henry IV having a drink with a humble miller named Michaud. It was a great success and he subsequently focused on scenes from French, rather than Classical history. He received several commissions from the Imperial Family.

He was listed number 5 on the government's most wanted and forced into exile in the United States over his role in the student movement. Zhou attained his MBA degree from University of Chicago Booth School of Business and had been working in the finance industry in recent years. He is currently the president of Humanitarian China and Co-founder of the China Human Rights Accountability Center.  Early life and education  Zhou was born in Xi'an, Shaanxi, China on October 5, 1967. He attended Tsinghua University in 1985 and majored in physics. Zhou was elected to be a leader of the Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation in 1989. Due to his active engagement of the student-led pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989, Zhou was arrested and imprisoned for a year. He left China in 1995 for the United States, where he studied analytic finance and accounting, and earned his MBA degree from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business in 1998.

Shortly after the bloody crackdown, known as the June fourth incident, Zhou was listed as number five on the government's wanted list and was soon arrested from his home in Xi'an. Allegedly, Zhou's sister and her husband turned him in to the police. Zhou was then imprisoned in Qincheng for a year. He was released in 1990 due to international support.  Post-Tiananmen Square  After being released from Qincheng, Zhou was exiled to Yangyuan, Hebei for a year. Zhou's involvement in the protests also led to legal complications that prevented him from getting his passport for years. Amid constant monitoring and police harassment, sometimes with friends whose experiences had been similar to his own, Zhou struggled to earn a living. = Immigration to the United States = In 1995, Zhou moved to the United States with no prospect in returning home legally. He graduated with honors and received his MBA degree from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business in 1998. He became a Christian in 2003 and has worked in finance in recent years.

This was the first of many lawsuits in United States filed against the officials of the Chinese Communist Party. In an interview with South China Morning Post, Zhou stated that he still believed the core issues being protested back in 1989 remain unresolved, such as government corruptions. ‚ÄúThere is pretty much a consensus today in China that government officials should disclose their assets,‚Äù he said. The past 25 years have proven ‚Äúthat the massacre was for this small fraction of families that control China, not for the general well-being of the Chinese. If you look at the people who were hardliners 25 years ago, they are all billionaires now.\\" Zhou became the President of Chinese Democracy Education Foundation in an effort to promote \\"the prosperity and progress of Chinese society for democracy, freedom and human rights.\\" (2007-2010).

On April 3rd, 2019, Zhou joined a panel discussion at Wesleyan University on the May Fourth Movement in 1919 and the Tiananmen Square Protests in 1989. He stated, \\"For our generation, it was the biggest event. I feel lucky to have been a part. Most remember only the bloodshed and the massacre, but what people really need to remember is what had happened before the crackdown. It was the one time I experienced the beautiful character of the Chinese people longing for a democratic China, where we could freely speak our minds.\\" = Secret trip back to China = On the twenty-fifth anniversary of the June Fourth crackdown, Zhou, now a US citizen, took advantage of China‚Äôs policy of allowing 72-hour transit stops without a visa and managed to slip into the country briefly, even though Beijing took extreme measures to prevent public observances. While driving in a loop with his friend in Tiananmen Square, Zhou resisted his temptation to carry out a public protest, fearing that he would be quickly muzzled and \\" would be gone in a minute.\\" Zhou said he showed solidarity by paying a visit to his friend Gao Yu, a former reporter who wrote about the Tiananmen Protests and was jailed, alongside human rights lawyer Pu Zhiqiang, at the detention center. Zhou faced no problem when he identified himself at the reception; later police came to his hotel on the pretext of searching for drugs and interrogated him at length. He was then put on a flight back to the United States, Zhou said. Zhou revealed that prior to this visit, he had previously visited China on two other occasions in which no friends nor family knew of his plans beforehand. In response to his recent episode, Zhou acknowledged that a future visit might be much more difficult. = Censorship by LinkedIn and Zoom = In January 2019, LinkedIn sent Zhou a message, saying although the company \\"strongly supports freedom of expression,\\" his profile and activities would not be viewable to users in China because of \\"specific content on your profile.\\" Hours later, Linkedin reversed its decision and Zhou's profile was quickly restored on the Chinese platform after a wave of negative publicity. On June 1 2020, Zoom closed Zhou's paid account a week after he held an event discussing the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.

Widely regarded as the most influential Kant scholar in China, Mou's rigorous critique of Kant‚Äôs philosophy‚Äîhaving translated all three of Kant‚Äôs critiques‚Äîserved as an ardent attempt to reconcile Chinese and Western philosophy whilst increasing pressure to westernize in China. Following his teacher Xiong Shili, Mou attempted to justify a moral metaphysics.‚Ä¢ Bunnin, Nicholas. \\"God's Knowledge And Ours: Kant And Mou Zongsan On Intellectual Intuition.\\" Journal of Chinese Philosophy 35.4 (2008): 613-24. Print. He attempted to do this in large part by critiquing Kantian concepts such as moral nature, moral feeling, intellectual intuition, thing-in-itself, and the division between noumena and phenomena. Moral metaphysics =Moral nature= Mou seeks to establish a moral metaphysics in Kantian terms by attempting to disprove that there can only be a metaphysics of morals. In a moral metaphysics, since ontology and morality are so closely related, humans must have intellectual intuition to see the things they know, including ourselves, to have moral value.‚Ä¢ Bunnin, Nicholas. \\"God's Knowledge And Ours: Kant And Mou Zongsan On Intellectual Intuition.\\" Journal of Chinese Philosophy 35.4 (2008): 613-24. Print. Kant was unable to justify a moral law because of the limitedness of human condition, specifically the lack of human intellectual intuition and to postulate free-will as something beyond human grasp. What Kant should have done, according to Mou, was to establish the existence of a free-will and exploring practical consequences further. Accordingly, Mou urges readers to ‚Äúdismiss Kant‚Äôs mistaken approach and follow Confucian terms such as heart-mind, ‚ÄòGood knowledge,‚Äô and [regard] intellectual intuition as another term for self-transcendence‚Äîa term that is more concerned with connection between human beings that is more fundamental than mere self-identity.\\" The heart-minds of all humans are all essentially one and this oneness transcends individual particularity. Thus, it seems as though Mou argues for a morality tied to non-individuality: a connection with others that precedes the ground of individual self-identity. In making distinctions between the noumena and phenomena instead of realizing the heart- mind, or trying to prove the existence of free-will instead of accepting its existence, shows that Kant is only concerned with the individual, which denies access to his own morality. Thus Kant missed the impact of self-transforming experience of moral action because of a concept of man that defies self- transcendence. As Nick Bunin explained, ‚ÄúKant displaces the moral self, the rational will, the value of things, and the reward for culture to a noumena world that we cannot know. In just the way it is most important to know ourselves and others we are cut off from knowledge. The ‚Äòabsolute otherness of the other‚Äô is complemented on this view by the absolute otherness of myself as a moral agent.‚Äù Under Kant‚Äôs system Mencius‚Äôs parable on the child on the well will also fail because of the \\"lack connection between human beings that is more fundamental to their Selves,\\" and thus be unable to 'truly' experience shock to my Self (Ëá™ÊàëÈúáÂãï), an awakening to my Self (È©öÈÜí) and a self-confirmation of myself (Ëá™ËÇØË™çÂÖ∂Ëá™Â∑±). As scholar Schmidt wrote, ‚ÄúSince for Mou intellectual intuition is just another name for self-transcendence, we can infer from here what is being transcended in this moment: the atomistic isolation of the individual, which is but an abstraction from every person‚Äôs own true moral Self.‚Äù On the clinging to self image of the mere individual, Schmidt continued, ‚Äù‚Ä¶in Western philosophy, this clinging has been institutionalized in the concept of the (epistemological) subject or Cogito‚Äîour self- transcendence and indeed the whole moral dimension of our being remains opaque. We do not reach what New Confucians call awareness of our own moral nature (Ëá™Ë¶∫).‚Äù =Limitation of Kant‚Äôs theory of moral feeling= Kant seeks to find a moral law based exclusively on reason and not on feelings because the variability in degrees would make it impossible to determine a uniform moral standard. However, Kant still allows feeling to play a role in his search for a moral law. First, he divides feelings into two categories: (i) pathological feelings and (ii) moral feelings: pathological feelings precede the thought of law while moral feeling can only follow after the thought of the law. Although neither sorts of feelings can stand as grounds for a moral law because it is not based on reason, Kant believed a kind of moral feeling, specifically the ‚Äôrespect‚Äô for moral feeling to be worthy of further investigation. For Kant, unlike pathological feelings, ‚Äòrespect‚Äô for the law does not Arise out of external influence and is ‚Äúself-wrought by rational concept.\\" However, this respect for the law is not the basis of a moral law, it instead represents ‚Äúthe consciousness that my will is subordinate to a law, without the intervention of other influences on my sense.‚Äù For Kant, moral feeling is the incentive (Bewegungsgrund) to follow moral law and should not be undermined. Yet he categorizes this feeling under empirical happiness because ‚Äúevery empirical interest promises to contribute to the well-being by the agreeableness that a thing affords, whether profit be regarded.‚Äù On this matter Mou disagrees with Kant, and believes that by putting moral feeling on par with happiness Kant misses the whole essence of moral feeling entirely. According to Mou, there is not only empirical moral feeling but also transcendental moral feeling, and it is in this form of moral feeling that incentive (Bewegungsgrund) for moral law can be found. On this transcendental moral feeling Mou writes: Mou is reticent to assign moral feeling as the basis for moral law, but he introduces a new meaning to moral feeling calling it ‚Äúthe transcendental dynamic ground for the realization of morals.‚Äù Intellectual intuition Mou claimed in Phenomena and Thing-in-Itself ÁèæË±°ËàáÁâ©Ëá™Ë∫´ (1975) that ‚Äúif it is true that human beings cannot have intellectual intuition, then the whole of Chinese philosophy must collapse completely, and the thousands years of effort must be in vain. It is just an illusion.‚Äù Through his investigation of Kant‚Äôs intellectual intuition Mou strives not only to overcome Kant but to establish that Chinese philosophy is superior. In Kant‚Äôs terms, human beings are limited (ÊúâÈôê) in that they do not have intellectual intuition (Êô∫ÁöÑÁõ¥Ë¶∫) and therefore have no access to the thing-in- itself (Áâ©Ëá™Ë∫´). Accordingly Mou is tasked with going beyond Kant, where he claims human beings are limitless(ÁÑ°Èôê)‚Äîthat they do have intellectual intuition and therefore are indeed able to grasp things-in-themselves. In Kant, things as they are in themselves are not transcendent objects residing in a realm beyond the reach of human reason. The thing in itself is not a thing at all, but a notion that has to be presupposed from the standpoint of (finite) human reason. Therefore, one cannot argue for a particular kind of faculty that provides access to it. By presenting his concept of intellectual ‚Äòintuition‚Äô Mou seems to argue for a faculty that Kant had overlooked or misunderstood, but his whole argument ultimately rests on a change of meaning of what the thing in itself is (see below). Mou‚Äôs motives for holding that human beings have intellectual intuition lies in Confucian thinking of moral transformation and attainment of happiness. The Confucian concept of moral transformation, a process where a small person can transcend himself into a gentlemen and to a sage, rests on the principle that we are able to know our motives and will that allow for such transformation. In contrast, Kant denies that we can have intellectual intuition of things-in-themselves, even of oneself. This is further elucidated in Bunin‚Äôs God‚Äôs Knowledge and Ours: Kant and Mou Zongsan on Intellectual Intuition: For Mou, Kant‚Äôs philosophy rests on the assumption of man‚Äôs limitedness (‰∫∫‰πãÊúâÈôêÊÄß), and to go beyond this Mou argues although man is limited, these limits can be overcome / he can become limitless (‰∫∫ÈõñÊúâÈôêËÄåÂèØÁÑ°Èôê). This recalls not only the Confucian notion of moral transformation but also the attainment of virtue (ÊàêÂæ∑), both of which necessarily require us to be able to know our motives and will as said above. However, for Mou, it is not a question of why humans can overcome limitedness, but why the West failed to develop this simple human characteristic. Simply put, it was the Western understanding of man as God‚Äôs creature, or more so, as a negative reflection of God‚Äôs unerring qualities that inherently limited man‚Äôs being. Confucian transcendence was not possible because in the West it was labeled as ‚Äòdivine‚Äô and something off limits for moral humans. This deeply embedded belief lead to the lack of intellectual intuition in Kant's philosophy. Mou concluded that Kant had played within the confines of Christian dogma with an implication of absolute distinction between man and God, and viewed man as a limited being. For Mou, this is not only a reflection of Kant‚Äôs limitedness in his philosophy but of Western philosophy as a whole. Things-in-themselves, noumena and phenomena Kant theorized that (1) only God can have knowledge of noumena because he possesses intellectual intuition and (2) God only creates noumena, not appearances. Mou praised this distinction of noumena and phenomena and deemed it to involve one of the most profound metaphysical questions. However, Mou claimed that the problem with the division between noumena and phenomena, especially the negative conception of noumena (the inability to be known by humans) is due to an unclear understanding of thing-in-itself. Further, Mou claimed the distinction can only be understood if the concept of things-in- themselves are understood as evaluative rather than factual. This maneuver allows for the justification for the existence of things-in-themselves as practical and not as a postulate, and calls for the possibility for moral laws. This is important because the existence of moral laws can only be justified practically in the dimension of practical reason. Practical justification of things-in-themselves have subjective necessity because they are out of this practical necessity‚Äîthat is, as autonomous, phenomenal beings, how much moral laws matter to us and our propensity to follow them is grounds for the existence of it. Thus, the conception of things-in-themselves that is limited (inaccessible) to us through theoretical reason becomes positive in practical reason. As Mou says, ‚Äúmuch theoretical reason cannot affirm the objective reality of freedom, God, and the soul\\". Mou arrives this position because Confucian thinking has been dominated by a concern for moral agency (ÈÅìÂæ∑Ë°åÁÇ∫) and the attainment of virtue (ÊàêÂæ∑) and therefore by practical problems in a sense that the Western tradition has failed to grasp. This can be seen from the absence of the concept of gongfu (Â∑•Â§´) in Western concepts, that is, the individual ‚Äúmoral effort‚Äù that realizes moral values through human agency. Scholar Stephen Schmidt writes about gongfu (Â∑•Â§´) saying: Wing-Cheuk Chan writes that it is at this juncture that Mou reiterates the need for Confucianism because it grants intellectual intuition to the human being and the noumena becomes accessible. Giving things-in-themselves a theoretical meaning limits the capacity for humans to know it, but practical reason validates its value and infinitude. Thus, when the human mind becomes infinite in Confucian terms, all beings are given as things-in-themselves. For Mou, the precarious basis of the distinction between noumena and phenomena can be solved through the Confucian perception of man having the ability to transcend himself though moral transformation. Criticism Scholars argue that Mou‚Äôs translations of Kantian terms are not accurate reflections of the original meanings in German because all of Mou's works were translated from English. Stephan Schmidt, for example, notes the term Anschauung, rendered in English as intuition as a misleading translation because anschauung (note the root word anschauen, which means ‚Äúto look‚Äù) relies on visual sense and the eye as the organ for human knowledge, whereas intuition does not necessarily involve the eye. Following the English translation Mou translates it into Chinese as zhijue (Áõ¥Ë¶∫) or ‚Äúdirect perception,\\" thereby directly attributing the activity to the intellect. The defining meanings of Kant‚Äôs terms are hence erased and replaced with Mou‚Äôs terms containing implicit interpretations of what Kant originally meant.

Based on the 1981 short story of the same name by William Gibson, the game has the player take the role of the title character. Development for the game was done by American studio Propaganda Code, the gaming division of Propaganda Films. The budget for the game was $3 million. Filming took place at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, California for fifteen days. Johnny Mnemonic received polarizing reviews from video game critics. After its release, Sony Imagesoft was folded into Sony Computer Entertainment of America and Propaganda Code closed down, having only made one game. Gameplay Johnny Mnemonic: The Interactive Action Movie is a point-and-click adventure video game. The game has no user interface displayed, instead changing the aspect ratios on the screen to show when to do any action commands. Plot Development Johnny Mnemonic was developed by Sony Imagesoft. The interactive movie was shot by the production company Propaganda Films, known for filming commercials for AT&T; and Coca-Cola and filmed 1990's Wild at Heart. Along with shooting the footage for the game, they also developed the game under their unit Propaganda Code. The story was based on a 1981 short story by William Gibson, who had coined the term \\"cyberspace\\" and who served as scriptwriter for the film. Around the same time as the video games production, Sony Pictures was making a movie adaption, starring Keanu Reeves. Production costs for filming and tech development reached $3 million. The script was written by Douglas Gayeton and John Platten. The script numbered roughly 145 pages when completed. It took four weeks to write a script, and Gayeton took into account that he knew he'd be unable to ask for more money for reshoots. The original concept for the game was to use the same sets as the movie but were unable to due to multiple issues, including contractional issues and the movie being behind schedule. Filming for the game took place in the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, California. The design for the hotel was done by Jean-Philippe Carp, previously the designer for the French black comedy Delicatessen. Carp used adornments like aquarium table lamps and neon video screens to give the hotel a futuristic look. Filming lasted fifteen days. Seventy camera set-ups were done for each day of shooting. Propaganda Code executive producer Jonathan Wiedeman noted the potential for continuity issues between scenes due to the multiple branches, which was addressed by having actors tone down any extreme emotional reads. The game saw the first use of the interactive movie engine Cineactive, developed by Evolutionary Publishing, which Sony licensed for use in the title. Christopher Gartin was cast in the role of Johnny Mnemonic. His previous work included an appearance on the soap opera Melrose Place. Other cast members included singer and actor Issac Hayes, former Los Angeles Lakers player Kurt Rambis, Doug Llewelyn from The People's Court, and Penthouse model and 1993's Pet of the Year Julie Strain. Josh Mancell was the composer for the game. The soundtrack to the game did not feature any of the music used in the soundtrack for the movie. Columbia Records vice president of soundtracks Maureen Crowe said that they tried to incorporate the music used in the movie, but the game was too far ahead. She also explained the two works were thematically different and the same music might not have worked for both. The band Devo was brought on to do the music instead. Interactive movies such as Johnny Mnemonic were often created out of necessity, due to CD-ROMs being forced to compress long movie sequences into low quality files, which developers would combine with graphics, sound and text in what Techtsy describes as \\"the collage technique\\". Steven Yee, director of marketing for Sony New Technologies commented that the film, the CD-ROM and an Internet game entitled Nethunt (where players answered traversed websites to answer questions) \\"amount to three different views of the Internet and Gibson's short story\\". Release Original story author William Gibson helped promote Johnny Mnemonic. The game was first announced in a pre-launch on March 15, 1995 at the New Media Expo at the Writers Guild booth. It was later shown at the first E3 in May the same year. Sean McGowan, an analyst for research boutique Gerard Klauer Mattison & Co. estimated that the game needed to sell 100,000 copies to break even. William Gibson helped promote the game by making an on-line appearance on CompuServe and ZiffNet on May 18, 1995. The game was shipped on May 26, 1995. Shortly after its release, Douglas Gayeton left Propaganda Films to work on other projects. The developer Propaganada Code also closed, with Johnny Mnemonic as their only game. In July 1995, Sony Imagesoft was folded into Sony Computer Entertainment of America due to Sony Corporation of America restructuring their video games operations to prepare for the release of the PlayStation. The game was planned as a launch title for the PlayStation but was never released. A version for the Sega CD was also announced but was also unreleased. Reception Johnny Mnemonic received polarizing reviews from video game critics. Christopher Allen from Allgame described the game as \\"a painful example of why FMV so often fails to achieve significant interactive gameplay.\\" The Los Angeles Times felt the game found ways to make the generally \\"deadly\\" genre of interactive movies interesting and exciting. The Seattle Times felt it was a \\"breakthrough\\" as the first electronic game to be considered a true interactive movie with Hollywood standards. Andy Grieser from The Chicago Tribune was so engrossed in the \\"addictive\\" title that he began shouting out loud during the fight sequences. Charles Ardai for Computer Gaming World remarked that the game suffered from \\"Dragon's Lair syndrome\\", noting that the player is only given one chance of success or else clicking the mouse too early or too late causes a game over. Hardcore Gamer considered the game to be one of the lowest points for publisher Sony Imagesoft.

Prelude  = Arrival of Commissioners in Saint- Domingue = On 17 September 1792, the commissars L√©ger-F√©licit√© Sonthonax, √âtienne Polverel and Jean-Antoine Ailhaud landed in Cap-fran√ßais with 6,000 men from the French Republican army. Their mission was to pacify Saint- Domingue and enforce the law of April 4, which proclaimed the right to vote for free people, including blacks and mulattoes, and imposed the dissolution the white-only colonial assembly. Sonthonax remained in post at the French Cape while Polverel left for inspection in Port-au-Prince in October. Allhaud went south of the colony but quickly returned to France after becoming ill. = Military operations against the revolt = The 6,000 French soldiers, composed of a half of troops of line and a half of volunteers, were ordered to repress the insurrections of the black slaves revolting in the north-west of the island and commanded by Jean-Fran√ßois Papillon and Georges Biassou. But these troops, unaccustomed to the climate, were rapidly decimated by yellow fever. Two months after their landing, writes General Lacroix, \\"3,000 were harvested\\" of the 6,000 men. All the French republican forces were under the command of General √âtienne Maynaud de Bizefranc de Laveaux, who entered the campaign against the revolted slaves in January 1793. At the battles of Morne Pel√© and Tannerie Laveaux was defeated the revolutionaries and quickly reconquered the northern plains. However, the insurgents had allied with the Spaniards, and Spanish troops were embedded as an auxiliary in their army. In the months following the French begin to lose the ground gained. = Commissioners' positions on slavery = Sonthonax and Polverel were close to Brissot, a notorious abolitionist and a member of the Society of Black Friends. The commissioners themselves were members of the Jacobin Club, which promoted the creation of revolutionary clubs in Saint-Domingue that attracted many poor whites or called \\"petit blancs\\". Conversely, wealthy slave owners or \\"gran blancs\\" were usually royalists and thus hostile to Jacobin activities. Although abolitionists themselves, Sonthonax and Polverel had no authority to abolish slavery, nor did the French government have the intention to do so. Sonthonax did not believe in immediate abolition himself, writing that such action \\"would inevitably lead to the massacre of all whites\\". = Deportation of Governors and dissolution of colonial Assembly = According to the law of August 10, anyone who objected to the commissioners was declared a \\"traitor to the fatherland\\". The commissioners had every power to deport their opponents. Sonthonax arrested Governor Philippe Fran√ßois Rouxel de Blanchelande on September 20, suspected of conspiracy, who was then deported to France where he was guillotined on April 11, 1793. He was replaced by General d'Esparbes, a royalist, who attempted to provoke an insurrection when he learned of the fall of the monarchy on the Insurrection of 10 August 1792. He was then arrested and deported. On October 12, the white-only colonial assembly was dissolved and replaced by a commission composed of whites and free people of color. This measure brings together the free people of color to the commissioners. Sonthonax sought to integrate Mulatto officers in the Cape Regiment, then entirely composed of whites, who were resistant towards integration. During a parade in town, mulattoes and whites of the Cape regiment clashed in a shootout. The authority of the commissioners could be re-established only with the help of General Laveaux. = Rise of dissatisfaction of settlers against commissioners = These measures, favorable to the mulattoes and the free of color, provoked the irritation of the \\"gran blancs\\" who fear the abolition of slavery. Although this message is generally false, the settlers are increasingly hostile to the commissioners. The \\"little whites,\\" republicans, were at first favorable to them, but they are as hostile as the \\"great whites\\" to mulattoes and to men free of colors, whom they hate even more than the first. Also the \\"big whites\\" and the \\"little whites\\", formerly enemies, allied themselves against the commissioners, the mulattoes and the free people of colors. = First revolts = On January 25, 1793, in Port-au-Prince, the colonists, led by Borel, arm their slaves, join forces with the soldiers of the Artois regiment and make themselves masters of the city. The colonists then send a courier to London and declare themselves ready to pass under the suzerainty of the Kingdom of Great Britain in exchange for the conservation of their laws. The troops loyal to the commissioners commanded by generals Lassale and Beauvais then put the siege to Port-au-Prince which is resumed on April 14, 1793. The colonists of J√©r√©mie in the south of the island revolt in their turn, they form a government which takes the name of \\"Federation of Grande Anse\\", arm their slaves and make massacre the free of color, whose heads are brought on spades and exposed at Fort Lapointe. The board of directors forms an army composed of whites commanded by La Chaise and blacks commanded by No√´l Bras. In order to suppress this rebellion, the commissioners also organize an army commanded by the mulatto Andr√© Rigaud. The mulattoes and the free of color also arm their slaves and led by Rigaud, take possession of Jacmel but they fail to take Jeremiah.  The insurrection of whites in Cape  On May 7, 1793, while the commissioners were busy fighting the rebellion in the south, Brigadier General Francois Thomas Galbaud-Dufort, of the Republican army, landed in Cap-French to hold the post of governor. This nomination arouses the hopes of the colonists because Galbaud does not show any favor for mulattoes and free people. The colonists show more and more openly their opposition to the commissioners, and Sonthonax and Polverel must hastily return to Cape Town on June 10. Whites and mulattos are then on the brink of confrontation. The commissioners begin by ousting Galbaud, he is Creole; however, according to the April law, creoles can not perform public functions in the colonies. Galbaud submits and on June 13, he embarks on the Normandy shipwho must leave for France. This departure despairs the settlers, but discontent also wins the sailors and soldiers of the Republican Navy. A dispute had arisen between a naval officer and a mulatto, the sailors complain to the commissioners but they refuse to intervene in the case which causes the anger of the sailors. Their resentment against the commissioners increases all the more because they do not support the prohibition that was made to them to stay on the ground at night. Shortly afterwards a ship entered the harbor carrying 25 to 30 colonists and about 40 soldiers of the Artois regiment taken prisoner during the insurrection of Port-au-Princes and who were to be deported to France \\"to learn how to lose their color prejudice. According to one observer. Exasperated, settlers and sailors sent a delegation to Galbaud on June 19 asking him to take the lead in the insurgency that is preparing against the commissioners and mulattoes. Galbaud accepts and in the night of June 19 to 20, he arrives at Cap-French with the sailors joined by the colonists, soon Galbaud is at the head of 2,000 to 3,500 men. Alerted, the mulatto soldiers take up arms, determined to defend the commissioners. Fierce street battles are taking place, but ill, General Lavaux can not come to ensure the command which is then entrusted by the commissioners to Colonel Mulatto Antoine Chanlatte, assisted by the black officer Jean-Baptiste Belley, known as \\"Mars Belley\\".  Slave offensive  After two days of fighting, the commissioners evacuate Cape Town and retreat to Upper Cape, they establish their headquarters at the Breda plantation. Out of strength, the two commissioners decide to call for help the rebellious slaves against whom they had formerly fought. Sonthonax writes a proclamation against them: The proclamation is entrusted to the Mulatto officer Antoine Chanlatte who, accompanied by two white adventurers, Ginioux and Galineux Degusy, gives it to the rebel slaves who camped on the heights of Morne du Cap. On June 21, 10,000 rebel slaves commanded by Macaya and Pierrot founded on Cap-fran√ßais, where the insurgent whites were completely overwhelmed. They fled and boarded the ships in great confusion in the retirement of the sailors get drunk and plundered several houses and shops they occupied. The fighting on June 21 is the bloodiest, there are 500 corpses, several fall or are thrown into the sea where they are devoured by sharks. The commissioners decide to send Polverel's son to negotiate with the insurgents. But Galbaud refuses any discussion and holds the emissary prisoner, shortly after Galbaud's brother is taken by the men loyal to the commissioners. Sonthonax is ready to accept an exchange of prisoners but Polverel refuses, according to witnesses, tears in his eyes he says: \\"No, my son can not be exchanged for a culprit\\". In the confusion, a group of blacks attempts to burn a prison to deliver many of their prisoners, but the flames are gaining other homes and homes of what was considered the most beautiful cities in the West Indies are destroyed. Pillage of Cap- Fran√ßais The city was subjected to several days of pillage known as the Pillage of Cap-Fran√ßais. The pillage and the great fire has been described in numerous memoirs and diaries and other contemporary works, notably by H. D. de Saint-Maurice, editor of the Moniteur g√©n√©rale de a partie francaise de Saint- Domingue. Several scenes from the pillage became known, such as when the rebels put on the clothes from private homes as well as the costume from the Com√©die du Cap. Marie Vieux Chauvet‚Äôs Theatres: Thought, Form, and Performance of Revolt During the pillage and fire of the city, many civilians lost their lives and were \\"massacred\\", according to eyewittnesses.Jeremy D. Popkin, Facing Racial Revolution: Eyewitness Accounts of the Haitian Insurrection (Chicago, 2007) Most of the white civilian population (as well as some of the rich gens de couleur libres) took refuge on the ships which had crowded in the city harbour avaiting the commissioner's permission to depart, and left the island with them.Jeremy D. Popkin, Facing Racial Revolution: Eyewitness Accounts of the Haitian Insurrection (Chicago, 2007) Numerous of the most famous buildings were lost during the Great Fire of Cap‚ÄëFran√ßais of 1793 on June 21‚Äì26, among them the Com√©die du Cap and the Comunaut√© des Religieuses Filles de Notre Dame du Cap-Francais.  Conclusion  On 24 June, Galbaud and survivors, numbering several thousand, embark on the ships the Aeolus and Jupiter and several frigates in the harbor of Cape Town, from there they win the United States where they find refuge. The Commissioners take possession of the Cape French, but the city nicknamed \\"the Jewel of the West Indies\\" is destroyed five-sixths. Nevertheless, they hope to win the rallying of rebel slaves, but they are quickly disappointed. Some accept but the majority of them have returned to the mountains with their booty. Couriers are sent to Jean-Fran√ßois Papillon and Georges Biassou but they refuse to recognize the Republic, they declare themselves royalists and subject of the King of Spain since the King of France had been executed. Contacted, Toussaint Louverture refused to rally \\"republican traitors\\" and wrote that \\"the blacks wanted to serve under a king and the King of Spain offered him his protection\\".

It was founded in 1739 or 1740 to improve the social standing of the professions and to implement professional standards. It was the first law society to be established in the United Kingdom, though its relationship to the modern-day Law Society of England and Wales is not certain.  Background and founding  The Society of Gentleman Practisers in the Courts of Law and Equity was founded in either 1739 or 1740 by 28 elite London-based attorneys and solicitors. At this time (prior to the Judicature Acts of 1873‚Äì75) an attorney was a lawyer who practised in the common law courts of England and Wales whilst a solicitor practised in the courts of equity/chancery. Up until the 18th century the attorneys had held themselves superior to the solicitors but around the time of the formation of the society the two professions held equal standing. The society seems to have been partly founded in response to the public's distrust of the professions, partly as an attempt to improve the social standing of its members and partly as a reaction to the Attorneys and Solicitors Act of 1728. This act attempted to regulate the solicitors and attorneys (as well as ecclesiastical court proctors) by instituting a compulsory five-year articleship and the society supported this. The two professions represented by the society were inferior to that of the barristers, who practised in the higher courts. Though the barristers had their ancient Inns of Court, they were somewhat late in setting up organisations dedicated to maintaining professional standards ‚Äì only reforming education following the 1854 Royal Commission.  Role  The society was a voluntary association and was the first professional law society in the United Kingdom. It flourished in the century of its founding, and was occasionally consulted by members of parliament when drafting new bills. A branch of the society was established in Bristol, which was then considered England's second city, in 1770. As part of its drive to maintain standards the society attempted to expose \\"unworthy\\" attorneys, though it often lacked the necessary resources to do so. It attempted to standardise the training and qualifications of solicitors and attorneys and to close the social gap between them and the barristers. The society also sought to raise the fee payable to solicitors and attorneys. This had been fixed by custom since the 17th century and its real value had been reduced by inflation.  Law society  The society was informally known as \\"the law society\\", however its relationship to the modern-day Law Society of England and Wales is unclear. A Law Journal article of 1924 and Professor Andrew Boon, writing in 2014, claim that the society developed into the Society of Attorneys, Solicitors, Proctors and others not being Barristers, practising in the Courts of Law and Equity in the United Kingdom, which itself developed into the Law Society of England and Wales. However Philip Ross Courtney Elliott, writing in 1972, claims this is by no means certain.

The program has become the world's most-watched TV show, with one billion viewers in 2018.  Biography  Huang was born in April 1934 in Shenyang, Liaoning, China. In 1949, he enlisted in the People's Liberation Army as a military entertainer. A year later, his unit was dispatched to North Korea to perform for Chinese troops fighting in the Korean War. After his entertainment unit was disbanded, he was discharged from the military and assigned to work for China Central Television. In the early 1980s, Huang proposed the idea of hosting a televised party to celebrate the Chinese New Year, and the first CCTV New Year's Gala aired in 1983. Operating on a very low budget, Huang was given a studio of , which could accommodate only 60 staff members and 200 guests. With no money for recording and editing, the show was improvised and broadcast live, and the studio had four telephones accepting live requests from callers nationwide. The popular singer Li Guyi ended the night with nine performances, and the comedian Jiang Kun, who co- hosted the show, performed three pieces of xiangsheng. Huang and his colleagues at CCTV took considerable political risk broadcasting the live show, as pop singers such as Li Guyi were at the time under attack by hardliners as \\"spiritual pollution\\" and one of her most popular songs, Hometown Love (), was still officially banned. When the song received numerous phone requests, Huang sought permission from Wu Lengxi, the Minister of Radio and Television who was in the audience. Wu gave the go-ahead after much deliberation, and Li Guyi performed the song for the first time on national TV. After the first New Year Gala proved a huge hit with viewers nationwide, Huang was tasked with directing the second edition in 1984. At the time, China and Britain were under intense negotiation over the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the status of Hong Kong. Huang came up with the idea of inviting the amateur Hong Kong singer Cheung Ming-man to perform at his show. It was then unprecedented for a Hong Kong entertainer to perform on Chinese TV and his request met significant resistance. Huang persistently lobbied government officials and eventually gained their approval. Cheung's performance of the patriotic song \\"My Chinese Heart\\" at the 1984 gala made him a household name in China. Huang went on to direct three more editions of the New Year's Gala, in 1985, 1986, and 1990. The annual show has since become a new tradition for Chinese New Year. The program is now the most-watched TV show in the world, with a billion viewers in 2018. Huang died on 8 April 2019 in Beijing, at the age of 85.

It is an open grassy space on the southern shore of Jamboree Lake that is lower than the surrounding elevation in the New Bilibid Prison Reservation. The park is under the joint operation and management of the City Government of Muntinlupa and the Bureau of Corrections. Description View towards the northern boundary of Sunken Garden The Muntinlupa Sunken Garden is in the central area of the Poblacion village at the eastern section of the prison reservation. It is an open grassland delineated by large canopy trees that serves as a buffer between New Bilibid Prison and the communities in east Poblacion. The roughly park borders Jamboree Lake to the north with the main prison facility and maximum security compound located at its southern end. It is bounded by General Paulino Santos Avenue to the south and west, with the main road leading in and out of the prison reservation known as Insular Prison Road running along the park's northern boundary. Within the park's bounds is the Memorial Hill, a historical landmark that stands at the northern side near Jamboree Lake. It contains a Marian grotto with a statue of Our Lady of Lourdes. Also in the vicinity is a Japanese vintage cannon used during World War II as well as a memorial to Major Eriberto Misa, the longest serving director of the New Bilibid Prison. Across the park's central section on Insular Prison Road is the Our Lady of Mercy chapel also known as Ina ng Awa Parish Church that replaced the grotto at Memorial Hill where regular masses were held in the early 1950s. The park also hosts a recreation camp with gazeboes near the lake and extends into the western side of Insular Prison Road north of the chapel as the smaller New Bilibid Prisons Park. A portion of the Sunken Garden was formerly used as a food production area for the prison inmates and employees in the 1940s. In 2007, a portion of the Sunken Garden was declared a mini-forest park through Resolution No. 07-382 signed by Mayor Jaime R. Fresnedi. In 2015, perimeter lights were installed at the park around Jamboree Lake at a cost of . The construction of a pavilion and viewdeck at the lake was announced in 2017 by the local government as part of its economic and infrastructure development spending of for fiscal year 2018. Recreation The Muntinlupa Sunken Garden is a popular recreational area for people living in the locality. In addition to serving as the main venue for events and ceremonies sponsored by the Bureau of Corrections, it hosts a number of outdoor activities for locals and visitors, including fitness classes, fun runs, football and fishing. The MJRF Fishing Competition initiated by Mayor Fresnedi in 2013 is an annual competition that takes place in Jamboree Lake. Students from the nearby Itaas Elementary School also use the open spaces at the Sunken Garden for their yearly \\"Field Day\\" and regular open-air athletics. In 2014, a resolution was approved allocating a portion of the Sunken Garden for the construction of modern football field. Since May 2015, the park also hosts free weekly outdoor cinema screenings by the lake sponsored by the Muntinlupa local government.

The novel, which is considered to be its author's magnum opus, is written in the form of a series of letters from a son to his deceased mother. It won the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1972. Publication Shesh Namaskar, which is subtitled Shricharaneshu Make (To my Mother), was first published in 1971 by Dey's Publishing. Being a confessional narrative, the novel is written in the form of a series of letters from a son to his mother, who has died. Through these letters, the narrator seeks forgiveness from his mother just before his death, telling the story using the second-person narrative technique. The author tries to concentrate on self- analysis and his search for the meaning of life and of death through a confessional self-projection into the narrator's persona. Characters The principle characters of the novel: * The narrator * Pranabnarrator's father, an unsuccessful playwright * Tanunarrator's mother * Sudhirmama (lit. Sudhir Uncle)Tanu's friend * Rajanian almost blind girl Synopsis Because the author does not want to be dependent on an abundance of events, he selects a few events, observes them poignantly and analyses them with meticulous care. As a result, Shesh Namaskar does not have an overt plot or a sustained story- telling style. The novel starts with a letter from a son to his mother, Tanu, followed with another such letter each week. At the end of the novel, the narrator realizes the search for the mother is endless and that perhaps every son searches for his mother and with her, the supreme spirit.

Practice An early disciple of B.K.S. Iyengar, the yoga teacher Judith Lasater, helped to create Restorative Yoga by 2007, based on Iyengar Yoga's asanas and use of props. Restorative Yoga sessions allow the body to slow down and relax in a small number of asanas. Each pose is held for longer than in conventional classes, sometimes for twenty minutes, so a session may consist of only four to six asanas. The long holding of poses is often assisted with props such as folded blankets, to ensure the body is fully supported and so to allow the muscles to relax. Geraldine Beirne, writing in The Guardian, called Restorative Yoga \\"all about healing the mind and body through simple poses often held for as long as 20 minutes, with the help of props such as bolsters, pillows and straps\\". The martial arts coach Eric C. Stevens, stating that he found being still more difficult than a \\"five mile run\\", was surprised to start the Restorative Yoga class with Savasana (corpse pose), and to see so many props in use - blanket, pillow, eye bag, strap, blocks. He found his mind strongly challenged during the class, and he slept very soundly afterwards. He recommended the practice for people who feel close to burnout. Difference from Yin Yoga Restorative Yoga is mainly for practitioners suffering from injuries, stress, or illness, who therefore require a yoga practice that can bring them back to a better quality of life; classes are necessarily small so that each person can receive detailed attention to ensure they are safe and properly supported. Yin Yoga uses props in a similar way, and holds poses for similarly long periods, but is aimed mainly at healthy practitioners, and is taught in larger classes.

Guido Balsamo Stella Ex Libris August Ammann Biography Born in Turin of parents Luigi Balsamo and Celestina Sommariva, Balsamo Stella soon lost his father and acquired the double surname from his mother's second husband, the Venetian Alessandro Stella. In 1896 Balsamo Stella followed his family and moved back to Turin from Venice.Mario Quesada, Museo d'arte italiana di Lima, Venezia, Marsilio, 1994, p. 7, . Nothing is known about his education. In 1901 Balsamo Stella began working in a painter's studio in Ca 'Pesaro but because the local Municipality, contrary to the will of Duchess Felicita Bevilacqua La Masa, demanded the payment of rent, Guido left after less than two and a half years. From 1903 to 1904 he attended some lessons at the Free School of the Nude of the Venetian Academy.R. Bossaglia, Il D√©co italiano: fisionomia dello stile 1925 in Italia, Milano, 1975. Balsamo Stella soon went to Munich, where he had contacts with the Munich Secession, in particular with Dagobert Peche and Felice Rix. From 1909 Balsamo Stella attended the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich where he was taught by Albert Welti, Arnold B√∂cklin's student. He showed some of his works at the Secession exhibitions at the Glasspalast, while also working on the production of ex libris.P. Daverio, P.

Trentin, Guido Balsamo Stella. Opera incisoria e vetraria, catalogo della mostra, Bassano del Grappa, 1987. During the First World War, Balsamo Stella moved to Sweden with his wife Anna Akerdahl, also a painter. He dedicated himself to etching and to the study of glass engraving techniques alongside the glass masters of Orrefors and, on his return to Italy, he became a proponent for the renewal of Murano glass craftsmanship.I. de Guttry, M.P.

Early life  Amalie Henriette Sophie Murtfeldt was born on March 22, 1828, in Bremen. She was the younger of her parents' two surviving children. Her parents, Carl Friedrich Murtfeldt and Friederike B. Schneidel belonged to the diminishing bourgeoisie. Her parents were conscious of living in a state of declining prosperity. They were concerned that because of the family's poverty, neither daughter would receive a dowry. Therefore, Amalie and her sister, Ida, received an ‚Äúexceptionally intensive 'academic' education‚Äù that focused on their talents. Ida Murtfeldt embarked on musical studies, which led to her becoming a piano teacher, while Amalie underwent a 30-month apprenticeship with the Bremen portrait artist Karl Kirchner. The outcome was that both daughters reached adulthood with a sound practical education, a rare privilege among women in the middle part of the 19th Century.  Career  In 1849, Amalie was awarded a three-year acceptance by the senate of Bremen that allowed her to be educated at the private Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf by Karl Ferdinand Sohn. She was the first female artist to receive a bursary from the senate. In 1852, she continued her studies in Berlin, where she started copying masterworks in museums. These initial years were marked by close contact to the Kugler circle, which encompassed the Bremen artist Louise Kugler, poet-novelist Paul Heyse from Munich and the art critic Friedrich Eggers, originally from Rostock. Between the years of 1855 and 1857, she was based in Paris, learning at the prestigious \\"atelier\\" of the \\"history of painting\\" artist Thomas Couture and undertaking intensive studies on some of the works of the Louvre. She returned to Bremen in 1857, and for almost 10 years taught drawing at H√∂heren T√∂chterschule girls' secondary school of Meta Albers. She inspired a generation of schoolgirls, who loyally continued to support her after she opened her first studio and launched herself as a freelance artist in Bremen. From 1868-1869, Amalie traveled to Italy to continue her studies, with a particular focus on Rome. She set up her own studio with the help of supporters from more prosperous Bremen merchant families, notably the Gildemeisters, the Nielsens, and the Trevinarus family. The support given by leading families brought major benefits to her art works. Amalie later found herself required to make compromises within her art. Amalie was dependent on commissions from the Bremen haute-bourgeoisie. A new wave, represented in Bremen by Arthur Fitger, drew inspiration from classical, historical and mythological themes. In contrast, the Hanseatic merchant patriarchs preferred to take their queue from the Dutch Golden Age paintings. Those traditions were consciously aloof from \\"luxurious, purposeless\\" art, and in Bremen found their outlet, above all, in portraiture. Bremen's business elite surrounded themselves with art that they could identify as \\"necessary\\". Amalie exhibited three portraits as early as 1850, at a major art exhibition at the Bremen Art Museum (\\"Kunsthalle Bremen\\"), and her work featured regularly at subsequent exhibitions until 1874. Her artistic legacy is dominated by portraits for leading Bremen families, and she could not avoid the forced adoption of conservatism on the art scene in Bremen. The time and energy that she had to devote to commissioned portraits and teaching work left her creative efforts artist confined to a parallel secondary career. = Middle years = As the years passed, Amalie became aware that her artistic career had fallen short of her hopes. She began to withdraw from the public eye. Her friend and admirer, the well-regarded artist Arthur Fitger wrote, \\"Amalie Murtfeldt became ever more distant from the wider public in her final years, as her sensitive spirit became less keen than hitherto on exposing her art to the judgment of the general public. But for the few people who had the good fortune to be permitted access to her studio, for those chosen ones, who have the joy of owning one of her works and being able to encounter it afresh each day, came the appreciation of how far she had perfected her talents, restlessly striving with the passing years.\\"  Death  On June 28, 1888, aged 60, Amalie, who had been weakening, died. Her grave is located in the Riensberg Cemetery. Fitger delivered a telling appreciation of Amalie's talents in a speech at her funeral. He stressed the harmonious coming together of human and artistic qualities that she was able to bring to her work, thanks to her unusually sensitive personality.  Legacy  In 1889, approximately a year after her death, a commemorative exhibition of her works was presented at the city's Art Museum (\\"Kunsthalle Bremen\\") at Fitger's request. Her abundant portraiture was well represented, along with paintings of bathing nymphs, Maenad, classical tambouristas and gypsy figures. The exhibition provided an excellent display of the phases of her career, launching a revival of interest in her work among Bremen's art lovers. Fitger was both a friend and an artist whose own stylist approach was close to Amalie's own. He was not alone in praising her among arts scholars and commentators of the time. Nevertheless, neither Fitzger nor Amalie transcended their own age, and their artistic vision had fallen out of fashion by the time of Fitger's own death in 1909. The affection she received for her portraiture by members of Bremen's ruling class during the final decades of the nineteenth century means that her work has not entirely disappeared from view. Among 2019 scholars, Dr. L√∂hr of Bremen's Focke Museum (which includes in its collection two of her portraits, from 1860 and 1888), considers her work \\"competently crafted but not outstanding\\" (\\"handwerklich ordentlich, aber nicht √ºberragend\\").

However, she never resided in the castle as she preferred her residence of Saint-Michel. On May 19, 1808, Napoleon I bought the castle from brothers Aaron (1758-1827) and Abraham (1773-1840) Marqfoy. He resided there and the castle became one of his imperial palaces. During his stay in Bayonne, he did not reside at the Ch√¢teau-Vieux, preferring the comfortable Castle of Marracq. In 1808, the abdication of the Bourbons of Spain in favour of Neopleon I was signed in the Castle of Marracq. Then Napoleon installed his brother Joseph Bonaparte on the throne of Spain. Upon the Bourbon Restoration, the castle remained empty. The army settled there in 1823, but the castle was devastated by a fire in 1825.

It is native to shallow water in the tropical western Atlantic Ocean where it creates a home for itself from fragments of the algae on which it feeds. This seaweed contains certain chemicals that are distasteful and protect it from predatory fish. Taxonomy Two new single-species amphithoid genera were described in close succession in the mid-1970s, Pseudamphithoides Ortiz, 1976 and Amphyllodomus Just, 1977. The latter had A. incurvaria as its type, with the specific name referring to the moth genus Incurvaria, whose cocoon is built similarly to A. incurvarias home. Both authors noted that the genera they were describing were unusual and divergent. This was marked enough that when Karaman and Barnard later noted the synonymy of the two genera, they further added: \\"[we] saw specimens of the genus from Puerto Rico in 1975 and had the same difficulty initially placing the genus in a family.\\" Home Pseudamphithoides incurvaria lives concealed in a tube of its own construction. Two oval pieces of seaweed are bent in half longitudinally and stuck together along the long edges with a secreted glue, leaving slits open at each end. The anterior part of the animal projects at one end. The \\"domicile\\" is carried in a vertical position and the amphipod can clamber around among the hydroids and seaweed around it, and can swim while still enclosed in the casing, using strokes made by the plumose antennae. Distribution This amphipod is found in the tropical west central Atlantic Ocean, including the Caribbean Sea. Its depth range is from the shallow subtidal zone down to about . Ecology A herbivore, P. incurvaria feeds exclusively on the flat-bladed brown alga Dictyota bartayresiana. This seaweed contains a diterpene alcohol that is distasteful to fish but not to the amphipod. The amphipod also uses pieces of the alga to build itself a home. Fish have been observed spitting out these casings after they have been ingested, but if the amphipod gets dislodged from the casing in the process, it is readily consumed. Researchers found that the amphipods selected D. bartayresiana to build their domicile even where it was rare, but would not use the seaweed Ulva unless there was no alternative. However, treating Ulva with pachydictyol‚ÄîA, a major secondary metabolite of D. bartayresiana, made it acceptable. The study concluded that the host specificity of the amphipod was primarily driven by the need to avoid predation. Young amphipods develop in a brood pouch and the juveniles remain inside their mother's domicile for a period of time, protected from predators and provided with easy access to their food supply.

He played for Canterbury-Bankstown in the New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) competition. Background Kidd played his junior rugby league for Chester Hill before signing with Canterbury in 1965. Playing career Kidd made his first grade debut against Western Suburbs in 1966. In 1967, Kidd guided Canterbury to their first grand final in 20 years as they reached the final against South Sydney. Since their last grand final appearance in 1947, the club struggled towards the bottom of the table and only reached the finals once culminating in a last placed finish in 1964. Kidd played at halfback in the 1967 NSWRL grand final as Souths took an early lead. Canterbury then regained the lead to be ahead 8-5 until Canterbury hooker Col Brown tried a looping pass which was intended to find fullback Les Johns only for Souths player Bob McCarthy to intercept the ball and race away to score a try. Souths then went on to kick a late goal to win the match 12‚Äì10. Kidd was guilty of giving away the penalty which lead to the goal. After the grand final defeat, Canterbury finished a disappointing 9th in 1968 and 8th in 1969. Kidd featured less for Canterbury in the following seasons due to injury and by 1970 was captaining the third grade side.

The story was published in 1988. The musical, for children but not only children, first appeared in print in 1998, and as an audio play and CD in 1999 when it premiered at the M√ºnchner Planetarium. The musical is often presented on stage, both by professionals and by schools and music academies. It received several awards.  History  , an author of youth literature and a Liedermacher (singer-songwriter), wrote the story \\"Der kleine Tag\\". He had the idea in 1984, and it was published in 1988. Together with Eicke, Rolf Zuckowski and derived a musical and audio play from the story \\"for children but not only for children\\". It was first published in print by Hans Sikorski in 1998. It premiered at the M√ºnchner Planetarium of the Deutsches Museum in Munich in 1999, and appeared on CD in 1999, also by Sikorski. The narrator was Gunter Scho√ü, the title role was played by Lucie Sch√§fer, and the Mysterious Day by Bill Ramsey. The musical has often been produced by project groups from schools and music academies in Germany and abroad.  Plot  The Little Day is one of several characters impersonating calendar days as Lichtwesen (light creatures) living above the Earth. Each day, one of them comes to Earth and experiences things happening that day, including war, peace and inventions. Each day character has only one chance, reports events on return, and gets ranked by the importance of the events, with sitting in the first row (Erste Reihe) in the meetings being the highest rank. The Little Day waits impatiently for its chance on the next 23 April (in the musical, while it is 23 February in the story), and talks to the Mysterious Day (Geheimnisvoller Tag), a character who was ranked high, but is unsure if the day was a good day, because that day lenses were invented, making glasses and other good inventions possible but also the better aiming of weapons (Zielfernrohr). The Mysterious Day explains that ranking is less important than being unique and authentic. On 23 April, the Little Day experiences events including a family moving, with their expectations and difficulties, repair work on a street, and people waiting at a bus station and complaining about the weather, causing the Little Day to ask the sun to shine. Other events include a class at school where a child has a birthday and receives a dog, and all children in the class imagining that animals are sitting in the class as pupils. In another, two people meet after a 50-year absence, a son and his father reconcile, a young couple dance in a park, and a family enjoys a picnic einfach nur so (\\"just like that\\" or \\"for no reason at all\\"). The Little Day returns happily but is not ranked high, because nothing special happened. The Mysterious Day is not able to prevent the Little Day's disappointment. The following year, the Day for 23 April reports that people on Earth celebrated in memory of the day a year earlier, which had been the most peaceful day of all times, without wars, catastrophes or hunger. This report leads to Little Day's promotion to the first row.  Music  The musical is scored for soloists, choir, orchestra and combo. The duration is given as 65 minutes.  Reception and awards  The audio play and musical received the biennial Leopold award of the (Association of German music schools) in 2001, recommending it as \\"Gute Musik f√ºr Kinder\\" (\\"Good music for children\\"), suitable for children from age 8. It also received the special prize of a jury of children, the Poldi, from the WDR. On the 10th anniversary of the premiere on 3 October 2009, the publisher issued a special edition of its newsletter, with interviews of authors and performers. It reported 2,650 performances on more than 300 stages. In 2012, Eicke received a golden award when 150,000 CDs were sold.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. History Pennuiman Castle, John H. Penniman was 11 years old in 1857 when he moved with his family from Syracuse, New York to Battle Creek. He studied to become a dentist, and in 1874 married Annie Havens in Battle Creek. The couple had two sons, Allen H. Penniman, born in 1877, and John B. Penniman, born in 1883. John Penniman died in 1886, but left his widow and children a substantial estate. Annie Penniman died in 1899. Allen H. Penniman went on to become a local businessman, and in 1904 married Fayette Marcellus. The couple first lived in the house built by Allen Penniman's father, but in 1905, Allen purchased five lots at the corner of Main Street and Kingman Avenue in a newly platted subdivision being developed by C. W. Post. He hired local builder Ruel Seeley and began construction on a new house, modeled after a design called \\"Hudson River Residence,\\" published by mail-order plan architect Herbert C. Chivers. Penniman modified the design from the original shingle style to a fieldstone exterior to mimic the look of a Rhineland castle. The house was completed in 1906. The Pennimans lived in the house until late 1909 or early 1910, when they moved to Los Angeles. The couple had three children, and Fayette died in 1935 and Allen in 1942. The Penniman Castle in Battle Creek was often vacant until 1922, when Glenn M. Hayes, an employee of the Kellogg Company, purchased it. Hayes lived there until about 1930, and the house was again often vacant until 1940, when it was purchased by Floyd K. Settle. A fire in 1941 destroyed the third floor and the roof; the Settles constructed a new roof on top of the second story. They lived in the house until 1954, after which the house had a series of owners. Description The Penniman Castle is a two-story, flat-roofed, castle style house with a balloon frame and cobblestone exterior. The house has distinctive octagonal towers at each front corner, a wrap-around porch extending around three sides of the house, a cobblestone porte-coch√®re, and two second-floor balconies. The windows are one-over-one units with stone lintels and arched stone hoods, many with leaded glass in the upper portion. A single-story garage is attached to the rear of the house. The house is essentially square in shape, with the interior designed around a central octagonal hall, with four octagonal rooms spaced around the outside.

He has been described as a pioneer in the relational approaches to psychoanalysis and psychotherapy by Andrew Samuels, Professor of Analytical Psychology. His book 'Learning from Our Mistakes' received a Gradiva award for its contribution to psychoanalysis, and his book 'Learning Along the Way: Further Reflections on Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy' was listed in the top 100 psychotherapy books of all time by Bookauthority. Casement is best known for his Learning from... series. His works have been translated into 21 languages and utilised by psychoanalysts and professionals from other related disciplines. Burton highlights how Casement identified learning from his patients in the analytic encounter as being of central value in his work as it allows for continuous discovery and understanding.  Early Life and training  Casement was born in Woldingham in 1935. He is the second of four children, his father's side being from a Naval background. He was at Cambridge, Trinity College from 1956 to 1959 where he read for a Degree in Anthropology and Theology. After qualifying with a Diploma in Public and Social Administration from Barnett House, Oxford University, Casement went on to work as a social worker and probation officer. During his time working as a family caseworker and then principal for the London Family Welfare Association, Casement trained and qualified as a psychotherapist with the British Association of Psychotherapists, and in 1977 qualified further as a psychoanalyst with the British Institute of Psychoanalysts. He went on to become a training and supervising analyst for the British Psychoanalytical Society. His supervisors and membership consultants included John Klauber, Adam Limentani, Hanna Segal and Paula Heimann. Casement aligned with what was the Independent Group in the British Psychoanalytical Society, and has been particularly influenced by the work of Donald Winnicott, Wilfred Bion, and Michael Balint.  Clinical contributions to psychoanalysis  Casement's contributions to psychoanalytic technique include his observations about internal supervision, trial identification, and monitoring how the analytic space is either preserved or spoiled by the analyst's contributions. Casement was deeply influenced by Winnicott's ideas including 'The Use of an Object'. Burton has noted how Winnicott‚Äôs emphasis on the dynamic of the patient-analyst exchange became a central focus of Casement‚Äôs work. In developing his ideas and guiding his clinical work, Casement has noted a potential for patients to be steered by unconscious hope, searching for what may have previously remained unmet through and in the analytic process. Casement places an emphasis on the analyst's affective openness, and within this a willingness and capacity to consider and explore his/her own contributions to, and impact on, the analytic process. In his book ‚ÄòOn Learning from the Patient‚Äô, Casement references Winnicott‚Äôs metaphor of the spatula as a guiding influence on this aspect of his clinical approach, in which a protective space is cultivated for the patient to ‚Äòplay‚Äô, within which, the patient‚Äôs process can unfold with minimal impingement from the analyst. Casement has written about a risk of applying psychoanalytic theory too confidently or of analytic sureness/certainty. Casement has also cautioned against preconceptions that steer the analytic process, and has advocated a need for analysts to be led by the process emerging between analyst and patient in the consulting room. In this respect, Casement states that there is a need for the analyst to regularly monitor the analytic space for possible impingements that the analyst may bring to, or impose on, the therapeutic relationship. It is within this regard, that Casement has outlined the therapeutic utility of his concepts of internal supervision and trial identification. In 2019, Casement published ‚ÄòLearning Along the Way', which is a collection of his previously published papers and other writings from the past fifty years. He also has a mini book in process with Aeon Books Ltd, Credo? Religion and Psychoanalysis.  Personal life  Casement is married since 1966 and has two daughters. He retired from private practice in 2005, but still works as a supervisor to a number of analysts, psychologists and therapists.  Bibliography  * Casement, P. (1990).

History The hospital, which was designed by Robert Clarke using a Corridor Plan layout, opened as the Oxford County Pauper Lunatic Asylum in August 1846. The ward spurs were extended to a design by Henry Jones Underwood in 1847. Littlemore railway station was opened, giving improved access to the hospital, in 1864, and two additional pavilion blocks connected by a recreation hall were completed to a design by Edwin Dolby and Henry Tollit in 1902. During the last few months of the First World War the hospital served as the Ashurst Military hospital and it was then renamed Littlemore Hospital in 1922. After some of the pavilions saw service with the Emergency Hospital Service during the Second World War, the whole facility joined the National Health Service in 1948. Dr Bertram Mandelbrote, who carried out pioneering work on creating therapeutic communities, became superintendent at the hospital in 1959. After the introduction of Care in the Community in the early 1980s, the hospital went into a period of decline and closed in 1998. The main hospital building was converted into apartments as St. George's Park. Some of the rear blocks were acquired by Yamanouchi (now Astellas Pharma) for use as a research facility but then sold on, in 2008, to the SAE Institute for use as a training establishment. Meanwhile, a modern mental health facility known as the Littlemore Mental Health Centre, which includes the Ashurst Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) and Phoenix Ward (Adult Male in-patient), have been established on the opposite side of Sandford Road.

He worked at the insect identification division of the US Department of Agriculture and was also a research associate at the Smithsonian Institution. Carl was born in Medina, New York where his parents William and Marie Koch had moved to in the 1880s. His father who worked as a tailor came from Stettin, Pomerania (the family name has variants that include Meusebach) and his mother was from Angermunde, east of Berlin. They had married in the United States. Carl went to school in Medina and at Brockport High School, while also helping his father at his tailoring business. He joined Cornell University in 1912 and took an interest in mathematics and English. His interest in insects was sparked by studies under John Henry Comstock and Anna Botsford Comstock. Graduating with an interest in biology and entomology he joined the US department of agriculture in 1916 studying gypsy and brown-tail moths in his early years. He resigned work in 1918 to join Cornell for doctoral studies. His thesis was on the North American Apanteles and after receiving his doctorate, he rejoined the USDA in 1919. He worked briefly in Hungary in 1926-1928 during which time he travelled around Europe. Carl wrote numerous taxonomic revisions on hymenoptera. Another influential work was his catalogue of Common names of insects approved by the American association of economic entomologists (1946). For his 75th birthday the flea specialist Robert Traub named a genus Muesebeckella after him while Harry Hoogstraal described a tick Ornithodoros (Alectorobius) muesebecki from an masked booby to which he gave the common name \\"Musebeck's Arabian Booby Argasid.\\" Karl Krombein dedicated a genus of cuckoo wasp Muesebeckidium. Carl retired in 1954. He took part in baseball and bowling, and was a long distance runner. He married Ida C. Praedel in 1917. They had a son who died at the age of 16 from a brain tumour in 1935. Ida died in 1975. He married Luella M. Walkley, a hymenopterist colleague, in 1980 but she died in 1981. He then lived with his cousin Elfrieda Geissler.

History The Church of Our Savior, MCC, began in 1990 as a satellite extension of the Church of the Holy Spirit, now the Sunshine Cathedral, in Fort Lauderdale, to accommodate worshippers from northern Broward and southern Palm Beach counties. The first service was held in a rented space in Boca Raton (4770 NW 2nd Avenue) in the fall of 1990, and the church was chartered by MCC in 1992. Finding a permanent home was the primary task of the church in its first years. At one point building a church with a separate \\"activity building\\" or \\"church hall\\" was considered, but instead the church in 1997 acquired a former Pizza Hut building to use as its sanctuary. Most of the renovation work was done by congregation members. Stained-glass windows A unique set of stained-glass windows fill the former restaurant windows. 12 of the 14 were created by McMow Art Glass in Lake Worth, Florida, the other two by a member of the congregation for whom stained glass was a hobby. In five of them a rainbow appears; in the LBTGQ community the colors of the rainbow represent inclusiveness of the wide variety of human beings. File:In the Beginning.

It is situated immediately to the north of Lisbon. The fort‚Äôs construction began in 1875 and was completed in 1892. Since 2015 it has served as the National Archive for Portugal‚Äôs Directorate General of Cultural Heritage (DGPC). History The fort is situated on the right bank of the River Tranc√£o, close to its confluence with the River Tagus. Its construction dates back to the construction of the ‚ÄúEntrenched Field of Lisbon‚Äù (Campo Entrincheirado de Lisboa), which was a set of fortifications planned after the Portuguese Civil War (1828-34) to guard against both land- based and maritime attacks. The Fort of Sacav√©m was built into a small hill about 35 meters high, which gave it a strategic position over the surrounding area. It was designed as a bastion fort in the Vaudon style, with an irregular pentagonal shape. The main entrance is preceded by a concrete bridge (formerly a wooden drawbridge), which leads to a tunnel giving access to the interior. The ground floor of the central building was a trapezoid and was partially buried. Barracks and stores were covered by steel beams joined by filler composed of small rock, sand and lime, and covered by thick masses of earth to absorb the impact of artillery projectiles. The fort was surrounded with a moat, partially buried in the ground, creating the illusion of a grass knoll, which both made the fort barely perceptible when seen from a lower altitude and allowed the absorption of projectiles. An 1852 army memorandum identified the poor condition of the country‚Äôs defences and particularly referred to the need to fortify the cities. In 1857 the Minister of War appointed an initial commission to study the defences of Lisbon and Porto and then appointed a second commission in 1859 presided over by the Duke of Saldanha, which found that the country‚Äôs defences were worse off than in 1807. This commission appointed engineering officers to carry out detailed studies of Lisbon‚Äôs defensive requirements. Following their recommendations the Government authorised the fortification of Lisbon in 1861 and activities began in 1863, initially in the Monsanto hills to the west of Lisbon, although this work suffered from a lack of funds. Entrance to the fort In 1872 studies began for the construction of the redoubt at Sacav√©m and in 1875 part of the property of the Viscount of Ouguela was purchased as the site for the fort. Building work began in the same year. The purposes of the fort were given as being to prevent the enemy from establishing a base on the other side of the Tranc√£o and to prevent it being crossed, as well as to protect the road and railway line that passed between the fort and the Tagus. In 1899 a decree was issued to officially create the Entrenched Field of Lisbon. The ultimate plan was for nine permanent forts to be linked together between Sacav√©m and Caxias on the Tagus estuary and in 1902 a road was completed connecting the nine sites. The Fort of Sacav√©m never saw battle. In 1912, a time of considerable employee unrest in Portugal, it and three other forts were used to detain 534 strikers. From the 1930s it was used to house an infantry detachment and as a store for munitions, the latter requiring some adaptation to the buildings so that the munitions could be transported in and out. In 1998 the fort still had a small military force but in that year transfer to the Architectural Heritage Inventory Services (SIPA) was authorised. Present day Adaptation to its new function lasted until 2007. Following the system used by Library and Archives Canada, the fort now holds two of the country's largest archives of cultural heritage and architecture: the Information System for Architectural Heritage, with a documentary collection composed of more than 7 kilometres of shelves, 500,000 documents and 300,000 photographs of national buildings and monuments; and the Photographic Documentation Archive (ADF), which includes a total of one million images of various items held in national museums and palaces. The library is unique in the country, and is devoted to the dissemination of information on built heritage, especially in the areas of conservation, restoration and urban rehabilitation. Moat of the Fort of Sacavem Documents are first held for 21 days in a closed chamber to ensure they are free of any type of infestation and then transferred to another chamber where they are further quarantined for 40 days. Each document is then subjected to a process of hygiene where conservationists clean them. Once certified free of disease they are ready to be archived and inventoried and then stored in one of five different environments with different levels of humidity, air temperature and oxygen, according to the requirements of the individual documents. The Sacav√©m fort has attracted a wide variety of birds, some of which nest there. Visits to the fort are not permitted unless for purposes of using the archives.

He led a conservative school of Gujarati writers who advocated avoiding the use of foreign words in writing and speaking, and promoted the use of Sanskrit or Sanskritised words. He was a cousin of the Gujarati writer Govardhanram Tripathi. Biography Tripathi was born into a Vadnagara Nagar Brahmin family on 23 May 1840 in Nadiad in the British Indian state of Gujarat to his father, Suryaram, and mother, Umedkunwar. His father died when he was eight. He received his secondary and college education in Kheda and Ahmedabad. In 1861, he joined Elphinstone College, but left due to an eye-problem. Later he made a career as a stock trader. He died on 30 May 1907 in Nadiad. Gujarati writer Govardhanram Tripathi was his younger cousin. left Tripathi was associated with several literary associations in Gujarat. He was one of the founder members of Farbus Gujarati Sabha and was a member of Buddhi Vardhak Sabha. In 1870, he founded Dharma Sabha in Ahmedabad and became editor of its organ Dharmaprakash. He founded the Dahilakshmi Library in Nadiad in memory of his wife Dahilakshmi. He was appointed as a fellow of Mumbai University, and was appointed a justice of the peace. In 1866‚Äì67 (Vikram Samvat 1923), Gokulji Zala, a dewan (a senior government official) of Junagadh state, heard a lecture by Tripathi at Bombay, and was impressed. Later Zala appointed Tripathi as one of agents of Junagadh state at Bombay. Works A collection of his essays was published as Astodaya (Rise and Fall). They are descriptive, narrative and reflective in nature. Since he wanted to use only words of Sanskrit origin, the language of his essays is highly loaded. Tripathi wrote two biographies: Forbes Jivan Charitra (1869), which presents the career and achievements of Alexander Kinloch Forbes, a colonial administrator in British India. The second biography, Sujna Gokulji Jhala Jivancharitra (1900), tells the life story of Gokulji Jhala, the dewan of Junagadh state, and presents an account of Kathiawadi politics and society between 1860 and 1880. Since Gokulji was a Vedantist, the book also contains a detailed chapter on Shankaracharya, one of the founders of the Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy. In collaboration with Ranchhodbhai Udayram Dave, he wrote Shakespeare Katha Samaj, which presents abridged versions of Shakespeare's plays. Conservatism Plaque at Tripathi's birthplace Tripathi led a conservative school of Gujarati writers. He was one of the earliest and strongest proponents of a highly Sanskritized Gujarati language. He insisted on removing all words of Persian, Arabic or English origin from Gujarati and replacing them with Sanskrit words. As a result of this Ramanbhai Neelkanth, a liberal intellectual and a proponent of Western culture, targeted him in his novel Bhadrambhadra in which the protagonist insists on using highly Sanskritized language. Tripathi also tried to popularize the Devanagari script by writing several works in it, but he was unsuccessful. His style of Sanskritised Gujarati was followed by his younger cousin Govardhanram Tripathi in his epic novel Sarswatichandra. Manilal Dwivedi (fl. 1882‚Äì1898), a Gujarati writer, was also a follower of Tripathi.

She was recognized for her role in investigating and documenting human rights violations, including widespread sexual violence and other atrocities committed during the Yugoslav Wars, the Sri Lanka Civil War, and the Nepal Civil War.  Early life and education  Thapa was born in 1966 in Kathmandu, Nepal. Her father, Bhekh Bahadur Thapa, held several government positions (including Nepal's foreign minister); her mother, Dr. Rita (Basnet) Thapa, worked as a public health specialist, focusing on maternal health and family planning. Thapa's family emigrated to Canada when she was a young child, for a brief spell of three years. They subsequently moved back to Nepal, where her father held several government offices including minister of finance. Her mother meanwhile worked for the WHO in the field of public health, with a focus on maternal and child mortality. In 1979, her family moved to Washington, DC., when her father was named Nepal's ambassador to the United States. She attended National Cathedral School. She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy from Wellesley College, before earning a law degree from Cornell Law School in 1993.  Career  After law school, Thapa worked for Radhika Coomaraswamy, the first United Nations special rapporteur on violence against women. In this role, Thapa interviewed survivors and perpetrators of gender-based violence, contributing to a report for the UN Commission on Human Rights. Thapa then worked for the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, based in The Hague, leading a unit that investigated and documented abuses that occurred in the Yugoslav wars. She was credited with helping to win the Foca cases, which involved sexual crimes committed against Muslim women in the town of Foca, Bosnia, in 1992 and 1993. Her work led to the convictions of eight Serb paramilitary leaders and their supporters, the first prosecution and conviction exclusively for sexual violence crimes under international criminal law. Thapa was also recognized for her role in building a case against Slobdan Milosevic, the former president of Yugoslavia and Serbia, who was tried on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity. In 2004, Thapa joined Human Rights Watch, working as a researcher (later Senior Researcher) on South Asia. She documented sexual violence and other human rights violations that occurred during the civil wars in Sri Lanka and Nepal, as well as in Bangladesh. Her work there helped force the United Nations to acknowledge its failure in protecting civilians during the Sri Lankan Civil War, and prompted the UN to establish Human Rights Up Front, an initiative to promote the importance of early response to human rights violations. Her team comprehensively documented the recruitment of child soldiers by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. In 2017, Thapa documented the Myanmar military‚Äôs ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslims along the Bangladesh-Myanmar border, one of the first human rights workers to do so.  Personal life and death  Thapa was married twice and has a daughter, born in 2000, from the second marriage. In March 2019, Thapa died in New York City from multiple organ failure, following a sudden illness.

She is the manager of the non-profit organization Myanmar Deitta, a gallery that promotes local artistic and documentary photographers, filmmakers and multimedia producers. Over the course of her career she has won scholarships and awards from Bali, South Korea, Malaysia, Yangon, Bangkok, New York and Cambodia. In 2018 Yu Yu co-founded the Thuma Collective, an organization that seeks to expand the ability of female visual artists from Myanmar to express themselves and develop professionally. Much of her work explores religious and women's issues. Early life Yu Yu Myint Than became interested in photography in 2009 while studying for an education degree in Hong Kong. After returning to Myanmar she began to attend photography workshops and eventually looked for work as a professional photographer.  Career  In 2014 Yu Yu won a place in a three-month photography workshop on Meiktila. While there, anti-Muslim riots led to the deaths of over 40 people and the displacement of over 9,000 people in 2013. The work she produced during the workshop focused on positive connections between Buddhist and Muslim residents. Later in 2014 Yu Yu quit her job as a teacher trainer and began working as a photojournalist for the Yangon-based newspaper Myanmar Times. She began taking commissioned and personal photography projects and managed \\"Myanmar's most active photography gallery\\", Myanmar Deitta. Deitta is a Pali word meaning \\"in front of one's eyes\\". It is a non-profit organization whose goal is to promote local documentary photographers, filmmakers and multimedia artists. Much of her subsequent work highlighted women and religion. In December 2018 Yu Yu headed Myanmar Deitta's education department, with responsibility for workshops and seminars. She has been featured in numerous articles about her work. In 2015, Yu Yu won the Golden Scarf Award, an annual award given to the photographer \\"whose work, attitude, and diligence most exemplifies the Foundry spirit.\\" At the time she was believed to be the only native female professional photographer working in Myanmar. On October 15, 2017 Yu Yu co-founded the Thuma Collective at Myanmar Deitta, a photography collective composed of five Myanmar female photographers. The name of the collective was chosen because thuma is Burmese for \\"she\\". The collective's mission statement is ‚Äúto promote the practice of visual storytelling, to amplify voices through the eyes of women and to inspire and encourage women who are interested in photography to use it as a language to tell stories and engage with their world.‚Äù The photography industry in Myanmar is overwhelmingly populated by men. From October 19 ‚Äì November 4, 2017 Yu Yu held an exhibition at Myanmar Deitta focusing on the experiences of San Kay Khine, a girl from State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi's constituency of Kawmhu. San Kay Khine had been held against her will in a well-known tailor's shop in Yangon, forced to work without pay, and tortured. She was rescued in 2016. Rather than focusing on the girl's physical scars, like most media photographers, Yu Yu traveled to Khine's hometown to take a series of pictures depicting her \\"memories, traumas, longings, and dreams\\". Yu Yu has claimed that the greatest challenges to her work were the lack of investment in artistic photography prior to the Saffron Revolution in 2007 and the discrimination against women in Myanmar. She is involved in a long-term personal project investigating human trafficking that occurs between Myanmar and China. Yu Yu has won scholarships and awards from Bali, South Korea, Malaysia, Yangon, Bangkok, New York, and Cambodia. In 2017 she became a fellow of the Magnum Foundation's Photography and Social Justice Program. In 2018 she was the first person to receive the Angus McDonald Photography Scholarship, a collaboration between Myanmar Deitta and the International Photography Division of the Pathshala South Asian Media Institute. The scholarship funded her studies for six months in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Following her return to Yangon she led workshops on documentary photography.

It had a downtown main store on Sixth Street and opened two suburban branches before being sold to The Broadway in 1961. Accolades The San Diego Downtown News characterized the store as San Diego's \\"finest\\" department store and as \\"elegant\\". The Golden Era magazine carried an ad that proclaimed Marston's as the \\"leading dry goods house of San Diego.\\" History Marston started his merchandising career in 1870 at age 20 as an assistant bookkeeper in Aaron Pauly's store and wharf office. He worked there for two years. He then clerked for one year for Mr. Joseph Nash, who advertised his grocery, dry goods and clothing storestore as \\"the cheapest... in the city\\". In 1873, Marston and his best friend and fellow clerk at Pauly's, Charles Hamilton, bought Nash's business and operated it together. In 1878, Marston went at it alone and opened his own clothing and dry goods store along Fifth Avenue between G and H (now Market) streets. In 1881, the store expanded to 509 Fifth Avenue in a new two-story building. In 1896, Marston's moved to 427 C Street (southwest corner of Fifth and C), with the construction of a large neo-Renaissance building costing $60,000, built for him by his uncle, Stephen W. Marston. This four-story building featured wide aisles, an open court from the ground floor to the roof, and a novelty‚Äìan elevator. The property is now an office building still known as the Marston Building. In 1907, Marston's made $15,000 in improvements to its store, turning the third floor stockroom into of additional selling space, which was used for ladies' underwear and hosiery, and for dressing rooms. Money was also spent on new fixtures and interior decoration. In 1912, Marston's moved to its final location across Fifth Avenue. In 1954, Marston's expanded into a new, six- story addition on Fifth Avenue, thus occupying the entire block on the north side of C Street between Fifth and Sixth avenues (demolished in the 1960s). In 1960, Marston's added a home furnishings annex in the former Parmelee-Dohrmann building (Seventh and C). =Tearoom= The 190-seat tearoom, the first sit- down serviced food offering at Marston's, opened April 27, 1955. It was designed by San Diego architect Sam Hamill. It had several 200- to 400-year- old Japanese screens. Pigskin covered the columns, and there was gray-green wall-to-wall carpet on the dining room floor and in the foyer. The menu included coconut cream pie, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches cut in wedges sans crust, a Pacific Paragon salad sandwich, tomatoes stuffed with cottage cheese, and a frozen fruit salad with whipped cream dressing served with minced turkey finger sandwiches. Sandwiches cost from 0.95 to 1.50 dollars, included open-faced Swiss cheese and turkey with thousand island dressing, corned beef on pumpernickel, and a club sandwich served with fruit aspic. At daily fashion shows, models walked among the tables presenting the latest fashion. =Legacy= Marston's sold its stores to The Broadway in 1961. In 1962, the Chula Vista Center branch was opened, still under the Marston's name. This branch was particularly noted for its murals, in the Orange Tree Restaurant murals depicting missions, orange groves, and mountains; in the women's \\"Fashion Circle\\" area, buildings in the South Bay and Coronado areas, including the Hotel del Coronado; in the men's area the Spanish heritage of the area and early 19th century shipping activity, and rancheros on the way to a fiesta, and the old harbor; in the boy's area the Montgomery glider flight of 1833 and the Spirit of St. Louis.\\"Latest Fashions Shown Amidst Old Spanish Decor; Area's History Shown In Marston's Murals\\", Chula Vista Star-News, November 11, 1962, page 6-X. The downtown flagship store was demolished in 1969 when Broadway opened a large new store at the new Fashion Valley Mall; and a Ross Dress for Less occupies the location. The Grossmont Center and Chula Vista Center branches became Broadway stores, and are now Macy's stores.

In the grand final challenge, Murphy played on the wing as Balmain once again defeated Canterbury 13‚Äì9 with all of Balmain's points coming from Joe Jorgenson. Morrie scored a record 14 tries for the season which was not equalled until 1953 by Barry Stenhouse and then beaten by Chris Anderson in 1974. Murphy departed the club following the grand final loss.

Early life Gqabi was born in 1929 in Aliwal North in what is now known as Joe Gqabi District Municipality. His first language was Xhosa. Political activity In the 1950s Gqabi was a journalist for New Age, during which time he was in frequent contact with Walter Sisulu. As a member of the South African Communist Party and Umkhonto we Sizwe he was sent for guerilla training in China in the early 1960s. He was captured with 28 fellow members who were undergoing military training in Rhodesia and deported back to South Africa, where he was sentenced to two years jail for leaving the country illegally and then ten years for crimes under the Sabotage Act, after which he was jailed at Robben Island. He rejoined the ANC after being released from jail in 1975. In 1976 he became co-chairman, with Martin Ramokgadi, of the clandestine ANC organisation in Johannesburg, known as the Main Machinery. During this time, the South African security services attempted to assassinate him by placing a bomb in his car, but it was discovered before it could detonate. He was arrested again after the Soweto uprising but the police, with little evidence, were unable to make a case against him. He was released in 1977, left for Botswana and then went to Zimbabwe after its independence. Death He was assassinated by South African Defence Force on 31 July 1981 in Zimbabwe, Harare, in Ashdown Park. His body was repatriated to South Africa in 2004 and he was reburied in Aliwal North on 16 December 2004. Honours He was posthumously awarded the Order of Luthuli in silver by the South African government. The Joe Gqabi District Municipality was named in his honour.

Trump was not personally under investigation until May 2017, when his firing of FBI director James Comey raised suspicions of obstruction of justice. The investigation was officially opened on July 31, 2016, initially due to information on Trump campaign member George Papadopoulos's early assertions of Russians having damaging material on Donald Trump's rival candidate Hillary Clinton. From late July to November 2016, the joint effort between the FBI, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the National Security Agency (NSA) examined evidence of Russian meddling in the 2016 United States presidential election. The FBI's team enjoyed a large degree of autonomy within the broader interagency probe. The FBI's work was taken over on May 17, 2017, by the Special Counsel investigation of 2017‚Äì2019, which eventually resulted in the Mueller Report. Mueller concluded that Russian interference occurred in a \\"sweeping and systematic fashion\\" and that there were substantial links with the Trump campaign, but the evidence available to investigators did not establish that the Trump campaign had \\"conspired or coordinated\\" with the Russian government. Trump and his allies repeatedly promoted conspiracy theories asserting that the Crossfire Hurricane investigation was opened on false pretenses for political purposes.Caitlin Oprysko, Here are the Russia probe conspiracy theories debunked by the DOJ inspector general report, Politico (December 9, 2019). A subsequent review done by Justice Department Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz, released in redacted form in December 2019, did not find political bias in the initiation of the FBI investigation. The Inspector General also determined that the FBI made 17 errors or omissions in its FISA warrant applications to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA Court) for surveillance of Trump aide Carter Page. Inspector General Horowitz found no testimonial or documentary evidence that political bias against Trump tainted the initiation of the investigation. On January 23, 2020, two of the four FISA warrants were declared invalid by the Department of Justice. In addition, James E. Boasberg, a Washington D.C. federal judge, also said surveillance collected against Page lacked a legal basis.  Origins  After working on the Ben Carson campaign as a foreign policy adviser, in early February 2016 George Papadopoulos, codenamed \\"Crossfire Typhoon\\" by the FBI, left the Carson campaign. Also in early February, he reached out to the London Centre of International Law Practice (LCILP) asking if it was hiring, agreed to join, and arrived in London to begin work. On March 6, Papadopoulos accepted an offer to work with the Trump campaign. As part of his duties with the LCILP, on March 12 he traveled to the Link Campus University in Rome to meet officials with the University. While on this trip, on March 14 he met Maltese professor Joseph Mifsud and informed the professor about his joining the Trump campaign. On March 21, the Trump campaign told the Washington Post that Papadopoulos was one of five foreign policy advisers for the Trump campaign. Mifsud took more interest in Papadopoulos, and met him in London on March 24 with a Russian woman posing as \\"Putin's niece\\". Mifsud traveled to Moscow in April 2016, and upon his return he told Papadopoulos that Russian government officials were in possession of \\"thousands of emails\\" that could be politically damaging to Hillary Clinton. On May 6, Papadopoulos met Alexander Downer, the Australian High Commissioner to Britain in a London bar, and told him about the Clinton emails over drinks. After WikiLeaks released hacked Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails on July 22, the Australian government on July 26 advised American authorities of the encounter between Downer and Papadopoulos, which spurred the FBI into launching the Crossfire Hurricane investigation on July 31.Multiple sources: # # # # # # # In March 2017, FBI Director James Comey confirmed in a congressional hearing that the FBI had been investigating Russian interference as part of its counterintelligence mission. He further confirmed that the probe included links between Trump campaign members and the Russian government, and \\"whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia's efforts\\". Comey added in a June Senate hearing that President Trump had not been personally under investigation until Comey's departure from the FBI. In his May 2017 testimony to the House Intelligence Committee, CIA director John Brennan stated that he had convened in late July 2016 a group of officials from the CIA, NSA and FBI to investigate Russian interference. In a July 2017 interview, Brennan described this group effort as a \\"fusion cell\\". Brennan also testified that he gave the FBI leads involving \\"contacts and interactions between Russian officials and U.S. persons involved in the Trump campaign\\" that were beyond the CIA's mandate to pursue. He said this information \\"served as the basis for the FBI investigation to determine whether such collusion [or] cooperation occurred\\". In February 2018, the Nunes memo, written by staff for U.S. Representative Devin Nunes, stated: \\"The Papadopoulos information triggered the opening of an FBI counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016 by FBI agent Pete Strzok\\",Multiple sources: # # # # # # # rather than the Steele dossier as asserted by, among others, President Donald Trump, Nunes, and several Fox News hosts such as Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity. A rebuttal memo by Democrats in the House Intelligence Committee confirmed that the investigation was opened on July 31, 2016, and stated that Christopher Steele's memos \\"played no role in launching the counterintelligence investigation into Russian interference and links to the Trump campaign\\". The counter-memo added that the FBI investigative team only received the Steele dossier in mid-September, \\"because the probe's existence was so closely held within the FBI\\". The New York Times reported in April 2019 that investigators received the dossier on September 19, 2016. In April 2018, the House Intelligence Committee, then in Republican control, released a report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, as well as the American response to it. The report stated that the FBI opened its counterintelligence probe in late July 2016 \\"following the receipt of derogatory information about foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos\\". In June 2018, the Office of the Inspector General released a report on its counter-investigation into the FBI's investigation of the Hillary Clinton email controversy. This report stated: \\"On July 31, 2016, just weeks after the conclusion of the Midyear investigation [into Clinton], the FBI opened its investigation of Russian interference in the ongoing presidential election [...] the Russia investigation, which touched upon the campaign of then candidate Trump.\\" The Mueller Report of the Special Counsel investigation, completed in March 2019, states that the Papadopoulos information about Russia having acquired damaging material on Clinton \\"prompted the FBI on July 31, 2016, to open an investigation into whether individuals associated with the Trump Campaign were coordinating with the Russian government in its interference activities\\". A review of Crossfire Hurricane done by Justice Department Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz resulted in a report released in December 2019. The report stated that the following information from a Friendly Foreign Government triggered the investigation: George Papadopoulos \\"suggested the Trump team had received some kind of suggestion from Russia that it could assist this process with the anonymous release of information during the campaign that would be damaging to Mrs. Clinton (and President Obama).\\" Horowitz's review also found that the FBI electronic communication opening the investigation into Papadopoulos said that Papadopoulos \\"made statements indicating that he is knowledgeable that the Russians made a suggestion to the Trump team that they could assist the Trump campaign with an anonymous release of information during the campaign that would be damaging to the Clinton campaign.\\" The \\"Crossfire Hurricane\\" codename was taken from the opening line of \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\", a Rolling Stones song.  Investigations  The FBI's concerns became clear after Brennan shared intelligence about Russian interference with Comey in mid-August 2016. The FBI investigation, code named Crossfire Hurricane, had a large degree of independence from inter-agency efforts to investigate Russian interference. According to an April 2018 House Intelligence Committee report, a \\"fusion cell on Russian election interference, which was analysts from the CIA, FBI, and NSA [...] operated through the election\\". The report also wrote that the fusion cell itself stood down in mid-November 2016. Crossfire Hurricane initially targeted several people connected to the Trump campaign: Papadopoulos, Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort, Carter Page and Roger Stone. During the investigation, the FBI used national security letters to obtain phone records and other documents. FBI agents, believing Trump would lose the election, and cognizant of Trump's claims that the election was rigged against him, were careful to ensure the investigation did not become public, as they feared that if Trump lost he would blame his defeat on the revelation of the investigation. However, after the election, texts on December 15, 2016, from the FBI lead investigator Peter Strzok to FBI attorney Lisa Page showed that Strzok was likely aware of what he took to be politically motivated leaks from other intelligence agencies, although the texts showed Strzok and Page themselves typically coordinated their public communications with the FBI press office. The Office of the Inspector General's June 2018 report states that Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, \\"and several others from the Midyear investigation [by the FBI into Hillary Clinton] were assigned to the Russia investigation, which [the Office was] told was extremely active during this September and October [2016] time period.\\" Strzok \\"was assigned to lead the Russia investigation in late July 2016\\", and E. W. Priestap had a supervisory role over the Russia investigation during an unspecified time period. This investigation's work continued into May 2017. In May 2019, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff told The Washington Post that after Comey was fired, congressmen were no longer briefed on the status of the FBI counterintelligence investigation into Trump associates, despite the multiple criminal investigations spawning from it. = FISA warrants = The FBI had surveilled Carter Page under a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant beginning in 2013 or 2014, on concerns that Russian intelligence was attempting to recruit him. Trump announced his candidacy for President in June 2015, and Page joined his campaign on March 21, 2016. After Michael Isikoff of Yahoo! News reported on September 23, 2016, that Page was being investigated by American intelligence for his contacts with Russian agents, Page immediately left the Trump campaign, while two campaign spokesmen denied he had ever been a part of it. During the summer of 2016, the FBI applied for a warrant to conduct surveillance on four members of the Trump campaign, but this application was rejected by the FISA court as too broad. On October 21, 2016, the FBI filed a new FISA warrant application for Page alone, expressing the FBI's belief that the Russian government was collaborating with Page and possibly others associated with the Trump campaign, and that Page had been the subject of targeted recruitment by Russian intelligence agencies. The rationale advanced in support of this warrant relied in part on Page's prior activities, in part on intercepts of Russian communications or confidential human intelligence sources, and in part on a \\"dossier\\" of raw intelligence findings gathered by former MI6 agent Christopher Steele. The Steele dossier alleged that Page had originated the idea of leaking the DNC emails, and that he was negotiating a share of Rosneft in exchange for Trump lifting sanctions against Russia if elected. The application disclosed that the dossier had been compiled by someone \\"likely looking for information that could be used to discredit\\" the Trump campaign, but did not disclose that it was indirectly funded as opposition research by the DNC and the Clinton campaign. Steele had previously worked with the FBI and was considered trustworthy. The request was signed by Comey and Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, and Judge Rosemary M. Collyer issued the warrant, concluding there was probable cause to believe Page was a foreign agent knowingly engaging in clandestine intelligence for the Russian government. The warrant on Page was renewed three times, each for an additional 90 days. The extensions were issued by three different District Court judges: Michael W. Mosman, Anne C. Conway and Raymond J. Dearie. The first two extensions were signed by Comey, and the last one by his deputy Andrew McCabe after Comey was fired. In addition, Acting Attorney General Dana Boente signed the first extension, and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein signed the last two. = Confidential human sources and informants = Shortly after the opening of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation on July 31, 2016, the FBI used confidential human sources (CHS) to conduct meetings with individuals affiliated with the Trump campaign. During the 2016 Trump Campaign, the FBI used four CHSs and \\"a few\\" undercover agents as part of Crossfire Hurricane, and this \\"resulted in interactions with Carter Page, George Papadopoulos, and a high-level Trump campaign official who was not a subject of the investigation\\".  Stefan Halper, FBI's \\"Source 2\\"  The New York Times reported that agents involved in the Russia investigation asked Stefan Halper to approach Carter Page and George Papadopoulos, and it was unclear whether he had been asked to contact Sam Clovis, who was vice-chairman of the Trump campaign. Halper was a retired Cambridge professor at the time, and had long been an informant connected to the intelligence world. The IG report never uses Halper's name, but refers to a \\"Source 2\\", whom The Telegraph identified as Halper. The IG report says \\"the Crossfire Hurricane team conducted three CHS operations prior to the team's initial receipt of Steele's reporting on September 19, 2016\\", and describes how FBI CHS \\"Source 2\\" contacted three individuals \\"who were still with the Trump campaign.\\" Halper spoke separately to Page, Clovis, and Papadopoulos, and the three men have acknowledged that they agreed to meet with him. Halper's activities were reported by Andrew C. McCarthy in a May 12, 2018, National Review article, and Donald Trump referred to this report in a tweet accusing the Obama administration of planting a \\"spy\\" in his campaign, thus launching the Spygate conspiracy theory. = First FBI operation - Page - Crossfire Dragon = The first FBI CHS operation was at least four meetings between Halper and Carter Page. Page said he \\"had extensive discussions\\" with Halper on \\"a bunch of different foreign-policy-related topics\\". The Washington Post reported Page told The Daily Caller his last contact with Halper was in September 2017, which was the month the last FISA warrant on Page expired. Page and Halper also met at a London symposium on July 11‚Äì12, 2016, before the meetings mentioned above. An anonymous former federal law enforcement official told The New York Times that this earlier contact was coincidental. = Second FBI operation - Clovis = The second FBI CHS operation took place between \\"Source 2\\" and \\"a high-level official in the Trump campaign who was not a subject of the investigation\\" on September 1, 2016. The IG report never names that \\"high-level official\\", but Sam Clovis stated in a radio interview that he met a professor at a DoubleTree hotel in Arlington, Virginia on September 1, 2016, and that the professor had already met Carter Page and later met Papadopoulos. The New York Times reported Page had urged Halper to meet with Sam Clovis, and, according to an anonymous source for the Times, the FBI was aware of the meeting but had not instructed Halper to ask Clovis about issues related to the Russia investigation. Clovis said that he and Halper discussed China, not Russia, during their sole meeting. Clovis also said that while Halper only indicated that he was offering his assistance to the Trump campaign, Clovis was concerned that Halper was creating an audit trail to justify continued surveillance of the campaign. The Washington Post reported that Halper requested a second meeting, but it never happened. = Third FBI operation - Papadopoulos - Crossfire Typhoon = The IG report describes two meetings between \\"Source 2\\" and Papadopoulos on September 15, 2016: a brunch meeting and a pre-dinner meeting. The Washington Post reports that Halper met Papadopoulos in London on September 15, 2016, after Halper invited Papadopoulos on September 2, 2016 to come to London and to write a paper on Mediterranean oil fields. The New York Times reports that Halper was not alone in London; the FBI had sent a female investigator using the pseudonym Azra Turk to meet with Papadopoulos while posing as Halper's assistant. The Times states that Turk's assignment suggests that the FBI wanted a trained investigator to provide a \\"layer of oversight\\". The Times further suggests that Turk may have been assigned to serve as a witness in the event the investigation was ultimately prosecuted and the government needed the credible testimony of such an individual without exposing Halper as a longtime confidential informant. Papadopoulos said that Halper arranged for him to go out for drinks with Turk, who he said was a \\"Turkish National.\\" The New York Times said that Halper accompanied Turk \\"in one of her meetings\\" with Papadopoulos. The IG report says that, according to Crossfire Hurricane case agents, the September 15 meetings that it describes involved an attempt to recreate the conditions of an earlier meeting between Papadopoulos and an FFG (Friendly Foreign Government) official in which they said Papadopoulos had made comments about Russian assistance to the Trump Campaign. In May 2016, Australian FFG officials Alexander Downer and Erika Thompson had met Papadopoulos at a London bar, where Papadopoulos told them that the Russians were in possession of hacked Democratic Party emails containing derogatory information about Hillary Clinton. Two months later, Australian reports to the FBI about this meeting triggered the opening of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation. During these meetings, Halper asked if Papadopoulos knew of any Russian efforts to interfere in the election; Papadopoulos said he did not. The Crossfire Hurricane team assessed that his denials seemed to be a \\"rehearsed response\\", and they \\"discounted Papadopoulos' denials for a number of reasons\\". Stuart Evans, then head of the office of intelligence at DOJ, later said the denial was material to the FISA court case. The denials, and FBI team's assessment of the denials, \\"should have been shared with Justice Department's office of intelligence (OI) 'in order for [OI] to make the determination whether [those denials] should be in the application'\\" to the FISA court.  FBI \\"Source 3\\" - Jeff Wiseman  Another FBI CHS named \\"Source 3\\", \\"an individual with a connection to Papadopoulos\\", was used to interact with Papadopoulos \\"multiple times between October 2016 and June 2017\\". In a meeting with Source 3 in late October 2016, Papadopoulos denied that Russia was \\"playing a big game\\" in the American presidential election. When he was next asked whether Russia had \\"special interests\\", Papadopoulos declared: \\"that's all bullshit\\". He added that he knew \\"for a fact\\" that the Trump campaign was not involved in the DNC hack, adding that such involvement would have been illegal. When asked if Russia had \\"interest in Trump\\", Papadopoulos replied: \\"no one knows how a president's going to govern anyway\\". The FBI failed to include these statements in their subsequent FISA warrant applications. In his report, Horowitz included this failure as among the seventeen \\"inaccuracies or omissions\\" in the FBI's handling of the FISA warrant application.  Michael T. Flynn - Crossfire Razor  Walid Phares under code name Cross Wind was also involved in the story.  Paul Manafort - Crossfire Fury   Jeffry Sessions, Donald J. Trump - Unknown  In SSCI report volume 5 on Russian interference it is mentioned that Jeffry Sessions, Donald J. Trump have FBI investigations but codenames for them were redacted unlike other codenames that are not redacted.  Christopher Steele  Christopher Steele served as a paid CHS for the FBI prior to his work related to the election, receiving $95,000 for this work, which an FBI handling agent found \\"to be valuable and that it warranted compensation\\". Steele received no compensation from the FBI for the later work he did related to the election. The IG report found that Steele and the FBI had differing views about his role related to Crossfire Hurricane. The FBI initially considered him a CHS, a role in which he was told not to discuss what he found with the media. But Steele was also working for Fusion GPS, a private firm that directed him to share his findings with the media. Steele's contact with the media alarmed the leadership at the FBI, which led them to formally end the FBI's relationship with him in November 2016. However, the FBI continued to receive information from Steele indirectly via senior Justice Department official Bruce Ohr through May 2017. In early August 2016, he made a trip to Rome, where he briefed four American FBI officials about some of his research, including the first memo from his dossier. During its intense questioning of Steele, the FBI \\"alluded to some of their own findings of ties between Russia and the Trump campaign\\" and asked Steele about Papadopoulos, but he said he knew nothing about him. The agents also \\"raised the prospect of paying Steele to continue gathering intelligence after Election Day\\", but Steele \\"ultimately never received payment from the FBI for any 'dossier'-related information\\". The subsequent public release of the dossier interrupted discussions between Steele and the FBI. The IG report later confirmed the FBI had initially offered to pay Steele $15,000 for his trip to Rome, but the payment was halted in November 2016 when the FBI formally closed Steele as a CHS because they learned that Steele had shared his research with Mother Jones magazine.  Other sources  The Inspector General's report determined the FBI had \\"several other\\" confidential sources \\"with either a connection to candidate Trump or a role in the Trump campaign\\", but that the FBI did not task these sources as a part of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation. One of these FBI sources \\"held a position in the Trump campaign\\", but this source did not inform the FBI about their role until they had left the campaign, according to the Inspector General. The Inspector General wrote his review \\"found no evidence that the FBI attempted to place any\\" FBI source in the Trump campaign. The review also \\"found no evidence\\" the FBI had tried to \\"recruit members of the Trump campaign\\" to serve as their sources. Finally, the review did not produce evidence \\"political bias or improper motivations influenced\\" the FBI's usage of confidential sources or undercover agents for interactions with members of Trump's campaign. It also emerged that, according to one agent, one of these FBI CHSs was a Trump supporter, as were the FBI employees who cultivated this source. These FBI employees exchanged text messages supporting Trump in the 2016 election.  Transition to Trump administration  On January 5, 2017, FBI Director James Comey, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan, and NSA Director Mike Rogers briefed President Obama about an intelligence report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, which Obama had ordered in December. The discussion touched on the Steele Dossier and the relationship between incoming National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Following that briefing, President Obama met with Comey, Vice President Joseph Biden, National Security Adviser Susan Rice, and Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates. Rice documented the meeting two weeks later, on January 20, in an email she sent just before leaving the White House for the last time. According to Rice's email, during the meeting, President Obama stressed that the continuing investigation should be handled \\"by the book\\" and that he was not \\"asking about, initiating, or instructing anything from a law enforcement perspective\\". The email also stated that Obama directed them to be \\"mindful to ascertain if there is any reason that we cannot share information fully as it relates to Russia\\" with members of the incoming administration. On January 6, Comey, Clapper, Brennan, and Rogers briefed President-elect Trump on the intelligence report. Before the briefing, it was planned that Comey would separately brief Trump on the most salacious aspects of the Steele dossier \\"in the most discreet and least embarrassing way\\". As Comey later described it: \\"At the conclusion of that briefing, I remained alone with the president-elect to brief him on some personally sensitive aspects of the information assembled during the assessment.\\" Comey also assured Trump he was not personally under investigation. He later testified that the FBI leadership had discussed the assurance in advance, and that one member of the team‚Äîlater revealed to be FBI General Counsel James Baker‚Äîhad raised concerns about it. Specifically, according to Comey's testimony, Baker felt that although \\"it was technically true [that] we did not have a counterintelligence file case open on then- President-elect Trump\\" nevertheless because of the scope of the investigation, Trump's \\"behavior, his conduct will fall within the scope of that work.\\" Later, in August 2019, the Office of Inspector General released a report quoting witnesses who said Comey, along with the senior leadership at the FBI, \\"discussed Trump's potential responses to being told about the 'salacious' information, including that Trump might make statements about, or provide information of value to, the pending Russian interference investigation.\\" In February 2017, The New York Times published a report on Crossfire Hurricane, whose name had not been made public at the time. Citing current and former American officials commenting anonymously on the classified investigation, The New York Times reported that communications intercepts and logs showed that Trump campaign members and Trump associates, including Paul Manafort, had \\"repeated contacts\\" with senior Russian intelligence officials \\"in the year before the election\\". In June 2017, former FBI director James Comey stated that the February 2017 Times report was \\"in the main\\" not true, but did not specify what the inaccuracies were. In July 2020, the Senate Judiciary Committee revealed that FBI counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok, one of the leaders of the investigation, had earlier privately made annotations on the February 2017 Times report in which he stated that the FBI was \\"unaware of ANY Trump advisors engaging in conversations with Russian intelligence officials,\\" but that they were aware that (a) Carter Page had contacts with Russian intelligence before he joined the Trump campaign, (b) an associate of Manafort had contacts with Russian intelligence, and (c) Trump campaign officials had contacts with the Russian ambassador and the Russian embassy's congressional liaison. The Senate Intelligence Committee ultimately uncovered that Manafort's associate Konstantin Kilimnik was in fact a Russian intelligence official who had contacts with the Trump campaign, though the FBI was apparently unaware of this in the earlier months of 2017 given Strzok's annotations.  Takeover by special counsel  On May 8, 2017, Trump dismissed Comey from his tenure as FBI Director. More than 130 Democratic lawmakers of the United States Congress called for a special counsel to be appointed in reaction to Comey's firing. On May 17, 2017, Rosenstein appointed Mueller as special counsel under the applicable Department of Justice regulation, and the Special Counsel investigation (also known as the Mueller probe) took over the Crossfire Hurricane efforts, which were still ongoing at the time. Rosenstein's authority to appoint Mueller arose due to Attorney General Jeff Sessions's March 2017 recusal of himself from investigations into the Trump campaign. In June 2017, Peter Strzok, the FBI agent who had led the Crossfire Hurricane investigation up to this point, became a member of Mueller's team. In August 2017, Strzok was removed from the team and reassigned to the FBI's Human Resources department following the Inspector General's discovery of text messages from Strzok expressing a low opinion of Trump and stating his preference that Clinton should win the election by an overwhelming majority. = Criminal charges = George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty on October 5, 2017, to making false statements. On January 27, 2017, Papadopoulos had lied to FBI investigators regarding his contacts with Joseph Mifsud, a Maltese professor with connections to Russian government officials. The special counsel's office was unable to fully investigate Papadopoulos's activities with Sergei Millian, a Belarusian native turned American citizen, because Millian did not cooperate with investigators. Millian previously said he had \\"insider knowledge and direct access to the top hierarchy in Russian politics\\". Flynn pleaded guilty on December 1, 2017, to making false statements. On January 24, 2017, Flynn had lied to FBI investigators regarding his contacts with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian Ambassador to the United States. Manafort pleaded guilty on September 14, 2018, to one count of conspiracy to obstruct justice for witness tampering, and one count of participating in a conspiracy against the United States. NBC News wrote that Manafort's conspiracy charge was related to \\"money laundering, tax fraud, failing to file Foreign Bank Account Reports, violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act, and lying and misrepresenting to the Department of Justice\\". Stone was arrested on January 25, 2019, and charged on seven counts, including witness tampering and lying to investigators. Page was not charged with a crime by the special counsel investigation. Its report said: \\"The investigation did not establish that Page coordinated with the Russian government in its efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election\\". However, with incomplete \\"evidence or testimony about who Page may have met or communicated with in Moscow [...] Page's activities in Russia‚Äîas described in his emails with the [Trump campaign]‚Äîwere not fully explained.\\" = Conclusions = On March 22, 2019, the Special Counsel investigation was concluded, and the Mueller Report was submitted that day. The Mueller Report concluded that Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election did occur \\"in sweeping and systematic fashion\\" and \\"violated U.S. criminal law\\". The first method detailed was \\"a social media campaign that favored presidential candidate Donald J. Trump and disparaged presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\\", which also sought to \\"provoke and amplify political and social discord in the United States\\". The second method of Russian interference saw the Russian military intelligence service, the GRU, hacking into email accounts owned by people associated with the Clinton presidential campaign or Democratic Party organisations, followed by the publication of damaging hacked material.Mueller Report, vol. I, p. 4: At the same time that the IRA operation began to focus on supporting candidate Trump in early 2016, the Russian government employed a second form of interference: cyber intrusions (hacking) and releases of hacked materials damaging to the Clinton Campaign. The Russian intelligence service known as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Army (GRU) carried out these operations. In March 2016, the GRU began hacking the email accounts of Clinton Campaign volunteers and employees, including campaign chairman John Podesta. In April 2016, the GRU hacked into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The GRU stole hundreds of thousands of documents from the compromised email accounts and networks. Around the time that the DNC announced in mid-June 2016 the Russian government's role in hacking its network, the GRU began disseminating stolen materials through the fictitious online personas \\"DCLeaks\\" and \\"Guccifer 2.0.\\" The GRU later released additional materials through the organization WikiLeaks. To establish whether a crime was committed by members of the Trump campaign with regard to Russian interference, the special counsel's investigators used conspiracy law, and not the concept of \\"collusion\\".Mueller Report, vol. I, p. 2: In evaluating whether evidence about collective action of multiple individuals constituted a crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of \\"collusion.\\" In so doing, the Office recognized that the word \\"collud[e]\\" was used in communications with the Acting Attorney General confirming certain aspects of the investigation's scope and that the term has frequently been invoked in public reporting about the investigation. But collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. For those reasons, the Office's focus in analyzing questions of joint criminal liability was on conspiracy as defined in federal law. They used the concept of \\"coordination\\": \\"an agreement‚Äîtacit or express‚Äîbetween the Trump campaign and the Russian government on election interference\\".Mueller Report, vol. I, p. 2: In connection with that analysis, we addressed the factual question whether members of the Trump Campaign \\"coordinat[ed]\\"‚Äîa term that appears in the appointment order‚Äîwith Russian election interference activities. Like collusion, \\"coordination\\" does not have a settled definition in federal criminal law. We understood coordination to require an agreement‚Äîtacit or express‚Äîbetween the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference. That requires more than the two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests. We applied the term coordination in that sense when stating in the report that the investigation did not establish that the Trump Campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities. The Mueller Report found that the investigation \\"identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign\\", that Russia \\"perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency\\" and that the 2016 Trump presidential campaign \\"expected it would benefit electorally\\" from Russian hacking efforts. Ultimately, \\"the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities\\". However, investigators had an incomplete picture of what had really occurred during the 2016 campaign, due to some associates of Trump campaign providing either false, incomplete or declined testimony, as well as having deleted, unsaved or encrypted communications. As such, the Mueller Report \\"cannot rule out the possibility\\" that information then unavailable to investigators would have presented different findings.  Barr/Durham counter-investigation  , Attorney General William Barr is conducting an investigation into the origins of the FBI probe, whether surveillance was adequately predicated, potential overreach by FBI or Department of Justice (DOJ) leadership, and whether the Steele dossier was part of a Russian disinformation campaign. Barr assigned John Durham, the United States Attorney for the District of Connecticut, to lead the investigation. Upon the December 2019 release of the Justice Department Inspector General's findings that the investigation was properly opened on a factual and legal basis, Barr and Durham publicly stated their belief the evidence justified opening only a preliminary rather than a full investigation and indicated they would continue to investigate.  2019 Justice Department Inspector General report  In March 2018, the Justice Department's Inspector General, Michael E. Horowitz, announced that the Office of Inspector General (OIG) had opened a review of the origins of the FBI's Russia investigation, the informants used, and the process followed to authorize surveillance of Carter Page, a foreign policy adviser on the Trump campaign.Michael D. Shear, Comey Admits Errors in Surveillance Warrants, but Defends F.B.I., New York Times (December 15, 2019). On December 9, 2019, Horowitz released his report on the findings of the DOJ OIG investigation. The OIG found no indication that the investigation of Trump and Russia was motivated by political bias, but did make 17 \\"basic and fundamental\\" errors and omissions in its warrant applications to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA) to surveil Carter Page, a foreign policy adviser on the Trump campaign. The report found that the FBI's investigation had a factual basis and was initiated for an authorized purpose, stating: \\"We did not find documentary or testimonial evidence that political bias or improper motivation influenced\\" the agency's decision to open the investigation.Charlie Savage, Adam Goldman & Katie Benner, Report on F.B.I. Russia Inquiry Finds Serious Errors but Debunks Anti-Trump Plot, New York Times (December 9, 2019). The report did, however, criticize the FBI for mistakes related to the FBI's application to the FISA Court for a warrant to wiretap Carter Page, and found that in one application to renew the FISA warrant, an FBI lawyer had altered an email from a CIA liaison to make it appear Page had not been a source for the CIA, although Page had in fact \\"been approved as an operational contact for the [CIA] from 2008 to 2013\\". The report did not speculate on whether the warrant application would have been rejected had \\"any particular misstatement or omission, or some combination thereof\\" been corrected. During Senate testimony after the report's release, Horowitz attributed the warrant problems to \\"gross incompetence and negligence\\" rather than intentional malfeasance or political bias, and stated: \\"The activities we found don't vindicate anyone who touched this. The actions of FBI agents were not up to the standards of the FBI.\\" As a result of the findings, Horowitz announced a broader review of the FBI's FISA warrant application process, to study whether problems with the process are systemic. The report debunked claims, promoted by Trump and his allies, that the Steele dossier had prompted the Russia investigation, and reiterated that the FBI investigation had in fact started in late July 2016, based on a tip from Australian officials regarding Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos. The report also refuted Trump's assertions that Peter Strzok and Lisa Page had initiated the investigation; that decision was made by William Priestap, the assistant FBI director for the Counterintelligence Division. The report criticized the FBI, however, for relying on information from the Steele dossier even though one of Steele's sources told the agency that his statements had been mischaracterized or exaggerated. The OIG investigation found no support for Trump's claims that President Obama had ordered the wiretapping of Trump Tower. The OIG also found no support for Trump's claims that the FBI had implanted a \\"spy\\" within his 2016 campaign, finding \\"no documentary or testimonial evidence that political bias or improper motivations influenced the FBI's decision\\" to use informants (known within the FBI as \\"confidential human sources\\" or \\"undercover employees\\") \\"to interact with Trump campaign officials in the Crossfire Hurricane investigation\\". FBI Director Christopher A. Wray said he accepted the OIG's findings and had \\"ordered more than 40 corrective steps to address the Report's recommendations\\", and added it was \\"important that the inspector general found that, in this particular instance, the investigation was opened with appropriate predication and authorization\\". Trump responded by attacking Wray by name on Twitter.Allie Malloy, Trump lashes out at FBI chief Wray for embracing watchdog report, CNN (December 10, 2019). Attorney General William Barr rejected the OIG's key conclusion and continued to assert that the FBI's investigation into Trump was unjustified.Adam Edelman, AG Barr condemns IG report's finding that FBI probe of Trump campaign was justified, NBC News (December 9, 2019).Sadie Gurman, Barr Rejects Watchdog Finding That FBI Was Justified in Opening Trump Probe, Wall Street Journal (December 9, 2019). James Comey, the director of the FBI who oversaw the Trump-Russia investigation and was fired in May 2017 by Trump, acknowledged the \\"significant mistakes\\" identified by the inspector general, but staunchly defended the FBI and criticized Trump's attacks on investigators. In an op-ed published in the Washington Post, Comey wrote: \\"the truth is finally out,... and those who smeared the FBI are due for an accounting\\" and called upon Attorney General Barr to \\"acknowledge the facts\\" and \\"stop acting like a Trump spokesperson.\\"James Comey: The truth is finally out.

Being a Circuit Judge in 1920, when confirming a sentence in the case of a civil marriage, made in accordance with current law, he was excommunicated by the Catholic Church together with Judge Jos√© J.

G√≥mez and Alfonso Uribe Masses were affected in their fame, their spiritual life and in their professional prestige, by the allegations by some preachers. G√≥mez was forced to close an institute that he directed in Medell√≠n and move to Bogot√°, to occupy an unprofitable position. Therefore, the two jurists resolved to appeal to the Apostolic See, which ruled in their favor, forcing the prelate to compensate them both in the spiritual order and in the material. To avoid problems of this style, an agreement was reached between Cardinal Gasparri and the Colombian diplomat Jos√© Vicente Concha, who was sanctioned by the Colombian Congress by law 24 of 1924. This law established that the Catholic marriage annulled the previous civil marriage with another person and forced public apostasy to baptized Catholics who wanted to marry civil After a long process before the Court of the Roman Rota, it issues a ruling in favor of both judges, which created controversy in the political and religious circles of the country.

Early life Roome was born on August 4, 1812, in New York City. He was the eleventh of twenty children born to Jemima (n√©e Lewis) Roome (1797‚Äì1854) and Nicholas Roome (1775‚Äì1824), a wealthy merchant who served as Superintendent of the \\"Old State Prison\\" in New York City. His paternal grandparents were Rachel (n√©e De Groot) Roome and Peter Roome, a descendant of William Jansen Roome, a New Amsterdam settler. His maternal grandparents were Rachel (n√©e Van Benschoten) Lewis and Thomas Lewis, who served during the Revolutionary War in the 3rd Regiment of the Line under Col. Clinton in the invasion of Canada and as quartermaster under Col. Henry Ludington. Career After a Normal School education, Roome began in the mercantile business. In 1838, he began working in the engineering staff at the Manhattan Gas Light Company, becoming Engineer-in-Chief in 1842 and president in January 1854, succeeding Henry Young. At the outbreak of the U.S. Civil War, Roome was a Captain of Company D in the 7th New York State Militia. He then helped organize the 37th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment of the Union Army and was appointed Colonel in command in 1861. He led the 37th New York for the entire war and for \\"faithful and meritorious service\\", he was brevetted Brigadier General of the U.S. Volunteers by President Andrew Johnson on March 13, 1865. After the war, Roome again served as the president of the Manhattan Gas Light Company until 1884, when he became president of the new organization, the Consolidated Gas Company of New York, of which he was also a director. He served as president until his retirement in 1886. In 1867, he became the 16th President of the Saint Nicholas Society of the City of New York. In 1879, he was Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of New York.

The coronation of King William IV and Queen Adelaide took place on Thursday, 8 September 1831, over fourteen months after he succeeded to the throne of the United Kingdom at the age of 64, the oldest person to assume the monarchy. The ceremony was held in Westminster Abbey after a public procession through the streets from St James's Palace, to which the King and Queen returned later as part of a second procession. Background King William IV succeeded his brother King George IV on 26 June 1830. His first prime minister was Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington who had led a chaotic Tory administration since January 1828. Until 1867, the Demise of the Crown automatically triggered the dissolution of parliament and a general election was therefore necessary with voting between 29 July and 1 September 1830. Although the King's death was the official reason for the election, its importance in British constitutional history was that electoral reform was the major issue of the day, especially with the ongoing Swing Riots. Wellington's Tories won a plurality but continuing divisions on the reform issue resulted in the loss of a vote of confidence on 15 November 1830. Wellington had to resign and, on 22 November, Earl Grey formed the Whig administration which eventually passed the Representation of the People Act 1832 (the \\"Great Reform Act\\") on 7 June 1832. William's coronation was overshadowed by the political turbulence of the time, while the Reform Bill was undergoing debate. The \\"Half Crown-nation\\" The Gold State Coach, drawn by eight horses, in the Royal Mews William's coronation, following that of George IV, his brother and predecessor, on 19 July 1821, was the second of three in the nineteenth century. The next coronation was that of his niece and successor, Queen Victoria, on Thursday, 28 June 1838. According to the historian Roy Strong, William IV had \\"an inbred dislike of ceremonial\\" and he wanted to dispense with the coronation altogether. He conceded that there was a constitutional necessity but insisted that there must be no ceremonial or procession associated with Westminster Hall and this outraged the Tories, who called the event the \\"Half Crown- nation\\".Worsley, p. 94. As Strong says, William's insistence \\"signalled the end of a whole litany of symbolic acts going back to the middle ages, including the coronation banquet, the ritual of the King's Champion throwing down the gauntlet, and endless petty actions related to land tenure\\". William and Adelaide travelled to and from the Abbey in the Gold State Coach, or Coronation Coach, made for George III in 1762 and used in all coronations from 1831. This began the provision of public spectacle for the masses. The King wore his admiral's uniform and the Queen wore a white and gold dress. In terms of cost, William IV and the government refused to repeat the extreme of George IV's lavish coronation in 1821, which cost ¬£240,000, but they went to the opposite extreme and spent only ¬£30,000 on a \\"cut-price\\" event. Seven years later, Queen Victoria's coronation was budgeted at ¬£70,000 to achieve a compromise between the two extremes. Public procession and crowds William IV's coronation established much of what remains today the pageantry of the event, which had previously involved peerage-only ceremonies in Westminster Hall (now attached to the Houses of Parliament) before a procession on foot across the road to the Abbey. The in the Coronation Coach with a cavalry escort. The new monarch travelled in procession by coach to and from the abbey, starting a tradition which has been followed in all subsequent coronations. The budget stressed the procession and there was no coronation banquet. Unlike the Coronation of Queen Victoria in 1838, no real consideration was given to the matter of public entertainment and the people had to make do with the two processions between St James's and the Abbey. At 5 am, a gun salute was fired in Hyde Park and at 9 am, the royal family left the palace followed an hour later by the king and queen in the Gold State Coach, the first time that it had been used at a coronation. The coaches, escorted by Life Guards, passed along Pall Mall to Charing Cross and then along Whitehall to the abbey. Along the route, which was lined by foot guards, temporary stands for spectators had been built, those at Charing Cross could up to three thousand.Strong 2005, p. 401 The return procession left the abbey at 3:30 pm in fine weather.

III for short, was a surface search radar system used by RAF Coastal Command during World War II. It was a slightly modified version of the H2S radar used by RAF Bomber Command, with minor changes to the antenna to make it more useful for the anti-submarine role. It was Coastal Command's primary radar from the spring of 1943 until the end of the war. Several improved versions were introduced, notably the ASV Mark VI, which replaced most Mk. IIIs from 1944 and ASV Mark VII radar, which saw only limited use until the post-war era. Coastal Command's first radar was ASV Mark I, which began experimental use in 1939. Minor improvements were made for the Mark II in 1940 but it was not widely available until late 1941. Having realized that the RAF was using radar to detect their U-boats, in the summer of 1942 the Germans introduced the Metox radar detector to listen for their signals. This gave the submarine a warning of the aircraft approach long before the submarine became visible on the aircraft's radar display. The RAF noticed this in early autumn when crews reported that they would detect submarines that would disappear as they approached. An ASV working in microwave frequencies using the new cavity magnetron had been under development for some time at this point, known as ASVS, but had not matured for various reasons. Robert Hanbury Brown suggested using H2S for ASV but this had been rejected by Bomber Command, who wanted all the sets for themselves. Brown continued development with EMI and presented it again in late 1942 when Metox negated the earlier marks of ASV. Obstruction by Bomber Command led to more delays and it was not until March 1943 that the first dozen aircraft were operational. Deliveries were rapid after this point and Mk. II had been largely replaced by the end of the summer. The Germans had no way to detect the signals from Mark III, which operated in the 10 cm band compared to the 1.5 m wavelength of the Mk. II. Further confusion was caused by a captured RAF officer who stated they carried a device that could detect the Metox radar detector. Combined with other anti-submarine technologies introduced around the same time, submarine losses shot up in the late spring of 1943. By the time that the Germans realised what the British had done, the German U-boat force was almost destroyed and the Battle of the Atlantic was entering its final phase. Naxos, a microwave detector, was introduced in October 1943 but it was nowhere near as sensitive as Metox and had little effect on events; Mark III continued to guide the majority of Coastal Command's fleet until the end of the war. Development =Mark II= Avro Anson K8758, as seen from K6260. The experimental radar on K6260 led development of ASV. Development of the original ASV systems started in 1937, after the team testing an experimental air-to-air radar, noticed odd returns while flying near the shore of the English Channel. They eventually realized these were the docks and cranes at the Harwich docks miles south of them. Shipping also appeared but the team was unable to test this very well as their Handley Page Heyford was forbidden to fly over water. To address this problem, further testing was carried out on two Avro Ansons patrol aircraft. The system was crude, with a simple dipole antenna being held out the window and swung by hand to find returns. For several reasons, the 1.5 m wavelength of the radar system worked better over water than land; notably the large area and flat vertical sides of the ships made excellent radar targets. After some additional development of suitable antennas, the system was largely ready for production by early 1939. Production quality sets were available in late 1939 and entered operational service in January 1940, becoming the first aircraft radar system to be used in combat; a somewhat improved version, Mark II, followed in 1941. The ASV designs had a relatively long minimum range, meaning the submarine targets disappeared from the display just as the aircraft was readying for the attack. At night this allowed the submarines to escape attack. This problem was solved by the Leigh Light, a searchlight that lit up the submarines during the last seconds of the approach. By early 1942, ASV Mark II and the Leigh Light had been installed on large numbers of aircraft. Their effect was dramatic; German U-boats had previously been relatively safe at night and could operate from the Bay of Biscay in spite of it being close to British shores. By the spring of 1942, Biscay was a deathtrap, with aircraft appearing out of nowhere in the middle of the night, dropping bombs and depth charges and then disappearing again in moments. The Germans defeated ASV Mark II by the end of 1942 with the introduction of the Metox radar detector. This amplified the radar's pulses and played them into the radio operator's headphones. With experience, the operators could tell whether the aircraft was approaching or just flying by. It provided this warning long before the echoes off the submarine became visible on the aircraft's display, allowing the U-boat to dive and escape detection. =ASVS, original Mark III= When placed between the poles of a powerful horseshoe magnet, this simple copper block produced many kilowatts of microwave signals, revolutionizing radar. After the early 1940 invention of the cavity magnetron, which produced microwaves at around 10 cm, all of the British forces began development of radars using these devices. Among these were the Air Ministry teams who had developed AI and ASV turned their attention to AIS, the S standing for \\"senitmetric\\". Tests in April 1941 with early lash-up devices against showed they could detect semi-submerged submarines at several miles range. In June 1941 a formal application was made to Robert Watson-Watt, the Director of Communications Development (DCD), to form a separate group to develop an ASVS. This was initially a version of the Mark II with the minimal conversions needed to use the magnetron as the transmitter. During this same period, the TRE was also developing the new H2S radar for Bomber Command. H2S featured a plan-position indicator (PPI), which produced a map-like 360¬∞ two- dimensional display of the ground below the aircraft. The PPI also greatly eased the operator workload for most other radar tasks as well, because they could see the area around the radar at a glance instead of having to manually scan back and forth across areas of interest. ASVS soon adopted the PPI as well, using a cathode ray tube (CRT) display and a second, range-only display, on a CRT. To fit the scanning antenna to the Wellington, which had a smaller belly-turret ring than newer designs like the Handley Page Halifax, the reflector was wide, compared to the similar units for H2S that were wide. With that exception, the units were similar to the H2S Mark I being developed. Philip Dee noted that the first flight on Wellington T2968 did not take place until December 1941 and it was not until 13 January 1942 that he noted \\"ASV saw [the small ship] Titlark at 12 miles\\". Success led to contracts with Ferranti for production electronics and Metropolitan Vickers (Metrovick) for the scanning antenna system, which would be known as ASV Mark III. Ferranti had a prototype ready by the summer of 1942, although they predicted that the first deliveries would not be ready before the spring of 1943. =Testing ASVS= T2968 continued tests until 24 February and on 7 March 1942 was sent to RAF Ballykelly in Northern Ireland to carry out competitive tests against other ASV developments. One was the Mark IIA which had a new transmitter that increased broadcast power from 7 to 100 kW. This was found to increase detection range against surfaced submarines to about and even when the submarine was semi-submerged, just the conning tower above water. This was about twice the effective range of the original Mark II. However, this also greatly increased the amount of clutter as the returns from waves were similarly magnified. A second unit used a similar high-power transmitter that operated on a 50 cm wavelength rather that 1.5 m but this was shown to have no advantages over the basic Mark II. In contrast, the ASVS set showed dramatic improvements. Performance against convoys was when the aircraft was flying at only 500 feet, in spite of the radar horizon being only at that altitude. Other aircraft were visible at and surfaced submarines at . The ASVS was immediately chosen as the new operational requirement, with the 50 cm set also being ordered as a backup. As it became clear the magnetron was going to work, the 50 cm system was cancelled. =H2S, new Mark III= Wellington of No. 458 Squadron RAAF. Robert Hanbury Brown was convinced the H2S radar being developed for RAF Bomber Command could be adapted for anti-shipping work, simply by changing the antenna to one suited to an aircraft flying at rather than . He continued working on this project with the primary developers of H2S, EMI. By late 1942, Metox had been introduced and Ferranti reported that the Mark III would not be available in numbers for some time. Brown's H2S-based adaptation was largely complete and it would be possible to have a small number of hand-built units installed by the end of 1942. This system, working at 10 cm, would be invisible to Metox. The TRE team in charge of ASVS was not under the control of Dee and he was happy to point out their problems. On 25 September 1942, at a meeting at the DCD, he pointed out that the AI and ASV teams were developing separate systems that were, from a signals perspective, almost identical. The only major difference was that ASV had larger displays. Dee proposed abandoning the Ferranti system and using the H2S-based system. The meeting took place during a furious debate over the use of the magnetron; if an aircraft carrying H2S was shot down, it would fall into German hands and be quickly reverse engineered. Frederick Lindemann was especially vocal against the use of the magnetron in H2S and demanded they use a klystron instead. The klystron was already known to the Germans and so fragile that it would be unlikely to survive any crash. Such a concern did not exist for ASV, where the magnetron would fall into the water if shot down. This made ASV a much safer choice for deployment of the very few magnetron units available. The commander of Bomber Command, Arthur \\"Bomber\\" Harris, objected, claiming his bombers would do much more damage to the German U-boat fleet by bombing their pens in France than Coastal Command would by hunting them down at sea. The meeting ended with Coastal Command being awarded priority for the magnetron-based units. On 30 September, Ferranti was ordered to stop work on their design in favour of the H2S-based system, also to be known as Mark III. The disputes with Bomber Command were magnified by problems within Coastal Command, due to the upset that the original Mark III project had been cancelled by the Air Ministry without consulting Coastal Command. That the H2S-based system could be available immediately did not seem to impress the higher echelons of the Command. Adding to the confusion, the commander of Coastal Command, Philip Joubert de la Fert√©, visited the radar development teams at the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) and told them he did not believe in ASV, which led to demands to see it in action. More confusion followed when the TRE teams suggested fitting the new radar on four-engine airframes. These would provide ample room for the installations and superb range over the North Atlantic. On 8 December 1942, a meeting was called over the topic but Joubert refused to intercede in favour of the TRE and they were told to continue with the two-engine Wellington. In service =Initial flights= On the Wellington, the unused ventral turret ring was used to mount a retractable version of the Leigh Light that lowered drag during cruise. The use of the Wellington with ASV Mark III coincided with the move of the Leigh Light from the wing of the aircraft to a retractable \\"dustbin\\" arrangement that extended down through the former belly gun turret ring. This meant the radar scanner could not be placed in that location, as it was on H2S aircraft. The radome was instead moved to the nose. This blocked scanning to the rear, about 40 degrees on either side of the fuselage, and meant the nose guns had to be removed; the nose gunner typically fired on the U-boats to suppress their anti-aircraft gunners and losing this capability was unpopular. By the end of the year, a small number of units were available and in December 1942 two were sent to No. 30 Maintenance Unit for fitting to Wellington VIIIs, which began testing at the Coastal Command Development Unit in January. There was little difference between the H2S and ASV except for the name. Both included two CRTs displays, a 6\\" tube for the main scanner display and a smaller 3\\" \\"height scope\\" below it. The latter was used to measure altitude and for use with Eureka radio beacons and in ASV, it also became used as a timing system for the illumination of the Leigh Light. The priority given to Coastal Command was short-lived and on 8 January 1943, priority reverted to Bomber Command. It became clear that there were not enough fitters to keep the units working and in addition to local recruits, a class from the recently formed RAF Station Clinton in Ontario, Canada sent another 110 technicians. The technicians first had a short stay in the US to train on the similar US- designed DMS-1000. The first operational patrol using one of the two aircraft was carried out on the night of 1943. The aircraft returned from Biscay without having spotted submarines. During the patrol, the aircraft was attacked by German night fighters and the radar operator was able to give the pilot instructions to evade them. Similar patrols also returned empty-handed until the night of 17 March, when H538 spotted a submarine at but their Leigh Light failed and they could not press the attack. The next night the same aircraft spotted a submarine at and depth charged it. Supplies of the magnetron began to improve at the start of March 1943 and on 12 March it was decided to split the deliveries equally between the two commands. A serious limitation of spare parts then became a problem but was eventually solved by sending more spares to Bomber Command, to make up for their higher loss rates. =Into service= Enough units arrived by the end of March for No. 172 Squadron RAF at RAF Chivenor to convert their Wellington XIIs to the Mark III. The squadron was soon pressing attacks every week and in April the number of sightings in the Bay shot up. Calculations demonstrated that the aircraft were at least sighting every submarine in service at that time. Around the time of the introduction of Mark III, the first similar US radar units were arriving, built using magnetron technology introduced to them during the Tizard Mission in late 1940. These DMS-1000s were mounted on the Consolidated B-24 Liberator, one of the very few aircraft with enough range to enable it to fly patrols over the Mid-Atlantic gap and thereby allow aircraft to provide cover over convoys all the way from Halifax to ports in the UK. A B-24 with DMS-1000 was sent to the UK in January 1942 and used operationally by No. 224 Squadron RAF, where the system was referred to as the ASV Mark IV. For reasons unknown, the US Army Air Corps decided to cancel development of the DMS-1000 in favour of the Western Electric SCR-517, although it proved to be far less sensitive. The RAF learned of another unit intended for mounting in US Coast Guard blimps, the Philco ASG, that was comparable to the original DMS-1000. They asked that the ASG be used on their Liberator order instead, referring to it as ASV Mark V. In March, a shipment of Liberators with a mix of DMS-1000, SCR-517 and ASG arrived and were put into service in June. These aircraft lacked the Leigh Light and were generally unable to press the attack but they were invaluable for upsetting the U-boats' approach and calling in ships to attack them. =The tide turns= Mk. III-equipped Sunderland W4030 of No. 10 Squadron RAAF attacks U-243 in the Bay of Biscay in the summer of 1944. By May, the U-boats were subjected to attacks from the time they entered the Bay of Biscay to time they returned. Even if they escaped into the Atlantic, boats were being attacked hundreds of miles from the convoys while they tried to assemble in wolfpacks. This was combined with the arrival of new frigates mounting microwave radars and huff-duff receivers, further hindering U-boat operations; attacking convoys proved almost impossible. Karl D√∂nitz was convinced this was due to a new detection system but remained baffled to its nature. In a mid-May 1943 report to Hitler, he stated: Attempting to address the continual attacks in the Bay of Biscay, D√∂nitz ordered the U-boats to leave port during the day when they could attempt to shoot down the aircraft and day fighter cover could be provided. Coastal Command responded by forming up \\"Strike Wings\\" using high-speed aircraft like the Bristol Beaufighter which travelled in small packs and made hit-and-run attacks, overwhelming the U-boats' defences while also proving difficult for the German fighters to attack as they made one run and then disappeared at high speed. While the U-boats did manage to shoot down several aircraft, the losses of boats continued to climb. In June, U-boats were seen leaving port in flotillas of five or more, providing a higher density of anti-aircraft fire to the point where it was dangerous to approach them, while also reducing the chance of detection per boat. The RAF responded by having the aircraft stand off from the U-boats and call in destroyers, who could sink them with ease. If the U-boats attempted to dive, the aircraft would pounce. For the boats that managed to evade attack in the Bay, operations against the convoys were proving almost impossible. Every attempt to form up was disrupted long before the convoys approached, sometimes hundreds of miles away, when hunter-killer groups tracked them down. Shipping losses to the U-boats plummeted; in June less shipping was lost than any time since 1941. By the end of the month, 30 per cent of the U-boat force at sea had been lost, a catastrophe. D√∂nitz was forced to recall the fleet from the North Atlantic, sending them to secondary theatres while some sort of solution was developed. =British lie, German confusion= In late February 1943, German submarine U-333 was attacked by a Mk. III-equipped Wellington. The gunners were already on high alert and managed to shoot the aircraft down, but as it fell it managed to drop charges around the boat. The submarine survived and reported that the Metox gave no warning of the approach and the Leigh Light was not used. The aircraft simply appeared out of the murk and dropped a string of depth charges. On 7 March, U-156 was attacked in a similar fashion, and radioed in that they believed a new radar was being used. In spite of this early warning of a new system, German efforts were hampered by one of the most effective bits of misinformation of the war. A Coastal Command captain who had been captured after crashing told a plausible story, apparently entirely of his own creation, that threw the Germans off the scent for months. He stated that they no longer used Mk. II for the initial detection, and instead used a new receiver that listened for the slight leakage of the intermediate frequency used in the Metox's tuner. He claimed that it could detect the Metox at ranges as great as . The radar was now only turned on during the last minutes of the approach to check the range and aid the Leigh Light operation. At first, the Germans were skeptical of this claim, but a series of experiments soon demonstrated this was indeed possible. This became outright horror when the equipment was installed in an aircraft and demonstrated its ability to detect a Metox at a distance of while flying at 6,000 feet altitude. The extra 20 miles claimed by the pilot was attributed to the UK's superiority in electronics. From that point, the false information was \\"treated as gospel\\", in spite of much evidence to the contrary. This included reports from boats that were attacked while their Metox was turned off, and one report from an enterprising radio operator in U-382 who had been experimenting with a visual display with the Metox and detected signals that were well outside the normal range. In spite of these reports, on 15 August 1943 a radio message was sent to the entire fleet telling them to turn off their Metox. The most surprising aspect of this confusion was that the Germans were aware of the magnetron and that it was being used for new high-frequency radars. An intact example had fallen into German hands during its second operational use when a Short Stirling carrying H2S was shot down over Rotterdam on the night of 2/3 February 1943. For reasons unknown, the possibility of this system being used for anti-submarine work either never reached the Navy or was dismissed as impossible by Navy engineers. =German countermeasures= Believing the issue was leakage from Metox, boats returning to port were fit with the Wanze radar detector to detect signals in the 120 to 150 cm range but also had the side-effect of having lower signal leakage, greater sensitivity and range. In spite of , U-boat sinkings continued and on 5 November 1943, the use of was prohibited as well, as they believed it too might be tracked. A new version, 2, reduced signal leakage even more but lost range and produced no further improvement. was introduced in the summer of 1943. Sensitive between 75 and 300 cm was still outside the range where it might detect the Mk. III. was much less sensitive than but further reduced leakage to the point that command felt it was safe to use under any circumstances but sinkings continued. Only in September 1943 did the German navy consider the possibility of 10 cm signals. The Luftwaffe was introducing the Naxos radar detector to allow their night fighters to track H2S radars. The receiver was adapted to a new antenna and introduced that month. Naxos was a fragile device and its antenna had to be removed to dive; the commander of U-625 drowned while he struggled to remove the antenna. Naxos offered very short-range detection, on the order of , so even if it detected the Mk. III it offered very little time to dive to safety. Several improvements to the Naxos were introduced during 1944, notably the new antenna that did not have to be removed to dive. offered not only reception but reasonable direction, allowing it to provide initial aiming for the anti-aircraft guns. A further improved antenna, , added antennas to detect 3 cm signals when an H2S unit working on the frequency had been recovered from an RAF bomber. Coastal Command never moved to this frequency on any large scale. Further efforts to understand the British radars led to missions with highly instrumented submarines, U-406 and U-473, both of which were sunk. Naxos was never a convincing solution to the Mark III problem. Improved versions =IIIA= Shortly after the first IIIs arrived, a minor improvement was added, producing the Mark IIIA, or ARI.5153. Although there were a number of minor differences in the equipment, the main difference was the addition of the Lucero system. Lucero was a transceiver tuned to the 1.5 m band radio beacons and transponders used for navigation and IFF Mark III. Lucero's 500 W transmitter periodically sent out signals near 176 MHz, or could be switched to the Blind Approach Beacon System (BABS) at 173.5 MHz. When these signals were received by ground-based transponders, the transponder would reply with a short pulse of its own, typically with much greater power. This pulse was picked up by the Lucero receiver, amplified and sent to the ASV or H2S height scope. Lucero sent a signal every third pulse of the radar and synchronized to begin at the same time, so that the same time base generator as the normal radar signals could be used. Two antennas were used and a motorized switch alternated the receiver between them every 4 or 5 signals, to produce lobe switching. The switch also turned on a signal inverter on the height scope so that signals from the left- side antenna caused deflection to the left, instead of the normal right side. The result was two \\"blips\\" on the height scope; by comparing their amplitude, the radar operator could determine the direction of the beacon relative to the nose of the aircraft. As the number of beacons proliferated, a significant problem with spectrum overcrowding emerged. This led to the movement of the Rebecca/Eureka system to the 214 to 234 MHz band, which in turn led to new versions of Lucero that could be used with this system. =IIIB= By the end of 1943, substantial improvements had been made to H2S, notably more efficient antenna designs, the use of waveguides instead of coaxial cables, roll stabilisation, \\"north-up\\" display and height-corrected displays, that showed ground distance instead of slant range. These were of less interest in ASV, especially the ground-range modifications which were not necessary, due to the low altitudes being flown by the aircraft that meant the slant range was not too different than the ground distance. As Coastal Command did not need the H2S improvements, the first custom ASV system, Mark IIIB was introduced. The operator could expand the \\"zero ring\\" as the aircraft approached the target, keeping the target blip near the outside edge of the display instead of it naturally approaching the centre of the display. The blip was larger on the display which improved the angular resolution from ~6¬∞ to about 1.7¬∞ within the last of the approach. Other changes were minor; before the introduction of the height-range adjustments on the newer H2S, this adjustment was carried out with a simple mechanical calculator called the \\"height drum\\". As this was not needed for ASV, the range lines used for this calculation were removed from the drum and replaced by a line with fixed steps indicating ranges that could be used with BABS without having to look over at the drum to estimate the range to the airfield. The \\"strobe\\", a small blip created by the range drum system that was displayed on the height scope, was no longer adjustable and instead fixed at 1 mile range, used to time the use of the Leigh Light. =IIIC= The well-faired radomes of the Mark IIIC produced less drag than the large antenna sets of the Mark II. By 1943 the Short Sunderland flying boat was a major part of the Coastal Command fleet. These had been using ASV Mark II, whose antennas were mounted under the wings or on either side of the fuselage. Mark III presented a problem as the nose and belly locations that gave the required all-round view could not be used due to the boat hull of the aircraft. This led to a modified version known as Mark IIIC. IIIC used two scanners, one under the outer section of each wing. Their rotation was synchronized to one drive and the radio signal switched between them during the rotation. To maintain coverage in the important dead-ahead area, the signal did not switch to the port-side (left) scanner until 15¬∞ past dead- ahead, so the starboard-side (right) scanner covered 195¬∞, not 180. The signal was provided by a magnetron, piped to the scanners via a waveguide run through the leading edge of the Sunderland's massive wing. In tests carried out in April 1944, the IIIC demonstrated greatly improved performance over the Mk. IIIs in Wellington and Halifax, as much as double, although the reasons were never fully determined. =Sea return discriminator= Large waves have vertical sides that reflect radar efficiently, and this causes false returns on the display. In high sea states this can fill the display with noise, rendering the system useless. This led to experiments with a \\"sea return discriminator\\" to help filter these out. The discriminator was a high pass filter that muted any low-frequency components of the signal as it exited the amplifiers. This caused a -3 dB reduction in signal below about 40 kHz. In experiments in March 1944, it was reported that the system eliminated wave clutter in medium sea states and greatly reduced it in high states. Although it also reduced the signal returned from targets, a good operator could adjust the set so it was not adversely affected for tracking. Replacement When Metox was first introduced, the TRE responded with ASV Mark IIA, a more powerful version of the original Mk. II and included an attenuator known as \\"Vixen\\". The radar operator would mute the signals as they approached the submarine, hiding the fact that the aircraft was nearby. The second idea was to move to a new frequency, which became the Mk. III. In testing in January 1942, Mark III was superior and Mk. IIA was dropped. When Mark III was being introduced, its developers at the TRE felt the Germans would quickly extend the frequency response of Metox to see the new signals and the cycle would repeat. To anticipate the Germans, several developments began rapidly to introduce new models as soon as it became evident this was occurring. As with Mark II, they considered two possible solutions, a more powerful version of Mark III with an attenuator, and the move to a new frequency. These emerged as Mark VI and Mark VII. It was not until October 1943 that RAF crews began noticing the return of the \\"disappearing contacts\\" problem, which was due to the introduction of Naxos. Given this unexpected delay in countering Mark III, both models were well advanced but only in February 1944 was Mark VI first installed on the Wellingtons. Even then, Naxos was never as effective as Metox and in spite of a few instances of Naxos-aided U-boat escapes, these were the exception and Mark III remained the most widely used system until the end of the war. =Mark VI= Two types of attenuator were introduced for the Mark VI effort. Type 53 consisted of two wire rings, each wavelengths long on either side of the waveguide between the magnetron and the antenna. When the rings were rotated parallel to the waveguide, they did not see the signal and did nothing to the propagation. When they were rotated perpendicular to the waveguide, they began to resonate and gave off a signal that, due to Lenz's law, opposed the original signal, muting it. These loops also attenuated the received signal and this was the reason for the move to the 200 kW CV192 magnetron, compared to the original 40 kW version. An improved attenuator, Type 58, added a Sutton tube to the loops, so that they could be switched out of the circuit during the receiver period, allowing the full signal to reach the receiver. With the added power of the new magnetron, units with the Type 58 had significantly improved range. A further improvement was the addition of a lock-follow system. It was found that the operators had difficulty reading the extended blips on the display and turning that into an accurate angle to guide the ship. The Mark VIA added a lobe switching system with two closely spaced antennas that could measure the slight difference in signals strength between the two and use that to directly guide the motors turning the antenna. Once turned on, the system automatically followed the target with an accuracy far better than the human operators. The lock-follow system proved troublesome and it was not available until the U-boat bases in Biscay had been abandoned following D-Day. =Mark VII= The other solution to the potential microwave Metox detector was to move to a new frequency. This was becoming possible in 1943 as the first magnetrons operating in the 3 cm X-band became available. These were already being tested for X band H2S. Moving to 3 cm band offered another tremendous advantage ‚Äì the optical resolution of a radar system varies with the antenna aperture and inversely with the wavelength. In the case of ASV, the antenna produced a beam that was about 10¬∞ wide, although it was most sensitive near the centre. The signal from a submarine was returned when it was anywhere within the centre section, perhaps 5¬∞ on either side and appeared on the display not as a distinct spot but a 10¬∞ wide or greater arc. The operator knew the submarine was near the centre of the arc but other large objects at the same range would also produce similar arcs and these might overlap that of the target. At long range, these could be miles on either side and in medium to high sea states, large waves near the submarine would obscure its return. Moving to 3 cm improved the beam width to about 3¬∞ and made the arcs much shorter. Only waves much closer could obscure the submarine, greatly increasing the level of sea state that the radar remained effective. The advantages of X-band were obvious but Bomber Command was planning on using the same magnetrons. It seemed likely that Coastal Command would once again lose the argument over supply for UK-built units. Mk. VII was not ordered into production, in favour of similar X-band units that would soon be available from the US. The small number of units produced during development were instead used for air-sea rescue aircraft, where their higher resolution allowed them to detect small lifeboats. Description =ASV Mark III vs. H2S Mark II= The original Mark III was identical to the H2S Mark II, except for the antenna system. H2S used a reflector designed to spread the signal out in a wide vertical angle to illuminate the area below the bomber as well as in front of it. The system for ASV modified the design, reducing its width to 28 inches to fit under the nose of the Wellington and reshaping it to send less energy downward, as the aircraft would be flying at low altitude and the area under the bomber was relatively small and did not need to be covered. Another change was to replace the H2S's coaxial cable power feed with a cable that ran to the scanner unit, and then switched to waveguide and feedhorn on the antenna. This modification was later applied to H2S Mark IIA. The IIIC installations on the Sunderland had separate and non-interchangeable antennas, Type 12 and 53. They were fed via a waveguide running through the wing, connected to a magnetron in the fuselage. This was combined with Switch Unit 205, which sent the magnetron output alternately to the two scanners as they rotated. The Type 205 consisted of a muting unit similar to the Vixen system, which alternately muted one output and then the other as the loops were rotated. =Physical layout= The ASV/H2S system consisted of four main components among eleven packages. At the heart of the system was the Waveform Generator Type 26, which was also known more generally as the modulator. This acted as a master clock for the system, triggering the output of the magnetron, switching the system from transmit to receive, starting the trace on the CRT display and other tasks. The modulator was connected directly to several of the main components and even through a Junction Box. The radar signal was generated by the 40 kW peak CV64 magnetron that was part of the Transmitter/Receiver unit, TR.3159 or TR.3191 depending on the version. This fed a signal to the antenna as well as a CV67 klystron. Magnetrons produce slightly different output with every pulse, which makes it difficult to build a receiver that can match this varying signal. The CV67 picked up some of the output pulse and began to resonate at that frequency, providing a steady reference signal for the receiver. The Transmitter/Receiver was also responsible for the first part of the receiver system. A CV43 Sutton tube switched the antenna from the transmitter to receiver side of the system after the pulses were sent. From there it was modulated by a CV101 diode, one of the earliest examples of military-grade solid state electronics and a key element of microwave radars. After the diode, the signal had been reduced in frequency from ~3,300 MHz to a 13.5 MHz intermediate frequency that was then fed back through the aircraft in a coaxial cable to the receiver/amplifier. The Receiver, T.3515 or T.3516, took the 13.5 MHz intermediate frequency and amplified it to usable levels. The output was sent to the Indicating unit Type 162, which contained the two CRTs. If it was equipped, the Lucero receiver, TR.3190, was connected to the height display, sitting (electrically) between the receiver and display. Which of these circuits was in use, along with many other controls, was located on the Switch Unit. This also required the use of the Control Unit 411, which timed and powered the scanning system. =Displays and interpretation= The main display on the Mark III was a CRT. When the Waveform Generator fired, it triggered a time base generator that pulled the electron beam outward from the centre of the display to the outer edge in the same time as the maximum return from the radar at the current range setting. When the system was set to its typical range, the radar signals would take 30 miles / 186,282 miles per second = 0.00016 seconds to travel 30 miles and the same to travel back. At this setting, the timebase pulled the beam across the face in 0.00032 seconds or 320 microseconds. The system could be set to scan at 10, 30 or 50 miles and had a separate mode for long-range Lucero use that displayed signals in the range. A second system rotated the CRT's deflection yoke, synchronised with the scanner using a magslip. This meant that the line being drawn by the time base was rotating around the screen. When a target returned a signal, it would brighten up the beam. By adjusting the brightness of the display, the operator could set it up so that targets appeared as bright patches while the rest of the signal was muted so that it was invisible. The operator had continually to adjust the system so that it was not muting too much and making real returns invisible as well. Because the antenna had about a 10¬∞ beamwidth, the target did not appear as a single spot on the display, but an extended arc. This was, in theory, over 10¬∞ wide as the return might be seen when the antenna was on either side of it, but in practice, the arc tended to be perhaps half that as the signal strength on the edges of the beam was lower. This did not effect the accuracy of the system during the initial approach as the U-boat was somewhere near the middle of the arc, and when it was near the outside of the display this might be a couple of inches wide. However, as the aircraft approached the target the return moved towards the centre of the display where it became progressively smaller, and it was estimated that the average accuracy in heading at close range was only 6¬∞. In later versions this could be addressed by adjusting the unit to push nearby returns out to the edges of the display, using a control originally intended to do the reverse in H2S settings. The display also had controls on the switch box to display a \\"strobe\\" at a fixed delay. This caused a spot to appear a certain time after the trace began, and as the display rotated, this created a circle on the display. This was used by the operator to make accurate measurements of the range to a selected target, which was displayed on the switch box by rotating the Range Drum. Like H2S, the ASV displays also had the option to display a solid line extending from the middle to the edge that represented the flight path of the aircraft. In H2S use, this feature was used because a second system rotated the entire display so that north was always up, like a map. Coastal Command aircraft lacked this system, likely due to a shortage of Distant Reading compasses that fed this information to the display. This heading-indication line was typically not used in ASV, and the associated Control Unit Type 218 was not carried. There was a secondary CRT known as the Height Tube. This lacked the system to rotate the display with the antenna, and always drew a line vertically up the display. Receiver signals did not cause the beam to brighten, but instead deflect to the right, causing a blip to appear. A strobe like the one on the PPI could be moved along this display. As the name implies, the main purpose of the Height Tube was to measure altitude. The operator would move the strobe onto the first major blip, which was caused by signals reflecting off the ground and being picked up in the antenna's sidelobes. This was not as useful in the ASV role, where the low-altitude flights made it easy to measure altitude visually. In ASV, the Height Tube was used primarily with Lucero for beacon tracking. The separate Switch Unit Type 207 contained most of the controls for range and mode selection. It also included the Range Drum, a simple mechanical calculator. This was the location of the mechanical displays for the range and height strobes, the range being indicated by rotating the drum and the height as an arrow-shaped pointer moving up and down the left side of the display. A radar measures the slant range to a target, not its distance measured over the ground. By reading a series of lines on the Height Drum where one of the lines intersected the tip of the height arrow, the operator could read off the ground distance to the target. This feature was of little use in the ASV role, where low altitude flying meant the slant range was similar to the ground range and was later modified to be used primarily with the BABS system. =Lucero= Imperial War Museum Duxford's Sunderland V has bright-yellow Lucero receiver antennas on either side of the nose. When the Switch Box selected Lucero, the height display was switched off the main signal and connected to the Lucero antennas. There were two receiver antennas, one on either side of the aircraft. A motorised switch rapidly selected between the two antennas. One of the two was also sent through an electrical inverter. When amplified and sent to the display, this caused two blips to appear, one on either side of the vertical baseline. The longer blip was more closely aligned with the transponder on the ground, so by turning toward the longer blip one could navigate the aircraft towards it. Performance The performance of Coastal Command operations was a significant area of operational research throughout the war and the Mark III was repeatedly tested both in its own performance as well as relative measures against other radar systems. In its first notable test series, a prototype Mark III was test flown against the high-power Mk. IIA and an experimental system working at 50 cm. The Mk. IIA demonstrated reliable detection a fully surfaced submarine at at 1500 ft, at 1,000 ft and at 500 ft. Against a submarine trimmed down so the deck was closer to the waterline, the ranges were 7 miles at 1,500 feet, 6 miles at 1,000 feet and at 500 feet. Minimum ranges varied from three miles to one mile. The prototype Mark III, referred to as 10 cm ASV in the report, turned in much better results. Large convoys could be detected at ranges of up to while flying at an altitude of 500 feet, which meant the ships were well below the radar horizon and the aircraft was invisible to them. Other aircraft could be reliably seen at a range of and the operator could make some estimate about their direction of travel. Reliable maximum ranges against a fully surfaced submarine were 12 miles at 500 feet and 10 miles at 250 feet. It was these tests that convinced Coastal Command to choose Mark III as their primary system. In November 1944, similar comparisons were carried out between Mark III and Mark VI and then compared to earlier tests of the Mark VII from that August. Using Grassholm Island off the coast of Wales as a target, Mk. III provided an average detection distance of , while Mk. VI's more powerful signals improved this significantly to and the Mk. VII's weaker 25 kW demonstrated a maximum around . Mk. III was estimated to detect a U-boat from the side at , improving to for Mk. VI and as low as for Mk. VII. The range against end-on targets was , and , respectively.

It left the denomination in 2016. With 16 confirmed and five baptized members at the end of 2014, it was the second smallest Reformed Church in Namibia, after the Karasburg Reformed Church, which had 12 confirmed and two baptized members. In 2015, the Aranos congregation grew to 19 confirmed and six baptized members.  Background  From late in the 19th century, when the Mariental Dutch Reformed Church (NGK) (then Gibeon) was founded, until 1930, the church council only recognized five congregations in South West Africa, in which the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NGK) was the only one of the three Afrikaner churches that was active. In 1930, three churches of the GKSA were formed in quick succession, namely in Gobabis, Outjo, and Aranos, after 1,922 Afrikaners left over from the Dorsland Trek were repatriated from Angola in 1929. The Dorsland Trekkers were mainly affiliated with the GKSA, though there were some members of the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NHK), who founded the first NHK denominations in Namibia in 1937, namely Gobabis (July 31), Otjiwarongo (August 21), and Grootfontein (September 4). Due to this migration, the NHK church in Gobabis is older than the NGK church there. The GKSA church in Aranos, however, is 22 years older than its NGK counterpart.  Foundation  Near South West Africa, there were GKSA congregations in Humpata and Que, which were disbanded in 1928 over the aforementioned exodus of Angolan Afrikaners. Those members of the Aranos church who did not come from Angola came northward from the Union of South Africa. The first services were held June 20, 1930, in Kemel farm. On June 21, a service was held at Kema farm, beginning the Gibeon Reformed Church. Services were held on the Omrah farm until June 20, 1959, when the church building finally opened along with the first Classis in South West Africa. From 1940 to 1959, the congregation was also known as the Omrah Reformed Church.  Building of the town church  Dm. H.A. Louw served 76 confirmed and 85 baptized members in Aranos in 1958 (at the time, only three pastors served the 13 GKSA Reformed Churches), prompting the building committee to consider building a church there. The town, around 175 km from Mariental, had at first been known as Arahoab, but due to confusion with Aroab, the name was changed to Aranos, a portmanteau of Arahoab and the Nossob River, on the banks of which Aranos lies. In 1954, Aranos was granted town status, and in 1957, a town board was founded. The town grew quickly at first. During the tenure of Dr. D.C.S. van der Merwe (pastor in Windhoek from 1950 to 1957, who was also responsible for Aranos), the church council obtained a parcel of land from the town. An architect from Windhoek was tasked with the blueprint. The church council issued bonds for the church building, but they were insufficient, so they took ownership. Fortunately, money from sales and donations was plentiful. Most members, especially the younger ones, worked avidly on the project since they wanted a church based where their children were in boarding school. On February 11, 1959, exactly a century after Dm. Dirk Postma founded the GKSA under a lilac tree in Rustenburg in the faraway Transvaal Republic, Dm. H.A. Louw laid the keystone of the Aranos Reformed Church. The members worked hard to build the church under council guidance, especially a builder named Kiepie Erasmus. The builders deviated from the architect's plan, however, for instance completing the concrete tower with cement bricks. Not long after the completion of the church building, the council built a rectory. Dm. Louw's successor, Dm. M.A. Kruger, was the first pastor to live there.  Overview  Over the years, the Aranos congregation coped with financial problems and never grew significantly. At the end of 1958, for example, there were 76 confirmed members, and at the end of 1997, there were 84. However, in the next four years the congregation cut in half to 36 of them and to half again at 16 by the end of 2014. The members' efforts continued, however, in 2016 outside of GKSA auspices. Even before the Middellande Synod (primarily consisting of black churches) and its primarily white or mixed-race counterparts were reclassified into the Klassis format, denominations seceded from Aranos, including Namib-Kus in 2007 and Khomas-Hoogland in 2009. The three congregations were all members until 2016 of the Klassis Waterberg, along with Outjo, Otjiwarongo, and Biermanskool, while the other 12 Namibian churches belonged to Klassis Etosha. Aranos, Outjo, Biermanskool, Namib-Kus, and Khomas-Hoogland all seceded from the GKSA in 2016, by which time Otjiwarongo had already joined the Klassis Etosha.  Pastors  # Kruger, dr.

It stars Sidney Flanigan, Talia Ryder, Th√©odore Pellerin, Ryan Eggold and Sharon Van Etten. It had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 24, 2020. It was also selected to compete for the Golden Bear in the main competition section at the 70th Berlin International Film Festival, where it won the Silver Bear Grand Jury Prize. The film was released in the United States on March 13, 2020, by Focus Features.  Plot  17-year- old Autumn Callahan suspects she is pregnant and goes to a crisis pregnancy center. At the center, she takes a drug store test that confirms that she is 10 weeks pregnant. Though she immediately wants to terminate the pregnancy, she is given literature on adoption and is shown an anti-abortion video. After realizing that she is unable to get an abortion in Pennsylvania without parental consent, she tries to induce a miscarriage by swallowing pills and punching herself in the stomach. When those methods fail, she confides in her cousin, Skylar, that she is pregnant. Skylar steals cash from the grocery store where they work, and the two buy tickets to New York City. On the bus they meet Jasper, a young man who is persistently interested in Skylar even though she tries to blow him off. At the Planned Parenthood clinic, Autumn learns that the crisis pregnancy center lied to her about how far along she was and that she is actually 18 weeks pregnant. Though she is still able to get an abortion, she must go to a secondary clinic the following morning in order to have the abortion performed. Autumn and Skylar spend an uncomfortable night riding the subway and playing games at an arcade. The following morning at the clinic, Autumn learns that a second-trimester abortion is a two-day procedure and that paying for the abortion will wipe out most of her funds. The counselor also asks her a series of questions about her sexual partners which reveal that Autumn's partners have been physically and sexually abusive. Out of money, Skylar realizes the two have no way of going home. As Autumn refuses to let Skylar call either of their mothers, Skylar reaches out to Jasper, who takes them bowling and to karaoke. At the end of the night, Skylar asks Jasper to loan them the money for their bus tickets, which he agrees to. Skylar leaves with Jasper to find an ATM, and Autumn later goes looking for them. She finds them kissing behind a column. Realizing Skylar doesn't like it, Autumn grabs Skylar's hand from behind the column to comfort her. In the morning, Autumn goes to her appointment and has the abortion. Autumn and Skylar go to a restaurant, where Skylar asks her questions about the procedure, but Autumn remains vague. The two ride a bus back to Pennsylvania.

He played for Canterbury-Bankstown in the New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) competition. Playing career Young made his first grade debut for Canterbury against Balmain in Round 4 1944 at the Leichhardt Oval. In the 1944 season, Young made 4 appearances as Canterbury went from winning the premiership in 1942 to running last in 1943 and 1944 claiming the wooden spoon. As of the 2019 season, no other club has gone from premiers to wooden spooners the next season with the exception of Melbourne who won the premiership in 2009 but were later stripped of the title for major breaches of the salary cap in 2010 and made to play for no points which resulted in the club coming last. In 1947, Canterbury went on to finish as minor premiers that season. Young scored a try in Canterbury's 25-15 semi final victory over Newtown before setting up a grand final clash against Balmain. Balmain would go on to win the grand final 25‚Äì19 at the Sydney Sports Ground. Due to the rules at the time, Canterbury were allowed to challenge for a rematch as they had finished as minor premiers. In the grand final challenge, Young played at centre as Balmain once again defeated Canterbury 13‚Äì9 with all of Balmain's points coming from Joe Jorgenson.

Zinke, 583 U.S. _ (2018), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court upheld the Gun Lake Trust Land Reaffirmation Act, which precludes federal courts from hearing lawsuits involving a particular parcel of land., 138 S. Ct. 897 (2018). This article incorporates public domain material from this U.S government document. Although six Justices agreed that the Gun Lake Act was constitutional, they could not agree on why. In an opinion issued by Justice Thomas, a plurality of the Court read the statute to strip federal courts of jurisdiction over cases involving the property and held that this did not violate Article III of the U.S. Constitution. In contrast, Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor, both of whom concurred in the judgment, upheld the Act as a restoration of the government's sovereign immunity. Chief Justice Roberts, writing for himself and Justices Kennedy and Gorsuch, dissented on the ground that the statute intruded on the judicial power, in violation of Article III.  Background  = Legal backdrop = The Supreme Court has repeatedly struggled to reconcile Congress's power to alter the metes and bounds of federal court jurisdiction with the judicial power, which Article III vests in the courts alone.See Sarah Herman Peck, Cong. Research Serv., R44967, Congress‚Äôs Power over Courts: Jurisdiction Stripping and the Rule of Klein (2018), https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44967.pdf. Patchak v. Zinke implicated two of these cases in particular:  United States v. Klein  United States v. Klein, 13 Wall. 128 (1872): During the Civil War, the Treasury Department seized abandoned or captured property in Confederate territory to support the Union.Abandoned Property Collection Act, ch. 120, 12 Stat. 820 (1863). After the War, President Johnson declared that Southerners could receive the proceeds of their confiscated property after receiving a presidential pardon and swearing an oath of loyalty to the United States.. Subsequently, in United States v. Padelford, the Supreme Court held that a pardon rendered such claimants \\"innocent in law as though he had never participated\\" in the War and, therefore, was entitled to the proceeds. (internal quotation marks omitted). In response, Congress enacted a law providing that a presidential pardon in a suit brought for the proceeds of abandoned or captured property shall be treated as \\"conclusive evidence\\" of disloyalty, and, upon such proof, \\"the jurisdiction of the court in the case shall cease, and the court shall forthwith dismiss the suit of such claimant.\\"Klein, 80 U.S. at 133. The Court struck down the statute. The Court held that, because Congress \\"prescribe[d] a rule for the decision of a cause in a particular way,\\" it had \\"passed the limit which separates the legislative from the judicial power.\\"Klein, 80 U.S. at 147. But the Court also suggested that the law was unconstitutional because it \\"impair[ed] the effect of a pardon, and thus infring[ed] the constitutional power of the Executive.\\" Thus, while its outcome is clear, the precise holding of Klein has generated much debate.See e.g., , 136 S. Ct. 1310, 1323 n.18 (2016) (acknowledging that Klein has been described as \\"a deeply puzzling decision\\" (citation omitted)); Gordon G. Young, Congressional Regulation of Federal Courts‚Äô Jurisdiction & Processes: United States v. Klein Revisited, 1981 Wis. L. Rev. 1189, 1195 (1981) (\\"[T]he Klein opinion combines the clear with the delphic.\\").  Bank Markazi v. Peterson  Bank Markazi v. Peterson, 136 S.Ct. 1310 (2016): Victims and estate representatives sued Iran for its role in the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut, Lebanon under 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1605A, which provides \\"money damages . . . against a foreign state for personal injury or death that was caused by\\" acts of terrorism., 136 S. Ct. 1310, 1317 (2016) (quoting ). The plaintiffs prevailed in their lawsuit and sought to enforce the judgment against the Central Bank of Iran, known as \\"Bank Markazi,\\" under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, which authorizes the enforcement of judgments obtained under ¬ß 1605A against \\"blocked assets.\\"Bank Markazi, 136 S. Ct. at 1318 (quoting ); see also Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, (2002). While the litigation was pending, Congress enacted the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (codified at 22 U.S.C. ¬ß 8772).Bank Markazi, 136 S. Ct. at 1318 (citing ); see also Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, (2012). That statute referenced the litigation by docket number and authorized the Bank's assets to be seized to enforce a judgment pursuant to ¬ß 1605A if the court concluded the assets were (1) held in the United States; (2) a \\"blocked asset\\"; (3) an asset of Iran; and (4) owned only by Iran.. Relying on Klein, Bank Markazi argued ¬ß 8772 violated Article III by \\"effectively dictat[ing] specific factual findings in connection with a specific litigation‚Äîinvading the province of the courts.\\"Bank Markazi, 136 S. Ct. at 1322 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Supreme Court disagreed. The Court upheld ¬ß 8772 on the logic that Congress \\"does not impinge on judicial power when it directs courts to apply a new legal standard to undisputed facts.\\"Bank Markazi, 136 S. Ct. at 1325. Here, the statute \\"provides a new standard clarifying that, if Iran owns certain assets, the victims of Iran- sponsored terrorist attacks will be permitted to execute against those assets.\\"Bank Markazi, 136 S. Ct. at 1326. In upholding the statute, however, the Court cautioned that an Act which merely said \\"in Smith v. Jones, Smith wins\\" would violate Article III because it \\"fails to supply any new legal standard.\\" Chief Justice Roberts, joined by Justice Sotomayor, dissented, arguing Congress unconstitutionally invaded the judicial power by \\"enacting a bespoke statute tailored to this case that resolves the parties‚Äô specific legal disputes to guarantee respondents victory.\\"Bank Markazi, 136 S. Ct. at 1330 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting). = Facts and Procedural History = The Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians (also known as the Gun Lake Tribe) live in what is today southwestern Michigan.Patchak, 138 S. Ct. at 903. Despite having been recognized by the federal government in numerous treaties during the 1800s,See, e.g., The Treaty of Greenville, Aug. 3, 1795, 7 Stat. 49; Treaty with the Ottawa, etc., U.S.-Ottawa, Chippewa, and Potawatomi Nations of Indians, Aug. 29, 1821, 7 Stat. 218. the Secretary of the Interior did not formally recognize the Band until 1999.Final Determination to Acknowledge the Match-e-be-nash-she-wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians of Michigan, (1998). Once the Band received recognition, it sought to obtain land to reaffirm its sovereign status. The Tribe identified a 147-acre parcel of land in Wayland Township, Michigan (the Bradley Property) and asked the Secretary of the Interior to take the land into trust under the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA) (codified at 25 U.S.C. ¬ß 465). The Secretary agreed in 2005, and the Department of Interior published a notice in the Federal Register announcing the Secretary's intent to take the Bradley Property into trust.Notice of Determination, (2005). In response, the Michigan Gambling Opposition sued to stop the Secretary. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed the lawsuit, and the D.C. Circuit affirmed. In 2009, the Secretary took the land into trust. Before the Secretary could do so, however, David Patchak, a resident of Wayland Township, filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, challenging the Secretary's action under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (codified at 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 500 et seq.) and the IRA. Specifically, he contended the Secretary lacked authority to take the Bradley Property into trust because the IRA empowers the Secretary to take land into trust only for tribes who were recognized when that law was enacted in 1934, but the Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish were not federally recognized until 1999. While Patchak's suit was pending, the Supreme Court embraced this interpretation of the IRA in Carcieri v. Salazar.. The District Court dismissed Patchak's claims, concluding he lacked standing to vindicate violations of the IRA.Patchak, 646 F. Supp. 2d at 76. The D.C. Circuit reversed and also held that the government had waived its sovereign immunity through the APA, which permits claims for prospective, nonmonetary relief. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on both issues.Match- E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, SCOTUSblog, https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/match-e-be-nash-she-wish-band-of- pottawatomi-indians-v-patchak/ (last visited May 3, 2019). In 2012, the Court affirmed the D.C. Circuit in Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, holding that Patchak's lawsuit could proceed.. In September 2014, while Patchak's case was again pending before the district court, Congress enacted the Gun Lake Act.Gun Lake Trust and Reaffirmation Act, (2014). That law contained two sections: * Section 2(a) provides: \\"The land taken into trust by the United States for the benefit of the Match-E-Be-Nash- She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians and described in the final Notice of Determination of the Department of the Interior (70 Fed. Reg. 25596 (May 13, 2005)) is reaffirmed as trust land, and the actions of the Secretary of the Interior in taking that land into trust are ratified and confirmed.\\" * Section 2(b) provides: \\"Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an action (including an action pending in a Federal court as of the date of enactment of this Act) relating to the land described in subsection (a) shall not be filed or maintained in a Federal court and shall be promptly dismissed.\\" The legislative history of the Act makes clear that Congress acted with the express purpose of \\"void[ing] a pending lawsuit challenging the lawfullness of the Secretary's original action to acquire the Bradley Property,\\" even mentioning David Patchak by name.H. Rep. No. 113-590, at 2 (2014). Although Patchak argued the Act was unconstitutional, the district court dismissed his case on the ground that it \\"lack[ed] jurisdiction to reach the merits of plaintiff‚Äôs claim.\\" The D.C. Circuit affirmed the District Court's ruling because, \\"if an action relates to the Bradley Property, it must promptly be dismissed.\\" The Supreme Court granted certiorari on May 1, 2017.Patchak v. Zinke, SCOTUSblog, https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/patchak-v- jewell/ (last visited May 3, 2019). =Relevant Constitutional Provisions= Section 1, Article III of the U.S. Constitution provides: \\"The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.\\"U.S. Const. Art. III, ¬ß 1.  Supreme Court  = Question Presented = Does a statute violate the Constitution's separation-of-powers principles if it directs the federal courts to dismiss any pending lawsuit against a particular property but does not amend substantive or procedural laws? = Justice Thomas‚Äôs Plurality Opinion = Writing for a plurality of the Court, Justice Thomas held the Gun Lake Act was a lawful exercise of Congress's legislative authority that did not encroach on the juidiciary's Article III powers.Patchak, 138 S. Ct. at 904. He acknowledged that Congress could not pass a statute that says, \\"In Smith v. Jones, Smith wins,\\" because this would impermissibly withdraw from the courts \\"the power to interpret and apply the law to the [circumstances] before it.\\"Patchak, 138 S. Ct. at 905 (internal quotation marks omitted). But he went on to observe that Article I entitles Congress to \\"make laws that apply retroactively to pending lawsuits, even when it effectively ensures that one side wins.\\" Thus, to determine if the Act impermissibly usurps the judiciary's power, the Court had to examine whether it \\"compels findings or results under old law,\\" or \\"changes the law.\\" The former is unlawful; the latter is constitutional. The Gun Lake Act passed this test because it changes the law.See Patchak, 138 S. Ct. at 905-08. The Act's language and its consequences‚Äîthat actions relating to the Bradley Property \\"shall be promptly dismissed\\"‚Äîmade the law jurisdictional.See Patchak, 138 S. Ct. at 905-06. And laws \\"that strip jurisdiction change the law for the purpose of Article III.\\"Patchak, 138 S. Ct. at 907 (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, Justice Thomas concluded the Act \\"is a valid exercise of Congress's legislative power.\\"Patchak, 138 S. Ct. at 908. Justice Thomas rejected Patchak's arguments that even if the Act is jurisdictional, it nonetheless violated Article III. Regarding Patchak's contention that the Act was unlawful because it \\"directs\\" an outcome without having courts interpret new law, Justice Thomas again repeated that the statute \\"creates new law for suits relating to the Bradley Property.\\" And he dismissed Patchak's attempt to analogize his case to United States v. Klein. Rather, Justice Thomas clarified that the statute in Klein was unconstitutional because Congress could not alter the effect of presidential pardons and therefore \\"could not achieve the same result by stripping jurisdiction.\\"Patchak, 138 S. Ct. at 909. Thus, this case was unlike Klein because the Gun Lake Act \\"does not attempt to exercise a power that the Constitution vests in another branch.\\" Justice Thomas likewise found unpersuasive Patchak's argument that the Act violated Article III because it \\"attempts to interfere with the Court‚Äôs decision in Patchak I.\\" Although Congress cannot compel courts to reopen and alter final judgments, Congress does have the power to change the applicable law and direct courts to apply it to pending cases. Thus, Patchak's claim was meritless because his suit was pending when Congress passed the Act. That the Act effectively singled out Patchak's lawsuit was of no moment, Justice Thomas explained, pointing out that Congress targeted specific cases in Bank Markazi v. Peterson by referencing their docket number in the statute.Patchak, 138 S. Ct. at 910. = Concurrences =  Justice Breyer‚Äôs Concurrence  Justice Breyer joined the plurality in full but also wrote a separate concurrence in which he agreed with Justice Thomas that the Act did not violate Article III.Patchak, 138 S. Ct. at 911-12 (Breyer, J., concurring). In his view, Section 2(b)‚Äôs jurisdiction stripping provision reinforces Section 2(a), in which Congress expressly gave the Secretary authority to take the Bradley Property into trust. Accordingly, Section 2(b) merely \\"gilds the lily\\" by \\"provid[ing] an alternative legal standard for courts to apply that seeks the same real world result as does [Section 2(a)]: The Bradley Property shall remain in trust.\\"Patchak, 138 S. Ct. at 911. To Justice Breyer, Congress's use of its jurisdictional powers to \\"supplement\\" Section 2(a)‚Äî\\"action that no one has challenged as unconstitutional\\"‚Äîwas \\"unobjectionable.\\"  Justice Ginsburg‚Äôs Concurrence  Justice Ginsburg issued an opinion concurring in the judgment for herself and Justice Sotomayor.Patchak, 138 S. Ct. at 912-13 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in the judgment). In her view, the Act was best read as a retraction of the federal government's waiver of sovereign immunity. To be sure, sovereign immunity did not initially preclude Patchak's lawsuit because he sought declaratory and injunctive relief, remedies the APA permits plaintiffs to bring against the federal government.Patchak, 138 S. Ct. at 912-13 (citing ). \\"But consent of the United States to suit may be withdrawn at any time.\\" And that is precisely what the Act achieved, she observed. That is, Congress \\"displace[d] the APA's wiaver of immunity for suits against the United States with a contrary command applicable to the Bradley Property.\\"Patchak, 138 S. Ct. at 913. Accordingly, Justice Ginsburg would have affirmed the D.C. Circuit's opinion without reaching the constitutional questions Patchak raised.  Justice Sotomayor‚Äôs Concurrence  Justice Sotomayor also wrote an opinion concurring in the judgment.Patchak, 138 S. Ct. at 913-14 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in the judgment). Like Justice Ginsburg, she believed the Act \\"should not be read to strip the federal courts of jurisdiction but rather to restore the Federal Government's sovereign immunity.\\" She wrote separately to point out the relevance of Match-E-Be-Nash- She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, which addressed whether sovereign immunity foreclosed Patchak's lawsuit.Patchak, 138 S. Ct. at 913-14 (citing Match‚Äì E‚ÄìBe‚ÄìNash‚ÄìShe‚ÄìWish Band of Pottawatomi Indians, ). There, the Court suggested that Congress could reassert its sovereign immunity as a way to end the lawsuit.See Patchak, 138 S. Ct. at 914. Justice Sotomayor thus voted to affirm on that \\"basis alone\\" and declined to address the separation- of-powers issues. = Chief Justice Roberts‚Äôs Dissent = Chief Justice Roberts, joined by Justices Kennedy and Gorsuch, dissented from the plurality's ruling.Patchak, 138 S. Ct. at 914-22 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting). In his view, the Gun Lake Act was indistinguishabe from a statue which commanded \\"In Smith v. Jones, Smith wins.\\"Patchak, 138 S. Ct. at 915-16, 920. The Chief Justice argued that the Court's precedents, including Klein, demonstrate \\"Congress violates [Article III] when it arrogates the judicial power to itself and decides a particular case.\\"Patchak, 138 S. Ct. at 916. In his view, the Act ran afoul of that clear rule: It \\"target[s] a single party for adverse treatment and direct[s] the precise disposition of his pending case.\\"Patchak, 138 S. Ct. at 918. Indeed, he found the Act even more objectionable than the one at issue Bank Markazi v. Peterson. Whereas the statute in Bank Markazi, created a standard for courts to apply in particular cases, the Gun Lake Act \\"prevents the court from applying any new legal standard,\\" instead mandating dismissal.Patchak, 138 S. Ct. at 917-18. For that reason, \\"it is idle to suggest that ¬ß 2(b) preserves any role for the court beyond that of stenographer.\\" The Chief Justice then turned to contest the plurality's analysis. First, the Act was not jurisdictional. The Court, he explained, has \\"adopted a bright line rule treating statutory limitations as nonjurisdictional unless Congress clearly states otherwise,\\" and here the Act \\"does not clearly state that it impose a jurisdictional restriction.\\"Patchak, 138 S. Ct. at 919 (internal quotation marks omitted). Second, in his view, the Act does not \\"change the law.\\" To do so, a statute \\"must imply some measure of generality or preservation of an adjudicative role for the courts.\\"Patchak, 138 S. Ct. at 920. Here, however, the Act merely strips the courts of jurisdiction over a particular lawsuit. Finally, he responded to each of the concurrences. He dismissed the position of Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor that the Act was a restoration of sovereign immunity.Patchak, 138 S. Ct. at 921-22. To reinstate sovereign immunity, Congress \\"must express an unambiguous intention to withdraw a remedy.\\"Patchak, 138 S. Ct. at 921 (internal quotation marks omitted). Since the Act did not reference sovereignty or immunity, it did not reflect this clear intent. And with respect to Justice Breyer, the Chief Justice observed, \\"Congress cannot 'gild the lily' by relieving the Judiciary of its job‚Äîapplying the law to the case before it.\\"Patchak, 138 S. Ct. at 922. Thus, the Chief Justice would \\"hold that Congress exercises the judicial power when it manipulates jurisdictional rules to decide the outcome of a particular pending case\\" and, consequently, would invalidate the Gun Lake Act.Patchak, 138 S. Ct. at 919-20.

She was married to Black Nova Scotian and internationally known political activist Rocky Jones, whom she influenced to become more active in the issues of black activism causes espoused by Malcolm X and writer James Baldwin, during the black radicalism period of the 1960s. Together they were among the founders of Kwacha House, an interracial youth club in Halifax and were later instrumental in bringing Stokely Carmichael and the Black Panther Party to Halifax. They adopted the radicalized language of the Panthers and organized with Carmichael's help the Black United Front, taking on issues of police brutality, employment and housing discrimination in the black community.The New York Times, Joan Jones, 79, Who Fought Racism in Nova Scotia, Dies Sunday April 14, 2019, p. 24 Early life and education Joan Bonner was born to Eugene and Elsie Bonner in Buffalo, New York in 1939. The family moved to Oakville, Ontario where she attended school, graduating from Oakville Trafalgar High School. She went seeking work opportunities in Toronto, where she met and married Burnley Jones, a fifth-generation African Canadian whose lineage went back to the late 18th century. The couple left the province, moving to Halifax, Nova Scotia where they joined the relatively small black community and academia where Burnley taught at Dalhousie and was instrumental in creating the Black Historical and Educational Research Organization (HERO Project), a pioneering oral history project on Black culture. Together in 1965 they formed Kwacha House; Eastern Canada's first inner-city self-help program for the culturally diverse, lower socio-economic population. Civil Rights Movement The group of civil rights idealists that held court in Joan and Rocky's (as Burnley was known) kitchen discussed many of the same issues the African-American civil rights were concerned with, namely entrenched racism. Nova Scotia was the destination for American slaves, Black Loyalists who had fought for the British and following the American revolutionary war's conclusion had come from as far south as the Carolinas thru often hostile territory to refuge in Canada and additionally, refugees from the War of 1812. When the British moved rebellious Maroons from Jamaica to Sierra Leone they sojourned in farming communities about Nova Scotia before emigrating in 1800, with descendants remaining in Halifax and other cities, leading to a significant population of minorities who complained of discrimination in housing and employment. This community was not large enough to gain any political power and school segregation had persisted, with blacks disproportionately subject to high drop-out rates, over policing and incarceration and high unemployment. One particular event mid-sixties was the urban renewal project which resulted in the demolition of a Halifax community known as Africville. The Joneses were part of an emerging black empowerment movement and while Rocky was the face of black radicalism in the media, Joan was the driving force and intellectual organizer behind many of the political events that their home became the locus of and to those involved in Civil Rights activism. Joan ran the day to day operation at Kwacha House, where impoverished youth found programs designed to end the cycle of school dropout and incarceration; and could also gain self-empowerment, which continued for decades under her supervision. In 1968 the Joneses brought the Black Panther Party to Halifax, forming with their help the Black United Front as a bulwark against employment and housing discrimination, and confronting the authorities on police brutality. This brought them under racist police surveillance, which ended in 1994 when the surveillance was revealed. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police apologized through the then Police Commissioner, Phillip Murray. Ms Jones, by then divorced from Rocky, told a newspaper that the apology did not undo the damage caused over the previous 30 years, as lost employment opportunities, shunning in economic endeavors and other negative attributes had had a detrimental effect to the couple during their best years. She said, > ‚Äú I strongly believe that they interfered in our ability to have certain > jobs or to have an income in this city.‚Äù The New York Times, April 4, 2019, Obituary, p. 24 Career She held jobs in the Canadian public works department and in the provisional government. She was a business-woman and owner of two boutiques, also doing work at Nova Scotia's office of Legal Aid from which she retired in 2008. Her 1990's column on race relations were regularly printed in the Chronicle Herald of Halifax, which also published a memorial after her death. It was noted that while she kept writing her column, the newspaper got all types of negative mail, including hate mail directed at her column. Interviewed about her Black History Month observances in 1995 when she led the push for its becoming a national observance (BHM became nationally observed in Canada in 1996), she stated that while black racial issues seem insurmountable, she would continue the fight to end racism and would continue to be a role model to youth because the battle was important. > \\"It's part of our responsibility to educate, nurture and bring along the > next group that are going to have to deal with those things.\\" Death Jones died of unspecified causes on April 1, 2019, at the age of 79.

History of strikes Some examples of industrial actions taken prior to the mid-20th century included the dock strike of 1890 and the 1911 Liverpool general transport strike. A strike in late 1967 affected Liverpool and Birkenhead, though docks in and around London were also affected. The strike involved around 16,000 workers and caused interference with trade exports, with pay systems a core factor. Just two years later in July 1969, dockers again striked with colleagues from Birkenhead, involving 11,000 men over a dispute regarding handling goods at an Aintree container base. A few years later in 1972, Liverpool dockers joined in a national dock strike to safeguard jobs, protesting against redundancy plans from firms using cheaper casual labour. The longest known dispute, which was technically not a strike as the workforce were all dismissed, was the Liverpool dockers' dispute (1995‚Äì98) that ended with settlement pay and a few job reinstatements.

Biography  Horacio Valenzuela was born in Santiago on 5 April 1954. He studied forestry at the Universidad de Concepci√≥n and the Universidad de Chile before entering the Major Seminary of Santiago. He was ordained a priest on 17 August 1985 by Cardinal Juan Francisco Fresno Larra√≠n and filled a variety of pastoral assignments over the next decade. On 11 March 1995, Pope John Paul II named him titular bishop of Gummi in Proconsulari and Auxiliary Bishop of Santiago de Chile. He received his episcopal consecration on 7 May from Cardinal Carlos Cardinal Oviedo Cavada. John Paul named him Bishop of Talca on 12 December 1996. Before becoming a priest Valenzuela was part of a religious association formed by Fernando Karadima, and he remained part of his circle. Valenzuela defended Karadima when he faced charges of sexual abuse of minors, and was himself accused along with several other bishops of abetting Karadima. Valenzuela said he never witnessed inappropriate kissing and that \\"Regarding the way in which he exercised spiritual direction, one must consider the strong character of Father Fernando which led him to correct it severely in order to educate: my experience is that this was not to exert undue pressure, control and manipulation. He corrected me many times and I appreciate it. We were all adults and if anyone felt uncomfortable he could get away\\". On 18 May 2018, Valenzuela submitted his resignation to Pope Francis, as did all the Chilean bishops at the conclusion of a three-day meeting in Rome. Pope Francis accepted Valenzuela's resignation on 28 June 2018. In a farewell message to the people of his diocese, Valenzuela apologized in general terms \\"for what I did not do or did wrong\\", without mentioning the sexual abuse crisis or its victims. He declined to give interviews, even climbing out a window to avoid a reporter. In December 2018, the Vatican launched a formal investigation into allegations of clerical abuse of nuns in the Tacla Diocese while Valenzuela was bishop. Some victims alleged that Valenzuela was aware of the abuse. Valenzuela had a private audience with Pope Francis on 15 April 2019.

The older identification with the ruins at the site of Qasr Bardawil has been abandoned after it being classified as a Bronze Age site. History according to Qalanisi The history of the castle is based on the works of Damascene politician and chronicler ibn al-Qalanisi (c. 1071‚Äì1160), which say that the Franks built the castle in 1105 and that Toghtekin, atabeg of Damascus, destroyed it on December 24th of the same year. The castle was one of three, including Chastel Neuf and the castle at Toron, built in the region. The uncompleted castle of al-Al was first used in 1105 and Hugh was killed returning there after a successful raid in Damascene territory, after which Toghtekin, not wishing to have a Frankish stronghold so close to Damascus, attacked and easily conquered site, killing or taking captive the defenders. The Franks then abandoned the site as too difficult to defend, relocating to Cave de Su√®te. Doubts about existence Moshe Sharon, in his monumental Corpus Inscriptionum Arabicarum Palaestinae (CIAP), plainly states that there has been no such castle at all. He considers it to be a legend that must have begun with someone identifying the Arabic name of the site, Qasr Bardawil (qasr meaning castle), with the Crusader king Baldwin I, called Bardawil in Arabic chronicles. The legend with all its elements (construction year 1105, with Hugh of St. Omer, who did indeed build Toron, as the man put in charge) was copied from one author to the next, including by noted medievalists Runciman and Prawer, until the archaeological survey done by Israeli archaeologists right after the Six-Day War, in 1968, and published in 1972, dated the site to the Bronze Age (Judea, Samaria and the Golan: Archaeological Survey 1967-1968, The Archaeological Survey of Israel and Carta, editor Moshe Kochavi).Sharon, Moshe. Corpus Inscriptionum Arabicarum Palaestinae (CIAP) Volume Two: B-C. BRILL, 1997, , p. 34, accessed 19 July 2019 Rejected identification with Qasr Bardawil Denys Pringle lists the Qasr Bardawil ruins under \\"Rejects\\" in his gazetteer of Crusader fortifications, due to lack of medieval material at the site. He quotes \\"Deschaps and others\\", referring by name to Paul Deschamps (French article) (1888-1974) who surveyed the area in the 1930s and identified the fortified spur with a Crusader castle mentioned in a Demascene chronicle, allegedly built by King Baldwin I. Deschamps argues that Qasr Bardawil was a Crusader castle, which dominated a village by the name of Al from a strategic position that controlled the Roman road from Baysan to Damascus and located some 12 km east of the Lake of Tiberias After the rejection of the identification based on more recent work at the site, the castle mentioned by Qalanisi is considered by Sinibaldi to be, as of 2014, still unidentified.

Marsh revealed the experiences of her captivity through her captive narrative,The Female Captive: A Narrative of Fact Which Happened in Barbary in the Year 1756, Written by Herself, published more than a decade after her return to England.The Female Captive documents Marsh's misfortunes after she and her shipmates were captured by Moroccan sailors, becoming the first captive barbary narrative written in English by a woman author. In the published version, Marsh also added quite a few details that helped reframe her narrative in a more novelistic form and that heightened the sense of danger she felt as well as created dramatic tension around the question of whether or not she would escape. Marsh's narrative is an important contributor to the larger genre of European women's captivity narratives, which frequently featured female resistance to captivity and sexual violence.  Captivity  Marsh moved to Gibraltar to board a ship on July 28, 1756, Marsh was meant to take this passage to join her fianc√© in England. After the Ann was ‚Äòunhappily deserted‚Äô by the Gosport, it was easily taken on August 8 by a Moroccan corsair of about 20 guns and 130 seamen, then carried to Sal√©. The captives were ‚Äúconducted‚Äù to Marrakech and Marsh started to hate the idea of being sexually harassed. Marsh had decided to disguise herself as the wife of a Mr. James Crisp, a merchant from London in her narrative of the story. But he is actually the ship's captain in the letters he sent out. After being presented to the Prince Sidi Mohammed, everything went down hill for Marsh. She was importuned to be the Prince's concubine, tricked into renouncing her Christianity and converting to Islam, and almost beat in submission. But after four months and resumed peace talks with Morocco, Marsh gained her coveted liberty and returned home. = Manipulation as a survival tactic of female slave captives = Marsh doesn't often show how she feels in her captive narrative, The Female Captive, about what is happening to her at the time she is being held captive. However, she does make sure to show the very little interest that she has in doing anything that the Prince Sidi Mohammed asks her to do; she continuously says she would prefer death to doing anything for him that has any forms of sexual favors being asked. Although, people judge her for using manipulation in her narrative, even if she did happen to use them for her own survival. Marsh uses the powerful dependent tactic, the constant victim tactic, and the multiple offender tactic to help her in surviving this captive life she is currently living. In The Female Captive it is said, \\"Despairing of cowing his hostage into submission, the Prince grudgingly granted her freedom and permission to leave the country, yet not before Britain formally agreed to resume peace talks with Morocco.\\" Upon looking into this statement, we see the powerful dependent tactic coming into play. Reading into the rest of the narrative, you are given more than enough examples of Marsh using manipulation for her own survival. Despite Marsh's position as an enslaved woman, she still holds power over her fellow white male captives, since whenever she desires an accommodation, she receives one. Marsh's narrative is marked by her ability to evade the humiliating conditions and hard labor the male captives endured and, rather, how she was treated with care, and leisurely made her way through her time spent as a captive. Marsh had a dichotomous, paradoxical enslavement, in that she was technically a captive, yet was not enslaved the way the men were. She was never given duties quite as harsh as the men, and could skew a situation in her favor by highlighting the fact that she's a woman. Marsh's complaints throughout the narrative can be read as reminders to those around her that she knew how she would be treated, thus implying that Marsh understood her placement in the hierarchy of power among captives and used it to her advantage. When she needed the passivity to work in her favor, she did so to remain innocent and chaste, and when she needed the agency to get what she wanted, she did so in defiance and entitlement. Contrary to the males, female captives seemed to find themselves given a chance to travel, self-reliance and assertiveness, and non-domestic work opportunities. The Female Captive: A Narrative of Facts which Happened in Barbary in the Year 1756, Written by Herself is a testament to how women in captivity narratives, particularly Elizabeth Marsh, uses their femininity and sexuality to their benefit in order to bypass situations and pad their position, and in doing so, provides an alternative lens on the traditional, male slave tales. = Concubinage = Slavery was a part of Arab culture before the Qur‚Äôan. It was a part of society that contributed to the financial stability and day-to-day lives of many people throughout the Arab world. While slavery was an accepted practice from the beginning, the idea of concubines was based more on individual interpretations of the Qur'an. Only slaves could become concubines, which opened the door to the practice of enslaving women from other cultures for that purpose. While popular culture spread the idea of the harem to the Western world, the practice was largely confined to the wealthy. The practicalities of taking care of a large number of women were too much for the everyday man of the time to even consider. The term harem referred not only to wives and concubines, but all other female members of the household, including children and domestic slaves. Screened from male view, the harem became a source of mystery and rumor for Europeans. This was enhanced due to the fact that male writers, many of whom purported to have knowledge of the harem, gave hugely exaggerated accounts. For example, Thomas Pellow, who was enslaved for 23 years in Morocco, claimed that the harem of Moulay Ismail had eight thousand wives living in it. While European narratives about harems were largely exaggerated accounts given by men who had no access to them, evidence exists that points to abuse, poisonings, and women being sold when they started aging or their appearance started to decline.  Life after captivity  Elizabeth Marsh faced scrutiny after returning to England after her captivity. She stated within the author's note of The Female Captive that ‚ÄúThough I have unhappily seldom experienced those Hours [of Ease and Tranquility], who may say, with too much Truth, that the Misfortunes I met with in Barbary have been more equalled by those I have since experienced, in this Land of Civil and Religious Liberty.\\" Upon her return, suspicion arose regarding the maintenance of her chastity while in captivity due to her many visits with the sultan. At the time, influential members of society believed that women could be easily persuaded by the exotic allure of the Orient, mainly due to the reaction to the publication of The Arabian Nights in the 18th century. This idea was widely held by the social elite, including English politician, writer, and philosopher Anthony Ashley Cooper, the third Earl of Shaftesbury. = Problems with publishing = Even though almost two-thirds of all slaves brought into the Islamic word were female, women captive narratives were scrutinized more than captive narratives written by men. The argument against the legitimacy of captive narratives by women was rooted in the presumably-inherent feminine weakness that was believed to prevent women from resisting the opulence of the Orient. Elizabeth Marsh faced this same criticism when she returned home, preventing her from publishing her narrative due to fear of the backlash it would cause. Even with her aforementioned display of strength when faced with Sultan Sidi Mohammad Ben Abdallah‚Äôs offer of concubinage, Elizabeth was accused of being a liar and giving up her virtue to him. = Post-traumatic stress disorder = Elizabeth Marsh displayed multiple parts of what defines symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. She exhibited symptoms of loneliness, emotional detachment from herself and those around her, and distrust. Along with these symptoms, the fact that she felt the need to narrate her story was a way for Marsh to digest what had happened to her and how to cope with it all, even if she was pressured into writing about it. Post-traumatic stress disorder is a key part of understanding why Marsh focused on writing what she wrote about. Some critics of these slave narratives claim that what she wrote was not, in fact, the truth. It was her truth and that, if it was manipulated, it was by the post-traumatic stress disorder that she was focusing on handling without even being aware it was happening to her brain. The awareness of mental disorders and disease is a new area of health that has only recently started to come to light in the past ten years. So, for a woman to branch out and write about her traumatic experiences was a mark of how brave she was and also how confused. = Impact of captivity = After her time in captivity, Elizabeth Marsh went on to marry James Crisp, the man that she pretended to be married to while a slave. By pretending to be married to Crisp Marsh had hoped that she would not be assaulted by the several other men that she was traveling with. She succeeded in this, however her validity for a real marriage was called into question after her was release. After insistence from her parents, Marsh married Crisp and went on to have two children with him. By creating this false narrative while in captivity, Marsh's life took a different turn than what was planned. Marsh's later life then took a turn when she decided to be away from her family for 18 months, choosing to be more independent in that time. It could be argued that Marsh did this as a result of her time in captivity and was making an attempt to live life that she lost.[1] Arguably the largest impact that Elizabeth Marsh's captivity had on herself was the production and publication of her narrative. Though it was originally published anonymously, word traveled that Marsh was the author. By publishing her experiences in captivity, Elizabeth Marsh's narrative became one of the most consumed female slavery narratives as well as one of the few to withstand time.
