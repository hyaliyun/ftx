Revising the party platform The platform which existed before the 11th Congress had remained unchanged since 7th Congress (held in 1991). The work on revising the platform began two-and-a-half years before the 11th Congress. Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫ Tr·ªçng, due to his position as rector of H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh National Academy of Politics, was asked by the 10th Politburo to head the drafting committee responsible for drafting the new platform. Another reason was that N√¥ng ƒê·ª©c M·∫°nh supported Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫ Tr·ªçng possible future candidature for the general secretaryship. The drafting of the platform was a collective effort guided by high-standing party bureaucrats and officials from think tanks. However, there was wide participation from the intelligentsia. There was some criticism on the end product ‚Äì a clause stated that all the means of production was to be owned by the state. When the draft version was presented to the 14th plenum of the 10th Central Committee, critics saw it as a step backward because since the 6th Congress, diversified ownership of the means of production had been recognized. Another point was that it alarmed external and internal investors. The 14th plenum eventually decided to include another clause which acknowledged the diversified ownership of the means of production. At the 11th National Congress, the issue was put to a vote, and 65.04 percent supported the motion of removing the clause which did not recognize the diversified ownership of the means of production. Even if it had stayed, it wouldn't have hurt the party. Another clause stated that Vietnam's goal was to \\"develop a market economy with socialist orientations, which would have many forms of ownership, many parts, many forms of businesses, and many ways of distribution in the economy.\\" Election References Bibliography * Category:National Congresses of the Communist Party of Vietnam Category:2011 in Vietnam ","title":"11th National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam"},{"id":"30522926","text":"Chaukati is a village in Barisal District in the Barisal Division of southern- central Bangladesh.Geographic Names, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, accessed 18 January 2011 References Category:Populated places in Barisal District ","title":"Chaukati"},{"id":"30522931","text":"Chaulahar is a village in Barisal District in the Barisal Division of southern-central Bangladesh.Geographic Names, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, accessed 18 January 2011 References Category:Populated places in Barisal District ","title":"Chaulahar"},{"id":"30522936","text":"Chaulakati is a village in Barisal District in the Barisal Division of southern-central Bangladesh.Geographic Names, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, accessed 18 January 2011 References Category:Populated places in Barisal District ","title":"Chaulakati"},{"id":"30522939","text":"Chengatia is a village in Barisal District in the Barisal Division of southern-central Bangladesh.Geographic Names, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, accessed 18 January 2011 References Category:Populated places in Barisal District ","title":"Chengatia"},{"id":"30522949","text":"Chhagaldi is a village in Barisal District in the Barisal Division of southern-central Bangladesh.Geographic Names, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, accessed 18 January 2011 References Category:Populated places in Barisal District ","title":"Chhagaldi"},{"id":"30522950","text":"Chhanbaria is a village in Barisal District in the Barisal Division of southern-central Bangladesh.Geographic Names, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, accessed 18 January 2011 References Category:Populated places in Barisal District ","title":"Chhanbaria"},{"id":"30522953","text":"Chhankhola is a village in Barisal District in the Barisal Division of southern-central Bangladesh.Geographic Names, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, accessed 18 January 2011 References Category:Populated places in Barisal District ","title":"Chhankhola"},{"id":"30522959","text":"Caz√®res-sur-Garonne is a railway station in Caz√®res, Occitanie, France.

Description and history  The Romanesque style, three-story building was built in 1909 by the Parker- Dunn Corporation, mainly to serve the 1889-organized Citizens State Bank (Charles N. Parker was vice president), but it was also home to a piano store and, in its basement, a barber shop. It was deemed significant \\"as a virtually unaltered example of the commercial block style from the turn-of- the-[20th]-century era\\". with Since 1984, it has housed E.L. Menk Jewelers, whose website has some interesting historical information about the building: ‚ÄúIn 1920, Con O‚ÄôBrien bought the building, apparently for 45,000.00. In 1924, the bank across the street to the south failed. One local story is that Con O‚ÄôBrien had a son that was the black sheep of the family who showed up at his dad‚Äôs office in the middle of the day and told his dad that he was fired from the Citizens bank. Con then canceled the banks lease and the bank moved across the street in 1927. In the early 1980s Jon Rappaport bought the building and land on a contract for deed. The upper two floors have been unoccupied since the winter of 1983 because the boiler system failed. Mr. Rappaport turned back the building in early 1988. At that time Ed and Susan Menk bought the building. Since then the main floor has been occupied by various businesses.‚Äù It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 23, 1980.

West attended the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, from which she obtained a bachelor of arts degree in industrial psychology. She became an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant (IBCLC) in 2002 and opened her private lactation consultation practice later the same year. She has published five books about breastfeeding. She lives in the Long Valley section of Washington Township, Morris County, New Jersey with her three sons.Program, 17th Annual Professional Lactation Conference, Vermont Lactation Consultant Association, April 15‚Äì16, 2010. Work in the lactation field West became involved in breastfeeding advocacy after her experiences trying to breastfeed her three children following breast reduction surgery. West is an accredited La Leche League LeaderLa Leche League International and has worked for La Leche League International as their Director of Media Relations since 2011. She was a member of the review board of the United States Lactation Consultant Association (USLCA)United States Lactation Consultant Association (USLCA) professional journal Clinical Lactationfrom May 2014 until October 2016. She was a member of the board of directors of the International Lactation Consultant Association (ILCA)International Lactation Consultant Association (ILCA) from July 2008 until the end of 2009, working as Director of Professional Development. She has been on the board of the Monetary Investment for Lactation Consultant Certification (MILCC) and has been a speaker at professional and parenting conferences. Diana West has a private lactation consultation practice, and is a clinical lactation forms developer, a website developer, and administrator of the Breastfeeding After Breast and Nipple Surgeries,Breastfeeding After Breast and Nipple Surgeries and Low Milk Supply,Low Milk Supply websites. Published works In her 2001 book, Defining Your Own Success: Breastfeeding After Breast Reduction Surgery, West discusses the effects of breast reduction surgery on breastfeeding and provides practical advice to women in that situation. The Journal of Human Lactation described this book as \\"an excellent resource for healthcare professionals, in particular lactation consultants.\\" Ms. West led a team of international lactation professionals in developing The Clinician's Breastfeeding Triage Tool for the International Lactation Consultant Association in 2007, which was revised in 2008 and 2014. This health care tool provided evidence-based information for first-line treatment of lactation dysfunction and pathologies. In her 2008 monograph with Dr. Elliot Hirsch, Clinics in Human Lactation: Breastfeeding After Breast and Nipple Procedures, West and Hirsch examined the effects of breast and nipple procedures on lactation for medical professionals. In her 2008 book with Lisa Marasco about low milk production, The Breastfeeding Mother's Guide to Making More Milk, West and Marasco presented methods to identify the causes of low milk production and targeted strategies to increase them, including more effective milk removal, addressing hormonal dysfunction, and the use of galactagogues (herbs to increase lactation), such as goat's rue and shatavari. In her 2010 book with Diane Wiessinger and Teresa Pitman for La Leche League International, The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding, 8th edition, Wiessinger, West, and Pitman re-wrote La Leche League International's landmark book about breastfeeding for the new millennial generation. In her 2014 book with Diane Wiessinger, Linda J. Smith, and Teresa Pitman for La Leche League International, Sweet Sleep: Nighttime and Naptime Strategies for the Breastfeeding Family, Wiessinger, West, Smith, and Pitman examined the risks and safety of bedsharing for breastfeeding mothers as a strategy to improve breastfeeding outcomes, and provided strategies to make bedsharing safer and easier.  LGBTQ lactation research  In 2014, West was instrumental in revising La Leche League's leadership eligibility criteria to allow leaders to serve no matter their gender, following their initial rejection of Trevor MacDonald, a transgender father. West commented, ‚ÄúIt was thought that only women could breastfeed. Once it became clear it wasn‚Äôt as straightforward as that, the policy had to change. We‚Äôre just trying to be on the right side of history. Yes, we took a year to do it, but we did it in a way that was fair and unequivocal.‚Äù West went on to be part of a research team with MacDonald through the University of Ottawa that conducted qualitative research about transmasculine individuals' experiences of pregnancy, birthing, and feeding their newborns. The group's research paper, \\"Transmasculine individuals‚Äô experiences with lactation, chestfeeding, and gender identity: a qualitative study,\\" contains the first known use of the word \\"chestfeeding\\" in the title of an academic paper, which is a term preferred by some transmasculine individuals to describe their lactation and nursing relationship. The paper is in the top 1% of the most-viewed academic research papers of all time.

In the 1900s, he had played Minor Counties cricket for Hertfordshire. He was born at Highbury, London and died at Upton Hellions, Crediton, Devon. Educated at the Merchant Taylors' School, Vasey became a schoolmaster at King's School, Bruton. Unusually to modern eyes, he was a successful member of the school hockey and cricket teams and a reproduction in 2008 of the 1908 edition of The Dolphin, the King's Bruton school magazine, shows a fair-haired mustachioed man as a member of both the unbeaten football team and as a gown-wearing teacher in the school photograph. Vasey returned to King's Bruton as a master after the First World War and was a housemaster. As a cricketer, Vasey was a right-handed middle-order batsman and a right-arm slow bowler, though he did not bowl in either Minor Counties or first-class cricket. He played twice for Hertfordshire in 1906, making 31 in the innings victory over Oxfordshire. In minor cricket in 1911, he scored 282 for the Old Brutonians team against Sidmouth, sharing a second wicket partnership of 396 with Harold Hippisley, who made 150. His one first-class match came in 1913, and he made 10 and 3 in the match against Yorkshire at Bath, in which Hippisley also played. As late as 1931 he was playing for Old Brutonians in club matches. Vasey served in the First World War with the Dorset Regiment; he was transferred from active service to the Ministry of National Service in 1917 with the rank of Captain.

He suffered a mental breakdown, drank heavily, was admitted to mental hospital, could not find a new job despite over 100 applications and at age 52 was unlikely to have a promising future career. He claimed that he was unfairly dismissed, and that the manner of his dismissal, which was summarily without the chance of a fair hearing and with one month's pay in lieu only, caused his health problems. He sought compensation for unfair dismissal, and in addition for the manner of dismissal given the employer's breach of mutual trust and confidence. Judgment The House of Lords held that while Mr Johnson had been dismissed unfairly there could be no compensation for the manner of Mr Johnson's dismissal if that would exceed the statutory scheme laid out in the Employment Rights Act 1996 and the accompanying limits on compensation that could be sought through the system of employment tribunals. While a common law right to full compensation for breach of contract might exist, it could not circumvent the intention of Parliament in laying down limits to compensation for dismissals. Lord Nicholls said the following. Lord Steyn, dissenting, argued the statutory remedies in salary for wrongful dismissal inadequate, and the statutory term of notice did not prevent developing an implied term of good faith and fair dealing. There was no conflict between the requirement of notice and not to exercise the power in a harsh, humiliating manner. In the course of his judgment Lord Hoffmann made some important remarks on the contract of employment.[2001] UKHL 13, [35] See also *UK labour law Notes References *E McGaughey, A Casebook on Labour Law (Hart 2019) ch 3, 96 External links * Category:English contract case law Category:2001 in case law Category:2001 in British law Category:House of Lords cases Category:Unisys Category:United Kingdom labour case law Category:United Kingdom employment contract case law ","title":"Johnson v Unisys Ltd"},{"id":"30523337","text":"is a 1986 Japanese drama film directed by Masahiro Shinoda.

Some expressions of the bourbon and rye are bottled in bond. An old bottle of Old Taylor bottled in bond History Old Taylor Bourbon was named in honor of Edmund Haynes Taylor, Jr., who was born in Columbus, Kentucky, in 1832. Taylor was a grand nephew of U.S. President Zachary Taylor. Like various other figures in the Kentucky whiskey industry, Taylor is often referred to in public relations materials as a \\"Colonel\\", since he held the honorary title of Kentucky Colonel. The honorary title resembles that of the military rank but is not actually associated with military service and has primarily been used for public relations purposes (e.g., by \\"Colonel\\" Harland Sanders, the founder of Kentucky Fried Chicken). Taylor started and owned seven different distilleries throughout his career, the most successful being the O.F.C. and Carlisle distilleries, the forerunners of today's Buffalo Trace Distillery. E. H. Taylor is said to have lobbied in favor of the Bottled-in- Bond Act, a law that gave participating whiskey producers a tax break and a government certification of product quality. He was a contemporary of and acquaintance with various other notable whiskey business figures as Dr. James C. Crow, Oscar Pepper, Judge William B. McBrayer, John H. McBrayer and W. F.

Some expressions of the current brand continue to be offered as bottled-in-bond versions. Unlike most distilleries of the time that looked like little more than a sawmill sitting in a thicket, Taylor's distillery on Glenn's Creek, near Frankfort, was designed to resemble a medieval castle with the landscaped grounds of an estate. The distillery attracted tourists and picnickers who were given complimentary \\"tenth pint\\" bottles of Old Taylor. In the late 1940s, Old Taylor bourbon was promoted with the slogan, \\"Sign of a good host\\".1947 advertisement for Old Taylor Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey By 1972, the historic \\"castle\\" distillery structure had been abandoned, and it remained abandoned but still standing in deteriorating condition for more than 40 years.

(c. 1726 ‚Äì 1791), was an eccentric Dissenting Minister, and has been accused of being controversial and belligerent.James Cocks; Memorials of Hatherlow and of the old Chadkick Chapel; Stockport, 1895.  Early life  Born about 1726, Robinson was educated at the dissenting academy at Plasterers' Hall, Addle Street, London. His tutors here were Zephaniah Marryat, D. D. (c. 1684 ‚Äì 1754), theological tutor, \\"considered to be the best Greek scholar among the Dissenters\\"; and John Walker, LL. D., Classical and Hebrew tutor, who was \\"celebrated for his profound knowledge of the oriental languages\\".Irene Parker; Dissenting Academies in England, their rise and progress; Cambridge, University press, 1914. Plasterers' Hall was unashamedly Independent or Congregationalist and it evolved into Independent College, Homerton. It was the academy Joseph Priestley's Calvinistic relatives would have sent him, had he not, \\"being at that time an Arminian, ... resolutely opposed it, especially upon finding that if [he] went thither, besides giving a [conversion] experience, [he] must subscribe [his] assent to ten printed articles of the strictest Calvinist faith, and repeat it every six months\\".Memoirs of Joseph Priestley, written by himself to the year 1795, with a continuation to the time of his decease by his son, Joseph Priestley; London; 1809. Marryat and Walker were devoted to Calvinism, and it was they who determined this rule that all students should biannually subscribe to the Calvinistic creed of ten articles.  Career as a minister  Robinson abandoned Calvinism while at the academy, though for the time he maintained his Trinitarianism. His first pastorate appears to have been at Congleton, Cheshire, in 1748, where he succeeded Joseph Bourn (1713‚Äì?1765), who had moved on to Hindley in Lancashire. The Congleton congregation already had Socinian or Unitarian leanings; Robinson's successors, William Turner and Benjamin Dawson, were certainly of that persuasion.Robert Head, Congleton past and present, a history of this old Cheshire town; Congleton, Head, 1887. While at Congleton, and in response to the final thwarting of the Jacobite cause, Robinson preached and published a sermon: The Mischievous intentions of popish projectors frustrated.The Mischievous intentions of popish projectors frustrated; a just reason for gratitude and exultation; a sermon preached on ... Nov. 5. 1749; to a society of protestant dissenters, at Congleton, in Cheshire, by Robert Robinson; Manchester, printed by R. Whitworth, [1749].Robert Head, 1887. After four years at Congleton, Robinson moved to the Old Chapel, Dukinfield, Cheshire. He read his inaugural sermon on 12 November 1752. If his removal had been the result of a rift with his Congleton congregation, no record of it has yet come to light. However, he was clearly subject to outbreaks of bad temper while at Dukinfield. His instructions to the town constable to whip a begging tramp, was one factor among many behind a growing rift with his congregation.Alexander Gordon, 1841‚Äì1931; Historical account of Dukinfield chapel and its school; Manchester & London, printed by Cartwright and Rattray Ltd.; 1896. He left at the end of 1755. Robinson now began a nineteen-year pastorate at Dob Lane Unitarian Chapel, Failsworth, near Manchester.William Urwick, (ed.); Historical sketches of nonconformity in the County Palatine of Chester, by various ministers and laymen in the county; London , Kent, 1864.Alexander Gordon, 1896. Two sermons that Robinson preached, and afterwards printed, on the artificial rise in the price of corn gained him the ill-will of interested speculators;The great sin and danger of oppression: Two Sermons, Preached During the late high Prices of Corn, to a Society of Protestant Dissenters, at Dob-Lane End, near Manchester, by R. Robinson; with a Preface endeavouring to obviate some Reflections cast upon the Author for preaching the said Sermons; Manchester, printed by R. Whitworth, Bookseller and Bookbinder, next the Weaver's Arms, at the Back of the Bull's Head, [1757].> but his Dob Lane congregation found fault with the consistency of his Unitarianism as well as with his politics, and his congregation and hence his income soon fell away. As a result, he accepted some editorial work for a local bookseller, Robert Whitworth. Whitworth projected an edition of the Bible, to be sold in serial form. This would be more successful if Robinson could put some academic initials after his name on the title page. Consequently, Robinson persuade some acquaintances to sponsor an application to Edinburgh University, who appearing to mistake him for the more meritorious and academically distinguished Robert Robinson of CambridgeAlexander Gordon, 1896; James Cocks, 1895; William Urwick, 1864. awarded him a Doctorate in Divinity in January 1774. Finally exasperated with their belligerent preacher, on 14 December 1774 Robinson was handed a thirty- six-signature petition, signed by \\"eighteen subscribers and eighteen ciphers\\", demanding his resignation. Robinson's response was to point out that he had been in post some twenty years, and would remain till \\"August 1st, 1782, and as much longer as I then see cause\\";The doctrine of absolute submission discussed, or, the natural right claimed by some dissenters to dismiss their ministers at pleasure exposed, as a practice produced by principles of unrestrained liberty, tho' contrary to the dictates of reason and revelation, by R. Robinson, D.D.; London, printed for the author, and sold by E. and C. Dilly, Booksellers, in the Poultry, 1775. and he published a pamphlet, The doctrine of absolute submission discussed, or, the natural right claimed by some dissenters to dismiss their ministers at pleasure exposed. He had to get this printed in London, because Whitworth, his local publisher, not wishing to become involved in a local dispute, refused to print it. At the back of this pamphlet, and clearly to antagonize his Unitarian congregation, Robinson advertised a further publication: A Discourse in Vindication of the true and proper Divinity of our Lord, &c.;, with appendices. If it was ever written, it seems never to have been published.  Retirement  Fruitless efforts followed, to force his ejection, and then to buy him out; but Robinson held the trust-deeds, locked the doors of the chapel and graveyard, and for three years preached but one sermon, that a Fast-day sermon against the politics of dissent. For three years, burials were made in the parish church-yard or in private grounds. Robinson finally resigned in 1777. He applied for ordination into the Church of England, but was sensibly refused. So, he retired to an estate he purchased, Barrack Hill House at Bredbury, near Stockport. Robinson died at his son's house in Manchester on 7 December 1791, and was buried 15 December, by his own directions, at seven in the morning, in a square red- brick building erected on his property. A movable glass pane was inserted in his coffin, and the mausoleum had a door for purposes of inspection by a watchman, who was to see if he breathed on the glass. It seems he had a horror of premature burial, and so he instructed his relatives to visit his grave periodically to check that he was still dead.James Cocks, 1895.

There's always a trade-off between time resolution and frequency resolution in traditional short-time Fourier transform (STFT). A long window leads to high frequency resolution and low time resolution. On the other hand, high time resolution requires shorter window, with the expense of low frequency resolution. By choosing the proper elementary function for signal with different spectrum structure, adaptive Gabor representation is able to accommodate both narrowband and wideband signal. Gabor expansion In 1946, Dennis Gabor suggested that a signal can be represented in two dimensions, with time and frequency coordinates. And the signal can be expanded into a discrete set of Gaussian elementary signals. =Definition= The Gabor expansion of signal s(t) is defined by this formula: : s(t)=\\\\sum_{m=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty C_{m,n}h(t-mT)e^{jnt\\\\Omega} where h(t) is the Gaussian elementary function: : h(t)=\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\pi} \\\\right)^\\\\frac{1}{4}e^{\\\\left( -\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{2}t^2 \\\\right)} Once the Gabor elementary function is determined, the Gabor coefficients C_{m,n}can be obtained by the inner product of s(t) and a dual function \\\\gamma(t) :C_{m,n}=\\\\int s(t)\\\\gamma^*(t-mT)e^{-jnt\\\\Omega} \\\\, dt. T and \\\\Omega denote the sampling steps of time and frequency and satisfy the criteria :T\\\\Omega\\\\leqq2\\\\pi \\\\, Relationship between Gabor representation and Gabor transform Gabor transform simply computes the Gabor coefficients C_{m,n} for the signal s(t). Adaptive expansion Adaptive signal expansion is defined as :s\\\\left( t \\\\right)=\\\\sum_p B_p h_p(t) where the coefficients B_p are obtained by the inner product of the signal s(t) and the elementary function h_p : B_p =\\\\left \\\\langle s,h_p\\\\right \\\\rangle \\\\, Coeffients B_p represent the similarity between the signal and elementary function. Adaptive signal decomposition is an iterative operation, aim to find a set of elementary function \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ h_p(t) \\\\right\\\\\\\\} , which is most similar to the signal's time-frequency structure. First, start with w=0 and s_0\\\\left( t \\\\right)=s\\\\left( t \\\\right). Then find h_0\\\\left( t \\\\right) which has the maximum inner product with signal s_0\\\\left( t \\\\right) and : \\\\left B_p \\\\right^2 = \\\\max_h \\\\left \\\\left \\\\langle s_p (t),h_p(t) \\\\right \\\\rangle \\\\right^2 Second, compute the residual: : s_1\\\\left(t\\\\right) =s_0\\\\left(t\\\\right)-B_0 h_0\\\\left(t\\\\right), and so on. It will comes out a set of residual (s_p\\\\left(t\\\\right)), projection (B_p=\\\\left \\\\langle s_p(t),h_p(t) \\\\right \\\\rangle), and elementary function (h_p\\\\left(t\\\\right)) for each different p. The energy of the residual will vanish if we keep doing the decomposition. = Energy conservation equation = If the elementary equation (h_p\\\\left(t\\\\right)) is designed to have a unit energy. Then the energy contain in the residual at the pth stage can be determined by the residual at p+1th stage plus (B_p). That is, :\\\\left \\\\ s_p(t) \\\\right \\\\^2=\\\\left \\\\ s_{p+1}(t) \\\\right \\\\^2 + \\\\left B_p \\\\right^2, :\\\\left \\\\ s(t) \\\\right \\\\^2=\\\\sum_{p=o}^\\\\infty \\\\left B_p \\\\right^2, similar to the Parseval's theorem in Fourier analysis. The selection of elementary function is the main task in adaptive signal decomposition. It is natural to choose a Gaussian-type function to achieve the lower bound for the inequality: : h_p(t)=\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\pi} \\\\right)^\\\\frac{1}{4}e^{ -\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{2}(t-T_p)^2}e^{jt\\\\Omega_p}, where \\\\left(T_p,\\\\Omega_p\\\\right) is th mean and \\\\alpha_p^{-1} is the variance of Gaussian at \\\\left(T_p,\\\\Omega_p\\\\right). And : s\\\\left( t \\\\right) = \\\\sum_p B_p h_p(t) = \\\\sum_p B_p\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\pi} \\\\right)^\\\\frac{1}{4} e^{-\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{2}(t-T_p)^2 }e^{jt\\\\Omega_p} is called the adaptive Gabor representation. Changing the variance value will change the duration of the elementary function (window size), and the center of the elementary function is no longer fixed. By adjusting the center point and variance of the elementary function, we are able to match the signal's local time-frequency feature. The better performance of the adaptation is achieved at the cost of matching process. The trade-off between different window length now become the trade-off between computation time and performance.

It was opened in several sections between 1862 and 1872 by the Magdeburg‚ÄìHalberstadt Railway Company (Magdeburg-Halberst√§dter Eisenbahngesellschaft, MHE) and is now maintained by DB Netz except for the disused section between Heudeber-Danstedt and Vienenburg. Since 1996, traffic between Heudeber-Danstedt and Vienenburg has used the railway via Wernigerode running further to the south. Between Halle Hauptbahnhof and Halle-Trotha, a single-track electrified line of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland runs parallel to the Halle‚ÄìHalberstadt railway, but there is no connection between the lines in Halle-Trotha.  History  Vienenburg station As early as 1841 and 1843 respectively, Vienenburg and Halberstadt were connected to the railway network. Likewise, in 1843 the line from Oschersleben via Jerxheim to Wolfenb√ºttel was taken into service, as a result of which one could travel by rail between Vienenburg and Halberstadt, albeit on a route running a long way to the north. Nevertheless, there were further plans for a railway close to the Harz Mountains, that would run westwards from Halberstadt. The first section, from Halberstadt to Wegeleben, was opened in 1862 along with the Halberstadt‚ÄìThale railway. Only three years later the Wegeleben-Aschersleben section went into service. In 1864 a state treaty between Prussia and the Brunswick was agreed that envisaged a railway line from Halberstadt to Vienenburg. A reasonably level route was chosen, at some distance from the Harz, running via Heudeber-Danstedt and Wasserleben. The Kingdom of Hanover, on whose territory Vienenburg was located, initially rejected this scheme however. Not until Prussia's victory in the Austro-Prussian War and the resulting annexation of Hanover could the Magdeburg-Halberstadt Railway Company (MHE) begin work on its construction in 1867. On 1 March 1869 the line was taken into service. Two years beforehand the MHE had opened the eastern extension of the railway towards Halle (Saale). In 1871, this line was extended to the neighbouring village of K√∂nnern, and, in 1872, the last section to Halle (Saale) was completed. In 1875, the line from Vienenburg to Hildesheim, in the shape of the Vienenburg‚ÄìLangelsheim railway, also opened and, with that, the direct line from Halle to Hanover was complete. Long- distance passenger services were moved after the nationalisation of the MHE to the more northerly lines of the Prussian state railways, but the line retained significance for long-distance freight traffic. During World War II, traffic increased further as the route was an important part of the connection between the Ruhr and central Germany. The line suffered almost no damage during the Second World War but, as a result of the division of Germany, it was cut in 1945 between Vienenburg on the West German side and Wasserleben on the East German side, and later dismantled. After the Wende there were attempts to reactivate the link between Halberstadt and Vienenburg. But because the line missed out larger towns like Wernigerode and Ilsenburg, the decision went in favour of the southern route, the Heudeber-Danstedt‚ÄìIlsenburg railway. Until 1945 this had also crossed the state border, to Bad Harzburg. Because the trackbed of the old line was no longer usable in the area of Bad Harzburg, the Deutsche Bahn decided to build the new line, which branches off the old one at Stapelburg and runs northwards to the Halberstadt‚ÄìVienenburg route. Just before the state border it rejoins the old route and follows it to Vienenburg. Because the line uses the old trackbed on Lower Saxon soil, the project could be viewed locally as a renovation of an existing line, which enabled the installation of level crossings. On 2 June 1996 the new section, approximately 10 kilometres long, was opened. Since then passenger trains between Halberstadt and Vienenburg have used the Halberstadt‚ÄìHeudeber-Danstedt section of the old line and the three kilometre long section on Lower Saxony territory, but otherwise they run along the southern route via Ilsenburg and Wernigerode. Passenger trains were still using the section of line between Heudeber-Danstedt and Wasserleben until 28 September 2002, continuing along the track of the former Osterwieck-Wasserleben Railway to Osterwieck. Thereafter services were withdrawn and, by 30 June 2003, the line was closed by the Federal Railway Office. At the end of the 1990s the Halle‚ÄìHalberstadt section was completely converted in order to enable it to handle tilting trains with a top speed of 160 km/h. The entire control and safety equipment was modernised (including the installation of an electronic signal box at Sandersleben), the track layouts of many stations were reduced to the minimum necessary. Several stations were abandoned completely. The line from Halberstadt via Wernigerode to Vienenburg was converted in 2007 to take trains using tilting technology. In the new 2008 timetable, journey times shortened again due to the completion of renovation work.Nordharzstrecke for the Neigetechnikverkehr freigegeben Rail services The Deutsche Bahn's Regional Express trains (HarzExpress) work the line every two hours between Halle, Halberstadt and Hanover, stopping at all stations, as do local services on the North Harz Network (Nordharznetz) operated by Veolia Verkehr Sachsen-Anhalt. At weekends Veolia runs an excursion service between Berlin and Wernigerode that uses the Halberstadt‚ÄìHeudeber-Danstedt section. The stations between Halle (Saale) Hauptbahnhof and Halle-Trotha are on a separate track operated as part of line S7 of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland.

The massacre occurred shortly after the start of the second Turkish invasion, concurring with other massacres.  Background  According to the 1960 census, the inhabitants of the three villages were entirely Turkish Cypriots.Map of Cyprus The total population of Maratha and Santalaris was 207.ŒöŒ•Œ†Œ°ŒüŒ£ - CYPRUS (612 villages, 9251,47 Km¬≤) By 1973, the total population of the villages had risen to 270, with 124 in Maratha, 100 in Santalaris and 46 in Aloda. However, in July 1974, following the first Turkish invasion of Cyprus, all men of fighting age were taken away as prisoners of war to internment camps in Famagusta and from there transferred to Limassol.  Massacre  On 20 July 1974, the men of the villages were arrested by EOKA-B and sent to Limassol. Following this, according to testimonials cited by Sevg√ºl Uludaƒü, EOKA-B men from the neighboring village of Peristeronopigi came, got drunk in the camp they established in the village coffeehouse, fired shots in the air, and subsequently raped many women and young girls. The rape later included the boys and this continued till 14 August 1974. Upon the launch of the second invasion of the Turkish Army, they decided not to leave behind any witnesses and killed the entire population of the villages present at the time. In Maratha and Santalaris, 84-89 were killed. The imam of Maratha stated that there were 90 people in the village prior to the massacre, and only six people were left. Elderly people and children were also killed during the massacre. Only three people were able to escape from the massacre in Aloda. The inhabitants of the three villages were buried in mass graves with a bulldozer. The villagers of Maratha and Santalaris were buried in the same grave. Associated Press described the corpses as \\"so battered and decomposed that they crumbled to pieces when soldiers lifted them from the garbage with shovels\\".https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&dat;=19740903&id;=r2AdAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=VlsEAAAAIBAJ&pg;=3020,430189 Milliyet reported that parts of the bodies had been chopped off and sharp tools, as well as machine guns had been used in the massacre.\\"ƒ∞kinci Katliam\\", Milliyet, 2 September 1974, p. 10. According to Greek Cypriot writer and researcher Tony Angastiniotis, at least one of the attackers used a mainland Greek accent, which suggested that he was a Greek officer.Asmussen, Jan. Cyprus at war: diplomacy and conflict during the 1974 crisis (2008), I.B.

Eventually, it was established, and expelled, from Australia, PNG, Solomon Islands, but continues to exist in some form in the island Bougainville under the rule of Musingku as King David Peii II. Description U-Vistract is considered by many to be a Ponzi scheme. The founders have stated that the plan has always been to back the assets of the plan with the in-ground natural resources, including copper, silver, gold, zinc and other products. Formation of U-Vistract In 1997, seven years after the unilateral declaration of independence, the Bougainville Revolutionary Army was fully in control of the island, but its leadership was starting to split into different factions. Francis Ona continued in full control of the army, and intended to achieve full independence. His co- president in the Bougainville Interim Government, Joseph Kabui, was seeking rapprochement with PNG and formation of an Autonomous Bougainville Government, while the army General Sam Kauona had his own path. Musingku met with each of them as a mediator, and by 19 December had signed agreements with each. They realized that it would be impossible to join the three parties together without a source of funding, and that it would be impossible to achieve political independence without financial sovereignty. Papala Chronicles Issue 7 p. 10 As Musingku‚Äôs wrote, :‚Äô'In other words, Bougainville needed to create her own independent and sovereign system in order to be free from the control of the other international financial and governing structure. Also, it was very clear that the funds we needed to work with in uprooting, pulling down, destroying and overthrowing the existing foreign control system could not be earned through the conventional system. A new international system needed to be established whose control and coordination would not be based overseas but right here on our own soil.'‚Äô Thus began the creation of the U-Vistract System. At first, the \\"U-Vistract Mission\\" was established as a Christian mission program in Australia. After Musingku was arrested and publicly denigrated Papala Chronicles Issue 15 p. 9 by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) for an unlicensed securities and investment program, churches continued to invest. > \\"On October 19th 1999 in one of my trips to Australia the ASIC placed me > under house-arrest‚Ä¶.After a heavy interrogatory session they demanded me to > shut down all my operations in the country. The ASIC publicized the matter > in the media to let the world of Australia know about the so-called illegal > operations. However, U-Vistract grew even stronger, gaining momentum almost > overnight. The number of my agencies grew in Kempsey, Sydney, Brisbane, Gold > coast, etc.\\" From Australia, Musingku took his U-Vistract program to Pt Moresby, Papua New Guinea. While in Pt Moresby, he attempted to set up a bank in the old Hawaiian Bank building, but he was shut down by the PNG government and forced to leave to the Solomon Islands. He began again to set up his system, but the Australian police in the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) forced him out. In 2003 he travelled to Ona‚Äôs headquarters in Guava, Panguna, Bougainville, and established a bank there. Two years later he was able to travel to his ancestral village of Tonu, where he established his bank headquarters in an old cattle farm owned by the paramount chief. This, he said, was the manger from which would issue salvation of the world. Papala Chronicles Issue 14 p. 9 :Throughout the process we were on the lookout for an ideal government that would allow us to fit our system into it without unnecessary restrictions, terms or conditions. Our search around the world could not locate any such government. :The answer was right here on Bougainville. However, it could not be the Autonomous government as she was already defiled with a foreign partner. Meekamui was clearly the only one that fitted our descriptions and expectations. Papala Chronicles Issue 2 :All other governments including Australia, PNG, Solomon Islands, etc, could not fit into this description as they already had other software programs > Musingku refers to nations as hardware, and their forms of government as software fitted into them. Australia repelled us in 2000. PNG pushed us out in 1999 and again in 2002. Papala Chronicles Issue 8 p. 9 Expansion :The PNG government under advice from its foreign controllers such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund had tried everything possible to block our way forward, Papala Chronicles Issue 3 :Others merely saw us as nobodies, pyramid schemes, conmen, and cargo/religious cults, etc. They did not realize that we were busy growing and extending our branches around the world, establishing a new international system of governance, monetary and banking. U-V was established in several countries besides Bougainville. In 2002, it was already in 4 nations, including PNG. Its branches were considered to be branches of a government, with governors of different districts and regions in foreign nations. Along with a system of banks, branches and governorships in several countries, U-Vistract established an \\"alternate UN\\" called ‚Äò‚Äô'Royal Assembly of Nations and Kingdoms'‚Äô‚Äô. Emissaries were sent from U-Vistract and RAONK to several nations, including Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Solomon Islands, the UK and Netherlands. Implementation and operation Initially, deposits were made in several currencies into bank accounts. Later, accounts were offered in ordinary and several high-yield investment categories. In 2005 in Bougainville, the U-Vistract system began using bank cards to allow members to purchase goods in \\"U-Vistract‚Äôs Royal International Trade and Commerce System\\". Merchants were promised reimbursement for member purchases. : \\"Based on your bulging balances and bank statements, we will arrange with them a similar transaction program. If you want a car, truck or similar we will make similar arrangements with those who are registered with our system overseas and import your vehicles for you. Once you have decided on your choice we will arrange with suppliers and import them for you\\", the King said. Similar arrangements can be done for clients wanting housing and building supplies who will pick from different housing designs and once they have made their choice, the U-Vistract system will import these items for them direct from suppliers and warehouses and credit their accounts from the clients' accounts with the RIBM. Papala Chronicles Issue 9 p. 2 Involvement :U-Vistract was a financial lending pyramid scheme into which approximately 60,000 Bougainvilleans invested. McKenzie, Stan, World Socialist Website, ‚Äò'Papua New Guinea fast money schemes: a financial house of cards collapses'‚Äô, accessed 16 June 2009 :Within a few years, some 70,000 Papua New Guineans had deposited K350 million into U-Vistract alone. U-Vistract also attracted followers in Australia, Solomon Islands and Fiji. In Australia, a small number of Queensland investors contributed some AUD500,000 between July and October 1999‚Ä¶ This drew the attention of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), which stopped the further spread of the scheme and required U-Vistract to return the money to its investors (ASIC, 1999). (Australian Securities and Investments Commission 1999) :Initially, U-Vistract had support from the PNG Government, led by Prime Minister Bill Skate. Skate‚Äôs Treasurer, Iairo Lasaro, exempted U-Vistract and nine other fast money schemes from the requirements of the Financial Institutions Act. Skate and his Deputy are said to have been large investors in U-Vistract and Money Rain. Many Papua New Guineans believe it was their extravagant investments (of public money) that exhausted the schemes' capacity to pay‚Ä¶.;; :Musingku defied court orders and continued to operate. He was declared bankrupt (Post- Courier, 15 June 2000) and subsequently charged with contempt of court for continuing to solicit deposits. Musingku attempted to set up another money scheme, the \\"Royal Reserve Bank of Papala\\", but police and BPNG officials raided the new pseudo- bank and closed it down. In 2002, Musingku fled to Bougainville and thence to Solomon Islands. One U-Vistract official said that \\"only born-again Christians would be paid\\" since only they could handle wealth morally. (Post-Courier, 31 May 2001) Present status In 2010, the International Bank of Me‚Äôekamui, www.ibom.biz one of Musingku‚Äôs bank group, established relations with a group of companies and individuals engaged in commerce outside of the usual financial system.www.financialhope.info This group has provided billions of dollars in capital to U-Vistract through IBOM, and provided the means for capitalization of the in-ground assets that Bougainville contains, while IBOM has provided access to the international banking system. A new, gold backed currency is pending issuance. It will be a gold-backed \\"Kina\\" (not PNG Kina) worth 1 gm of gold. Currently, the exchange is the UVD at 10 USD to 1 UVD, Papala Chronicles Issue 4 now at 1 mg gold. This issue will include bills with the likenesses of Muskingku/King David, as well as Jesus Christ. Most Bougainvillians believed that Noah Muskingku is a Self-Proclaimed King who hides from the Legitimate Government Authority as he had deceived the ordinary people of PNG and other nations to invest in his failed financial scheme. His lust to form his own Government has no foundation as he only depends on the current government to provide goods and service to his people.

The events detailed below immediately follow those of the novel The Risen Empire. Plot summary Imperial Captain Laurent Zai is sent on a suicide mission to defeat an incursion by the Rix, a space-faring nation who worship planet-sized artificial intelligences (AIs).http://us.macmillan.com/thekillingofworlds The planet he is protecting from the Rix is home to a newly emergent AI named Alexander, which the local population is helpless to remove. Although severely outclassed, and in spite of deadly mutineers, Captain Zai is successful in destroying his Rix opponent; he also discovers that the Rix ship was shielding and transporting a vast swarm of silicon particles. Alexander uses the help of a surviving Rix commando and her Imperial lover to project his consciousness into space, inhabiting the silicon particles as an independent entity. Although political guardians on Captain Zai's ship try to prevent it, he makes peaceful contact with both Alexander and with the Rix commando. From them, he learns the greatest secret of his Emperor; the Emperor's claim that he can revive people from death and give them an eternal post-life is false. In fact, the Emperor's 'symbiont' technology gives a semblance of life after death, but not the eternal life that is promised. Laurent Zai's empathic lover is Senator Nara Oxham, a woman who is elevated to the Emperor's war cabinet. She discovers that the Emperor has assigned Zai a suicidal mission, and that the Emperor intends to destroy the AI by destroying the planet which Laurent Zai is protecting. Another member of the war cabinet, a member of the plague axis, warns her that the paranoia of the Empire is leading them all into genetic inviability. When the Nara warns Zai of his danger, she is arrested for treason. Immediately before her trial, Laurent shares the Emperor's secret, and she exposes his story to the entire population.

It premiered in London in the same year with four matinee performances at the Royal Court followed by a run of 133 performances at the Vaudeville Theatre. The production was directed by Norman McKinnel who also took the role of Rutherford. The same production opened at the Little Theater, New York on Christmas Eve, 1912 and ran for 63 performances. The Times theatre critic, Arthur Bingham Walkley, called it \\"a play not easily forgotten, and full of promise for the future as well as of merit in itself\\", while the Saturday Review thought it showed \\"what can be done in the modern theatre by keeping strictly to the point.\\" Journalist Keble Howard, after an interview with Sowerby in 1912, wrote that, \\"Rutherford and Son is a marvellous achievement...\\". Plot Rutherford, \\"a bull-headed capitalist who crushes his own children beneath the wheels of industry\\" has built a glassmaking business which he has always intended to pass onto his son, John. He sent John to Harrow School to have him educated as a gentleman, but to his disgust John turned his back on the business and went to London, where he married a working-class girl, Mary. When John and Mary had a child, Tony, they could not afford to feed and look after the baby properly, and they have come back to live in Rutherford's house. Rutherford dominates the household, consisting of Ann, his sister, and his children John, Richard and Janet; he barely acknowledges Mary's existence. John, trained in chemistry, has developed a metal which he believes can save the business a great deal of money; but rather than giving it to his father to benefit the business, he regards it as his to sell to make his fortune. He tries to sell it to his father, who turns him down as he believes that John owes him it both in return for bringing him up and to benefit the business which will ultimately come to John. To support his estimation of the value of his invention, John says that he has shared it with his father's right-hand man Martin, whose opinion of it was favourable. Martin is seen sharing a passionate kiss with Rutherford's daughter Janet, and they arrange a further meeting in secret. Rutherford's other son Richard (Dick), who is a curate, comes to ask his father's permission to leave the house and take a position in Blackpool. He also asks his father to see Mrs Henderson, the mother of a lad Rutherford has sacked. During the course of an acrimonious discussion she tells him that Janet and Martin are carrying on. After Dick has gone, Rutherford summons Martin from the mill, and persuades him to betray John's trust and give him the recipe. He argues that this is needed to save the business, which he tells him has been losing money for seven years. When Martin has left, Janet comes in and Rutherford asks her how long it has been going on. She does not attempt to deny the affair, and tells her father what she has long wanted to say to him about her life and how he bullies her and her brothers. Rutherford tells her that she may stay the night, but when he comes home tomorrow she is to be gone and will never be mentioned in the house again. In the morning Janet is euphoric about her coming freedom and new life with Martin. Martin comes in dazed: after he delivered the recipe, Rutherford dismissed him. He does not respond to Janet's euphoria at all; but he says he will make an honest woman of her, and tries to give her some money. She eventually realises that her dream is not to be, and leaves the house alone. Martin has come not to see Janet, but to tell John that he has betrayed him. John is furious and despairs, thinking that his one hope of a life of his own has vanished. He steals all the money he finds in his father's desk, against his wife's begging him not to: he is convinced that by right it is his. He is talking of their going to Canada to make a new life; but Mary persuades him that it is better for him to go alone, and send for her and Tony when he is established. With all three children gone, Mary speaks up to Rutherford, and offers him a bargain: if he will keep and clothe her and her son for ten years, she will then hand the boy over to him entirely to be trained to take over the business. Rutherford accepts, and tells her \\"I'm known as a hard man. But I don't know that I could have stood there and spoken as you have\\". Revival and later productions After its initial success Rutherford and Son dropped out of sight, although the BBC Home Service broadcast a radio version in its Saturday Night Theatre slot on 29 November 1952, starring the Lancashire-born actors Frank Pettingell and Belle Chrystall. The play's modern revival did not get underway until 1980 when a production by the feminist theatre company Mrs Worthington's Daughters (directed by Julie Holledge) was staged at the Royal Court Upstairs before going on tour. Since then, there have been major productions at the New End Theatre, Hampstead (directed by Wyn Jones) in 1988; the Stephen Joseph Theatre, Scarborough (directed by Alan Ayckbourn) in 1991; the Royal National Theatre (directed by Katie Mitchell) in 1994; the Mint Theater Company, New York (2001 and 2012); the Salisbury Playhouse (directed by Joanna Read) in 2001; the Shaw Festival, Ontario (directed by Jackie Maxwell) in 2004; the Royal Exchange, Manchester (directed by Sarah Frankcom) in 2005, and a production by Threshold Theatre at Northern Stage, Newcastle upon Tyne (directed by Richard Beecham) in 2009 ‚Äì the first professional production on Tyneside, where the play is set. In 2013 Jonathan Miller directed a Northern Broadsides production with some adaptations to the text by Blake Morrison. Rutherford was played by the company founder Barrie Rutter. The production toured the UK and had a short run in the West End at the St James Theatre. In 2019 Cody Holliday Haefner directed a production with the University of Washington School of Drama at the Jones Playhouse, Seattle. Also in 2019 Caroline Steinbeis directed a production at the Crucible Theatre, Sheffield and a production by Polly Findlay opened at the National Theatre, with Roger Allam in the title-role. In 1998, Rutherford and Son was included in the list of the top one hundred plays of the twentieth century by the Royal National Theatre. Further reading More information and the text of this play can be found in the Mint Theater collection of plays, entitled, Worthy But Neglected: Plays of the Mint Theater Company, edited by Jonathan Bank. The performing rights are handled by Samuel French & Co. The play is also included in the volume Classic Plays by Women edited by Susan Croft (Aurora Metro, 2010), alongside work by Hroswitha, Elizabeth Cary, Aphra Behn, Susannah Centlivre, Joanna Baillie, Enid Bagnold, Caryl Churchill and Marie Jones. A biography of Sowerby, Looking for Githa, was published by Patricia Riley in 2009 and in a revised and expanded edition in 2019 (Stairwell Books).

Situated on a bluff high above the Alabama River, the now near-ruinous house is considered by architectural historians to be one of the most refined and unusual Greek Revival-style houses in the state. History Elm Bluff was established around 1840 by John Jay Crocheron, who enslaved up to 200 people to work his land. A lifelong bachelor, Crocheron was born on August 21, 1795, in Richmondtown, Staten Island, New York. He was the son of John Crocheron and Johanna Houseman, both French Huguenots. After his father died, Crocheron moved to Alabama. He was elected as one of 12 directors for the Bank of Alabama during the 1820s, when the bank was located in Cahaba. There he established a successful mercantile business and engaged in various commercial enterprises in Mobile, including ownership of steamships. Portrait of John Jay Crocheron, painted in 1825. By 1840, John Jay Crocheron had transferred the running of the mercantile business in Cahaba to his half-brother, Richard Conner Crocheron, one of his many relatives who had moved to Alabama from New York. His brick mansion at Cahaba burned in the early 20th century, although some of the monumental brick columns remain, known now as the \\"Crocheron Columns.\\" After he transferred his businesses to Richard, John Jay Crocheron moved to Elm Bluff, near his Crocheron and Stoutenborough relatives in Richmond, named in honor of their former home in New York. He began acquiring additional property until his forced-labor farm comprised several thousand acres. In 1845, he completed the main house. His great-niece and longtime Dean of Barnard College, Virginia Crocheron Gildersleeve, described life at Elm Bluff in her memoirs, Many a good crusade: The near-ruinous library at Elm Bluff in 2008. > Elm Bluff was a large plantation with about two hundred slaves. My great- > uncle entertained many of his neighbors and friends there. As he had no > wife, he used to bring down from the North a \\"lady housekeeper,\\" so called, > who presided and acted as hostess. In those days travel was almost entirely > by river steamers, which had a habit of running on mudbanks and being > delayed for a day or two at a time. Gentlemen from the plantations for many > miles around used to ride to Elm Bluff and settle down with my great-uncle > to stay as might be necessary, until their steamer came along and carried > them on down to Mobile. In the big house at Elm Bluff there was a large > library, and there, laid out on a long table, were American periodicals and > many European ones. I like to know this and to realize that the people who > lived in Alabama in those long-ago days were not cut off from the world. During the American Civil War, when many of his family members had returned to New York, John Jay Crocheron stayed in Alabama and helped finance a Confederate cavalry unit, named in his honor. Crocheron presented over 100 Colt Dragoon Revolvers to the men of this company at the start of the war. In honor of their benefactor, they named their company after him. The Governor of Alabama, from a stockpile of 600, presented each commissioned officer of the early Alabama companies with a Colt 1851 Navy Revolver. Four officers with the Crocheron Light Dragoons were presented one of these guns from the governor. Three of the four Crocheron Light Dragoon Colt Navy‚Äôs survive. The Crocheron Light Dragoons served as the escort company to successive commanders of the Army of Tennessee following the Battle of Shiloh, continuing until the end of the Civil War. These commanders were Braxton Bragg, Joseph E. Johnston, and John Bell Hood. John Jay Crocheron died before the end of the war, on October 17, 1864. Architecture Considered by architectural scholars to be a \\"New York house in a Deep South setting,\\" Crocheron's house at Elm Bluff serves as evidence of his Staten Island origins. Stylistically the house features details usually associated more with the expression of the Greek Revival style in the Northeast and Midwest than with that of the South. Elm Bluff in the early 20th century The -story house is built of plantation-produced brick, with granite window sills and lintels. The granite was shipped from the Northeast by Crocheron. The exterior featured a one-story fluted Doric portico, now partially destroyed, centered on the front facade. The front and side facades feature full-height Doric pilasters, six on the front and four on each side. The rear of the house originally incorporated a two-story brick ell to one side, used as a domestic wing. It has been completely destroyed. A one- story rear porch wrapped around the remaining length of the main rear facade and one side of the ell. The most unusual feature of the house is its \\"eyebrow\\" windows set into the frieze above the pilasters, each originally masked with wooden screens using a Greek Key motif. More commonly seen in Northeastern houses, these windows admitted light and air to the low-ceilinged rooms on the largely hidden third floor. The soffits feature mutules studded with guttae. A hipped roof tops the cornice. The interior of Elm Bluff is divided by a spacious center hall on all levels, usually with two rooms to each side. The brick interior walls are plastered. A series of wide staircases in the central halls of each level wind up to the third floor. Like the exterior, the interior originally demonstrated a high level of finish. Many of the architectural elements were taken from pattern books, such as those by Minard Lafever and Asher Benjamin. Most of the wooden details, such as base boards, stair banisters, and door facings, have now been removed or vandalized. Details that have survived intact are the Greek Revival casings that survive on some of the window and door openings on the upper floors and finely contoured plasterwork crown moldings.

From 10 April 1919, according to republican Austrian law, his name was Maximilian Eugen Habsburg-Lothringen.  Life  Maximilian was the second son of Archduke Otto of Austria and Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony.Daniel Willis, The Descendants of Louis XIII, Chapter 6: The Imperial Family of Austria (Clearfield, 1999): 508‚Äì509. In 1915 Maximilian was made a knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece, the special order of the dynasty, by his great-uncle Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria. During World War I Maximilian served as a major in the Austro-Hungarian Army. He also had the rank of corvette captain in the Austro-Hungarian Navy.Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels, F√ºrstliche H√§user Band I (Gl√ºcksburg: C.A. Starke, 1951): 92. In February 1917 Maximilian was sent to Berlin to formally notify the German Emperor Wilhelm II of the accession of Maximilian's brother Charles as Emperor of Austria.\\"Imperial and Foreign News Items\\", The Times (February 3, 1917): 7. In 1917 / 1918, with consent of Charles I, Maximilian established his household at Belvedere Palace in Vienna, held to the disposition of the imperial family by the government of Austria. In June 1918 Maximilian led the Austrian assault on the Dosso Alto. The air pressure of a shell which landed near him broke his ear-drum and caused a certain deafness.\\"Emperor's Brother Injured\\", The Times (June 24, 1918): 9. Maximilian was decorated with the Grand Cross of the Order of Leopold (with the war decoration and swords) for the Austrian victory.\\"Charles Decorates His Brother\\", New York Times (June 24, 1918): 2.\\"\\"Maximilian Is Dead on French Riviera\\", New York Times (January 9, 1952): 15. However, in August the Italians re-captured the Dosso Alto.\\"The Austrian Reverse by Lake Garda\\", The Times (August 6, 1918): 3. After the end of World War I, in December 1918 some monarchists suggested that he succeed his brother as emperor.\\"Vienna Royalists Active\\", New York Times (December 18, 1918): 2. As Charles I, not anymore participating in state affairs since November 12, 1918, still considered himself emperor, this suggestion did not conform to the family rules of the dynasty. Meanwhile, on 12 November 1918, the Provisional National Assembly of German Austria declared the country a republic. On 3 April 1919, the Constitutional National Assembly elected in February passed the Habsburg Law which stipulated members of the former ruling family could only live in Austria if they cancelled their membership to the Habsburg Dynasty with its monarchial aspirations and if they declared themselves loyal citizens of the republic. Maximilian obviously preferred to live outside of Austria, following the example of the last imperial couple. Maximilian Eugen Habsburg-Lothringen and his family in 1919 were given permission to live in Switzerland on condition that he did not engage in political activity. (The same permission was given to Charles I, Zita and their children, who had moved there in March 1919.) Maximilian's family then moved to Bavaria, where they lived in Munich and along Lake Starnberg. Later they moved to France. In exile Maximilian sometimes used the aliases Count Wernberg and Count von Kyburg. He graduated from law school and earned the degree Doctor of Laws. In April 1922 Maximilian attended the funeral of his brother Charles in Funchal, Madeira,Gordon Brook-Shepherd, Uncrowned Emperor: The Life and Times of Otto von Habsburg (London: Hambledon and London, 2003), 72. after which Zita and her children returned to mainland Europe. In June 1923 Maximilian sued his late brother's secretary Baron von Steiner for fraud in the sale of some family jewels.\\"Sues Habsburg Secretary\\", New York Times (June 6, 1923): 20. In November 1930 Maximilian attended the ceremony in Ham, Belgium commemorating the coming-of-age of his nephew Otto, from then onwards until 1 January 2007 chief of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine.Brook-Shepherd, 77. In November 1933 the government of the Republic of Austria under chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss, who earlier this year had declared the parliament to have dissolved itself and did not undertake any action to hold elections, gave permission for Maximilian to reside in Austria.\\"Telegrams in Brief\\", The Times (November 3, 1933): 13. On 27 April 1945, the second Republic of Austria returned to the republican laws valid before dictatorial rule. Maximilian died in 1952 of a heart attack in a hotel in Nice; he was 56. His remains lie in a sarcophagus in the crypt of the schloss church in Altshausen (the burial place of the dukes of W√ºrttemberg). Marriage and children Maximilian married on 29 November 1917 in Schloss Laxenburg (near Vienna), Princess Franziska zu Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Schillingsf√ºrst, daughter of Prince Konrad of Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Schillingsf√ºrst and Countess Franziska von Sch√∂nborn-Buchheim.

It is located south-southwest of Baudette, Minnesota. It was closed in 1979. History Baudette Air Force Station was initially part of Phase II of the Air Defense Command Mobile Radar program. The Air Force approved this expansion of the Mobile Radar program on October 23, 1952. Radars in this network were designated ‚ÄúSM.‚Äù The station became operational on 1 October 1958 when the 692d Aircraft Control and Warning SquadronCornett & Johnson, p. 161 began operating an AN/FPS-3 and a pair of AN/FPS-6 height-finder radars, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. During 1959 Baudette AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, feeding data to DC-10 at Duluth IAP, Minnesota. After joining, the squadron was redesignated as the 692d Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 15 December 1959. The radar squadron provided information around the clock to the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. In 1962 Baudette received an AN/FPS-24 search radar, and during 1963 an AN/FPS-26A height-finder radar was installed, replacing one AN/FPS-6, and the other AN/FPS-6 height-finder radar was upgraded to an AN/FPS-90. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-132. In addition to the main facility, Baudette operated the following AN/FPS-18 Gap Filler sites: * Big Falls, MN (SM-132A) * Middle River, MN (SM-132B) Over the years, the equipment at the station was upgraded or modified to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information gathered by the radars. The AN/FPS-90 height-finder radar was retired in late 1971. The 692nd Radar Sq was inactivated and replaced by the 692d Air Defense Group in March 1970.Cornett, & Johnson,p.86 The upgrade to group status was done because of Baudette AFS' status as a Backup Interceptor Control (BUIC) site. BUIC sites were alternate control sites in the event that SAGE Direction Centers became disabled and unable to control interceptor aircraft. The group was awarded the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award for exceptionally meritorious service for the period 1 June 1971 through 31 May 1973AF Pamphlet 900-2, 30 Sep 76 , p. 87 The group was inactivated and replaced by the 692nd Radar Squadron as defenses against manned bombers were reduced.

Credit: Wellcome Collection  Biography  He was born in Monifieth, Forfarshire, Scotland, the son of Samuel Miller Low, a manufacturer of flax machinery and educated at Madras College and the University of St Andrews. Having graduated MA from the University, he then studied for a medical degree at the University of Edinburgh graduating MD in 1897. For the next two years he was a resident house doctor at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. In November 1899 he moved to London to work at the new London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine under Patrick Manson. He was sent to Vienna to learn a new technique for sectioning mosquitos and on his return was able to use the technique to prove that mosquitos pass on parasites from person to person during the act of biting. In 1900 he spent three months in a malaria-ridden part of Italy and by avoiding mosquitos demonstrated that they were responsible for the transmission of the disease. He spent 1901 in the West Indies, confirming Manson's discovery that filaria (a small worm) transmitted by mosquitos was the cause of elephantiasis. In 1903 he was head of a team sent to Uganda to investigate the cause of \\"sleeping sickness\\" which unfortunately failed to identify the true cause (Trypanasoma sp.) of the outbreak. His companions were Cuthbert Christy and Aldo Castellani. On his return in 1903 he was appointed superintendent of the Albert Dock Seamen's Hospital (ADH) where the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine was located. He remained there for the rest of his working life, being appointed Physician in 1918 and Senior Physician in 1919. During World War I he was made a Major in the Indian Medical Service, treating sick officers at the ADH. In 1907 he formed, together with James Cantlie, the Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene which in 1920 was granted the Royal prefix to become the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. He was the 12th president of the Society from 1929 to 1933, and oversaw its move into Manson House in Portland Place where it remained until 2003. He was a keen ornithologist and served on the council of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. He married Edith Nash in 1906, they had no children.

He is best known for his role as the original host of the television series Into The Drink, a Travel documentary-style series based around Faulls's background as an underwater filmmaker and journalist. He is also known for his appearances on Gangland, a documentary television series on the History Channel.  Music career  Faulls was a member of several Boston-based bands, including Scarlet Haven (1993‚Äì2000) and The Jaded Salingers (2000‚Äì2002). Described as \\"suicide country\\" and \\"radio-friendly rock with a down-home feel\\"\\"15 in '02\\" by Joan Anderman, Boston Globe January 11, 2002 by early supporters such as Boston writers Jennifer Soong and Greg LalasRadio Daze ‚Äì Boston Magazine and Joan Anderman of the Boston Globe, The Jaded Salingers featured Faulls on guitar and was fronted by musician/filmmaker Elgin James, who met while working together as bouncers at the Paradise Rock Club. Faulls and James have maintained a very close personal and creative relationship since disbanding the Jaded Salingers and continue to collaborate on music and film projects. Faulls played on James's solo release For Carol.. in 2003 and also produced and directed several live concert recordings for James's post-Salingers band Righteous Jams. In 2008 they appeared in the Rage Against Society episode of Gangland in which they spoke openly about their experience/involvement with Boston hardcore gang FSU.  Writing/Filmmaking Career  After the breakup of The Jaded Salingers, Faulls switched his focus to filmmaking, with particular emphasis on the marine environment. Faulls's 2006 documentary Still on Her Keel: The Legacy Of The Chester Poling was nominated for several film festival awards upon release.http://www.ocean.com/ > Program peers into the murky waters of history  savannahnow.com He continues to lecture around the country, considered to be a leading authority on the vessel's history and current condition. Faulls also became highly sought after as a regular contributor for various scuba diving magazines and travel media outlets, gaining notoriety for his unique writing style and harsh criticism of the tourism industry's impact on the marine ecosystem. Also a very outspoken opponent of the commercial fishing industry, for many years he has refused to eat any plant or animal that lives in water.Into the Drink ¬ª There are no words  Into The Drink  In 2008 Faulls began production on the television show Into The Drink, a Travel documentary-style series that drew heavy influence from shows like Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations. Faulls explored the underwater environments of each destination, as well engaging in local customs and points of interest. At each location, he would seek out a beverage ‚Äì usually alcoholic in nature ‚Äì that was indigenous to (or a significant cultural part of) the surrounding area. Although touted in the press as \\"part fish, part rock star\\",\\"http://www.dominica-weekly.com/tag/aaron- faulls/http://www.johnmcleanmedia.com/printables/3795.pdf Faulls was very often placed in situations that were either completely foreign to him or pushed him well out of his comfort zone: firewalking, ziplining, handling dangerous animals & narrowly avoiding a potentially lethal case of decompression sickness are several examples.\\"Under The Sea\\" by Naomi Creason, The Sentinel January 28, 2010 Although some segments warranted serious safety concerns, usually the scenarios were humorous in nature. His extreme arachnophobia, aversion to waking up early, romantic woes and penchant for injuring himself were all recurring themes throughout the series. In addition to his role as host, Faulls wrote, directed and served as musical director for the show's first 12 episodes. Into The Drink debuted on the Tuff TV network in mid-February 2010 and was quickly picked up by syndicators such HDNet, DirecTV and Comcast, as well as several international markets. While the show has drawn considerable (if independent) ratings since its debut, in late March 2010 ‚Äì less than two months after the series premiere ‚Äì production company Liquidassets.tv announced it had chosen a new host for Season 2, which had yet to begin filming. Inconsistencies surrounding the reasons given for Faulls's departure remain, but neither party have commented publicly beyond their respective initial press statements.htmlhtml In late 2010, Into The Drink: The Complete Season One was released on DVD as a 3-disc set. It contains all 12 episodes featuring Faulls as host, the \\"Last Call\\" season finale, a Season 2 preview and \\"surprise footage\\".Into the Drink :: Produced by LiquidAssets.tv Documentary Films Faulls has maintained a low profile following his departure from into The Drink, eschewing on-camera roles and shifting his focus back to a more directorial one. In a December 2010 post on his blog, Faulls announced that he would be at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival to begin production on \\"a few things related to\\" the film Little Birds, written and directed by longtime friend and collaborator Elgin James. Although unwilling to disclose further details, Faulls commented that he was \\"ecstatic\\" about the project. Ultimately he produced and directed an extensive featurette (included on the DVD release) called Taking A Bullet that detailed \\"the journey from script to screen and what the actors & crew went through simply out of an abiding belief in Elgin's vision.\\" html In 2013, Faulls began working with singer/composer Serj Tankian, returning to underwater filmmaking for the first time in 2 years to shoot footage that would serve as the \\"visual score\\" for a movement of Tankian's \\"Orca\\" symphony.

It examines a year in which Chicago drew national headlines for violence and murder that plagued the city. The film features the work of CeaseFire, an initiative of the Chicago Project for Violence Prevention. In 2004, Tio Hardiman (ex-Director of CeaseFire Illinois) created and implemented The Violence Interrupter concept. Violence interrupters Ameena Matthews, Cobe Williams and Eddie Bocanegra look back on their past experiences with street violence to try to steer young men and women in the right direction. Matthews, the daughter of former Chicago gang leader Jeff Fort, comes to the aid of the mother of Derrion Albert, a Chicago high school student whose death made national headlines when it was captured on videotape. Produced by Kartemquin Films, The Interrupters is directed by Steve James, director of the highly acclaimed documentary, Hoop Dreams, and co-produced by Alex Kotlowitz, author of the award-winning book, There Are No Children Here. Setting The documentary takes place on Chicago's South Side in a myriad of troubled communities. One of the main communities featured is Englewood. Englewood lies approximately 12 miles south of the Loop and began as a home to German and Irish farm and railroad workers.\\"Englewood.\\" Encyclopedia of Chicago. Chicago: Chicago Historical Society, 2005. Web. 5 Mar 2012\\"Zook.\\"Black P Stones.\\" Chicago Gangs. (2012) Web. 5 Mar 2012 However, after World War II, Englewood and the South Side of Chicago as a whole became known as the \\"Black Belt.\\" This is in reference to the predominantly African American population moving to this area. As of the year 2000, 0.6% of Englewood residents are White, while 98.2% are Black or African American. 5.2% of Englewood residents over the age of twenty-five have obtained a bachelor's degree or higher. The unemployment rate of Englewood residents over the age of sixteen is 25.8%. Residents participate in gang activities and drug trafficking to make money. The crime statistics for February 24, 2012 detail thirty-three documented crimes in a span of twenty- four hours. One third of those crimes were narcotic offenses. Most of the drug activity can be traced back to two notorious gangs that run the area: The Gangster Disciples and the Black P Stones. The Interrupters' Ameena Matthews has ties to the Black P Stones as her father, Jeff Fort, was the founder and leader. Release and reception The Interrupters premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival. On March 3, 2011, The Interrupters made its international premiere at the 2011 Adelaide Film Festival in Australia. The film also picked up the Special Jury Award at the 18th annual Sheffield Doc/Fest - the UK's largest documentary festival - in June 2011. It was broadcast in Canada on the CBC News Network documentary series The Passionate Eye on January 28, 2012. It was broadcast as part of the PBS series, Frontline, in February 2012. Early reviews for the film suggested that The Interrupters was an early candidate for a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, but it was not nominated. The film holds a \\"Certified Fresh\\" 99% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 88 reviews, with the consensus stating \\"Impeccably crafted and edited, The Interrupters is a tough and honest documentary about street violence that truly has the power to inspire change.\\" With 36.2% of the vote, The Interrupters won a poll asking readers of IndieWire, an International Independent Film website, \\"what buzz heavy 2011 film are you most excited to see?\\". After watching a screening of The Interrupters in October 2011, Bermuda's National Security Minister vowed to implement a CeaseFire-style program in the country.

It is located north of Finland, Minnesota. It was closed in 1980. In 1950 Air Defense Command selected Finland, Minnesota site as one of twenty-eight radar stations built as part of the second segment of the permanent radar surveillance network. Prompted by the start of the Korean War, on July 11, 1950, the Secretary of the Air Force asked the Secretary of Defense for approval to expedite construction of the second segment of the permanent network. Receiving the Defense Secretary's approval on July 21, the Air Force directed the Corps of Engineers to proceed with construction. History Finland Air Force Station began as a ‚ÄúLashup-Permanent‚Äù radar site (LP-69) with the 756th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron operating an AN/CPS-5 radar at the station on 30 Nov 1951, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-control intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. On 1 May 1951 the station joined the \\"permanent\\" ADC network operating AN/FPS-3 and AN/FPS-5 radars. By 1959 these radars had been replaced with AN/FPS-20 and AN/FPS-6 sets, and a second height-finder radar (AN/FPS-6A) was being installed. During 1959 Finland AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, initially feeding data to DC-10 at Duluth AFS, Minnesota. After joining, the squadron was re-designated as the 756th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 15 December 1959. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. In 1961 the search radar was upgraded and redesignated as an AN/FPS-64. In 1963 the height-finder radars were replaced by AN/FPS-26A and AN/FPS-90 sets, and on 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-69. In 1964 the AN/FPS-64 was replaced by an AN/FPS-27. The AN/FPS-90 height-finder radar was decommissioned in 1970. In addition to the main facility, Calumet operated the following AN/FPS-18 Gap Filler sites: * Upson, WI (P-69B) * Askov, MN (P-69C) * Aurora, MN (P-69D) Over the years, the equipment at the station was upgraded or modified to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information gathered by the radars. Finland came under Tactical Air Command jurisdiction in October 1979 with the inactivation of Aerospace Defense Command and the formation of ADTAC. The 756th Radar Squadron was inactivated 15 Aug 1980. The Ground/Air Task Oriented Radar (GATR) site was retained until the Joint Surveillance System (JSS) switchover in 1984. Today the radar station is largely abandoned. The former Air Force Housing area was in use as single-family housing, but is now also mostly abandoned.

Design and development John Gaunt's first biplane (1910) and his monoplane (1911) both crashed during attempts to get airborne, but biplane no.2 'Baby' was much more successful. It had a lower wingspan which was somewhat less than that of the upper wingspan. The wings and interplane struts formed a single bay structure with additional pairs of interplane struts close to the fuselage in place of cabane struts, and an outward-leaning single strut on each side from the lower wingtip to the overhanging upper plane. The wings were unusual for the time, being covered not with fabric but thin plywood sheets. These were sewn together through eyelets inserted into them. Lateral control was provided by wing warping. The fuselage was rectangular in cross-section and tapered towards the tail. A deep chord tailplane with highly swept leading edges and a pair of elevators with rounded trailing edges was mounted on top. At least part of the rudder projected below the fuselage. It was protected from the ground by a long tailskid, mounted well below the fuselage on a long post which also extended above the fuselage and appears, in a photograph, to have carried a small flag. The pilot's open cockpit was positioned close to the trailing edge of the wing, which had a large cutout to improve visibility. The main undercarriage was built around a central skid, mounted on a pair of transverse V-struts to the fuselage. The two landing wheels were mounted on a split axle, attached to the skid. The Baby was powered by a 30 hp (22 kW) Alvaston twin-cylinder, horizontally-opposed, water-cooled engine in the nose. It drove a two-blade propeller and was cooled by a pair of rectangular radiators, mounted longitudinally on the top edges of the fuselage, between the engine and the pilot, with their top edges attached to the lower surface of the upper wing. Operational history John Gaunt flew his aircraft successfully for the first time on 12 June 1911 from his base on Southport sands. On 23 June, he covered a total of about seven miles, still flying mostly in straight lines. In the first week of July, he increased the distance covered, despite a member of the crowd he had attracted, who, unnoticed, bent one elevator out of shape and almost caused a crash. By 24 July, he had achieved flights of 30 minutes and reached an altitude of 300 ft (100 m). On 4 August, he made his first cautious turn but turns on windy days remained a problem into early September. That month, the Baby was flown successfully by another pilot, W.S Leveson- Gower, who posed no problems for the aircraft despite weighing 70 lb (32 kg) more than Gaunt. It seems the aircraft flew again in the summer of 1912, but that a crash on 22 August ended its career.

The 2011 North Devon District Council election took place on 5 May 2011 to elect members of North Devon District Council in Devon, England. The whole council was up for election and the Conservative party lost overall control of the council to no overall control. Background Before the election the council was controlled by the Conservatives with 22 councillors, compared to 17 Liberal Democrats and 4 independents. However North Devon was reported as one of the councils that the Conservatives were most likely to lose control of in 2011. There were 120 candidates standing in the election for the 43 seats on the council. These were made up of 36 Conservatives, 33 Liberal Democrats, 20 independents, 17 Green Party, 10 Labour, 2 Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition, 1 United Kingdom Independence Party and 1 Communist Party of Britain. The candidates included the former Liberal Democrat leader of the council, Malcolm Prowse, and Yvette Gubb, who both quit the Liberal Democrats to stand as independents in the election. Election result The results saw the Conservative lose their majority on the council, dropping to 18 seats after suffering a net loss of four councillors. The Liberal Democrats stayed as the main opposition with 14 seats, but also dropped 3 seats. It was independents who made progress in the election, with the number of independent councillors going up to 11. Overall turnout in the election was 45.33%, ranging from a high of 63% in Bratton Fleming to a low of 30% in Forches and Whiddon Valley. Among the councillors to lose their seats to independents were Conservatives Dick Jones and John Gill in Fremington and Liberal Democrats Carol Mccormack-Hole and Sue Sewell in Bickington and Roundswell, and South Molton respectively. Successful independent candidates included the former Conservative Rodney Cann and the former Liberal Democrat Malcolm Prowse. 10 of the 11 elected independent councillors divided up into 3 groups, New Wave, containing Rodney Cann, Joanne Bell, Frank Biederman and Brian Hockin, North Devon First, containing Malcolm Prowse, Julia Clark and Yvette Gubb, and Independent Group, containing Mike Edmunds, Eric Ley and Walter White. The final independent, John Moore, was not part of any group. Following the election a coalition between the Liberal Democrat and independent councillors took control of the council from the former Conservative administration. Liberal Democrat Brian Greenslade became the new council leader, taking over from Conservative Des Brailey, while independent Rodney Cann became deputy leader. The new cabinet was made up of 5 Liberal Democrats and 4 independents. 2 independent candidates were unopposed.

Born in Melbourne, Purves Smith studied at the Grosvenor School of Modern Art in London and under progressive art teacher George Bell in Melbourne. In his student years, Purves Smith emerged as a uniquely confident artist. He was the first modern artist in Australia to paint historical Australian subjects, including the explorers Burke and Wills, and was among the first Australian artists to have direct contact with the international Surrealist movement. He travelled throughout Europe in the late 1930s, painting many of his most celebrated works in Paris. In 1941, art critic Clive Turnbull identified Purves Smith, William Dobell, and Purves Smith's close friend Russell Drysdale as \\"the three most significant Australian artists\\" of the era.Turnbull, Clive. \\"Americans See Our Art\\". The Herald. November 1941. However, Purves Smith's artistic career was put on hold while he served in World War II, and later by illness. He died in 1949, leaving behind a small yet influential body of work. Early life and education Peter Purves Smith was born on 26 March 1912 in East Melbourne, the second child and only son of Victorian-born graziers William Purves Smith and Loe Purves Smith. The family's male line in Australia extends back to Peter's grandfather Thomas Smith (1830‚Äì87), who emigrated from Darnick, Roxburghshire, in the Scottish Borders to the Colony of Victoria during the early days of the Victorian gold rush in 1854. Thomas rapidly prospered, establishing various businesses and acquiring farming properties and inner Melbourne mansions. William‚Äîalthough distant from Thomas‚Äîtook to his father's alternating lifestyle of rural farming and leisured vacations in the city. By 1905, William had married Laura (Loe) Chapman and was wool-growing at Dwarroon, outside Warrnambool. They raised their children Alison (known as Jocelyn) and Peter in various places throughout Victoria, never settling permanently in one place. Purves Smith attended a prep school in England and Geelong Grammar School in Australia, alongside future artist and friend Russell Drysdale. In order to please his father, Peter entered the Royal Australian Naval College in 1926, but dropped out three years later to become a jackaroo near Hay by the Murrumbidgee River.Niagara Galleries (2008). Blue Chip X Exhibition: List of Works and Catalogue Notes. pg. 16. Retrieved on 15 February 2011. William Purves Smith committed suicide on Christmas Eve, 1932. Following his father's suicide, Peter travelled extensively throughout Europe. In England, 1934, Purves Smith's sister Jocelyn noticed his hobby of drawing, and suggested he attend an art school. He studied under Iain Macnab at Grosvenor School of Modern Art in 1935, and back in Australia under George Bell at the Bourke Street Studio School. There he met again old Geelong friend Russell Drysdale, and fellow Bell student Maisie Newbold, whom he married in 1946 at Toorak with Drysdale as best man. Drysdale, too, had been a jackaroo, and both artists worked closely together and influenced each other's art. Apart from his teachers and Drysdale, Amedeo Modigliani, Paul Nash, Henri Rousseau, Maurice Utrillo, Christopher Wood and surrealism impacted what would become Purves Smith's highly personal style. =Student works= Image:Peter Purves Smith - French Cafe, 1936.jpgFrench Caf√©, 1936, Art Gallery of South Australia Image:Peter Purves Smith - New York, 1936.jpgNew York, 1936, Art Gallery of New South Wales Image:Purves Smith Lucile 1937.jpgLucile, 1937, Queensland Art Gallery Image:Peter Purves Smith - Nude 1937.jpgNude, 1937, Heide Museum of Modern Art Image:Peter Purves Smith - The Blue Head, 1937.jpgBlue Head, 1937, Art Gallery of South Australia Image:Peter Purves Smith - Ricketts Point, 1937.jpgRicketts Point, 1937, Art Gallery of South Australia Image:Peter Purves Smith - Topee, 1937.jpgTopee, 1937, National Gallery of Australia Image:Peter Purves Smith Burke Wills 1937.jpgBurke and Wills (The Perish), 1937, Benalla Art Gallery Work and travel Kangaroo Hunt, 1938, Museum of Modern Art (New York) Throughout the late 1930s, Purves Smith painted in London and Paris, which critic Bernard William Smith cites as his most important era. Not only did Purves Smith paint his new physical surroundings (1939's Early Morning in Paris) and political environment (1938's The Nazis, Nuremberg), but also recalled works of the Australian landscape, namely Kangaroo Hunt (1938), which was included in the touring exhibition Art of Australia 1788-1941, and acquired by the Museum of Modern Art, New York. In 1939, art critic Gino Nibbi said \\"Purves Smith seems one of the most qualified at the present time to give some allegorical interpretations of the virgin appearance of the Australian landscape\\". He painted a scene from the Burke and Wills expedition in 1937 (several years before Sidney Nolan began his Burke & Wills series), and the \\"pole-like trees, elongated figures, sheets of iron, and low horizons\\" of his early 1940 Drought landscapes anticipated \\"in more ways than one\\" the future direction of Drysdale's art.Russell Drysdale 1912‚Äì1950: Essay 1, abc.net.au. Retrieved on 19 January 2011. According to art historian Sasha Grishin, Purves Smith's \\"apocalyptic\\" depictions of Australia's desolate interior convey a fear of vast space, and employ a \\"recognizable Australian setting to express both personal, as well as broader social anxieties\\" in the lead up to war. World War II Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, and Britain, which had made an alliance with Poland in August, declared war. During this time, Purves Smith was vacationing in California with his mother; the outbreak of war caused him to make a detour to the Grand Canyon, about which he wrote to Maisie in a characteristically facetious tone: \\"If one is to die gloriously one might as well see a few things first\\".Eagle, p. 134 He returned to London in October and tried to enlist in the British army, but was told to wait. During the intervening months his state of mind became \\"paralytic\\" and he withdrew from social life. Maisie, now back in Melbourne, urged Peter to return to Australia. Despite missing Maisie and suffering from homesickness, he successfully joined up in May 1940.Eagle, p. 137 Purves Smith's first role in the army was to transport petrol and military supplies across the south of England. Life in the training camps was mentally numbing, and before each academic exam Purves Smith feared being given the bum's rush. In September 1941, having volunteered for a posting abroad, he went on active service in West Africa (then known by soldiers as the \\"white man's grave\\"). Purves Smith was a lieutenant stationed in Nigeria with the West African Forces' 11th General Transport Company. Not much is known about his time there as the postal censor checked mail from the front for military information. What remains of Purves Smith's letters describes the day-to-day aspects of life in the jungle, including dashes into the African wilds and his growing revulsion at body odour and the sight of sweat.Eagle, p. 143 Detailed histories of the West Africa Campaign indicate his company travelled along the Takoradi supply route, which was established in August 1940 as a means of bypassing Vichy French territories to reach upper Egypt.Eagle, p. 141 The route lasted until September 1943, coinciding with the end of Purves Smith's service in Africa. Much later, Purves Smith painted a memory of Chad in West Africa (1948, National Gallery of VictoriaCollection Online > Peter Purves Smith - West Africa, ngv.vic.gov.au. Retrieved on 29 October 2011.). In 1944, he was one of Major General Orde Wingate's \\"chindits\\" behind Japanese lines in Burma. Immediately after the war, he was hospitalised with tuberculosis. Return to Melbourne In May 1946, he returned to Australia and also to painting with a far more abstract approach. Significant works from this period are The Pleading Butcher and Woman Eating Duck, both painted in 1948 and now held at the National Gallery of Australia.The Pleading Butcher, nga.gov.au. Retrieved on 19 January 2011.Woman Eating Duck, nga.gov.au. Retrieved on 19 January 2011. Purves Smith's final oil painting was a landscape painted from the perspective of his home in Sassafras, in the Dandenong Ranges. It was an attempt to \\"paint like the old boys\\", a reference to early Australian colonial artists such as John Glover. =Later works= Image:Peter Purves Smith - The Pleading Butcher, 1948.jpgThe Pleading Butcher, 1948, National Gallery of Australia Image:Peter Purves Smith - Woman Eating Duck, 1948.jpgWoman Eating Duck, 1948, National Gallery of Australia Death and recognition Peter Purves Smith was hospitalised in 1948, and later drafted to the Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital for major lung surgery. He died of post-operative shock the next day, 23 July 1949, and was cremated.Eagle, p. 177 Despite his small oeuvre of less than 100 paintings and posthumous descent into relative obscurity, Purves Smith emerged as a celebrated artist‚Äîinfluencing many of his contemporaries‚Äîand has been recognised as \\"the first of the young modern artists to look inquiringly at the Australianness of country life\\". His use of surreal elements, colloquial themes and at times biting satire set precedent for the work of the Melbourne- based Angry Penguins in the mid to late 1940s.Gilchrist, Maureen. \\"The retrospective \\"Homage to Peter Purves Smith\\" at the Joseph Browns Gallery (5 Collins Street, City) exhumes a nearly forgotten but important World War II Australian painter\\".

The band was known as one of the most respected bands in the Israeli heavy metal scene, and has gathered very positive feedback abroad. On December 22, 2012, after 11 years of activity, band leader Dory Bar-Or announced that he has decided to put the band to an end. History =Formation and Kindless (2001-2003)= The band was formed in late 2001 by Eyal Glottman (guitars, vocals), Dory Bar-Or (guitars, bass, keyboards) and Eran Asias (drums, percussion), describing themselves as a \\"dark death metal\\" band. In 2002, the band flew to Sweden to record their debut album. The album was recorded at Abyss Studios with producer Tommy T√§gtgren, with guest vocals by Peter T√§gtgren (of Hypocrisy and Bloodbath) and Marcel Schirmer (of Destruction). The album, entitled Kindless was released through Raven Music and Listenable Records in August 2002 to positive reviews from such famed magazines as Metal Hammer and Rock Hard. Following the release of the album, the band performed a series of headlining shows around Israel, as well as opening for such international acts as Destruction, Megadeth, Dismember, Behemoth, Rotting Christ and more. In 2003, bassist Gil Ben-Ya'akov of Breorn joined the band to fill in the bass position which had been vacant since the band's formation. =Line-up changes, Deeds of Hate and Numb EPs and hiatus (2004-2007)= In 2004, the band entered the studio once again to work on new material for their second studio album - Your Gods, My Enemies, though not long after, singer, guitarist and founding member Eyal Glottman left the band, taking with him all of the material he has written for the album. Not long after, drummer Eran Asias also left the band. Drummer Roy Chen of Breorn was recruited to complete the recording of the material. In 2005, the band recorded an EP entitled Deeds of Hate which was planned for release in only 1000 copies, before the band decided not to release it. It was the only release to be recorded with the second line-up as it didn't last long after that. Later in 2005, the band was joined by singer Oren Balbus, Matricide guitarist Auria Sapir and Abed drummer Dror Goldstein. With that line-up, the band recorded a cover of At the Gates' song \\"Blinded by Fear\\" for an At the Gates tribute album. Following more line-up changes, the band recorded another EP, entitled Numb, which was also left unreleased. It was later revealed that Deeds of Hate and Numb were the same EP which was recorded twice, but the band was not satisfied with the material and the recording both times. The band performed its last show in 2006, before deciding to cease work on the new album and go on a hiatus, following line-up changes that got in the way of the album's recording. Following the hiatus, guitarist and founding member Dory Bar-Or moved to Germany to concentrate on his musical career, while writing new material for the album and returning to Israel once in a few months to share the new material with the other band members and rehearse. Eventually, by 2007, the band had finished writing all the material for the album and decided to record it. =Your Gods, My Enemies, line-up changes and break-up (2007-2012)= In March 2007, the band flew again to Sweden to record their second album, Your Gods, My Enemies, from the beginning. This time, they recorded the album with producer Pelle Seather at the Studio Underground. In May 2009, mastering for the album was finished by G√∂ran Finnberg, who previously worked with Opeth and Soilwork, and the band announced that the album was finished and that they were getting ready for a special release show for the album in the following months. They also announced that they were keeping the first working title for the album from 2004, Your Gods, My Enemies, as the album's official title. On January 7, 2010, the band had its comeback show, the band's first show in 3 years. The band debuted new material from the upcoming album and announced that the album would be released in a special release show in a few months. On December 31, 2010, the band's long- awaited second studio album Your Gods, My Enemies was finally released in a small capacity on a special limited edition USB disk on key, featuring the 9 new songs from the album, with additional bonus material such as demos, lyrics, photo galleries and more exclusive content. The band has announced plans to release the album on CD in Israel and worldwide in 2011, as well as a supporting European tour in late 2011. On March 24, 2011, the band performed as a supporting act to Meshuggah on their only show in Israel at the Barby club in Tel Aviv. On May 17, 2011, it was announced that Eternal Gray had signed with the French extreme metal label Season of Mist to release their latest album Your Gods, My Enemies worldwide, in a CD format, in the fall of 2011. The album was previously released only in Israel in a limited edition disk on key format.http://www.metalist.co.il/NewsPrivate.asp?id=3464 On July 20, 2011, Season of Mist announced that the band's second album Your Gods, My Enemies will be officially released through the label on October 14, 2011 in Europe and October 18, 2011 in North America, in a normal CD format as opposed to the previously released disk on key format available only in Israel. On August 26, 2011, the band was set to perform, along with other Israeli bands Phantom Pain and Spawn of Evil, as a supporting act to Vader on their only Israeli show at the Sublime club in Tel Aviv. On July 28, 2011, it was announced that the concert would be postponed to an unknown date following logistical problems and poor ticket sales. On September 20, 2011, the song \\"Lost Control\\" was released for free listening and download from Season of Mist's official website. On the same day, the label also released a video teaser for the upcoming album. On June 28, 2012, it was announced that the band had gone through several line-up changes, with lead vocalist Oren Balbus and bassist Gil Ben-Ya'akov leaving the band. Replacing them would be Zion Mizrachi (Whorecore, ex-Tales from the Morgue) on lead vocals, and Eyal Ben Shushan (The Fading, Beef, ex-Ferium) on bass.http://metalist.co.il/NewsPrivate.asp?id=4283 On December 22, 2012, after 11 years of activity, band leader Dory Bar-Or announced on the band's Facebook page that he has decided to put the band to an end after saying that keeping the band in the vision he had was in the last years exhausting, as well as emotionally draining. =Reunion (2015)= On November 24, 2014, it was announced that Eternal Gray would perform as the backing band to Nevermore singer Warrel Dane on his first solo show in Tel Aviv, Israel, performing songs from his solo career, as well as Nevermore songs, though the band won't play any original songs from their own material. The show took place at the Tmuna Theater in Tel Aviv, on February 5, 2015. On January 27, 2015, it was announced that Eternal Gray would be reuniting for a one-off reunion show, supporting Cannibal Corpse on their show in Tel Aviv on April 8, 2015, as well celebrating 13 years to their debut album Kindless. The band is set to play their debut album in entirely. It will be the band's first live show playing original material, since their Kindless 10 year anniversary show on August 13, 2012. The band played the reunion with the Your Gods, My Enemies line-up, excluding bassist Gil Ben-Ya'akov, who did not take part in the reunion, and was replaced by Matricide bassist Shahar Guy.

It was a single-engined biplane, of which two examples were built, but no production followed. Design and development In 1929, Tetsuo Miki, a designer at Aichi Tokei Denki Kabushiki Kaisha (Aichi Watch and Electrical Machinery Company) started the design of a catapult launched reconnaissance floatplane with the aim of replacing the Nakajima E2N aboard the Imperial Japanese Navy's warships. Miki's design was a small single-engined biplane. Its fuselage was of steel tube construction with fabric covering, while it had wooden wings that folded to the rear for storage aboard ship. Powerplant was a 330 hp (246 kW) Aichi AC-1, an experimental radial engine. The two-man crew sat in open cockpits, while the aircraft's undercarriage consisted of twin floats.Mikesh and Abe 1990, pp. 68‚Äì69. The two prototypes were completed and flown in 1930. The AC-1 engine was not successful, however, and the project was abandoned after one of the prototypes was destroyed when an exhaust fire spread to the fuselage. The type did form the basis of the later Aichi AB-3 floatplane, of which a single example was built in 1932 for China. Specifications See also Notes References *Mikesh, Robert C and Shorzoe Abe.

Original Colchester Rubber Company ball logo History Colchester Rubber Co. was a footwear brand manufactured by the Colchester Rubber Company. The original Colchester Rubber Company, founded in 1888 at Colchester, Connecticut, USA, Colchester Rubber Company Factory c.1890 =Factory= The Colchester Rubber Company factory was located at the intersection of Lebanon Avenue and Mill Street in the factory buildings which previously belonged to the Hayward Rubber Company which was in operation from 1847 to 1885.Colchester Historical Society Collections The Hayward Rubber Company was founded by Nathaniel Hayward, who co-invented vulcanised rubber with Charles Goodyear in 1838. Some of the original Colchester Rubber Company factory ruins can still be seen at the site today.Papers in the Historical Archives of Colchester Library collection Many of the workers in the factory originally came from Ireland. =Founding Owners= The Colchester Rubber Company was founded by George Watkinson who was born 1838. Prior to founding Colchester Rubber Company, George Watkinson was a manager at the Candee Rubber Company. The Colchester Rubber Company factory, or Rubber Works, at Colchester were co-managed by George Watkinson and his son Irving Watkinson. Irving Watkinson was a busy man, as he also kept the Colchester town weather station and was the proverbial man about town raising show dogs and horses while selling bicycles for the Columbia Brand and being the Captain of the town's baseball team. =Products= Colchester Rubber Company catalogue pages from around 1890 The Colchester Rubber Company manufactured high end rubber footwear for men, women and children. Their speciality products were working boots for cold and wet weather, rain boots and galoshes. To complement these products, during the short summer season of April to July, they also made and sold canvas and rubber shoes under the classification of ‚ÄúTennis‚Äù shoes. The somewhat misleadingly named ‚ÄúTennis‚Äù shoe range included shoes for walking, baseball, bicycle, tennis and yachting.Colchester Rubber Co. advertising materials, catalogues and relics 1888-1893 The Colchester Rubber Company's products were rated high end quality and considered by some as #1 in their field. The ‚ÄúTennis‚Äù shoes were the promenade shoe of choice at Newport, Rhode Island during the Gilded Age. The products were also exported worldwide and during the late 1880s and early 1890s were seen on the beaches and board-walks in Europe's many resorts. In 1892 Colchester Rubber Company displayed their footwear at the Chicago World's Fair and Exposition. =Company Takeover= During 1892, Colchester Rubber Company was acquired by The United States Rubber Company as part of their intention to form a monopoly and control the rubber industry in the United States of America by buying a majority of the rubber companies which were in operation at that time.Logan, Kevin J. (November 10, 2009). \\"Guide to the Colt Family Papers 1793-1961\\" (XML). University of Rhode Island Library. =Factory Closure= During the 1893 Depression, the decision was made by The United States Rubber Company to close the factory in Colchester and discontinue the Colchester Rubber Co. brand. This decision was, in part, based on the fact that the town of Colchester was located on what was considered a poor water source for manufacturing and was far from seaports and land transportation hubs. The decision to close the factory was kept secret from the employees and the people of the town of Colchester. George Watkinson was promoted to a Vice President position with The United States Rubber Company in the spring of 1893 and left the town of Colchester on a guise of going on vacation. He was replaced in Colchester by Joseph Banigan who oversaw the last of the production from the factory in Colchester as well as the factory closure. During the Christmas holiday in 1893 the factory employees and the people of the town of Colchester were told that the company was going to re-tool the factory and it would be opened after New Year. Instead of this happening, all the machinery was removed from the factory in Colchester and shipped to The United States Rubber Company's holdings at Providence, Rhode Island. A Colchester Advocate newspaper article in early 1894, editorialized, asked when was the factory was going to re- open.Colchester Advocate Newspapers 1888-1894 When it became clear that the factory was going to stay closed, the town collapsed half of the population leaving and a majority of the businesses in the town subsequently closing. In around 1895, George Watkinson left The United States Rubber Company and opened The Watkinson Rubber Company at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania which, for a period of time was allowed to compete with The United States Rubber Company. The Watkinson Rubber Company factory remained open until around 1903 and was subsequently acquired by U.S. Rubber. George Watkinson is believed to have died around that time.New York Times Article.

It is located east-northeast of Grand Rapids, Minnesota. It was closed in 1963. History Grand Rapids Air Force Station was initially part of Phase II of the Air Defense Command Mobile Radar program. The Air Force approved this expansion of the Mobile Radar program on October 23, 1952. Radars in this network were designated ‚ÄúSM.‚Äù The station became operational on 1 July 1956 when the 707th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron began operating an AN/FPS-3 search radar, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. In 1958 the squadron was operating AN/FPS-20 and AN/FPS-6 sets. During 1959 Grand Rapids AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, initially feeding data to DC-10 at Duluth AFS, Minnesota. After joining, the squadron was re-designated as the 707th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 15 December 1959. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. In addition, an AN/FPS-6B height-finder radar was added that year. In 1962 the AN/FPS-20A was upgraded and redesignated as an AN/FPS-67. In March 1963 the Air Force ordered the site to close. Operations of the 707th RS ceased on 1 August and the site was closed on 30 August. The site was declared excess to GSA on 7 January 1964. Several parcels were conveyed to the Department of the Interior, the Grand Rapids School District # 318, and the Bureau of Mines. The 7.22 acres conveyed to the Bureau of Mines in 1967 was returned to GSA and then sold to nineteen private owners for private residences.

The community was named for the glen and woods near the original town site. Glenwood was the site of a fatal black bear attack of four year old Victoria Valdez near her home in 1974. Climate Glenwood has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Csb) according to the K√∂ppen climate classification system. Land dispute Ownership of this area has been in dispute dating back to the Treaty of 1855. An 1890 survey of the Yakama Reservation, accepted by the General Land Office, did not include the area known as \\"Tract-D\\". The original treaty map, which included the Tract-D area, was found in 1930 after being misplaced for decades. In the meantime of the Glenwood Valley had passed into private ownership. Another were part of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest administered by the United States Department of Agriculture. After more than 100 years of dispute, in 1972 President Richard Nixon by Executive Order 11670 authorized the return of the 21,000 acre portion of Mt.

Little is known for certain of the conflict. Background The story of the main figures involved and the conquest is obscure.Bhattacharyya, Pranab Kumar. Historical Geography of Madhyapradesh from Early Records. Motilal Banarsidass Publishe, 1977. p8 The Nanda Empire, led by Dhana Nanda, was based in Magadha and containing many of the kingdoms in the Ganges basin. Chandragupta was born to a Shudra woman. His ancestry was unknown. The knowledge of statecraft and warfare was taught to Chandragupta by his guru or teacher Chanakya, who is referred to as Kautilya. Kautilya's Arthasastra was a science of politics intended to teach a wise king how to govern.Boesche, Roger. \\"Kautilya's Arthasastra on War and Diplomacy in Ancient India.\\" The Journal of Military History, vol. 67 no. 1, 2003, pp. 9-37. Project MUSE, doi:10.1353/jmh.2003.0006 Chanakya taught the young king a wide-ranging discussions on war and diplomacy. Chanakya's work included; his wish to have his king become a world conqueror, his analysis of which kingdoms are natural allies and which are inevitable enemies, his willingness to make treaties he knew he would break and retain, his doctrine of silent war or a war of assassination against an unsuspecting king, his approval of secret agents who killed enemy leaders and sowed discord among them, his views of men and women as weapons of war, his use of religion and superstition to bolster his troops and demoralize enemy soldiers, the spread of disinformation, and his humane treatment of conquered soldiers and subjects.Boesche, Roger. \\"Kautilya's Arthasastra on War and Diplomacy in Ancient India.\\" The Journal of Military History, vol. 67 no. 1, 2003, pp. 9-37. Project MUSE, doi:10.1353/jmh.2003.0006 War Much of what is known about the conquest comes from accounts written long after the war itself. Ancient historian, Plutarch (AD 46 ‚Äì AD 120) gives an account of parts of the conquest.Barua, Pradeep. The State at War in South Asia. Vol. 2. U of Nebraska Press, 2005. pp13-15 via Project MUSE The conquest was fictionalized in Mudrarakshasa, a political drama in Sanskrit by Vishakadatta composed between 300 CE and 700 CE.Roy, Kaushik. Hinduism and the Ethics of Warfare in South Asia: From Antiquity to the Present. Cambridge University Press, 2012. p61-62 The history is also briefly recounted in Vishnu Purana (unknown date), which emphasizes the importance of Chanakya in the destruction of the Nanda empire.Sharma, Urmila, and Sanjeev Kumar Sharma. Indian Political Thought. Atlantic Publishers & Dist, 2001. p53 In another work, Milinda Panha (dating from 100 BCE), Bhaddasala is named as a Nanda general during the conquest. Estimates of the number of soldiers involved are based in part on ancient Roman sources. Plutarch estimates that Chandragupta's army would later number 600,000 by the time it had subdued all of India, an estimate also given by Pliny ((23 AD‚Äì79 AD)). Pliny and Plutarch also estimated the Nanda Army strength in the east as 200,000 infantry, 80,000 cavalry, 8,000 chariots, and 6,000 war elephants. These estimates were based in part of the earlier work of the Seleucid ambassador to the Maurya, Megasthenes.Mookerji, Radhakumud. Chandragupta Maurya and his times. Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1966. p165-166 One 21st- century author, Suhas Chatterjee, suggests that \\"Chandragupta had to engage all his military strength, even Greek mercenaries from Punjab in his conquest of the Nanda king\\" and according to references about the conquest in the Milinda Panha \\"One lakh of soldiers, 10,000 elephants, 100,000 horses and 5,000 charioteers were killed in the encounter\\". In Mudrarakshasa, Chandragupta was said to have first acquired Punjab, and then combined forces with Chanakya and advanced upon the Nanda Empire. Similarly, Plutarch writes that he first overthrew Alexanders Prefects in the northwest of India. P. K. Bhattacharyya concludes that the war would have consisted of gradual conquest of provinces after the initial consolidation of Magadha. In Mudrarakshasa, he laid siege to Kusumapura (or Pataliputra now Patna), the capital of Magadha, with the help of north-west frontier tribe mercenaries from areas already conquered. The siege may have begun in 320 BCE. By 312 BCE he had conquered all of north and north-west India. In the war, Chandragupta may have allied with the King of Simhapura in Rajputana and Gajapati King of Kalinga (modern day Orissa).Roy, Kaushik. Warfare in Pre-British India‚Äì1500BCE to 1740CE. Routledge, 2015. p46-50 The prior experience of his mercenaries from the Punjab were likely important in his military success.Roy, Kaushik. Military Manpower, Armies and Warfare in South Asia. Routledge, 2015. p13 It is also suggested that Chandragupta's campaign was laid out by using popular guerrilla tactics, as the Nanda Empire was large and had been able to wield large armies that would have been overwhelming to oppose by an upstart.R.G. Grant: Commanders, Penguin (2010). pg. 49 The war brought an end to the Nanda Dynasty and established the Maurya Empire with Chandragupta Maurya as its leader. Aftermath Maurya consisted of at least four provinces at the end of Chandragupta's conquests: Avantirastra (capital: Ujjayini), Daksinapatha (capital: uncertain, perhaps Suvarnagiri), Uttarapatha (capital: Taksasila), and Pracya (capital: Pataliputra). Chanakya later became Chandragupta's prime minister. Chandragupta eventually expanded his empire to southern India and warred with the Seleucid Empire over control over all of north western India and parts of Persia. The Maurya Empire eventually became the most extensive empire in India seen up to the date of when he abdicated.

He is the founding Director of the Center for Multimodal Imaging Genetics (CMIG) at UCSD. Dale founded and initially developed the brain imaging analysis software FreeSurfer as a graduate student at UCSD. He later co-developed FreeSurfer at Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School with Bruce Fischl. In addition to FreeSurfer, his major scientific contributions include developing: a) event related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (with Randy Buckner at Harvard), b) an in vivo method to quantify the gray matter thickness of the cerebral cortex using MRI images (with Bruce Fischl at Harvard), c) an analysis platform to combine fMRI with magnetoencephalography (MEG), d) computational morphometry to automatically label brain regions using MRI scans (with Bruce Fischl at Harvard and Rahul Desikan and Ron Killiany at Boston University), and e) MRI-based methodologies to quantify longitudinal change in brain regions (with Dominic Holland at UCSD). Since 2013, in collaboration with Ole Andreassen at the University of Oslo, and using GWAS summary statistics (p-values and odds ratios), Dale has developed and validated methods for evaluating genetic overlap (pleiotropy) across diseases and phenotypes. These genetic pleiotropy methods have provided valuable insights across a number of diseases and identified novel single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with increased risk for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia, corticobasal degeneration, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and coronary artery disease. In collaboration with Rahul Desikan and Chun Fan, Dale has developed a polygenic score for quantifying the 'personalized' risk for quantifying Alzheimer's disease age of onset. Early life and education Dale was born in Norway in 1964 to Major General Torstein Dale and Unn S√∏iland Dale. He went to college at the University of Texas from 1983 to 1985 and earned a B.A. in Computer Science, after which he served in the Norwegian Air Force. He then ran a small control systems consulting company. From 1989 to 1990 he went to Harvard and MIT on a Fulbright Fellowship, and received an M.S. in Engineering Science. He then pursued graduate studies at UCSD from 1989 to 1994. It was during this period at UCSD that Dale began working on the development of accurate and automated algorithms for head segmentation, which is vital to the correct modeling of EEG/MEG and optical signals. He pioneered methods of combining EEG, MEG, and MRI tests to localize brain activity. He also did important work in surface-based MRI data analysis and in the mapping of the visual cortex. He received a Ph.D. in Cognitive Science in 1994, becoming one of the first graduates of UCSD's Cognitive Science Department. In a 2003 interview, Dale explained that he had ‚Äúalways been interested in using quantitative modeling methods and simulations to answer biological questions,‚Äù and that as a Harvard student he had been ‚Äúinterested in approaching connectionist neural networks from a more biological angle.‚Äù When he went to UCSD to continue his graduate work his interest ‚Äúshifted to learning how to test models of how the brain works. Ideally you'd like to test your models not in anesthetized animals and brain slices, but by measuring brain activity in humans non-invasively. I wanted to study normal people doing normal tasks. That was what brought me to imaging. My goal was to see what kind of things we can measure non-invasively that can be quantitatively related to the models we want to build....I wanted to know what exactly we are measuring, how can you model it, and how can you relate the signal to what is going on in the brain physiologically...at a level that say you could measure invasively and that you could relate to parameters of quantitative models.‚Äù His thesis work at UCSD, he said, ‚Äúwas on the EEG and MEG forward and inverse problems, and how to use anatomical information to constrain the solutions. It is clear that if you only use EEG or MEG measures, the spatial precision is not good enough to make inferences at a scale that's most useful to neuroscience. That led us into trying to use information with higher spatial resolution to constrain or bias our estimations of the signal sources in the brain.‚Äù Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging and Harvard professorship After completing his postgraduate work at UCSD, Dale returned to the Boston area, where from 1996 to 2004 he was an Associate Professor of Radiology at Harvard University and Associate Director of the Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, which is jointly operated by the Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, and MIT. During this period at Harvard, Dale continued to develop noninvasive imaging technologies and used structural MRI to diagnose neurological disorders. It was toward the end of his graduate- student days at Harvard and during his postdoctoral stay at UCSD, Dale later said, that he began working with MRI and fMRI. ‚ÄúThe field had just gotten started,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúWe tried to use cortical surface reconstruction from MRI to constrain the localization of EEG and MEG signals. We also used those geometrical representations of the cortex, combined with functional MRI, to look for maps in the visual cortex. Steve Engel at Stanford had just developed the phase-encoded stimulus paradigm. He showed that if you present subjects with expanding annulus and rotating wedges, you can apply Fourier analysis to fMRI signals on a voxel-by-voxel basis, and obtain a delay map, or an estimate of the retinotopic representation. We thought up the idea of looking at these maps on the cortical surface, because the maps are actually two-dimensional. Although the topology of these maps is simple, their folding makes them complex in volume. In order to visualize and analyze the patterns of brain activity, you really need to take into account the individual geometry of the cortex. So we decided to do an experiment. We went to Massachusetts General Hospital, and tried our little experiment on a weekend....It worked very well and the results got into Science.‚Äù During this period, Dale and Bruce Fischl, a colleague at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital, continued to develop the brain imaging analysis software known as FreeSurfer, which Dale had begun working on at UCSD. Multi-Modal Imaging Laboratory and UCSD professorship Dale has been Professor of Radiology, Neurosciences, Psychiatry, and Cognitive Science at UCSD since 2004, and is the founding Co- Director of UCSD's Multi-Modal Imaging Laboratory (MMIL), which the university's website describes as ‚Äúan interdisciplinary initiative of the Departments of Neurosciences and Radiology.‚Äù Dale is ‚Äúthe designated point person‚Äù in both departments ‚Äúfor integrating the various modes and methods of collecting imaging data, including functional MRI (fMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG), electroencephalography (EEG), and optical imaging.‚Äù Dale's efforts, the website states, ‚Äúare directed in three areas: continuing development and refinement of accurate and automated algorithms for evaluation subjects using multimodality approaches to data collection; statistical analysis of data; and conducting studies in animal models using optical imaging, high field fMRI, and electrophysiological recordings to enhance the interpretation of neuroimaging studies.‚Äù His work has ‚Äúresulted in the development of software tools that enable the automated segmentation of the entire head and brain, including the neocortex and subcortical structures, from MRI data.‚Äù Most recently, Dale and his laboratory colleagues have been using the methods they have developed to assess regional morphometric alterations resulting from aging and from such afflictions as schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease. According to a UCSD website, the work of Dale's laboratory at UCSD has yield several other technological developments, including ‚Äúa method for tracking and correcting for head motion, in real time, during MRI scans; a fully automated method for identifying white matter tracts from MRI scans; and a method for quantifying longitudinal anatomical change from serial MRI scans.‚Äù In addition, the laboratory has produced ‚Äúa free software program that aids in the study of anatomical changes associated with early stages of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). This technology, developed for the Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), involves longitudinal MRI and PET scans as well as CSF biomarkers in a large number of patients.‚Äù Dale has also initiated a number of ‚Äúcollaborative efforts using neuroimaging methods to study the genetic and environmental influences on brain structure and development‚Äù and that an ‚ÄúFDA-approved version of his automated segmentation technology is now in routine use for quantitative assessment of regional atrophy in patients under clinical evaluation for AD/MCI at UCSD.‚Äù In 2009, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). awarded a grant of $8,950,590 under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) to fund a project at UCSD, the Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics Study (PING), in which Dale played a major role. The study made use of ‚Äúsophisticated gene-mapping tools and imaging technology to collect a wealth of data about brain development in children.‚Äù Dale said that ‚ÄúOur major aim is to create a database ‚Äì essentially a map depicting the genomic landscape of the developing human brain ‚Äì as a resource for the scientific community. As a result of the PING project, Dale and his fellow researchers ‚Äúdeveloped a multidimensional set of brain measurements that, when taken together, can accurately assess a child‚Äôs age with 92 percent accuracy.‚Äù CorTechs Labs In 2001 Dale co-founded with √Åine Behan the neuroimaging company CorTechs Labs Incorporated in La Jolla, California, for which he serves as Chief Scientific Advisor. CorTechs Labs describes itself as ‚Äúa group of scientists, engineers, business professionals, and clinical specialists dedicated to bringing cutting edge brain image analysis technologies to the commercial market.‚Äù These technologies ‚Äúmay help physicians to more effectively diagnose and treat serious neurological disorders that affect millions of patients worldwide. It is our mission to effectively translate the fruits of such research into routine clinical practice.‚Äù CorTechs's website explains that it ‚Äúis currently bringing to market our next-generation clinical brain morphometry product, NeuroQuant¬Æ,‚Äù a device that ‚Äúautomatically derives critical quantitative anatomical from brain MRIs and compares them to data from healthy individuals, in rough analogy to the normative information that quantitative reports from blood tests provide about molecular markers. Neurologists, neuroradiologists, and other experts in the diagnosis and treatment of CNS disorders can use this product to derive adjunctive information that may aid in the detection and treatment of disease processes in individual patients. This tool can also provide sensitive imaging biomarkers that may reduce the expense and duration of clinical trials.‚Äù In addition, CorTechs has been provided with funding by the U.S. National Institute of Aging ‚Äúto use data collected from the NIH and pharmaceutical- industry co-sponsored Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) project, to establish an indication for use for NeuroQuant¬Æ as an adjunctive tool in the assessment of patients with AD.‚Äù Other professional activities Dale was on the consulting faculty of the NIMH Training Program in Cognitive Neuroscience 2011-2012.

It is located east-northeast of Rochester, Minnesota. It was closed in 1957. History Rochester Air Force Station was established as part of the planned deployment by Air Defense Command of forty-four Mobile radar stations across the United States to support the permanent Radar network established during the Cold War for air defense of the United States. This deployment had been projected to be operational by mid-1952. Funding, constant site changes, construction, and equipment delivery delayed deployment. The 808th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was moved to Rochester on 1 September 1955 by the 31st Air Division, and it achieved operational status in 1956 with an AN/TPS-1D radar, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. Due to budget cuts, it was removed from service and inactivated on 8 September 1957. The radar station was excessed by the Air Force to GSA in July 1958, which conveyed the property in 1959 to the Minnesota State Dept of Health, Education, and Welfare. It was then conveyed to Penz Farms, Inc in the late 1960s or early 1970s. The facility consists of eight major buildings one mess hall, a large garage or shop, and two buildings possibly used for storage. Lesser buildings consist of a pump house for water supply and a small building, possibly used for sewer outfall monitoring. The large, earth-mounded water supply reservoir is still in use. Penz Farms owned the property through May, 2017 including the buildings and water supply, with exception of the sewer-monitoring building, which was not being used. Two of the 'old' barracks had been remodeled and were briefly used as rental units. The other two barracks, mess hall, and storage buildings were used for farm-related activity and storage.

In other words, non-independent mate-choice is when a female's sexual preferences get socially inclined toward those of its fellow female. This behavior is speculated to be one of the driving forces of sexual selection and the evolution of male traits. It is also hypothesized that mate-choice copying can induce speciation due to the selective pressure for certain, preferred male qualities. Moreover, mate-choice copying is one form of social learning in which animals behave differently depending on what they observe in their surrounding environment. In other words, the animals tend to process the social stimuli they receive by observing the behavior of their conspecifics and execute a similar behavior to what they observed. Mate choice copying has been found in a wide variety of different species, including (but not limited to): invertebrates, like the common fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster);F. Mery, S.A.M. Varela, E. Danchin, S. Blanchet, D. Parejo, I. Coolen, and R.H. Wagner (2009). \\"Public versus personal information for mate copying in an invertebrate\\". Current Biology 19:730-734. fish, such as guppies (Poecilia reticulata) and ocellated wrasse; birds, like the black grouse; and mammals, such as the Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus) and humans. Most studies have focused on females, but male mate copying has been also found in sailfin mollies (Poecilia latipinna) and humans.  Mechanism  = Visual copying = guppies tend to exhibit mate-choice copying by employing visual observation of a demonstrator female's mate choice. Mate-choice copying requires a highly developed form of social recognition by which the observer (i.e. copier) female recognizes the demonstrator (i.e. chooser) female when mating with a target male and later recognizes the target male to mate with it. Though it might seem simple, observer females actually do not copy the choice of any haphazard, demonstrator female; instead, they copy based on their perception of the demonstrator female's quality. In guppies (Poecilia reticulata) for instance, females are more likely to copy the mate choice of a larger sized fish than to copy the mate choice of a fish of the same or a smaller size. Besides immediate copying based on visual cues, it has been hypothesized that observer females tend to - later on - choose other males with the same qualities as that of the target male the demonstrator mated with. However, it is not known whether this generalization of preference holds true or the observer's inability to discriminate the target male from other similar-looking males accounts for the behavior. Interestingly, in some instances, an observer female tend to copy a demonstrator's female choice only in the same geographical region (i.e. location) it has observed the demonstrator sexually interact with a target male; if the observer female is presented with the same target male in a different location, there is a less likelihood that the observer would execute the same mate choice. = Olfactory copying = Norway rats employ olfactory cueing to copy the mate choice of experienced females. In some cases, a direct, visual observation of the sexual interaction between the demonstrator and the target is not necessary; female rodents, for instance, use olfactory stimuli as a reference to whether the target male has been chosen by other females or not. A female rodent may choose to mate with a target male if there is a smell of other females associated with this male‚Äôs urine, as an indication that it has been mated with by other fellow females.  Neurobiology  As mentioned earlier, mate choice copying is a developed form of social recognition that requires highly efficient cognitive processes for the observer female to be able to not only identify the demonstrator female and the target male but also execute a suitable behavior (i.e. copying) in response to the observed stimulus. In other words, the execution of mate choice copying is an intricate behavior that most likely involves a coordinated function between the endocrine system, the digestive system, the nervous system, and the reproductive system. In addition to sex hormones, neurotransmitters such as oxytocin (OT) and arginine-vasopressin (AVP) are involved in mediating social recognition of demonstrator and target as well in sexual approach to target males. OT has proven to be of a particular importance to the mediation of mate-choice copying as OT gene-knockout female mice have failed to recognize the demonstrator female and the target male. Moreover, the OT gene-knockout mice have showed a significantly decreased, sexual interest in males even if these males have been previously observed mating with demonstrator females. Such results are likely to be attributed to OT's indispensable role in stimulating sexual arousal and feelings of trust in the female mice; absence of OT has hindered the knockout female mice from trusting the demonstrator female's mating choice, and from experiencing a general sexual attraction to males. Further research has also shown that OT itself is regulated by estrogen and testosterone as a part of the estrous cycles that female mice go through.  Evolutionary origin  = Benefits = Mate-choice copying has evolved to eliminate the possible costs‚Äîincluding time and energy ‚Äîof mate-choice. The fact that mate-choice copying exists in various species is due to the differential abilities of females in choosing a desirable male with good quality genes. In other words, not all females have the same capability of taking good decisions when it comes to mate-choice. Therefore, mate-choice copying as a behavior has evolved through social learning to educate those females‚Äîincluding naive ones‚Äîto choose a desirable male, allowing only good quality genes to be propagated in the population over time . For instance, na√Øve female mice that had just entered the estrus cycle for their first time might choose a male if its urine is associated with the smell of other, older females in the estrus cycle. Therefore, mate-choice copying reduces the error frequency in mate-choice among inexperienced females, guaranteeing an increased relative fitness for the copying females. Another example can be seen in black grouse, Tetrao tetrix, where the naive females in their first breeding season tend to mate later than experienced females so that the former can copy the choice of the latter. Mate-choice copying also becomes effective when the females are constrained by time (i.e. if the breeding season is soon to end) in which case females tend to copy each other's choice to avoid going through the time-consuming choice process that might cost them not being able to mate at all. Mate-choice copying is also effective at eliminating the stress in females of monogamous species such as Gouldian finches (Erythrura gouldiae) that would have otherwise had to mate with a less-desirable, poor- quality male. Another hypothesis that have been also proposed is that Game theory applies to the mate-choice copying behavior where females choose whether to be an observer or a demonstrator based on the abundance of each in the population. A female might tend to become an observer in a population where demonstrators are more abundant to increase its chances of having access to a high-quality male and vice versa. In some instances as in sailfin molly, it is the males of a species that display mate-choice copying. Despite the fact that mate-choice copying, in theory, reduces the relative fitness of those males that are not chosen, it reduces their risks of injury and possible death of the aggressive courtship behaviors that they would have otherwise participated in with the chosen, high-quality males. Some evidence have shown that in species where females display cryptic mate choice, males tend to display the reverse of mate choice copying to avoid mating with females that have been visually observed mating with higher-quality, rival males. Such a mate choice behavior is displayed by a male mainly to avoid wasting its energy in having a sexual interaction that might not necessarily increase its relative fitness if the female chose the sperms of the rival to fertilize its eggs. There are also some instances where the males of a certain species get to be the choosier sex due to their higher parental investment in the offspring than females; an example where males practice mate-choice copying would be sailfin mollies (Poecilia latipinna). = Costs = There has not been various evidence on the fitness costs of mate choice copying; however, it has been suggested that depending solely on social cues to choose a potential mate is not always advantageous. It, in fact, might in some cases lead to mating with an unfit, poor-quality male that has been chosen maladaptively by demonstrator females. Moreover, in species where males display mate-choice copying such as Atlantic mollies (Poecilia mexicana), the demonstrator male might employ what is known as the Deception Hypothesis in which the demonstrator male pretends to mate with an undesirable female to deceive the observer male into choosing this female. Such a deceitful behavior is facilitated by the demonstrator's ability to change its behavior when it senses the presence of the observer as well as the observer's inability to recognize the behavior of the demonstrator as deceitful. Consequently, the observer male mates with an undesirable, poor-quality female, negatively affecting the survival of the observer male's offspring and, in turn, its own relative fitness.  Alternative hypotheses  Researchers have suggested other, alternative hypotheses that might explain as to why females might display nonindependent mate choice; these hypotheses include: Kin-associated genetic preferences, common environmental effects, consexual cueing, and associative learning. = Kin-associated genetic preferences = The proponents of this hypothesis argue that females tend to choose to mate with the same target male due to these females' shared innate preferences for the traits the target male holds. In other words, the genetic similarity of these females due to kinship is reflected in their mate choice behavior that other researchers can view as a mere act of social facilitation. = Common environmental effects = Some females tend to have the same mate choice due to abiotic factors rather than mate-choice copying. For instance, the distribution of food resources might limit the foraging ability of females to explore potential mates in farther regions; therefore, all females in such a confined region might end up mating with the same male because it holds the greatest potential among its rivals and not because it was targeted by demonstrator females. Another influencing biotic factor is predation; females threatened by predation would avoid foraging for a mate and, instead, mate with the male of the best quality traits in their confined region. This best quality male might be in most cases the same male. = Consexual Cueing = In polygamous species such as fallow deer (Dama dama), an outsider female deer (i.e. a female that is not part of the harem) might choose to mate with the harem's dominant male because the female is attracted to being a part of the harem's large group of females rather than being attracted to the dominant male itself. Aside from mate choice copying, being part of a large female group would provide such an outsider female with protection, company, and food resources. = Associative learning = Sometimes, nonindependent mate choice is not a direct copying of an observed mating preference; in fact, it can be the result of an association that the observer female constructs between mating with a target male and receiving a desired award. For instance, in such species where males present the females with a nuptial gift as a prerequisite for mating with the female, observer females are more likely to associate mating with the same target male with the nuptial gift it might receive. Such an association, then, might lead the observer female to mate with the same target male the demonstrator has mated with. Even though there is not a lot of evidence to support this hypothesis, it offers a plausible explanation as to why females of a species might exhibit nonindependent mate choice.

Early life Meyer was born in Salta, Argentina. His father, Hermann Meyer, a Swiss polytechnics engineer specializing in agronomy, became a fazendeiro (large plantation farmer), first in Argentina, in the early 1930s, then in Brazil in 1954. His mother, Anne Camille Blanc de Corbi√®res Meyer, was a Swiss structural engineer. The young Meyer spent his first months in Salta, where his father had established a Hacienda and an olive oil production plant. Because of Peronism, with its nationalism and isolationism, his family lost everything and, in 1954, consequently moved to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In the book Embracing Amazonia published in Brazil, 2008, Eliana Spengler (Giant of Ecology Award coordinator) talks about Meyer's childhood and youth: : \\"‚Ä¶ In his early years, he elected his father's library as his shelter; there he nourished his young mind and imagination reading books by classical Brazilian writers about Amazonian rainforest and √çndios. Later, through encyclopaedias, he developed personal approaches to his numerous questions about the meaning of life ...\\" The stories of Brazilian authors Jose de Alencar, Castro Alves and Machado de Assis fueled Meyer's love of the Amazon, while reading Montaigne's\\" Bon sauvage\\", Rousseau's \\"√âtat de Nature\\" and Locke's concepts of empiricism and \\"tabula rasa\\" directed his thoughts on the nature of human development. Later in life, Meyer experienced an √çndios initiation rite, an experience that sealed his commitment to the Amazonian cause. Career =Early career= Meyer studied medicine, specializing in Developmental Neuropsychology and Child Psychiatry. He went on to teach at the Sorbonne in Paris. His thesis Apprentissage de la langue maternelle √©crite: √©tude sur des populations autochtones dites socio- culturellement d√©favoris√©es dans une approche interdisciplinaire,http://unesdoc.UNESCO.org/images/0006/000678/067843F.pdf Thesis 1985 prefaced by Prof. Dr. Julian de Ajuriaguerra of the Coll√®ge de France, published by UNESCO, examined the problems of underprivileged indigenous populations in learning written language. This work for UNESCO has induced Meyer to study the contribution of western sciences (neuro-psychiatry, neuro-linguistics, neuro-psychology, psycho-motricity, etc.) to the approach of learning disabilities occurring with illiteracy in the developing countries. This official mission led him into the heart of the Amazonian rain- forest for the first time,in ¬ß 3, p. 85, \\"Out of the Forest and into the Labs: Amerindian initiation into sacred science\\", \\"Amazon Up Close\\", New Jersey (USA), Hunter Publishing, 1997, Meyer tells the irrevocable attraction that he felt towards the Rainforest and its inhabitants on his first contact with them: \\"The immense profusion of vegetal, animal and human life ‚Äì as represented by Amaz√¥nia's vast biological diversity ‚Äì exerts an irresistible fascination over everyone who has had the privilege to know it and to live with its indigenous population.\\"; and in ¬ß 5: http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-150675548.html where he undertook an exhaustive case study about the different forms of graphic representations of the written language used by the Amerindians in their pictographs, ideograms, petroglyphs and body paintings (e.g. Genipapo ‚Äì Genipa americana, Urucu ‚Äì Bixa orellana), obtained using plant pigments,Id. ibid.

Meyer evolved from this work to a general effort to promote the value of indigenous ancestral knowledge and to preserve their natural environment (the Amazon).

And they had survived for thousands of years, without any outside support, in one of the most risky and hostile environments, thanks mainly to their deep knowledge of medicinal plants: this enabled them to cure the countless aggression they were submitted to in this habitat.\\", and: in ¬ß 6: (...) The indigenous communities that keep a high level of psycho-cultural preservation have the vocation to be the 'Guardians of Biodiversity' in the context of the Brazilian biodiversity national policy (PNB) and will deserve the title of 'Doctors of Nature'...\\": http://www.pisad.bio.br/artigos/aliancaentreconhecimento.pdf They lead him to combine his expertise in neuro-psychology in the field of linguistic and cultural diversity with his experience in biological diversity and its preservation by bio-technologies. This association allowed him to fight for the transformation of the Amazonian biodiversity and medicinal plants into a truly genuine pharmacology benefiting both Amazonia and the Western world.Meyer makes a detailed review of pharmacological active principles arising from Amazonian biodiversity, and the means to preserve and add value to this precious knowledge and its depositary guardians. For more detailed review, see Note 12 (UNESCO, 2000): http://www.pisad.bio.br/artigos/the_amazon.pdf Thus, from 1992 Prof. Dr. Meyer participated as an official member of the State of Amazonas delegation in the UN Earth Summit Rio 92. It is in this context that, in 1994, he coordinated on Brazilian territory ‚Äì after a due hand-over by the French Ambassador in Bras√≠lia ‚Äì the first Ministerial \\"mission for biotechnology to valorize biodiversity\\" ever to be organized between France and the State of Amazonas.Coordination of the (Video), 1994. This mission, which had been initiated in 1993 by the French Minister of Research and Space Hubert Curien (via the National Program of Bio-technologies, directed by Prof. Dr. Daniel Thomas), was carried out under the auspices of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, with the active involvement of the Governor of the State of Amazonas. The Chief of the Tribe Marubo, Darcy Duarth Comapa, with Prof. Dr. Meyer at the Alto Javari in the Central Amaz√¥nia, discussing Amazonian plants' variety expressed in pictographs In 1994, Meyer appeared as a special delegate from Brazil to the UNESCO's World Symposium on Literacy in order to present his new approach merging linguistic abilities and biodiversity know how. In 1999, Dr. Meyer was appointed by UNESCO to write a report on the means to consider in order to establish a \\"bridge of equitable communication and cooperation\\" between the Amazonian Amerindians and their traditional knowledge, on the one hand, and the Western world and its modern Culture, on the other hand. The bottom line was to set up the appropriate tools and create the necessary procedures for such a cooperation to be made possible, taking into account the specificity of cultural diversity, the way both these cultures function, and the pragmatic instruments of cooperation.\\"Amerindian Communication and Sustainable Economic Development Programme for a Culture of Peace in Brazilian Amaz√¥nia\\", Tome I, Report of Activities and Evaluation, Paris, UNESCO Programme of Participation, 2000‚Äì2003, 250 p. Since then, he has gone on to found PISAD: Programme International de Sauvegarde de l'Amaz√¥nia, Mata Atl√¢ntica et des Am√©rindiens pour le D√©veloppement Durable [International Program to Safeguard Amazonia, the Mata Atl√¢ntica and the Amerindians for Sustainable Development], a humanist and non-profit organization. To implement it, he has created a \\"platform of fair and equitable dialogue ‚Äì a bridge ‚Äì between preserved √çndios and western scientists\\" to valorize the ancestral knowledge of the √çndios and the Amazonian biodiversity. Originally, Meyer set up an operational concept and methodology regarding the psycho-cultural revitalization of endangered Amerindian knowledge which he had pioneered as Cogni'√çndios. =Recent work= Meyer is currently adapting a process for the bio-production of active ingredients contained in medicinal plants to the needs and abilities of the √çndios, enabling them to manage the production of these pharmaceuticals and ensuring them economic autonomy and self-sustainable development. This bio-production is based upon the alliance between the √çndios' know-how and a green biotechnology (Plant Milking Technology) developed by INPL ‚Äì Institut National Polytechnique de Lorraine (National Polytechnic Institute of Lorraine), France.in ¬ß 15, , published in Ambiente en Foco, 13 November 2006, Meyer asserts that the proof comes through their innovative biotechnology, which \\"‚Ä¶ is called PAT (Plantes √† Traire = Plant Milking Technology). Thus, for the first time in the history, we created a 'practical procedure', which allows the Industrialists and the Forest Communities to speak the same language, and to have the same objectives: to produce economic and social results, while preserving Nature‚Ä¶\\" UNESCO's Participation Programme entitled \\"Amerindian Communication and Sustainable Economic Development Programme for a Culture of Peace in Brazilian Amazonia\\" (00 BRA 603), which Meyer managed from 1999 to 2003, has been a central element of his work and a starting point for his further action. In the last years, Meyer has been concentrating his activities on the first transfer of the \\"plant milking technology\\" to an √çndioscommunity in the virgin rain- forest: this is a unique example in recent history of an actual biotechnology transfer to Amerindians.In ¬ß¬ß 2‚Äì3, p. 18, , published in the Trade Magazine of the Trading and Industrial Association of Paran√° State (Associa√ß√£o Comercial e Industrial do Paran√°), Year 12, n¬∞ 119, May 2008, the Editor writes: (...) \\"Professor Meyer ‚Ä¶ was the creator of the first case in human history of a biotechnology transfer to the indigenous population (...), in Amaz√¥nia, the largest biological reserve on Earth, and the remaining 12% of the Atlantic Rainforest. (‚Ä¶) He underlines that about 10% of the 350,000 √çndios in the Country still live with no contact with white men, in perfect harmony with Nature, and are capable of already using (in an empiric way) an advanced technology similar to the one that is being proposed to create the bio- products. According to an inventory that Dr. Meyer has prepared for UNESCO, beyond these 10% of preserved √çndios, there are 100,000 more Indians having occasional contacts with the whites, who keep a preserved knowledge of Nature resources, and who could cooperate equitably with modern technologies.\\" He is now focusing his work on the goal-achievement methodology of his original research and development program to ensure a functional and active link between the√çndios ancestral knowledge and Scientist's advanced biotechnology.In ¬ß 1, p. 29, , published in 2007 in the magazine E.F√™nix, Year One, N¬∞ 1, Dr. Meyer says: (...) We concluded more than 20 years ago that creating an innovating and revolutionary alliance between traditional knowledge and biotechnologies would be the most sustainable way to preserve these unique assets of the Planet, while offering the native populations of the Forest a dignifying way of life. The former encompasses the ancestral knowledge of the forest's genetic resources initially acquired via empirical methods in situ. The latter is the ideal instrument available to our modern world in order to valorize biodiversity. A new model for concluding such an alliance exists today; it is our responsibility to take full advantage of it.\\" : http://www.pisad.bio.br/artigos/principe-das-florestas.pdf Health, environmental, social and media impacts For more than three decades, Meyer's work has been published by leading international scientific journals, magazines and books, as well as progressively in the mainstream press, as can be seen in \\"Selected Publications\\", up to recent articles.

It is located northwest of Willmar, Minnesota. It was closed in 1961. History Willmar Air Force Station was initially part of Phase II of the Air Defense Command Mobile Radar program. The Air Force approved this expansion of the Mobile Radar program on October 23, 1952. Radars in this network were designated ‚ÄúSM.‚Äù The station became operational on 1 July 1956 when the 721st Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was moved to the station by the 31st Air Division. This site became operational in 1957 with the 721st AC&W; Squadron operating a variety of radars including AN/FPS-6, AN/FPS-8, AN/MPS-7, and AN/FPS-3 sets, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. During 1959 Willmar AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, initially feeding data to DC-11 at Grand Forks AFB, North Dakota. After joining, the squadron was re-designated as the 721st Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 15 January 1960. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. The station closed on 1 June 1961 due to budgetary constraints. Today the former Willmar Air Force Station is now Willmar Technical College. Mostly rebuilt, some USAF buildings remain.

The original lineup was completed with lead guitarist/vocalist Stavros Amanatidis and bassist Thodoris Nikolaou. They have appeared in several live stages throughout Greece and supported many famous artists such as ZZ Top and Pavlov's Dog.Some of their main influences are the Beatles, John Lennon, U2, Queen, and Elvis Presley. The first album of The Skelters is entitled ‚ÄúExplain To Me‚Äù and was released in 2009. History From a very young age, Angel Charavitsidis and his younger brother Daniel developed an interest for classic Rock ‚Äòn Roll music which ultimately resulted in the original band The Crickets in 1996. The name was later on changed to The Skelters, because The Crickets was already used as a band‚Äôs name (Buddy Holly and the Crickets). The name Skelters was an idea coming from the original Beatles song \\"Helter Skelter\\" which has been the main influence of the band since its formation. Up until 2003, the lineup has changed several times, yet always consisting of Angel and Daniel. The lead guitarist and vocalist Stavros Amanatidis joined the band in 2001, while the bassist Thodoris Nikolaou in 2004. Immediately after its formation, the band started appearing live locally counting more than 1000 appearances all over Greece to date. They have appeared in the most important live stages in Thessaloniki and Athens, festivals, TV and radio shows. Also, they were the support act for other artists such as ZZ Top, Nazareth, Iron Butterfly, Pavlov's Dog, Steve Harley and Cockney Rebel, Louisiana Red, helping the band to gain more recognition and fame. Also, the band is known for its legendary tributes to artists like The Beatles, John Lennon, Queen, Elvis Presley and U2, which have been the main influence of the band since its formation. First public appearance (1998‚Äì1999) Their first public appearance was in May 1998 at the elementary school of Tagarades. In February 1999 the band appeared for the first time in a TV show Jammin in National Television. The Crickets, as they were called at the time, was the youngest band who ever appeared in that particular show! When they appeared for the second time on that show, in May of the same year, Stavros Amanatidis, the third member of The Skelters was on the guitar. Development In the period of 1998-2000, the band had already composed three original songs. From 2001, the band‚Äôs performances became more often and they began to appear in important live stages such as Mesogeios Live Stage and Caf√© Americain supporting the well established group Blues Wire. In March 2002 they appeared at a concert in the Cultural Center of Thermi, where they performed their original songs live. In November of that year they recorded for the first time one of their songs, \\"Let‚Äôs Go Party.\\" In December they recorded another one of their songs \\"See How Much I Love You.\\" In July 2003, they recorded \\"Now Is The Chance\\" and in September \\"It's a Pity.\\" In January 2004, the fourth member, Thodoris Nikolaou, bassist, officially joined the band. The same month, the band paid a great tribute to Elvis Presley with a very special gig at Mylos live Stage in Thessaloniki. In February, they recorded \\"She Is a Liar.\\" In April to May 2005, they supported Blues Wire once again in their appearances at Caf√© Americain. In early 2006, they put on another tribute to Elvis Presley, as well as a series of tribute nights to The Beatles at Mylos Club in Thessaloniki. In November, the band paid tribute to Queen and the late Freddie Mercury, performing numerous songs of their discography. In December, another live tribute for John Lennon was done. In 2007, they continued to perform live tributes, that time to U2 and The Beatles, while making appearances throughout Greece. The appearance supporting Louisiana Red and Blues Wire at Mylos Club in Thessaloniki was a great success. In 2008 The Skelters performed live their song \\"Let's Go Party\\" on a very popular Greek TV show, Radio Arvyla. That year, they also supported Iron Butterfly on a concert in Thessaloniki and jammed with Puressence. Moreover, they supported Paul Di' Anno on a concert in Thessaloniki Port. On 25 May 2009, the band released its first album, Explain to Me, distributed by Pan Vox. In the summer of 2009 they performed at the popular river party in Nestorius, at the city of Kastoria. On October 24, they were chosen to be the opening act for the ZZ Top concert in Athens, where they performed in front of a 10,000 people audience. On 22 December 2009 they reappeared at the popular TV show RadioArvyla where they performed their song \\"She Is a Liar.\\" On 30 December they did a very special one-time tribute Elvis Presley vs Beatles at Mylos Club. A music video for \\"See How Much I Love You\\" was released on June 18 2010. On 10 November 2010, they were chosen as the opening act for Pavlov's Dog concert in Thessaloniki. Also, on December 8, 2010 the Skelters paid tribute to John Lennon, 30 years after his assassination, with a concert at Mylos Club in Thessaloniki.

History and analysis of songs Each song on the first album of the Skelters, Explain to Me, has its own history and all the songs were written in different periods. The lyrics of the songs are mostly inspired by everyday life and real events experienced by members of the band. Because of the many musical influences of Skelters, each song has its own style. \\"Let's Go Party\\" is a pure rock n 'roll song with uplifting mood, influenced by the Beatles, Little Richard, Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin and Kiss. The music is written by Angel, but the lyrics are from the Angel, Daniel and Stavros. \\"My Life Has Changed\\" is a love ballad and is closer to the style of John Lennon, George Harrison and Queen. The music was composed by Angel and Stavros, while the lyrics were written by Daniel. \\"See How Much I Love You,\\" which was also converted to a video clip, is a rock ballad. The lyrics and music were written by Angel and the song is a stylish mix of Beatles, U2 and Bon Jovi. \\"Explain to Me\\" is dedicated to the greatest musical influence of the band, John Lennon, and speaks of world peace and love. Lyrics and music were written by Angel in 1998. \\"Now Is the Chance\\" is a classic rock song. The music was composed by Angel, while the lyrics were written by Daniel and Stavros. \\"She Is a Liar\\" is a dance funk rock track, influenced by the Beatles, U2, Queen, and generally from the 80s music style. Music and lyrics were written by Angel and Daniel. \\"It's a Pity\\" is a blues rock song, with lyrics from Daniel, speaks of the broken hearted men from women. influences of the song are the Beatles, Gary Moore and Led Zeppelin. \\"Corruption\\" is a hard rock song talking about corruption in the world. The music is composed by Angel and the lyrics were written by Daniel and Stavros. \\"Journey\\" is an instrumental blues, rock, funk song, with influences from Blues Wire and Stevie Ray Vaughan. In conclusion, the nine songs of the album vary musically and each one has its own \\"music personality\\" and story. Influences The main and fundamental influence of the Skelters are the Beatles. John Lennon was Angel's strongest \\"model\\" and was the reason for the creation of the Skelters. Large influence on the Skelters are Queen, U2, Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones, Elvis Presley, Bruce Springsteen, Little Richard, Oasis and Bon Jovi. However, the Skelters have some secondary, but equally important influences. Each one plays its role in the musical interests of the members. So big names such as Aerosmith, Deep Purple, Bob Dylan, Guns n 'Roses, Pink Floyd, Black Sabbath, Doors, Chuck Berry, Roy Orbison, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Eric Clapton, Johnny Cash, David Bowie and T-Rex are added to the musical sounds and musical preferences of the Skelters. Finally, 60s, 70s, 80s and some other kinds of music, for example, blues, folk, glam, disco, funk, progressive, alternative etc., complete their musical influences.

Trew also maintains numerous other private companies, though in 2019 his application for a gangmaster's license was turned down on the grounds that his previous business conduct was not 'fit and proper'. Lincoln City On 5 August 2003, Trew became an Associate Director at Lincoln City becoming a full director at the end of the month. In August 2005 he was appointed Chairman of Football with Steff Wright succeeding Rob Bradley as Chairman of the Board. He departed in January 2006 after a boardroom dispute which saw manager Keith Alexander placed on gardening leave, then re-instated. In April three of Trew's companies then terminated their sponsorship deals with the club. A subsequent bid to buy the club and provide substantial investment was blocked by the Lincoln City board, with chairman Steff Wright publicly questioning Trew's motives. Lincoln Ladies In 2006 Trew joined the committee of Lincoln City Ladies. In addition to an ¬£8,000-per-season sponsorship through his SportsTV company, Trew provided additional backing of up to ¬£10,000 to aid the club's promotion bid. In 2008 the club changed its name to OOH Lincoln Ladies, due to a sponsorship deal with Trew's Out Of Home marketing company. Trew also backed the club's successful FA WSL application, but in 2014 Trew controversially moved the club to Nottingham and rebranded it Notts County Ladies. Notts County Trew purchased Notts County for ¬£1 in February 2010 following the departure of Qadbak Investments. He inherited liabilities of ¬£7m from the former owners. On 25 February 2016, Trew stepped down as chairman of Notts County and announced that the club was for sale,http://www.nottinghampost.com/Ray-Trew-steps- chairman-Notts-County-puts-club/story-28807809-detail/story.html but on 10 September 2016, Trew announced he had reinstated himself as chairman of Notts County. On 12 January 2017, Trew sold the club to local businessman Alan Hardy, but one of Trew's companies named Pinnacle Advantage was owed a substantial sum of money by the club. This threatened to force the club into liquidation until an agreement was reached in May 2017. Nottingham Rugby Club In July 2010 Trew took control of Nottingham Rugby Club, via Meadow Lane plc. On 28 September 2011 Trew relinquished his interest in Nottingham Rugby Club.http://www.nottscountyfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10426~2465421,00.html References Category:English football chairmen and investors Category:English businesspeople Category:People from Lincolnshire Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Ray Trew"},{"id":"30525409","text":"Robert Lewis Jones (October 12, 1925 ‚Äì April 2, 1996), known as both Guitar Gabriel and Nyles Jones, was an American blues musician. Gabriel's unique style of guitar playing, which he referred to as \\"Toot Blues\\", combined Piedmont, Chicago, and Texas blues, as well as gospel, and was influenced by artists such as Blind Boy Fuller and Reverend Gary Davis. After hearing of Guitar Gabriel from the late Greensboro, North Carolina blues guitarist and pianist, James \\"Guitar Slim\\" Stephens, musician and folklorist Tim Duffy located and befriended Gabriel, who was the inspiration for the creation of the Music Maker Relief Foundation. Gabriel wore a trademark white sheepskin hat, which he acquired while traveling and performing with Medicine Shows during his late 20s. Biography Gabriel was born in Decatur, Georgia, moving to Winston-Salem, North Carolina at age five. His father, Sonny Jones (also known as Jack Jones, James Johnson, and as Razorblade for an act in which he ate razor blades, mason jars, and light bulbs) recorded for Vocalion Records in 1939 in Memphis, accompanied by Sonny Terry and Oh Red (George Washington). Sonny Jones also recorded a single for the Orchid label in Baltimore in 1950 (as Sunny Jones). His family, who grew up sharecropping, shared a talent for music. His great-grandmother, an ex-slave, called set dances and played the banjo; his grandfather played banjo and his grandmother the pump organ; his father and uncle were blues guitarists and singers and his sisters sang blues and gospel. In 1935, Gabriel's family moved to Durham, North Carolina, where he began playing guitar on the streets. Between the ages of 15 and 25, Gabriel traveled the country playing the guitar in medicine shows. During his travels, he performed with artists such as Bo Diddley, Lightnin' Hopkins, Louis Jordan, Chuck Berry, Muddy Waters, B. B. King, T-Bone Walker and Jimmy Reed. In 1970, Gabriel went to Pittsburgh and recorded a single, \\"Welfare Blues,\\" as well as an album, My South, My Blues, with the Gemini label under the name \\"Nyles\\" Jones. The 45 became a hit in Pittsburgh and Cleveland and though the album sold well, Gabriel never saw any royalties. Disillusioned and embittered by the music business, Gabriel returned home to Winston-Salem where he continued playing music, but expressly for his community, at churches, homes, clubs, \\"drink houses,\\" and even at bus stops when children were returning home from school. The album, My South, My Blues was reissued in 1988, on the 'Jambalaya' label (a Flyright subsidiary), as Nyles Jones, the Welfare Blues. In March 1990, musician and folklorist Tim Duffy began searching for Guitar Gabriel. After being directed to a drink house in Winston-Salem, Duffy met Gabriel's nephew, Hawkeye, who took him to meet Gabriel. Duffy and Gabriel forged a friendship, and began performing under the name Guitar Gabriel & Brothers in the Kitchen, later recording the album, which was released on cassette, Do You Know What it Means to Have a Friend? on their own Karibu label. During this time, Duffy would assist the impoverished Gabriel by providing transportation, paying bills, and providing food for him and his wife, but realized that there were many more musicians like Gabriel who were in need of the same assistance, and who were still capable and willing to record and perform. In 1994, Tim and his wife, Denise Duffy founded the Music Maker Relief Foundation. Through this foundation, Gabriel was able to perform in professional venues, including the Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall, and made several trips to Europe. Gabriel died on April 2, 1996, and is buried with his guitar (per his request to Duffy) at the Evergreen Cemetery in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.Premier Guitar Discography =Albums= *My South, My Blues as Nyles Jones (Gemini, 1970) ‚Äì LP *The Welfare Blues (Jambalaya reissue of My South, My Blues, 1988) ‚Äì LP *Do You Know What it Means to Have a Friend? as Guitar Gabriel & Brothers in the Kitchen (Karibu, 1991) ‚Äì Cassette *Deep in the South Guitar Gabriel (Music Maker, 1992) ‚Äì CD *Guitar Gabriel: Volume 1 Guitar Gabriel (Music Maker, 1995) ‚Äì CD *The Blue Box of Blues as Nyles Jones (Millennia, 2003) ‚Äì CD *Guitar Gabriel: The Beginning of the Music Maker Story Guitar Gabriel (Dixiefrog Records) ‚Äì CD/DVD =Singles= *\\"The Welfare Blues\\" / \\"Your Poodle Dog\\" as Nyles Jones (Gemini, 1970) ‚Äì 45 References External links * Music Maker Label Page * Complete Discography Category:1925 births Category:1996 deaths Category:Musicians from Winston-Salem, North Carolina Category:African- American guitarists Category:American blues singers Category:American blues singer-songwriters Category:Country blues singers Category:American blues guitarists Category:American male guitarists Category:American gospel singers Category:Vocalion Records artists Category:20th-century American singers Category:20th-century American guitarists Category:Songwriters from North Carolina Category:Guitarists from North Carolina Category:20th-century American male musicians ","title":"Guitar Gabriel"},{"id":"30525420","text":"Richard Nunns (born 1945) is a MƒÅori traditional instrumentalist of PƒÅkehƒÅ heritage.

Professional life Richard Nunns playing a flute For many years, he performed with Hirini Melbourne (1949‚Äì2003), playing traditional MƒÅori instruments. Together, they researched these instruments, which had not been played for over a century, as their use went out of tradition in the 1900s. For many of the instruments, which were still on display in museums, it wasn't even known what technique was used to play them. They are credited with reviving this part of MƒÅori culture. Since Melbourne's death, he is regarded as the world's foremost authority on MƒÅori instruments. Nunns co-led the musicians at a dawn ceremony on opening day of Te Papa in 1998. He has made recordings with musicians covering a wide variety of styles, including Moana and the Moahunters, the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, the New Zealand String Quartet, King Kapisi, and Salmonella Dub.

It started when Seleucus I Nicator, of the Seleucid Empire, sought to retake the Indian satrapies of the Macedonian Empire which had been occupied by Emperor Chandragupta Maurya, of the Maurya Empire. The war ended in a settlement resulting in the annexation of the Indus Valley region and part of Afghanistan to the Mauryan Empire, with Chandragupta securing control over the areas that he had sought, and a marriage alliance between the two powers. After the war, the Mauryan Empire emerged as the dominant power of the Indian Subcontinent, and the Seleucid Empire turned its attention toward defeating its rivals in the west.  Background  Territorial evolution of Magadha and the Maurya Empire between 600 and 180 BCE, including territorial gains from Seleucid- Mauryan War, 303 BCE. Chandragupta Maurya established himself as ruler of Magadha around 321 BCE. He decided to conquer the Nanda Dynasty, rulers at the time of the Gangetic Plain. He fought the empire for eleven years with successful guerrilla campaigns, and captured the Nanda capital of Pataliputra. This led to the fall of the empire and the eventual creation of the Maurya Empire under Emperor Chandragupta Maurya. The Persian provinces in what is now modern Afghanistan, together with the wealthy kingdom of Gandhara and the states of the Indus Valley, had all submitted to Alexander the Great and become part of his empire. When Alexander died, the Wars of the Diadochi (\\"Successors\\") split his empire apart; as his generals fought for control of Alexander's empire. In the eastern territories one of these generals, Seleucus I Nicator, was taking control and was starting to establish what became known as the Seleucid Empire. According to the Roman historian Appian, Seleucus, Alexander had appointed satraps in control of his territories. Similarly satraps were appointed to govern the Indus Valley. The Mauryans had annexed the areas governed by four such satraps: Nicanor, Phillip, Eudemus and Peithon. This established Mauryan control to the banks of the Indus. Chandragupta's victories convinced Seleucus that he needed to secure his eastern flank. Seeking to hold the Macedonian territories there, Seleucus thus came into conflict with the emerging and expanding Mauryan Empire over the Indus Valley.  War  Details of the conflict are lacking. Per Appian, It is unknown if there was in fact a pitched battle. Military historian John D. Grainger has argued that Seleucus, upon crossing the Indus, \\"would find himself in a trap, with a large river at his back and a hostile continent before him,\\" and consequently could not have advanced much farther than the Indus. According to Grainger, the details of the conflict are unclear, but the outcome clearly must have been \\"a decisive Indian victory,\\" with Chandragupta driving back Seleucus' forces as far as the Hindu Kush and consequently gaining large territories in modern-day Afghanistan. According to Wheatley and Heckel, the level of friendly Maurya-Seleucid relations established after the war imply that the hostilities were probably \\"neither prolonged nor grievous\\".  Consequences  Seleucus Nicator ceded the Hindu Kush, Punjab and parts of Afghanistan to Chandragupta Maurya.[R.G. Grant: Commanders pg. 49 https://books.google.com/books?id=tFQcwH2StsMC&q;=chandragupta#v=snippet&q;=chandragupta&f;=false] In consequence of their arrangement, Seleucus received 500 war elephants from Chandragupta Maurya, which subsequently influenced the Wars of the Diadochi in the west. Seleucus and Chandragupta also agreed to a marriage alliance, probably the marriage of Seleucus' daughter to Chandragupta. The arrangement proved to be mutually beneficial. The border between the Seleucid and Mauryan Empires remained stable in subsequent generations, and friendly diplomatic relations are reflected by the ambassador Megasthenes, and by the envoys sent westward by Chandragupta's grandson Ashoka. Chandragupta's gift of war elephants \\"may have alleviated the burden of fodder and the return march\\" and allowed him to appropriately reduce the size and cost of his large army, since the major threats to his power had now all been removed. With the war elephants acquired from the Mauryas, Seleucus was able to defeat his rival, Antigonus, along with his allies at the Battle of Ipsus. Adding Antigonus's territories to his own, Seleucus would found the Seleucid Empire, which would endure as a great power in the Mediterranean and the Middle East until 64 BCE. Mauryan control of territory in Afghanistan helped guard against invasion of India from the northwest. Chandragupta Maurya went on to expand his rule in India southward into the Deccan.

But the Synod of Milan here alluded to is placed about the year 345, soon after the Synod of Sardica. St. Maximinus was at this synod.  Synod of 355  Ruins of the Basilica Maior where was held the 355 synod Lucifer of Cagliari was deputed by Pope Liberius, with the priest Pancratius and the deacon Hilary, to request the Emperor Constantius to convene a council, to deal with the accusations directed against St. Athanasius and his previous condemnation. This council was convened at Milan in the newly erected Basilica Nova (or Basilica Maior or St. Tecla). The council however did not follow the hopes of the Pope due to the overwhelming number of Arians bishops and the initial forced absence of the champion of the Nicaean faith, Eusebius of Vercelli. Lucifer there defended the Bishop of Alexandria (Athanasius) with much passion and in very violent language, thus furnishing the adversaries of the great Alexandrian with a pretext for resentment and further violence, and causing a new condemnation of Athanasius. The bishop of Milan Dionysius initially seemed ready to follow the Arians in condemning Athanasius, accused not of heresy but of lese-majesty against the Emperor. With the arrival of Eusebius the situation changed: Eusebius requested an immediate subscription of the Nicaean faith by the bishops. Eusebius, Lucifer and Dionysius signed, but the Arian bishop Valens of Mursia violently shredded the act of faith. Constantius, unaccustomed to independence on the part of the bishops, moved the synod to his palace and grievously maltreated the papal embassy. Hilary was flogged and the exiled along with Pancratius and the two Nicaean bishops. The synod, now governed by the Arian bishops of the court of Constantius, ended supporting Arian statements.  Synod of 389  Augustine's \\"On the Good of Marriage\\" was written against somewhat that still remained of the heresy of Jovinian. He mentions this error in b. ii. c. 23, de Nuptiis et Conc. Jovinianus, he says, who a few years since tried to found a new heresy, said that the Catholics favored the Manich√¶ans, because in opposition to him they preferred holy Virginity to Marriage. \\"That heresy took its rise from one Jovinianus, a monk, in our own time, when we were yet young\\". And he adds that it was soon overborne and extinguished, say about A.D. 390, having been condemned first at Rome, then at Milan. There are letters of Pope Siricius on the subject to the Church of Milan, and the answer sent him by the Synod of Milan, at which St. Ambrose presided. Jerome had refuted Jovinian, but was said to have attempted the defense of the excellency of the virgin state, at the expense of condemning marriage. St. Maximus of Turin was at a \\"synod of Milan\\" in 389 at which Jovinianus was condemned, according to his ninth homily. Synod of 451 In 451, St. Maximus of Turin was again at a synod in Milan where the bishops of Northern Italy accepted the celebrated letter (epistola dogmatica) of Pope Leo I, setting forth the orthodox doctrine of the Incarnation against the Nestorians and Eutychians. Among nineteen subscribers Maximus is the eighth, and since the order was determined by age, Maximus must then have been about seventy years old.  Synod of 860  A synod that took place in Milan in 860 summoned Ingiltrud, wife of Boso, to appear before it because she had left her husband for a paramour. Pope Nicholas I commanded the bishops in the dominions of Charles the Bald to excommunicate her unless she returned to her husband. As she paid no attention to the summons, she was put under the ban.

It is located north- northeast of Wadena, Minnesota. It was closed in 1970. History In late 1951 Air Defense Command selected Finland, Minnesota site as one of twenty- eight radar stations built as part of the second segment of the permanent radar surveillance network. Prompted by the start of the Korean War, on July 11, 1950, the Secretary of the Air Force asked the Secretary of Defense for approval to expedite construction of the second segment of the permanent network. Receiving the Defense Secretary's approval on July 21, the Air Force directed the Corps of Engineers to proceed with construction. Wadena Air Force Station began at Leaf River, Minnesota when the Minnesota Air National Guard 132d Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was federalized during the Korean War and began operations on 1 June 1951 under the 543d Aircraft Control and Warning Group; initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. The Guardsmen operated AN/FPS-3 and AN/FPS-4 radars until relieved from active duty and returned to control of the State of Minnesota on 1 February 1953. The 739th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron began the radars in June 1952, the site being re-designated as Wadena AFS on 1 December 1953. The AN/FPS-4 unit was superseded in 1956 by an AN/FPS-6 height-finder radar. In 1958 this site was operating an AN/FPS-20 radar. During 1959 Wadena AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, initially feeding data to DC-11 at Grand Forks AFB, North Dakota. After joining, the squadron was re-designated as the 739th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 15 January 1960. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. In 1963, Wadena was switched to the SAGE DC-10 Data Center at Duluth AFS, Minnesota. 1959 also saw the arrival of a second height-finder radar (AN/FPS-6A). In 1961 the search radar was upgraded and redesignated as an AN/FPS-64. During 1963 the AN/FPS-6A height- finder radar was modified to an AN/FPS-90, and on 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-17. In 1967 the search radar was upgraded to an AN/FPS-64A. The AN/FPS-90 was removed in 1969. In addition to the main facility, Wadena operated the following AN/FPS-18 Gap Filler sites: * Elbow Lake, MN (P-17A) * Bagley, MN (P-17B) Over the years, the equipment at the station was upgraded or modified to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information gathered by the radars. The Air Force inactivated the 739th Radar Squadron (SAGE) in September 1970 due to budget reductions. Today, the former Wadena Air Force Station is now the Bell Hill Recovery Center. Many former USAF buildings in-use.

Some laws arose from concerns that literate slaves could forge the documents required to escape to a free state. According to William M. Banks, \\"Many slaves who learned to write did indeed achieve freedom by this method. The wanted posters for runaways often mentioned whether the escapee could write.\\" Anti-literacy laws also arose from fears of slave insurrection, particularly around the time of abolitionist David Walker's 1829 publication of Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World, which openly advocated rebellion,Paul Finkelman, Encyclopedia of African American History, 1619‚Äì1895: From the Colonial Period to the Age of Frederick Douglass, Oxford University Press, USA, Apr 6, 2006, p. 445 and Nat Turner's slave rebellion of 1831. The United States is the only country known to have had anti-literacy laws. State anti- literacy laws Between 1740 and 1834 Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North and South Carolina, and Virginia all passed anti-literacy laws. South Carolina prohibited teaching slaves to read and write, punishable by a fine of 100 pounds and six months in prison, via an amendment to its 1739 Negro Act. A website titled \\"Fight Municipal Court Abuse (court.rchp.com) includes the following in its list of significant anti-black laws: * 1847, Missouri: Prohibited assembling or teaching slaves to read or write * 1829, Georgia: Prohibited teaching blacks to read, punished by fine and imprisonment * 1832, Alabama and Virginia: Prohibited whites from teaching blacks to read or write, punished by fines and floggings * 1833, Georgia: Prohibited blacks from working in reading or writing jobs (via an employment law), and prohibited teaching blacks, punished by fines and whippings (via an anti- literacy law) * 1847, Missouri: Prohibited teaching blacks to read or write A 19th-century Virginia law specified: \\"[E]very assemblage of negroes for the purpose of instruction in reading or writing, or in the night time for any purpose, shall be an unlawful assembly. Any justice may issue his warrant to any office or other person, requiring him to enter any place where such assemblage may be, and seize any negro therein; and he, or any other justice, may order such negro to be punished with stripes.\\" In North Carolina, black people who disobeyed the law were sentenced to whipping while whites received a fine and/or jail time.North Carolina Digital History, http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/nchist-newnation/4384 Restrictions on the education of black students were not limited to the South. While teaching blacks in the North was not illegal, many Northern states, counties, and cities barred black students from public schools. What few schools there were for black students were projects funded by donations from Quakers and other philanthropists. The attempt in 1831 to open a college for black students in New Haven was met with such overwhelming local resistance that the project was almost immediately abandoned (see Simeon Jocelyn). Private schools in New Hampshire and Connecticut that attempted to educate black and white students together were destroyed by mobs (see Noyes Academy and Canterbury Female Boarding School). Resistance Educators in the South found ways to both circumvent and challenge the law. John Berry Meachum, for example, moved his school out of St. Louis, Missouri when that state passed an anti-literacy law in 1847, and re-established it as the Floating Freedom School on a steamship on the Mississippi River, which was beyond the reach of Missouri state law.Robert W.Tabscott John Berry Meachum Defied The Law to Educate Blacks, St. Louis Beacon, August 25, 2009 After she was arrested, tried, and served a month in prison for educating free black children in Norfolk, Virginia, Margaret Crittendon Douglas wrote a book on her experiences, which helped draw national attention to the anti-literacy laws.Douglass, Margaret, Educational Laws of Virginia: The Personal Narrative of Mrs. Margaret Douglass, a Southern Woman Who Was Imprisoned for One Month in the Common Jail of Norfolk, John P. Jewett and Co., 1854 In some cases, slaveholders ignored the laws. They looked the other way when their children played school and taught their slave playmates how to read and write. Some slaveholders saw the economic benefit in having literate slaves who could undertake business transactions and keep accounts. Others believed that slaves should be sufficiently literate to read the Bible.

For solid waste policy to be effective, inputs should come from stakeholders, including citizens, businesses, community based-organizations, non governmental organizations, government agencies, universities, and other research organizations. These inputs form the basis of policy frameworks that influence solid waste management decisions. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates household, industrial, manufacturing, and commercial solid and hazardous wastes under the 1976 Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Effective solid waste management is a cooperative effort involving federal, state, regional, and local entities. Thus, the RCRA's Solid Waste program section D encourages the environmental departments of each state to develop comprehensive plans to manage nonhazardous industrial and municipal solid waste. Solid waste Solid Waste Tree, Based on Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, United States Environmental Protection Agency Solid waste means any garbage or refuse, sludge from a wastewater treatment plant, water supply treatment plant, or an air pollution control facility and other discarded material, including solid, liquid, semi-solid, or contained gaseous material resulting from industrial, commercial, mining, and agricultural operations, and from community activities. Solid waste does not include solid or dissolved materials in domestic sewage, solid or dissolved materials in irrigation return flows, or industrial discharges. The large scope of the term \\"solid waste\\" means that it must be managed in a variety of different ways and that various levels of government employ different policy instruments in order to accomplish this task. Generally, the term \\"solid waste\\" refers to non- hazardous waste, though according to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and other state regulations, \\"hazardous waste\\" is also a part of solid waste. =Non-hazardous solid wastes= Municipal Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), commonly known as trash or garbage, includes all everyday thrown away items from households, commercial and institutional entities, horticulture, and road sweeping. This includes items such as packaging, paper, cardboard, food scraps, plastic bags & containers, glass bottles, grass clippings, furniture, tires, electrical & electronic items, and metals. In 2009, United States residents generated 243 million tons of trash, down from 255 million tons in 2007. In the same period, the per capita generation of MSW lowered to 4.34 lbs/person/day from 4.63 lbs/person/day. US EPA MSW 2009 facts and figures Agricultural and animal Agricultural wastes include primary crop residues that remain in fields after harvest and secondary processing residues generated from the harvested portions of crops during food, feed, and fiber production. This is generated during the production and distribution through decomposition of food, vegetables, or meat, removal of non-usable parts, removal of substandard products, and spoiling due to substandard packaging. Thus agricultural waste is generated at all stages of food system including farming, storage, processing, and wholesaling. The food scraps generated by retailers and consumers are not included in this category as these scraps enter the waste stream as municipal solid waste. Animal wastes are wastes generated from farms and feedlots, also known as Animal Feeding Operations (AFOs) or Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs), consisting of leftover feeds, manure and urine, wastewater, dead animals, and production operation wastes. They produce large amounts of waste in small areas. For example, EPA reports that a single dairy cow produces approximately 120 pounds of wet manure per day equaling to that of 20-40 people. The main problems of animal waste mismanagement are environmental, especially water pollution. Industrial Industrial waste consists of a significant amount of solid waste. EPA reported that each year United States industrial facilities generate and dispose of approximately 7.6 billion tons of industrial solid waste based on 1980s figures. This figure includes waste generated from 17 industrial manufacturers of organic chemicals, inorganic chemicals, iron and steel, plastics and resins, stone, clay, glass, concrete, pulp and paper, food, and kindred products. Industrial waste does not go into the municipal solid waste stream and therefore is landfilled or processed separately. As per EPA guidelines industrial waste management units have to consider waste characterization and minimization methods, waste constituent information factsheets, risk assessment tools, institutional mechanism/stakeholder partnership principles, safe and proper design guidelines, water (surface and ground) and air monitoring procedures, and facility pre- and post-closure recommendations. Construction and demolition C&D; waste includes debris generated during the construction, renovation, and demolition of buildings, roads, and bridges. This can be often bulky and heavy building materials consisting of concrete, building wood waste, asphalt from roads and roof shingles, drywall gypsum, metals, bricks, blocks, glass, plastics, building components like doors, windows, and fixtures, and trees, stumps, earth, and rock from construction and clearing sites. Since this often consists of bulky and heavy materials, proper waste management can improve resources. EPA estimated that 136 million tons of building-related C&D; waste was generated in the United States in 1996. Treatment Treatment waste consists of sludge, byproducts, coproducts, or metal scraps resulting from a facility or plant. Sludge is any solid, semisolid, or liquid waste generated from a municipal, commercial, or industrial wastewater treatment plant, water supply treatment plant, or air pollution control facility exclusive of the treated effluent from a wastewater treatment plant. This includes electric arc furnace dust and baghouse dusts. A byproduct is a material that is not a primary product which is not solely or separately produced in a production process whereas coproducts are intentionally produced. Byproducts need further processing to be useful whereas coproducts are highly processed and can be sold as a commodity without further processing. Examples of byproducts include slag, fly ash, heavy ends, distillation column bottoms, etc. and coproducts include metals such as lead produced during the copper refining process. Scrap metal wastes include sheet metal, wire, metal tanks and containers, scrap automobiles, and machine shop turnings that are generally nonhazardous in nature. Medical waste Medical waste and biomedical waste consist of all waste materials generated at health care facilities including hospitals, clinics, offices of physicians, dentists, and veterinarians, blood banks, home health care facilities, funeral homes, medical research facilities, and laboratories. RCRA Subtitle J regulated medical waste in four states (New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island) and Puerto Rico, and expired on March 22, 1991. (See Medical Waste Tracking Act.) State environmental and health agencies regulate medical waste, rather than EPA. Other federal agencies have issued safety regulations governing the handling of medical waste, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the Food and Drug Administration. Special wastes Congress designated several kinds of industrial wastes as \\"special wastes,\\" which are exempt from hazardous waste handling requirements under RCRA Subtitle C, including oil and gas exploration and production wastes (such as drill cuttings, produced water, and drilling fluids), coal combustion residuals generated by electric power plants and other industries, mining waste, and cement kiln dust. See Solid Waste Disposal Amendments of 1980. =Hazardous Solid Wastes= The EPA, which regulates hazardous waste under Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), considers a waste hazardous waste if it is dangerous or potentially harmful to human health or the environment. Hazardous waste can be liquids, solids, gases, or sludges and can be discarded household, industrial, or commercial products such as oil, paints, certain electronics waste, cleaning fluids or pesticides, or the by-products of manufacturing processes. * Household Hazardous Wastes: This includes used and leftover household products that contain, corrosive, toxic, ignitable, or reactive constituents. Examples are medical waste, used oil, paints, cleaners, batteries, pesticides, and light bulbs/lamps. Since these contain potentially hazardous ingredients, improper disposal can lead to human health risks and environmental pollution. Proper and safe management of hazardous wastes is important in the collection, reuse, recycling, and disposal stages which are mostly facilitated by the municipalities or local governments and specified by EPA in household hazardous waste regulations. * Industrial Hazardous Wastes: The primary generators of hazardous wastes in any region are industrial facilities, manufacturing and processing units, workshops and maintenance units, nuclear facilities, chemical units, etc. The following section briefly describes the four main types of industrial hazardous wastes. *Listed Waste: 40CFR Part261 specifies four lists of wastes. These are: ** F-list: This is waste mainly generated from industrial or manufacturing processes or other different industrial sectors, also called non-specific source wastes. ** K-list: This is generated from specific industrial sources such as petroleum refining, wood treatment, pesticide manufacturing, inorganic pigment of chemical manufacturing, metal and coke production, and veterinary pharmaceutical industries. ** P-list and U-list: These are discarded or intended to be discarded commercial chemical products that have listed generic names, container residues, spill residues, or off-specification species. P-list differs from U-waste where the former is acute hazardous waste and the latter toxic waste. * Universal Waste: Federal regulations have designated hazardous wastes such as batteries, pesticides, mercury-containing equipment, and light bulbs/lamps as universal wastes. This is a way to streamline them separately and control and facilitate proper collection, storage, recovery or treatment, and disposal that encourages reducing the quantity of such wastes going to landfills and incinerators and thereby increases recovery and recycling rates. * Characteristic Waste: These are wastes that are defined based on their specific characteristics of ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, and toxicity. Federal statute 40CFR¬ß261 regulates these wastes. Ignitable wastes are defined by their combustion capacity under conditions when they consist of waste oils and solvents. Corrosive wastes like battery acids are characterized by their pH value ‚Äì acids (pH ‚â§ 2) and bases (pH ‚â• 12.5). Reactive wastes include lithium-sulfur batteries and explosives that can cause explosions, toxic fumes, or gases and toxic wastes that are harmful to human health or environment when inhaled or ingested or disposed. Examples of toxic wastes include mercury and lead. * Mixed Waste: These are wastes that contain both radioactive and hazardous waste components making them complicated to regulate. Low Level Mixed Wastes (LLMW) are generated from sources such as industrial, hospital, and nuclear power plant facilities and also from processes such as medical diagnostic testing and research, pharmaceutical and biotechnology development, pesticide research, and nuclear power plant operations. The other two types are High Level Mixed Waste (HLW) and Mixed Trans Uranic Waste (MTRU). =Sources= In 2009, U.S. residents, businesses, and institutions produced more than 243 million tons of municipal solid waste, which is approximately 4.34 lbs/person/day. In addition, American industrial facilities generate and dispose of approximately 7.6 billion tons of industrial solid waste each year as per the EPA estimations in 1980. These levels may be much higher now in the 21st century. The primary sources of solid waste are residential, commercial, and industrial entities, construction and renovation sites, hospitals, agricultural fields and animal farms, and treatment and processing plants. =Disposal= Before the 1980s most of the waste generated was either landfilled or burned. More than 90% of the municipal solid waste was landfilled or disposed with less than 7% materials recovery during the 1960s and 70s. This trend started changing after the 1980s when landfill disposal declined to about 54% and resource recovery increased to more than 33%. The most recent numbers from the EPA indicate that in 2012 the US municipal solid waste recycle rate was 34.5%. This section describes the common methods of solid waste disposal practiced in United States and worldwide. * Landfills: These are technically designed areas where waste is disposed scientifically. They are characterized by liners that prevent seepage of leachates into the groundwater. There are different designs for landfills used for municipal solid waste or household waste, construction & demolition waste, and hazardous waste. According to an EPA report, the number of municipal solid waste landfills has gone down from 7924 in 1988 to 1754 in 2006. There were close to 1900 construction & demolition landfills in 1994. * Combustion or Incineration: Combustion or incineration of waste reduces the amount of landfill space needed by burning waste in a controlled manner and also generates electricity through waste-to-energy technologies such as gasification, pyrolysis, anaerobic digestion, fermentation, etc. * Transfer Stations: Transfer stations are intermediate facilities where the collected municipal solid waste is unloaded from collection trucks, compacted to reduce the volume of the waste, and held for a short time before it is reloaded onto larger, long-distance trucks or containers for shipment to landfills or other treatment and disposal facilities. * Recovery & Recycling: Wastes are also good sources of raw materials. Recovery and recycling of wastes can help to reduce the use of virgin materials for producing new goods. Recycling construction & demolition waste can also save the space in landfills and large amounts of materials like metals, glass, plastics, and cardboards can be recovered. * Composting: Composting is a way to return nutrients back into the environment by allowing microorganisms to turn the waste into manure. Applying this manure to agricultural land can improve the fertility of the soil providing it essential nutrients. It is estimated that 27.8% of the municipal solid waste generated in United States in 2009 was organic waste consisting of yard trimmings and food waste that is compostable. The agricultural and animal waste generated can also be composted and used as manure. For example, it is estimated that a dairy cow produces approximately 40 pounds of waste (dung, urine) per day which can be dried and used as manure. This manure can also be used in digesters to produce biogas (methane gas) or electricity, and other biofuels like ethanol. =Costs and problems associated with waste= Some of the main issues associated with waste are open dumping, odor, particulate matter emissions, leachate seepage from landfills, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that lead to air pollution, surface and groundwater pollution, food chain contamination, land area depletion, human health impacts, environmental degradation, and negative impacts on plant and animal life. Rationales for solid waste policy Figure 3 - Demand Curve and Deadweight loss (DWL), Based on Portney and Stavins (2000), Page 269 All levels of government - federal, state, and local - are involved in regulating solid waste in United States. Proper waste management extends from solid waste collection, segregation, transportation, storing, treatment and disposal to education, labeling, trading, and interstate & intercontinental movement of waste. Portney and Stavins (2000) provide the following three rationales for government intervention in private waste markets: # Economies of scale - The cost of producing goods or services decreases as production increases. With regards to solid waste this principle applies to landfills where the average cost of landfill construction, operation, and maintenance decreases as waste disposed of increases. This propels interstate trade where private parties divert wastes to large regional landfills. # Public bad - Waste creates dissatisfaction to people which reduces social benefits or increases social cost, making it the opposite of a public good. The government, through its policies, makes waste an \\"excludable\\" good (or bad) thereby creating opportunities for waste collection firms to charge the household, industrial, and commercial waste generators for proper collection and disposal. # Negative externalities - Production of waste leads to environmental pollution especially when it is illegally disposed of, openly dumped, or burned, resulting in groundwater contamination or air pollution. It has been proven that emissions include high amounts of methane and trace amounts of benzene, hydrogen sulphide, and chorinated hydrocarbons along with other gases. This demand curve and the deadweight loss (DWL) associated with waste disposal (landfilling) is illustrated in Figure 3. Mechanisms and policy framework The government has a wide variety of different policy tools at its disposal from which it can choose. Due to the diverse nature of solid waste, the government employs a number of different policy tools at various levels in order to ensure efficient and safe handling and disposal of the many different types of waste, as well as in order to encourage recycling and source reduction. The following is a sampling of tools the United States government employs with regards to solid waste. =Deposit Refund= Deposit-refund systems or container deposit legislation, also known as \\"bottle bills\\", can be viewed either as a tax on producing waste in the form of beverage containers or as a subsidy for properly recycling these containers. When a retailer buys products from a distributor, it must pay a deposit for each beverage container it purchases. The retailer then includes the cost of the deposit in the item's price, passing it to the consumer. However, the consumer is refunded this money by properly disposing of the used beverage container at a retail or redemption center. The retailer also recoups the deposit from the distributor. This system encourages consumers to properly dispose of the waste they generate by buying beverages in disposable containers. It also creates a privately funded system for the handling of this waste. A deposit-refund bill named National Beverage Container Reuse and Recycling Act was introduced by the House of Representatives in 1994 but never became federal law. Bottle bills are currently in place in ten states as well as in Guam. Delaware repealed its bottle bill in 2010. Oregon was the first state to institute a bottle bill in 1971. The most common deposit is five cents, but this varies by state and by the type of container. =Pay as you throw= Pay as you throw is a model for pricing the disposal of municipal solid waste by unit of waste rather than by charging a uniform price for pickup and disposal. This acts as a tax on waste - the more waste a household produces, the more it will be charged for its disposal. Pay as you throw is administered on the municipal level. The purpose behind this system is to discourage waste generation and to encourage recycling. By charging citizens per unit of waste, municipalities hope to discourage waste generation by causing households to consider the quantity of waste they are producing by making them pay for it. It is estimated that pay as you throw programs have decreased municipal solid waste by about 17% in weight, with a 6% decrease attributed to source reduction efforts and an 8-11% due to waste diversion to recycling and yard programs. In 2006, pay as you throw had been instituted in over 7,000 United States communities. =Permits= Under the RCRA, the EPA issues permits to ensure the safe treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous wastes. In order to receive a permit, the party managing the waste has to meet certain criteria, as specified by the Act. Permits are used to set a minimum baseline of safety standards that must be met in the handling and disposal of waste in order to control this process and ensure a degree of safety is achieved. This is an example of command and control regulation, by which the government specifies certain standards that parties must meet. =Technology standards= Technology standards are another form of command and control regulation by the government. Technology standards stipulate certain types or levels of technologies that must be employed to ensure the safe storage or treatment of waste. For example, technology standards have been created for the design of landfills and there are requirements for the design of the liners in order to prevent leechate. =Performance standards= Performance standards dictate maximum levels of emissions that may be released in the process of waste management and disposal. These standards are set by the federal government, but can be made more stringent by states. For example, incinerators may not emit over 180 mg of particulate matter per dry standard cubic meter. Other emissions from incinerators are also regulated. =Labeling= Different labeling standards are required by the federal government and by some states for different types of waste such as hazardous waste and medical waste. Labeling ensures that those coming into contact with these types of waste are aware of the nature of the waste. In this way, labeling is also intended to help ensure proper handling and disposal. =Challenges and goals= The EPA has set forth challenges and goals with regards to solid waste. The Resource Conservation Challenge aims to: *\\"Prevent pollution and promote reuse and recycling; *Reduce priority and toxic chemicals in products and waste; and *Conserve energy and materials.\\" It has also issued a challenge to increase recycling to encompass 35% of the country's municipal solid waste. The EPA's other three focuses are on recycling electronics, recycling industrial materials, and reducing priority and toxic chemicals. These challenges and goals are supported by voluntary programs and partnerships. =Partnerships= The EPA has established a number of partnerships with businesses and organizations, industries, states, local governments, tribes, and other entities to reduce and effectively manage waste. Examples of these partnerships are Plug-In To eCycling, the Schools Chemical Cleanout Campaign, and WasteWise. All of these examples aim to meet the goals of the Resource Conservation Challenge. These partnerships are voluntary. Entities may enter into these partnerships because of a variety of expected benefits, including costs savings and improved public image. In another example, EPA and state and tribal representatives jointly developed a framework for industrial waste management aimed to establish a common set of guidelines. Under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, EPA convened a focus group consisting of industry and public stakeholders to provide assistance throughout the industrial waste management process. =Information= On its wastes website, the EPA provides a large amount of information on topics pertaining to waste, such as source reduction and recycling. In this way, the government is working to educate its citizens in order to reduce the amount of waste and ensure its proper disposal in a non coercive manner. This website is also a good source for people looking for instructions on how to properly dispose of items such as compact fluorescent bulbs or electronics. United States legislation =History= Federal solid waste law has gone through four major phases. The Solid Waste Disposal Act (SWDA) of 1965 was the first U.S. federal solid waste management law enacted. It focused on research, demonstrations, and training. In a second phase, the Resource Recovery Act of 1970 emphasized reclaiming energy and materials from solid waste instead of dumping. In a third phase, the federal government started playing more active regulatory role, with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) of 1976. RCRA instituted the first federal permitting program for hazardous waste and it also made open dumping illegal. RCRA focuses only on active and future facilities and does not address abandoned or historical sites which are managed under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980 - commonly known as Superfund. Implementation of RCRA was relatively slow and Congress reauthorized and strengthened RCRA through the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984. This was the beginning of the fourth phase. The 1984 RCRA Amendments suggested a policy shift away from land disposal and toward more preventive solutions. RCRA has been amended on two occasions since HSWA: the Federal Facility Compliance Act of 1992 which strengthened enforcement of RCRA at federal facilities and the Land Disposal Program Flexibility Act of 1996 which provided regulatory flexibility for land disposal of certain wastes. Solid waste legislation has been constantly strengthened and improved by the introduction of amendments to the major laws mentioned above and other specific laws. The most important amendments are: * Resource Recovery Act of 1970 which provides state and local governments with technical and financial help in planning and developing resource recovery and waste disposal systems * Used Oil Recycling Act of 1980 which defines the terms used oil, recycled oil, lubricating oil, and re-refined oil, and encourages state to use recycled oil * Solid Waste Disposal Act Amendments of 1980 which targets against hazardous waste dumping * Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) of 1986 which amends CERCLA of 1980, increases state involvement in the Superfund program, and encourages greater citizen participation in decision making * Medical Waste Tracking Act of 1988 created RCRA Subtitle J, which expired on March 22, 1991. See Medical waste. * Ocean Dumping Ban Act of 1988 which prohibits all municipal sewage sludge and industrial waste dumping into the ocean * RCRA cleanup reforms I&II; of 1999 and 2001 which accelerate the cleanup of hazardous waste facilities regulated under RCRA * Used Oil Management Standards of 2003 which defines used oil management standards in a more exact manner Statutes and rules designed to improve community access to information about chemical hazards: * Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act (EPCRA), also known as SARA Title III of 1980, which provides for notification of emergency releases of chemicals, and addresses communities' right-to-know about toxic and hazardous chemicals * RCRA Expanded Public Participation Rule of 1996 which encourages communities' involvement in the process of permitting hazardous waste facilities and expands public access to information about such facilities Statutes and rules designed to prevent pollution: * Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 which requires the EPA to establish an Office of Pollution Prevention and the owners and operators of manufacturing facilities to report annually on source reduction and recycling activities * Hazardous Waste Combustors; Revised Standards; Final Rule - Part 1 of 1998 which provides for a conditional exclusion from RCRA for fuels which are produced from a hazardous waste and promotes the installation of cost effective pollution prevention technologies =Federal legislation= Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Within RCRA, the EPA has three comprehensive waste management programs: # Subtitle C - Hazardous waste: The Subtitle C program establishes a system for controlling hazardous waste from its generation until its ultimate disposal (\\"cradle-to-grave\\" approach). This program identifies the criteria to determine hazardous waste and establishes requirements for all of the parties: producers, transporters and disposal facilities. # Subtitle D - Solid waste: The Subtitle D program establishes a system for controlling (primarily non- hazardous) solid waste, such as household waste. The program provides the states and local governments with guidance, policy and regulations for the efficient waste management. # Subtitle I - Underground storage tanks: The Subtitle I program in RCRA regulates toxic substances and petroleum products stored in underground storage tanks (UST). The program establishes requirements for design and operation of UST aimed at preventing accidental spills. =Main RCRA accomplishments= Some of the main achievements of RCRA since its implementation are given below: * Established design and performance standards for landfills and treatment technologies; * Established \\"cradle-to-grave\\" tracking of hazardous waste; * Caused the closure of a large number of mismanaged facilities; two-thirds of non-compliant land disposal facilities were closed; * Prevented the disposal of untreated wastes into and onto the land; * Permitted more than 900 hazardous waste management facilities; * Assessed over 1,600 facilities; * Authorized 48 states for the base RCRA program. =Improvement Areas= There are a number of lessons learned post-implementation of RCRA. First of all it appeared that close Congressional oversight could limit flexibility. After 1984, when HSWA were approved, EPA's discretion was influenced by close Congressional oversight. Congress set specific implementation deadlines for the hazardous waste program. The very demanding regulatory development schedule did not allow EPA to pay enough attention to other very important priorities. The important priorities for EPA found by their study are listed below: * Program evaluation and long-term priorities should be strengthened; * Old regulations should be revised; New regulations could make it difficult for state programs; * Stronger focus on environmental data is needed; * State authorization should be faster; * Alternates should be examined; * Potential regulatory overlaps or inconsistencies should be addressed. =State legislation= Federal guidelines have provided state, tribal, and some local governments regulatory responsibility for ensuring proper management of wastes generated from each source in their region but the programs might vary considerably in their guidelines and implementation. As of 2011, the EPA has authorized forty-eight states, except Alaska and Iowa (Hawaii was added in 2001), to implement the RCRA, meaning the states' regulations must meet at least the requirements set at the federal level and may be more stringent. Many states follow the federal rules for hazardous waste management and also have more stringent state requirements on hazardous and toxic wastes in particular. California, New York and Iowa are some states that have additional requirements. For example, the California Department of Toxic and Hazardous Substances distinguishes discarded mercury-containing products and waste oil as separate groups of hazardous waste. =Municipal legislation= Municipalities are in charge of local recycling and trash collection. They can choose whether to contract these services out to private companies or not and how to charge for these services. Municipalities also may adopt approaches of converting waste to energy through methods such as generating electricity from landfill gas. Therefore, municipalities play an important role in everyday waste management. There is, of course, a wide variety of implementation across the country. Challenges and issues Solid waste management challenges and issues that should be considered while framing solid waste policy include proper waste generation, segregation, collection, transportation, and disposal methods, landfill management, hazardous and other toxic material management, treatment, incineration, recycling and other technology standards, monitoring, evaluation, and continuous improvement methods. In addition to these issues, policy has to address the short term and long-term economic, environmental, and social costs and benefits, funding methods, and roles of various stakeholders.

The conflict ended on January 18, when Laurence Golborne and the Citizens Assembly of Magallanes reached an agreement. Background On December 29, 2010, the directory of Empresa Nacional del Petr√≥leo (ENAP, National Petroleum Company) faced with high deficits due to subsidies provided to XII Region (Magallanes and Ant√°rtica Chilena) gas customers, proposed to increase the price of the natural gas by 16.8% in the region, located in the southern extreme of Chile, where everything requires gas heating because of the extreme climate. The apparent increase in the price was actually the result of a reduction of the heavily subsidised pricing for natural gas for users in this region. ENAP provides subsidies of approximately 80 percent of the delivered cost of gas in this region. As a result, users receive extremely low-cost natural gas, while residential users of natural gas in the Santiago region pay extremely high prices for the same commodity. Protests Residents of Puerto Natales protesting against the increasing of the gas price. Empresa Nacional del Petr√≥leo's decision, supported by the President Sebasti√°n Pi√±era, the Energy Minister Ricardo Raineri, and the Mining Minister Laurence Golborne, prompted a series of protests in that region during the following weeks, including mass mobilisations, and a stoppage in the region's most important cities, such as Punta Arenas and Puerto Natales. Stylized version of the Magallanes y la Ant√°rtica Chilena Region flag, saying \\"No to the increase of gas [prices] in Magallanes.\\" On January 11, the Asamblea Ciudadana de Magallanes (Magallanes Citizens' Assembly) convoked an indefinite strike from that midnight. Two women, Claudia Castillo Campos, 19, and Melisa Silva Ruiz, 23, were killed by a truck during the protests in Punta Arenas that night. The driver of the truck was trying to run through the illegal barricades that were being operated by the persons who were injured. The events took place late at night and involved the serious injury of an unsupervised small child. The parents, who could have been charged with endangering the child, received no legal sanctions. On the same day, more than thirty-one persons were arrested, some while trying to loot, burn, or otherwise destroy public property. Punta Arenas judges ordered the nearly immediate release of almost all those who were caught by the police. After the first manifestations, Carabineros de Chile requested a contingent of Special Forces to control the strike. During the January 12, the strike continued in the main towns of the Magallanes y la Ant√°rtica Chilena Region, extending itself to the main border crossings with Argentina. More than two thousand cars remained isolated while trying to cross from the province of Tierra del Fuego to the province of Santa Cruz through Chilean territory. Another 1,500 tourists were left without movement in Torres del Paine National Park after routes to Puerto Natales and El Calafate were cut. Actions by the protesters halted buses of people attempting to flee from Chile, leaving them at barricaded locations outside the cities, unable to move except by walking. This \\"forced march\\" situation adversely affected many elderly tourists, including those with disabilities, resulting in human rights complaints and well as violations of Chilean national law providing for free passage within the country. The Chilean national police, the Carabineros, refused to act on behalf of the foreign visitors by enforcing the national law, instead leaving these people without access to food or water, stranded without transportation outside the cities. Many elderly and handicapped people were thus forced to walk for up to 20 km. Before the regional protests and rebellion against the law were over, thousands of people had to be evacuated. Some chose to walk from Puerto Natales to the frontier with Argentina, where they were received as refugees, and given assistance to onward travel and other accommodation. Eventually the US Embassy quietly arranged for a cooperative effort involving the Chilean Air Force. Squadron Commander Vegas was credited with a successful airlift of several thousand visitors, with most being delivered to the Punta Arenas airport for onward transportation so that those people could flee from southern Chile. LAN airlines was able to evacuate many of these affected people with flights to Santiago. Although it worked normally, cuts in the route to President Carlos Ib√°√±ez del Campo International Airport forced the suspension of Sky Airline and LAN Airlines flights. Consequences Prior to the conclusion of the protests, the Interior Ministry invoked the Law of Internal Security of the State, with the intent to begin judicial determination of those responsible for the damages inflicted during the disturbances. The value of the damages varies, but was estimated in the Prensa Austral as being economic damage of approximately US$14 million, with additional damages to the infrastructure of Punta Arenas. The law of Internal Security of the State also provides for the use of the Chilean armed forces in restoring civil order, and the invocation of this law may have played a part in bringing the Asambla Ciudadana de Magallanes to the bargaining table. On January 14, the Minister Secretary General of Government Ena von Baer announced changes in Sebasti√°n Pi√±era's Government cabinet, including the resignment of Ricardo Raineri as Energy Minister. Laurence Golborne became Mining and Energy Minister, on January 16. End of the conflict On January 18, an agreement between the Government of Chile and the Magallanes Citizens' Assembly was signed. The government proposed to increase the price of gas by 3%, far less than its originally planned increase of almost 17%. Industries will also be benefited by the agreement. Also, the government proposed to give 17,000 subsidies to the poorest families in the region, which will not be affected by the 3% increase.

Biography Scott was born in Fairmount, Indiana 11 May 1875. His father was a minister with the Religious Society of Friends. He graduated from Indiana University in 1897. His writing career began with three years experience as a reporter; he worked at a Louisiana newspaper owned by his brother. Later (1900‚Äì01) he became assistant editor of the Woman‚Äôs Home Companion. Scott was a social activist. In 1902‚Äì3 he was assistant headworker at the University Settlement House. It is there that he met and later married on 27 Jun 1904 Miriam Finn, a Russian Jewish writer, with whom he had a daughter. Around this time Scott was an officer of the Intercollegiate Socialist Society, of which he was a founder. Scott had come to University Settlement after Hull House experience. After his settlement experience, Scott and his wife came to live at the \\"A-Club\\", a cooperative, and a \\"radical center.\\" In 1906, Scott helped arrange accommodations for Maxim Gorky during his visit to the United States. In 1907 Scott and his wife visited Russia. To research his book about labor relations, The Walking Delegate (1905), Scott Joined the Structural Iron Workers Union. In addition to novels, Scott became involved in the movie industry, where he accumulated numerous writing credits, as well as an acting credit in one film. When Goldwyn Pictures determined a need to produce movies in New York as well as on the west coast, Scott's Partners of the Night was chosen as the first work.

Polish units under Apolinary Kurowski numbering around 2500 troops attacked the town in an attempt to gain control of the so-called border triangle - an area at the cross roads of the Austrian, Prussian and Russian partitions which would have allowed the insurgents access to supplies and troops from outside the Congress Poland where the uprising proper was taking place. They were hoping to surprise Russian troops. However, Russian garrison (2 companies, 550 men) was stronger than expected by insurgents. Either the Russian commander guessed the intent, or the strategic plan of the Poles was somehow betrayed. As a result, they bolstered their defenses. Initial engagements were favorable to the Poles. These included a successful charge by the Zouaves of Death, a unit organized by Francois Rochebrune and led by Wojciech Komorowski in this battle, on Russian positions in the local cemetery. However, charges by the Polish cavalry through the narrow streets of the town resulted in very high casualties in the face of concentrated fire from the Russians and eventually a panic of the Polish troops. According to contemporary Russian reports, 200 insurrectionists died. There were also some reports of atrocities, including the killing or burying alive of the wounded. As a measure of repression, the town was set on fire and local residents were forbidden to put it out. As a result of the engagement, Kurowski's unit ceased to exist.

Chinese Surinamese are a small part of the Surinamese people. There were 7,885 Chinese at the 2012 census, constituting 1.5% of the total population. They constitute the largest component of the 'other' ethnic category, which makes up 2.3% of the population as per the CIA World Factbook. The majority of the Chinese Surinamese consider Hakka (Dongguan, Huiyang, Huizhou or Bao'an, Shenzhen) of Guangdong as their ancestral homes. There is a small minority of Heshan, Jiangmen origin Cantonese and Hakkas as well. Many Chinese Surinamese are active in the retail and business community. Six percent of the Chinese in the Netherlands migrated from Suriname. History =Contract workers= Southern Chinese migrant family In 1853, planters in Suriname feared a labor shortage when slavery was about to be abolished. They asked the government to recruit other workers from abroad. The government of Java recruited a group of 18 Chinese for contract labor in the Catharina Sophia plantation in Saramacca. Because of the high acquisition costs, it was decided to get a second group, not from Java, but from China instead. In 1858, 500 Chinese laborers were recruited by the Dutch consul in Macau. They arrived in Suriname in April, but it turned out that no one wanted to hire people to do work that slaves would do \\"for free\\". Because of this, the contract with the Chinese was changed without their knowledge by Governor Charles Pierre Schimpf, in favor of the employers. The Chinese could now be treated like slaves. When they would revolt against this, they were, without due process and contrary to existing regulations, punished by police with cane strokes, an unlawful act that was repeated again and again. An interpellation (formal request for information) to the Minister of Colonies Jan Jacob Rochussen did not help. In the 1850s and 1860s, about 2,500 Chinese people went to Suriname. Most were employed as contract laborers on the plantations. After their contracts expired, many found opportunities in trade, mostly in food retail. Most of the male laborers were married to non-Chinese women. Those who married Chinese women, mostly married with an imported bride. =Later immigrants= Other Chinese came to Suriname as free laborers, traders and shop assistants, especially in the 1950s and 1960s. Further large numbers came in the 1990s. In 2007, there were over 70,000 Chinese in Suriname, and the immigration is still ongoing. The rapidly growing demand in China for wood and minerals makes Suriname very attractive to Chinese businesses. The new Chinese migrants from northern China are known in Suriname as \\"salt-water-Chinese\\". Since the 1960s, thousands of Chinese have emigrated from Suriname to the Netherlands. The Chinese held a prominent position in small and medium business for a long time, and their mostly well-educated offspring of mixed ancestry or Chinese ancestry can be found in various social sectors. Also, the Surinamese people have adopted several Chinese customs. Languages The original Chinese settlers were Hakka from the Fuitungon region of Guangdong;Tjon Sie Fat, \\"They Might as Well Be Speaking Chinese,\\" p. 199. Fui5tung1on1 means three places: Huiyang, Huizhou or Fui5jong2, Dongguan or tung1kon1, and Bao'an County, Shenzhen or pau3on1,Tjon, \\"They Might as Well Be Speaking Chinese,\\" p. 196. Hakka was originally present and became the \\"old Chinese\\" of Guyana. It was previously the only spoken variety of Chinese in the country.Tjon, \\"They Might as Well Be Speaking Chinese,\\" p. 201. Paul Brendan Tjon Sie Fat of the University of Amsterdam stated that Hakka people in Suriname do not frequently voice negative attitudes towards the fact that Hakka has a lower status than Dutch in Suriname.Tjon Sie Fat, \\"They Might as Well Be Speaking Chinese,\\" p. 202. In the 1970s Cantonese was introduced into Suriname. Beginning in the 1990s new migrants from China moved to Suriname, and Putonghua, during circa 2004-2014, became the main Chinese lingua franca in the country. There are Mandarin and Cantonese television shows aired in Suriname. Religion Most of the Chinese Surinamese are irreligious, with significant population adhering to Christianity. Hinduism and Islam are also followed in small number.https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/sources/census/wphc/Suriname/SUR- Census2012-vol1.pdf Notable people * Henk Chin A Sen Èôà‰∫öÂÖà, President and Prime Minister of Suriname, 1980-1982; Chin paternal side was Hakka Chinese and maternal side was mixed Creole * Anton Jie Sam Foek, First broadcast correspondent for the Netherlands in Latin America * Imro Fong Poen, Cabinet Minister, 1980-1986 * Cerezo Fung a Wing, Football player * Roy Ho Ten Soeng, Mayor of Venhuizen, North Holland, 2000-2006; First immigrant Mayor of Netherlands; First Chinese Mayor of Netherlands and Europe * Calvin Jong-a- Pin, Football player; Jong-a-Pin is of mixed ancestry * Michael P.

She is a professor at the St Petersburg State Conservatoire named after N. Rimsky-Korsakov (1987), and the Chief Researcher at the Russian Institute of Fine Arts History in St Petersburg. She is considered an Honoured Art Worker of Russian Federation. Education She graduated in 1965 from two departments at the Leningrad State Conservatoire named after N. Rimsky- Korsakov: the department of History of Music and Piano Performing Faculty, and the department of Organ Playing, having studied under Prof Isai Braudo. It was at the Conservatoire that she finished a postgraduate course in the department of History of Western Music, under the supervision of Prof Dr Mikhail Druskin. In 1970 Liudmila Kovnatskaya presented a candidate dissertation on Benjamin Britten's oeuvre. In 1987 she completed a doctoral dissertation on English music of 20th century, at the Moscow research institute of Arts of Academy of Science, USSR. Professional experience Since 1987 Prof Kovnatskaya is a member of Russian Composers‚Äô Union, and she was a member of the General Council for Cultural Affairs of St Petersburg from 1987 until 1993. In 2002 she became a member of the Council (Directorium) of the IMS. In the same year, she became a member of the editorial board of the journal ‚ÄúTempo‚Äù (Cambridge). In 2001 Prof Kovnatskaya became a materials consultant on Russian music for \\"The Grove‚Äôs Dictionary of Music and Musicians\\" (London: McMillan, 2001). She was also a guest lecturer at the University of Manchester (1991), the Aldeburgh Festival (UK), and the Ural Conservatoire in Yekaterinburg. Liudmila Kovnatskaya is the author of a monograph about Benjamin Britten (Moscow, 1974), in the book ‚ÄúEnglish Music in the 20th Century: Sources and periods of development‚Äù (Moscow, 1986). Thanks to her research and organization activity in Russia, various festivals and concerts were organized, which were dedicated to English classic music, including Britten. Among them were ‚ÄúArs Britannica‚Äù (1988‚Äì1990), the festival in honour of ‚ÄúThe 80th anniversary of B. Britten‚Äù (1993), ‚ÄúThe World of Ralph Vaughan Williams‚Äù (1996), the festival of Britten's music on his 85th anniversary (1998), the jubilee concert in honour of Britten and Saint Cecilia, patron saint of musicians (2003), the concert ‚ÄúWorld of Opera: Benjamin Britten‚Äù, and others. Prof Kovnatskaya's research fields include History of Russian Music; she has written, edited and compiled books and articles on D. Shostakovich. Among her non-published manuscripts one can find a monumental work entitled ‚ÄúIdeological control of Musical avant- garde of 1920s: Leningrad Association of Contemporary Music in reports and other materials‚Äù (Soros Foundation Funding). Shostakovich, Schoenberg, Britten, Purcell, Tippet, Arensky, Balakirev, English music, Russian-English connections, M. S. Druskin, A. Schweitzer and the Soviet musical epoch ‚Äì all these subjects were established by Prof Kovnatskaya due to her intensive and rigorous nature as a researcher, editor and author of books, proceedings, collections and many-volume editions. A separate field of her research and publishing activity is the ‚Äòoffering to the Teacher‚Äô, who was a famous musicologist and Professor of Leningrad Conservatoire Mikhail Druskin. In 2009, thanks to Prof Kovnatskaya, a two-volume collection was published, entitled ‚ÄúMemory to Mikhail Semenovich Druskin‚Äù, which united articles, recollections, biographical materials and correspondence. All who knew M. Druskin as a musician, musicologist and teacher took part in the creation of this 1000 page book. Furthermore, in addition to this, Liudmila Kovnatskaya led the task of re-publishing works by Druskin and, as a result, realized an extensive project: a 7-volume Collected Works. At present, the first volume, ‚ÄúClavir music‚Äù, and the fourth volume, ‚ÄúIgor Stravinsky‚Äù, are published.

The Fragrance Foundation announced that both the male and female fragrances were in the top 7 selling fragrances for the first quarter of 2015. Advertising The initial advert for the fragrance was filmed in 2007 in Capri, Italy with models David Gandy and Marija Vujovic wearing tiny white swimsuits and kissing on a raft. The voice is the one of the French voice over actor Pierre Maubouch√©, who also voiced the subsequent TV commercials, also aired worldwide. According to British researchers, the advertisement is among the sexiest television adverts. In 2010, the adverts featured Gandy with model Anna Jagodzinska. Instead of the raft, the models are seen in tiny white suits before swimming to shore where they embrace. Both versions of the advertisements were shot by fashion photographer Mario Testino in the waters off the island of Capri. In May 2013, Dolce & Gabbana released their third version of the ‚ÄúLight Blue‚Äù fragrance campaign. Mario Testino again filmed the commercials and adverts on location in Capri but this time with Italian model Bianca Balti in the female role opposite Gandy. In 2015, InStyle magazine included Light Blue as one of 'The 10 Hottest Perfume Campaigns'. Balti and Gandy participated in a photoshoot in support of the 2015 limited versions with photographer Victor Demarchelier.

He supported the Royalist side in the English Civil War. Family and early life Lewknor was the fourth son of Richard Lewknor of West Dean, Sussex, and his wife Eleanor Broome, daughter of Sir Christopher Brome of Holton, Oxfordshire. Sussex Archaeological Collections, the History of Antiquities 1850 His eldest brother, Richard Lewknor, also served as a Member of Parliament. Lewknor's father died in 1603, when Christopher was around five years old. His mother subsequently married Sir William Oglander and had other children, among whom was the future politician and diarist Sir John Oglander. Lewknor received an annuity of ¬£20 from his grandfather, Sir Richard Lewknor, the chief justice of Chester. Christopher followed his grandfather into the legal profession, receiving his education at the Middle Temple from 1617, and being called to its bar in 1625. This was in spite of having gained a reputation as belonging to a group at the Temple notorious for being ‚Äòexceeding riotous and dissolute swaggerers and professed duellists and champions‚Äô. In 1621 he was one of the group to be accused in a Star Chamber case of trying to provoke an older man into a fight. Lewknor was defended by Thomas Whatman in the case. After his call to the bar, Lewknor served, like his grandfather, as counsel to the Percy family. Parliamentary career In 1628 Lewknor was elected Member of Parliament for Midhurst and held the seat until 1629 when King Charles decided to rule without parliament for eleven years. West Dean, A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 4: The Rape of Chichester (1953), pp. 97-101. Date accessed: 18 January 2011. He, like his brother Richard, made little contribution to the business of parliament, though he made notes on its progress. In 1636 Lewknor was appointed to a commission for better preservation of timber in view of the growth of the Sussex iron trade.Mark Antony Lower Contributions to literature: historical, antiquarian, and metrical By the early 1630s he was recorder of Chichester. In April 1640, he was elected MP for Chichester in the Short Parliament. He was re-elected MP for Chichester in November 1640 for the Long Parliament and sat until he was disabled as a Royalist in 1642. He went over to the Royalist side, was commissioned in the King's army and attended the Oxford Parliament. He became Doctor of Civil Law at Oxford in 1642. In August 1642 Lewknor supported Chichester mayor Robert Exton when he issued the Royal Commission of Array, calling upon all able-bodied men to take arms for the king; in response to the city's \\"Valiant Resolution to stand for the privileges of Parliament, the Protestant religion, the laws of the land, and the liberty of the people\\".The City of Chichester: Historical introduction, A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 3 (1935), pp. 82-90. Date accessed: 18 January 2011 Lewknor was styled \\"the man appointed by his Majesty to take in money and plate on his behalfe\\" and on 28 August 1642, he took part in a parley between the besiegers of Portsmouth and the beleaguered garrison.Marquis of Winchester's Regiment - Civil War in Hampshire In January 1643 he was a prisoner at Windsor Castle. He was knighted on 18 December 1644. He appears to have been present at the siege of Salcombe Castle in early 1646, when a Parliamentarian recorded that ‚ÄòKit Lukener the great trencher man being therein, is afraid he shall be starved‚Äô. In 1651, parliament ordered his lands to be sold. Later years Lewknor drew up his will on 1 July 1653, in which he describes himself as being ‚Äòsick in body‚Äô. He presumably died shortly afterwards, as on 5 September Sir Edward Hyde could observe that he had been ‚Äòdead these many months‚Äô. He had married Mary, daughter of John May of Rawmere, on 7 May 1619. She was the widow of William Smyth of Binderton, Sussex. The couple had two daughters before Mary's death in 1642. Christopher Lewknor died without any male heirs, though two of his grandsons entered parliament, Christopher Knight for Arundel in 1698 and William Knight for Midhurst in 1713.

She was born in Ioannina in the Janina Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire in a Romaniote Jewish community. The Romaniote community was male-dominated and births of females were not even recorded which may account for lack of information of Amalia‚Äôs early life. In 1912, when Bakas was 15 years old, she traveled to America on the Kaiser Franz Josef I ocean liner. She was detained at Ellis Island, lacking the necessary $50 fee until a phone call to a relative was made, who paid the fee for her. In 1913, she married Jack Saretta, also from Ioannina and they lived on Rivington Street on the Lower East Side in New York, NY. She worked in a factory as a seamstress and the couple had two daughters, Diamond and Ester Cleonike. In the 1920s, Bakas began to perform in the caf√©-amans and Turkish nightclubs in the early 1920s taking the stage name Amalia. Her first recordings were made with the M.G. Parsekian Record Company in Hoboken, New Jersey and consisted of 8 Turkish songs. Later in Chicago she recorded 6 Greek and Turkish songs with the Greek Record Company. Bakas also recorded with Marika Papagika, another popular Greek singer of the time. Bakas was one of Papagika‚Äôs only known friends and Papagika would babysit her daughter Diamond. Her daughter Diamond would often perform with her mother by either singing duets or by accompanying her on the doumbek. As the life of a performer was not one a woman of the Romaniote community should be leading, Bakas' husband divorced her and sent her other daughter Ester to live in Greece. In 1926 she converted to the Greek Orthodox Church to marry Gus Bakas. Amalia and Gus worked in the restaurant business with Bakas still performing at the caf√©-amans on 8th Avenue in New York City. During the 1930s, Bakas did not record, but traveled the United States to perform with George Katsaros. They performed in New York City, the Catskill Mountain region, Finger Lakes region, Detroit, Chicago, Gary, Indiana and Philadelphia where large Greek communities resided. In this period of the Second World War, Bakas and her daughter Diamond were living in Chicago, working at a restaurant called Pantheon where she also performed. In the early part of the decade, Bakas recorded for Ajdin Aselois labels in which she had part ownership. She performed with a variety of artists including Gus Gadines, John Pappas, John Dalas, Garbis Bakirgian, Theodore Kappas, Alexis Zervas, and Nicke Doneff. During this period, the 1940s, there was a revival of Greek songs from the 1910s and 1920s and Amalia‚Äôs recordings reflected this shift. This revival can be directly attributed to the mass exodus of Greek refugees fleeing from Turkey to Greece - escaping the 20th century's first mass genocide. Over one- third of Amalia's music during this period were old songs from her own or from the pioneer Greek vocalist Coula Antonopoulos's early recorded music - which were laments, music expressing personal anguish and resilience in times of hardship, adversity, and atrocities. These provided some solace to expatriates eager to begin a new life in America. In the early 1960s, Amalia retired from the performing life. She moved to New Port Richey, Florida to be close to her daughter in 1974. She died in 1979 and her obituary did not even mention her career as a singer.

He and his colleague Tardivaut fabricate a case ‚Äì the Veauradieux trial ‚Äì to create an alibi for their extramarital affairs. It chances that both their mistresses live in the same apartment block, and that, unknown to them, Tardivaut's mistress, Zizi, has another admirer: Fauvinard's lecherous but narcoleptic uncle. Fauvinard's mistress, C√©sarine, also has another admirer, whose wife is Fauvinard's client in her divorce suit. Circumstances bring all the main characters together in C√©sarine's flat, where the urgent necessity to avoid being found there causes frenetic exits and entrances, offstage savagings by C√©sarine's man-hating pet dog, and adoption of fictitious identities. Eventually all is safely resolved, and the men are back under the supervision of their wives (and mothers-in-law) convinced that dissipation does not suit them.

Wanner located at the Fire and Police Safety Academy, which is in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States. The life-size bronze sculpture depicts a police officer and a fire fighter both holding a rescued child. Description On Watch is a life-size bronze sculpture consisting of three figures. A Caucasian policeman and an African-American firefighter stand back-to-back holding a child wrapped in a blanket. The inscription on the southwest corner of the sculpture reads: WANNER 90. The inscription on the northwest corner reads: WACO FDR. There is a bronze plaque on the concrete base which reads: On Watch/ Dedicated to the guardians of public safety in the city of Milwaukee John Norquist, mayor Milwaukee Art Commission, David M. Wanner Sculptor 1990., SIRIS. The work is administered by the City of Milwaukee. Historical information In 1972-73 the city of Milwaukee converted Madonna High School into a modern training academy for the city's policemen and firemen. The new building qualified for Milwaukee's Percent for Art program, therefore two competitions were held by the Milwaukee Arts Commission to choose a sculpture for the site. After the first competition's results were announced, the artists involved complained of changes in guidelines and favoritism. A second competition was thus held. David M. Wanner won the second competition and the $33,000 commission.Buck, Diane M. and Virginia A. Palmer (1995). Outdoor Sculpture in Milwaukee: A Cultural and Historical Guidebook, p. 150. The State Historical Society of Wisconsin, Madison The three bronze figures were cast in thirteen pieces and then welded together. They were set on concrete foundations, which go 4 1/2 ft. underground. \\"Wanner wanted to subtly represent the fire fighter as a black minority- either a man or woman; however, the bronze casting by a local industrial foundry blurred the desired nuance.\\" Artist David M. Wanner was a Catholic priest as a young man and participated in the civil rights movement. He received a PhD in Fine Arts and Sculpture in 1976 from the Union Institute in Cincinnati, and an MA in Systematic Technology in 1973 from Marquette University in Milwaukee. He has worked in sculpture and design since 1968. Wanner founded Wanner Sculpture Studio in 1970 in Milwaukee, where he works with his son Jordan Wanner. The sculptor is inspired by his faith as well as the work of other artists. \\"The sculptural style of David and Jordan is rooted in the contemporary European tradition of sculpture, as exemplified in the works of Me≈°troviƒá, Bourdelli, Rodin, Barlach, Kolbe, Marcks, and others.\\", Wanner Studio Website. He currently works on both private commissions and ecclesiastical sculptures.

In the episode, Olivia is forced to recount her time spent as a child in tests conducted by Walter to regain the ability to see objects that have been influenced by the parallel universe and prevent the deaths of innocents. Though successful, Olivia comes to learn the truth about Peter, that he is from the parallel universe. The episode was a mid-season finale. It was written by Ashley Edward Miller and Zack Stentz, and directed by filmmaker Charles Beeson. It premiered to mostly positive reviews on February 4, 2010 in the United States, earning an estimated 7.76 million viewers. Plot A localized earthquake in New York City damages only one building, killing nearly all inside. The Fringe team discovers that a second building appeared at the same location as the first, fusing the structure and people inside together. Walter (John Noble) realizes that the second building has been pulled from the parallel universe by Thomas Jerome Newton, using the technology that Walter and William Bell had discovered years ago. Walter warns that because of conservation of mass, a building of similar mass will be taken from the prime universe to the parallel one sometime in the next few days. While Massive Dynamic offers its computing resources to identify possible buildings of similar mass, Walter implores Olivia (Anna Torv) to recall her childhood Cortexiphan-induced ability to see objects from the alternate universe, believing she will be able to foresee which building will be affected and warn everyone in time. He takes her to the disused child-care facility in Jacksonville, Florida, where the Cortexiphan trials were performed. Walter first puts Olivia under heavy sedation, and she experiences meeting her younger, frightened self, but is still unable to trigger her ability. Olivia begins to remember the gruesome trials she experienced, including footage from one test where she exhibited pyrokinesis. As Walter's deadline nears, he realizes that Olivia is no longer frightened and thus she cannot engage her abilities, which were triggered by fear. They return to New York City as small micro-quakes occur, indicating the onset of the event. Though a few buildings have been identified as possible targets, there are far too many to evacuate without starting a mass panic. Olivia, unable to help, goes off privately, but Peter (Joshua Jackson) follows and comforts her. Olivia soon recognizes she is frightened again, and races to a rooftop, seeing a building \\"shimmer\\" in the distance. The building, a hotel, is quickly identified from the list of candidates, and it is evacuated in time, moments before it is pulled into the parallel universe. Agent Broyles (Lance Reddick) provides a cover story of an unexpected controlled demolition to explain the disappearance of the hotel. Olivia later meets Peter at his house prior to their going out on a date, but when she arrives, she sees the same shimmer on Peter. Walter quietly asks Olivia not to tell Peter that he is from the other universe.

Wyman released a joint statement about its plot, \\"Along with the usual mystery, suspense, science and general wackiness, the episode contains one big answer, the consequences of which will affect our team for the remainder of the season and beyond.\\" Stentz later explained in the DVD audio commentary that in \\"Jacksonville by and large, the fringe event is Olivia. Olivia realizing that even in chasing all of these fringe events, she is the biggest fringe event of them all.\\" Also in the commentary, Pinkner added that for the episode's final scene, \\"We knew it would be in the back third of the season that we would really acknowledge for Olivia that Peter came from the Other Side. The worst circumstance that could happen in is at a moment when they are getting as close together as possible\\". Commenting on Peter's secret origins affecting their relationship, actress Anna Torv stated in an interview with Digital Spy that \\"Jacksonville\\" is \\"the episode that pushes us forward with a huge amount of momentum towards the end of the season. It all gets mixed up and then you find out what the drive is behind all of this. It's the big spanner in the works! The secret definitely has a huge impact on the lives of everyone involved.\\" \\"Jacksonville\\" was the first episode of Fox's initiative with Science Olympiad to release lesson plans for grade school students. Each lesson would relate to the week's particular science; in \\"Jacksonville\\"'s case, the intention was for \\"Students [to] learn about earthquakes of different magnitudes, as well as their impact on buildings and how it can be mitigated.\\" Jeff Pinkner commented, \\"Everything we do is grounded in some version of authentic fringe science and what scientists believe is possible,\\" and was pleased to be a part of \\"anything that can help invest kids in learning.\\" Reception =Ratings= On its initial American broadcast on February 4, 2010, \\"Jacksonville\\" was watched by an estimated 7.76 million viewers, gaining a 2.8 ratings share for those aged 18‚Äì49. \\"Jacksonville\\" was the winter finale for the series, as the next episode did not air until April 1. =Reviews= \\"Jacksonville\\" premiered to generally positive reviews. James Poniewozik of Time Magazine called it \\"fine\\" and \\"well-acted\\", especially liking John Noble's performance. Noel Murray of The A.V. Club graded the episode an A-, explaining \\"I liked 'Jacksonville' for the way it plunged directly into the heart of the show's mythology for the first time in a while, and even if it didn't tell us much we didn't already know, having the story become more personal for our heroes served to create that unsettled feeling at which Fringe excels\\". Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly loved \\"Jacksonville\\", believing it to be a \\"tremendously moving, startling episode\\" and \\"one of [Fringes] finest hours\\". AOL TV writer Jane Boursaw particularly praised the scene of Olivia trying to comfort her younger self, and then confronting Walter over it. She also felt Olivia's loss of memory to be \\"interesting,\\" and became \\"practically gleeful\\" at her and Peter's near-kiss. Giving the episode an 8.0/10 rating, IGN's Ramsey Isler thought the episode wasn't \\"as hard-hitting as most of the previous 'mythology' episodes, but it still leaves a good impression\\". Isler enjoyed the \\"tense and intriguing\\" opening and ending of the episode, but kept waiting for more to happen in the middle. SFScope contributor Sarah Stegall called the opening \\"one of the best in the entire series\\" and \\"certainly the best television I've seen this year.\\" In addition, Stegall praised Olivia's dream sequence and subsequent accusation of Walter, the inclusion of Massive Dynamic as allies, Broyles' role as \\"support\\" rather than \\"the usual role of Plot Obstacle,\\" and the science behind the episode (\\"The very fact that we can have two different yet legitimate quantum physics explanations on a television drama is, in itself, cause for applause.\\"). She concluded her review by noting Anna Torv has made \\"the most progress\\" in her performance, evolving from \\"downright wooden in the first year\\" to \\"carrying the role with grace and strength.\\" Website blogger io9 listed \\"Jacksonville\\" as one of the \\"crucial\\" episodes new viewers must watch to get into the show.

Bates began the project in 2010 after becoming frustrated with the logistics of a band. Thanks to help from Alessandro Cortini, of Nine Inch Nails, he discovered the possibilities of producing music on a laptop and quickly set about building a new sound. In 2013, Bates released his self- titled album, Big Black Delta. The album contained a mixture of fresh material and songs released on BBDLP1. The album was released on Bates' own label, Masters of Bates, and was inspired by the soundtracks of Blade Runner and Solaris. It was positively received by critics and was compared by one reviewer to music from Muse and The Joy Formidable. Remixes of songs from the album have since come from Jimmy Edgar, John Tejada, Azari & III and Martyn. The video for \\"Side of the Road\\" was directed by Warren Kommers, inspired by Bates' love of astrophysics and astronomy. Big Black Delta has collaborated with a number of other artists such as War Widow, Alessandro Cortini, Susanne Sundf√∏r, Morgan Kibby, and Poison The Well drummer Chris Hornbrook, acting as touring drummer. He has received praise from Jay-Z on his blog, Life+Times, and played in support of Gary Numan, M83 and Jane's Addiction on their tours. In 2016, Big Black Delta released his third album, Tr√°game Tierra. The album was financed via PledgeMusic, a music focused crowdsourcing website, which allowed Big Blag Delta to release the album via his own label. Along with a copy of the album, fans could earn tickets to the a show on tour, a roll of film depicting the behind the scenes of the creation of the album along with other creative gifts for the donation given. The album contains collaborations with Debbie Gibson on \\"RCVR\\" and Kimbra on \\"Bitten by the Apple\\"; it was followed by a North American headlining tour. Big Black Delta's fourth album, the all instrumental WHORU812, was released on eOne Music Canada in June 2017. Prior to the album's release, Bates announced there would be only one live performance from Big Black Delta in 2017, to be played at The Viaduct in Los Angeles on July 14. Hit songs \\"Huggin & Kissin\\" and \\"Capsize\\" were used in the 2017 USA Network show The Sinner starring Jessica Biel. On January 31, 2020, Bates and fellow Los Angeles band Sego (who previously toured in support of Big Black Delta) released a split cover EP called \\"Quid Pro Quo,\\" that saw Sego covering the Big Black Delta song \\"Into The Night,\\" and Bates covering Sego's song \\"Shame.\\" The released this digitally and as a limited run of 500 flexi discs.

It was the largest pen manufacturer in the United States, having reached a record of producing 216,000,000 pens a year.Esterbrook history in Kamakura Pens website The company produced dip pens, then concentrating on fountain pens until it was acquired by Venus Pencils in 1967, ceasing activities in 1971. In 2014, Harpen Brand Holdings, LLC, acquired the rights to the \\"Esterbrook\\" brand name, releasing a series of pens. Four years later, the brand was purchased by Kenro Industries, which is its current owner and holder, manufacturing the Esterbrook pens in Kenro's plant of Mineola, New York. History =The beginning= Richard Esterbrook, founder Richard Esterbrook (1812-1895 History of Esterbrook pens) was a Cornish Quaker from England who saw an opportunity in the United States to manufacture steel pens. In 1856 he traveled to the US to set up shop as \\"The Steel Pen Manufacturing Company\\". In 1858 he was able to establish himself as the sole pen manufacturer in the USA and changed the company name to \\"The Esterbrook Steel Pen Mfg. Co.\\", with just 15 employees in Camden, New Jersey. At the time, two of the four pen companies located in the United States were situated in Camden. Besides Esterbrook, the first in the country, the C. Howard Hunt Pen Company at 7th and State streets produced pens, pencil sharpeners and allied products and employed 125 workers. At its height, the Esterbrook plant had 450 workers and produced 600,000 pens a day.Esterbrook pens on Blam! website There were no experienced pen- manufacturing workers in the U.S. and no broadly available machinery to produce the pens, so Esterbrook designed all processes in-house. Only 15 people made up the first payroll, but the growth of the company was steady. The buildings were added to from time to time, and in 1912 a five-story concrete building was erected that nearly doubled the size of the plant. Machines gradually replaced hand work and greatly increased output. = Development = The Esterbrook Pens Co. plant stood at Cooper Street and Delaware Avenue in Camden, New Jersey, c. 1920 Quality was a key factor in his success. Esterbrook's steel pens were versatile, long-lasting, and came in many different styles to fit the varied writing styles of the public. Sadly, Richard Esterbrook didn't see the \\"empire\\" his company was to become as he died in Atlanta on October 12, 1895. Just one year after his death, in 1896 the company started an Esterbrook branch in England to join the ranks of the other main pen manufactures in Birmingham. By 1920, the fountain pen was fast becoming more popular amongst people who were tired of dipping pens into ink, and the company manufactured its first fountain pen. By 1930 the company sought less expensive means of manufacturing pens, as gold and jewel tips were growing too expensive and in this same year they began selling fountain pens in England. The Esterbrook Company began using the metal Iridium, which they called \\"Durachrome\\", in their nibs. To meet the fountain pen demand the company reformed as \\"The Esterbrook Hazel Pens Ltd\\". In 1940 war had come to strike a blow at the Esterbrook company . = Decline = In 1947 Esterbrook bought out John Mitchell (which had been established in 1822 as the world's first manufacturer to cut nibs by machine) and then acquired Hazell Pen Co. The company re-formed again as \\"The Esterbrook Pen Company\\". Some time after that, Esterbrook ceased production of dip pen nibs permanently. The post war years had seen a decline particularly in the export trade to the traditional markets of the British Empire. As those countries gained independence due to American aid, they had more dollars to spend in the United States than pounds in the United Kingdom. Esterbrook continued to thrive until the beginning of 1960 when it started to see a decline in export trades with England. In 1967 the Esterbrook Empire was bought out by the Venus Pencil Company and thus the name changed to \\"Venus Esterbrook\\", which continued to produce replacement nibs for fountain pens. There were numerous administrative changes and moves and eventually their final base of operations was vacated in 1972, though the building still stands today. Venus Esterbrook would be finally taken over by Berol in 1971,Esterbrook history, Kamakura Pens website all Esterbrook operations ceased.History in the making on Esterbrook website, 10 Jul 2015Brief Outline of Esterbrook History on The Esterbrook Project = Revival = In 2014, Harpen Brand Holdings, LLC, acquired the rights to the \\"Esterbrook\\" brand name, registering it as \\"Esterbrook, est. 1858\\" (plus the phrase \\"America's Original Pen Company\\")ESTERBROOK, EST. 1858 AMERICA'S ORIGINAL PEN COMPANY Trademark Information, serial #86348022 on Trademarkia.com\\"Classic pen brand brought back from the dead\\" by Devin Loring, USA Today, 9 Feb 2015 and releasing a series of Esterbrook fountain and ballpoint pens,\\"America‚Äôs Original Pen Company‚Äù returns December 2014\\" on Esterbrook website, 15 Nov 2014 including new versions of classic Esterbrook models, such as the \\"Deluxe\\" fountain pen and the \\"J\\" ballpoint pen, both originally released in the 1950s.Products on Esterbrook website The brand was later acquired by Kenro Industries, Inc.Esterbrook's acquisition on Kenro Industries website, April 9, 2018About on Esterbrook Pens website, 21 Nov 2019 Since then, Kenro has manufactured and commercialised the Esterbrook products.

Personal  Meriva Carpenter was a daughter of Dr. Ruggles and Juliana (Pierce) Carpenter. On 27 February 1820 she married a cousin, Eli Carpenter, son of Dr. Eli and Abigail (Baker) Carpenter. They settled near the town of Homer, New York, in an area that came to be called Carpenterville, now East River, New York. Eli was a successful miller and dyer, and they were prosperous enough to build a fine house which they filled with art treasures. The artist Sanford Thayer painted portraits of Eli (displayed in the Phillips Library in Homer) and their son, Volney Carpenter. One of their children, daughter Marciana Melvina Carpenter, born December 2, 1820, was also an artist and a taxidermist. Meriva Carpenter is interred in Glenwood Cemetery, Homer, NY, the same cemetery where noted artist Francis Bicknell Carpenter, a distant cousin, portraitist of President Abraham Lincoln, is interred.

She was employed in anti-slave trade patrol from 1826 until 1834, when she was wrecked on a reef with the loss of 70 Africans who had been rescued from a slave ship.Swanson:131 O'Byrne:95-96 Background In 1818, the United Kingdom and Spain entered into a treaty forbidding the importation of slaves into Spanish territories. One provision of the treaty set up a Mixed Commission Court in Havana to deal with Spanish ships caught by the Royal Navy while trying to carry Africans to slavery in Cuba. A similar British-Portuguese court in Sierra Leone ruled on Portuguese slave ships caught by the Royal Navy. The Nimble was assigned to the squadron that the Royal Navy maintained on the approaches to Cuba to enforce the provisions of the treaty. Slave ships captured near Africa and their cargoes of Africans were taken to Sierra Leone for disposition. Spanish slave ships captured near Cuba were taken to Havana to be dealt with by the Mixed Commission Court, while Portuguese ships caught in Caribbean or North American waters had to be taken to Sierra Leone. Despite the efforts of the Royal Navy, large numbers of Africans continued to be carried to slavery in Cuba, in part because Spanish officials in Cuba were often complicit in the illegal slave trade. More than 64,000 Africans may have been illegally landed in Cuba between 1822 and 1829.Adderley:56-57 Swanson:3 Construction She was built in 1822 as the Gran Colombian schooner Bolivar. She may have been used as a slave ship at some point in her career. After the Magpie-class schooner Nimble (built by McLean of Jamaica) was rejected as unsatisfactory in 1826, the Royal Navy purchased Bolivar, renamed her Nimble, and assigned her to the Royal Navy's West Indies Squadron.The first arrival of emancipated blacks in Trinidad Swanson:4, 131 In Royal Navy service, Nimble carried four 18-pounder (8.2-kg) carronades and one 18-pounder cannon.Swanson:13 states that one source says \\"eight guns\\", while another says \\"two gunades and an 18-pounder on a swivel\\"; O'Byrne:96 states \\"5 guns\\". A letter from Lieutenant Bolton, dated \\"His Britannic Majesty's schooner Nimble, Havanna, 16 November 1833\\" states that the slave-schooner Joaquina received \\"two 8-pound shot between wind and water\\", so it seems likely that by 1833 Nimble had reduced her armament to 8-pounder long guns. Career From the records of slave ships captured, it is clear that Nimble was engaged in the interception of slavers throughout the years 1827 to 1834. On 19 December 1827, Nimble ran aground near the Florida Keys while engaged in a gun battle with the Spanish slave ship Guerrero. Guerrero sank and 41 Africans imprisoned in the hold drowned. The crew and 520 surviving Africans were rescued from Guerrero by wreckers. Spanish crew members from Guerrero hijacked two of the wrecking vessels and escaped to Cuba with 398 of the Africans. The remaining 120 Africans were taken to Key West. Nimble had lost her rudder when she went aground, but the wreckers helped Nimbles crew float her off the reef and fit the rudder from Guerrero on her.Shipwrecks of Tragedy: the Story of HMS Nimble and the Slave Runner, El Guerero Swanson:12-32 Viele:122-31, 146 She is recorded as salvaging the US vessel La Fayette on 13 May 1829. In June 1829, Nimble assisted after Monkey had captured the Spanish slave ship Midas near Bimini. Midas had left Africa in April 1829 with 562 Africans. Only 369 were still alive when Midas was captured by Monkey, and 72 more died (of \\"smallpox, diarrhea & scurvy\\") before Monkey and Nimble could take Midas to Havana.Swanson:10-11, 130-31 Lieutenant Joseph Sherer transferred from Monkey to Nimble. On 16 November 1829, Nimble captured the Spanish slave ship Gallito, carrying 16 crew and 136 Africans, near the Berry Islands, and took her to Havana.Parliamentary papers 1831:76-80 Head money for the 136 slaves was paid in 1831. Sherer was promoted to Commander on 29 December for his successes while captain of Monkey. On 13 July 1832, Nimble captured the Portuguese slave ship Hebe, which was carrying 401 \\"Angolans\\". The Africans were in such poor condition that they were deemed unfit for a voyage to Sierra Leone, and were kept in the Bahamas. At first settled on isolated Highburn Cay, many were later recruited into the West India Regiment and the rest were apprenticed to white Bahamians.Adderley: 56-57 Craton:9 Navy list, p. 169 In May 1833, Nimble captured the Spanish slave ship La Negrita, carrying 189 Africans. When Nimble tried to take the captured ship to Havana for disposition by the Mixed Commission Court, she was turned away because of a cholera epidemic in Cuba, and the Africans were taken to Trinidad.Adderley:245, 265 On 10 November 1833, Nimble captured the Spanish slave ship Joaquina, carrying 348 Africans, after a battle near the Isle of Pines. The Spanish captain and two captive Africans were killed in the battle (another African died later of his wounds), and Joaquina sank.Parliamentary papers 1835:66 Swanson:131 On 7 December 1833, Nimble captured the Spanish slave ship Manuelita, carrying a crew of 34 and 485 Africans, near the Isle of Pines.Parliamentary papers 1835:75-78, 80 In August 1834, Nimble captured a Portuguese slave ship carrying 162 Africans and delivered them to the Bahamas.Adderley:57 While under the command of Lieutenant Bolton from 24 February 1833 until the wreck, Nimble captured six slave vessels with a total of 1,902 Africans aboard.O'Byrne:95-96 Fate In November 1834, Nimble pursued the Spanish slave ship Carlota until she was wrecked on the Cuban coast. Nimble rescued 272 African slaves, which contributed to her wrecking. On the way to Havana, Nimble met bad weather, and on 4 November was driven onto a reef near Cay Verde on the north side of the Old Bahama Channel. The ship was lost and 70 of the Africans drowned. It was reported that the Africans in the hold were making so much noise that the crew could not hear the sound of the breakers on the reef. All her crew were saved,Gossett (1986), p.105. as were some 200 slaves. Nimbles captain, Lieutenant Charles Bolton, was cleared by a court martial of all blame in the wreck of the Nimble.Swanson:131 O'Byrne:95-96 Notes, citations, and references ;Notes ;Citations ;References *Adderley, Marion.

The Bandon Tanks were the only 4‚Äì6‚Äì0 tank locomotives to be built by Beyer, Peacock and Company. The class went on to serve with the CB&SCR;'s successors: the Great Southern Railways from 1925 and C√≥ras Iompair √âireann from 1945. The Bandon Tanks excelled due to their elegant design, high power output and compact wheel arrangement, which suited the track of the CB&SCR; network. Introduction and CB&SCR; service The 4‚Äì6‚Äì0T wheel arrangement was more typically found on narrow gauge lines, because the restricted bunker space (and resultant limited coal capacity) is less of a hindrance on the typically shorter journeys of such lines. A 4-6-2T wheel arrangement would have given more bunker space, but it would have been too long for the CB&SCR;'s turntables. The wheelbase was also short-coupled (close to each other) in order to manage the tight curves on the CB&SCR; lines. Each locomotive had capacity for two tons of coal and 1,100 gallons of water and weighed 56 tons 10 hundredweight. The first member of the class was 11 which was ordered in 1905, cost ¬£3,145 and was delivered in June 1906. The next to be built was 14, which was ordered in 1908, cost ¬£2,575 and was delivered in March 1909. These were followed by 15 in October 1910, 20 in July 1912 and 19 in June 1914. The CB&SCR; ordered no. 4 in April 1915 but First World War restrictions prevented Beyer, Peacock from completing and delivering it until October 1919. The two final members of the class were 8 and 13, which were delivered in November 1920. Post-war inflation had trebled the price of these final two locomotives to ¬£8,163 and ¬£9,163 respectively. Operationally the Bandon Tanks were small and powerful locomotives, well regarded apart from the cramped cab and the difficulty of cab access due to the rear wheel splashers. Despite the bunker size being limited by the 4‚Äì6‚Äì0T layout, Bandon Tanks had no difficulty covering distances on the CB&SCR; network, the greatest of which was between and Baltimore. GSR and CI√â service and withdrawal The GSR renumbered the class 463 ‚Äì 470 and later designated it Class B4. Between 1935 and 1947 the GSR rebuilt five of the class with type \\"R\\" Belpaire superheated boilers. The majority of the class continued to work on the former CB&SC; network, but in 1929 the GSR transferred 468 to Grand Canal Street depot in Dublin for suburban service on the former Dublin and South Eastern Railway main line between Dublin Westland Row and . In 1939 first 470 and then 466 were also transferred to Grand Canal Street. 469 replaced 466 on the Bray line for just over a year, from 1941 until 1942. 466 became the last Bandon Tank in service on the Bray line, remaining there until September 1956. 465 and 469 were withdrawn in 1945. CI√â withdrew 467 in 1959. CI√â withdrew 466, 468 and 470 in 1961, the year that it closed the former CB&SCR; network. 463 and 464 stayed in service until 1963, which was CI√â's final year of steam traction. Livery In CB&SCR; service the class was painted olive green with yellow lining. In CI√â service there was some variation in liveries. *466 was painted CI√â green in December 1948. *467 was a dark blue-green in 1953. *470 was a dark matt off-black in 1954 and 463 was the same in 1962. *464 appeared to be gloss black in 1961.

So they kindly requested then Guru of Kashi Mutt to offer a Temple for them. Guru Sri Bhuvanendra Thirtha blessed the people of Kanhangad with idol of Laxmi Venkatesh of Innoli which the people of Innoli gave to him earlier as they were in such poverty that they were not able to offer Nivedya to God. The Chowguli families that is, the four families attributed to construction of the temple consisted of families of Subraya Kamath, Ramachandra Nayak, Narayana Kamath and Sheshagiri Kamath. It is said that the whole construction of temple was by the people of the community without any workers outside the community. Subraya Kamath's Family offered the land for the temple. Thus his family becomes the Muli family who are believed to inform the people the god's will through oracle referred as Darshan. As the Innoli people returned the deity to Swamiji due to large amount of Naivedya which they were not able to offer, Swamiji is believed to offer special prayers so that he had requested God to be satisfied with whatever Naivedya the people of Kanhangad are able to offer and give quadruple amount of blessings in return.

It is based on the true story of disgraced lawyer Andrew Fraser. In New Zealand it screens on Prime Television. Background Australian Born in Melbourne in 1951, for thirty years Fraser was one of Australia‚Äôs leading criminal lawyers. He defended underworld families the Moran‚Äôs and the Pettingills, businessman Alan Bond, and footballer Jimmy Krakauer. With success came cocaine addiction ending in 1999 with Fraser being charged with being knowingly concerned with an importation of cocaine, serious charges that received no mercy. This was the end of life as Fraser had known. He admitted himself into hospital and withdrew from use. This was the start of the long road to recovery, remaining drug free for the two years he was on bail and has remained so ever since. Fraser pleaded guilty and received a crushing sentence in 2001; seven years imprisonment with a minimum of five. Despite being a low risk prisoner, Fraser was sent to a maximum-security housing thirty-eight of the most dangerous criminals in Victoria. During that period Fraser heard most disturbing tales from Australia‚Äôs most notorious prisoners. Nothing could prepare him for the shock that is maximum security.  Television series  Killing Time is a television mini-series based on Fraser's experiences. It was produced in 2009 by FremantleMedia, TV1 and Film Victoria.Controversial TV1 series Killing Time to screen in November David Wenham portrays Fraser in the series. =Overview= Andrew Fraser is a lawyer who defends high profile clients such as Dennis Allen, Jimmy Krakouer, Alan Bond and those accused of the Walsh Street murders.

For a full list of former state highways in Indiana, see the List of former state highways in Indiana.  State Road 200  State Road 200 (SR 200) ran between SR 9/SR 67 and OH 200. In 1931 SR 200 was routed on the modern route of U.S. Route 36 (US 36) between SR 227 and OH 200. The state highway commission planned to continue the road west toward Pendleton at SR 9 and SR 67. Once this roadway was built the entire length of SR 200 became part of US 36.  State Road 202  State Road 202 ran between U. S. Route 231 and State Road 53.  State Road 209  State Road 209 ran just east of and parallel to State Road 9 in Hancock County. It connected US Highway 40 to State Road 234.  State Road 210  State Road 210 circled Bass Lake.  State Road 216  State Road 216 ran from State Road 316 to Bluffton Camp State Park.  State Road 219  State Road 219 was a state highway on the St. Joseph/Elkhart County line along Ash Road. It ran from U.S. Highway 33 in the south to U.S. Highway 20 in the north, a total traversal of about . US 20 and US 33 no longer intersect Ash Road. They have been replaced by Business 20 and State Road 933 on the St. Joseph County side, and Old US 20 and Old US 33 on the Elkhart County side. The State Road 219 designation was removed on May 21, 1999, as part of highway maintenance transfers stemming from the opening of the nearby St. Joseph Valley Parkway.  State Road 220  State Road 220 ran from the just west of the intersection of U.S. Route 20 and State Road 2 though Rolling Prairie and then back to US 20\\\\. The route is now county roads.  State Road 221  State Road 221 was commissioned in 1932 between Matthews at SR 21 and SR 18, with an extension to Huntington in 1933. In 1972, SR 221 was removed between Matthews and SR 18, as was the section between SR 218 and Huntington. The last part of SR 221 was removed in 1975. In 1986, the road between SR 22 and SR 218 became a state road again when SR 5 was extended from Warren to SR 22 near Upland.  State Road 223  State Road 223 was a northeast-southwest state highway in Saint Joseph County, Indiana. It was about long. SR 223 began from the south at one of its parent routes, State Road 23. It followed the Crumstown Highway north through Crumstown. North of that town, the road turned northeast and headed toward the southwest side of South Bend. As it passed under the St. Joseph Valley Parkway (U.S. Highway 20/U.S. Highway 31 bypass), it turned due east onto Grant Road, and then terminated after almost a mile at its other parent, State Road 123, now known solely as Mayflower Road. Grant Road continues east from here as West Sample Street. SR 223 has since been turned back to the county, and Crumstown Highway is still in use as a county road.  State Road 230  =First routing= A reroute of SR 14 replaced SR 230\\\\. This routing of SR 14 was later removed. =Second routing= State Road 230 followed a former alignment of US 30 (New Haven Avenue and Coliseum Boulevard) on the southeast side of Fort Wayne after US 30 was transferred to the roads later designated as SR 930.  State Road 231  State Road 231 became SR 131, until SR 131 was decommissioned in 2002 State Route 238 State Road 238 was a State Route that connected Noblesville and Fortville. In the 2000s, SR 238 was truncated from its junction with SR 37 to Interstate 69 (I-69), and in 2011, the route was removed entirely. =Routing Changes= The route east of I-69 is now known as Greenfield Avenue. The portion west of I-69 was routed along Campus Parkway and Greenfield Avenue. A portion of the former routing now sits unused west of the Cabela Parkway light and east of the Bowden Ave / Greenfield Avenue light. In the early 2000s, the route was rerouted along 146th Street.  State Road 259   State Road 266  State Road 266 is now known as Washington Avenue in Evansville.  State Road 303   State Road 311   State Road 313  State Road 313 is now known as Elkhart County Road 33, CR 33 is not related to U.S. Route 33  State Road 316   State Road 318  State Road 318 is now a county road.  State Road 319  State Road 319 was an Indiana state road in Elkhart County. It was a very short north-south route connecting U.S. Highway 20 to State Road 120 along Middleton Run Road in the east side of Elkhart. US 20 no longer reaches Middleton Run Road. US 20 was routed south of the city on the St. Joseph Valley Parkway, bypassing it, and consequently, SR 120 was truncated to Middleton Run Road after State Road 319 was decommissioned. State Road 324  State Road 324 was the northern east-west section of SR 930\\\\.  State Road 329  State Road 329 is a state road in Cass County, Indiana. Its original routing was a connector from State Road 29's northern terminus at the U.S. Highway 24/U.S. Highway 35 bypass south of the city of Logansport to State Road 17's southern terminus at Business Route 24 and State Road 25 downtown. Currently State Road 329 exists as a short connector route between State Road 29 and US 24 / US 35 / State Road 25 / State Road 29 interchange. As part of the Logansport By-Pass construction. The original last 1/3 of a mile alignment of State Road 29 was shifted to the northwest for continuity purposes to streamline traffic coming from US 24 / US 35 / State Road 25 (western half of the new interchange) to State Road 29 and eventually onward toward US 421 and Indianapolis. This shift necessitated a new route number that became State Road 329 and coincidentally starts / ends just short of the original State Road 329‚Äôs 1985 to 1999 Routing. From the south, its route followed Burlington Avenue north to East Cliff Drive, where its name then changes to South 3rd Street as it rounds a curve. This is two blocks north of the northwestern terminus of the former State Road 435. SR 329 then terminated at Market Street, the current route of eastbound traffic on Business 24/SR 25. To go westbound, traffic is routed one block farther north via the start of SR 17 onto East Broadway Street.  State Road 330  State Road 330 was an old alignment of US 30 and also of the Lincoln Highway.  State Road 334  State Road 334 in the U.S. state of Indiana was a six-mile (10 km) route in southeastern Boone County. Its western terminus was Interstate 65 and its eastern terminus was at US 421 State Road 334 was decommissioned by the Indiana Department of Transportation in the summer of 2011 and turned over to local units of government. The portion within the Town of Whitestown was turned over to it and the portion within the Town of Zionsville was turned over to it. The bridges along the route were turned over to Boone County.http://dothemod.indy.com/posts/state-gives-zionsville-control- of-5-mile-section-of-ind-334-2  State Road 343  State Road 343 ran from Indiana 43 in Cloverdale west to Indiana 243. It ran for 4.1 miles. The road is now known as Robert Weist Avenue in Cloverdale.  State Road 345  State Road 345 connected the small communities of Lincoln City and Dale in Spencer County. The southern terminus was at State Road 162 at the entrances to both the Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial and Lincoln State Park. Its northern terminus was at U.S. 231 and State Road 62 south of Dale. This intersection was relocated a short distance south when the new-terrain U.S. 231 was built. Today, former State Road 345 is Spencer County Road 300 East. It is, at least at its southern terminus, signed as part of the Lincoln Heritage Trail which was designated in the 1960s in Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky.  State Road 346  State Road 346 followed a part of 17th Street and Dunn Street in Bloomington, connecting State Road 46.  State Road 367  State Road 367 was a short highway located in Marion County during the 1930s and 1960s, routed primarily along Pendleton Pike and Massachusetts Avenue. Its northern terminus was the junction with U.S. 36 and S.R. 67 at 38th Street and Pendleton Pike, and its southern terminus was the junction with U.S. 31 in downtown Indianapolis at Meridian Street.

Created by Ben Jones, it follows Alfe, Roba, and Horace, a group of detectives in their troubled town, Farboro. The aforementioned characters were designed while Jones attended college in the 1990s; he later founded the art collective Paper Rad with Jessica and Jacob Ciocci. The characters were featured in Jones' and the collective's animations and comics before the creator pitched a pilot to Adult Swim featuring the trio. The network's executives referred Jones to Cartoon Network, who commissioned a series featuring the same characters. The series was produced in Adobe Flash, with around fifteen animators employed at Cartoon Network Studios and the co- production of Mirari Films. The Problem Solverz was first aired on April 4, 2011. The first season consisted of eighteen episodes, concluding on September 29, 2011. A second and final season was released exclusively on Netflix in 2013. Plot From left to right: Horace, Alfe, and Roba, the main characters of the series The series follows the eponymous detectives Alfe (Ben Jones), Roba (also Jones), and Horace (Kyle Kaplan). The trio take up solving, and sometimes creating, the numerous problems that plague their town, Farboro. To their aid is Tux Dog (John DiMaggio), an extremely wealthy dog who helps the Solverz in some of their cases but is just as often the source of their problems. Alfe (pronounced Alf√©) is a large, fluffy, man‚Äìdog‚Äìanteater found and raised by Horace when both were young. He loves devouring large quantities of food, especially pizza and hamburgers, and acts impulsively during missions. Roba, Horace's twin brother and cyborg, is the smartest member of the group, but he suffers from insecurity and anxiety. Horace is the calm and collected leader of the team, usually applying common sense with his detective work and caring after Alfe. Development =Conception= Growing up in Pittsburgh, creator Ben Jones had an appreciation for comics and animation. His father's Macintosh computer served as a vehicle for Jones to create art and influenced his later visual style. Jones attended the Massachusetts College of Art and Design in the mid-1990s, where he became motivated to launch a project he could adapt to different media. This impetus manifested itself in the characters Alfe, Horace, and Roba. Tux Dog, another principal character, was designed while Jones was in primary school. After his graduation, Jones formed the art collective Paper Rad with Jessica and Jacob Ciocci in 2000. The collective moved that year to Providence, Rhode Island, to participate in the Fort Thunder music venue. After the venue's closure in 2001, Jones released animations on the Web using Adobe Flash, with some featuring Alfe. Paper Rad later produced animations with the premise of The Problem Solverz but with the three principal characters absent. The collective's 2006 direct-to-DVD release Trash Talking features a segment called \\"Gone Cabin \\" in which Alfe, Horace, and Roba appear. In tandem with these experiments, Jones worked as a television animator on Yo Gabba Gabba! and Wonder Showzen. The year of the DVD's release, Jones talked to Nick Weidenfeld, then an executive producer at Adult Swim, about an idea for a series of his own. The result was Neon Knome, a pilot produced by PFFR Productions and Williams Street in 2008, and released on Adult Swim's website two years later as part of a development contest sponsored by Burger King. After deciding the show's aesthetics were not a good fit for Adult Swim, the network's executives later referred Jones to Cartoon Network, believing his creativity would fit better there. Jones agreed to do business with Cartoon Network on the condition that Alfe be a character on The Problem Solverz. =Production= Farboro, the setting of the series, features vibrant art. Eric Pringle, a veteran of 2D digital animation, was employed as animation director, providing Jones with much technical assistance. Pringle's colleagues from Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, another Cartoon Network production, comprised a team of around fifteen full-time animators at the network's studio, all working on Apple computers. Greg Miller was hired as supervising director, Martin Cendreda as technical director, and John Pham with Jon Vermilyea as character designers. Miller is the creator of Whatever Happened to... Robot Jones?, another series on the network. Vermilyea worked also as a character designer on the network's series Adventure Time, while Cendreda, Pham, and Jones all contributed to the anthology comic book Kramers Ergot. Michael Yank was employed as a writer for most episodes, with Mirari Films' CEO Eric Kaplan supervising the creation of scripts. The series was noted for its visual style employing highly saturated colors and varying shapes. Jones was inspired by the limited-animated series Roger Ramjet and The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show, which he felt employed good character design, cohesiveness, jokes, and timing. He credited The Problem Solverz as the first seamless use of Flash for television animation, with conceptualization and the end result occurring in the same program. Writing was the longest aspect of production, taking up to several months for the crew to conceive the story and draft a script. Animation was comparatively quicker, with the team delivering work in only a few weeks given the digital approach; Jones felt that the animators could to play to the strengths of the fully digital animation process.

The first season concluded on September 29, 2011, after eighteen episodes. A second season consisting of eight episodes was released exclusively on Netflix in 2013. Reception Criticism of The Problem Solverz was directed at the visual style and writing. Rob Owen writing for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette called the style reminiscent of Atari 5200 video games and wrote that viewers could \\"thank\\" or \\"blame\\" Jones for his creation. For the magazine Variety, Brian Lowry disregarded the series as uninteresting and challenging to watch, the visuals and sounds weird for weirdness' sake. Emily Ashby of Common Sense Media defined the series as misguided, its stories as undeveloped, and its visual style as unappealing. The Weekly Alibis Devin D. O'Leary acknowledged the style as Paper Rad's own and found the writing more solid than that of Adult Swim's programming for which it could be mistaken. The jokes were not instantly funny according to O'Leary, but the visual style combined with the writing would provide amusement for Paper Rad's existing fans. Art-related publications, on the other hand, gave praise to Jones' creativity. Dan Nadel, a former publisher of Jones, lauded the series in The Comics Journal for the imagination displayed, \\"funny and humane and invaluable\\" at the same time. Paper writer Sammy Harkham called The Problem Solverz \\"radical\\" and unlike any other series on television. Geek Exchange writer Liz Ohanesian called the second season more \\"subdued\\" than the first, allowing viewers to concentrate on the principal character's relationships. She compared the series to the band Anamanaguchi, in that its unique and polarizing style makes fans of the series hard to find.

It was created by the Texas Education Service Center Curriculum Collaborative (TESCCC). Use Nineteen out of twenty education regions in Texas have districts that use CSCOPE, and as of January 2, 2011 there were 747 school districts (out of 1,051 total) using it. Reactions While popular with district administrators, CSCOPE has elicited mixed reactions from teachers, some of whom feel excessively constrained by a set timetable for lessons. Other teachers, however, feel that CSCOPE is appreciated by the students and has improved classroom performance and attendance. Some say that CSCOPE will better help prepare districts for the next generation of standardized tests in Texas, such as the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness test. The system is a product of an increased emphasis on accountability in public education over the last two decades. Upcoming changes In 2013, after complaints about parents' inability to access the curriculum as well as about lesson plans, Texas announced significant changes would be made to the system. These changes include: * Making all meetings of the governing board public, and meeting all the respective notice requirements. * A joint review process of all CSCOPE lessons, beginning with Social Studies. * Removing civil or criminal penalties associated with the release of CSCOPE content. * Allowing teachers to post any and all CSCOPE lessons that they deem necessary. * Creating a standing curriculum review panel composed of parents, teachers, and school administrators.

Education  The block lacks robust educational infrastructure. There is only one college which provides graduation level degree. Kalawati Degree College which provides graduation level degree is situated on Raniganj-Forbesganj Road. The college is affiliated with B N Mandal university, Madhepura. There are two more colleges which provide Intermediate level degree. There are few government high schools which are situated in the Market. Laljee High School, BLD High school, Kalawati Girls high school are famous of them. There are few other private schools mainly situated in the market area. These schools are trying hard to impart quality education. Despite lacking qualitative educational infrastructure students from here are competing very well in national level and state level exams. Many students have been selected in banking, railway and other government services.  Tourism  However, there are not many tourist recreational places are developed in the Block. A newly developed Vriksh Vakita (forest area) was inaugurated by then chief minister of Bihar Sri Nitish Kumar. The Vakita was developed by consolidating sparse forest area on Raniganj- Forbesganj road. The vakita has a large pond. The vakita is attracting large number of people nowadays especially on holiday or on some important occasions.  Transport  Raniganj is well connected by road to district and commissionaire headquarters. It has a designated bus stand situated at Raniganj-Araria road. It does not have any railway station. The nearest railway station is Araria RS. The station is a very small and doesn't have stoppage of super fast trains. Araria which is around 30 km from the Raniganj Block is connected to New Delhi by Seemanchal Experess. The train runs on daily basis. The Araria court station is also connected with Kolkata by Kolkata-Jogbani Express. Nowadays many transport vehicles are passing through Raniganj market towards Jogbani and finally Nepal. Big transport vehicles are also made their ways through the market for saving toll charges. They cause huge traffic jam in the market.

The regiment specialises in mountain warfare, and its primary role is to guard India's borders in the high altitudes of the union territory of Ladakh. Raised by Colonel S.P. Salunke, the Ladakh Scouts were converted into an Army regiment in 2000. The Ladakh Scouts recruits mainly from India's Ladakhi and Tibetan ethnic communities, and is among the army's most decorated units. Its soldiers have been honored with over 300 gallantry awards and citations including a Unit citation, one Ashok Chakra, ten Maha Vir Chakras and two Kirti Chakras. History In 1948, the \\"Nubra Guards\\" were raised from local Ladakhi warriors to patrol India's mountainous border in the Ladakh region. In 1952, the Nubra Guards were merged as the 7th Battalion, Jammu & Kashmir Militia (which itself later became the Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry). The 14th Battalion of the militia was also raised from Ladakh in 1959. On 1 June 1963, following the Sino-Indian War of 1962, the Ladakh Scouts was formed by spinning off the 7th and 14th Battalions of the J&K; Militia, and the unit was given the role of reconnaissance and interdiction in the high-altitude border regions by the Government of India. After the Kargil War, the Ladakh Scouts was reformed as a standard infantry regiment on 1 June 2000. Its parent regiment is the Jammu & Kashmir Rifles, but it trains and fights as an independent unit for all intents and purposes. On 2 June 2013, it celebrated its Golden Jubilee to mark the merger between the Nubra Guards and the 7th Battalion of the J&K; light infantry. =Units= The regiment currently consists of 5 battalions, with support personnel affiliated to other arms of the Indian army seconded in on rotation. Recent Engagements =Indo-Pakistani Wars of 1965 and 1971= Units of the regiment have been deployed in combat in every major Indian operation since the Indo- Pakistan War of 1965. The Scouts also received battle honours in the undeclared western theatre of the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971 which led to the independence of East Pakistan. =Operation Meghdoot= Units of the Ladakh Scouts were deployed with 3 rd Kumaon Rifles to capture the Siachen Glacier in April 1984, as a part of Operation Meghdoot. =Kargil War= The Ladakh Scouts were one of the first units to be deployed in combat action for Operation Vijay. Its units displayed exemplary gallantry and won numerous awards, including a Maha Vir Chakra for Major Sonam Wangchuk. The Scouts were awarded a Unit Citation for their gallantry during the battles of Point 5000 on 5-6 July 1999, Dog Hill on the night 30 June-1 July, and Padma Go on 9-10 July 1999, in the Batalik Sector.

Tauris publication by Istanbul Technical University Associate Professor Asuman Suner which examines the emergence of the new wave Turkish cinema, including both commercial and independent productions, against the backdrop of the drastic transformation undergone by Turkey since the mid-1990s and how these films persistently return to the themes of belonging, identity and memory. The book, which was published on , is an extensively revised and re-written update of an earlier edition published by Metis Press, Istanbul, in 2006. Content =Introduction= The author briefly outlines the history of Turkish cinema in order to place the emergence of new Turkish cinema in into historical and cultural context. =Chapter 1: Popular Nostalgia Films= New popular Turkish films focusing on the provincial small-town life of the past, which voice a critique of modern Turkish society through an idealized representation of the past as a time of collective childhood, are discussed by the author, who finds this critique problematic, however, as it renders society unaccountable for the events of the past and alleviates it from the burden of responsibility.

It is a motile, gram-positive, aerotolerant anaerobe. C. histolyticum is pathogenic in many species, including guinea pigs, mice, and rabbits, and humans. C. histolyticum has been shown to cause gas gangrene, often in association with other bacteria species. History In 1916, Weinberg and S√©guin isolated this bacterium from patients with gas gangrene and called it Bacillus histolyticus. They discovered this bacterium was pathogenic for guinea pigs, mice, and rabbits, but less so for rats. Intramuscular injection of culture caused extensive local tissue destruction, extrusion of a hemorrhagic muscle pulp, splitting of the skin, denudation of the bone, and sometimes autoamputation. In 1922, Heller renamed the bacterium Weinbergillus histolyticus, and a year later Bergey, Harrison, et al. reclassified it as Clostridium histolyticum. Microbiology Clostridium histolyticum can be isolated from soil during the early stage of soil cultivation, by heating the sample at 60 ¬∞C for 30 minutes. C. histolyticum can be plated on Zeissler plate agar, and appear as dewlike colonies of either rough or smooth morphology, surrounded by a zone of weak hemolysis. On blood agar, colonies appear small, rough, irregularly round, and are surrounded by a zone of weak hemolysis. These bacteria tend to clump in pairs or short chains and are rods of 3-5Œºm x 0.5-0.7Œºm. Cells are richly flagellate and very motile. Clostridium histolyticum produces large endospores and are asaccharolytic and proteolytic. This bacterium is anaerobic, however minimal growth may be obtained through aerobic culture. Clostridium histolyticum is difficult to culture because growth is inhibited by sugars, and spores are not very heat resistant. In wound smears, C. histolyticum closely resembles C. perfringens, but without the capsule of C. perfringens. This may interfere with diagnosis of C. histolyticum infection. Toxigenicity Studies have shown that the toxigenicity of a strain of Clostridium histolyticum is directly related to its sporulating potency: the higher the sporulating potency, the more toxigenic the strain. Additionally, toxigenic strains possess a stronger potential for growth than less toxigenic or nontoxigenic strains. Smooth substrains of C. histolyticum seem to show higher toxigenicity than rough substrains. Toxins of C. histolyticum Clostridium histolyticum produces five toxins: alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and epsilon. =Alpha-toxin= The alpha-toxin is the major toxigenic factor of C. histolyticum. When injected into muscle, it can cause death in laboratory animals within hours. Alpha- toxin is a necrotizing, but not hemolytic, toxin. This toxin is secreted, as it is isolated from filtrates of C. histolyticum cultures. It is neutralized by antisera produced against toxic filtrates of C. septicum cultures through cross-neutralization. Additionally, alpha-toxin is readily inactivated by proteolytic enzymes. It has been shown that only about 29% of C. histolyticum strains isolated from soil actually produce this alpha-toxin. =Beta-toxin= The beta-toxin of C. histolyticum is a group of seven collagenases. Collagenases are zinc metalloproteases that cleave collagen and gelatin into small fragments. The seven collagenases are alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, zeta, and eta. They are further identified by their molecular masses (68, 115,79,110, 125, and 130 kDa, respectively) to distinguish them from the five toxins. Beta-toxin plays a major role in the pathogenicity of C. histolyticum, due to its ability to destroy collagen fibers in the body and cause necrosis. Beta-toxin has been shown to induce hemorrhage when placed on the surface of lungs of animals, hemorrhage and edema when injected into rat paws, and lethal intrapulmonary hemorrhage when injected intravenously into animals. =Gamma-toxin= Gamma-toxin is a cysteine-activated proteinase that digests hide powder, gelatin, and casein. It is not active against collagen. The molecular weight of gamma-toxin is 50,000 Da. =Delta-toxin= Delta- toxin is an elastase activated by Ca2+ ions. This proteolytic enzyme is inhibited by cysteine and reversibly inactivated by reducing agents. The molecular weight is between 10 and 50 kDa. =Epsilon-toxin= Epsilon-toxin is an oxygen-labile hemolysin similar to the Œ∏-toxin of C. perfringens and the Œ¥-toxins of C. septicum, and C. novyi. Proteinases Toxigenic strains of C. histolyticum secrete proteinases and collagenases that can degrade and necrotize organs and muscles in the human body. Clostridium histolyticum proteinases, including gamma- and delta-toxin, digest native and denatured proteins to amino acids with the production of ammonia. They can also clot milk and later digest the clot, and hemolyze sheep blood. The proteinases are capable of digesting burn eschars, and may be useful for removal of burn tissue from wounds. By themselves, the C. histolyticum proteinases gamma-toxin and delta-toxin are not active in the human body. It seems they only attack collagenous material already partially degraded by the beta-toxin, and aid in the nutrition of C. histolyticum. C. histolyticum proteinases are unique in their efficiency of converting tissue proteins to amino acids and peptides. Further, these enzymes are unique in that they do not produce isoacids (isobutyric acid and isocaproic acid) as metabolic end products. Collagenase Collagenase clostridium histolyticum is secreted by the bacterium and can destroy connective tissue of muscles. This collagenase has been used to treat Dupuytren's contracture, a disease of pathological collagen production and deposition in the hands. This disease causes flexion contractures of the joints, severely limiting hand function, most often in the ring and little fingers. Studies have shown that injection of collagenase clostridium histolyticum significantly reduces the contractures by lysing the collagen and disrupting the contracted cords. This treatment has restored contractured fingers to full extension 30 days after the last injection in 64% of joints injected with collagenase costridium histolyticum. Side effects are mild, and this treatment is preferred to surgical options because no extensive hand therapy is required post-treatment. Collagenase clostridium histolyticum is manufactured and marketed by Endo Pharmaceuticals in the US, and marketed by SOBI in the EU Auxilium / SOBI agreement, and by Actelion in Canada and Australia Auxilium / Actelion agreement. Role in disease Clostridium histolyticum secretes potent exotoxins that have proteolytic and necrotizing properties, causing severe local necrosis. However, there have been few cases of human infection by this species. From 1984 to 2004, only one case of C. histolyticum necrotizing infection was reported, in an agricultural worker with a crushed-hand injury. In 2000, an 18-year-old female drug user in Turkey was diagnosed with infective endocarditis caused by C. histolyticum. This was the first documented case where this bacterium has been identified as the cause of infective endocarditis. All diagnostic tests in this case were negative or normal until an anaerobic blood culture identified C. histolyticum as the infectious agent isolated from the heart valve tissue. A 2002 study of the intestinal flora of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients found that in patients who had ulcerative colitis, a form of IBD, 21% of the total bacteria in the colon were Clostridium histolyticum. Control specimen did not contain this species at all. In healthy adults, the amount of clostridia species in the feces is rarely higher than 106 cells/g feces, less than 1% of the total flora. This suggests that C. histolyticum may play a role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis as putative pathogens. In 2004, there was an outbreak of C. histolyticum infections in necrotic lesions in 11 injecting drug users in England and Scotland. All patients were heroin users, and had injected the drug into the muscle rather than a vein. It was thought that C. histolyticum spores had contaminated a batch of heroin early in production, and survived the production process before being distributed across the United Kingdom. =Diagnosis and treatment of infection= C. histolyticum can cause gas gangrene, an acute infection of pain, fever, myonecrosis, and massive edema. If not controlled, the infection can result in systemic toxemia, multiorgan failure, and even death. Further, this infection can progress to life-threatening in a matter of hours. While gas gangrene is easily diagnosed by the visible necrosis and characteristic smell, identifying Clostridium histolyticum as the causative agent is more difficult. With the exception of protein tests, all commonly used culture tests are negative. There is little or no gas production, and this bacterium is negative for lecithinase and lipase reactions. Anaerobic blood cultures are necessary for identification of C. histolyticum infection. For most infections, clindamycin and penicillin treatment is recommended. Further, a cocktail of antimicrobials targeting aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria may be used in necrotizing infections caused by multiple species, including C. histolyticum. C. histolyticum is also susceptible to metronidazole and imipenem. However, advanced gas gangrene infections caused by C. histolyticum may only be treatable through amputation of the infected limb.

Northwest Airlines was founded on August 1, 1926, flying a Curtiss Oriole and a Thomas Morse Biplane on the CAM-9 Airmail route from Minneapolis to Chicago. Admiral Byrd selected a Curtiss Oriole as his backup aircraft for his Fokker on his North Pole expedition. One was shipped on the steamer Chantier in case the Fokker was unavailable. A leased Curtiss Oriole was deployed by the 109th Observation Squadron in 1921. The aircraft was flown to Washington D.C. to lobby for Minnesota Air Guard funding. One Curtiss Oriole were sold to Brazilian Naval Aviation in 1926. Syd (brother of Charlie) Chaplin Air Line used Curtiss Oriole(s) for its one year of operation in 1920.

One example with this modification and a 150 hp Hispano-Suiza upgrade, was entered in the 1927 National Air Races. Before the races, the engine was upgraded again to a Hispano-Suiza 220 hp engine, which overwhelmed the cooling system with metal shavings, causing the aircraft to drop out of the race.

He conducted the first Christian service in New Zealand.John Dunmore. 'Surville, Jean Fran√ßois Marie de - Biography', from the Dictionary of New Zealand Biography. Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand, updated 1-Sep-10 He was the chaplain of French navigator and explorer Jean- Fran√ßois-Marie de Surville when de Surville, in his ship, the Saint Jean Baptiste, sighted the North Island of New Zealand in 1769. De Surville remained two weeks in Doubtless Bay, near Whatuwhiwhi, where Villefeix celebrated the first Mass in New Zealand waters on Christmas Day 1769. Early life Parish church of √âtouars Villefeix was born near √âtouars in Perigord. One of his brothers, L√©onard de Lestang, was also a priest, himself becoming parish priest of √âtouars.Michael King, God's Farthest Outpost: A History Of Catholics In New Zealand, Penguin Books, Auckland, 1997, p. 73. Chaplain Villefeix was invited by the Surville family to be the chaplain for an expedition to the South Pacific on the ship Saint Jean Baptiste led by navigator and explorer Jean-Fran√ßois-Marie de Surville. In December 1769 the ship arrived in Doubtless Bay and a landing was made at Rangiaohia on the Karikari Peninsula where Father Villefeix went ashore, unaccompanied by fellow crew members, and wandered through one of the villages. He presided over eight burials in Doubtless Bay. Nearly half of Surville's crew members died on the voyage. Unlike Captain James Cook, he was not able to combat scurvy. First Mass in New Zealand Villefeix was the first Christian minister to set foot on New Zealand, pre-dating Samuel Marsden by forty-four years; and he was the first ordained minister to lead a Christian service there. As a priest he was required to say Mass on Sundays and holy days of obligation (of which Christmas Day 1769, when Saint John Baptiste was still in Doubtless Bay, was one). Villefeix is also recorded as leading prayers for the sick on Christmas Eve and for burials in Doubtless Bay. South America In April 1770, the Surville expedition reached Peru and Captain Surville was drowned while trying to land through surf on a beach. Seventeen months later, in 1771, while the Saint Jean-Baptiste was being held by Spanish authorities in Callao, Surville's nephew and Villefeix left the ship to go goldmining up a river. Parish priest Villefeix returned to France and he too became parish priest at his home town, √âtouars, where he died in 1780, aged 52.

Life Maria Rosa Coccia was born in Rome and studied with Sante Pesci. At the age of 13, Coccia composed six sonatas for harpsichord and the oratorio Daniello, which was performed the same year in the Oratory S. Filippo Neri, in defiance of a tradition that women were not allowed to attend the event. In 1716 Pope Clement XI had decreed that anyone practicing music in Rome must enter the Accademia di Santa Cecilia and pass the exam to become Maestro di Capella. At 16 Coccia passed the exam and received the title, but because of her gender was never allowed to execute the duties of the position, though her music was performed. As a practicing composer, she was admitted to Rome's Accademia de' Forti. In 1780 Maestro di Cappella Francesco Capalti of Narni Cathedral attacked Coccia‚Äôs examination composition and her receipt of the title. She was defended by Michele Mallio in his Elogio storico della signora Maria Rosa Coccia romana (Rome, 1780), containing letters of support from Metastasio, Carlo Broschi and Giovanni Battista Martini. Pasquale Antonio Basili in 1784 published an open letter in defense of Coccia and against criticism of Capalti. Maria Rosa Coccia died in Rome.

The British issued similar warnings to the Spanish to leave British territory. British refusal to leave was met by Spanish force. Some 1,400 Spanish soldiers in five ships were dispatched from the Argentine mainland to drive the British out of West Falkland.Marley p. 229 The British contingent could not resist such a force, so after firing their guns, they capitulated on terms, an inventory of their stores being taken, and were permitted to return to their own country in the Favourite. Background The Spanish were aware of the British presence on the Falklands before they took control of the French colony at Port Louis and renamed it Puerto Soledad in January 1767. On 28 November 1769, the officer in charge of the garrison on Saunders Island, Captain Anthony Hunt, observed a Spanish schooner hovering about the island surveying it. He sent the commander a message, by which he required of him to depart. An exchange of letters followed where each side asserted sovereignty and demanded the other depart. Hunt stated categorically that the Falkland Islands belonged to Britain and demanded that the Spanish leave.Wagstaff p. 8 Spanish capture A squadron of frigates was dispatched by Francisco Bucareli, the governor of Buenos Aires, to expel the British. General Juan Ignacio de Madariaga‚Äôs frigates Industria, Santa B√°rbara, Santa Catalina, and Santa Rosa, plus the Xebec Andaluz carrying 1,400 soldiers and a siege train under Colonel Don Antonio Guti√©rrez, surprised the British settlement at Port Egmont. Although the British had erected a wooden blockhouse and an eight-gun battery of 12-pounders, they were no match for the Spanish force.Marley p.299 The Spaniards waded ashore and, after a token exchange of shots, Commander William Maltby and Commander George Farmer sued for terms. They and other settlers were detained for 20 days then permitted to sail for England aboard their sole remaining vessel, the 16-gun Favourite (the Swift had sunk at Port Desire three months before). The new occupiers renamed the town Cruzada and took over ownership. When news reached Britain it produced a public outcry. Aftermath News of this forcible eviction created much commotion in Britain. The British government was outraged at what it considered to be a despicable act, and the incident nearly led to an outbreak of war against Spain. The secretary of state, Lord Weymouth, addressed to the court of Madrid demanded: \\"the instant restoration of the colonists to Port Egmont, and for reparation of the insult offered to the dignity of the British crown, by their forcible removal from that place\\".Hunt p. 121 To these demands the Spanish court at first gave evasive answers, endeavouring to change the question at issue into one respecting the right of sovereignty over the islands. Lord Weymouth, however, refused positively to discuss that or any other matter, until the restoration and satisfaction which he demanded had been made; and the preparations for war which had been already commenced were prosecuted with vigor. Whilst there was pressure for war on both sides, rationality prevailed, when France, Spain's ally, refused to back Madrid in its predicament and the Spanish court was obliged to back down. It alleged the seizure had been done without Charles III‚Äôs authorisation and offered to restore Port Egmont as it existed before being captured. Prince de Maserano, the Spanish ambassador at London, declared, in the name of his sovereign, that \\"no particular orders\\" had been given to the governor of Buenos Aires on this occasion, though that officer had acted agreeably to his \\"general instructions and oath\\" as governor, and to the general laws of the Indies, in expelling foreigners from the Spanish dominions; and that he was ready to engage for the restoration of the British to Port Egmont, without however ceding any part of His Catholic Majesty's claim to the Falkland Islands; provided the king of England would in return disavow the conduct of Captain Hunt in ordering the Spaniards away from Soledad, which he asserted, had led to the measures taken by Bucareli. The agreement finally took place on 15 September 1771, six months after the eviction, restoring the status quo as it existed before the capture of Port Egmont. By April the 32-gun frigate HMS Juno of Captain John Stott arrived to resume British rule, accompanied by the 14-gun Hound and the storeship Florida. The short time frame is significant. Spain's military actions at Port Egmont aroused fears of war on the Continent, and in the context of Britain's overwhelming military superiority,Mahan, p.335 the Spanish were more than willing to seek an early and amicable solution with their \\"injured\\" counterpart. The British withdrew from the islands in pursuance of a system of retrenchment in 1774, leaving behind a flag and a plaque representing their claim to ownership. However, the British Charge d‚ÄôAffaire later noted in a protest in 1829: The Spanish reoccupied Port Egmont during the Anglo-Spanish War, but progressively lost control of its colonies. Spanish troops remained at Port Louis, known then as Port Soledad, until 1806 when Governor Juan Cris√≥stomo Mart√≠nez departed, leaving behind a plaque claiming sovereignty for Spain. The remaining Spanish settlers were removed in 1811 by order of the Spanish Governor in Montevideo.  Notes   References  Daniel K.

The series stars Sam Witwer, Sam Huntington, and Meaghan Rath as three twenty-something characters sharing a house in Boston, trying to live a normal social life, despite being a vampire, a werewolf, and a ghost respectively.  Main characters  =Aidan Waite= Aidan Waite (Sam Witwer) is the American counterpart of Mitchell from the original British series, named after the actor who played Mitchell in the original series. He is a quiet, calm, soft-spoken, and somewhat jaded vampire who is 257 years old, having been sired by Bishop during the American Revolution. Though he attempted to live to with his wife Suzanna and their son Isaac, Aidan ends up losing them due to a preacher who lusts for Suzanna and ultimately drowns her on the grounds that she is a witch. After taking revenge on the clergyman, Aidan became Bishop's right hand and aided him until the 1950s when he no longer believes in Bishop's conviction to the vampire cause and decides to resist the urge to feed upon humans. While in Montreal in the 1970s, Aiden meets Celine and had a relationship with her. In the time before the beginning of the series, originally out of pity, Aidan saves Josh from being tormented by Marcus and before the two became good friends with Aidan getting Josh a job as an orderly at Boston's Suffolk County Hospital, where Aidan has been working as a nurse. The two later become roommates with a mutual intent to fit back into society. The series begins with Aidan relapsing into his blood- drinking ways with fellow nurse Rebecca, Aidan forced to call Bishop and Marcus to clean up his unintentional murder before later learning they turned Rebecca into a vampire. While organizing a neighborhood watch association to deal with a local vandal, Aidan ends up catching the attention of a police officer who is the son of a man he had killed in the past. Though he tried to erase the officer's memory of him so Bishop could not turn him, Aidan later learns of the officer's suicide. Aidan also attempts to help Rebecca by setting up a co-dependent relationship, feasting on each other's blood rather than live blood, but she eventually backs out. When Aidan discovers that Bishop has begun recruiting new vampires from dying hospital patients against his wishes, he confronts the hospital chaplain who has been turned into a vampire by Bishop while he was dying of terminal cancer. Aidan manages to de- fang the chaplain, rendering him unable to feed on blood any more. Rebecca later acts on Bishop's order to sway Aidan's thoughts on her by sending him a DVD where she has sex with a man before draining him dry of blood. Though he promises Josh and Sally that he will get rid of the DVD, Aidan secretly keeps it. This results in a nasty turn of events when Aiden forms a bond with a neighborhood child named Bernie, who reminds him of Isaac, and the boy accidentally found Rebecca's DVD with Aidan branded a sex offender and unable to save Bernie after he was mortally wounded. When he learns that Rebecca turned Bernie into a vampire, though seeing not good to come from it, Aidan decides to accept until a scheme by Bishop and Marcus force Aidan to reluctantly kill Bernie on the notion that he murdered his bullies. With a furious Rebecca refusing to help him when Josh is abducted by the vampires to serve in a dog fight to entertain the Dutch, Aidan joins back up with Bishop as the Dutch are arriving to deal with the latter for increasing the vampire population in Boston. But ultimately discovering that Bishop has planned for the Dutch's betrayal by drugging them with juniper-laced blood in his blood den workers, Aidan is able to only save Heggeman with Rebecca's help once she learns the truth of Bernie's death being arranged by Marcus. After Heggeman leaves to tell the other vampire clans of Bishop's planned coup, Aidan honors Rebecca's wish to die rather than live as a vampire. Several days later, Aidan is reunited with an elderly Celine, learning she came to Boston to live with her daughter while she receives treatment for lung cancer, even though she does not plan on living through the treatment. He offers to turn her into a vampire, but she declines while hiding the actual reason why she did not leave Montreal with him. Later that night, saving the house and Sally from a fire set by Danny, Aidan is almost staked at the heart by Bishop crashes through their living room window. Josh has Nora treat Aidan, without telling any specifics, but he remains weak and Bishop plans on fighting him, notifying him through Josh. Celine goes to comfort Aidan, and decides to offer him her blood. Reluctantly, Aidan drains Celine of her blood, killing her, but allowing him to heal completely. Expecting that Josh would attempt to fight for him, Aidan has Sally trap Josh in the hospital basement while he decapitates Bishop in their fight to the death. After Heggeman crowns him as the new head of the Boston vampires, Aiden learns that Mother wants to meet with him over the matter of Bishop's orphaned vampires. When Aidan suggests the orphans can be reformed, Mother decides that the orphans should all be culled and that Aidan will not lead Boston, but instead assist her daughter Suren in taking over with his freedom from vampire society as a reward. As his first task for Suren, Aiden is told to turn Cecilia, a cop she has met, to serve as their new police liaison. Aidan refuses, knowing he will bleed Cecilia dry, and ends up at a bar where he meets Julia, a new doctor hired by Suffolk County Hospital, and begins an intimate relationship with her. Aidan begins using donated blood to satisfy his blood lusts while with Julia to keep her safe. However, when it is revealed that Julia is the same Julia who was Josh's ex-fianc√©, and when the hospital puts higher security on the blood supply, Aidan breaks up with her. After suffering blood withdrawals, Aidan ends up starting a relationship with Suren while learning his prot√©g√© Henry Duram, who was responsible for Suren being buried alive eighty years ago, is organizing Bishop's orphans. Suffering visions of Bishop from overdrinking blood, Aidan tracks down Henry and finds himself unable to kill his \\"son\\" while deciding to help Henry find a way to reintegrate him into vampire society. Aiden's plans, however, are waylaid with various troubles that include Suren questioning Cecilia's disappearance and Atlee investigating what became of Heggeman, the former revealed to be the work of Brynn and Connor McLean who Aidan decides to blame for Heggeman's death. Forced to leave Cecilia to be killed, Aidan kills Connor the next day and presents his corpse to Atlee while telling the vampire to never come back to Boston. A week later, while helping Sally with her Reaper issue, Aidan learns that Suren has lied to Mother about culling all of Bishop's orphans. Aidan approaches Henry to gather all of the orphans at the house of a man who sells passage through the threshold so he may save the orphans and reintegrate Henry into vampire society. That night, he offers the orphans passage to Baltimore, where the vampires have no hold, before rushing himself and Henry out of the house. Unbeknownst to Henry and the orphans, Suren has had her living representative purchase the house from the man and has all of the vampires uninvited, causing them to crumble into ash. Aidan presents Henry to Suren who takes her revenge for his actions 80 years ago by flaying him alive. Aidan brings the skinned Henry to the brownstone, so he may recuperate while on the blood of Beth and Holly. However, when Aidan's mental coersion starts to wear off on the girls, he is forced to kill them with Henry able to fully heal by taking his fill. When Aidan confronted by Josh over Henry, the two put their differences aside to help Sally as she is possessed by the Reaper by revealing their true natures to Zoe. During that time, when he falls into temptation after Zoe is knocked out, Josh convinces Aidan to take his blood instead. Though Aidan feels a buzz after drinking, he starts convulsing in pain from the werewolf blood, vomiting and letting out an earsplitting scream that manages to snap Sally out of it. With the house unlocked, Josh leaves and Aidan, with blood oozing from his orifices, goes to rest. Sometime later, Aidan and Suren feel confident that they have been working to fulfill Mother's requirements of the two of them, so Aidan begins to teach Suren how to live as he does among humans. After an awkward dinner date with Josh and Julia, during which Suren realizes Aidan and Julia were once together, Aidan reassures Suren that she will always have a place in his life. However, when Mother comes to Boston to congratulate the two on fulfilling their duties, Aidan learns his freedom is actually an excommunication from vampire society under penalty of death. However, Aidan has Henry get a message to Suren so they may live on the run together. While at a small motel with Suren, Aidan attempts to get Atlee's help in providing him and Suren refuge from Mother. But after making a deal, Aidan finds that Suren returned to Boston to protect Aiden from Mother's wrath. Refusing to give up, Aidan decides to assassinate Mother with Henry's help. Unfortunately, Aidan falls into Mother's trap before being used as a final test for Suren to prove herself as Mother's successor. But after watching Suren get staked when she cannot follow through, Aidan is sentenced to be buried alive. Before he is buried alive, Aidan tells Mother that he will be fine, but she will be the one to live with the fact that she has killed the only person who has ever unconditionally loved her. For a few months, Aidan fights to maintain his sanity until a human takes him out, only to sell his \\"pure\\" blood to diseased vampires. However, as news of Aidan's return circulates around Boston, Atlee arrives at the location Aidan is being held captive and rescues him. Aidan then learns that a flu most humans have contracted is killing off all of the vampires, who believe his blood may be able to cure them, as he has not fed from disease-stricken humans. Yet, Atlee soon reveals that he has rescued Aidan only to serve the diseased Council, and as Aidan vehemently objects Atlee decides he would not be able to provide enough blood for all Council members so he attempts to take what blood he can, but after seeing Aidan's blood has not cured him of his disease he ultimately ends up disintegrating. Aidan is then left at the side of the road, seeing visions of his friends and Bishop before the former find him. As Aidan learns more about the disease and how few vampires there are left he stumbles across Henry once more, learning that he is now happily in a relationship with a human who was not affected by the flu killing off all vampires, and after Henry offers Aidan to feed from her Aidan discovers that Henry had merely compelled her and he is holding her captive. Aidan attempts to reason with Henry on how what he's doing is wrong and he is stronger than such behavior, but Henry refuses to let her go and Aidan must release her secretly. After Henry becomes aware of her disappearance he chooses to trust Aidan on his survival, waiting as Aidan delivers \\"clean\\" human for him to feed from, however, in a bout of weakness Henry feeds from a tainted bag of blood at the hospital and soon after becomes diseased. Aidan is then forced to watch him die as Henry does not want any more of Aidan's help, coping by having an impromptu party. Eventually Aidan resumes his job at the hospital where he meets Kenneth, or Kenny, a teenage boy who has Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disorder and must live within an airtight chamber. After befriending Kenny, Aidan accidentally reveals his vampire nature and Kenny pleads for him to turn him into a vampire once he turns eighteen. Aidan refuses to curse Kenny, however, once another vampire, Blake, agrees to turn Kenny in exchange for all the clean blood she may want Aidan decides to save Kenny from her grips and promises to turn him once he is of age. =Sally Malik= Sally Malik (Meaghan Rath) is the American counterpart to Annie Sawyer from the original British series. She is a bubbly and sarcastic but insecure ghost who haunts the house she and her fianc√© lived in while she was alive, and is unwilling to leave it due to not being sure how to \\"move on\\". Sally appears in the clothes she was wearing when she died which change subtly depending on her state of mind. She is introduced as a very insecure ghost who does not trust herself to unlock the past with her ex-fianc√© Danny, although she does not believe he did anything wrong. She possesses the power to move objects with her mind, shake the house she lives in with Aidan and Josh, can alter the pipe lines in the house, and can project thoughts into others' minds (she does so to warn her friend, Bridget). Sally is at first finally glad that Josh and Aidan can see her, and Aidan finds another ghost to teach Sally how she can leave the house and do more with her ghostly powers, and reveals that once they are done on Earth, they receive a door to the other side. She first uses her newfound freedom to stay with Danny until he begins dating their once mutual friend Bridget. Sally tries to break them up until Josh helps her realize that she has to move on just like they have. Things take a turn for the worse when a plumber Danny has hired to fix the pipes in the house that Sally has been subconsciously clogging. The plumber reveals a ring in one of the sinks, which Danny and Sally recognize as her engagement ring. This triggers Sally's memories of the events that actually led to her death. Sally had taken the ring off to wash up before bed when it fell into the bathroom sink's drain. Danny became enraged that she was taking it off, believing she was dating other men, and yelled at her and gave her a push that made her fall down the stairs to her death. Later that day, she uses her poltergeist powers to enact revenge on Danny, wrecking his apartment and leaving a spiral of debris in the middle of the room, ending with her ring. When Danny begins to try to get rid of the ring, only for it to fall into Sally's possession, and becoming one of the only objects she can physically manipulate. She uses this to continue to torment Danny, but inadvertently causes him to harm Bridget when he believes Bridget is the one who continues to make the ring return, prompting Bridget to give the ring to Josh and Aidan. Sally attempts to retaliate for Bridget's injury, but Danny taunts her, realizing that she is haunting him and that he is not scared. She attempts to tell Bridget that Danny is the one that killed her, but Danny tells a lie about the events leading to the death, and Bridget tells Sally to stay out of their new life. Aidan introduces Sally to a closed-off wing of the hospital where several lost souls gather to try to get their message to their loved ones when they die. This leads Sally to meet Nick, a teaching assistant she had a crush on while she was in college who has also since died. They go on dates, but when Nick disappears in a rush, Sally goes out to find him where he is reliving his death from when he drowned in a boating accident. Sally tries to help him, but he helps her realize that she should not take on his problems on top of her own. Sally also meets a vindictive ghost who constantly torments her ex- boyfriend, which makes Sally unsure of how she has been treating Danny. Later, Danny and Bridget return to the house after Sally has stopped haunting them, only to have brought along a medium with them who Danny has asked to exorcise Sally from the house. Sally finds herself unable to fight back, but in one last-ditch effort manages to possess the medium and lashes out at Danny through her body. When Sally is ejected, the medium now knows what Danny did to Sally and ends the exorcism rites knowing that Danny will get what he deserves from a now freed and scarier looking Sally (Josh would later compare her to the vengeful ghost from The Grudge). Sally manages to cause Danny to cut himself with a straight razor, regaining her normal appearance and realizing that the vengeful ghost she met earlier was right in how she was to act. However, Danny comes to the house and confronts Sally, revealing that the exorcist Ilana had told him that there was another way to get rid of a ghost: by destroying the place it haunts. He begins to set fire to the house, but Sally manages to trap him in with her long enough for Aidan and Josh to return, both revealing their supernatural abilities to Danny. Aidan threatens to kill him, at Sally's behest, but Josh convinces them that Sally does not need blood on her hands. Instead, Sally appears to Danny and threatens that he does not confess to her murder, she will make his life a living hell. Danny turns himself in for the arson as well as Sally's murder the year before, and as everyone is celebrating their good fortunes, Sally's door to the other side appears. She is hesitant to go through, but is interrupted when Bishop attacks Aidan. She goes to help him, but when she returns to the house the door is gone and she also discovers that she can interact with other physical objects. Sally uses this newfound power to trap Josh in his room under the hospital and to distract Bishop long enough for Aidan to kill him. After reuniting with her friend Stevie at her high school reunion, she confronts the recently deceased former prom queen, making her find her own Door. To make her feel better, Stevie tells her ghosts can sleep and dream, but when she tries it later she encounters a dark force that she believes is out to get her. While spending time with Stevie and his friends Dylan and friend \\"Boner\\", she learns that ghosts can possess humans who are willing, or otherwise inebriated. Stevie warns her not to, but she follows Dylan and Boner to enjoy having a physical body. Dylan suggests they should have sex, but Sally knows that it is essentially raping the body she has borrowed. He forces himself on her until Stevie pulls them out of their bodies, leading to a fight where Stevie \\"shreds\\" Dylan, removing his spiritual essence permanently. Sally finds this disconcerting, and Stevie disappears on her afterward. Sally goes to the hospital to accompany Josh and Aidan at work. While looking in the nursery, she is approached by nurse Zoe Gonzalez, a human who can see ghosts. Zoe oversees the nursery so she can decide if ghosts are worthy of being reincarnated into babies. Sally tries to convince her to let her be reincarnated and even has her meet with Josh and Aidan to plead her case, but because she nearly killed Danny, Zoe turns her down. Sally tries to plead with her, as she believes she is being followed by the dark entity from her dreams, but Zoe will not hear of it. At the hospital, after a janitor cleans up a line of salt Zoe uses to keep ghosts out of the nursery, Sally tries to take things into her own hands, but the dark entity attacks her. Sally later recalls these events to Zoe who agrees to help her out. During this time, Sally is reunited with her mother Rena who has recently died in the hospital. Their reunion is made short when Rena only wants to spend time with their old neighbor and secret lover Jerry. Rena later expresses that she is upset that Sally is still living in the house that she was murdered in, before she reunites with Jerry. While talking to Zoe, Sally realizes she has become smitten with new doctor Tim Forest, and Sally does her best to coach Zoe into a date with the doctor. Zoe also convinces Sally to attend the support group she holds for ghosts, where Sally meets with Nick, again. Believing they have reconciled after their breakup, Sally gloats about the events to Zoe who reveals that Nick is her boyfriend. When Nick confirms this, Sally's heart is broken, until she encounters Dr. Forest with his girlfriend Janet. Sally uses the opportunity to possess Janet so she can feel Dr. Forest's love for his girlfriend. However, this begins to weaken her. Aidan warns her to stop, but she does not heed the warning and gets stuck in Janet, without any actual knowledge of the woman. Dr. Forest's mother comes to visit, but Sally's erratic behavior in Janet's body culminates when the dark entity attacks her, separating her from Janet's body. Later, Janet comes to the brownstone, with Josh still believing Sally is stuck in her body, but Sally reveals she is not, causing them distress as Janet seems to have taken some of Sally's memories. Sally goes to console her, but Janet is feverishly drawing the dark entity that attacked Sally, labeling one of the drawings as \\"Reaper\\". When Aidan informs Sally that her mother is dying, Sally is jarred. When her mother passes, they reunite but at her mom's funeral, Sally sees her kissing the ghost of their neighbor, who died a decade earlier, and realizes the two had been having an affair. The two ghosts come over for a \\"dinner\\" party as Sally has it out with her mother, not happy about all this and saying she does not want to see her mom again. Sometime later, poltergeist activity starts up in the house, which Aidan and Josh blame on Sally, but she claims she is not responsible. Things escalate when Sally is attacked by an unseen force that has Danny's voice. She goes to see Aidan, believing that Danny has sent a \\"Reaper\\" after her, but Aidan discovers Danny died while in prison. He teaches her to use iron to disperse ghosts, which she attempts to use on Danny when he appears in front of her. However, Danny's death in prison has made him stronger, leading to him gaining the upper hand. She is saved by the entity she believes is the Reaper, who soon takes on a human form to talk to her, saying that her passing up the Door has caused an unbalance that he needs to right. He gives Sally a week to say her goodbyes, but he instead finds a loophole that will let her live, so long as she becomes the new Reaper. Her first task is to reap Stevie, who the Reaper claims has shredded Boner as well and that he is waiting for his high school bully to die to shred him. When Stevie admits he might shred the bully, the Reaper shreds him in front of Sally. However, when Boner appears to Sally asking where Stevie went, she becomes suspicious. Zoe and Nick suggest she seek out the help of the support group, but the Reaper appears and shreds all of the ghosts, and Zoe becomes fearful of her. Nick goes to see her, saying she needs help, but Sally believes the Reaper is after her when it appears again and starts to shred Nick. She pleads with the Reaper to stop, leading to the Reaper to reveal that he does not really exist and is only a figment of her imagination. Sally realizes she has been shredding ghosts, and shreds Nick, before attacking Josh and Aidan, but Aidan uses a fire poker to disperse her. With Sally out cold, the boys approach Zoe for help, but the Reaper takes over, trapping everyone in the house while Aidan is going through blood withdrawals and it is also the night of the full moon. Zoe goes into Sally's mind to try to free everyone before Aidan relapses or Josh turns, finding Sally in an intricate fantasy where she is alive and the Reaper is her fianc√© \\"Scott\\" who is pressing her to move out of the brownstone, so he may actually take over her ghostly body. Zoe manages to get through to Sally who realizes the fantasy is not where she should be, taking control of her spiritual form once more and freeing everyone. However, Scott reappears, reminding Sally that he is a part of her and will be waiting for her to slip, again. While doing her best to try to ignore \\"Scott\\", Sally learns that Janet has been committed to Suffolk County Hospital's psychiatric ward, Sally pleads with Josh to talk to Janet through him so she can free her, as \\"Scott\\" presses her to give up hope. Just as Sally runs out of hope, Nora helps her speak to Janet, and once Janet learns the truth, Sally feels a weight lifted, and \\"Scott\\" disappears. Sally's next step is to apologize to Zoe, but Zoe has given up doing anything concerning ghosts since Sally's actions under the Reaper's influence. Sally's pestering gets through to her, just as a solar eclipse causes the ghosts Sally has shredded to reappear. Sally reminds Zoe that she shredded Nick in the house she shares with Josh and Aidan and promises to meet her there. Sally finds Nick, and Danny, are both back, where Nick reveals that he and the others are in an existence that keeps them prisoner, home to both shredded ghosts and those who take other ghosts' Doors. But when Zoe arrives, Nick says he is at peace, making her happy just as the eclipse ends. When Aidan and Josh have their plans to save their loved ones, Sally possesses Ray's wife to lure him into the woods where Josh can kill him, but the Reaper appears once more, as she slipped. Sally seeks out her mother Rena's help, asking her to shred her so she can go to Limbo to save the others, just as Nora finds her where Sally reveals the truth. Sally returns to the house to find her mother waiting for her, realizing that Sally has become so strong in death and she is proud of her, just as her mother's Door appears. Knowing that Sally can take her door, Rena offers it to her so she can go to Limbo, as the Reaper eggs her on to give into another wrong desire. While grateful, Sally takes matters into her own hands and shreds herself, destroying the Reaper along with her own essence. Later, as Aidan is being buried and Josh is in his standoff with Ray and Nora, Sally's voice comes on over a radio in the house, revealing she has made it into Limbo but she needs her friends' help to get out. In the season 3 premiere, Sally is in limbo, trying her hardest to try to get back to the other side. She is with Nick, who is constantly drowning again, and Stevie, who is hanging from a tree and watching his family go on without him, while her eternal punishment is fruitlessly trying to get back to the other side. Josh and Nora call upon the witch Ms. Gilchrist who they believe will bring Sally's spirit back, but instead, she brings Sally's soul back into her body, bringing her back to life, along with Stevie and Nick by association with Sally. In season 4, Sally is discovering her new powers now being half-witch and also finding herself romantically involved with Aidan. =Josh Levison= Joshua \\"Josh\\" Levison (Sam Huntington) is the American counterpart of George Sands. He is a neurotic, socially-awkward hospital worker with a heart of gold who suffers from being a werewolf; transforming once a month on every full moon. In the first episode, it is revealed that he chose to leave his family because of his situation, having been gone from them for about two years now. Josh wavers between wanting a normal life, and feeling that he needs to isolate himself as much as possible because that life is impossible for him because of what he is. He ends up finding his sister one day at the hospital, who was visiting her girlfriend, and she tries to find out why he left and pry herself back into his life. Josh tries to distance himself as much as possible from her, for fear of what might happen if she finds out what he is. One full moon, however, she follows him to the place he transforms in, determined to find out what he is trying to hide from her. Josh tries to get her to leave only for her to shut the door and still try to stay. Full of fear that he might kill her once in his wolf state, he calls Aidan and Sally for help, and Aidan ends up coming to the rescue to pull her out just in time. He tells her that Josh has some unspecified medical condition, and takes her away to safety. The following day when Emily tries to talk to Josh about what happened, Josh rejects his sister and tells her not to contact him again for her own good. When Josh meets Ray, who reveals that he is another werewolf, Aidan has Ray teach Josh how to survive as a werewolf in the modern world and avoid detection, eventually leading Josh to hit on a nurse at the hospital named Nora, although she rejects his advances as potential sexual harassment. Although Josh is reluctant at first, he and Ray hit it off until Ray convinces him to attack the vampires' blood den, with Josh attacking Bishop's second in command Marcus. However, Josh later has Ray leave his life after Ray reveals that he was the one who turned Josh into a werewolf in the first place. Some time later, Emily moves in with Josh and Aidan when she breaks up with her girlfriend. Aidan takes her to a bar to rebound where she is ambushed by Marcus in an attempt to get back at Aidan. Josh and Emily return to their parents' house, where his psychologist father confronts him about how he believes Josh is suffering from clinical lycanthropy due to Josh's extensive journals where he has been trying to seek out a cure. After Josh shows his kinder side to Nora, she begins to reciprocate his feelings, and when she confronts him about his flightiness in their relationship on the verge of a full moon, they have sex. He tries to scale back the relationship once more, when he begins to have nightmares about transforming into a werewolf and harming Nora, but he ultimately decides to stay with her. Shortly after, Josh is captured by thousand-year-old vampires and put into a werewolf version of a dogfight. He wins, killing the other wolf, Douglas, and this causes great emotional trauma. He protests alongside Sally to Aidan going back to Bishop's \\"family\\", even though Aidan says it is the only way to free Josh from the vampires. When he returns to see Nora, she reveals she is pregnant with his child, and Josh decides it is best for him to be there for her. When Nora suspects the child has a birth defect due to strange hormone levels, Josh worries that he has passed on lycanthropy to his child, but an ultrasound reveals that the baby is healthy, although twice as far along in the pregnancy than they thought. After this discovery as well as Sally's resolution of her issues, he decides to return to medical school and become a doctor to support Nora and his child, but this celebration is cut short by Bishop's attack on Aidan. Josh makes the decision to kill Bishop, but Sally reveals that Aidan had asked her to keep Josh out of the fight, and she traps him in the hospital basement. Nora discovers Josh in his hospital hiding place where he is transforming, and he accidentally scratches her as he ushers her out of the room. He transforms into the wolf completely in front of Nora, and reveals the truth to her later, although she hides the fact that she was scratched and infected in the process. On the next full moon, with Nora now part of the house, Josh prepares for his next transformation, with Nora inquisitive about the events. That night, Josh is driven out to the woods by Nora, who initially feels relieved that she is not a werewolf, but she begins to transform in the car. Josh realizes she is in danger, but Heggeman appears and shoots Josh with a silver bullet, having been tasked by Mother to kill Josh to free Aidan of distractions. Injured, but not shot directly, Josh tries to get away but Nora, who has fully transformed, kills Heggeman and saves Josh. The next day, Josh and Nora attend a mixer for MIT students, but Nora's erratic behavior after the change raises eyebrows, until she reveals that she has miscarried their baby. This prompts Josh to unmatriculate from med school so he may focus on curing themselves. To this end, he rents out two storage units and buys camera equipment to film them during the change. Nora is reluctant at first, particularly after Josh's ex-fianc√©e Julia comes to town and is revealed to be Aidan's current lover. After Nora confronts him that he wanted to keep Julia safe from the wolf, but not her, he is worried that she will be in danger, particularly after she reveals that she remembers the events of her first change. However, Nora appears at the storage facility later, convinced that she is a danger at the full moon. Near the next full moon, Josh is approached at work by a young woman named Brynn who reveals that her twin brother Connor has been put in the psych ward, and that they are both werewolves. Josh reluctantly frees Connor, who comes to thank him later by taking him out to an upscale dance club. Connor and Brynn reveal that they are purebred werewolves, born rather than changed. When Josh mentions he is seeking a cure, Connor offers to fund the research necessary. When Josh mentions he is looking for the trigger that activates the change, Connor and Brynn reveal they want to be wolves all the time, which initially turns Josh off from their offer, but he reconsiders. Josh introduces Nora to the twins in the same week that Nora's abusive ex-boyfriend Will comes to town. As the full moon is near, Josh is convinced by Connor to retaliate against Will for hurting Nora, attacking him during the day until Nora interferes. Josh backs off, realizing he would be no better than Will if he seriously hurt him, unaware that Nora has been giving into her animal desires and stalking Will. That night, Josh goes to the storage unit while Nora, Connor, and Brynn attack Will as their wolves. The next day, police ask about his whereabouts, but he cannot tell them the truth. They reveal they are actually looking for Nora, who has been absent since the full moon. After trying to get in contact with Nora through the twins, who piss him off, Josh tries to get help from Aidan, as they have a new vampire cop liaison, but Aidan is distracted by visions of Bishop. Josh takes things into his own hands, contacting Cecilia himself, and offering up the twins to her as the werewolves who killed Heggeman. When the detectives find him at the storage unit, Cecilia shows up and uses her abilities to convince the detectives that Josh is not responsible. That night, Josh follows through on his end of the deal, leading Cecilia to the twins. Nora arrives at work a week later, on the night of another full moon, and is surprised when Josh says he tried to contact her through the twins, but they would not send along the message. After Nora meets the twins, she reveals to Josh that the twins believe Aidan sent Cecilia after them after she covered up the murder. That night, Josh arrives to a cabin the twins and Nora use to change in, when Aidan also arrives, as he is looking for Cecilia. The wolves reveal they have hidden Cecilia in the woods so they may hunt Aidan as the wolves, when Josh reveals he is the one who sent Cecilia after them. All four transform and hunt down Aidan and Cecilia, and end up killing Cecilia when she gives up so Aidan may live. The next morning, Nora reveals that they only met because Josh wanted to be human, but her transformation has made her embrace her wolf self. This causes them to break up, leading to Emily to come to Boston to try to bring Josh back to his former self. They plan to go drinking, but when he leaves work early, he finds that Emily has been out drinking with Julia. Josh and Julia trade jabs over drinks until Emily needs to be taken back to Julia's place. Julia demands to know why Josh left, and he admits that after the attack he became a monster (without elaborating on being a werewolf) and that he did not want to hurt her. At work, Josh and Julia agree to become friends, just as Josh is met by the ghost of his friend Stu who died in the werewolf attack. Stu tries to push Josh and Julia apart, as he knows it will put Julia in danger, but when Julia starts to fall in love with Josh, again, Stu takes over Josh's body and has sex with Julia. When Josh awakes to realize what has happened, he is angry at Stu for using him, as he can either put Julia in danger of the wolf or break her heart, again. When Julia wakes up to cuddle up with Josh, he ultimately decides to stay with her, as he is still in love with her. When he returns home, he finds Aidan seeing Henry (who Josh had seen without his skin) and a moving company off, realizing that Henry could only have healed after drinking blood, which he sees in the moving boxes. They fight until they walk inside to see Sally shred Nick. After they approach Zoe to save Sally, the Reaper entity traps them all in the house. That night is the full moon, so they work fast to try to free Josh, who can only think of the blood still lingering in the house, and the fear he may kill Zoe. Josh rushes to lock himself into the fridge if they cannot save Sally, but has to offer up his blood to Aidan to save Zoe when he tries to feed on her. Josh's blood seems to Aidan's thirst until he violently reacts to it. The events help save Sally from the Reaper, letting Josh leave the house to transform in the woods. Josh wants his relationship with Julia to advance, so he invites her over to the house for dinner, even though Aidan has broken her heart. Aidan invites Suren over, and after an awkward dinner where Suren realizes Julia and Aidan were together, events turn out better. Just as their relationship grows, Nora returns to Boston, seeking her old job at the hospital, and hoping to rekindle things with Josh. However, Josh's love lies with Julia, again, even when she asks him to make sure he is making the right choice. When he finds that Nora has helped Sally, he makes up his mind. After Aidan leaves, Nora approaches him one more time to reveal Brynn has told her of a way to lift the werewolf curse. Josh has to kill the werewolf who turned him: Ray. Josh mulls this over in his mind, going as far to track Ray down where he discovers Ray has reunited with his family and now has a better life. Josh changes his mind and instead decides to tell Julia the truth, pushed even more when their old friend Chelsea comes to town and she tells him to do the same. Just as Josh begins to reveal the truth to Julia, the solar eclipse affecting the ghosts causes him to partially transform. He runs away from Julia, but when he reaches a dead end, he turns to face her just as he feels another intense pain. This causes Julia to back up into the street where she is hit by a car. Josh, still transforming, leaves the scene only to return later to find that Julia has died. As she admits she always loved him, her Door appears, and she passes through it. Josh goes to her funeral, but Emily keeps him from entering the service. As she talks to him, he receives a call from the hospital, as Nora is in observation after she was affected by the solar eclipse as well. Nora reveals she is glad that Josh did not follow through with killing his maker, as it would have cured her as well, and she knows he should not be a murderer. Josh makes his final decision to kill Ray, using Heggeman's rifle. With Aidan's promise that he will meet up with him at the shack in the woods, Sally helps Josh lure Ray to the woods by possessing Ray's wife. With Ray fallen into the trap, Josh leads him to the shack where he plans on killing him, but Nora, who has learned the truth from Sally, distracts him, causing Ray to escape. As Josh chases him, Ray knocks him down, preparing to kill Josh as well. Nora arrives with a gun of her own, and the three end up in a standoff: Ray with the rifle aimed at Josh, Nora with a handgun aimed at Ray, and Josh telling Nora to kill him instead. Both guns are heard going off after the scene changes. In the season 3 premiere, it is revealed that the shots fired were one into Ray, grazing him, and the other flying off into the night. Ray then turns on Nora, and Josh uses the confusion to bludgeon Ray to death. During the next full moon, Josh is revealed to be cured of his lycanthropy, but the same cannot be said of Nora. They spend the next 15 months trying to find both Aidan and Sally, and Josh has advanced his medical degree and works at Suffolk County Hospital in a residency. They go to the witch Ms. Gilchrist who asks of them to bring her the heart of someone they have killed to bring Sally back, so they retrieve Ray's heart for the incantation, and then Sally's body from her grave. Josh is later survives an attack by Liam a full blooded werewolf, and later gains the ability to transform without the full moon and retain some control over himself demonstrated when he doesn't attack Nora. Josh and Nora then become married and later have twins. =James Bishop= James Bishop (Mark Pellegrino) is the American counterpart of Herrick from the original British series. Bishop is the head of the local vampire clan and the main antagonist in season 1. Originally an Englishman who became a vampire during the 17th century, Bishop travels with his sire Carlo to the Thirteen Colonies and eventually turns Aidan, his wife Susanne, and Marcus during the American Revolution. During the 1950s, Bishop had fallen in love with a Suffolk County Hospital nurse named Jane who was aware of his vampiric nature. When the powerful Dutch vampires visit and kill off Carlo, Bishop is made the new head of the Boston clan with an ultimatum: kill Jane or leave the vampire clan to live with her. His initial hesitation leads to the schism between himself and Aidan, but he ultimately decides to stay in the vampire clan, killing Jane while she is working at the hospital. In the present day, Bishop keeps up public \\"human\\" appearances by owning a mortuary and by acting as a lieutenant in the Boston Police Department. These positions allow him to cover up the crimes that his fellow vampires commit. It is under these circumstances that Bishop finds Aidan back in his life when Aidan accidentally kills fellow nurse Rebecca, siring her to get back at Aidan while attempting to bring him back to the fold. But when Aidan repeatedly refuses, Bishop moves forward with his plans and begins offering to turn terminal patients into vampires. Though Aidan warns him that the hospital is off-limits, offering to help him with Mike Garrity, Bishop reneges on their deal as he brought a vampire priest from outside the city to be the hospital's chaplain so he can recruit dying patients. Aidan responds by defanging the priest to send Bishop a message that these acts will not be tolerated. When Marcus attacks Josh's sister, Aidan confronts Bishop, but Bishop does not reprimand Marcus, as it is the proper way to retaliate for Josh's attack on Marcus. However, when Marcus continues to seek revenge, Aidan goes back to Bishop who reveals that he has been increasing the vampire population in Boston in an attempt to reveal themselves to humanity and take over as the dominant race. He also reveals that he sees Aidan as a weakness amongst vampires, while he sees Marcus as a mistake he made. In response, having assisted in the death of Bernie's bullies to trick Aidan into killing the boy, Marcus goes to the Amish Country to reveal Bishop's plans to the Dutch. With the arrival of the Dutch in Boston, Bishop has Josh kidnapped to entertain them in a werewolf death match, releasing him after Aidan agrees to return to his side. Believing that they have come to kill him, Bishop resolves an ultimatum from the Dutch: either cull the population or die. However, during a feast the next day before he revealed that he knew Marcus told them of his plans, Bishop poisoned the Dutch with juniper, laced into the blood of feeding-den prostitutes. Savoring his triumph, Bishop proceeds to kill the paralyzed Dutch one by one before Aidan saves Heggeman who goes off to notify the other vampire clans of Bishop's betrayal. Bishop retaliates by ambushing Aidan in his home, despite being uninvited, breaking the threshold and staying long enough to stake him before forced to leave. Fortunately, the stake narrowly misses Aidan's heart. Bishop later goes through Josh to tell Aidan that they will settle this in a fight to the death, but Josh uses the opportunity to set up the fight on the night of a full moon so he will kill Bishop. Aidan sees through this, having Sally trap Josh in the basement room so he and Bishop can fight. Having taken Celine's blood at her request, Aidan became equally matched to Bishop as he is decapitated when garroted by barbed wire. However, whenever Aidan drinks too much live blood, a hallucination of Bishop reappears. He pushes Aidan to hunt down Henry to kill him, but when Aidan cannot follow through, the vision of Bishop predicted this, as the father cannot kill the son. =Nora Sargeant= Nora Sargeant (Kristen Hager) is a nurse at the hospital where Josh and Aidan work. She is based on Nina Pickering from the British series. After being convinced by Ray to try having sex just before his monthly transformation, Josh awkwardly comes on to Nora and she rebuffs him by threatening sexual harassment charges against him if he ever speaks to her again. However, her opinion of Josh later changes when she sees him cheer up one of her patients on his day off, and she agrees to go on a date with him. After a series of tepid dates due to Josh being apprehensive of what will happen near the full moon, Nora confronts him just before his transformation. Overcome by animalistic urges, Josh and Nora make love. Sometime later, Nora reveals to Josh that she is pregnant with his child. In the events of the first-season finale, Nora finds Josh just as he transforms one last time, but he saves her from being attacked by his wolf form. However, the transformation also affects her pregnancy and she miscarries. The next morning, Josh tells her the truth about everything that has happened, and she accepts his apology. After he leaves, Nora checks a scratch she received from Josh after he transformed the previous night. One month later, while she worries that she has also been infected, she continually asks Josh what happens before he transforms, fearing that she has the symptoms. Her fears are temporarily assuaged when after she drops Josh off in the woods on the next full moon rises, and she does not immediately transform. However, as she prepares to drive off, she also transforms into a werewolf as Josh is being hunted down by Heggeman. She is shown fully transformed and she kills Heggeman. When Josh learns that she has been infected by him, and that she miscarried, he decides to search for a \\"cure\\", rather than return to medical school. Now able to see Sally, Nora consoles her after her encounter with Stevie and Dylan, revealing to the audience that she knows she killed Heggeman even though she told Josh she could remember nothing of the transformation. When Josh rents out storage units for them to transform in, Nora is initially reluctant to use it so Josh may observe them during the transformation, and is turned off even more when Josh reveals she murdered Heggeman, and she reveals it's a fact she already knows. Nora's ability to remember her actions during her transformed state make her unique as a werewolf that isn't a full blood. The strain is exacerbated when Josh's ex-fianc√©e Julia appears in Boston, and Nora initially feels that Josh loved Julia more, as he left her when he was a werewolf and he infected her, instead. That evening, Nora finds herself by the wolf compelled to stalk Julia, but she stops herself and decides to use the storage unit. Nora returns weeks later, asking for Josh's forgiveness, but Josh's love now lies with Julia. She tells him that Brynn changed after Connor's death, as he was the one holding her back and not the other way around. After she unsuccessfully asks for her job back, she comes across Sally who asks for her help to help Janet. Sally manages to reveal the truth to Janet through Nora, but this action causes Josh to pick Julia over her. Later, she approaches Josh to tell him that Brynn told her a way to remove the werewolf curse: Josh has to kill the werewolf that changed him. Sometime later, Josh is alerted to the fact that Nora is in the hospital, as she fell down a flight of stairs during the solar eclipse. She is happy that it happened though, because it shows her that Josh did not become a killer, as killing Ray would have lifted the curse off of both of them. However, when Sally reveals that she helped Josh lure Ray to kill him, she goes out to the woods to stop them. In the end, she has a handgun trained on Ray, who is threatening to kill Josh with the silver bullet rifle. As the scene changes, both guns are heard being shot. In the season 3 premiere, it is revealed that Ray was killed at the hands of Josh, but a month later only he has been cured of his lycanthropy, leaving Nora a werewolf. They spend the next year trying to find both Aidan and Sally, succeeding with bringing Sally back to life with the help of the witch Ms. Gilchrist. Josh and Nora then become married and later have twins in Season 4. =Suren= Suren (Dichen Lachman) is the daughter of the powerful vampire known only as \\"Mother\\" (she is also her biological daughter). Suren is around 700 years old, and her biological father was a Mongol warrior who taught her how to skin animals and humans alike. During the 1930s, Aidan and his prot√©g√© Henry were watching over Suren, who formed a relationship with Henry when Aidan restrained himself from her affections. However, Henry could not keep himself satiated with Suren as a lover, leading to her finding him with another woman at a ball at the Halloway Hotel the night before she and Mother are to leave Boston. Killing the woman in front of a room of human onlookers, all of whom were slaughtered under Mother's order to ensure their kind's existence is not exposed, Suren is punished for jeopardizing all vampires by being placed underground for eighty years. After Bishop's death, Mother decides to release Suren early to take over the Boston vampire instead of Aidan and is stationed in the hotel where she ironically caused the bloody massacre. With Aidan as her second in command, Suren first picks a new police liaison in Cecilia and personally sires her when Aidan refuses to. Regardless of her dissatisfaction with Aidan, she throws the Dutch out the trail when Heggeman ends up missing as a result of his death at newly transformed Nora's claws. When Suren decides to bring in a mobster into the vampire fold, Aidan protests, even though the mobster has caught one of Bishop's orphans who attacked children in broad daylight. When Aidan acquiesces later, he begins feasting on the mobster when he should be turning him. Suren is pleased at this turn of events, knowing it is what Aidan needs to become the vampire she knew ages ago and become her lover. However, Mother is less than thrilled that they have been enjoying each other rather than working and orders Suren and Aidan to hunt down Bishop's orphans. Months later, Suren has told Mother that they have culled all of the orphans, leading Aidan to use his renewed relationship with Henry to gather up the orphans. Suren, who has been watching, orders that the owner of a house who gets paid for vampires to pass the threshold to transfer ownership to her human liaison. She then orders the orphans to be uninvited, killing everyone but Henry and Aidan. Aidan later presents Henry to her, and she decides that in order to be properly punished for his actions 80 years ago, she will skin Henry alive, a painful procedure that as a vampire he will survive from. Later, Aidan convinces Suren to experience the \\"mundane\\" aspects of his life, which begins by having dinner with Josh, Julia, and Sally. After impressing Josh with her love of Antiques Roadshow, she realizes that Aidan had been in a relationship with Julia, but puts off everyone's fears by making the situation better. That night, she expresses her fears that she does not fit in with Aidan's world, but he assuages the fears. The next day, Mother returns to Boston to express her gratitude that Suren was able to shape the city back up. She rewards her by placing her in charge of New England, while excommunicating Aidan from the vampire clans. To escape the oppression, Aidan and Suren run away together to a hotel to start, but Suren soon grows hungry. After Aidan is attacked by other vampires, she asks him to give up, and she will return to Boston. Aidan promises her that he will find a way, and he leaves Suren alone in the hotel, where she goes through withdrawal and thinks about the past. She decides to return to Boston to take her place as its leader, eventually telling Aidan that she did it to save him from Mother's oppression. At Mother's going away party, Mother names Suren as her successor, but gives her one last task to show she is truly strong: Suren must kill Aidan. Suren refuses, as she loves him, and falls to the carpet. As Mother cuddles her, she stakes Suren, and she crumbles to dust in front of Aidan. Publicity materials for season 2 indicated that the character was to be named Izumi, but this was apparently changed during production.  Recurring characters  =Season 1= *Rebecca Flynt (Sarah Allen) is a fellow nurse at the hospital before she and Aidan go on a date and Aidan accidentally kills her in a vampiric blood lust. When Aidan calls Bishop to \\"clean up\\" afterwards, Bishop turns Rebecca instead with the intent of using her as a pawn to control Aidan. She fully embraces the fact that she is a vampire, flaunting her abilities and bloodlust by feeding on and killing anyone she wants without being discovered. At one point Rebecca tries to feed on Josh but as he is a werewolf, she decides against it. Once the novelty of killing starts wearing off, she approaches Aidan in an attempt to become more like him and less dependent on feeding off live humans like other vampires. However, her conviction is not strong enough and she falls back in with Bishop's clan, further involving herself in the drama between Bishop and Aidan. She is killed when she begs Aidan to stake her. She is based on the character of Lauren in the original British series. *Marcus Damnian (Vincent Leclerc) is one of the vampires in Bishop's clan. He works at a local Boston funeral home, covering up murders perpetrated by other vampires. Marcus often and blatantly tries to one-up Aidan to prove his loyalty to Bishop, going so far as to track Josh to his family's home with the intent of murdering them all before being foiled. He is killed by Rebecca to prevent him from killing Aidan as well as revenge for having been behind the death of Bernie. His characterization is similar to the original British role of Seth. *Emily Levison (Alison Louder) is Josh's younger sister, with whom he was very close before Josh gets bitten by a werewolf and intentionally disappears from his family. She accidentally runs into Josh while visiting her girlfriend Jackie (Rhiannon Moller-Trotter) who was a patient at the hospital in which he works, and afterward tries to re-involve herself in his life. However, when Josh nearly kills her after she unknowingly traps herself with him just before he transforms into a wolf, he demands that she never see him again. Emily later returns to seek comfort with Josh after she breaks up with Jackie, but when she is attacked by Marcus in retaliation for Josh and Ray's attack on the vampires, Josh takes Emily back to their family home, where he leaves her there after Marcus returns once more. In season 2, she tries to help Julia, Josh's ex-fianc√©e, and Josh get back together. Emily comforts Josh after Julia dies in a traffic accident. In season 3, Emily returns to take Josh on his bachelor party to a strip club, along with Aidan and Kenny. She discovers Josh and Aidan's secret as a werewolf and a vampire, respectively, after Aidan kills a vampire stripper to save Josh, and storms away. She later comes to accept the truth about the supernatural and returns to help get the wedding started for Josh and Nora. Despite knowing about Josh and Nora being werewolves and Aidan being a vampire, she still does not know of the existence of Sally. *Cara (Katy Breier) is an orderly hired by the hospital after Rebecca disappears. Cara is flirtatious to Aidan, but when Rebecca returns as a vampire, she feeds on Cara. Facing Rebecca's ironic action and despite her goading, Aidan refuses to turn Cara to save her, and she dies. She is based on the character Becca from the first episode of the British version. *Ray (Andreas Apergis) is an older wanderer who, as it turns out, has been covertly following Josh for some time, observing his lunar transformations. Ray reveals himself to Josh admitting that he is also a werewolf, and can teach Josh the basics of being one - including getting through the changes without killing anything. While he initially refuses the help, Aidan convinces him otherwise, and allows Ray to live with them. When Ray outstays his welcome, Josh confronts him at the next full moon where he reveals he wants to form a whole pack of werewolves, and that he was the one who attacked Josh two years prior and turned him into a werewolf. After removing Ray from his life, Josh tracks Ray down as he is under the impression that killing Ray will cure himself and Nora of the werewolf curse, but Ray has reunited with his family, giving Josh second thoughts. After Julia's death and discovering that he can cure Nora and himself, Josh lures Ray to the woods, with Sally's assistance, and holds him at gunpoint until Nora distracts him. After a scuffle, Ray gains the upper hand over Josh, and holds him at gunpoint with the silver bullet-loaded rifle, with Nora training a handgun on him. As the scene changes, both guns are heard going off. His fate is revealed in the season 3 premiere, where Josh has bludgeoned him to death with a rock, curing him of the werewolf curse. Ray's heart is later retrieved by Josh and Nora to use in the spell Ms. Gilchrist performs to bring Sally back to life. Donna then tracks down Ray's body, proclaiming that she will need to find a use for it, revealed to be as a faithful undead assistant. Ray is dispatched to kill the medium Ilana Myers after Donna suspects that Ilana has taught Sally some magical spell to fight back against her. When Josh, Aidan, and Sally enter the pocket dimension that Donna calls home, Ray is there to confront them, as Donna suspected that Sally would attempt to bring Josh with her. Ray allows Sally and Aidan to confront Donna, as his only qualms are with Josh. After a fight in which Ray appears to have the upper hand, Josh manages to taunt Ray, who has magically transformed into a werewolf without the full moon, to attack him, and manages to behead Ray during Ray's lunge, killing him once and for all. He is based on Tully from the British series. *Danny Angeli (Gianpaolo Venuta) was Sally's fianc√© before her untimely death. He owned the house where Aidan and Josh live, and deeply cared for Sally while she was alive. However, it is revealed that he has a temper and is directly responsible for Sally's death. Danny becomes aware that Sally is trying to haunt him, but he taunts her saying that is not intimidated by her attempts, eventually lying to Bridget as to the events of Sally's death to thwart her plans. After he hires the exorcist Ilanato remove Sally from her haunting, Sally possesses the Ilana, revealing the true events, and causing a rift between Danny and Bridget. Danny ultimately tries to burn the house down, but Sally traps him inside, leaving Josh and Aidan to reveal that they know about what happened. He confesses his arson and murder of Sally to the police after she reveals herself to him and threatens him. When Sally believes that Danny is somehow responsible for the Reaper and the recent poltergeist events happening in the house, she and Aidan discover that he was killed by his cellmate in prison. Danny then reveals himself to Sally, having become more adept as a ghost as he was killed in prison. Just as he is about to kill her, the Reaper appears and destroys Danny's essence. He reappears during the solar eclipse, happy to see Sally after being in Limbo, to which he returns once the eclipse ends. He seems to have accepted Limbo as proper punishment for the crimes he performed against Sally in life. He is based on the character of Owen from the original British series. *Bridget (Angela Galuppo) was one of Sally's friends in life. She is based on the character of Janey in the British series. Sally discovers that she has begun trying to date Danny since her death, and Sally works to break up the relationship before Aidan convinces her not to. Sally gives Bridget her approval, and Bridget begins to help Danny move on. However, when Sally discovers that Bridget is being abused by Danny because of her haunting, she attempts to contact Bridget to reveal what happened, but Danny manages to convince Bridget otherwise. She breaks up with Danny after the exorcism goes wrong. After resolving the issue with Donna, Sally meets up with Bridget, who after the experiences with Sally in her death has joined a wicca coven, as she is upset that she may have failed Sally in death. She takes Sally to a meeting, where Sally sees that several ghosts come by to use the spiritually open women as vessels. She stops a ghost from taking over Bridget, and ends the meeting early when she dissipates the other ghost. Later, Sally tells Bridget that she should move on from the spirituality, and gives Bridget the Spirit Lock to keep her safe. *Nick Finn (Pat Kiely) was Sally's teaching assistant while she was in college. Both Sally and Nick had unrequited feelings for each other, but they manage to find each other in death, Nick having drowned in a boating accident. Nick and Sally begin dating, but Nick relives the moments of his death each and every day prefaced by a coughing fit before he explodes into a large volume of water. Nick and Sally part ways after a short time dating, but then meet up again when Zoe invites Sally to her ghost support group. Sally believes that the meeting is good and they will begin dating again, but Zoe reveals that she and Nick are intimate. After realizing that the Reaper personality is part of her, Sally shreds Nick in front of Josh and Aidan. When ghosts begin reappearing during the solar eclipse, Sally realizes that there is one more chance for Zoe to see Nick. She returns to the brownstone first, where Nick reveals that he is in a form of purgatory he is calling Limbo, home to ghosts who have been shredded or those who take the wrong Door, a place where he realizes he exists and can see, but there is nothing to experience. However, when Zoe finds him, he tells her that he is at peace now, to make Zoe feel closure. Sally helps him escape Limbo by hitching a ride back into physical life with her, along with Stevie, and he and Zoe begin a proper intimate relationship. However, he begins to decompose, much like Sally, and takes to catching stray cats in the neighborhood and eating them, which staves off his hunger and halts the process of decomposition. When Sally reveals she too has eaten a live creature, he is relieved and tries to explain that what they are doing is right. However, that night when Zoe comes home to find him eating another cat, his eyes are glazed over as he proclaims that he is only eating, but that he is still hungry and lunges for Zoe. Zoe manages to avoid death by bludgeoning Nick with a baseball bat, and he is happy that he has finally free of the hunger. His Door appears and leads him to the other side, but the golden clam shell Sally sees on the Door is later exactly the same one she sees on Stevie's. After entering Donna's pocket dimension, Sally demands that Nick and Stevie be set free, but Aidan realizes that Donna must have already eaten their souls, which she confirms. *Bernie (Jason Spevack) is the son of Aidan's neighbor Cindy. Aidan helps Bernie stand up to some neighborhood bullies and becomes fast friends with him, as Bernie reminds Aidan of his long-dead son. When Bernie finds and sneaks home (unknown by Aidan) the homemade snuff video Rebecca made for Aidan, Cindy catches Bernie watching it (before Rebecca kills the other man) and forbids Aidan from coming near her son ever, again. Sometime later, Bernie is accidentally hit by a car and dies, but is turned by Rebecca into a vampire in an effort to cheer Aidan up by giving him a new family. When it appears that Bernie has killed the two bullies that used to pick on him, Bishop berates Aidan about the dead boys and the consequences of turning a child into a vampire, leaving Aidan no choice but to kill Bernie more mercifully with a wooden stake himself. It is later revealed that Bishop had Marcus kill the boys and make it appear that Bernie was the perpetrator. *Ilana Myers (Ellen David) is an exorcist hired by Danny to rid Sally from the house. She goes through the motions, slowly weakening Sally through the rite, until Sally possesses her in a fit of desperation, revealing the truth behind her death. Years later, Ilana is hired by Josh and Nora in their attempts to bring Sally back from Limbo, but she cannot help and in fact fears the house. She instead directs them to find Ms. Gilchrist. She later meets Sally, face to face, for the first time and helps her learn how to fight Donna. Ilana is killed by Ray, who is sent by Donna to do her dirty work, for helping Sally. *Heggeman (Terry Kinney) is a member of a group of powerful elder vampires called \\"the Dutch\\", due to their Dutch origins and habit of living and hibernating in Pennsylvania Dutch country. Well over a thousand years old, Heggeman is one of the oldest-living vampires and commands great fear and respect. Heggeman is a very strong proponent of vampire traditions and does not look favorably on actions he deems \\"abnormal\\" (such as having a relationship with a human). When the Dutch last came to Boston, Bishop's sire Carlo (Lorne Brass) was killed and Bishop made the head of the Boston vampire family if he broke off his relationship with Jane (Lena Kleine). They return to Boston after Marcus reveals that Bishop is trying to increase vampire numbers to bring them into the public and overtake humans as the dominant species. Due to their old-fashioned ways, the Dutch are nearly all killed by Bishop, with Heggeman saved by Aidan at the last moment. After Aidan kills Bishop, Heggeman gives him control of the Boston vampires and informs him that \\"she\\" wants to see him. *Celine (Nathalie Breuer, Laurence Leboeuf in the past) is a woman from Montreal that Aidan fell in love with in the 1970s after he left Boston. In the past, she pushed for Aidan to turn her into a vampire, but he was not willing to give that life to her. When Bishop finds them, Aidan plans for the two of them to leave town so Bishop cannot harm her, but they fight as Celine does not want to leave her family. When she leaves the house later that night, Bishop intercepts her and has his way with her and feeds from her, forcing her to never tell anyone or else he will harm her family. Celine meets up with Aidan in the present day when she goes to Suffolk County Hospital to spend her final days since her lung cancer has become terminal. Aidan's feelings for her resurface and he tells her he will turn her into a vampire, but she declines as she does not want to watch her loved ones grow old and die while she cannot. After Aidan is mortally wounded by Bishop, she offers herself to Aidan so she can die in peace and he can regain his strength. She is mentioned on several occasions and is also seen in flashbacks. She is based on Josie from the British series. =Season 2= *Stevie Adkins (Robert Naylor) is a teenage boy from Sally's high school who committed suicide their junior year. He has since been haunting their high school, and when she goes to the class reunion, they meet up with each other to reminisce. As a suicide, Stevie does not get a door to the other side. He introduces Sally to Dylan and \\"Boner\\", but is later forced to shred Dylan after he tries to rape Sally after they possess bodies. Sally seeks his help when she needs to learn how to shred ghosts to save herself from the Reaper. But after the Reaper convinces her that she has to take over his role, he makes her first task to shred Stevie, as only they are allowed to shred ghosts. After Stevie states that he might shred the ghost of Van, his old bully, should he die, Sally realizes that the Reaper is right, just as the Reaper shreds Stevie. Stevie, after spending time in Limbo watching his family live on without him every day, is brought back to life along with Nick and Sally. After Josh gives him some money to get out of town, he and Sally find Stevie again when they try to warn his parents that he is alive and is craving flesh. When they find the house, they find Stevie inside, who reveals he had gone as far as Memphis before returning, seeing his parents for the first time since his passing, and ultimately causing their death due to the spell. Weeks later, he ate their corpses due to the hunger he felt from the reanimation, but then resorted to killing the mailman. As a last resort, he has been trying to kill himself by hanging, but chickens out at the last minute, and asks Josh and Sally to do it for him. After Josh manages to kill Stevie, his door appears, but when Sally notices that it is the same as Nick's from earlier in the day, she realizes something is wrong and warns him not to enter but is too late. After entering Donna's pocket dimension, Sally demands that Nick and Stevie be set free, but Aidan realizes that Donna must have already eaten their souls, which she confirms. *Mother (Deena Aziz) is the main antagonist in season 2 and the queen of all vampires (or at the very least, of those in North America), the \\"She\\" who wished to see Aidan in the season 1 finale. She built her vast empire from the ground up, and was fond of relating the story of her rise to power to her daughter, Suren. She comes to Boston to decide the fate of Aidan and Bishop's \\"orphaned\\" vampires. Though Aidan attempts to prevent their demise, she orders that Bishop's excess sires to be culled and Aidan not take his place (as Heggeman and the Dutch wanted), but instead assist her daughter in bringing Boston back under control. Mother promised Aidan freedom from the demands of the council and the vampire community should her daughter succeed. Mother later ordered Heggeman to assassinate Josh, who is a barrier to her plans for Aidan. Mother is the most powerful (and thus, probably oldest) vampire seen in the series thus far, both politically and physically. When Aidan and Suren fulfill the goals Mother set out for them, Mother keeps Suren in her position in Boston, despite her requests, and gives Aidan his freedom by banishing him from the vampire society. After Suren leaves him, Aidan plans to kill Mother, but she sees through the trap and captures him, presenting him to Suren to kill so she can be her successor. When Suren refuses, Mother stakes her and then commits Aidan to the ground, as Aidan tells her she has just killed the only person who ever loved her, after having been revealed in flashbacks that Suren is her biological daughter from when both were human. In the season 3 premiere, Mother is revealed to have died from the mysterious virus killing all vampires. *Cecilia (Olunik√© Adeliyi) is a cop in the Boston Police Department who Suren chooses to be the new vampire liaison in the police. Aidan is first tasked with changing her, but when he does not, Suren does instead. When Nora and the twins kill Will, Josh turns to Cecilia to eliminate the case from the police department's radar in exchange for the twins. When she follows through with her side of the deal, Josh gives her Heggeman's rifle and the twins' address. However, they overpower her and use her as bait to lure in Aidan for a \\"McLean family vampire hunt\\" on the night of the full moon. Aidan finds her, but she is too weak and she tells Aidan to leave her behind. Aidan reluctantly respects her request, and she is torn apart by the four werewolves as he escapes. *Atlee (Kyle Gatehouse) is one of the Dutch who accompanies Heggeman on the trip to Boston when Suren is reinstated. He becomes suspicious when Heggeman mysteriously disappears after being tasked by an unknown, to him, task by Mother. He returns to Boston to question Aidan on Heggeman's disappearance, and gets tied up in Josh's lie to Cecilia that the McLean twins are responsible for Heggeman's death. After taking Atlee to hunt the twins, their plans are reversed when Josh, Nora, Connor, and Brynn all change and Atlee retreats, leaving Aidan to save Cecilia. Aidan later gives Atlee the corpse of Connor and tells him to never return to Boston. Aidan later confronts Atlee and blackmails him so he and Suren can remain in hiding, to which Atlee reluctantly agrees. *Dylan (Zack Peladeau) is a ghost and friend of Stevie, who is introduced to Sally. Dylan teaches Sally how to possess people, until he attempts to make use of their possessed bodies to rape her. Stevie intervenes and shreds him. *Phil (Jonah Carson), nicknamed \\"Boner\\" (it is implied that he lost his penis prior to death), is a ghost and friend of Stevie. He leaves after Stevie shreds Dylan, and the Reaper makes Sally believe that Stevie shredded him as well. But when Boner asks Sally what has happened to Stevie, she begins to realize the Reaper has not been telling her the truth. *Julia (Natalie Brown) is a physician who applies for residency at Suffolk County Hospital, meeting Aidan as she applies for the job. She and Aidan begin dating. When Aidan introduces her to Josh and Nora, she and Josh already know each other as she was his former fianc√©e. After this discovery, Aidan breaks off his relationship with her. After Josh and Nora break up, Emily inadvertently reunites Josh and Julia, and Julia reveals she has only come to Boston so she can see Josh, again. When their mutual friend Stu appears as a ghost to Josh, Stu does his best to try to keep Josh and Julia apart until he realizes that they want to be back together, using the opportunity to possess Josh, which rekindles their relationship, something Josh did not want to do to avoid revealing his lycanthropy to her. When Josh learns that he can cure himself by killing Ray, but discovers that Ray has reunited with his family, he decides to tell Julia the truth. But a solar eclipse reveals the information prematurely, and Julia recoils when Josh approaches her partially transformed. She backs up into the street and is hit by a car. After transforming back to human form Josh returns to the scene, but due to his affliction, he fails to realize that the Julia he meets is actually her ghost. She has died from her injuries. She admits she always loved him, and he should have told her the truth from the start at which point her Door appears. She gives her final goodbye and passes through the Door. *Zoe Gonzales (Susanna Fournier) is a nurse at Suffolk County Hospital who has a sixth sense and can see ghosts. She keeps watch over the nursery where she controls whether or not ghosts get to be reincarnated into the babies in the nursery. After she denies Sally the option to be reincarnated, Sally pleads with her to help her with the dark force attacking her, and Zoe agrees. Zoe begins a relationship with Sally's ex-boyfriend Nick, even though he is a ghost. When the Reaper personality takes over Sally, Aidan and Josh plead with Zoe to help them, even though Zoe later learns that Sally shredded Nick. After saving Sally from the \\"Reaper\\", Zoe says she can never forgive Sally for shredding Nick and leaves the house. Sally later tries to reconcile with Zoe, who has given up working with ghosts because of all of the bad memories, until a solar eclipse starts bringing back all of the shredded ghosts. At the house, Zoe and Nick reunite for one last time, and after Nick lies that he is now in a better place and disappears, Zoe thanks Sally for reuniting them. Zoe later contacts Sally when she starts to feel afraid of Nick, as he bit her hard enough once to break the skin and has been watching her ever since. Her fears are later confirmed when she comes home to find Nick eating a cat, and then he lunges at her in hunger. She defends herself at the last moment, using a baseball bat that they had in the house, and after Nick warns her about what may become of Sally as well, she asks Sally to leave and never see her again. *Brynn (Tracy Spiridakos) and Connor McLean (Jon Cor) are a sister and brother pair of purebred werewolves, people who were born as werewolves rather than being turned. As such, their bodies are in a constant state of the feeling that Josh and Nora feel near the full moon, and must take wolfsbane to depress the urges. They are from a rich family, and when Josh mentions he is looking for a cure, Connor's interest is piqued until Connor and Brynn reveal that they wish to become the wolf all of the time. Josh turns down their offer, but later recants, knowing that with their funding he has the best chance to cure himself and Nora. They convince Nora to give into the instincts of the wolf, leading to their collective attack. Josh, becoming untrusting of them, tells Cecilia that they have killed Heggeman to remove the murder case, but when Cecilia goes to kill them they overpower her and capture her, putting Aidan in their grasp in his attempt to save Cecilia. During the full moon, they hunt down Aidan, with Josh and Nora, and together finish off a dying Cecilia. While Connor is gloating the next day for having brought out Josh's bad side when Aidan appears and shoots Connor with a silver bullet from Heggeman's gun, killing him immediately. Brynn breaks down and Aidan tells her to never return to Boston, before he turns in Connor's corpse to Atlee. Nora stays with Brynn after the event, but Nora returns to Boston, telling Josh that Connor was actually the one who kept Brynn in check rather than the other way around In season 3 Nora reveals to Josh she killed Brynn to protect a man she planned to kill for sport. *Tim Forest (Martin Thibaudeau) is a new doctor at Suffolk County Hospital who Zoe has a crush on. Sally attempts to hook them up, but when Zoe begins a relationship with Nick Finn, instead, Sally takes the opportunity to possess Dr. Forest's girlfriend Janet Hines (Amber Goldfarb) to experience the love that they have for each other. Sally gets stuck in Janet's body and gets in trouble when Tim planned a visit from his mother so she could meet Janet, when the entity Sally believes is the \\"Reaper\\" attacks her, removing her from Sally's body. Months later, Sally learns that Janet is in the hospital's psychiatric ward because of Sally's memories mixed in Janet's. With Nora's assistance, Sally reveals the truth to Janet, and Janet is released from the psych ward. *Will (Sebastien Roberts) was Nora's former boyfriend who was highly abusive to her, resulting in a large portion of Nora's skin burned beyond repair. He shows up in Boston, working as a general contractor, causing Nora to recoil in fear. As it is near the full moon, Connor works to convince Josh to take his revenge against the man for harming Nora in the past, but when he does he realizes he is no better than Will. Later, Brynn approaches Nora who reveals she's known Will has come into town for some time, as her wolf was well aware of it, and Brynn convinces her to give into the wolf. That night, when the moon is at its fullest, the twins and Nora viciously attack Will, killing him for sport. His death brings the Boston Police onto Josh's trail, believing that he had something to do with the man's death. However, Cecilia interferes, using her vampiric suggestion powers to throw them off the trail, and Josh into her debt. *Samid (Joseph Antaki) and Rena Malik (Rahnuma Panthaky) are Sally's father and mother. Sally is reunited with them when Josh discovers that Rena is in Suffolk County Hospital and is dying. After Rena passes away, and Sally orders Josh to dress her in something other than a hospital gown, Sally wants to spend time with her mother, but Rena has other plans, namely reuniting with their old neighbor and her former lover Gerry Patterson (Graham Cuthbertson). This fact appalls Sally, but Rena later admits that she did not want to spend time with her because she still lives in the house she was murdered in. Sally later appeals to Rena to shred her so Sally can enter Limbo to save Nick and the others who she shredded. Rena refuses, and later goes to talk to Sally to tell her she is proud of what she has done and how strong she has become in the afterlife, causing her own Door to appear. Rena offers it to Sally, knowing that she will be able to go to Limbo, even if it means she will go crazy, as she knows Sally will find a way out. Sally, instead, shreds herself, letting her mother use her own Door. *Henry Durham (Kyle Schmid) is Aidan's vampire prot√©g√© who Aidan first met while Henry was a medic at a French field hospital during World War I. After a French soldier discovers Aidan's vampire nature, the soldier attacks him, and in the struggle stakes Henry. With no other choice, Aidan kills everyone in the hospital except for two: Henry, who he turns into a vampire, and another soldier, so Henry can have his first drink. Their relationship strained in the 1930s when Henry, who Aidan promised a better life like the one Mother and Suren have, decided to take matters into his own hands and beds Suren. However, he could not control his urges and slept with other women, leading to the massacre at the Halloway Hotel when Suren found him with another woman. Aidan ordered him to leave Boston and never return, but they meet in the present day after Suren is ordered to cull Bishop's orphaned vampires. After the urging of a vision of Bishop in his head, Aidan confronts Henry, but cannot find it in his heart to kill his own \\"son\\", and instead promises he will find a way for Henry to be reintegrated. This comes about when he has Henry gather up all of the orphans in a house owned by a man who offers passage over the threshold for money, and the house is passed into Suren's hands via her living liaison. Aidan saves Henry from being uninvited from the house, and presents him to Suren who literally takes her pound of flesh from Henry for her imprisonment by flaying him alive. Aidan takes Henry to the brownstone to recuperate, and brings him two women he has compelled to believe Henry is the most beautiful man in the world. Henry begins to take his fill from the two women, until Aidan's suggestion begins to wear off, leading Aidan to murder the girls and for Henry to drink them dry, healing rapidly. Henry is later Aidan's only compatriate in vampire society, having him deliver a message to Suren so the two can run away with each other. He is later sent by Mother to kill Aidan, but he helps Aidan survive, while hoping that just the two of them can survive on their own, without Suren. Instead, Aidan turns him away, and then asks for his help to kill Mother, but he is caught before the plan can be completed and is seriously injured. After the year passes, Henry saves Aidan from a pack of werewolves who have set traps in the black market on flu-free blood. He reveals he has stayed alive for the year due to his discovery of Emma who was never infected, and the two begin a relationship. However, it is all because Henry has Emma compelled to stay with him and he keeps her locked up in their apartment. When Aidan lets her free, Henry is angered as there is no certain way that they will be able to live, despite Aidan's promise that they will find a way. After weeks of failing to find clean blood, Henry gives into his hunger and eats from someone who had the flu. Aidan only discovers this when they go to drink from someone oJosh had found for them, but by then it is too late. He leaves Aidan's side, saying he has realized that all who come close to Aidan die, and later dies off-screen. *The Reaper is a malevolent shadow-like force that attacks Sally when she dreams of her doorway. She soon discovers it is not limited to her dreams when it begins attacking her in reality. The Reaper inadvertently removes Sally from Janet's body when she becomes stuck in her, but it soon begins to haunt Janet as well. When the spirit of the recently murdered Danny appears in the house to take revenge on Sally, the Reaper appears behind him and punches him through the heart, \\"reaping\\" his spirit. The entity then takes on a human shape (Dusan Dukic) confirming to Sally that it is indeed a Reaper. He reveals that Sally's existence after her Door is causing spiritual disorder, and that she is next to be Reaped. Danny's reaping has given her time to say her goodbyes. A week later, the Reaper comes to Sally as he has found a loophole: she has to become a Reaper. Sally reluctantly tries to learn from the Reaper but ultimately cannot bring herself to be one. However, after several of her ghost friends are reaped, it is revealed that the \\"Reaper\\" Sally has been seeing does not actually exist. The Reaper is simply a manifestation of Sally's own inner darkness, and that she has been the one reaping ghosts the entire time. Within Sally's mind, the Reaper personality takes on the name \\"Scott\\" and is Sally's fianc√©, trying to take over Sally's soul by tricking her into moving out of the house in her mind. He traps Josh, Aidan, and Zoe in the brownstone on the chance that some of them will die, as it is a full moon and Aidan is in blood withdrawal. Zoe manages to get Sally to escape the Reaper's clutches, but when left alone she can still see the Reaper as he is a part of her personality. Only after Sally helps Janet Hines does she gain the strength to banish the personality from her thoughts. The Reaper returns again after Sally possesses Ray's wife, having slipped as he predicted, and begins to harass her, steeling herself to go into Limbo by any means necessary to alleviate the guilt she has for shredding the other ghosts and to find a way to bring them back. However, after her mother's Door appears, Sally decides to shred herself, sending herself to Limbo and destroying the Reaper in the process. *Beth (Erica Deutshman) and Holly (Imogen Haworth) are a pair of party girls that AIdan compels to the house so he can restore Henry to his full health after he was flayed alive. However, the illusion Aidan casts to hide Henry's fleshless body and their own bloodiness fails and he is forced to kill them. While suffering from a blood withdrawal a year later, they come to haunt him, taunting him to feed on people, including the sickly Kenny. *Stu (Jay Baruchel) was a mutual friend of Josh's and Julia's in college, who was killed on the camping trip by the werewolf that turned Josh several years ago. He reappears in Boston after learning from the Ithaca supernatural community that Josh is a werewolf. In reality, he has been following Julia as he has been in love with her since college, and wants to use Josh to experience that love. After he pushes Josh to not sleep with her, he possesses Josh and makes love to Julia, an event Josh did not want to happen because rekindling the relationship now that he is a werewolf would be just as dangerous as having a one-night stand. Stu watches from afar as Josh takes the former option, before leaving. *Chelsea (Catherine B√©rub√©) is a mutual friend of Josh and Julia's from back in Ithaca. She visits Boston when Julia reveals she has met someone, without revealing it is Josh. When they meet, Chelsea sternly tells Josh to reveal whatever secrets he may have, before leaving the two alone. =Season 3= *Donna Gilchrist (Amy Aquino) is a witch that the medium Ilana (the exorcist Danny hired in season 1) directs Josh and Nora to in order to bring Sally back from Limbo. After charging them $2,000 and the heart of a person one of them has killed, she has them bring her Sally's body, as she is not simply bringing Sally back from Limbo but bringing her back to life. The incantation is successful, but she uses the spell to also locate the body whose heart she used: Ray. Donna appears once more when Trent walks through what appears to be his door, only to slice through Trent's spirit with a cleaver, reducing him to a pile of sawdust. She then eats some of the dust from the pile, and her face becomes younger. After Sally accidentally bumps into Robbie, she goes to Donna to beg for her to spare her brother's life. After declining the pleas, and after holding Josh and Sally away with her witchcraft, Donna reveals there is a way to save Robbie, and anyone else Sally might see, and that is for Sally to hand her soul over to Donna once she dies her natural death. Sally reluctantly agrees, while Josh realizes that Donna anticipated this exact chain of events. When Sally asks her what will become of her soul, Donna dismisses the question by saying it belongs to her now and she has no right to ask. After Nick and Stevie die as a result of their falling too deep into the hunger for human flesh, they both enter the same spiritual Door with a gilded clam on the outside. With Ilana's help, Sally realizes that the door leads to Donna rather than the afterlife, and when she finally dies her spirit will also pass through the door and straight to Donna. Sally, Josh, and Aidan pass through the door, discovering Donna has brought Ray back to life to be her guard dog, and Aidan and Sally confront Donna. Aidan realizes that Donna must have already eaten Nick's and Stevie's souls for sustenance, and when she goes to attack Sally to do the same, the incantation Ilana taught her begins to cause Donna to age rapidly. Although they believe it is weakening her, Donna reveals that it is only a \\"true face\\" spell, showing what she truly looks like after having been alive since at least the 17th century, admitting that the Salem witch trials were depressing. Donna says that she had originally planned to have some other use for Sally's soul, but Sally's insistence to know that plan and her resistance to death has made her change her mind, and she only plans on devouring her soul to regain her youth. Everything would have gone according to plan for her, as she knew that all who are brought back from the dead eventually feel the need to see their loved ones, and their souls would have gone her way, but once Sally demanded that her brother be saved, the deal changed and that would cause herself, Stevie, and Nick, to begin decomposing and becoming flesh-eating zombies. Just as Donna prepares to devour Sally's soul, Aidan reveals he has brought Sally's heart with him and throws it into a fire, intending to reverse the spell binding Sally to Donna. As flames begin to engulf Donna, she performs another incantation to send the flames to Sally, who realizes the futility of the situation and allows Donna to devour her soul. She is turned into sawdust and Donna breathes it in, regaining her youthful complexion, but she soon begins to radiate light and in a scream of pain explodes, sending Josh, Aidan, and Sally's spirit back to the house, seemingly defeating Donna for good. However, Sally later sees a set of candles Emily has blown out burn brightly again, and violently, before dying down, suggesting Donna is not yet out of their lives. She reveals herself to Sally, revealing that they are linked after her death at her hands, and brings Sally into a purgatory in order to keep either of them from disrupting the balance of the world with their magic powers. After Sally escapes through Donna's death spot at the hands of a bloodthirsty witch hunt in Amherst, she has Sally summon her to try to trap her, again, but this only results in the spellbook becoming a part of Sally. Sally later has to summon her once more to ask for help in reviving her brother Robbie, and through their time together she discovers that Donna was unjustly killed, having not been a witch at the time of her first death, and was then brought back to life by a coven of witches to be their new member. This also reveals to Sally the means to bring a person back from the dead without the consequences of Sally's first revival: another ghost must be sacrificed. Donna offers herself up as the sacrifice, but Robbie's reluctance to follow through ultimately leads to Donna asking Sally to let her spirit remain trapped between dimensions. During Sally's trip back in time, changing the course of history, Donna appears again after she discovers Saly is causing problems for herself in the timeline after her death. This iteration of Donna helps Sally return to her original timeline, but during the trip Sally observes a horrifying future. *Liam McLean (Xander Berkeley) is the father of the twins and, like his children, is a purebred werewolf. He admits that his parents and children said he was too impatient and too direct; Liam also thinks more like a wolf than a human, believing in packs and that Nora and Josh (who don't share the same beliefs) would join him. In overview, Liam seems insane. After discovering Connor's head mounted on a wall in the home of the remaining Dutch as a trophy, he makes it his mission to hunt down his son's killer. But first, he seeks out Nora as she was the last person that Brynn ever mentioned being with. She tracks Nora down on the night of a full moon, just as she is about to change in the storage unit. Although Nora tells him she has not seen Brynn in over a year, he decides to lock the two of them together so his wolf can sort out the truth. The two survive the night, as Liam says that werewolves do not kill each other, but Liam is still trying to find out what has happened to his children, including why Josh received $1,700 from Connor before his death, ultimately learning that Josh cured himself by killing Ray, but Nora adds that it was to save her. He is satisfied until he discovers that Aidan is alive and well, and healthy at that. He tasks the two with killing him, but Josh decides to hold Liam at gunpoint to tell him to stay away from Nora and Aidan. Later, Liam arrives at the house, having found Erin, and welcomes Josh into the pack. However, Liam's return of Erin to the house is all a ploy to kill Aidan, using Erin's apparent innocence to lure Aidan into a false sense of security, all to have her poison his clean blood supply with her own blood. The plan jumps ahead too far when Aidan returns home right after Erin taints the blood, and Liam rushes to the house at her call. Josh later realizes Liam is the one to blame for these events, but he cannot stop Liam from acting as he wishes. He goes to Erin while she is hospitalized, congratulating her on meeting her destined fate as a member of his pack, and smothers her with a pillow. Later, he stalks Blake who reveals to him that his son's killer is in Boston. He later tracks down Aidan, intending to kill him for having killed Connor and suspecting him of having killed Brynn. In the last moments before the full moon, he injects Aidan with virus-tainted blood, but is stopped from doing much damage by Josh who fires several rounds at him. In the escape from the transformed Liam, Josh is scratched by the werewolf. Liam lays low for the next several weeks until he appears outside Josh and Nora's honeymoon cabin, eye scarred over from Josh's silver knife attack at the last full moon, congratulating Nora on her marriage while she is outside getting firewood. *Trent (John Bregar) is one of Sally's friends from high school, having met through her brother Robbie. Despite Josh reminding Sally that Donna warned them that she could not see anyone from her past, Sally keeps Trent's company and attention, leading to a mutual attraction. Although intending to spend the night together, Trent suddenly falls ill and bids Sally a good night, intending to take her out on a proper date rock climbing. However, Sally and Josh discover Trent has mysteriously died the next morning, seemingly as a result of the blood magic used to bring Sally back to life. Sally does her best to help his spirit move onto the other side, even revealing that Trent cheated with her to his fianc√©e Candice, but she only reveals that she had been cheating on him for a year. Trent leaves angrily, and hours later discovers what appears to be his door. He walks through and finds himself in Donna's soup kitchen, where she reveals he will not be spending the afterlife anywhere anymore by slicing through him with a cleaver, turning him into a pile of sawdust. *Emma (Kimberly-Sue Murray) is Henry's girlfriend, having become a couple as she never caught the flu virus that kills vampires. After Henry offers her to Aidan so he can restore his strength, Aidan discovers that Emma is being kept prisoner through force and Henry's compelling powers, and she has even tried to take her own life. Rather than watch Emma die in apparent captivity, he lets her free, much to Henry's anger. *Erin Shephard (Lydia Doesburg) is a runaway 15-year-old who comes to Suffolk County Hospital to receive antibiotics for a scratch she received from a mangy dog during the last full moon. When Josh hears her story, he realizes that she has been attacked by a werewolf. After discussing with Nora, and scaring off Erin's social services worker, who reveals Erin has had many problems, they reveal to Erin that she is a werewolf, including showing footage from the storage unit. The night of the full moon, she and Nora go out to the woods for her first change. Nora believes it will happen to herself first, but Erin suddenly transforms and nearly attacks Josh in his car on the hill. Josh, brandishing a revolver with silver bullets, attempts to defend himself until Nora has completely changed and subdues Erin herself, first through physical strength, and then through their wolf bond. She stays with the group for a while, convincing Sally to try to get a new identity, until she runs away when Josh catches her with Nora's brother R.J. who is several years her senior. Josh and Nora try their best to find her, but Liam eventually delivers her back to their doorstep. However, it is all a plan Liam has put forward to get Erin to help him kill Aidan. He gives her a cellphone to communicate back to him, as she searches though the house for Aidan's blood supply. She taints it with her own blood, but the situation escalates when Aidan comes home just as she finishes her job. He drinks the blood, and realizes too late that it had werewolf blood in it. As he lies on the floor, bleeding from his orifices, she calls Liam who rushes to the house, all the while keeping her eyes on Aidan while holding a wooden stake. In defense, Aidan kicks her, slamming her into a wall, causing massive head trauma. She fades in and out of consciousness over the next few days, until Liam goes to her bedside, and proclaims she has done her part for the pack and smothers her with a pillow, killing her. *Max (Bobby Campo) is a mortician at the funeral home Trent has been taken to. At first annoyed by Sally's constant presence where she should not be. However, he acquiesces into getting Trent's fiance√© Candice to talk to her. He later reveals that he is, in fact, jealous of how Sally managed to make the woman happy in such a sad time, and the two seem to hit it off. They meet again when Sally is looking through his files for a recently deceased child. She levels with him and reveals that she will need to, in the future, find a new identity and money to leave Boston. Max, instead, hires her as an assistant at the funeral home. The two quickly become intimate, but Max's mother Linda possesses Sally to break them up. Sally later makes Linda see the error of her ways, and she and Max become a couple once more. However, when Robbie appears in Boston, the way Sally acts with him around and not telling Max everything drives another wedge between them, almost ending the relationship after Sally leaves in the middle of the night to deal with Donna. However, Sally brings things back together by promising Max that there will no longer be any issue, as she has solved all problems with her former life. When Sally begins to rot, she tries to steal embalmer's wax from the mortuary, only for Max to find her. She reveals the truth about her status to him, and he is at first appalled, but later decides that he truly loves her and will help her hide her decomposition. However, when Aidan and Josh return from their confrontation with Liam, Sally's refusal to reveal anything to Max is the final straw and he ends their relationship. Sally and Max later reconcile for a brief moment and Sally tells him everything, including that she is dying. They say one last goodbye and kiss, departing on good terms, relieving Sally of any unfinished business she may have on Earth for a second time. *Robert (Richard Zeman), Lynette (Paula Jean Hixson), and R.J. Sargeant (Justin Bradley) are the father, mother, and younger brother, respectively, of Nora. Nora has been wary of introducing Josh to her family, apparently because her father is not fond of Jews, but she allows him (and Erin), where they discover the other reasons Nora has been reluctant. but Josh and Erin soon realize that they have their own problems. Lynette's sympathy for Will forces Nora to reveal to him that none of them really know the abuse she suffered, but they all have their ideas. Josh asks Robert permission to marry Nora, and he dismissively allows it, although giving him an apparent warning referring to his own wife. R.J. later appears at the brownstone, drunk, ready to celebrate Josh and Nora's engagement, but Nora does not believe him. While she goes out to get coffee to sober R.J. up, Erin sees that he has come over. The two who had hit it off at the birthday dinner, and R.J., unaware of Erin's real age, flirts with her. Josh comes home to see the two of them making out, and furious that R.J. is getting intimate with Erin who is only 15, attempts to kick R.J. out, and the two have a fistfight, only broken up with Nora's return. Before R.J. leaves, he makes a reference to Will, angering Nora even more. *Nurse Kerwin (Nadia Verrucci) is Aidan's superior at Suffolk County Hospital during the night shift. She introduces him to Kenny, and later in a nightmare Aidan is confronted about her about the blood he has been taking, and he kills her in the nightmare, only to awake to see it was a dream. *Kenny (Connor Price) is a patient at Suffolk County Hospital suffering from severe combined immunodeficiency (\\"bubble boy disease\\"), and as such has never been exposed to the atmosphere. Aidan starts to take care of him, and on the sly takes samples blood so he can be safe and clean. Kenny, a fan of horror movies, soon begins to suspect something is off, but as Aidan does not respond to the stereotypical vampire maladies, Aidan dismisses his questions, but soon realizes he may suspect otherwise. Feeling that he may be going crazy for having suspected Aidan of being a vampire, Aidan assuages Kenny's feelings of guilt by watching TV with him. However, after waking from a nightmare where he killed Nurse Kerwin, Aidan's vampiric features are brought forward, exposing Kenny to the truth. Over the next several days, Kenny presses Aidan for the truth, and Aidan finally gives in, particularly after Kenny offers his virus-free blood. However, days later, Kenny asks for Aidan to turn him. He denies the boy's request, saying it will change him forever, but Kenny can no longer emotionally live in isolation any more, and proclaims that after he turns 18 he will leave, even if his weakened immune system kills him. To that end he allows Blake to drink from him, under the pretense that she will turn him on his 18th birthday. However, she takes too much blood and severely weakens him to the point that Aidan steps in and promises he will be the one to turn him. He turns back to Blake after Aidan reveals he does not have much time left, but after Aidan's recovery he is glad to see Aidan will turn him once more. When Kenny is up for a bone marrow transplant, he gets worried of the failure rate and decides to advance his plans with Aidan, demanding that he be turned or he leaves the hospital on his own and dies from his weakened immune system. Aidan acquiesces and takes Kenny on a last day out as a teenager, including being taken along on Josh's bachelor party. However, Kenny's behavior, including glorifying his soon-to-be vampirism, causes Aidan and Josh to worry. When Kenny watches Aidan kill a vampire stripper planning to eat Josh, Kenny realizes the immortality is not absolute, but Aidan promises him that he will use all of his experiences in his past failures to make sure that Kenny has the best life possible. After turning Kenny and allowing him to sleep, Aidan discovers that he had accidentally turned another human recently, and he has been drastically deformed as either a result of the virus or the werewolf blood, and soon worries that Kenny will have the same fate. After chaining him up so everyone will be safe following his revival, Aidan goes to help Sally, and after Josh and Nora's wedding is unaware that Kenny has also been deformed after his turning. Kenny nearly kills Nora in his first blood lust, and Josh has Aidan kill him, but Aidan takes pity on him and lets him live. Kenny returns months later, apparently normal, and heading up Boston in the power vacuum after the virus. However, he is still severely deformed, but has the ability to compel other vampires to see him as normal. Although he tries to impress Aidan, trying to kill Josh, he ultimately needs his help in stopping the vampire slayer who has been attacking his blood dens, unaware that it is Aidan's wife Suzanna. Kenny later falls in love with Astrid, one of the new werewolves, and is saved by Aidan when Suzanna tries to get him to kill Kenny, only for Aidan to kill Suzanna instead. Kenny plans on leaving Boston with Astrid, but she is killed when the werewolves try to abduct Josh once more, and Ramona gets Josh to kill them all. Aidan lies to Kenny that Astrid was killed by the others, but her ghost appears to Kenny to reveal the truth. Kenny fumes with rage, wanting revenge, and is later let into the house by Ramona when he comes to kill Aidan and Josh. However, Aidan bests him in a fight, but not before Kenny compels him to believe that Josh has caused Sally to disappear forever, just before he disintegrates. *Kat Neely (Deanna Russo) is Nora's friend who is subletting her apartment while Nora has moved in with Josh. She comes to drop off a rent check with Aidan alone in the house, and his lack of blood and Beth and Holly's taunting cause him to come off as odd. Kat later goes back to the house while Erin is in the hospital, and Aidan helps her fix her plumbing, while also revealing her interest in early American history, to which Aidan is well acquainted. The two hit it off, and later he asks her out on a date, and she agrees. Aidan tries to break it off with her, for fear of retaliation from Nora, but he continues to see her until he is attacked by Liam. Kat tries to find out what has happened, prompting Josh's rescue, and after Aidan is infected, Nora invites her over so they can see each other one last time. After Aidan is cured, he approaches her at the university and passionately kisses her, while remembering his wife's words to him centuries before that he should seek out new love when he finds it. After a disastrous date at the Boston Rare Book Archives where Kat comes across her ex-boyfriend Jeff Westin (Malcolm Travis) and his new date Marissa (Meghan Gabruch), a college student who seems to be in the same situation Kat was in years ago, they reveal their plans for the future, in which Kat wants to have a family of her own, even though Aidan cannot provide this for her. They start to get intimate, only for Aidan to back away when the bloodlust overcomes him. Outside, after drinking from a blood bag he has with him, goes back to Kat and they sleep together. However, Aidan awakes in an alley hours later, unknowingly having killed and turned Jeff Westin. Kat is invited for Josh and Nora's wedding, where she is upset that Aidan left her alone after their first night together, but Aidan later apologizes by saying it had been a long time since he had last been intimate with someone and got scared, but promised that it would not happen again and they end up on good terms, with Aidan later admitting that Kat is his girlfriend. Kat later participates in the wedding, being one of Nora's bridesmaids alongside Emily and a spectral Sally. *Linda (Linda E. Smith) is Max's dead mother, who has been keeping watch over him ever since she died. Sally sees her and tries to prove she is not a bad person, but after Sally and Max have sex, Linda is disgusted with her and possesses her to break the two of them up. Sally realizes this when Linda taunts her the following day, and prepares to exorcise her from the funeral home (with the help of Zoe's Soul Lock pendant), but Linda laments that all she wants is her son's happiness. Sally convinces her that she can provide this happiness, and the two begin their relationship anew, now with Linda's blessing. *Robbie Malik (Jesse Rath) is Sally's younger brother. The two had a falling out before her death and did not see each other at all. He becomes the gang's new landlord after it is revealed their father inherited the house after Danny's death and he gave the landlord job to Robbie. Sally reveals that Robbie was a trouble child, as the last time she saw him was when he was being arrested for selling hits of nitrous oxide at her prom. Sally tries her best to avoid contact with him, fearing it will kill him, but the inevitable happens when they bump into each other late at night. After giving up her soul to Donna, Sally returns to apologize to Robbie, and discovers that the landlord claim was all a means to scam Aidan and Josh out of the rent check, as their father has not wanted anything to do with the house. Robbie calls her out on her apparent hypocrisy after she claims he did not go to their mother's funeral, but she reveals that everything regarding her supposed (although actual) death was a means to escape Danny. The two reconcile, and Robbie heads off to Florida for more quick money. He returns months later to try to scam the house out from under them, as his father no longer wants to be involved. Sally tries to thwart his plans, causing an incredible stench to scare away the first potential buyers, but she is sent back in time to watch how Robbie confront Danny before her death, revealing Robbie was worried for Sally's well-being during the time, but she only believed it was him causing trouble. After another potential family is scared away when their son is scratched by the \\"Lil' Smokie\\" spirit, Robbie tries to fix the plumbing, only for it to apparently fight back. His hand is almost mangled by the garbage disposal, and he is killed when the water boiler springs a leak that makes its way to his feet and a jigsaw he was using falls off of a table into the puddle, electrocuting him. Sally comes back from her trip in time to find him dead, and tries to find a way to bring him back to life, only for Robbie to decide that he should remain dead after all of the problems he caused while alive. Jesse Rath is Meaghan Rath's younger brother in real life. *Blake (Janine Theriault) is a recently turned vampire who finds Kenny, planning on using him to stave off the hunger while also planning on turning him once he turns 18. Aidan gets in the way of their plans, first by having her kicked out of the hospital, and then by promising to turn Kenny himself. She later crosses paths with Liam, revealing that the one who killed his son is in Boston. When Aidan is suffering from the virus, Blake makes herself known once more as Kenny plans on using her to turn. However, after Aidan revives, and informs Blake of the werewolf-blood borne cure, she leads a group of vampires in a trap for a werewolf where they all feed on his blood to stave off the virus. *Pete (Ron Lea) is a self-professed vegetarian werewolf that Nora meets after the full moon. After learning from him that the pack mentality is wrong and that wolves should only run with those they are bound by blood with or love, she offers an invitation to their house, which he takes for that very night. After making garlic tea for Aidan, and revealing he has also kept vampire friends and that he is only 39 years old (prematurely aged after years of transformations), he leads Josh and Nora in a meditation to reach their wolves, of which he has named his own \\"Gordon\\". Pete does his best to get Josh in touch with his wolf, offering to help them get through it in a single night in exchange for beer, but when Josh returns to Pete's RV, he finds him attacked by vampires seeking the blood cure, who also reveal that Josh and Nora are off limits. Pete is revealed to have died from the attack, and his death is taken hard by Nora, Josh, and even Aidan, who feels responsible for not including him in the protective deal, even though he only said a single drink was necessary. *Suzanna (Katharine Isabelle) is Aidan's wife from colonial times, taking care of their young son Isaac (Kyle Harrison Breitkopf) after it is assumed that Aidan has died in battle. Aidan returns to the homestead after being turned, weak and hungry, attacking one of their chickens, and Suzanna tends to him, feeding him, and falling in love with him, again. She says he is not a monster, as the hawk needs to kill just as he does, and she later pleads with him that after she is dead that if he should find love once more he should pursue it. Earlier in their marriage, the two were desperate to have a child, as the baby was never strong enough after birth. Although Suzanna pleads with Aidan to attend church, where their judgemental preacher uses their plight as a means to gather faith, Aidan refuses to go to church any longer, and lashes out at the preacher when he comes to visit them at their home. After Aidan prays and promises God that he will always be a good man from then on, Suzanna successfully gives birth to their son, Isaac. Suzanna is ultimately drowned for believed for being a witch, as Aidan returns to the village, and though Aidan takes revenge on the clergy for killing her, it is revealed Bishop brought her back to life as a vampire. In a blood lust, she accidentally kills Isaac, for which she punishes herself daily, and decides to use her eternal life to kill other vampires. After Aidan accidentally kills a girl, she forces him into an ultimatum to repent, and reveals the truth that she killed their son. However, she tasks Aidan to kill the new head of Boston. After Aidan reveals that it is his son Kenny, Suzanna allegedly gives him leeway to keep Kenny under control, but she takes matters into her own hands and attempts to force Aidan to kill Kenny himself, but in the last moment he stakes her. =Season 4= *\\"Lil' Smokie\\" (Helen Colliander) is a young girl Sally watches get sacrificed to witches during one of her trips back in time. A later trip back in time leads her to her nickname as Sally discovers the young girl serving up cocktail weiners (little smokies) at a party in the 1970s some time before her death. With Zoe's help, Sally discovers the girl is Beatrice Benson, and they track her down only to discover Beatrice is alive and well (Mary Katherine Harvey) and her daughter is the spitting image of her as a child. Zoe believes they have met a dead end, but Sally spots the daughter staring at them from a second-story window, and later Beatrice examines a photo of her old house, the gang's greystone, to see a girl who could be her double doing the same. The spirit of \\"Lil' Smokie\\" seems to be malicious in the house, causing Robbie Malik's death and harming a young child. After Sally wakes up in the hidden room, and they break it open, an argument between Sally, Josh, and Aidan is interrupted by the spirit, revealing herself to be Ramona Benson, Beatrice's twin sister, who has been trapped in the house ever since. She wants to see her sister, again, and Sally asks Aidan to attempt to talk to Beatrice for him, but she is horrified when he reveals that he knows about Ramona. At the house, Ramona wants the \\"family\\" to stay, and when the pack tries to take Josh back, she traps him in the bedroom until he changes, allowing him to kill the whole pack to save Nora. When Aidan takes Astrid's corpse away from the house, having hidden it from Kenny, he does not realize that a dried bloodstain he spotted earlier with several new scratch marks in it has increased to having 12 scratch marks, noting the people who have since died in the house due to Josh's rampage. Beatrice later returns to the house to warn the group that her parents had joined a cult to Paimon, one of the Kings of Hell, and her sister, who her parents never even named, was sacrificed by the cult. Ramona appears, and kills Beatrice, believing she is responsible for her death, and then traps the four housemates in situations that would possibly result in their own deaths, as she no longer plans on letting anyone leave the house alive. When Sally confronts her, she finally reveals that she is not a ghost but the evil of the house given a corporeal form. Once all of the others are freed before any one of them can kill themselves, she lets Kenny into the house, knowing that it will ultimately lead to one of their deaths. *Caroline (Myl√®ne Dinh-Robic) is a pregnant werewolf that Josh discovers on one of his jogs. She reveals herself, her husband Andrew (Tim Rozon), and several of their friends were all attacked by a werewolf on the same night three months prior, and after they came back, they finally conceived a child despite years of no success. However, she appears to be farther along with the pregnancy than she should be. An ultrasound discovers that the baby seems to be a werewolf in the womb, showing how it could have survived the three transformations. That same day, her water breaks, and with Josh and Nora's help, Caroline ultimately gives birth to a daughter they name April (Jaxen Dupuis and Jayden Dupuis), and the begin to form a pack with the other werewolves that were changed with them, revealed to Josh and Nora at the baby shower the two throw them. They later move out into the countryside to stay away from the city for April's safety, but it is all a ruse to use Josh to father a whole new pack of werewolves. Andrew is killed by Josh when he helps the pack take him back, and Ramona keeps Josh until he transforms. *Mark (James A. Woods) is the erstwhile leader of the pack of werewolves Caroline and Andrew join up with after their child's birth. Mark seems intent on forming a pack to protect themselves from the vampires, despite the truce between them, and is explicitly disdainful of their presence. Josh is wary of Mark, feeling that he is trying to be the alpha wolf, and after a confrontation with Aidan and Kenny, Mark leads the pack away from Josh and Nora. The two try their best to reintegrate with the new pack, doing their best to teach them their ways, but when Josh's wolf and the wolf of Mark's wife Wendy (Stephanie Lemelin) mate during the full moon, Josh tries to distance himself and Nora from them, aware of Mark's possessive nature, and how he might react to the affair, even if they were wolves. Wendy ultimately reveals the truth to Mark, and Mark attacks Josh, revealing the truth to Nora, but when he strikes Nora, Josh's wolf surfaces and he nearly kills Mark. Later, Josh attempts to reconcile with Mark and Andrew by revealing he now can change at will, and Mark decides to use this to his own advantage by having Josh sire a new pack of wolves as he is in control now. Josh refuses, and Mark stuns him and traps him in a cage, later fighting Aidan when he, Nora, and Sally try to save Josh. Mark is killed by Josh after being trapped by Ramona. *Astrid (Kalinka Petrie) is a young werewolf who takes a liking to Kenny, even though they are both aware of each other's natures. Aidan uses her presence in Kenny's life as a way to try to convince him his new way of running Boston is wrong, and later she is instrumental in revealing to Aidan, Sally, and Nora, that Mark, Andrew, and Caroline have Josh captive. Astrid is killed when Josh attacks the pack, and as a ghost, she reveals the truth about her death to Kenny, who has been led to believe by Aidan that the pack killed her first. *\\"Brick Shithouse\\" (Kwasi Songui) is one of the werewolves, having an imposing figure due to his height and weight. When a fight breaks out during the baby shower between the werewolves and Aidan and Kenny, his arm is broken in the melee, but he heals later and joins the others in the first change as a pack. At the housewarming party, Brick is one of the werewolves Aidan and Sally fight off, with Sally possessing him after the others have fallen to use his body to express her feelings for Aidan (after her trip back in time) in a passionate kiss. He is among the werewolves killed by Josh when they try to kidnap him, again.

It was designed by Heriberto Pronello for the official Ford Sports-Prototype team. The Huayra was powered by a five-liter Ford V8 producing 430 hp, with four Weber 48/48 IDF carburetors. Driven by Carlos Pascualini and future competitive Formula One driver Carlos Reutemann, it was the fastest car in both qualifying and race in nearly all of Argentina's Turismo Carretera races in 1969. __TOC__  History  = Context = The Huayra running with the bodywork extension for high speed circuits. Carlos Reutemann moments before a race, sitting on a Huayra The Argentine Turismo Carretera racing series had been dominated by Ford and Chevrolet until the end of the 1960s. In 1967, IKA introduced the Torino and set up a team to promote it. The IKA team drivers were Eduardo Copello, H√©ctor Gradassi and Jorge Ternengo. But in the team there were also two outstanding figures, chief mechanic Oreste Berta, and designer Heriberto Pronello. Their modified Torinos, the Liebre I (Hare I) and Liebre II, dominated the 1967 season. In 1968, IKA officially withdrew from TC, but Pronello presented two new models, the Liebre 1 1/2 and later the Liebre III. However, the championship went to Carlos Pairetti in his Trueno Naranja Chevrolet, designed by Pedro Campo. Still, Pronello's cars were chosen by many pilots, and the series became a showcase of advanced design and technology. Moreover, due to the dangers involved in street racing, the series began to move to the tracks, and by 1969, a new, race-track only, series with its own regulations was established -the Sports-prototype.  The Huayra  = Origin of the name = Wayra (pronounced wa…™-rah) is the word for \\"wind\\" in the South American language of Quechua. The name was suggested to Pronello by a visual artist friend of his upon seeing the car being tested in the wind tunnel.  Origin  In 1969, Heriberto Pronello signed with Ford Motor Argentina to build six cars for the make's official Sports-prototype and Turismo Carretera teams. He built two Huayra SPs, and four Halc√≥n TCs (two of the latter would be sold to private drivers). Pronello had been designing the Huayra since 1966, but had not had a chance to develop his project. Ford would now provide the F100 V8 engines, but Pronello would have to finance the project, until one condition was met: the car had to be among the four fastests in one of the first four races of the championship. This was achieved without much difficulty. Interior of the Huayra SP Meanwhile, the team took shape. Carlos Reutemann and Carlos Pascualini drove the SPs, while Jorge Ternengo and Reutemann or Pascualini drove the Halc√≥n TCs. The Halc√≥n, though very similar to the Huayra, was 19 cm longer, thinner tyres, a different chassis, and other different characteristics. In the beginning, Pronello himself tested the car on the street and on the Oscar Cabal√©n racetrack in C√≥rdoba. On April 22, the car was being tested by Pascualini in Buenos Aires when it caught fire and was almost completely destroyed. Despite this, Ford continued to support Pronello.  On the track  = Huayra's first steps = The Huayra debuted on May 18, in C√≥rdoba. Both Huayras qualified second, but had to abandon due to mechanical problems. The only absolute win would be on the following race, on June 22, in the Rafaela oval track. During qualifying, Reutemann averaged 231,223 km/h, with Pascualini a mere 7 tenths behind. During the race, both cars had a lap record of 1' 13\\" 8/10, at 225,583 km/h. Pascualini also set the year's race average for the series, an impressive 216,078 km/h. Pascualini recalls how \\"we took the curves at almost 300 km/h. It was the fastest race car I've ever driven. But the Huayra had an amazing grip, it was well- balanced, and the brakes and steering were faultless. That was without a doubt the most important victory of my career.\\" Pascualini and Pronello both recall that in those days they used to give each engine a name. Thus, there was \\"The Kerusha,\\" \\"Lolita,\\" and \\"Black Party.\\" The Huayras were almost always the fastest cars, but it was mostly due to engine failures that they often had to abandon. In 1970, the Huayras continued to race in SP, but as spiders, since the new regulations allowed for open cars. Though the engines were more reliable, they were not as superior as the previous year's and lost protagonism. In 1971, the Huayras raced less and less as manufacturers lost interest in the series. The Huayra today  = Restoration = In 1996, Ricardo Zeziola began restoring one of the Halc√≥n-Fords. The reconstructed car was shown in various exhibitions, and was awarded the Best Restoration prize in Autoclasica 1999. Due to this restoration's repercussion, more information about the other cars began to appear. The Huayra SP's mechanics In 2005, Mr Zeziola found the surviving Huayra in C√≥rdoba, and began working on his second Pronello-Ford. Again, Pronello himself supervised and collaborated with Zeziola in the restoration of the Huayra.

LIFT procedure is based on secure closure of the internal opening and removal of infected cryptoglandular tissue through the intersphincteric approach. Essential steps of the procedure include, incision at the intersphincteric groove, identification of the intersphincteric tract, ligation of intersphincteric tract close to the internal opening and removal of intersphincteric tract, scraping out all granulation tissue in the rest of the fistulous tract, and suturing of the defect at the external sphincter muscle.Rojanasakul A. LIFT procedure: a simplified technique for fistula-in-ano. Tech Coloproctol. 2009 Sep;13(3):237‚Äì40. Epub 2009 Jul 28 The procedure was developed by Thai colorectal surgeon, Arun Rojanasakul, Colorectal Division Department of Surgery, Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, Thailand. The first report of preliminary healing result from the procedure were 94% in 2007 [Rojanasakul A, Pattanaarun J, Sahakitrungruang C, Tantiphlachiva K. Total anal sphincter saving technique for fistula-in-ano; the ligation of intersphincteric fistula tract. J Med Assoc Thai. 2007 Mar;90(3):581‚Äì6.] In 1993 Matos et al. described a technique of total anal sphincter preservation in high fistula in ano, which is based on the concept of excision of intersphincteric anal gland infection through the intersphincteric approach.[Matos D, Lunniss PJ, Phillips RKS (1993) Total sphincter conservation in high fistula in ano: results of a new approach. Br J Surg 80:802‚Äì804] This novel technique was also documented in Corman‚Äôs textbook of colon and rectal surgery.Corman M L (2004) Anal Fistula. In: Colon and Rectal Surgery. 5th edn. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, pp 316 However, the technique was not widely adopted.[Lunnis PJ (2009) Invited comment: LIFT procedure: a simplified technique for fistula in ano. Tech Coloproctol 13:241‚Äì242] Between 2004 and 2005 there was a personal experience in the similar technique by group of surgeons. That technique included coring out the intersphinteric fistula tract from the external opening to the external sphincter, excision of the intersphincteric fistula tract and suture of the internal sphincter defect through the intersphincteric plane. The outcome in 20 patients was disappointing with only 9 (45%) successes. Surgeons proposed that the reasons for the unfavorable outcome include dissection in the intersphincteric plane damaging blood supply to the internal opening area, and suturing delicate ischemic areas with increased risk of suture break-down. Surgeons thought that ligation of the intersphincteric tract close to the internal opening might solve the problem. Surgeons noticed that during intersphincteric plane dissection if the internal sphincter was damaged and the anal mucosa breached, failure was common despite meticulous repair. Researchers of the procedure agree that the LIFT technique may cause some injury to internal sphincter, but theoretically LIFT causes less trauma of the internal sphincter than the other fistula operations. Matos et al. reported the technique of excision of the whole fistula tract plus primary repair, with intersphincteric plane approach for excision of the fistula tract and suturing of the internal anal sphincter defect, in 1993. However, Rojanasakul reported the ligation of intersphincteric fistula tract in 2007 with apparent satisfactory results probably due to secured closure of the internal opening. This represents a significant change from the originally described technique with improved outcomes .Rojanasakul A.

He averaged 32.9 points per game in 29 games played and set still-standing school records for points in a single game (53) and season (953). Houston was raised in Pearl River, New York and was a three-year starter on the varsity basketball team at Pearl River High School. He was a diminutive , 165 lbs. in his prime during college, so as a high school player was even smaller. His small stature played a big role in why he was overlooked by college scouts. Houston decided to attend the U.S. Military Academy Preparatory School in New Jersey for one year after high school. The United States Military Academy (Army), located in his home state of New York, was the only university that had shown Houston any interest during his basketball recruitment. He enrolled at Army in the fall of 1983 to play for the Black Knights. During his four-year career, Houston started every single one of the 113 games he played in, which ties him for the most all-time games played in Army history. By the time he graduated from the Academy in 1987, he had re- written the school's record book. Houston scored still-standing program records for points in a game (53), season (953), career (2,325), and season points per game (32.9) among others. He was the first ever Army player to be named the Haggerty Award winner, an honor that he shared as a senior with St. John's Mark Jackson, which is given to the best men's basketball player in the greater New York City metropolitan area. Houston was also the 1986‚Äì87 Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference Player of the Year and the NCAA season scoring champion. He was a three-time All-MAAC honoree, two-time honorable mention All-American and one-time third team All-American. After college, Houston served his mandatory stint in the United States Army for several years. He got into high school coaching and guided the Storm King School, located in Cornwall-on-Hudson, New York, to two New England Private School Championships in just seven years. One of his players was future NBA Draft pick Sammy Mejia. Kevin was married to his high school sweetheart, Elizabeth Cuccia, for 21 years before she died on January 3, 2009.

A large cross in the cemetery marks the location of this original church. The present church was built in 1437 and is a good example of northern late medieval church architecture. It has a simple rectangular floor plan and consists of nave, porch to the south and the vestry in the north. The church is constructed of stone with a roof covered with thick wood paneling. Entrance is through the porch. The church still has its medieval appearance. The church has paintings on the ceiling that were previously painted over with white paint. The original paintings were revealed in a restoration in 1952. The bell tower was built in 1759 by Per Zakrisson (1723‚Äì1780) of Anundsj√∂. Zakrisson was a craftsman, carpenter, wood carver, blacksmith, and mechanic. He was most noted as a church builder.

The expedition was launched in May 1768, in the aftermath of the Seven Years' War. A French expeditionary force was landed on the island of Corsica, then ruled by the Corsican Republic. Marching inland to overcome any Corsican opposition, the French force initially suffered an unexpected defeat at the Battle of Borgo. But a new commander, the Comte de Vaux, was appointed to lead the expedition, and decisively defeated the Corsican army at the Battle of Ponte Novu in 1769, effectively bringing an end to Corsican resistance. The Corsican forces, having neither the willpower nor the manpower to resist the French, surrendered the island. After the Corsican defeat, France annexed the island, although they took a year consolidating the territory as many Corsicans took to the hills and engaged in guerilla warfare against the French. Pasquale Paoli fled to Great Britain, where he was immensely popular, and became a member of Samuel Johnson's dining club. Corsica remained under French rule until 1794, when an Anglo-Corsican expedition captured Corsica from the French and the Anglo-Corsican Kingdom was established, with Paoli as its ruler. On 19 October 1796, the French reconquered Corsica and it became a French d√©partement. Background The island of Corsica had been ruled by the Republic of Genoa since 1284. In the 18th century, Corsicans started to develop their own nationalism and seek their independence from Genoese rule. In 1729, the Corsican Revolution for independence from Genoa began, first led by Luiggi Giafferi and Giacinto Paoli, and later by Paoli's son, Pasquale Paoli. After 26 years of struggle against the Republic of Genoa (plus an ephemeral attempt to proclaim in 1736 an independent Kingdom of Corsica under the German adventurer Theodor von Neuhoff, who was supported by the Dutch Republic and the Kingdom of Great Britain, which at the time ruled over Menorca and Gibraltar in the Mediterranean Sea), the independent Corsican Republic was proclaimed in 1755 under the leadership of Pasquale Paoli and remained sovereign until 1769. The first Corsican Constitution was written in Italian (the language of culture in Corsica until the middle of the 19th century) by Paoli, which was heavily influenced by the British one. Despite four decades of intense fighting, the Corsican Republic proved unable to eject the Genoese from the major coastal fortresses of Calvi and Bonifacio. After the Corsican conquest of Capraia, a small island of the Tuscan Archipelago, in 1767, the Republic of Genoa, exhausted by forty years of fighting, decided to sell the island to France which, after its defeat in the Seven Years' War, was trying to reinforce its position in the Mediterranean. In 1768, with the Treaty of Versailles, the Genoese republic ceded all its rights on the island. The very same year, King Louis XV sent a military expedition to Corsica to secure French rule over the island, under the command of Comte de Vaux, a veteran of the Seven Years' War. Conquest France's first offensive failed after the initial and rather small French expeditionary force suffered a significant setback at the Battle of Borgo in October 1768. France therefore dispatched large numbers of reinforcements, swelling the size of their army on the island to 24,000 men, and tasked a new commander with the renewal of the endeavor. The Corsican army was decisively defeated at the Battle of Ponte Novu and the French forces soon overran the island although Corsican forces were not completely subdued until the following year and sporadic outbreaks of rebellion continued. Consequences The French invasion triggered the Corsican Crisis in British politics. Although they sent secret aid to the Corsicans, the British government chose not to act to prevent the island's occupation. Paoli had created a liberal Corsican Constitution heavily influenced by that of Britain. He created the most extensive voting franchise in the world, and attempted radical reforms in education. Because of Britain's enmity of France, and because the British had historically been supportive of Corsican exiles ‚Äî Paoli sought to establish an alliance with Great Britain. Britain opened a consulate on the island, but events in Corsica did not feature prominently in Britain until 1768.. The leader of the Corsican Republic, Pasquale Paoli, went into exile in Britain where he remained until the French Revolution allowed him to return to Corsica. British troops subsequently intervened in Corsica between 1794‚Äì1796, where they created the Anglo-Corsican Kingdom, and in 1814 when they agreed the Treaty of Bastia. Following the Congress of Vienna control of the islands were returned to the restored French monarchs. The invasion and occupation had even more profound consequences for France itself. When Napoleon Bonaparte was born on Corsica in 1769, he automatically became a natural-born French citizen. Both his parents Carlo Maria Buonaparte and Maria Letizia Ramolino joined the local resistance and fought against the French to maintain independence, even when Maria was pregnant with him. Although raised as a Corsican nationalist, Napoleon gradually turned his loyalties towards the whole of France, serving in the French Army. He went on to become ruler of mainland France, adopted the ideals of the French Revolution as his own, and triggered the Napoleonic Wars that devastated much of Europe and changed it permanently. Legacy To this day, some Corsican nationalists advocate the restoration of the island's republic. There are several groups and two nationalist parties (the autonomist Femu a Corsica and the separatist Corsica Libera) active on the island calling for some degree of Corsican autonomy from France or even full independence. Some groups that claim to support Corsican independence, such as the National Liberation Front of Corsica, have carried out a violent campaign since the 1970s that includes bombings and assassinations, usually targeting buildings and officials representing the French government.

This crime-drama is based and named after a novel by Iceberg Slim written in 1967. The film was produced by Marshal Backlar and James Levitt. The film first premiered at the DeMille Theater, Seventh Avenue and 47th Street theatre, Juliet 2 Theater, and Third Avenue and 83 Street theatre in New York. This film is distributed by Universal Studios. Plot \\"Blue\\" Howard (Mel Stewart) and \\"White Folks\\" (Kiel Martin) are two con men in Philadelphia. Blue is an older black hustler who raised \\"White Folks and taught him \\"the con\\". White Folks is the son of a black mother who is a prostitute and a white father. White Folks has a complexion light enough for him to pass as a white man which gives him an advantage in the con. The duo exploit the dynamics between whites and blacks to achieve their cons. Blue usually plays a vulnerable black man being exploited by White Folks which allows Folks to gain the credibility needed to pull off the con. Cast *Kiel Martin as \\"White Folks\\" *Mel Stewart as \\"Blue\\" Howard *Vernee Watson- Johnson as Cleo Howard *Beverly Ballard as Susan *Clebert Ford as Josephus *David Thomas as Frascatti *Jim King as Duke *Ted Lange as Melvin the Pimp *Jan Leighton as Carlson *Dallas Edwards Hayes as Dot Murray *Tony Mazzadra as Nino Parelli *Don Symington as Morrison *Don Fellows as Phillips *Tom Anderson as Felix the Fixer *Charles Weldon as Tough  Themes  = Race = The racial dynamics in Trick Baby drive the plot of the movie. Due to Folks' ability to pass as white, each plan is executed and ultimately is successful. When they are running a con, Blue plays the poor Negro man who is easily exploited by white men while Folks play a white man preying on the unassuming Negro. For this reason, Blue states that \\"his white skin gives us a slick edge\\". He is trusted by the white men they are trying to con because he looks like one of them, all the while, identifying as black. While his look allows him to gain access to white spaces, it causes him to be ostracized within the black community. It is during interactions with Black people that he is derogatorily referred to as a \\"trick baby\\". His light skin and white blood does not allow him to be recognized as Black by other Black people. This movie flips the normal formulation of Blaxploitation films and utilizes Folks' seeming whiteness subversively in order to take from white people. Through the manipulation of whiteness, Blue and Folks take what they want. They use the power that comes with white skin to their benefit. Blaxploitation films, however, usually feature power derived from Black people and Black culture. The mark of the genre thus, are Black characters and aesthetics. This is a reflection of a Black Power consciousness manifesting through film. Black Power leader, Stokely Carmichael, makes it clear that whiteness does not have a place in the movement. In \\"What We Want\\" Carmichael indicts the Civil Rights Movement \\"whose tone of voice was adapted to an audience of liberal whites,\\" and ignored angry communities of black people. He critiques the Civil Rights Movement for a continued allegiance to white standards and institutions. Black Power instead centers Blackness and therefore the films derived from this consciousness are divorced from whiteness and white characters as well. The move to an authentic Black politics through the Black Power Movement manifests itself in film. In his book Toms, Coons, Mulattoes, Mammies, and Bucks: An Interpretive History of Blacks in American Films, Donald Bogle states that the Black Power Movement shaped the aesthetic of the films the 70's. The character that becomes popular in films is black and appeals to black audiences because he takes the system on head-first. He is in control of all aspects of his life, sexually, politically, and economically. He is power, and he has no time for whiteness. His aesthetic and the aesthetic of the films \\"played on a certain social/political philosophy prevalent in some sectors of the black community in the late 1960s and early 1970s\\" during which time there was a rejection of anyone who \\"aided and abetted White America through attempts at cultural assimilation.\\". The consciousness of the movement and the art forms influenced by it pushed whiteness to the periphery. However, this film uses Folks' white skin against white people. = Black Women in Blaxploitation = Women are largely absent in this film. The two women present in this film have minor roles which hinge upon their relationship with the men in the film. This reflects the absence of women and supporting roles to which they were relegated within the Black Power Movement. Blue's wife, Cleo Howard, is a peripheral character. The focus of the film is Blue's relationship to Folk's and the con. Early on, it is made clear that Cleo is a non-essential factor to the con and as a result, she is largely unimportant to Blue. Her relationship with Blue does not at all compare to the partnership Folks and Blue have. Blue states that \\"[Folks] was living here long before you came. But that don't matter, you're still the star boarder\\". Referring to her as a boarder was supposedly a joke, however the way in which he treats her in the movie proves that this is her true position. She is merely a boarder, she has no claims or ownership to the property or the money and thus she has no say in its distribution and allocation. Thus, she is to be silent when those issues are concerned. She is only relevant insofar as she provides the only service that Blue does not require from Folks, sex. Cleo's role reflects the silence, absence, and peripheral roles of women in the Black Power Movement. In her article \\"Framing the Panther: Assata Shakur and Black Female Agency,\\" Joy James states that \\"one can easily imagine antiracist revolutionary struggle against the state without (black) women clearly in the picture, but to imagine revolution against state violence in the absence of (black) men often draws a blank\\".Joy James. \\"Framing the Panther: Assata Shakur and Black Female Agency.\\" Want to Start a Revolution?: Radical Women in the Black Freedom Struggle. New York: New York UP, 2009. N. pag. 138 Print. In the fight against racism, women also had to fight against patriarchy. While many women joined Black Power movements and made many significant contributions, they are largely unheard of, save a few famous women. In \\"Black Women and Black Power,\\" Darlene Hine claims \\"the cult of black manhood worked against them\\".Hine, Darlene Clark., and Kathleen Thompson. A Shining Thread of Hope: The History of Black Women in America. New York: Broadway, 1998. Print. 298. She theorizes that in reaction to the suppression of masculinity during Jim Crow, there was a strong emphasis on masculinity in the Black Power Movement. Additionally, women were confined to traditional notions of femininity. By these notions, it was emphasized that women's roles was to support the movement from the periphery. All the labor needed to run the movement behind the scenes were done by women. They were responsible for \\"implementing the medical, housing, clothing, free breakfast, and education programs\\".Joy James. \\"Framing the Panther: Assata Shakur and Black Female Agency.\\" Want to Start a Revolution?: Radical Women in the Black Freedom Struggle. New York: New York UP, 2009. N. Print. 140. But yet, these contributions do not circulate in the discourse of Black Power. Even popular Black female icons such as Kathleen Cleaver and Angela Davis were recognized in conjunction to their lovers or revolutionary male counterparts. Thus, patriarchal logics were a hindrance to women in the movement. James states \\"men appear independent of women in revolutionary struggles; women generally appear as revolutionaries only in association with men, often as 'helpmates'. As a category, the female revolutionary remains somewhat of an afterthought, an aberration; hence she is an abstraction- vague and not clearly in the picture\\". Thus, Cleo Howard's abstracted role in the film serves as a parallel to women in the Black Power Movement: in the picture insofar of their relationships to great men, but abstracted and forgotten in their own right.  Background and production  Trick Baby is adapted from a book by Iceberg Slim. Slim, born Robert Lee Maupin, was a pimp in his early life before becoming a popular author for African American audiences. His novels reflect his personal experiences and provides an insider look into the world of black pimps. Trick Baby, his second novel published by Holloway House in 1967, was not a direct look into the life of pimps but was still heavily influenced by pimping (remember a trick baby is the product of pimping). Slim became one of the best-selling authors of his time selling over six million books. This is the first one of Slim's novels to be turned into a film. The script was adapted from the book by A. Neuberg, T. Raewyn, and Larry Yust. The film was also directed by Yust. The movie was produced with a $600,000 budget and was produced independently. Universal Pictures bought the film for 1,000,000 dollars and the movie grossed $11,000,000 at the US box office. The cast was not well known before the movie's release. An adaptation of Pimp, his first novel, has been in the works for some time, since the early 1990s, but have never come to fruition. Another one of his novels, Mama Black Widow, is in development with the screenplay being adapted by Marshall Tyler who is also set to direct the piece. Reception Critic Rossi Jackson of the New Pittsburgh Courier calls this adaption a \\"bastardized version of Iceberg Slim's novel‚Ä¶they have watered down, misadapted and ultimately messed up Iceberg Slim's original work\\".Rossi, Jackson. New Pittsburgh Courier (1966-1981), City Edition [Pittsburgh, Pa] 03 Mar 1973: 17 While Jackson claims that the film is well acted, he believes that the film lacks the ferociousness and passion with which Slim writes about the \\"places and the pains of the black ghetto experience\\". The black ghetto life is largely lost in the movie and many of the exciting characters, such as Cleo, are lost. Jackson praises the performance of Dallas Edward Hayes (the corrupt cop) and Mel Stewart (Blue Howard), but states that Kiel Martin's performance falls short. Left to our own imaginations in the book, Folks' black identity is not questioned. However, in the movie, Martin plays the white man well, but lacks the soul needed to play a black man. Jackson states \\"since the credibility of the whole film rests on the actor's performance in the title role, this film falls flat on its face. Even if the leading actor were really black, one would still question his ability as an actor to credibly project black masculinity on the screen\\". In a 1973 review in the New York Times, Roger Greenspun wrote \\"Trick Baby seems most interesting in its understanding of race relations‚Ä¶relations between Folks and Blue are absolutely normal, not very competitive, resilient, and rich in a kind of mutual professional appreciation.\\" See also *List of American films of 1972 References External links *IMDB Entry Category:1972 films Category:American crime drama films Category:American films Category:Blaxploitation films Category:1972 crime drama films Category:Films about organized crime in the United States Category:1972 drama films ","title":"Trick Baby"},{"id":"30528119","text":"Sergei Rudolfovich Shabanov (born February 24, 1974) is a Belarusian professional ice hockey goaltender who participated at the 2010 IIHF World Championship as a member of the Belarus men's national ice hockey team.

Australia-China relations During a meeting in March 2009, Kevin Rudd, Prime Minister of Australia, advised US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to be in a position to use force against China \\"if everything goes wrong\\". =Taiwan and Tibet= During that same meeting, Rudd described to Clinton that China was \\"paranoid\\" about Taiwan and Tibet, characterised Chinese leaders as \\"sub-rational and deeply emotional\\" in their reactions to Taiwan, and stated that the goal of his plan for an \\"Asia-Pacific Community\\" was envisaged to weaken China's authority in the region and curb its dominance in regional diplomatic institutions. Political controversy Australian Senator Don Farrell, a South Australian right-wing factional Labor powerbroker, said he believes that Julia Gillard, Prime Minister of Australia from 2010 to 2013, was gunning for the prime ministership a year before Rudd's personal support in the polls collapsed.

China‚ÄìNorth Korea relations A Chinese official revealed that both public opinion in China and the government are \\"increasingly critical\\" of North Korea, stating that \\"China's influence with the North was frequently overestimated\\". The Chinese mentioned that they do not \\"like\\" North Korea, but \\"they are a neighbor\\". Cyberwarfare The cables state that China is engaging in cyberwarfare to bolster offensive and defensive computer network operations capabilities. Their recruits include Lin Yong, using the alias Lion, who founded the Honker Union of China, a Chinese hacker group that emerged after the U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999 and XFocus, the hacker group that released blaster worm in August 2003. =2010 hacking incident= A Chinese contact told the U.S. Embassy in Beijing that the Politburo of the Communist Party of China was responsible for instigating the January 2010 Google hacking incident which was part of a wider \\"coordinated campaign of computer sabotage carried out by government operatives, private security experts and Internet outlaws recruited by the Chinese government\\" targeting the U.S. and its Western allies. Manas Air Base In February 2009, the U.S. Ambassador to Kyrgyzstan spoke to her Chinese counterpart, Zhang Yannian, after being notified that China had offered Kyrgyzstan $3 billion in return for the closure of Manas Air Base -- an important U.S. base in Bishkek handling flights into and out of Afghanistan. She stated that during the encounter \\"visibly flustered, Zhang temporarily lost the ability to speak Russian and began spluttering in Chinese\\". He responded with his own proposal to the U.S. on dealing with the Kyrgyz to keep the base open, during which his aide remarked: \\"Or maybe you should give them $5 billion and buy both us and the Russians out\\". Foreign policy China's foreign policy has been criticized by a Western diplomat as \\"newly pugnacious\\", despite earlier policies assuring China's rise would be a \\"peaceful\\" one. Jon Huntsman, Jr., U.S. Ambassador to China, has stated that the recent policy shift is \\"losing friends worldwide\\". Huntsman discussed a British diplomat critical of conduct by Chinese officials at the Copenhagen climate change summit, who considered the change in China's approach \\"shocking\\". He mentions that \\"China's more aggressive approach\\" has caused India to strengthen their relationship with the United States. Japanese diplomats confirmed the new \\"aggressive\\" approach, and a Moroccan diplomat commented that \\"China will never play the role of a global leader if it treats its trade partners so poorly\\". However, Huntsman reminds that this does not imply that nations will turn toward the United States in response, and that many countries are equally suspicious of the Americans as they are of the Chinese. He quotes Julius Ole Sunkuli, who \\"claimed that Africa was better off thanks to China's practical, bilateral approach to development assistance and was concerned that this would be changed by 'western' interference‚Ä¶ Sunkuli said Africans were frustrated by western insistence on capacity building, which translated, in his eyes, into conferences and seminars. They instead preferred China's focus on infrastructure and tangible projects.\\" Economic interests in Africa In a 2010 cable, the US Assistant Secretary for African Affairs downplays China as a military, security or intelligence threat, describing it instead as a 'very aggressive economic competitor with no morals'. The cable also highlights how 'the Chinese are dealing with the Mugabe's and Bashir's of the world, which is a contrarian political model'. GDP accuracy The U.S. embassy memo sent on 15 March 2007 stated Li Keqiang, the Vice Premier of China, told China's GDP is not reliable, especially for local GDP, to the U.S. Ambassador Clark T. Randt, Jr. Li said GDP statistics are 'for reference only.' Tibet According to diplomatic cables, the Dalai Lama told Timothy J. Roemer, U.S. Ambassador to India, in 2009 that the international community should focus on climate change rather than politics in Tibet because environmental problems were more urgent. \\"Melting glaciers, deforestation and increasingly polluted water from mining projects were problems that 'cannot wait', but the Tibetans could wait five to 10 years for a political solution\\", he was reported as saying in August 2009.

He later played several seasons in the Canadian Football League. Gilliam is a member of the University of Iowa‚Äôs all-time football team. Background Frank Gilliam attended high school in Steubenville, Ohio, and was football teammates with Calvin Jones and Eddie Vincent. Frank was nicknamed \\"Shag\\" because of the baggy pants he liked to wear. Gilliam and Vincent committed to play for the Iowa Hawkeyes, while Cal Jones committed to play for Ohio State. However, at the last minute, Jones switched his commitment and decided to accompany Gilliam and Vincent to Iowa City. Cal Jones Hall of Fame bio Gilliam, Vincent, and Jones became affectionately known as the \\"Steubenville Trio\\". Iowa career As a sophomore in 1953, Frank Gilliam, who played the right end position, helped Iowa to an excellent season. Iowa‚Äôs final game of that season was against #1 Notre Dame in South Bend. With 2:06 remaining in the game, Gilliam made a diving catch in the end zone to give Iowa a 14-7 lead. The Fainting Irish But Notre Dame completed a touchdown pass with six seconds to play to salvage a 14-14 tie, thanks in large part to an injury timeout that was granted when two Notre Dame players fell at the same time. The Fainting Irish Gridiron Glory The tie cost the Irish the #1 spot in the final AP Poll, dropping them to a distant #2. Iowa rocketed into the AP rankings, finishing the year ninth in the nation and garnering six first place votes. It was Iowa‚Äôs highest ranking since 1939. Iowa in the polls In 1954, Iowa finished with a 5-4 record. Before Gilliam‚Äôs senior season in 1955, he broke his leg and was forced to sit out for a year. Jones and Vincent played their senior seasons in 1955, with Cal Jones winning the Outland Trophy. In Gilliam‚Äôs senior season of 1956, Iowa had a 9-1 record, winning the Big Ten and a trip to the Rose Bowl for the first time in school history. Iowa‚Äôs 1956 record Frank Gilliam was named a second team All-American after the season. The happy occasion was marred, however, by the discovery that Gilliam‚Äôs close friend, Cal Jones, had died in a plane crash in the mountains of western Canada during a howling windstorm. Gridiron Glory Frank Gilliam‚Äôs final game with the Hawkeyes came in the 1957 Rose Bowl, where Iowa defeated Oregon State, 35-19. Professional career Frank Gilliam left to play for Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football League for three seasons from 1957-1959. After retiring from professional football, he was a teacher for a few years before becoming an assistant coach to Jerry Burns at the University of Iowa from 1966-1970. Gilliam then joined the Minnesota Vikings, where he was a scout and personnel man for over 36 years. Sports Illustrated In 1989, Iowa fans selected an all-time University of Iowa football team during the 100th anniversary celebration of Iowa football, and Frank Gilliam was selected as a starting end.Iowa All-Time team References Category:Iowa Hawkeyes football players Category:1934 births Category:Living people Category:Grey Cup champions ","title":"Frank Gilliam"},{"id":"30528392","text":"Content from the United States diplomatic cables leak has depicted New Zealand and related subjects extensively.

Since the initial release date, WikiLeaks is releasing further documents every day. Nuclear policy New Zealand's anti-nuclear policy of the 1980s was partly motivated by economic considerations. A 2004 diplomatic cable reports, \\"officials who were in senior positions in the Lange government at the time the anti-nuclear policy was instituted that one of the considerations favouring the policy was that it would lead to New Zealand withdrawing or being pushed out of Anzus, thereby lessening the country's defence-spending requirements at a time of fiscal and economic crisis\\". In 2005, then-U.S. Ambassador to New Zealand Charles Swindells, sought to have New Zealand reverse its anti-nuclear stance, which was formalised in 1987 by New Zealand's legal prohibition on the entry into New Zealand waters of nuclear-armed or -propelled ships, and urged his colleagues in the U.S. to investigate strategies for changing the policy, including proposing a feasibility study for a free-trade agreement between New Zealand and the U.S. According to the cables, full collaboration between the intelligence agencies of the U.S. and New Zealand ‚Äì curtailed by the U.S. in the 1980s because of New Zealand's anti-nuclear policies ‚Äì were resumed in August 2009, something both governments kept secret. The U.S. Ambassador had concerns that the anti- nuclear legislation had eroded trust in New Zealand, thereby threatening intelligence cooperation. He was reacting to a New Zealand newspaper article which stressed the Ambassador's concern that if New Zealand were expelled from the \\"five-eyes\\" arrangement, the door would be opened for the United States to conduct intelligence gathering operations against the Kiwis. The Sunday Star- Times labelled the then Ambassador's language \\"a clear threat\\" and \\"bully tactics,\\" even though the language used made clear that the Ambassador was raising a potential concern and did not know whether the aftermath of the anti-nuclear flap would result in expulsion of New Zealand from the SIGINT community. 2006 Fijian coup d'√©tat The diplomatic cables leak reveal that the New Zealand government was spying on the military of nearby Fiji leading up to the 2006 Fijian coup d'√©tat. Information obtained was passed on to the U.S. The cable did not contain the information that was gathered.Staff Writer (16 December 2010). \\"New Zealand Government Revealed To Be Spying on Fiji Military\\". Radio New Zealand International. Retrieved 17 December 2010. New Zealand-U.S. relations John Key, former Prime Minister of New Zealand, was upset and embarrassed that U.S. President Barack Obama was too busy to see him, even though Key believed he had a firm invitation from Obama at the Asia- Pacific Economic Cooperation conference. Marian Hobbs Marian Hobbs, New Zealand Labour Party Member of Parliament (1996-2008), was said to thoroughly deserve her nickname of Boo-boo because she had made several diplomatic blunders. China-New Zealand relations Key is discussed in a briefing which stated that Key told Wen Jiabao, Premier of the People's Republic of China, in April 2009 that neither he nor any of his ministers would meet the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader. Iraq War Helen Clark, the ex Prime Minister was furious at a senior staff member at the Defence Ministry who reportedly told the US Embassy that Clark had decided to send soldiers to Iraq to stop Fonterra losing lucrative United Nations Oil for Food contracts. Clark said \\"I mean this is simply preposterous.\\" commenting on a US communique to Washington, which stated that New Zealand defence officials said Clark opposed the Iraq deployment until she was told dairy giant Fonterra might lose UN \\"oil-for-food\\" contracts. She said she was \\"flabbergasted\\" at the \\"ridiculous\\" claim, and denied sending non-combat troops to Iraq in 2003 to ensure one of her country's largest companies retained lucrative UN contracts.Former New Zealand PM denies Iraq troops-for-contracts claim Guantanamo Bay detainees New Zealand was requested to take in terror prisoners from Guantanamo Bay, who were Uyghur. The Acting Deputy Chief of Mission, for the United States Embassy, Katherine Hadda, met the then Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade chief executive Simon Murdoch to ask New Zealand to consider taking in the refugees. But he declined saying there were many strikes against New Zealand taking the refugees, including that the country had exceeded its refugee quota for 2005 and 2006 and had no Uyghur community. Domestic politics New Zealand's Green Party, Labour's coalition partners, were considered likely to move further left following the unexpected death of its relatively pragmatic co-leader Rod Donald. The Greens, who garnered about 5% of the party vote in September's general election, are in a confidence and supply agreement with the Labour coalition Government. Because the party's votes are not needed for Labour to form a Parliamentary majority, they have little real influence on Government policy. But if the current coalition collapses, for example because of a defection by Foreign Minister (and NZ First leader) Winston Peters, Labour might have to make concessions to the Greens to form a new Government. This would hurt Labour's standing among National voters, which is likely to be of little concern to them.

WikiLeaks, a website that publishes documents from anonymous news sources and news leaks began publishing classified documents and diplomatic cables sent from the United States Department of State to diplomatic missions around the world. After the initial release date, other documents were released daily. Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict In a conversation with Congressman Ackerman in 2007, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israeli President Shimon Peres had admitted to him that the Oslo peace process Peres helped initiate was based on a mistaken premise. Netanyahu said Peres had told him the European and U.S. assistance to the Palestinian Authority (PA) had established a \\"bloated bureaucracy, with PA employees looking to the international community to meet their payroll.\\" In one document from April 2007, Netanyahu, who was opposition leader at the time, describes the Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas as a \\"nice man who means well\\" and urges Washington to focus on toppling Hamas through an \\"economic squeeze\\" saying it would be \\"easier to weaken Hamas than to strengthen Abbas.\\" In 2008, U.S. diplomats in the Middle East were instructed to secretly collect personal information on Palestinian leaders, and to monitor closely Israeli military and telecommunication capabilities. One U.S. State Department directive orders U.S. diplomats to report on Israeli Military tactics, techniques, and procedures dealing with conventional and unconventional counterinsurgency operations. In 2007, then Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs Tzipi Livni said she \\"doubted that a final status agreement could be reached with Abbas, and therefore the emphasis should be on reforming Fatah so that it could beat Hamas at the polls.\\" Mossad chief Meir Dagan told U.S. diplomat Frances Fragos Townsend that \\"nothing will be achieved\\" in the peace process according to a secret cable the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv sent to the State Department. During a two-hour meeting, Dagan told Townsend that Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas would \\"likely move to Qatar and join his mysteriously wealthy son there\\" in the event Hamas took over the West Bank. In the same cable, Dagan was recorded accusing Saudi Foreign Minister Saud bin Faisal of playing a \\"very negative role\\" and characterized Qatar as \\"a real problem\\", accusing its leader Sheikh Hamid bin Khalifa al-Thani of \\"annoying everyone.\\" He also suggested the U.S. should move its bases out of Qatar. According to a cable from the U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv, Netanyahu supports the concept of land- swaps with the Palestinian Authority and does not want to govern the West Bank and Gaza but rather to stop attacks from being launched from there. Netanyahu was described by Luis G. Moreno in one cable: 'Netanyahu warned that when Israel left Lebanon it created a first Iranian base, that when it left Gaza it created a second Iranian base, and if Israel \\"promised\\" a third retreat from the West Bank it would see the same results. There were three options, according to Netanyahu, including withdrawing to the 1967 borders (which would \\"get terror, not peace\\"), doing nothing (which he considered \\"just as bad\\"), or \\"rapidly building a pyramid from the ground up.\\" Netanyahu suggested a rapid move to develop the West Bank economically, including \\"unclogging\\" bureaucratic \\"bottlenecks.\\" In April 2007 Benjamin Netanyahu said that the Palestinian right of return would have to be abandoned in return for peace. U.S. Congressman Gary Ackerman summarised his discussion with Netanyahu on this point, saying, 'Netanyahu stated that a return to the 1967 borders and dividing Jerusalem was not a solution since further withdrawals would only whet the appetite of radical Islam. Ackerman asked if the Palestinians would accept peace based on the 1967 lines. Netanyahu said he would not agree to such a withdrawal since the 1967 lines were indefensible, but he added that the \\"right of return\\" was the real acid test of Arab intentions.' =Gaza= In 2008, Israel told U.S. officials that Israel would keep Gaza's economy \\"on the brink of collapse\\", at a level just above that of a humanitarian crisis, according to U.S. diplomatic cables published by Norway's Aftenposten. \\"As part of their overall embargo plan against Gaza, Israeli officials have confirmed to (U.S. embassy economic officers) on multiple occasions that they intend to keep the Gazan economy on the brink of collapse without quite pushing it over the edge,\\" a November 3, 2008 U.S. cable stated. Israel wanted to maintain Gaza \\"functioning at the lowest level possible consistent with avoiding a humanitarian crisis,\\" according to the cable. This Israeli policy was consistent with a January 2008 speech by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert in which he said that \\"We will not harm the supply of food for children, medicine for those who need it and fuel for institutions that save lives. But there is no justification for demanding we allow residents of Gaza to live normal lives while shells and rockets are fired from their streets and courtyards (at southern Israel).\\" According to a 2011 UNRWA report, Gaza unemployment rate is at 45% of the total working age population, and real wages have fallen more than 30% in 2010 since 2006, the year Israel imposed the embargo. \\"These are disturbing trends,\\" said UNRWA spokesman Chris Gunness, \\"and the refugees, who make up two-thirds of Gaza's 1.5 million population, were the worst hit.\\" He said: \\"It is hard to understand the logic of a man-made policy which deliberately impoverishes so many and condemns hundreds of thousands of potentially productive people to a life of destitution.\\" Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak consulted with Fatah of the Palestinian Authority and asked if Fatah could take over control of Gaza Strip after expected Israeli victory during Operation Cast Lead, but met with refusal.Staff writer (29 November 2010). \\"WikiLeaks: Israel Wanted PA To Take Gaza\\". Ynetnews. Retrieved 11 December 2010. In June 2007, after violent clashes between Fatah and Hamas broke out in Gaza, Director of Israel Military Intelligence Major General Amos Yadlin told U.S. Ambassador Richard Jones that he would \\"be happy\\" if Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip. Yadlin stated that a Hamas takeover would be a positive step, because Israel would then be able to declare Gaza as a hostile entity. Jones stated that if Fatah loses control of the Strip, Abbas would be urged to form a separate government in the West Bank. Yadlin replied that such developments would please Israel, because the IDF would not have to deal with Hamas as a stateless body. He also added that Israel would be able to cooperate with a Fatah-controlled West Bank. The relevant cable cautioned that this did not necessarily represent a consensus view within the Israeli government. A cable written in 2006 asserted that some multinational companies ‚Äî Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, Motorola, Dell, etc. ‚Äî complained to U.S. diplomats of being forced to pay bribes to Israeli authorities charged of overseeing the Karni Crossing to have their products distributed into the Gaza Strip. The bribes allegedly occurred one year before Hamas won the 2006 Palestinian legislative elections and Israel imposed the economic embargo over Gaza. In February 2010 IDF Advocate-General Maj. Gen. Avichai Mandelblit revealed to James Cunningham, US Ambassador to Israel, that the Israeli army had used drones in its fight against Gaza militants. The two men met to give the Ambassador more information on the investigation of civilian deaths caused during Operation Cast Lead in Gaza in 2008‚Äì2009. According to the General Mandelblit, 16 civilians were killed in Gaza when a drone fired against militants in front of a mosque. Most of them were praying inside the mosque. Second Lebanon War Netanyahu allegedly described Kadima as a \\"fake party\\" and referred to the Second Lebanon War as \\"stupid\\" and criticized the approach of Ehud Olmert's policies towards the conflict. Iran‚ÄìIsrael relations In August 2007, Mossad chief Meir Dagan suggested to the U.S. to use Iranian student unions and ethnic minority groups to try to overthrow the government of Iran.Staff writer (28 November 2010). \\"WikiLeaks: Dagan Wanted To Topple Iranian Regime\\". Ynetnews. Retrieved 28 November 2010. WikiLeaks documents also suggest that Dagan denied plans to attack a Syrian nuclear facility, just two months before an attack actually happened.Mandel, Roi (29 November 2010). \\"WikiLeaks: Arab World According to Mossad Chief\\". Ynetnews. 11 December 2010. In June 2009 Ehud Barak, Israel's defence minister, told U.S. congressman that Israel \\"saw 2010 as a pivotal year\\" in stopping Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, inferring it would attack Iran if the weapons program was not stopped by then. This is the Israeli military's preferred option. Other revelations included that Israeli Mossad chief Meir Dagan, senior military men and diplomats repeatedly explained to various U.S. visitors Israel's concerns.

The leak, which began on 28 November 2010, occurred when the website of WikiLeaks -- an international new media non-profit organisation that publishes submissions of otherwise unavailable documents from anonymous news sources and news leaks -- started to publish classified documents of detailed correspondence -- diplomatic cables -- between the United States Department of State and its diplomatic missions around the world. Iran-UAE relations =Iran nuclear program= Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed of the United Arab Emirates, referred to as MBZ in the cables, urged the US \\"not to appease Iran\\" and described Iran's then-leader Ahmadinejad to Hitler. He said that UAE is even more worried about Iranian intentions than is Israel and described a nuclear-armed Iran as \\"absolutely untenable\\". He believes that \\"all hell will break loose\\" if Iran attains the bomb, with Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Turkey developing their own nuclear weapons capability and Iran \\"instigating Sunni-Shia conflict\\". In the cable leak, Mohammed bin Zayed was said to believe Israel will strike Iran if Iran develops nuclear missiles, causing Iran to launch missile attacks on the region including the UAE. He believes that an Israeli strike will not be successful in stopping Iran's nuclear program, but instead cause Iran to \\"unleash terror attacks worldwide\\". Mohammad bin Zayed also stated that Iran surrounding Israel is \\"driven by ideological conviction and will threaten Israel's existence should it go nuclear\\". At the same time, he described Iran's ambitions as reflecting a desire to \\"restore Persia's great-power status, rather than driven by religious convictions\\". Mohammed bin Zayed suggested that the key to containing Iran revolves around progress on the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. He argued that it will be essential to bring Arab public opinion in line with the leadership in any conflict with Iran and that roughly \\"eighty percent of the public is amenable to persuasion\\". The US has to bring a two state solution over the objections of the Netanyahu government to win over the people. He suggested working with moderate Palestinians that support the road map, and that \\"there is no time to waste\\". Lebanon-UAE relations =Lebanese Armed Forces= Emirati Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed has said that UAE will purchase additional munitions for Lebanese Armed Forces helicopters, donated by the UAE to LAF last year, but is waiting for France to provide a price estimate. Pakistan-UAE relations =Pakistan's leaders= In July 2009, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, said Zardari was \\"dirty but not dangerous\\" and that former prime minister Nawaz Sharif was \\"dangerous but not dirty -- this is Pakistan\\". =Support to Pakistan F-16 acquisition= Mohammed bin Zayed supported the US's decision to sell F-16 aircraft to Pakistan to strengthen the Musharraf government, saying the sale would not alter the balance of strength between India and Pakistan. =Baloch insurgency= DG ISI General Shuja Pasha commented that India, the UAE, and Russia were funding, arming, and training the Baloch rebels.http://tribune.com.pk/story/84902/wikileaks-india-russia-supporting- baloch-insurgency/ =Drone attacks in Pakistan= In a cable it was noted that UAE had allowed Americans to use an airstrip of UAE in Pakistan (Shamsi Airbase) in order to launch drone strikes against militants. UAE was displeased over publicity of support to US military in Pakistan when it was revealed by General Tommy Franks in his book \\"American Soldier\\" due to the concerns that public knowledge of this confidential assistance may cause risks to the security of UAE or UAE officials in Pakistan.http://www.dawn.com/2011/05/26/2005-uae-upset-over-publicity-of- support-to-us-military-in-pakistan.html =Alleged Indian and Iranian support for insurgents in Pakistan= The UAE believed that India and Iran had aided Taliban and Pushtun separatists in Pakistan, and that Pashtuns in the UAE may be supporting the Taliban. UAE-UK relations =Prince Andrew= Diplomats in the UAE revealed that Mohammed bin Zayed, Abdullah II of Jordan and the UK's Prince Andrew, Duke of York, are \\"close friends\\" that \\"frequently hunt -- in Morocco and Tanzania\\". UAE-US relations =Predator drones= UAE military officials have pressured the US to acquire Predator B drones to be used in countering Iran citing that Iran is known to be developing its own drones. Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed told US General John Abizaid \\"That's why we need it first...give me Predator B\\". =Mohammad bin Zayed= In a cable leak, then US ambassador to UAE Richard G. Olson described Mohammed bin Zayed as \\"The key decision maker on national security issues\\" and assess that he has \\"authority in all matters except for final decisions on oil policy and major state expenditures.\\" He describes the UAE president Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan as \\"a distant and uncharismatic personage\\". Olson sees Mohammed bin Zayed as \\"dynamic member of the generation succeeding the geriatric cases who have dominated the region for decades\\". He continues to state that Mohammed bin Zayed is \\" a reformer, actively seeking to improve the life of his citizens and the UAE's future through better education and health care, and through economic diversification, including investments in clean energy to prepare his citizenry for a post-hydrocarbon future\\". Olston describes that Mohammad bin Zayed has structured the UAE Armed Forces to be closely aligned with the US and continues to \\"support us where he thinks we have been right (Afghanistan), but also where he thinks we have pursued misguided policies (Iraq).\\" =Terror donors= It was noted in a cable that UAE-based donors have provided financial support to a variety of terrorist groups, including al-Qa'ida, the Taliban, LeT, Hamas and other terrorist groups. Washington agencies noted that there is limited information on the identity of Taliban and LeT donors in the UAE. In another cable leak, discussion was noted regarding the UAE regulations requiring declarations for cash imports of over USD 10,800, but no regulations existing covering cash exports. The US embassy was working closely with UAE government on the problem of cash couriers and the need to develop a plan to stop UAE based cash being transferred to fund terror groups.

Wahoo is a stagecoach driver who feeds information of routes and cargoes of stagecoaches to his outlaw confederates Sam and Jim, who rob the stage and shoot at Wahoo to prove he has nothing to do with the robberies. The three split up one night when lawmen surround their camp and they make their escape but Sam is nowhere to be found. Wahoo and Jim continue their racket until one day a Texas Ranger rides shotgun on the couch next to Wahoo. Jim is supposed to rob the stage when the stagecoach stops to water their mules but Wahoo has a feeling about the Ranger and won't let Jim rob the stage, instead bundling a mystified Jim on board as a paying passenger.

Plot The episode begins with Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble) smoking his own strain of marijuana called \\"Brown Betty\\" while Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) attempts to find his son, Peter (Joshua Jackson), who disappeared at the end of the previous episode after learning Walter stole him from a parallel universe. Because Dunham's sister Rachel (Ari Graynor) is unavailable, she brings her niece Ella (Lily Pilblad) to the lab for Walter and Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole) to look after. To pass the time, Walter tells Ella a detective noir story in which Olivia is a private investigator. In the story, Rachel approaches Olivia to find her boyfriend, Peter, who has gone missing. During the investigation, Detective Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick) leads her to Massive Dynamic, where the CEO Nina Sharp (Blair Brown) informs her that Peter is a conman and industrial spy. Later, Rachel is found murdered, with her heart taken. Olivia finds a check signed by Walter Bishop, who in the story, is an inventor that has created \\"everything that is wonderful in the world\\" in order to benefit humanity (hugs, rainbows, bubblegum, singing corpses). Questioning Walter, Olivia learns that Peter worked with Walter, who treated him like a son. One day, Walter made a glass heart but Peter later stole it. Were the heart not to be found, Walter and his ideas would die. To help find Peter, Olivia calls her assistant, \\"Esther Figglesworth\\" (Farnsworth). Later, Olivia follows Nina Sharp, only to find herself kidnapped by a \\"watcher\\" (the Observer, played by Michael Cerveris) working for Sharp. The watcher attempts to kill Olivia by placing her in a wooden crate and sending it out to sea. Fortunately, Olivia is rescued by Peter. After taking her to his hideout, he reveals that the glass heart was his by nature of having been born with it, and that after working with Walter, Peter loved him enough to donate it to him. However, he took it back after learning a terrible secret behind his inventions: they were stolen from children's dreams and replaced with nightmares. Later, the house is under attack by an army of watchers. Olivia fights them off, but not before they manage to take Peter's heart with them. After placing batteries in his heart cavity to act as a temporary measure, Olivia discovers that Walter set up the attack. In the confrontation, Walter apologises for his misdeeds and promises to change. However, Peter does not forgive Walter and leaves him, ending the story. Ella is disappointed by the ending, as that is not how she believes stories ought to end, so she proposes an alternate ending: when Walter says he can change, Peter believes him and splits the glass heart in two, and together they \\"lived happily ever after.\\" At the episode's end, Olivia returns, having found no leads on Peter's location. Farnsworth returns Walter to his home, where the Observer watches from a distance and notes Peter's disappearance. Production The episode was originally called \\"Overture\\", but was later changed to \\"Brown Betty\\" as a reference to Walter's marijuana habit. It was written by executive producers Jeff Pinkner and J. H. Wyman along with consulting producer Akiva Goldsman. Seith Mann served as the director, his only directional credit for the series. For Sweeps Week, the Fox network announced the \\"Fox Rocks\\" campaign, in which various shows within their lineup were encouraged to produce musical episodes in the same vein as the sophomore show Glee. Along with Fringe, Family Guy, Bones, The Simpsons, and a few other Fox series took up the musical theme. The episode was already in development before Fox's announcement. Jeff Pinkner stated that the music was not in the original plan for the episode, but was added to fit into Fox's sweeps stunt. As the episode occurred after the big reveal of Peter's true identity (\\"The Man from the Other Side\\"), the writers knew they wanted \\"Brown Betty\\" to explore the aftermath from Walter's damaged psyche. Fox did not ask for a full-blown musical, but requested that some music be integrated into the episode in any shape or form. Pinkner elaborated: > \\"We came up with a narrative device to really explore Walter's feelings. We > had largely all the elements of the episode in place and Fox called and > said, 'Hey, how would you guys feel about if we asked you to have some > musical element in the show? Anything, like just feature a song playing.' > They didn't ask us to do Glee. And we instantly, before we got off the > phone, said, 'Well, this is what we're thinking for the episode and here's > an idea how that could work for us.' We turned their request into what felt > like a positive for us and really deepened and sort of blew the episode out > even further in the direction we were already taking it\\". The episode begins with Walter smoking his own strain of marijuana while listening to \\"Roundabout\\" by the band Yes. The scene was originally removed out of concern it would be airing on network television, but was later reinserted because \\"the story itself had so many different genres playing. We had a noir element. We had a musical element. and it just really played funnier coming from an altered state of Walter\\", according to co-producer Tanya Swerling. Jeff Pinkner added \\"We set out to do an episode that explored Walter's state of mind ‚Äî he's dealing with some very upsetting news. When we realized that the way Walter would deal with such news would be to try to anesthetize himself with copious amounts of marijuana, well, singing and dancing became a natural outcome.\\" Music supervisor Charles Scott IV and J.R. Wyman are big Yes fans, and consequently chose the song that appeared in the opening scene. As the episode was done with a 1940s aesthetic, every department had to act accordingly. Torv's normally straight hair was placed into a curl hairdo fashionable for the time period, and lighting changes were made to reflect the period as well. New furniture was brought in for various sets, such as Walter's lab and Nina's office at Massive Dynamic, which was then removed in preparation for the following week. The ending was a challenge for the producers, as it was supposed to end with Ella's version of the story conclusion and Walter still feeling upset over Peter's absence, but they felt this ended making viewers feel depressed. They debated ways to make it a happier tone, so Wyman added the Observer scene to change the feeling of the episode, and prepare viewers for next week. As guest actor Leonard Nimoy, who plays William Bell, was unavailable to shoot the brief conversation with Blair Brown's Nina Sharp, the producers knew they wanted to do something a little more creative for the scene. They talked to cartoonist Frank Miller and hired a special effects school to do all the modeling, which they accomplished based on photos of Nimoy, because the actor could not come in to have his head scanned; he did some voicework however. The finished scene included an animated version of Nimoy's head, shown through the same window as the one used in \\"Peter\\". Pinkner thought the added musical element improved the episode, because it gave insights into each of the characters' psyches. According to Wyman and Pinkner, the \\"episode was supposed to be a fantastical episode in the first place, and so the music supports the storytelling\\". Wyman continued in a different interview with the Los Angeles Times that \\"Noirs traditionally are morality tales, and that's kind of what we're doing. We felt that that was a great way to get across Walter's mind frame and where his head is at right now, with his son missing\\". Other cast members also praised the added music. John Noble wrote \\"It really deepened and blew the episode out even further in the direction we were already taking. We get [Walter's] fractured take on the world and his condition now that Peter has left. The music really supports the storytelling\\". He added, \\"It is like a mind-trip of Walter's. It is Walter trying to grapple with the fact that his son is gone\\". Jasika Nicole continued: \\"I have a musical theater background, so I've been waiting for some moment in some realm of where I am in TV and film for this to happen and, you know, of course, when Glee came on the air I was like, 'Great, that was my chance,' and I'm in this show, which I love this show, but I'm never going to sing and dance in this show. And I did! It's so awesome!\\" Swerling called it \\"the longest and possibly most difficult episode of the season\\" to create. As with other Fringe episodes, Fox released a science lesson plan for grade school children focusing on the science seen in \\"Brown Betty\\", with the intention of having \\"students learn about fingerprints and how they can be collected and used as evidence to identify an individual.\\" =Music= The co-music supervisor, Billy Gottlieb, called the episode a \\"little mini feature film in the sense that we had a lot of camera performances with the music.\\" In order to get the best performances out of the cast and be able to shoot the scenes in various different ways, the producers had the actors go into a music studio in Vancouver and record their respective musical numbers. According to Gottlieb, the actors were very nervous about singing in the episode, despite their parts being around a mere 40 seconds. Actor Joshua Jackson, who plays Peter Bishop, was adamant that he not sing in the episode, despite the fact he frequently sings on set, causing him to be one of the few cast members with no musical part. As the original script contained no musical number for Jasika Nicole, she emailed Jeff Pinkner specifically asking him to let her sing, which he then approved. Some critics noted their surprise that Tony Award-winning actor Michael Cerveris did not sing in the episode. The producers were initially going to have him sing Django Reinhardt's \\"Blue Moon\\", but changed their minds because they thought it would be better to keep the Observer out of the musical aspect of the episode. Despite the pre-recordings, the audio used in the episode was taken from the actors actually singing on set. Tanya Swerling believed the recordings were not a wasted effort however, as it helped make the actors more comfortable about singing on set. At the end of shooting, Gottlieb believed \\"everybody was great... they could jump on stage and do Broadway and it wouldn't be a problem for any of them\\". He and other crew members called Jasika Nicole \\"probably the most accomplished\\" musical person of the cast. As one of the episode writers, Akiva Goldsman chose the Stevie Wonder song \\"For Once in My Life\\". On composing the episode's score, Chris Tilton cited Chinatown as a big influence, and commented \\"the idea was to have this noir feel but still not be totally away from Fringe\\". The episode featured excerpted music from the following tracks: #Yes' \\"Roundabout\\", heard in background #Tears for Fears' \\"Head over Heels\\", also sung by Walter and lip- synched by Rachel #Traffic's \\"Low Spark of High Heeled Boys\\", played on piano and sung by Broyles #A Chorus Line's \\"I Hope I Get It\\", sung by Astrid #Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory's \\"The Candy Man\\", sung by the singing corpses and later by Walter #Miles Davis' \\"Freddie Freeloader\\", played at the Peter house #Stevie Wonder's \\"For Once in My Life\\", sung by Olivia #Ella Fitzgerald's \\"Blue Moon\\", heard in background and also danced by Peter and Olivia Reception =Ratings= \\"Brown Betty\\" was watched by 5.551 million viewers in the United States, with a 3.4 share out 5 among all households and a 2.0/6 share of the audience aged 18‚Äì49. The episode fell five percent from the previous week. =Reviews= The episode premiered to generally positive reviews. Although initially cringing over the musical premise, Ramsey Isler of IGN called the episode \\"admittedly fun\\" because it \\"gave us an indirect window to view how Walter feels about himself\\". In a review of the DVD, another critic from IGN later called it the \\"worst overall episode\\" of the season however, asking the question \\"Musical numbers and Olivia Dunham: who thought this would be a good idea?\\" Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly was also initially irritated after hearing Fox's musical plans, and consequently gave \\"Fringe a lot of credit for pulling off this hour so cleverly\\" Jennifer Walker from TV Fanatic thought the episode was \\"bizarre\\" to watch; it \\"held our interest for the entire 60 minutes, but really failed to introduce any new information about Peter and the unknown man that has crossed into our dimension\\". MTV's John Wigler loved the \\"noir\\" element, and thought \\"each and every participating \\"Fringe\\" cast member exhibited great musical ability. Overall, it was a very solid effort on everyone's part\\". Jane Boursaw of TV Squad loved the scenes between Walter and Ella, and thought \\"it was downright brilliant to create a story within a story\\". While he praised the episode's production and the singing abilities of the cast, Kurt Anthony Krug of Mania.com wrote a negative review: \\"All in all, what was supposed to be a fun filler episode before the question of where Peter went at the end of the last episode when he found out he was the Peter from an alternate reality ‚Äì one of the turning points in the show‚Äôs mythology ‚Äì fell flat\\". Sarah Stegall of SFScope enjoyed it, writing \\"There was just enough music, and just enough dance, to season this story without overburdening it\\". She praised the risktaking it took to make the episode \\"edgy and whimsical, casting aside the concrete conventions of television storytelling...Not only was it entertaining, but it moved the storyline forward on some important emotional fronts, as the characters deal with Peter's disappearance in ways that protect them, but reveal as well\\". Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times also was impressed with the cast's singing abilities, and praised the writers' risk- taking: \\"that just goes to show how well thought out, creative, and just plain fun tonight‚Äôs ‚ÄúFringe‚Äù really was. A lot of people would have pegged a 1940s film noir musical episode as a big risk, but the bigger the risk, the bigger the pay out\\". Rhee Dee of Pinkraygun.com commented \\"After the revelation in the last episode, and Peter running away, this episode was a great way to express Walter‚Äôs grief and guilt about this whole situation without actually watching Walter talk about how sad and guilty he feels about everything. Walter‚Äôs story serves as a powerful metaphor for how he actually feels\\". Tim Grierson of New York Magazine thought the episode turned out to be simply mediocre because \\"its noir elements weren‚Äôt incorporated in a really interesting way, and as for the musical numbers, they tended to be throwaway bits, save for ‚Äúfictional‚Äù Dunham crooning ‚ÄúFor Once in My Life‚Äù to the seemingly dying ‚Äúfictional‚Äù Peter near the episode‚Äôs end\\". Grierson continued that \\"If a show is going to completely throw away its usual rulebook for a fun onetime-only episode, it would be great if the writers could come up with a story as audacious as their premise. But aside from some Chinatown references, fancy threads, and mildly clever mirroring of the show‚Äôs mythology ‚Äî Massive Dynamic is up to no good in this story-land world as well ‚Äî 'Brown Betty' wasn‚Äôt all that enjoyable because it didn‚Äôt do a great job of capturing what generally makes Fringe enjoyable\\". Noel Murray of The A.V. Club graded the episode an A-, while Television Without Pity gave it a C+. Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named it the fourth best episode of the series, explaining \\"The late season lark that officially launched a tradition for similar stunts, the musical film noir homage 'Brown Betty'... was an offbeat gem that expressed all of Fringes core themes ‚Äî redemption, connection, rehumanization ‚Äî and encapsulated the key relationships (the slow-moving Walter-Peter reconciliation; Peter and Olivia's carefully tended soul-deep romance) more poignantly than most on-point episodes of Fringe, and it left fans wanting the show to keep pushing the innovation. It could never do it enough.\\" In a similar list, Den of Geek named it the ninth best episode of the series, explaining that \\"it shouldn‚Äôt work, and yet it does, because although technically nothing happens, the episode shows us just how deep Walter has sunk into a metaphorical pit of despair and guilt, making himself the villain in his own story and despairing of ever being forgiven. It also gives the audience a refreshing break from some of the high level angst of the end of the season, allowing Peter and Olivia to act out a properly romantic storyline while their characters in the ‚Äòreal‚Äô world have been torn apart. Also, there are singing corpses in it. Only on Fringe.\\" =Awards and nominations= \\"Brown Betty,\\" along with Music Editor Paul Apelgren, was nominated for Best Sound Editing: TV Short Form Music in a Musical by the Motion Picture Sound Editors for the 2011 Golden Reel Awards. \\"The Box\\", a season three Fringe episode, was also nominated for Best Sound Editing: TV Short Form Music. \\"Brown Betty\\" lost to an episode of Glee.

The dark green, spear-shaped (lanceolate to oblong- lanceolate) leaves have rounded bases and measure long by wide. The leaf margins roll downwards. The cream-white flowers appear from October to February, being most abundant in December, and are across and long. They are arranged in umbels. The peduncles are long. Fruiting takes place 2‚Äì3 months after flowering. The seed pods are narrow with a tapered tip, and are cm long by wide. They open to release the feathery seeds from August to January. The seeds are then blown away by the wind. Distribution and habitat The species ranges from Port Macquarie to Bega in eastern New South Wales. It grows in wet sclerophyll forest in association with such species as turpentine (Syncarpia glomulifera), Sydney peppermint (Eucalyptus piperita) and blackbutt (E. pilularis), generally on sandy alluvial soils. It is also found in dry sclerophyll forest with red bloodwood (Corymbia gummifera), stiff-leaf wattle (Acacia obtusifolia) and paperbark tea-tree (Leptospermum trinervium), and can be found in rainforest gullies. The yearly rainfall is over 800 mm. Ecology Marsdenia suaveolens resprouts after bushfire, and has been recorded setting fruit five months after a burn. Marsdenia suaveolens is foraged upon by caterpillars of the common crow (Euploea core) Cultivation In 1820, The Botanical Register reported that Marsdenia suaveolens flowered in the United Kingdom in Colville Nursery in Chelsea. The flower's fragrance was greatly praised and compared to that of Heliotropium peruvianum (now Heliotropium arborescens). It can be grown in well-drained soil in a spot with some shelter in the garden.

Life and work Boman was born in Falun, Sweden, in 1867. He relocated to Argentina in 1889, and completed his secondary schooling in Buenos Aires and Catamarca. He remained in the mountainous Province of Catamarca, and was appointed a Justice of the Peace.American Anthropologist. (January ‚Äî March 1926). Boman began his archaeological experience in a 1901 Swedish expedition into Purmamarca and the Quebrada de Humahuaca (Jujuy Province) directed by Baron Erland Nordenskiold, a nobleman whose family included a number of noted travelers; Nordenskiold later authored an account of that expedition, Travels on the Boundaries of Bolivia and Argentina. Boman joined a further expedition, with Marquis Georges de Crequi-Montfort, into the Cerro Cha√±i area (Jujuy), in 1903, and discovered Tastil, an Atacame√±o settlement that was one of the region's most significant until their siege by troops of the Inca Empire. He compiled his findings in Antiquit√©s de la r√©gion andine de la Republique Argentine et du d√©sert d'Atacama (\\"Antiquities in the Andean Region of Argentina and in the Atacama Desert\\"), which, when published in 1908, was recognized as one of the first comprehensive archaeological studies of the Argentine Northwest (comparable only to Juan Bautista Ambrosetti's work).Historical Dictionary of Argentina.

Israel is one of only a few countries in the world with a mandatory military service requirement for women. According to the IDF, 535 female Israeli soldiers had been killed in combat operations between the period 1962-2016 (this figure does not include the dozens of female soldiers killed in Israeli service prior to 1962). Women have taken part in Israel‚Äôs military before and since the founding of the state in 1948, fulfilling various roles within the Ground, Naval and Air Forces. The 2000 Equality amendment to the Military Service law states that \\"The right of women to serve in any role in the IDF is equal to the right of men.\\" Up until 2001, women conscripts served in the Women's Corps, commonly known by its Hebrew acronym, CHEN. After a five-week period of basic training they served as clerks, drivers, welfare workers, nurses, radio operators, flight controllers, ordnance personnel, and course instructors. As of 2011, 88% of all roles in the IDF are open to female candidates, while women can be found in 69% of all positions.\\"Women of the IDF\\". IDF Spokesperson's Unit.

In 2014, the IDF said that fewer than 4 percent of women are in combat positions such as infantry, tank crews, artillery guns service, fighter pilots, etc. Rather, they are concentrated in \\"combat-support\\".Gaza: It's a Man's War The Atlantic, 7 Aug 2014 History =Pre-independence= Women training at Mishmar HaEmek, during the 1947‚Äì48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine Before the establishment of the state, women served in combat roles in the militias that would become the Israel Defense Forces. The rate of women who took part in combat organizations stood at 20%. At the years before the establishment of the IDF, military service for women existed in the lines of the Hashomer and Haganah organizations. The Haganah stated in its law that its lines were open to: \\"Every Jewish male or female, who is prepared and trained to fulfill the obligation of national defense.\\" Most served as medics, communications specialists, and weaponeers. During WWII approximately 4,000 women volunteered for service in the British assisting forces. One of them, Alice Hatzor-Hirsch, was about 16 when she joined the Hagana. In 1942, she joined the British army as a driver. \\"We were more connected than the others,\\" she recalled years later. \\"A girl becoming a driver in the British army was considered the height of boldness at the time.\\" In Tel-Aviv of the 1940s, a battalion was established in which women filled positions in security, weapons transport, and manned anti-aircraft posts. During the winter of 1948, women joined the combat soldiers of the Palmach, who traveled from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem with their weapons concealed in their clothes. The Palmach arm (thirty percent of which were women) trained nine female platoon commanders, and other female squad commanders. =War of Independence= A female officer of the Haganah demonstrates handling a Sten gun during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War On 26 May 1948, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion officially set up the IDF as the country's army. On 18 August 1948, mandatory conscription for single and married women without children (born between the years 1920‚Äì1930) began. Women served in many positions including nurses, signal operators, drivers, clerks, cooks and more. The Women's Corps, under which all women served, was responsible for taking care of women soldiers' needs and for their training and integration into different IDF units. The Women's Corps also sent young women soldiers to be teachers in developing areas and immigrant neighborhoods of Israel. =Post-independence= Female soldiers in 1950 An Uzi-armed Israeli on guard duty in the Negev (1956). IDF women soldiers between 1953 and 1954 Apart from the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, when manpower shortages saw many Palmach and IDF women taking active part in land battles, women were historically barred from battle in the IDF, serving in a variety of technical and administrative support roles. Soon after the establishment of the IDF, the removal of all women from front-line positions was decreed. Decisive for this decision was the very real possibility of falling into enemy hands as prisoners of war. It was fair and equitable to demand from women equal sacrifice and risk, it was argued, but the risk for women prisoners of rape and sexual molestation was infinitely greater than the same risk for men. A majority of women serving in the IDF then were secretaries. The rest served primarily as instructors, nurses, clerks and telephone operators. A few women flew transport missions in the 1950s and a few women were accepted into flight training in the 1970s, but did not complete the program before it was closed to women. Yael Rom, the first female pilot trained by the Israeli Air Force, earned her wings in 1951. Hava Inbar, a lawyer, was appointed the judge of the military court in Haifa in September 1969, thus becoming the first female military judge in the world. \\"I do not know if I want to be a military judge my whole life,\\" she said in an interview, \\"but I am glad that I was appointed; it proves that the IDF leaves almost all doors open for its female soldiers.\\" IDF female soldiers on parade, Jerusalem, 1968 During the Yom Kippur War, due to a growing need for ground forces, women were needed in roles in the field. According to Rina Bar-Tal, chair of the Israel Women's Network, roles for women beyond technical and secretarial support only started to open up in the late 1970s and early '80s, because of manpower shortages. Since then, a few women have earned ranks higher than colonel. In 1986, Amira Dotan, then head of the Women's Corps, became the first female brigadier-general. In July 2018, an IDF Captain, Or Na'aman, ordered a Patriot missile battery to shoot down a Syrian drone and fighter jet over Israel's Golan Heights, which earned her a certificate of appreciation. Gender equality Ethiopian Jewish origin IDF infantry instructors course Civilian pilot and aeronautical engineer Alice Miller successfully petitioned the High Court of Justice to take the Israeli Air Force pilot training exams, after being rejected on grounds of gender. Though president Ezer Weizman, a former IAF commander, told Miller that she'd be better off staying home and darning socks, the court eventually ruled in 1996 that the IAF could not exclude qualified women from pilot training. Even though Miller would not pass the exams, the ruling was a watershed, opening doors for women in new IDF roles. Female legislators took advantage of the momentum to draft a bill allowing women to volunteer for any position, if they could qualify. In 2000, the Equality amendment to the Military Service law stated that \\"The right of women to serve in any role in the IDF is equal to the right of men.\\" The amendment that female lawmakers had drafted granted equal opportunities to women found physically and personally suitable for a job. The question of who and what was \\"suitable\\" was left to the discretion of military leaders on a case-by-case basis. Women did start to enter combat support and light combat roles in a few areas, including the Artillery Corps, infantry units and armored divisions. A few platoons named Carakal were formed for men and women to serve together in light infantry. By 2000 Carakal became a full-fledged battalion. Many women would also join the Border Police. The first female jet fighter pilot, Roni Zuckerman, received her wings in 2001. By 2006, the first female pilots and navigators graduated from the IAF training course, and several hundred women entered combat units, primarily in support roles, like intelligence gatherers, instructors, social workers, medics and engineers. When the Second Lebanon War broke out, it was the first time since 1948 that women were in field operations alongside men. Airborne helicopter engineer Sgt.-Maj. (res.) Keren Tendler was the first female IDF combat soldier to be killed in action. In November 2007 the Air Force appointed its first woman deputy squadron commander. On 23 June 2011, Orna Barbivai became the first female Major-General in the IDF upon her promotion to the role of commander of the Manpower Directorate. She is the second woman to serve on the General Staff. In 2012, Capitan Merav Buchris became the first female ammunition Officer in the Air force, she started her military career as a Shoher at the Technical Academy in Haifa. In 2013, in a first, a female IDF soldier was called up to the Torah during a service on a military base. Also in 2013, the IDF announced they would, for the first time, allow a (MTF) transgender woman to serve in the army as a female soldier. In 2014, there were several more firsts for women in the IDF. The IDF appointed Major Oshrat Bacher as Israel's first female combat battalion commander; Dr. Shani became the first female combat doctor in an elite counterterror unit in the IDF (specifically, the Duvdevan counterterrorism unit); and the IDF decided to allow female kosher supervisors to work in its kitchens on military bases. Service Mandatory service for women in the IDF is 24 months, apart from roles specified in law which require a service length of 36 months. Women may be exempted from military service for reasons of religious conscience, marriage, pregnancy, or motherhood. A woman may receive an exemption on religious grounds under the following conditions: # She has declared that for reasons of conscience, or a religious way of life, she is prevented from doing military service and has proven this to the satisfaction of the exemption committee. # She keeps the laws of Kashrut at home and outside. # She does not travel on Shabbat. Women who arrive in Israel at age 17 and over are generally exempt from army service, but may serve on a voluntary basis. Also, women (who are not fighters) are not generally called up for reserve duty if they are married, or if they are beyond age 24. Combat roles Anastasia Bagdalov, awarded a military commendation for her role during the 2011 Sinai attacks. A passenger on the bus, she used her T-shirt and another passenger's bra as tourniquets to save the life of a severely wounded soldier. Female soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces in training Clause 16A of the military service law requires that female combat soldiers serve 2 years and 4 months of mandatory service, and continue in reserves service up to age 38. Each year, 1,500 female soldiers are drafted into the IDF. Women were employed in full combat roles during the War of Independence and early years. An incident involving the abuse of a woman's corpse led to their withdrawal from full combat until 2000, when the Caracal Battalion was raised. In 2014, the IDF appointed Major Oshrat Bacher as Israel‚Äôs first female combat battalion commander. The most notable combat option for women is the Caracal Battalion, which is a light infantry force that is made up of 70 percent female soldiers. The unit undergoes combat infantry training. There are two other mixed-sex infantry battalions: the Lions of Jordan Battalion and the Bardelas Battalion. The IDF commando K9 unit, Oketz, also drafts females as combat soldiers. Women are also allowed to join the Combat Intelligence Collection Corps, and to serve as search and rescue personnel in the IDF Home Front Command's Search and Rescue Force, officially classified as a combat unit. Women are allowed to serve as tank crews in the Border Defense Array, in units guarding the Egyptian and Jordanian borders. Despite being officially classified as combat soldiers, women in combat roles are not deliberately deployed into combat situations. They are expected to respond in the event a combat situation does erupt, but are not deployed to situations where there is a high risk of combat. The three mixed-sex infantry battalions and female-crewed tanks are deployed to border patrol duties on the Israeli borders with Egypt and Jordan and security duties in the Jordan Valley, and female soldiers are barred from joining the frontline combat brigades which are deployed in the event of war. Women's affairs advisor The Field Training Week in Southern Israel, part of the IDF Infantry Instructors course (2006) The Women's Corps was dismantled in 2000, so that female soldiers for the first time would fall under the authority of individual units based on jobs and not on gender. They would wear the insignia of their units instead of the insignia of the Women's Corps. The position of Women's Affairs Advisor to the Chief of Staff was created in 2001. The female officer holding the position is in charge of ensuring more opportunities and a suitable environment for female soldiers, as well as better enhancing their skills. The mission of the advisor is described by the IDF as \\"empowering women, the IDF and Israeli society by promoting conditions that allow for the optimal use of the capabilities of women serving in the IDF; promoting equal opportunities for women during their military service; and assimilating women into military leadership positions.\\"  Service exemptions  Sixty‚Äìfive percent of Israeli women serve in the army, 25 percent opt out on religious grounds, the remainder are exempted for physical, emotional or marital reasons.Anne R. Bloom: Women in the Defense Forces, in: Swirski, Barbara und Safir, Marylin P.: Calling the equality bluff ‚Äì Women in Israel, New York 1991, p. 141. A law passed in 1978 made exemptions for women on religious grounds automatic upon the signing of a simple declaration attesting to the observance of orthodox religious practices. This legislation raised considerable controversy, and IDF officials feared that the exemption could be abused by any nonreligious woman who did not wish to serve and thus further exacerbate the already strained personnel resources of the IDF. Women exempted on religious grounds were legally obliged to fulfill a period of alternative service doing social or educational work assigned to them. In practice, however, women performed such service only on a voluntary basis. 2007 Segev Committee report Field intelligence combat unit In 2007, then Head of Manpower Directorate, Aluf (Maj. Gen.) Elazar Stern, appointed a committee to define women's service in the IDF in the next decade, with the objective of increasing equal opportunities in women's service in the IDF. The committee, headed by Maj. Gen. (res.) Yehuda Segev, submitted its report to Stern in September 2007. In September 2008, the 100-page report was presented to the IDF General Staff. Rav Aluf Gabi Ashkenazi, then-Chief of Staff, voiced support for the committee's vision: > The IDF, as a leading organization in Israeli society, designates the > service of men and women to a fulfilling and respectful service based upon > equal opportunities in the service of [the] IDF and the State of Israel. The committee called for the annulment of the model that has been in place since the 1950s, under which a soldier's length of service and service options is largely determined by gender. \\"This is an archaic model that causes under- utilization of the resources ... of half of Israeli society, and closes off many opportunities, both during service and for integrating into society after service,\\" the report said. Caracal Battalion training In 2007, 12 percent of all army jobs were completely closed to women. The report partially attributed it to the shorter length of service, as a barrier to putting women in the most demanding and important jobs. Hence postings are \\"to a large extent\\" determined by gender rather than a soldier's talents and abilities. Instead, the length of service \\"should depend solely on the job, rather than on one's gender.\\" The report advised making it harder for women to get an exemption from mandatory service and curbing the phenomenon of women falsely claiming exemptions on religious grounds. It also said the criteria for exemptions from service should be the same for both men and women. The panel recommended mandatory quotas for promoting women, with the goal of giving women a \\"significant presence\\" in the army's \\"senior decision-making ranks.\\" In addition, it called for creating an effective, well-funded system to ensure proper working environments for both men and women, and for drafting a \\"gender code\\" that would lay down explicit rules for interaction between the sexes. \\"There should be no jobs or units categorically closed to either women or men,\\" it said. \\"Service in all units, postings and missions would be joint, subject to the rules of appropriate integration.\\" The committee proposed opening all jobs to women aside from a handful to be determined by a special committee, whose decisions would require the approval of the Chief of Staff, the Defense Minister and the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. It said the initial screening and assignment process should be unified so that men and women are part of the same system and receive their assignments based on the same criteria, including for acceptance into combat units. The panel proposed implementing this change gradually over the course of a decade.  Issues  Soldiers of the Caracal mixed gender battalion during a platoon exercise in southern Israel =Religious objections= In 1950 chief rabbis Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog and Ben-Zion Meir Hai Uziel issued a ruling forbidding women to join the IDF. In the 1980s Rabbi Meir Kahane ardently opposed women serving in the IDF, advocating national service instead. As of 2014 David Lau and Yitzhak Yosef of the Chief Rabbinate were opposed to religious women serving in the IDF, as was Safed Chief Rabbi Shmuel Eliyahu. However, Finance Minister Yair Lapid opposes this position and wants Lau and Yosef to be removed from the Chief Rabbinate because of it. Economy Minister Naftali Bennett stated \\"I believe that all girls should do either IDF service or national service. With that, the attack on the rabbis for their traditional position is an unacceptable attack on the respect due them.\\" Education Minister Shai Piron said he backs the chief rabbis' injunction against observant women enlisting in the IDF. In 2003 Piron had said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know of any rabbis that would allow [observant women] to serve in the army. The halachic authorities saw the reality from a joint education and spiritual perspective, this view led them to their halachic conclusion‚Ä¶ The problem with IDF service is the general atmosphere that does not allow for a life without [religious] pitfalls.‚Äù MK Elazar Stern said, \\"A week ago the Chief Rabbis announced that a female serving in the IDF results in an aveira similar to Chilul Shabbos. This is tantamount to issuing a call to women, at least those who view themselves as religious, not to serve in the IDF...I served in the IDF for a few years and I state the military cannot function without women unless we lengthen the service of males to 4.5 years. The price that we will pay by the call of the Chief Rabbinate Council that females do not enlist is not that of our daughters, but the daughters of these very same rabbis who don't serve.\\" Rabbi Shlomo Riskin, the Rabbi of the city of Efrat, supports women's enlistment in the IDF. Also, in 2014 the Beit Hillel association of national-religious rabbis issued a ruling in Jewish law stating that women are allowed to serve in the IDF; however, Rabbi Shlomo Aviner claimed that Beit Hillel did not have the authority to make such a ruling. Observant Jewish women are allowed to do national service instead of enlisting in the IDF. The IDF offers Haredim men \\"women free and secular free\\" recruitment centers. Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon expressed his willingness to relax regulations to meet the demands of ultra-Orthodox rabbis. Regulations regarding gender equality had already been relaxed so that Haredim could be assured that men would not receive physical exams from female medical staff. =Sexual harassment= In Israel and Its Army: From Cohesion to Confusion, Stuart A. Cohen has argued that prior to the 1990s, there had existed a general consensus in the IDF that \\"sexual prowess goes hand in hand with military accomplishment.\\" Even when social attitudes were changing in the 1980s, the IDF was still inclined towards tolerance and a senior army official warned of not blowing the \\"topic out of all proportion.\\"Stuart A. Cohen. Israel and Its Army: From Cohesion to Confusion, pg. 66-67 In 1993, the Maariv reported that only 10% of around 1,000 reported cases of sexual harassment each year are investigated.Susan Starr Sered. \\"A Cultural Climate in the IDF That Legitimises Sexual Harassment of Women Soldiers\\", in What Makes Women Sick?: Maternity, Modesty, and Militarism in Israeli Society, UPNE, 2000. pg. 92 Reports of sexual harassment against women in the Israeli army reached an average of one a day in 1999, an increase on the 280 complainants received in 1997. In 1998-99, 54 officers were expelled from the army on such charges, others faced demotion or prison. In one high-profile case, General Yitzchak Mordechai was charged with sexual assault and harassment. Another case involved the promotion of General Nir Galili after being accused of grooming a young female recruit for intimate relations. This issue has led the Israeli military to being described by the feminist American writer Laura Sjoberg as a \\"hothouse for exploitive sexual relationships\\" and a force whose fighting culture is based on \\"rampant licentiousness.\\"Laura Sjoberg, Sandra Via. Gender, War, and Militarism: Feminist Perspectives (2010). pg. 87 While the army has since tried to curb sexual harassment, it remains a problem. In 2004, it was reported that 1 in 5 women soldiers suffer sexual harassment.Stuart A. Cohen Israel and Its Army: From Cohesion to Confusion pg. 68 =Singing controversy= In September 2011, because of a religious ban on men hearing women sing,Rabbi Eliezer Melamed, Military Orders that Contradict Jewish Law nine religiously-observant cadets in the IDF officer's course walked out of an evening seminar on the legacy of the 2008 Operation Cast Lead in Gaza when a band comprising two male and two female vocalists took the stage to sing. The commander of the school expelled four of them, after they said they would disobey orders again. The IDF agreed to re-examine regulations on this issue, given the growing number of Haredi soldiers in combat units. In October 2011, women soldiers were ordered to leave a post-Simhat Torah celebration on orders from IDF rabbis, and asked to dance in a separate area. In November 2011, nineteen reserve Major Generals sent a protest letter to Defense Minister Ehud Barak and IDF Chief of Staff Benny Gantz and warned against harming the motivation of women to serve in the army and undermining \\"the fundamental values of Israeli society.\\" Gallery File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - Female Soldiers Unload their Weapons.jpgFemale soldiers of the IDF File:IDF Soldiers Shooting Practice.jpgShooting practice File:IDF-women- soldiers.jpgIDF women soldiers File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - IDF Female Infantry Instructor Takes it All Out with Her Machine Gun.jpgIDF female infantry instructor File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - Female Soldier at the Shooting Range.jpgField Training Week in Southern Israel (2006) File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - Female Troops Get Fit in the Field.jpgField Training Week in Southern Israel (2006) File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - Soldier Participates in the IDF Combat Fitness Competition, Nov 2010.jpgFemale combat soldier taking part in the IDF-wide Combat Fitness Competition (2010) File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - Female Tank Instructors Conduct Drill (14).jpgIDF female tank instructors of the School of Infantry Professions conducted a drill File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - Becoming A Soldier of the Caracal Battalion (59).jpgAn Israel Defense Forces soldier of the unisex Caracal Battalion armed with CTAR-21 with Meprolight 21 reflex sight.

Biography Rhoda Coghill was born in Dublin and studied from the age of eight with Patricia Read at the Leinster School of Music. Between 1913 and 1925 she won 21 prizes at the Feis Ceoil (Irish music competition), among them first prizes for piano solo, piano accompaniment and piano duet, after 1923 for composition. In that year she completed her largest score, the rhapsody Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking for tenor solo, mixed chorus and orchestra, to a text by Walt Whitman.

She continued her piano studies with Arthur Schnabel in Berlin (1927-8) to whom she had been recommended by Fritz Brase. In 1939 she took a position as the accompanist of Radio √âireann, where she remained until 1969. In this capacity she has worked with major performers of her day, both Irish and international,Pine (2005), p. 92, cites Leon Goossens, Evelyn Barbirolli, Wanda Wi≈Çkomirska, and Josef Suk. and gave exemplary interpretations of contemporary Irish works. She was known for remarkable sight-reading capacities and her absolute ear. She also appeared as a concerto soloist, reliably attracting large audiences.Pine (2005), p. 93. Coghill stopped composing in the early 1940s, concentrating on her performing career, but began writing and translating poetry (three publications between 1948 and 1958). It has been suggested that a reason for this re-orientation may have been that in the poetry and literature-dominated perception of Irish culture it was easier to receive acknowledgements as a poet rather than as a composer.Klein (1996), p. 377; see Bibliography. Coghill remained unmarried and spent her late years from 1982 at Westfield House, Morehampton Road, Dublin, where she died aged 96. Her music manuscripts as well as some notebooks and diaries are located in Trinity College, Dublin (MS 11111). Music The rhapsody Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking is one of the most forward-looking Irish compositions in the first half of the twentieth century. Written during the Civil War in Ireland in 1923, it was first performed in a small format, with a small orchestra and a vocal quartet replacing the chorus, in the 1950s; the first performance did not take place before 1990. Up to this time, Coghill had never heard an orchestra, but had a good knowledge of orchestral music from studying scores. The work is set for tenor solo, mixed chorus and orchestra, is in one continuous movement of about 23 to 25 minutes duration. The text is based on a poem of the same title by Walt Whitman.Sea Drift (1903) by Frederick Delius also sets (parts of) this poem, but Coghill was not aware of this when she wrote the piece; see Klein (1996), p. 179. The work is remarkable for its unconventional tenor line (resembling the irregular metre of the poetry), the use of whole-tone scales, and its overall serious expression and emotional drama.Klein (1996), p. 178‚Äì185. One of the reasons why she didn't write more orchestral music or why she didn't promote the score for so long may also lie in her modesty as a practising Quaker.Klein (1996), p. 185. Her songs show a sensitive and skilled hand in setting words, be it in folksong arrangements or in original compositions. Some are quite distinct, showing a somewhat introspective, atmospheric voice. Her only published piano composition, the Gaelic Phantasy (1939), plays with elements of Irish traditional music in an original manner. For the print with An G√∫m (Irish government publisher) she was forced to smooth out some chromatic harmonies that she had originally intended.Coghill in a 1994 interview with German musicologist Axel Klein, unpublished.

Raised in July 1940 in South Australia as part of the 24th Brigade, the battalion was initially part of the 8th Division, until the 24th Brigade was re-allocated to the 9th Division in late 1940. It was with this formation that the 2/43rd saw service in the Middle East in 1941‚Äì1942, taking part in the fighting at Tobruk and in the First and Second Battles of El Alamein. It also undertook garrison duties in Syria, before returning to Australia early in 1943 to fight against the Japanese in the Pacific. In 1943‚Äì1944, after re-organisation and training to prepare for jungle warfare, the 2/43rd fought in New Guinea, as part of operations to capture Lae and secure the Huon Peninsula. After returning to Australia in early 1944, a long period of training followed on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland, before the battalion undertook its final campaign of the war, taking part in Allied operations to re-take Borneo from the Japanese in June 1945. Following the end of the war, the battalion was disbanded in February 1946. One member of the battalion, Private Tom Starcevich, was awarded the Victoria Cross. History =Formation and training= The 2/43rd Battalion was raised at Woodside, South Australia, on 17 July 1940 from Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) volunteers. It was one of three infantry battalions assigned to the 24th Brigade ‚Äì the other two being the 2/25th and 2/28th Battalions ‚Äì which was initially assigned to the 8th Division. Like other Australian infantry battalions of the time, the 2/43rd had an authorised strength of around 900 personnel, and was organised into four rifle companies ‚Äì designated 'A' through to 'D' ‚Äì each consisting of three platoons; these were supported by a battalion headquarters and a headquarters company with six specialist platoons: signals, pioneer, anti- aircraft, transport, carriers and mortars. Upon formation, the 2/15th was placed under the command of Lieutenant Colonel William Crellin, an Australian Staff Corps officer and Duntroon graduate of the Permanent Military Forces who arrived on promotion from major, having previously served in World War I with the 14th Battalion. The colours initially chosen for the battalion's unit colour patch (UCP) were chocolate and dark blue in an oval shape, inside a circle of grey. These were the same as those of the 43rd Battalion, a South Australian unit that was part of the First Australian Imperial Force during World War I. That unit had been re-raised in South Australia in 1921 as a Militia formation, eventually adopting the designation of the Hindmarsh Regiment. The 2/43rd's unit colour patch was later changed, following the unit's involvement in the fighting at Tobruk, when it adopted a 'T'-shaped UCP consisting of red and white. The battalion's personnel during the early stages of its existence were volunteers who enlisted within the 4th Military District, which encompassed South Australia and Broken Hill, New South Wales. Many of the commissioned officers and some of the non-commissioned officers had previous military experience in the Militia, while the bulk of the enlisted personnel had no prior military service. Rudimentary individual soldier training was conducted along with sports meets throughout August, followed by skill-at-arms training and range shoots in September, while key appointment holders were sent away on various promotion and other specialist training courses. In early October, the battalion was presented with its battle flag by veterans who had served in the 43rd Battalion during World War I, and a short time later it was announced that the 24th Brigade would be transferred to join the 9th Division in the Middle East. More intense training, including company and battalion-level field training was conducted in the weeks that followed. In late November, the 2/43rd received their Unit colour patches in preparation for deployment and the battalion marched through the centre of Adelaide. Finally, on 28 December 1940, the men entrained at Oakbank, and were transported by rail to Melbourne, where they embarked on the transport Mauretania. =North Africa and the Middle East= Escorted by the cruiser HMAS Canberra, the Mauretania proceeded along the southern Australian coast as part of a convoy of four other troopships. Reaching Fremantle, Western Australia, on 3 January 1941, a brief shore leave was granted before the convoy set sail across the Indian Ocean. From there, the convoy berthed at Colombo in Ceylon, where further shore leave was granted while arrangements were made to transfer the battalion to another ship, the Nevasa, for the remainder of the journey to Port Tewfik in Egypt, where it disembarked on 2 February 1941. From there, the battalion moved by rail to Palestine, where the 9th Division was attempting to make good its equipment and training deficiencies while the more experienced divisions ‚Äì the 6th and 7th Divisions ‚Äì led the Australian Army's efforts in Libya and later Greece. The 2/43rd subsequently moved into camp at Khasa, linking up with another South Australian battalion, the 2/27th, which had prepared the camp for their arrival. alt=A tracked military vehicle moves across the desert In early February, acclimatisation training was conducted until the battalion's heavy equipment arrived in camp, including Bren carriers and trucks, when section level and platoon tactical training began. This increased in complexity and progressed to company-level exercises, culminating in battalion offensive manoeuvres. Leave was granted for the soldiers to visit Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. This ceased mid-March, when the battalion was ordered to cross the Suez Canal and take up positions west of the port of Tobruk to complete training prior to relieving the 6th Division in the desert. As British troops advanced west, pushing the Italians back through Libya during Operation Compass, plans were made for the 9th Division to move forward. In the end, only part of the division advanced past Tobruk and, due to lack of transport, the 24th Brigade garrisoned the port itself. In early April the advance turned into a withdrawal as Axis forces, bolstered by the arrival of the Afrika Korps, which had landed around Tripoli, launched a determined counter-attack. The 9th Division, along with the Australian 18th Brigade, from the 7th Division, withdrew intact to Tobruk, and within a week the advancing Axis forces had placed the strategic port under siege. The 2/43rd would remain there, manning defences, mounting patrols and conducting raids, for the next six months. The battalion's most significant action around Tobruk came on 3 August, when 'A' and 'B' Companies attacked a German outpost on the right flank of the \\"Salient\\", designated \\"R7\\" by the Allied operational staff. The attack was part of an attempt to reduce the German-held Salient, which had developed in the line south-west of Bianca. In conjunction with the 2/43rd's attack, the 2/28th Battalion attacked the left flank around posts \\"S6\\" and \\"S7\\" from the north. Heavy fighting around R7 resulted in 100 Australian casualties, the majority being borne by 'B' Company, and the fighting ended in the Australian assault being repulsed followed by a temporary truce for both sides to collect casualties. During the truce, German sappers led the Australian stretcher bearers through the German-laid minefields. Finally, in October, the decision was made to withdraw the Australian garrison from Tobruk by sea. By this time, the 2/43rd was holding the Bardia Road sector, and after two successful raids on Italian positions, which resulted in around 75 Italian casualties, the battalion was withdrawn. As part of the evacuation, the 2/43rd was taken aboard the Australian destroyer HMAS Nizam and the Royal Navy's HMS Latona on 17 October 1941. The Australians were replaced by British troops from the 70th Division, with the 2/43rd handing over to troops from the Durham Light Infantry. Casualties for the battalion during the siege of Tobruk amounted to 38 killed in action, 13 died of wounds, 156 wounded, and four captured. Following its evacuation from Tobruk, the 2/43rd was landed in Alexandria, after which it moved by buses to Amiriya and then by train, crossing the Suez at Kantara, and arriving in camp at Kilo 89 in Palestine on 20 October. There, the battalion was rested, and received several drafts of reinforcements, mainly consisting of volunteers from Western Australia. In mid-December, after the battalion had moved to Khassa, Crellin handed over command of the battalion to Lieutenant Colonel William Wain, a former Militia officer who had served with the 7th Battalion during World War I, and who came on promotion from the 2/16th Battalion, where he had served as battalion second-in-command. After a bitterly cold Christmas in Palestine, early in the new year, the 9th Division was ordered to move to Syria, where it was to join the Allied garrison that had been established there following the brief Syria‚ÄìLebanon campaign to counter a possible Axis attack on the Allied flank through the Caucasus Mountains. The 9th Division was assigned to guard the Tripoli area, in the northern sector of the Allied defence system. Under this plan, the 2/43rd was assigned winter quarters at Arbe, and it spent four months in the Lebanese mountains near Jebel Tourbol, before moving to Bechmezzine in May. Guard duties included manning checkpoints at the mouth of the Chekka Tunnel, while brigade-level exercises were conducted in the Syrian desert around Forgloss in early June. At the end of the month, the 9th Division received orders to move back to Egypt as the situation in North Africa became critical for the Allies, as the Afrika Korps advancing steadily in the Western Desert. alt=Soldiers loading a mortar tube in a desert position Committed to the fighting around El Alamein in early July, the 24th Brigade, having recently completed desert training, moved to Ruweisat Ridge, over south of El Alamein, situated on the coast. For the next four months, the 2/43rd formed part of the northern sector of Allied defences within what came to be known as the \\"Alamein box\\". Tasked with harassing Axis forces, the 2/43rd's first action came on the night of 7/8 July, when 'D' Company launched a very successful raid, which caught the German forces in the area by surprise and resulted in the destruction of many vehicles and artillery pieces, as well as the re- capture of a British Bren carrier that was driven away from German lines. On 17 July, the 2/43rd was involved in actions around Ruin Ridge, in conjunction with the 2/32nd Battalion's attack on a position known as Trig 22 on Makh Khad Ridge. Advancing astride the Qattara track, during the action the 2/43rd captured over 1,000 Italian prisoners, for the loss of 81 casualties, before withdrawing from Ruin Ridge. The 24th Brigade launched a follow-up attack on 22 July on Makh Khad Ridge and Ruin Ridge, in conjunction with an attack by the 26th Brigade on Tel Eisa; this attack saw the 2/43rd, having detached one company to support the 2/32nd, heavily committed once again. A further thrust was put in on 26/27 July, with the 2/43rd being tasked with a follow-up role, which was cancelled after attacks by the 2/28th and the British 69th Infantry Brigade failed; instead the battalion only played a supporting role during the attack, bringing up ammunition under fire with its carriers, and providing supporting fire to the 2/28th Battalion. In August and September, during a lull in the fighting, the battalion undertook patrols into no-man's land. Casualties during the first phase of the battalion's involvement in the fighting around El Alamein between early July and mid-October amounted to 36 killed in action, 12 died of wounds, two accidentally killed, 28 wounded and four captured. Later, after the British forces were reinforced, the Allies launched a counter-offensive, the Second Battle of El Alamein, in late October and early November. During the initial phase of the fighting, the 9th Division was tasked with drawing Axis forces into the northern sector, to allow other elements to prepare for the breakout attempt, codenamed Operation Supercharge. The 2/43rd Battalion formed part of the divisional reserve during the initial stages of the attack, before the 24th Brigade relieved the depleted 26th Brigade, adopting positions around the railway barracks (dubbed the \\"Blockhouse\\") on 31 October. The fighting was so intense that it suffered 108 casualties in a single night on 1 November 1942, including 43 killed and seven missing, after being partially overrun. By early November, the tide of the fighting turned and the offensive ultimately wrested control of the fighting in North Africa back towards the Allies. Shortly afterwards the 9th Division was withdrawn from battle for redeployment to the Pacific to fight against the Japanese. The battalion's casualties in the second phase, between 23 October to 5 November 1942, amounted to 45 killed in action, 11 died of wounds, 96 wounded and 27 captured. Those captured ultimately spent the rest of the war in camps in Italy, Austria and Germany, before being repatriated at war's end. =New Guinea and Borneo= The 2/43rd was withdrawn to Khassa in Palestine in December and took part in a divisional parade that month in Gaza, before embarking aboard the Queen Mary, bound for Australia, in January 1943. The Queen Mary formed part of a large convoy established under Operation Pamphlet to transport the 9th Division back to Australia to fight the Japanese in the Pacific. After around a month at sea, the division arrived at Fremantle on 18 February and, after the Western Australian members disembarked, it continued eastwards, reaching Sydney on 27 February. From there, the battalion entrained from Pyrmont, and by 1 March 1943 had arrived in Adelaide, after which members were granted three weeks leave. A welcome-home parade through the city streets was held that month, watched by a crowd of over 200,000, after which the battalion concentrated at Springbank in Adelaide. They entrained for the Atherton Tablelands on 29 March 1943, reaching Kairi, on 6 April 1943. They would remain there for the next four months, training in preparation for jungle warfare against the Japanese in New Guinea. During this time, the battalion was converted to the jungle divisional establishment, which saw the reduction of its authorised strength to about 800 personnel. The number of vehicles allocated to the battalion was also reduced with heavy vehicles being replaced by jeeps. The carrier and anti-aircraft platoons were removed from the battalion's establishment, while a Vickers machine-gun platoon was raised and the number of mortars allocated for organic indirect fire support was increased. A batch of 338 reinforcements arrived to make up for earlier losses and transfers; many of these men came from states other than South Australia, resulting in a more diverse demographic within the battalion. alt=Soldiers at a wharf prepare to embark for overseas Training teams arrived from the 2/3rd Battalion, which had already fought the Japanese in New Guinea, and a program of jungle warfare training began, progressing from individual fieldcraft to large-scale exercises. In June, amphibious training was carried with the Australians working with the US 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment around Trinity Beach. The following month, a new commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Joshua, arrived. In early August, the battalion moved by road to Cairns. On 8 August 1943, the 2/43rd embarked upon HMAS Manoora, bound for Milne Bay in New Guinea. There, the battalion undertook further training in preparation for its debut in the Pacific. In mid-August, it moved by landing craft to Buna. It continued training there until 5 September, when the 24th Brigade embarked in landing craft for beaches near Lae, arriving the day after the main landing as part of follow-on forces behind the 20th and 26th Brigades. For 11 days, the battalion advanced west as part of a two-pronged advance on Lae, the 7th Division advancing overland from Nadzab while the 9th Division moved along the coast. Initially, there was only limited opposition from the Japanese as the battalion advanced through the villages of Buso and Apo, and the Singaua Plantation. The Burep River was crossed, but the Australian advance west was slowed by numerous water obstacles and eventually torrential rain which flooded the Busu River. At this point, Japanese resistance stiffened and after the 24th Brigade forced its way across the Busu, the 2/43rd advanced slowly along the coast, reaching Wagan to the south of Malahang airfield. On 16 September, the 7th Division entered Lae, with the 2/43rd situated around the Butibum River. The advance on Lae cost the battalion 18 killed and 25 wounded. Later in September, the Australians undertook an opposed amphibious landing at Scarlet Beach, on the Huon Peninsula. The 20th Brigade led the 9th Division ashore on 22 September, and the 2/43rd Battalion arrived on 30 September as part of reinforcements that were sent when it became clear that the Japanese in the area were stronger than first believed. As Japanese opposition to the lodgement increased, the 2/43rd relieved the beleaguered 2/17th around Jivevaneng, east of Sattelberg. While the 2/17th joined the Australian advance south, the 2/43rd established a blocking position around Jivevaneng to guard the western flank and in early October fought off a strong attack by a battalion from the Japanese 80th Infantry Regiment amidst a strong Japanese counterattack around the Finschhafen area. Later, the battalion pushed north of Scarlet Beach over the Song River to reconnoitre the area around North Hill, Pino Hill and Pabu in preparation for an advance towards Bonga and Guisika, during which it located several key tracks and junctions. In late November, it fended off an attack around North Hill before taking part in the advance towards Wareo, relieving the 2/32nd around Pabu, during which Japanese artillery and mortar attacks caused heavy casualties. The battalion then advanced towards the Kalueng Lakes and later into the Christmas Hills, severing the Bonga‚ÄìWareo track, which the Japanese had been using for resupply. In one ambush, 37 Japanese were killed around a position the Australians called \\"Horace the Horse\\". By early December, having suffered many casualties from disease, the battalion returned to the North Hill area to assume defensive positions, and a lull followed before it was withdrawn back to Finschhafen for Christmas. On 23 January 1944, the 2/43rd embarked upon the Thomas B. Corwin, reaching Townsville on 31 January. Casualties during operations around Finschhafen resulted in 56 killed and 86 wounded. alt=Soldiers advance along a road beside a tank After its return to Australia, the battalion was granted a 24-day leave period before re-grouping in March at Ravenshoe, Queensland, to begin preparations for the next phase of the war. The battalion experienced a high turnover of personnel, and by the time it went into combat again in mid-1945, only 141 personnel who had deployed to the Middle East in 1940 remained. A new commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Noel Simpson, arrived in May 1944, along with a large batch of other reinforcements, replacing many men still suffering malaria from the previous campaign. A long training period ensued, as there was a degree of uncertainty about the Australian Army's role in future operations in the Pacific after the US military assumed primary responsibility for combat operations in the theatre. Nevertheless, in the final months of the war the 2/43rd took part in efforts to recapture Labuan and North Borneo as part of Operation Oboe Six. Embarking in April 1945 on board the General H.W. Butner from Townsville, the 2/43rd staged out of Morotai Island. Now under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Mervyn Jeanes, who had taken over from Simpson following his elevation to command the 29th Brigade on Bougainville, the 2/43rd spent six weeks on Morotai Island preparing for the Labuan operation. Finally, in June, the battalion embarked on the Manoora and two US Landing Ship Tank vessels, LST 640 and LST 585, and made the seven-day voyage to the island of Labuan, where it came ashore unopposed in three waves, landing on Brown Beach on the southern tip of the eastern headland to Victoria Harbour. Supported by tanks and artillery, the 2/43rd pushed inland and, after some brief skirmishes, advanced along the southern coast on the right of the 2/28th Battalion, and then north to secure Labuan airfield, which was taken by the end of the first day for the loss of four casualties. The battalion then cleared the eastern coast towards the Kerupang River and exploited west across on the island along the axis of Hamilton Road towards Timbalai airfield. Mopping up as they went, the troops fought several actions as Japanese opposition stiffened around MacArthur's Road, while mines and booby traps also caused several casualties. The battalion's total losses during the 11-day campaign amounted to one killed and 12 wounded. By 17 June, Allied planes began operating from Labuan airfield and the 2/43rd Battalion was transferred across Brunei Bay to the mainland, landing at Menumbok and Mempakul, after an amphibious reconnaissance, along with the 2/11th Commando Squadron. Two companies and the battalion headquarters landed at Mempakul on 19 June, and the 2/43rd subsequently advanced up the Klias River, using barges and landing craft, while the 2/32nd Battalion advanced along the Padas River. By late June, the two battalions converged on Beaufort, linking up to the west of Kandu, and between 26 and 29 June 1945, the town was the scene of heavy fighting during which the 2/43rd lost 13 men killed and 30 wounded. The 2/43rd was tasked with taking the high ground to the north of the town around the Woodford Estate and Mount Lawley, and carrying out a flanking attack to the east. For his actions in destroying four Japanese machine-gun positions, Private Tom Starcevich was awarded the Victoria Cross. After the capture of Beaufort, the fighting continued in the area as the 2/28th Battalion kept up the pressure on the withdrawing Japanese; for the 2/43rd, though, Beaufort proved to be the last significant action of the war, as hostilities ended in mid-August, following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The battalion's final campaign of the war cost it 56 casualties, including those killed or wounded on Labuan. =Disbandment= Following the conclusion of hostilities, the 2/43rd Battalion remained on Borneo, around Beaufort, processing Japanese prisoners of war, conducting civic engagement programs, and undertaking vocational education courses in preparation for discharge. The demobilisation process began with personnel being prioritised based on length of service and other factors. A number of drafts were repatriated to Australia over several months. Just before Christmas, the remnants of the battalion, now down to a strength of about 250 personnel, moved to Mempakul, where they relieved the 2/15th Battalion. In January 1946, the battalion's remaining cadre returned to Australia aboard the motor vessel Reynella, reaching Brisbane on 17 January 1946. At Chermside, the battalion's equipment and weapons were accounted for, before the unit was disbanded on 20 February 1946 at Puckapunyal, Victoria. During the conflict a total of 2,711 men served with the battalion. Its casualties amounted to 186 killed in action, 57 died from wounds, 12 died from other causes, 556 wounded, and 36 captured. Decorations awarded included one Victoria Cross, two Distinguished Service Orders, 13 Military Crosses, three Distinguished Conduct Medals, 24 Military Medals including one Bar, one British Empire Medal, and 45 Mentions in Despatches. In addition, one member of the battalion was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire. Battle honours The 2/43rd received the following battle honours: * Beaufort, Borneo, Busu River, Defence of Alamein Line, Defence of Scarlet Beach, Defence of Tobruk, El Alamein, Finschhafen, Labuan, Pabu, and Tell el Makh Khad. These honours were subsequently entrusted to the 43rd Battalion in 1961. This unit was re-raised in 1966 as a national service battalion, and through this link the honours are maintained by the Royal South Australia Regiment.
