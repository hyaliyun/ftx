Throughout the instruction period, the murƒ´d typically experiences visions and dreams during personal spiritual exercises. These visions are interpreted by the murshid. A common practice among the early Sufi orders, was to grant a khirqa or a robe to the murƒ´d upon the initiation or after he had progressed through a series of increasingly difficult and significant tasks on the path of mystical development.

Exner originally intended on becoming a history painter, but quickly found his niche, however, in genre painting, the most popular and lucrative painting style of his era. His genre paintings figured prominently in Denmark's National Romantic period, an artistic period directly after the Golden Age of Danish Painting, when artistic focus was turned inwards to uniquely Danish themes.  Life  = Artistic training and early career = The younger Exner was interested in drawing and painting from an early age and was put in private training after his confirmation. He began to study at the Royal Danish Academy of Art (Det Kongelige Danske Kunstakademi) April 1839, where he intended on becoming a history painter. He caught the attention of Professor J. L. Lund, from whom he learned history painting. He studied later on with Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg, closely linked to the Golden Age of Danish Painting and commonly referred to as the Father of Danish Painting. From the Art Academy's Plaster Cast Collection (1843) In 1844 he exhibited his first painting \\"Fra Kunstakademiets figursal\\" (\\"From the Art Academy's Plaster Cast Collection\\") painted in 1843; the painting depicts a student sketching a plaster cast of a statue in the Academy's plaster cast collection, another student in the background moves between the figures. He won the Academy's little silver medallion in 1843, and the large silver medallion in 1845. In these early years he exhibited several history paintings as well a number of portraits. One of these portraits, a portrait of his sister, won him the Academy's Neuhausens prize (Neuhausens pr√¶mie) in 1847. In 1849 one of his history paintings, \\"Thyra Danebod fors√∏ger at formilde Gorm den Gamles vrede mod nogle fangne kristne\\" (\\"Thyra Danebod Tries to Placate Gorm the Elder's Anger with Imprisoned Christians\\"), was purchased by the Danish Royal Painting Collection, now the Danish National Gallery (Statens Museum for Kunst). Another painting from 1851, \\"Marsk Stigs D√∏tre\\" (\\"Marsk Stig's Daughters\\"), was commissioned by Count Frederik Christian Julius Knuth to hang at Knuthenborg Palace. The Count was generous with Exner, not only paying him well but providing him with a studio for several years. Both of these painting depict an ancient Danish history and legend. = Painting the folk life on Amager = But even Exner admitted to having an irrational \\"emotional desire to become a history painter\\" (\\"usalige lyst til at blive historiemaler\\"). Niels Lauritz H√∏yen, critic, Academy professor and advocate of a national art movement, helped influence Exner's future artistic direction, and Exner began seeking out the unique Danish folktypes living in the county as artistic subjects. This brought him to Amager, an island south of Copenhagen, where Dutch farmers had settled in 1521, but who were still relatively unknown to their fellow Danes. There he painted his masterly, life-size \\"En Amagerkone, der t√¶ller sine Penge efter\\" (\\"A Woman from Amager Counting Her Money\\"), which was exhibited in 1852, and was purchased by the National Collection. He was not only influenced by the national art movement promoted by H√∏yen, but also by the strong sense of patriotism during those times after the Napoleonic Wars, and by the general use of particularly \\"Danish\\" themes in not only the visual arts, but also in literature and theatre. These themes focused on the folktypes in various areas of Denmark, especially those living in the country and on the farm. In the visual arts a generation of art√≠sts had been already exploring such themes as typical Danish landscapes, and the depiction of Danish and Nordic themes, mythological stories and history. Many of the artists in the preceding generation were students of Eckersberg, and comprised the group of artists collectively known as the Golden Age of Danish Painting artists. They had been affected by Eckersberg's stress on attentive study and representation of Danish nature, as well as by the technical skills he taught them to achieve those goals. A follow up painting to his first Amager painting was \\"Et Bes√∏g hos Bedstefaderen\\" (\\"A Visit to Grandfather's House\\") painted in 1853, which assured him a successful career with its wide popularity and many reproductions. He won a Thorvaldsens exhibition medallion for the work, and the painting was purchased for the National Collection. He painted a number of painting on Amager over a period of years, and his skills grew as he depicted a combination of artistic challenges: increasingly complicated groups of people, a view out to the open land, colorful folk costumes, and the interiors of old farmer homes. These paintings attracted an interested public, who was fascinated by this close-up look at the exotic foreigners living in Denmark side-by-side with them. It was a chance to come into the home of strangers and see their everyday life. Exner was skilled and portrayed his subjects with affection, interest and gentle humour. He often traveled to the countryside during the summers to do live studies from nature, as was common practice in these times, working up finished paintings in the studio during the winter. And he also began seeking out themes in other locations on Sj√¶lland.as well, which resulted in \\"Et Bondegilde i Hedeboegnen\\" (\\"A Party on the Farm in the Hedebo Area\\") painted in 1856, as well as others of the same ilk. One of his paintings \\"Lille pige lader en gammel mand lugte til en blomst\\" (\\"A Little Girl Lets an Old Man Smell a Flower\\") painted in 1856, proved to be the start of Heinrich Hirschsprung's collection (the museum now known as the Hirschsprung Collection in Copenhagen), when he purchased it in 1866. = Travels = He received a two-year travel stipend from the Academy (1857‚Äì1858) for a student travel to Italy, which took him also to Dresden, Vienna, Switzerland and Paris, in addition to the Italian cities of Venice, Parma, Florence, Naples and Rome. He occasionally painted depictions of Italy, including his well-known \\"En gondol\\" (\\"A Gondola\\") from 1859, a view looking out from the dark interior of a covered gondola. A young woman at the left- hand side of the canvas peers out from the dark; a gondolier on the right-hand side of the central archway leans in towards the center of the painting, bathed in light. Beyond is a glimpse of the waterway and other boats. He illustrated poet Christian Winther's \\"Billeder og Vers\\" (\\"Pictures and Verses\\") in 1862. He married Inger Henriette Sophie Jensine Ringsted on 15 June 1863. He traveled to Sweden several times between 1863‚Äì1864, and on his travels in Denmark he reached Jutland's northernmost point-- Skagen‚Äîin 1867, the fishing village that, a generation later, would play host to the group of artists known as the Skagen Painters. = A member of the Academy = In 1864 he became a member of the Academy in Denmark, and in 1866 the Academy in Stockholm, Sweden. He painted another famous painting of Amager folk, the cheerful \\"Blindebuk\\" (\\"Blind Man's Bluff\\") depicting a farmhouse interior with children at play, in 1866. In an age where industrialisation was fast encroaching on traditional farmlife, Exner depicted a timeless vision of several generations of farm folk, gathered around in their idealised and cheerful house, self-sufficient and happy. A later generation of artists would rebel against this idealisation with their realistic depictions of want and need among the same types of people. He also painted portraits of the day's prosperous and prominent, such as Jenny Adler, wife of businessman, banker and politician David Baruch Adler, with her daughters in 1868, and the elderly poet \\"Christian Winther paa Spaseretur\\" (\\"Christian Winther on a Walking Tour\\") in 1869. He was named Professor at the Danish Academy in 1876 after having been an assistant professor in the School of Model Painting since 1872. = His later years = Julius Exner, Self-Portrait, the Artist‚Äôs Last Work, 1910, Loeb Danish Art Collection Starting in the late 1870s Exner began painting themes from Fan√∏, a Danish island in the North Sea off the west coast of Jutland, the Danish mainland. He came to the island for the first time in 1877. He and his family spent the summers there annually for many years to come. He had a studio at S√∏nderho Kro. There he found a group of people whose lives interested him deeply, a folk who were fast becoming extinguished in the social changes of that time. These themes made excellent subjects for his painting until his death. His work was exhibited at the world exhibition in Paris in 1878. He received a Treschow award in 1887. He became a member of the Exhibition Committee at Charlottenborg in 1879, and was named head of the committee in 1890. He served in this capacity five years. He was a member of the School Council (Skoler√•det) between 1883‚Äì1905, was Treasurer from 1884, and member of the Academy Council (Akademir√•det) from 1887. He painted several self-portraits in his final years, one in 1906 and one in 1910. He died on 15 November 1910 in Copenhagen two weeks shy of his 85th birthday. He is buried in Holmen's Cemetery in central Copenhagen. He exhibited at the Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition annually from 1844 until his death in 1910, with few exceptions.  Works  His works were exhibited at the Nordic Art Exhibition in Copenhagen (1872, 1883, 1888) and in Gothenburg, Sweden in 1881, at the first International Art Exhibition in Vienna, Austria in 1882 and at the International Art Exhibition in Berlin in 1891. His work has been shown posthumously both in Denmark and internationally in numerous exhibitions of Danish art, including an exhibition in Paris in 1928. His works are in the collection of many Danish museums including the National Art Museum (Statens Museum for Kunst), the Hirschsprung Collection, and local art museums in Aarhus, Randers, Ribe, Amager, northern Jutland, Frederiksborg CountyFrederiksborg and Funen. Exner was a master of composition setting up a lively combination of characters, costumes, and interiors, along with an underlying anecdote, that showed an inspiration of Dutch and German paintings. He was interested in the people he portrayed. He idealised their lives, and his work led to the rebellion known as realism. Other Danish genre painters of his generation were Christen Dalsgaard and Frederik Vermehren. They all depicted Danish country folk.

Its name refers to the Chaldea, whose inhabitants during the medieval era were reputed to have mysterious and magical knowledge. It can be found in a complete version, together with other non-Latin alphabets, in a manuscript from the year 1428, now in the library at the University of Munich (Cod. 4¬∫ 810, fol. 41v). However, its origins lie clearly in an earlier time, as some examples of its practical use demonstrate. The decipherment of the epitaph accompanying the cenotaph, or symbolic tomb, of Duke Rudolph IV in the Stephansdom in Vienna. The Alphabetum Kaldeorum was meant primarily for the encipherment of diplomatic correspondence; its alphabet implies that predominantly Latin texts were coded: u and v are equated; w was to be written as double v; j is missing. For frequently arising letters the Alphabetum Kaldeorum provides several different versions, which were used at random so that a decipherment attempt using the classical frequency analysis method should fail. \\"Nulla\\", cipher-letters with no plaintext assignment which were to be ignored, were also often added to the enciphered texts to further render frequency-analysis useless. A possible author of the Alphabetum Kaldeorum is Duke Rudolf IV of Austria (1339‚Äì1365), who attributed an Indian origin to them; the letters of the Alphabetum Kaldeorum are probably not, however, at all related to any writing common in India, and are actually independent creations. Even Rudolf's gravestone in the Stephansdom in Vienna carries an inscription enciphered using the Alphabetum Kaldeorum, which gives the names and titles of the duke.

History William Jones was laid down on 2 October 1918, at San Francisco, California, by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation. She was launched on 9 April 1919, sponsored by Mrs. Ernest P. McRitchie, the wife of the assistant naval architect at Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, and was commissioned at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Vallejo, California, on 30 September 1920, with Lieutenant Commander C. E. Rosendahl in temporary command. Lt. Comdr. J. G. B. Gromer took command on 16 November. Initially assigned to Division 34, Squadron 12, Destroyer Force, Pacific Fleet, William Jones operated off the west coast on duty in connection with the Officers' Engineering School until October 1921, cruising as far north as Seattle, Washington and as far south as the waters off the Panama Canal Zone. Assigned to Destroyer Squadrons, Battle Fleet, early in 1922, the destroyer operated with this force over the next seven years. Her operations took the ship up and down the west coast from Puget Sound to the Panama Canal. She took part in fleet maneuvers, exercises in torpedo firing and gunnery, and battle practices. In March 1925, she joined the Fleet for Fleet Problem V during which she screened the Battle Fleet units off Baja California, as they carried out maneuvers designed to practice protective screening, seizing and occupying a lightly defended position, and fueling at sea. Later that summer, William Jones served as one of the ships plane-guarding for the PN-9 flying boat flight to Hawaii. None of the planes actually flew all the way to Hawaii due a variety of mishaps. One, PN-9 number 3, was forced down by a malfunctioning fuel line. William Jones located her and went to her assistance, later towing her into San Francisco harbor on 1 September. PN-9 number 1, flown by Commander John Rodgers, did eventually reach Hawaii after a remarkable voyage in which her enterprising crew stripped the fabric from one wing and used it to fabricate a sail which propelled the floating aircraft to Oahu. From 5 September to 15 September, William Jones participated in the Diamond Jubilee celebrations at San Francisco before resuming her operations and exercises off the west coast. She worked along the Pacific coast until 3 March and 4 March 1926, when she transited the Panama Canal to take part in maneuvers with the Fleet in the Atlantic Ocean. She visited a succession of east coast ports and returned to the west coast on 30 June, when she moored again at San Diego, California. William Jones conducted a reserve training cruise to Alaskan waters from 7 July to 21 July 1928, pausing at Ketchikan, Juneau, and Sitka. After the ship's return to San Diego, she participated in tactical exercises off Point Loma and, later, in joint Army-Navy maneuvers off Port Angeles, Washington, in July 1929. Fate Upon the conclusion of the joint exercises, the destroyer arrived at San Diego late in August 1929 and remained inactive there until decommissioned on 24 May 1930. In accordance with the London treaty for the limitation and reduction of naval armaments, the warship was struck from the Navy list on 13 August 1930 and sold for scrap on 25 February 1932.

Plate from De uitlandsche Kapellen Cramer assembled an extensive natural history collection that included seashells, petrifications, and insects of all orders. Many were colourful butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera), collected in countries where the Dutch had colonial or trading links, such as Surinam, Ceylon, Sierra Leone and the Dutch East Indies. Cramer decided to get a permanent record of his collection and so engaged the painter Gerrit Wartenaar to draw his specimens. He also arranged for Wartenaar to draw butterflies and moths belonging to other keen Lepidoptera collectors in the Netherlands. One of them was stadtholder-prince William V of Orange. Hans Willem Baron Rengers and Joan Raye, the son of the former governor in Surinam, were among the others.Hans Willem (baron) RENGERS VAN AYLA was born 1722 in 's-Gravenhage (Z.H.), NL.

As a result, De Uitlandsche Kapellen was published 1775‚Äì1782. It consisted of 33 parts, each one issued at intervals of three months to the subscribers, in four volumes. All of the drawings were accompanied by descriptions of the insects. Cramer died \\"of high fevers\\" in 1776 after eight issues (Vol. I) had been published, leaving responsibility for finishing the project to Van Rensselaar and Stoll.

His father Jared Bradley Flagg was an Episcopal priest and a notable painter.Flagg, Ernest. Genealogical Notes on the Founding of New England: My Ancestors Part in that Undertaking.

Professional career In 1891, Flagg began his architectural practice in New York, greatly influenced by his knowledge of the French ideas of architectural design, such as structural rationalism. During this time he joined with John Prentiss Benson to create Flagg & Benson, which later became Flagg, Benson & Brockway with the addition of Albert Leverett Brockway. FB&B; designed St. Luke's Hospital in New York City.Albert L Brockway In 1894, he established the architectural firm of Flagg & Chambers with Walter B. Chambers, whom he met in Paris. Usually Flagg alone is credited for some of the work he and Chambers worked on together, such as the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the U.S. Naval Academy, and Pomfret School in Connecticut which he saw as \\"part of the process of evolution that would contribute to the creation of a national style of architecture.‚Äù Louisa Flagg Scribner, Flagg's sister, was the wife of Charles Scribner II. Through this familial connection, Flagg designed six structures located in Manhattan for the publishing family. The Singer Building, once the tallest building in the world Flagg is probably best known for his design of the Singer Tower. Completed in 1908, it was then the tallest office building in the world, at 612 feet. Faithful to his Beaux-Arts training, Flagg allowed space around the tall building for light to enter, which was unusual for the time. Rufus Arndt Flagg System home, 1925 Though Flagg is best known for his large institutional designs, he was also interested in producing modest, attractive homes affordable to average Americans. He developed innovative techniques toward that end and in 1922 published the book Small Houses, Their Economic Design and Construction. He packaged these techniques and ideas into the Flagg System, and collaborated with builders scattered across the U.S. to build them. This document should display in Acrobat or the Edge browser, if you have trouble with other viewers. His contributions to zoning and height regulations were essential to New York's first laws governing this aspect of the city's architecture. Flagg argued in favor of zoning laws which would regulate the height and setback of buildings, to allow light and air to reach the streets below them.Fire Engine Co. 67 Landmarks Preservation Commission He was a president of the New York Society of Beaux-Arts Architects. A small collection of Flagg's personal and professional papers is held in the Department of Drawings & Archives at Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library at Columbia University. Flagg System Homes The homes that Flagg designed are modest, low to the ground, with stone walls, and often with steep roofs, distinctive ridge dormers, and round- capped chimneys. Their styles suggest Tudor Revival, Cotswold Cottage, or French Provincial to various extents. Flagg generally considered surface decoration \\"sham,\\" and preferred to suggest styles with the general form of the building, adding interest with chimneys and dormers. As mentioned above, Flagg aimed to make attractive homes affordable to average families, and he did this by the following means: * The houses are generally somewhat small in scale compared to their contemporaries. This cut costs and gives them an intimate cottage feel. * Flagg designed the homes on a \\"module system;\\" i.e., the floor plan was laid out on a grid where each square was 45 inches on a side. 45 inches was chosen to reduce waste and cutting of standard-length boards and sheets of glass. The same standard sizes were used for vertical dimensions. This grid allowed simplified designs, easy for the builder to follow, and standardized parts that could be produced in quantity for many houses. This was 25 years before the American Institute of Architects and the General Contractors Association settled on standardized sizes. * The exterior walls are concrete, faced with natural stone. The builder constructed wooden forms and laid natural stone inside, with its flat side against the outside of the form. Then concrete was poured behind the stone, 16 to 20 inches thick. After the forms were removed, the joints were finished from the outside. The result was a fire-proof, load-bearing wall. Cost was reduced by designing most of the walls low enough to be built without scaffolding, and with unskilled labor, or so Flagg claimed. The 1925 Bossert house is French Provincial- styled, with ridge dormers. * The houses typically have no full basement or full attic, both of which Flagg considered expensive useless space. The lack of basement helped keep the walls low, since they could start near ground level. Steep roofs reach down to the low walls, and inside these roofs Flagg tucked storage space and sometimes rooms. The spaces within the roof are lit by dormers, often including unusual ridge dormers. These dormers can be opened in summer for ventilation. The 1924 Barfield-Staples house displays Flagg's round-capped chimneys. * Many of the houses have distinctive round-capped stone chimneys on the end walls. * Instead of gutters and rainpipes, a cement walk ran around the house under the eaves, so run-off would splash and run away, instead of eroding the landscaping. * Inside, Flagg minimized hallways, considering them wasted space. * Interior walls were constructed by stretching a jute screen where wanted, then plastering both sides, making a fireproof, sound-dampening partition only 1.5 inches thick. This saved space and cost that would have otherwise been spent on studs, lath and plaster. * Ceiling beams were left exposed, both to save plastering costs and to add interest. * Inward-opening casement windows were used instead of sash windows. * Bathroom floors were raised eight inches above the concrete slab to allow for pipes, and standard fixtures were used to reduce cost. Flagg tested some of his designs for modest homes on his Staten Island estate, and many of these demonstration models are still in use. Afterwards, more were built around New York and across the U.S. Flagg worked with particular builders, training them on his system. The builder sent the clients' requirements to Flagg, he sent back plans, the builder and local inspectors adjusted the plans for local building codes, and the builder constructed the home. In the Milwaukee area over two dozen of these homes were built from 1924 to 1926, and they survive largely intact, now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Personal life Ernest Flagg married Margaret E. Bonnell on June 27, 1899 in New York City. They had one daughter, Margaret Elizabeth, who became a well- respected small-scale portrait painter and is known professionally as Betsy Flagg Melcher.Betsey Flagg Melcher Luce Foundation Center for American Art. In 1912, Mr. and Mrs. Ernest Flagg were on their way to a party held by Stowe Phelps, a fellow architect, when their limousine struck and killed a boy (James McNamara) who had suddenly skated in front of the car.

This legendary dynasty was said to be descended from moon-related deities (Soma or Chandra). The Hindu deity Krishna and some rulers of the Indian subcontinent are said to be of Chandravanshi background. According to the Shatapatha Brahmana, Pururavas was the son of Budha (himself often described as the son of Soma) and the gender-switching deity Ila (born as the daughter of Manu). Pururavas's great-grandson was Yayati, who had five sons named Yadu, Turvasu, Druhyu, Anu, and Puru. These seem to be the names of five Indo-Aryan tribes as described in the Vedas. According to the Mahabharata, the dynasty's progenitor Ila ruled from Prayag, and had a son Shashabindu who ruled in the country of Bahli. Ila's descendants were also known as the Ailas or Chandravansha.Encyclopaedia of the Hindu world, Volume 1 By Ga·πÖgƒÅ RƒÅm Garg  In Mahabharata  Family Tree In Hindu texts, the Kurukshetra war that form the subject of the Indian Epic Mahabarata, was largely fought between rival branches of the Lunar Dynasty, famously resulting in the hesitation of Arjuna away from war and the reprimand of his mentor Krishna. Krishna reminds Arjuna that Dharma stands above everything and the text forms an integral cultural cornerstone for all four Kshatriya houses. By the conclusion of the Kurukshetra war most of the Yadhuvanshi lineage is in peril. The sinking of Dwarka sees the destruction of the entire Yaduvanshi lineage with the exception of Vajranabh who was saved by Arjuna and later becomes the King of Mathura.

Note that all cards are dealt face up Fourteen Out (also known as Fourteen Off, Fourteen Puzzle, Take Fourteen, or just Fourteen) is a Patience card game played with a deck of 52 playing cards. As this game involves carrying off cards with a fixed sum, it belongs to the same family of games as Pyramid. The name refers to the goal of each turn to make pairs that add up to 14.\\"Take Fourteen\\" (p.80) in The Little Book of Solitaire, Running Press, 2002. Rules The cards are dealt face up into twelve columns, from left to right. The first four columns therefore receive an extra card. The exposed top cards of each column are available for play. As denoted by the game's name, the object is to discard pairs of cards that total fourteen. Jacks value eleven, queens twelve, and kings thirteen, all others (including the ace) at face value. So the combination of cards to be discarded are as follows: *King and Ace *Queen and 2 *Jack and 3 *10 and 4 *9 and 5 *8 and 6 *7 and 7 Once a card has been discarded, the card under it becomes available. The game is won when all cards are discarded. Strategy Strategy of Fourteen Out involves identifying pairs that cannot be matched because of their position, and preemptively selecting other eligible matches. Potential difficulties arise when pairs are found in the same pile, or when two different matches are in potentially mutually blocking positions. Variants Columns may be stacked rather than cascaded, thus obscuring not-yet-active cards. This results in considerably more blind play.

Valby (born November 22, 1944) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, comedian, and producer known for his comedic and obscene song parodies. Also known as Dr. Dirty, he typically performs in a white tailcoat suit and black derby hat. His songs and shows focus mainly on sex and racial slurs, with a mix of current and historic people and events. Early life Valby was born and raised in upstate New York. He attended school in Rochester, New York, where at age seven, was taught to play the piano by two nuns. At ten, Valby wanted to become a performer. In 1966, Valby graduated from Middlebury College in Middlebury, Vermont. He attended Duke University, and graduated with a degree in idealism. At one point he considered a profession as a philosophy teacher, but soon realized it was not right for him and focused on musical entertainment. Career Valby joined various rock bands in his early career that \\"kept on breaking up\\", which drove him to become a solo piano act of mostly rock and roll and honky tonk tunes. At one show in May 1974, he added some dirty songs of his own into the set. The positive response to the dirty songs led Valby to focus on the more adult material. He would often write new material while transporting between gigs. Valby claimed that he was named \\"Dr. Dirty\\" by the National Entertainment Conference, a booking organisation for the college circuit. He stated that he disliked the name because it \\"takes away from the element of surprise\\". He credited some of his obscene act as a reaction to the Catholic repression that he faced during childhood. In addition to his blue comedy act, Valby has recorded and produced pop and rock albums for himself and other artists, including Buffalo Sabres defenseman Jim Schoenfeld, with whom Valby recorded two albums, Schony (1972) and The Key is Love (1974). He also had a small role as a piano player in a Tijuana brothel in the 1983 film Losin' It which featured an early performance by Tom Cruise. Personal life Valby is married to his wife Anne; together they have six children. In August 2012 he lived in a house in Clarence, New York; that was burned due to suspected arson. As of 2016, he still lives in Clarence. Valby endorsed Donald Trump in the 2016 United States presidential election and recorded a song and music video supporting his campaign.John Valby sings \\"Everybody Hates Trump\\" at YouTube (April 18, 2016). (He would later backtrack on his endorsement, working a line into a 2018 song stating that Trump was \\"full of\\" excrement.)John Valby - \\"Give My Remains to Science\\" on YouTube (January 29, 2018).

Martin Scorsese said: \\"It is not possible even to begin to take the full measure of the greatness of British filmmaking without thinking of Chris Challis,\\" and: \\"Chris Challis brought a vibrancy to the celluloid palette that was entirely his own, and which helped make Britain a leader in that long, glorious period of classic world cinema.\\" Challis was also an accomplished and enthusiastic still photographer. He joined The Royal Photographic Society in 1936, gaining his Associateship in 1945 and Fellowship in 1948. He remained a member until his death.Information from The Royal Photographic Society / http://www.rps.org Publications His autobiography, Are They Really So Awful?: A Cameraman's Chronicle, was published by Janus Publishing Company () in March 1995.

At the closing date of the competition 42 designs had been submitted which was won by a project named Beta but the Titch was placed second. Taylor built the prototype, registered G-ATYO, at Leigh-on-Sea, Essex between 1965 and 1966. The Titch first flew at Southend Airport on 4 January 1967.Purdy 1998, p. 267. The designer John Taylor was killed when the prototype Titch crashed at Southend on 16 May 1967. The marketing of plans for both his aircraft designs were taken on by his wife and later his son.Dunnell Aeroplane June 2017, p. 129. , 40 examples had been completed and flown.Bayerl and Berkemeier 2011, p. 122. Design The Titch is a single-seat low-wing cantilever monoplane of all wood construction similar to the Monoplane but has fewer metal fittings than the earlier design and full size wing rib plans are supplied for the tapered wing panels. With a cruise speed in the region of 160 mph (260 km/h), it is an effective cross-country touring aircraft and is also fully aerobatic. Builders can fit it with either a Continental or a Lycoming engine. Specifications (Prototype) See also Notes References =Notes= =Bibliography= * Bayerl, Robby, Martin Berkemeier et al.

Debate The Science High School Debate Teams was established in 1979 by Brent Farrand and quickly became the model for urban debate programs nationally. By the early eighties, the Science HS Debate programs had nationally competitive teams. By the mid-eighties, the Science HS program boasted nationally ranked teams. The main difference between the Newark Science HS debate program and other nationally competitive programs was the make-up of the debate team. This was a team of students from all walks of life, economic backgrounds and ethnicity. The Newark Science HS Debate program seeded the idea that debate teams from the inner city could not only participate in debate, but they could dominate. Science High School debaters have been nationally ranked and routinely compete at the highest levels of high school debate. Mr. Farrand served as the debate coach and Algebra teacher for over 20 years at Science High.

He played in Major League Baseball from 1970 to 1979 for the Washington Senators, Texas Rangers, New York Mets and St. Louis Cardinals. He was Nicknamed \\"TAG\\", which are his initials. In 2010, Grieve was inducted into the Texas Rangers Hall of Fame. Biography =Baseball career= Grieve was drafted by the Washington Senators in the 1st round (6th pick) of the 1966 MLB June Amateur Draft from Pittsfield High School. Before signing with Washington in the summer of 1966, Grieve played in the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL) with the Chatham Red Sox. He hit .416 in 25 games, and in 2010 was inducted into the CCBL Hall of Fame. Grieve's best season was 1976 with the Rangers when he hit .255, belted 20 home runs and had 81 runs batted in. Grieve was dealt from the Rangers to the Mets in the first four-team blockbuster deal in Major League Baseball history on December 8, 1977 that also involved the Atlanta Braves, Pittsburgh Pirates and a total of eleven players changing teams. The Mets got from the Braves Willie Monta√±ez and also from the Rangers Ken Henderson who was sent to New York to complete the transaction three months later on March 15, 1978. The Rangers received Al Oliver and Nelson Norman from the Pirates and Jon Matlack from the Mets. Adrian Devine, Tommy Boggs and Eddie Miller were traded from the Rangers to the Braves.

In between, Grieve posted five solid seasons in the Venezuelan Winter League while playing for the √Åguilas del Zulia, Leones del Caracas and Tiburones de La Guaira clubs between 1971 and 1979. According to his own words, he says that any player who skips winter ball does themselves a disservice because they‚Äôre too lazy. =General Manager= After retiring as a player at the end of the 1979 season, Grieve joined the Rangers' front office, and did his first work as a color commentator for Rangers television broadcasts during the 1980 season. In 1984 Grieve became general manager of the Rangers, and served in that capacity until 1994. In December 1988 Grieve made one of the best trades in team history, acquiring Rafael Palmeiro and Jamie Moyer from the Chicago Cubs for Mitch Williams. That same winter he acquired future batting champion Julio Franco. However, he also traded away several future stars, including Sammy Sosa in 1989 and Robb Nen in 1993. Grieve (right) alongside former Rangers commentator Josh Lewin =Broadcasting career= Since 1995, Grieve has served as the color commentator for the Texas Rangers, which is the longest tenure of any TV broadcaster in Texas Rangers club history.

Early life  Cable was born in Aberdare on 19 May 1970. When he was 10, his father died. Thereafter, Cable and his elder brother, Paul, were raised by their mother Mabel (born 1930) on her own. Cable grew up in the close-knit village of Cwmaman near Aberdare, He attended Blaengwawr Comprehensive School with his friend, Stereophonics singer- songwriter and guitarist Kelly Jones, who also lived on the same street.  Career  =Stereophonics= Together with Kelly Jones' school friend Richard Jones, the trio began playing covers in working men's clubs from 1992, under the title Tragic Love Company. The band later changed their name to Stereophonics in 1996. He also played a number of notable gigs in his native Wales. Of particular note were the concert of 12 June 1998 at Cardiff Castle and the concert of 31 July 1999 at the Morfa Stadium in Swansea, the latter shortly before the stadium was demolished. Both concerts were filmed live and released on VHS and DVD. =Other bands= Cable also played for other bands, including as a vocalist for Rhondda band NailBombs. During 1992, they recorded the E.P. \\"Raw Sex for Breakfast\\" at Sound Space Studios in Cardiff, on which Cable sang lead vocals. After Cable fully committed to Stereophonics, he was replaced by ex-Rag Dolls frontman J.J.Cruz. He had been the temporary drummer for hard rock band Stone Gods, which was formed by former members of The Darkness, filling in for Ed Graham during 2008 who had left the band for health reasons. Most recently, Cable had been drumming in his new Welsh band, Killing for Company, who were the first band to play the new Liberty Stadium in Swansea, supporting The Who. =Media career= Cable with Alex Zane co- presenting the 2008 XFM Awards In 2002, Cable was given his own TV chat show, Cable TV, by BBC Wales. He was sacked by the rest of the band in September 2003, because it was claimed he was spending too much time on his new media career at the expense of rehearsals. After that, he had another television series of his own, Cable Connects (2005) and had his own radio show on BBC Radio Wales: Cable Rock. Cable was the spokesperson of a 2002 BBC Wales campaign (called BLLCKS) to raise awareness of testicular cancer. In 2005, Cable co-hosted the Kerrang! Awards, and he also presented two shows on Kerrang! 105.2: the 'Cable and Caroline Show' with Caroline Beavon on Sunday mornings and \\"The Rock 'n' Roll Years\\" on weekday mornings until 2010. In November 2007, he joined XFM South Wales and hosted weekend shows until the station was sold on 30 May 2008. After leaving Kerrang! Radio, in April 2010 Cable returned to BBC Radio Wales as the presenter of Saturday Night Cable, a show playing both old and new rock music. Cable interviewed Slash from Guns N' Roses as a presenter and was scheduled to interview his favourite band, AC/DC, on the weekend following his death, at the Download Festival (where his new band were also scheduled to play). Personal life Cable live with Killing for Company in May 2010 Cable owned a flat in Cardiff Bay, and partly lived in Abernant, before moving to the neighbouring village of Llwydcoed in a Tudor- style house. In 1999, he married Nicola in Bridgend. Their son, Cian Damen, was born in 2001 in Cardiff. In 2003, he had an affair with television presenter Lisa Rogers. Cable claims that it was differences between Rogers and Kelly Jones' partner Becka (Rebecca Walters) at the time which violently came to a head publicly at a restaurant in Paris, eventually leading to his dismissal after he made a sarcastic joke about the incident the following day. Around 2003, Cable and his wife divorced. In April 2009 he had spoken out about being sacked from Stereophonics and describes the moment they played in front of 80,000 people in Cardiff without him as \\"the darkest time of my entire life\\". He had said, \\"Until that point in my life, I had never ever considered something as stupid as suicide, but that night I could really understand why people get depressed enough to do it.\\" He patched up his differences with Kelly Jones in 2009 and at the time of his death they were in contact again. Cable released his autobiography in April 2009, entitled Demons and Cocktails ‚Äì My Life with the Stereophonics. In his autobiography, he stated that he had been a hard drinker and drug user, particularly whisky and cocaine. He claimed his close friend, Dirty Sanchez star Matthew Pritchard, enjoyed wild parties and drugs. Like former Stereophonics bandmate Richard Jones, he was also a motorcycle enthusiast. According to a neighbour, he was planning a motorcycle tour of Spain. Cable was outspoken about child safety and backed a campaign named 'Stuart's Campaign', established following the death of Cowbridge schoolboy Stuart Cunningham-Jones, who died aboard a school bus. He had said, \\"In this day and age every child should have the right to travel to and from school in absolute safety.\\" Death Cable was found dead at his home in Llwydcoed at 5:30 am on 7 June 2010, aged 40. On the evening of 5 June, Stereophonics played in Cardiff; Cable was said to have been presenting on the radio at the same time that Stereophonics were performing. The following day, he began drinking at Welsh Harp Inn in Trecynon. Cable walked home with friends, where he continued drinking and choked to death on his own vomit during his sleep. Cable is survived by one child, his brother and mother. Cable's funeral was held at St Elvan's Church in Aberdare on 21 June 2010. The cortege was attended by black horse-driven cabriolet. He was later cremated.

The group's activities prompted the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to bring a federal lawsuit, alleging a violation of the Voting Rights Act, illegal harassment, and voter intimidation. The RNC and New Jersey Republican State Committee entered into a consent decree in 1982, barring them from engaging in further such conduct until 2017. The RNC unsuccessfully tried to lift the consent decree early; these attempts were rejected by the federal courts each time. The consent decree was set to expire on December 1, 2017. Democrats sought an extension to it based on allegations of new conduct, but the request was denied in January 2018 and the decree expired. Overview The task force consisted of a group of armed, off-duty police officers wearing armbands, who were hired to patrol polling sites in African-American and Hispanic neighborhoods of Newark and Trenton. Initially, 45,000 letters were mailed (using an outdated voter registration list) to primarily Latino and African-American citizens. Many of these letters were later returned as non-deliverable, and the 45,000 addresses were used to create a list of voters. These voters were then challenged by the BSTF, a practice known as voter caging. In addition, the Republican National Committee filed a request for election supervisors to strike these voters from the rolls, but the commissioners of registration refused when they discovered that the RNC had used outdated information. On New Jersey's election day in 1981, the BSTF posted large signs, without identification but with an official appearance, reading Armed members of the Task Force \\"were drawn from the ranks of off-duty county deputy sheriffs and local police,\\" who \\"prominently displayed revolvers, two-way radios, and BSTF armbands.\\" BSTF patrols \\"challenged and questioned voters at the polls and blocked the way of some prospective voters\\" in predominantly African-American and Hispanic areas. Democrat James J. Florio lost the gubernatorial election to Republican Thomas H. Kean by 1,797 votes. 1982 lawsuit and consent decree A civil lawsuit was filed after the election by the DNC, which alleged that the RNC had violated the Voting Rights ActDavid G. Savage, Supreme Court denies RNC bid to end voter fraud consent decree, Los Angeles Times (January 14, 2013). and engaged in illegal harassment and voter intimidation. The suit was settled in 1982, when the Republican National Committee and New Jersey Republican State Committee, instead of a trial, signed a consent decree in U.S. District Court saying that they would not allow tactics that could intimidate Democratic voters, though they did not admit any wrongdoing. The consent decree, entered on November 1, 1982, prevented the Republican Party \\"from engaging in activities that suppress the vote, particularly when it comes to minority voters.\\" It also barred the wearing of armbands at polling places. Under the consent decree \\"the Republican party organizations agreed to allow a federal court to review proposed 'ballot security' programs, including any proposed voter caging.\\" The consent decree was set to expire in December 2017. A successor consent decree, applying to several states, was entered on July 27, 1987. Republican attempts to lift consent decree The Republican Party has attempted several times, unsuccessfully, to terminate the consent decree, arguing that it is \\"antiquated\\" and unnecessary. The Democratic National Committee had countered by arguing that \\"recent campaigns show the 'consent degree remains necessary today.'\\" In 2009, a New Jersey federal judge rejected the RNC's request to vacate the consent decree, and this ruling was unanimously affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in 2012.Democratic National Committee v. Republican National Committee, 673 F.3d 192 (3d Cir. 2012). The Supreme Court declined to hear the RNC's appeal in 2013. 2016 motion On October 26, 2016, the DNC filed a motion asking the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey to find that the RNC had violated the consent decree. The motion was filed after the campaign of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump suggested, without evidence, that the election was \\"rigged\\" in favor of his opponent Hillary Clinton and urged Trump supporters to watch the polls to combat supposed \\"voter fraud.\\" The DNC also sought to extend the duration of the consent decree. A shortened discovery occurred, and on November 5 the court denied the request. The court determined that the DNC did not present \\"sufficient evidence of coordination between the Trump campaign and the RNC on ballot-security operations\\" but did \\"allow the DNC to offer further evidence after the election.\\" Expiration of consent decree The consent decree restricting Republican Party conduct was set to expire on December 1, 2017, but Democrats sought an extension, alleging that statements from Donald Trump campaign officials showed the RNC had engaged in activities in violation of the decree. U.S. District Judge John Michael Vazquez allowed the Democratic Party to take the deposition of Sean Spicer before issuing a decision on whether the decree should be allowed to expire, but denied Democrats' motions for hearings on the issue. On January 8, Judge John Vasquez ruled that the decree had expired on December 1, and would not be extended. The 2020 presidential election will be the first presidential election since 1980 in which the Republican Party will be able to deploy \\"ballot security operations\\". In 2019 Justin R. Clark, an official in Trump's re-election campaign, was recorded telling Republican lawyers that the expiration of the consent decree was a \\"huge, huge, huge, huge deal\\" for the campaign's election day operations in Wisconsin. In March 2020 the RNC announced plans to mobilize 50,000 poll watchers to swing states, while Trump described plans to mobilise law enforcement as poll watchers, and the True the Vote group sought to recruit police officers and military veterans. The political scientist Kenneth Mayer of the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison argued in August 2020 that the lifting of the consent decree raised the prospect of a return to practices of voter intimidation, while Justin Levitt of Loyola Law School argued that the RNC was unlikely to have the capacity to mobilize such numbers. In October 2020 the Trump campaign said it had enlisted more than 50,000 volunteer poll watchers in swing states. In a September 2020 opinion column, Florio likened Trump's rhetoric to the use of voter intimidation in the 1981 campaign.

Gameplay Many locations are illustrated by an image, based on originals designed by Kent Rees. On the tape version, to save space, each image was stored in a compressed format by storing outline information and then flood filling the enclosed areas on the screen.\\"The Hobbit: Phil Garratt, after a brief sojourn in Middle Earth, takes time off to tell us what he found there\\" Garratt, Phil (1983) ZX Computing issue 8304, page 76 The slow CPU speed meant that it would take up to several seconds for each scene to draw. The disk-based versions of the game used pre- rendered, higher-quality images. The game has an innovative text-based physics system, developed by Veronika Megler. Objects, including the characters in the game, have a calculated size, weight, and solidity. Objects can be placed inside other objects, attached together with rope and damaged or broken. If the main character is sitting in a barrel and this barrel is then picked up and thrown through a trapdoor, the player would go through. Unlike other works of interactive fiction, the game is also in real time, insofar as a period of idleness causes the \\"WAIT\\" command to be automatically invoked and the possibility of events occurring as a result. This can be suppressed by entering the \\"PAUSE\\" command, which stops all events until a key is pressed. The game has a cast of non-player characters (NPCs) entirely independent of the player and bound to precisely the same game rules. They have loyalties, strengths, and personalities that affect their behaviour and cannot always be predicted. The character of Gandalf, for example, would roam freely around the game world (some fifty locations), picking up objects, getting into fights and being captured. The volatility of the characters, coupled with the rich physics and impossible-to-predict fighting system, enabled the game to be played in many different ways, though this would also lead to problems (such as an important character being killed early on). There are numerous possible solutions and with hindsight, the game might be regarded as one of the first examples of emergent gameplay. This also resulted, however, in many bugs; for example, during development Megler found that the animal NPCs killed each other before the player arrived. The game's documentation warned that \\"Due to the immense size and complexity of this game it is impossible to guarantee that it will ever be completely error-free\\". Melbourne House issued a version 1.1 with some fixes, but with another bug that resulted in the game being unwinnable, forcing it to release version 1.2, and the company never fixed all bugs. Reception Info in 1985 rated The Hobbit on the Commodore 64 three- plus stars out of five, stating that the graphics were \\"pleasant but no show- stoppers\\", and that the game's parser and puzzles were \\"typical of most adventures today\\". The magazine concluded that \\"Tolkien fans will most likely be pleased with this title\\". The Hobbit was a bestseller in the UK on the ZX Spectrum in 1983 and both the C64 and BBC the following year.\\"Chart Toppers\\", C&VG; issue 28, page 163, The game won the 1983 Golden Joystick Award for best strategy game.\\"The Golden Joystick Award\\", C&VG; issue 29, page 15 The game was also a huge commercial success, selling over 100,000 copies in its first two years at a retail price of ¬£14.95.Mike Gerrard: Adventuring into an Unknown World. In: The Guardian, 1984-08-30, section Micro Guardian/Futures, page 13. There are no records of sales figures but in an article from March 1985 it was estimated in the range of 100,000 to 200,000, C&VG; issue 41 and a figure of 500,000 copies is possible, making it an \\"excellent candidate for the bestselling text adventure of all time, challenged, if at all, only by Infocom‚Äôs Zork I\\". The use of images on many of the locations as opposed to mostly text-only adventure games of the time, the flexibility of the Inglish parser, the innovative independence of the non-player characters, the popularity of Tolkien's work, all attributed to the game's phenomenal success. Macworld reviewed the Macintosh versions of The Hobbit, The Fellowship of the Ring and The Shadows of Mordor simultaneously, criticizing The Hobbit, calling it \\"particularly clumsy\\" as it is \\"handicapped by a 400-word input vocabulary\\" as opposed to the latter two games' 800 words. Macworld calls The Fellowship of the Ring \\"particularly intricate\\" and recommends it as an entry point to the series as opposed to The Hobbit. Macworld praises The Hobbit's graphics, but states that in The Fellowship of the Ring and The Shadows of Mordor \\"the art adds little to the games' overall appeal.\\" Futhermore, Macworld heralds the three games as \\"literate and faithful in spirit to original books\\", but criticizes the dated and \\"rigid\\" nature of the text-adventure format. Legacy To help players a book called \\"A guide to playing The Hobbit\\" by David Elkan was published in 1984.David Elkan: A Guide to Playing the Hobbit. Melbourne House, 1984, Developer Beam Software followed up The Hobbit with 1985's Lord of the Rings: Game One, 1987's Shadows of Mordor: Game Two of Lord of the Rings, and 1989's The Crack of Doom. They would also reuse Inglish in \\"Sherlock\\". In 1986 a parody of the game was released by CRL, The Boggit. A phrase from the game which has entered popular culture is \\"Thorin sits down and starts singing about gold.\\" Also, the game is mentioned in Nick Montfort's, Twisty Little Passages, a book exploring the history and form of the interactive fiction genre. Discworld Noir references The Hobbit: when the protagonist, Lewton, discovers that someone concealed themselves in a wine barrel, he wonders why that brings to mind the phrases \\"You wait ‚Äì time passes\\" and \\"Thorin sits down and starts singing about gold.\\" References External links  *Tolkien computer games * *Interview of Veronika Megler about 'The Hobbit' development *Wilderland emulator which shows what's going on 'behind the scene' in the ZX Spectrum version Category:1982 video games Category:Amstrad CPC games Category:Apple II games Category:BBC Micro and Acorn Electron games Category:Commodore 64 games Category:Dragon 32 games Category:Dragons in video games Category:1980s interactive fiction Category:Video games based on Middle-earth Category:Mac OS games Category:MSX games Category:Oric games Category:The Hobbit Category:Video games developed in Australia Category:ZX Spectrum games ","title":"The Hobbit (1982 video game)"},{"id":"2149336","text":"Weigela Sunset Western Garden Book, 1995:606‚Äì607 is a genus of between six and 38 speciesAll of the species listed in the 'Selected species' section are accepted by The Plant List, but most are still under review, and therefore subject to changes in status. of deciduous shrubs in the family Caprifoliaceae, growing to 1‚Äì5 m (3-15') tall.

Music and lyrics It is a slight departure from the band's other releases, veering toward more of a rock sound as opposed to ska, especially on the first five tracks, where nary a syncopated drum beat or upstroke on the guitar is heard. Nevertheless, the album is a continuation of the band's longstanding tradition of putting self-loathing lyrics to upbeat music. The album also shows Reel Big Fish expanding their musical styles past the pop-rock sound, as it contains an a cappella cover of Frank Sinatra's classic \\"New York, New York\\" as well as a cover of Sublime's \\"Boss DJ\\". Additionally, the track \\"Drunk Again\\" and the international bonus track \\"Average Man\\" are sung by Reel Big Fish trumpeter-guitarist-pianist-vocalist Scott Klopfenstein.

Early life Atari was born in Rehovot, Israel, to Jewish parents who immigrated to Israel from Yemen. She is the sister of Yona Atari, a singer and actress, and Shosh Atari, a radio host and TV personality. Her father died when she was four years old, and, after his death, her family moved to live in Tel-Aviv. Career =1970s= Atari was introduced to the Israeli musician David Kribushe when she was 15 years old. After an audition for him, he gave her a featured singing part in one of his songs ‚ÄúHalf and Half‚Äù. In 1970, when she was 17 years old, she recorded two songs. The first song was in English, and it was called ‚ÄúGive Love Away‚Äù. The second song was a Hebrew song called ‚ÄúIm yesh lecha shemesh‚Äù (If You Have the Sun). The song became a big hit in Israel, and Atari represented Israel at the World Popular Song Festival in Japan. Atari participated in the contest again in 1976, this time with the song \\"The Same Old Game\\". During the 1970s, Atari‚Äôs career was progressing slowly. She recorded the song ‚Äúsal eretz hachalom‚Äù (About the Land of Dream), which did not get much attention, and in 1975 she participated in the Hassidic Song Festival with the song ‚ÄúLeyerushalyim Yirech‚Äù (To your city of Jerusalem) and won second place. In 1978, Atari performed the song \\"Nesich hachlomot\\" (Dream Prince), along with musicians Zvi Bums and Udi Spielman, at the Festival Hazemer Ha'ivri - the Israeli qualification heat for the Eurovision Song Contest. She placed third at the festival and released a successful album by the same name as her third place song. Atari, undeterred by not winning the qualification heat for the Eurovision, entered again in 1979, this time as female vocalist with the Milk and Honey. They won, and their song, ‚ÄúHallelujah‚Äù, represented Israel at the Eurovision Song Contest Song Contest staged in Jerusalem on March 31. The song was voted the winner and was a success on the European charts. =1980s= After their Eurovision Song Contest win, Atari kept performing with Milk and Honey. They recorded a few more songs, many of which became great hits like ‚ÄúGalgal Anak‚Äù (Big Wheel), which won the title Song of the year for 1980, ‚ÄúShir Lashirim‚Äù (A Song for the Songs), ‚ÄúYachad‚Äù (Together), and ‚ÄúUlay Od Kayitz‚Äù (Maybe One Summer). In 1980, after a year of working together, Atari retired from Milk and Honey as a result of a lawsuit she filed against her manager, Shlomo Tasch. Atari claimed in court that she was not paid for about sixty performances on TV and in Europe and that once she left Milk and Honey a new vocalist was introduced and released an album with songs she recorded under the new vocalist‚Äôs name. The trial dragged on for 14 years and concluded with a win for Atari, who was awarded 800,000 Shekels (about $227,000). In 1981 Atari, working with the producer Yeroslav Yahakivovitch, recorded a rock album titled \\"Kach Oti Habayta\\" (Take Me Home). The album included hits including ‚ÄúDuet Preda‚Äù (Goodbye Duet) ‚ÄúLo Yoda'at‚Äù (I Don‚Äôt Know), and ‚ÄúShelcha Ad Etmol‚Äù (Yours until Yesterday). In 1986 Atari released her fourth album \\"Emtza September\\" (Middle of September). The album quickly became her most successful album up to that point, selling over 30,000 copies and prompting Atari to go on a successful concert tour as a soloist for the first time in her career. Atari‚Äôs success continued through the 80s as the singer released two more albums, \\"Tza'ad Echad Lifnei Hanahar\\" (One Step before the River), which sold over 80,000 copies in 1988 and \\"Bereshit\\" (Genesis), which sold 15,000 copies in 1989. =1990s= In 1991 Atari released her first greatest hits album, titled \\"Rak Etmol\\" (Only Yesterday). The album was successful and sold over 20,000 copies. In 1992 the album \\"Bayom Sh√©achrei\\" (The Day After) was released, and Atari was named the Singer of the Year by the Israeli radio station Reshet Gimel. In 1994 she was requested by Israeli children's series Shirim K'tanim to work with Uzi Hitman. She was involved in the 7th video of the series which was revolving Passover and Shavuot and she joined in with all of the festival songs. In 1996 Atai gave birth to her only child, Li, which inspired her to release an album titled Glida (Ice Cream). Even though the songs were written by the most popular songwriters in Israel at the time like Kobie Oz, Asthar Shamir and Shalom Chanoch, the album was not successful. =2000s= In 2003 Atari released her album \\"Chabeck Oti L√©at\\" (Hug Me Slowly). The song ‚ÄúMa Sh√©at Ohevet\\" (What It Is that You Love) became successful and was adopted by many Israeli teenage girls as the celebration song for their Bat Mitzva celebrations. In 2008, after her sister Shosh Atari‚Äôs death, she released her album \\"Bein Ha√©sh Levein Hamayim\\" (Between Fire and Water), which was dedicated to her sister. In 2011, Atari released a few singles on the radio from an album in the works with the musician Amir Benayun. The album has yet to be released. In an interview on 2/17/2014 Atari said ‚ÄúThe album is not happening right now, but I wouldn‚Äôt hurry to call the project canceled. I believe in this project but I need to find the correct time for this project.‚Äù Relationship, Ynet In 2012, she was approached to do a PR film for Hadassim youth village where she grew up, she refused. In February 2014 a new album was announced and a new single ‚ÄúAhava Lemaerchakim Arukim‚Äù (Long-distance Love) was released. In 2019 when approached to revive the song that won her the Eurovision song contest at the 1979 competition, she refused to sing with her former team mates, Milk and Honey members Reuven Gvirtz, Shmulik Bilu and Yehuda Tamir. Instead, she sung the song as a solo artist, and almost immediately after joined by fellow past contestants Conchita Wurst, M√•ns Zelmerlow, Verka Serduchka, and Eleni Foureira.

The motion it can capture is similar to that captured by a line- scan CCD which uses a single line of photo-sensitive elements to capture one image strip of a scene that is moving at a right angle to the line of elements. A line-scan CCD needs to have high light levels, however, in order to register the light quickly before the motion causes smearing of the image. The TDI CCD overcomes this illumination limitation by having multiple rows of elements which each shift their partial measurements to the adjacent row synchronously with the motion of the image across the array of elements. This provides high sensitivity for moving images unobtainable using conventional CCD arrays or single-line-scan devices. The TDI CCD improves upon the single- line-scan system by adding the photocharges of its multiple lines.

Authorised in 1793, the main line from Trench to Shrewsbury was fully open by 1797, but it remained isolated from the rest of the canal network until 1835, when the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal built the Newport Branch from Norbury Junction to a new junction with the Shrewsbury Canal at Wappenshall. After ownership passed to a series of railway companies, the canal was officially abandoned in 1944; many sections have disappeared, though some bridges and other structures can still be found. There is an active campaign to preserve the remnants of the canal and to restore the Norbury to Shrewsbury line to navigation. History From 1768 several small canals were built in the area of what is now Telford. These canals carried tub boats. The first of these was the Donnington Wood Canal which opened in 1768, to be followed by the Wombridge Canal and the Ketley Canal, both opened in 1788, and the Shropshire Canal, which opened in 1791. The network linked Lilleshall and Pave Lane in the north to Coalbrookdale and Coalport in the south. Following a survey of the route by George Young from Worcester in 1792, an Act of Parliament was obtained in 1793 which authorised the creation of a canal to link the town of Shrewsbury with the east Shropshire canal network serving coal mines and ironworks around Oakengates, Ketley, Donnington Wood and Trench, nowadays part of the new town of Telford. The act authorised the raising of ¬£50,000 in shares, and an additional ¬£20,000 if necessary. This canal became the Shrewsbury Canal, and incorporated of the Wombridge Canal, which were purchased for ¬£840 from William Reynolds to provide access to the Donnington Wood Canal and the Shropshire Canal. Josiah Clowes was appointed Chief Engineer, but died in 1795 part way through construction. He was succeeded by Thomas Telford, then just establishing himself as Shropshire's County Surveyor and already engaged on the Ellesmere Canal slightly further north. The Ellesmere Canal was originally intended to connect Chester with Shrewsbury, but never reached the latter ‚Äì it became the modern Llangollen Canal and Montgomery Canal. =Infrastructure= One of Telford's first tasks was to build Longdon-on-Tern Aqueduct as a rebuild of a stone aqueduct over the River Tern at Longdon-on-Tern which had been built by Clowes but swept away by floods in February 1795. Telford's stonemason instincts initially led him to consider replacing the original structure with another stone-built aqueduct, but the heavy involvement of iron-masters in the Shrewsbury Canal Company, notably William Reynolds, led him to reconsider. Instead, it was rebuilt using a cast iron trough cast in sections at Reynolds' Ketley ironworks and bolted together in 1796. The main trough was wide and deep, with a narrower trough to one side which formed the towpath. The aqueduct was the world's first large-scale iron navigable aqueduct, though it was narrowly predated by a much smaller structure on the Derby Canal built by Benjamin Outram. The aqueduct still stands today, though it is isolated in the middle of a field. This successful use of an iron trough to contain the water of a navigable aqueduct casts the Tern aqueduct in the role of Telford's prototype for the much longer Pontcysyllte Aqueduct on the Llangollen Canal, where he mounted the iron trough on high masonry arches. The Shrewsbury Canal was finally finished in 1797, being long, with 11 locks. At Trench an inclined plane was built, which was long and raised boats up to the Wombridge Canal, from where they could travel via the Shropshire Canal southwards to the River Severn at Coalport. The plane consisted of twin railway tracks, each of which held a cradle. Boats would be floated onto the cradles, which had larger wheels at the back to keep the boat level. A third set of wheels were mounted at the front, which ran on extra rails in the dock, to prevent the cradle tipping forwards as it ran over the top cill. The plane opened in 1794, and although it was partially counterbalanced, with loaded boats going down the plane pulling empty boats up, a steam engine was also provided, to pull the boats over the top cill. This and the rails were provided by Reynolds' Coalbrookdale Company. In 1840 the rails were replaced with edge rails, allowing the use of conventional flanged wheels on the cradles, and the engine was replaced in 1842, with a high pressure Cornish engine, again ordered from the Coalbrookdale Company. The plane continued to be used until 1921, making it the last operational plane in Britain. The canal in Newport The canal included a tunnel at Berwick, which was wide, but included a wooden towpath, supported by bearers which were attached to the wall. Clowes designed the tunnel, but the addition of a towpath was suggested by Reynolds. The towpath lasted until 1819, when it was removed. By 1904, there was a white line painted in the middle of the tunnel, and if boats travelling in opposite directions met in the tunnel, the one which had passed the mark had right of way. =Operation= The canal was originally built as a narrow canal intended for horse-drawn trains of tub boats which were long and no wider than . However, in preparation for the Newport branch of the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal to Wappenshall the section from there to Shrewsbury was surveyed in 1831 and subsequently widened to take standard narrow boats. The costs of widening the bridge holes and the Eyton locks proved to be expensive, and plans to widen the section from Wappenshall to Trench were abandoned. With the opening of the Newport Branch in 1835, the Shrewsbury Canal was no longer isolated from the rest of the national canal network. This heralded the canal's most profitable period, though it was short-lived. The branch linked Norbury Junction to Wappenshall Junction, passing through Newport, and included 23 locks. In 1844 the Humber Arm was constructed. This short branch ran to Lubstree Wharf, which was owned by the Duke of Sutherland. Tramways ran from the end of the branch to various works owned by the Lilleshall Company, who shipped cargoes of pig iron, coal and limestone for use as a flux in the production of iron. Much of this trade had previously used the Donnington Wood Canal, but the new arm provided a more direct connection to the canal network, and the transfer of trade was a factor in the closure of the Donnington Wood Canal.'Lilleshall: Communications', A History of the County of Shropshire: Volume 11: Telford (1985), pp. 146‚Äì147 Most of the traffic on the canal was coal, bound for Shrewsbury. Tolls were charged at d per ton per mile, with an extra 1d to use the inclined plane. This was high, compared to other canals, and the rate was reduced to 1d per ton per mile in 1797, while Reynolds was allowed to ship iron and other commodities toll-free for a time. However, in 1799, the company raised the tolls to 2d. This led to some discontent, with the local newspaper complaining that rather than reducing the price of coal, the townspeople were paying two to three shillings more per ton than before the canal had been built. The enterprise was prosperous, with dividends on the ¬£125 shares rising to ¬£8 in 1805, ¬£10 in 1823 and ¬£11 in 1929. Immediately after the opening of the Newport branch, they reached ¬£16, but were back to ¬£10 by 1843. The coal producers complained about the tolls in 1843, but the canal company argued that they were charging too much for the coal, and lower tolls would not improve the situation. However, tolls were reduced to d in 1844, and the producers reduced the price of coal by 2s 6d. =Decline= In May 1845, the amalgamation of the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal and the Ellesmere and Chester Canal was authorised by an Act of Parliament, and there were schemes to build railways throughout the area that they served. The railway engineer Robert Stephenson held a meeting on 24 July, at which he proposed further amalgamation of canal and railway interests, in order to make the task of obtaining authorising acts easier. In addition to the enlarged Ellesmere and Chester Canal, the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company would absorb the Montgomeryshire Canal, the Shrewsbury Canal and the Shropshire Canal. While many miles of waterway would be replaced by railway, some would be retained in water, which included the Ellesmere Port to Middlewich via Burbridge Junction section, the Shropshire Canal and the Shrewsbury Canal. Three Acts of Parliament were obtained in 1846, to enable railway construction, and extra clauses enabled the name change to the Shropshire Union to be made, and the acquisition of the Shrewsbury Canal. At the time there were 500 shares in the Shrewsbury Canal, on which holders had paid ¬£125, and these were valued at ¬£150 each, which valued the canal at ¬£75,000. The first railway to be constructed was the Stafford to Shrewsbury Line, as it could be built quickly, and would be a great asset to the area. It was also stated that \\"its construction will not involve the loss of any revenue from the canals.\\" Realignments of various railway companies resulted in the formation of the London and North Western Railway Company (LNWR) on 1 January 1846, and they saw the Shropshire Union scheme as a threat. They therefore offered to lease the Shropshire Union in late 1846, and an Act to authorise this was obtained in June 1847. Conditions of the lease, which was not fully completed until 25 March 1857, meant that the Shropshire Union dropped all plans for further railway expansion, but they were given a free hand to run the canals as they saw fit. However, Robert Skey, the canal manager, when he addressed a meeting in September 1861, noted that the carriage of general merchandise had suffered, as it had gradually transferred to the railways. In 1870, a plan to reduce the costs of maintaining the Trench incline resulted in the company leasing Lubstree wharf from the third Duke of Sutherland. A new railway was built from the wharf to the Lilleshall Company works, and a wharfage charge of one halfpenny per ton for coal and other merchandise was agreed. The Shropshire Union set aside 30 boats to cope with the traffic, and in 1878 tolls for iron ore from Ellesmere Port to Lubstree were reduced, but by 1880, the only traffic on the Humber Arm was fluxing stone. In order to improve its use, the Shropshire Union agreed rates for carrying 300 to 400 tons of limestone and 100 to 150 tons of iron ore per week, and these measures were successful, as a further railway siding was built when the lease was renewed in 1891, and it was renewed for a further 14 years in 1905. Longdon-on-Tern Aqueduct was in a poor state of repair by 1899, when the company looked at closing the canal from Eyton to Shrewsbury, but the legal difficulties of a railway company closing a canal meant that it stayed open. In its later years, the Trench incline had only carried grain upwards to Donnington Wood mill, and the incline was closed on 31 August 1921. In 1922, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) took over the canal and the basin in Shrewsbury was closed. This action saved the cost of replacing the swing bridge at the basin entrance. Traffic on the Humber Arm ended in 1922, when the fifth Duke of Sutherland closed the wharf and the railway line to Lilleshall. No traffic used the canal to Shrewsbury after 1936, and a further section beyond Comet bridge was abandoned in 1939. Small volumes of coal were still reaching Longdon in 1939, and just 100 tons per year were recorded on the Newport Branch in 1943. The LMS finally abandoned the canal network in 1944, when they obtained an Act of Abandonment. The Shrewsbury Canal was just a small part of the abandoned under the 1944 Act. Following the transfer of responsibility for the canal network to British Waterways in 1963, much of the route of the canal was sold to local landowners. Restoration In 2000, the Shrewsbury Canal was the only one of the canals that formed part of the Shropshire Union Canal system which had no part open or under restoration. The Shrewsbury & Newport Canals Trust was created in that year to preserve and restore the waterway. In 2007, the canalside buildings at Wappenshall, including a transshipment warehouse which has been little altered since it ceased to be used in the 1930s, and retains many original features, were put up for sale. They were eventually purchased, along with a length of the canal and the Wappenshall basin, by Telford and Wrekin Council, who are working with the Trust to allow repairs to the buildings to be undertaken, with the aim of providing a museum and heritage centre for the canal, a caf√©, and offices for the Canals Trust. In August 2015, work began on a short section of the canal to the east of Newport, between Forton Aqueduct and Skew Bridge. The channel at this location is still owned by the Canal and River Trust who supported the work by the Trust and the Waterway Recovery Group, which involves reprofiling the bed and laying a Bentonite lining, with a view to rewatering the section in the summer of 2016. The waterproof lining was supplied by the Inland Waterways Association. Route The canal branched away from the Shropshire Union Canal at Norbury Junction, passing under a stone bridge which carried the Shropshire Union towpath over the branch. The bridge is a Grade II listed structure. The section to the first lock is still in water as it is used for moorings, while the first lock is used as a dry dock. The lock was the first in a flight of 17, which lowered the canal down the hillside as it passed through Oulton and to the south of Sutton and Forton. At the bottom of the flight, the canal and a minor road crossed the River Meese on the Forton Aqueduct, before passing under Skew Bridge which carries the road over the canal. The aqueduct is a scheduled ancient monument.Shrewsbury and Newport Canals Trust, Features, Forton Aqueduct & Skew Bridge , accessed 26 December 2008 The River Meese feeds the Aquelate Mere, which is a National Nature Reserve and the largest lake in the West Midlands region, covering .English Nature, National Nature Reserves, accessed 26 December 2008 Soon afterwards, the route of the canal has been cut by the building of the A41 Newport bypass. Beyond the bypass, Meretown lock marks the start of a watered section, which passes through Newport and included another five locks. The Strine Brook passes under the canal at both ends of this section, running parallel to the canal between the two aqueducts. The canal passed under Buttery Bridge, and then over Kinnersley Drive on an aqueduct, before the junction with the Humber Branch, which ran for about to the south, and served the industrial complex of Lilleshall. Two more aqueducts carried it over the Humber Brook and the Crow Brook, before the junction at Wappenshall where the new branch joined the original canal from Trench to Shrewsbury. At the junction, the warehouses, basin and a section of the canal have been bought by Telford and Wrekin Council, and include a Grade II Listed warehouse which straddled a dock, so that goods could be loaded and unloaded through trapdoors in the floor of the upper storey. The Trench branch rose through 9 locks from the junction, which were called Wappenshall, Britton, Wheat Leasowes, Shucks, Peaty, Hadley Park, Turnip, Baker's and Trench lock. Wappenshall Lock was demolished to make way for a weir which is part of a storm drain.Tony Clayton, The Shrewsbury Canal ‚Äì A Collection of Photographs, Wappenshall Lock, accessed 27 December 2008 Hadley Park and Turnip locks are Grade II listed structures, as is the bridge immediately downstream of Hadley Park lock, and both locks still have their original guillotine mechanism in situ. Beyond Trench lock, which was demolished in 1977 as part of a roadworks scheme,Tony Clayton, The Shrewsbury Canal ‚Äì A Collection of Photographs, Trench Lock, accessed 27 December 2008 the Trench Pool was the main water supply for the canal, after which the Trench incline carried boats another upwards. The building of an incline, rather than a flight of locks was dictated by the lack of an adequate water supply at the higher level. The locks on the Trench Branch, and the two Eyton locks, had guillotine gates at the lower end. They were long, and although Thomas Telford wrote in 1797 that they had a third set of gates, so that they could be used by a single tub-boat in the short section, a train of three tub- boats in the longer section, or a train of four boats if the outer gates were used, there is no evidence that the middle gates were ever fitted.Shrewsbury and Newport Canal Trust, Features, Shrewsbury Canal Guillotine Locks , accessed 26 December 2008 After Wappenshall junction the canal dropped down through the two Eyton locks, which were widened when the Newport Branch was built, passing to the north of Eyton upon the Weald Moors and through Sleapford, before crossing the River Tern on the aqueduct at Longdon-on-Tern. The canal then headed south-west, skirting the southern edge of Rodington, where it crossed the River Roden on an aqueduct which was demolished in January 1971,Tony Clayton, The Shrewsbury Canal ‚Äì A Collection of Photographs, Rodington Area, accessed 27 December 2008 and the eastern and southern edge of Withington, where there was a wharf. It passed under the Shrewsbury to Telford railway line south of Upton Magna, where the new line of the A5 road has blocked the line of the canal, to reach Berwick Wharf. Here it turned north- west, to enter the Berwick Tunnel. At the time of its construction, this was the longest canal tunnel in Britain, and the first equipped with a towpath through it. From the northern portal of the tunnel, it passed under the railway and the A5 road again, heading north to Uffington, after which it followed the large horseshoe bend in the River Severn to reach Shrewsbury where it terminated at Castle Foregate Basin adjacent to the Buttermarket building.

For the Lockier Clere Burges born in 1841, see Lockier Burges (1841-1929) Lockier Clere Burges Senior Lockier Clere Burges (c. 1814-31 July 1886) was an early settler in colonial Western Australia who became a leading pastoralist in the colony, and a Member of the Western Australian Legislative Council. Lockier Burges was born at Fethard in Tipperary, Ireland around 1814. In 1829, he emigrated to Western Australia with his two brothers William Burges and Samuel Evans Burges. The three brothers sailed for the Swan River Colony on board the Warrior, arriving in March 1830. The brothers settled on of virgin land at the junction of Ellen Brook and the Swan River at Upper Swan until 1837, before taking up of land at York. They named their new selection Tipperary in honour of their birthplace. In 1849, Lockier and William Burges moved to the Champion Bay area, leaving Samuel at Tipperary. Initially Lockier was Superintendent of the Geraldine lead mine. In 1851 Lockier Burges selected the homestead site for Irwin House on the Irwin River about inland from the modern site of Dongara. Burges, in partnership with Edward Hamersley, Samuel Pole Phillips and Bartholomew Urban Vigors, making up the pastoral group called The Cattle Company, were granted grazing leases over of land along the Irwin River and Greenough Flats, securing for the company a virtual monopoly of land in the area. In January 1860 Burges visited Ireland, returning to Western Australia in November 1862. Burges is noted in ornithology for specimens of birds obtained at York, supplied to John Gilbert and recorded by John Gould in Birds of Australia. Amongst the poorly known species he provided was one of the pied honeyeater Certhionyx variegatus and the type specimen of the grey falcon Falco hypoleucos. On 14 January 1879, Lockier Burges was nominated to the Western Australian Legislative Council. He held the position until 2 July 1884. In his final years he retired to Perth, where he died, unmarried, on 31 July 1886.

John Garrett Bussell was born at Portsea, Portsmouth, Hampshire in England on 16 August 1803. He was educated at Winchester College in England, but after the death of his father the family decided to emigrate to Western Australia. John Bussell and three of his brothers sailed for Western Australia on board the Warrior late in 1829, with the rest of the Bussell family to follow once the brothers were established. On arriving at the Swan River Colony in March 1830, the Bussell brothers were advised that most of the good land near the Swan River had already been granted. The Governor of Western Australia, Sir James Stirling suggested they instead join with a number of other families in joining a new sub-colony at Augusta. The following month, Stirling sailed with a party of prospective settlers on board the Emily Taylor. After arriving at the mouth of the Blackwood River, the party spent four days exploring the area. Stirling then confirmed his decision to establish a subcolony, the settlers' property was disembarked, and the town of Augusta declared at the site. For four years the brothers tried unsuccessfully to establish a farm, initially at Augusta and then further up the Blackwood River. The brothers had immense difficulty clearing the land, and found the soil not particularly good for farming. John Bussell conducted numerous exploring expeditions in search of better land. He was particularly impressed with the quality of land at Busselton (then known as the Vasse), and explored the area thoroughly. When the Bussell's home was destroyed by fire in 1834, the family re-established themselves at the Vasse, where they became successful and prosperous farmers. John Bussell would remain at the homestead Cattle Chosen, now in Bovell, until his death. John Bussell returned to England in 1837, with the intention of marrying his sweetheart Sophie Hayward. His relationship with her soured while he was in England, and their engagement was called off. However shortly after gaining his freedom Bussell met a widow named Charlotte Cookworthy (sister-in- law of Joseph Cookworthy), to whom he became engaged three weeks later. After marrying her in August 1838, they returned to Western Australia in 1839. Bussell became a Justice of the Peace in 1855, and a member of the Vasse Board of Education in 1861. During 1864 he taught at Bishop Hale's School (now Hale School) in Perth. He later undertook theological studies, but was never ordained. From 4 November 1870 to 3 July 1872, Bussell served as a nominee Member of the Western Australian Legislative Council. He died near Busselton on 17 September 1875. In 2016, a sculpture by Greg James, John Garrett Bussell, was unveiled by the City of Busselton in the ArtGeo Cultural Complex as part of the Busselton Settlement Art Project.

The modern Moroccan city of Meknes, which took its name from them, bears witness to their presence, as does the Spanish town of Mequinenza. After defeat by the Umayyads, many of the Miknasa converted to Islam. In 711, members of the tribe took part in the conquest of the Visigothic Kingdom under Tariq ibn Ziyad. They settled north of C√≥rdoba and in the 11th century founded the Aftasid dynasty in Badajoz.

The Miknasa adopted Kharijism-Islam and established the Emirate of Sijilmasa, under the Midrarid dynasty, on the northern edge of the Sahara in 757. This became very wealthy as the western end-point of the Trans-Saharan trade route with the Sudan. In alliance with the Caliphate of C√≥rdoba, it was able to fight off the attacks of the Fatimids. However, when the Miknasa chief Al-Mutazz allied himself with the Fatimids, the Miknasa were driven out of Sijilmasa by the Maghrawa, who were allies of the Umayyads.

Alfred Pickmore Bussell was born at Portsea, Portsmouth, Hampshire in England on 21 June 1816. He was educated at Winchester College in England, but after the death of his father the family decided to emigrate to Western Australia. Alfred Bussell and three of his brothers sailed for Western Australia on board the Warrior in March 1830, with the rest of the Bussell family to follow once the brothers were established. He was just thirteen years old at the time. On arriving at the Swan River Colony, the Bussells were advised to start a new sub-colony at Augusta. For four years the brothers tried unsuccessfully to establish a farm, initially at Augusta and then further up the Blackwood River. The brothers had immense difficulty clearing the land, and found the soil not particularly good for farming. Alfred's brother John conducted a number of exploring expeditions to the Vasse (later known as Busselton) in search of better land, with Alfred accompanying him on at least two expeditions. The explorers found excellent farmland at the Vasse, so after the Bussell's home was destroyed by fire in 1834, the family re- established themselves at the Vasse, where they became successful and prosperous farmers. Republished in 1979 by Nedlands, Western Australia: University of Western Australia Press. . In 1850, Alfred Bussell married Ellen Heppingstone, and the following year they moved to Broadwater in West Busselton. In 1857 they moved to Ellensbrook at Margaret River, and in 1865 they also took up \\"Wallcliffe\\", resulting in land holdings that stretched from Cowaramup to the Donnelly River. From 29 July 1872 until 30 June 1874, Alfred Bussell was a nominee Member of the Western Australian Legislative Council. Alfred Bussell's wife died in 1877, and he followed in 1882. They had six sons and eight daughters.

Launched in October 1999, it was a state-of-the-art, revolutionary service which included home banking, e-commerce, e-mail, video games, and other interactive applications - all meant to cater to the users' specific needs and requirements. Launching a few months late in August 1999, it only survived until October 2001 when it was acquired and rebranded by BSkyB, losing 116 million. Open.... was awarded a Design Council Millennium Product Award. The service was operated by Open Interactive Limited, which was a subsidiary of British Interactive Broadcasting. British Interactive Broadcasting was in turn owned by a consortium consisting of companies involving the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, British Telecom, Matsushita and BSkyB. Following disappointing revenues and a shift in marketing at Sky, BSkyB bought out the remaining shares of Open in May 2001 and the service was rebranded as Sky Active.  Service  Open was marketed as the flagship interactive TV service on the then newly launched Sky Digital platform in the UK. Open was originally designed to house all of Sky Digital's interactive functions under the one name and in the one place. Open had a state of the art fully refurbished head office in Farringdon Street, London where its own content was designed and built. The offices also housed their service control room and the service's proxy servers (for when users' Digiboxes dialed to download and upload data). Transmission took place at the then BT Teleport site in North London. Services included shopping, email, gaming, banking and information services like film guides and weather. The content was extensive and wide-ranging, however it was a \\"walled garden\\", as users could not go on the Internet or on traditional web pages. All content was specifically designed for use on Open and was not available on any other platform. During its short life, and despite Open processing 65 000 shopping transactions, it lost ¬£116 million. = Access and availability = Access was available to all Sky Digital subscribers and could be accessed at any time by pressing the \\"Interactive\\" button on the Sky Digital remote control. Open.... was marketed as being available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year for the customer's convenience. However, in reality, the service was unavailable for a number of minutes at quieter times (generally around 4 am each morning) when Open....'s proxy server software was being updated. This update meant that Digiboxes could not connect online, and left customers unable to make purchases or download data (such as weather forecasts).  Navigation  Users could navigate through Open.... using either the number keys or via the four coloured buttons typically on their Sky Digital remote control. Other buttons which were used included the \\"back-up\\" button to go back a screen, or the directional arrows also on their Sky Digital remote control. All screens, regardless of who provided the content, displayed the Open.... navigation banner. It was grey and semi-transparent and featured the four coloured buttons. The function of each coloured button varied; however, the red button was always the \\"go to\\" menu. It allowed users to bookmark a particular screen, view their browsing history, or \\"go back\\" a screen.  Structure  On entering the Open.... platform, users were presented with the Top Level Menu homepage. This consisted of 7 or 8 numbered options (typically shopping, banking, information, email and how to use), and a quarter screen video featuring traditional TV advertising (of the features available through Open....). As users navigated through the various menus, they could eventually enter Open.... service provider portals such as WH Smith shop or Talk21 email. An example can be seen above. Open.... was divided up into five main zones or areas, these included:  Shopping  Retailers such as Woolworths or The Gadget Shop were able to provide a small shop presence through Open.... featuring their own branding, style and products. Typically, because of the way Open.... worked, users had to connect and allow their Digibox to go online normally at a local rate number to download product information and, in all cases, make a purchase through Open.... Iceland were originally the flagship interactive store but, despite extensive advertising, never actually launched.  Banking  The three main banks to feature a presence on Open.... were HSBC (then Midland Bank), Halifax and The Woolwich; however, HSBC were the only bank to actually provide a true online banking experience. Halifax and The Woolwich only provided information pages on their range of products and services.  Information  Open.... provided various information screens such as news and sports coverage from Sky News and Sky Sports, weather forecasts, showbiz (through the \\"Hello\\" portal) as well as cinema listings and travel guides. Open.... also featured a Going Places travel agent outlook, but again, this was just for information; no holidays could be purchased via Open....  Gaming  Gaming was exceptionally popular with younger Open.... users. Games were generally available over the satellite transmission and, as such, did not require the user to go online to download game data (except when submitting high scores). Original games included Beehive Bedlam, Fathom, Big Top Drop, Sheep Dip, Marvin Mole, King Tutti, Bumble Tumble, and Corporal Cluck. Marvin Mole Level 5 was completed blindfolded by Daniel Shah, in over 1000 moves. Beehive Bedlam was the only game which was still available through the Sky Games portal until its closure in January 2015. Although viewers didn't actually notice a difference apart from the Sky Games branding; the game had been totally rebuilt from scratch since Open.... first launched. Beehive Bedlam was relaunched in 2020 in Sky Q.  Personal  Open.... provided (through BT) a Talk 21 email portal. Through the Digiboxes' online connection, users could register, send and receive email through the BT Talk 21 service. All emails (regardless of encoding) were seen and sent as plain text. Attachments could not be read or attached. When the service was first launched, it was expected to use the @open-talk.co.uk domain; however, as BT were a major shareholder, it was felt better to use the BT Talk 21 email brand. Another Open.... service was the Open Organiser. It allowed users to create personal profiles and store their credit card details for use throughout the whole Open.... platform. Rather than have to type in your name, address and credit card number in every time you wanted to purchase something through Open...., you could opt to select your profile from the Organiser screen and use those stored details. The Organiser portal required an online connection at all times in order to work.  Criticisms  Open.... faced many critics and criticisms, some of which are listed below: 1\\\\. Open was extremely slow compared with the Internet. When users transitioned between zones or service providers, they faced around a 30-second wait for the next application to download. 2\\\\. Online connections. To send any data to Open...., users were required to allow their digiboxes to go online normally at a local or national rate phone number. 3\\\\. Users could not watch Sky TV and use Open.... at the same time. 4\\\\. Being a \\"walled garden\\", service providers had to lease a certain amount of capacity on the platform. With this in mind, online shops normally featured an extremely limited selection of products. 5\\\\. A number of service providers were heavily advertised such as Iceland and E*Trade. However, these providers never actually launched a service on the platform.

In 2016, Nonviolent Peaceforce was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize.http://www.startribune.com/nonviolent- peaceforce-nominated-for-nobel-peace-prize/370729351/ History The organization was founded by David Ray Hartsough, a US Quaker and civil rights activist, and Mel Duncan, former US member of the Nicaragua coffee/cotton brigades during the Contra war of 1984. The organization, first prompted by a 1999 citizens' conference in The Hague, was founded in New Delhi in 2002. Mel Duncan served as Executive Director until 2009, in Minneapolis, MN. The central office moved to Brussels, Belgium in 2010 under Executive Director Tim Wallis, while retaining its U.S. operations in Minneapolis, near the Loring Park neighborhood. The organization was led by Doris Mariani until 31 May 2016, when Executive Director Tiffany Easthom took over. The organization has central offices in St. Paul, MN, and Brussels, Belgium. It is registered in the US as a 501(c)(3) organization and in Belgium as an AISBL.  Work  = Past Projects =  Sri Lanka (2003‚Äì2011)  The pilot project of NP was started in 2003 in Sri Lanka. Nonviolent Peaceforce peacekeepers were at work there between 2003 and 2008 but they could not stop the war that reoccurred in 2008 and came to an end only when the SLA defeated LTEE in May 2009. After 2009, NP continued work in the country for two years, mainly on child protection, helping to integrate former child soldiers back into everyday life, and working with local communities to bolster their own self-protection capabilities. In 2011, NP officially closed its mission in Sri Lanka.  Guatemala (2007)  NP had a short-term engagement in Guatemala in 2007. Nonviolent Peaceforce had been invited by the Unidad de Protecci√≥n a Defensoras y Defensores de Derechos Humanos (UDEFEGUA), the Protection Unit for Human Rights Defenders. During the presidential elections taking place in September and November 2007, violence increased and human rights defenders were threatened; a small team of four members focused on accompanying the human rights defenders or being present in their office day and night. NP's work there allowed human rights defenders to function in a hostile climate, and they left shortly after elections were finished.  South Caucasus (2012‚Äì2014)  After an exploratory mission in the region, NP deployed its team to the South Caucasus in 2012.Schweitzer, Christine: Humanitarian Protection as an Additional Function of Humanitarian, Development and Peace Projects ‚Äì or Rather a Task Requiring Experts?‚Äù, in: id. (Ed.): Civilian Peacekeeping ‚Äì A Barely Trapped Resource, Wahlenau 2010, p. 49 There they worked along the Administrative Boundary Line between Georgian Tbilisi- Administered-Territories and de facto South Ossetia on civilian protection capacities in the region while canvassing to determine other places in the area that might benefit from unarmed civilian protection. NP left the area in 2014.  Ukraine (2015)  After many rounds of exploration missions in the country, Nonviolent Peaceforce was invited to Ukraine in March 2015 to conduct trainings on unarmed civilian protection for civil society groups and the communities they serve. This was conducted with the Association for Middle Eastern Studies and was the first time UCP had been introduced in Ukraine.  Bangladesh (2018‚Äì2019)  Nonviolent Peaceforce started working in Cox's Bazar, the world‚Äôs largest refugee camp located in Bangladesh in 2018. As the refugee crisis unfolds, and overwhelming humanitarian needs emerge, the NP team is working with local partners to improve the safety of people living in the camp and to prepare for the flooding and mudslides of the rainy season. NP is building collaborative relationships with local non-governmental organizations, internal Rohingya-led organizations, and international non- governmental organizations and is providing protection to these organizations responsible for overseeing the camp.Bangladesh Why Nonviolence  Lebanon/Syria (2012‚Äì2018)  Nonviolent Peaceforce's activity in the Middle East began in 2012 with a joint training with the UN Office on Genocide Prevention and Responsibility to Protect for activists in civil society in Lebanon and Syria. The seminar was part of an initiative by the UN in response to increasing polarization in the area. = Ongoing Projects =  Philippines (2007‚Äì)  In Mindanao, Philippines a ceasefire was the starting point for the invitation of NP by local peace organizations (e.g. Mindanao peoples Caucus and Consortium of Bangsamoro Civil Society). After a short time, NP Philippines was part of the International Monitoring Team (IMT) to oversee the ceasefire agreement between the Philippine Army and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, a guerilla organization that sought independence and later self-determination for the southern island of Mindanao. NP is responsible for the Civilian Protection Component which had its antecedents (and still relies on) the Independent Fact-Finding Committee and Bantay Ceasefire.Lustenberger, Philipp: Civilian Protection: From the International to the Grassroots Level, in: Zartman, I.W./P.T. Hopman (Eds.): Mindanao. Understanding Conflict 2011, Washington 2011, p. 52-54 An impact evaluation done in May 2014 found that citizens in Mindanao felt safer due to Nonviolent Peaceforce‚Äôs presence and their role as part of the CPC for IMT.  Southern part of Sudan, now Republic of South Sudan (2010‚Äì)  After the cancellation of a proposed project in Uganda, the peace agreement between Sudan and the Sudan Liberation Army as well as the planned independence referendum in South Sudan in January 2011 provided a starting point for exploring and later implementing a project in Sudan/South Sudan. Two Sudanese organizations, the Institute for the Promotion of Civil Society (IPCS) and the Sudanese Organization for Nonviolence and Development (SONAD), invited NP to assist in preventing violence before and during the forthcoming elections and referendum.see: interview with Oloo Otieno, in: Ricci, Andrea (Ed.): From Early Warning to Early Action? The Debate on the enhancement of the EU's crisis response capability continues, European Commission, DG External Relations, Br√ºssel 2008 [part 2: Crisis Response ‚Äì Mediation and Peacekeeping] = http://eeas.europa.eu/ifs/publications/book_2_en.htm, last retrieved: 09.08.2012) The more general task, also for the time after the referendum, was to build up local expertise for preventing and mediating in inter-ethnic conflicts in the region. The assignment was led by a Sri Lankan peacekeeper who was responsible for the protection of children in Sri Lanka. In South Sudan, UNICEF financed a similar project specifically for Ugandan child soldiers who were recruited by the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). The field offices have since been extended to ten teams. Much of Nonviolent Peaceforce‚Äôs work in South Sudan focuses on child protection and women‚Äôs protection. They have successfully trained many women on the ground to form ‚ÄúWomen‚Äôs Peacekeeping Teams‚Äù (WPTs) in order to reduce gender-based violence on the ground. WPTs have also been cited as empowering women on the ground in South Sudan while simultaneously emphasizing the importance of protecting women and children. On 8 March 2016, Nonviolent Peaceforce launched an $8 million project on \\"Promoting Women's Role in Peacebuilding and Gender-Based Violence Prevention in South Sudan\\". The funding for the project came from the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and will be functionally funded through the Dutch Embassy in South Sudan.  Myanmar (2012‚Äì)  In 2012, Nonviolent Peaceforce received an official invitation from the Government of Myanmar. One of the main tasks NP has there is to monitor ceasefires and to set up mechanisms by which civilians can monitor them. They hold trainings across the country for these purposes. NP is also supporting women's organizations on the ground, aiding them in taking a more prominent role in guiding decision-making at the local level.  Iraq (2017‚Äì)  Nonviolent Peaceforce began work in Iraq in February 2017, establishing an office in Erbil, in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) and deploying staff to facilitate the start-up of a country programme. NP initially focused on the provision of frontline protection services to internally displaced persons (IDP) along the displacement corridors during the military offensives to retake ISIS-controlled areas. Since the end of major combat operations against ISIS, NP has refocused efforts on vulnerable IDPs in camps, returnees in contested and high-risk areas, tensions along the disputed Federal Iraq and KRI border, and arbitrary detentions.Transforming the world's response to conflict  Organizational Elements  The work of NP consists of three pillars: projects in conflict areas; lobbying, especially within United Nations as well as European Commission and European Parliament; training. The organizational and administrative day-to-day duties are carried out by the secretariat- headed by the Executive Director. The programmatic work (on projects, explorations, budget and policies) is the task of the international board called International Governing Council (IGC).Mel Duncan, Mark Zissman, Patrick Savaiano: Nonviolent Peaceforce: A Realistic Choice for the Future, in.

These tanks used many advanced or unusual features, such as siliceous-cored armor, a new transmission, and the OPTAR fire-control system. The OPTAR incorporated an electro-optical rangefinder and was mounted on the right side of the turret, and was used in conjunction with the APFSDS-firing 90 mm T208 smoothbore gun, which had a rigid mount without a recoil system. In addition, although the tanks were designed with a torsion beam suspension, a hydropneumatic suspension was fitted, and one of the tanks was fitted with a Solar Saturn gas turbine for demonstration purposes. The siliceous cored armor consisted of fused silica, which has a mass efficiency of approximately three versus copper-lined shaped charges, embedded in cast steel armor for an overall mass efficiency of 1.4. The early APFSDS penetrators fired by the T208 had a low length-to-diameter ratio, this being limited by their brittle tungsten carbide construction, with a diameter of 37 mm, although they had a high muzzle velocity of . The rangefinder, the \\"T53 Optical Tracking, Acquisition and Ranging\\" (OPTAR) system, emitted pulsed beams of intense but incoherent infrared light. These incoherent beams scattered easily, reducing effectiveness in mist and rain and causing multiple returns, requiring the gunner to identify the correct return after estimating the range by sight. This, combined with the large and vulnerable design of the transmitter and receiver assembly, led to the abandonment of the OPTAR system in 1957. History =Development= In the early 1950s, work began in the US to develop an eventual replacement to the M48 tank, the operational medium tank at the time. A series of relatively simple upgrades to the T48 were considered as part of the T54 project, but these were considered to offer too little advantage to be worth it. Examples of more radical upgrades were also called for. In September 1954, out of many submitted plans, two main examples were chosen ‚Äì one of them, the T95; the other, the T96, which used a heavier gun and a 105 mm round. Both tanks used smooth-bore barrels with a fixed mount and no recoil system. In November 1956, it was finally decided that nine tanks would be produced. Four of them would be original T95s. One would be a T95 with a 90 mm gun on a mount with a recoil system, receiving the designation T95E1. The remaining four would use the T95 chassis and the T96 turret, and were designated the T95E4. =Production= Because the T96 turrets were not yet constructed (and were never completed), it was decided that of the four T95E4s, two would be fitted with the M48A2 turret, and the other two were fitted with T54E2 turret and with 105-mm T140 cannon. The first T95 variant to go into production was the T95E2, in May 1957. The T95E3 was produced in July of the same year, and the first original T95s were ready in February 1958.  Description The T95 tank was created using a traditional design with a driver in the front, the fighting compartment in the center, and the engine compartment in the rear. The tank had a four-man crew, consisting of a commander, a gunner, a loader, and a driver. The driver‚Äôs work area is in the forward compartment. The driver's hatch is located in the glacis above his head. With the hatch sealed the driver operates using three periscopic visual devices, the middle of which is equipped with a night-vision infrared camera from the T161. Ammunition stores are located on either side of the driver‚Äôs chair. = Hull and turret = The majority of the hull is welded, but the front is a single massive casting. The upper part of the forward armor, or glacis, has a thickness of 95 mm and is at an angle of 65 degrees from vertical. The thickness of the roof and floor of the hull around the driver's compartment is 51 and 19 mm respectively; the thicknesses of said areas are 25 and 13 mm, respectively, around the fighting and engine compartments. The thickness of the main side plates vary from 102 mm up front down to 32 mm around the engine. The cast turret has a ring diameter of 85 inches (the same as the M48). The frontal turret armor is 178 mm, and the sides are 78 mm. The shape of the turret is elongated compared to the M48. The gunner‚Äôs seat is situated to the right of the main gun in the front of the turret. The commander‚Äôs seat is also in the turret with a built-in 12.7 mm M2 machine gun, with an M28 periscopic sight for aiming. For 360-degree vision, 5 armored viewports are installed in the turret. Primary shells are stored in the lower section of the turret, beneath the ring. =Armament= The T95 and the T95E1 are equipped with a T208 90 mm smooth-bore gun. The T95 equipment was installed on a fixed mount and was stabilized in two axes. The T95E1 equipment was installed on a recoil mount, but lacked stabilization systems. All T95 models were equipped with T320 armor-piercing rounds, which had a tungsten core, a diameter of 40 mm, and a muzzle velocity of 1520 meters per second. These rounds could successfully penetrate a 127 mm armor plate when fired at a 60-degree angle from 2000 yards. A standard T95 was equipped with 50 rounds. The T95E2 retained the armament of its predecessor, the M48A2. With a 90 mm gun, it could fire a 74 mm anti-armor shell at 915 meters per second for a range of 2000 yards. It was equipped with 64 rounds. The T95E3 was armed with a T140 105 mm rifled gun. With a muzzle velocity of 1079 m/s, the armor piecing capability at 2000 yards is 122 mm at a 60-degree firing angle. Standard equipment was 64 rounds. The T95E4 was planned to have a T210 105 mm smoothbore gun. In order to accommodate the extra length of the rounds (112 cm), the gun was moved forward, preventing stabilization. The muzzle velocity of the round was 1740 m/s, with an armor penetration of 152 mm at 60 degrees at 2000 yards Standard equipment was 40 rounds. With the appearance of the T123 120 mm rifled gun, it was decided that it should be installed on two of the four planned T95E4s. This variant was designated T95E6. The T123 gun had a muzzle velocity of 1070 m/s and armor-piercing capability of 122 mm at 60 degrees, at a range of 2000 yards. =Fire-control system= The T95E2 and the T95E3 were equipped with a fire-control system, identical to the one used in the M48A2, with a stereoscopic rangefinder and a mechanical ballistics computer. The T95 also had an FCS which had an OPTAR optic rangefinder, as well as an electronic ballistics computer. It also featured a periscopic sight from the T44 and a T50 ballistic computer. The T95E1 used a simplified targeting system ‚Äì a rangefinder and a ballistics computer were omitted. = Powerplant = Under the original proposal, T95 and T96 tanks had to be equipped with an X-shaped 750 hp 12-cylinder diesel engine. However, because this engine was only in the early stages of development, it was decided to temporarily equip the tanks with a 4-stroke, 8-cylinder AOI-1195 gasoline engine. The engine was placed transversely and was connected with the XTG-410 four-speed transmission. Three fuel tanks, with a total capacity of 780 liters, were installed in the engine compartment. Despite higher fuel economy compared to the M48A2 engine, gasoline engines provided insufficient torque. At the same time, the development of the X-shaped diesel engine failed, so starting in mid-1958, other options were considered. As an interim measure, they decided to use a modified version of the civilian 12-cylinder, two- stroke, water-cooled, V-type, 570 hp GM 12V71T diesel engine. A contract was signed with the Continental Motors Company in the development of the AVDS-1100 air-cooled diesel engine, and with Caterpillar to develop the LVDS-1100 water- cooled diesel engine. Both engines are quad-V-shaped, with an estimated 550 hp. However, tank testing with the three new power plants began after the retirement of the T95 program. =Chassis= The suspension consists of five sets of double road wheels with torsion bar springs. The system does not have track return rollers. The forward and rearmost road wheels are equipped with hydraulic shock absorbers. On some of the tanks lightweight openwork road wheels were used. Caterpillar treads were used, with rubber bushed pins. The width of the tracks were 533 mm or 610 mm. The number of tracks in a tread was 80 and the length of the bearing surface was 4.2 m. Retirement During the development of T95 tank, it became clear that it would not have a significant advantage over the M48A2. The X-shaped motor and optical rangefinder were both discarded due to performance, and the accuracy of the smoothbore gun continued to be unsatisfactory. All this led to the closure of the project on July 7, 1960. At the same time, work on the T95E7 turret was continued, which led to the creation of the fairly successful M60A1 turret. Some existing T95 hulls were re-fitted with the AVDS-1790 engine and used from 1960 to 1964 to develop the T118E1 prototype of the M728 Combat Engineer Vehicle.Tank Data, vol. 3.

It is located north-west of Wroc≈Çaw on the Oder River, and is the site of a large chemical plant complex, PCC Rokita SA. , the town's population was 12,511. History The alley connecting the Old Town with Warzy≈Ñ The oldest Slavic settlements in present-day Brzeg Dolny date back to the early Middle Ages. In the 10th century the area became part of the emerging Polish state under its first ruler Mieszko I of Poland. Brzeg Dolny was first mentioned under the Old Polish name Brzege in a 1353 deed as a part of the Duchy of Wroc≈Çaw, then within the Bohemian (Czech) Crown Lands. The Warzy≈Ñ district is older, mentioned as a village in a 1261 document of Duke Henry III the White when the region was still part of medieval Piast-ruled Poland. There was a ferry crossing the Oder River in Brzeg Dolny. In 1660, it was bought by the Austrian chancellor Baron George Abraham von Dyhrn (1620‚Äì1671) of the Dyhrn family. In 1663, it was officially renamed from its Polish name to Dyhernfurth, after the Dyhrn family, and was granted town privileges by Emperor Leopold I of Habsburg. The baron made efforts to expand the new town, opening a Catholic school for boys and building a chapel under the patronage of St. Hedwig. The year 1668 saw the construction of a wooden pipe to draw water directly from the river into town. Jews also settled in Brzeg Dolny in the 17th century. Their arrival was connected to the printing house of Shabbatai Bass; the press personnel consisted of Polish and Czech Jews from Prague, Cracow and Wodzis≈Çaw. By 1694 the number of the printing house personnel consisted of 48 people in 13 Jewish families. From 1772 onward Bass‚Äô printing house published the Dyhernfurther Privilegierte Zeitung, which was written in the German language but printed using the Hebrew alphabet. The Dyhrns had built a palace for their residence, which stayed in their possession until the early 1780s, when Count Wilhelm von Dyhrn (1749‚Äì1813) sold it to the minister of Silesia Karl Georg von Hoym (1739-1807), who had married Baroness Antoinette Louise von Dyhrn und Sch√∂nau (1745‚Äì1820). The new owners subsequently modernized the Baroque palace and the adjoining park according to the plans of Carl Gotthard Langhans. Langhans also directed the construction of a large neo-classical pavilion perpendicular to the central structure, which became known as the ‚ÄúLittle Palace.‚Äù Following these changes, the grand complex remained much the same until 1849, when it passed into the hands of Tony von Lazareff. She had it refashioned to resemble a Renaissance ch√¢teau overlooking the Loire. The river bank garden was also given Renaissance character. In 1742, after the First Silesian War, the duchy became part of Prussia and remained in Prusso-German possession until 1945. In 1860, the first sisters of Charity of St. Charles Borromeo came to Dyhernfurth. In close proximity to the Chapel of St. Hedwig, the nuns established a small convent and a hospital, which would eventually expand into the town hospital of present day. In 1834 the printing house published its last book. After it formally closed in 1840, the Jewish community rapidly diminished as printers went elsewhere for work; by 1885 there were only 35 Jews left in the town. In 1927 the synagogue was transformed into a fire station, in 1936 the last burial was performed at the Jewish cemetery, and in November 1938, the cemetery was demolished. =World War II= Memorial to the victims of the local subcamps of the Nazi German Gross-Rosen concentration camp During World War II, as part of the Gr√ºn 3 program, a plant for the manufacture of the nerve agent tabun was established in Dyhernfurth, producing the nerve agent under the codename Trilon-83. Run by the Anorgana GmbH, a branch of IG Farben, the plant began production in 1942. The Germans utilized the forced labour of prisoners of Nazi concentration camps to produce the chemical weapons. Two subcamps of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp ‚Äì Dyhernfurth I and Dyhernfurth II ‚Äì were established for this purpose. While the Dyhernfurth I inmates were forced to produce the gas and fill bombs and shells with it, the prisoners of the second camp were primarily forced to work on enlarging the plant. The plant initially produced shells and aerial bombs using a 95:5 mix of tabun and chlorobenzene, designated \\"Variant A\\" before switching in the latter half of the war to \\"Variant B,\\" an 80:20 mix of tabun and chlorobenzene designed to make the mixture disperse more easily. Large scale manufacturing of the agent resulted in problems with the product's degradation over time and only around 12,500 tons of material were manufactured before the plant was overrun by the advancing Soviet forces. The Soviets, however, did not capture any tabun at Dyhernfurth. Although they occupied the area of the factory, a German raid was organized by Generalmajor Max Sachsenheimer. A German unit with roughly the strength of a battalion crossed the Oder River early on February 5, 1945, seized the factory, and deployed an anti-tank screen. On that day, the Germans destroyed documentation and evidence of the camp's atrocities and pumped tabun into the Oder River, while the screening force resisted two small-scale Soviet counter-attacks. In the evening of February 5, the German force pulled back behind the Oder River.Duffy, pp. 129-132. Subsequently, the Soviet government had the plant dismantled and taken back to Russia. In January 1945, as the Soviets launched their massive offensive into eastern Germany, Count Thassilo von Saurma-Hoym, a descendant of Karl Georg von Hoym, left the Dyhernfurth palace along with his family and fled westward. In February, the palace was set on fire, probably by Soviet soldiers. When the town was handed over to Poland, its German population was expelled, in accordance to the Potsdam Agreement. It was repopulated by Poles, expelled from former eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union, particularly from Stanis≈Çaw√≥w and Sniatyn. =Post-war period= After the war the original Polish name Brzeg was restored, and the adjective Dolny was added to distinguish it from the more populous town of Brzeg. Considerable effort was required to adapt the contaminated and badly damaged factory buildings to production. It was not until 1946 that the plant started producing Sodium hypochlorite. The new plant was named Rokita in June 1947. The historic palace was rebuilt in the 1950s, albeit with its shape altered. The adjoining pavilion has, however, managed to survive unchanged. Today, the complex functions as a cultural center and the seat of municipal government. A new bridge over the Oder river was built in 2013. Town's layout Brzeg Dolny is divided into three main residential neighbourhoods: Stary Brzeg (the Old Brzeg Dolny) by the bank of the Oder, Osiedle Warzy≈Ñ to the west, and Osiedle Fabryczne to the north-east. The Rokita Chemical Plant stretches east of the town. In the center of Brzeg Dolny is a large (67 hectare) Park Miejski formerly part of the palace complex. The palace faces the southern side of the park, to which it connects via a short walkway (Al. Pa≈Çacowa) leading directly to the largest of the three ponds found within the park. On the park's west side, at Aleje Jerozolimskie (one of the town's main streets), stands the Chapel of St. Hedwig, just north of which is the Convent of the Sisters of Charity of St. Charles Borromeo. Extending north from the convent (to which it is connected) is the town hospital; north of it, in turn, and still along Aleje Jerozolimskie is a large clinic (Przychodnia Rejonowo-Specjalistyczna). The town has two additional clinics (in Osiedle Warzy≈Ñ and Osiedle Fabryczne) and a medical center (in Osiedle Warzy≈Ñ). In Osiedle Warzy≈Ñ can be found the KHS complex, which features a hotel and a variety of athletic facilities, including swimming pools and tennis courts. Through the town - between Osiedle Warzy≈Ñ and Osiedle Fabryczne - runs a railway, with a (PKP) train station located on the eastern side of the park toward the south and Stary Brzeg. Religion Brzeg Dolny has three Roman Catholic parishes: the Parish of Our Lady of the Scapular (Parafia Matki Bo≈ºej Szkaplerznej), the Parish of Christ the King (Parafia Chrystusa Kr√≥la), and the Parish of Our Lady Queen of Poland (Parafia Matki Bo≈ºej Kr√≥lowej Polski). In addition to two historic churches and chapels, there are two modern parish churches in the town.

The district is the largest in Licking County, with nearly 7,000 students. District history The district was formed in 1848 after the passage of a voter petition to unify the schools in Newark under one system. The first school board was elected on September 19, 1849. A \\"Negro school\\" operated from 1859 until 1888 to provide segregated education to African American children in the Newark district. At the request of the U.S. government in 1940, the district initiated industrial training programs that were intended to assist in national defense. The shops operated 24 hours a day, six days a week, and after the attack on Pearl Harbor, became directly funded by the government to expand into a second building and thirty-five classes. It has been estimated that the district trained 8,000 people between 1940 and 1945 with skills essential to the national defense industries. , three additional elementary schools and two middle schools are slated to begin construction. In mid-2005 Newark City Schools began to phase out its former system of schooling. Under the former system, grades K-4th went to elementary school, grades 5th-6th went to intermediate school, 7th-8th went to middle school, and grades 9th-12th went to High School. Under the reformed system of schooling, grades K-5 go to elementary school, 6-8 goes to middle school, and 9-12 goes to high school. Former intermediate schools include Central Intermediate and West Main Intermediate. Central is now a private school and West Main is a vacant facility. The elementary schools include Carson, Cherry Valley, Hillview, and Legend Elementary Schools. The middle schools are Heritage (replaced Lincoln), Liberty Middle School and Wilson Middle School. District management The district's Board of Education consists of five citizens elected to staggered four-year terms, with one president, one vice- president, and three members. In addition to the general goal of educating the district's students, the Board has the specific duties of hiring the district's superintendent and treasurer, overseeing the annual budget, and approving contracts with district employees. Board meetings are open to the public and held in the high school library. The superintendent is directly responsible to the district Board of Education, and implements board policies. He administers the district's educational programs and has final responsibility for curriculum, staffing, and evaluation. All district employees are responsible to the superintendent, except for the treasurer, who is also a direct employee of the board. In cooperation with the superintendent, the treasurer manages the district's financial, legal and contractual affairs.

It was released on April 5, 2005 on Mojo Records to mixed reviews. Music Notably darker than the band's previous album, Cheer Up!, the album's songs commonly express jealousy, regret, short-lasting fame, and disappointment toward mainstream record companies. The album also includes covers of Tracy Chapman's \\"Talkin' Bout a Revolution\\", Morrissey's \\"We Hate It When Our Friends Become Successful\\" and Social Distortion's \\"Story of My Life\\". Both the Chapman cover and the Social Distortion cover were respectively chosen as the first and second singles. Release The album was not particularly successful in comparison to previous releases. The band felt a large portion of this was on the record company's lack of promotion. This, amongst a long list of other conflicts, led to the band's 2006 split with Jive Records.

It was defined by Michel Laurin (2001) and Vallin and Laurin (2004) as the largest clade that includes Homo sapiens, but not Ascaphus truei (tailed frog). The informal variant of the name, \\"reptiliomorphs\\", is also occasionally used to refer to stem-amniotes, i.e. a grade of reptile-like tetrapods that are more closely related to amniotes than they are to lissamphibians, but are not amniotes themselves; the name is used in this meaning e.g. by Ruta, Coates and Quicke (2003). An alternative name, \\"Anthracosauria\\", is also commonly used for the group, but is confusingly also used for a more primitive grade of reptiliomorphs (Embolomeri) by Benton.Benton, M. J. (2000), Vertebrate Paleontology, 2nd Ed. Blackwell Science Ltd 3rd ed. 2004 ‚Äì see also taxonomic hierarchy of the vertebrates, according to Benton 2004 As the exact phylogenetic position of Lissamphibia within Tetrapoda remains uncertain, it also remains controversial which fossil tetrapods are more closely related to amniotes than to lissamphibians, and thus, which ones of them were reptiliomorphs in any meaning of the word. The two major hypotheses for lissamphibian origins are that they are either descendants of dissorophoid temnospondyls or microsaurian \\"lepospondyls\\". If the former (the \\"temnospondyl hypothesis\\") is true, then Reptiliomorpha includes all tetrapod groups that are closer to amniotes than to temnospondyls. These include the diadectomorphs, seymouriamorphs, most or all \\"lepospondyls\\", gephyrostegids, and possibly the embolomeres and chroniosuchians. In addition, several \\"anthracosaur\\" genera of uncertain taxonomic placement would also probably qualify as reptiliomorphs, including Solenodonsaurus, Eldeceeon, Silvanerpeton, and Casineria. However, if lissamphibians originated among the lepospondyls according to the \\"lepospondyl hypothesis\\", then Reptiliomorpha refers to groups that are closer to amniotes than to lepospondyls. Few non-amniote groups would count as reptiliomorphs under this definition, although the diadectomorphs are among those that qualify. Changing definitions The name Reptiliomorpha was coined by Professor Gunnar S√§ve-S√∂derbergh in 1934 to designate amniotes and various types of late Paleozoic tetrapods that were more closely related to amniotes than to living amphibians. In his view, the amphibians had evolved from fish twice, with one group composed of the ancestors of modern salamanders and the other, which S√§ve-S√∂derbergh referred to as Eutetrapoda, consisting of anurans (frogs), amniotes, and their ancestors, with the origin of caecilians being uncertain. S√§ve-S√∂derbergh's Eutetrapoda consisted of two sister-groups: Batrachomorpha, containing anurans and their ancestors, and Reptiliomorpha, containing anthracosaurs and amniotes. S√§ve-S√∂derbergh subsequently added Seymouriamorpha to his Reptiliomorpha as well. Alfred Sherwood Romer rejected S√§ve-S√∂derbergh's theory of a biphyletic amphibia and used the name Anthracosauria to describe the \\"labyrinthodont\\" lineage from which amniotes evolved. In 1970, the German paleontologist Alec Panchen took up S√§ve- S√∂derbergh's name for this group as having priority,Panchen, A. L. (1970). Handbuch der Pal√§oherpetologie - Encyclopedia of Paleoherpetology Part 5a - Batrachosauria (Anthracosauria), Gustav Fischer Verlag - Stuttgart & Portland, 83 pp., . but Romer's terminology is still in use, e.g. by Carroll (1988 and 2002) and by Hildebrand & Goslow (2001).Carroll, R. L., (1988): Vertebrate paleontology and evolution. W. H. Freeman and company, New York. Some writers preferring phylogenetic nomenclature use Anthracosauria.Gauthier, J., Kluge, A.G., & Rowe, T. (1988): \\"The early evolution of the Amniota\\". In The Phylogeny and Classification of the Tetrapods: Volume 1: Amphibians, Reptiles, Birds. Edited by M.J. Benton. Clarendon Press, Oxford, pp. 103‚Äì155. In 1956, Friedrich von Huene included both amphibians and anapsid reptiles in the Reptiliomorpha. This included the following orders: Anthracosauria, Seymouriamorpha, Microsauria, Diadectomorpha, Procolophonia, Pareiasauria, Captorhinidia, Testudinata.Von Huene, F., (1956), Pal√§ontologie und Phylogenie der niederen Tetrapoden, G. Fischer, Jena. Michael Benton (2000, 2004) made it the sister-clade to Lepospondyli, containing \\"anthracosaurs\\" (in the strict sense, i.e. Embolomeri), seymouriamorphs, diadectomorphs and amniotes. Subsequently, Benton included lepospondyls in Reptiliomorpha as well. However, when considered in a Linnean framework, Reptiliomorpha is given the rank of superorder and includes only reptile-like amphibians, not their amniote descendants.Systema Naturae (2000) / Classification Superorder Reptiliomorpha Several phylogenetic studies indicate that amniotes and diadectomorphs share a more recent common ancestor with lepospondyls than with seymouriamorphs, Gephyrostegus and Embolomeri (e.g. Laurin and Reisz, 1997, 1999; Ruta, Coates and Quicke, 2003; Vallin and Laurin, 2004; Ruta and Coates, 2007). Lepospondyls are one of the groups of tetrapods suggested to be ancestors of living amphibians; as such, their potential close relationship to amniotes has important implications for the content of Reptiliomorpha. Assuming that lissamphibians aren't descended from lepospondyls but from a different group of tetrapods, e.g. from temnospondyls, it would mean that Lepospondyli belonged to Reptiliomorpha sensu Laurin (2001), as it would make them more closely related to amniotes than to lissamphibians. On the other hand, if lissamphibians are descended from lepospondyls, then not only Lepospondyli would have to be excluded from Reptiliomorpha, but seymouriamorphs, Gephyrostegus and Embolomeri would also have to be excluded from this group, as this would make them more distantly related to amniotes than living amphibians are. In that case, the clade Reptiliomorpha sensu Laurin would contain, apart from Amniota, only diadectomorphs and possibly also Solenodonsaurus. Characteristics Gephyrostegids, seymouriamorphs and diadectomorphs were land-based, reptile-like amphibians, while embolomeres were aquatic amphibians with long body and short limbs. Their anatomy falls between the mainly aquatic Devonian labyrinthodonts and the first reptiles. University of Bristol paleontologist Professor Michael J. Benton gives the following characteristics for the Reptiliomorpha (in which he includes embolomeres, seymouriamorphs and diadectomorphs): * narrow premaxillae (less than half the skull width) * vomers taper forward * phalangeal formulae (number of joints in each toe) of foot 2.3.4.5.4‚Äì5 Limnoscelis, a carnivorous diadectomorph =Cranial morphology= The groups traditionally assigned to Reptiliomorpha, i.e. embolomeres, seymouriamorphs and diadectomorphs, differed from their contemporaries, the non-reptiliomorph temnospondyls, in having a deeper and taller skull, but retained the primitive kinesis (loose attachment) between the skull roof and the cheek (with exception of some specialized taxa, such as Seymouria, in which the cheek was solidly attached to the skull roofCarroll, R. L., (1988): Vertebrate paleontology and evolution. W. H. Freeman and company, New York, p. 167 and 169.). The deeper skull allowed for laterally placed eyes, contrary to the dorsally placed eyes commonly found in amphibians. The skulls of the group are usually found with fine radiating grooves. The quadrate bone in the back of the skull held a deep otic notch, likely holding a spiracle rather than a tympanum.Palaeos Reptilomorpha =Postcranial skeleton= left The vertebrae showed the typical multi-element construction seen in labyrinthodonts. According to Benton, in the vertebrae of \\"anthracosaurs\\" (i.e. Embolomeri) the intercentrum and pleurocentrum may be of equal size, while in the vertebrae of seymouriamorphs the pleurocentrum is the dominant element and the intercentrum is reduced to a small wedge. The intercentrum gets further reduced in the vertebrae of amniotes, where it becomes a thin plate or disappears altogether.Chapter 4: \\"The early tetrapods and amphibians.\\" In: Benton, M. J. (2004), Vertebrate Paleontology, 3rd ed. Blackwell Science Ltd. Unlike most labyrinthodonts, the body was moderately deep rather than flat, and the limbs were well-developed and ossified, indicating a predominantly terrestrial lifestyle except in secondarily aquatic groups. Each foot held 5 digits, the pattern seen in their amniote descendants.Romer, A.S. & T.S. Parsons. 1977. The Vertebrate Body. 5th ed. Saunders, Philadelphia. (6th ed. 1985) They did, however, lack the reptilian type of ankle bone that would have allowed the use of the feet as levers for propulsion rather than as holdfasts.Palaeos Reptilomorpha: Cotylosauria =Physiology= Discosauriscus, a neotenic seymouriamorph The general build was heavy in all forms, though otherwise very similar to that of early reptiles. The skin, at least in the more advanced forms probably had a water- tight epidermal horny overlay, similar to the one seen in today's reptiles, though they lacked horny claws. In chroniosuchians and some seymouriamorphs, like Discosauriscus, dermal scales are found in post-metamorphic specimens, indicating they may have had a \\"knobbly\\", if not scaly, appearance. Seymouriamorphs reproduced in amphibian fashion with aquatic eggs that hatched into larvae (tadpoles) with external gills; it is unknown how other tetrapods traditionally assigned to Reptiliomorpha reproduced. Evolutionary history =Early reptiliomorphs= Archeria, an aquatic embolomere During the Carboniferous and Permian periods, some tetrapods started to evolve towards a reptilian condition. Some of these tetrapods (e.g. Archeria, Eogyrinus) were elongate, eel-like aquatic forms with diminutive limbs, while others (e.g. Seymouria, Solenodonsaurus, Diadectes, Limnoscelis) were so reptile-like that until quite recently they actually had been considered to be true reptiles, and it is likely that to a modern observer they would have appeared as large to medium-sized, heavy-set lizards. Several groups however remained aquatic or semiaquatic. Some of the chroniosuchians show the build and presumably habits of modern crocodiles and were probably also similar to crocodylians in that they were river-side predators. While some other Chroniosuchians possessed elongated newt- or eel-like bodies. The two most terrestrially adapted groups were the medium-sized insectivorous or carnivorous Seymouriamorpha and the mainly herbivorous Diadectomorpha, with many large forms. The latter group has, in most analysis, the closest relatives of the Amniotes.Laurin, M. (1996): Phylogeny of Stegocephalians, from the Tree of Life Web Project =From aquatic to terrestrial eggs= Seymouria, a terrestrial seymouriamorph Their terrestrial life style combined with the need to return to the water to lay eggs hatching to larvae (tadpoles) led to a drive to abandon the larval stage and aquatic eggs. A possible reason may have been competition for breeding ponds, to exploit drier environments with less access to open water, or to avoid predation on tadpoles by fish, a problem still plaguing modern amphibians.Duellman, W.E. & Trueb, L. (1994): Biology of amphibians. The Johns Hopkins University Press Whatever the reason, the drive led to internal fertilization and direct development (completing the tadpole stage within the egg). A striking parallel can be seen in the frog family Leptodactylidae, which has a very diverse reproductive system, including foam nests, non- feeding terrestrial tadpoles and direct development. The Diadectomorphans generally being large animals would have had correspondingly large eggs, unable to survive on land. Fully terrestrial life was achieved with the development of the amniote egg, where a number of membranous sacks protect the embryo and facilitate gas exchange between the egg and the atmosphere. The first to evolve was probably the allantois, a sack that develops from the gut/yolk-sack. This sack contains the embryo's nitrogenous waste (urea) during development, stopping it from poisoning the embryo. A very small allantois is found in modern amphibians. Later came the amnion surrounding the fetus proper, and the chorion, encompassing the amnion, allantois, and yolk-sack. =Origin of amniotes= Westlothiana, a small reptile-like tetrapod which may be an early lepospondyl, close to the origin of amniotes, or both Exactly where the border between reptile-like amphibians (non-amniote reptiliomorphs) and amniotes lies will probably never be known, as the reproductive structures involved fossilize poorly, but various small, advanced reptiliomorphs have been suggested as the first true amniotes, including Solenodonsaurus, Casineria and Westlothiana. Such small animals laid small eggs, 1 cm in diameter or less. Small eggs would have a small enough volume to surface ratio to be able to develop on land without the amnion and chorion actively effecting gas exchange, setting the stage for the evolution of true amniotic eggs. Although the first true amniotes probably appeared as early as the Middle Mississippian sub-epoch, non-amniote (or amphibian) reptiliomorph lineages coexisted alongside their amniote descendants for many millions of years. By the middle Permian the non-amniote terrestrial forms had died out, but several aquatic non-amniote groups continued to the end of the Permian, and in the case of the chroniosuchians survived the end Permian mass extinction, only to die out prior to the end of the Triassic. Meanwhile, the single most successful daughter-clade of the reptiliomorphs, the amniotes, continued to flourish and evolve into a staggering diversity of tetrapods including mammals, reptiles, and birds.

It was approved by ICANN as a sponsored top-level domain, and is operated by Telnic. Telnic announced in January 2011 that over 300,000 domains had been registered since the start of general availability on 24 March 2009. A substantial drop of mostly IDN \`.tel\`s occurred at the beginning of 2014 - the current total registered \`.tel\`s as of 21 July 2016 is 98,516.http://registrarstats.com/TLDDomainCounts.aspx The domain's purpose is to provide a single name space for Internet communications services. Subdomain registrations serve as a single point of contact for individuals and businesses, providing a global contact directory service by hosting all types of contact information directly in the Domain Name System, without the need to build, host or manage a traditional web service. Additionally, as of July 2010, every .tel domain acts as an OpenID and an increasing number of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) clients can address a .tel domain name directly. The TLD implementation also supports the hCard micro-format. Administration of domains Telnic started publicly accepting applications for name registrations on 3 February 2009 after a closed Sunrise period for trademark holders. Information in .tel can be controlled by the owner through a website control panel that Telnic has created for registrars to provide to their customers, or through free clients for BlackBerry, Microsoft Outlook, iPhone, Android and some third party VoIP softphone clients. With the introduction of support for OAuth in July 2010, however, new third-party clients and services are available to tel registrants for publishing records to their domains securely, including the possibility of editing information offline via SMS gateways. The control panel is an open source application, and can be changed or completely replaced by registrars, as the application programming interfaces required to manage information in the DNS were released by Telnic in October 2008. When viewed over the Web, all tel domains point directly to a Telnic proxy webpage that is populated on the fly presenting the respective domain name owner's contact data stored within the DNS system. domains can also be accessed without opening a browser on many devices through open source applications or through direct DNS lookups. Since 13 March 2017 additionally other name servers could be set for tel domains, which allows administration of domain name system records. Now tel domains behave like ordinary domains and could be used for web hosting and email. Technical overview In contrast to other top-level domains, .tel information is stored directly within the Domain Name System (DNS), within the actual domain name record, as opposed to the DNS simply returning details (such as IP addresses) of the machines on which information can be found. For example, users who register a .tel domain using Telnic name servers cannot create a type A Resource Record with the IP address of their own host. A user who wants to host a web site or run an own web server has to set own or providers' name servers. As Telnic has enabled the DNS records to be encrypted using 1024-bit RSA with PKCS#1.5 padding and stored in sub-folders which are hidden until paired with a public private key handshake with individuals, there is protection from spammers. As .tel also supports any type of contact information, concierge services like temporary email addresses, temporary telephone numbers and so on can all be utilized for additional protection of public information. Reliability of data The .tel TLD was released to trademark holders only until 3 February 2009, perhaps suggest that the resulting database of contact information can somehow be trusted as the official contact information of the rightful owner of those trademarks. However, after the short period of registrations restricted to trademark holders only (the Sunrise period), anyone willing to pay a premium price was allowed to buy any domain name (the Landrush period) regardless of who owned the trademark. Furthermore, during General Availability, anyone is able to register any name (assuming that it is available for registration) without paying a premium price. The information held under the .tel domain is no more accurate or trustworthy than any other user defined data held in the DNS system. It will be down to individual .tel owners to choose what they wish to store there. As with all other gTLDs, trademark owners can utilize the Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy (UDRP) to claim trademarked domains back. Differences from domain .mobi Since some of the services that are expected to use tel domains can be achieved on mobile telephones, there may be overlap with the intended use of the mobi domain, which was also approved by ICANN in the same round. However, .tel is about publishing contact data: phone numbers, SIP addresses and so on directly in the DNS, not on html-based websites., whereas the focus of the .mobi domain is providing web sites and other content formatted specifically for the user interface available on mobile phones and other mobile devices. Alternative usage proposal Pulver.com (operated by Jeff Pulver) also submitted an application‚Äì New sTLD RFP Application .tel-Pulver Part B. Application Form for the .tel TLD, but had a different intent. This proposal involved telephone number style numeric identifiers. Alternative viewpoints claimed that this either complemented or conflicted with telephone number mapping (ENUM). Purely numeric identifiers have now been approved for release by Telnic and will be released later in 2011, with the restriction that single-digit .tel domains be withheld in order to avoid confusion with ENUM.

It is in the unitary district of Telford and Wrekin, and is approximately east of Shrewsbury and north-west of Telford. Longdon-Upon-Tern is situated on the River Tern, a tributary of the River Severn. Settled since at least the Normans, the village is notable as the site of the Longdon-on-Tern Aqueduct, the first large-scale cast iron navigable aqueduct, designed and built by Thomas Telford for the canal. The aqueduct is Grade I listed and a preserved as a scheduled ancient monument. History The name Longdon is derived from two Old English words, lang and d≈´n, meaning long hill. A settlement at Longdon-Upon-Tern dates to at least the Normans, as it is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Languedune, held by St. Alkmund's Church. It continued with the church until the 12th century when it passed to Lilleshall Abbey until its dissolution in the 16th century.\\"Longdon-Upon-Tern\\" Its Domesday assets were: 2 hides, 5 ploughs, and a mill worth 5s.Domesday Book: Languedune, National Archives, UK =Parish= Longdon-Upon-Tern is an ecclesiastical parish. In 1988 it merged with Rodington ecclesiastical parish, a close by village, to create the Civil Parish of Rodington with a parish council, to relieve civil responsibilities from the two ecclesiastical parishes. The civil parish boundaries now include the areas of Long Waste, Long Lane, Isombridge, Marsh Green, Sugdon, Rodington, Rodington Heath, and Longdon-Upon-Tern. Although the two separate parishes have now merged into a civil parish with a parish council, the two distinct ecclesiastical parishes maintain both village halls hosting varied community activities.\\"Parish Plan\\", Rodington Parish Church =Church= Today's church is the Church of St Bartholomew. This is a small 18th-century, Grade II listed, Georgian stone and red brick church. Built in 1742 the church has had major alterations and an extension in the late 19th century. On the same site stands the refurbished Grade II* listed Longdon-Upon-Tern village hall, formerly a schoolhouse provided by the Duke of Sutherland and opened in 1849. Due to a decline in population, the school closed in 1970. =Population= Longdon-Upon-Tern total population There have been no population figures for Longdon-Upon-Tern since 1961 as the census data from Longdon-Upon-Tern is now included with the Rodington Civil Parish.

Aqueduct Longdon-Upon-Tern aqueduct The village is particularly notable as the location of the world's first large-scale cast iron navigable aqueduct (, ). Designed by Thomas Telford, the aqueduct opened in 1797 as part of the Shrewsbury Canal.http://www.transportheritage.com/find- heritage-locations.html?sobi2Task=sobi2Details&sobi2Id;=790 Telford built the cast iron aqueduct to replace a stone aqueduct, originally built by Josiah Clowes, which was swept away by floods in 1795. Although the canal was abandoned in 1944 due to the shift in traffic to the rail networks, the aqueduct remains. It is Grade I listed and a scheduled ancient monument, situated in fields astride the River Tern. The monument is signposted and visible from the road. Clearly marked footpaths lead directly to the monument from a small roadside car park. Telford later designed and built the very much larger Pontcysyllte Aqueduct in Wales, now designated as a World Heritage Site.

The letter is called back yer or back jer in the pre-reform Russian orthography, in Old East Slavic, and in Old Church Slavonic. Originally the yer denoted an ultra-short or reduced middle rounded vowel. It is one of two reduced vowels that are collectively known as the yers in Slavic philology. Bulgarian In Bulgarian, the er goljam (\\"–µ—Ä –≥–æ–ª—è–º\\") is the 27th letter of the alphabet. It is used for the phoneme representing the mid back unrounded vowel , sometimes also notated as a schwa . It sounds somewhat like the vowel sound in some pronunciations of English \\"but\\" or the Chinese \\"de\\" (ÁöÑ) . It is similar to the Romanian letter \\"ƒÉ\\" (for example, in \\"bƒÉiat\\" ). In unstressed positions (in the same manner as ‚ü®–∞‚ü©), ‚ü®—ä‚ü© is normally pronounced , which sounds like Sanskrit \\"a\\" (‡§Ö), Portuguese \\"terra\\" , or the German -er in the word \\"Kinder\\" . Unlike the schwa sound in English, the Bulgarian can appear in unstressed as well as in stressed syllables, for example in \\"–≤—äÃÅ–∑–¥—É—Ö\\" ['v…§Ãûzdux] 'air' or even at the beginning of words (only in the word \\"—äÃÅ–≥—ä–ª\\" ['…§Ãûg…ê…´] ‚Äòcorner‚Äô) Before the reform of 1945, this sound was written with two letters, \\"—ä\\" and \\"—´\\" (\\"big yus\\", denoting a former nasal vowel). Additionally \\"—ä\\" was used silently after a final consonant, as in Russian. In 1945 final \\"—ä\\" was dropped; and the letter \\"—´\\" was abolished, being replaced by \\"—ä\\" in most cases. However, to prevent confusion with the former silent final \\"—ä\\", final \\"—´\\" was replaced instead with \\"–∞\\" (which has the same sound when not stressed). It is variously transliterated as ‚ü®«é‚ü©, ‚ü®ƒÉ‚ü©, ‚ü®ƒÖ‚ü©, ‚ü®√´‚ü©, ‚ü®ƒô‚ü©, ‚ü®≈≥‚ü©, ‚ü®≈≠‚ü©, or simply ‚ü®a‚ü©, ‚ü®u‚ü© and even ‚ü®y‚ü©. Belarusian and Ukrainian The letter is not used in the alphabets of Belarusian and Ukrainian, its functions being performed by the apostrophe. In the Latin Belarusian alphabet (≈Åacinka), the hard sign's functions are performed by j. Rusyn In the Carpatho-Rusyn alphabets of Slovakia and Poland, —ä (Also known as —ñ—Ä) is the last letter of the alphabet, unlike the majority of Cyrillic alphabets, which place —ä after —â. In Pannonian Rusyn, —ä is not present. Macedonian Although Macedonian is closely related to Bulgarian, its writing system does not use the yer. During the creation of the modern Macedonian orthography in the late 1944 and the first half of 1945, the yer was one of the subjects of arguments. The problem was that the corresponding vowel exists in many dialects of Macedonian, but it is not systematically present in the west-central dialect, the base on which the Macedonian language standard was being developed. Among the leaders of the Macedonian alphabet and orthography design team, Venko Markovski argued for using the letter yer, much like the Bulgarian orthography does, but Bla≈æe Koneski was against it. An early version of the alphabet promulgated on December 28, 1944, contained the yer, but in the final version of the alphabet, approved in May 1945, Koneski's point of view prevailed, and no yer was used. The absence of yer leads to an apostrophe often being used in Macedonian to print texts composed in the language varieties that use the corresponding vowel, such as the Bulgarian writer Konstantin Miladinov's poem Taga za Jug (–¢—ä–≥–∞ –∑–∞ —é–≥). Russian =Modern Russian: hard sign= In Modern Russian, the letter \\"—ä\\" is called the hard sign (—Ç–≤—ë—Ä–¥—ã–π –∑–Ω–∞–∫ / tvjordyj znak). It has no phonetic value of its own and is purely an orthographic device. Its function is to separate a number of prefixes ending in consonants from subsequent morphemes that begin with iotated vowels. It is therefore commonly seen in front of the letters \\"—è\\", \\"–µ\\", \\"—ë\\", and \\"—é\\" (ja, je, jo, and ju in English). The hard sign marks the fact that the sound continues to be heard separately in the composition. For example: *—Å–µ—Å—Ç—å sjest 'sit down' *–≤—Å—Ç–∞—Ç—å vstat 'get up' *—Å—ä–µ—Å—Ç—å sjest perfective form of 'eat' It therefore functions as a kind of \\"separation sign\\" and has been used only sparingly in the aforementioned cases since the spelling reform of 1918. The consonant before the hard sign often becomes somewhat softened (palatalized) due to the following iotation. As a result, in the twentieth century there were occasional proposals to eliminate the hard sign altogether, and replace it with the soft sign —å, which always marks the softening of a consonant. However, in part because the degree of softening before —ä is not uniform, the proposals were never implemented. The hard sign —ä is written after both native and borrowed prefixes. It is sometimes used before \\"–∏\\" (i), non-iotated vowels or even consonants in Russian transcriptions of foreign names to mark an unexpected syllable break, much like an apostrophe in Latin script (e.g. –ß–∞–Ω—ä–∞–Ω—å ‚Äî Chang'an), the Arabic ayn (e.g. –î–∞—Ä—ä–∞ ‚Äî Dara ), or combined with a consonant to form a Khoisan click (e.g. –ß—ä—Ö–æ–∞–Ω ‚Äî «ÇHoan). However, such usage is not uniform and, except for transliteration of Chinese proper names, has not yet been formally codified (see also Russian phonology and Russian orthography). =Final yer pre-1918= Before 1918, a hard sign was normally written at the end of a word when following a non-palatal consonant, even though it had no effect on pronunciation. For example, the word for \\"cat\\" was written \\"–∫–æ—Ç—ä\\" (kot) before the reform, and \\"–∫–æ—Ç\\" (kot) after it. This old usage of —ä was eliminated by the spelling reform of 1918, implemented by the Bolshevik regime after the 1917 October Revolution. Because of the way this reform was implemented, the issue became politicized, leading to a number of printing houses in Petrograd refusing to follow the new rules. To force the printing houses to comply, red sailors of the Baltic Fleet confiscated type carrying the \\"parasite letters\\".–°–ª–æ–≤–æ –æ —Å–ª–æ–≤–∞—Ö, –õ–µ–≤ –£—Å–ø–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π, –õ–µ–Ω–∏–∑–¥–∞—Ç, 1962, p. 156 Printers were forced to use a non-standard apostrophe for the separating hard sign, for example: *pre-reform: —Å—ä—£–∑–¥—ä *transitional: —Å‚Äô–µ–∑–¥ *post-reform: —Å—ä–µ–∑–¥ In the beginning of the 1920s, the hard sign was gradually restored as the separator. The apostrophe was still used afterward on some typewriters that did not include the hard sign, which became the rarest letter in Russian. In Belarusian and Ukrainian, the hard sign was never brought back, and the apostrophe is still in use today. According to the rough estimation presented in Lev Uspensky's popular linguistics book A Word On Words (–°–ª–æ–≤–æ –æ —Å–ª–æ–≤–∞—Ö / Slovo o slovah), which expresses strong support for the reform, the final hard sign occupied about 3.5% of the printed texts and essentially wasted a considerable amount of paper, which provided the economic grounds to the reform. Printing houses set up by Russian √©migr√©s abroad kept using the pre-reform orthography for some time, but gradually they adopted the new spelling. Meanwhile in the USSR, Dahl‚Äôs Explanatory Dictionary was repeatedly (1935, 1955) reprinted in compliance with the old rules of spelling and the pre-reform alphabet. Today the final yer is sometimes used in Russian brand names: the newspaper Kommersant (–ö–æ–º–º–µ—Ä—Å–∞–Ω—Ç—ä) uses the letter to emphasize its continuity with the pre-Soviet newspaper of the same name. Such usage is often inconsistent, as the copywriters may apply the simple rule of putting the hard sign after a consonant at the end of a word but ignore the other former spelling rules, such as the use of —£ and —ñ.–ê—Ä—Ç–µ–º–∏–π –õ–µ–±–µ–¥–µ–≤, –ö–æ–≤–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–æ, ¬ß 23. –ù–µ–º–Ω–æ–≥–æ –æ –¥–æ—Ä–µ–≤–æ–ª—é—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –æ—Ä—Ñ–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏–∏. It is also sometimes encountered in humorous personal writing adding to the text an \\"old-fashioned flavour\\" or separately, denoting true. Languages of the Caucasus and Crimean Tatar In Cyrillic orthographies for various languages of the Caucasus, along with the soft sign and the palochka, the hard sign is a modifier letter, used extensively in forming digraphs and trigraphs designating sounds alien in Slavic, such as /q/ and ejectives. For example, in Ossetian, the hard sign is part of the digraphs –≥—ä / Å/, –∫—ä /k º/, –ø—ä /p º/, —Ç—ä /t º/, —Ö—ä /q/, —Ü—ä /ts º/, —á—ä /t É º/, as well as the trigraphs –∫—ä—É /k ∑ º/ and —Ö—ä—É /q ∑/. The hard sign is used in the Crimean Tatar language for the same purpose.

The body is based in Inverness, Highland, and is in charge of the rules of the game. Its main competitions are the Tulloch Homes Camanachd Cup and the Mowi Premiership and the Mowi Valerie Fraser Camanachd Cup.  Structure  The Camanachd Association was founded in 1893 after a meeting in Kingussie in order to formalize a set of rules for the many shinty clubs across the British Isles. The Camanachd Association maintained its initial structure for much of its first century but the ‚ÄòFuture of Shinty' Report published in 1981 led to a compete restructuring of the way in which shinty was organised and managed. That, in turn, led to the move away from a dependence on volunteers to govern the sport, to the Association's first salaried employees being employed. This also resulted in the other myriad associations which organised shinty coming under the Association. Other associations which still have a strong role in organising shinty are the Glasgow Celtic Society, the Macaulay Association and the Schools Camanachd Association. In 2005, the Camanachd Association took the decision to change its structure again and moved to being a company limited by guarantee with no share capital. The company is overseen by a board of directors, most of whom are volunteers who are chosen by the members at the AGM. The membership of the association consists of shinty clubs and related associations, such as the Glasgow Celtic Society. The membership appoints non- salaried office-bearers through the Annual General Meeting, which is also the only medium through which the playing rules of shinty can be altered.  Recent history  COMPETITIONS Newtonmore defeated Lovat by three goals to nil to retain the 2018 Tulloch Homes Camanachd Cup. The final which was played at Mossfield Stadium, Oban was Newtonmore‚Äôs 3rd consecutive victory and their 33rd in total. Despite two North teams contesting ‚Äì shinty‚Äôs BIG day out! - the final in Oban attracted a crowd in excess of 2,000 spectators, plus a large additional audience tuning in via live TV, radio and online broadcasts. Newtonmore forward Evan Menzies, who scored two goals, won the Albert Smith Medal for Man of the Match. The 2018 Artemis Macaulay Cup Final in Oban proved to be an exciting game, with Kinlochshiel defeating Kyles Athletic by three goals to two in a thrilling match with the destiny of the trophy in doubt until the final whistle. Both these finals were broadcast live on BBC2 Scotland. Newtonmore defeated Kinlochshiel by two goals to one to retain the Cottages.com MacTavish Cup at Bught Park, Inverness in a match which was broadcast live on BBC ALBA. The Glasgow Celtic Society Cup Final was also broadcast live on BBC ALBA and was won by Oban Camanachd who defeated Kyles Athletic by two goals to nil at Taynuilt. The Liberty British Aluminium Balliemore Cup Final was held at An Aird, Fort William where Kilmallie triumphed over Glasgow Mid Argyll by three goals to two. The Aberdein Considine Sutherland Cup Final was won by Newtonmore, who defeated Kingussie by five goals to two at The Dell, Kingussie. Lochside Rovers won the Bullough Cup defeating Kyles Athletic by five goals to two in an exciting encounter played at Strachur. Newtonmore defeated Fort William to win the Strathdearn Cup with a four goals to nil victory at the Bught Park, Inverness. The Women‚Äôs Cup Finals Day again took place at The Dell, Kingussie. Badenoch & Strathspey triumphed in the Valerie Fraser Camanachd Cup defeating Skye by four goals to one whilst Glenurquhart won the Marine Harvest Challenge Cup by four goals to three against Inverness. The Finals Day was once again an excellent occasion, with a large crowd and some exciting shinty being played. The Valerie Fraser Camanachd Cup was broadcast live on BBC ALBA for the first time. The Marine Harvest Senior Men‚Äôs Shinty/Hurling International between Scotland and Ireland at the Bught Park on 20 October was won by Scotland, their fifth consecutive Bught Park victory, to retain the Marine Harvest Quaich. The final score was Scotland 1 ‚Äì 11 (14) and Ireland 1 ‚Äì 9 (12). Scotland‚Äôs Senior Women played their Shinty/Camogie challenge match against Dublin at the Bught Park prior to the Senior International. The final score was Scotland 4 ‚Äì 1 (13) Dublin 0 ‚Äì 2 (2). Scotland defeated their Irish counterparts to win the Marine Harvest Under 21 Shinty / Hurling International trophy in a match played on 3 November at Abbotstown, the GAA‚Äôs National Development Centre in Dublin. The score was Ireland 2 ‚Äì 7 (13) Scotland 6 ‚Äì 7 (25). Participation in the senior leagues in 2018 dropped to 53 teams from 54 in 2017, as a result of Dunoon not entering a team. The Marine Harvest Premiership comprised ten teams, with eight teams in the Marine Harvest National Div, there were eight teams in Marine Harvest North Div 1 and eleven teams in Marine Harvest North Div 2, Marine Harvest South Div 1 had ten teams with six teams in Marine Harvest South Div 2. In total there have been 655 senior fixtures scheduled in 2018, compared to 689 in 2017. 29 fixtures were unfulfilled due to team raising difficulties, down from 39 in 2017. 92 fixtures were postponed and rescheduled compared to 125 in 2017, of that 92, 53 were due to unplayable fields and 8 due to bereavement, a further 26 were rescheduled at the request of both clubs in compliance with the Byelaws. During 2018, 12 fixtures were reversed or transferred to an alternative venue to ensure the game took place on the scheduled date, this compares with 9 in the previous year, 14 fixtures were played midweek. Newtonmore won The Marine Harvest Premiership by six points despite losing two of their first 4 league fixtures; this was their eighth league title in the last nine years. Both Skye and Glenurquhart, having finished in the bottom two positions of the Premiership, are relegated and both will play in the Marine Harvest National Division in 2019. Kilmallie won the Marine Harvest National Division, and they will be joined in the Premiership by Inveraray. Newtonmore won Marine Harvest North Div 1 again but being a 2nd Team, they are not eligible to be promoted. Bute won Marine Harvest South Div 1 and will play in the Marine Harvest National Division in 2019. Lovat won Marine Harvest North Div 2 and are promoted to play in Marine Harvest North Div 1 in 2019 with Aberdeen University, who finished bottom of Marine Harvest North Div 1 replacing them. Strachur won Marine Harvest South Div 2 dropping only 2 points. Kilmory will replace them in Marine Harvest South Div 2. With only two fixtures remaining Kilmory advised that they were unable to complete their league programme and wished to withdraw from the league; however, they hope to regroup and play in Marine Harvest South Div 2 next season. All results involving Kilmory were removed from the league as one of their remaining fixtures could have affected the outcome of the title.

He is the 12th Imam according to the Isma'ili faith.  History  Al-Qa'im was born in Salamiyah in Syria in 895 with the name Muhammad. After his father Abd Allah al-Mahdi Billah (910-934) seized power in Ifriqiya he was named heir to the throne in 912, and helped put down several revolts. However, campaigns into Egypt (in 914‚Äì915 and 919‚Äì921) faltered against the resistance of the Abbasids, with heavy casualties. In 934 Al-Qa'im succeeded his father as Caliph, after which he never again left the royal residence at Mahdia. Nevertheless, the Fatimid realm became an important power in the Mediterranean. After the re-conquest of Sicily the Byzantine province of Calabria and the Ligurian coast was plundered and the city of Genoa sacked. From 944 to 947 the realm was plunged into crisis by the revolt of Abu Yazid, who had united the Kharijite Berber tribes of the Aur√®s Mountains of eastern Algeria and overrun Ifriqiya. Imam Al-Qa'im was able to hold out in Mahdia with the help of the navy for over a year, but died (13th Shawwal 334 AH (Mahdiyya)/17 May 946) before the revolt could be put down. He was succeeded by his son Ismail al-Mansur (r. 946-953). Family He was married already at an early age, before his family left Salamiya. His wife, Umm Habiba, apparently was still a child when she accompanied him to the Maghreb. He also had six known concubines, of which one, Karima, became the mother of his successor al-Mansur.

A history of Croatia. Philosophical Library, 1973. p99. He was part of the court of three people that governed the rebels. Biography The name Matija first appears in the work of the Hungarian historian Mikl√≥s Istv√°nffy in 1622. Probably Istv√°nffy attributed this name to him after the good King Matija, and later the two, and the peasant king, Gy√∂rgy D√≥zsa (leader of the Hungarian peasant revolt in 1514), merged in folk traditions. Before the revolt, Gubec was a serf on the estate of the landowner Ferenc Tahy. When the revolt erupted, the peasants elected him to be one of the leaders, and renowned for his personal qualities, he became the most influential leader of the rebellion. During his brief tenure he showed ability as a capable administrator and inspiring leader that would later create a legend. He earned the nickname Gubec Beg. Matija Gubec led the peasant army during its last stand at the Battle of Stubiƒçko Polje on 9 February 1573. Before the battle he made a speech trying to convince the men that only victory could bring them freedom, while the defeat would bring more misery. After the defeat he was captured and taken to Zagreb. On 15 February he was publicly tortured, being forced to wear a red-hot iron crown, cruelly dragged along the streets of the city, pinched with red-hot iron pincers, and was subsequently quartered.Oto Lothar et al. The land between: a history of Slovenia. Frankfurt: Internationaler Verlag der Wissenschaften, 2008. p214. Legacy While Matija Gubec's cause was defeated, his legacy continued to be preserved in local folklore throughout the centuries. In the 20th century, the Croatian Peasant Party, and later Josip Broz Tito and the Yugoslav Partisans, embraced his cause as their own. During World War II, a Croatian and Slovenian brigade were named after him. He is also depicted as the protagonist of Gubec-beg (1975), the first Croatian rock opera. A museum of Croatian-Slovenian peasant revolt led by him is founded in Or≈°iƒá Castle in Gornja Stubica, near the place of his last battle. In 2008, a total of 362 streets in Croatia were named after Matija Gubec, making him the most common person eponym of streets in the country.

Early life  Philippe was born in Sceaux, Hauts-de- Seine, south of Paris, the son of Lucien de La Gu√™pi√®re, clerk of the works at the ch√¢teau de Sceaux, where the architect employed by Louis XIV's natural son, the duc du Maine, had been his uncle, Jacques de La Gu√™pi√®re (1670‚Äì1734). Apparently having followed the architectural courses of the theoretician Jacques-Fran√ßois Blondel, from the 1730s La Gu√™pi√®re took courses in architecture in Paris. He attended the Acad√©mie royale d'architecture. In 1750 he issued his engraved folio volume Plans, coupes et √©l√©vations de diff√©rents palais et √©glises. That same year Leopoldo Retti, who was engaged in building the Neues Schloss in Stuttgart for Karl Eugen, made an artistic reconnoitering trip to Paris, in the company of the duke's garden designer Hemmerling. In Paris he oversaw the engraving of a suite of four folio sheets of the floorplan, section, elevations and profiles of the schloss that was being built. In Paris he may have encountered La Gu√™pi√®re. At any rate, in 1752 Karl Eugen named La Gu√™pi√®re architect to his court of W√ºrttemberg, to fill the post left empty by the unexpected death of Retti, in September the previous year. La Gu√™pi√®re was one of the group of French-trained architects, like Fran√ßois de Cuvilli√©s in Munich, who brought the latest French style to the small German courts. He was occupied with works at the ducal Residenz of Stuttgart, the Neues Schloss that was built adjacent to the former palace , and also at that of Karlsruhe. He was also responsible for the palatial retreat Schloss Solitude near Stuttgart and the waterside Schloss of Monrepos in the grounds of Ludwigsburg (1760‚Äì64).  In Stuttgart  At Stuttgart La Gu√™pi√®re lost little time in engraving and publishing further designs. His Recueil de diff√©rens projets d‚Äôarchitecture repr√©sentant plusieurs monuments publics et autres (Stuttgart, Jean Nicolas Stoll) was published on 11 December 1752. Like his Paris engravings, it broke with earlier traditions of architectural treatises by featuring just the works of a single architect (Klaiber). La Gu√™pi√®re's work at the Stuttgart Neues Schloss was never completed. By 1756 the shell of the wing that faced the city was completed, the central Mittelbau erected and the interior decoration in the garden wing was complete. First the garden wing was destroyed by fire in 1762, then Karl Eugen faced opposition over his extravagance and abandoned Stuttgart for Ludwigsburg. The Neues Schloss was bombed to a ruin in World War II and has been rebuilt as a shell with modern interiors and some reproduced reception rooms . At Ludwigsburg Palace, the alternate seat of the duke, La Gu√™pi√®re was occupied in 1757‚Äì1758, in providing a court theater and in refurbishing the main block of the palace. Here the palace was not badly damaged in World War II. The theatre retains its stage machinery constructed under the direction of La Gu√™pi√®re, the oldest surviving stage machinery preserved in Europe. The water pavilion Monrepos was built from 1755 and completed in 1764 [Hlawtsch 1991]. Return to Paris  He left W√ºrttemberg in 1768, with Schloss Solitude almost completed, to return to Paris, where he was one of the first architects to turn away from Rococo, developing his style towards the Go√ªt grec the \\"Greek taste' that was the early forerunner of neoclassicism. His folio volume Recueil d'esquisses d'architecture was issued from Paris in 1765. La Gu√™pi√®re was the architect of the neoclassical h√¥tel de ville of Montb√©liard in Franche-Comt√©, where his patron Karl Eugen was stathouder. The corps de logis of the ch√¢teau was also rebuilt in more stylish and commodious fashion. His works in France include interiors (since replaced) for the former biblioth√®que Sainte-Genevi√®ve. A pavilion to contain a menagerie at the Ch√¢teau de Sceaux, sometimes credited to him, was built by Jacques de La Gu√™pi√®re. He died in Paris. The only monograph devoted to La Gu√™pi√®re is Hans Andreas Klaiber's Der W√ºrttembergische Oberbaudirektor Philippe de La Gu√™pi√®re: Ein Beitrag zur Kunstgeschichte der Architektur am Ende des Sp√§tbarock, published in Stuttgart in 1959.

The Truth at Last is a Holocaust denial pamphlet allegedly written by British National Front member Richard Verrall under the pseudonym Richard E. Harwood and published in 1974 by neo-Nazi propagandist Ernst Z√ºndel, another Holocaust denier and pamphleteer. The NF denied that Verrall was the author in a 1978 edition of World in Action. In 1983, Holocaust survivor Sabina Citron began a private prosecution under s.181 of the Canadian Criminal Code against Z√ºndel, charging him with spreading false news.Criminal Code, RSC 1970, c C-34, s 171 (now s 181 of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-26). She was subsequently joined in her proceedings against Z√ºndel by the government of Ontario. The Supreme Court concluded in the 1988 trial that \\"The pamphlet Did Six Million Really Die? does not fit with received views of reality because it is not part of reality.\\" Claims In the work, Verrall doubts the Holocaust death toll, criticising the claim which says that \\"no less than six million Jews exterminated\\" in concentration camps. The booklet targets various war crime trials, the best known of these being the Nuremberg trials and the Adolf Eichmann trial, criticising their legal integrity and the standards of evidence presented, as well as the impartiality and objectivity of the judges. Verrall also attempts to demonstrate in the book that censuses and population charts show that the European Jewish population figures do not allow for a figure of six million Jews to have been exterminated. He argues that the total Jewish population in Nazi-controlled Europe after emigrations and evacuations was \\"around three million\\". He further argues that the scale of the Holocaust had been exaggerated by the Allies # to hide their own guilt over such things as the atomic bombs dropped on Japanese cities, the air raids of predominantly civilian towns such as Dresden, and the Allies' own human-rights abuses # and as a pretext for the establishment of the state of Israel, which he predicates on the commission of atrocities against the Palestinian population.\\"Did Six Million Really Die? The Truth At Last\\" by Richard Verrall Verrall's aim is to argue that the history of the 'six million' holocaust is used to discourage any form of nationalism and is a danger to the preservation of the Anglo-Saxon race: \\"No one could have anything but admiration for the way in which the Jews have sought to preserve their race through so many centuries, and continue to do so today. In this effort they have frankly been assisted by the story of the Six Million, which, almost like a religious myth, has stressed the need for greater Jewish racial solidarity. Unfortunately, it has worked in quite the opposite way for all other peoples, rendering them impotent in the struggle for self-preservation.\\"'Did Six Million Really Die?' by Richard E. Harwood (AKA Verral). Introduction, pg4. AAARGH online edition, 2005 In discussing the Gerstein report, the pamphlet states that \\"Gerstein's sister was congenitally insane and died by euthanasia\\", effectively admitting the mass murder of civilians by the Nazis in the T4 program. In writing his booklet, Verrall had used material published in the 1950s and 1960s and most of the inaccuracies of his booklet were errors originally made by Paul Rassinier whose works Verrall had used extensively.'Did Six Million Really Die?

Supreme Court of Canada case The booklet was examined by the Supreme Court of Canada in 1985 and 1988 in the prosecution of the publisher Z√ºndel under the Criminal Code, section 181, of spreading false news. The 1985 conviction was overturned on appeal, leading to a second prosecution in 1988 which again resulted in a sentence of 15 months. As part of Z√ºndel's legal defence, Z√ºndel hired Fred A.

Edited by Barbara Kulaszka At the trial, Leuchter was required to defend his report in his capacity as expert witness; however, he was dismissed because during the proceedings it became apparent that he had neither the qualifications nor experience to act as such. The 1988 trial judge concluded that the booklet \\"misrepresented the work of historians, misquoted witnesses, fabricated evidence, and cited non-existent authorities.\\" The Supreme Court did find that in the previous lower court trial, the jury were improperly instructed: > The jury was instructed that it was entitled to infer from the judge's > instruction that because the Holocaust must be regarded as proven, the > accused must have known it to be proven and must be taken to have published > his pamphlet deliberately for personal motives, knowing the falsity of his > assertion to the contrary. ... The verdict flowed inevitably from the > indisputable fact of the publication of the pamphlet, its contents' > divergence from the accepted history of the Holocaust, and the public > interest in maintaining racial and religious tolerance. However, in reviewing the proceedings of the lower court trial, the Supreme Court were convinced that the facts in the pamphlet were indeed false: > [During the previous trial] the appellant's allegations of fact in the > pamphlet were divided into 85 extracts and rebutted one by one. The trial > judge summarized this material at length for the jury but it will suffice > here to point only to some of the more egregious examples.

Royalties Anthony Hancock re-published Did Six Million Really Die? and made a significant amount of money from doing so, to the point where he was sued for royalties in the High Court in 1982. International reactions In 1975 South African authors Arthur Suzman and Denis Diamond published a book confronting the claims made by Verrall titled Six Million Did Die (Johannesburg). A second edition of the book was published in 1978. The first half of the book seeks to disprove claims made by Verrall and the second to provide further evidence of the Holocaust. In the 1978 official bulletin, entitled \\"False Propaganda\\", the ICRC denounced Holocaust denial and confirmed that the agency \\"Never published‚Äîor even compiled‚Äîstatistics of this kind which are being falsely attributed to it\\" and stated that its mission was \\"to help war victims, not to count them\\". Verrall also misused ICRC statistics to conclude that the number of people who died in Nazi prisons and camps from 1939 to 1945 was \\"300,000, not all of whom were Jews\\", but this was only in reference to \\"Germans and German Jews\\" and not nationals of other countries, later (and more complete) counts of the dead concord with estimates given by the International Tracing Service and other Holocaust researchers. In 1985 and 1988 Verrall's publisher Ernst Z√ºndel was tried in Canada on charges of \\"false news\\". He was found guilty and sentenced to 15 months in prison. On appeal his conviction was overturned by the Canadian Supreme Court's landmark decision R v Zundel, when it declared that the law under which he had been charged, reporting false news, was unconstitutional.Court decision from the 1992 examination of the book Did Six Million Really Die? was banned in Germany and South Africa.Wyman, David S. & Rosenzveig, Charles H.

It is named after Richard Burdon Haldane, who in 1904 and from 1909 to 1918 chaired committees and commissions which recommended this policy, which has evolved over time since then. The 1904 committee recommended the creation of the University Grants Committee which has evolved via the Universities Funding Council into the current higher education funding councils: Research Councils UK, Higher Education Funding Council for England, Scottish Funding Council and Higher Education Funding Council for Wales. Haldane Principle 1918 In 1918 Haldane's committee produced the \\"Haldane Report\\". The report suggested that research required by government departments could be separated into that required by specific departments and that which was more general. It recommended that departments should oversee the specific research but the general research should be under the control of autonomous Research Councils, which would be free from political and administrative pressures that might discourage research in certain areas. The principle of the autonomy of the research councils is now referred to as the Haldane Principle. The first research council to be created as a result of the Haldane Report was the Medical Research Council.  Haldane Principle 1939-1971  The principle has remained enshrined in British Government policy, but has been criticised and altered over the years. In 1939 J.D. Bernal argued that social good was more important than researchers' freedom in deciding the direction of research. Solly Zuckerman criticised it in 1971 for its artificial separation of basic and applied science, and the consequent elevation of the status of the former. A major revision to the application of the Haldane Principle in British research funding came in the early 1970s with the Rothschild Report of 1971, and its implementation which transferred about 25% of the then Research Council funds, and the decisions on the research to be funded with them, back to government departments, a move later undone by Margaret Thatcher's government.  Haldane Principle 2010  In a written ministerial statement on 10 December 2010 The Minister for Universities and Science (David Willetts) further elaborated on the definition of the Haldane Principle. Broadly he defined the principle that the tactical implementation of government funding, i.e. which projects to fund should be a decision for academics using a process of peer review. \\"The Haldane principle means that decisions on individual research proposals are best taken by researchers themselves through peer review. This involves evaluating the quality, excellence and likely impact of science and research programmes. Prioritisation of an individual research council‚Äôs spending within its allocation is not a decision for Ministers...There are areas where Ministers should have no input: Ministers should not decide which individual projects should be funded nor which researchers should receive the money. This has been crucial to the international success of British science.\\" David Willetts also gave a further definition of how this tactical implementation might be guided. \\"Overall, excellence is and must remain the driver of funding decisions, and it is only by funding excellent research that the maximum benefits will be secured for the nation.\\" David Willetts continued that overall strategic budget setting was the responsibility of government. \\"At the other end of the spectrum there are decisions that ultimately must be for Ministers, albeit informed by external advice; these include the overall size of the funding for science and research and its distribution between the research councils, the national academies and higher education research funding.\\"  Haldane Principle 2017  There is currently a debate about the extent to which the principle is still applied in practice. BBC 24 02 2017: Minister to enshrine protection for research independence The Higher Education and Research Act 2017, which merged the research councils and the research part of the Higher Education Funding Council for England into UK Research and Innovation, enacted the Haldane principle as section 103(3): The ‚ÄúHaldane principle‚Äù is the principle that decisions on individual research proposals are best taken following an evaluation of the quality and likely impact of the proposals (such as a peer review process).Higher Education and Research Act 2017, legislation.gov.uk The law did not use David Willetts definition that \\"Overall, excellence is and must remain the driver of funding decisions, and it is only by funding excellent research that the maximum benefits will be secured for the nation.\\" References Sources * Putting Science and Engineering at the Heart of Government Policy - Innovation, Universities, Science and Skills Committee Contents: The Haldane Principle Today, accessed online at https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmselect/cmdius/168/16807.htm * Duffy, M.P.

Chemistry  Bitumen has a complex and varied structure of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (linked benzene rings), containing a small proportion of nitrogen and sulphur; its hardening in proportion to its exposure to light is understood to be due to further cross-linking of the rings, as is the hardening of tree resins (colophony, or abietic acid) by light, first noted by Jean Senebier in 1782.

Although many activities are hosted by the club, Ferro is mostly known for its football team, currently playing in the Primera B Nacional, the second division of the Argentine football league system. Apart from football, Ferro Carril Oeste hosts a wide variety of sports that can be practised at the club, such as athletics, basketball, baseball, futsal, handball, field hockey, swimming, taekwondo, tennis, table tennis and volleyball.\\"Deportes federados\\", club website , retrieved 21 December 2012 History =The beginning= Aston Villa Always located in Caballito, the club was founded as \\"Club Atl√©tico del Ferrocarril Oeste de Buenos Aires\\" on 28 July 1904, by a hundred employees of the Buenos Aires Western Railway (then Ferrocarril Domingo Faustino Sarmiento). The club was approved and supported by railway managers, so Ferro soon incorporated lands to build its headquarters and sports installations. In 1907, Ferro joined the amateur second division, and in 1912 the team won the promotion to the first division after beating Racing Club in the final game. =The Five Musketeers= At the end of the 1930s, the club emancipated from the railway company, changing its name to Club Ferro Carril Oeste. In 1937 five talented players rose from the youth divisions, forming an offensive line which would be remembered as The Five Musketeers. They were Bernardo Gandulla, Juan Jos√© Maril, Luis Borgnia, Jaime Sarlanga and Ra√∫l Emeal. But those skilled players only played together between 1937 and 1938, due to other clubs acquiring them (Sarlanga would have a memorable run with Boca Juniors). Both Gandulla and Sarlanga together scored more than the 50% of the goals scored by Ferro in the 1937 season Other notable player for the club was Delf√≠n Ben√≠tez C√°ceres, who played from 1941 until his retirement in 1944 scoring 20 goals. Gandulla and Emeal returned to Ferro in 1944 after their stint with Boca Juniors. But despite having such prominent players, Ferro finished last in 1946 season and was relegated to Second Division for the first time in its history. =1950s to 1970s= Primera B championship Ferro soon returned to the first division in 1949, when winning the Primera B title. During the 1950 Ferro finished 6th in 1954 and reached a memorable 4th position in 1959, the best team campaign until then. After being relegated again, Ferro won the Primera B championship in 1963, returning to Primera Divisi√≥n. In the top level, Ferro reached another 4th place in the 1965 tournament. Ferro would be relegated again, returning in 1970 to the first division. The Ferro C. Oeste squad in 1978 that won the Primera B title In 1974 Ferro wore an orange jersey, paying tribute to World sub-champion Netherlands national football team, The Clockwork Orange, finishing 6th in the Torneo Nacional disputed that year. Team's most notable player was central midfielder Ger√≥nimo \\"Cacho\\" Saccardi, who had debuted in 1969 and became a legendary player for the institution. =The Golden Age: 1980s= Ferro had a prominent role in Argentine sports in the 1980s, more specifically in football and basketball. The football team won 2 titles of Argentine Primera Divisi√≥n and played the Copa Libertadores. Otherwise, the basketball team won the Liga Nacional de B√°squet (the Argentine first division league) championship 3 times. In 1979 Carlos Griguol arrived to the club. He later became the most successful coach in the club's history, winning 2 Primera Divisi√≥n titles for the first time and also promoting to Primera players such as Alberto M√°rcico, H√©ctor C√∫per and Oscar Garr√©. In 1981 Ferro finished 2nd, totalling 49 points, just one less than champion Boca Juniors. That same year Ferro reached the Torneo Nacional final although the team was defeated by River Plate (by the same score: 1‚Äì0 in the two matches played). In 1982, Ferro C. Oeste won its first title in Primera Divisi√≥n Ferro finally won its first title at Primera in 1982, obtaining the Torneo Nacional defeating Quilmes in the finals. The squad played 22 matches, won 16 and tied 6. Ferro scored 50 goals and conceded 13. Left wing Miguel Angel Ju√°rez was the top scorer with 22. Other notable players for the champion team were Adolfino Ca√±ete, Alberto M√°rcico, Juan Domingo Rocchia and H√©ctor C√∫per. Although some important players during the 1982 tournament had left (Saccardi, Rocchia, Crocco), Ferro won another Torneo Nacional in 1984, defeating River Plate (with Norberto Alonso and Enzo Francescoli) in the finals (3‚Äì0 and 1‚Äì0). The team played 14 matches, winning 8 and losing only 1, with 5 draws. Ferro scored 32 goals and only conceded 9, being M√°rcico the top scorer with 5 goals. Another important achievement for Ferro was the 2nd place in the 1984 Torneo Metropolitano, finishing with 50 points, only one less than champion Argentinos Juniors. Ferro also played the 1985 Copa Libertadores, being eliminated in the first round by Argentinos Juniors. But Ferro not only won 2 titles in first division, but also set three notable records in the Argentine Primera: * In the 1981 Metropolitano championship, goalkeeper Carlos Barisio set a national record by keeping a clean sheet for 1,075 minutes of football. This included a run of 10 complete games without letting in a goal. * When Ferro won the 1982 Nacional, Ferro also achieved it without losing a single game. In addition, the club was the second team to achieve the feat after San Lorenzo. River Plate and Boca Juniors also achieved this feat later in the 1990s. On the other hand, Ferro has the longest run without scoring a goal. The team went 875 minutes without scoring between the end of the 1998 Apertura and the 1999 Clausura. In 1987 Carlos Griguol left the club, and was hired by River Plate. He had won 2 titles in the first division (who still are the only two championships won by Ferro at the top level of Argentine football) and 2 sub-championships. Griguol returned in 1988, coaching Ferro until 1993. In 1990's Ferro's form gradually declined and relegated to third level in 2001 after two consecutive relegations. Ferro finally returned to second one in 2003. Ferro has a strong rivalry with V√©lez S√°rsfield, so both teams disputed what is known as Cl√°sico del Oeste.

The files of this book helped expose the crimes of the dictatorial period. In 1958, as Venezuela transitioned to democracy, Vel√°squez was elected to the Venezuelan Senate for the state of Tachira, and later to the Venezuelan Chamber of Deputies for the state of Miranda. CIDOB, Ram√≥n Jos√© Vel√°squez M√∫jica He served as Secretary General (Chief of Staff) of the Presidency during the government of R√≥mulo Betancourt. After that, he was part of the National Congress. During Rafael Caldera's Presidential administration, Vel√°squez served as Minister of Communications from 1969 until 1971. From 1984 to 1987 he was President of the Comisi√≥n para la Reforma del Estado (COPRE), the Commission on the Reform of the State. Between 1989 and 1993, he chaired the \\"Comisi√≥n Presidencial para Asuntos Fronterizos con Colombia\\", Presidential Commission for border issues with Colombia (COPAF). At the time of his death, he was a board member of the New York-based Human Rights Foundation. =President= In 1993, as a result of the crisis produced by the impeachment of President Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez, Congress appointed Vel√°squez President of the Republic, finishing the constitutional period in 1994. He served from 5 June 1993 to 2 February 1994. As a highly respected national figure there was general consensus around his name for such a task. In August Vel√°squez held an emergency meeting to respond to the tropical storm Bret's heavy damage that leaves at least 70 dead. About 1,400 workers and volunteers helped in rescue efforts after the mudslides struck Caracas and surrounding areas, assisted by Red Cross volunteers and 800 firefighters. Storm victims were temporarily housed at the Fuerte Tiuna army base. Roads were quickly cleared of debris and mud, although many were not reopened initially due to the threat for additional mudslides. The government was overshadowed by the so-called narcoindulto to trafficker Larry Tovar Acu√±a, in this case the Private Secretariat of the Presidency obtained irregularly signed by the President for the release to a known drug dealer. Other events under his brief government include the bankruptcy of Banco Latino with subsequent leakage of foreign currency abroad and tragedy of Tejer√≠as. Among his governmental measures was the introduction of Value Added Tax as part of the Enabling Act entrusted to the National Congress.  Vel√°squez's cabinet (1993‚Äì1994)  Personal life and death In 1948, Ram√≥n Jos√© Vel√°squez married Ligia Betancourt Mari√±o (1920 ‚Äì 14 July 2008) who served as First Lady of Venezuela from 1993‚Äì1994. On 24 June 2014 Vel√°squez died at the age of 97 from natural causes. He died 5 weeks after former President Jaime Lusinchi did on 21 May 2014.

The Khmer term Khmer kat Chen () is used for people of mixed Cambodian and Chinese descent while Khmer Chen () can mean Cambodian- born citizen of Chinese ancestry. Khmer people constitute the largest ethnic group in Cambodia among whom Chen means \\"Chinese\\". Contact with ethnic Chinese people such as envoys, merchants, travelers and diplomats who regularly visited Indochina verifiably existed since the beginning of the common era. However the earliest record of an ethnic Chinese community in Cambodia dates to the 13th century. As a result of a century-long settlement history people with mixed Chinese and Khmer ancestry account for a sizable portion of the population. Chinese Cambodians also play a leading role in Cambodia's business sector and dominate the Cambodian economy today.China-Cambodia: More than just friends? In addition, Chinese Cambodians have a strong presence in Cambodia's political scene with many high ranking government officials and much of the political elite being of partial Chinese descent.Âçé‰∫∫Âú®Êü¨ÂüîÂØ®Âá†Â∫¶Ê≤âÊµÆThe rise and rise of a Cambodian capitalist History = Earliest verified communities = The earliest records of Chinese settlement dates back to the late 13th century. Yuan emissary Zhou Daguan visited Cambodia in 1296 and authored his detailed and comprehensive Record of Cambodia in which he mentions the presence of Chinese residents at Angkor.Willmott (1967), p. 4 Portuguese seafarers noted the presence of a Chinese settlement in Phnom Penh in the early 17th century.Willmott (1967), p. 5 Around the same time Lim To Khieng, a Chinese privateer made similar observation during his stay in Cambodia while trading and conducting sea raids.Xu and Shen (2005), p. 10 Shortly after the fall of the Ming dynasty in 1644, Chinese troops under the command of Mac Cuu and Duong Ngan Dich encouraged large numbers of refugees from Fujian and Guangdong provinces to settle in Indochina.Willmott (1967), p. 6 The majority of the immigrants were men who eventually married local Khmer women. Their descendants usually assimilated smoothly into the local communities, the economic and social process and personally identified as Cambodians. However, customs were also imported, such as the practice of the Chinese topknot that was practiced until the 18th century.Ny√≠ri, Savel πev (2002), p. 256 = French rule (1867‚Äì1950) = The French first introduced a legislation in 1873 which classified Chinese immigrants as 'Alien Asians' and subjects were subjected to resident taxes. King Norodom introduced a legislative reform in 1884 which required the Chinese immigrants to pay higher resident taxes but there were no legal restrictions imposed for immigrants to take up Cambodian citizenship.Willmott (1967), p. 69-70 In 1891, the French introduced a legislation first introduced by Gia Long in Cochinchina, called \\"bang\\" in Chinese. Five associations were established in Cambodia, each identified by their specific region of ancestral origin in China; Cantonese, Hokkien, Hainanese, Teochew and Hakka. Chinese immigrants were required to register with their association to settle in Cambodia. Each of these associations were led by an elected headman, who would be responsible for maintaining law, order and tax collection duties from their countrymen.Ny√≠ri, Savel πev (2002), p. 257Willmott (1967), p. 71 =After independence= The French system of administering the Chinese Cambodian community was terminated in 1958. During the 1960s, Chinese community affairs tended to be handled, at least in Phnom Penh, by the Chinese Hospital Committee, an organization set up to fund and to administer a hospital established earlier for the Chinese community. This committee was the largest association of Chinese merchants in the country, and it was required by the organization's constitution to include on its fifteen- member board six people from the Teochew group, three from the Cantonese, two from the Hokkien, two from the Hakka, and two from the Hainanese. The hospital board constituted the recognized leadership of Phnom Penh's Chinese community. Local Chinese school boards in the smaller cities and towns often served a similar function. This was to be a high point in terms of the rights of the Chinese minorities. Cambodian independence in 1953 saw a regression in their treatment by state authorities and the previously existing autonomy was eliminated by the new government. However, many private associations - cultural, business-oriented and to do with education - were simply continued by the Chinese communities and clan associations themselves, as these communities still had very significant economic and political power. Anti- Chinese feeling and policies emerged, however, after the coup of 1970 which saw the establishing of a pro-West government which considered the neighbouring People's Republic of China a dangerous threat - and the Chinese minorities in Cambodia as a possible fifth column. The year 1970 thus marks the beginning of almost two decades of severe repression of the Chinese minorities in Cambodia. It was after this point that Cambodian authorities started forcing the closure of Chinese schools and newspapers, requiring the Chinese to carry special identity papers, imposing special taxes on the Chinese and moving towards denying them Cambodian citizenship. While the Khmer Rouge regime appeared to have a more ‚Äòtolerant' ethnic policy initially, it continued to discriminate against the Chinese once it had completed its takeover of Cambodia. The continued discrimination, however, now rested on class rather than ethnic grounds; since the majority of urban Chinese were traders, they were classified as ‚Äòcapitalists' by the revolutionary regime. While there is no evidence that the Chinese were particularly targeted in the Khmer Rouge purges, their population in Cambodia was probably reduced by half in the four years of Khmer Rouge rule; it seems that there was an increased number of anti-Chinese events just prior to the Vietnamese invasion which brought an end to the Pol Pot regime. The establishment of the People's Republic of Kampuchea after the Vietnamese invasion in 1979 was not completely positive for the Chinese minorities. Partly because of tensions between China and Vietnam, the new Cambodian authorities adopted restrictive measures against the remaining members of the Chinese minorities, including banning them from returning to urban trades. In 1971 the government authorized the formation of a new body, the Federated Association of Chinese of Cambodia, which was the first organization to embrace all of Cambodia's resident Chinese. According to its statutes, the federation was designed to \\"aid Chinese nationals in the social, cultural, public health, and medical fields,\\" to administer the property owned jointly by the Chinese community in Phnom Penh and elsewhere, and to promote friendly relations between Cambodians and Chinese. With leadership that could be expected to include the recognized leaders of the national Chinese community, the federation was believed likely to continue the trend, evident since the early 1960s, to transcend dialect group allegiance in many aspects of its social, political, and economic programs. Generally, relations between the Chinese and the ethnic Khmer were good. There was some intermarriage, and a sizable proportion of the population in Cambodia was part Sino-Khmer, who were assimilated easily into either the Chinese or the Khmer community. Willmott assumes that a Sino-Khmer elite dominated commerce in Cambodia from the time of independence well into the era of the Khmer Republic. =Under the Khmer Rouge= The Khmer Rouge takeover was catastrophic for the Chinese community for several reasons. When the Khmer Rouge took over a town, they immediately disrupted the local market. According to Willmott, this disruption virtually eliminated retail trade \\"and the traders (almost all Chinese) became indistinguishable from the unpropertied urban classes.\\"Ny√≠ri, Savel πev (2002), p. 265 The Chinese, in addition to having their livelihood eradicated on the whole, also suffered because of their socioeconomic class. They were mainly well-educated urban merchants, and thus were characteristic of the people whom the Khmer Rouge detested. Chinese refugees have reported that they shared the same brutal treatment as other urban Cambodians under the Khmer Rouge r√©gime but they were not discriminated against as an ethnic group until after the Vietnamese invasion due to the PRC's support of the Khmer Rouge. Several of the most senior members of the Khmer Rouge were themselves of partial Chinese descent, such as Nuon Chea, Ieng Sary, Khieu Samphan, Kang Kek Iew, Son Sen, Ta Mok and even Pol Pot himself. King Sihanouk saw the delineation and repression of Chinese business and identity as nationalism emerged and the Chinese were perceived as threatening to Cambodian sovereignty. During the various regimes between 1970 and 1990, Chinese enterprise and cultural expression was completely banned and destroyed and many ethnic Chinese died or fled the country. =Under the PRK/SOC= Following the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia and the fall of Democratic Kampuchea, the new pro-Hanoi People's Republic of Kampuchea regime lifted some of the oppressive rules imposed on ethnic Chinese by the Khmer Rouge government. Chinese newspapers were allowed and the ban on speaking Chinese at home was lifted. However, partial restrictions and a certain amount of suspicion remained, for the pro-Soviet PRK regime resented China's support for the Khmer Rouge guerrillas fighting against it, now renamed as the \\"National Army of Democratic Kampuchea\\" (NADK). Observers at the time believed that the lingering anti-Chinese stance of the PRK government and of its officials in Phnom Penh made it unlikely that a Chinese community of the same scale as before the Khmer Rouge could resurface in Cambodia in the near future. The conditions for the ethnic Chinese, however, improved greatly under the SOC, the transitional avatar of the PRK after 1989. Restrictions placed on them by the former PRK gradually disappeared. The State of Cambodia allowed ethnic Chinese to observe their particular religious customs and Chinese language schools were reopened. In 1991, two years after the SOC's foundation, the Chinese New Year was officially celebrated in Cambodia for the first time since 1975.Judy Ledgerwood, Cambodian Recent History and Contemporary Society; 1989-1993 State of Cambodia =Modern years= Of particular note is China's economic role in the country, which encouraged Sino-Khmer businessmen to reestablish their past business which were once suppressed by the Khmer Rouge. The modern Cambodian economy is highly dependent on Sino-Khmer companies who controlled a large stake in the country's economy, and their support is enhanced by the large presence of lawmakers who are of at least part-Chinese ancestry themselves. The Chinese language study is increasing in Phnom Penh, with the subject recently added to the national curriculum at the university level. Many Cambodians of ethnic Chinese descent learn Chinese for employment as well as business reasons due to the fact as many Mainland Chinese investors are investing across the Cambodian economy. The position of the Chinese minority has undergone a dramatic turn for the better and the Chinese seem to have regained much of their previous economic clout. For various reasons, including the growing economic collaboration between China and Cambodia and the huge investments being made by Chinese companies, the Chinese community has seen its numbers expand dramatically in the 2000s (decade). There has been a huge growth in Chinese-language schools, often generously supported by the government of China through subsidies, and also in the production of textbooks (in Chinese) that incorporate Cambodian history and seminars for teachers. There may be close to 100 such schools today (2007). One of these private schools claims to be the largest overseas Chinese school in the world, with some 10,000 students. A number of Chinese-language newspapers began to be published in the country after 1993, and state television broadcasting even included a news segment in Chinese after 1998. All of the main political parties in Cambodia now appear sensitive to the clout of the Chinese minority, publishing campaign material in Chinese in the last elections. While this minority faced serious discrimination until the 1980s, it appears that that period has come to an end and that they no longer appear to be victimized by state authorities and are allowed to prosper under Hun Sen. Demographics According to statistics from the Ministry of Planning by the Cambodian government, approximately 15,000 individuals, or 0.1% out of the country's total population of 15 million were identified as ethnic Chinese in 2013. A year later, Chinese associations in Phnom Penh estimates that around 700,000 Cambodians have at least some Chinese ancestry. A government census done in 1962 showed that 163,000 individuals Cambodian nationals were registered as Chinese, which amounted to as much as 3% of the country's population. The ECCC had noted that then-Prince Sihanouk had estimated the Chinese population in Cambodia made up of 300,000 to 435,000 individuals in 1965, while CIA had estimated that there were about 444,000 Chinese in 1975. A University field study conducted by William Willmott in 1961 found that there were 425,000 Chinese in Cambodia, which made up to approximately 7.4% of the total population at that time.Willmott (1967), p. 16 Willmott noted that there is a tendency for some Chinese who have taken up Cambodian citizenship, or Chinese descendants who have assimilated into Khmer society through intermarriages to be identified as Khmer in government censuses.Willmott (1967), p. 110 During the late 1960s and early 1970s the approximately 425,000 Chinese Cambodians represented the largest ethnic minority in Cambodia. However, this number had fallen to a mere 61,400 by 1984. This rapid decline has been attributed to the accumulation of causes like warfare, economic stagnation, the Khmer Rouge era and periods of different regime caused mass-emigration. Official censuses between 2004 and 2008 recorded that Chinese consisted of 0.3% of the country's total urban population and are concentrated mostly in Phnom Penh, while Chinese fluctuated between 0.0% and 0.1% of the country's total rural population between 2004 and 2013. Willmott's study of Chinese in Cambodia's urban and rural areas in 1963 recorded that 59% of the Chinese lived in cities and towns while 41% lived in the countryside. Phnom Penh had a Chinese population of 135,000, or about one-third (33.5%) the city's total population. Origins =Teochew= The Teochew people make up the largest Chinese sub- group in Cambodia and make up about 77% of the Chinese population. About 85% of the Teochews in Cambodia came from the prefectures of Jieyang and Shantou of Guangdong province in China. The earliest records of Teochew immigrants date back to the 16th century when some mutineers under the leadership of the Chinese pirate, Lim To Khieng settled in Cambodia. No significant of Chinese immigration from the Chaoshan region occurred until the 1860s, and the Teochews came to Cambodia in modest numbers in the later part of the 19th century.Xu and Shen (2005), p. 13 Large-scale immigration occurred in the 1920s and 1930s, and the Teochews established themselves as the dominant Chinese sub-group thereafter. Approximately 48% of the Teochews live in rural area, and they made up about 90% of the rural Chinese population.Willmott (1967), p. 17 The Teochews is also the largest sub-group in Cambodia, where some 100,000 out of 135,000 Chinese in 1962 are from this sub-group.Willmott (1967), p. 104 ‚Äì Table A: Chinese Urban Population in Cambodia by province and language group Teochews in rural region of the country generally make their living as village shopkeepers, rural credit moneylenders, rice merchants or as vegetable farmers. In Phnom Penh and the smaller towns, the Teochews are generally import-export Entrepot traders, pharmacists or street peddlars.Willmott (1967), p. 18 The large influx of Teochew immigrants from Thailand into Battambang resulted in the Teochews outnumbering other Chinese dialect groups in the city following its brief annexation by Thailand in 1945 that brought large numbers of Teochew immigrants to move into the city. By the 1960s, the Teochew dialect became the main language of commerce communication usage in the city. Numerous Chinese Cambodian political leaders, entrepreneurs and community figures are of Teochew descent: \\\\- Lao Meng Khin (ÂàòÊòéÂã§): Chairman of Pheapimex Group, Senator and member of the governing Cambodian People's Party \\\\- Pung Kheav Se (Êñπ‰æ®Áîü): Co-founder and Chairman of Canadia Bank, and Economic Advisor to Prime Minister Hun Sen \\\\- Yang Qi Chiew (Êù®ÂêØÁßã): Chinese Cambodian entrepreneur and community figure. Permanent Honorary Chairman of the Federation of Khmer Chinese in Cambodia =Cantonese= The Cantonese are also known as \\"Chen-Catung\\" in Khmer language. They made up the largest Chinese sub-group in Cambodia between the 17th century until the early 20th century.Willmott (1967), p. 7 lived mainly in the city. About 40% of the Cantonese are concentrated in Phnom Penh, while most of the remainder are found in Banteay Meanchey, Battambang, Kampong Cham, Kampong Chhnang and Kratie where they make up at least 30% of the Chinese populace. About 55% of the Cantonese came from the prefectures of Dongguan, Guangzhou and Foshan in the Guangdong province of China.Willmott (1967), p. 20 In the 1880s and 1890s, Chinese real estate developers of Cantonese origin secured building contracts from the French colonial government, to develop brick-and-concrete shophouses in a programme of urban renewal of modernizing Phnom Penh.Muller (2006), p. 65 The Cantonese, who comprised the majority of Chinese Cambodians before the Teochew migrations began in the late 1930s, lived mainly in the city. Typically, the Cantonese engaged in transportation and in the skilled construction trades mainly as mechanics or carpenters. =Hainanese= More than 80 percent of the Hainanese people traced their origins from Wenchang county. People from Hainan settled in Cambodia from the early 18th century under M·∫°c C·ª≠u, who established a trading settlement that spanned modern-day Ha Tien, Kampot province and Sihanoukville. Early Hainanese settlers started off as entrepot traders but turned to pepper trading at the end of the 18th century. They established pepper plantations in Kampot, and became the dominant Chinese sub-group in that province. Smaller Hainanese communities are also found at Sisophon and Sre Ambel. In the 1950s, many Hainanese would then move to Phnom Penh, where, in the late 1960s, they monopolized the city's entire hotel and restaurant business. Hainanese of more humbler socioeconomic backgrounds operated tailor shops and haberdasheries.Willmott (1967), p. 21-23 Several prominent Chinese Cambodian tycoons and entrepreneurs are of Hainanese descent: \\\\- Hann Khieng (Èü©Âº∫Áï¥): Chairman of the Cambodian Petrochemical Company (CPC). \\\\- Ly Yong Phat (ÊùéÊ∞∏Ê≥ï): President and CEO of L.Y.P Group, and Special Economic Adviser to Prime Minister Hun Sen. \\\\- Phu Kok An (Á¨¶ÂõΩÂÆâ): President of Anco Brothers Co. \\\\- Sy Kong Triv (ÂæêÂÖâÁßÄ): President of KT Pacific Group. =Hokkien= The Hokkien sub-group were believed to be the earliest Chinese sub-group to settle in Cambodia. Most of the Hokkiens trace their ancestry back to Quanzhou and Xiamen prefectures in southern Fujian province. The Hokkiens settle mainly in Phnom Penh and Battambang, and many Khmer families in Battambang claimed to have some distant Hokkien Chinese ancestry. The Hokkien community is involved the import-export shipping trade and in banking.Willmott (1967), p. 25-6 They also comprised a large percentage of the country's richest Chinese. =Hakka= About 65% of the Hakka trace their roots back to Meizhou and Heyuan prefectures in Guangdong province. About 70% of the Hakkas are found in Phnom Penh where they are dominant professions in the field of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and shoemaking. Hakkas are also found in Takeo province, Stung Treng and Rattanakiri who consist of vegetable farmers and rubber plantation workers. Hakka communities in the provinces migrated to Cambodia through Tonkin and Cochinchina in the 18th and 19th centuries.Willmott (1967), p. 23-4 In Phnom Penh, the newly-arrived Hakka were typically folk dentists, sellers of traditional Chinese medicines, and shoemakers. Language Many Chinese Cambodian families have their children learn Chinese to reaffirm their Chinese identity as Mandarin has been increasingly the primary language of business for Overseas Chinese business communities. One main factor is due to the rise of China's global economic prominence and many Chinese Cambodian business families see Mandarin as a beneficial asset to partake economic links to conduct business between Cambodia and Mainland China.  Religion  Chinese Cambodians are generally practitioners of Chinese folk religion, which incorporates rituals associated with Taoism, Confucianism and Buddhism. Most Chinese families maintain a small shrine dedicated to at least one or more legendary or historical figure, and popular choices include Kitchen God, Guan Yu, Guan Yin, Matsu and Wang Ye. During festive occasions such as Chinese New Year, Chinese Cambodians would pray at communal temples either individually or as a group. Joss sticks and paper as well as food offerings are used for prayers. On certain occasions such as funerals or fortune-telling, Chinese Cambodians would approach spirit mediums and geomancers. A small minority of Chinese Cambodians follow mainstream Mahayana Buddhism of the Chan denomination. Chinese Cambodian families generally do not practice Theravada Buddhism and send their children to Khmer monasteries, except for those descendants who have assimilated into mainstream Khmer society. In the 1990s and 2000s, there exists a trend among assimilated Sino-Khmer silk merchants who maintain commercial links with Chinese businessmen to re-adopt Chinese cultural and religious practices. They maintain Chinese shrines in their homes and shops, and explained that the adoption of such practices are necessary to forge closer ties with Mainland and Overseas Chinese businessmen.  Trade and industry  Like much of Southeast Asia, ethnic Chinese dominate Cambodian commerce at every level of society. Entrepreneurial savvy Chinese have literally taken over Cambodia's entire economy. Ethnic Chinese wield tremendous economic clout over their indigenous Khmer majority counterparts and play a critical role in maintaining the country's economic vitality and prosperity. The ethnic Chinese community is one of the most socioeconomically and politically influential and powerful communities in Cambodia. The community dominates the entire Cambodian business sector and is economically prosperous relative to their indigenous Khmer counterparts. With their powerful economic prominence, the Chinese virtually make up the country's entire wealthy elite. Within this structure, Cambodia as a plural society where one's place in the economic structure depends on one's ethnic background. Furthermore, the Chinese Cambodians \\"not only form a distinct ethnic community, they also form, by and large, an economic class: the commercial middle and upper class in contrast to the poorer indigenous Khmer majority working and underclass, who have traditionally looked down on commerce. Chinese economic dominance of Cambodia dates back the pre-French colonial kingdoms where Chinese merchants often maintained patron-client relationships with the Khmer monarchy. William Willmot, a Sinologist at the University of British Columbia estimates that 90 percent of the Chinese in Cambodia were involved in commerce in 1963. Playing a crucial economic role in the country, the Chinese control almost all of Cambodia's internal trade and substantial portion of the manufacturing including rice-milling and transportation sectors. Today, an estimated 60 percent are urban dwellers engaging in commerce while the rest of the rural population work as shopkeepers, processors of food products (such as rice, palm sugar, fruit, and fish), and moneylenders. Throughout Cambodian cities, Chinese dominated numerous industries such as retail, hospitality, export-import trade, light, food processing, soft drinks, printing and machine shops. In addition, virtually all of Cambodia's richest people are of Chinese descent. Rural Chinese businessmen operated general shops that provided ethnic Khmer peasants with essential purchases such as farming supplies, groceries imported from China, sampots and sarongs, bamboo baskets, perfume, kerosene for lamps, alcohol as well as tobacco. Those in the Kampot Province and parts of Kaoh Kong Province cultivate black pepper and fruit (especially rambutans, durians, and coconuts). Additionally, rural Chinese Cambodians also engaged in salt water fishing. In the 19th century, French colonials allowed Chinese-run businesses to flourish due to their laissez faire capitalist policies. Willmott estimated that the ethnic Chinese controlled 92 percent of the Cambodian economy by the mid-20th century. They traded in urban areas and worked as shopkeepers, moneylenders and traditional healers in rural areas, while Chinese farmers controlled Cambodia's lucrative Kampot pepper industry. Chinese Cambodian moneylenders wield considerable economic power over the poorer indigenous ethnic Khmer peasants through usury at an interest rate of 10 to 20 percent per month. This might have been the reason why seventy-five percent of the peasants in Cambodia were in debt in 1952, according to the Australian Colonial Credit Office. Chinese Cambodian entrepreneurs are also estimated to control 70 percent of the industrial investment and are actively engaged in trading, real estate development, construction, small-scale manufacturing, alcohol distilling, hospitality, fast food restaurants, and food processing. Ethnic Chinese also dominate the silk weaving industry where key commercial positions in the Cambodian silk trading networks are completely held in Chinese hands. Cambodia's rice milling industry is completely under Chinese hands and wield a complete monopoly on rice distilling. At the turn of the 20th century, Cambodia's rice mills was completely controlled by the Chinese and was responsible for the nation's entire export of rice. Hierarchies of rice mills were established ranging from the small humble rural rice dealer all the way to the colossal Cholon style rice mills. Many shopkeepers also mixed and diversified other services of value such as lending money and retailing manufactured goods in addition to rice trading. Despite constituting less than 1 percent of the overall population of Cambodia, ethnic Chinese are estimated to control 70 percent of the publicly listed companies on the Cambodian stock exchange. Of the 346 shipping firms listed in the 1963 issue of the Chinese Commercial Annual, a minimum of 267 or 78 percent were owned by Chinese Cambodians with the eight of the top ten businesses being owned by Sino-Khmers. The remainder were either French or state owned but economic preponderance prompted ethnic Chinese businessmen to act as financial intermediaries operating as agents for the French as well as their own. In addition, Chinese investment in Cambodia was second to the French prior to the Second Sino-Japanese war. 95 percent of the internal trade was also under control of the Chinese. Of the 3349 industrial firms listed by the Cambodian Ministry of Industry in 1961, 3300 or 99 percent were controlled by the Chinese with the rest being either state owned or by French interests. Chinese representation of the 3300 strong firms was 90 percent of the total private investment in the aggregate. Industrial firms range from artisan work shops, small scale manufacturing, foodstuff (dry ice, soda pop, or soy sauce) and primary processing of saw milling, rice milling, sugar refining and charcoal burning. Since 1995, Chinese Cambodians have reestablished themselves as the dominant economic players since the fall of the Khmer Rouge by controlling Cambodia's entire import-export shipping, banking, hotel, gold and rice trading, garments, industrial manufacturing and real estate sectors. Market reforms during the mid-1980s have attracted a large contingent of wealthy Overseas Chinese entrepreneurs looking to exploit opportunities in Cambodian property development and general trading. Ethnic Chinese are responsible for pioneering the development of the country's entire small, medium, and large enterprise sector by setting up trading and production firms, restaurants, and stores, as well as establishing virtually all of the country's politically well-connected business groups. Utilizing the bamboo network business model, ethnic Chinese businesses are structured as family businesses, trust-based networks, and patronage arrangements with a centralized bureaucracy. Moreover, social mechanisms that underpin these entrepreneurial trajectories largely derive from family, ethnic, cultural, and patron-client ties based on personalized and informal trust. Confucian Chinese business practices and societal discourses that link ‚ÄúChineseness‚Äù are stereo-typically linked to economic success which is omnipresent in contemporary Cambodia. Ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs continue to remain the driving force behind the modern Cambodian economy with many of them having relatives in government through political connections and business networks in the Cambodia Chamber of Commerce, which is predominantly made up of ethnic Chinese themselves. Entrepreneurial networks, Chinese family clan associations, Chambers of Commerce with business resources are found across the country to assist aspiring Chinese Cambodian entrepreneurs. Furthermore, the opening up of China's global prominence in the world economy has induced the resurrection of ties between the ethnic Chinese in Cambodia and their ancestral homeland in Mainland China. Hun Sen‚Äôs pragmatic, capitalist-oriented vision of rebuilding Cambodia has been an impetus for attracting an influx of foreign capital investment, particularly from Mainland China. Today, Cambodia's ethnic Chinese are now at the forefront of opening up the country's economy as an international Overseas Chinese economic outpost. Much of the foreign investment now entering Cambodia is being channeled through Overseas Chinese bamboo networks. Many members of the Chinese Cambodian business community often act as agents for expatriate Mainland and Overseas Chinese investors outside of Cambodia. Of particular note is Mainland China's economic role in the country, which has emerged to become a dominant foreign player in Cambodia. China's source of external influence in the Cambodian economy has encouraged Chinese Cambodian businessmen to reestablish their past businesses and regain their lost property which were once confiscated by the Khmer Rouge. The modern Cambodian business sector is highly dependent on ethnic Chinese companies who control virtually the country's entire economy and their support is enhanced by the large presence of lawmakers and politicians whom are of at least part-Chinese themselves. Cambodia's lack of an indigenous Khmer commercial culture in the private sector that is dominated entirely by Chinese Cambodians, has encouraged a plethora of Mainland Chinese foreign investment capital into the country. From 1994 to July 2011, Mainland China invested more than US$8.8 billion across the country. The Cambodian government has made efforts to attract hundreds of millions of dollars in investments from Mainland China and Overseas Chinese businessmen as well as marketing the nation's tourism industry to potential Mainland Chinese clients. In addition, Mainland Chinese expatriate entrepreneurs and investors have been coming to Cambodia to acquire Cambodian assets and have invested substantial amounts of capital across the Cambodian economy channeling their financial capital through bamboo networks. The Cambodian Chinese business community has been backed by the Cambodian political elite as much of the country depends on ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs and the pouring of Mainland Chinese investment capital for job creation has added to the globalized value added investment chain in the country. The CPP itself has incorporated many ethnic Chinese who provide financial support to the party with many high government officials and other major political decision-makers being of partial Chinese descent. The position of the Chinese minority has undergone a dramatic turn for the better and the Chinese seem to have regained much of their previous economic clout. The influx of Chinese capital has led to a resurgence of Chinese cultural pride among the Chinese Cambodian community while concurrently creating new jobs and economic niches. Following the transition of Cambodia from socialism to market-driven state- owned capitalist principles, Cambodia's Chinese community began to reassert their cultural identity and economic clout. This reassertion of Chinese identity has blossomed into confident displays of Han Chinese ethnic pride following the influx of Mainland Chinese investment into Cambodia. Since 1990, Cambodia witnessed a rebirth of Han Chinese cultural expression and business boom across the country. Regional trade networks were restored and small and medium-sized businesses have flourished since the introduction of market- driven state-owned capitalist principles in the country. The growing economic collaboration between China and Cambodia and the huge investments being made by Overseas and Mainland Chinese companies in the country have led the Chinese Cambodian community to see its numbers expand dramatically since the turn of the 21st century. The 21st-century Chinese Cambodian community remains a modern well established commercial middle and upper class group. The community remains an insular and tight-knit group that has integrated well into local Cambodian society becoming a stereotypical trope representing socioeconomic success and extreme wealth. As ethnic Chinese economic might grew, Cambodian hill tribes and aborigines were gradually driven out into poorer land on the hills, on the rural outskirts of major Cambodian cities or into the mountains. The increased resurgence of Chinese cultural and economic activity in 21st- century Cambodia has triggered distrust, resentment and anti-Chinese sentiment among the poorer indigenous Khmer majority, many whom eke out a simple living engaging in rural agrarian rice peasantry or fishing in a stark socioeconomic contrast to their modern, wealthier, and cosmopolitan middle class Chinese counterparts, who mainly engage in business, the skilled trades, or white collar professional occupations.

Dembski, a proponent of intelligent design, which sets out to establish approaches by which evidence of intelligent agency could be inferred in natural and social situations. In the book he distinguishes between 3 general modes of competing explanations in order of priority: regularity, chance, and design. The processes in which regularity, chance, and design are ruled out one by one until one remains as a reasonable and sufficient explanation for an event, are what he calls an \\"explanatory filter\\". It is a method that tries to eliminate competing explanations in a systematic fashion including when a highly improbable event conforms to a discernible pattern that is given independently of the event itself. This pattern is Dembski's concept of specified complexity. Throughout the book he uses diverse examples such as detectability of spontaneous generation and occurrence of natural phenomena and cases of deceit like ballot rigging, plagiarism, falsification of data, etc. The filter states that if the thing being examined cannot be explained by regularity, and if it is too statistically unlikely to be explained by chance, and contains an independently given pattern, then it may be attributed to design. Dembski says his concept is useful to those concerned with detecting design in different fields: forensic scientists, detectives, insurance fraud investigators, cryptographers, and SETI investigators, as well theologians and others who argue for the concepts of the fine-tuned universe and the Anthropic Principle.  Reception  The Design Inference is specifically mentioned in the Wedge strategy as an example of accomplishing one of the intelligent design movement's five year goals of \\"Thirty published books on design and its cultural implications (sex, gender issues, medicine, law, and religion). Described by the Discovery Institute as offering \\"a powerful alternative [to Darwinism],\\" the book is touted as being \\"published by major secular university publishers.\\"Wedge document Some scientists from the SETI Institute and other fields, argue that they do not find application for Dembski's explanatory filter and the related concept of specified complexity, but rather base their work upon more prosaic methods and (in the case of SETI) a search for artificial simplicity. In 2000, biologist Massimo Pigliucci criticized The Design Inference in BioScience writing, \\"Too bad he missed the solution to this riddle, which has been proposed several times during the last few centuries, most prominently (and in various fashions) by Hume (1779), Darwin (1859), and Jacques Monod (1971). According to these thinkers, if a given phenomenon occurs with low probability and also conforms to a pre-specified pattern, then there are two possible conclusions: intelligent design (this concept is synonymous with human intervention) or necessity, which can be caused by a nonrandom, deterministic force such as natural selection.\\" Pigliucci wrote \\"Unfortunately, Cambridge University Press has offered a respectable platform for Dembski to mount his attack on 'materialist science' --which, of course, includes evolution. My hope is that scientists will not dismiss this book as just another craze originating in the intellectual backwaters of America. Neocreationism should be a call to arms for the science community. The battle is already raging, and scientists and educators are still not sure if they should even bother paying attention.\\" Marine biologist Wesley R. Elsberry and critic of creationism reviewed the book in 1999. Elsberry described the book as \\"...a slim and scholarly volume, as one expects from a distinguished academic press [with] clear writing, illustrative examples, and cogent argumentation. The work, though, is motivated and informed by an anti-evolutionary impulse, and its flaws appear to follow from the need to achieve an anti-evolutionary aim. The anti-evolutionary bent is not as overt here, though, as it is in other works by Dembski\\". Elsberry criticizes the book for using a definition of \\"design\\" as what is left over after chance and regularity have been eliminated, and for using an argument that excludes natural selection a priori in order to conclude the existence of a designer when in fact natural selection fits Dembski's argument just as easily.

Released in 1982 by Octave-Plateau Electronics (later renamed Voyetra and still later merged with Turtle Beach Systems to become Voyetra Turtle Beach, Inc.), it was one of the first analog programmable synthesizers to be rack- mountable and remains one of the most flexible digitally controlled analog synthesizers. Design The Voyetra-8 is a 19\\" rack-mountable device, 3 rack units high at the face. Most units are bowed at the top and so cannot be placed below other rack mounted equipment more than a few inches deep. It is approximately 16 inches deep in the rack, and weighs around 78 lbs. Rear mounted plugs and a large heat sink make at least 4\\" rear clearance advisable. The front panel has numerous buttons and knobs, which are active in live performance. However, the instrument is more complicated than it looks; there are fourteen \\"pages\\" of controls. Extra \\"pages\\" are accessed by hitting certain shift key combinations, after which most of the front-panel controls change function. These pages are used when setting up the instrument and programming sounds. The rear panel has a mono output and a stereo output. When connected in stereo, one four-voice sound appears at each output if the instrument is in Dual or Layer mode, or the eight voices are each panned in different places between the outputs if the instrument is in Whole-8 mode. The memory, which stores all of the user presets and parameters, can be dumped via MIDI to any sequencer. The dump is not MIDI System Exclusive (SysEx); it is encoded into controller changes and other common MIDI data, which any sequencer can handle. This may seem somewhat unusual, but in the day of the Voyetra, MIDI was in its infancy, and SysEx was not yet a proven strategy for transmitting and storing system information. Architecture The Voyetra-8 has 8 separate programmable analog voice cards. Each produces one voice of the maximum 8. It can store 100 \\"Voices\\", and can play either one 8-voice sound in Whole-8 mode, a different 4-voice sound on each half of the keyboard (or on different MIDI channels) in Split mode, or two 4-voice sounds per note (which could both be the same) in Layer mode. The keyboard mode, key assignment mode, two selected sounds, and a number of parameter trims and tweaks (such as octave shift on either Voice, detune, and cutoff frequency offset) are stored as a \\"Step\\". The instrument can store 100 Steps. Generally, a performer will call up Steps, not Voices, during live performance; each Step will call up two of the Voices and tweak them for the song to be played. Each voice has two VCOs, one VCA, one 24 dB/octave lowpass VCF, two LFOs, two ADSRs, noise generator, sync VCO 1 to VCO 2. (More detailed specs follow.) The specs belie the complexity of the sound architecture, because of the great deal of control the programmer (and the player) has over various aspects of sound production, including key assignment modes, modulation routing, and envelope parameters. = Key assignment modes and envelope parameters = Any polyphonic instrument must use an algorithm to assign available voices to played notes (unless the instrument has enough voices to cover all of the notes). If a player is holding down 8 notes and hits another, does it sound? If so, does it rob the oldest note played or one of the others? If notes are not being held down but still decaying, will they be robbed? If a note is played repeatedly, does the same voice sound again or does another voice trigger, layered on top of the first? Many of the answers to these questions can be set by the programmer using the key assignment modes and envelope parameters. In Whole-8 mode, the Voyetra-8 has 8 voices. In Split mode, it has two sets of four. In Layer mode, it has four. Key assignment modes are stored with the Step, not the Voice. The following are the possible key assignment modes: * Round robin - each note played, or a note replayed, triggers the next voice in numerical sequence. * Round robin with retrigger - each new note played triggers the next voice; a note replayed retriggers the same voice it last used (unless it has since been reused by another note). * Reset - first note played alone triggers voice 1, if second is added voice 2 is used, and so on. * Reset with retrigger - same as Reset, except that a note replayed retriggers the same voice it last used (unless it has since been reused by another note). Extra envelope parameters (besides the Attack time, Decay time, Sustain level, and Release time) also control the way the sound responds to the keyboard. * Release defeat - if enabled, regardless of the release time, stops the sound when the key is lifted. In combination with a footswitch that momentarily turns release defeat \\"Off\\" when pressed, this can be used to provide a Sustain Pedal (sostenuto) effect. (Stored with the Step) * Release gets decay - if enabled, and release defeat is On, when the key is lifted, it releases according to the Decay time instead of the Release time. (Stored with the Voice, separate setting for each ADSR) * ADR - if enabled, eliminates the Sustain portion of the envelope, so once the Decay reaches the Sustain level, Release begins immediately. (Stored with the Voice, separate setting for each ADSR) * Unconditional Retrigger (a.k.a. Reset to Zero) - if enabled, when a voice is retriggered, the ADSR attacks from 0 instead of attacking from where it was. For instance, the sound might have been still audible when the key was lifted and repressed. With Unconditional Retrigger, on the repress the new sound on that voice will start from zero. In combination with one of the \\"retrigger\\" key assignment modes, or perhaps the \\"reset\\" mode, this will have the effect of clearly articulating the start of the retriggered note. (Stored with the Voice, separate setting for each ADSR) = Modulation banks = The instrument contains a sophisticated matrix for the handling and routing of control voltages. There are four modulation \\"banks\\" per Voice. Each modulation bank is independent of the others; within each a modulation source and one or more destinations is chosen, and a controller is selected if it is desired to alter the amount of modulation during live performance. For instance, on modulation bank A, one might choose LFO1 one as the source, VCO1 and VCO2 pitch as the destination, and channel aftertouch (pressure) as the controller. This could add vibrato to the notes when aftertouch pressure was applied to the keyboard. In bank B, one might then choose DC as the source, VCO2 pitch as the destination, and velocity as the controller. This could be used to detune VCO2 slightly relative to VCO1 when a note is struck hard.  Modulation sources  * LFO1 sine * LFO1 square * LFO2 * VCO1 * VCO2 * ADSR1 * ADSR2 * DC (direct current, for producing an offset)  Modulation controllers  * Velocity * Channel aftertouch (pressure) * Joystick +X * Joystick -X * Keyboard tracking * ADSR1 (Banks A, B only) * Noise (Bank C only) * Pedal (Bank D only) Note: Joystick +X and Joystick -X each can be assigned its own MIDI Continuous Controller number. Also, a global parameter setting on the Voy will invert the sense of the Joystick for the left Voice in all Steps that use Split Mode so that the left Voice gets the -X as a positive value. When this is done, the -X controller can be used to positively control modulation on the left Voice, while the +X controller can be used to positively control modulation of the right voice.  Modulation destinations  Note that any combination of multiple destinations can be selected per bank. * filter cutoff * filter Q * VCO 1 * VCO 2 Specs * Polyphony - 8 voice * Oscillators - 2 VCOs per voice (saw, sine, sqr, pw) * LFO - 2 LFOs * Filter - 24 dB/oct low pass resonant filter with ADSR * VCA - 2 ADSR envelope generators * Memory - 100 patches (Voices), 100 Steps Controllers The Voyetra VPK-5 keyboard, if used, is connected to the head using an XLR mic cable. This XLR cable, while compatible with those used by the Voyetra-8's MIDI, do not carry MIDI data. The Voyetra is fully controllable from a MIDI controller or sequencer. The VPK-5 keyboard has a joystick to the left of the keys where the pitch and mod wheels would commonly be found on other synthesizers. Idiosyncrasies * the \\"hot\\" chassis (this makes independent grounding and isolation from the rack and other electronic hardware important) * the fact that the instrument powers up in MIDI OMNI mode (per MIDI spec) * the XLR connectors for MIDI Trivia In New Order's promotional music video for their 1985 single \\"The Perfect Kiss\\", the Voyetra-8 appears in the first scenes of the clip used by band member Gillian Gilbert. New Order used to tour with a rack containing four Voyetra-8s, although two were spares as early units tended to break down regularly. Gary Pozner, keyboard player for Tom Tom Club, also used the Voyetra-8, as his main synthesizer.

A Royal manor in Anglo Saxon times, until the 16th century Condover Manor was in and out of Crown Tenure. In 1586 it was purchased by Thomas Owen, a Member of Parliament for and Recorder of Shrewsbury, from the family of the previous owner, Henry Vynar, a London merchant who had died in 1585. Owen had had a lease of the manor from 1578, and been in lawsuit with the family. For over sixty years from 1946 the Hall was run as a residential school, initially for blind children when owned by the RNIB and latterly under private ownership as a school for autistic children, covering boy boarders and coeducational day pupils. The school and college both closed during 2009.  Construction  Condover Hall from the front driveway Owen died in 1598 before the new Hall was completed and its designer remains a matter of debate. Building accounts record that a John Richmond of Acton Reynald was the original master mason, but by 1591 Walter Hancock had taken over the position. Lawrence Shipway, the builder of the second (not current) Shire Hall at Stafford, also appears to have had some major contribution to the building design. The most compelling evidence can be found in drawings in the Sir John Soane's Museum that seems to prove that the Hall was designed by the influential Elizabethan architect John Thorpe in the early 1590s. Built out of pink sandstone, quarried at nearby Berriewood, Condover Hall has typical Elizabethan two-storey ground-floor rooms lit by tall windows with regular mullions and double transoms. There are fine chimneys, gables and a good example of a strapwork frieze. The grounds are laid out in formal 17th-century style with boxed yew hedges and sandstone balustraded terraces decorated with Italianate terracotta vases. Near the Cound Brook is an amusing flagstaff held by a sandstone gnome. Later years Owned by the Owen family until the late 1860s, the house then passed to the Cholmondeley family, and novelist Mary Cholmondeley (1859‚Äì1925) lived in the hall for a few months in 1896 before moving to London. Her uncle, Reginald Cholmondeley (1826‚Äì1896), owned the house when it was visited by the American writer Mark Twain (1835‚Äì1910) in 1873 and 1879. The house and estate was sold by the family in 1897 to Edward Brocklehurst Fielden, who later sold it in 1926. Local legend holds that no heir to Condover Hall will prosper since the hall was cursed from the gallows by a butler falsely accused of murder: \\"Before Heaven I am innocent, though my master's son swears me guilty. And as I perish an innocent man, may those who follow my murdered lord be cursed.\\" The butler had been condemned by the lies of the son of Knyvett, lord of the manor, who stabbed his father to death. As he stumbled down the basement stairs, Knyvett reached out his bloodied hand leaving an imprint upon the wall which defied all attempts to wash it away ‚Äî the marked stone had to be eventually chipped clean. In 1930 a Great Western Railway Hall Class 4900 steam locomotive, No. 4915 with a 4-6-0 configuration, was named Condover Hall, remaining in regular service until 1965. In the 1980s Hornby toys issued an electric toy replica of the engine. The train used in the Harry Potter films as the Hogwarts Express is an identical Hall class locomotive. On 21 August 1994, Rail Express Systems liveried Class 47/7, No. 47784 was named Condover Hall at the Crewe Basford Hall Yard open day. Second World War Between August 1942 and June 1945 the hall was commandeered by the War Office and pressed into service as the officers' mess for nearby RAF Condover. Residential schools In 1946 the Hall was purchased from its then owner, William Abbey, by RNIB and operated as Condover Hall School for the Blind, a residential facility for children aged between 5 and 18. RNIB built a covered heated swimming pool for use by the pupils. The hall was sold in 2005 to the Priory Group, who opened a residential school for autistic children and a college for young people with Asperger syndrome. The facility opened in 2006, but in 2008 the closure of both sites was announced. Condover Horizon school closed in January 2009, and Farleigh College Condover closed on 23 July 2009. The Hall has undergone a multimillion-pound refurbishment programme to turn it into a well-equipped residential activity centre. Activities provided range from archery, abseiling to a laser maze and dance studio. The Hall intends to encourage physical activities and deliver cross-curricular learning opportunities. There is a Harry Potter themed spell room for younger children. Sports teams and events are hosted using the all-weather sports pitches, indoor sports hall and swimming pool, and the centre provides specific Netball coaching and match weekends. The centre can provide accommodation for 500 residents. With an occupancy of up to 500 people, the accommodation is in newly refurbished buildings throughout the estate grounds.

Moro nation or Moro country). As Muslim- majority ethnic groups, they form the largest non-Christian majority population in the Philippines, and comprise about 5% of the country's total population, or 5 million people. Most Moros are followers of Sunni Islam of the Shafi'i madh'hab. The Moros were once independent under a variety of local states, including the Sulu Sultanate, the Maguindnao Sultanate, and the Confederation of Lanao; withstanding repeated Spanish invasions, the Moro states remained de facto independent up until the Moro conflict of the early 20th century. Upon Philippine independence in 1946, the Moros continued their struggle for self-determination against a predominantly‚ÄìChristian Philippines, culminating in a decades-long insurgency of armed rebel groups, chief among them the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), against the Armed Forces of the Philippines. The Moro people are guaranteed an autonomous region by the Constitution of the Philippines; the establishment of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao however did not satisfy the demands of rebel groups. A ceasefire and successful peacetalks between the Philippine government and the MILF led to the creation in 2018 of a region with greater political autonomy and powers, known as the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. Today, outside of the Bangsamoro autonomous region, the Moro people are a significant minority in other nearby provinces in Southern Mindanao and in the province of Palawan, while small communities can also be found in several metropolitan cities in the Philippines, including Manila, Cebu and Davao. Outside of the Philippines, some Moros remain in areas once controlled by the Sulu Sultanate along the eastern coast of Sabah; others emigrated to neighboring Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei in the late 20th century due to the Moro conflict in Mindanao. Newer communities can be found today in Kota Kinabalu, Sandakan, and Semporna in Sabah, Malaysia, North Kalimantan in Indonesia, and in Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei.  Etymology  Three Moro men from the Sulu Archipelago in the 1900s. The word Moro (a cognate of the English \\"Moors\\") originates as an exonym which, prior to the Spaniards' arrival in the Philippine archipelago, came to be used by the Spanish in reference to Muslims in general. The term originates from \\"Mauru\\", a Latin word that referred to the inhabitants of the ancient Roman province of Mauritania in northwest Africa, which today comprises the modern Muslim states of Algeria, Mauritania and Morocco. With the rise of Mauritania as part of the Muslim Umayyad Caliphate, Muslim armies conquered and ruled much of the Iberian Peninsula from 711 to 1492, for about a total of 781 years in which Spanish became involved in conflicts to reclaim Iberia. The term came to be extended to Muslims in general. The term was similarly applied by the Spanish to the Muslim communities they found in parts of the Philippine archipelago when they arrived. In their struggle for self-determination, the term was later adopted in the names for separatist organizations such as the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), Rashid Lucman's Bangsa Moro Liberation Organisation (BMLO) as well the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). The recently coined term \\"Bangsamoro\\" is derived from the Malay word \\"bangsa\\", (originally meaning \\"nation\\" but altered to denote \\"race\\" in colonial times) with the \\"Moro\\" as \\"people\\" and may also be used to describe both the Muslim- majority ethnolinguistic groups and their homeland. The Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro recognizes \\"Bangsamoro\\" as an identity and called for the creation of a new autonomous political entity called Bangsamoro. Though the term may carry some derogatory connations by some, the term Moro has evolved to become seen as a unitary force especially by the Philippine government, despite opposition from some of the modern Muslim communities in the Philippines who object to the term's origin with the Spanish colonial era. Marvic Leonen, who was the Chief Peace Negotiator for Philippine government with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, has said:  Ethnic groups  The thirteen Muslim-majority Philippine ethnic groups: * Badjao * Iranun * Jama Mapun * Kalagan * Kalibugan * Maguindanao * Palawanon * Maranaw * Molbog * Sama * Sangil * Taus≈´g * Yakan  Society  = Region = Territory of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). Other areas with Muslim populations intended to be part ARMM in accordance with the 1976 Tripoli Agreement, but opposed inclusion through plebiscites. The majority of the Moro people historically reside in the area now called the Bangsamoro region which was commonly called Muslim Mindanao in 1989 when the ARMM was created. That land is located in the provinces of Basilan, Cotabato, Compostela Valley, Davao del Sur, Lanao del Norte, Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Palawan, Sarangani, South Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat and Sulu, Tawi-Tawi. It includes the cities of Cotabato, Dapitan, Dipolog, General Santos, Iligan, Marawi. The eastern part of a territory of the former British protectorate in North Borneo (now in the eastern Sabah), which have since become part of the federation of Malaysia, is also claimed by the Moro National Liberation Front for the proposed state of Bangsamoro Republik. However, the idea has failed since the MNLF founding leader Misuari self-exiled himself after clashing with the government in 2013 in Zamboanga City, as he protested the further unilateral changes by the government on the mutually signed 1996 Final Peace Agreement. Misuari was labelled as a \\"terrorist\\" during the siege. On 5 August 2008, after nearly 10 years of negotiation, with all Thebes's associated international bodies all ready to witness a supposed historic event, an attempt by the Philippine government's Peace Negotiating Panel to sign a Memorandum of Agreement on Ancestral Domain with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front through a petition by Settler politicians in Mindanao like Governor Manny Pinol and Governor Lobregat, was then declared unconstitutional by the Philippine Supreme Court. Conflict immediately broke out on the ground following the decision, with nearly half a million people displaced and hundreds killed. Observers now concur that two Moro commanders ‚Äî Kumander Umbra Kato and Kumander Bravo ‚Äî did launch attacks in Lanao del Norte and North Cotabato as a response to the non-signing that has shaken the peace process in the region. The Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro defines the Bangsamoro to be who at the time of conquest and colonization were considered natives or original inhabitants of Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago and its adjacent islands including Palawan, and their descendants whether of mixed or of full blood\\". = Culture = kris ‚Äì (Kampilan) is the weapon of the indigenous people of Mindanao. barong ‚Äì (Kifing) is one of several significant weapons of the indigenous people in the southern Philippines. Islam is the most dominant influence on the Moro cultures since the era of the Sultanate of Maguindanao and Sulu. Large and small mosques can be found all over the region. In accordance with Islamic Law, alcohol consumption must be avoided at all cost, fornication is prohibited. Pork and pork byproducts are not permissible. Fasting during Ramadan and providing charity for the poor are mandatory in Islam. The Hajj is also a major requirement as it is one of the five pillars of Islam. Moro women cover themselves using a veil (tudong) just as in Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, Singapore and southern Thailand. Moro men, especially the elderly, can always be seen wearing a black skull cap called the songkok or the white one called the taqiyah. Differentiating from their Malay relatives in neighboring countries, the only main problems associated with Moro groups is that they are not always united and lack a sense of solidarity. = Music = Maguindanaon Indigenous people performing on the agung using two balus. The culture of the Moros of Mindanao revolves around the music of the kulintang, a type of gong instrument, akin to the drum instrument, yet wholly made of bronze or brass found in the southern Philippines. This creates a unique sound that varies in the speed it is hit which includes the Binalig, Tagonggo and the Kapanirong plus others more also normally heard in Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei. = Ethnic groups = There are at least thirteen ethnic groups referred to as Moros; all descended from the same Austronesian people (Malayo-Polynesian) theorized to have migrated from Taiwan and populated the regions of the Philippines, Southeast Asia, the Pacific islands and Madagascar. Three of these groups make up the majority of those classified as Moros. They are the Maguindanaon of North Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat and Maguindanao provinces, the Maranao of the Lanao provinces and the Taus≈´g of the Sulu Archipelago. Smaller groups include the Banguingui, Samal and the Bajau of the Sulu Archipelago; the Yakan of Basilan and Zamboanga del Sur, the Illanun of Lanao provinces and Davao and Sangir of Davao, the Molbog of southern Palawan and the Jama Mapuns of Cagayan de Tawi-Tawi Island. These indigenous people from the south mostly converted to the religion of Islam making them Muslims or Moros. Some of them converted over to Christianity and other religions. = Languages = Distribution of languages of the indigenous peoples. In the Philippines, people are mostly native speakers of a variety of Austronesian languages. The most-spoken native languages of the Moros are Maguindanaon, Taus≈´g and Maranao. The Maguindanao language is spoken in the Maguindanao Province, the Maranao language is predominant in the Lanao region, and is the majority spoken in Lanao del Sur, and the Tausug language is spoken in the Sulu Archipelago with speakers in the Zamboanga Peninsula and the Malaysian state of Sabah. Other Austronesian languages spoken by their respective ethnolinguistic groups are the Sama-Bajau languages (although the Banguingui, the Samal and the Badjao share the same language, there ends the similarity; they are different in all other aspects especially when it comes to religion), as well as Yakan and Kalagan. Also spoken among the Moros of Mindanao and Sulu is Tagalog (Filipino), it being the national language and lingua franca of the Philippines. There also exists a native Tagalog Muslim community in the Quiapo District of Metro Manila. Because of the mass influx of Cebuano migrants to Mindanao, many tend to be exposed to the Cebuano language from Visayans easily enough to be able to speak it. A sizeable minority speaks Malay, also an Austronesian language which was once the lingua franca of maritime Southeast Asia prior to contact with the European colonial powers. Today, many Moro merchants use Malay to converse with citizens of the neighboring Malay-speaking nations of Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei. Most of the Malay-speaking Muslims of the Philippines are those in the southern parts of the Zamboanga Peninsula, the Sulu Archipelago and the southern predominantly Muslim-inhabited municipalities of Bataraza and Balabac in Palawan. They likely speak a form of Malay creole. Many of the Taus≈´g in Malaysia and Indonesia (known there as Suluks) tend to lose their proficiency in both Taus≈´g and Chavacano, as well on Tagalog, as they became assimilated into the Malay-speaking majority of Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei. Chavacano (sometimes spelled as Chabacano or Chabakano) refers to a number of Philippine Spanish-based creole varieties found in the Philippines. The Zamboangue√±o variety, originating in Zamboanga city, is the variety with the most speakers. A number of Moros have also attained the ability to speak this language depending on exposure, especially those that live in Zamboanga and Basilan. Chavacano also contains communities of speakers in Semporna, Sabah. Arabic, being the liturgical language of Islam, is spoken by a small number of Moros. Most Filipino Muslim people, however, do not know Arabic beyond its religious uses. All native languages are written in the Latin script. However, an Arabic script known as Jawi has traditionally been used to write Taus≈´g language. = Education = Generally, Moros are educated. While the majority of Moros attend both government and private educational institutions especially in key cities such as Davao, Cebu and Manila, some may choose formal Islamic education and are enrolled in Islamic/Arabic institutions like the Jamiatul Mindanao Al-Islamie in Marawi City. At the tertiary level, there are government and privately run educational institutions in the traditionally Moro-inhabited areas. In Marawi, many attend Mindanao State University, the second-biggest state university in the Philippines next to University of the Philippines, which has several campuses across Mindanao. Mindanao State University also has an Islamic Institute within its campus (the King Faisal Centre for Islamic Arabic, Asian Studies). With the assistance of scholarship grants, some even attend university outside the country.  History  = Early history = Moro pirates during the era of the Sultanate of Sulu. In the 13th century, the arrival of Muslim missionaries from the Persian Gulf, in particular Makhdum Karim, in Tawi-Tawi initiated the conversion of the native population to Islam. Trade between other sultanates in Brunei, Malaysia and Indonesia helped establish and entrench the Islamic religion in the southern Philippines. In 1457, the introduction of Islam led to the creation of Sultanates. This included the sultanates of Buayan, Maguindanao and the Sultanate of Sulu, which is considered the oldest Muslim government in the region until its annexation by the United States in 1898. Like Brunei, Sulu and other Muslim sultanates in the Philippines were introduced to Islam through Chinese Muslims, Persians, and Arab traders. Chinese Muslim merchants participated in the local commerce, and the Sultanate had diplomatic relations with Ming Dynasty China. As it was involved in the tribute system, the Sulu leader Paduka Batara and his sons moved to China, where he died and Chinese Muslims subsequently brought up his sons. The inhabitants of pre-Hispanic Philippines practised Islam and Animism. The Malay kingdoms interacted, and traded with various tribes throughout the islands, governing several territories ruled by leaders called Rajah, Datu and Sultan. Before the arrival of Islam the Rajahs and Datus governed the territories. = Colonial period =  Spanish conquest  Christian Filipinos who served under the Spanish army in Mindanao searching for Moros in their battle against the Moro Muslim in 1887. In 1519, the Spanish expedition to the East Indies began in search for a westward route to the Maluku Islands (the \\"Spice Islands\\"), led by Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan. The fleet reached the Philippine archipelago in March 1521 where Magellan was to die during the Battle of Mactan and before the expedition's successful circumnavigation and return. Several subsequent expeditions to the islands were sent until the 1564 Miguel Lopez de Legazpi was successful, marking the start of Spanish colonization of what is now the Philippines in 1565. The sultanates, however, actively resisted the Spaniards. With intentions of pacifying the islands, the Spaniards made incursions into Moro territory. They also began erecting military stations and garrisons with Catholic missions, which attracted Christianised natives of civilian settlements. The most notable of these are Zamboanga and Cotabato. Spain was in the midst of the Inquisition which required Jews and Muslims to convert to Roman Catholicism or leave or face the death penalty; thus Spaniards tried to ban and suppress Islam in areas they conquered. Feeling threatened by these actions, the Moros decided to challenge the Spanish government. They began conducting raids on Catholic coastal towns. These Moro raids reached a fevered pitched during the reign of Datu Bantilan in 1754. baptizing a Moro convert to Roman Catholicism, circa 1890. The Spanish‚ÄìMoro Conflict started at the phase of Castille War (Spanish-Bruneian War) of 1578, which created the war between Spaniards and Moros in areas held by Sultanate of Brunei, lasted several hundred years, while the Castille War itself lasted only two months. The string of coastal fortifications, military garrisons and forts built by the Spaniards ensured that these raids, although destructive to the Philippine economies of the coastal settlements, were eventually stifled. The advent of steam-powered naval ships in the 1800s finally drove the antiquated Moro navy of colorful proas and vintas to their bases. It took at least two decades of the presence of the Spanish in the Philippines for them to launch an extensive conquest of Mindanao. The Sultanate of Sulu, one of the last Sultanates existing, itself soon fell under a concerted naval and ground attack from Spanish forces. In the last quarter of the 19th century Moros in the Sultanate of Sulu allowed the Spanish to build forts, but these areas remained loosely controlled by the Spanish as their sovereignty was limited to military stations and garrisons and pockets of civilian resettlements in Zamboanga and Cotabato (the latter under the Sultanate of Maguindanao), until the Spanish had to abandon the region as a consequence of their defeat in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Before that, in order to retain independence, the Sultanate of Sulu had given up its rule over Palawan to Spain in 1705 and Basilan to Spain in 1762; the areas that the Sulu Sultanate gave partial rule to Spain are Sulu and Tawi-Tawi. Spanish troops at mass honoring King Alfonso XIII on his birthday in the Moro town of Momungan (present-day Lanao del Norte Province), Mindanao on 17 May 1892. The presence of Spanish troops since the 16th century massively expanded on the island of Mindanao, threatening the Moros, especially with their Christianisation mission. In 1876, the Spaniards launched a campaign to placate Jolo and made a final bid to establish a government in the southern islands. On 21 February of that year, the Spaniards assembled the largest contingent in Jolo, consisting of 9,000 soldiers in 11 transports, 11 gunboats and 11 steamboats. Jos√© Malcampo occupied Jolo and established a Spanish settlement with Pascual Cervera appointed to set up a garrison and serve as military governor. He served from March 1876 to December 1876 and was followed by Jos√© Paulin (December 1876 ‚Äì April 1877), Carlos Mart√≠nez (September 1877 ‚Äì February 1880), Rafael de Rivera (1880‚Äì1881), Isidro G. Soto (1881‚Äì1882), Eduardo Bremon, (1882), Julian Parrrado (1882‚Äì1884), Francisco Castilla (1884‚Äì1886), Juan Arolas (1886‚Äì1893), Ca√©sar Mattos (1893), Venancio Hern√°ndez (1893‚Äì1896) and Luis Huerta (1896‚Äì1899). wars with Spain and rebellion (Embadir), like this of an 18th or 19th-century brass morion helmet. The Chinese sold small arms like Enfield and Spencer Rifles to the Buayan Sultanate of Datu Uto. They were used to battle the Spanish invasion of the Sultanate of Buayan. The Datu paid for the weapons in slaves. The population of Chinese in Mindanao in the 1880s was 1,000. The Chinese ran guns across a Spanish blockade to sell to Mindanao Moros. The purchases of these weapons were paid for by the Moros in slaves in addition to other goods. The main group of people selling guns were the Chinese in Sulu. The Chinese took control of the economy and used steamers to ship goods for exporting and importing. Opium, ivory, textiles, and crockery were among the other goods which the Chinese sold. The Chinese on Maimbung sent the weapons to the Sulu Sultanate, who used them to battle the Spanish and resist their attacks. A Chinese-Mestizo was one of the Sultan's brothers-in-law, the Sultan was married to his sister. He and the Sultan both owned shares in the ship (named the Far East) which helped smuggle weapons. The Spanish launched a surprise offensive under Colonel Juan Arolas in April 1887 by attacking the sultanate's capital at Maimbung in an effort to crush resistance. Weapons were captured and the property of the Chinese were destroyed while the Chinese were deported to Jolo. By 1878, the Spanish had fortified Jolo with a perimeter wall and tower gates, built inner forts called Puerta Blockaus, Puerta Espa√±a and Puerta Alfonso XII, and two outer fortifications named Princesa de Asturias and Torre de la Reina. Troops, including a cavalry with its own lieutenant commander, were garrisoned within the protective confine of the walls. In 1880, Rafael Gonzales de Rivera, who was appointed the governor, dispatched the 6th Regiment to govern Siasi and Bongao islands.  American colonization  American soldiers battling with Moro rebels. executed by the Americans after the First Battle of Bud Dajo. After the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Spain ceded to the United States administration of the Philippine archipelago, which included Sulu and Mindanao, by the 1898 Treaty of Paris. At the beginning of their administration, American officials began about placating any remaining violence in the Moro areas. The problem of \\"Juramentados\\" persisted in the early 20th century but was eventually successfully stopped by the Americans.  Japanese occupation  The Moros fought against the Japanese occupation of Mindanao and Sulu during World War II and eventually drove them out. Also when the Japanese occupied the northern Borneo area, they also helped their relatives there in a struggle to fight off the Japanese where many of them, including women and children, were massacred after their revolt with the Chinese had been foiled by the Japanese. =Modern days=  In the modern day Philippines  = Philippine government policies = After gaining independence from the United States, the Moro population, which was isolated from the mainstream and experienced discrimination by the Philippine government, added to the fact that they were now governed by what they view as the former foot soldiers of Spain, their ancestral lands given away to settlers and corporations by land-tenure Laws, arming the settlers as militia in Mindanao, Filipinisation was a government policy which eventually gave rise to armed secession movements. Thus, the struggle for independence has been in existence for several centuries, starting from the Spanish period, the Moro rebellion during the United States occupation and up to the present day. Modern-day Moro conflict began in the 1960s. During the period, the Philippine government envisioned a new country in which Christian and Moro would be assimilated into the dominant culture. This vision, however, was generally rejected by both groups, the Christians remembering stories from Spanish foot soldiers of how fierce the Moro was, and the Moro remembering the Christian as aiding its hated Spanish enemy for 300 years. These two prejudices continue to this day. Because of this, the National government realized that there was a need for a specialized agency to deal with the Moro community, so it set up the Commission for National Integration (CNI) in the 1960s, which was later replaced by the Office of Muslim Affairs, and Cultural Communities (OMACC) and later on as OMA. As they thought, concessions were made to the Moro after the creation of these agencies, with the Moro population receiving exemptions from national laws prohibiting polygamy and divorce which the Moro has already been exercising. In 1977, the Philippine government made another palliative attempt to move a step further by harmonizing Moro customary law with the national law which has no bearing at all for the Moro. Naturally, most of these achievements were seen as superficial. The Moro, still dissatisfied with the past Philippine governments' policies and misunderstanding established a first separatist group known as the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) led by Nur Misuari with the intention of creating an independent country. This initiated the modern Moro conflict in the Philippines, which still persists, and has since deepened the fractures between Muslims, Christians, and people of other religions. The MNLF is the only recognized representative organization for the Muslims of the Philippines by the Organisation of the Islamic Cooperation (OIC). By the 1970s, a paramilitary organization created by settler mayors in collusion with the Philippine Constabulary, mainly of armed Hiligaynon- speaking Christian residents of mainland Mindanao, called the Ilagas began operating in Cotabato originating from settler communities. In response, Moro volunteers with minimal weapons also group themselves with much old traditional weapons like the kris, spears and barong, such as the Blackshirts of Cotabato and the Barracudas of Lanao, began to appear and engage the Ilagas. The Armed Forces of the Philippines were also deployed; however, their presence only seemed to create more violence and reports that the Army and the settler militia are helping each other. A Zamboangan version of the Ilagas, the Mundo Oscuro (Spanish for Dark World), was also organized in Zamboanga and Basilan. In 1981, internal divisions within the MNLF caused the establishment of an Islamic paramilitary breakaway organization called the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). The group continued the conflict when the MNLF signed a Peace Deal with the Philippine Government in 1994. It has now become the biggest and most organized Moro armed group in Mindanao and Sulu. The Moro Islamic Liberation Front is now on the final stages of the required annexe for the Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro that has a set time-frame for full implementation in 2016. = Autonomy = Although initialed in a 1976 ceasefire, come 1987 as a fall out of the EDSA revolution, peace talks with the MNLF picked up pace with the intention of establishing an autonomous region for Muslims in Mindanao. On 1 August 1989, through Republic Act No. 6734, known as the Organic Act, a 1989 plebiscite was held in 18 provinces in Mindanao, the Sulu Archipelago and Palawan without considering the effects of continuous migration by settlers from Luz√≥n and the Visayas. This was said to determine if the residents would still want to be part of an Autonomous Region. Out of all the Provinces and cities participating in the plebiscite, only four provinces opted to join, namely: Maguindanao, Lanao del Sur, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi. Even its regional capital, Cotabato City, rejected joining the autonomous region as the settlers has now greatly outnumbered the Moro and Lumad. When before they were a majority, they have now become a minority. This still led to the creation of the ARMM, however. A second plebiscite, held a year more in 2001, managed to include Basilan (except its capital, Isabela City) and Marawi City in the autonomous region. Of the original 13 provinces agreed on the Final Peace Agreement (FPA) with the MNLF, only 5 has now been included in the present-day ARMM due to the continuous settler program of the Republic of the Philippines that started in the earnest of 1901. The ARMM is headed by a regional governor as the outcome of the Final Peace Agreement between the MNLF and the Philippine government in 1996 under President Fidel Ramos. The regional governor, with the regional-vice governor, act as the executive branch and are served by a Regional Cabinet, composed of regional secretaries, mirroring national government agencies of the Philippines. The ARMM has a unicameral Regional Assembly headed by a speaker. This acts as the legislative branch for the region and is responsible for regional ordinances. It is composed of three members for every congressional district. The current membership is twenty-four. Some of the Regional Assembly's acts have since been nullified by the Supreme Court on grounds that they are \\"unconstitutional\\". An example is the nullification of the creation of the Province of Shariff Kabungsuwan by the Regional Legislative Assembly (RLA) as this will create an extra seat in the Philippines Congress' House of Representatives, a power reserved solely for the Philippine Congress ‚Äî Senate and House jointly ‚Äî to decide on. Some would say, that this proves in itself the fallacy of its Autonomy granted by the Central Government during the Peace Process. = Current situation = The Moros had a history of resistance against Spanish, American, and Japanese rule for over 400 years. The armed struggle against the Spanish, Americans, Japanese and Filipinos is considered by present Moro leaders as part of the four centuries long \\"sovereign based conflict\\" of the Bangsamoro (Moro Nation). The 400-year-long resistance against the Japanese, Americans, and Spanish by the Moro persisted and morphed into their current war for independence against the Philippine state. Some Moros have formed their own separatist organisations such as the MNLF, MILF and become a members of more extreme groups such as the Abu Sayyaf (ASG) and Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) and the latest formed is Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighter ( BIFF). Now, even the armed Communist Party has gained its foothold in Mindanao with large Lumad adherents. The Moro Islamic Liberation Front boycotted the original referendum formed by the Organic Act referendum and continued their armed struggle until present. However, it remains a partner to the peace process, with the Philippines unwilling to brand MILF as a \\"terrorist\\" group. Today, the Moro people had become marginalises and a minority in Mindanao, they are also disadvantaged than majority Christians in terms of employment and housing; they are also discriminated. Due to this, it has established escalating tensions that have contributed to the ongoing conflict between the Philippine government and the Moro people. In addition, there has been a large exodus of Moro peoples comprising the Taus≈´g, Samal, Bajau, Illanun and Maguindanao to Malaysia (Sabah) and Indonesia (North Kalimantan) since the 1970s, due to the illegal annexation of their land by the Catholic majority, and armed Settler militias such as the Ilaga which has destroyed the trust between Mindanao Settlers and Moro communities. Further, Land Tenure Laws have changed the population statistics of the Bangsamoro to a significant degree and has caused the gradual displacement of the Moros from their traditional lands. = 2014 Draft Bangsamoro Basic Law = The office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process has posted a set of frequently asked questions about the Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL), the draft of which President Benigno Aquino III submitted to Congress leaders. The Bangsamoro Basic Law abolishes the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao and establishes the new Bangsamoro political identity in its place. The law is based on the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro signed by the Philippine government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front in March 2014. It is still to be implemented by the Government by Congressional mandate.  In Malaysia  Moro refugees dwellings off the coast of Gaya Island in Sabah. Due to their conflict in the southern Philippines, many Moros have emigrated to the Malaysian state of Sabah since the 1970s in search of better lives because of the close proximity between Sulu islands and the state of Sabah. Most of them are illegal immigrants and live in squalor, thus the Sabah state government are working to relocate them into a proper settlement to ease management.  Bangsa Sug and Bangsa Moro  In 2018, a unification gathering of all the sultans of the Sulu archipelago and representatives from all ethnic communities in the Sulu archipelago commenced in Zamboanga City, declaring themselves as the Bangsa Sug peoples and separating them from the Bangsa Moro peoples of mainland central Mindanao. They cited the complete difference in cultures and customary ways of life they have with the central Mindanao Muslims as the primary reason for their separation. They also called the government to establish a separate Philippine state, called Bangsa Sug, from mainland Bangsa Moro or to incorporate the Sulu archipelago to whatever state is formed in the Zamboanga peninsula, if ever federalism in the Philippines is approved in the coming years.

On 21 April 1967, a group of colonels overthrew the caretaker government a month before scheduled elections which Georgios Papandreou's Center Union was favored to win. The dictatorship was characterised by right-wing cultural policies, restrictions on civil liberties, and the imprisonment, torture, and exile of political opponents. An attempt to renew its support in a 1973 referendum on the monarchy and gradual democratisation was ended by another coup by hardliner Dimitrios Ioannidis. The junta's rule ended on 24 July 1974 under the pressure of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, leading to the Metapolitefsi (\\"regime change\\") to democracy and the establishment of the Third Hellenic Republic. Background The 1967 coup and the following seven years of military rule were the culmination of 30 years of national division between the forces of the left and the right, that can be traced to the time of the resistance against Axis occupation of Greece during World War II. After the liberation in 1944, Greece descended into a civil war, fought between the communist forces and those loyal to the newly returned government-in-exile. =American influence in Greece= In 1944 British Prime Minister Winston Churchill determined to halt the Soviet encroachment in the Balkans, and ordered British forces to intervene in the Greek Civil War (see Dekemvriana) in the wake of the retreating German military. This was to be a lengthy and open ended commitment. The United States stepped in to help the Greek government against the communist forces in 1947. Phoenix rising from its flames and the silhouette of the soldier bearing a rifle with fixed bayonet was the emblem of the Junta. On the header the word Greece (ŒïŒªŒªŒ±œÇ) and on the footer 21 April 1967, the date of the coup d'√©tat, can be seen in Greek. In 1947, the United States formulated the Truman Doctrine, and began actively supporting a series of authoritarian governments in Greece, Turkey, and Iran in order to ensure that these states did not fall under Soviet influence.Perkins, Bradford; Cohen, Warren; LaFeber, Walter; Iriye, Akira (1995). The Cambridge History of American Foreign Relations: Volume 4, America in the Age of Soviet Power, 1945‚Äì1991. Cambridge University Press. In 1945, officer veterans of the collaborationist Security Battalions had organized themselves into a secret society known as the IDEA (Ieros Desmos Ellinon Axiomatikon-Holy Bond of Greek Officers).Simpson, Christoper Blowback: America's Recruitment of Nazis and Its Effects on the Cold War, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1988 p.81 From 1947 onward, the Holy Bond was subsidized to the sum of $1 million annually by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as one of Greece's main \\"democratic\\" (i.e. anti-communist) forces. Several of the future leaders of the junta such as Georgios Papadopoulos were members of IDEA. With American and British aid, the civil war ended with the military defeat of the communists in 1949. The Communist Party of Greece (KKE) and its ancillary organizations were outlawed (Law 509/1947), and many Communists either fled the country or faced persecution. The CIA and the Greek military began to work together closely, especially after Greece joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1952. This included notable CIA officers Gust Avrakotos and Clair George. Avrakotos maintained a close relationship with the colonels who would figure in the later coup.Charlie Wilson's War, George Crile, 2003, Grove/Atlantic. In 1952, IDEA issued a manifesto stating that a dictatorship was the only possible solution to Greece's problems, which the Greek scholar Christos Kassimeris called an \\"astonishing\\" statement since the Communists had been defeated in 1949, Greece was enjoying relative prosperity after living standards had collapsed in the 1940s, and Greek politics were stable.Kassimeris, Christos Greece and the American Embrace: Greek Foreign Policy Towards Turkey, the US and the Western Alliance, London: I.B.Tauris, 2009 p.75 Kassimeris argued that since Papadopoulos played a large role in writing the 1952 manifesto, that it was his \\"personal ambition\\" rather than an objective fear of the Greek Communists that was driving him forward because in no way could Greece be presented as being on the brink of a Communist take- over in 1952. Greece was a vital link in the NATO defense arc which extended from the eastern border of Iran to the northernmost point in Norway. Greece in particular was seen as being at risk, having experienced a communist insurgency. In particular, the newly founded Hellenic National Intelligence Service (EYP) and the Mountain Raiding Companies (LOK) maintained a very close liaison with their American counterparts. In addition to preparing for a Soviet invasion, they agreed to guard against a left-wing coup. The LOK in particular were integrated into the European stay-behind network.Ganser, Daniele (2005).

Nevertheless, the United States did support the military dictatorship.\\"Clinton Says U.S. Regrets Aid to Junta in Cold War \\", Los Angeles Times, 21 November 1999, https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-nov-21-mn-35991-story.html =Apostasia and political instability= After many years of conservative rule, the election of the Centre Union's Georgios Papandreou as Prime Minister was a sign of change. In a bid to gain more control over the country's government than his limited constitutional powers allowed, the young and inexperienced King Constantine II clashed with liberal reformers. In July 1964, Papandreou announced his intention to fire those officers belonging to IDEA, whom the king did not want dismissed, claiming it was his royal prerogative to protect the IDEA officers, which in turn led to massive demonstrations in Athens, which had a republican flavor.Kassimeris, Christos Greece and the American Embrace: Greek Foreign Policy Towards Turkey, the US and the Western Alliance, London: I.B.Tauris, 2009 p.46 The king dismissed Papandreou in 1965, causing a constitutional crisis known as the \\"Apostasia of 1965\\". After making several attempts to form governments, relying on dissident Centre Union and conservative MPs, Constantine II appointed an interim government under Ioannis Paraskevopoulos, and new elections were called for 28 May 1967. There were many indications that Papandreou's Centre Union would emerge as the largest party, but would not be able to form a single-party government and would be forced into an alliance with the United Democratic Left, which was suspected by conservatives of being a proxy for the banned KKE. This possibility was used as a pretext for the coup. =A \\"Generals' Coup\\"= Greek historiography and journalists have hypothesized about a \\"Generals' Coup\\",Marios Ploritis, \\"ŒîŒπŒøŒ≥Œ≠ŒΩŒ∑œÇ Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ¨ŒΩŒ±Œ∫œÑŒµœÇ\\" , To Vima, 10 December 2000, (in Greek). a coup that would have been deployed at Constantine's behest under the pretext of combating communist subversion.Stilis Alatos, \\"TŒ± Œ∫Œ±ŒºœÄŒøœçœÅŒπŒ∫Œ±\\", Ta Nea, 15 February 2007, (in Greek).C. L. Sulzberger, An age of mediocrity; memoirs and diaries, 1963‚Äì1972, New York: Macmillan, 1973, p. 575. Before the elections that were scheduled for 28 May 1967, with expectations of a wide Center Union victory, a number of conservative National Radical Union politicians feared that the policies of left-wing Centrists, including Andreas Papandreou (the son of Georgios Papandreou), would lead to a constitutional crisis. One such politician, George Rallis, proposed that, in case of such an \\"anomaly\\", the King should declare martial law as the monarchist constitution permitted him. According to Rallis, Constantine was receptive to the idea.Alexis Papachelas, \\"Everything George Rallis recounted to me\\", To Vima, 19 March 2006 According to U.S. diplomat John Day, Washington also worried that Andreas Papandreou would have a very powerful role in the next government, because of his father's old age. According to Robert Keely and John Owens, American diplomats present in Athens at the time, Constantine asked U.S. Ambassador William Phillips Talbot what the American attitude would be to an extra-parliamentary solution to the problem. To this the embassy responded negatively in principle ‚Äì adding, however, that, \\"U.S. reaction to such a move cannot be determined in advance but would depend on circumstances at the time.\\" Constantine denies this.TV documentary \\"Œ§Œë ŒîŒôŒöŒë ŒúŒëŒ£ 60's ‚Äî ŒúŒ≠œÅŒøœÇ 3Œø: ŒßŒëŒúŒïŒùŒó ŒëŒùŒüŒôŒûŒó \\" by Stelios Kouloglu According to Talbot, Constantine met the army generals, who promised him that they would not take any action before the coming elections. However, the proclamations of Andreas Papandreou made them nervous, and they resolved to re-examine their decision after seeing the results of the elections. In 1966, Constantine sent his envoy, Demetrios Bitsios, to Paris on a mission to persuade former prime minister Constantine Karamanlis to return to Greece and resume his prior role in politics. According to uncorroborated claims made by the former monarch, Karamanlis replied to Bitsios that he would return only if the King imposed martial law, as was his constitutional prerogative.Alexis Papachelas, \\"Constantine Speaks\\", To Vima, 29 January 2006. According to New York Times correspondent Cyrus L. Sulzberger, Karamanlis flew to New York City to meet with USAF General Lauris Norstad to lobby for a conservative coup that would establish himself as Greece's leader; Sulzberger alleges that Norstad declined to involve himself in such affairs.C.L. Sulzberger, Postscript with a Chinese Accent, Macmillan, 1974, p. 277. Sulzberger's account rests solely on the authority of his and Norstad's word. When, in 1997, the former King reiterated Sulzberger's allegations, Karamanlis stated that he \\"will not deal with the former king's statements because both their content and attitude are unworthy of comment\\".Giannis Politis, \\"Œ£œÖŒΩŒµœáŒØŒ∂ŒµŒπ œÑŒπœÇ œÄœÅŒøŒ∫ŒªŒÆœÉŒµŒπœÇ Œü ŒöœâŒΩœÉœÑŒ±ŒΩœÑŒØŒΩŒøœÇ ŒìŒªœçŒæŒºœÄŒøœÖœÅŒ≥Œ∫\\", Ta Nea, 10 May 1997. The deposed King's adoption of Sulzberger's claims against Karamanlis was castigated by Greece's left-leaning media, which denounced Karamanlis as \\"shameless\\" and \\"brazen\\". At the time Constantine referred exclusively to Sulzberger's account to support the theory of a planned coup by Karamanlis, and made no mention of the alleged 1966 meeting with Bitsios, which he referred to only after both participants had died and could not respond. As it turned out, the constitutional crisis did not originate either from the political parties, or from the Palace, but from middle-rank army putschists. Coup d'√©tat of 21 April On 21 April 1967, just weeks before the scheduled elections, a group of right-wing army officers led by Brigadier General Stylianos Pattakos and Colonels George Papadopoulos and Nikolaos Makarezos seized power in a coup d'√©tat. The colonels were able to seize power quickly by using elements of surprise and confusion. Pattakos was the commander of the Armour Training Centre (, ŒöŒïŒ§Œò), based in Athens. The coup leaders placed tanks in strategic positions in Athens, effectively gaining complete control of the city. At the same time, a large number of small mobile units were dispatched to arrest leading politicians, authority figures, and ordinary citizens suspected of left-wing sympathies, according to lists prepared in advance. One of the first to be arrested was Lieutenant General Grigorios Spandidakis, Commander-in-Chief of the Greek Army. The colonels persuaded Spandidakis to join them, having him activate a previously- drafted action plan to move the coup forward. Under the command of paratrooper Brigadier General Kostas Aslanides, the LOK took over the Greek Defence Ministry while Pattakos gained control of communication centers, the parliament, the royal palace, and ‚Äì according to detailed lists ‚Äì arrested over 10,000 people.Ganser Daniele (2005). NATO's Secret Armies: Operation GLADIO and Terrorism in Western Europe. pp. 220‚Äì223 , By the early morning hours, the whole of Greece was in the hands of the colonels. All leading politicians, including acting Prime Minister Panagiotis Kanellopoulos, had been arrested and were held incommunicado by the conspirators. At 6:00 a.m. EET, Papadopoulos announced that eleven articles of the Greek constitution were suspended. One of the consequences of these suspensions was that anyone could be arrested without warrant at any time and brought before a military court to be tried. Ioannis Ladas, then the director of ESA, recounted in a later interview that \\"Within twenty minutes every politician, every man, every anarchist who was listed could be rounded up ... It was a simple, diabolical plan\\". Georgios Papandreou was arrested after a nighttime raid at his villa in Kastri, Attica. Andreas was arrested at around the same time, after seven soldiers armed with fixed bayonets and a machine gun forcibly entered his home. Andreas Papandreou escaped to the roof of his house, but surrendered after one of the soldiers held a gun to the head of his then-fourteen-year-old son George Papandreou. Papadopoulos' junta attempted to re-engineer the Greek political landscape by coup. Papadopoulos as well as the other junta members are known in Greece by the term \\"Aprilianoi\\" (Aprilians), denoting the month of the coup. The term \\"Aprilianoi\\" has become synonymous with the term \\"dictators of 1974\\". =Vatican= According to journalist Eric Frattini the coup d'√©tat was partly funded by Vatican agents who handed over $4 million to Georgios Papadopoulos through an intricate network of banks, as they feared the election of Andreas Papandreou, a leftist politician accused of having sympathies for communism.Frattini, Eric. The Entity: Five Centuries of Secret Vatican Espionage, St. Martin's Press; 1st U.S. Ed edition, 2008, p. 303-304. =Role of the King= When the tanks came to the streets of Athens on 21 April, the legitimate National Radical Union government, of which Rallis was a member, asked King Constantine to immediately mobilise the state against the coup; he declined to do so, and swore in the dictators as the legitimate government of Greece. The King, who had relented and decided to co-operate, claims to this day that he was isolated and did not know what else to do. He has since claimed that he was trying to gain time to organise a counter-coup and oust the Junta. He did organise such a counter-coup; however, the fact that the new government had a legal sanction, in that it had been appointed by the legitimate head of state, played an important role in the coup's success. The King was later to regret his decision bitterly. For many Greeks, it served to identify him indelibly with the coup and certainly played an important role in the final decision to abolish the monarchy, sanctioned by the 1974 referendum. The only concession the King could achieve was to appoint a civilian as prime minister, rather than Spandidakis. Konstantinos Kollias, a former Attorney General of the Areios Pagos (supreme court), was chosen. He was a well-known royalist and had even been disciplined under the Papandreou government for meddling in the investigation of the murder of MP Gregoris Lambrakis. Kollias was little more than a figurehead and real power rested with the army, and especially Papadopoulos, who emerged as the coup's strong man and became Minister to the Presidency of the Government. Other coup members occupied key posts. Up until then constitutional legitimacy had been preserved, since under the Greek Constitution the King could appoint whomever he wanted as prime minister, as long as Parliament endorsed the appointment with a vote of confidence or a general election was called. It was this government, sworn-in during the early evening hours of 21 April, that formalised the coup. It adopted a \\"Constituent Act\\", an amendment tantamount to a revolution, cancelling the elections and effectively abolishing the constitution, which would be replaced later. In the meantime, the government was to rule by decree. Since traditionally such Constituent Acts did not need to be signed by the Crown, the King never signed it, permitting him to claim, years later, that he had never signed any document instituting the junta. Critics claim that Constantine II did nothing to prevent the government (and especially his chosen prime minister, Kollias) from legally instituting the authoritarian government to come. This same government published and enforced a decree, already proclaimed on radio as the coup was in progress, instituting military law. Constantine claimed he never signed that decree either. =King's counter-coup= From the outset, the relationship between Constantine and the colonels was an uneasy one. The colonels were not willing to share power, whereas the young king, like his father before him, was used to playing an active role in politics and would never consent to being a mere figurehead, especially in a military administration. Although the colonels' strong anti-communist, pro-NATO, and pro-Western views appealed to the United States, President Lyndon B. Johnson ‚Äì in an attempt to avoid an international backlash ‚Äì told Constantine that it would be best to replace the junta with a new government according to Paul Ioannidis in his book Destiny Prevails: My life with Arist√≥teles Onassis. Constantine took that as an encouragement to organize a counter-coup, although no direct help or involvement of the U.S. (or Britain) was forthcoming. The King finally decided to launch his counter- coup on 13 December 1967. Since Athens was militarily in the hands of the colonels, Constantine decided to fly to the small northern city of Kavala, where he hoped to be among troops loyal only to him. The vague plan that Constantine and his advisors had conceived was to form a unit that would invade and take control over Thessaloniki, where an alternative administration would be installed. Constantine hoped that international recognition and internal pressure between the two governments would force the junta to resign, leaving the field clear for him to return triumphant to Athens. In the early morning hours of 13 December, the King boarded the royal plane, together with Queen Anne-Marie, their two baby children Princess Alexia and Crown Prince Pavlos, his mother Frederika, and his sister, Princess Irene. Constantine also took with him Prime Minister Kollias. At first, things seemed to be going according to plan. Constantine was well received in Kavala, which was under the command of a general loyal to him. The Hellenic Air Force and Navy, both strongly royalist and not involved in the junta, immediately declared for him and mobilised. Another of Constantine's generals effectively cut all communication between Athens and northern Greece. However, Constantine's plans were overly bureaucratic, na√Øvely supposing that orders from a commanding general would automatically be obeyed. In the circumstances, middle-ranking pro-junta officers neutralised and arrested Constantine's royalist generals and took command of their units, and subsequently put together a force to advance on Kavala to arrest the King. The junta, not at all shaken by the loss of their figurehead premier, ridiculed Constantine by announcing that he was hiding \\"from village to village\\". Realising that the counter-coup had failed, Constantine fled Greece on board the royal plane, taking his family and the helpless Kollias with him. They landed in Rome early in the morning of 14 December. Constantine remained in exile during the remainder of military rule. Although he subsequently returned to Greece, the abolition of the monarchy in 1973 removed his status as King. =Regency= The flight of Constantine and Kollias left Greece with no legal government or head of state. This did not concern the military junta. Instead the Revolutionary Council, composed of Pattakos, Papadopoulos, and Makarezos, appointed another member to the military administration, Major General Georgios Zoitakis, as Regent. Zoitakis then appointed Papadopoulos as prime minister. This became the only government of Greece following the failure of the King's attempted counter-coup, as Constantine was unwilling to set up an alternative administration in exile. In hopes of giving legal sanction to the regime, the junta drafted a new constitution. It made the military the guardians of \\"social and political order,\\" with wide autonomy from governmental and parliamentary oversight. It also heavily circumscribed the activities of political parties. The new constitution was approved in a 15 November referendum, with over 92 percent approval. However, the referendum was conducted in less-than-free circumstances; the regime deployed extensive propaganda in favour of the new document while muzzling any opposition. Under the new constitution, the regency would continue until elections were held, unless the junta called Constantine back sooner (though Constantine never acknowledged, let alone recognised, the regency). However, the junta announced that the \\"Revolution of April 21\\" (as the regime called itself) would need time to reform the \\"Greek mentality\\" before holding elections. It also suspended most of the constitution's guarantees of civil rights until the restoration of civilian rule. In a legally controversial move, even under the junta's own Constitution, the Cabinet voted on 21 March 1972 to oust Zoitakis and replace him with Papadopoulos, thus combining the offices of Regent and Prime Minister. It was thought Zoitakis was problematic and interfered too much with the military. The King's portrait remained on coins, in public buildings, etc., but slowly, the military chipped away at the institution of the monarchy: the royal family's tax immunity was abolished, the complex network of royal charities was brought under direct state control, the royal arms were removed from coins, the Navy and Air Force dropped their \\"Royal\\" names, and newspapers were prohibited from publishing the King's photo or any interviews. During this period, resistance against the colonels' rule became better organized among exiles in Europe and the United States. There was also considerable political infighting within the junta. Still, up until 1973, the junta appeared in firm control of Greece, and not likely to be ousted by violent means. Characteristics of the Junta =Ideology= National flag adopted by the colonels (1970‚Äì1974). It was the old flag of the Navy, but featured a darker shade of blue. The colonels preferred to call the coup an (, 'revolution to save the nation'). Their official justification was that a \\"communist conspiracy\\" had infiltrated Greece's bureaucracy, academia, press, and military, to such an extent that drastic action was needed to protect the country from communist takeover. Thus, the defining characteristic of the Junta was its staunch anti-communism. They used the term (, 'anarcho- communist') to describe leftists in general. In a similar vein, the junta attempted to steer Greek public opinion not only by propaganda but also by inventing new words and slogans, such as (, 'old-partyism') to discredit parliamentary democracy, or (, 'Greece for Christian Greeks') to underscore its ideology. The junta's main ideological spokesmen included Georgios Georgalas and journalist Savvas Konstantopoulos, both former Marxists. In 1970, Georgalas published a book The Decline of Consumer Society, stating that consumerism had destroyed the Christian spiritual values of the West, leaving Greece as the last solitary outpost of Christian civilization.Clogg, Richard \\"The Ideology of the \\"revolution of 21 April 1967'\\" p.36-58 from Greece Under Military Rule edited by Richard Clogg & George Yannopoloulos; London: Secker & Warburg, 1971 p.43. In the same book, Georgalas stated the solution to social problems was not as many believed increased employment, but instead \\"lengthy psycho-therapeutic programmes\\" which would create \\"the free man in harmonious co-existence with himself and his fellow beings\\".Clogg, Richard \\"The Ideology of the \\"revolution of 21 April 1967'\\" p.36-58 from Greece Under Military Rule edited by Richard Clogg & George Yannopoloulos; London: Secker & Warburg, 1971 p.43-44. The British historian Richard Clogg described the writings of Georgalas and Konstantopoluos as \\"pretentious verbiage\\", noting that they tended to use elaborate and impressive-sounding language to mask the shallowness of their theories. In essence, intellectuals like Georgalas and Konstantopoulos argued that materialism and consumerism was corroding the spiritual strength of the Greek people, and the military regime would \\"cure\\" the Greeks by restoring the traditional values of Orthodoxy (Greek Christianity). One of Papadopoulos' first acts after the coup was to change the pension laws to allow the veterans of the Security Battalions to collect pensions.Simpson, Christoper Blowback: America's Recruitment of Nazis and Its Effects on the Cold War, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1988 p.82 A central part of the regime's ideology was xenophobia, which presented Greeks as the creators of civilization with the rest of the world jealous of the debts they owed to Greece.Clogg, Richard \\"The Ideology of the \\"revolution of 21 April 1967'\\" p.36-58 from Greece Under Military Rule edited by Richard Clogg & George Yannopoloulos; London: Secker & Warburg, 1971 p.41. Colonel Ioannis Ladas, the Secretary-general of the Ministry of Public Order, came to international prominence in the summer of 1968 when he personally beat up Panayiotis Lambrias, the editor of magazine Eikones for running an article saying that homosexuality was accepted as normal in ancient Greece. When the BBC's Greek service reported the incident, Ladas gave a rant at a press conference, claiming that the BBC was run by homosexuals, making him into a sort of unofficial spokesman for the regime. At a subsequent speech before a visiting group of Greek-Americans on 6 August 1968, Ladas quoted Friderich Nietzsche's statement that the ancient Greeks invented everything and went on to say: \\"Foreigners confess and acknowledge Greek superiority. Human civilization was wholly fashioned by our race. Even the enemies of Greece recognize that civilization is an exclusively Greek creation\\". Ladas went on to denounce young men with long hair as \\"the degenerate phenomenon of hippyism\\", calling hippies \\"anti-social elements, drug addicts, sex maniacs, thieves, etc. It is only natural that they should be enemies of the army and the ideals which the military way of life serves\\".Clogg, Richard \\"The Ideology of the \\"revolution of 21 April 1967'\\" p.36-58 from Greece Under Military Rule edited by Richard Clogg & George Yannopoloulos; London: Secker & Warburg, 1971 p.42. Ladas ended his speech by arguing that Greeks for racial reasons were still the world's preeminent people, but had only declined of inadequate leadership, a problem which had been solved by the \\"revolution\\" of 21 April 1967. Ladas claimed that Greece under military leadership would be \\"cured\\" of its problems and resume its rightful place in the world. Clogg noted that before the coup, Ladas had been associated with the far-right 4th of August Party, and contributed many articles to that party's journal, which was a \\"racist and anti-Semitic\\" magazine which glorified not only 4 August Regime, but also the Third Reich. The Greek novelist Yiorgos Theotokas once coined the term (, 'ancestoritis') to describe an obsession with the heritage of the past, which many felt that Papadopoulos and the rest of the junta suffered from.Clogg, Richard \\"The Ideology of the 'revolution of 21 April 1967'\\" p.36-58 from Greece Under Military Rule edited by Richard Clogg & George Yannopoloulos; London: Secker & Warburg, 1971 p.45. Papadopoulos often described the Greeks in his speeches as the \\"elect of God\\", claiming the regenerated ' ('Greece for Christian Greeks') would be the example to the rest of the world as maintained that people all over the world would regard his ideology of \\"Helleno-Christian civilization\\" alongside the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle as the summit of intellectual achievement. = \\"Patient in a cast\\" and other metaphors = Throughout his tenure as the junta strongman, Papadopoulos often employed what have been described by the BBC as gory medical metaphors, where he or the junta assumed the role of the \\"medical doctor\\". The supposed \\"patient\\" was Greece. Typically Papadopoulos or the junta portrayed themselves as the \\"doctor\\" who operated on the \\"patient\\" by putting the patient's \\"foot\\" in an orthopedic cast and applying restraints on the \\"patient\\", tying him on a surgical bed and putting him under anesthesia to perform the \\"operation\\" so that the life of the \\"patient\\" would not be \\"endangered\\" during the operation. In one of his famous speeches Papadopoulos mentioned: In the same speech Papadopoulos continued: Other metaphors contained religious imagery related to the resurrection of Christ at Easter: \\"\\" (\\"Christ has risen ‚Äì Greece has risen\\"), alluding that the junta would save Greece and resurrect her into a greater, new Land. The theme of rebirth was used many times as a standard reply to avoid answering any questions as to how long the dictatorship would last: The religious themes and rebirth metaphors are also seen in the following: =Civil rights= As soon as the coup d'√©tat was announced over Greek radio, martial music was continuously broadcast over the airwaves. This was interrupted from time to time with announcements of the junta issuing orders, which always started with the introduction, (, 'We decide and we order'). Long-standing political freedoms and civil liberties, that had been taken for granted and enjoyed by the Greek people for decades, were instantly suppressed. Article 14 of the Greek Constitution, which protected freedom of thought and freedom of the press, was immediately suspended.Trial of the Junta Korydallos documentaryGreek Constitution (Syntagma). Retrieved 15 August 2008. Military courts were established, and political parties were dissolved. Legislation that took decades to fine tune and multiple parliaments to enact was thus erased in a matter of days. The rapid dismantling of Greek democracy had begun. In fact, the junta crackdown was so fast that by September 1967, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and the Netherlands went before the European Commission of Human Rights to accuse Greece of violating most of the human rights protected by the European Convention on Human Rights. Following the coup, 6,188 suspected communists and political opponents were imprisoned or exiled to remote Greek islands within the first week after the coup. Under the junta, torture became a deliberate practice carried out both by the Security Police and the Greek Military Police (ESA),Lawrence Van Gelder \\"Din nabos soen\\" . The New York Times.Lawrence Van Gelder (29 August 1984). \\"Danish 'Phoenix' and 'Neighbor's Son'.\\" The New York Times. with an estimated 3,500 people detained in torture centres run by ESA. Commonly used methods of torture included, but were not limited to, beating the soles of detainees' feet, sexual torture, choking and ripping out body hair. The Special Interrogation Unit of the Greek Military Police (EAT/ESA) used a combination of techniques that included continuous standing in an empty room, sleep and food deprivation, beatings and loud sounds. Gyaros, a prison island for dissidents According to recent research based on new interviews with survivors, in the period from May to November 1973 this combination of interrogation techniques also included the repetition of songs that were popular hits of the time.Papaeti, Anna (2013). \\"Music, Torture, Testimony: Reopening the Case of the Greek Military Junta (1967‚Äì74).\\" The world of music special issue: \\"Music and Torture  Music and Punishment\\" 2:1(2013), guest edited by M.

Later President of Greece, Magistrate Christos Sartzetakis was discharged and imprisoned by the junta due to his investigation on Lambrakis' murder.

Killing Hope: U.S. Military and CIA Interventions Since World War II, revised edition. Common Courage Press. The citizens' right of assembly was revoked and no political demonstrations were allowed. Surveillance on citizens was a fact of life, even during permitted social activities. That had a continuously chilling effect on the population who realised that, even though they were allowed certain social activities, they could not overstep the boundaries and delve into or discuss forbidden subjects. This realisation, including the absence of any civil rights as well as maltreatment during police arrest, ranging from threats to beatings or worse, made life under the junta a difficult proposition for many ordinary citizens. Photography by ordinary citizens was banned in public locations. The junta allowed citizens to participate in ordinary societal events that reflected those of the United States and United Kingdom, such as rock concerts for example. However, citizens lived in extreme fear, as any behavior that the junta disapproved of, coupled with the complete absence of any civil rights or freedoms, could easily result in torture, beatings, exile, imprisonment, or worse, and the labeling of the victims as anarcho-communists, or worse. The absence of a valid code of jurisprudence led to the unequal application of the law among the citizens and to rampant favouritism and nepotism. Absence of elected representation meant that the citizens' stark and only choice was to submit to these arbitrary measures exactly as dictated by the junta. The country had become a true police state. Thousands were jailed for political reasons by the dictatorship and thousands were forced into exile. More than 10,000 were estimated to have been arrested in the first few days after the coup.\\"George Papadopoulos; Led Military Junta in Greece\\". Los Angeles Times, 28 June 1999. https://www.latimes.com/archives/la- xpm-1999-jun-28-mn-50904-story.html Complete lack of press freedom coupled with nonexistent civil rights meant that continuous cases of civil rights abuses could neither be reported nor investigated by an independent press or any other reputable authority. This led to a psychology of fear among the citizens during the Papadopoulos dictatorship, which became worse under Ioannidis. =External relations= The military government was given support by the United States as a Cold War ally, due to its proximity to the Eastern European Soviet bloc, and the fact that the previous Truman administration had given the country millions of dollars in economic aid to discourage Communism. U.S. support for the junta, which was staunchly anti-Communist, is claimed to be the cause of rising anti-Americanism in Greece during and following the junta's undemocratic rule. There was a mixed response to the junta from Western Europe. The Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands filed a complaint before the Human Rights Commission of the Council of Europe in September 1967. The Commission on Human Rights took the exceptional step of constituting a Sub-Commission to investigate the accusations of gross human rights abuses. The sub-commission reported its extensive on-site investigation and unearthed significant evidence of torture and human rights violations. Greece however opted to leave the Council of Europe in December 1969 before a full verdict of the commission could be handed down. Countries such as the United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of Germany on the other hand were voicing criticism about Greece's human rights record but supported the country's continued membership in the Council of Europe and NATO because of the country's strategic value for the western alliance. =Sociocultural policies= To gain support for his rule, Papadopoulos projected an image that appealed to some key segments of Greek society. The son of a poor but educated rural family, he was educated at the prestigious Hellenic Military Academy. Papadopoulos allowed substantial social and cultural freedoms to all social classes, but political oppression and censorship were at times heavy-handed, especially in areas deemed sensitive by the junta, such as political activities, and politically related art, literature, film and music. Kostas Gavras's film Z and Mikis Theodorakis's music, among others, were never allowed even during the most relaxed times of the dictatorship, and an index of prohibited songs, literature and art was kept. Western music and film Remarkably, after some initial hesitation and as long as they were not deemed to be politically damaging to the junta, junta censors allowed wide access to Western music and films. Even the then-racy West German film Helga, a 1967 sex education documentary featuring a live birth scene, had no trouble making its debut in Greece just like in any other Western country. Moreover, the film was only restricted for those under 13 years of age. In 1971 Robert Hartford-Davis was allowed by the junta to film the classic horror film Incense for the Damned, starring Peter Cushing and Patrick Macnee and suitably featuring (), a beguiling Greek siren with vampire tendencies, on the Greek island of Hydra.Summarised by the Horror Film Archive thus: \\"A young man finds himself turning into a bloodsucking monster.

Meanwhile, at Matala, Crete, a hippie colony which had been living in the caves since the 1960s, was never disturbed.

The regime sponsored song contests and concerts featuring folk musicians throughout its existence. The favored types of music employed by the government were those which accompanied the Kalamatianos and Tsamiko folk dances. Additionally, the regime encouraged the production of new folk songs with lyrics praising the government and its leaders, like Georgios Papadopoulos. Because the clarinet was so strongly featured in the music of the Junta, it remains associated with the Colonels by many Greeks today. The ideology behind the promotion of folk music was twofold: to bridge the gap of continuity with Greece's past and present, and to limit foreign cultural influences such as psychedelic music (which could hold political connotations contrary to those of the Junta) by substituting them with traditionally Greek ones. Folk music was also used as an ideological weapon against dissidents, and it was played constantly in detention centers to help break prisoners. Greek rock In the early days of the dictatorship, Western music broadcasts were limited from the airwaves in favour of martial music, but this was eventually relaxed. In addition, pop/rock music programmes such as the one hosted by famous Greek music/radio/television personality and promoter Nico Mastorakis were very popular throughout the dictatorship years both on radio and television.\\"Nikos Mastorakis\\". Museum of Broadcast Communications. \\"Nikos Mastorakis was the TV personality sine qua non of the dictatorship years.\\" Most Western record sales were similarly not restricted. In fact, even rock concerts and tours were allowed such as by the then popular rock groups Socrates Drank the Conium and Nostradamos. (Give me your hand) on YouTubeAthens Guide. \\"Socrates\\". \\"Socrates will probably never get inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. But while other groups were becoming well known in the free world, this Hendrix-style blues band was playing to standing-room-only crowds in a small club in Athens, during Greece's military dictatorship, a period when even Rolling Stone albums were hard to find, and for a time illegal.\\" Another pop group, Poll, was a pioneer of Greek pop music in the early 1970s. Its lead singer and composer was Robert Williams, who was later joined, in 1971, by Kostas Tournas. Poll enjoyed a number of nationwide hits, such as \\" (Mankind Love One Another)\\", an anti-war song composed by Tournas, and \\" (Come, My Sun)\\", composed by Tournas, Williams.Kostas Tournas article on Greek Wikipedia. \\"(The song) \\"Anthrope agapa\\" was motivated by an anti-war film\\" Tournas later pursued a solo career and in 1972 produced the progressive psychedelic hit solo album (, 'Infinite Fields').Lost in Tyme. \\"After the split of 'Poll', Kostas Tournas went on to record a great progressive-psychedelic concept solo album.\\" He wrote and arranged the album using an orchestra and a rock group (\\"Ruth\\") combination, producing a rock opera which is considered a landmark of Greek rock. In 1973 Kostas Tournas created the album (Stardreams), influenced by David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust.) from Astroneira Songwriter Dionysis Savvopoulos, who was initially imprisoned by the regime, nevertheless rose to great popularity and produced a number of influential and highly politically allegorical, especially against the junta, albums during the period, including (, 'The Madman's Orchard'), (, the name of Greek folk dance) and (, 'Dirty Bread'). Tourism Concurrently, tourism was actively encouraged by Papadopoulos' government and, funding scandals notwithstanding, there was great development of the tourist sector. With tourism came nightlife. However, under Papadopoulos, in the absence of any civil rights these sociocultural freedoms existed in a legal vacuum that meant they were not guaranteed, but rather dispensed at the whim of the junta. In addition any transgressing into political matters during social or cultural activities usually meant arrest and punishment. Tourism was furthered by the 1969 European Championships in Athletics in Athens which showed political normality. Even the boycott of the West German team was not directed against the junta, but against its own team leadership.Arnd Kr√ºger. \\"A Cultural Revolution? The Boycott of the European Athletics Championships by the West German Team in Athens 1969\\", in: CESH (Hrsg.), Proceedings Fourth Annual Conference. Band 1. Florenz 1999, 162‚Äì166. Although discos and nightclubs were, initially, subjected to a curfew, partially due to an energy crisis, this was eventually extended from 1:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m. as the energy crisis eased. These freedoms were later reversed by Dimitrios Ioannidis after his coup. Agriculture The farmers were Papadopoulos' natural constituency and were more likely to support him, seeing him, because of his rural roots, as one of their own. He cultivated this relationship by appealing to them, calling them (, 'the backbone of the people') and cancelling all agricultural loans.Michel Fors√©. Recent Social Trends in France, 1960‚Äì1990. \\"In addition the writing-off of agricultural debts, the gradual abolition of hard monetary policy and the supply of loans for opportunist investments created a climate of economic euphoria (mainly in 1970‚Äì1973). Although the way in which loans were being provided and their uncontrollable use constituted the introduction to the process of de-industrialization which begins with the Ioannidis period. The collapse of the dictatorship, due to the nationalist fury of the last period, the Ioannidis period, led to the collapse of the compulsive interconnections of power that the civil war and its consequences had shaped.\\" p. 12 Dimitris Charalambis, Laura Maratou-Alipranti, and Andromachi Hadjiyanni. Recent Social Trends in Greece, 1960‚Äì2000.

By further insisting on promoting, but not really enforcing for fear of middle-class backlash, religion and patriotism, he further appealed to the simpler ideals of rural Greece and strengthened his image as people's champion among farmers, who tended to ridicule the middle class. Furthermore, the regime promoted a policy of economic development in rural areas, which were mostly neglected by the previous governments, that had focused largely on urban industrial development. Urban classes Papadopoulos was less likely to appeal to the largely civilian and city- oriented middle class, since he was a military man from a rural background. In addition, he had promised from the beginning that the dictatorship would not be permanent, and that when political order was established democratic rule would return. On top of that, his promotion of tourism and other beneficial economic measures and the fact that, with the notable exceptions of political freedoms and press censorship, he did not otherwise substantially restrict the middle class, had the effect of assisting the junta in establishing its control over the country by gaining, at least initially, the reluctant acquiescence of some key segments of the population. =Economic policies= The 1967‚Äì1973 period was marked by high rates of economic growth coupled with low inflation and low unemployment. Economic growth was driven by investment in the tourism industry, loose emigration policies, public spending, and pro- business incentives that fostered both domestic and foreign capital spending. Several international companies invested in Greece at the time, including The Coca-Cola Company. Economic growth started losing steam by 1972. In addition, large scale construction of hydroelectric dam projects, such as in Aliakmon, Kastrakion, Polyphytos, the expansion of thermoelectric generation units and other significant infrastructure development, took place. The junta used to proudly announce these projects with the slogan: (, 'Greece is a construction zone'). The always smiling Stylianos Pattakos, also known as (, 'the first trowel of Greece'), since he frequently appeared at project inaugurations with a trowel in hand, starred in many of the propaganda documentaries that were screened before feature film presentation in Greek cinemas.Kathimerini. \\"Remember Pattakos, the striking baldie superstar of the junta, who never missed a chance to pose with a trowel at hand and never missed a documentary of Epikaira\\" =Financial scandals= Cases of non-transparent public deals and corruption allegedly occurred at the time, given the lack of democratic checks and balances and the absence of a free press. One such event is associated with the regime's tourism minister, Ioannis Ladas. During his administration, several low-interest loans, amortized over a twenty-year period, were issued for tourist development. This fostered the erection of a multitude of hotels, sometimes in non-tourist areas, and with no underlying business rationale. Several such hotels were abandoned unfinished as soon as the loans were secured, and their remains still dot the Greek countryside. These questionable loans are referred to as (, 'loans of the sea'), to indicate the loose terms under which they were granted.Elefthero Vima Quote: \\"ŒëŒªŒªŒ¨, Œ≥ŒπŒ± ŒΩŒ± Œ≠œÅŒ∏ŒµŒπ Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ∑ œàœÖœáŒπŒ∫ŒÆ Œ∫Œ¨Œ∏Œ±œÅœÉŒ∑ ŒΩŒ± Œ≤Œ≥ŒøœÖŒΩ œÑŒ± Œ∫ŒπœÑŒ¨œÄŒπŒ± œÑœâŒΩ œÑœÅŒ±œÄŒµŒ∂œéŒΩ Œ≥ŒπŒ± œÑŒ± Œ∏Œ±ŒªŒ±œÉœÉŒøŒ¥Œ¨ŒΩŒµŒπŒ± œÄŒøœÖ œÄŒÆœÅŒ±ŒΩ ŒµœÄŒØ œáŒøœçŒΩœÑŒ±œÇ ŒøŒπ ŒµœÖœÖœÄœåŒªŒ∑œÄœÑŒøŒπ œÄŒøŒªŒØœÑŒµœÇ Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ±Œ≥œåœÅŒ±œÉŒ±ŒΩ Œ≥Œ∑ Œ∫Œ±Œπ ŒøŒπŒ∫œåœÄŒµŒ¥Œ± Œ≥ŒπŒ± ŒΩŒ± Œ∫œÑŒØœÉŒøœÖŒΩ.\\" Translation: \\"... for the loans of the sea which were received, during the junta years, by respected citizens and bought land and properties to build on\\" Another contested policy of the regime was the writing-off of agricultural loans, up to a value of 100,000 drachmas, to farmers. This has been attributed to an attempt by Papadopoulos to gain public support for his regime. Italian connection At the time, the Italian far right was very impressed with the methods of Papadopoulos and his junta. In April 1968, Papadopoulos invited fifty members of the Italian far right on a Greek tour, to demonstrate the junta's methods. Invitees included Stefano Delle Chiaie and members of Ordine Nuovo, Avanguardia Nazionale, Europa Civilt√†, and FUAN-La Caravella. (cf Frattini, Entity, 2004, p. 304) The Italians were impressed. Upon returning to their country, they escalated their political violence, embarking on a terror campaign of bombings and other violence which killed and injured hundreds. Afterwards, the right-wing instigators of this violence blamed the communists. After their visit to Greece, the Italian neo-fascists also engaged in false flag operations and embarked on a campaign of infiltration of leftist, anarchist, and Marxist‚ÄìLeninist organisations. One of the neo-fascists conducted frequent provocations and infiltrations in the months leading to the Piazza Fontana bombing on 12 December 1969. The Greek junta was so impressed with the manner in which their Italian counterparts were paving the way toward an Italian coup d'√©tat that, on 15 May 1969, Papadopoulos sent them a congratulatory message stating that \\"His Excellency the Prime Minister notes that the efforts that have been undertaken by the Greek National government in Italy for some time start to have some impact\\".  Anti-Junta movement  Alexandros Panagoulis on trial in front of the junta justice system The democratic elements of Greek society were opposed to the junta, from the start. This included the entire left wing of the Greek political spectrum, including the Communist Party of Greece, which was outlawed long before the junta. Many new militant groups formed in 1968, both in exile and in Greece, to promote democratic rule. These included Panhellenic Liberation Movement, Democratic Defense, and the Socialist Democratic Union. The first armed action against the junta was Alexandros Panagoulis's failed attempt to assassinate George Papadopoulos, on 13 August 1968. =Assassination attempt by Panagoulis= The assassination attempt took place on the morning of 13 August, when Papadopoulos went from his summer residence in Lagonisi to Athens, escorted by his personal security motorcycles and cars. Alexandros Panagoulis ignited a bomb at a point of the coastal road where the limousine carrying Papadopoulos had to slow down, but the bomb failed to harm Papadopoulos. Panagoulis was captured a few hours later in a nearby sea cave, as the boat that would let him escape the scene of the attack had not shown up. Panagoulis was transferred to the Greek Military Police (EAT-ESA) offices, where he was questioned, beaten, and tortured (see the proceedings of Theofiloyiannakos's trial). On 17 November 1968, he was sentenced to death. He remained in prison for five years. After democracy was restored, Panagoulis was elected into Parliament. He is regarded as emblematic of the struggle to restore democracy. =Broadening of the movement= The funeral of George Papandreou, Sr., on 3 November 1968, spontaneously turned into a massive demonstration against the junta. Thousands of Athenians disobeyed the military's orders, and followed the casket to the cemetery. The junta arrested 41 people. On 28 March 1969, after two years of widespread censorship, political detentions and torture, Giorgos Seferis, recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1963, took a stand against the junta. He made a statement on the BBC World Service,John Karavidas, George Seferis and the BBC, BBC Greek service, translation by Google. Retrieved 6 July 2008 with copies simultaneously distributed to every newspaper in Athens. Attacking the colonels, he passionately demanded that \\"This anomaly must end\\". Seferis died before the junta ended. His funeral, on 20 September 1972, turned into a massive demonstration against the military government. Also in 1969, Costa- Gavras released the film Z, based on a book by celebrated left-wing writer Vassilis Vassilikos. The film, banned in Greece, presented a lightly fictionalized account of the events surrounding the assassination of United Democratic Left MP Gregoris Lambrakis in 1963. The film captured the sense of outrage about the junta. The soundtrack of the film was written by Mikis Theodorakis, who was imprisoned by the junta and later went into exile, and the music was smuggled into the country and added to other inspirational, underground Theodorakis tracks. A lesser known Danish film, in Greek, Your Neighbor's Son, detailed the subordination and training of simple youths to become torturers for the junta. =International protest= Protest against the junta by Greek political exiles in Germany, 1967 The junta exiled thousands, on the grounds that they were communists and/or \\"enemies of the country\\". Most of them were subjected to internal exile on Greek deserted islands, such as Makronisos, Gyaros, Gioura, or inhabited islands such as Leros, Agios Eustratios or Trikeri. The most famous were in external exile, most of whom were substantially involved in the resistance, organising protests in European capital cities or helping and hiding refugees from Greece. These included: Melina Mercouri, actor, singer (and, after 1981 Minister for Culture); Mikis Theodorakis, composer of resistance songs; Costas Simitis (prime minister from 1996 to 2004); Andreas Papandreou (prime minister from 1981 to 1989 and again from 1993 to 1996); and Lady Amalia Fleming (wife of Sir Alexander Fleming, philanthropist, political activist). Some chose exile, unable to stand life under the junta. For example, Melina Mercouri was allowed to enter Greece, but stayed away on her own accord. In the early hours of 19 September 1970, in Matteotti square in Genoa, geology student Kostas Georgakis set himself ablaze in protest against the dictatorship of George Papadopoulos. The junta delayed the arrival of his remains to Corfu for four months, fearing public reaction and protests. At the time, his death caused a sensation in Greece and abroad, as it was the first tangible manifestation of the depth of resistance against the junta. He is the only known anti-junta resistance activist to have sacrificed himself. He is considered the precursor of later student protest, such as the Athens Polytechnic uprising. The Municipality of Corfu dedicated a memorial in his honour, near his home in Corfu city. In a speech before the U.S. Senate on 6 November 1971, Senator Lee Metcalf listed the members of the Greek junta who had served in the collaborationist Security Battalions and denounced the administration of Richard Nixon for supporting what he called a \\"junta of Nazi collaborators\\".Simpson, Christoper America's Recruitment of Nazis and Its Destructive Impact on Our Domestic and Foreign Policy, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1988 p.81-82. The German writer, investigative reporter and journalist G√ºnter Wallraff traveled to Greece in May 1974. While in Syntagma Square, he protested against human right violations. He was arrested and tortured by the police, as he did not carry, on purpose, any papers on him that could identify him as a foreigner. After his identity was revealed, Wallraff was convicted and sentenced to 14 months in jail. He was released in August, after the end of the dictatorship. =Velos mutiny= The destroyer (, 'Arrow'), now a museum ship at Palaio Faliro in Athens In an anti-junta protest, on 23 May 1973, HNS Velos, under the command of Commander Nikolaos Pappas, refused to return to Greece after participating in a NATO exercise and remained anchored at Fiumicino, Italy. During a patrol with other NATO vessels between continental Italy and Sardinia, the commander and the officers heard over the radio that a number of fellow naval officers had been arrested in Greece. Commander Pappas was involved in a group of democratic officers who remained loyal to their oath to obey the Constitution and planned to act against the junta. Evangelos Averoff also participated in the Velos mutiny, for which he was later arrested as an \\"instigator\\". Pappas believed that since his fellow anti-junta officers had been arrested, there was no more hope for a movement inside Greece. He therefore decided to act alone in order to motivate global public opinion. He mustered all the crew to the stern and announced his decision, which was received with enthusiasm by the crew. Pappas signaled his intentions to the squadron commander and NATO headquarters, quoting the preamble of the North Atlantic Treaty, which declares that \\"all governments ... are determined to safeguard the freedom, common heritage and civilisation of their peoples, founded on the principles of democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law\\", and, leaving formation, sailed for Rome. There, anchored about away from the coast of Fiumicino, three ensigns sailed ashore with a whaleboat, went to Fiumicino Airport and telephoned the international press agencies, notifying them of the situation in Greece, the presence of the destroyer, and that the captain would hold a press conference the next day. This action increased international interest in the situation in Greece. The commander, six officers, and twenty five petty officers requested permission to remain abroad as political refugees. Indeed, the whole crew wished to follow their commander but were advised by its officers to remain onboard and return to Greece to inform families and friends about what happened. Velos returned to Greece after a month with a replacement crew. After the fall of the junta all officers and petty officers returned to the Navy. Collapse The collapse of the junta both ideologically and politically was triggered by a series of events which unfolded soon after Papadopoulos' attempt at liberalisation, with ideological collapse preceding its eventual political collapse. During and following this ill-fated process the internal political strains of the junta came to the fore and pitted the junta factions against each other, thus destroying the seemingly monolithic cohesion of the dictatorship. This had the effect of seriously weakening the coherence of the political message and, consequently, the regime's credibility. Later events showed that this was a fatal blow, from which the junta never recovered. At the same time, during Papadopoulos' attempt at liberalisation, some of the junta constraints were removed from Greece's body politic. This led to demands for more freedoms, and political unrest, in a society well used to democratic action prior to the dictatorship. =Normalization and attempts at liberalization= Presidential standard (1973‚Äì74) Papadopoulos had indicated as early as 1968 that he was eager for a reform process. He had declared at the time that he did not want the \\"Revolution\\" (junta speak for the \\"dictatorship\\") to become a \\"regime\\". He attempted to initiate reforms in 1969 and 1970 but was thwarted by the hardliners, including Ioannidis. Subsequent to his 1970 failed attempt at reform, he threatened to resign. He was dissuaded when the hardliners renewed their personal allegiance to him.Ioannis Tzortzis, Quote: \\"The Americans asked the Greek government to allow the use of their bases in Greek territory and air space to supply Israel; Markezinis, backed by Papadopoulos, denied on the grounds of maintaining good relations with the Arab countries. This denial is said to have turned the US against Papadopoulos and Markezinis.\\" Quote: \\"Thus the students had been played straight into the hands of Ioannidis, who looked upon the coming elections with a jaundiced eye.\\" Quote: \\"The latter [i.e. Markezinis] would insist until the end of his life that subversion on behalf‚Ä¶ Markezinis was known for his independence to the US interests.\\" Quote: \\"In that situation Ioannidis was emerging as a solution for the officers, in sharp contrast to Papadopoulos, whose accumulation 'of so many offices and titles (President of Republic, Prime Minister, minister of Defence) was harming the seriousness of the regime and giving it an unacceptable image, which was not left un-exploited by its opponents\\". Quote:\\"The first attempt of Papadopoulos to start a process of reform occurred in the spring of 1968. He was claiming that if the 'Revolution' stayed more than a certain time in power, it would lose its dynamics and transform into a 'regime', which was not in his intentions. He tried to implicate Markezinis in the attempt; however, he met the stiff resistance of the hard-liners. Another attempt was again frustrated in the end of 1969 and the beginning of 1970; Papadopoulos was then disappointed and complaining 'I am being subverted by my fellow Evelpides cadets!‚Äô As a result of this second failure, he considered resigning in the summer of 1970, complaining that he lacked any support from other leading figures, his own closest followers included.

The Central Council met in Athens in the Parliament Building. Both councils had the purpose to advise the dictator. At the time of the announcement of the formation of the council, Papadopoulos explained that he wanted to avoid using the term (, 'Parliament') for the Committee because it sounded bad. The council was dissolved just prior to Papadopoulos' failed attempt to liberalise his regime. As internal dissatisfaction grew in the early 1970s, and especially after an abortive coup by the Navy in early 1973, Papadopoulos attempted to legitimize the regime by beginning a gradual \\"democratization\\" (See also the article on Metapolitefsi). On 1 June 1973, he abolished the monarchy and declared Greece a republic with himself as president. He was confirmed in office after a controversial referendum, the results of which were not recognised by the political parties. He furthermore sought the support of the old political establishment, but secured only the cooperation of Spiros Markezinis, who was appointed Prime Minister. Concurrently, many restrictions were lifted, and the army's role significantly reduced. Papadopoulos intended to establish a presidential republic, with extensive‚Äìand within the context of the system, almost dictatorial‚Äìpowers vested in the office of President, which he held. The decision to return to political rule and the restriction of their role was resented by many of the regime's supporters in the Army, whose dissatisfaction with Papadopoulos would become evident a few months later. =Uprising at the Polytechnic= Papadopoulos' heavy-handed attempt at liberalisation did not find favour among many in Greece. The stilted democratisation process he proposed was constrained by multiple factors. His inexperience at carrying out an unprecedented political experiment of democratisation was burdened by his tendency to concentrate as much power in his hands as possible, a weakness he exhibited during the junta years when he would sometimes hold multiple high-echelon government portfolios. This especially antagonised the intelligentsia, whose primary exponents were the students. The students at the Law School in Athens, for example, demonstrated multiple times against the dictatorship prior to the events at the Polytechneion. The tradition of student protest was always strong in Greece, even before the dictatorship. Papadopoulos tried hard to suppress and discredit the student movement during his tenure at the helm of the junta. But the liberalisation process he undertook allowed the students to organise more freely, and this gave the opportunity to the students at the National Technical University of Athens to organise a demonstration that grew progressively larger and more effective. The political momentum was on the side of the students. Sensing this, the junta panicked and reacted violently.Kostis Kornetis (2013). Children of the Dictatorship. Student Resistance, Cultural Politics and the \\"Long 1960s\\" in Greece. New York : Berghahn Books. In the early hours of Saturday, 17 November 1973, Papadopoulos sent the army to suppress the student strike and sit-in of the (, 'Free Besieged'), as the students called themselves, at the Athens Polytechnic which had commenced on 14 November. Shortly after 3:00 am. EET, under almost complete cover of darkness, an AMX 30 tank crashed through the rail gate of the Athens Polytechnic with subsequent loss of life. The army also occupied Syntagma Square for at least the following day. Even the sidewalk cafes were closed. Ioannidis' involvement in inciting unit commanders to commit criminal acts during the uprising, so that he could facilitate his own upcoming coup, was noted in the indictment presented to the court by the prosecutor during the Greek junta trials, and in his subsequent conviction in the Polytechneion trial where he was found to have been morally responsible for the events.Tsevas report Quote: \\"ŒüŒπ ŒôœâŒ±ŒΩŒΩŒØŒ¥Œ∑œÇ Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ°ŒøœÖœÜŒøŒ≥Œ¨ŒªŒ∑œÇ, Œ¥ŒπŒ± œÑœâŒΩ ŒµŒπœÇ Œ±œÖœÑŒøœçœÇ œÄŒπœÉœÑœéŒΩ ŒëŒæŒπœâŒºŒ±œÑŒπŒ∫œéŒΩ Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÄœÅŒ±Œ∫œÑœåœÅœâŒΩ, ŒµœÄŒ∑œÅŒµŒ¨Œ∂ŒøœÖŒΩ œÉŒøŒ≤Œ±œÅœéœÇ Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÉŒ±œÜœéœÇ œÑŒ∑ŒΩ œåŒªŒ∑ŒΩ ŒµœÄŒπœáŒµŒØœÅŒ∑œÉŒπŒΩ, ŒµŒæŒ±œÄŒøŒªœçŒøŒΩœÑŒµœÇ Œ∫œçŒºŒ± Œ≤ŒπŒ±ŒπŒøœÑŒÆœÑœâŒΩ Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÄœÖœÅŒøŒ≤ŒøŒªŒπœÉŒºœéŒΩ, ŒµœÄŒØ œÑœâ œÑŒ≠ŒªŒµŒπ œÑŒ∑œÇ Œ¥Œ∑ŒºŒπŒøœÖœÅŒ≥ŒØŒ±œÇ ŒµœÖŒΩŒøœäŒ∫œéŒΩ Œ¥ŒπŒ± œÑŒ∑ŒΩ œÄœÅŒøŒ±œÄŒøœÜŒ±œÉŒπœÉŒ∏ŒµŒØœÉŒ±ŒΩ Œ∫ŒØŒΩŒ∑œÉŒπŒΩ œÉœÖŒΩŒ∏Œ∑Œ∫œéŒΩ Œ±œÉœÜŒ±ŒªŒµŒØŒ±œÇ, Œ±ŒΩŒ±œÑŒ±œÅŒ±œáŒÆœÇ Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÉœÖŒ≥Œ∫œÅŒøœçœÉŒµœâŒΩ.\\"Eleftherotypia Unrepentant for the Dictatorship. Retrieved 15 August 2008 (In Greek) English translation by Google =Ioannidis coup and regime= The uprising triggered a series of events that put an abrupt end to Papadopoulos' attempts at \\"liberalisation\\".Washington Post 16 April 1973, p. A6. Brigadier Dimitrios Ioannidis, a disgruntled junta hardliner and long-time prot√©g√© of Papadopoulos as head of the feared Military Police, used the uprising as a pretext to reestablish public order, and staged a counter-coup that overthrew Papadopoulos and Spyros Markezinis on 25 November. Military law was reinstated, and the new Junta appointed General Phaedon Gizikis as president and economist Adamantios Androutsopoulos as Prime Minister, although Ioannidis remained the behind-the-scenes strongman. Ioannidis's heavy-handed and opportunistic intervention had the effect of destroying the myth that the junta was an idealistic group of army officers with exactly the same ideals who came to save Greece by using their collective wisdom. The main tenet of the junta ideology (and mythology) was gone and so was the collective. By default, he remained the only man at the top after toppling the other three principals of the junta. Characteristically, he cited ideological reasons for ousting the Papadopoulos faction, accusing them with straying from the principles of the Revolution, especially of being corrupt and misusing their privileges as army officers for financial gains. Papadopoulos and his junta always claimed that the 21 April 1967 \\"revolution\\" saved Greece from the old party system. Now Ioannidis was, in effect, claiming that his coup saved the revolution from the Papadopoulos faction. The dysfunction as well as the ideological fragmentation and fractionalisation of the junta was finally out in the open. Ioannidis, however, did not make these accusations personally as he always tried to avoid unnecessary publicity. The radio broadcasts, following the now familiar coup in progress scenario featuring martial music interspersed with military orders and curfew announcements, kept repeating that the army was taking back the reins of power in order to save the principles of the revolution and that the overthrow of the Papadopoulos- Markezinis government was supported by the army, navy and air force.BBC: On this day quote:A military communiqu√© announced the overthrow of the government was supported by the army, navy and air force and said it was a \\"continuation of the revolution of 1967\\", when the Greek colonels, headed by Mr Papadopoulos, seized control. The statement went on to accuse Mr Papadopoulos of \\"straying from the ideals of the 1967 revolution\\" and \\"pushing the country towards parliamentary rule too quickly\\". At the same time they announced that the new coup was a \\"continuation of the revolution of 1967\\" and accused Papadopoulos with \\"straying from the ideals of the 1967 revolution\\" and \\"pushing the country towards parliamentary rule too quickly\\". Previous to seizing power, Ioannidis preferred to work in the background and he never held any formal office in the junta. Now he was the de facto leader of a puppet regime composed by members some of whom were rounded up by Greek Military Police (ESA) soldiers in roving jeeps to serve and others that were simply chosen by mistake.\\"Greece marks '73 student uprising\\" , and:the notorious Brigadier Dimitrios Ioannidis now serving a life sentence for his part in the 1967 seizure of power ‚Äì immediately scrapped a programme of liberalisation introduced earlier and: His was but to do the bidding of a junta strongman who had never made a secret of his belief that Greeks were not ready for democracy. Athens News, 17 November 1999Mario Modiano The Times correspondent in Athens, \\"A long, happy summer night 30 years ago\\" , Athens News, 23 July 2004 quote1: My friend had been sworn in as a minister by mistake. After his coup, Ioannidis dispatched military policemen in jeeps to round up the people he needed to man a puppet government. When they turned up at my friend's home and ordered him to follow them, he was convinced that the soldiers intended to shoot him. quote 2: The meeting lasted five hours. Then there was a break, and by the time the meeting resumed, Evangelos Averoff, the former foreign minister, who was there, had already telephoned Constantine Karamanlis in Paris to urge him to return immediately and assume the reins of power. The Ioannidis method of forming a government dealt yet another blow to the rapidly diminishing credibility of the regime both at home and abroad. The new junta, despite its rather inauspicious origins, pursued an aggressive internal crackdown and an expansionist foreign policy. =Cypriot coup d'√©tat, Turkish invasion and fall of the Junta= Map showing the division of Cyprus Sponsored by Ioannidis, on 15 July 1974 a coup d'√©tat on the island of Cyprus overthrew Archbishop Makarios III, the Cypriot president. Turkey replied to this intervention by invading Cyprus and occupying the northern part of the island, after heavy fighting with the Cypriot and Greek ELDYK Forces (, 'Greek Force for Cyprus'). During a military council, Ioannidis is reported to have said angrily to the American minister Joseph J. Sisco (who was present) \\"You betrayed us! You had assured us that you would prevent any Turkish landing\\". There was a well-founded fear that an all-out war with Turkey was imminent. The Cyprus fiasco led to senior Greek military officers withdrawing their support for Junta strongman Brigadier Dimitrios Ioannidis. Junta-appointed President Phaedon Gizikis called a meeting of old guard politicians, including Panagiotis Kanellopoulos, Spiros Markezinis, Stephanos Stephanopoulos, Evangelos Averoff, and others. The agenda was to appoint a national unity government that would lead the country to elections. Although former Prime Minister Panagiotis Kanellopoulos was originally backed, on 23 July, Gizikis finally invited former Prime Minister Konstantinos Karamanlis, who had resided in Paris since 1963, to assume the role. Karamanlis returned to Athens on a French Presidency Learjet made available to him by President Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing, a close personal friend, and was sworn-in as Prime Minister under President Phaedon Gizikis. Karamanlis' new party, New Democracy, won the November 1974 general election, and he became prime minister. Konstantinos Karamanlis led the country's transition to democracy, the establishment of the Third Hellenic Republic, the trial of the junta leaders, and the purge of the Army of its members. Parliamentary democracy was thus restored and the Greek legislative elections of 1974 were the first free elections held in a decade. A referendum held 8 December 1974 rejected re-establishment of the monarchy by a 2-to-1 margin, and Greece became a republic.\\"Greeks Spurn Monarchy,\\" Deseret News 9 December 1974, p. 1A https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=Aul- kAQHnToC&dat;=19741209&printsec;=frontpage&hl;=en While the physical collapse of the junta as a government was immediately caused by the Cyprus debacle, its ideological collapse was already triggered by the 1973 Athens Polytechnic uprising. The uprising at the Polytechneion was the event that discredited the military government most and acted as a key catalyst for its eventual demise by exposing the internal contradictions and stresses of the regime, thus destroying the myth of the political cohesion of the junta and, therefore, irreparably damaging the political credibility of the and its message.  Trials of the junta (1975) In January 1975 the junta members were arrested and in early August of the same year the government of Konstantinos Karamanlis brought charges of high treason and insurrection against Georgios Papadopoulos and nineteen other co-conspirators of the military junta.The Colonels on Trial Time.

Legacy and Greek public opinion The historical repercussions of the junta were profound and are still felt to this day in Greece. Internally the absence of civil rights and the oppression that followed created a sense of fear and persecution among many in the population creating trauma and division that persisted long after the fall of the junta.

Golden Dawn's leader, Nikolaos Michaloliakos, met the leaders of the junta while in prison and was inspired to lay the foundations for the party.

Life He was born in Edgeworthstown, County Longford, Ireland, the son of Robert Edgeworth, the Church of Ireland rector of Edgeworthstown. His mother Martha Ussher is often referred to as a granddaughter of Archbishop Ussher, but was in fact drawn from a different branch of that family.CHRISTOPHER USSHER, Esq, Parish of Moyacomb When he was about four, his father converted to Roman Catholicism, resigned his living and emigrated to Toulouse, where the boy was brought up by the Jesuits. In 1769, after his father's death, he went to Paris to be trained for the priesthood. On taking orders he assumed the additional surname of de Firmont, from the family estate of Firmount near Edgeworthstown. The Abb√© Edgeworth. Though he originally studied with a view to becoming a missionary, he decided to remain in Paris, devoting himself especially to the Irish and English Roman Catholics. Through his father and the Archbishop of Paris he became vicar-general of the diocese of Paris and friend of the royal family and stayed with them during the French Revolution. In 1791 he became confessor to the Princess Elizabeth, sister of Louis XVI, and earned the respect even of the sans-culottes by his courage and devotion. By Madame Elizabeth he was recommended to the king when Louis' trial was impending; and after Louis' condemnation to death he was able to obtain permission to celebrate mass for him and attend him on the scaffold, where he recommended the king to allow his hands to be tied, with the words: \\"Sire, in this new outrage I see only the last trait of resemblance between your Majesty and the God who will be your reward.\\" It is said that at the moment of the execution, the confessor uttered the celebrated words: \\"Son of St Louis, ascend to heaven\\" (although this is disputed; Edgeworth himself, in his memoirs, could neither affirm nor deny themMemoirs of the Abb√© Edgeworth).

In spite of the danger he now ran, Edgeworth refused to leave France so long as he could be of any service to Madame Elizabeth, with whom he still managed to correspond. At length, in 1795, his mother having meanwhile died in prison, where his sister was also confined, he succeeded in escaping to England, then Scotland, carrying with him Elizabeth's last message to her brother, the future King Charles X whom he found in Edinburgh. Henry's brother, Ussher, who resided near Edgeworthstown, along with relatives there (including novelist Maria Edgeworth), were keen for him to return to Ireland. Instead, he went with some papers to Monsieur (Louis XVIII) at Blankenburg in Brunswick, by whom he was induced to accompany him to Mittau, in Russia, where he died of a fever contracted while attending French prisoners in 1807. Louis XVIII wrote his epitaph, a copy of which, together with a letter of condolence, was sent by Louis' orders to Mr Ussher Edgeworth in Ireland.

The carbonyl group is most commonly a ketone or an aldehyde. It is considered the most important way to make amines, and a majority of amines made in the pharmaceutical industry are made this way. Reaction process In this organic reaction, the amine first reacts with the carbonyl group to form a hemiaminal species, which subsequently loses one molecule of water in a reversible manner by alkylimino-de-oxo-bisubstitution, to form the imine. The equilibrium between aldehyde/ketone and imine can be shifted toward imine formation by removal of the formed water through physical or chemical means. This intermediate imine can then be isolated and reduced with a suitable reducing agent (e.g., sodium borohydride). This method is sometimes called indirect reductive amination. Imine formation and reduction occur sequentially in one pot. This approach, known as direct reductive amination, employs reducing agents that are more reactive toward protonated imines than towards the ketone/aldehyde precursors. These hydride reagents also must tolerate moderately acidic conditions. Typical reagents that meet these criteria include sodium cyanoborohydride (NaBH3CN) and sodium triacetoxyborohydride (NaBH(OCOCH3)3). This reaction can be performed in an aqueous environment, which casts doubt on the necessity of forming the imine. Possibly the reaction proceeds via reduction of the hemiaminal species.  Variations and related reactions  This reaction is related to the Eschweiler‚ÄìClarke reaction, in which amines are methylated to tertiary amines, the Leuckart‚ÄìWallach reaction, or by other amine alkylation methods such as the Mannich reaction and Petasis reaction. A classic named reaction is the Mignonac reaction (1921) involving reaction of a ketone with ammonia over a nickel catalyst for example in a synthesis of 1-phenylethylamine starting from acetophenone: :Reductive amination acetophenone ammonia Nowadays, one-pot reductive amination fulfil by acid-metal catalysts that act as a hydride transfer. Much research study on this kind of reaction show high efficiency. In industry, tertiary amines such as triethylamine and diisopropylethylamine are formed directly from ketones with a gaseous mixture of ammonia and hydrogen and a suitable catalyst. Biochemistry A step in the biosynthesis of many Œ±-amino acids is the reductive amination of an Œ±-ketoacid, usually by a transaminase enzyme. The process is catalyzed by pyridoxamine phosphate, which is converted into pyridoxal phosphate after the reaction. The initial step entails formation of an imine, but the hydride equivalents are supplied by a reduced pyridine to give an aldimine, which hydrolyzes to the amine.Nelson, D. L.; Cox, M. M. \\"Lehninger, Principles of Biochemistry\\" 3rd Ed. Worth Publishing: New York, 2000. . The sequence from keto-acid to amino acid can be summarized as follows: :HO2CC(O)R ‚Üí HO2CC(=NCH2‚ÄìX)R ‚Üí HO2CCH(N=CH‚ÄìX)R ‚Üí HO2CCH(NH2)R. In popular culture In the critically acclaimed drama Breaking Bad, main character Walter White uses the reductive amination reaction to produce his high purity methamphetamine, relying on 2-phenyl-propanone and methylamine. The 2-phenyl-propanone (otherwise known as phenylacetone or P2P) is produced from phenylacetic acid and acetic acid using a tube furnace and thorium dioxide (ThO2) as a catalyst.

Prior to 1973 it was an independent town, incorporated in 1915, but amalgamation with the town of Hespeler, Ontario, the city of Galt, Ontario and the village of Blair formed the new municipality of Cambridge. Parts of the surrounding townships were also included. No population data is available for the former Preston since the Census reports cover only the full area of Cambridge, though the combined population of the census tracts covering the majority of Preston reported a population of 20,008 as of the 2016 Canada Census.Population calculated by adding data for Census Tracts 0127.01, 0127.02, 0128.00, 0129.01, 0129.02 The first mayor of Cambridge was Claudette Millar. There was considerable resistance among the local population to this \\"shotgun marriage\\" arranged by the provincial government and a healthy sense of rivalry had always governed relations among the three communities. Even today, though many residents refer to their area of Cambridge as being Galt or Preston or Hespeler. Each unique centre has its own history that is well documented in the Cambridge City Archives. The former Preston is located on the western side of the city at the confluence of the Grand River and Speed River. Downtown Preston is commonly considered to be bounded on the north by the entrance to Riverside Park on King Street, and on the south by the King and Bishop plaza. History An interurban streetcar connected Preston to neighbouring towns. Preston was originally formed on land belonging to the German Company Tract, along the Speed River, which was purchased earlier from the Six Nations Indians. The name Preston is named for the hometown of William Scollick, who was surveyor and a native of Preston, Lancashire in England. In the 1800s a group of German-speaking Mennonites from Pennsylvania arrived in the area and purchased land in the area. Among the first settlers to arrive in what was later to become Preston was John Erb, a Mennonite from Lancaster County, who arrived in 1805. He bought including land at the confluence of the Grand and Speed Rivers in what later became Preston. It was John Erb who bought the of land and settled it in 1805. He later built a sawmill in 1806 and a gristmill in 1807. This settlement became known as Cambridge Mills. Even in the early 1800s, the area included homes, a store, an inn, small shops operated by artisans and craftsmen, mostly immigrants from Germany. The Erb sons had hired William Scollick for their development business and the latter completed a full survey in 1834 and convinced the Erbs to rename the Cambridge Mills area Preston. After Erb's death in 1832, a son sold off property on both sides of the Speed River. What eventually became Preston started as a large settlement on the north side. There were only 250 inhabitants in 1836, many from Pennsylvania, but the population had reached about 1600 by 1855, with some 70% originally from Germany. By then, the area had eight hotels and taverns. Some of these hotels, such as the North American Hotel (later called the Kress and still standing) from the 1840s and the later Del Monte (most successful in the 1890s) and the Sulphur Springs, were built to accommodate visitors who arrived via the Great Road to benefit from the mineral springs. The high sulphur content was believed to be useful for those with arthritis and rheumatism. The Canadian Gazetter of 1846 indicates a population of about 600 inhabitants, two churches, a post office that receives mail each day, a steam grist mill, and tradesmen of various types. At the time, there was no significant industry. The Preston post office opened in 1837 and the population continued to grow primarily because of immigration from Germany. Preston was incorporated as a village in 1853. The population declined in the late 1800s but by 1900, it had increased to 2,000 partly because of the new electric railway systems that started in 1894. In 1911, the line reached Hespeler, Berlin (later called Kitchener) and Waterloo; by 1916 it had been extended to Brantford/Port Dover. This made visiting other communities and carrying of goods very convenient. Due to continued growth, by 1879 there were many industries such as a foundry, carriage manufacturer, potteries and a furniture company. This was also the year that the Cherry Flour Mills started, which would later become the Dover Flour Mills, a Preston company that still operates today. The Preston Springs Hotel, then called the Del Monte Hotelt Walder, was operating prior to 1888, and featured of grounds with gardens and lawns. The primary attraction was the mineral baths in the basement, whose high sulphur content was believed to cleanse the body and treat arthritis and rheumatism. A competing facility next door, the Suplphur Springs Hotel, opened in the mid 1890s, and a nearby hotel, the North American (renamed the Kress Hotel in 1900), had opened in 1840. Walder sold the Del Monte in 1903; a later owner, A.R. Kauffman, renamed it Preston Springs, and the facility remained successful as a health spa until 1940. After the war, it closed for some years, eventually becoming a retirement and care facility, until closing in 1990, when the building was boarded up, and remains vacant. The building was vacant since 2012. The city considered issuing a demolition order but in June 2020, the matter was referred to a provincial tribunal that handles disputes on heritage properties. On September 30, 1899 Preston was incorporated as a town with a population of just under 11,000. The Great Road between Dundas and Berlin (Kitchener) as well as the railroad connections helped the community to continue growing into an important industrial centre. Products made here included flour, agricultural implements, furniture, stoves, shoes and textiles. Preston grew and continued to be a successful industrial area; expansion followed in the 1950s and 1960s. While most of the population of what became Waterloo County, Ontario was Protestant in 1911, Preston had a larger share of Roman Catholics, 844, while 862 were Lutherans, 707 Methodists, 704 Anglicans, and 525 Presbyterians. Government The local government is the Cambridge City Council consisting of a mayor and eight councillors, each representing a ward. The mayor (2014-2018 term) is Doug Craig. Region of Waterloo Headquarters in Kitchener Cambridge is also represented on the higher-tier Waterloo Regional Council which consists of the Regional Chair, the Mayors of the seven cities and townships, and eight additional Councilors - four from Kitchener and two each from Cambridge and Waterloo. Ken Seiling has held the position of Regional Chair since 1985. Cambridge is represented in Ottawa by Bryan May (Liberal), the federal member of Parliament who defeated the previous incumbent MP (Gary Goodyear, Conservative ‚Äì 2004 to 2015) in the October 2015 election. The MPP for Cambridge is Belinda Karahalios of the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party, who was first elected to this position in 2018. Municipal services Prestion was an independent entity in Waterloo County, Ontario until 1973 when amalgamation created the Regional Municipality of Waterloo. At that time, Preston was amalgamated into the new city of Cambridge. The Region handles many services, including Fire, Police, waste management, community health, transit, recreation, planning, roads and social services. The Region consists of the cities of Cambridge, Kitchener, and Waterloo, and the townships of Woolwich, Wilmot, Wellesley, and North Dumfries. =Public transportation= Since 2000, public transport throughout the Region of Waterloo has been provided by Grand River Transit, which was created by a merger of the former Cambridge Transit and Kitchener Transit. Grand River Transit bus in Cambridge GRT operates a number of routes in Cambridge, four of which travel outside of the city: presently the 206 (Previously the 52), 61, 72, and 111 buses run to southern Kitchener, while the iXpress limited-stop express route runs from the Ainslie St. Transit Terminal (Galt) through Kitchener to the north end of Waterloo. In June 2009 Regional Council voted to approve a plan to construct a light rail line, which has been named the Ion rapid transit. The first phase would run from Conestoga Mall in the north of Waterloo, to Fairview Park Mall in the south of Kitchener. The second phase of the line would run from Fairview Mall to the Galt area of Cambridge. Mayor Doug Craig was a determined opponent of the plan. He felt that a series of buses would be just as effective but much less expensive. As of late February 2017, the Kitchener- Waterloo portion was well into the final phase of construction, but plans for the Cambridge section of the LRT were still in the very early stage. Public consultations were just getting started at the time. Three routes had been agreed on in 2011, with eight \\"endorsed\\" stops: at Fairway, Sportsworld, Preston, Pinebush, Cambridge Centre Mall, Can-Amera, Delta and Ainslie Street Terminal. Three others were still being considered. Education Public English-language schooling is provided by the Waterloo Region District School Board, which operates 26 elementary and five secondary schools in Cambridge. Publicly funded Catholic education is available through schools operated by the Waterloo Catholic District School Board. Preston is home to one high school, Preston High; one public middle school, William G Davis; as well as the elementary schools Preston Public, Coronation Public, Grandview Public, Parkway Public, Ryerson Public, St. Michael's Catholic and St. Joseph's Catholic. The University of Waterloo School of Architecture campus is located in nearby Galt in the Riverside Silk Mill, also known as the Tiger Brand Building. Inside there is a theatre, a fitness room, and the gallery \\"Design at Riverside\\", which is one of two publicly funded galleries dedicated to architecture in Canada. The School of Architecture is home to 380 students who live, study, and learn within the Cambridge community. Parks and trails The main park in Preston is Riverside Park. It is Cambridge's largest community park with an area of 256 acres (1.02 km¬≤.) The park contains a splash pad, two playgrounds, tennis courts, soccer pitch, a skateboard park, picnic areas that can be reserved, and a multitude of walking trails. The baseball fields are used often and on Canada Day there is always an event at the field whether it is a fair, bands at a bandstand, or fireworks. Riverside Park also hosts a fishing derby on Canada Day when support is available. The 7.5 kilometre Mill Run Trail runs north-east from the park at Russ Street, along the banks of the Speed River, to Sheffield Street in the town of Hespeler. On its way, it passes through the hamlet of Speedsville, the former site of Idylwild Park and Chilligo Conservation Area. Also in Preston is Linear Park which has extensive trails for walking, running or biking. At certain points the trail gives a perfect view of the confluence of the Grand and the Speed Rivers. Preston Towne Centre This traditional downtown core area remains quite vibrant and through the B.I.A. has organized a closely knit group of merchants providing a wide range of goods and services in office- related industry, business service industries and licensed restaurants. The target market area is predominately the immediate surrounding residential area, which is constantly growing through new high density developments. In addition, high traffic counts through this area adds to the market potential. The Grist Mill Centre including a new Giant Tiger Department store is a small commercial mall on King Street in Preston.

The village contains smaller hamlets of Southington, Northington, Ashe, Polhampton and Quidhampton the latter two lying to the north of the village. The River Test has its source to the east in Ashe. There is evidence of habitation since the Stone and Bronze Ages with finds and barrows located nearby.History of Overton The area has a history of banknote paper manufacture starting in the 18th century, and Overton Mill, as of March 2020, still produces the paper for pound sterling banknotes for the Bank of England. History =Earliest origins= left The area around Overton has been inhabited for millennia with evidence of Stone Age, Bronze Age and Celtic occupation scattered across the parish and surrounding countryside, including tumuli at Popham Beacons at the southern tip of the parish; Abra Barrow on the boundary south west of Overton; a long barrow to the west of Willesley Warren Farm in the north of the parish; strip lynchets on Rotten Hill and the Harrow Way, an ancient track which runs across the parish north of the village. Roman occupation in the area is shown by the discovery of Roman pottery shards in Little Meadow and the Port Way Roman Road marks the northern boundary of the parish. =10th to 15th century= The development of the village began in earnest during the 10th century when Frithstan, the Bishop of Winchester, in a chartership dated 909, was granted \\"Uferantun\\" by King Edward the Elder. Overton developed over the next century and by the time of the Doomsday Book the settlement included a large number of dwellings, the Church of St Mary and several corn mills primarily due to its location on the River Test. By the 12th century Overton was a significant location with a royal residence, Tidgrove Kings House, being developed just north of Overton. The residence was built for Henry II for use on journeys between Windsor and either Winchester or Hamwych (Southampton) which was the customary port for travel to and from his French possessions. The importance and expansion continued throughout the 12th and 13th centuries facilitated in 1218 by Henry III providing a royal grant to the Bishop of Winchester for a market in \\"his manor of Overton\\" when burgage tenure was introduced. By this period Overton was becoming a major settlement on the north‚Äìsouth route to and from Winchester. In 1246 Henry III granted a fair on the \\"eve, feast and morrow of the Translation of St. Thomas of Canterbury\\" which can be considered as the first \\"official\\" sheep fair and by the late 13th century Overton had grown to such a size that in 1295 two representatives were sent to Parliament and by the early 14th century the town was providing a rent of ¬£12 0s 9¬Ωd to the bishopric (equivalent to ¬£2.75 million in 2015). Overton was significantly impacted by the Black Death, rents fell by over a half, parliamentary representatives were withdrawn to save costs, the tourns (medieval courts) were not held and the population stagnated. Despite this stagnation Overton survived by consolidating farms and by support from the bishopric though the effects lasted until the end of the 14th century. By the 15th century trade began to increase enough to support an inn and the White Hart, the oldest inn in Overton, was first recorded in 1442. In this period a new fulling mill was built and there was a large increase in population. It was in this period that Thomas Wolsey, Bishop of Winchester, obtained licence in 1519 to hold an additional fair at Overton on the \\"eve, the feast and the morrow of the Feast of St. George the Marty\\". =Tudor to Georgian expansion= By the start of the 16th century a period of growth was established with expansion westward along the River Test. The economy in the area was still primarily agricultural based around sheep and corn; with the sheep fair recording 30,000 average sheep penned. The economy was also being bolstered by the increase of mills along the River Test including corn mills, fulling mills and silk mills. With the increase in prosperity came a desire for greater power, the freeholders began to choose their own officers; port reeve, constable, bailiffs, beer-tasters and leather sealers at the court leet of the borough. Despite this in 1587 the Court of Chancery deemed that Overton should lose its charter as a town 'through neglect' and it reverted to being a village. A significant impact on Overton was the development of papermaking within the area by Henry Portal a French Huguenot who took the lease on Bere Mill on the River Test, between Overton and Whitchurch, in 1712. By this time the focus of the village was the west‚Äìeast route from London to the West Country and in 1754 the road was turnpiked and what is now the High Street had a large number of inns to service the Stagecoach Passengers. In 1805 Overton was one of the changes of horses for the post chaise of Lieutenant Lapenotiere, HMS Pickle who carried the historic dispatches of Lord Nelson's victory and death in the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805. This event is commemorated by the Trafalgar Way, the plaque being located on the village library. =Victorian Age= The major impact on the village in the Victorian era was the arrival of the railways with the London and South Western Railway opening the West of England Main Line and Overton railway station in 1854. The railway caused problems for the local inns and the New Inn, which had only been built in 1770 was sold and demolished in 1860. The vacant site of the New Inn was donated by George Lamb for the building of the new village school. Lamb paid for the building of the school and land for a separate infants school in Red Lion Lane. These two schools, opened in 1868 and 1871 served the town for nearly a hundred years when the junior and infants schools were combined at a new school in Court Drove. Geography The civil parish of Overton covers 3,471 hectares ‚Äì an area about seven miles north to south (from Polhampton to the A303) and two and a half miles east to west (Ashe Park Lodge to Southington Lodge at Laverstoke Park) and is located in the County of Hampshire. Most of Overton parish is entirely rural with the north of the parish being in the North Wessex Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The River Test, a chalk stream world-famous for its trout fishing, rises about a mile east of Overton at Ashe during normal rainfall conditions though the source can migrate eastwards as far as Oakley in a period of very heavy rainfall. The river flows westwards through the village, historically powering a number of mills, towards Whitchurch before it meanders southwards through Hampshire, eventually reaching the sea at Eling near Southampton. Geology The underlying geology ‚Äì primarily chalk, with alluvial deposits adjacent to the river ‚Äì results in typical chalk rolling countryside. The lowest parts of the village are about 80 meters above sea level, but the northern and southern extremities of the parish rise to between 160 and 200 meters, offering extensive views of the surrounding area. Governance The village is a civil parish and part of the Overton, Laverstoke and Steventon ward of Basingstoke and Deane borough council. The borough council is a Non-metropolitan district of Hampshire County Council. Papermaking Henry Portal founded Portals Paper Mill at Bere Mill, on the River Test between Overton and Whitchurch, in 1712, adding Laverstoke Mill to his enterprise seven years later which allowed him to win the contract to make banknote paper for the Bank of England in 1724. Portals significantly expanded in the 20th Century with the development of a new Overton Mill near Quidhampton in 1922 and the Bank of England relocated a significant number of employees to the area during World War II. Papermaking is still undertaken within the village at the Overton Mill which produces high-security paper for over 150 national currencies. In 1995 the firm was sold to De La Rue and the Portals name was lost only for it to return in 2018 when De La Rue sold its papermaking assets to Epiris who resurrected the Portals name. The historic Laverstoke Mill has been refurbished is now used by Bombay Sapphire with a visitors centre. The location of the Portals Mill at Quidhampton has been referenced as the reason why ¬£1 is known as a \\"Quid\\", however there are many disputed origins and, given the various locations for Portals Papermills around the Overton area over the last three centuries, it is probably unlikely. Church of St Mary Overton church, dedicated to St Mary, has medieval origins though the current church building is from the late Norman period in architecture. Although only the nave pillars remain of the original church, there is a record that in 1180 it had a nave of three bays. The old church probably had narrow aisles and a small chancel, the expansion of the church occurred in the 13C with new chancel windows, north and south, and possibly its single frame roof with tie beams. At that time the aisles of the nave were probably widened to give more room in the nave. For many centuries the Bishop appointed a Rector of Overton church and parish, who very often did not live in it, and he in turn appointed a Vicar, who conducted services and was, in fact, 'the Parson'. The rectors and vicars since 1246 are recorded in a diptych board in the north aisle, near the door of the outer vestry. The present aisles of the nave date from about a hundred years after the first names on that board. The great door of the main (south) entrance may similarly date from about 1350‚Äì1400. It may have been locally made, or perhaps only its lock and hinges are of local construction. The door is unusual in that it folds in the middle. The ornamented ironwork is said to be of Hampshire workmanship. In the late 15th century the tower was rebuilt further west than an earlier one, and the nave and aisles were extended westward to meet it. The new tower had wooden board cladding at the belfry stage, and a timbered spire. The chancel was also enlarged at this time to its present length. On the inner sill of the north-west window in the chancel there is an inscription c.1400. It reads: ‚ÄòHic jacet d¬∞. Willms Savage quondam rector istius ecciesie‚Äô ‚Äì i.e. Here lies Dominus (Master) William Savage, formerly rector of this church. In 1609 the first two bells of the present ring were cast. In 1853 the whole church was re-roofed and some of it rebuilt, however, the rebuilt tower did not last long. A huge crack soon appeared in it, so the spire was removed and the west wall was shored up with foot-square beams of oak at a cost of about ¬£1500. In 1908 the tower was again rebuilt with a spire added in 1913.Church of St Mary, Overton, British Listed Buildings The churchyard is noted for having a large and long-established colony of glow worms (Lampyris noctiluca), which are becoming increasingly rare in the UK.Overton Biodiversity Action Plan , Basingstoke and Deane council, p.42 Present day Bombay Sapphire The current population of the village is 4,315, rising to 4,935 including the hamlets of Laverstoke and Steventon, with the village expanding following the developments at Foxdown, Overton Hill, Charters Hill and Seven Acres. The village has local industry with the Portals Papermill and the recent Bombay Sapphire Development in nearby Laverstoke as well as light industrial units to the north and east of the village. The village has a selection of shops and services and has four Public Houses; The White Hart, The Greyhound, The Red Lion and The Old House at Home. Village School Overton Village School (1868) The first village school was founded in 1817 as a free primary school situated in the workhouse. In 1834 a grant was made available to relocate the school to cottages on the River Test, though the building was never satisfactory and in 1858 a new school situated in the centre of the village at the crossroads was developed. In 1968 a new school was built at the top of Court Drove to meet the needs of modern education and the school has been repeatedly upgraded in 1998, 2001 and 2014. The school has a landscaped playing field, children's play area and formal playgrounds. The school is in the latest inspection (July 2014) rated \\"outstanding\\" by Ofsted. Transport The village is served by Overton railway station on the West of England Main Line, which lies to the north of the village and by a weekday bus service provided by Stagecoach South to Whitchurch, Basingstoke and Andover. Sport and leisure Overton has over 30 acres of sporting facilities that are managed by the Overton Recreation Centre including a 9-hole Golf Course, Cricket Pitches, Football Grounds, Tennis Courts as well as numerous covered venues. Overton also has an outdoor swimming pool at Lordsfield and has many societies ranging from Art to Zumba. =Football= Overton has two football teams, non-League football club Overton United F.C. who play at Bridge Street, and Tron FC play at Berrydown Sports Ground. =Athletics= Overton is the home of Overton Harriers & AC, a successful athletics club, based at the Bridge Street Pavilion. Overton Harriers compete in the Hampshire Road Race League and the Hampshire XC League and were the winners of the Men's Hampshire Road Race League in 2018. Overton Harriers host two races; the 'Overton 5' a road race which takes place in the village and surrounding countryside, and the Combe Gibbet race which is a 16-mile point to point race from Walbury Hill to Overton. =Cricket= Overton Cricket Club play at Bridge Street and Berrydown with three Saturday League teams, a Sunday Friendly team, a Mid-week Twenty20 League side and a youth set-up. =Archery= Originally established in 1962, the Overton Black Arrows archery club was founded to allow members to enjoy all aspects of the sport of archery, from beginner tuition, recreational archery through to competition coaching. Over the last 50 years, the club has established itself as a respected international archery club, with county, regional and national champions as members. Club members have coached and judged at all levels: Team GB members, British Team management, organisation of World Championships and World Games. Members currently shoot a variety of disciplines including Target, Field and Clout using Recurve, Compound and Long Bows. =Sheep Fair= Overton holds a quadrennial Sheep Fair in commemoration of farmers leading sheep through the village for fairs recorded as early as 1246. The modern fair was first held in 2000 and most recently in July 2016. =Overton Mummers= Overton has a group of Mummers, who perform frequently over the Yuletide period outside some of the public houses in the village. =Carfest= Overton is the location of the Children in Need fundraising event Carfest South which is hosted at Southley Farm during August Bank Holiday. Literature In Richard Adams' Watership Down, the rival rabbit warren of Efrafa was located just north of the railway above Northington Farm in Overton. Peacocks Percy and Pierre the Peacocks enjoy the afternoon sun in an Overton back garden Two peacocks, nicknamed ‚ÄòPierre‚Äô and ‚ÄòPercy‚Äô, live in the Dellands area at the top of the village.

Normally either a green herb or red paprika marinade is used when preparing Schwenkbraten. Traditionally, Schwenkbraten is made of pork, but turkey variants have also become popular recently. Schwenkbraten are about the size of a hand in length and width and are about 1 cm to 3 cm thick. # A Schwenker is a grill on which the Schwenker steak typically is grilled. The Schwenker consists of a fire bowl (or just the camp fire) and a swinging grill hung from a tripod or in fewer cases from a gallows-like structure. Schwenkers are sometimes created from various handy materials in an impromptu fashion, but ‚ÄúSchwenk-Grills‚Äù can be purchased in local supermarkets, and in DIY stores. # A person who operates the Schwenker grill is also called Schwenker or less frequently, Schwenkermeister. Grilling is done over an open beech wood fire. Charcoal is sometimes used, but that is regarded as sub-standard because the beech smoke is considered to be an important part of the process. Gas- fueled grills are never used (except in commercial snack bars). Beside the Schwenker, sausages (German bratwurst and French merguez), different vegetables (such as bell peppers), Br√∂tchen (German bread rolls German cuisine), baguette (French type of bread) with garlic butter, potatoes and feta cheese (the latter three protected in aluminium foil) may be grilled. Various side salads (usually a pasta (typically fusilli or spiralini) salad, a potato salad and a green salad), and baguette or Flutes are served with Schwenker. Many prefer specific beers, such as a pils by one of the local breweries, with their Schwenker. Brief history Legend has it that this style of cooking came to the region from South America. The region's Agate cutters had to travel further afield for their supplies as the local deposits became worked out in the early 19th Century and it is said that they enjoyed the Churrascaria they found in Brazil. The main similarity is that large chunks of meat are cooked over an open fire and served with vegetables. The process of grilling the Schwenker is known as ‚ÄúSchwenken‚Äù, which not only describes the grilling process itself but also the social event which surrounds the grilling activity. In Saarland one would not be invited to a barbecue, but would instead be invited ‚ÄúSchwenken‚Äù. Related dishes In the nearby Hunsr√ºck district of Rhineland-Palatinate, the local speciality Spie√übraten is often served along with or instead of Schwenker. Raw meat, most usually pork neck or loin but sometimes also beef is marinated in a mixture of onions, salt and pepper for several hours. The meat is then roasted over an open beech log fire and served with potatoes and grated radish or seasoned cabbage. This is carried out in a similar manner to Schwenker, on a large grill resembling a wheel hanging down above the fire. The wheel is rotated slowly over the fire to ensure even cooking. A dish beyond borders Swinging grills and the aforementioned cuts are gaining popularity. If it's true that the Germans brought it from Brazil, it's also true that Americans brought it back to the U.S. It is popular at beer festivals and other outdoor events and is also served in local restaurants, frequently accompanied with bratkartoffeln (sliced fried potatoes), onions and sweet cucumber. For many years the town of Idar-Oberstein hosted an annual Spie√übraten Festival.

The MS-DOS version is titled The Faery Tale Adventure: Book I. Microillusions also released a \\"Book 1\\" version for the Amiga which was going to be the start of a series of games, according to Talin, but bankruptcy prevented it. The initial version was produced for the Amiga 1000 and featured the largest game world to that date. A sequel, Halls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II, was released in 1997. Gameplay Amiga screenshot The gameplay resembles that of Ultima VII (1992). It featured the largest game world at the time, with over 17,000 computer screens. Each playable character has his strengths and weaknesses. Julian is a brave fighter, Phillip has luck and cleverness, and Kevin is gentle and kind. Each of these attributes affects vital game stats and the success of the quest: *A high Bravery score contributes to Vitality (\\"Vit\\"), the character's health. It can be increased by slaying enemies. *Luck determines the number of times that a brother can be brought back from death if he is killed during the quest. If Luck runs out, the next brother must take up the quest. *Kindness is important for certain key chapters in the game. It can be increased by acts of kindness, such as giving alms to beggars. The technique used to store such a huge world involved creating small-sized maps out of small blocks. Those small maps were reused and fit together seamlessly to form larger areas. Loading is asynchronous, and will happen when nearing the boundary of an area, without affecting the smooth scrolling, animation, and music. Plot The game is based around the quest of three brothers to retrieve the talisman stolen by the forces of evil and return it to their home village, Tambry, in the country of Holm. The player begins as Julian, the eldest of the three brothers; if unsuccessful with this character, the player thens take control of Philip, the next oldest, then finally the youngest of the three, Kevin. In addition to recovering the talisman, which is kept by an evil necromancer, the player must complete a number of other tasks which ultimately prove vital to the quest - save the king's daughter, gain the aid of a sea turtle, and kill an evil witch in her castle - and gather a number of artefacts which enable access to the strange dimension in which the necromancer resides. Development David Joiner designed The Faery Tale Adventure and was also responsible for the audio of Defender of the Crown II (1993), engineering for SimCity 4: Rush Hour (2003), and contributions to The Sims 2: Ultimate Collection. This game was first released on the Amiga and then ported to other systems. Eventually it was released for the Commodore 64 and MS-DOS, although the graphics for these ports were of substantially lower quality due to hardware limitations. The Amiga version displays two screens as seen in the screenshot, one \\"lowres\\" 320 and one \\"hires\\" 640 pixels wide, allowing 64 + 16 colors. In 1988, a port was developed for the Macintosh with 256 color graphics (more colors than the original Amiga version of the game). Unfortunately, the only color Macintosh model at the time was the Macintosh II, which was prohibitively expensive for a successful gaming platform. The Macintosh port was never released, but a working beta was completedMacintosh screen capture of The Faery Tale Adventure before the development was cancelled. Eventually New World Computing acquired MicroIllusions and in 1991 ported the game to the Sega Genesis which was published by Electronic Arts. Reception A review in Computer Gaming World described the game's user interface as natural and simple, while still being an impressive and playable game. The magazine stated that the Sega Genesis version \\"subtly improved on the original\\", such as a better teleportation system, while maintaining virtues such as excellent graphics. Dragon gave the computer game 4 1/2 out of 5 stars, and 4 out of 5 stars for the Genesis version. In 1996 Computer Gaming World ranked it as the 63rd best game of all time, calling it \\"Real time adventure at its Amiga best.\\" Legacy The sequel, Halls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II, was developed by The Dreamers Guild and released by Encore, Inc. for MS-DOS and Windows in 1997. Its gameplay and graphics resemble Ultima VIII: Pagan. An Amiga port was under development, but it was cancelled upon the bankruptcy of publisher Hollyware Entertainment. It continues the exploits of three brothers ‚Äì strong Julian, agile Phillip, and wise Kevin, as they once again try to rid the world of evil. Next Generation reviewed the game, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \\"All in all, unless your desire for adventure outweighs your desire for a game with a sane interface, give this one a miss.\\" References ;Notes ;Footnotes External links *The Faery Tale Adventure at MobyGames *Halls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II at MobyGames *The Faery Tale Adventure at Hall of Light Category:1987 video games Category:Action role-playing video games Category:Amiga games Category:Cancelled Mac OS games Category:Commodore 64 games Category:DOS games Category:Electronic Arts games Category:Fantasy video games Category:New World Computing games Category:Sega Genesis games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games featuring female antagonists Category:Video games about witchcraft ","title":"The Faery Tale Adventure"},{"id":"2149971","text":"Research balloon ready for launch Research balloons are balloons that are used for scientific research.

Research balloons usually study a single aspect of science, such as air pollution, air temperature, or wind currents, although sometimes several experiments or equipment are flown together. Malcolm Ross piloting a research balloon down from the stratosphere Other than weather balloons, few research balloons are launched every year. This is driven by the large cost of the balloon, the instrument, which is usually custom made, and the cost of the launch. Because of the altitude reached by most research balloons, the air is too thin and too cold for humans to survive, therefore most research balloons are unmanned and operated remotely. There have been some balloons equipped with pressurized cabins, beginning with professor Auguste Piccard in the 1930s. Research balloons are not only used on earth.

CIN is the amount of energy required to overcome the negatively buoyant energy the environment exerts on an air parcel. In most cases, when CIN exists, it covers a layer from the ground to the level of free convection (LFC). The negatively buoyant energy exerted on an air parcel is a result of the air parcel being cooler (denser) than the air which surrounds it, which causes the air parcel to accelerate downward. The layer of air dominated by CIN is warmer and more stable than the layers above or below it. The situation in which convective inhibition is measured is when layers of warmer air are above a particular region of air. The effect of having warm air above a cooler air parcel is to prevent the cooler air parcel from rising into the atmosphere. This creates a stable region of air. Convective inhibition indicates the amount of energy that will be required to force the cooler packet of air to rise. This energy comes from fronts, heating, moistening, or mesoscale convergence boundaries such as outflow and sea breeze boundaries, or orographic lift. Typically, an area with a high convection inhibition number is considered stable and has very little likelihood of developing a thunderstorm. Conceptually, it is the opposite of CAPE. CIN hinders updrafts necessary to produce convective weather, such as thunderstorms. Although, when large amounts of CIN are reduced by heating and moistening during a convective storm, the storm will be more severe than in the case when no CIN was present. CIN is strengthened by low altitude dry air advection and surface air cooling. Surface cooling causes a small capping inversion to form aloft allowing the air to become stable. Incoming weather fronts and short waves influence the strengthening or weakening of CIN. CIN is calculated by measurements recorded electronically by a Rawinsonde (weather balloon) which carries devices which measure weather parameters, such as air temperature and pressure. A single value for CIN is calculated from one balloon ascent by use of the equation below. The z-bottom and z-top limits of integration in the equation represent the bottom and top altitudes (in meters) of a single CIN layer, T_{v,parcel} is the virtual temperature of the specific parcel and T_{v,env} is the virtual temperature of the environment. In many cases, the z-bottom value is the ground and the z-top value is the LFC. CIN is an energy per unit mass and the units of measurement are joules per kilogram (J/kg). CIN is expressed as a negative energy value. CIN values greater than 200 J/kg are sufficient to prevent convection in the atmosphere. \\\\text{CIN} = \\\\int_{z_\\\\text{bottom}}^{z_\\\\text{top}} g \\\\left(\\\\frac{T_\\\\text{v,parcel} - T_\\\\text{v,env}}{T_\\\\text{v,env}}\\\\right)dz The CIN energy value is an important figure on a skew-T log-P diagram and is a helpful value in evaluating the severity of a convective event. On a skew-T log-P diagram, CIN is any area between the warmer environment virtual temperature profile and the cooler parcel virtual temperature profile. CIN is effectively negative buoyancy, expressed B-; the opposite of convective available potential energy (CAPE), which is expressed as B+ or simply B. As with CAPE, CIN is usually expressed in J/kg but may also be expressed as m2/s2, as the values are equivalent. In fact, CIN is sometimes referred to as negative buoyant energy (NBE).

Playing career Known as Mostaza (mustard) because of his off-blond hair,Notas de F√∫tbol article Merlo played his entire career for Club Atl√©tico River Plate as a defensive midfielder. He was part of the midfield that conquered a string of championships under coach √Ångel Labruna between 1975 and 1981, the others being Juan Jos√© L√≥pez and Norberto Alonso. Merlo was, together with goalkeeper Ubaldo Fillol and defender Daniel Passarella, the backbone of that team. River, nonetheless, purchased several players to fill in Merlo's position, because he was considered a great defender, but a liability once the team got the ball. Among them were Ramiro P√©rez, Chamaco Rodr√≠guez, Della Savia, Cierra, Carranza, Pitarch, de los Santos, and Am√©rico Gallego, who ultimately earned Merlo's position. Before retirement, Merlo mentored an up-and-coming midfielder: N√©stor Gorosito. Both Gallego and Gorosito have since met Merlo as rival coaches. Merlo made over 500 appearances for River. He won seven titles during his time at the club and made 42 appearances in the Superclasico, more than any other player in history. Managerial career After the end of his playing career, Merlo studied for an official coach matriculation, and proceeded to train several smaller teams until offered the position of coach at River Plate in 1989, together with Alonso. Merlo and Alonso were dismissed in mid-season after new club president Davicce made good on an election promise to bring Passarella as coach; the team won the championship title, and fans gave Merlo credit for a big part of that success. In 1999, Merlo commanded Atl√©tico Nacional of Colombia during the first half of the season; albeit successful, his managerial choices proved unpopular, and he resigned from his position. He was subsequently replaced by Luis Fernando Suarez, who would eventually win the tournament. Fans later gave credit to Merlo for his part on the title. In 2001, Merlo did the almost-impossible and coached the team that ended a 35-year drought for Racing Club.El Grafico article His serenity and his insistence on taking things one match at a time earned him his nickname \\"paso a paso\\" (step by step), after the sentence he often told anxious fans and reporters.P√°gina 12 article When Carlos Bilardo left Estudiantes de La Plata in 2004, Merlo was offered the post of coach; the team advanced from relegation danger to the top positions, being a contender both in the 2004 Apertura and the 2005 Clausura. Merlo recalls fondly that both his debut (in 1969) and his first goal were both against Estudiantes . In August 2005, Merlo resigned from his post in Estudiantes. A few weeks later, Leonardo Astrada resigned as River Plate coach, and Merlo was brought in his place. On January 9, 2006, following a dim campaign in which River failed to contend for the 2005 Apertura, Merlo resigned as River Plate coach, and Passarella was called to fill in. There is controversy about the way he left River Plate during that pre-season of 2006. It is said that Marcelo Gallardo told him that neither he nor his teammates agreed with \\"his project\\", and that led to many discussions that made Merlo quit the team, and Gallardo is still blamed for Mostaza's sudden departure.El Siglo Article Merlo since went on to unsuccessful spells as managers at Racing Club de Avellaneda and Barcelona Sporting Club of Ecuador.Merlo fue presentado como t√©cnico del Barcelona de Ecuador Clar√≠n, 14 June 2008 Merlo dej√≥ de ser el DT de Barcelona de Guayaquil MDZ online, 9 de diciembre 2008 In 2009, he became the manager of Rosario Central but left the club on 15 April 2009 after only five games in charge (won 3, tied 1, and lost 1) because of personal problems with the player Ezequiel Gonz√°lez.Miguel Angel Russo lleg√≥ a Rosario Central y Diego Simeone lo reemplazar√° en San Lorenzo Merlo returned to managerial functions on February 2013, hired by Club Douglas Haig, playing in Primera B Nacional.\\"Mostaza Merlo vuelve a dirigir: es el nuevo t√©cnico de Douglas Haig\\", Clar√≠n, 13 February 2013 Honours =Player= ;River Plate *Argentine Primera Divisi√≥n (7): Metropolitano 1975, Nacional 1975, Metropolitano 1977, Metropolitano 1979, Nacional 1979, Metropolitano 1980, Nacional 1981 =Manager= ;Racing Club *Argentine Primera Divisi√≥n (1): Apertura 2001 See also *One club man References External links * Recent Argentine Primera statistics at F√∫tbol XXI Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:Argentine footballers Category:Club Atl√©tico River Plate footballers Category:Argentine Primera Divisi√≥n players Category:Sportspeople from Buenos Aires Category:Argentine football managers Category:Club Atl√©tico Los Andes managers Category:Club Atl√©tico River Plate managers Category:Chacarita Juniors managers Category:Club Atl√©tico Belgrano managers Category:Racing Club de Avellaneda managers Category:Estudiantes de La Plata managers Category:Club Bol√≠var managers Category:Atl√©tico Nacional managers Category:Barcelona S.C. managers Category:Rosario Central managers Category:Deportes Temuco managers Category:Primera Divisi√≥n de Chile managers Category:Expatriate football managers in Bolivia Category:Expatriate football managers in Chile Category:Expatriate football managers in Colombia Category:Expatriate football managers in Ecuador Category:Association football midfielders ","title":"Reinaldo Merlo"},{"id":"2149981","text":"An espionage balloon is a balloon used for spying.

They are the military commands that the US military chain of command would use to launch a nuclear strike. Individual countries or specific regions may be included or withheld in the EAM, as specified in the Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP). The SIOP was updated annually until February 2003, when it was replaced by Operations Plan (OPLAN) 8044. Since July 2012, the US nuclear war plan has been OPLAN 8010-12, Strategic Deterrence and Force Employment. Overview EAMs use cryptographic protocols (including such methods as digital signatures) to authenticate the messages, thereby ensuring that they cannot be forged or altered. In the United States, the EAM will be issued from the National Military Command Center (NMCC) at the Pentagon or, if it has been destroyed by an enemy first strike, by the Alternate National Military Command Center - Site R at Raven Rock, Pennsylvania or by the Boeing E-4B National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC). The messages are sent in digital format to nuclear-capable major commands. The messages are then relayed to aircraft that are on alert by the U.S. Strategic Command at Offutt Air Force Base in Omaha, Nebraska, via single-sideband modulation radio transmitters of the High Frequency Global Communications System (formerly known as the Global High Frequency Service). The EAM is relayed to missile-firing nuclear submarines via special transmitters designed for communication with submarines. The transmitters include those designed to operate at Very Low Frequency (VLF). The submarines pick up the message via special antennas. Nuclear-capable forces will then be expected to carry out an EAM without fail. Manned bombers may be recalled, but missiles fired from land-based silos or from submarines cannot be recalled.

Aside from its size and architectural and artistic importance, the mortuary temple is probably best known as the source of inscribed reliefs depicting the advent and defeat of the Sea Peoples during the reign of Ramesses III. Modern identification and excavation One of John Beasley Greene's set of the earliest photos of the temple, showing the second pylon before excavations The first European to describe the temple in modern literature was Vivant Denon, who visited it in 1799‚Äì1801. Jean-Fran√ßois Champollion described it in detail in 1829.Lettres de M. Champollion le jeune, √©crites pendant..., 18th letter Initial excavation of the temple took place sporadically between 1859 and 1899, under the auspices of the Department of Antiquities. During these decades the main temple was cleared, and a large number of the Greco-Roman period buildings, including a substantial Byzantine Church in the second court, were destroyed without notes or records being taken. The further excavation, recording and conservation of the temple has been facilitated in chief part by the Architectural and Epigraphic Surveys of the University of Chicago Oriental Institute, almost continuously since 1924. Description Mortuary Temple of Ramesses III, general view from the south The temple, some long, is of orthodox design, and closely resembles the nearby mortuary temple of Ramesses II (the Ramesseum). The temple precinct measures approximately . by and contains more than of decorated wall reliefs.Medinet Habu by M. Parsons Its walls are relatively well preserved and it is surrounded by a massive mudbrick enclosure, which may have been fortified. The original entrance is through a fortified gate-house, known as a migdol (a common architectural feature of Asiatic fortresses of the time). Just inside the enclosure, to the south, are chapels of Amenirdis I, Shepenupet II and Nitiqret, all of whom had the title of Divine Adoratrice of Amun. The first pylon leads into an open courtyard, lined with colossal statues of Ramesses III as Osiris on one side, and uncarved columns on the other. The second pylon leads into a peristyle hall, again featuring columns in the shape of Ramesses. The third pylon is reached by continuing up a ramp that leads through a columned portico and then opens into a large hypostyle hall (which has lost its roof). Reliefs and actual heads of foreign captives were also found placed within the temple, perhaps in an attempt to symbolise the king's control over Syria and Nubia. In the Greco-Roman and Byzantine period, there was a church inside the temple structure, which has since been removed. Some of the carvings in the main wall of the temple have been altered by Christian carvings. The royal palace was directly connected with the first courtyard of the temple via the \\"Window of Appearances\\".  Minor king list  The Medinet Habu king list is a procession celebrating the festival of Min, with the names of nine pharaohs. It can be found on the upper register of the eastern wall in the second courtyard.

It was formerly the major hospital in its region; however, with the opening of Fiona Stanley Hospital in Murdoch on 3 February 2015, it was substantially downsized, with the closure of its emergency department and a range of other services being relocated to the new hospital. Location The main facility of Fremantle hospital is a historic site and looks out over the nearby fishing boat harbour, the Port of Fremantle and the Indian Ocean.Chris Jeffrey and Phyl Brown (2009) on page 389 and 390 of The western side is bounded by South Terrace, while Hampton Road is on its eastern side. The hospital is also within walking distance of the Fremantle Markets, and Fremantle Oval. History Fremantle Public Hospital opened in 1897 with 52 beds. The building itself was originally a private residence, \\"The Knowle\\", built in 1856 with both stone and labour from Fremantle Prison. Two extra wards and an operating theatre were added in 1900. Subsequent additions included the Ron Doig Block in 1934, the William Wauhop Wing in 1960, the Princess of Wales Wing in 1976. Prior to the opening of Fiona Stanley Hospital, Fremantle Hospital and Health Service provided 575 beds across all campuses, which included Rottnest Island Nursing Post and Kayeela Hospital in East Fremantle. Facilities included 24-hour acute care, emergency department, a paediatric ward, a 66-bed psychiatric and psychogeriatric service. The Hyperbaric Medicine Unit has provided support services for divers in all of Western Australia and clinical services to residents mainly from the immediate area for over 20 years. With the opening of Fiona Stanley Hospital, Fremantle Hospital has become a 300-bed hospital focused on services such as mental health, aged care, secondary rehabilitation, palliative care, and planned surgeries. The Kaleeya campus was closed, with the land sold in December 2014; the Rottnest Island Nursing Post was made an external campus of Fiona Stanley Hospital.

Construction started at the Electrical Communication Laboratories of NTT at Musashino, Tokyo in 1952 and was completed in July 1957. The computer was used until July 1962. Saburo Muroga, a University of Illinois visiting scholar and member of the ILLIAC I team, returned to Japan and oversaw the construction of MUSASINO-1. Using 519 vacuum tubes and 5,400 parametrons, the MUSASINO-1 possessed a magnetic core memory, initially of 32 (later expanded to 256) words. A word was composed of 40 bits, and two instructions could be stored in a single word. Addition time was clocked at 1,350 microseconds, multiplication at 6,800 microseconds, and division time at 26.1 milliseconds. The MUSASINO-1's instruction set was a superset of the ILLIAC I's instructions, so it could generally use the latter's software. However, many of the programs for the ILLIAC used some of the unused bits in the instructions to store data, and these would be interpreted as a different instructions by the MUSASINO-1 control circuitry.

A devout communist in early life, he worked as a reporter for such newspapers as the Soviet Weekly and the Daily Worker, and also served in the British army during the Second World War. He was responsible for writing episodes for such television series as Dr. Finlay's Casebook, Armchair Theatre and Crossroads, and for his work in writing radio scripts won a Writer's Guild Award. He also published a string of novels, written in such disparate genres as crime, romance and fantasy. After being initiated into Alexandrian Wicca by Maxine Sanders in 1970, he subsequently published one of the earliest books to describe this newly burgeoning religion, What Witches Do (1971). Within only a few months of being initiated, he had risen to the position of High Priest and founded his own coven in south London, with Janet Farrar, whom he would later handfast and then legally marry, as his High Priestess. In 1976 the couple moved to Ireland, where they went about founding new covens and initiating new people into Wicca - according to George Knowles, \\"some seventy five percent of Wiccans both in the Republic and North of Ireland can trace their roots back to the Farrar's [sic]\\". This claim is repeated in With Janet, he also set about writing books about the subject, most notably Eight Sabbats for Witches (1981) and The Witches' Way (1984). Because of his work in propagating the Craft, the historian Ronald Hutton compared him to Gerald Gardner and Alex Sanders as \\"the third and last of the great male figures who have formed Wicca\\".Guerra 2008:173. Biography =Early life: 1916-1937= Stewart Farrar was born at his family home of 239 Winchester Road, Highams Park, Essex during the First World War, and as such his father was away serving in the British army, stationed in Salonika in Greece.Guerra 2008. p. 20. His family were middle class and well educated, and were also Christian Scientists, a denomination of Christianity that notably emphasised a belief in spiritual healing over conventional medicine, and which had been founded in 1886. The Farrar family had already been somewhat successful, with a number of them becoming somewhat culturally significant: the first words that had been broadcast by radio across the Atlantic, Guglielmo Marconi's \\"can you hear me, Picken?\\", for instance referred to Stewart's maternal uncle, whilst Stewart's first cousin was the notable poet James Farrar.Guerra 2008. p. 23-26. His father, after being demobbed from the army, took up employment at the London office of the Hong Kong and Shanghai bank, whilst his mother ran a private school in Wallington, Surrey, before later teaching at the Christian Science primary Claremont School in Esher, Surrey, where the Farrar family took up residence in a house on the school‚Äôs grounds. His sister, Jean, was born in 1920, and he subsequently doted on her, but at the same time was known as a bully towards other children at primary school.Guerra 2008 p. 27-28. From 1930 to 1935, Stewart attended the privately run City of London School, meaning that he had to commute daily into the city from his rural home. It was here that he joined the Officer Training Corps, where he learned much about military strategy, but at the same time disapproved of militarism and began to sympathise with left wing politics that were at odds with his conservative upbringing. At 17, he became a socialist, before later taking a further leftist stance by declaring himself a communist and rejecting Christianity, instead defining himself as an \\"interested agnostic\\". In 1935 he began attending University College London, where he studied journalism,Guerra 2008 p. 29-35. and where he served both as president of the London University Journalism Union and editor of the London Union Magazine. After he ended his university education in 1937, he spent three months as an exchange student in Dresden, Germany, where he became fluent in German and also developed an even greater hatred of right wing Nazism than he already held.Guerra 2008 p. 36. = Communism, the army and journalism: 1937-1957 = Returning to Britain, Farrar immersed himself in propagating communism, joining the Communist Party of Great Britain, and working for the communist tabloid, the Daily Worker. In 1939, he fell in love with and married Jean Clarke, a fellow communist.Guerra 2008 p. 40-41. When war broke out against Nazi Germany in 1939, he immediately volunteered for the British army, feeling that he could put his military training to good use to fight against fascism. Instead of being sent abroad to fight, he was stationed in Britain, where he was set to work training new recruits in various combat techniques, and as such was stationed at a variety of different barracks. In 1940 he was stationed at Whitstable, though soon moved to Ashford, and the following year, his first son, Tony, was born. He was subsequently moved to Pembrokeshire in Wales, where he began having an affair with his secretary. Soon after this he divorced his wife, who likewise was also having an affair.Guerra 2008 p. 44-49. Meanwhile, his war work largely involved working as an instructor in Anti-aircraft gunnery during World War II. He also wrote an instruction manual for a Bofors gun.Knowles, Farrar, gives the caliber of the gun as 30 mm. The well-known anti-aircraft Bofors gun was 40 mm. In 1945, he remarried, this time to a woman named Jean Mackinlay who was a lance- corporal in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. She would later provide him with his second child, Andy, just after Farrar himself was demobbed from the army in 1946, following the defeat of Germany.Guerra 2008 p. 49. He was subsequently stationed in Berlin, where he worked as a civilian officer for the Allied Control Commission for Germany, and where, being separated from his second wife, he began to have an affair with his personal assistant, Hilke Carstens, a woman who would be described by Farrar's biographer Elizabeth Guerra as \\"the love of his life and the woman who was to haunt his memories for years to come.\\"Guerra 2008 p. 53. Despite his love for Hilke, who would die of food poisoning only a few years later, Farrar returned to England, where with his wife and son, he moved to Bedford, where she would bear him a second child, a daughter named Lindsay, in 1948.Guerra 2008 p. 54. Setting himself up as a journalist once more, Farrar briefly worked for the international news company Reuters, before becoming the English-language edition editor for the Soviet Weekly, a newspaper published by the Soviet Embassy. It was through this appointment that he became a great friend to a prominent communist Petrovich Baikov, who was First Secretary of the Embassy. Meanwhile, he began to have an affair with Rachael 'Rae' Kaplin, a Jewish teacher who worked as a youth organiser for the Communist Party, and eventually decided to leave his wife and children to move in and live with her. The divorce from his wife would only come through in 1950, and he subsequently married Kaplin, making her his third wife; in 1951 she would bear him his fourth and final child, Judith.Guerra 2008 p. 55-57. The Communist Party later appointed him secretary of the British-Polish Friendship Society, and he would take a delegation of British trade unionists to visit Poland, visiting both the former Nazi extermination camp of Auschwitz and some of the Polish coal mines. However, upon his return to Britain, he began to split from the communist Soviet Union and its policies, particularly after he was shocked at the way that they violently dealt with the Hungarian Uprising in 1957. Whilst remaining a leftist, he disassociated himself with the Communist Party of Great Britain and ceased working for the Daily Worker.Guerra 2008 p. 58-61. = Scriptwriting: 1957-1969 = Disillusioned with the route that the communist powers were taking, and wanting nothing more to do with the Soviet Union and its allies in Britain, he took up a job working first for R.H. Radford, a public relations firm and then Associated British Path√© where he eventually rose to the position of documentary writer.Guerra 2008 p. 61. Meanwhile, his continued infidelity led to him and Kaplin separating in 1953, although it would only be in 1963 that he finally gained a divorce from her. During this time, he had entered into a new relationship with a woman named Beth Donovan, and she encouraged him to continue seeing his children from previous relationships, whom in later life he always regretted neglecting; in 1958 however, they too split up.Guerra 2008 p. 62-63. In 1959, he began yet another relationship, this time with a geography teacher named Barbara Williams, and they moved in together after only 11 days of first meeting. They would divorce in 1967, before remarrying in 1968, subsequently breaking up again the following year.Guerra 2008 p. 65-70. In 1958, Farrar published his first novel, The Snake on 99, a whodunit crime story involving a Welsh detective known as Elwyn Morgan. In 1961 this was followed with Zero in the Gate, another whodunit this time set around a newspaper company, drawing on his prior experiences. Two years later, his third novel, Death in the Wrong Bed, came out, followed by a romance novel, Delphine, Be a Darling, which was published under the female pseudonym of Laurie Stewart at the advice of his publisher.Guerra 2008 p. 64. The first edition cover to Farrar's debut novel, The Snake on 99 In 1961, Farrar was sent by Path√© to Saudi Arabia, where the company was producing a documentary, and during this trip he visited the deserts of both Saudi Arabia and neighbouring Jordan. At the end of the following year, he was employed by ABC Television's Advanced Religious Training Course to train priests and clergymen in television techniques, a job he held for two years, and would later reminisce about getting drunk with two archbishops on one occasion. In 1963 he was then given the chance to write a script for a film, and the result, It's All Over Town, was produced featured the actor Frankie Vaughan. Another of Farrar's most significant works was a documentary series that he scripted entitled Journey of a Lifetime, in which he travelled to the Holy Land in the Middle East to research, and later experienced what he described as an almost spiritual experience while visiting the mediaeval city of Petra.Guerra 2008 p. 66-67. In 1964, he began writing freelance for various British television series, starting with an episode of Dr. Finlay's Casebook, and in later years would write episodes for Armchair Theatre and the soap opera Crossroads. Farrar would also co-write a 90-minute screenplay entitled Pity About the Abbey with his friend, Sir John Betjeman, who would later be made Poet Laureate. Pity About the Abbey was a story in which Westminster Abbey was destroyed to make way for a by-pass, and satirised what Farrar saw as the current trend to demolish significant or beautiful structures. It was filmed and broadcast by the BBC in July 1965.Guerra 2008 p. 68. In 1967, Stewart's wife fell in love with one of his best friends, Norman, and so he granted her a divorce, but remained both her and Norman's friend, carrying no resentment towards them. Feeling alone, he turned to his second wife, Jean Mackinlay, who herself had just recently divorced her second husband, and although she refused his offer of reigniting their relationship, they did once more become friends. In 1968 he would re-united with another former lover, Beth Donovan, and married her, but he would leave her in June 1969 when he met a new woman, Isabel Sutherland, and subsequently moved in with her and her daughter.Guerra 2008 p. 70. Meanwhile, in 1968 he won a Writer‚Äôs Guild Award for his six-part radio serial Watch the Wall my Darling, which was based upon the poem A Smuggler's Song by one of his favourite poets, Rudyard Kipling. Following this, in February of the following year, he once more returned to journalism, taking up employment with the popular weekly magazine Reveille. =Involvement with Wicca: 1969-2000= Farrar was sent by Reveille to a press screening of the film Legend of the Witches. The screening was also attended by Alex Sanders and Maxine Sanders, the founders of Alexandrian Wicca, who had served as advisors during the film's creation. According to his biography at mystica.com, Farrar was \\"skeptical about Witchcraft but was interested in Sanders upon meeting him\\". The paper requested that Farrar interview Sanders and published the interview as a two- part story. Sanders, \\"impressed\\" with the interview, invited Farrar to attend an Alexandrian Wiccan initiation ritual, and prompted Farrar to write an entire book on Wicca. According to mystica.com, Farrar \\"found the ceremony both dignified and moving\\". Farrar began work on his first non-fiction book, What Witches Do, and began taking classes on witchcraft from the Sanders'. Maxine Sanders remembers Farrar as \\"a charming man, a sincere student with an active flexible mind\\". Maxine Sanders also notes that it was in response to Farrar's questions about how to describe their practice in his book that the Alexandrian tradition was named. On 21 February 1970 Farrar was initiated into Alexandrian Wicca and joined the Sanders' coven. Farrar met his future wife, then Janet Owen (34 years his junior), in the coven. Janet Farrar asserts that the couple were both elevated to the second degree \\"in an unoccupied house in Sydenham\\" by the Sanders on 17 October 1970, and that they received the third, and final, degree of initiation in their flat 24 April 1971. Two of Janet and Stewart's coven - \\"Don and Barbara\\" were present, as were the Sanders coven. Janet Farrar remembers the initiation well, as Maxine invoked Sekhmet to banish one of her coven members. She broke her flail during this banishing. Recently their 3rd Degree initiation has been disputed by some Alexandrian \\"revisionists\\", unaware that Stewart Farrar kept an archive of all his correspondences with the Sanders and possessed copies of both his own and the Sanders' coven records that unequivocally prove that the initiation took place. What Witches Do was published in 1971. The book has been called \\"controversial\\" because of Farrar's assertion that Sanders should be \\"ranked above Gerald B. Gardner and alongside of Aleister Crowley and Eliphas Levi in terms of magical achievement\\". Farrar later backed away from the assessment, although he did later state that he believed that Sanders \\"was both a charlatan and a genuine magician\\". The relationship between Alex Sanders and Stewart Farrar became one of mutual respect after letters began to be exchanged between them in 1977. To quote Sanders (8 March 1997): > Your letters give off good vibrations of work and happiness. I feel that all > our growing pains concerning publicity and personalities of the Wicca, are > beginning to bear fruit. A few of us in the midst of many are beginning to > establish the foundation (I mean the building itself) on the raw materials, > to get the foundation stone in place. They remained in dialogue until Alex Sanders' death in the late 1980s. Farrar and Owen had begun running their own coven in 1971, before their third degree initiation ceremony, and were handfasted in 1972 and legally married in 1975. The ceremony was attended by Farrar's two daughters and two sons from three previous marriages - his marriage to Owen was his sixth. The late 1970s saw the publication of several more novels by Farrar, all of which were occult- themed fantasy novels or science fiction. Farrar left Reveille to pursue a full-time freelance writing career in 1974. In 1976 the Farrars moved to Ireland to get away from the busy life of London. They lived in County Mayo and County Wexford, finally settling in \\"Herne Cottage\\" in Kells, County Meath. Both husband and wife went on to publish a number of \\"classic\\" and \\"influential\\" books on the Wiccan religion and on coven practises. Their 1981 Eight Sabbats for Witches included material the authors claimed to be from the Alexandrian tradition's Book of Shadows. The Farrars, with the support of Doreen Valiente, argued in the book that even though the publishing of this material broke their oath of secrecy, it was justified by the need to correct misinformation. Janet Farrar indicates that some of the rituals contained in the couple's books were actually written by them, this includes the Oak King/Holly King cycle which they researched from Robert Grave's \\"White Goddess\\". This was the first use of this cycle in any Wiccan Book of Shadows, and has been adopted into many traditions since. Although they never officially left the Alexandrian tradition, after the book's research was complete they stopped using the term to describe themselves. The couple co- authored four more books on Wicca. They were joined by Gavin Bone, with whom they entered into a \\"polyfidelitous relationship\\". The three of them would co- author two more books; The Healing Craft and The Pagan Path (an investigation into the many varieties of Neopaganism).

PatrolBots are manufactured in various configurations and serve as bases for companies developing delivery robots, security robots, environmental monitoring rovers, robot guides and other indoor service robots.  Capabilities of PatrolBot  PatrolBot can scan buildings, create floor plans and navigate them autonomously using a laser range-finding sensor inside the robot. It employs Monte Carlo/Markov-style localization techniques using a modified value-iterated search technique for navigation. It searches for alternative paths if a hall is blocked, circumnavigates obstacles and re-charges itself at its automated docking/charging station as needed. Using a Wi-Fi system the device can operate autonomously or be controlled remotely.  Applications  Robot software \\"drag-and-drop\\" interface for setting up goals, tasks and routes for autonomous robots. (Courtesy of MobileRobots Inc) PatrolBot is a robotic base used for delivery, security, sensor monitoring, inspection and guidance tasks. It is a reference platform added onto with various carrying attachments, sensors, touchscreens and cameras. While it began primarily as a security robot the platform is now used as a base for a broad range of applications.  Robot Control  Users set up the robot using a GUI interface to give goals, docking location and constraints such as forbidden areas into the robot's map. Then, using drag and drop, an operator can give goal names, tasks and macros into a \\"route\\" or program for the robot to follow. Users can then use set or random sequences for the robot to follow by dragging routes into a weekly schedule. Advanced users can communicate with the robot from external systems or program more advance actions over a command language interface as well as add new sensors. PatrolBot can be sent to goals on demand or can patrol a sequence of goals. Status windows in the control GUI provide read-outs from the sensors as well as proprioceptive information such as battery levels. The robot's data logs are available for security and energy optimization as well as troubleshooting.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 5, 1998. It was written by Ian Maxtone-Graham and directed by Swinton O. Scott III. The episode sees Homer being sent by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to try to obtain a trillion dollar bill that Mr. Burns failed to deliver to Europe during the post-war era. Plot As all of Springfield rushes to send out their tax returns just before midnight on April 15, Homer realizes he did not file his. He rushes and provides false information before delivering it to the post office. The IRS discovers Homer's fraud and arrests him. To avoid prison, Homer agrees to help Agent Johnson of the FBI. With a hidden microphone under his shirt, Homer uncovers that his coworker Charlie is leading a group planning to assault all government officials, and has him arrested by the FBI for conspiracy. Impressed, Johnson reveals to Homer that in 1945, President Harry S. Truman printed a one trillion-dollar bill to help reconstruct post-war Europe and enlisted Montgomery Burns to transport the bill. However, it never arrived and the FBI suspects Burns still has it with him. Homer is sent in to investigate. At the Burns estate, Homer searches for the bill before Burns, who believes Homer is a reporter from Collier's magazine, reveals that he keeps it in his wallet. Johnson and Agent Miller burst in and arrest Burns, who, insisting he's innocent, protests that the government oppresses the average American. Moved by Burns' speech, Homer knocks out the FBI agents and frees Burns. The two men go to Smithers, who suggests they leave the country. Burns takes Smithers and Homer in his old plane, setting off to find an island and start a new country. The three land in Cuba and appear before Fidel Castro. Burns tries to buy the island, but Castro foils his plan when asks to see the trillion-dollar bill and then refuses to give it back. Later, Burns, Smithers, and Homer are on a makeshift raft. Smithers asks whether Burns will be facing jail time; Burns replies that, if it is a crime to love one's country or steal a trillion dollars or bribe a jury, he is guilty.\\"The Trouble with Trillions\\" The Simpsons.com. Retrieved on November 3, 2007 Production The episode was written by Ian Maxtone-Graham, though the original draft of the plot was much different. Originally, Homer was to learn that he was a Native American, and would try to exploit it to not have to pay taxes. The idea had been going well for a few days, but the staff did not actually know whether Native Americans had to pay taxes. When the writers found out that they did, the whole plot had to be scrapped. Executive producer Mike Scully's brother Brian pitched the idea of the trillion-dollar bill, which they accepted, as they were out of ideas. Cultural references The scene where the FBI agent sits near Homer is a reference to the film JFK. While Homer, Mr. Burns, and Smithers are in Cuba, a billboard can be seen with a picture of Che Guevara being used to advertise Duff Beer. Reception In its original broadcast, \\"The Trouble with Trillions\\" finished 51st in ratings for the week of March 30‚ÄìApril 5, 1998, with a Nielsen rating of 7.5, equivalent to approximately 7.4 million viewing households. It was the third highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following World's Wildest Police Videos and Melrose Place. Since airing, the episode has received mixed reviews from television critics. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, did not enjoy the episode, calling it, \\"Rather dull and unfunny\\", adding, \\"A mediocre episode at best that makes Burns out to be altruistic (which he's not) and very stupid in letting Castro have his money (which he so wouldn't).\\" The Daily Telegraph characterized the episode as one of \\"The 10 Best Simpsons TV Episodes\\". The article noted the episode contained \\"one of the few gags in comedy history about relying too heavily on surveillance photography in spying\\". Ian Jones and Steve Williams for Off the Telly criticized all of season 9 for lacking an episode that centered on Burns, as they consider Burns to be the crux of many good episodes, though they noted that \\"The Trouble with Trillions\\" came the closest, with Burns having a supporting role. In a review of The Simpsons ninth season, Isaac Mitchell-Frey of the Herald Sun described the episode as \\"brilliant\\", and highlighted it along with episodes \\"Bart Carny\\" and \\"The Joy of Sect\\". In the United Kingdom, the episode was screened on BBC Two in January 1999, before any other episode from season six or later were seen by viewers on the channel, as part of a night of Cuba-themed programming. The episode had made its UK premiere in June 1998, by the program's primary rights holder in the country, Sky One.

They are made with fish paste and boiled in a soupy broth, or deep fried. They are also common in Nordic countries.  Production  There are two variants of fish balls, each differing in their textures, production method and primary regions they are produced in: *For East Asian fishballs, the fish are either shredded, coarsely ground, or even pounded. The fish then undergoes prolonged mixing with added salt until a smooth texture is attained. This technique, similar to the process of making surimi, uncoils and stretches previously wound and tangled protein strands in the fish, which produces a food with firm \\"bouncy\\" texture. *Scandinavian fish balls are made of completely pureed fish, milk and potato flour (or potato starch), and shaped without additional processing, which produces a softer textured food.  Regional variations  =East Asia=  Fuzhou  In the Fuzhou area, \\"Fuzhou fish balls\\" () are made from fish with a minced pork filling. The variation from Fuqing is much larger.  Hong Kong and Macau There are three kinds of fishballs, known as (literally \\"fish eggs\\"), sold in Hong Kong and Macau. They are yellow, white and golden. Fishballs are a popular street food in Hong Kong and the 2016 Mong Kok civil unrest, which escalated from the government's crackdown on unlicensed street hawkers during the Chinese New Year holidays have been referred to by some media outlets and social media platforms as the \\"Fishball Revolution\\" (). = Yellow (street food) = Smaller in size, made from cheaper fish than the white variety, they are usually sold at food stalls with five to seven balls on a bamboo skewer. The fish balls are usually boiled in a spicy curry sauce. Virtually every street stall creates its own recipe of curry satay sauce to differentiate them from other sellers. Fish balls are one of the city's most popular and representative \\"street foods\\" (). = White (restaurant) = White fish balls are larger in size and made with white fish such as Spanish mackerel, pounded many times until the fish is a fine paste. Salt can be added, or egg whites and corn starch, but generally no other ingredients are added. The balls are then cooked by boiling. As a result of this cooking method, these fish balls are white in color. White fish balls should have an elastic (bouncy) and fluffy texture and a strong taste of fish. They are made using a more costly fish, and has a considerably different texture and taste. This kind is usually served to complement noodles at Ch√°ozh≈çu-style noodle restaurants,Man, Joyce \\"Aberdeen's best fish ball shop to close\\" CNN Go. 24 February 2012.

Distinguishing features include size, sauce and texture. They can be fist-sized and are served with a special curry sauce, and are mainly made from fresh fish which makes the texture more smooth. = Ingredients = The basic ingredients are fish, flour and flavourings such as salt and sugar, can also be used. The proportions depend on the quality and type to be made. The white fish balls found in some traditional Hong Kong restaurants are made using fresh fish; while street style are made using cheap fish and a mixture of flour to reduce costs. Flathead mullet () and Daggertooth pike conger () are common choices. Originally, to reduce costs, they were likely made by mixing and frying the remaining materials of Chaozhou fish ball () or stale fish. More recently, they began to be imported and nowadays, they are mainly imported by wholesalers and the texture is more consistent.„Ää50Á∂ìÂÖ∏Â∞èÂêÉ„ÄãÂàäÊñº2003/01/10„ÄäÈ£≤È£üÁî∑Â•≥„Äã  Taiwan  Milkfish balls () are frequently found in Taiwan.

They are round in shape, most often made from cuttlefish or pollock, and served with a sweet and spicy sauce or with a thick, black, sweet and sour sauce. Fish balls in the Philippines are sold by street vendors pushing wooden deep-frying carts. The balls are served skewered, offered with three kinds of dipping sauces: spicy (white/orange coloured) ‚Äì vinegar, water, diced onions and garlic; sweet (brown gravy coloured) ‚Äì corn starch, banana ketchup, sugar and salt; and sweet/sour (amber or deeper orange coloured) ‚Äì the sweet variety with many small hot chilis added. Dark sauces are rare, as these are soy sauce-based and soy sauce is expensive for street food. A recent trend in the industry is the introduction of varieties: chicken, squid (cuttlefish actually), and elongated versions of fishballs inaccurately called \\"kikiam\\". The latter, however, are completely different dishes from true kikiam (a Filipino version of Hokkien ngo hiang).  Thailand  Fish balls are very popular in Thai cuisine. They are usually fried or grilled as a snack. In Chinese-influenced restaurants, fish balls are cooked in noodle soups and come in many varieties. They can also be eaten in a Thai curry.

The end result of this conflict was a Macedonian victory which confirmed Antigonid control over the city-states of Greece. The origins of the war lie in the continuing desire of many Greek city-states, most notably Athens and Sparta, for a restoration of their former independence along with the Ptolemaic desire to stir up discontent within the sphere of influence of its Macedonian rival. Ptolemy Philadelphus's ambitions in the Aegean were threatened by Antigonus Gonatas's fleet, so he carefully built up an anti-Macedonian coalition amongst the Greek city-states. He especially concentrated on courting Athens, by supplying the city with grain. The anti-Macedonian faction in Athens, led by the stoic Chremonides, took power and proceeded to declare war on Macedon (possibly as early as the autumn of 268 BC). The first year of the conflict saw only minor confrontations, though they generally ended favourably for the anti-Macedonian coalition. After the indecisive campaign season of 266 BC, in which Athens was assisted by a Ptolemaic fleet under Patroclus, the war began to turn against the Greek city-states, and in 265 BC Antigonus won a decisive and crushing victory outside Corinth during which the Spartan King Areus I was killed. With their primary ally defeated and too militarily weak to confront the Antigonids alone, the Athenians could do little but wait behind their walls and hope the Ptolemies could send aid before the inevitable siege. Unfortunately for them, however, Philadelphus would not be ready to mount a major expedition until after Athens had already been starved into surrender in either 262 BC or 261 BC. In the end it did not matter since when the Ptolemies finally tried to send aid and reinforcements to Athens, their fleet was defeated off Cos (probably in 261 BC). This action, called the Battle of Cos, also features in the narrative of the second of the Syrian Wars with a strong alternative date of 258 or 255 BC. After the end of the war, Athens lost her last pre-Hellenistic vestiges of political independence.

He was born in the County of Ross and Cromarty, Scotland, on 27 July 1896, and educated at Invergordon and Inverness. In May 1927, he married Sybil Elizabeth Baldwin. Military career When the First World War began in 1914, George enlisted in the Seaforth Highlanders and was sent to France.Air Vice-Marshal Sir Robert George Air of Authority ‚Äì A History of RAF Organisation He was transferred to the Royal Flying Corps and was awarded the Military Cross for his night bombing. In 1919 he was appointed to a permanent commission in the Royal Air Force. He was appointed Officer Commanding No. 100 Squadron in 1930 and Officer Commanding No. 33 Squadron in 1932. George later served as Senior Air Staff Officer at Headquarters RAF Far East in Singapore from 1934 and as Station Commander at RAF Hawkinge from 1937. At the outbreak of the Second World War he was Air Attach√© in Ankara. He went on to be Air Officer Commanding AHQ Iraq and Persia in 1944. After the War he served as Air Attach√© in Paris until he retired in 1952. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1944 and a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1948, promoted to substantive air vice marshal in 1950 and knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1952. Governor of South Australia Sir Robert was appointed Governor of South Australia in August 1952. He and Lady George arrived in Adelaide early the following year. The Premier, Sir Thomas Playford, noted in his welcome address to Sir Robert that governors were expected to be \\"an inspiration in times of danger.\\" Playford's words turned out to be portentous ‚Äì South Australia would suffer through earthquake, fire and flood in consecutive years during Sir Robert's tenure. In March 1954, the worst earthquake in Adelaide's history damaged Government House, along with many other buildings in the city. Less than a year later, the Governor's summer residence at Marble Hill was destroyed in the Black Sunday bushfires of January 1955. He and his wife and staff sheltered under wet blankets in the driveway, and were lucky to escape with their lives. In a particularly cruel twist of fate, all Sir Robert and Lady George's possessions were lost in the fire, having been relocated to Marble Hill while Government House was undergoing repairs for the damage suffered in the earthquake.Australian Dictionary of Biography Online ‚Äì George, Sir Robert Allingham Finally, the 1956 Murray River flood was the largest in recorded history. On 20 August, Sir Robert surveyed the flood-hit areas in a light aircraft, and said he was \\"appalled at the tremendous area underwater and the terrific damage which had resulted.\\" Sir Robert was a colourful governor, once demanding a personal helicopter from Premier Playford. Although admired for his bravery, Sir Robert was considered old-fashioned by the masses, particularly due to his impatience, polo-playing, and his habit of carrying a fly-whisk and a cane. Lady George was an ardent supporter of many charities, but her support for traditional family roles was not popular with the emerging feminists; once, while officiating at the opening of new laboratories at a girls' college, she claimed: \\"The most important thing for a girl is to learn how to run a home well.\\" Despite their frequent clashes, Playford supported George and the dignity of the Vice-Regal post in a 1956 court case regarding the cook's wages. The prosecuting lawyer was future Labor premier Don Dunstan. Playford negotiated an out-of-court settlement on condition that Dunstan and his Labor colleagues in the House would not debate the budget item. Labor maverick Samuel Lawn (the member for Adelaide) did not honour the agreement, and tried to raise a public scandal. Playford responded by extending George's term. =Freemasonry= George was appointed Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of South Australia in 1956. Retirement and accidental death George and his family retired to England in 1959 after which he held no further government appointments.

She was an Academy Award and Tony Award winner as well as an Emmy Award nominee. Straight made her Broadway debut in The Possessed (1939). Her other Broadway roles included Viola in Twelfth Night (1941), Catherine Sloper in The Heiress (1947) and Lady Macduff in Macbeth (1948). For her role as Elizabeth Proctor in the production of The Crucible (1953), she won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play. For the satirical film Network (1976), she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Her performance is the shortest ever to win an Academy Award for acting, at five minutes and two seconds of screen time. She also received an Emmy Award nomination for the miniseries The Dain Curse (1978). Straight also appeared as Mother Christophe in The Nun's Story (1959) and Dr. Martha Lesh in Poltergeist (1982). Early life Beatrice Whitney Straight was born in Old Westbury, New York, the daughter of Dorothy Payne Whitney of the Whitney family, and Willard Dickerman Straight, an investment banker, diplomat, and career U.S. Army officer. Her maternal grandfather was political leader and financier William Collins Whitney. In 1918, when Straight was four years old, her father died in France of influenza during the great epidemic while serving with the United States Army during World War I. Following her mother's remarriage to British agronomist Leonard K. Elmhirst in 1925, the family moved to Devon, England. It was there that Straight was educated at Dartington Hall and began acting in amateur theater productions. In the 1930s, she attended the Cornish School in Seattle where many of her teachers at Dartington Hall were from and to which both she and her mother became major benefactors.Cornish, Nellie C. Miss Aunt Nellie: the Autobiography of Nellie C. Cornish. Seattle, University of Washington Press, 1964: pp 214-17. Career Straight returned to the United States and made her Broadway debut in the play The Possessed (1939). Most of her theater work was in the classics, including Twelfth Night (1941), Macbeth (1948) and The Crucible (1953), for which she won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play. From its inception, Straight was a member of the Actors Studio, attending the class conducted three times weekly by founding member Robert Lewis; her classmates included Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift, Jerome Robbins, Sidney Lumet, and about 20 others. Straight was active in the early days of television, appearing in anthology series such as Armstrong Circle Theatre, Hallmark Hall of Fame, Kraft Television Theatre, Studio One, Suspense, The United States Steel Hour, Playhouse 90 and Alfred Hitchcock Presents, and dramatic series like Dr. Kildare, Ben Casey, The Defenders, Route 66, Mission: Impossible and St. Elsewhere. Further television performances include the role of Hippolyta in the Wonder Woman series, and Marion Hillyard, the icy, controlling mother of Stephen Collins in The Promise. Straight worked infrequently in film and is perhaps remembered best for her role as a devastated wife confronting husband William Holden's infidelity in Network (1976). Despite having a brief appearance, Straight was highly praised for her performance, earning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Another widely seen film appearance was the role of the paranormal investigator Dr. Martha Lesh in the horror film Poltergeist (1982). Personal life On February 22, 1942, Straight married Louis Dolivet, Free French Leader, in Polk County, Iowa. At the time, Dolivet was a speaker at the National Farm Institute and Straight was in the middle of the midwest road show of Twelfth Night. Her mother Dorothy Elmhirst and stepfather Leonard K. Elmhirst attended the wedding with her brother Michael Straight and his wife Belinda Crompton. Dolivet was in the French Air Force until June 1940 and was the co-editor of The Free World, a magazine published by the International Free World Association, of which he was secretary general. At the time of the wedding, her elder brother, Whitney Straight, had been missing since August 1941, when his plane was shot down on the French coast. Straight obtained a divorce from Dolivet in Reno, Nevada on May 24, 1949. Together they had one child: * Willard Whitney Straight Dolivet (1945‚Äì1952) In 1948, while starring in the Broadway production of The Heiress, an adaptation of Henry James's Washington Square, she met Peter Cookson. They married in 1949 and remained married until Cookson's death in 1990. Peter had two children from his previous marriage, Peter W. Cookson Jr. and Jane Coopland (n√©e Cookson). Together, Straight and Cookson had two children: * Gary Cookson * Anthony \\"Tony\\" Cookson In 1952, her 7-year-old son, Willard, from her first marriage, accidentally drowned in a pond on their farm in Armonk while playing in a small row boat tied to the dock. The boy was found by Cookson. The boy's father, Dolivet, who was living in Paris at the time, was refused a visa and, therefore, unable to fly to the United States to attend the funeral because of his alleged pro-communist activities, which he denied. Straight reportedly suffered from Alzheimer's disease in her last years. In 2001, she died from pneumonia in Northridge, Los Angeles, at the age of 86. Her interment was at William Henry Lee Memorial Cemetery in New Marlborough, Massachusetts.

Development After the last order for an additional fifty Mark I vehicles in April 1916, it was not certain that any more tanks were to be produced. Everything would depend on the success of the new weapon. William Tritton, co-designer and co-producer of the Mark I, thought he already understood what would prove to be its main weakness. A direct hit by a shell would destroy the vehicle, a major drawback on a battlefield saturated with artillery fire. Tritton decided to design a tank that would be immune to medium artillery fire in April 1916. Tritton was unsure what this would entail. He did not know how thick the armour should be to ensure complete protection. The same month Lieutenant Kenneth Symes began to test 2 inch (51 mm) armour plate by firing at it with various captured German guns. In June, this programme was expanded by testing several types of plate at Shoeburyness, delivered by armour producer William Beardmore and Company. The Tank Supply Committee approved the production of a prototype on 19 June 1916, but the design was not to be finalised until late August 1916. Description Partial drawings have survived and show a vehicle long and about tall and three metres wide, not that much larger than the Mark I. However, the weight was estimated at roughly a hundred tons, much heavier than the 28 tons of the Mark I. The huge increase in weight came from the enormously thick armour for the time (three inches at the front, two inches on the sides). The hull roof consisted of a horizontal half-cylinder, apparently also with a uniform armour two inches thick. The front was a vertical half- cylinder, the transition between the two being a half-dome. Many sources claim that the main armament, a nose-mounted cannon, was a standard 57-millimetre 6-pounder gun. John Glanfield, in his history The Devil's Chariots, states that it was a 75-millimetre or 13-pounder gun. A 6-pounder main gun for such a heavy machine would have meant half the main armament of contemporary vehicles. The preliminary design, for which partial blueprints are in the Albert Stern archive at King's College London, featured two six-pounders in sponsons either side of a bulbous nose equipped with no fewer than five machine guns. Each side had two machine-gun positions on the flanks, with two more at the rear (the original Foster drawings make this quite clear; the reproduction of the drawings in David Fletcher's book British Tanks 1915-19 is cropped and makes the rear guns ambiguous in nature). Originally, the shell- proof tank was referred to simply as the Heavy Tank, then Foster's Battle Tank. Where the nickname 'Flying Elephant' came from no one knows for sure, though it was probably the result of the trunk-like nose gun, domed front, and enormous bulk combined with a traditional British lightheartedness. Another view of the model at The Tank Museum, UK. The tank was fitted with two pairs of caterpillar tracks. The outer tracks resembled those of the Mark I, but were flatter and 61 centimetres wide, while a pair of additional, narrower tracks were fitted to the underside approximately 6 inches higher than the main tracks. They were not intended to be used for normal driving but were to be engaged to give extra traction over rough ground and would have helped to prevent \\"bellying\\", i.e. the tank becoming stuck on higher ground between the two outer tracks. All four tracks could be simultaneously driven by two Daimler 105 horsepower (78 kilowatt) engines, positioned on the centre-line, with the inner tracks connected to the main units via dog clutches. Each engine had its own primary gearbox, both of which drove into one single differential. This differential powered two secondary gearboxes, one for each main track. This differs from the solution chosen for the later Whippet in which each engine drove its own track. Results It is certain that construction was started at some point, but did not result in a completed prototype. Albert Gerald Stern, the head of the Tank Supply Department, wrote that the War Office ordered the end of the project late in 1916, because it deemed mobility more important than protection. Historian David Fletcher speculated that the project ran into trouble because the vehicle was grossly underpowered; top speed was estimated at two miles per hour, and it seems unlikely that it could have worked itself free when stuck in mud. The fact that the Mark I series turned out to be a success removed one of Tritton's main motives for building the heavier tank. However, John Glanfield writes that Tritton, in an effort to lighten the machine and make it more practicable, halved the thickness of the armour, reducing the overall weight to a still hefty 50‚Äì60 tons. Its appearance would have remained unchanged. Furthermore, the role of the Flying Elephant was changed from a vague 'attack' role to that of a 'tank-buster' when it was feared that the Germans were developing their own armoured fighting vehicles. Apparently, Stern planned to build twenty of the machines, before the project was cancelled.

Omission may occur because the testator did not know of the omitted person at the time the will was written. A will may contain a clause that explicitly disinherits any heirs unknown at the time that the will is executed, or any heirs not named in the will. While such a clause will not necessarily prevent a claim against an estate by a pretermitted heir, it may make it more difficult to succeed in such an action.See, e.g., Pretermitted child One common category of pretermitted heir is the pretermitted child, born after the writing of the will. Claims may also potentially be brought by children born outside of the decedent's marital relationship. A person who claims to be a pretermitted child of a deceased parent may bring an action in probate court to contest the parent's will. Many jurisdictions have enacted statutes that permit a pretermitted child to demand an inheritance under the will. Some statutes allow a pretermitted child to claim their intestate share, while others limit the inheritance to an amount that is comparable to devises made in the will for the children who were alive when the will was written. Some jurisdictions provide the same rights for a child who was pretermitted because, although born before the will was executed, he was not known of at the time the will was made. This may be because the child was incorrectly believed to be dead, or was adopted by the testator after the will was drafted. Some jurisdictions prohibit a pretermitted child from claiming an inheritance if the will devised substantially all of the testator's estate to the surviving spouse, and the surviving spouse is the other parent of the pretermitted child. A child may also be denied the right to take under the will as a pretermitted heir if the child received an advancement against their inheritance - an inter vivos gift from the testator of an amount equivalent to what child might have otherwise received under the will. When a court finds that a child was pretermitted and is entitled to inheritance, in order to provide the child with an inheritance the court may proportionally reduce the gift under the will to the decedent's other children, or may reduce gifts under the will to non-family members. Pretermitted spouse Laws in most nations provide protection for a pretermitted spouse, a spouse whom the testator does not marry until after the execution of the will. Many jurisdictions provide that a pretermitted spouse will receive either her intestate share (what she would have received had the testator died with no will), or an elective share of the deceased spouse's estate (a set amount or formula provided by law for spouses who are fully or partially disinherited in the will). Like a pretermitted child, a pretermitted spouse may be explicitly disinherited in the will, or may be excluded from taking under the will if they received an advancement on their inheritance in anticipation of the marriage. A pretermitted spouse may also disclaim any interest in the testator's estate through an antenuptial or prenuptial agreement.

It was briefly screened theatrically in late 1987Derek Malcolm 'Movie Guardian' 5 November 1987 p. 24 and was broadcast on Channel 4 on 5 March 1988.'Saturday Television and Radio' London Guardian 5 March 1988 p. 38 It was released on VHS in the late 1980s, and became available on DVD when the entire Comic Strip Presents... series was released as a box set in the UK in June 2005. It has also been repeated occasionally on the Paramount Comedy Channel. Plot Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson are the (unnamed) proprietors of an escort agency, Dreamytime Escorts. Mayall's character is devious, low-minded, calculating and stupid; Edmondson's merely very stupid. Unusually, rather than providing businessmen with female companionship, the activities of their escort agency essentially involve the pair swooping on unsuspecting foreigners who call them, and forcing them to take part in a drinking binge at their expense. The two are alcohol-obsessed; when their home-brewed beer (which takes a mere two days to brew and has a head made from washing-up liquid) isn't available, they steal from the delivery lorries pulling up at the off-licence downstairs: Edmondson's character dives out of the window into a large builders' bucket and is hauled back up by Mayall. Their next-door neighbour is Mr. Jolly, a psychopathic contract killer played by Peter Cook. Jolly's modus operandi is to hack his victims to death with a meat cleaver while playing classic Tom Jones tunes from the 1960s to drown their cries. Heimi Henderson, who owns the off-licence downstairs, has refused demands for protection money by Mr. Lovebucket, an effete gangster played by Peter Richardson whose abiding love is his Citro√´n DS car. Mayall and Edmondson intercept a request intended for Mr. Jolly to \\"take out\\" the radio presenter and game show host Nicholas Parsons, who appears as himself. Parsons is due to open Henderson's off- licence, and Lovebucket wants to put a stop to it. Misinterpreting the request, they spend an evening with Parsons, who stays in their company because he believes them to be competition winners, the real ones having been pushed off the road by the Dreamytime Escorts' van in an earlier scene. The two are confronted the following morning by Lovebucket, who wants to know what they've done with the money provided with the contract (which they have used to buy 1574 large gin and tonics). Lovebucket insists that they complete the contract. The two return to Parsons's house armed with a gun, chainsaw and grenades but fail to kill him as he leaves by helicopter to the off-licence to open it. They chase after the helicopter with Lovebucket and his gang pursuing them but crash their van into a skip. Parsons reaches the off-licence but can't find Henderson so he goes upstairs and meets Mr. Jolly and is presumably killed by him. Mayall and Edmondson got into their office and start packing their suitcases to go and live in Rio but see into Jolly's office and watch him talking to Lovebucket. Some of the gang members go into their office only to find it empty as the two have escaped through the window into the off- licence where they are told by Henderson that Parsons is opening it, much to their excitement. Shortly after Henderson overhears the two talking about killing Parsons, causing Mayall to shoot him dead, but tricks Edmondson into thinking he did it.

Mechanics In many RPG systems, non-trivial actions often require dice rolls. Some RPGs roll a fixed number of dice, add a number to the die roll based on the character's attributes and skills, and compare the resulting number with a difficulty rating. However, in other systems the character's attributes and skills determine the number of dice to be rolled. Dice pool systems generally use a single size of die, the most common being six- or ten- sided dice (d6s or d10s), though in some games a character's Attributes or Skills may determine the size of the dice in the pool, as well as their number (Deadlands is an example). While such games may require different sized dice for different rolls, the dice in a given pool are usually all of the same size. The results on each die may be added together and compared to a target number (as in Over the Edge), or the player may count the number of dice which roll higher than a specified target number, and compare that to a required number of \\"successes\\" (as in early editions of Shadowrun or the Storyteller System). In systems using the latter method, the target number required for a success may be fixed (the same for every roll) or variable (assigned depending on the difficulty of a task); the number of successes required may indicate the degree of success, or a minimum number of successes may be required as another means of determining difficulty. Another variation is that a number of dice are rolled, but only some are added together (as in the \\"Roll and Keep\\" system used by Legend of the Five Rings and 7th Sea). =Modifying the dice pool= In dice pool systems it is common to add or subtract dice from the pool to represent different circumstances. Penalties may temporarily reduce the dice pool for one or more skills (for example, a leg wound may reduce the dice pool for actions such as running, climbing, and jumping), and are usually fixed numbers (i.e. the leg wound may reduce a pool by two dice). Bonuses may temporarily increase dice pools, and usually represent beneficial circumstances (e.g. a character may have a powerful computer to aid her in a database search) or some special effort on the character's part (an effort of will, a strong desire to succeed, or even a supernatural power). Circumstantial bonuses are also usually fixed numbers - the computer above might grant two additional dice, for example - while character traits which grant bonuses are usually an expendable resource, representing special effort. This may take the form of \\"points\\" (e.g. \\"Willpower points\\" in the Storytelling System), or an extra pool of dice which may be allocated to other pools to augment rolls (e.g. the Combat and Karma pools of earlier edition Shadowrun). Other complications may be used to simulate luck, superhuman ability or other conditions; a common one is to allow high (or low) rolling dice to be rolled again, the second roll counting as if it were an additional die. Advantages and Problems Dice pools are more complex to explain and less intuitive than traditional \\"roll over\\" or \\"roll under\\" systems. On the other hand, they are faster to resolve if there are a lot of modifiers as it's easier to count each individual die that succeeded than it is to add four or five separate modifiers to a die roll. Therefore, whether dice pools are faster depends on how much detail the system goes into. They also provide players with a physical representation for the modifiers, as real, concrete dice are added to the pool (or taken away from it). Some people also find rolling a large handful of dice fun in its own right. The other thing dice pools allow is opening up a lot of design space for game designers; if something other than the number on the dice is important, the number itself can be used to add richness to the system. * Exploding Dice as used in the Storyteller System or Diana: Warrior Princess involve counting each maximum result on a die as a success - and rolling it again to see what the extra die does. This can create some impressive outcomes where luck favours the character. * Counting Sets as used in One-Roll Engine games like Monsters and Other Childish Things gives a method of separating whether a character succeeded from how successful they are, and introduces a risk element. * Drama Dice as used in Seventh Sea and Fortune Dice as used in Star Wars: Edge of the Empire allow for abstract one shot rewards where the actual effect is unknown. * Keep the two highest as used in Marvel Heroic Roleplaying and other Cortex Plus games is a hybrid with roll-over, which uses the dice pool's ability to add modifiers without adding much maths while having the simplicity of traditional roll-over. * Some results are botches again as used in Marvel Heroic Roleplaying and other Cortex Plus games as well as Star Wars: Edge of the Empire allow a combination of a very successful attempt at what a character is trying to and a lot of collateral damage. This also can serve to limit the desired size of the dice pool as more dice produce diminishing returns in terms of success while providing more probability of botches. ** Early versions of the Storyteller System used a version of this by which if a player rolled a 1, his character suffered a critical failure rather than just had negative consequences. This made rolling botches (critical failures) more likely the higher the skill or attribute as these added more dice. This problem was eliminated in the Revised version of the system and later derivatives by stating that a botch only occurred if no normal successes were scored and at least one die is a 1. History West End Games's Ghostbusters role-playing game by Greg Stafford, Lynn Willis, and Sandy Petersen featured a d6 system with an additive dice pool that was applied to characteristics and skills. The first widely successful game to feature dice pools was Greg Costikyan's 'Star Wars role-playing game (1987), developing the system pioneered the year before in Ghostbusters. (Both games were published by West End Games; Costikyan consulted on Ghostbusters.) Shadowrun (1989), designed by Bob Charrette, Paul Hume, and Tom Dowd, used a comparative dice pool, where a set of six-sided dice were rolled and each individual die was compared to a target number, with the number of successes then showing the final outcome of the task. Shadowrun was probably the first game to use the \\"success\\" mechanic rather than adding the dice together. Dowd refined the dice pool system for White Wolf Publishing's Vampire: The Masquerade (1991). Vampire and Over the Edge (1992) were written by Ars Magica designers Mark Rein-Hagen and Jonathan Tweet respectively, the pair having been impressed by the potential of the dice pool mechanic and each having decided to make their own game based on dice pools. The majority of White Wolf Publishing's subsequent games use variations on Vampire's Storyteller System, and so also make use of the dice pool mechanic.

They have released three albums, one EP and a compilation of earlier released material under the name American Nightmare. History =Formation (1998‚Äì2004)= American Nightmare was formed when Tim Cossar and Wesley Eisold (who was then a roadie for Ten Yard Fight) met up with Azy Relph and Jesse Van Diest in 1998. They recorded a demo tape in 1999, followed by their debut release, a self-titled EP on Bridge 9 Records in 2000. After extensive touring and line-up changes, the band recorded their second EP, The Sun Isn't Getting Any Brighter. This was later combined with their self-titled effort to form Year One, which was released by Reflections Records in 2001 and reissued posthumously by Bridge 9. Their debut full-length, Background Music, was recorded for Equal Vision Records in 2001 and was released to much acclaim. In 2003, the band faced a legal battle with a similarly named band from Philadelphia. The band then changed their name briefly to the initials \\"A.N.\\" then to American Nothing for a brief period. After the other American Nightmare threatened to file suit again, they changed their name to Give Up the Ghost (which was intended to be the name of their second album). Their second full length, We're Down Til We're Underground released on Equal Vision, displayed the band experimenting with their sound, with longer songs that didn't follow the typical hardcore songwriting formula they had adhered to in their previous releases. =Breakup and aftermath (2004‚Äì2010)= The band broke up suddenly in June 2004, a day after announcing the cancellation of a European tour. The band issued a statement which cited \\"health and personal reasons\\" for the split. Members went on to join/form other bands such as Cold Cave, Some Girls, XO Skeletons, Ye Olde Maids, Head Automatica, Bars, and the Hope Conspiracy. Give Up the Ghost came back into the headlines in 2007 under accusations that Fall Out Boy had taken lyrics from Wes Eisold, the band's lyricist, resulting in an out-of-court settlement and a credit in the liner notes of both the multi-platinum selling From Under the Cork Tree and Infinity on High. =Reunion shows (2011‚Äìpresent)= After seven years of disbandment, the band reunited under their original name and performed two reunion shows in December 2011. The band performed in Revere, Massachusetts on December 29, and in Los Angeles on December 31. Deathwish Inc. reissued the albums Background Music (2001) and We're Down Til We're Underground (2003) to coincide with the reunion dates. Since the original 2011 reunion shows, American Nightmare have played a small handful of shows almost every year. In November 2017 they announced a new album for release on 16 February 2018 through Rise Records. The first track from the self-titled album, \\"The World Is Blue\\", was released 19 December 2017. Musical style and legacy American Nightmare have been categorised as hardcore punk, melodic hardcore and emo. Their music was a reaction against the lyrical positivity of Youth Crew revival bands that had been popular in Boston at the time like In My Eyes, Floorpunch and Bane. The band perused a more dark and nihilistic sound in comparison through the influence of The Smiths and Joy Division. Other influences include Black Flag, the Cro-Mags and Siouxsie and the Banshees. Their music often makes use of high-tempos, breakdowns, gang vocals and singalongs. They have been cited as an influence by The White Noise, Frameworks, Killing The Dream, Defeater, Touch√© Amor√© and Dead Swans.

Winogradsky discovered the first known form of lithotrophy during his research with Beggiatoa in 1887. He reported that Beggiatoa oxidized hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as an energy source and formed intracellular sulfur droplets. This research provided the first example of lithotrophy, but not autotrophy. His research on nitrifying bacteria would report the first known form of chemoautotrophy, showing how a lithotroph fixes carbon dioxide (CO2) to make organic compounds. Biography Winogradsky was born in Kiev (then in the Russian Empire). In this early stage of his life, Winogradsky was \\"strictly devoted to the orthodox faith\\", though he later became irreligious.Waksman, Selman Abraham. 1953. Sergei N. Winogradsky: His Life and Work: The Story of a Great Bacteriologist. Rutgers University Press. p. 4 He entered the Imperial Conservatoire of Music in St Petersburg in 1875 to study piano. However, after two years of music training, he entered the University of Saint Petersburg in 1877 to study chemistry under Nikolai Menshutkin and botany under Andrei Sergeevich Famintzin. He received a diploma in 1881 and stayed at the St. Petersburg University for a degree of master of science in botany in 1884. In 1885, he began work at the University of Strasbourg under the renowned botanist Anton de Bary; Winogradsky became renowned for his work on sulfur bacteria. In 1888, he relocated to Zurich, where he began investigation into the process of nitrification, identifying the genera Nitrosomonas and Nitrosococcus, which oxidizes ammonium to nitrite, and Nitrobacter, which oxidizes nitrite to nitrate. He returned to St. Petersburg for the period 1891‚Äì1905, and headed the division of general microbiology of the Institute of Experimental Medicine. During this period, he identified the obligate anaerobe Clostridium pasteurianum, which is capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen. In St. Petersburg, he trained his only student und assistant Vasily Omelianski which popularized Winogradskys concepts and methodology in the Soviet Union during the next decades. In 1901, he was elected honorary member of the Moscow Society of Naturalists and, in 1902, corresponding member of the French Academy of Sciences. He retired from active scientific work in 1905, dividing his time between his private estate and Switzerland. In 1922, he accepted an invitation to head the division of agricultural bacteriology at the Pasteur Institute at an experimental station at Brie-Comte-Robert, France, about 30 km from Paris. During this period, he worked on a number of topics, among them iron bacteria, nitrifying bacteria, nitrogen fixation by Azotobacter, cellulose-decomposing bacteria, and culture methods for soil microorganisms. Winogradsky retired from active life in 1940 and died in Brie-Comte-Robert in 1953. Discoveries Winogradsky discovered various biogeochemical cycles and parts of these cycles. These discoveries include * His work on bacterial sulfide oxidation for which he first became renowned, including the first known form of lithotrophy (in Beggiatoa). * His work on the Nitrogen cycle including ** The identification of the obligate anaerobe Clostridium pasteurianum is a free living microbe capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen and not living in legume root nodules. ** Chemosynthesis ‚Äì his most noted discovery ** The Winogradsky column Nitrogen cycle =Chemosynthesis= Winogradsky is best known for discovering chemoautotrophy, which soon became popularly known as chemosynthesis, the process by which organisms derive energy from a number of different inorganic compounds and obtain carbon in the form of carbon dioxide. Previously, it was believed that autotrophs obtained their energy solely from light, not from reactions of inorganic compounds. With the discovery of organisms that oxidized inorganic compounds such as hydrogen sulfide and ammonium as energy sources, autotrophs could be divided into two groups: photoautotrophs and chemoautotrophs. Winogradsky was one of the first researchers to attempt to understand microorganisms outside of the medical context, making him among the first students of microbial ecology and environmental microbiology. The Winogradsky column remains an important display of chemoautotrophy and microbial ecology, demonstrated in microbiology lectures around the world.

It was ported to the Apple II and IBM PC compatibles. Summary In the game the player is put in control of NASA and tasked with building and maintaining a space station and generating enough money with commercial contracts to make up for an anemic yearly budget. This can be seen as a discrete set of phases, except that they all proceed simultaneously. The exception is at the beginning of the game where the player has unlimited time in the planning phase before the game clock starts. In the planning phase, the player first allocates the funds they have to various budget items, like crew selection, station modules, and research and development. Then they choose their crew, who have intrinsic task sets (like piloting and physics), and varying levels of competence and compatibility with other potential employees. From there the player purchases equipment like space suits and satellites, and station modules like laboratories and solar arrays. Then they schedule their launches using the two space shuttles available (Atlantis and Discovery, though the initial release used the Space Shuttle Challenger), and have their budget approved. In the final stage of the planning phase the player can create a simulated station with an unlimited number of parts, and without dealing with the later constrictions of the EVA. The launch phase has the player decide whether launch conditions are stable enough to merit launch. If they give the implicit go-ahead, they engage in a light arcade sequence where the player attempts to keep the shuttle on course throughout its orbital burn. The more successful the player is, the closer the shuttle will be to the station. Once the shuttle is in orbit, the player is tasked to assemble the components they brought up (or to fire off any satellites they have contracts for) in the Extra-Vehicular Activity, or EVA phase. Here the player directly controls an Orbital Construction Pod, a small ship with mechanical arms that an astronaut can use to move large equipment. Being careless here could have consequences as the pod or equipment may become damaged, and it may run out of fuel and become stranded until another pod can rescue it. Consequences were not limited to equipment damage: Stranded astronauts in pods could die when oxygen ran out. Other crew hazards included solar flares, which could kill astronauts on the station or shuttle if precautions (using an emergency module in station design) were not taken. Crew died in reverse alphabetical order from solar flares. The player then transfers crew to and from the space station and assigns them to research tasks. Completing these tasks awards the player with government contracts that supplement NASA's budget. A math bug (or intentional cheat) in the game allowed an infinite supply of money, if the player allocated more than $10,000K to any budget. For example, if $800k is spent, the budget would be recalculated to $19,200K instead of $9,200, as expected. Finally the player lands the shuttle. After determining that landing conditions are adequate, the player again keeps the shuttle on course as it turns from the station and enters its descent. Skill here determines how close the shuttle will be to the optimal point from the runway. After this the player controls the shuttle with a simple landing simulator viewed from the side. The more abrupt or overshot the landing, the more damage will be done to the shuttle and the longer it will need to be repaired before it can venture out on another mission. The game is played using a menu system. Every option can be queried for in-game help, and every major task has a tutorial that simulates that task without the consequences of failure, and sometimes with additional assistance (like being able to pause a landing attempt). Another major feature is the message system that alerts the player when there are changes to mission status, wherever the player might be within the menu system.

Some Christians hold the belief that the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and the inauguration of the New Covenant of Jeremiah 31:31-37 and Ezekiel 37:22-38 \\"replaces\\" or \\"completes\\" or \\"fulfills\\" the Law of Moses found in the Hebrew Bible. Dual-covenant theologians, Calvinists, the Hebrew Roots Movement, and Messianic Judaism are all examples of a groups that reject this belief. Closely related are the subjects of Christian views on the Old Covenant, early Christianity and Judaism, Paul the Apostle and Judaism, abrogation of old covenant laws, and Christian ethics.  In the Pauline epistles  Depicted is the famous Sermon on the Mount of Jesus in which he commented on the Mosaic Law. Christians believe that Jesus is the mediator of the New Covenant.Such as etc. See also Catholic Encyclopedia: Epistle to the Hebrews: \\"The central thought of the entire Epistle is the doctrine of the Person of Christ and His Divine mediatorial office. ... There He now exercises forever His priestly office of mediator as our Advocate with the Father (vii, 24 sq.).\\" In the Epistle to the Galatians, written by the Apostle Paul to a number of early Christian communities in the Roman province of Galatia in central Anatolia, he wrote: \\"Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.\\" (, NKJV). This phrase appears once and is never defined. It has been suggested that \\"the law of Christ\\" could be an allusion to the second greatest commandment (\\"love thy neighbor\\") or the New Commandment (\\"love one another; as I have loved you\\"). Others suggest this phrase is just another name for \\"the law of God\\" as Christians believe the Messiah is God. Possibly related, in a letter to the early Christians of Corinth, Greece, in the First Epistle to the Corinthians, Paul wrote: \\"To those not having the law I became like one not having the law (though I am not free from God's law but am under Christ's law), so as to win those not having the law.\\" (, NIV). In the Greek, the wording is, \\"to those without law, as without law -- (not being without law to God, but within law to Christ) -- that I might gain those without law.\\" (1 Corinthians 9:21, YLT) It is not clear exactly what Paul means by the phrase, \\"the law of Christ\\". Although Paul mentions Biblical law several times (e.g., , , , , , , ) and preached about Ten Commandment topics such as idolatry (e.g., , , , , , , , , ), he consistently denies that salvation, or justification before God, is based on \\"works of the law\\" (e.g., ), though the meaning of this phrase is also disputed by scholars, see for example the New Perspective on Paul#Works of the Law.  In the gospels  Many Christians believe that the Sermon on the Mount is a form of commentary on the Ten Commandments. It portrays Christ as the true interpreter of the Mosaic Law.\\"Sermon on the Mount.\\" Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005 In the Expounding of the Law, Jesus said that he did not come to abolish the law or the prophets, but to fulfill them (). Jesus explicitly warns of severe concequence to those who break and teach others to break one of the least of the commands of God (Matthew 5:19 KJV) In the apocryphal Gospel of Marcion's version of Luke 23:2 we find the extension: \\"We found this fellow perverting the nation and destroying the law and the prophets\\".Ante-Nicene Fathers: Tertullian: Against Marcion: Dr. Holmes' Note: \\"In [Luke 23:2], after the words \\"perverting the nation,\\" Marcion added, \\"and destroying the law and the prophets; Gospel of Marcion: Jesus Before Pilate and Herod While the New Testament records several unique sayings of Jesus that may be described as \\"commandments,\\" it only records one that he explicitly identified as such. This is the New Commandment of that the disciples should love one another as he himself had loved them. These commandments are commonly seen as a basis of Christian ethics.  In the Epistle of James  uses the phrases of \\"royal law\\" and \\"law of liberty\\" in reference to the Second greatest commandment, part of : Theological interpretations In his Summa Theologiae I-II qq. 106-109, a section of the Summa known as the Treatise on Law, Saint Thomas Aquinas discusses the Law of Christ as the \\"New Law\\". He argues that it was virtually contained in the Old Law, that is the Old Testament, as a seed but only brought to perfection by Jesus Christ who perfectly fulfilled it. The ends of the Old and New are one and the same, being subjection to God's order, but they are different in that the New Law makes attaining the end possible. Meanwhile, since all law ultimately has reference to Divine Reason governing all things, the New Law contains and helps the human being fulfill the Natural Law which prescribes acts of virtue. Thus, Aquinas defines the New Law as \\"chiefly the grace itself of the Holy Ghost, which is given to those who believe in Christ, \\" but adds that it also \\"contains certain things that dispose us to receive the grace of the Holy Ghost, and pertaining to the use of that grace.\\" Therefore,\\"the New Law is in the first place a law that is inscribed on our hearts, but that secondarily it is a written law\\".(ST I-II q. 106.3)http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2106.htm#article4 The Catholic theologian Bernhard H√§ring presents the Law of Christ as Christ himself in his person because Jesus was able to fulfill the law and provide us with the effect of this fulfillment.BERNARD H√ÑRING, The Law of Christ, I, translated by Edwin G. Kaiser, Cork 1963, introduction. The Evangelical theologian Douglas J. Moo argues that \\"the law of Christ\\" is strongly connected to the Mosaic Law, for example that nine of the Ten Commandments are included.Five views on Law and Gospel, Gundry ed., an online copy at DJMOO.COM , Page 368: \\"Love is central to this law, and there is strong continuity with the law of Moses, for many specifically Mosaic commandments are taken up and included within this \\"law of Christ\\".\\" Page 370: \\"Indeed, we can confidently expect that everything within the Mosaic law that reflected God's \\"eternal moral will\\" for his people is caught up into and repeated in the \\"law of Christ.\\" Having recognized the place within \\"the law of Christ\\" of specific commandments, however, I want to insist that they must not be given too much prominence.\\" Page 376: \\"The content of all but one of the Ten Commandments is taken up into \\"the law of Christ\\", for which we are responsible. (The exception is the Sabbath commandment, one that Heb. 3-4 suggests is fulfilled in the new age as a whole.)\\" George R.

It was the first film that was produced by the CBS Television Network's film unit, Cinema Center Films, and Day's final film performance. Plot Abby McClure (Doris Day) is a widow with three sons who runs the lumberyard that her husband owned. Her matchmaking sister Maxine (Pat Carroll) tricks her into calling widower Jake Iverson (Brian Keith) and inviting him to the business dinner party Abby is having that night. Not interested in the trouble his sexy, adultery-minded neighbor Cleo (Elaine Devry) is trying to get him into, Jake arrives at Abby's and is bored by all of the matchmaking dialogue. Jake makes up an excuse to leave, but later runs into Abby at an all-night supermarket. Embarrassed by being caught in a fib, Jake meets Abby at a local drive-in run by the wise-cracking Herbie (George Carlin) and the two stay out until 2 a.m. A romance develops, much to the chagrin of Jake's teenage daughter Stacey (Barbara Hershey) and Abby's three sons, Flip, Mitch and Jason (John Findlater, Jimmy Bracken, and Richard Steele). The children make certain that neither Jake nor Abby can be comfortable at the other's home, so the pair wind up more than once at the drive-in, before finally falling in love. Fed up with the situation, they elope, not telling their children that they have married until the next day when the children discover them in bed together. From then on, Abby's sons fight with Iverson's possessive daughter Stacey; while Flip and Stacey both are hostile to the idea of a step-parent; and even Abby's sheepdog and Jake's poodle are incompatible. Neither's house is large enough for the family of six --not including Abby's live-in maid, Molly (Alice Ghostley), so they borrow a camper and use it as a bedroom while they move into Abby's house and eventually put Jake's up for sale. The morning after a bedtime argument, Abby drives off in the camper in a rage; Jake is dumped out clad only in boxers and clutching a teddy bear. After running through the neighborhood, he gets Herbie to lend him some clothes and drive him back to his house. Once Abby discovers what has happened, she returns only to find Jake gone. She is joined by a band of hippies she meets when she reaches the drive-in. When the camper collides with a livestock truck carrying chickens, Abby and the hippies are arrested. Hearing of the accident, Jake and the children rush to her rescue, colliding with the same chicken truck. The angry driver assaults Jake and the children (and pets) unite in his defense. At the station-house the parents and children are joyfully reconciled, and the family finally buys a huge two-story house big enough for a family of six, a maid, and two dogs. The title of the movie comes from a scene where the family goes out for Chinese food, and one of the kids notices that because they are a large group, they get something extra: \\"With six you get eggroll!\\" Cast =McClure family= * Doris Day as Abby McClure * John Findlater as Flip McClure * Richard Steele as Jason McClure * Jimmy Bracken as Mitch McClure * Pat Carroll as Maxine Scott, Abby's sister * Herb Voland as Harry Scott, Abby's brother-in-law =Iverson family= * Brian Keith as Jake Iverson * Barbara Hershey as Stacey Iverson =Others= * George Carlin as Herbie Fleck * Alice Ghostley as Abby's maid, Molly * Jamie Farr as Jo Jo * William Christopher as Zip-Cloud * Elaine Devry as Cleo Ruskin, Jake's next-door neighbor * Milton Frome as Bud Young * Jackie Joseph as Georgia Watson * Victor Tayback as truck driver * Allan Melvin as Police Desk Sergeant * The Grass Roots as themselves Production notes It was the first film made by the newly formed Cinema Center Films, a subdivision of CBS network. =Supporting cast= The cast includes several actors in small parts (some uncredited) who are much better known for other performances, such as Jamie Farr, William Christopher, Ken Osmond, Allan Melvin, Jackie Joseph, Milton Frome, Vic Tayback, George Carlin, Peter Leeds, Howard Morris, Maudie Prickett and Creed Bratton (part of the singing group The Grass Roots). Many of them (as well as Day herself, in The Doris Day Show) later turned up in TV sitcoms: Farr and Christopher in M*A*S*H, Tayback and Melvin in Alice, Carlin in The George Carlin Show and Bratton in The Office. (Keith was starring in Family Affair at the time, while Osmond had played the iconic Eddie Haskell in Leave It to Beaver.) =Blended family premise= The film was released only four months after United Artists' Yours, Mine and Ours. While both films have the same premise‚Äîthat of a widow and a widower marrying each other and creating a blended family‚Äîthe United Artists film was based on a true story and was a huge commercial success (if not critical) becoming the 11th highest- grossing film of the year. Although there are similarities between this film, Yours, Mine and Ours and the later ABC television show The Brady Bunch that premiered in 1969, the original pilot script for The Brady Bunch predated the scripts for both of these films. Film locations Most of the film's exterior locations were within a five-mile radius of each other: =Studio City/Valley Village= Ye Olde Drive Inn The location used for Herbie Fleck's \\"Ye Olde Drive Inn\\" was a drive-in on Ventura Place, near CBS Studio Center around the intersection of Ventura Boulevard and Laurel Canyon Boulevard. The site is now a sporting goods store. School scenes School scenes were filmed at Ulysses S. Grant High School in Valley Village (at the time Van Nuys), California. =Toluca Lake= Both of the houses seen in the film are within a block of each other in the suburb of Toluca Lake, which straddles the borders of Los Angeles and Burbank in the San Fernando Valley. The neighborhood that Abby drives the camper truck through is the northern part of Toluca Lake, specifically Kling Street between Arcola Avenue and Cahuenga Avenue. McClure house The exterior shots for Abby McClure's late-1930s Tudor Revival home were filmed at 4248 Clybourn Avenue; the same house number is also used in the film. The interiors are soundstage sets that bear no resemblance to the house's actual interior. A studio replica of the street-facing fa√ßade was also used for some night shots‚Äîdiscernible by the differences in the tree in the front yard‚Äîspecifically for the scene with rain. A still photograph of the house across the street (4245 Clybourn Avenue) can be seen earlier in the same sequence where Jake arrives on the porch of the McClure house. The homes to the right have all had major remodelings, as well as the McClure house, which is almost unrecognizable as the same house today. However, the fire hydrant at the sidewalk, the covered driveway and the front yard tree all remain as of October 2013. Iverson house The exterior shots for Jake Iverson's 1929 Mission Revival home were shot at 10011 Tikita Place. All of the exterior night shots were filmed at this location. The interiors‚Äîas well as the backyard‚Äîare also soundstage sets that bear no resemblance to the house's actual interior and backyard. The house to the left of the Iverson house has undergone major remodeling, whereas the Iverson house still looked very similar to its appearance in this film until about 2014. As of September 2015, the Iverson house was completely demolished and replaced with a faux-traditional home. Iverson-McClure house The film's final punchline‚Äîa large two-story early-1950s Colonial house shown briefly at the end with a \\"Sold\\" sign on it and a front pathway flanked by the McClures' sheepdog and the Iversons' poodle‚Äîis also in Toluca Lake, at 10463 Kling Street. Police chase scene The late 1930s two-story Colonial house with the circle driveway that the police chase drives through is at 10501 Kling Street (to the immediate left of the above-mentioned Iverson-McClure house at 10463 Kling). Music The film's score was composed and conducted by CBS Television and Columbia Records staff arranger/composer Robert Mersey. While Day provided a vocal performance either onscreen, in voice-over or over the credits in all of her movies since 1958's The Tunnel of Love, this is one of only three films not to feature a vocal by Day (the others being 1967's The Ballad of Josie and 1968's Where Were You When the Lights Went Out?). A male chorus is heard singing an easy-listening piece called \\"You Make Me Think About You\\" in one sequence, but no vocals are heard by Day. A 45RPM single featuring a vocal by Johnny Mathis and arranged and conducted by Robert Mersey was released by Columbia Records. The single peaked at 35 on Billboards Easy Listening Chart. Release =Box office= After its release, the film went on to gross $10,095,200 at the box office according to Variety and the box office website The Numbers, making it one of the top ten moneymaking films of Day's 39-film career. Variety said it earned $4.5 million in theatrical rentals in the US and Canada.\\"All-time Film Rental Champs\\", Variety, 7 January 1976 p. 48 =Critical= Upon its theatrical release, Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote: \\"The latest chapter in the continuing adventures of the Widow Day‚Ä¶ was produced by Cinema Center Films, a subsidiary of the Columbia Broadcasting System‚Ä¶ I kept wondering how the characters played by Miss Day lose their husbands. Cancer? Suicide? Auto accident? There's never any hint. There are, however, some hints of the very real comic talent that has, over the years, become hermetically sealed inside a lacquered personality.\\"\\"Movie Review: With Six You Get Eggroll by Vincent Canby, The New York Times, October 10, 1968.

It can be used in combination with other medications to treat breast cancer in patients who have had surgery to remove the tumor. It is marketed by Pfizer under the trade name Ellence in the US and Pharmorubicin or Epirubicin Ebewe elsewhere. Similarly to other anthracyclines, epirubicin acts by intercalating DNA strands. Intercalation results in complex formation which inhibits DNA and RNA synthesis. It also triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in mechanisms that lead to cell death. Binding to cell membranes and plasma proteins may be involved in the compound's cytotoxic effects. Epirubicin also generates free radicals that cause cell and DNA damage. Epirubicin is favoured over doxorubicin, the most popular anthracycline, in some chemotherapy regimens as it appears to cause fewer side-effects. Epirubicin has a different spatial orientation of the hydroxyl group at the 4' carbon of the sugar - it has the opposite chirality - which may account for its faster elimination and reduced toxicity. Epirubicin is primarily used against breast and ovarian cancer, gastric cancer, lung cancer and lymphomas. Development history The first trial of epirubicin in humans was published in 1980. Upjohn applied for approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in node-positive breast cancer in 1984, but was turned down because of lack of data. In 1999 Pharmacia (who had by then merged with Upjohn) received FDA approval for the use of epirubicin as a component of adjuvant therapy in node-positive patients.

He is best remembered as the founder and long-time director of the Wiener Library. Biography Wiener trained as an Arabist and spent the years 1909 ‚Äì 1911 in the Middle East. He fought in the First World War, winning the Iron Cross 2nd Class. From 1919, he was a high-ranking official in the Centralverein deutscher Staatsb√ºrger j√ºdischen Glaubens (Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith, CV), and identified the Nazi Party as the chief danger to the Jews of Germany and to German society as a whole as early as 1925. Wiener's first wife, Margarethe, died shortly after being released from Bergen-Belsen concentration camp on the way to Switzerland in 1945. In 1953, he married Lotte Philips. Wiener became a naturalized British citizen in the late 1940s. Anti-Nazi activities In 1928, Wiener was instrumental in creating the B√ºro Wilhelmstrasse of the CV, which documented Nazi activities and issued anti-Nazi materials until 1933 when Hitler came to power. Wiener and his family fled to Amsterdam where he, together with Dr. David Cohen of Amsterdam University, founded the Jewish Central Information Office (JCIO). In 1939 he and the collection transferred to London. Wiener spent most of the war years in the USA, collecting materials for the JCIO and working for the British and American governments. He returned in 1945 to transform the Information Office into a library and centre for the scholarly study of the Nazi era. From the mid-1950s, Wiener travelled frequently to Germany to speak to groups of young people and establish contact with Christian groups.

It is a class of Sprengel explosives. Properties Oxyliquits have numerous advantages. They are inexpensive to make, can be initiated by a safety fuse, and in case of a misfire, the oxygen evaporates quickly, rendering the charge quite safe in a short period of time. The first large scale deployment took place in 1899 during the building of the Simplon Tunnel, in the form of cartridges filled with diatomaceous earth soaked with petroleum, or an absorbent cork charcoal, dipped in liquid oxygen immediately before use. In another modification, the cartridge is filled with liquid oxygen after placement in the borehole. One of the disadvantages of oxyliquits is that, once mixed, they are sensitive to sparks, shock, and heat, in addition to reported cases of spontaneous ignition. The power relative to weight is high, but the density is low, so the brisance is low as well. Ignition by a fuse alone is sometimes unreliable. The charge should be detonated within 5 minutes of soaking, but even after 15 minutes it may be capable of exploding, even though weaker and with production of carbon dioxide. An oxyliquit explosion can be accidentally produced while filling high-altitude aircraft systems. When liquid oxygen is spilled on tarmac (asphalt) the pavement can become sufficiently explosive to be set-off simply by walking on it, even though the oxygen evaporates shortly after it is spilled. At first, liquid air, self- enriched by standing (nitrogen has a lower boiling point and evaporates preferentially) was used, but pure liquid oxygen gives better results. A mixture of lampblack and liquid oxygen was measured to have a detonation velocity of 3,000 m/s, and 4 to 12% more explosive power than dynamite. The long duration of the flame it produced, however, made it unsafe for use in the presence of explosive gases. Therefore, oxyliquits were mostly used in open quarries and strip mines. History The explosive properties of these mixtures were discovered in Germany in 1895 by Prof. Carl von Linde, a developer of a successful machine for liquefaction of gases, who named them oxyliquits. In 1930, over 3 million pounds of liquid oxygen were used for this purpose in Germany alone, and additional 201,466 lb (91,383 kg) were consumed by British quarries. The accident rate was lower than with conventional explosives. However, the Dewar flasks the LOX was stored in occasionally exploded, which was caused by iron impurities in the activated carbon serving as trace gas absorbent in the insulation vacuum layer in the flask, which caused spontaneous ignition in case of LOX leak into the enclosed space. Use of oxyliquits during World War II was low, as there was a plentiful supply of nitrates obtained from synthetic ammonia. Due to the complicated machinery required for manufacture of liquid oxygen, oxyliquit explosives were used mostly only where their consumption was high. In the United States, some such locations were the strip mines in coal mining areas of the Midwest. Its consumption peaked in 1953 with 10,190 tons, but then decreased to zero in 1968, when it was entirely replaced with the cheaper ANFO. Fiction Oxyliquit explosive was prepared ad hoc from sugar and liquid oxygen from an oxygen bottle to blast a hole in a collapsed cave in Stanis≈Çaw Lem's 1951 novel The Astronauts. The same device was used in Andy Weir's novel The Martian and the movie adaptation to cause the intentional depressurization of a spaceship by blasting the airlock door.

Fields joined the Labour Party in 1968. He was active in the Fire Brigades Union's national 1977‚Äì78 strike and shortly afterwards he joined the Militant group. At the Labour Party's special conference in 1980 on the question of how to elect the Labour leader, Fields spoke before Denis Healey and said: \\"We need coordinated action by the whole of our class to get the Tories out, and the democracy that is being pumped out in the capitalist press is their democracy, not ours.

Labour Party members criticised Fields for his militant approach to the poll tax and his failure to support other Labour candidates, in particular Peter Kilfoyle in a by-election for the neighbouring constituency of Liverpool Walton, following Eric Heffer's death. Fields was expelled from the Labour Party in December 1991 along with other members of Militant, including Dave Nellist, then the only other MP who was a member of the tendency. Later life At the 1992 general election, Fields stood as an independent, winning 14% of the vote, while the official Labour Party candidate, Jane Kennedy, was elected. After losing his seat, Fields ran The Mayflower, a pub on Fazakerley Street in Liverpool, for six months. He did not join the Socialist Party, into which Militant eventually developed. In 2002, at the age of 65, he returned briefly to the limelight after entering a burning house to rescue a woman trapped inside.

The song uses a twelve- bar blues arrangement and the lyrics follow the path of U.S. Route 66 (US 66), which traversed the western two-thirds of the U.S. from Chicago, Illinois, to Los Angeles, California. Nat King Cole, with the King Cole Trio, first recorded the song the same year, and it became a hit, appearing on Billboard magazine's R&B; and pop charts. Another version to reach the Billboard charts was that recorded by Bing Crosby with the Andrews Sisters on May 11, 1946, and this reached the No. 14 position in 1946. The song was subsequently recorded by many artists, including Chuck Berry, Glenn Frey, the Rolling Stones, Them, Dr. Feelgood, Asleep at the Wheel, the Manhattan Transfer, Depeche Mode, The Brian Setzer Orchestra, Pappo, The Cramps, John Mayer, George Benson and Peter Tork & Shoe Suede Blues. Composition and lyrics Bobby Troup got the idea for the song on a cross-country drive from Pennsylvania to California. Troup wanted to try his hand as a Hollywood songwriter, so he and his wife, Cynthia, packed up their 1941 Buick and headed west. The trip began on US 40 and continued along US 66 to the California coast. Troup initially considered writing a tune about US 40, but Cynthia suggested the title \\"Get Your Kicks on Route 66\\". The song was composed on the ten-day journey and completed by referring to maps when the couple arrived in Los Angeles. The lyrics read as a mini-travelogue about the major stops along the route, listing several cities and towns through which Route 66 passes: St. Louis; Joplin, Missouri; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Amarillo, Texas; Gallup, New Mexico; Flagstaff, Arizona; Winona, Arizona; Kingman, Arizona; Barstow, California; and San Bernardino, California. Winona is the only town out of sequence: it was a very small settlement east of Flagstaff and might indeed have been forgotten if not for the lyric \\"Don't forget Winona\\", written to rhyme with \\"Flagstaff, Arizona\\". Many artists who have covered the tune over the years have changed the initial lyrics, usually to \\"It goes to St. Louis, down through Missouri...\\" then continuing with Oklahoma City and so on. Of the eight states through which the actual route passes, only Kansas and its cities‚ÄîUS 66 spends just inside the state's southeast corner‚Äîare not mentioned by the song. Chuck Berry famously mispronounces Barstow to rhyme with \\"cow\\" instead of correctly pronouncing it to rhyme with \\"go\\". \\"Route 66\\" was first recorded in 1946 by Nat King Cole, whose rendition became a hit on both the U.S. R&B; and pop record charts. Cole later re-recorded the tune in 1956 (for the album After Midnight) and 1961 (The Nat King Cole Story). Other recorded versions Location of U.S. Route 66 The song has become a standard and has been recorded by numerous artists. The version recorded by Perry Como in 1959 (on the album Como Swings) is more lyrically complete, including the seldom-heard second verse and also the introductory verse. Chuck Berry's version, featured in his 1961 album New Juke Box Hits, was closest to its R&B; roots, with jazz overtones, often blended into his own songs. *Two of the leading British Invasion bands included \\"Route 66\\" on their debut albums, Them (Featuring Van Morrison) and the Rolling Stones. *Michael Martin Murphey covered the song on his 1989 album Land of Enchantment. His version was released as a single in 1990 and peaked at number 67 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart. Little Willie Littlefield recorded a boogie-woogie version for his 1997 album The Red One. *Essex-born English singer-songwriter Billy Bragg recorded an anglicised version of the song called \\"A13 (Trunk Road to the Sea)\\" for a John Peel session in 1985. In the song‚Äîstrummed and sung to the same tune as the original ‚Äî the landmark cities are replaced with English towns along the route of the A13, with Bragg inviting listeners to \\"Go motoring, on the A-thirteen\\". According to Bragg he wrote the lyrics whilst playing with his band Riff Raff in 1977: whilst the band played \\"Route 66\\" as part of their set, Bragg \\"objected to singing about these places that (he) didn't know... there's a tradition of driving down the A13 to the glory of Southend. Growing up in Barking, that was the promised land, in quite a Springsteenish way\\". The song was originally meant to be released on Bragg's 1983 debut album Life's a Riot with Spy vs Spy; however, it was ultimately not included due to problems getting permission to use the music of \\"Route 66\\". It was finally released commercially on the bonus disc of the 2003 compilation Must I Paint You a Picture? The Essential Billy Bragg. *The Depeche Mode cover made the #1 spot on the KROQ Top 106.7 Countdown of 1988.

He is depicted as a much feared, cruel and nefarious judge of Toontown who is revealed to be both an evil toon mastermind and the one responsible for the framing of the titular character and the killing of Eddie Valiant's brother within the film. Judge Doom is an original character from the script of the film created by screenwriters Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman. Many actors were considered for the role of the character such as Tim Curry and Christopher Lee. The reviews of Christopher Lloyd's role as Judge Doom were mostly positive. Judge Doom was ranked as one of the greatest film villains of all time by Wizard magazine. Also the character and his plot twist reveal as a toon is placed as one of the scariest childhood moments, being ranked along characters like Large Marge from Pee-wee's Big Adventure and the Child Catcher from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Judge Doom also appeared in video games, a graphic novel and a few merchandising items based on the film. Appearances Christopher Lloyd portrayed Judge Doom in Who Framed Roger Rabbit. When Who Framed Roger Rabbit first introduces Judge Doom, Lt. Santino confides to Eddie Valiant that Doom bought the election. Doom threatens himself as executioner to Roger Rabbit once he catches him with a new invention he created that combines a chemical vat of turpentine, acetone and benzene (paint thinners) he dubs \\"The Dip\\". Doom shows off his invention by killing an animated anthropomorphic shoe in front of Eddie. Roger realizes he's in trouble with Doom after him, and begs Eddie to hide him. Later, at the Terminal Bar, Doom uses the \\"Shave and a Haircut\\" trick to lure Roger out, then prepares to execute him. After a brief scuffle inside the bar, the Judge orders the weasels to capture Roger and Eddie Valiant. When Eddie learns that studio head R.K. Maroon is connected to the plot to frame Roger, Eddie interrogates him, but Maroon pleads that he is \\"a dead man\\" if he confesses. Just as Maroon is about to spill everything, he is killed by an unseen gunman who nearly shoots Eddie as well. Upon chasing the killer to Toontown, Eddie catches Jessica Rabbit, thinking she's the murderer, but Jessica reveals that Judge Doom was the one who killed Acme and Maroon. At the film's climax, Doom traps Eddie, Jessica, and Roger in the Acme Factory to explain his scheme to erase Toontown from the map using a giant, mobile vat of dip linked to a high-pressure water cannon, and then build a freeway over it. Doom then plans to retire from being a judge and control all the profits from the new road system. Doom also reveals that he is the sole shareholder of the Cloverleaf corporation, and confesses that he bought the trolley car company for the sole purpose of putting it out of production. He then orders Jessica and Roger to be tied up and raised into the air via skyhook to be sprayed by the dip cannon. Valiant distracts the weasels using hilarious antics to make them laugh themselves to death, then attempts to rescue Roger and Jessica when he is interrupted by Doom. The two men then square off, dueling with various ACME props. During the fight, Judge Doom is run over by a steamroller, but does not die as expected. As the steamroller crushes him, Doom's body is flattened into a flimsy paper-thin shape, revealing himself to be a Toon wearing an assortment of fake props such as fake eyeballs, false teeth and a rubber mask in order to disguise his Toon body. When Doom shows his red toon eyes and talks in a high squeaky voice, Eddie recognizes Doom as the bank robber in Toontown long ago who murdered his brother, Teddy Valiant, thus explaining how Doom managed to buy the judicial election and the trolley car company. Doom sprouts a cartoon anvil and an extendable toon buzzsaw from his hand, attempting to finish off Eddie. In the end, Eddie proves to be too clever for the evil Toon, dissolving him by using his own dip concoction against him and leaving behind his human disguise. A crowd of various Toons then surround his empty suit and wonder what kind of Toon he was. It is never revealed what type of Toon he was, or if he was one specific type of Toon at all. The Toons seem to agree that they don't need to know, and decide to live happily ever after when the will of Marvin Acme suddenly appears in Roger's possession, granting full ownership to the citizens of Toontown. Judge Doom appears as a final boss in the 1988 video game adaption, the 1989 video game adaption, and the 1991 video game adaption of the film. In the graphic novel Roger Rabbit: The Resurrection of Doom, it is explained that Doom was originally, a toon named Baron von Rotten, who took up the role of playing the antagonist in movies, until an accident in which Von Rotten suffers a concussion, and awakens believing he is a real villain. Von Rotten thus begins his criminal career, robbing the First National Bank of Toontown, then killing Theodore 'Teddy' Valiant by dropping a piano on his head, and spreading the stolen money all over the town in order to buy the election for Judge of Toontown, assuming the new name of Judge Doom. Characterization In Who Framed Roger Rabbit (as depicted by Christopher Lloyd) he is the much-feared Judge of Toontown. Despite presiding over a city of Toons, Doom is totally without mirth and passes capital punishment on Toons who break the law, placing them in a chemical vat of turpentine, acetone and benzene which he dubs \\"The Dip\\". The Judge employs Toon henchmen (the \\"Toon Patrol\\") to assist him in hunting down Roger Rabbit for the murder of Marvin Acme. Doom wears a black ensemble which includes a caped overcoat (which is always being blown by a gust of wind), a fedora, gloves and rimless yellow- tinted glasses; he also carries a pocketwatch, as well as a cane which is revealed to be a saber in disguise, for use in emergency situations. Concept and creation The props of the character‚Äôs hat, glove and glasses used in the film in The Great Movie Ride at Disney's Hollywood Studios During the writing process in summer 1986, Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman were unsure of whom to include as the villain in the plot of Who Framed Roger Rabbit. They wrote scripts that had either Jessica Rabbit or Baby Herman as the villain, but they made their final decision with newly created character Judge Doom. Price and Seaman based the scheme of Judge Doom of destroying Toontown for a freeway by a planned unproduced sequel of Chinatown entitled Cloverleaf which would be the name of Judge Doom's company in the film. Doom was supposed to have an animated vulture sit on his shoulder, but this was deleted due to the technical challenges this posed. Doom would also have a suitcase of 12 small animated kangaroos that act as a jury, by having their joeys pop out of their pouches, each with letters, when put together would spell YOU ARE GUILTY. This was also cut.Who Shot Roger Rabbit, 1986 script by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman Doom was originally the hunter who killed Bambi's mother. Tim Curry originally auditioned for the role of Judge Doom in September, 1986, but after his audition, the producers found him too terrifying for the role. Christopher Lee was also considered for the role, but turned it down. Several other actors were also considered for the role of Judge Doom, including John Cleese, Roddy McDowall, Eddie Deezen, and Sting. Christopher Lloyd was cast because he previously worked with Robert Zemeckis and Amblin Entertainment on Back to the Future in his most famous role as Emmett Brown. Lloyd compared his part as Doom to his previous role as the Klingon commander Kruge in Star Trek III: The Search for Spock, both being overly evil characters which he considered being \\"fun to play\\". Lloyd avoided blinking his eyes while on camera to perfectly portray the character.Robert Zemeckis, Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman, Ken Ralston, Frank Marshall, Steve Starkey, DVD audio commentary, 2003, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment Merchandising LJN released film merchandise of the character with the pet vulture that was scrapped during production. Doom and Eddie Valiant were both playable characters in the action board game Who Framed Roger Rabbit: Dip Flip by LJN. In the game one player plays Judge Doom to dip as many toons as they can while another player plays Eddie Valiant trying to save the toons. A Funko action figure of Judge Doom with his animated eyes along with him holding the anthropomorphic shoe that he dips in Who Framed Roger Rabbit was released by Walt Disney Company as part of the Roger Rabbit lineup. Cultural impact Judge Doom's final reveal of himself as a toon. The scene has been cited as having a traumatizing or scary effect on children when the movie premiered. Film director Robert Zemeckis compared Judge Doom's invention of \\"the dip\\", intended to eliminate all toons, to Hitler's Final Solution. While a fictional character, Judge Doom's scheme is ultimately based on the development of the existing Southern California freeways. The film is set in 1947 where Judge Doom plans to destroy Toontown over building a freeway and buy off the Pacific Electric railway to dismantle it. According to him it will boost automotive businesses which indeed it did in real life. This scheme has been cited as a metaphor behind the history of automobiles and the economy of the technological age by various authors such as James Howard Kunstler in the book The Geography of Nowhere. Christopher Lloyd received praise for his portrayal of Doom by film critics. Wizard magazine rated Doom as the 60th Greatest Villain of All Time. Digital Spy placed him as one of the most ‚Äúbatshit‚Äù film villains of all time. Fandango placed him number one on their list of \\"the most nefarious live-action Disney villains\\". The film's plot twist of him being revealed as a toon was usually ranked as the scariest of scenes for \\"kids films\\". It is usually ranked along with characters such as Large Marge from Pee-wee's Big Adventure and the Child Catcher from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. His reveal as a toon character was placed as one of the most traumatizing reveals for kids from the 1980s by BuzzFeed. While Rolling Stone placed it as one of the top twelve of scariest moments in a \\"kids\\" film. Neal Justin of the Star Tribune described Judge Doom as making Freddy Krueger \\"look like Fred Rogers\\". YouTuber Nostalgia Critic placed this scene reveal as number three of his \\"Top 11 Scariest Nostalgic Moments\\". Christopher Lloyd responded to the character he played: > Doom was such a dark character. I've had so many people come up to me over > the years to tell me that when they were kids that movie scared the hell out > of them ‚Äî really kind of terrified them. But I remember as a kid watching > those original Walt Disney animated films that terrified me, and I think > that is part of what makes those films so appealing. So it's fun and a bit > of sweet revenge to be the villain ‚Äî the fun, dark part of the movie. Also, > Judge Doom turns out to be a toon, so I don't think you can get too upset > with a toon ‚Äî since they're entertaining and fun. Judge Doom's demise is often referenced as an allusion to the death of the Wicked Witch of the West in The Wizard of Oz. Rappers MC Lars and Kool Keith wrote a song about Roger Rabbit and Judge Doom on Lars's 2015 album, \\"the Zombie Dinosaur LP\\" called \\"the Dip\\".

Informally, a quantified statement \\"\\\\exists x such that \\\\ldots\\" can be viewed as a question \\"When is there an x such that \\\\ldots?\\", and the statement without quantifiers can be viewed as the answer to that question. One way of classifying formulas is by the amount of quantification. Formulas with less depth of quantifier alternation are thought of as being simpler, with the quantifier-free formulas as the simplest. A theory has quantifier elimination if for every formula \\\\alpha, there exists another formula \\\\alpha_{QF} without quantifiers that is equivalent to it (modulo this theory).  Examples  An example from high school mathematics says that a single-variable quadratic polynomial has a real root if and only if its discriminant is non-negative: :: \\\\exists x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}. (a eq 0 \\\\wedge ax^2+bx+c=0)\\\\ \\\\ \\\\Longleftrightarrow\\\\ \\\\ a eq 0 \\\\wedge b^2-4ac\\\\geq 0 Here the sentence on the left-hand side involves a quantifier \\\\exists x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}, while the equivalent sentence on the right does not. Examples of theories that have been shown decidable using quantifier elimination are Presburger arithmetic, algebraically closed fields, real closed fields, atomless Boolean algebras, term algebras, dense linear orders, abelian groups, random graphs, as well as many of their combinations such as Boolean algebra with Presburger arithmetic, and term algebras with queues. Quantifier eliminator for the theory of the real numbers as an ordered additive group is Fourier‚ÄìMotzkin elimination; for the theory of the field of real numbers it is the Tarski‚ÄìSeidenberg theorem. Quantifier elimination can also be used to show that \\"combining\\" decidable theories leads to new decidable theories.  Algorithms and decidability  If a theory has quantifier elimination, then a specific question can be addressed: Is there a method of determining \\\\alpha_{QF} for each \\\\alpha? If there is such a method we call it a quantifier elimination algorithm. If there is such an algorithm, then decidability for the theory reduces to deciding the truth of the quantifier-free sentences. Quantifier-free sentences have no variables, so their validity in a given theory can often be computed, which enables the use of quantifier elimination algorithms to decide validity of sentences.  Related concepts  Various model-theoretic ideas are related to quantifier elimination, and there are various equivalent conditions. Every first-order theory with quantifier elimination is model complete. Conversely, a model- complete theory, whose theory of universal consequences has the amalgamation property, has quantifier elimination.Hodges, Wilfrid (1993). Model theory. Cambridge University Press The models of the theory of the universal consequences of a theory T are precisely the substructures of the models of T. The theory of linear orders does not have quantifier elimination. However the theory of its universal consequences has the amalgamation property.  Basic ideas  To show constructively that a theory has quantifier elimination, it suffices to show that we can eliminate an existential quantifier applied to a conjunction of literals, that is, show that each formula of the form: :\\\\exists x. \\\\bigwedge_{i=1}^n L_i where each L_i is a literal, is equivalent to a quantifier-free formula. Indeed, suppose we know how to eliminate quantifiers from conjunctions of literals, then if F is a quantifier-free formula, we can write it in disjunctive normal form :\\\\bigvee_{j=1}^m \\\\bigwedge_{i=1}^n L_{ij}, and use the fact that :\\\\exists x. \\\\bigvee_{j=1}^m \\\\bigwedge_{i=1}^n L_{ij} is equivalent to :\\\\bigvee_{j=1}^m \\\\exists x. \\\\bigwedge_{i=1}^n L_{ij}. Finally, to eliminate a universal quantifier :\\\\forall x. F where F is quantifier-free, we transform \\\\lnot F into disjunctive normal form, and use the fact that \\\\forall x. F is equivalent to \\\\lnot \\\\exists x. \\\\lnot F.  Relationship with decidability In early model theory, quantifier elimination was used to demonstrate that various theories possess properties like decidability and completeness. A common technique was to show first that a theory admits elimination of quantifiers and thereafter prove decidability or completeness by considering only the quantifier-free formulas. This technique can be used to show that Presburger arithmetic is decidable. Theories could be decidable yet not admit quantifier elimination. Strictly speaking, the theory of the additive natural numbers did not admit quantifier elimination, but it was an expansion of the additive natural numbers that was shown to be decidable. Whenever a theory is decidable, and the language of its valid formulas is countable, it is possible to extend the theory with countably many relations to have quantifier elimination (for example, one can introduce, for each formula of the theory, a relation symbol that relates the free variables of the formula). Example: Nullstellensatz for algebraically closed fields and for differentially closed fields.

It is the largest lake in Mongolia by surface area, covering 3,350 km¬≤ at 759 m above sea level. The northeastern tip of the lake is situated in the Tuva Republic of the Russian Federation. The largest settlement near the lake is Ulaangom. This shallow and very saline body of water is a remainder of a huge saline sea which covered a much larger area several thousand years ago.  Name  The name Uvs Nuur (sometimes spelled Ubsa Nor or Ubsunur) derives from subsen, a Mongolian word referring to the bitter dregs left behind in the making of airag (Mongolian milk wine), and nuur, the Mongolian word for lake. The name is a reference to the lake's salty, undrinkable water.  Geography  Great Lakes Depression from space. Uvs is the largest lake, just above center Uvs Lake has a length of 84 km and a width of 79 km, with an average depth of 6 m. Its basin is separated from the rest of the Great Lakes Depression by the Khan Kh√∂khii ridge; however, it is not a rift lake as some mistakenly think. The main feeding rivers are the Baruunturuun, Nariin gol, and Tes (primary feed of the lake) from Khangai Mountains in the east, and the Kharkhiraa River and Sangil gol from the Altai Mountains in the west.  Ecology  The very large catchment area with no exit results in highly saline water (18.8 ppt, one half as salty as the oceans), primarily due to sulphate and sodium ions. The lake freezes over from October to May. In summer, it exhibits a temperature gradient from 25 ¬∞C at the surface to 19 ¬∞C at the bottom. 29 different species of fish are known from Uvs Lake, and one of them, the Potanini altai osman (Oreoleuciscus potanini), is suitable for human consumption.  Protected sites  All of the lake and many parts of its surroundings have been declared protected sites. The UNESCO is using the designation \\"Uvs Lake site\\" as an umbrella term to summarize twelve separate clusters of protected sites, each a representative of a major eastern Eurasian biome. A satellite image of the western part of the Uvs Lake basin  Lake Uvs Basin  The Uvs Lake is the terminal basin for the Uvs Lake Basin, which covers an area of 70,000 km¬≤ and represents one of the best-preserved natural steppe landscapes of Eurasia. The border between Mongolia and Russia runs through the northern periphery of the basin. Here the world's most northern desert meets the world's most southern tundra zone. Apart from the Uvs Lake, the basin comprises several smaller lakes. As these lakes lie to the north of other inland seas of Central Asia, they are of key importance for waterfowl migration. Uvs Lake drainage basin Since the basin spans the geoclimatic boundary between Siberia and Central Asia, temperatures may vary from ‚àí58 ¬∞C in winter to 47 ¬∞C in summer. Despite its harsh climate, the depression is home to 173 bird species and 41 mammal species, including the globally endangered snow leopard, argali, and Asiatic ibex. The population density is low here. The lack of industry and the reliance of the inhabitants on traditional ways such as nomadic pasturing have little impact on the landscape and allow the ecosystem to remain relatively pristine. In 2003, the UNESCO listed the Uvs Lake Basin as a natural World Heritage Site. It was nominated as \\"one of the largest intact watersheds in Central Asia where 40,000 archeological sites can be found from historically famous nomadic tribes such as the Scythians, the Turks and the Huns.\\" This transboundary patrimony is one of the largest sites inscribed in the World Heritage List to date.

Produced by Tsuburaya Productions, the show aired on Nippon TV from November 9, 1966 to September 27, 1967, with a total of 47 episodes. There was a Booska revival in Japan from 1998 to 2000, when a new season of Booska was released called \\"Booska! Booska!\\" (in English). Booska is the name of a cute, friendly, human-sized kaiju that looks like a cross between a bucktoothed teddy bear and a giraffe. It was originally an iguana until its owner and mega-genius, Daisuke Tonda, fed it experimental powder called \\"kuropara\\" meant to grow the creature into a giant dinosaur-like monster that Daisuke could control. Booska himself appeared wearing a \\"Boo Crown\\" which is made from the element Booskanium, appearing as three golden horns running from front to back down his head. This is the source of all his magical abilities, as well as his intelligence, so if he loses the crown he loses his abilities as well. By using his Boo Crown, Booska can fly, lift up to 100 tons, or even turn invisible, among a number of other powers including shooting lasers and an extendible/retractable tail. The crown itself is temperature-sensitive, so if it warms up his powers and intelligence strengthen, and if it is cooled they weaken. He can also change his size, appearing initially as about a foot tall in Episode 1, but switching between that size and the height of an adult human (1.8 m) weighing 120 kg. Booska needs to be wearing his Boo Crown for his superpowers to work, and his Boo Crown requires nourishment, especially ramen, in order to function properly. In addition, after a turtle bites his tail in the first episode, Booska becomes terrified of turtles, which his enemies use to their advantage. Booska has a brother, Chamergon, who Daisuke agrees to create after Booska reveals that he feels lonely. Daisuke plans on using the same kuropara powder that he used to create Booska on a squirrel, though this plan goes awry when a space alien crashes into the reaction. As a result, Chamergon is part squirrel, part space alien, and he can survive without oxygen. Chamergon has superpowers as well, including an ability to shoot lasers from his tail, super-speed, and the ability to shape-shift through use of a walnut. He is originally Booska's nemesis, but he learns to be better with time, eventually turning into a friend (though never quite losing his tricksy habits). Created by Eiji Tsuburaya, Booska made his debut in the popular 1966 children's TV series, Monster Booska, produced by Tsuburaya Productions (which had just created Ultraman months earlier). The last episode features Booksa and Chamergon leaving in a rocket ship for a distant planet, promising their return in 20 years.

Ricketts Glen is a National Natural Landmark known for its old-growth forest and 24 named waterfalls along Kitchen Creek, which flows down the Allegheny Front escarpment from the Allegheny Plateau to the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians. The park is near the borough of Benton on Pennsylvania Route 118 and Pennsylvania Route 487, and is in five townships: Sugarloaf in Columbia County, Fairmount and Ross in Luzerne County, and Colley and Davidson in Sullivan County. Ricketts Glen's land was once home to Native Americans. From 1822 to 1827, a turnpike was built along the course of PA 487 in what is now the park, where two squatters harvested cherry trees to make bed frames from about 1830 to 1860. The park's waterfalls were one of the main attractions for a hotel from 1873 to 1903; the park is named for the hotel's proprietor, R. Bruce Ricketts, who built the trail along the waterfalls. By the 1890s Ricketts owned or controlled over and made his fortune clearcutting almost all of that land, including much of what is now the park; however he preserved about of virgin forest in the creek's three glens. The sawmill was at the village of Ricketts, which was mostly north of the park. After his death in 1918, Ricketts' heirs began selling land to the state for Pennsylvania State Game Lands. Plans to make Ricketts Glen a national park in the 1930s were ended by budget issues and the Second World War; Pennsylvania began purchasing the land in 1942 and fully opened Ricketts Glen State Park in 1944. The Benton Air Force Station, a Cold War radar installation in the park, operated from 1951 to 1975 and still serves as airport radar for nearby Wilkes-Barre and as the Red Rock Job Corps Center. Improvements since the creation of the state park include a new dam for the Lake Jean, the breaching of two other dams Ricketts built, trail modifications, and a fire tower. In 1999 Hurricane Floyd briefly closed the park and downed thousands of trees; helicopter logging protected the ecosystem while harvesting lumber worth nearly $7 million, some of which paid for a new park office in 2001. The park offers hiking, ten cabins, camping (one of the two camping areas is on a peninsula in the lake), horseback riding, and hunting. Lake Jean is used for swimming, fishing, canoeing and kayaking. In winter there is cross-country skiing, ice fishing on the lake, and ice climbing on the frozen falls. The Glens Natural Area has eight named waterfalls in Glen Leigh and ten in Ganoga Glen, these come together at Waters Meet; downstream in Ricketts Glen there are four to six named waterfalls. The park has four rock formations from the Devonian and Carboniferous periods, and is home to a wide variety of plants and animals. It was named an Important Bird Area by the Pennsylvania Audubon Society and is an Important Mammal Area too. Ricketts Glen State Park was chosen by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) and its Bureau of State Parks as one of \\"25 Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks\\". History =Native Americans= Native American pot found along Kitchen Creek c. 1890 Ricketts Glen State Park is in Pennsylvania, where humans have lived since at least 10000 BC. The first settlers in the state were Paleo- Indian nomadic hunters known from their stone tools.Kent, Smith, McCann, pp. 4, 7‚Äì11, 85‚Äì96, 195‚Äì201.Wallace (2005), pp. 4‚Äì12, 84‚Äì89, 99‚Äì105, 145‚Äì148, 157‚Äì164. The hunter-gatherers of the Archaic period, which lasted locally from 7000 to 1000 BC, used a greater variety of more sophisticated stone artifacts. The Woodland period marked the gradual transition to semi-permanent villages and horticulture, between 1000 BC and 1500 AD. Archeological evidence found in the state from this time includes a range of pottery types and styles, burial mounds, pipes, bows and arrows, and ornaments. The park is in the Susquehanna River drainage basin, the earliest recorded inhabitants of which were the Iroquoian-speaking Susquehannocks. They were a matriarchal society that lived in stockaded villages of large longhouses, but their numbers were greatly reduced by disease and warfare with the Five Nations of the Iroquois, and by 1675 they had died out, moved away, or been assimilated into other tribes. After the demise of the Susquehannocks, the lands of the Susquehanna River valley were under the nominal control of the Iroquois, who also lived in longhouses, primarily in what is now the state of New York. The Iroquois had a strong confederacy which gave them power beyond their numbers.Wallace (1987), pp. 66‚Äì72, 130‚Äì132. To fill the void left by the demise of the Susquehannocks, the Iroquois encouraged displaced tribes from the east to settle in the Susquehanna watershed, including the Shawnee and Lenape (or Delaware).Donehoo, pp. 154‚Äì155, 215‚Äì219. The French and Indian War (1754‚Äì1763) and subsequent colonial expansion encouraged the migration of many Native Americans westward to the Ohio River basin. On November 5, 1768, the British acquired land, known in Pennsylvania as the New Purchase, from the Iroquois in the Treaty of Fort Stanwix; this included what is now Ricketts Glen State Park.Wallace (2005), p. 159. After the American Revolutionary War, Native Americans almost entirely left Pennsylvania.Wallace (2005), pp. 136‚Äì141. About 1890 a Native American pot, decorated in the style of \\"the peoples of the Susquehanna region\\", was found under a rock ledge on Kitchen Creek by Murray Reynolds, for whom a waterfall is named.Wren, p. 56, Plate No. 7. =Early European inhabitants= The park has areas of old-growth forest, with deadfalls estimated at over 900 years old Ricketts Glen State Park is in five townships in three counties. After the 1768 purchase, the land became part of Northumberland County, but was soon divided among other counties. Most of the park is in Luzerne County, which was formed in 1786 from part of Northumberland County. Within Luzerne County, the majority of the park, including all of the waterfalls and most of Lake Jean, is in Fairmount Township, which was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1834; the easternmost part of the park is in Ross Township, which was settled in 1795 and incorporated in 1842. The northwest part of the park is in Sullivan County, which was formed in 1847 from Lycoming County; Davidson Township was settled by 1808 and incorporated in 1833, while Colley Township, which has the park office and part of Lake Jean, was settled in the early 19th century and incorporated in 1849. A small part of the southwest part of the park is in Sugarloaf Township in Columbia County; the township was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1812, the next year Columbia County was formed from Northumberland County.Richter, pp. 3‚Äì46. A hunter named Robinson was the first inhabitant in the area whose name is known; around 1800 he had a cabin on the shores of Long Pond (now called Lake Ganoga), which is less than northwest of the park. The first development within the park was the construction of the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike, which was built from 1822 to 1827 between the Pennsylvania communities of Berwick in the south and Towanda in the north. The turnpike, which Pennsylvania Route 487 mostly follows through the park, had daily stagecoach service from 1827 to 1851; the northbound stagecoach left Berwick in the morning and stopped for lunch at the Long Pond Tavern on the lake about noon.Petrillo, pp. 40‚Äì43. The earliest settlers in what became the park were two squatters who built sawmills to make bed frames from cherry trees they cut for lumber. One squatter, Jesse Dodson, cut trees from around 1830 to 1860 and built a mill and the dam for what became Lake Rose in 1842. Dodson also built a dam south of Mud Pond, near what became Lake Jean; both dams were on the Ganoga Glen branch of Kitchen Creek, and each was used to make a \\"log splash pond\\". The other squatter, named Sickler, also built a mill and log dam, at what became Lake Leigh on the Glen Leigh branch of Kitchen Creek. Sickler was active from 1838 to about 1860.Petrillo, p. 68. In 1865, a well was drilled at the Dodson mill site, after a Mr. Hadley fraudulently added oil to springs in what became the park. Hadley, who had hoped that investors would think petroleum was present, got the Wheeler & Wilson sewing machine company to invest $40,000 ($ in ) in his scheme. In the next two years they drilled two wells, one deep at the former Dodson sawmill at Lake Rose and the other deep near the Ricketts mansion. No oil was ever found, and Hadley eventually fled to Canada.Tomasak, p. 44 =R. Bruce Ricketts= Ganoga Falls in 1875, a woodcut by John B. Bachelder While on a hunting trip on Loyalsock Creek north of the park in 1850, brothers Elijah and Clemuel Ricketts were frustrated at having to spend the night on a hotel's parlor floor. In 1851 or 1853 they bought , including what is now Lake Ganoga and some of the park, as their own hunting preserve, and built a stone house on the lake shore by 1852 or 1855. The stone house served as their lodge and as a tavern; it was known as \\"Ricketts Folly\\" for its isolated location in the wilderness. Clemuel died in 1858 and Elijah bought his share of the land and house. The Ricketts family was not aware of the glens and their waterfalls until about 1865, when they were discovered by two guests from the stone house who went fishing and wandered down Kitchen Creek. Elijah's son Robert Bruce Ricketts, for whom the park is named, joined the Union Army as a private at the outbreak of the American Civil War and rose through the ranks to become a colonel in the artillery. After the war, R. Bruce Ricketts returned to Pennsylvania and in 1869 began purchasing the land around the lake from his father. By 1873 he controlled or owned , and eventually this grew to more than , including the glens and waterfalls and most of the park. While the stone house had served as a home and inn since its construction, in 1872 R. Bruce Ricketts built a three-story wooden addition north of the house. The addition used lumber from a sawmill Ricketts and his partners operated from 1872 to 1875, about southeast of the stone house. The North Mountain House hotel opened in 1873; Ricketts' brother Frank, for whom a park waterfall is named, managed it from then until 1898. Many of the hotel's guests were Ricketts' friends and relations, who arrived after school let out in June and stayed all summer until school resumed in September. In 1876 and 1877, Ricketts ran the first summer school in the United States at his house and hotel; one of the teachers was Joseph Rothrock, later known as the \\"Father of Forestry\\" in Pennsylvania. Ozone Falls in Glen Leigh takes its name from a hiking club. The waterfalls and Ganoga Lake were the hotel's biggest attractions. By 1875 Ricketts had named the tallest waterfall Ganoga Falls; he eventually named 22 of the waterfalls. Ricketts gave most of them Native American names, and named others for relatives and friends.Bachelder, pp. 186‚Äì189.Tomasak, p. 85. Ricketts renamed Long Pond as Ganoga Lake in 1881. The name Ganoga was suggested by Pennsylvania senator Charles R. Buckalew; it is an Iroquoian word which Buckalew said meant \\"water on the mountain\\" in the Seneca language. Donehoo's A History of the Indian Villages and Place Names in Pennsylvania identifies it as a Cayuga language word meaning \\"place of floating oil\\" and the name of a Cayuga village in New York.Donehoo, pp. 63‚Äì64. Whatever the meaning, Ricketts also named the glen with the tallest waterfall in the park \\"Ganoga\\". Ricketts' stone house served as the base for the Ozone hiking club of Wilkes-Barre's excursions on the mountain; the club gave its name to Ozone waterfall in the park. In 1879 Ricketts started the North Mountain Fishing Club, for anglers on the lake and creek. Guests of the hotel paid one dollar to fish as a club member. In 1889 Ricketts hired Matt Hirlinger and five other men to build the trails along the branches of Kitchen Creek and its waterfalls. It took them four years to complete the trails and stone steps through the glens. One of the highest spots on North Mountain (and in the park today) was an outlook point where Ricketts built a wooden observation tower for his guests. After the first tower collapsed, he built a replacement, and named the site Grand View. From the tower, people could see for .Tomasak, pp. 100, 323, 327. =Lumber era= Ricketts mill pond and sawmill in 1903; the village extended into what is now the park. For over 20 years, Ricketts was \\"land poor\\"; he owed much on the mortgages on his vast land holdings, and there were no good means to transport the estimated of lumber from most of his land to sawmills. Large-scale lumber operations of that time floated logs on major streams or used logging railroads, but neither was available to Ricketts. His small sawmill near the stone house closed by 1875, and he was only able to sell two major tracts of land in his lifetime. In 1872 he sold north of the park to a group of investors that included himself; this deal seems to have been for shares of stock (not cash), and the deed for the sale was not recorded until 1893. Ricketts sold along Bowman Creek, including the easternmost parts of the park, to Albert Lewis in 1876; Lewis hoped to build a branch line of the Lehigh Valley Railroad along the creek. In the 1870s and 1880s, Ricketts tried repeatedly and unsuccessfully to find partners and investors who would help him cut the lumber on his land and build a rail line to it.Petrillo, pp. 43‚Äì49. Finally in 1890, Harry Clay Trexler, J.H. Turrell, Ricketts, and partners formed the Trexler and Turrell Lumber Company and leased of Ricketts' land near Ganoga Lake. The company built a sawmill and lumber town named Ricketts on Mehoopany Creek. The town, which was in both Sullivan and Wyoming counties, had 800 inhabitants at its peak and extended into the northernmost section of the park. Rail lines were built to the mills at Ricketts, including the Bowman Creek branch of the Lehigh Valley Railroad which opened in 1883, and also provided passenger service to the hotel on Lake Ganoga.Petrillo, pp. 43‚Äì49, 68. According to Petrillo's Ghost Towns of North Mountain: Ricketts, Mountain Springs, Stull: \\"Ricketts was on the verge of financial disaster for two decades until the Lehigh Valley Railroad was constructed through his lands.\\"Petrillo, p. 3. Waters Meet is the heart of the park, where Ganoga Glen and Glen Leigh meet; the trees in the glens have never been cut. Trexler and Turrell paid Ricketts $50,000 in both 1890 and 1891, and continued to cut his land and pay him for the timber until 1913. By 1911, the main sawmill at Ricketts could cut a day and was supported by three locomotives with 62 cars on of track. Within the park, the area around what became Lake Jean was cut in the 1890s, and Cherry Ridge (east of Red Rock Job Corps Center) and land around Lake Leigh were the last areas cut by the Ricketts mill. Timber in the east part of the park and along Bowman Creek was cut by Lewis' company, which also used logging railroads and even ran track down the Allegheny Front at Phillips Creek.Petrillo, pp. 66, 68.Taber, pp. 344‚Äì351, 365. Lewis' firm built a splash dam on Bowman Creek to help float logs downstream in 1891, then used the lake to cut ice for refrigeration. A second dam and lake were added in 1909 and the icehouses were on state park land; the ice industry supported the small village and post office of Mountain Springs.Petrillo, pp. 25‚Äì36. Ricketts ran his own ice cutting business on Ganoga Lake from 1895 to about 1915.Petrillo, pp. 1, 53. 1939 aerial view of (clockwise from top) Mud Pond and Lakes Leigh, Rose, and Jean in what became the park; the glens are at bottom. Within a decade of the railroad reaching his lands, Ricketts was out of the hotel business. The North Mountain House hotel was threatened by a forest fire in 1900; the subsequent loss of much of the surrounding old-growth forest led to decreased numbers of hotel guests. Changing tastes may have also played a role in the decline in popularity; the hotel had over 150 guests in August 1878, but only about 70 guests in August 1894.Tomasak, pp. 88, 323, 326, 328‚Äì329. The wooden addition was torn down in 1897 or 1903, and \\"despite profits, Ricketts became disenchanted with the hotel business and closed his hotel in 1903\\", though the stone house remained the Ricketts family's summer home. Passenger rail service to Ganoga Lake ended when the hotel closed; the fishing club closed that year as well, but was re- formed in 1907. In 1903 another large fire on North Mountain threatened the sawmill in the lumber town of Ricketts.Tomasak, pp. 328‚Äì329. Not all of Ricketts' plans were financially successful; between 1905 and 1907 he built three dams to generate hydroelectric power within what became the park, forming Lake Leigh at the site of Sickler's mill, Lake Rose at the site of Dodson's mill, and Lake Jean (which incorporated the natural Mud Pond) north of these. Lakes Leigh and Jean were named for Ricketts' daughters, while Rose was a Ricketts family name. The Lake Leigh dam was made of concrete and cost $165,000 (approximately $ in ), while the other two dams were log cribs filled with earth and cost a total of $300,000 (approximately $ in ). If the project had been successful, the plan was to rebuild the two log and timber dams in concrete, however, the \\"dams were poorly constructed and could not be used for hydroelectric purposes\\". After the Panic of 1907, Ricketts wife told him to stop the hydroelectric project before he lost all of their money;Tomasak, pp. 351‚Äì352. this prompted him to say \\"I used to be land poor, but now I'm dam poor\\". =Modern era= Bridge at Waters Meet, with the National Natural Landmark plaque on the rock at right In 1913, Ricketts opened the glens and their waterfalls to the public, charging $1 for parking. Although this fee was unpopular, it remained in place until the land became a state park.Tomasak, p. 353. After Ricketts died in 1918, the Pennsylvania Game Commission bought from his heirs, via the Central Pennsylvania Lumber Company, between 1920 and 1924. This became most of Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 13, west of the park in Sullivan County.Petrillo, p. 69. These sales left the Ricketts heirs with over surrounding Ganoga Lake, Lake Jean and the glens area of the park. An area encompassing was approved as a national park site in 1935, and the National Park Service operated a Civilian Conservation Corps camp at \\"Ricketts Glynn\\" (sic).Paige, Appendix C, Table C-1. The funding to create a National Park at Ricketts Glen was \\"sidetracked\\" in 1936 when the money was redirected to the Resettlement Administration for \\"direct relief\\". Similar projects at French Creek, Raccoon Creek, Laurel Hill, Blue Knob, and Hickory Run were also defunded (all are now Pennsylvania state parks). The financial difficulties of the Great Depression and World War II brought an end to this plan for development. Arthur James, the Governor of Pennsylvania, signed legislation creating Ricketts Glen State Park on August 1, 1941. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania bought , including the glens and their waterfalls, from the heirs for $82,000 on December 31, 1942. The new state park opened to the public on August 1, 1943; however, the park's official history says \\"recreational facilities first opened in 1944\\". The state bought a total of more from the heirs in 1945 and 1950 for $68,000; the park today has about from the Ricketts family and about acquired from others. The Grand View fire tower is at the highest point on the Allegheny Front in the park. The state's original plans for the new park included building an inn, an 18-hole golf course and country club, and a winter sports complex for skiing, ice boating, and tobogganing, as well as a beach with bathing facilities, cabins, and a tent camping area. Only the last three were actually built, all south of Lake Jean; the Hayfield area north of Lake Jean was to have had the facilities for golf and tennis, and the inn and winter sports complex were to have been atop Cherry Ridge, at an elevation of .Tomasak, pp. 373‚Äì374. A 1947 newspaper article estimated that the new park would have 50,000 visitors that year, and detailed the work the state had done since acquiring the land. The Falls Trail through the glens was rebuilt, all the stone steps were replaced, and signs were added. Out of concern for greater safety, footbridges with handrails replaced those made from hewn logs, overhanging rock ledges were removed in places, and the trail was rerouted near some falls. In the southern end of the new park, the state built the Evergreen Trail past Adams Falls, as well as a new parking area for 200 cars and a concession stand, both along Pennsylvania Route 118 (PA 118). The state made other improvements in the park, including replacing or removing all of Ricketts' dams. At Lake Jean it built an earthen dam in 1949‚Äì1950 to replace Ricketts' 1905 timber dam; the new dam increased the size of Lake Jean to and its eastern end now included the former Mud Pond. On April 20, 1958, the 1907 concrete dam at Lake Leigh developed a hole, causing Pennsylvania State Police to evacuate close to 2,000 people from the park. Engineers from the state inspected the dam and made a second breach in the dam near ground level, draining the lake. The resulting flow of water destroyed some of the hiking paths in Glen Leigh and the fish stocked in the lake wound up in Kitchen Creek. The Lake Jean dam was repaired in 1956. The last of Ricketts' dams, at Lake Rose, was breached in 1959 after remnants of a hurricane filled the lake to capacity. The rest of the 1905 dam was removed in 1969.Tomasak, p. 377. At Grand View the state built a wooden fire tower at the site of Ricketts' earlier observation tower, then replaced it with a steel tower. The tower is usually closed to the public, but may be visited if it is staffed by a forest fire warden. From the tower, three states and eleven Pennsylvania counties can be seen. The Lake Leigh dam was built in 1905‚Äì1907, and breached in 1958. Ricketts Glen State Park was the site of a Cold War era radar station. The Benton Air Force Station in the north of the park at what is now the Red Rock Job Corps Center was constructed during 1950 and 1951. Part of the 648th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron based at Fort Indiantown Gap, the radar station was a \\"frontline defender of national security\\". About 300 airmen served at the radar station during the height of the Cold War. Barracks were constructed and recreational facilities for the airmen were provided. In 1963 the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) began jointly operating the radar station; the 648th Squadron was inactivated in 1975 and the Job Corps center was established in 1978, using the barracks and recreational facilities as the Red Rock Job Corps Center. As of 2010, the radar dome is still fully functional and is used by the FAA as an auxiliary radar to the tower at Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport. On October 12, 1969, the Glens Natural Area and its waterfalls was named a National Natural Landmark, and it became a Pennsylvania State Park Natural Area in 1993, which guarantees it \\"will be protected and maintained in a natural state\\". In 1987 the park's ten cabins opened. In 1997 the park was named one of the first 73 Important Bird Areas in the state by the Pennsylvania chapter of the National Audubon Society. That same year heavy rains washed out two bridges on the Falls Trail; because of the difficulty of transporting materials on the trail, an Army National Guard helicopter dropped poles into the glens to rebuild the bridges in early 1997. In the winter of 1997 ice climbing was allowed in the Ganoga Glen section of the park for the first time. That same year training was undertaken by local fire companies to rescue people injured in the park when icy conditions make reaching and transporting them especially treacherous. In 1998 a project to \\"repair and improve the Falls Trail\\" began, with three park employees carrying materials in on foot to stabilize the trail, fix steps, cut down on erosion, and repair some bridges. Originally planned to take four years; it ended up taking six years to complete and cost nearly $1 million. The park office and visitor center was opened in 2001. In September 1999 the remnants of Hurricane Floyd caused massive damage to the park, temporarily closing it and downing thousands of trees. The DCNR hired Carson Helicopters to salvage timber from the downed beech, cherry, maple, and oak trees for $994,000; a crew of 36 workers spent several months cutting the fallen trees into manageable logs, then helicopters flew the logs to the Hayfield area of the park. The salvage operation ran until the fall of 2001, and yielded of lumber. The operation had revenue of almost $7 million, and had the ecological advantage of not requiring heavy logging equipment or new roads in the park.Tomasak, p. 380. Some of the money from the helicopter logging operation was used for park improvements, including a new $1.7 million visitor center and park office, which opened in December 2001. In 2002 the park had \\"up to a half-million visitors each year\\". Beginning in 2003 the campsites in the park, by then over 50 years old, were refurbished. In 2004 the park and surrounding Pennsylvania State Game Lands were named an Important Mammal Area, and in July the park was featured as a day trip in the Travel section of The New York Times. On June 28, 2006 a 100-year flood caused widespread damage in the park, washing out many of the recently completed improvements to the hiking trails along Kitchen Creek. In 2007 the park was one of the first ten parks to be featured in the Pennsylvania Cable Network's series on the state's park system. Lake Jean was drained starting April 27, 2015 to allow replacement of the 65-year old dam control tower. The repairs were finished October 20, 2015, and the lake was full again by January 3, 2016. The DCNR has named Ricketts Glen one of \\"25 Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks\\", citing its old-growth forest and many waterfalls and its status as a National Natural Landmark. Geology and climate Pocono Formation sandstone boulders split by weathering Ricketts Glen State Park covers two different physiographic provinces: the Allegheny Plateau in the north, and the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians in the south. The boundary between these is a steep escarpment known as the Allegheny Front, which rises up to above the land to the south. Within the park, Kitchen Creek has its headwaters on the dissected plateau, then drops approximately down the Allegheny Front in . Much of this drop occurs in Glen Leigh and Ganoga Glen, two narrow valleys carved by branches of Kitchen Creek, which come together at Waters Meet. Ricketts Glen lies south of and downstream from Waters Meet, and here the terrain becomes less steep. There are 24 named waterfalls in the three glens. Note:This is a map on one side giving 22 waterfall names and heights (available at the URL cited) and a park guide on the other side.Brown, pp. 50‚Äì52. The rocks exposed in the park were formed in the Devonian and Carboniferous periods between 370 and 340 million years ago, when the land was part of the coastline of a shallow sea that covered a great portion of what is now North America. The high mountains to the east of the sea gradually eroded, causing a build-up of sediment made up primarily of clay, sand and gravel. Tremendous pressure caused the formation of the sedimentary rocks that are found in the park and in the Kitchen Creek drainage basin: sandstone, shale, siltstone, and conglomerates. There are four distinct rock formations within Ricketts Glen State Park. The most recent and highest of these is the late Mississippian Mauch Chunk Formation, composed of \\"grayish-red shale, siltstone, sandstone, and some conglomerate\\". This forms the highest points on the Allegheny Plateau and is found north of Lake Jean, forming the land beneath the Red Rocks Job Corps Center and Cherry Ridge to the east. The next formation below this is the Mississippian Pocono Formation, which is buff or gray sandstone with conglomerate and siltstone inclusions. This forms most of the Allegheny Plateau and underlies the park office, Lake Jean and the former Lakes Rose and Leigh. The boulders of the Midway Crevasse, which the Highland Trail passes through, are Pocono Formation sandstone. F.L. Ricketts Falls is a wedding cake type waterfall, cascading over Huntley Mountain Formation rock. The third of the rock formations within the park is the Huntley Mountain Formation, from the late Devonian and early Mississippian. This is made of layers of olive green to gray sandstone and gray to red shale. The Huntley Mountain Formation is relatively hard and erosion resistant. It caps the Allegheny Front and has kept it from eroding as much as the softer Catskill Formation, to the south. The Catskill Formation is the lowest and oldest layer in the park, and is composed of red shale and siltstone up to 370 million years old. The Allegheny Front within the park is named North Mountain and Red Rock Mountain, with the latter name coming from an exposed band of Huntley Formation red shale and sandstone visible along Pennsylvania Route 487 (PA 487).Van Diver, pp. 31‚Äì35, 153‚Äì155. Geologists and the official Ricketts Glen State Park web page classify the falls at Ricketts Glen State Park into two types. Wedding-cake falls descend in a series of small steps. Within the park, this type of falls usually flows over thin layers of Huntley Mountain Formation sandstone. In bridal-veil falls, the second type, water falls over a ledge and drops vertically into a plunge pool in the stream bed below. Within the park, this type of falls flows over Catskill Formation rocks or the red shale and sandstone of the Huntley Formation. In the park, the harder caprock which forms the ledge from which the bridal-veil falls drops is gray sandstone. The softer red shale below is eroded away by water, sand and gravel to form the plunge pool. Brown's book Pennsylvania waterfalls: a guide for hikers and photographers uses four types to classify waterfalls: falls, cascade, slide, and chute.Brown, p. xiv Adams Falls is a bridal veil type waterfall, dropping in front of Catskill Formation rock. About 300 to 250 million years ago, the Allegheny Plateau, Allegheny Front, and Appalachian Mountains all formed in the Alleghenian orogeny. This happened long after the sedimentary rocks in the park were deposited, when the part of Gondwana that became Africa collided with what became North America, forming Pangaea. In the years since, up to 5,000 feet (1,500 m) of rock has been eroded away by streams and weather. At least three major glaciations in the past million years have been the final factor in shaping the land that makes up the park today.Shultz, pp. 372‚Äì374, 391, 399, 818. The effects of glaciation have made Kitchen Creek within the park \\"unique compared to all other nearby streams that flow down the Allegheny Front\\", as it is the only one with an \\"almost continuous series of waterfalls\\". Before the last ice age, Kitchen Creek had a much smaller drainage basin; during the ice age, glaciers covered all of the park except the Grand View outcrop. About 20,000 years ago the glaciers retreated to the northeast and glacial lakes formed. Drainage from the melting glacier and lakes cut a sluiceway, or channel, that diverted the headwaters of South Branch Bowman Creek into the Glen Leigh branch of Kitchen Creek. Glacial deposits of debris thick formed a dam blocking water from Ganoga Lake and what became Lake Jean from draining into Big Run, a tributary of Fishing Creek. The water was instead diverted into the Ganoga Glen branch of Kitchen Creek. These diversions added about to the Kitchen Creek drainage basin, increasing it by just over 50 percent. The result was increased water flow in Kitchen Creek, which has been cutting the falls in the glens since. The gradient or slope of Kitchen Creek was fairly stable for its flow when it had a much smaller drainage basin, as Phillips Creek to the east still does. Kitchen Creek is now too steep for its present amount of water flow, and over time erosion will decrease the creek's slope and make it less steep. There are rocks with glacial striations visible within the park. According to the United States Geological Survey Geographic Names Information System, Ricketts Glen State Park is at an elevation of . The two highest points in the park are Cherry Ridge, made of Mauch Chunk Formation rock, at , and the Grand View outcrop of Huntley Mountain Formation sandstone, at . The highest elevation waterfall in the park is Mohawk Falls in Ganoga Glen at ; the lowest elevation waterfall is Adams Falls, in Ricketts Glen just south of PA 118, at . =Weather= Ricketts Glen State Park is on the Allegheny Plateau, which has a continental climate with occasional severe low temperatures in winter and average daily temperature ranges (the difference between the daily high and low) of 20 ¬∞F (11 ¬∞C) in winter and 26 ¬∞F (14 ¬∞C) in summer. The park is in the Huntington Creek watershed, where the mean annual precipitation is 40 to 48 inches (1016 to 1219 mm).Shaw, p. 129. Weather records for Ricketts Glen State Park show that the highest recorded temperature at the park was in 1988, and the record low was in 1984. On average, January is the coldest month, July is the hottest month, and June is the wettest month. Ecology black bear in the park It has been estimated that before the arrival of William Penn and his Quaker colonists in 1682, up to 90 percent of what is now Pennsylvania was covered with woods: over of eastern white pine, eastern hemlock, and a mix of hardwoods. By 1890, Ricketts' land was the largest tract of old-growth forest remaining in the state, and though he made his fortune clearcutting nearly all his land, the forests in the glens of Ricketts Glen State Park were \\"saved from the lumberman's axe through the foresight of the Ricketts family\\". The rough terrain of the glens made it difficult to harvest timber from the area. Many of the old-growth trees are believed to be over 500 years old, and ring counts on fallen trees have revealed ages of over 900 years. The forests in and around Ricketts Glen State Park are some of the most extensive in northeastern Pennsylvania, and provide habitat for a wide variety of woodland creatures. The swampy areas in the park provide a habitat for plants like black gum, yellow birch, cinnamon fern, sphagnum and various sedges. The old- growth forest in the Glens Natural Area is mostly eastern hemlock, eastern white pine, and oaks, and the park is home to 85 species of shrubs, woody vines, and trees, including seven kinds of conifers. The streams and lakes of Ricketts are fisheries for many fish species, although fishing is prohibited in the glens area. In 2009, of Kitchen Creek downstream from Waters Meet and all of Phillips Creek were classified as Class A Wild Trout Waters, defined by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission as \\"streams which support a population of naturally produced trout of sufficient size and abundance to support a long-term and rewarding sport fishery\\". Lake Jean is home to brook trout, brown trout, brown bullhead, and yellow bullhead. Acid rain with a pH near 3.0 has altered the ecology of the lakes and region; in Lake Jean low pH has decreased the number and quality of insects and plankton at the base of the food chain. Fish which are acid tolerant are predominant, including fathead minnows, muskellunge, pumpkinseed, walleye, and yellow perch. Predators like chain pickerel and largemouth bass are relatively few in number, and adult fish appear to grow rapidly but breed comparatively poorly. Since 1996, the DCNR has added of powdered lime to the lake each year to make the pH more neutral. =Glens Natural Area= Ganoga Falls, the park's tallest at 94 feet (29 m), in winter A registered National Natural Landmark since 1969, the Glens Natural Area is the main scenic attraction in the park and covers . Among perhaps of old-growth forest, two branches of Kitchen Creek cut through the deep gorges of Ganoga Glen and Glen Leigh and unite at Waters Meet; then flow through Ricketts Glen. These old trees are commonly up to tall, with diameters of almost . The park has a great variety of trees as it lies at the boundary between the northern and southern types of hardwoods. In 1993, the state designated the Glens Natural Area a State Park Natural Area, which means that it \\"will be protected and maintained in a natural state\\". No buildings or latrines are allowed in the natural area, and the bridges in it are built with wood, not steel or concrete. A series of trails parallels the branches of Kitchen Creek as they course down the Glens. Glen Leigh features eight named waterfalls and is south of the former Lake Leigh. Ganoga Glen is southeast of the former Lake Rose and has ten named falls, including the Ganoga Falls, the tallest in the park. The DCNR recognizes three named waterfalls in Ricketts Glen just south of Waters Meet, plus Adams Falls farther downstream at PA 118. Adams Falls, the southernmost and one of the most scenic in the park, is about south of PA 118, via an easy stroll along a trail from the parking lot. Brown's Pennsylvania waterfalls: a guide for hikers and photographers recognizes these 22 named falls plus two more in the park. One is on Shingle Cabin Brook as it enters Kitchen Creek just south of Waters Meet; the other, Kitchen Creek Falls, is directly below the PA 118 highway bridge, which obscures much of the view. There are also several unnamed falls in the park, such as a good-sized unnamed waterfall on a tributary of the Ganoga Glen branch of Kitchen Creek, or the \\"forgotten falls\\" on the South Branch Bowman Creek. The Falls Trail includes the trails through the glens, plus the Highland Trail, which connects the top ends of Ganoga Glen and Glen Leigh to form a triangular loop, and passes through the \\"Midway Crevasse,\\" a crack in Pocono Formation rock. All but two of the named waterfalls are either on the triangular loop or south of it. Hiking the entire Glens area on the Falls Trail loop, beginning and ending at PA 118, covers . A shorter hike involves parking at Lake Rose, near the junction of Ganoga Glen and the Highland Trail. =Mammals= White-tailed deer fawn at Ricketts Glen Ricketts Glen State Park was named part of an Important Mammal Area because it \\"support[s] critical habitat for a wide range of mammals\\"; Pennsylvania has 64 wild mammal species. The park has an extensive forest cover of hemlock-filled valleys and hardwood-covered mountains, which makes it a habitat for big woods wildlife. Animals such as white-tailed deer, black bear, red and gray squirrels, porcupine, and raccoon are seen fairly regularly. Less common creatures include beaver, bobcat, coyote, fisher, mink, muskrat, red fox, and river otter. In addition to mammals, Ricketts Glen is also known for its wild turkeys, wild flowers, butterflies, dragonflies, and the occasional timber rattlesnake.Ostrander, pp. 13‚Äì17. White-tailed deer became locally extinct on Ricketts' land by 1912, mirroring the sharp decline in Pennsylvania's deer population from overhunting and loss of habitat in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The state imported nearly 1,200 white-tailed deer from Michigan between 1906 and 1925 to re-establish the species throughout Pennsylvania, and Ricketts brought deer to the area of the park in 1914. Pennsylvania's deer population rebounded from roughly one thousand in 1905 to roughly one million in 1928. Deer are now one of the most numerous mammals in the park, and their overbrowsing threatens development of trees and plants there. The deer eat most of the saplings and shrubs before they can reach their full size, which reduces the number of low lying plants many birds use for shelter. The white-tailed deer became the official state animal in 1959. By 2001, deer populations had increased to the point where it was feared that \\"Pennsylvania is losing its vegetative diversity from deer over-browsing\\". Other locally extinct mammals in Pennsylvania include bison, grey wolf, lynx, marten, moose, mountain lion, and wolverine. Beaver and river otter have been successfully reintroduced.Whiteford, p. 23. In 1995 and 1996, 39 fishers were released in the State Game Lands adjoining the park, and breeding populations appear to have been reestablished. The coyote seems to have come to the state in the 1930s. Black bear and wild turkey populations were also severely affected by overhunting and loss of habitat; the recovery of their populations in the 20th century has been \\"aided by the re-growth of the eastern deciduous forest\\". Bears prefer a mixed forest of hickory and oak with an understory of shrubs such as blueberry and laurel; they use patches of coniferous forest for cover during the winter months. =Important Bird Area= Bald eagle in a tree at Lake Jean in the park The Pennsylvania Audubon Society has designated all of Ricketts Glen State Park a Pennsylvania Important Bird Area (IBA); an IBA is defined as a globally important habitat for the conservation of bird populations. The state park was originally part of the much larger North Mountain IBA, which encompassed , including all of the park and nearby Pennsylvania State Game Lands Numbers 13, 57, and 66. Ricketts Glen State Park is featured in the Audubon Society's Susquehanna River Birding and Wildlife Trail Guide. Ornithologists and bird watchers have recorded a total of 75 species at Ricketts Glen State Park and within the North Mountain IBA. Several factors contribute to the high total of bird species observed: there is a large area of forest in the park, as well as great habitat diversity. The location along the Allegheny Front also contributes to the diverse bird populations. The North Mountain IBA was said to be the \\"largest extant forest\\" in northeastern Pennsylvania and one of the largest forests in the state of Pennsylvania. It was officially adopted by the North Branch Bird Club and was \\"well-known\\" by members of local Audubon societies and the Pennsylvania Society for Ornithology. Ricketts Glen is \\"a well-known wild flower and butterfly destination\\". Ricketts Glen State Park provides a breeding habitat for four species of flycatchers and two species of waterthrushes. American bittern nest near the park. Bald eagle are frequent visitors to the park, and some ornithologists believe they may be nesting there since adult pairs have been observed with their young. The park is a nesting location for three \\"rare\\" birds, including two birds of prey (the northern goshawk and northern harrier), and Swainson's thrush, as well as one \\"at risk\\" duck, the green- winged teal. Ricketts Glen State Park has extensive acreage of \\"interior forest\\" that is far from open space; several bird species that are area- sensitive are found within these forests in the park, including the black- throated green warbler, red-eyed vireo, dark-eyed junco and black-capped chickadee. Two species of owl, barred and northern saw-whet, inhabit the deep forests. The hemlock forests of the glens are home to the Louisiana waterthrush, Acadian flycatcher, Blackburnian warbler, blue-headed vireo, magnolia warbler, brown creeper, golden-crowned kinglet and winter wren. Wood thrush are found in the lower elevations of the park and are replaced within the ecosystem by hermit thrush at the higher elevations. The Canada warbler and black-throated blue warbler are on several watchlists, but are common within the park. The Canada warbler inhabits blueberry thickets with white- throated sparrow, while the black-throated blue warbler is found in the forests atop the plateau with the least flycatcher. Common raven are regularly seen soaring over the forests of the park looking for carrion. Canada goose are present in the park and have been classified as a \\"pest\\" due to their high numbers and the large amount of fecal waste they leave on the shores of Lake Jean. Ricketts Glen's forests also support populations of Nashville and yellow-rumped warblers, yellow-bellied sapsucker, red-breasted nuthatch, and purple finch. Recreation Canoes on the shores of Lake Jean =Hunting, fishing and boating= of the park are open to hunting and trapping. Common game animals include black bear, gray squirrel, ring-necked pheasant, ruffed grouse, wild turkey, and white-tailed deer. The common fur-bearing animals in Ricketts Glen State Park are beaver, bobcat, coyote, mink, muskrat, and raccoon. Lake Jean is a warm-water fishery that is open to fishing, ice fishing, swimming, and boating. Common game fish include panfish, trout and bass. Boating is permitted on the lake, which has two boat launches. Gasoline- powered boats are prohibited. Canoes and other human-powered boats are permitted, as are sail boats and electric-powered vessels. There is a boat rental concession on the lake, which has canoes, kayaks, row boats, and paddle boats available. No fishing is allowed in the Glens Natural Area. =Cabins, camping, swimming, and picnics= One of ten cabins in the park Ricketts Glen State Park has 10 modern cabins that are available to rent on a year-round basis. All cabins are furnished with electric heat, two or three bedrooms, living room, kitchen, and bath. Cabin renters must bring their own household items such as linens and cookware. One cabin is ADA accessible. There are 120 campsites at Ricketts Glen State Park. Each campsite has access to washhouses with flush toilets, showers, and laundry tubs. The campsites also have fire rings and picnic tables. There are two camping areas on the shores of Lake Jean, with one of the campgrounds on a peninsula. There is also an organized group tenting area, which can accommodate six groups of up to 40 persons. The beach on Lake Jean is open from mid-May through mid-September. A concession stand and modern restrooms are at the beach. Lifeguards have not been provided since 2008; visitors swim at their own risk. Picnic areas are at Lake Jean and the PA 118 access area at the Falls Loop Trail trailhead. Charcoal grills are provided for use at the picnic areas. =Environmental education and trails= The Midway Crevasse on the Highland Trail Environmental education specialists lead guided tours of parts of the park from March through November. The walks give school groups, scouting organizations, and other visitors a close and informed look at natural wetlands, old-growth forests, waterfalls, flora and fauna, and geologic formations. Other programs are held in the park office, on topics such as safety around wild animals. In summer and fall, park educators lead \\"Ghost Town Walks\\" to the ruins of the lumber village of Ricketts and to adjoining State Game Lands. There are of hiking trails at Ricketts Glen State Park, and a trail loop is open for horseback riding. The trails range from \\"easy\\" hikes like the Beach Trail along Lake Jean, to \\"difficult\\" hikes such as the Falls Trail loop, which passes by many of the waterfalls of the park. In 2001, John Young in Hike Pennsylvania: An Atlas of Pennsylvania's Greatest Hiking Adventures wrote of the Falls Trail: \\"This is not only the most magnificent hike in the state, but it ranks up there with the top hikes in the East.\\"Young, p. 66. In 2003, Backpacker Magazine named the park's Falls Trail loop one of its 30 favorite day hikes in the contiguous United States. Beginning of the Falls Trail The Falls Trail passes through old-growth forest and along Kitchen Creek and its waterfalls Evergreen Trail near Boston Run Many of the trails in the park are difficult and hikers are urged to use caution, especially on the Falls Trail, which is steep and often wet and slippery. Each year hikers fall in the glens and have to be rescued, which usually takes dozens of volunteers and up to 11 hours because of the remote locations and rugged terrain. As of 2008, the former concession stand along PA 118 in the southern end of the park was used for storage of rescue equipment.Tomasak, p. 374. *Falls Trail is a difficult loop, estimated to take 4 to 5 hours to hike.Mitchell, pp. 44‚Äì52. The January 2009 issue of Backpacker Magazine named the Falls Trail loop the best hike in Pennsylvania, as part of the magazine's Reader's Choice Awards. It has a series of waterfalls, each cascading though rock-strewn clefts, and passes through a stand of old-growth forest. The park's website stresses the difficulty of the trail, and The New York Times calls it \\"difficult and potentially dangerous\\" near the top of glens. The Falls Trail was \\"rehabilitated\\" in 2008 to make the \\"easier to hike\\". The trail is closed during the winter months to hiking, but it is open to ice climbing. The ice climbers must use an ice axe, crampons, and rope. *Highland Trail is a moderate hiking trail at the top of the Falls Trail loop. It passes through the Midway Crevasse, a narrow gap between two large blocks of Pocono sandstone conglomerate. *Ganoga View Trail is a moderate trail named for Ganoga Falls, the highest waterfall in the park. Ganoga View Trail is an alternative route to Ganoga Falls and less difficult than the Falls Trail. *Grand View Trail is a moderate trail which reaches an elevation of , the highest point on Red Rock Mountain (which is part of the Allegheny Front). The area is known for its flora, including blooms of mountain laurel in June and rhododendron in July. A firetower is open during the fire season for further viewing. *Old Beaver Dam Road Trail is a easy loop trail that is accessed from a parking lot on PA 487 or the Lake Rose parking area. *Beach Trail is an easy trail that provides access to the Lake Jean day-use and swimming areas from both camping areas. * Old Bulldozer Road Trail is a difficult trail that ascends a bulldozer road that was built during the construction of Ricketts Glen State Park. The trail begins at the parking lot on PA 118 with a short but steep climb and connects with Mountain Springs Trail. *The Bear Walk Trail is an easy trail from the cabin area to Lake Rose that serves as an access to the longer hiking, cross-country, and snowmobiling trails of the park. *Evergreen Trail is a self-guided, ecological trail that passes through a stand of old-growth forest that includes an Eastern Hemlock that pre-dates the 1492 arrival of Christopher Columbus. *Mountain Springs Trail is a moderate trail that is \\"off the beaten path\\". It passes the remains of the Lake Leigh dam, the \\"forgotten falls\\" and descends the South Branch of Bowman Creek to Mountain Springs Lake, which is owned by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. *Cherry Run Trail is near the Lake Leigh dam access. It is a moderate trail that passes through groves of cherry trees on an old logging road.

According to William Reynolds Ricketts' HABS history of the house, Petrillo's history of the region Ghost Towns of North Mountain, and the house's NRHP nomination form, the Ricketts brothers bought the lake and surrounding land in 1851, began building the stone house that year, and finished it in 1852. The year 1852 is also carved in stone on the front (west side) of the house, which faced the highway (see this photograph). However, according to Tomasak's The Life and Times of Robert Bruce Ricketts, the brothers purchased the lake, tavern, and land on April 13, 1853, for $550, and had the house built from 1854 to 1855.Tomasak, p. 38. :b. All sources agree that the North Mountain House hotel closed in 1903, but differ on the date that the wooden addition used for the hotel was torn down. William Reynold's Ricketts' history for the HABS and Petrillo's book both report it was razed in 1897, while McDonald's NRHP nomination form and Tomasak's book give the year as 1903.Tomasak, p. 313. :c. The Ricketts family is descended from Clan Rose of Kilravock Castle near Nairn in the Scottish Highlands. Before he changed the name to Ganoga Lake in 1881, R. Bruce Ricketts called Long Pond \\"Highland Lake\\" for a few years. :d. As recently as March 2016, the International Union for Conservation of Nature's World Commission on Protected Areas still classified Ricketts Glen State Park as \\"Category II, National Park\\".

In many cases conferences are subdivided into smaller divisions, with the best teams competing at successively higher levels. Conferences often, but not always, include teams from a common geographic region. United States and Canada In the United States and Canada, the National Hockey League (NHL) and National Basketball Association (NBA) are divided into Eastern (NHL, NBA) and Western (NHL, NBA) Conferences, with multiple divisions within each conference (three in each NBA conference, two in each NHL conference). In both leagues, a total of sixteen teams (eight from each conference) qualify for the league's postseason playoffs. In the NHL, since the 2013‚Äì14 season, the top 3 in a division are guaranteed to qualify and division winners are awarded the highest seeds, meaning they will have home-ice advantage in a given round. In the NBA, starting with the 2015‚Äì16 season, the playoff spots go to the eight top teams in each conference by overall record, with home-court advantage in each playoff series based solely on record. Major League Soccer (MLS) also divides itself into an Eastern and Western Conference, though it does not have divisions within them; it too allocates an equal number of teams from each conference to play for its MLS Cup Playoffs (since 2015, this has been six teams each). The National Football League (NFL) is divided into an American Football Conference (AFC) and a National Football Conference (NFC). Both conferences have 16 teams, and each conference is divided into 4 divisions of 4 teams each. These conferences, for the most part, derive from the fact that they were once separate organizations: the original National Football League and the 1960s American Football League; the two entities merged in 1970, with each league forming the basis of the NFC and AFC respectively. The NFL allocates six teams from each conference for the NFL playoffs; the four division winners (guaranteed one of the top four seeds, based on winning percentage), and the two best-non division winners, also known as wild cards. Major League Baseball (MLB) does not use the word \\"conference.\\" Instead, it is divided into two separate leagues which are identical to the conferences listed above in all but name (which, although their operations have been integrated via the Commissioner of Baseball in modern times, were originally separately managed organizations with an intense rivalry). These are the American League (AL) and National League (NL), with 15 teams each. Each league is divided into the Eastern (AL, NL), Central (AL, NL), and Western (AL, NL) divisions, with all six divisions having 5 teams each. Each league produces five teams for postseason play, with each division winner also guaranteed one of the top three seeds, even if their record is lower than the league's top wild card teams. In all four sports, the champion of one conference (or league in MLB's case) plays the champion of the other conference for the final round championship, this is guaranteed to occur because the rules for the playoffs require play to be exclusively within the conference/league in all rounds before the final round, leaving only two teams for the finals (one from each conference/league) and the records of teams outside a conference/league are ignored, which can allow teams with inferior records to make the playoffs while teams in the other conference with better records do not get in. An extreme example of this has occurred twice in the NFL, when the 2010 Seattle Seahawks and 2014 Carolina Panthers reached the playoffs by winning their respective divisions despite losing records (7‚Äì9 for the Seahawks, 7‚Äì8‚Äì1 for the Panthers). These are the only two teams ever to qualify for the playoffs with losing records in seasons that were not shortened by strikes. In addition, a team's regular season schedule is weighted towards more games against other teams within their own division and to a lesser extent their own conference; NBA and NHL teams play at least two games (one at each home arena) against every other team in their league in a regular season, but in MLB and the NFL teams do not. In college sports, the terms \\"league,\\" \\"conference\\" and (generally at lower levels) \\"athletic association\\" can be used interchangeably to refer to a group of teams (generally eight to twelve colleges and/or universities, occasionally as high as sixteen) that regularly play against each other within a national governing body, the most significant of which is the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Most of these groups (including the \\"Power Five\\" conferences that are primary partners in the College Football Playoff) refer to themselves as conferences, although the Horizon League, Ivy League, Patriot League, Pioneer League and Summit League use the word \\"league\\" instead, and another conference calls itself the Colonial Athletic Association. The NCAA itself is divided into divisions and subdivisions based on athletic scholarship eligibility, which can lead to redundancy when these conferences also have divisions of their own. For instance, the Southeastern Conference is part of NCAA Division I (specifically the Football Bowl Subdivision), but is itself also subdivided into an East and West division. England and Wales In English association football, the top level of non-League football‚Äîi.e., the level below the Premier League and the three tiers that make up the English Football League (EFL)‚Äîwas known as the Football Conference from the 1986‚Äì87 season through the end of the 2014‚Äì15 season. In turn, from 2004, the Conference was divided into three leagues‚ÄîConference Premier, at the fifth tier of the English football pyramid, and Conference North and Conference South, which made up the sixth tier. Starting with the 2015‚Äì16 season, the Football Conference and its component leagues were renamed. The Football Conference and Conference Premier were both renamed \\"National League\\", and the two regional leagues were renamed National League North and National League South. This does not strictly meet the definition indicated in the previous sections of this article, as each individual league mentioned in this section is a separate competition. The only times that teams from different leagues compete against one another in meaningful matches are in knockout cup competitions, such as the FA Cup (open to teams from all levels), the EFL Cup (open only to teams from the Premier League and the English Football League), and the FA Trophy (open only to teams in the broader definition of the National League, plus the two tiers below it). Russia The Kontinental Hockey League has a Western Conference and an Eastern Conference. This is similar to the NHL's conferences in North America. Rugby union =Super Rugby= In rugby union, Super Rugby is the highest level of provincial competition in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, the highest domestic level in Japan, and the only professional domestic level in Argentina. From the creation of Super Rugby in 1996 through 2015, only Australia, New Zealand and South Africa participated; the competition added teams in the latter two countries in 2016. Since the 2011 season, it has operated on a conference system. From 2011 through to 2015, the competition had one conference based in each of its three founding countries. The winner of each conference received a playoff spot, as did the three next best teams overall. With the addition of Argentina's Jaguares and Japan's Sunwolves for 2016, plus a sixth franchise for South Africa, the competition reorganised into a new four-conference system. In 2016 and 2017, Australia and New Zealand formed separate conferences within an Australasian group; the South African teams were joined by the Jaguares and Sunwolves in a \\"South African\\" group, with that group also being divided into two conferences. The winner of each conference continued to receive a playoff spot, with additional berths going to the next three best Australasian teams and the next best team of the South African group. For 2018, Super Rugby will revert to a 15-team format, following the dropping of two teams from South Africa and one from Australia. The new format features three conferences‚ÄîAustralia, New Zealand and South Africa, each with five teams; the Sunwolves will join the Australian conference and the Jaguares will play in the South African conference. The conference winners will continue to receive playoff berths, with additional berths going to the top five teams in the overall competition table that were not already qualified. =Pro14= In the same sport, Pro14 adopted a conference system effective in 2017‚Äì18, following the addition of the two South African teams dropped from Super Rugby. The competition split into two conferences, each featuring two teams from Ireland and Wales, plus single teams from Italy, Scotland and South Africa. Following the league season, the teams that top each conference table will receive berths in the semifinals, with the next two teams in each conference playing off for semifinal berths. Philippines The now defunct Manila Industrial and Commercial Athletic Association, where teams are represented by companies instead of geographical entities, and there are multiple tournaments held sequentially in a season, a conference refers to a single tournament. This has since been carried over by other leagues, such as the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA), which has its own conferences, the Philippine Super Liga, the Premier Volleyball League, the PBA D-League, and formerly the Philippine Basketball League. The term \\"conference\\" referring to a single tournament does not apply if there's only one tournament in a season, such as in the case of the college sports leagues, the Philippine Football League, and the Maharlika Pilipinas Basketball League.

MENA is an English-language acronym referring to the Middle East and North Africa, which corresponds to the Greater Middle East. It is alternatively called the WANA (West Asia and North Africa), as well as the MENAP, which also includes Central Asia and the South Asian countries of Afghanistan and Pakistan. The MENAP covers an extensive region stretching from the Maghreb in the west to Pakistan in the east. The MENA acronym is often used in academia, military planning, disaster relief, media planning as a broadcast region, and business writing. Moreover, the region shares a number of cultural, economic and environmental similarities across the countries; for example, some of the most extreme impacts of climate change will be felt in the region.  List of countries  MENA has no standardized definition; different organizations define the region as consisting of different territories. List of countries and territories most commonly constitute MENA.Dumper, Michael, and Stanley, Bruce E., Cities of the Middle East and North Africa: A Historical Encyclopaedia, 2007       Additional countries and territories that are often counted as part of MENA. Most, if not say, is sometimes overlapped with the Arab World:    * Additional countries and territories that are sometimes counted as part of MENA, but rarely mentioned:           * *Non-sovereign territories.  Economy and education  The MENA region has vast reserves of petroleum and natural gas that make it a vital source of global economic stability. According to the Oil and Gas Journal (January 1, 2009), the MENA region has 60% of the world's oil reserves () and 45% of the world's natural gas reserves ( ). As of 2011, 8 of the 15 OPEC nations are within the MENA region. According to Pew Research Center, 40% of the adult population in MENA has completed less than a year of primary school. The fraction is higher for women, of whom half have been to school for less than a year.  Religion  Islam is by far the dominant religion in nearly all of the MENA territories; 91.2% of the population is Muslim. The Middle East‚ÄìNorth Africa region comprises 20 countries and territories with an estimated Muslim population of 315 million or about 23% of the world's Muslim population. The term \\"MENA\\" is often defined in part in relation to majority- Muslim countries located in the region, although several nations in the region are not Muslim-dominated.  Demographics   Climate change   Instability in the region  Due to rich resources, mainly oil and gas, combined with its location between three continents, (Asia, Africa and Europe), the MENA region has been in conflict since the collapse of the Ottoman Empire; notably due to the creation of Israel, a Jewish state among Arab and Muslim countries; Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict; the Iran‚ÄìIraq War; Iran‚ÄìSaudi Arabia proxy conflict; and the rise of terrorism. Conflict in the region had come to its highest peak so far in the 21st century, with incidents such as the U.S. intervention of Iraq in 2003 and subsequent Iraq War and the rise of ISIS; the Arab Spring, which spread war to throughout the region such as the Syrian Civil War, Libyan Civil War and Yemeni Civil War. Controversy over term Due to the geographic ambiguity and Eurocentric nature of the term \\"Middle East\\", some people prefer use other terms like WANA (West Asia and North Africa) or the less common NAWA (North Africa-West Asia). MENA region remains the most common term and is used by most organizations, academia, and political entities flexibly, including those in the region itself. Other terms ; MENAP From April 2013, the International Monetary Fund started using a new analytical region called MENAP (Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan), which adds Afghanistan and Pakistan to MENA countries. Now MENAP is a prominent economic grouping in IMF reports. ; MENAT The term MENAT (Middle East, North Africa, and Turkey) has been used to include Turkey in the list of MENA countries.

Metaxas was the royal architect of George I of Greece and is best known for being the architect chosen by George Averoff to restore also the Panathinaiko Stadium for the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens, the birth of the modern Olympic movement, while the design was from Ernst Ziller. He studied architecture at University of Dresden and passed with honours, in his time he would also expand or reform many historic buildings including the Benaki Museum and the National Archaeological Museum, Athens to name a couple. Other works of him include the design for St Andrew's Cathedral, Patras and various public buildings and mansions in Athens. Metaxas was also an avid shooter and would appear in four Summer Olympics and win two medals, he firstly competed in the 1896 Summer Olympics in the stadium he helped restore, he entered the 200 metre military rifle and the 300 metre free rifle, three positions and he would end up finishing in fourth place in both events. Ten years later, Metaxas was competing at the 1906 Intercalated Games, where he competed in nine events, with his best result being a silver medal in the Trap, double shot at 14 metres. Two years later Metaxas won a bronze medal in the trap shooting event at the 1908 Summer Olympics, held in London, tying for third place with British shooter Alexander Maunder, with 57 of 80 targets hit. Metaxas's medal in this event does not appear in the IOC medal database. In 1912, aged 50, Metaxas made his final Olympic appearance at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden, where he finished sixth in the trap competition and 35th in the 30 metre rapid fire pistol event. Metaxas would later turned to politics before his death.

(2005). Birds, Mammals, and Reptiles of the Gal√°pagos Islands. Second Edition. Hampshire, UK:WildGuides Ltd. p.116. is a species of large sea turtle of the family Cheloniidae. It is the only species in the genus Chelonia. Its range extends throughout tropical and subtropical seas around the world, with two distinct populations in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, but it is also found in the Indian Ocean. The common name refers to the usually green fat found beneath its carapace, not to the color of its carapace, which is olive to black. This sea turtle's dorsoventrally flattened body is covered by a large, teardrop- shaped carapace; it has a pair of large, paddle-like flippers. It is usually lightly colored, although in the eastern Pacific populations parts of the carapace can be almost black. Unlike other members of its family, such as the hawksbill sea turtle, C. mydas is mostly herbivorous. The adults usually inhabit shallow lagoons, feeding mostly on various species of seagrasses. The turtles bite off the tips of the blades of seagrass, which keeps the grass healthy. Like other sea turtles, green sea turtles migrate long distances between feeding grounds and hatching beaches. Many islands worldwide are known as Turtle Island due to green sea turtles nesting on their beaches. Females crawl out on beaches, dig nests and lay eggs during the night. Later, hatchlings emerge and scramble into the water. Those that reach maturity may live to 80 years in the wild. C. mydas is listed as endangered by the IUCN and CITES and is protected from exploitation in most countries. It is illegal to collect, harm or kill them. In addition, many countries have laws and ordinances to protect nesting areas. However, turtles are still in danger due to human activity. In some countries, turtles and their eggs are hunted for food. Pollution indirectly harms turtles at both population and individual scales, as well as light pollution. Many turtles die after being caught in fishing nets. Also, real estate development often causes habitat loss by eliminating nesting beaches. Taxonomy The green sea turtle is a member of the tribe Chelonini. A 1993 study clarified the status of genus Chelonia with respect to the other marine turtles. The carnivorous Eretmochelys (hawksbill), Caretta (loggerhead) and Lepidochelys (ridley) were assigned to the tribe Carettini. Herbivorous Chelonia warranted their status as a genus, while Natator (flatback) was further removed from the other genera than previously believed. The species was originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae as Testudo mydas. In 1868, Marie Firmin Bocourt named a particular species of sea turtle Chelonia agassizii.Chelonia agassizi is a commonly cited misspelling of this taxon. This \\"species\\" was referred to as the \\"black sea turtle\\". Later research determined Bocourt's \\"black sea turtle\\" was not genetically distinct from C. mydas, and thus taxonomically not a separate species. These two \\"species\\" were then united as Chelonia mydas and populations were given subspecies status: C. mydas mydas referred to the originally described population, while C. mydas agassizi referred only to the Pacific population known as the Gal√°pagos green turtle. This subdivision was later determined to be invalid and all species members were then designated Chelonia mydas. The oft-mentioned name C. agassizi remains an invalid junior synonym of C. mydas. The species' common name does not derive from any particular green external coloration of the turtle. Its name comes from the greenish color of the turtles' fat, which is only found in a layer between their inner organs and their shell. As a species found worldwide, the green turtle has many local names. In the Hawaiian language it is called honu, and it is locally known as a symbol of good luck and longevity.

C. mydas has a dorsoventrally flattened body, a beaked head at the end of a short neck, and paddle-like arms well-adapted for swimming. Adult green turtles grow to long. The average weight of mature individuals is and the average carapace length is . Exceptional specimens can weigh or even more, with the largest known C. mydas having weighed and measured in carapace length. Anatomically, a few characteristics distinguish the green turtle from the other members of its family. Unlike its close relative the hawksbill turtle, the green turtle's snout is very short and its beak is unhooked. The neck cannot be pulled into the shell. The sheath of the turtle's upper jaw possesses a denticulated edge, while its lower jaw has stronger, serrated, more defined denticulation. The dorsal surface of the turtle's head has a single pair of prefrontal scales. Its carapace is composed of five central scutes flanked by four pairs of lateral scutes. Underneath, the green turtle has four pairs of inframarginal scutes covering the area between the turtle's plastron and its shell. Mature C. mydas front appendages have only a single claw (as opposed to the hawksbill two), although a second claw is sometimes prominent in young specimens. The carapace of the turtle has various color patterns that change over time. Hatchlings of Chelonia mydas, like those of other marine turtles, have mostly black carapaces and light-colored plastrons. Carapaces of juveniles turn dark brown to olive, while those of mature adults are either entirely brown, spotted or marbled with variegated rays. Underneath, the turtle's plastron is hued yellow. C. mydas limbs are dark- colored and lined with yellow, and are usually marked with a large dark brown spot in the center of each appendage. Distribution Green sea turtle nesting populations The range of the green sea turtle extends throughout tropical and subtropical oceans worldwide. The two major subpopulations are the Atlantic and the eastern Pacific subpopulations. Each population is genetically distinct, with its own set of nesting and feeding grounds within the population's known range. One of the genetic differences between the two subpopulations is the type of mitochondrial DNA found in individual's cells. Individuals from rookeries in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea have a similar type of mitochondrial DNA, and individuals from the Pacific and Indian Oceans have another type of Mitochondrial DNA.Bowen, B.W., Meylan, A.B.; Ross, J.P.; Limpus, C.J.; Balazs, G.H.; Avise, J.C.. (1992) Global population structure and natural history of the green turtle (Chelonia mydas) in terms of matriarchal phylogeny. Evolution. International Journal of Organic Evolution. Vol. 46, No 4, pp. 865‚Äì881 Their native range includes tropical to subtropical waters along continental coasts and islands between 30¬∞N and 30¬∞S. Since green sea turtles are a migrating species, their global distribution spans into the open ocean. The differences in mitochondrial DNA more than likely stems from the populations being isolated from each other by the southern tips of both South America and Africa with no warm waters for the green sea turtles to migrate through. The green sea turtle is estimated to inhabit coastal areas of more than 140 countries, with nesting sites in over 80 countries worldwide throughout the year. In the United States Atlantic coast, green sea turtles can be found from Texas and north to Massachusetts. In the United States Pacific coast, they have been found from southern California north to the southernmost tip of Alaska. The largest populations of green sea turtles within the United States coastline are in the Hawaiian Islands and Florida. Globally, the largest populations of sea turtles are in the Great Barrier Reef in Australia and the Caribbean islands. =Atlantic subpopulation= The green sea turtle can generally be found throughout the Atlantic Ocean. Although the species is most abundant in tropical climates, green sea turtles can also be found in temperate climates, and individuals have been spotted as far north as Canada in the western Atlantic, and the British Isles in the east. The subpopulation's southern range is known until past the southern tip of Africa in the east and Argentina in the western Atlantic. The major nesting sites can be found on various islands in the Caribbean, along the eastern shores of the continental United States, the eastern coast of the South American continent and most notably, on isolated North Atlantic islands. In the Caribbean, major nesting sites have been identified on Aves Island, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Costa Rica. In recent years there are signs of increased nesting in the Cayman Islands. One of the region's most important nesting grounds is in Tortuguero in Costa Rica. In fact, the majority of the Caribbean region's C. mydas population hails from a few beaches in Tortuguero. Within United States waters, minor nesting sites have been noted in the states of Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and all along the east coast of Florida. Hutchinson Island in particular is a major nesting area in Florida waters. Notable locations in South America include secluded beaches in Suriname and French Guiana. In the Southern Atlantic Ocean, the most notable nesting grounds for Chelonia mydas are found on the island of Ascension, hosts 6,000‚Äì13,000 turtle nests. In contrast with the sporadic distribution of nesting sites, feeding grounds are much more widely distributed throughout the region. Important feeding grounds in Florida include Indian River Lagoon, the Florida Keys, Florida Bay, Homosassa, Crystal River, and Cedar Key. =Indo-Pacific subpopulation= Kona, Hawaiialt=Photo of turtle swimming towards surface with diver in background In the Pacific, its range reaches as far north as the southern coast of Alaska and as far south as Chile in the east. The turtle's distribution in the western Pacific reaches north to Japan and southern parts of Russia's Pacific coast, and as far south as the northern tip of New Zealand and a few islands south of Tasmania. The turtles can be found throughout the Indian Ocean. Significant nesting grounds are scattered throughout the entire Pacific region, including Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands, the South Pacific, the northern coast of Australia, and Southeast Asia. Major Indian Ocean nesting colonies include India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and other coastal countries. The east coast of the African continent hosts a few nesting grounds, including islands in the waters around Madagascar. Nesting grounds are found all along the Mexican coast. These turtles feed in seagrass pastures in the Gulf of California. Green turtles belonging to the distinct Hawaiian subpopulation nest at the protected French Frigate Shoals some west of the Hawaiian Islands. In the Philippines, green turtles nest in the Turtle Islands along with closely related hawksbill turtles. Indonesia has a few nesting beaches, one in the Meru Betiri National Reserve in East Java. The Coral Sea has nesting areas of world significance.C.Michael Hogan. 2011. Coral Sea. Encyclopedia of Earth. Eds. P.Saundry & C.J.Cleveland. National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC The Great Barrier Reef has two genetically distinct populations; one north and one south. Within the reef, 20 separate locations consisting of small islands and cays were identified as nesting sites for either population of C. mydas. Of these, the most important is on Raine Island. Major nesting sites are common on either side of the Arabian Sea, both in Ash Sharqiyah, Oman, and along the coast of Karachi, Pakistan. Some specific beaches there, such as Hawke's Bay and Sandspit, are common to both C. mydas and L. olivacea subpopulation. Sandy beaches along Sindh and Balochistan are nesting sites. Some off the Pakistani coast, Astola island is another nesting beach. On 30 December 2007, fishermen using a hulbot-hulbot (a type of fish net) accidentally caught an , long and wide turtle off Barangay Bolong, Zamboanga City, Philippines. December is breeding season near the Bolong beach. Abs-Cbn Interactive, Green sea turtle caught in Zamboanga. The population that has often been known as the Gal√°pagos green turtle have been recorded and observed in the Gal√°pagos as far back as the 17th century by William Dampier. Not much attention has been paid to them due to the overwhelming research done on the Gal√°pagos giant tortoises. Only over the last 30 years have extensive studies been performed covering the behaviors of the Gal√°pagos green turtles. Much of the debate that has surrounded them recently is over the binomial classification of the species. At one point the name Chelonia agassizii was applied to this population as a separate species. Analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA of 15 nesting beaches. however has demonstrated that there is not only no significant distinction of this population but that it would be paraphyletic to recognise it. As such the species name Chelonia agassizzii is considered a junior synonym of Chelonia mydas as such it is considered as a local cariant of the populations of the East Pacific waters and those of other nesting areas. The morphological distinctiveness of the Gal√°pagos green turtle has given rise to the debate, but evidence of taxonomic distinctiveness is best served using the combination of multiple datasets. The two most notable morphological distinctions are the considerably smaller adult size and the much darker pigmentation of the carapace, plastron, and extremities. Other distinctions are the curving of the carapace above each hind flipper, the more dome-shaped carapace, and the very long tail of adult males. Three possibilities have arisen from their unique characteristics: agassizii is a separate species from C. mydas, it is a subspecies of green sea turtle, or it is simply a color mutation. These facts have led to the debate over binomial separation however due to the significance of the DNA testing results there have been no distinctions made at this time. At a meeting for sea turtle scientists and their collaborators in 2000, the evidence for the taxonomic position of the Gal√°pagos green turtle was reviewed and a majority among the participants supported treating it as a population or subspecies of the green turtle (instead of a separate species). However, this is possibly a case of political taxonomy. As such the three major international checklists that cover turtles of the world Reptile Database the checklist of Fritz and Havas (2007) and the IUCN Checklist (TTWG 2017) all consider this a junior synonym.  Habitat  Green sea turtles move across three habitat types, depending on their life stage. They lay eggs on beaches. Mature turtles spend most of their time in shallow, coastal waters with lush seagrass beds. Adults frequent inshore bays, lagoons, and shoals with lush seagrass meadows. Entire generations often migrate between one pair of feeding and nesting areas. Green sea turtles, Chelonia mydas, are classified as an aquatic species and are distributed around the globe in warm tropical to subtropical waters. The environmental parameter that limits the distribution of the turtles is ocean temperatures below 7 to 10 degrees Celsius. Within their geographical range, the green sea turtles generally stay near continental and island coastlines. Near the coastlines, the green sea turtles live within shallow bays and protected shores. In these protected shores and bays, the green sea turtle habitats include coral reefs, salt marshes, and nearshore seagrass beds. The coral reefs provide red, brown, and green algae for their diet and give protection from predators and rough storms within the ocean. The salt marshes and seagrass beds contain seaweed and grass vegetation, allowing ample habitat for the sea turtles. Turtles spend most of their first five years in convergence zones within the bare open ocean that surround them. These young turtles are rarely seen as they swim in deep, pelagic waters. Green sea turtles typically swim at .P. Luschi, G. C. Hays, C. Del Seppia, R. Marsh, and F. Papi. (1998) The navigational feats of green sea turtles migrating from Ascension Island investigated by satellite telemetry. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. Ecology and behavior alt=Turtle swimming toward surface As one of the first sea turtle species studied, much of what is known of sea turtle ecology comes from studies of green turtles. The ecology of C. mydas changes drastically with each stage of its life history. Newly emerged hatchlings are carnivorous, pelagic organisms, part of the open ocean mininekton. In contrast, immature juveniles and adults are commonly found in seagrass meadows closer inshore as herbivorous grazers. =Diet= Green sea turtle grazing on seagrass The diet of green turtles changes with age. Juveniles are carnivorous, but as they mature they become omnivorous. Young sea turtles eat fish eggs, molluscs, jellyfish, small invertebrates, worms, sponges, algae, and crustaceans. Green sea turtles have a relatively slow growth rate because of the low nutritional value of their diet. Body fat turns green because of the consumed vegetation. This diet shift has an effect on the green turtle's skull morphology.http://www.nwf.org/wildlife/wildlife-library/amphibians-reptiles- and-fish/sea-turtles/green-sea-turtle.aspxNishizawa, H., M. Asahara, N. Kamezaki, and N. Arai. 2010. Differences in the skull morphology between juvenile and adult green turtles: implications for the ontogenetic diet shift. Current Herpetology 29(2): 97‚Äì101. Their serrated jaw helps them chew algae and sea grasses. Most adult sea turtles are strictly herbivorous. =Predators and parasites= Only human beings and the larger sharks feed on C. mydas adults. Specifically, tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) hunt adults in Hawaiian waters. Juveniles and new hatchlings have significantly more predators, including crabs, small marine mammals and shorebirds. Additionally, their eggs are vulnerable to predation by scavengers like red foxes and golden jackals.Predation on green turtle Chelonia mydas nests by wild canids at Akyatan beach, Turkey by L. Brown and D. W. Macdonald, Biological Conservation, Volume 71, Issue 1, 1995, pp. 55‚Äì60. Green sea turtles have a variety of parasites including barnacles, leeches, protozoans, cestodes, and nematodes. Barnacles attach to the carapace, and leeches to the flippers and skin of the turtles, causing damage to the soft tissues and leading to blood loss. Protozoans, cestodes and nematodes lead to many turtle deaths because of the infections in the liver and intestinal tract they cause. The greatest disease threat to the turtle population is fibropapilloma, which produces lethal tumor growth on scales, lungs, stomach, and kidneys. Fibropapilloma is caused by a herpesvirus that is transmitted by leeches such as Ozobranchus branchiatus, a species of leech which feeds almost entirely on green sea turtles. =Life cycle= alt=Photo of newly hatched turtle held in human hand Green sea turtles migrate long distances between feeding sites and nesting sites; some swim more than to reach their spawning grounds. Beaches in Southeast Asia, India, islands in the western Pacific, and Central America are where green sea turtles breed. Mature turtles often return to the exact beach from which they hatched. Females usually mate every two to four years. Males, on the other hand, visit the breeding areas every year, attempting to mate. Mating seasons vary between populations. For most C. mydas in the Caribbean, mating season is from June to September. The French Guiana nesting subpopulation nests from March to June. In the tropics, green turtles nest throughout the year, although some subpopulations prefer particular times of the year. In Pakistan, Indian Ocean turtles nest year-round, but prefer the months of July to December. Sea turtles return to the beaches on which they were born to lay their own eggs. The reason for returning to native beaches may be that it guarantees the turtles an environment that has the necessary components for their nesting to be successful. These include a sandy beach, easy access for the hatchlings to get to the ocean, the right incubation temperatures, and low probability of predators that may feed on their eggs. Over time these turtles have evolved these tendencies to return to an area that has provided reproductive success for many generations. Their ability to return to their birthplace is known as natal homing.Wynekey, J.; Lohmann, J.K.; Musick, J.A. 2013. The biology of sea turtles. CRC Press. Vol 3. Pp 59‚Äì70 The males also return to their birthplaces in order to mate. These males that return to their homes know they will be able to find mates because the females born there also return to breed. By doing this, the green sea turtles are able to improve their reproductive success and is why they are willing to expend the energy to travel thousands of miles across the ocean in order to reproduce. Mating behaviour is similar to other marine turtles. Female turtles control the process. A few populations practice polyandry, although this does not seem to benefit hatchlings. After mating in the water, the female moves above the beach's high tide line, where she digs a hole 11-22 inches in depth with her hind flippers and deposits her eggs. The hole is then covered up again. Clutch size ranges between 85 and 200, depending on the age of the female. This process takes about an hour to an hour and a half. After the nest is completely covered, she returns to the sea. The female will do this 3 to 5 times in one season. The eggs are round and white, and about 45 mm in diameter. The hatchlings remain buried for days until they all emerge together at night. The temperature of the nest determines the sex of the turtles at around the 20-40 day mark.Spotila, J. R. (2004). Sea turtles: a complete guide to their biology, behavior, and conservation. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. At around 50 to 70 days, the eggs hatch during the night, and the hatchlings instinctively head directly into the water. This is the most dangerous time in a turtle's life. As they walk, predators, such as gulls and crabs, feed on them. A significant percentage never make it to the ocean. Little is known of the initial life history of newly hatched sea turtles. Juveniles spend three to five years in the open ocean before they settle as still-immature juveniles into their permanent shallow-water lifestyle. It is speculated that they take twenty to fifty years to reach sexual maturity. Individuals live up to eighty years in the wild. It is estimated that only 1% of hatchlings reach sexual maturity. Each year on Ascension Island in the South Atlantic, C. mydas females create 6,000 to 25,000 nests. They are among the largest green turtles in the world; many are more than a metre in length and weigh up to . =Breathing and sleep= Sea turtles spend almost all their lives submerged, but must breathe air for the oxygen needed to meet the demands of vigorous activity. With a single explosive exhalation and rapid inhalation, sea turtles can quickly replace the air in their lungs. The lungs permit a rapid exchange of oxygen and prevent gases from being trapped during deep dives. Sea turtle blood can deliver oxygen efficiently to body tissues even at the pressures encountered during diving. During routine activity, green and loggerhead turtles dive for about four to five minutes, and surface to breathe for one to three seconds. Green sea turtle resting under rocks in the Uruguayan Atlantic coast. Turtles can rest or sleep underwater for several hours at a time, but submergence time is much shorter while diving for food or to escape predators. Breath-holding ability is affected by activity and stress, which is why turtles quickly drown in shrimp trawlers and other fishing gear. During the night while sleeping and to protect themselves from potential predators, the adults wedge themselves under rocks below the surface and under ledges in reefs and coastal rocks. Many green sea turtles have been observed in returning to the same sleeping location night after night.  Physiology and sensory modalities  Green sea turtles tend to have good vision, well adapted to a life at sea. The turtles can see many colors, but are most sensitive to light from violet to yellow or wavelengths of 400 to 600 nanometers. They do not see many colors in the orange to red portion of the light spectrum. On land, however, the sea turtles are nearsighted because the lenses in the eyes are spherical and adjusted to refraction underwater. Sea turtles have no external ear and only one ear bone, called the columella. With one ear bone, the turtles can only hear low frequency sounds, from 200 to 700 Hz. Sounds can also be detected through vibrations of the head, backbone, and shell. The nose of the turtle has two external openings and connects to the roof of the mouth through internal openings. The lower surface of the nasal passage has two sets of sensory cells called the Jacobson's organ. The turtle can use this organ to smell by pumping water in and out of its nose. Since green sea turtles migrate long distances during breeding seasons, they have special adaptive systems in order to navigate. In the open ocean, the turtles navigate using wave directions, sun light, and temperatures. The sea turtles also contain an internal magnetic compass. They can detect magnetic information by using magnetic forces acting on the magnetic crystals in their brains. Through these crystals, they can sense the intensity of Earth's magnetic field and are able to make their way back to their nesting grounds or preferred feeding grounds. Natal homing is an animal's ability to return to its birthplace in order to reproduce. Natal homing is found in all species of sea turtles and in other animals such as salmon. How these turtles are able to return to their birthplace is an interesting phenomenon. Many researchers believe that sea turtles use a process called imprinting, which is a special type of learning that occurs when turtles first hatch that allows them to recognize their native beach. There are two types of imprinting that are thought to be the reason turtles can find these beaches. The first is the chemical imprinting hypothesis. This hypothesis states that much like salmon, sea turtles are able to use olfactory cues and senses to smell their way home. However, a problem with this hypothesis is that some turtles travel thousands of miles to return to their native beaches, and the scents from that area aren't likely to travel and be distinguishable from that distance. The second hypothesis is the geomagnetic. This hypothesis states that as it hatches, a young turtle will imprint on the magnetic field of the beach they are born on. This hypothesis strongly correlates to the method which sea turtles use to navigate the earth. In order to tolerate the constant heat loss in the water, sea turtles have the ability to shunt blood away from tissues that are tolerant of low oxygen levels toward the heart, brain, and central nervous system. Other mechanisms include basking on warm beaches and producing heat through their activity and movements of their muscles. In the winter months, turtles living at higher latitudes can hibernate for a short period in the mud.  Unique characteristics and features  The green sea turtles exhibit sex differences by their development and appearance. As adult turtles, males are easily distinguishable from the females by having a longer tail (visibly extending past the shell) and longer claws on the front flippers. The hatching time and sex of the turtles are determined by the incubation temperature of the nest. Hatchings occur more quickly in nests that are warmer than nests that are in cooler conditions. Warm nesting sites above 30 degrees Celsius favor the development of females, whereas nesting sites below 30 degrees Celsius produce males. The position of the egg in the nest also affects sex- determination. Eggs in the center tend to hatch as females due to the warmer conditions within the nest. Green sea turtles play an essential role within the ecosystem in which they live. In the seagrass beds, the turtles feed on the seagrass by trimming only the top and leaving the roots of the plant. Through their feeding technique, the turtles help to improve the health and growth of the seagrass beds. The healthy seagrass beds that the turtles provide give habitat and feeding grounds for many species of fish and crustaceans. On the nesting beaches, the green sea turtles provide key nutrients for the ecosystem through their hatched egg shells. In their coral reef habitat, the green sea turtles have a symbiotic interaction with reef fish, including the yellow tang. The yellow tang fish swims along with the turtle and feeds on the algae, barnacles, and parasites on its shell and flippers. This species interaction provides food for the yellow tang and provides a necessary cleaning and smoothing of the turtle's shell. This cleaning helps the turtle swim by reducing the amount of drag and improves their health. Importance to humans Key West, Floridaalt=Black-and-white photo of several turtles set on their backs Historically, the turtles' skin was tanned and used to make handbags, especially in Hawaii. Ancient Chinese considered the flesh of sea turtles a culinary delicacy, including and especially C. mydas. Particularly for this species, the turtle's fat, cartilage, and flesh, known as calipee, are sought as ingredients for making turtle soup, a popular 19th-century American dish. In Java, Indonesia, sea turtle eggs were a popular delicacy. However, the turtle's flesh is regarded as ·∏•arƒÅm or \\"unclean\\" under Islamic law (Islam is Java's primary religion). In Bali, turtle meat was a prominent feature at ceremonial and religious feasts. Turtles were harvested in the remotest parts of the Indonesian archipelago. Bali has been importing sea turtles since the 1950s, as its own turtle supplies became depleted. Sumertha, I.N. 1974. Perikanan penyu dan cara pengelolaan di Indonesia. Dokumen. Kom. IPB 8: 1‚Äì18. Cited in The mostly Hindu Balinese do not eat the eggs, but sell them instead to local Muslims. Commercial farms, such as the Cayman Turtle Farm in the West Indies, once bred them for commercial sale of turtle meat, turtle oil (rendered from the fat), turtle shell, and turtle leather made from the skin. The farm's initial stock was in large part from \\"doomed\\" eggs removed from nests threatened by erosion, flooding, or in chemically hostile soil. The farms held as many as 100,000 turtles at any one time. When the international markets were closed by regulations that did not allow even farm-bred turtle products to be exported internationally, the surviving farm became primarily a tourist attraction, supporting 11,000 turtles. Initially started as Mariculture Ltd., then Cayman Turtle Farm Ltd and subsequently branded Boatswain's Beach, in 2010 the farm's brandname was changed to Cayman Turtle Farm: Island Wildlife Encounter. Sea turtles are integral to the history and culture of the Cayman Islands. When the islands were first discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1503, he named them \\"Las Tortugas\\" because of the abundance of sea turtles in the waters around the islands. Many of the earliest visitors came to the Cayman Islands to capture the turtles as a source of fresh meat during long voyages. The green turtle is a national symbol displayed as part of the Coat of arms of the Cayman Islands, which also forms part of the national flag of the Cayman Islands. The country's currency uses a turtle as the watermark in its banknotes. A stylised sea turtle nicknamed \\"Sir Turtle\\" is the mascot of the national airline Cayman Airways and is part of the livery of its aircraft. A ki'i p≈çhaku (petroglyph) of a turtle (or honu) can be found on The Big Island of Hawaii in the Pu'u Loa lava fields. The green sea turtle (called Honu) has always held a special meaning for Hawaiians and this petroglyph shows its importance dating to possibly when the islands first became populated. The turtle symbolizes a navigator that can find his way home time after time. This symbol mirrors the real life of the green Hawaiian turtle as it will swim hundreds of miles to lay its eggs at its own place of birth. Though there are other myths as well, some Hawaiian legends say the honu were the first to guide the Polynesians to the Hawaiian Islands. Hawaiians revere the turtle and the legend of Kailua, a turtle who could take the form of a girl at will. In human form, she looked after the children playing on Punalu'u beach.www.HawaiianLife.com Conservation In a alt=Photo from front of swimming turtle In recent decades, sea turtles have moved from unrestricted exploitation to global protection, with individual countries providing additional protection, although serious threats remain unabated. All populations are considered \\"threatened\\". =Threats= Human action presents both intentional and unintentional threats to the species' survival. Intentional threats include continued hunting, poaching and egg harvesting. More dangerous are unintentional threats, including boat strikes, fishermen's nets that lack turtle excluder devices, pollution and habitat destruction. Chemical pollution may create tumors; effluent from harbors near nesting sites may create disturbances; and light pollution may disorient hatchlings. Habitat loss usually occurs due to human development of nesting areas. Beach-front construction, land \\"reclamation\\" and increased tourism are examples of such development. An infectious tumor-causing disease, fibropapillomatosis, is also a problem in some populations. The disease kills a sizeable fraction of those it infects, though some individuals seem to resist the disease. In addition, at least in the Southwestern Atlantic (R√≠o de la Plata, Uruguay), exotic invasive species such as the rapa whelk Rapana venosa, were reported massively bio-fouling immature green turtles, reducing buoyancy, increasing drag, and causing severe injuries to the carapace.Lezama, C., Carranza, A., Fallabrino, A., Estrades, A., Scarabino, F., & L√≥pez-Mendilaharsu, M. (2013). Unintended backpackers: bio-fouling of the invasive gastropod Rapana venosa on the green turtle Chelonia mydas in the R√≠o de la Plata Estuary, Uruguay. Biological invasions, 15(3), 483‚Äì487 Because of these threats, many populations are in a vulnerable state. A poached green turtle in Costa Rica Pacific green turtles' foraging habitats are poorly understood and mostly unknown. These foraging grounds are most likely along the coast of Baja California, Mexico and southern California,National Marine Fisheries Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 1998. Recovery Plan for U.S. Pacific Populations of the East Pacific Green Turtle (Chelonia mydas). National Marine Fisheries Service, Silver Spring, MD. in which these turtles have a high risk of incidental capture by coastal fisheries. The main mortality factor for these turtles is the shrimp trawlers in Mexico, in which many of these turtles go undocumented. The only foraging area that has been identified is the San Diego Bay, but it is heavily polluted with metals and PCBs. These contaminants have a negative effect on the ocean environment, and have been shown to cause lesions and sometimes mortality. Green turtles also are threatened by entanglement and ingestion of plastic. In San Diego Bay, an adult green turtle was found dead with monofilament netting tightly packed in its esophagus. In addition there are indications that global climate change is affecting the ability of green turtle populations in Australia to produce males due to their temperature- dependent sex determination and the rising temperatures in the northern Great Barrier Reef region. Construction of new thermal power stations can raise local water temperature, which is also said to be a threat. Green sea turtles are the most commonly traded species along Java's south coast and are sold in the form of whole, stuffed animals or turtle oil, locally known as \\"minyak bulus\\". =Global initiatives= A confiscated musical instrument made from the shell of a green turtle, on display at Narita International Airport. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has repeatedly listed green sea turtles in its Red List under differing criteria. In 1982, they officially classified it as an endangered species. The 1986, 1988, 1990, 1994, and the landmark 1996 edition of the IUCN Red List, retained the listing. In 2001, Nicholas Mrosovsky filed a delisting petition, claiming some green turtle populations were large, stable and in some cases, increasing. At the time, the species was listed under the strict EN A1abd criteria. The IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee ruled that visual counts of nesting females could not be considered \\"direct observation\\" and thus downgraded the species' status to EN A1bd‚Äîretaining the turtle's endangered status. In 2004, the IUCN reclassified C. mydas as endangered under the EN A2bd criteria, which essentially states the wild populations face a high risk of extinction because of several factors. These factors include a probable population reduction of more than 50% over the past decade as estimated from abundance indices and by projecting exploitation levels. On 3 May 2007, C. mydas was listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) as a member of the family Cheloniidae. The species was originally listed on Appendix II in 1975. The entire family was moved to Appendix I in 1977, with the exception of the Australian population of C. mydas. In 1981, the Australian population joined the rest. It is therefore illegal to import, export, kill, capture or harass green turtles. The Zoological Society of London has listed the reptile as an EDGE species. The Mediterranean population is listed as critically endangered. The eastern Pacific, Hawaiian and Southern California subpopulations are designated threatened. Specific Mexican subpopulations are listed as endangered. The Florida population is listed as endangered. The World Wide Fund for Nature has labeled populations in Pakistan as \\"rare and declining\\". In the State of Hawaii, specifically on the Island of Hawaii (Hawaii County), state representative Faye Hanohano, a Native Hawaiian rights activist, pressed for a measure to delist C. mydas from protected status so that Native Hawaiians could legally harvest the turtles and possibly their eggs as well. The bill, HCR14, was largely overlooked by the media since at that point it was only a local issue. While the bill was passed in the House, the Senate's Committee on Energy and Environment refused to hear it, which meant that the bill did not go on to be heard by the Senate. =Country- specific initiatives= Osaka Aquarium, profile photo of turtle resting on bottom In addition to management by global entities such as the IUCN and CITES, specific countries around the world have undertaken conservation efforts. The Indonesian island of Bali has traditional uses that were considered sustainable, but have been questioned considering greater demand from the larger and wealthier human population. The harvest was the most intensive in the world. In 1999, Indonesia restricted turtle trade and consumption because of the decreasing population and threat of a tourist boycott. It rejected a request made by Bali Governor I Made Mangku Pastika in November 2009 to set a quota of 1,000 turtles to be killed in Hindu religious ceremonies. While conservationists respect the need for turtles in rituals, they wanted a smaller quota. Multiple Filipino protected areas have significant green sea turtle nesting and feeding sites. The most notable is Turtle Islands Wildlife Sanctuary, an UNESCO tentative site which encompasses an entire municipality and one of Southeast Asia's most important green sea turtle nesting sites.https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/6008/ Other notable sites include the UNESCO tentaive site of El Nido-Taytay Management Resource Protected Area (ENTMRPA) and the UNESCO world heritage site of Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park (TRNP). The species is protected under Republic Act 9147 or the Wildlife Resources Conservation and Protection Act, while the sites where they live and nest are protected under the National Integrated Protected Areas System (NIPAS) Act.https://businessmirror.com.ph/2017/10/15/protecting-the-endangered- pawikan/ Ecotourism is one initiative in Sabah, Malaysia. The island of Pulau Selingan is home to a turtle hatchery. Staff people place some of the eggs laid each night in a hatchery to protect them from predators. Incubation takes around sixty days. When the eggs hatch, tourists assist in the release of the baby turtles into the sea. The Hawaiian subpopulation has made a remarkable comeback and is now one focus of ecotourism and has become something of a state mascot. Students of Hawaii Preparatory Academy on the Big Island have tagged thousands of specimens since the early 1990s. In the United Kingdom the species is protected by a Biodiversity Action Plan, due to excess harvesting and marine pollution. The Pakistani-branch of the World Wide Fund for Nature has been initiating projects for secure turtle hatching since the 1980s. However, the population has continued to decline. In the Atlantic, conservation initiatives have centered around Caribbean nesting sites. The Tortuguero nesting beaches in Costa Rica have been the subject of egg- collection limits since the 1950s. The Tortuguero National Park was formally established in 1976, in part, to protect that region's nesting grounds. On Ascension Island, which contains some of the most important nesting beaches, an active conservation program has been implemented. Karumb√© has been monitoring foraging and developmental areas of juvenile green turtles in Uruguay since 1999.Karumb√© Cayman Turtle Farm located in Grand Cayman in the northwest Caribbean Sea is the first farm to have achieved the second generation of green sea turtles bred, laid, hatched, and raised in captivity. Since its beginning in 1968, the farm has released over 31,000 turtles into the wild, and each year more captive-bred turtles are released into the Caribbean Sea from beaches around the island of Grand Cayman. Captive-bred turtles released from the farm as hatchlings or yearlings with \\"living tags,\\" have now begun to return to nest on Grand Cayman as adults. On February 19, 2012 the farm released the first 2nd-generation captive-bred green sea turtle equipped with a Position Tracking Transponder, or PTTPosition Tracking (also known as a satellite tag). In addition, the farm provides turtle meat products to the local population for whom turtle has been part of the traditional cuisine for centuries. In so doing, the farm curtails the incentive to take turtles from the wild, which over the years in addition to the Cayman Turtle Farm's release of captive-bred turtles has enabled an increase in the number of turtles sighted in the waters around the island of Grand Cayman and nesting on its beaches. In the Pacific, green sea turtles nest on the motu (islets) in the Funafuti Conservation Area, a marine conservation area covering 33 square kilometers (12.74 square miles) of reef, lagoon and motu on the western side of Funafuti atoll in Tuvalu. On Raine Island, up to 100,000 nesting females have been observed in a season, with the cay producing 90% of the region's green turtles. However, the hatching rate declined in the 1990s, and a further decline in the population was threatened by the deaths of thousands of females as they struggled to climb the small sandy cliffs. In addition, as the shape of the island had changed over time, the spread of the beaches outwards had led to greater risk of inundation of the turtle nests. Between 2011 and 2020, a collaborative project by the Queensland Government, BHP (as corporate sponsor), the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, Great Barrier Reef Foundation, and Wuthathi and Meriam traditional owners, reshaped the island using heavy machinery in a way that gave the female turtles a smoother passage and reduced the risk of nest inundation. A sophisticated monitoring and research system, using 3D modelling, satellite technology and drones was employed, and monitoring continues. , a project called \\"The Turtle Cooling Project\\" is being undertaken by scientists from the World Wildlife Fund Australia, University of Queensland, Deakin University and the Queensland Government. It is looking at the effect of global warming on northern green turtle breeding, in particular the effect of producing more male turtles owing to the higher temperatures. They are working in the area around Raine Island, Heron Island and Moulter Cay. Genetics The genome of Chelonia mydas was sequenced in 2013 to examine the development and evolution of the turtle body plan.

Synchrolift transfer platform, October 2007 By 1943 Tandanor had more than 6,000 specialised workers. The increased demand of engineers resulted in the creation of the career of Naval Engineering, established by the University of Buenos Aires in 1950, as well as several training programs were also established. During those times the ARA Libertad frigate was constructed as a school ship of the Navy. In 1973 the Navy sent personnel of TARENA (another shipyard) to work at Tandanor, also giving it new facilities. By those times the company had eight docks and needed to expand its business due to the increasing activity at the Atlantic Ocean. Five years later, Pearlson Engineering of Miami, US, was commissioned to built a elevator \\"Syncrolift\\". Tandanor was privatised in 1991 as part of the economy politics of then president Carlos Menem.

The conflict pitted the Time Lords against the Daleks and culminated in the apparent mutual destruction of both races, caused by the Doctor. In the Doctor Who continuity, the war occurs between the events of the 1996 film and the 2005 revived series. It was frequently mentioned and alluded to from the first series of the show's return, but was not directly seen until the show's 50th anniversary special. The war's events and progression have never been fully explained. Short comments in various episodes act as hints, but the war was not explicitly discussed until the 2007 episode \\"The Sound of Drums\\"; part two of the two-part special \\"The End of Time\\" (2009‚Äì2010) provided further information and revealed the Time Lord leaders' sinister endgame. The closing battles and the climax of the Time War were finally depicted in the 50th anniversary special \\"The Day of the Doctor\\" which ultimately revealed the Time Lords' fate. The Last Great Time War =Origins= The Last Great Time War pitted the Time Lords of Gallifrey against the Daleks of Skaro. The specific incident that sparked the conflict remains unclear, but according to executive producer Russell T Davies, the origins dated back to conflicts between the Doctor and the Daleks. In Genesis of the Daleks (1975), the Time Lords‚Äîhaving foreseen the possibility of the Daleks conquering the universe‚Äîsend the Fourth Doctor into the past in an attempt to avert the Daleks' creation, affect their development to make them less aggressive, or discover an inherent weakness they could exploit... In retaliation for this ultimately unsuccessful mission, the Daleks attempt to infiltrate the High Council of the Time Lords with duplicates of the Fifth Doctor in Resurrection of the Daleks (1984), followed by an open declaration of hostilities by one of the Dalek Emperors in Remembrance of the Daleks (1988). Two specific events led up to the outbreak of the war: a peace treaty was attempted by President Romana under the \\"Act of Master Restitution\\". This attempt was followed by the \\"Etra Prime Incident\\" (The Apocalypse Element), which some say \\"began the escalation of events\\". Weapons used by the Time Lords included Bowships, Black Hole Carriers and N-Forms (the last from Davies' 1996 New Adventures novel Damaged Goods), while the Daleks wielded \\"the full might of the Deathsmiths of Goth\\" (from the comic strip story Black Legacy by Alan Moore and David Lloyd), and launched a massive fleet led by the Emperor into the vortex. =Progression= The 'duration' and extent of the War remains unclear. The statement made by Jack Harkness in \\"The Parting of the Ways\\" ‚Äì confirmed by the Doctor ‚Äì that the Daleks \\"vanished out of time and space\\" to fight the War would indicate that it was not waged in normal space-time. Nonetheless, there was fighting on the planet Gallifrey. At some point, however, the conflict engulfed a sufficient bulk of the cosmos for Cass, a character from \\"The Night of the Doctor\\", to declare that the Daleks and Time Lords had not yet succeeded in their efforts to destroy it - some of it was \\"still standing\\". Several races hostile to the Time Lords, e.g. the Sontarans, wished to participate but were forbidden to do so. The Doctor claims to have fought on the front lines and was present at the Fall of Arcadia. Arcadia was Gallifrey's second city fortified with four hundred \\"sky trenches\\". These were thought to be impregnable until an invading Dalek squadron swept them away (as seen in the 2013 mini-episode \\"The Last Day\\"). The 2013 mini-episode \\"The Night of the Doctor\\" reveals that at first the Doctor (at this point the Eighth Doctor) refused to take part in the war, even as it spiralled out of control and threatened to destroy the universe, instead working to help where he could but refusing to fight. This led him to attempt to save a woman from a spaceship crashing towards the planet Karn, who refused his aid because he was a Time Lord (as she claimed she couldn't \\"tell the difference\\" between the two species any more, implying that the Time Lords were just as destructive as the Daleks). The Doctor was killed in the crash, but was restored to life temporarily by the Sisterhood of Karn, who finally convinced him that for the sake of the universe, he had to take a stand and fight. They further offered an elixir that would control his regeneration and allow him to take a form best suited for the task. The Doctor accepted, remarking that there was no need for a Doctor in a universe consumed by war and requested that the Sisterhood make him a \\"warrior\\". He drank the elixir and regenerated into the War Doctor, declaring himself \\"Doctor no more.\\" Davros, the creator of the Daleks, also fought during the war after his creations (which had turned against him during Genesis of the Daleks but caused his revival in Destiny of the Daleks) rehabilitated him to a leadership position. In the first year of the War, Davros' command ship was seemingly destroyed at the Gates of Elysium after flying into the jaws of the Nightmare Child. Unbeknownst to the Doctor, who had tried to save him, Davros was rescued by Dalek Caan, who had escaped the events of \\"Evolution of the Daleks\\" (2007) via an emergency temporal shift. The war resulted in countless millions dying endless deaths, as time travel was used by both sides to reverse battles that caused massive fatalities on both sides. These excesses of temporal warfare eventually led to the whole of the conflict becoming \\"time-locked\\", so that no time traveller could go back into it. The Doctor described the final days of the war as \\"hell\\", featuring \\"the Skaro Degradations, the Horde of Travesties, the Nightmare Child, the Could-Have-Been King with his army of Meanwhiles and Never-Weres\\". As the war progressed, the Time Lords became increasingly aggressive and unscrupulous. Growing in desperation, they accessed a cache of forbidden doomsday weapons fashioned by the ancients of Gallifrey known as the Omega Arsenal. All were wielded against the Dalek menace save one: \\"the Moment\\". Moreover, they resurrected the Master, a renegade Time Lord and nemesis to the Doctor, as they believed him to be the \\"perfect warrior for a time war\\". However, after the Dalek Emperor gained control of the Cruciform, the Master deserted his post, used the chameleon arch to disguise himself as a human and escaped to a time period shortly before the end of the universe. Genetically a human, he escaped the destruction of all Time Lords as well as detection by the Doctor ‚Äì who was unaware of his resurrection in the first place. The Master also remained ignorant of the latter phase and outcome of the war until he emerged from hiding, when he was told by the Doctor many years later. Leadership among the Time Lords remained vague during the earlier phase of the war. Ultimately, Rassilon, founder of the Time Lord society and its time travel technology who had discovered the secret of immortality, returned to assume leadership as Lord President, a position he was first to hold. Refusing the possibility of his civilisation being destroyed by the Daleks, Rassilon prepared a doomsday scenario, the so-called \\"Ultimate Sanction\\". This genocidal scheme included sacrificing all of time itself, thereby destroying the Daleks and all life in the universe. The Time Lords themselves would have transcended into a non- corporeal collective consciousness that would be the only sentient form of life in existence. The Time Lords, apparently hardened by the horrors of war, gave near-unanimous support for this plan ‚Äì only two Time Lords dissented when the issue was put to a full vote. Prior to the vote, when one of the Council, the Partisan, suggested shelving the Ultimate Sanction and that it may be better if Gallifrey were destroyed, Rassilon disintegrated her. While the High Council continued to lead Time Lord society during the war, a separate War Council was tasked with overseeing the war itself, as well as Gallifrey's defences. The War Council was led by an unknown Time Lord general. During the last days of the Time War, the War Council apparently became disillusioned with the High Council. =Conclusion= On the last day of the Time War, the Dalek fleets surrounding Gallifrey launched what was said to be their biggest attack ever on the planet. The ten million Dalek ships subjected Gallifrey to a massive orbital bombardment and deployed numerous Daleks to invade the surface. Dalek forces captured the city of Arcadia, then laid siege to the capital itself. However, they were unable to break through the capital's sky trenches. Upon learning of Rassilon's \\"Ultimate Sanction\\", the War Doctor stole an ancient Gallifreyan weapon known as the Moment, or the Galaxy Eater, and intended to reduce Gallifrey into \\"rocks and dust\\" with the inferno wiping out the Dalek fleet. By this point, the entire period of war had become \\"time locked\\", so that no time traveller could enter or exit it. Fearing that the Doctor would use the Moment, Rassilon and his fellow councillors attempted to escape the Lock by retroactively planting a four-note drumbeat (the rhythm of a Time Lord's heartbeats) into the Master's brain as a child and cause his descent into madness. From there, once the signal is made tangible enough, a Whitepoint Star, a diamond only found on Gallifrey, is used to create a link between the final day of the Time War and Earth so the Master could release Gallifrey from the Time Lock. The plan ultimately failed, as the Doctor destroyed the diamond link and the Master apparently sacrificed his life to take revenge on Rassilon, sending the Time Lords back to their apparent doom. Unknown to almost everyone involved however, this was not the final end of the Time Lords. As \\"the Moment\\" had a will of its own, it showed the War Doctor an alternative solution and ultimately enabled thirteen incarnations of the Doctor, ranging from the First Doctor through the Twelfth Doctor, to gather to save Gallifrey by freezing it in time and removing it from the universe. The sudden disappearance of Gallifrey left the Daleks firing upon and subsequently annihilating themselves, while the Time Lords remained, albeit powerless and forgotten. As the War Doctor regenerated into the Ninth Doctor, his memory of him and his other incarnations saving Gallifrey was wiped as a means for his timeline to correct itself, leaving the Doctor with the belief he had in fact used the Moment to destroy Gallifrey, the Time Lords, and the Daleks. The Doctor was haunted with the false knowledge of his home planet's demise, with even some of his enemies like the Beast using that guilt against him. The Doctor's later incarnations even displayed a self-loathing towards their War Doctor incarnation before the Eleventh Doctor and Tenth Doctor learned the truth and accepted him as a legitimate Doctor incarnation. Though the destruction of both races marked the end of the war, the Ninth Doctor learns of the Dalek Emperor's survival with Rose wiping out both him and his fleet in \\"The Parting of the Ways\\" as Bad Wolf while proclaiming the final end of the War. This is affirmed by the Tenth Doctor, who describes to Jack Harkness in \\"Utopia\\" that his resurrection by Rose was part of the final act of the War. Consequences =Removal of the Time Lords= Following what was for all intents and purposes the removal of the Time Lords, the Doctor believed himself to be the last of his race. The removal of the Time Lords also had a profound impact on time travel. In the 2006 episode \\"Rise of the Cybermen\\" when the Tenth Doctor, Rose Tyler and Mickey Smith are trapped in an alternative reality, the Doctor explains that, when the Time Lords were around, travel between parallel universes was less difficult but, with their demise, the paths between worlds are now closed. The Time Lords could also prevent or repair paradoxes such as the one created by Rose in an attempt to save her father's life in a traffic accident. After the Time Lords' disappearance, such a paradox summons the Reapers, who descended to \\"sterilise the wound\\" in time by devouring everything in sight, and are only stopped by Pete Tyler killing himself. Because of the Time Lock, along with the danger of creating a paradox, the Doctor is prevented from going back in time and saving the Time Lords. The Tenth Doctor warns another character against trying to alter his own timeline as such meddling would \\"destroy two-thirds of the universe\\" and resists an offer by Krillitane Mr Finch, using the Skasis Paradigm, which would have given the Doctor the ability to reorder the universe and allowed him to stop the war. The Doctor would only change his decision and assure his race's survival after contributing to it as the Eleventh Doctor during the events of \\"The Day of the Doctor\\". Throughout series 5, the Eleventh Doctor encounters cracks in \\"the skin of the universe\\". The Doctor learns that the cracks, which erase those they consume from history, are a result of the Silence causing the Doctor's TARDIS to explode on 26 June 2010. During the events of \\"The Big Bang\\", the Doctor manages to close all the cracks using the TARDIS explosion and the Pandorica to produce a second Big Bang that restores the universe. During the events of \\"The Time of the Doctor\\", the Doctor discovers one remaining crack on the planet Trenzalore, through which the Time Lords transmit a \\"truth field\\" that ensures that all inhabitants speak the truth, along with the First Question: \\"Doctor Who?\\". The intention is for the Doctor to give his true name, which will verify to the Time Lords it is safe for them to return to the universe. Fleets of various races, some being former War participants, gathered in Trenzalore's orbit to either prevent the Doctor from speaking his name, or resume the War if the Time Lords return. The Church of the Papal Mainframe undergoes a faith change into the Church of the Silence as a dedication to keeping the peace, with a rogue chapter led by Madame Kovarian unknowingly causing the events in series 5 and 6 and leading to the Doctor's arrival on Trenzalore. In the end, the Time Lords remain in exile and close the remaining crack, but not before heeding Clara's plea for them to save the Doctor, old and weary from his years protecting Trenzalore, granting him a new cycle of regenerations, which allow him to destroy the Dalek fleet surrounding the planet. =Remnants of the Daleks= Despite the Doctor's efforts, not all Daleks perished in the war. The Ninth Doctor encounters a single, dysfunctional Dalek in a museum on Earth in 2012, which had apparently been on Earth for 50 years. It eventually commits suicide after gaining human feelings via Rose Tyler touching it. The Doctor later discovers that the Dalek Emperor itself had also survived, and had gone on to build a whole new Dalek race, using the organic material of human cadavers by completely rewriting their DNA. The destruction of the Emperor and its fleet in the year 200,100 during an attack on Earth at the conclusion of the 2005 series by a time vortex-augmented Rose Tyler is accompanied by her declaration that \\"the Time War ends\\". The elite Cult of Skaro also survived by fleeing into the Void between dimensions in a specialised ship, taking with them the Genesis Ark, a Time Lord prison ship containing millions of Daleks. The new Dalek army released from the Ark on Earth in the 21st century ‚Äì after the Ark is touched by a time-traveler, Mickey Smith ‚Äì is sucked back into the Void due to the actions of the Tenth Doctor, but the specially-equipped cult members use an \\"emergency temporal shift\\" to escape that fate. They reappear in 1930 in New York where they try to use humans to create a new race of Daleks. While three members of the Cult of Skaro are killed, the fourth ‚Äì Dalek Caan ‚Äì escapes through another emergency temporal shift. Dalek Caan returns to the Time War and, at the cost of its sanity, rescues the Daleks' creator, Davros. Davros subsequently uses cells from his own body to create a new Dalek Empire and keeps Caan close at his side because of the latter's prophetic abilities. The Daleks attempt to destroy all reality with a 'Reality Bomb' powered by 27 stolen Worlds, leaving themselves the only creatures. However, Caan manipulated Davros to help the Doctor and Donna Noble defeat the Daleks after seeing the damage the Daleks had caused throughout time. The Daleks are destroyed by a clone of the Tenth Doctor, while Davros and Caan are left behind on the Dalek flagship as it is destroyed. One ship containing three Daleks escaped that defeat after accidentally falling through time, where it then picked up a trace of a Progenitor device that contained pure Dalek DNA. However, because these Daleks had been created from the DNA of Davros, the Progenitor did not accept them as true \\"Daleks\\"; to restart the Progenitor, the Daleks trick the Eleventh Doctor into activating it for them during World War II by declaring them Daleks (which the device accepts). Once activated, the Progenitor device created a new \\"Paradigm\\" of Daleks that destroyed the previous Daleks and escaped through time, forming a new race of Daleks. Eventually learning of the Time Lords' survival alongside various other races during the events of \\"The Time of the Doctor\\", the Daleks laid siege on the planet Trenzalore for centuries to either resume the Time War or kill the Doctor before he could release the Time Lords back into the universe. In the end, the Dalek fleet was wiped out by the Eleventh Doctor during the first phase of his regeneration. =Survival of the Master= After the Time War, the Doctor is convinced that he is the only surviving Time Lord, saying that he would know of any others if they had survived. The last words of the Face of Boe were \\"You Are Not Alone\\". The cryptic statement is explained when the Doctor encounters a man named Professor Yana who is revealed to be the Master. The Master had been hiding in human form at the end of the universe using a Chameleon Arch, having escaped the destruction of both the Time Lords and the Daleks. By taking human form, he avoided detection by the Doctor, who was apparently unaware of his nemesis' resurrection during the Time War. (Later spin-off stories reveal that the Doctor and the Master had fought together during the War for a time, but the Doctor was simply unaware that the Master had escaped death in the War itself.) =Impact on other species= The timelines of other races and planets shifted without the inhabitants of the worlds affected being aware of the changes in history, as they were a part of them. Most affected were the Greater Animus, which died; the Zygons, who lost their home planet, Zygor, and attempted to conquer Earth for its resources; the Eternals, who apparently fled this reality in despair; and the Gelth, who lost their physical form and were reduced to gaseous beings, who attempted to possess human corpses in 1869 using a Time Rift in Cardiff. The Gelth described the war's impact as \\"invisible to lower species but devastating to higher forms\\", such as the Forest of Cheem, which was distraught at the bloodshed. It is also said to have destroyed the unnamed race that Eve originated from. The Time War and continuity The Time War provides a convenient in-story explanation for any contradictions in series continuity: for example, writer Paul Cornell has suggested that Earth's destruction by an expanding sun in \\"The End of the World\\" five billion years hence, as opposed to the original depiction of its demise around the year 10,000,000 AD in The Ark (1966), can be attributed to changes in history due to the War. Steven Moffat, writer and later executive producer for Doctor Who, has gone further, arguing that \\"a television series which embraces both the ideas of parallel universes and the concept of changing time can't have a continuity error‚Äîit's impossible for Doctor Who to get it wrong, because we can just say 'he changed time‚Äîit's a time ripple from the Time War.Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Panel Part 5, Comic-Con International, San Diego 2008. Time Wars in spin-off media The Last Great Time War and previous time wars also feature in various Doctor Who spin-off media. =Eighth Doctor Adventures (The War (a separate previous time war))= In a story arc stretching through several of the Eighth Doctor Adventures novels (written before the new series began in 2005), the Doctor learns that, at some point in his personal future, a war will be fought between the Time Lords and an unnamed Enemy. The Eighth Doctor first becomes involved in the events of the war during the events of Alien Bodies, when he unintentionally learns of the War while attending an auction that is attended by various parties in the war- including a future Time Lord, a representative of the Enemy, Faction Paradox, the UNIT of the 2050s, and agents of the rogue Time Lords known as the Celestis-, not only learning about the War ahead of schedule, but also learning that the auction is for the body of his future self, due to his biodata codes being the only means of accessing dangerous Time Lord secrets after he died in the early days of the War. In the later novel The Taking of Planet 5, the Doctor must stop a group of future Time Lords from releasing the monstrous Fendahl in an attempt to use it as a weapon, which results in the destruction of the Celestis pocket dimension. Later in this story arc, Gallifrey is also destroyed as a result of the Eighth Doctor attempting to prevent the war from beginning as the Enemy begin their first assault in The Ancestor Cell, having learned that he unintentionally provoked the War after his history was changed by Faction Paradox, the Doctor believing that it would be better for the Time Lords to die now rather than experience a war that would dehumanise them to the point of becoming monsters which all evidence suggests they could not win. This cataclysm also creates an event horizon in time that prevents anyone from entering Gallifrey's relative past or travelling from it to the present or future. In the aftermath of this conflict Gallifrey was essentially erased from history, and the universe thrown in to chaos, allowing other species to try and take control of history, while also giving things like magic to exist in the universe, as in the main timeline the Time Lords had removed and erased such things form the universe near its beginning. The last Eighth Doctor Adventures novel, The Gallifrey Chronicles, establishes that the Doctor has the ability to restore the planet and its inhabitants, having downloaded the contents of the Matrix into his subconscious mind in the minutes before Gallifrey's destruction, albeit at the cost of his own memories. The novel ends without revealing if he does indeed succeed in restoring Gallifrey. However a vision the Doctor received of the future in a book not long before showed that Gallifrey would be restored to existence in the future. Russell T Davies, executive producer of the series, commented that there is no connection between the War of the books and the Time War of the television series, comparing Gallifrey being destroyed twice with Earth's two World Wars. He also said that he was \\"usually happy for old and new fans to invent the Complete History of the Doctor in their heads, completely free of the production team's hot and heavy hands\\". The future of the Time War which was erased by the Eighth Doctor in the Eighth Doctor Adventures' War, referred to as the \\"War in Heaven\\", also appears in the Faction Paradox novels conceived by Lawrence Miles (as well as some of the aftermath of its later erasure from history) . =Doctor Who comic strip= In three comic strip stories written by Alan Moore in 1980 and 1981, the Time Lords, assisted by the Special Executive, fight a time war early in their history against the \\"Order of the Black Sun\\", based some thirty thousand years in their future. The first strike of the war, from the Time Lords' point of view, is when a Black Sun agent travels back in time, and attacks the Time Lords just as they are about to turn the star Qqaba into a power source for their time experiments. This also causes the apparent demise of the stellar engineer Omega. The Time Lords do not know why the Black Sun (whom they had never encountered before the attack) should have wanted to strike at them, and surmise that it was for something they had yet to do. Years later, at a diplomatic conference, a representative of the Order is murdered by the Sontarans, and the murder is blamed on the Time Lords. This provides the motivation for the war's beginnings, as from the Order's point of view, the Time Lords are the ones who strike first. =Gallifrey audio series= Gallifrey is the umbrella title of a series of audio plays by Big Finish Productions, set on Gallifrey during Romana's tenure as President. In Gallifrey: Panacea, the final chapter of the third series, the Time Lord Irving Braxiatel speaks of \\"rumours out there in the big wide universe‚Äîmore than rumours, in fact‚Äîthat something's coming to Gallifrey, something worse than you could possibly imagine.\\" Because of these rumours, Braxiatel engineers the removal of the Time Lord biodata archive from Gallifrey, in order that the Time Lords might someday be restored after their planet meets its doom. Former Big Finish producer Gary Russell indicated in a forum posting on Outpost Gallifrey that this was a reference to the television series' Time War.Gary Russell, \\"Gallifrey 3.5: Panacea\\", Outpost Gallifrey (3 September 2006). Requires registration to view. The sixth series of Gallifrey features the Daleks invading Gallifrey, but this invasion was undone thanks to Romana, Leela, K9 and Narvin, aided by Romana's future self. The ninth series more directly featured the Time War with Romana and Leela playing key roles, including Leela being sent on a mission with the Derek Jacobi Master, Irving Braxiatel taking Ace on a mission to test her ability to fight in the War, and the resurrection of Rassilon through a complex Time Lord project that allowed Rassilon's consciousness to take over the body of another Time Lord. The later Companion Chronicles audio story, The Catalyst, implies that Leela survived the Time War; she mentions that her adopted homeworld no longer exists and she ages rapidly due to the Time Lords no longer being able to keep her young. =Dark Eyes= The Dark Eyes audio series is also in effect a lead up to the Last Great Time War from the Doctor's perspective, the first series being a complex plan by the Daleks to erase the Time Lords from existence. Dark Eyes 2 also sees the resurrection of the Master in preparation for the war. =Doom Coalition= The Doom Coalition series begins when the Eighth Doctor and his companion Liv Chenka are assigned to recapture the Eleven, a Time Lord criminal who suffers from a unique form of mental illness where all of his past incarnations are active in his head at once, the two swiftly acquiring a new companion in the form of Helen Sinclair. In the course of their travels, the Doctor, Liv and Helen learn that their hunt for the Eleven is being manipulated by the Doctor's former friend Padrac, who has become convinced that Gallifrey is destined to be destroyed in every future, and has thus masterminded a complex plan to destroy the rest of the universe to ensure Gallifrey's survival, with the Eleven's actions drawing the Doctor into positions where he will discover the equipment needed for Padrac's scheme to succeed. Although Padrac gathers his equipment and prepares to unleash a powerful psychic blast that will destroy the universe, the Doctor is eventually able to thwart this plan by disrupting Padrac's equipment at the last minute, informing his former friend that he will bear the burden of Gallifrey's future destruction if that prophecy is correct but refuses to believe that it is acceptable to destroy the rest of the universe to save one planet. =Ravenous= The Ravenous series depicts the aftermath of Doom Coalition as the Eighth Doctor and Liv search for the lost Helen and resume their travels while learning of the return of the Ravenous, a race of beings who essentially 'eat' regeneration energy. In the audio Deeptime Frontier the Doctor, Liv and Helen discover a Time Lord experiment to acquire new sources of power if the Eye of Harmony should be lost, foreshadowing how the Doctor's TARDIS will develop such independence after Gallifrey's destruction. The series finale, Day of the Master, features the War Master (Derek Jacobi) assisting his past and future selves in acquiring the Matrix print of Artron, an ancient Time Lord scientist who found means of extending a Time Lord's regeneration cycle, with the Masters using this to restore their own ability to regenerate, setting up the existence of the Master witnessed in Dark Eyes; the War Master all-but-explicitly states that he has made a deal with the Time Lords to save himself with this knowledge, albeit only to give himself a new cycle of standard regenerations. =Doctor Who Adventures= In this comic book series an insectoid race called the Skrawn appeared, whose planet Kolox the Doctor claims was destroyed in the Time War. =Doctor Who Magazine= The Doctor Who Magazine comic storyline The Clockwise Man, which was set during the Twelfth Doctor's era, included a flashback to the Time War and early in the life of the War Doctor, depicting the events that led to the apparent death of the Doctor's old friend Fey Truscott-Sade and the War Doctor's decision to renounce his name. =The Forgotten= In the IDW comic miniseries The Forgotten, the Tenth Doctor recounts to Martha Jones a story from the Eighth Doctor's participation in the Time War. The Eighth Doctor was imprisoned by a race of robots for several weeks on a planet in the middle of the war, before teaming up with a Malmooth fellow prisoner and faking his death to escape. It is revealed his capture was staged by him so that he could acquire the Great Key he needed to arm a modified De-Mat Gun that could be used to seal the Medusa Cascade. The Tenth Doctor further implies that the Eighth Doctor died, alone and companionless, at the end of the Time War. This conflicts with \\"The Night of the Doctor\\" and \\"The Day of the Doctor\\"'s depiction of the Time War, where it's established that the Eighth Doctor died and regenerated into the War Doctor before becoming the Ninth Doctor, and the Eighth Doctor refused to fight in the War until shortly before his regeneration into the War Doctor. =The Sarah Jane Adventures= In The Mad Woman in the Attic, a two-part serial of the Doctor Who spinoff series The Sarah Jane Adventures, Eve speaks about the Time War, stating that her people could see timelines; this made them a target, and they were exterminated. =Engines of War= In July 2014, the BBC released the novel Engines of War by George Mann, which features the War Doctor in a novel set in the Time War itself. During the novel, the War Doctor and his new companion Cinder‚Äîa human resistance fighter on the Dalek-occupied world of Moldox‚Äîdiscover that the Daleks intend to use the temporal anomalies of the Tantalus Eye, a rift in time in the Moldox system, to develop a weapon that could completely erase Gallifrey and the Time Lords from history, with Rassilon's plan to stop the Dalek plot involving the destruction of the Eye and all inhabited planets around it. Refusing to accept this, the Doctor is able to sabotage Rassilon's plan and use the energy of the Tantalus Eye to erase the Daleks' scheme, but the actions of a Time Lord agent result in Cinder's death, leaving the War Doctor resolved to end the war once and for all as he recognises how far his people have fallen in the name of victory. =The War Doctor audio series= The War Doctor series was produced by Big Finish Productions following John Hurt's role as the War Doctor in ‚ÄúThe Day of the Doctor‚Äù. Hurt reprised his role alongside Jacqueline Pearce as Cardinal Ollistra, who frequently sends the War Doctor on missions to give the Time Lords the upper hand over the Daleks. Following Hurt's death, the series ended after four volumes in February 2017. A follow-up series was subsequently launched featuring the Eighth Doctor and set during the early years of the Time War. =The Eighth Doctor: The Time War audio series= With the announcement of The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions also announced a prequel box set featuring the Eighth Doctor during the early days of the conflict. This was later expanded into a four-volume series set prior to his regeneration in \\"The Night of the Doctor\\" but after Ravenous, the sequel to Doom Coalition. Paul McGann will reprise his role with Rakhee Thakrar playing Bliss, his new companion. The third volume also features the return of the Valeyard, who is recruited by the Time Lords attempt to be a soldier in the War after he is 'recreated' through an accident when the Doctor uses a transmat while carrying a device that can manipulate biology.https://www.bigfinish.com/releases/v/doctor-who-the-time-war-3-1675 Eighth Doctor in the Time War in spin-off series As well as the Time War series itself, the Eighth Doctor has also been depicted taking a role in the Time War in various audios that are part of other series. The Classic Doctors, New Monsters audios; \\"The Sontaran Ordeal\\" sees him caught up in a Sontaran invasion of a planet that has just been 'contaminated' by the Time War so that its once-peaceful history now features centuries of conflict, and \\"Day of the Vashta Nerada\\" has the Doctor discover an experiment to artificially alter the Vashta Nerada to be used as weapons in the War. The Short Trip audios \\"A Heart on Both Sides\\" by Rob Nisbet and \\"All Hands on Deck\\" by Eddie Robson also explore the Doctor's role in the War; \\"Heart on Both Sides\\" sees the Eighth Doctor working as the assistant to his former companion Nyssa, operating under an alias, to protect her from a rumour he heard in the future about the destruction of a ship matching the description of Nyssa's hospital ship, and \\"All Hands on Deck\\" sees Susan, the Doctor's granddaughter, joining the Time War and leaving her life on Earth despite the Doctor's pleas for her to join his role as conscientious objector. In The Diary of River Song: Series One- The Rulers of the Universe, the Doctor learns that an ancient race of world-builders have been drawn into the future by the Time War and are destroying planets whose civilisations do not meet their standards, working with his future wife River Song (who communicates with him over a distorted radio to prevent him recognizing her) to disable their planned bomb at galactic centre. In The Legacy of Time audio \\"Lies in Ruins\\" the Doctor encounters River and his predecessor's companion Benny Summerfield while he is travelling with a woman called Ria, as the two archaeologists discover what appears to be a fragment of Gallifrey, but it is soon revealed that the 'fragment' of Gallifrey is actually part of a prototype TARDIS while Ria is an android the Doctor created to tell him that he was right as he tried to escape the War, with the events of the audio forcing him to acknowledge that he can't ignore the conflict even if he still refuses to fight in it. =The War Master audio series= The War Master series was announced in June 2017 for release in December. The release features Derek Jacobi reprising his role as The Master from the 2007 episode \\"Utopia\\" and follows the character during the Time War. In the course of these audios, the Master is shown seeking new sources of power for himself, but after he proves unable to control the power of the Heavenly Paradigm, which causes both sides in the Time War to win conflicts they previously lost, the series ends with the Master fleeing in fear to the distant future, setting up his future existence as 'Professor Yana'. =Doctor Who and the Time War= Penned by Russell T. Davies for the Doctor Who Magazine before the 50th Anniversary, the short story set before 'Rose' depicts a different account of the Time War's outcome, with the Eighth Doctor using the Moment to destroy the Time Lords and Daleks alike and end the Last Great Time War once and for all. Before collapsing into his TARDIS and regenerating into the Ninth Doctor. = Future = Doctor Who Magazine revealed that Big Finish will produce another Time War range.

After the lion had killed it, the fox stole and ate the deer's heart. When asked where it is, the fox reasoned that an animal so foolish as to visit a lion in his den cannot have had one, an argument that reflects the ancient belief that the heart was the seat of thoughts and intellect. The story is catalogued as type 52 in the Aarne-Thompson classification system.Hasan M. El- Shamy, Types of the Folktale in the Arab World: A Demographically Oriented Tale-type Index, Indiana University 2004, pp.19-20 The story from the East The fox reports to the lion, from a 15th-century Persian translation of the Panchatantra The version of the story found in the Indian Panchatantra concerns a lion who is persuaded that the cure for his sickness is the ears and heart of an ass. His servant the jackal persuades an ass to accompany him but the lion is too weak to kill the ass on the first attempt and the jackal has to trick it into returning. Afterwards the jackal persuades the hungry lion to leave him with the dead ass and takes the ears and heart for himself. His explanation for their absence is that so silly an animal cannot have had the equipment to hear or to think with.Panchatantra, trans. Arthur W. Ryder, \\"Flop-Ear and Dusty\\" The story travelled westwards through a series of translations and adaptations and was eventually carried to Spain by invading Arabs. By this time the details of the story had altered considerably. In one Arab version an ass demands toll of the lion and is killed for this effrontery. The heart is eaten by a fox who says it could never have existed in so stupid an animal.Histoire √©conomique et sociale de l'Empire ottoman et de la Turquie (1326-1960), Leuven 1995, p.256 There also exist Jewish versions of the story, in one of which the ass figures as toll-keeper and in the other demands a fare on board ship.Israel Abrahams, The Book of Delight and Other Papers, ‚ÄúThe Fox‚Äôs Heart‚Äù The story from the West The story of \\"The Lion, the Fox and the Deer\\" is an ancient one that first appeared in the poetry of Archilochus and was told at great length in the collection of Babrius. In this the fox twice persuades the deer to visit the lair of a lion too sick to hunt, on the first occasion escaping with an injured ear; the fox explains this as a rough caress and the deer returns to its death.F.R.Adrados History of the Graeco-Latin Fable vol.3, Leiden NL 2003, vol.3, p.438 It was only recorded in Greek, so that Mediaeval European variants may equally be of Eastern rather than Western origin. Thus in Marie de France's telling, the lion requires the deer's heart as a cure for its illness, as in the Panchatantra.The fables of Marie de France, Birmingham AL 1988, pp.181-3 The very different version in her contemporary, Berechiah ha-Nakdan's \\"Fox Fables\\", appears to owe something to a Latin poem by Avianus, numbered 583 in the Perry Index. In this a boar has its ears cut off as a punishment for roaming in the fields of an estate and later pays for it with his life. A thieving peasant explains the missing heart to his master in the usual way.F.R.Adrados History of the Graeco-Latin Fable vol.3, Leiden NL 2003, p.559 But in Berechiah's telling the wild boar trespasses in the royal lion's garden and, after losing its ears and eyes in punishment, is finally killed and the heart is stolen by the fox.Fables of a Jewish Aesop, Jaffrey NH 03452 2001 story 105 These final details demonstrate a synthesis with other versions of the fable, of which there appear to be many by this time.S.Thompson, Motif-index of folk-literature, K402.3 A still later Spanish version by Juan Ruiz, involves a musical ass who keeps the lion awake with his discordant music and in this case loses his heart and ears to the wolf.Louise Mirrer, Women, Jews, and Muslims in the texts of reconquest Castile, University of Michigan 1996, p.134 The process of transformation continues into modern times. In Stuart Croft's 12-minute film The Stag without a Heart (2009/10), the story is recounted at length in an endlessly circuitous version by having the fox replace the heart it has stolen in the deer as a means of persuading it to return to the lion's presence.Version online References Category:Aesop's Fables Category:Fables Category:Fictional deer and moose Category:Foxes in literature Category:Lions in popular culture ","title":"The Deer without a Heart"},{"id":"2150523","text":"The A312 Uxbridge road marked with double red lines The term red route has been separately adopted for two entirely different highway purposes within the United Kingdom.

The prohibition extends to stopping for loading or unloading, and to boarding or alighting from a vehicle (except for licensed taxis and the holders of blue badges). Red routes are mainly used on major bus and commuting routes. Red routes are marked by red lines on the sides of the road. Double red lines mean that the rules and regulations apply at all times and on all days. Single red lines means that the prohibition applies during times displayed on nearby signs or at the entry to the zone. Red route clearways are signed but there are no lines on the road. Stopping is only permitted in lay- bys (red lines are only marked at junctions). The 580 km of red routes in London are policed by \\"Red Route Patrols\\" and managed by London Streets, an arm of Transport for London. A similar scheme operates in Edinburgh; here, however, the routes affected (where marked by the use of green road-surfacing rather than red lines - usually on outer bus lanes on major bus routes) are known as \\"Greenways\\". Away from bus routes, conventional red lines are used. A number of hospitals in the United Kingdom have mimicked the red road lines, in and around ambulance dispatch and Accident and Emergency areas. These road markings are to allow ambulances and other emergency vehicles uninhibited access in and out of such areas; whilst these road markings are often respected by road users there is very little (if any) enforcement. Accident reduction In Somerset, the local road safety partnership has designated some of the A roads within the county as Red Routes, but in this case the term is used to indicate routes that have a higher than average accident rate. The term is similarly used to denote dangerous routes in Northamptonshire. It is not clear that the scheme will be maintained following the closure of the Road Safety Partnership whose initiative it was. Lincolnshire has a scheme similar to the Northamptonshire one. The county of Cheshire, and therefore the town of Warrington also use the idea of Red Routes to designate roads with historically high accident rates. The former Suffolk speed camera organisation chose the expression Red Route to denote routes where high levels of accidents justify the frequency use of mobile speed cameras. Leicestershire County Council has chosen not to implement a Red Route scheme, believing it can be misleading and arbitrary. It believes in identifying or solving individual danger spots instead.

Success came late in the competition for Orphanidis, as he placed second in his penultimate event, the rapid fire pistol. He scored 249 points on 20 hits in the event, finishing behind Ioannis Frangoudis. In the free rifle, Orphanidis defeated Frangoudis and the rest of the marksmen to win an Olympic championship. His score of 1,583 was bolstered by a second-string score of 520 in which he hit the target with all 10 shots. The results for the first, third, and fourth strings were 328, 420, and 315 points, respectively.

Background  Zlata Filipovic was born on 3 December 1980.Zlata chat , mv.com; accessed 7 March 2016. She lived in Sarajevo before the Bosnian war started. During the war, Zlata kept a diary from 1991 to 1993. Like Anne Frank, she also gave a name to her diary, Mimmy. Zlata and her family survived the war and escaped to Paris in 1993, where they stayed for a year. The family has settled down in Dublin, Ireland. This girl mentions in her diary that there was multiple gunshots next to her house.  Plot  In September 1991, Zlata was given a diary. She immediately began to write in her diary. Zlata Filipoviƒá wrote her diary from 1991 to 1993 during the Bosnian war. Located mostly in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia. Zlata began writing her diary in 1991, just after she began fifth grade. The war began just before her eleventh birthday. Zlata's diary chronicles her daily life and the war's increasing impact on her home town of Sarajevo. Reporter Janine di Giovanni, who met Zlata in 1993 and wrote the introduction to the book, described Zlata as \\"the Anne Frank of Sarajevo.\\" Like The Diary of Anne Frank, Zlata's diary contains many descriptions of the horrors of war as viewed from the innocent view of a child. Furthermore, both diaries take place during conflicts at least partially motivated by racism and ethnic differences.  Publication  In 1992, a small press in Sarajevo published Zlata's diary and released it for the UNICEF week. Following the release of her diary, Zlata became moderately famous. International journalists visited the Filipoviƒá family's apartment and interviewed Zlata. In December 1993, the United Nations helped Zlata and her mother move to Paris. Her diary has also been adapted into a choral work by Anthony Powers. Reception Critical reception of the book was positive. In The New York Times Review of Books, Francine Prose praised the 'pure innocence and desperation' evident within Zlata's pages, characterizing her as an everygirl. However, Prose was critical of Western publishers looking to cash in by equating Zlata's story with that of Anne Frank, lamenting the indecency of 'contrasting and judging the private writings of children in war'.

Early life He was born in Enniscorthy, County Wexford.\\"Stephen Hayes dies at 71\\", Irish Independent, 30 December 1974. During the Irish War of Independence, he was commandant of the Wexford Brigade of Fianna √âireann. He took the Anti-Treaty side during the Irish Civil War, during which he was interned. Hayes was active in Gaelic Athletic Association circles in Wexford. In 1925, he helped Wexford win the Leinster Senior Football title. He also served as secretary to the county board for ten years, from the 1920s to 1930s. IRA activities Hayes joined the IRA and was on the IRA Army Council in January 1939 when it declared war on the British government.McCaughey's DoomThe IRA's all-time low When IRA chief of staff Se√°n Russell departed on IRA business to the United States (and subsequently to Nazi Germany), Hayes became IRA chief of staff. His time in office was marred by controversy and it is widely believed that he served as an informer to the Garda S√≠och√°na. Hayes had sent a plan for the invasion of Northern Ireland by German troops to Germany in April 1940. This plan later became known as Plan Kathleen. He is also known to have met with German agent Hermann G√∂rtz on 21 May 1940 in Dublin shortly after the latter's parachuting into Ireland on 5 May 1940 as part of Operation Mainau. Hayes is known to have asked G√∂rtz for money and arms to wage a campaign in Northern Ireland, although shortly after this meeting the original Plan Kathleen was discovered. The discovery of the plan led to the acceleration of joint British and Irish military planning for a German invasion known as Plan W. Another meeting on 15 August 1940 on Rathgar Road, Dublin organised by Hayes and attended by senior IRA men Paddy McGrath, Tom Harte and Tom Hunt, was also raided by the Garda S√≠och√°na. McGrath and Harte were both arrested and tried by Military Tribunal, established under the Emergency Powers Act 1939. They challenged the legislation in the High Court, seeking a writ of habeas corpus, and ultimately appealed to the Supreme Court. They were represented in the courts by Se√°n MacBride. The appeal was unsuccessful, and they were executed by firing squad at Dublin's Mountjoy Prison on 6 September 1940.High Court and Supreme Court Re: McGrath and Harte [1941] Irish Reports 68 Irish Executions On 30 June 1941, Northern-based IRA men kidnapped Hayes, accusing him of being a spy. By his own account, he was tortured and \\"court-martialled\\" for \\"treason\\" by his comrades, and would have been executed, but he bought himself time composing an enormously long confession. He managed to escape in September 1941, and handed himself in to the Garda for protection. The Officer Commanding (O/C) of the IRA's Northern Command, Se√°n McCaughey, was convicted on 18 September 1941 of the kidnapping. After a long hunger and thirst strike in Portlaoise prison, McCaughey died on 11 May 1946. Hayes was later sentenced to five years' imprisonment by the Special Criminal Court on account of his IRA activities. Within IRA circles, Hayes is still considered a traitor and an informer. One of the main allegations against him was that he informed the Garda S√≠och√°na about IRA arms dumps in Wexford. However, this was later blamed on a Wexford man named Michael Deveraux, an officer of the Wexford Battalion of the IRA who was subsequently abducted and executed by an IRA squad in County Tipperary on Hayes‚Äô orders. George Plant, a Protestant IRA veteran, was later executed in Portlaoise for Devereux's murder. Later life After his release, Hayes resumed his clerical position at Wexford County Council.

Biography  Fessler was born in the village of Zurndorf in the Hungarian Moson County. In 1773, he joined the order of Capuchin friars, and in 1779 was ordained priest. He had meanwhile continued his classical and philological studies, and his liberal views brought him into frequent conflict with his superiors. In 1784, while at the monastery of M√∂dling, near Vienna, he wrote to the emperor Joseph II, making suggestions for the better education of the clergy and drawing his attention to the irregularities of the monasteries. The searching investigation which followed raised up against him many implacable enemies. In 1784 he was appointed professor of Oriental languages and hermeneutics in the university of Lemberg, when he took the degree of doctor of divinity; and shortly afterwards he was released from his monastic vows on the intervention of the emperor. In 1788 he brought out his tragedy of Sidney, an expos√© of the tyranny of James II and of the fanaticism of the Roman Catholics in England. This was attacked so violently as profane and revolutionary that he was compelled to resign his office and seek refuge in Silesia. In Breslau he met with a cordial reception from G. W. Komn, the publisher, and was, moreover, subsequently employed by the prince of Carolath-Schbnaich as tutor to his sons. In 1791 Fessler was converted to Lutheranism and next year contracted an unhappy marriage, which was dissolved in 1802, when he married again. In 1796 he went to Berlin, where he founded a humanitarian society. In April 1800, through his introduction, the philosopher Johann Gottlieb Fichte was initiated into freemasonry in a Berlin lodge. Fessler was commissioned by the freemasons to assist Fichte in reforming the statutes and ritual of their lodge. At first Fichte was the warm admirer of Fessler, and was disposed to aid Fessler in his proposed reform. But later he became Fessler's bitter opponent. Their controversy attracted much attention among freemasons. Soon after this, Fessler obtained a government appointment in connection with the newly acquired Polish provinces, but in consequence of the battle of Jena (1806) he lost this office, and remained in very needy circumstances until 1809, when he was summoned to St. Petersburg by Alexander I, to fill the post of court councillor, the professorship of oriental languages and philosophy at the Alexander-Nevski Academy, and finally minister to the Court of St. James (Britain). This office, however, he was soon obliged to resign, owing to his alleged atheistic tendencies, but he was subsequently nominated a member of the legislative commission by the Emperor. In 1815 he went with his family to Sarepta, where he joined the Moravian community and again became strongly orthodox. This cost him the loss of his salary, but it was restored to him upon his return in 1817. In November 1820, he was appointed consistorial president of the evangelical communities at Saratov and subsequently became chief superintendent of the Lutheran communities in St. Petersburg. In recognition of his important services to Hungary as a historian, he was in 1831 elected a corresponding member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. He died at St. Petersburg. Writings Fessler was a voluminous writer, and during his life exercised great influence; but, with the possible exception of the history of Hungary, none of his books has any value now. He did not pretend to any critical treatment of his materials, and most of his historical works are practically historical novels. He did much, however, to make the study of history popular. His works are all written in German. His most important works are: * Die Geschichten der Ungarn und ihrer Landsassen (10 vols., Leipzig, 1815-1825) * Marcus Aurelius (3 vols., Breslau, 1790‚Äì1792; 3rd edition, 4 vols., 1799) * Aristides und Themistokles (2 vols., Berlin, 1792; 3rd edition, 1818) * Attila, K√∂nig der Hunnen (Breslau, 1794) * Matthias Corvinus (2 vols., Breslau, 1793-1794) * Die drei grossen K√∂nige der Hungarn aus dem √Årp√°d-Arpadischen Stamme (Breslau, 1808) * R√ºckblick auf meine Siebzigj√§hrige Pilgerschaft (2nd ed., Leipzig 1851) Notes  References  ;Attribution * Category:1756 births Category:1839 deaths Category:People from Neusiedl am See District Category:Hungarian Lutheran clergy Category:18th-century Hungarian people Category:19th-century Hungarian people Category:Converts to Lutheranism from Roman Catholicism Category:Capuchins Category:Hungarian historians Category:Members of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences Category:Imperial Russian politicians Category:Hungarian expatriates in Russia Category:Russian Freemasons ","title":"Ignaz Aurelius Fessler"},{"id":"2150580","text":"Ioannis Theofilakis (Theophilakis) (, 1879‚Äì1968) was a Greek shooter who competed at five Olympic games, and the 1906 Intercalated Games.

Selected in the third group of NASA astronauts in 1963, he was killed a year later in the crash of a T-38 jet, marking the first fatality among the NASA Astronaut Corps. At the time of his death, he held the rank of captain. Early years Born in Haverford, Pennsylvania, on February 18, 1930, Freeman was named after the man who raised his father (Theodore Cullen Donovan), as well as his maternal grandfather (Thomas Cordy Wilson). He was one of five children. Raised in Lewes, Delaware, he attended Lewes Elementary School from 1936 to 1944. His father was a farmer and his brother a carpenter, and it seemed as if he would also have a blue collar career. When Freeman and his brother were young, they saved up money so they could take plane rides. He also was a part-time worker, helping to refuel the planes and work on them. He spent most of his money on flying lessons, and with over 450 hours of flying on his training record, earned his pilot's license by the age of 16. \\"I sort of grew up at the airport,\\" Freeman said. Freeman played baseball and football in high school. While playing football, he was hit hard and his teeth were knocked out of alignment. He was the president of the school's student and the local chapter of the National Honor Society; he graduated as an honors student ranked third in his class in 1948. He was a Boy Scout and he earned the rank of First Class. Education During his senior year of high school, Freeman completed the application to the U.S. Naval Academy. He passed the scholarship portion but failed the medical portion due to his crooked teeth. He was told if he straightened them out he would be accepted the next year. During that year, Freeman attended the University of Delaware at Newark to further his education. He also made some money by spotting schools of fish for local fishermen. Freeman had an operation to fix his teeth, which included grinding his teeth down, then wore braces for several months to finish the effort. He was admitted to the U.S. Naval Academy Class of 1953 on June 17, 1949. Freeman graduated from Annapolis in 1953 with a Bachelor of Science degree. In 1960, he received a Master of Science degree in aeronautical engineering from the University of Michigan. Military and NASA career The Fourteen astronauts Freeman elected to enter the U.S. Air Force and took flight training at Hondo Air Force Base and Bryan Air Force Base, Texas and at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada. He was awarded his pilot wings in February 1955, shortly after being promoted to first lieutenant, then served in the Pacific and at George Air Force Base, California. He was promoted to captain in June 1960 while pursuing his master's degree at the University of Michigan and then went to Edwards Air Force Base, California, in February 1960 as an aerospace engineer. Freeman graduated from both the Air Force's Experimental Test Pilot School (Class 62A) and Aerospace Research Pilot School (Class IV) courses. He elected to serve with the Air Force. His last Air Force assignment was as a flight test aeronautical engineer and experimental flight test instructor at the ARPS at Edwards AFB in the Mojave Desert. Freeman served primarily in performance flight testing and stability testing areas; he logged more than 3,300 hours flying time, including more than 2,400 hours in jet aircraft. Freeman was one of the third group of astronauts selected by NASA in October 1963 and was assigned the responsibility of aiding the development of boosters. Death Goose wings lie alongside fragments of Freeman's T-38 canopy. On the morning of October 31, 1964, after a delay caused by fog, Freeman piloted a T-38A Talon from St. Louis to Houston. He was returning from McDonnell training facilities in St. Louis and crashed during final approach to landing at Ellington Air Force Base in Houston. There were reports of geese due to the fog, one of which flew into the port-side air intake of his NASA-modified T-38 jet trainer, causing the engine to flame out. Flying shards of Plexiglas entered the jet engine during the crash. Freeman attempted to land on the runway, but realized he was too short and might hit military housing. He banked away from the runway and ejected. The jet had nosed down a considerable amount, and he ejected nearly horizontally. Freeman's parachute did not deploy in time, and he died upon impact with the ground. His skull was fractured and he had severe chest injuries. Personal life Freeman was survived by his wife Faith Clark Freeman and one daughter, Faith Huntington. Faith Freeman first heard of her husband's death when a reporter came to her house: NASA subsequently ensured that in the case of future astronaut deaths, their families were informed by other astronauts as quickly as possible. He was buried with full military honors in Arlington National Cemetery. Five astronauts were pallbearers at the funeral. Honors Freeman Public Library in Clear Lake City Freeman on the alt=Space Mirror Memorial for Theodore Freeman, Space Shuttle Challenger The Clear Lake City-County Freeman Branch Library of the Harris County Public Library and Houston Public Library systems is named in memory of Freeman. An artificial island off Long Beach is also named for him. This is one of the four \\"Astronaut Islands\\" built in Long Beach Harbor during the late 1960s as unsinkable platforms for oil drilling; the others were named Grissom, White and Chaffee, in honor of the astronauts killed in the Apollo 1 fire. A crater on the far side of the Moon was temporarily named Freeman crater by the Apollo 8 crew. The Theodore C. Freeman Highway in Lewes, Delaware, an approach road to the Cape May‚ÄìLewes Ferry which carries U.S. Route 9, was named after him by a resolution of the Delaware Senate on December 21, 1965.

Early lige and education Forchhammer was born at Husum, Schleswig. He studied at the universities of Kiel and Copenhagen from 1815 to 1818. Career Forchhammer then joined Hans Christian √òrsted and Lauritz Esmarch in their mineralogical exploration of Bornholm, and took a considerable share in the labors of the expedition. In 1820 he obtained his doctoral degree by a chemical treatise De mangano, and immediately after set out on a journey through England, Scotland and the Faroe Islands. In 1823 he was appointed lecturer at Copenhagen University on chemistry and mineralogy; in 1829 he obtained a similar post in the newly established polytechnic school; and in 1831 he was appointed professor of mineralogy in the university, and in 1848 became curator of the geological museum. From 1835 to 1837 he made many contributions to the geological survey of Denmark. On the death of Hans Christian √òrsted in 1851, he succeeded him as director of the polytechnic school and secretary of the Academy of Sciences. In 1850 he began with Japetus Steenstrup and Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae various anthropological publications which gained a high reputation. As a public instructor Forchhammer held a high place and contributed potently to the progress of his favorite studies in his native country. He interested himself in such practical questions as the introduction of gas into Copenhagen, the establishment of the fire-brigade at Rosenborghttp://runeberg.org/dbl/5/0255.html and the boring of artesian wells. In 1865, Johan Georg Forchhammer conjectured that the ratio of major salts in samples of seawater from various locations was constant. This constant ratio is known as Forchhammer's Principle, or the Principle of Constant Proportions. Forchhhammer's theory was proven correct in 1884 by Prof William Dittmar following extensive analysis of sea-water samples taken during the Challenger expedition.http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2830901185.html Among his more important works are L√¶rebog i. de enkelte Radicalers Chemi (1842); Danmarks geognostiske Forhold (1835); Om de Bornholmske Kulformationer (1836); Dit myere Kridt i Danmark (1847); Bidrag til Skildringer af Danmarks geographiske Forhold i deres Afh√¶ngighed af Landets indre geognostiske Bygning (1858). A list of his contributions to scientific periodicals, Danish, English and German, will be found in the Catalogue of Scientific Papers published by the Royal Society of London. One of the most interesting and most recent is \\"On the Constitution of Sea Water at Different Depths and in Different Latitudes\\", in the Proceedings of the Roy. Soc. xii. (1862-1863). He was a Commander of the Order of the Dannebrog, and was a member of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters from 1825. In 1863, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. He died at Copenhagen. He was the brother of August Friedrich Wilhelm Forchhammer, father of Johannes Nicolai Georg Forchhammer, and grandfather of Johannes Georg Forchhammer. Personal life Louise Christiane Fugl Forchhammer married twice. He married Louise Christiane Fugl (1804‚Äì1831)m a daughter of kancellir√•d U. N. Fugl (1768 ‚Äì 1817), in 1826. She died in 1831 and he then married her half-sister Emilie Mariane Fugl (1815 ‚Äì 1882). They lived in the Professor's House at N√∏rregade 8-10 in Copenahgen from 1833 and until his death in 1865. Forchhammer's son Johannes Forchhammer (20 Narcg 1827 - 18 July 1908), the only child from his first marriage, was a linguist and headmaster of Aalborg Cathedral School and Herlufsholm.

He competed at the 1896 Summer Olympics and the 1906 Intercalated Games in Athens.  Life  His family had lived in Greece since the 1830s, where his father, Charles William Louis Merlin, was British Consul at Piraeus. His mother, Isabella (n√©e Green) was an important figure in the British community in Athens. He was the Ionian Bank's agent at Piraeus/Athens from March 1853, and subsequently became, from autumn 1865 the bank's general inspector in Greece while continuing to be its agent at Athens and, from May 1890, a director in London of the bank. Sidney was born in Piraeus, and married Zaira Theotokis, the daughter of the Corfiot Prime Minister Georgios Theotokis. He later divorced her and married Katia, a Greek by birth whose aristocratic family had lived in Russia before the revolution. Edwin, their only child, served in the Royal Air Force in England during the Second World War. The Merlins were large landowners in Corfu, Crete, Lamia and Attica. In the 1896 Olympics, Merlin competed in four of the five events. In the military rifle, he placed tenth with 1,156 points. His first (of four) string of 10 shots resulted in a score of 477. His score and place in the free rifle are unknown, but he did not win a medal. After two out of the five strings of 6 shots in the military pistol event, Merlin quit the competition. Similarly, he did not finish the rapid fire pistol event. He also participated in the men's trap shooting at the 1900 Paris Games, where he came joint seventh with five other athletes. At the 1906 Games, he participated in all shooting events, coming first and third in the men's trap, double shot and single shot. As the Germans approached Athens during World War II, Sidney Merlin and his second wife, Katia, moved to the Merlin estate on Crete, a large mansion dating back to Venetian times. The mansion, known as Bella Capina (Pelakpaina in some spellings) also provided a residence for King George II, and meeting rooms for the Greek War Cabinet and government for several months. This ended abruptly when the German aerial invasion of the island began. The King and Prime Minister, having been warned in advance, left the day before the invasion. This is historically interesting, as it is one of the very few occasions when information from Bletchley Park, where German intelligence was decoded by the British, was given to non-British individuals. Sidney and Katia remained, with the task of keeping the house running as if the King were still in residence. When the German advance was within shooting distance, Sidney, Katia and a small entourage of other British household members, fled on foot, making an arduous crossing of the island to the southern village of Sphakia, where they were rescued by the British destroyer, HMS Napier, and taken to Alexandria, Egypt. In Greece, Sidney Merlin is best known for two botanological achievements. In ca. 1925, he introduced the \\"Washington Navel\\" orange variety to his estate in Corfu. To this day, it is known in Greece as \\"Merlin\\". He also introduced the kumquat tree, which is used in Corfu to make the kumquat sweet, one of the specialties of Corfiot cuisine, and the Butter of Corfu (ŒíŒøœçœÑœÖœÅŒø ŒöŒ≠œÅŒ∫œÖœÅŒ±œÇ).

The theory held that control over cotton exports would make a proposed independent Confederacy economically prosperous, would ruin the textile industry of New England, and‚Äîmost importantly‚Äîwould force the United Kingdom and perhaps France to support the Confederacy militarily because their industrial economies depended on Southern cotton. The slogan, widely believed throughout the South, helped in mobilizing support for secession: by February 1861, the seven states whose economies were based on cotton plantations had all seceded and formed the Confederacy. Meanwhile, the other eight slave states, with little or no cotton production, remained in the Union. To demonstrate the alleged power of King Cotton, Southern cotton merchants spontaneously refused to ship out their cotton in early 1861; it was not a government decision. By summer 1861, the Union Navy blockaded every major Confederate port and shut down over 95% of exports. Since the British mills had large stockpiles of cotton, they suffered no immediate injury from the embargo; indeed the value of their stockpiles soared. However, the British did not react to King Cotton, and they never intervened. For Britain to have intervened would have meant war with the U.S. and a cut-off of British food supplies: About one-fourth of Britain's food supplies came from the United States, and American warships could destroy much of British commerce while the Royal Navy was convoying ships full of cotton. On the other hand, Britain had already abolished slavery, and the public would not have tolerated the government militarily supporting a sovereignty upholding the ideals of slavery.Frank Lawrence Owsley. King Cotton Diplomacy: Foreign relations of the Confederate States of America (1931). Consequently, it proved a failure for the Confederacy, as the strategy did not succeed in making the new Confederate polity economically prosperous. The blockade prevented the earning of desperately needed gold. Most importantly, the false belief led to unrealistic assumptions that the war would be won through European intervention if only the Confederacy held out long enough. History The American South is known for its long, hot summers, and rich soils in river valleys, making it an ideal location for growing cotton. The many southern seaports and riverside docks allowed shipping cotton to remote destinations. By 1860, Southern plantations supplied 75% of the world's cotton, with shipments from Houston, New Orleans, Charleston, Mobile, Savannah, and a few other ports. The insatiable European demand for cotton was a result of the Industrial Revolution which created the machinery and factories to process raw cotton into clothing that was better and cheaper than a handmade product. European and New England purchases soared from 720,000 bales in 1830 to 2.85 million bales in 1850, to nearly 5 million in 1860. Cotton production renewed demand for slavery after the tobacco market had declined in the late 18th century. The more cotton was grown, the more slaves were needed to harvest the crops. By 1860, on the eve of the American Civil War, cotton accounted for almost 60% of American exports, representing a total value of nearly $200 million a year. Cotton's central place in the national economy and its international importance led Senator James Henry Hammond of South Carolina to make a famous boast in 1858: Confederate leaders had made little effort to ascertain the views of European industrialists or diplomats until the Confederacy sent diplomats James Mason and John Slidell in November 1861. That led to a diplomatic blowup in the Trent Affair.Ephraim Douglass Adams, Great Britain and the American Civil War (1924) online ch 7 British position When war broke out, the Confederate people, acting spontaneously without government direction, held their cotton at home, watching prices soar and an economic crisis hit Britain and New England, causing a backlash with British public opinion. Even if Britain did intervene, it would mean war with the United States, as well as loss of the American market, loss of American grain supplies, risk to Canada, and much of the British merchant marine, all in the slim promise of getting more cotton.Eli Ginzberg. \\"The Economics of British Neutrality during the American Civil War\\". Agricultural History. Vol. 10, No. 4 (Oct. 1936), pp. 147‚Äì156 in JSTOR Besides that, in the spring of 1861, warehouses in Europe were bulging with surplus cotton, which later soared in price. So the cotton interests made their profits without a war.Charles M. Hubbard, The Burden of Confederate Diplomacy (1998) The Union imposed a naval blockade, closing all Confederate ports to normal traffic; consequently, the South was unable to move 95% of its cotton. Yet, some cotton was slipped out by blockade runners, or through Mexico. Cotton diplomacy, advocated by the Confederate diplomats James M. Mason and John Slidell, completely failed because the Confederacy could not deliver its cotton, and the British economy was robust enough to absorb a depression in textiles from 1862‚Äì64. As Union armies moved into cotton regions of the South in 1862, the U.S. acquired all the cotton available, and sent it to Northern textile mills or sold it to Europe. Meanwhile, cotton production increased in India by 70% and also increased in Egypt. Between 1860 and 1870, Brazilian annual cotton exports rose 400%, from 12,000 to 60,000 tonnes. Economics When war broke out, the Confederates refused to allow the export of cotton to Europe. The idea was that this cotton diplomacy would force Europe to intervene. However, European states did not intervene, and following Abraham Lincoln's decision to impose a Union blockade, the South was unable to market its millions of bales of cotton. The production of cotton increased in other parts of the world, such as India and Egypt, to meet the demand, and new profits in cotton were among the motives of the Russian conquest of Central Asia. A British-owned newspaper, The Standard of Buenos Aires, in cooperation with the Manchester Cotton Supply Association succeeded in encouraging Argentinian farmers to greatly increase production of cotton in Argentina and export it to the United Kingdom. Surdam (1998) asks, \\"Did the world demand for American-grown raw cotton fall during the 1860s, even though total demand for cotton increased?\\" Previous researchers have asserted that the South faced stagnating or falling demand for its cotton. Surdam's more complete model of the world market for cotton, combined with additional data, shows that the reduction in the supply of American-grown cotton induced by the Civil War distorts previous estimates of the state of demand for cotton. In the absence of the drastic disruption in the supply of American-grown cotton, the world demand for such cotton would have remained strong. Stanley Lebergott (1983) shows the South blundered during the war because it clung too long to faith in King Cotton. Because the South's long-range goal was a world monopoly of cotton, it devoted valuable land and slave labor to growing cotton instead of urgently needed foodstuffs. In the end, \\"King Cotton\\" proved to be a delusion that misled the Confederacy into a hopeless war that it ended up losing.

The game was released by Ubisoft in Europe on May 16, and then in the United States and Canada on May 24, 2006, with the publisher guiding Russian studio Nival Interactive in its development. Following the closure of The 3DO Company, Ubisoft bought the rights to the Might and Magic franchise, and used Heroes V as a means to reboot the series with a brand-new setting, called Ashan, and no continuity to previous titles. Like the other games in the series, players take control of \\"heroes\\" (leaders with magical abilities) who provide their services for a faction, recruiting an army from settlement strongholds, such as castles, out of various forces (humanoid, undead, monsters, and so forth) and then doing battle against roaming armies, enemy heroes and rival factions. The game features a campaign series that covers six factions from Ashan, along with stand-alone and multiplayer scenarios. Unlike the preceding games in the series, which used 2D computer graphics but with some isometric touches, Heroes V was the first to be completely 3D.  Gameplay  Map view of a bastioned bridge across a river. A hero can learn a new skill, upgrade an existing one, gain a new ability or create combos of multiple abilities upon gaining a new level or visiting special buildings on the adventure map. There are two sets of skills available to heroes: racial skills and regular skills. A hero can have up to five regular skills and always has the proper racial skill. Skills are divided into four levels: Basic, Advanced, Expert, and Ultimate. Each skill is associated with three to five abilities, depending on the race of the hero. Each level of skill gives the hero a chance to learn one ability under the skill. That is, a hero with Basic level of a skill can learn one ability, Advanced level two, and Expert level three. An ability is not immediately learned when the hero increases the corresponding skill level. The racial skill that a hero learns is dependent on their native faction. All heroes from a faction learn the same racial skill and racial abilities. Each racial skill culminates in an 'ultimate ability' that can only be gained by learning a very specific set of regular skills and abilities. In addition to the three levels of skills that apply to regular skills, the racial skill can reach an ultimate level when a certain artifact is worn by the hero. View of the Sylvan town. During the game, the camera flies through the 3D environment. There are six factions in the game: Haven, Inferno, Necropolis, Dungeon, Sylvan and Academy. Additionally, the game's expansion packs added the Fortress and Stronghold alignments. ; Haven: Haven is a faction populated by humans and ruled by religious warlords; the Holy Griffin Empire propagates \\"Law and Order\\" and faith in Elrath, the Dragon of Light. Arising from their military tradition, they have the ability to train their soldiers, promoting them from one level to another. They are the primary protagonists of the game's campaign missions. Their main Heroes are young Queen Isabel and faithful Godric, the king's uncle and the top general for the Griffin Empire. ; Inferno: A dark kingdom of demons from the underworld known as Sheogh, the Inferno is a faction which uses \\"Gating\\", a method used to summon additional, though temporary, reinforcements onto the battlefield. Making their infernal abode on blasted lava terrain, the demons are the primary antagonists in the game, led by Urgash, the Dragon of Chaos, and their evil overlord, the Demon Sovereign Kha-Beleth. They are the protagonists of the second act of the campaign, where they are led by the ambitious and ruthless Agrael. ; Necropolis: Once a secret cult flourishing within the dark underside of the Empire and the Silver Cities, the Necropolis faction resides in Heresh and is ruled by corrupted wizards who worship a twisted spider version of Asha, the Dragon of Order, seeking to find everlasting peace and beauty in death that has been denied to them in life. They can use the dark magic of necromancy to re-animate slain enemies and fill their own ranks with shambling corpses. The Hero for the Necropolis campaign is the shrewd and cunning Markal. ; Dungeon: Hailing from the underground empire of Ygg-Chall, the dark elves Dungeon faction are a group of fallen elves whose society is built around faith in Malassa, the Dragon of Darkness, secrecy, plots, and betrayal. They were once part of the Sylvan faction, but became renegades when they made a pact with the mysterious Faceless (in fact they are falsely accused of Brittiga's burning and the king Arniel's death, and they had to turn to Malassa for their survival). They mastered the ability of Irresistible Magic, which made their spells so powerful that even those who had the strongest resistance to magic have little chance to resist. The hero for the dark elf campaign is Raelag, a mysterious and ambitious warlock. ; Sylvan: The old Rampart faction from HoMM III in spirit, the Sylvan faction is more distinctly Elvish this time around, residing in the Elven kingdom Irollan which is said to be blessed by Sylanna, the Dragon of Earth. Their heroes focus on archery, and so do their creatures, who can finish off their enemies without touching them. Their racial skill gives entire armies bonuses when fighting certain enemies they have slain previously. They are the counterpart to the Dungeon. The hero for the Sylvan Campaign is Findan, a diplomat and a determined fighter. ; Academy: The Academy faction is a town dominated by wizards and magical creatures since its debut in the second game of the series. Not much has changed besides its location, moving away from the snowy mountains of the Tower City in Heroes of Might and Magic III to a vibrant desert scene closer to the original Wizard castle, now filled with middle-eastern dresses. Most of its heroes focus on magic, and their army comprises mostly shooters and flyers. Their Dragon is Sar-Elam, also known as the Seventh Dragon and the very first wizard who had so much power he became a Dragon and helped to banish the malicious Urgash, the Dragon of Chaos. The hero for the Academy Campaign is the young and brash Zehir, the son of the late Arch-mage Cyrus and the new Arch-mage of the Silver Cities.  Development  In August 2003, Ubisoft acquired the rights to the Might and Magic franchise for USD$1.3 millionNamco, Ubisoft and MS carve up 3DO assets after 3DO filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Ubisoft announced their plan to develop the fifth game in the series under the direction of producer Fabrice Cambounet. This news caused controversy as New World Computing under 3DO had already started making the fifth Heroes game. Although Ubisoft gained access to NWC's progress on Heroes V (which envisioned it as an isometric 2D game in the Heroes IV engine), it was decided to start over and create a completely new 3D game.  Expansions  The first Heroes V expansion pack, called Hammers of Fate, was released on November 17, 2006 in Europe and November 24, 2006 in North America. It includes a new race, the Dwarves, who have exclusive access to a new kind of magic, known as Rune Magic. Other features include the much-awaited random map generator and the return of the Heroes IV caravans. This expansion pack requires the full version of Heroes of Might and Magic V to play. The stand-alone second expansion pack is called HOMMV: The Tribes of the East and was released on October 12, 2007 in Europe and on October 19, 2007 in North America. Tribes of the East includes the new Stronghold faction, alternate upgrades for all units currently in the game (bringing the total number of creatures to 177), as well as new artifacts and spells.  Reception  The critical reaction to the retail version of Heroes V has been generally favourable, with an average review score of roughly 77/100 on Metacritic. Heroes of Might and Magic V was a commercial success. Its sales surpassed 350,000 copies by the end of June 2006, and it reached #1 on sales charts in Germany, France and the United Kingdom.  Sequel  On August 17, 2010, a trailer for Might & Magic Heroes VI was released on GameTrailers. The release date was announced as September 8, 2011, but was changed to October 13, 2011.

Life Born at Misilmeri, Chinnici graduated in law at the University of Palermo in 1947 and started working as a magistrate in 1952 in Trapani. In 1966 he moved to the prosecutors office in Palermo. In November 1979, he became head of the Examining Office at the Palermo Court, following the murder of his predecessor, Cesare Terranova, by the Mafia.Stille, Excellent Cadavers, p. 81 At the time the prosecution was separated in an examining phase (the so-called instruction phase) and a prosecuting phase. Chinnici created the Antimafia Pool, a group of investigating magistrates who closely worked together sharing information to diffuse responsibility and to prevent one person from becoming the sole institutional memory and solitary target.

He was instrumental in reviving investigations into the Mafia and understood the need to bridge the gap between the judiciary and the rest of Sicilian society to create a counterculture against the Mafia and break down omert√†, the law of silence that kept the Mafia alive. He frequently spoke out against the Mafia in public appearances and schools at a time when judges had avoided the word for many years. Assassination On 29 July 1983 a car bomb explosion in Palermo killed Chinnici, two of his bodyguards, Mario Trapassi and Salvatore Bartolotta, and the concierge of his apartment block, Filippo Li Sacchi, as he left the house to go to work. The bomb was triggered by the notorious Mafia assassin Pino Greco, on the orders of his uncle Michele Greco.

With Dylan not expected to release any new material for an extended period of time, CBS Records president Clive Davis proposed issuing a double LP compilation of older material. Dylan agreed, compiling it himself and suggesting that the package include a full side of unreleased tracks from his archives. After submitting a set of excerpts from The Basement Tapes that Davis found unsatisfactory, Dylan returned to the studio in September 1971 to recut several Basement songs, with Happy Traum providing backup. The final package included one previously uncollected single, \\"Watching the River Flow\\", an outtake from the same sessions, \\"When I Paint My Masterpiece\\"; one song from Dylan's April 12, 1963 Town Hall concert, \\"Tomorrow Is a Long Time\\", and three songs from the September sessions, \\"I Shall Be Released\\", \\"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere\\", and \\"Down in the Flood\\". The remaining tracks were drawn from existing releases. In 2003, this album was released along with Dylan's two other Greatest Hits compilations in one four-disc set, as Greatest Hits Volumes I‚ÄìIII. As with The Basement Tapes and the Beatles' 1962-1966, all the selections could fit on a single 80-minute CD, but were nevertheless released on two CDs to match the LP.  Artwork  The album package was designed to capitalize on the publicity surrounding George Harrison's Concert for Bangladesh, about to be released as a film and album. The photograph on the album cover is a cropped version of a photo taken during Dylan's performance at the concert by the film's still photographer, Barry Feinstein.The Concert for Bangladesh Revisited with George Harrison and Friends, 2005, DVD. The uncropped photo, which appeared as a two-page spread in the booklet included in the album Concert for Bangla Desh (sic), also contained George Harrison, who was standing to Dylan's right. The album cover is similar to the previous volume, Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits, which utilized Rowland Scherman's 1965 photo. Reaching #14 the US and #12 in the UK, Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Vol. II is now certified five times platinum in the US, making it one of Dylan's best- selling albums.  Songs previously unreleased on LP  \\"In one sense, 1971 and 1972 might both be considered 'lost' years,\\" writes Dylan biographer Clinton Heylin. Neither year would produce an album, at least not an album entirely composed of newly recorded material. Between March 16 and 19, 1971, Dylan reserved three days at Blue Rock Studios, a small studio in New York's Greenwich Village. According to Heylin, \\"These sessions were produced by Leon Russell of Mad Dogs and Englishmen fame. Only two originals were recorded‚Äî'Watching the River Flow' and 'When I Paint My Masterpiece'‚Äîbut both confronted the same subject matter, a continuing dearth of inspiration, in a refreshingly honest fashion.\\" \\"When I Paint My Masterpiece\\" was also recorded by The Band, who would release their version first on Cahoots. Dylan's recording from Blue Rock would only see release on Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Vol. II. \\"Watching the River Flow\\" was issued as a single in June 1971, backed by \\"Spanish Is the Loving Tongue\\", which had been recorded during the New Morning sessions. Months later, Dylan would agree to release a second \\"greatest hits\\" compilation, provided he could compile it himself, issue it as a double album, and include several older compositions which he had written but never issued himself. To accommodate this last condition, Dylan took it upon himself to hold a recording session at Columbia's Recording Studios in New York. On September 24, 1971, in Columbia's Studio B, Dylan recorded four songs with his friend, Happy Traum. \\"He felt there were some songs that he had written that had become hits of sorts for other people, that he didn't actually perform himself,\\" recalls Traum, \\"and he wanted to fit those on the record as well...So we just went in one afternoon and did it, it was just the two of us and the engineer, and it was very simple...we chose three [songs] on the spot and mixed them...in the space of an afternoon...Sometimes I wasn't even sure if it was a final take until we would just finish and Bob would say, 'Okay, let's go and mix it.'\\" \\"Crash On The Levee (Down In The Flood)\\", \\"You Ain't Going Nowhere\\" and \\"I Shall Be Released\\" were recorded and selected for the compilation. \\"Only a Hobo\\", an early composition dating back to 1963, was also considered for inclusion but ultimately was left unreleased until 2013's The Bootleg Series Vol. 10 ‚Äì Another Self Portrait (1969‚Äì1971). A few lyrical revisions were made on \\"You Ain't Going Nowhere\\", the most notable being a reference to Roger McGuinn. \\"Pack up your money, pull up your tent McGuinn, you ain't going nowhere\\". McGuinn's band, The Byrds, had successfully recorded \\"You Ain't Going Nowhere\\" on their landmark album, Sweetheart of the Rodeo, and they even issued their recording as a single. Country musician Marty Stuart has also recorded this song. According to McGuinn in the liner notes to the 1997 reissue of Sweetheart of the Rodeo, Dylan singled him out in these lyrics for bungling Dylan's original Basement Tapes lyrics on the Byrds version of the song in which McGuinn sings \\"Pack up your money / Pick up your tent\\" instead of \\"Pick up your money / Pack up your tent\\" as Dylan had.  Other notable releases recorded in 1971  In addition to the material added to Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Vol. II, Dylan recorded a single, \\"George Jackson.\\" An incarcerated black activist, George Jackson died on August 21, 1971. After reading a newspaper article about his death, Dylan quickly wrote an elegy for Jackson and rushed a small band into Blue Rock Studios to record it the following day. He recorded two versions, one following a simple acoustic arrangement, another with a full-band arrangement. Dylan also recorded another original composition, the country-flavored \\"Wallflower\\". Both versions of \\"George Jackson\\" were issued on the two sides of a single released on November 12, 1971. The single penetrated the Top 40, peaking at #33 on the Billboard Hot 100. The \\"Wallflower\\" recording was set aside and would later be released on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1-3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961-1991, but was recorded, with Dylan's backing vocal, for Doug Sahm's 1973 recording Doug Sahm and Band. Dylan gave three significant concert performances in 1971, which were professionally recorded and eventually released. The first two came on August 1, at Madison Square Garden for a benefit concert organized by George Harrison. Dylan was not scheduled to perform, but Harrison convinced him to make a surprise appearance. Dylan performed a set at both the afternoon and evening shows, backed by Harrison on lead guitar, Leon Russell on bass, and Ringo Starr on tambourine. A selection of his performances was issued on the Grammy-winning The Concert for Bangladesh, issued on December 20, 1971. The third and final performance actually came during the first hour of 1972, when he made a surprise appearance at The Band's New Year's Eve concert at New York's Academy of Music. Dylan appeared sometime after midnight and performed four songs backed by The Band: \\"Crash on the Levee (Down in the Flood)\\", \\"When I Paint My Masterpiece\\", \\"Don't Ya Tell Henry\\" and \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\". Clinton Heylin would later describe Dylan's appearance as \\"a return to some approximation of peak performing powers.\\" The concert was recorded by Phil Ramone and later mixed and compiled as The Band's Rock of Ages. However, Dylan's set would have to wait until May 2001 for official release, when it was included as part of an expanded, remastered CD edition of Rock of Ages. Track listing The UK edition has a different track list from that given below. \\"Positively 4th Street\\" replaces \\"She Belongs to Me\\" as the first track on disc two. (\\"Positively 4th Street\\" was missing from the 1967 UK Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits, where \\"She Belongs to Me\\" replaced it.) On side four, \\"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\\", which had also appeared on the 1967 UK Greatest Hits album as one of the two extra tracks, is replaced by \\"New Morning\\" as track 2.Searching for A Gem website =Side one= =Side two= =Side three= =Side four=  References   External links  * Category:1971 greatest hits albums Category:Albums produced by Bob Johnston Category:Albums produced by John Hammond (producer) Category:Albums produced by Tom Wilson (record producer) Category:Bob Dylan compilation albums Category:Columbia Records compilation albums Category:Albums produced by Leon Russell ","title":"Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Vol. II"},{"id":"2150641","text":"BS 2000 (also known as Beat Science 2000) was a musical group formed by Adam \\"Ad-Rock\\" Horovitz (member of Beastie Boys) and Amery \\"AWOL\\" Smith (drummer for Suicidal Tendencies and touring drummer for Beastie Boys) featuring Janay North.

Life and work  Le Neve Foster was born at Camberwell, the second son of Peter le Neve Foster (for many years secretary of the Society of Arts) and Georgiana Chevallier. After receiving his early education at Boulogne and Amiens, he studied successively at the Royal School of Mines in London and at the mining college of Freiburg in Saxony. In 1860 he joined the Geological Survey in England, working in the Wealden area and afterwards in Derbyshire. Conjointly with William Topley (1841‚Äì1894) he communicated to the Geological Society of London in 1865 the now classic paper On the superficial deposits of the Valley of the Medway, with remarks on the Denudation of the Weald. In this paper the sculpturing of the Wealden area by rain and rivers was ably advocated. Retiring from the Geological Survey in 1865, Foster devoted his attention to mineralogy and mining in Cornwall, Egypt and Venezuela, becoming a lecturer for the Miners Association and secretary of the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society. In 1872, he was appointed an inspector of mines under the home office for the southwest of England, and in 1880 he was transferred, at his own request, to the N. Wales district. In 1890, upon the death of Sir Warington Smyth, he was appointed professor of mining at the Royal College of Science and he held this post until the close of his life. His later work is embodied largely in the reports of mines and quarries issued annually by the home office. He was distinguished for his extensive scientific and practical knowledge of metalliferous mining and stone quarrying. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1892 and was knighted in 1903. From 1901‚Äì1902 he was President of the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall. While investigating the cause of a mining disaster at the Snaefell Mine, Isle of Man in 1897, his constitution suffered much injury from carbon monoxide gas, and he never fully recovered from the effects. He died in London, on 19 April 1904. He married Sophia Chevallier Tompson in 1872. They had three children: a son, Vivian, a schoolmaster at Eton College, and two daughters, Olga and Helen, both of whom married clergymen. He published Ore and Stone Mining, 1894 (ed. 5, 1904); and The Elements of Mining and Quarrying, 1903.

Augustan prose is somewhat ill-defined, as the definition of \\"Augustan\\" relies primarily upon changes in taste in poetry. However, the general time represented by Augustan literature saw a rise in prose writing as high literature. The essay, satire, and dialogue (in philosophy and religion) thrived in the age, and the English novel was truly begun as a serious art form. At the outset of the Augustan age, essays were still primarily imitative, novels were few and still dominated by the Romance, and prose was a rarely used format for satire, but, by the end of the period, the English essay was a fully formed periodical feature, novels surpassed drama as entertainment and as an outlet for serious authors, and prose was serving every conceivable function in public discourse. It is the age that most provides the transition from a court-centered and poetic literature to a more democratic, decentralized literary world of prose. The precondition of literacy Literacy rates in the early 18th century are difficult to estimate accurately. However, it appears that literacy was much higher than school enrollment would indicate and that literacy passed into the working classes, as well as the middle and upper classes (Thompson). The churches emphasized the need for every Christian to read the Bible, and instructions to landlords indicated that it was their duty to teach servants and workers how to read and to have the Bible read aloud to them. Furthermore, literacy does not appear to be confined to men, though rates of female literacy are very difficult to establish. Even where workers were not literate, however, some prose works enjoyed currency well beyond the literate, as works were read aloud to the illiterate. For those who were literate, circulating libraries in England began in the Augustan period. The first was probably at Bath in 1725, but they spread very rapidly. Libraries purchased sermon collections and books on manners, and they were open to all, but they were associated with female patronage and novel reading. Circulating libraries were a way for women, in particular, to satisfy their desire for books without facing the expense of purchase. Inasmuch as books were still regarded principally as tools for work, any book that existed merely for entertainment was subject to a charge of frivolity. Therefore, the sales of novels and light entertainments testify to a very strong demand for these books indeed. The essay/journalism Montesquieu's \\"essais\\" were available to English authors in the 18th century, both in French and in translation, and he exerted an influence on several later authors, both in terms of content and form, but the English essay developed independently from continental tradition. At the end of the Restoration, periodical literature began to be popular. These were combinations of news with reader's questions and commentary on the manners and news of the day. Since periodicals were inexpensive to produce, quick to read, and a viable way of influencing public opinion, their numbers increased dramatically after the success of The Athenian Mercury (flourished in the 1690s but published in book form in 1709). In the early years of the 18th century, most periodicals served as a way for a collection of friends to offer up a relatively consistent political point of view, and these periodicals were under the auspices of a bookseller. However, one periodical outsold and dominated all others and set out an entirely new philosophy for essay writing, and that was The Spectator, written by Joseph Addison and Richard Steele. By 1711, when The Spectator began, there was already a thriving industry of periodical literature in London, but The Spectator was far and away the most successful and significant periodical of the era. Each issue was a single, folio sheet of paper, printed front and back, sometimes with advertisements, and issues were not only read throughout London, but also were carried out to the countryside. Up to twenty years after publication stopped, people were counting collections of the issues among their inheritable goods. Addison's prose style was magisterial, placid, and with perfect balance of clauses. Steele's prose style was more direct than Addison's, and more worldly. The journal developed a number of pseudonymous characters, including \\"Mr. Spectator,\\" Roger de Coverley, and \\"Isaac Bickerstaff\\" (a character borrowed from Jonathan Swift ). Both authors developed fictions to surround their narrators. For example, Roger de Coverley came from Coverley Hall, had a family, liked hunting, and was a solid squire. The effect was something similar to a lighthearted serial novel, intermixed with meditations on follies and philosophical musings. The paper's politics were generally Whig, but never sharply or pedantically so, and thus a number of prominent Tories wrote \\"letters\\" to the paper (the letters were generally not actual letters but, instead, contributions from guest authors). The highly Latinate sentence structures and dispassionate view of the world (the pose of a spectator, rather than participant) was essential for the development of the English essay, as it set out a ground wherein Addison and Steele could comment and meditate upon manners and events, rather than campaign for specific policies or persons (as had been the case with previous, more political periodical literature) and without having to rely upon pure entertainment (as in the question and answer format found in The Athenian Mercury). Further, the pose of the Spectator allowed author and reader to meet as peers, rather than as philosopher and student (which was the case with Montesquieu). rabid animal. One of the cultural innovations of the late Restoration had been the coffee house and chocolate house, where patrons would gather to drink coffee or chocolate (which was a beverage like hot chocolate and was unsweetened). Each coffee shop in the City was associated with a particular type of patron. Puritan merchants favored Lloyd's, for example, and founded Lloyd's of London there. However, Button's and Will's coffee shops attracted writers, and Addison and Steele became the center of their own Kit-Kat Club and exerted a powerful influence over which authors rose or fell in reputation. (This would be satirized by Alexander Pope later, as Atticus acting as a petty tyrant to a \\"little senate\\" of sycophants.) Addison's essays, and to a lesser extent Steele's, helped set the critical framework for the time. Addison's essays on the imagination were highly influential as distillations and reformulations of aesthetic philosophy. Mr. Spectator would comment upon fashions, the vanity of women, the emptiness of conversation, and the folly of youth. After the success of The Spectator, more political periodicals of comment appeared, including the vaguely Tory The Guardian and The Observer (note that none of these periodicals continued to the present day without interruption). Edward Cave created the first general-interest magazine in 1731 with The Gentleman's Magazine. He was the first to use the term \\"magazine\\" on the analogy of a military storehouse of varied material. The Gentleman's Quarterly began soon after. Some of these journals featured news more than commentary, and others featured reviews of recent works of literature. Many periodicals came from the area of the Inns of Court, which had been associated with a bohemian lifestyle since the 1670s. Samuel Johnson's later The Rambler and The Idler would self- consciously recreate the pose of Mr. Spectator to give a platform for musings and philosophy, as well as literary criticism. However, the political factions (historian Louis B. Namier reminds us that officially there were no political parties in England at this time, even though those living in London referred to them quite often) and coalitions of politicians very quickly realized the power of the press, and they began funding newspapers to spread rumors. The Tory ministry of Robert Harley (1710‚Äì1714) reportedly spent over 50,000 pounds sterling on creating and bribing the press. Politicians wrote papers, wrote into papers, and supported papers, and it was well known that some of the periodicals, like Mist's Journal, were party mouthpieces. Philosophy and religious writing In contrast to the Restoration period, the Augustan period showed less literature of controversy. Compared to the extraordinary energy that produced Richard Baxter, George Fox, Gerrard Winstanley, and William Penn, the literature of dissenting religious in the first half of the 18th century was spent. One of the names usually associated with the novel is perhaps the most prominent in Puritan writing: Daniel Defoe. After the coronation of Anne, dissenter hopes of reversing the Restoration were at an ebb. Further, the Act of Settlement 1701 had removed one of their prime rallying points, for it was now somewhat sure that England would not become Roman Catholic. Therefore, dissenter literature moved from the offensive to the defensive, from revolutionary to conservative. Thus, Defoe's infamous volley in the struggle between high and low church came in the form of The Shortest Way with the Dissenters; Or, Proposals for the Establishment of the Church. The work is satirical, attacking all of the worries of Establishment figures over the challenges of dissenters. It is, therefore, an attack upon attackers and differs subtly from the literature of dissent found fifteen years earlier. For his efforts, Defoe was put in the pillory. He would continue his Puritan campaigning in his journalism and novels, but never again with public satire of this sort. Instead of wild battles of religious controversy, the early 18th century was a time of emergent, de facto latitudinarianism. The Hanoverian kings distanced themselves from church politics and polity and themselves favored low church positions. Anne took few clear positions on church matters. The most majestic work of the era, and the one most quoted and read, was William Law's A Serious Call to a Devout and Holy Life (1728) (see his online works, below). Although Law was a non-juror, his book was orthodox to all Protestants in England at the time and moved its readers to contemplate and practice their Christianity more devoutly. The Meditations of Robert Boyle remained popular as well. Both of these works called for revivalism, and they set the stage for the later development of Methodism and George Whitefield's sermon style. They were works for the individual, rather than for the community. They were non-public and concentrated on the priesthood of all believers notion of an individual revelation. Also in contrast to the Restoration, when philosophy in England was so fully dominated by John Locke that few other voices are remembered today, the 18th century had a vigorous competition among followers of Locke, and philosophical writing was strong. Bishop George Berkeley and David Hume are the best remembered major philosophers of 18th-century England, but other philosophers adapted the political ramifications of empiricism, including Bernard de Mandeville, Charles Davenant, and Adam Smith. All of these figures can be considered empiricists, for they all begin with the relative certainty of perception, but they reach vastly different conclusions. Bishop Berkeley extended Locke's emphasis on perception to argue that perception entirely solves the Cartesian problem of subjective and objective knowledge by saying \\"to be is to be perceived.\\" Only, Berkeley argued, those things that are perceived by a consciousness are real. If there is no perception of a thing, then that thing cannot exist. Further, it is not the potential of perception that lends existence, but the actuality of perception. When Samuel Johnson flippantly kicked a rock and \\"thus...refute(d) Berkeley,\\" his kick only affirmed Berkeley's position, for by perceiving the rock, Johnson had given it greater reality. However, Berkeley's empiricism was designed, at least partially, to lead to the question of who observes and perceives those things that are absent or undiscovered. For Berkeley, the persistence of matter rests in the fact that God is perceiving those things that humans are not, that a living and continually aware, attentive, and involved God is the only rational explanation for the existence of objective matter. In essence, then, Berkeley's skepticism leads inevitably to faith. David Hume David Hume, on the other hand, was the most radically empiricist philosopher of the period. He attacked surmise and unexamined premises wherever he found them, and his skepticism pointed out metaphysics in areas that other empiricists had assumed were material. Hume attacked the weakness of inductive logic and the apparently mystical assumptions behind key concepts such as energy and causality. (E.g. has anyone ever seen energy as energy? Are related events demonstrably causal instead of coincident?) Hume doggedly refused to enter into questions of his faith in the divine, but his assault on the logic and assumptions of theodicy and cosmogeny was devastating. He was an anti- apologist without ever agreeing to be atheist. Later philosophers have seen in Hume a basis for Utilitarianism and naturalism. Title page to the 1705 edition of Bernard de Mandeville's Fable of the Bees. In social and political philosophy, economics underlies much of the debate. Charles Davenant, writing as a radical Whig, was the first to propose a theoretical argument on trade and virtue with his A Discourse on Grants and Resumptions and Essays on the Balance of Power (1701). However, Davenant's work was not directly very influential. On the other hand, Bernard de Mandeville's The Fable of the Bees became a centerpoint of controversy regarding trade, morality, and social ethics. It was initially a short poem called The Grumbling Hive, or Knaves Turn'd Honest in 1705. However, in 1714 he published it with its current title, The Fable of the Bees: or, Private Vices, Public Benefits and included An Enquiry into the Origin of Moral Virtue. Mandeville argued that wastefulness, lust, pride, and all the other \\"private\\" vices (those applying to the person's mental state, rather than the person's public actions) were good for the society at large, for each led the individual to employ others, to spend freely, and to free capital to flow through the economy. William Law attacked the work, as did Bishop Berkeley (in the second dialogue of Alciphron in 1732). In 1729, when a new edition appeared, the book was prosecuted as a public nuisance. It was also denounced in the periodicals. John Brown attacked it in his Essay upon Shaftesbury's Characteristics (1751). It was reprinted again in 1755. Although there was a serious political and economic philosophy that derived from Mandeville's argument, it was initially written as a satire on the Duke of Marlborough's taking England to war for his personal enrichment. Mandeville's work is full of paradox and is meant, at least partially, to problematize what he saw as the naive philosophy of human progress and inherent virtue. =After 1750= Charcoal sketch of Adam Smith. Adam Smith is remembered by lay persons as the father of capitalism, but his Theory of Moral Sentiments of 1759 attempted to strike out a new ground for moral action. His emphasis on \\"sentiment\\" was in keeping with the era, as he emphasized the need for \\"sympathy\\" between individuals as the basis of fit action. The idea, first rudimentally presented in Locke's Essay on Human Understanding, of a natural coherence between sensible beings being necessary for communication not only of words, but of emotions and states of being, was here brought out more fully. While Francis Hutcheson had presupposed a separate sense in humans for morality (akin to conscience but more primitive and more native), Smith argued that moral sentiment is communicated, that it is spread by what might be better called empathy. These ideas had been satirized already by wits like Jonathan Swift (who insisted that readers of his A Tale of a Tub would be incapable of understanding it unless, like him, they were poor, hungry, had just had wine, and were located in a specific garret), but they were, through Smith and David Hartley, influential on the sentimental novel and even the nascent Methodist movement. If sympathetic sentiment communicated morality, would it not be possible to induce morality by providing sympathetic circumstances? Smith's greatest work was An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations in 1776. What it held in common with de Mandeville, Hume, and Locke was that it began by analytically examining the history of material exchange, without reflection on morality. Instead of deducing from the ideal to the real, it examined the real and tried to formulate inductive rules. However, unlike Charles Davenant and the other radical Whig authors (including Daniel Defoe), it also did not begin with a desired outcome and work backward to deduce policy. Smith instead worked from a strictly empiricist basis to create the conceptual framework for an analytical economics. The novel As has been indicated above, the ground for the novel had been laid by journalism. It had also been laid by drama and by satire. Long prose satires like Swift's Gulliver's Travels (1726) had a central character who goes through adventures and may (or may not) learn lessons. In fact, satires and philosophical works like Thomas More's Utopia (1516), Rabelais's Gargantua and Pantagruel (1532‚Äì64), and even Erasmus's In Praise of Folly (1511) had established long fictions subservient to a philosophical purpose. However, the most important single satirical source for the writing of novels came from Miguel de Cervantes' Don Quixote (1605, 1615), which had been quickly translated from Spanish into other European languages including English. It would never go out of print, and the Augustan age saw many free translations in varying styles, by journalists (Ned Ward, 1700 and Peter Motteux, 1712) as well as novelists (Tobias Smollett, 1755). In general, one can see these three axes, drama, journalism, and satire, as blending in and giving rise to three different types of novel. Aphra Behn had written literary novels before the turn of the 18th century, but there were not many immediate successors. Behn's Love Letters Between a Nobleman and His Sister (1684) had been bred in satire, and her Oroonoko (1688) had come from her theatrical experience. Delarivier Manley's New Atlantis (1709) comes closest to an inheritor of Behn's, but her novel, while political and satirical, was a minor scandal. On the other hand, Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe (1719) was the first major novel of the new century. Defoe had written political and religious polemics prior to Robinson Crusoe, and he worked as a journalist during and after its composition. Thus, Defoe encountered the memoirs of Alexander Selkirk, who was a rather brutish individual who had been stranded in South America on an island for some years. Defoe took the actual life and, from that, generated a fictional life. Instead of an expelled Scotsman, Crusoe became a devout Puritan. Instead of remaining alone the entire time, Crusoe encountered a savage named Friday, whom he civilized. The actual Selkirk had been a slave trader, and Crusoe becomes a far more enlightened teacher and missionary. Travel writing sold very well during the period, and tales of extraordinary adventures with pirates and savages were devoured by the public, and Defoe satisfied an essentially journalistic market with his fiction. Woodcut of Daniel Defoe. Defoe would continue to draw from life and news for his next novels. In the 1720s, Defoe wrote \\"Lives\\" of criminals for Applebee's Journal. He interviewed famed criminals and produced accounts of their lives. Whenever a celebrated criminal was hanged, the newspapers and journals would offer up an account of the criminal's life, the criminal's last words, the criminal's gallows speech, etc., and Defoe wrote several of these. In particular, he investigated Jack Sheppard and Jonathan Wild and wrote True Accounts of the former's escapes (and fate) and the latter's life. Defoe, unlike his competition, seems to have been a scrupulous journalist. Although his fictions contained great imagination and a masterful shaping of facts to build themes, his journalism seems based on actual investigation. From his reportage on the prostitutes and criminals, Defoe may have become familiar with the real-life Mary Mollineaux, who may have been the model for Moll in Moll Flanders (1722). As with the transformation of a real Selkirk into a fictional Crusoe, the fictional Moll is everything that the real prostitute was not. She pursues a wild career of material gain, travels to Maryland, commits incest, returns to England, and repents of her sins. She returns to the new land of promise for all Puritans of Maryland, where she lives honestly, with a great sum of money (derived from her licentious life). In the same year, Defoe produced a flatly journalistic A Journal of the Plague Year (1722), and an attempted tale of a working class male rise in Colonel Jack (1722). His last novel returned to the theme of fallen women in Roxana (1724). Thematically, Defoe's works are consistently Puritan. They all involve a fall, a degradation of the spirit, a conversion, and an ecstatic elevation. This religious structure necessarily involved a bildungsroman, for each character had to learn a lesson about him or herself and emerge the wiser. Pamela showing Mr. B intercepting Pamela's first letter to her mother and reading it. Although there were other novels and novelistic works in the interim, Samuel Richardson's Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded (1740) is the next landmark development in the English novel. Richardson was, like Defoe, a dissenter. Unlike Defoe, however, his profession was as a printer rather than a journalist. Therefore, his generic models were quite distinct from those of Defoe. Instead of working from the journalistic biography, Richardson had in mind the dramatic cautionary tales of abused women and the books of improvement that were popular at the time. Pamela is an epistolary novel, like Behn's Love Letters, but its purpose is to illustrate a single chapter in the life of a poor country girl. Pamela Andrews enters the employ of a \\"Mr. B.\\" As a dutiful girl, she writes to her mother constantly, and as a Christian girl, she is always on guard for her \\"virtue\\" (i.e. her virginity), for Mr. B lusts after her. The plot is somewhat melodramatic, and it is pathetic: the reader's sympathies and fears are engaged throughout, and the novel comes close to the She-tragedy of the close of the 17th century in its depiction of a woman as a victim. However, Pamela triumphs. She acts as an angel for the reformation of Mr. B, and the novel ends with her marriage to her employer and rising to the position of lady. Pamela, like its author, presents a dissenter's and a Whig's view of the rise of the classes. It emphasizes duty and perseverance of the saint, and the work was an enormous popular success. It also drew a nearly instantaneous set of satires. Henry Fielding's response was to link Richardson's virtuous girl with Colley Cibber's shamefaced Apology in the form of Shamela, or an Apology for the Life of Miss Shamela Andrews (1742) and it is the most memorable of the \\"answers\\" to Richardson. First, it inaugurated the rivalry between the two authors. Second, beneath the very loose and ribald satire, there is a coherent and rational critique of Richardson's themes. In Fielding's satire, Pamela, as Shamela, writes like a country peasant instead of a learned Londoner (as Pamela had), and it is her goal from the moment she arrives in Squire Booby's (as Mr. B is called) house to become lady of the place by selling her \\"vartue.\\" Fielding also satirizes the presumption that a woman could write of dramatic, ongoing events (\\"He comes abed now, Mama. O Lud, my vartu! My vartu!\\"). Specifically, Fielding thought that Richardson's novel was very good, very well written, and very dangerous, for it offered serving women the illusion that they might sleep their way to wealth and an elevated title. In truth, Fielding saw serving women abused and lords reneging on both their spiritual conversions and promises. After the coarse satire of Shamela, Fielding continued to bait Richardson with Joseph Andrews. Shamela had appeared anonymously, but Fielding published Joseph Andrews under his own name, also in 1742. Joseph Andrews is the tale of Shamela's brother, Joseph, who goes through his life trying to protect his own virginity. Women, rather than men, are the sexual aggressors, and Joseph seeks only to find his place and his true love, Fanny, and accompany his childhood friend, Parson Adams, who is travelling to London to sell a collection of sermons to a bookseller in order to feed his large family. Since the term \\"fanny\\" had obscene implications in the 18th century, Joseph's longings for \\"my Fanny\\" survive as satirical blows, and the inversion of sexual predation strips bare the essentials of Richardson's valuation of virginity. However, Joseph Andrews is not a parody of Richardson. In that novel, Fielding proposed for the first time his belief in \\"good nature.\\" Parson Adams, although not a fool, is a naif. His own basic good nature blinds him to the wickedness of the world, and the incidents on the road (for most of the novel is a travel story) allow Fielding to satirize conditions for the clergy, rural poverty (and squires), and the viciousness of businessmen. Fielding's novels arise out of a satirical model, and the same year that he wrote Joseph Andrews, he also wrote a work that parodied Daniel Defoe's criminal biographies: The History of Jonathan Wild the Great. Jonathan Wild was published in Fielding's Miscellanies, and it is a thorough-going assault on the Whig party. It pretends to tell of the greatness of Jonathan Wild, but Wild is a stand-in for Robert Walpole, who was known as \\"the Great Man.\\" In 1747 through 1748, Samuel Richardson published Clarissa in serial form. Like Pamela, it is an epistolary novel. Unlike Pamela, it is not a tale of virtue rewarded. Instead, it is a highly tragic and affecting account of a young girl whose parents try to force her into an uncongenial marriage, thus pushing her into the arms of a scheming rake named Lovelace. Lovelace is far more wicked than Mr. B. He imprisons Clarissa and tortures her psychologically in an effort to get her consent to marriage. Eventually, Clarissa is violated (whether by Lovelace or the household maids is unclear). Her letters to her parents are pleading, while Lovelace is sophisticated and manipulative. Most of Clarissa's letters are to her childhood friend, Anna Howe. Lovelace is not consciously evil, for he will not simply rape Clarissa. He desires her free consent, which Clarissa will not give. In the end, Clarissa dies by her own will. The novel is a masterpiece of psychological realism and emotional effect, and, when Richardson was drawing to a close in the serial publication, even Henry Fielding wrote to him, begging him not to kill Clarissa. There are many themes in play in Clarissa. Most obviously, the novel is a strong argument for romantic love and against arranged marriages. Clarissa will marry, but she wishes to have her own say in choice of mate. As with Pamela, Richardson emphasizes the individual over the social and the personal over the class. His work was part of a general valuation of the individual over and against the social good. Even as Fielding was reading and enjoying Clarissa, he was also writing a counter to its messages. His Tom Jones of 1749 offers up the other side of the argument from Clarissa. Tom Jones agrees substantially in the power of the individual to be more or less than his or her class, but it again emphasizes the place of the individual in society and the social ramifications of individual choices. While Clarissa cloisters its characters geographically to a house imprisonment and isolates them to their own subjective impressions in the form of letters, Fielding's Tom Jones employs a third person narrative and features a narrator who is virtually another character in the novel itself. Fielding constantly disrupts the illusionary identification of the reader with the characters by referring to the prose itself and uses his narrative style to posit antitheses of characters and action. Tom is a bastard and a foundling who is cared for by Squire Allworthy, who is a man of great good nature. This squire is benevolent and salutary to his community and his family. Allworthy's sister has a child who is born to a high position but who has a vicious nature. Allworthy, in accordance with Christian principles, treats the boys alike. Tom falls in love with Sophia, the daughter of a neighboring squire, and then has to win her hand. It is society that interferes with Tom, and not personified evil. Fielding answers Richardson by featuring a similar plot device (whether a girl can choose her own mate) but by showing how family and village can complicate and expedite matches and felicity. Henry Fielding's sister, Sarah Fielding, was also a novelist. Her David Simple (1744) outsold Joseph Andrews and was popular enough to require sequels. Like her brother, Sarah propounds a theory of good nature. David Simple is, as his name suggests, an innocent. He is possessed of a benevolent disposition and a desire to please, and the pressures and contradictory impulses of society complicate the plot. On the one hand, this novel emphasizes the role of society, but, on the other, it is a novel that sets up the sentimental novel. The genuine compassion and desire for goodness of David Simple were affecting for contemporary audiences, David Simple is a forerunner of the heroes of later novels such as Henry Mackenzie's The Man of Feeling (1771). The most famous portrait of Laurence Sterne by Joshua Reynolds, showing him in a pose of considering a witticism or of ironic detachment. Two other novelists should be mentioned, for they, like Fielding and Richardson, were in dialog through their works. Laurence Sterne and Tobias Smollett held a personal dislike for one another, and their works similarly offered up oppositional views of the self in society and the method of the novel. Laurence Sterne was a clergyman, and he consciously set out to imitate Jonathan Swift with his Tristram Shandy (1759‚Äì1767). The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, gentleman was a stylistic and formal revolution for the novel. Like Swift's satires, it begins with radical skepticism and a willingness to break apart figurative language and commonplace assumptions. The novel in three books is virtually all narrative voice, with a few interpolated narratives, such as \\"Slawkenbergius's Tale.\\" Tristram seeks to write his autobiography, but like Swift's narrator in A Tale of a Tub, he worries that nothing in his life can be understood without understanding its context. For example, he tells the reader that at the very moment he was conceived, his mother was saying, \\"Did you wind the clock?\\" To explain how he knows this, he explains that his father took care of winding the clock and \\"other family business\\" on one day a month. To explain why the clock had to be wound then, he has to explain his father. To explain his father, he must explain a habit of his uncle's (referred to as \\"My Uncle Toby\\"), and that requires knowing what his uncle did during the War of the Spanish Succession at the Battle of Namur. In other words, the biography moves backward rather than forward in time, only to then jump forward years, hit another knot, and move backward again. Further, Sterne provides \\"plot diagrams\\" for his readers that look like a ball of yarn. When a character dies, the next page of the book is black, in mourning. At one point, there is an end paper inserted into the text as a false ending to the book. It is a novel of exceptional energy, of multi-layered digressions, of multiple satires, and of frequent parodies. It was so experimental that Samuel Johnson later famously used it as an example of a fad when he said that nothing novel can sustain itself, for \\"Tristram Shandy did not last.\\" Portrait of Tobias Smollett. Tobias Smollett, on the other hand, wrote more seemingly traditional novels (although the novel was still too new to have much of a tradition). He concentrated on the picaresque novel, where a low-born character would go through a practically endless series of adventures that would carry him into various cities and circles of high life and achieve either a great gain (in a comic ending) or a great loss. Unlike Sterne, who only published two novels, or Fielding, who died before he could manage more than four novels, Smollett was prolific. He wrote the following and more: The Adventures of Roderick Random (1748), The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle (1751), The Adventures of Ferdinand Count Fathom (1753), The Life and Adventures of Sir Launcelot Greaves (1762), The History and Adventures of an Atom (1769), and The Expedition of Humphry Clinker (1771). Smollett depended upon his pen for his livelihood, and so he also wrote history and political tracts. Smollett was also a highly valued translator. He translated both Don Quixote and Alain Rene LeSage's Gil Blas (1748). These two translated works show to some degree Smollett's personal preferences and models, for they are both rambling, open-ended novels with highly complex plots and comedy both witty and earthy. Sterne's primary attack on Smollett was personal, for the two men did not like each other, but he referred to Smollett as \\"Smelfungus.\\" He thought that Smollett's novels always paid undue attention to the basest and most common elements of life, that they emphasized the dirt. Although this is a superficial complaint, it points to an important difference between the two as authors. Sterne came to the novel from a satirical background, while Smollett approached it from journalism. Sterne's pose is ironic, detached, and amused. For Sterne, the novel itself is secondary to the purpose of the novel, and that purpose was to pose difficult problems, on the one hand, and to elevate the reader, on the other (with his Sentimental Journey). Smollett's characters are desperately working to attain relief from imposition and pain, and they have little choice but to travel and strive. The plot of the novel drives the theme, and not the theme the plot. In the 19th century, novelists would have plots much nearer to Smollett's than either Fielding's or Sterne's or Richardson's, and his sprawling, linear development of action would prove most successful. However, Smollett's novels are not thematically tightly organized, and action appears solely for its ability to divert the reader, rather than to reinforce a philosophical point. The exception to this is Smollett's last novel, Humphry Clinker, written during Smollett's final illness. That novel adopts the epistolary framework previously seen in Richardson, but to document a long journey taken by a family. All of the family members and servants get a coach and travel for weeks, experiencing a number of complications and set-backs. The letters come from all of the members of the entourage, and not just the patriarch or matriarch. They exhibit numerous voices, from the witty and learned Oxford University student, Jerry (who is annoyed to accompany his family), to the eruptive patriarch Matthew Bramble, to the nearly illiterate servant Wynn Jenkins (whose writing contains many malapropisms). The title character doesn't appear until over half way through the novel, and he is only a coachman who turns out to be better than his station (and is revealed to be Matt Bramble's bastard son). =Later novels/other trends= In the midst of this development of the novel, other trends were taking place. The novel of sentiment was beginning in the 1760s and would experience a brief period of dominance. This type of novel emphasized sympathy. In keeping with the philosophy of Hartley (see above), the sentimental novel concentrated on characters who are quickly moved to labile swings of mood and extraordinary empathy. At the same time, women were writing novels and moving away from the old romance plots that had dominated before the Restoration. There were utopian novels, like Sarah Scott's Millennium Hall (1762), autobiographical women's novels like Frances Burney's works, female adaptations of older, male motifs, such as Charlotte Lennox's The Female Quixote (1752) and many others. These novels do not generally follow a strict line of development or influence. However, they were popular works that were celebrated by both male and female readers and critics. =Historians of the novel= Ian Watt's The Rise of the Novel (1957) still dominates attempts at writing a history of the novel. Watt's view is that the critical feature of the 18th-century novel is the creation of psychological realism. This feature, he argued, would continue on and influence the novel as it has been known in the 20th century, and therefore those novels that created it are, in fact, the true progenitors of the novel. Although Watt thought Tristram Shandy was the finest novel of the century, he also regarded it as being a stylistic cul-de-sac. Since Watt's work, numerous theorists and historians have attempted to answer the limitations of his assumptions. Michael McKeon, for example, brought a Marxist approach to the history of the novel in his 1986 The Origins of the English Novel. McKeon viewed the novel as emerging as a constant battleground between two developments of two sets of world view that corresponded to Whig/Tory, Dissenter/Establishment, and Capitalist/Persistent Feudalist. The \\"novel,\\" for him, is the synthesis of competing and clashing theses and antitheses of individual novels. I.e. the \\"novel\\" is the process of negotiation and conflict between competing ideologies, rather than a definable and fixed set of thematic or generic conventions. Satire (unclassified) Image a flea from Robert Hooke's work with the Royal Society. It is an image that affected Jonathan Swift's poetry and prose. A single name overshadows all others in 18th-century prose satire: Jonathan Swift. Swift wrote poetry as well as prose, and his satires range over all topics. Critically, Swift's satire marked the development of prose parody away from simple satire or burlesque. A burlesque or lampoon in prose would imitate a despised author and quickly move to reductio ad absurdum by having the victim say things coarse or idiotic. On the other hand, other satires would argue against a habit, practice, or policy by making fun of its reach or composition or methods. What Swift did was to combine parody, with its imitation of form and style of another, and satire in prose. Swift's works would pretend to speak in the voice of an opponent and imitate the style of the opponent and have the parodic work itself be the satire: the imitation would have subtle betrayals of the argument but would not be obviously absurd. For example, in A Modest Proposal (1729), Swift imitates the \\"projector.\\" As indicated above, the book shops were filled with single sheets and pamphlets proposing economic panacea. These projectors would slavishly write according to the rules of rhetoric that they had learned in school by stating the case, establishing that they have no interest in the outcome, and then offering a solution before enumerating the profits of the plan. Swift does the same, but the proposed solution (cannibalism) is immoral. There is very little logically wrong with the proposal, but it is unquestionably morally abhorrent, and it can only be acceptable if one regards the Irish as kine. The parody of an enemy is note-perfect, and the satire comes not from grotesque exaggerations of style, but in the extra-literary realm of morality and ethics. Illustration from Swift's Battle of the Books (1705), showing the ancient authors doing battle with the moderns, while a spider and a bee argue in a corner above the scene and fame blows her \\"posterior trumpet.\\" Jonathan Swift's first major satire was A Tale of a Tub (1703‚Äì1705). That satire introduced an ancients/moderns division that would serve as a handy distinction between the old and new conception of value. The \\"moderns\\" sought trade, empirical science, the individual's reason above the society's, and the rapid dissemination of knowledge, while the \\"ancients\\" believed in inherent and immanent value of birth, the society over the individual's determinations of the good, and rigorous education. In Swift's satire, the moderns come out looking insane and proud of their insanity, dismissive of the value of history, and incapable of understanding figurative language because unschooled. In Swift's most significant satire, Gulliver's Travels (1726), autobiography, allegory, and philosophy mix together in the travels. Under the umbrella of a parody of travel writing (such as Defoe's, but more particularly the fantastic and oriental tales that were circulating in London), Swift's Gulliver travels to Liliput, a figurative London beset by a figurative Paris, and sees all of the factionalism and schism as trifles of small men. He travels then to an idealized nation with a philosopher king in Brobdingnag, where Gulliver's own London is summed up in the king's saying, \\"I cannot but conclude the bulk of your natives to be the most pernicious race of odious little vermin Nature ever suffered to crawl upon the face of the earth.\\" Gulliver then moves beyond the philosophical kingdom to the land of the Houyhnhnms, a society of horses ruled by pure reason, where humanity itself is portrayed as a group of \\"yahoos\\" covered in filth and dominated by base desires. Swift later added a new third book to the satire, a heterogeneous book of travels to Laputa, Balnibarbi, Glubdubdribb, Luggnagg, and Japan. This book's primary satire is on empiricism and the Royal Society, whose reports Swift read. \\"Projectors\\" of all sorts live in the Academy of Lagado, a flying island (London) that saps all the nourishment from the land below (the countryside) and occasionally crushes, literally, troublesome cities (Dublin). Thematically, Gulliver's Travels is a critique of human vanity, of pride. Book one begins with the world as it is. Book two shows that an ideal philosopher kingdom is no home for a contemporary Englishman. Book three shows the uselessness and actual evil of indulging the passions of science without connection to the realm of simple production and consumption. Book four shows that, indeed, the very desire for reason may be undesirable, and humans must struggle to be neither Yahoos nor Houhynymns. There were other satirists who worked in a less virulent way. Jonathan Swift's satires obliterated hope in any specific institution or method of human improvement, but some satirists instead took a bemused pose and only made lighthearted fun. Tom Brown, Ned Ward, and Tom D'Urfey were all satirists in prose whose works appeared in the early part of the Augustan age. Tom Brown's most famous work in this vein was Amusements Serious and Comical, Calculated for the Meridian of London (1700). For poetry, Brown was important for his translation of Scarron's Le Virgile travesti, as well as the scandalous Roman satirist Petronius (CBEL). Ned Ward's most memorable work was The London Spy (1704‚Äì1706). The London Spy, before The Spectator, took up the position of an observer and uncomprehendingly reporting back. Thereby, Ward records and satirizes the vanity and exaggerated spectacle of London life in a lively prose style. Ward is also important for his history of secret clubs of the Augustan age. These included The Secret History of the Calves-Head Club, Complt. or, The Republican Unmask'd (1706), which sought humorously to expose the silly exploits of radicals. Ward also translated The Life &Adventures; of Don Quixote de la Mancha, translated into Hudibrastic Verse in 1711, where the Hudibrastic, which had been born in Samuel Butler's imitation of Cervantes, now became the fit medium for a translation of the original (CBEL). Tom D'Urfey's Wit and Mirth: or Pills to Purge Melancholy (1719 for last authorial revision) was another satire that attempted to offer entertainment, rather than a specific bit of political action. D'Urfey (or \\"Durfey\\" as he was born) was a stutterer whose clownishness and willingness to be the butt of a joke so long as a joke was told made him a favorite of the nobility and court, and his career straddles the Restoration and Augustan period. Pills to Purge Melancholy is a collection of witty and bawdy songs, mainly drinking songs, with popular favorites such as \\"The Famous Fart.\\" Although Pope satirized Durfey, he also wrote, in a letter in 1710, that Durfey had a power that he himself did not, for, years after the publication of Pills to Purge Melancholy, Durfey's songs were still on the lips of thousands, while no other poet had such popularity or persistence. Indeed, ten of Durfey's tunes were used in John Gay's Beggar's Opera, five years after Durfey's death. However, particularly after Swift's success, parodic satire had an attraction for authors throughout the 18th century. A variety of factors created a rise in political writing and political satire (see above for some), and Robert Walpole's success and domination of Commons was a very effective proximal cause for polarized literature and thereby the rise of parodic satire. For one thing, the parodic structure allowed an author to indict another without directly mentioning a name. For another thing, such a satire allowed the author to criticize without offering up a corrective. Swift, for example, does not directly tell his readers what is of value. Instead, like Hume later, he criticizes the gullibility, naivety, and simplicity of others. The parodic satire takes apart the cases and plans of policy without necessarily contrasting a normative or positive set of values. Therefore, it was an ideal method of attack for ironists and conservatives‚Äîthose who would not be able to enunciate a set of values to change toward but could condemn present changes as ill-considered. A painting by William Hogarth of a scene from John Gay's Beggar's Opera. Swift was a friend of Alexander Pope, Robert Harley, John Gay, John Arbuthnot, Thomas Parnell, and Henry St. John. These men together formed the \\"Scribbleran Club,\\" and they had as their common goal a satire of the \\"abuses of learning\\" of all sorts. Pope, Gay, Arbuthnot, and Swift wrote a series of Miscellanies, all mislabeled (the \\"third part\\" was the first, the \\"first part\\" was the second). In them were several satirical pieces, including Pope's Peri Bathos (see Bathos), 1727, a satire of manuals of the sublime and a manual of how to write bad poetry. Pope picked verses from his contemporaries, and especially his longtime rival, Ambrose Philips, and collated them into a full schematic of how to make bad verse, how to sink in poetry. The Scribbleran Club also produced the Memoirs of Martinus Scribblerus, which is a mock-biography of a man who has learned all the worst lessons of classicism. Martinus Scribblerus is a Don Quixote figure, a man so deeply read in Latin and Greek poetry that he insists on living his life according to that literature. The resulting work is not quite a novel, as it is a sustained prose work that only serves satire. Satire was present in all genres during the Augustan period. In poetry, all of the literary members of the Scribblerus Club produced verse satires. Gay's Trivia (1716) and many poems by Pope were satires first and foremost. John Arbuthnot's John Bull's Law Case was a prose satire that was extremely popular and generated the term \\"John Bull\\" for Englishmen. Further, satire was present in drama. Many plays had satirical scenes or characters, but some plays, like Gay's Beggar's Opera, were parodic satires early in the period (1728), and others, like Henry Fielding's Tragedy of Tragedies (1731) were in the next generation. Additionally and perhaps primarily, satire was a part of political and religious debate. Every significant politician and political act had satires to attack it. Few of these were parodic satires, but parodic satires, too, emerged in political and religious debate. So omnipresent and powerful was satire in the Augustan age that more than one literary history has referred to it as the \\"Age of satire\\" in literature.

Judge Boggs recused himself from the subsequent panel inquiry, which found a rule violation but recommended no action. Judicial style and clerks One unusual feature of Judge Boggs' managing style is a general knowledge quiz he gives to clerkship applicants. The quiz strongly emphasizes history, literature, and classics, but also contains questions asking for the takers' opinions. Judge Boggs says he uses the answers to gain insight into potential clerks' interests and personalities.

Although it had a short service life, it equipped several squadrons of the RAF as one of the most important British bombers of the mid-1930s, and was the last biplane heavy bomber to serve with the RAF. The first aircraft of the type were deployed at RAF Upper Heyford, near Bicester in Oxfordshire. Design and development The Heyford was built to meet Air Ministry specification B.19/27 for a heavy night bomber to replace the Vickers Virginia, which required a twin-engined aircraft capable of carrying 1,546 lb (700 kg) of bombs and flying 920 miles at 115 mph (185 km/h).Barnes 1976, pp. 288, 290. The specification resulted in a large number of proposals being submitted by the British aircraft industry, with designs by Fairey (the Fairey Hendon) and Vickers (the Type 150 and Type 163 being built) as well as Handley Page's design.Jarrett Aeroplane Monthly November 1995, pp. 13‚Äì14. The prototype, the Handley Page HP.38, was designed by Handley Page's lead designer G. R. Volkert and first flew on 12 June 1930 at Handley Page's factory at Radlett,Mason 1994, p.213. powered by two 525 hp (390 kW) Rolls- Royce Kestrel II engines driving two-blade propellers. The aircraft was of mixed construction having fabric-covered, two-bay metal-frame wings,Jarrett Aeroplane Monthly December 1995, pp. 18‚Äì19. while the fuselage had an aluminium monocoque forward section with a fabric-covered frame to the rear,Jarrett Aeroplane Monthly December 1995, p. 17. It had a crew of four, consisting of a pilot, a bomb aimer/navigator/gunner, a radio operator and a dorsal/ventral gunner. Open positions were provided for the pilot and both the nose and dorsal gunners. The Heyford had a novel configuration, with the fuselage attached to the upper wing ‚Äî somewhat like the 1914-designed German Gotha G.I ‚Äî and with the bomb bay in the thickened centre lower wing. This provided a good defensive field of fire for the nose and dorsal guns as well as the ventral retractable \\"dustbin\\" turret,\\"New War Plane Has Movable Gun Turret\\" Popular Science, April 1934, rare photos of dustbin turret at bottom of page 28 each equipped with a single .303 in (7.7 mm) Lewis Gun. The fixed undercarriage consisted of large, spat-covered wheels. The design allowed ground crews to safely attach bombs while the engines were running, but the result was that the pilot was some 17 ft (5 m) off the ground. The HP.38 proved successful during service trials at Martlesham Heath and with No. 10 Squadron RAF and was chosen as the winner of the B19/27 competition, being ordered as the HP.50 Heyford. Production Heyford Is were fitted with 575 hp (429 kW) Kestrel III engines and retained the two-blade propellers, while the IAs had four-blade propellers. Engine variations marked the main Mk II and III differences; the former being equipped with 640 hp (480 kW) Kestrel IVs, supercharged to 695 hp (518 kW) in the Heyford III. Operational history 102 Squadron at RAF Honington, 1938 The Heyford I entered service with No. 99 Squadron RAF, at RAF Upper Heyford in November 1933, and later with No. 10 Squadron and 7 Squadron, re-equipping with the Heyford IA and II in August 1934 and April 1935 respectively.Thetford Aeroplane Monthly January 1996, p. 42. As part of the RAF's expansion scheme, orders were placed for 70 Heyford IIIs in 1936, with steam condenser-cooled Rolls-Royce Kestrel VI engines. The delivery of these aircraft allowed the RAF to have nine operational Heyford Squadrons by the end of 1936.Mason 1994, p. 215.Moyes 1976, p. 300: Order of Battle of RAF's Bomber Arm as at 15 December 1936, Group 3. These squadrons of Heyfords formed the major part of Bomber Command's night bomber strength in the late 1930s. Heyfords flew many long night exercises, sometimes flying mock attacks against targets in France. Disaster struck on one of these long-range exercises on 12 December 1936, when a flight of seven Heyfords of No. 102 Squadron RAF, flying from Northern Ireland, encountered fog and icy weather conditions as they approached their base at RAF Finningley, Yorkshire. Four crashed and two had to make forced landings resulting in three crewmen killed and three injured.Mason 1994, p. 214. The Heyford started to be replaced in 1937, with the arrival in service of Armstrong Whitworth Whitleys and Vickers Wellesleys,Thetford 1957, p.246. finally being retired from frontline service in 1939. Some remained flying until 1940 as bombing and gunnery trainers, being declared obsolete in July 1939,Donald, David, ed. The Encyclopedia of World Aircraft. London: Aerospace Publishing, 1997. . with two used as glider tugs until April 1941.Thetford Aeroplane Monthly February 1996, p. 65. At least two examples found experimental use; one for airborne radar and the other for inflight refuelling,Jarrett Aeroplane Monthly November 1995, p. 18. and it is reported that one was still stored as late as 1944.

At the Virginia Secession Convention of 1861, Wickham voted against secession, but after fellow delegates and voters approved secession, he became an important Confederate cavalry general. After the American Civil War, Wickham became a Republican and served in the Virginia Senate as well as became President of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway company. Early life and career Wickham was born in Richmond, Virginia, the son of William Fanning Wickham and Anne Butler (n√©e Carter) Wickham. His paternal grandfather was John Wickham, the constitutional lawyer. On his mother's side, he descended from historic roots, as the Nelson and Carter families were each First Families of Virginia, prominent in the Virginia Colony. Wickham's great-grandfather, Gen. Thomas Nelson, Jr., was one of the signatories of the Declaration of Independence and a governor of Virginia during the American Revolutionary War. Other ancestors include Thomas \\"Scotch Tom\\" Nelson who was one of the founders of Yorktown in the late 17th century. He was also a descendant of Robert \\"King\\" Carter (1663‚Äì1732), who served as an acting royal governor of Virginia and was one of its wealthiest landowners in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. His mother was a first cousin of Robert E. Lee, whose mother Anne Hill (n√©e Carter) Lee, was born at Shirley Plantation. Wickham spent much of his youth on his father's plantation, Hickory Hill, which is located about north of Richmond and east of Ashland in Hanover County. Hickory Hill was long an outlying appendage to Shirley Plantation, much of it having come into possession of the Carter family by a deed dated March 2, 1734. Wickham was graduated from the University of Virginia and was admitted to the bar in 1842. He was married to Lucy Penn Taylor and had several children, one of whom, Henry Taylor Wickham served as President Pro-tem of the Virginia State Senate. He became a justice and was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1849. In 1858 he was commissioned captain of Virginia volunteer militia cavalry, and in 1861 he was elected by the people of Henrico County to the state convention as a Unionist, where he voted against the articles of secession. Civil War General Wickham Following the secession of Virginia, Wickham took his company, the Hanover Dragoons, into the service of the Confederate States Army. After participating in the First Battle of Manassas, Wickham was commissioned by Governor John Letcher as lieutenant colonel of the Fourth Virginia Cavalry in September 1861. On May 4, 1862, he incurred a severe saber wound during a cavalry charge at the Battle of Williamsburg. In this state of injury, he was captured, but quickly paroled. In August 1862, he was commissioned Colonel of the Fourth Virginia Cavalry. At the Battle of Sharpsburg, he was wounded again, this time in the neck by a shell fragment. Recovering, he participated in the battles of Chancellorsville, Brandy Station and Gettysburg. General Wade Hampton blamed the failures of Wickham's Fourth Virginia Cavalry at Brandy Station for the death of his brother, Lt. Col. Frank Hampton. Wickham was commissioned brigadier general on September 9, 1863, and put in command of Wickham's brigade of Fitzhugh Lee's division. On May 11, 1864, he fought at the Battle of Yellow Tavern. Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart was mortally wounded during this engagement, with his final order being: \\"Order Wickham to dismount his brigade and attack.\\" In September 1864, after the Confederate defeat at the Battle of Fisher's Hill, Wickham blocked at Milford an attempt by Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan to encircle and destroy the Confederate forces of Maj. Gen. Jubal Early. He then attacked the Federal cavalry at Waynesboro and forced them to retreat to Bridgewater. Wickham resigned his commission on October 5, 1864, and took his seat in the Second Confederate Congress, to which he had been elected while in the field. Recognizing that the days of the Confederacy were over, he participated in the Hampton Roads Conference in an attempt to bring an early end to the war. Postbellum activities After the surrender of the Confederacy, Wickham was active in improving harmony between the states and reorganizing Virginia's economy, which had been ruined by the war. He became a Republican and voted in 1872 for General Ulysses S. Grant as a member of the Electoral College of Virginia. In November 1865, at the conclusion of the War, he was elected president of the Virginia Central Railroad, which had been one of the most heavily damaged during the War. In 1868, when the Virginia Central merged with the Covington and Ohio Railroad to form the new Chesapeake and Ohio, Wickham was retained as the new company's president. In the new capacity, he was anxious to complete a railroad line to the Ohio River, long a dream of Virginians. However, unlike fellow Confederate officer and railroad leader William Mahone had done, he was unable to secure capital or financing in Virginia, or from Europeans. Turning to New York City, he was successful in attracting an investment group headed by Collis P. Huntington. Fresh from recent completion of the western portion of the U.S. transcontinental railroad as a member of the so-called \\"Big Four\\", Huntington joined the effort, became the C&O;'s new president. His contacts and reputation helped obtain $15 million of funding from New York financiers for the project, which eventually cost $23 million to complete. The final spike ceremony for the long line from Richmond to the Ohio River was held on January 29, 1873 at Hawk's Nest railroad bridge in the New River Valley, near the town of Ansted in Fayette County, West Virginia. After Huntington assumed the presidency, Wickham served as vice-president of the C&O; from 1869 to 1878, when the company went into foreclosure, with Wickham as receiver. In 1878 the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad was sold under foreclosure and reorganized as the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Company, with Collis P. Huntington assuming the office of President of the reorganized road; Wickham was named second vice- president. Under their leadership, an additional line was extended east from Richmond through the new Church Hill Tunnel and down the Virginia Peninsula through Williamsburg to reach coal piers located on the harbor Hampton Roads, the East Coast of the United States' largest ice-free port at the small unincorporated town of Newport News in Warwick County. During the ten years from 1878 to 1888, C&O;'s coal resources began to be developed and shipped eastward. Coal became a staple of the C&O;'s business at that time, and still was over 125 years later under successor CSX Transportation. The man Wickham brought to Virginia, Collis P. Huntington, went on to develop his holdings in Newport News, where he began the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company and helped the small community become one of only two in Virginia to become an independent city without first having been an incorporated town. In modern times, Newport News, which merged with the former Warwick County in 1958, has grown to become one of the major cities of Hampton Roads. Throughout the years after the Civil War, while developing railroads, Wickham also maintained an active political life. He maintained his offices in Richmond and his residence in Hanover County. He was elected chairman of the Hanover County, Virginia, Board of Supervisors in 1871 and as a Senator in the upper house of the Virginia General Assembly in 1883 and 1887. He was an officer of the C&O; and held all of these other positions at the time of his death on July 23, 1888, at his office in Richmond. Statue of Williams Carter Wickham sculpted by Edward V. Valentine and placed in Monroe Park Death and legacy Wickham died of heart failure in 1888 and was interred in Hickory Hill Cemetery near Ashland, Virginia. A statue of Williams Carter Wickham was given to the City of Richmond by the general's comrades and employees of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway in 1891 and was placed in Monroe Park. Two of the general's descendants, who do not represent the entire family, called for the statue's removal in the aftermath of Charlottesville, Virginia's 2017 Unite the Right rally, and participants in 2020's George Floyd protests defaced and toppled the statue from its pedestal.

Early life Wisden was born in Crown Street, Brighton.Eric Midwinter, ‚ÄòWisden, John (1826‚Äì1884)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2013 accessed 13 September 2013 His father, William, was a builder. He attended Brighton's Middle Street School (formerly the Royal Union School, founded as a charity school in 1805). He moved to London after his father died, and lived with the wicket-keeper Tom Box.John Wisden, ESPNcricinfoThe survival of Wisden, ESPNcricinfo, July 1992 Cricket In July 1845, aged 18, only 5 ft 4 in and weighing just , he made his first-class debut for Sussex against MCC, taking 6 wickets in the first innings and three in the second.Scorecard, Sussex v Kent. 3,4,5 July 1845 He joined the All-England Eleven in 1846, moving allegiance to the United All-England Eleven in 1852. He was engaged to marry George Parr's sister Annie in 1849, but she died before the wedding, and he never married. Initially a fast roundarm bowler, before overarm bowling was permitted, his pace slowed in later years so he bowled medium pace; he also bowled slow underarm. While bowling fast, he took on average nearly 10 wickets in each game. In 1850, when he was playing for the North against the South at Lord's, his off-cutter technique won him 10 wickets in the second innings, all clean bowled (still the only instance of all ten wickets being taken \\"bowled\\" in any first-class match). He was also a competent batsman, and scored two first-class centuries, the first, exactly 100, against Kent at Tunbridge Wells in 1849, and in 1855 he notched up 148 against Yorkshire, the only first-class century scored in 1855. He played almost all of his cricket in England, mostly for Sussex, but once for Kent and thrice for Middlesex. He travelled with a touring team led by George Parr to Canada and the US in 1859, where eight matches in Montreal, Hoboken, Philadelphia, Hamilton and Rochester were won easily. Of moderate height, he was nicknamed the \\"Little Wonder\\" after the winner of The Derby in 1840, and later the \\"Cardinal\\". He was said to be the best all-rounder of his day. In all, he took 1,109 first-class wickets with a bowling average of 10.32. He scored 4,140 first-class runs with a batting average of 14.12, an average which was very good for the time. Business career and legacy J Wisden & Company, 21 Cranbourn Street, London Wisden began a cricket-equipment business in Leamington Spa in 1850 and five years later opened a \\"cricket and cigar\\" shop in Coventry Street near The Haymarket in central London, in partnership with Fred Lillywhite until 1858. He was also the cricket coach at Harrow School from 1852 to 1855, and owned The Cricketers, a public house at Duncton in Sussex. He retired from cricket in 1863 at the relatively early age of 37 as a result of rheumatism, and started publishing his annual Cricketers' Almanack the following year. He also published in Cricket and How to Play It in 1866. In retirement he developed his business into a manufacturer and retailer of equipment for many sports, not just cricket. The shop moved to Cranbourn Street near Leicester Square in 1872. After his death the business grew into a major international sports brand, receiving a Royal Warrant in 1911 as \\"Athletic Outfitters to the King\\". The business went into receivership in 1939, and was acquired in 1943 by a Co-operative society, which sold it on to Grays of Cambridge in 1970. Grays then ceased to use Wisden as an equipment brand, but re-established John Wisden & Co as the publisher of the Cricketers' Almanack. It is now an imprint of Wisden's owner, Bloomsbury Publishing Plc. Death Wisden died of cancer, at the age of 57, in the flat above his Cranbourn Street shop (next to Leicester Square tube station). He was buried in Brompton Cemetery, London. In 1913, 29 years after his death, he was the subject of a \\"Special Portrait\\" in the 50th edition of Wisden, replacing the usual Wisden Cricketers of the Year feature which was dropped from that edition. In 1984, a headstone was placed at his grave to mark the centenary of his death.

Though Chicks on Speed reached cult status throughout the 2000s as catalysts of the musical genre electroclash, Chicks on Speed were actually founded as a multidisciplinary art group working in performance art, electronic dance music, collage graphics, textile design and fashion. History Melissa Logan and Alex Murray-Leslie were art students at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich, when they met in 1997 at one of the Academy's parties. Murray-Leslie founded an illegal bar called \\"Maria Bar\\" in 1994 with friends Barbara and Karl Fritsch, changing its name to \\"Seppi Bar\\" in 1996, a nomadic ArtBar around Munich that lasted 3 years. It was a project based on the Cabaret Voltaire in Zurich where the Dada artists met and performed. It was here that Murray-Leslie invited Logan and Lisa Walker to join Seppi Bar in 1997. Logan and Murray-Leslie began working as a group at Seppi Bar to create art exhibitions and host illegal parties. After a seminar by Roberto Ohrt on the Situationist International Logan asked Murray-Leslie to leave the lecture and in the hallway said they should be an art collective, a large radical group but without the boss structure of Guy Debord, they would be a collective with equal leadership, horizontal. Later Logan and Kiki Moorse met through their Japanese boyfriends. Moorse came from fashion, formally an editor at Cond√© Nast. Moorse was a performer in an early Chicks on Speed video (F√ºr die Bessere Welt/ for the better world, Seppi welt ist besser/ (a member until 2006 now on Toffeetones Records), after which she invited her to join Chicks on Speed. In this period, Murray-Leslie worked with Upstart at the techno nightclub Ultraschall working the door, curating live-art events and interior media art installations. This meeting with Upstart (Label owner of Disko B) would see the medium of music merge with the Chicks' multimedia explorations. Chicks on Speed created a live-art piece named I Wanna Be A DJ...Baby!. They stood behind DJ decks and smashed records while a sound collage tape was playing. For this project they also put together a \\"box set\\" with a T-shirt, a cassette, a paper record and a fake interview for their \\"band\\". During this time they met Upstart (a.k.a. Peter Wacha) of Disko B record label who joined their freshly started record label, Go Records, which later become Chicks on Speed Records with Jeurgen S√∂der. Go Records was a suicide label‚Äîthe release numbers started at 10 and went down to zero; the motto was, perhaps what is wrong with the world is that things are made to grow & get bigger. The 10 releases were primarily limited edition 7\\" and 10\\" records that sold out fast. Philosophy In an interview with Undertheradar.co.nz, Melissa Logan, a founding and current member stated, \\"We are humanists. Feminism is a small and at the same time a great part of this. Besides the obvious deserved rights for females through sexual equality, equality offers white males a way out of the white male oppressor role.\\" Logan states that their political activism is a form of feminism and that their form of feminism does not have to fit into a box. She asserts, \\"We were confused and aggressive: what do you mean, we‚Äôre feminists? We‚Äôre just making our work. And then, at the time, I had a really political boyfriend, who said, yes, you guys are really political, if you‚Äôre not feminists you can‚Äôt do what you want to do. It doesn‚Äôt mean that there‚Äôs a definition and you have to fit with it ‚Äì you can make your own definition of it ‚Äì and then it was oh yeah.\\" Music Alex Murray-Leslie and Melissa Logan, portrayed in a Gaudi building in Barcelona in 2009 A cassette titled Analog Internet was the first piece of music released by Chicks On Speed. The cassette was released in 1997, though it seems widely agreed that the first Chicks on Speed single was a cover of the song \\"Warm Leatherette\\", originally by Daniel Miller (as The Normal), released in 7\\" form. The single was released in 1998 and four further singles (\\"Smash Metal\\", \\"Euro Trash Girl\\" (originally by Cracker in 1993), \\"Mind Your Own Business\\" (originally by Delta 5 in 1979) and \\"Glamour Girl\\" over 1998 and 1999) preceded any actual album releases. In March 2000, two Chicks on Speed LPs were released; the first, titled The Un-Releases, is not considered an official album, instead described as a \\"collage\\" of various songs in various forms. Chicks on Speed's debut, Chicks On Speed Will Save Us All appeared later in the month and featured all five of the previous singles as well as a new one, \\"Kaltes Klares Wasser\\", a cover of a song by the German all-women punk band Malaria!. All six of these singles proved popular and in October 2000, The Re-Releases Of The Un-Releases was issued. Several EPs were issued over the next few years such as chix 52, a collection of B-52's covers and Fashion Rules that heralded the arrival of the 2003 second album 99 Cents released on Chicks on Speed records and licensed to EMI. The album produced three more singles: \\"We Don't Play Guitars\\", a collaboration with Canadian artist Peaches, which was a hit around the world; a cover of Tom Tom Club's \\"Wordy Rappinghood\\" which saw a number of guest stars including Le Tigre; and \\"Flame On\\", a hidden track on the album with Mika Vanio. By this time Chicks on Speed have already been collaborating with Anat Ben-David, an unofficial band member working with them since 2002. In 2004, their third album, Press The Spacebar was released. The album was a collaboration with the Spanish band The No-Heads and Cristian Vogel. No singles were issued from the album, though it included a new version of \\"Culture Vulture\\", a song from their previous LP release 99 Cents. In November 2006, Chicks on Speed released the 12\\" single \\"Art Rules\\" produced with Christopher Just, with guests Anat Ben David and Turner prize artist Douglas Gordon; after the release, Chicks on Speed concentrated on live art performances under the same name and toured art institutions the world over, collaborating with A.L. Steiner, Anat Ben David, Kathi Glas and Adi Nachman. Chicks on Speed began researching and developing ObjektInstruments (self-made musical instruments) in 2005 for studio and stage implementation, and held a solo exhibition presenting the instruments in a performative installation at Dundee Contemporary Arts Centre in 2010. 2011‚Äì2013 Chicks on Speed were Artist Residents at ZKM, Centre for Art and Media, Karlsruhe producing the new Chicks on Speed album UTOPIA and a series of 6 APP's as musical instruments for interactive stage performances. Chicks on Speed collaborated with Julian Assange, Yoko Ono, Peter Weible and Francesca Thyssen, Anat Ben David, Angie Seah, Oliver Horton and Christopher Just on the album UTOPIA released September 2014. Other artistic endeavours Logan and Murray-Leslie have always classified Chicks on Speed as a multidisciplinary \\"project\\" blurring the lines between media, art, music, fashion and performance. They run a record label, Chicks On Speed Records, together with Peter Wacha, Juergen S√∂der and Gero Loferer (design), releasing recordings by Le Tigre, Kevin Blechdom, Planningtorock, Gustav, Ana da Silva of The Raincoats, DAT Politics, Susanne Brokesch, Kids on TV, Anat Ben-David, Angie Reed and the Girl Monster compilation series. Chicks on Speed's interest lies in art, something that also characterises their live performances. Major solo art exhibitions include Kunstverein Wolfsburg 2004, Kunstraum Innsbruck 2005, CAC Vilnius 2007, Kunstraum Kreuzberg 2010, Dundee Contemporary Arts 2011, ArtSpace Sydney, Institute of Modern Art, Brisbane 2013 and Design Hub RMIT University, Melbourne, 2014. Group exhibitions include \\"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\\", Bilbao Fine Arts Museum 2007 and \\"Switch On the Power\\", Vigo, Spain 2006. XMas, Sell-Out, and ChicksTV. Chicks on Speed performed at Australian Pavilion vernisage, 55th Venice Biennale and Museum of Contemporary Art Sydney, 2013, Thyssen Bornemisza Art Contemporary 2012, Turner Prize Retrospective at the Tate in October 2007, and at MoMA in June 2006, as part of a special evening with Douglas Gordon. Their work with Douglas Gordon included a performance at the Centre Georges Pompidou in February 2007, Collection TBA-21 hosted a performance in Vienna in April 2007, and an exhibition at Yvonne Lambert in Paris in September 2007. They have been responsible for the cover art for various other artists, particularly ones signed to their label and Mego Records in Vienna. Chicks on Speed's focus on fashion began in 1997 with their first stage costumes; these developed into a longtime collaboration with Kathi Glas, and more recently with Peggy Noland, Ari Fish and Jeremy Scott. The fashion side of Chicks on Speed has grown into collaborations with independent fashion brands, including textile yardiges for Crystal Ball Japan in 2007/2008, DAA (Designers Against Aids) and Hennes and Mauritz \\"Fashion Against Aids\\" in 2008. In 2009, Chicks on Speed and Insight launched the project, Insight on Chicks on Speed, with a range of girls' surf wear, and a song and video, titled \\"Super Surfer Girl\\". They are currently working on a larger collaboration with another larger brand. Logan and Murray- Leslie published 2 books with Booth-Clibborn Editions, : Chicks on Speed: It's A Project 2005 containing historical pieces of information about the band and their art from their beginning stages onward, including a dress, a DIY pattern to make overalls, designed by Chicks on Speed and Jeremy Scott, a CD of unreleased music and a poster, all together in a tote bag designed by Chicks on Speed. \\"Chicks on Speed Don't Art, Fashion, Music 2011\\". Chicks on Speed's series of what they call ObjectInstruments sees the group shy away from filling the stage with conventional band instruments, they invented their own instruments, which at times double as fashionable stage outfits ‚Äìfor example: Super suits, outfits which remotely trigger audio/video, and an haute couture hat which is a self-contained amplification device. The 2010 exhibition \\"Chicks on Speed Don't, Art, fashion, Music\\" at Dundee Contemporary Arts Centre was their first major solo exhibition in the UK. Chicks on Speed opened with a live art performance for invited guests, featuring the 'e-shoe' ‚Äì the world's first wireless high-heeled shoe guitar, made in collaboration with Milan-based shoe designer Max Kibardin and Hangar.org. These shoes were unveiled alongside Chicks on Speed's ever-growing collection of self made ‚Äòobjektinstruments‚Äô ‚Äì A Theremin Tapestry, cigar-box synthesizers, super suits with sewn-in body sensors that trigger audio/video samples and two hats made in collaboration with Christophe Coppins and Hangar.org, based on illuminated drawings of Hildegard von Bingen, a 12th-century Christian mystic who received visions, composed ethereal airs, performed healings and even founded convents. These hats transmit the utterances of their wearers by way of microphones and speakers. The DCA galleries were further transformed into a giant stage and studio set for making music videos, experimenting with no-choreography and ongoing craft projects live, including loom-weaving inspired by Bauhaus design, lectures and workshops, film screenings of their fashion archive and selected video pieces. Chicks on Speed worked with local and international makers to combine traditional craft with cutting-edge technology. In 2013 & 2014, Chicks on Speed toured their major solo interactive multimedia exhibition SCREAM to global cultural institutions: ArtSpace, Sydney, RMIT Design Hub Melbourne, Fremantle Arts Centre, Perth, Institute of Modern Art, Brisbane and Institute of Contemporary Art, Singapore. Solo activities of the members Melissa E Logan is represented by Gallerie Gisela Clement, Bonn, Germany. The gallery represented a solo booth of Logans painting at the 51st Art Cologne, April 2017. Simultaneously Logan premiered a one-hour sound piece at Schauspiel K√∂ln titles Cetacea. it was performed on three consecutive evenings and is part one of the five part: The Ursula Series, sound works for the post human planet. Cetacea is composed in two versions, one for humans, the other is made in the sound range audible to whales. The section titled Quartetris, started in 2014, is being created by robots for humans to perform mimicking dystopian theory of machines controlling humans. Her first solo exhibition there was April 15, 2016 University of Craft Action Thought, Flags. The exhibition was expanded as a collaborative exhibitions in GRAD, European Center for Art and Debate, Belgrad September 11, 2016. In 2001, Logan, together with Chicks on Speed producer Thies Mynther and chiptune composer Rob Hubbard, released the single \\"Mutants, Here I Am\\" under the band name Plundersonics. Logan composed music for Mathilde ter Heigne and for theatre. Kippenberger written and directed by Angela Richter at Schauspiel K√∂ln. Logan appeared in theater plays by the director Angela Richter Versaut (with costumes by Kate Lloyd-Hughes and Chicks on Speed; at Kampnagel Theatre, Hamburg, 2001), Alles wird in Flammen stehen (Frank Gehry Tower, Hannover, 2001) and a \\"propaganda operette\\" L'Amerique (Hamburg, 2003). L'Amerique's \\"soundtrack\\" (with music by Les Robespierres featuring Melissa Logan) has been released on Chicks on Speed Records in 2004. She has worked with the theater and dance directors Gintersdorfer/Klassen from 2010 on. Die Geselschaft des B√∂sen, Erleide Meine Inspiration are theater productions she has acted in.

In geology, a m√©lange is a large-scale breccia, a mappable body of rock characterized by a lack of continuous bedding and the inclusion of fragments of rock of all sizes, contained in a fine-grained deformed matrix. The m√©lange typically consists of a jumble of large blocks of varied lithologies. Both tectonic and sedimentary processes can form m√©lange. M√©lange occurrences are associated with thrust faulted terranes in orogenic belts. A m√©lange is formed in the accretionary wedge above a subduction zone. The ultramafic ophiolite sequences which have been obducted onto continental crust are typically underlain by a m√©lange. Smaller-scale localized m√©langes may also occur in shear or fault zones, where coherent rock has been disrupted and mixed by shearing forces. Shale matrix m√©lange with clasts of sandstone and greenstone on Marshall's Beach, San Francisco, US Large-scale melanges formed in active continental margin settings generally consist of altered oceanic crustal material and blocks of continental slope sediments in a sheared mudstone matrix. The mixing mechanisms in such settings may include tectonic shearing forces, ductile flow of a water-charged or deformable matrix (such as serpentinite), sedimentary action (such as slumping, gravity-flow, and olistostromal action), or some combination of these. Some larger blocks of rock may be as much as across. Before the advent of plate tectonics in the early 1970s, it was difficult to explain m√©langes in terms of known geological mechanisms. A particularly troubling paradox was the occurrence of blueschist blocks (low temperature and high pressure metamorphic rocks) in direct contact with graywacke (a coarse sandstone with lithic fragments) that was deposited in a sedimentary environment. Examples Examples include the Franciscan Complex along the Coast Ranges of central and northern California and the Bay of Islands ophiolite complex in Newfoundland. The Gwna M√©lange in the UK extends through Anglesey and the Ll≈∑n Peninsula onto Bardsey Island in North Wales. The Northern Palawan melange is distributed in the Philippines' , west coast of Inabamalaki Island, west coast of ; Cudugman Point on Bacuit Bay, and in the Cuyo Group of Islands. It consists of a jumble of various rock types contained in a matrix of grey-green slaty mudstone and siltstone. The Eastern Desert of Egypt is part of the Neoproterozoic Arabian-Nubian Shield and displays different occurrences of Neoproterozoic ophiolitic m√©langes. The m√©langes contain exotic and native blocks and fragments of variable sizes and types set in a sheared and schistose volcaniclastic matrix. The main exotic blocks are ophiolitic and include metamorphosed ultramafic rocks, metagabbros, massive and pillowed metabasalts and pelagic sedimentary rocks. Based on the mode of occurrences of the ophiolitic components and the processes of m√©lange formation, the ophiolitic m√©langes of the Central Eastern Desert are classified and mapped into tectonic m√©lange, olistostrome and olistostromal m√©lange. Both tectonic and sedimentary processes played a major role during m√©lange formation in a back-arc or inter-arc setting.Classification and origin of the Neoproterozoic ophiolitic m√©langes in the Central Eastern Desert of Egypt; Authors: El Bahariya, Gaafar A.

Its derivation, and therefore to some extent its connotation, is similar to m√™l√©e. M√©lange is the modern form of the Old French noun meslance, which comes from the infinitive mesler, meaning \\"to mix\\".

Early life Khan was born in Shibpur village in Brahmanbaria (in present-day Bangladesh). His father, Sabdar Hossain Khan, was a musician. Khan took his first music lessons from his elder brother, Fakir Aftabuddin Khan. At age ten, Khan ran away from home to join a jatra party where he was exposed to a variety of folk genres: jari, sari, baul, bhatiyali, kirtan, and panchali. Khan went to Kolkata, where he met a physician named Kedarnath, who helped him to become a disciple of Gopal Krishna Bhattacharya (also known as Nulo Gopal), a notable musician of Kolkata in 1877. Khan practiced sargam for twelve years under his guidance. After the death of Nulo Gopal, Khan turned to instrumental music. He learned to play many indigenous and foreign musical instruments like sitar, flute, piccolo, mandolin, banjo, etc., from Amritalal Dutt, a cousin of Swami Vivekananda and the music director of the Star Theatre. He learnt to play sanai, naquara, tiquara and jagajhampa from Hazari Ustad and pakhawaj, mridang and tabla from Nandababu. Ali Ahmed referred Allauddin to veena player Wazir Khan. Career Khan (middle) with Abbasuddin Ahmed and Qazi Motahar Hossain (1955) Khan became court musician for the Maharaja of Maihar. Here he laid the foundation of a modern Maihar gharana by developing a number of ragas, combining the bass sitar and bass sarod with more traditional instruments and setting up an orchestra. In 1935, he toured Europe, along with Uday Shankar's ballet troupe, and later also worked at his institute, Uday Shankar India Culture Centre at Almora for a while. In 1955, Khan established a college of music in Maihar. Some of his recordings are made at the All India Radio in 1959‚Äì60. Awards Khan was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1958 and the Padma Vibhushan in 1971, India's third and second highest civilian honours, and prior to that in 1954, the Sangeet Natak Akademi awarded him with its highest honour, the Sangeet Natak Akademi Fellowship for lifetime contribution to Indian music. Legacy Khan on a 1999 stamp of India Khan's son Ali Akbar Khan, daughter Annapurna Devi, nephew Raja Hossain Khan and grandson Aashish Khan went on to become musicians. His other disciples include Ravi Shankar, Nikhil Banerjee, Vasant Rai, Shripad Bandopdhyay, Pannalal Ghosh, Bahadur Khan, Rabin Ghosh, Sharan Rani, Nalin Mazumdar, Jotin Bhattacharya, Rajesh Chandra Moitra and W. D. Amaradeva. Personal life Anecdotes about Khan range from throwing a tabla tuning hammer at the Maharaja himself to taking care of disabled beggars. Nikhil Banerjee said that the tough image was \\"deliberately projected in order not to allow any liberty to the disciple. He was always worried that soft treatment on his part would only spoil them\\". Films * Ustad Alauddin Khan (1963), a documentary directed by Ritwik Ghatak * Raga (1971), directed by Howard Worth.

She was outfitted as a gunboat with heavy guns and used in the Union blockade of the waterways of the Confederate States of America.  Built in Mystic, Connecticut  Albatross was built at Mystic, Connecticut in 1858. She was purchased by the Navy at Brooklyn, New York on 23 May 1861, and commissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 25 June 1861, Commander George A. Prentiss in command.  Civil war operations  = Assigned to the Atlantic blockade = Acquired during the Union Navy's efforts to expand the fleet early in the civil war to carry out the blockade of the Confederate coast established by U.S. President Abraham Lincoln's proclamation of 19 April, Albatross was assigned to the Atlantic Blockading Squadron. She soon sailed for the Virginia Capes, and reported to the squadron's commander, Flag Officer Silas Stringham, at Hampton Roads, Virginia on 1 July 1861. Following a week's service in the Chesapeake Bay along its eastern shore and off the mouth of the Rappahannock River, the steamer rounded Cape Henry on 10 July and proceeded south to waters outside the bar off Hatteras Inlet to assist in sealing off the North Carolina coast. The ship's first action came on 11 July after a Confederate shore battery near Oregon Inlet opened fire on her. She answered with all her guns, knocked out one of the Confederate cannon, and drove the Southern soldiers from the area. Albatross made her first capture on 18 July, when a party from the steamer boarded and seized the schooner Velasco of Galveston, Texas, which was carrying false papers while sailing under the Lone Star flag from Matanzas, Cuba, with a cargo of sugar. Albatross took the prize to Hampton Roads and turned her over to Flag Officer Stringham on 20 July. The next day, while returning to her station, Albatross exchanged fire with the North Carolina steamer Beaufort lying off Bodie Island and forced the Southern ship to retire through Oregon Inlet to safety in Pamlico Sound. = Capturing pirates = \\"Recapture of the Schooner Enchantress by the Gun-boat Albatross\\" (Line engraving published in Harpers Weekly, 1861) On 22 July 1861, while Albatross was chasing a sailing vessel near Hatteras Inlet, a black man jumped overboard and shouted, \\"Save me, captain, she's bound to Charleston.\\" While lowering a boat to pick up the man, Albatross turned her guns on the schooner and ordered her to heave to. That vessel, Enchantress, a schooner of Newburyport, Massachusetts, which had been captured on 6 July by Confederate privateer Jefferson Davis, promptly surrendered. Commander Prentiss, considering the five crewmen captured with the schooner to be pirates, had them put in double irons. He placed Master's Mate Tunis D. Wendell in charge of the prize over a crew consisting of five Union sailors and the rescued man who had been on Enchantress when she surrendered to the Southern privateer. Albatross took the schooner to Hampton Roads where they arrived on 24 July. Since the Union steamer was in need of repairs, Stringham sent the two vessels on to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. En route north on 1 August, a party from Albatross boarded Elizabeth Ann of Accomac, Virginia and bound from Penns Grove, New Jersey, for Chincoteague, Virginia, and, upon finding her papers to be incorrect, seized that vessel and took her in tow. On 2 August, the three ships reached Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where the schooners were turned over to the prize court and Albatross entered the shipyard for repairs. After completion of the machinery work late in the month, the steamer returned to Hampton Roads on the evening of 31 August and began cruising in Chesapeake Bay where she took the schooner Alabama off the mouth of the Potomac River on 14 September. Next ordered back to waters off the outer banks of North Carolina, Albatross, except for periodic runs to Hampton Roads for fuel and provisions and a trip to Baltimore, Maryland, for repairs, operated near Beaufort, North Carolina until April 1862 when she was transferred to the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. = Reassigned to the South Atlantic blockade = The highlight of this stint of service off Beaufort was her discovery and destruction of the grounded 800-ton British ship York of Dublin, Ireland, near Bogue Inlet on 16 January 1862. After reporting to Flag Officer Samuel Francis du Pont, the ship spent May and June in Winyah Bay, South Carolina, blockading Georgetown, South Carolina. There, on 20 June, two boats from Albatross captured the steam tug Treaty and schooner Louisa. = Reassigned to the West Gulf blockade = Early in July 1862, the steamer proceeded to Boston, Massachusetts where she arrived on 10 July for repairs. When ready again for sea, Albatross, commanded by Commander Henry French since 1 August, was reassigned to the West Gulf Blockading Squadron. She stood out to sea on the evening of 7 August and, after reporting to Rear Admiral David Farragut, was stationed off the mouth of the Rio Grande near Brownsville, Texas. There, on 21 September, she captured the schooner Two Sisters of Galveston, Texas, flying the Confederate flag as she was sailing from Sisal, Mexico, toward Galveston with 87 bales of gunny cloth for Southern cotton gins and one case of crinolines, probably intended for a less utilitarian purpose. = Outbreak of yellow fever = Late in September 1862, yellow fever broke out on Albatross. Upon the recommendation of the ship's surgeon, Commander French sailed to Pensacola, Florida, where she arrived on 4 October. Farragut placed the steamer in quarantine, and she was forbidden to communicate with the rest of the squadron. Nevertheless, the admiral reprimanded French for leaving his station before his ship had been properly relieved and, on 29 October, sent him north in with orders to report to Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles. Lieutenant Commander John E. Hart took command of Albatross. After the health of her crew had been restored, the steamer began patrolling off the Gulf of Mexico shore in mid-November. From 24 November until 8 December 1862, boat crews from Albatross and from the armed brig made a series of raids against salt works along the Florida coast between St. Andrews Bay and Pensacola, during which they destroyed over 300 salt pans. = Mississippi River operations = On 11 December 1862, Albatross sailed for the Mississippi River where the tempo of operations to free the river for Union shipping was increasing. On 17 December, she, , , , and supported the uncontested landing of Major General Nathaniel Prentiss Banks' troops at Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Ever since the previous spring, when his thrusts upriver had been nullified by a lack of ground forces, Farragut had been awaiting army support for clearing the Mississippi. After the surrender of Baton Rouge, he was eager to move on to the next Confederate river stronghold, Port Hudson, Louisiana, but no soldiers were made available for the operation. Finally, with the approach of the spring, misfortunes to Rear Admiral David Dixon Porter's Mississippi Squadron, which had been attempting to send some of its gunboats past Vicksburg, Mississippi, to patrol the river between that strongly fortified position and Port Hudson, prompted Farragut to brave the guns of Port Hudson without help from Banks. On the evening of 13 March 1863, he moved seven of his warships - four saltwater men-of-war and three gunboats - some 15 miles above Baton Rouge and anchored for the night. During the next day, he gave careful attention to the readiness of each ship in the force for battle. He had three of the heavy warships lashed to the port and soon-to-be-engaged sides of the smaller gunboats, pairing his flagship, , with Albatross, Richmond with , and with . , proceeding alone, brought up the rear. Farragut later explained his selection of Albatross as Hartford's partner: > Albatross being the most vulnerable of the gunboats, and her speed being > about equal to that of this ship, was assigned to her. ... = Braving the fire of Port Hudson = Shortly after 10:00 p.m., the fleet got underway. Moving up the river \\"in good style,\\" Hartford and Albatross weathered the hail of shot from the batteries. Major General Franklin Gardner, commanding Confederate forces at Port Hudson, noted: \\"She returned our fire boldly.\\" While the flagship and her consort were passing the lower batteries, the current nearly swung the pair around and grounded them; \\"but,\\" Farragut reported, \\"backing the Albatross, and going ahead strong on this ship, we at length headed her up the river.\\" Though able to bring only two guns to bear on the upper batteries, Farragut successfully passed those works. Following the flagship closely, Richmond took a hit in her steam plant, disabling her. \\"The turning point (in the river) was gained,\\" Commander James Alden, Jr. reported, \\"but I soon found, even with the aid of the Genesee, which vessel was lashed alongside, that we could make no headway against the strong current of the river, and suffering much from a galling cross fire of the enemy's batteries, I was compelled though most reluctantly, to turn back, and by the aid of the Genesee soon anchored out of the range of their guns.\\" Next in line, Monongahela ran hard aground under Port Hudson's lower batteries where she remained for nearly half an hour, taking severe punishment. At least eight shots passed entirely through the ship. The bridge was shot from underneath Captain James P. McKinstry, wounding him and killing three others. With Kineo's aid, Monongahela was refloated; and she attempted to resume her course upriver. \\"We were nearly by the principal battery,\\" wrote Lieutenant Nathaniel W. Thomas, the executive officer, \\"when the crank pin of the forward engine was reported heated, and the engine stopped. ...\\" The ship became unmanageable and drifted downstream, where she anchored out of range of the Confederate guns. = USS Mississippi is lost after grounding = Meanwhile, on board Mississippi, Captain Melancton Smith saw Richmond coming downstream but, because of the heavy smoke of the battle, was unable to sight Monongahela. Thinking that she had steamed ahead to close the gap caused by Richmond's leaving the formation, he ordered his ship \\"go ahead fast\\". In attempting to do so, Mississippi ran aground and, despite every effort, could not be brought off. After being set afire in four places, she was abandoned. At 3:00 a.m., Mississippi was seen in flames floating slowly down river; and, two and one- half hours later, she blew up. Thus ended one of the war's fiercest engagements. Only Hartford and Albatross had succeeded in running the gauntlet. Commenting on Albatross' role, Farragut stated, > \\"... although it was not in Lieutenant Commander Hart's power to do much, > still he did all that was in his power, and whenever he could bring a gun to > bear, ahead or astern, on the port side, it was instantly fired.\\" Albatross' > only casualty in the action was Charles Raick, the captain's steward, who > according to the ship's deck log, \\"... was killed while nobly fighting his > gun.\\" But for a Parrott gun which lost a part of its trunnion when struck by a shell, the ship suffered little material damage. = Beyond the reach of Port Hudson's guns = After reaching comparative safety beyond the range of Port Hudson's guns, the two Union warships operated in the stretch of the Mississippi between that Southern fortress and Vicksburg until both of these Confederate riverbank strongholds had fallen almost four months later. While plying these waters which bristled with hostile batteries, they denied the Southern armies fighting in the East the steady flow of men, food, horses, and miscellaneous supplies which had supported Confederate troops since the onset of the conflict. In the middle of March, Albatross engaged the Confederate batteries at Grand Gulf, Mississippi, and suffered one man killed and nine wounded. On 4 May 1863, she attacked the Confederate Fort De Russy and engaged two Confederate steamers moored to the earthworks, CSS Grand Duke and Mary T. = James Brown awarded the Medal of Honor = In the engagement, Grand Duke was set on fire five times and suffered seven wounded, while Albatross was badly shot up and suffered heavy casualties when a 32-pounder ball came through the wheelhouse carrying the wheel away and causing the relieving tackles to be manned by men in plain view of the enemy. Two men from the ship were killed and four wounded. Quartermaster James H. Brown displayed most unusual courage during the action. After the steering wheel and wheel ropes had been shot away, Brown stood on the gun platform of the quarterdeck, exposing himself to close fire from musketry ashore and rendered invaluable assistance by his expert management of the relieving tackles. By doing so, he was instrumental in extricating the vessel from a perilous position and thereby aided in the capture of Fort De Russy's heavy works. Brown later received the Medal of Honor for his valor. = Death of Lt. Commander Hart = In June 1863, while Albatross was stationed above Port Hudson, her captain, John E. Hart, contracted yellow fever. A few days later he became delusional, and on June 11, 1863, he committed suicide in his cabin with his own revolver. He was officially listed as \\"killed in battle\\". His officers were unable to send his body home to Schenectady for burial, and knowing he would wish a Masonic burial, Executive Officer Theodore B. Du Bois went ashore under a flag of truce to ask if there were any Masons in the area who would conduct a funeral. They were put in contact with Confederate Army Captain William Walter Leake, a company commander with the 1st Louisiana Cavalry, who was home on furlough. Leake was Senior Warden of Feliciana Lodge No. 31 in the nearby town of St. Francisville, Louisiana, and he made arrangements for Hart to be buried at Grace Episcopal Church there. A truce was arranged so that the Union officers could bring his body ashore, attend the funeral, and return to their ship to resume their blockade. A joint party of Union and Confederate officers, all Masons, participated in the funeral on June 12, 1863; Leake himself conducted the Masonic service. The event is now commemorated in St. Francisville every June as \\"The Day the War Stopped\\". Du Bois, with the rank of Acting Volunteer Lieutenant Commander, took over command of Albatross for the duration of the war. = Repair and quarantine = Following the surrender of Port Hudson on 9 July, Albatross dropped down river and briefly operated on patrol out of New Orleans before beginning a repair period which lasted until mid-September when the ship joined the blockading forces off Mobile Bay. A month later, yellow fever was again raging and compelled the ship to be placed in quarantine at Pensacola. = Returned to the Gulf blockade = When again ready for duty, Albatross served as a dispatch vessel, then returned to blockade duty off Mobile, Alabama. Late in the year, she resumed cruising in the Gulf of Mexico. On 9 January 1864, the ship shelled a large steamer lying under the guns of Fort Morgan, Alabama, at the entrance to Mobile Bay. Thereafter, other than periods of repairs, she alternated blockade duty with dispatch service until 21 May 1864 when she was ordered north for major repairs at the Portsmouth Navy Yard where she was decommissioned on 6 June. Recommissioned on the day after Christmas 1864, the steamer was ordered back to the West Gulf Blockading Squadron. However, while sailing south, she encountered \\"... a fierce storm some 100 miles south of Cape Cod and was severely damaged, losing her smokestack and her top foremast. Her boats were also badly battered.\\" Proceeding \\"with the aid of sails and what small amount of steam we could make without a pipe,\\" the ship managed to reach the Delaware River breakwater and entered the Philadelphia Navy Yard for repairs. When once more seaworthy, she headed for the gulf and was stationed at Mobile where she served through the end of the war.  Post-war sale and subsequent maritime career  Following the collapse of the Confederacy, Albatross sailed to the Boston Navy Yard where she was decommissioned on 11 August 1865. She was sold at public auction there on 8 September 1865 to C. P. Stickney. Redocumented on 23 September 1865, the ship operated in merchant service until her engines were removed in 1888, and she was dropped from shipping registers.

It continues the story, started in Florida Roadkill, of blithe psychopath Serge A. Storms and his pursuit of five million dollars in cash hidden in the trunk of a car. The book is non-linear, with some scenes occurring at the same time chronologically but told out of order with later scenes. One set of characters is a group of commissioners from Lausanne, Switzerland, lured to Tampa as part of the city's real-life (and historically unsuccessful) bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics. Plot summary Like the previous novel, Hammerhead Ranch Motel begins in media res, with two murders and one apparent suicide, the events leading up to which are eventually explored in the remainder of the novel. Serge A. Storms succeeds in tracking down the car with the briefcase containing $5 million in the trunk, and steals it while its drivers, Sean and David, have gotten out of the car to watch the progress of a wildfire. Later, he checks into the Hammerhead Ranch Motel in Tampa Bay to lay low, but his car is stolen by a trio of car thieves. The Motel's owner is a gangster named Zargoza (who legally changed his name from Harvey Fiddlebottom). Over the next few days, the briefcase changes hands several times, from the car thieves to the petty criminals who overheard the thieves bragging about finding it, to a pair of hapless college students hired by the thieves to drive their car across the state, to Zargoza's sometime-partners, the reckless Diaz Boys, and finally Zargoza himself. Several of these handlers are tracked down and killed, either by Serge or the Diaz Boys, but only Serge follows the trail to Zargoza. After determining that the briefcase is no longer in the trunk of the car, Serge drives it to the top of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, torches it with a Molotov cocktail, then leaps from the bridge with a parachute and dressed in a Santa Claus outfit (the act mistakenly seen as a suicide in the prologue). On the same night, one of the college students plunges to his death after being interrogated by the Diaz Boys, onto the glass roof of the Florida Aquarium. The gruesome nature of the recent deaths drives Zargoza nearly insane from paranoia, and he changes the hiding place of the briefcase several times. Deciding that a more subtle approach is required with Zargoza, Serge partners with a Don Johnson-impersonator named Lenny Lipowicz, who owns a real moon rock from a 1970s space mission. The two befriend Zargoza and the trio spend several weeks touring Florida tourist attractions, with Serge waiting for Zargoza to let slip where the briefcase is. Three subplots intersect with the main story and lead up to the novel's climax: *City and Country, two young women from Alabama, are on the run after a girl accidentally stabbed herself to death in their presence, with the steak knife she was snorting cocaine from. Believing themselves suspect in the woman's death, City and Country steal her car and flee to Florida, where they meet Serge and Lenny, quickly becoming addicted to Lenny's pot and Serge's bottomless supply of Florida history and trivia. *Aristotle \\"Art\\" Tweed is falsely diagnosed with a terminal illness (a practical joke by the bored teenage daughter of an employee at his local hospital) and, after meeting a Hemingway impersonator named Jethro Maddox, decides to redeem himself by killing the worst bully he can find. At first he targets \\"Boris the Hateful Piece of Sh**\\", a Tampa shock jock leading the public outcry in favor of Florida's newest anti-immigration legislation, but Serge kills Boris first after the latter's lewd advances against City and Country. Meanwhile, the hospital's insurer hires a private investigator named Paul to track down Art and inform him about the hoax. *The crew of an Air Force C-130 Hercules based at Keesler Air Force Base tracks the development and progress of Hurricane Rolando-berto in the Gulf of Mexico. The Air Force's attempt to liaise with the local media goes disastrously wrong when anchorman Blaine Crease, riding in the plane over the hurricane's eye, insists on pitching a cylindrical weather sensor out of an open hatchway while being filmed, which causes his network's beloved mascot, \\"Toto the Dancing Weatherdog\\" to leap after the \\"stick\\" and out the hatchway to plummet to his death. When the hurricane unexpectedly changes direction and makes landfall at Tampa, all the characters are trapped inside the Hammerhead Ranch Motel. Zargoza's \\"fall guy\\", a washed-up rock musician named C.C. Flag, believing that he's about to be arrested for his complicity in Zargoza's crimes, takes a young boy hostage, but Art saves the boy and both Flag and the local community's xenophobic mayor, Malcolm Kefauver, are blown out to sea by the hurricane. Serge and Zargoza finally confront each other over the money, but Zargoza is distracted when Jethro, whose participation in \\"The Flying Hemingway\\"'s skydiving stunt left him stranded in a tree, crashes through the Motel's roof. Country protects Serge by shooting Zargoza, who dies before Serge can convince him to confess where the money is hidden. Art learns the truth from Paul and is befriended by the attractive single mother of the boy whose life he saved. Watching the post-hurricane news, Serge sees the briefcase in the possession of Paul, leaving Tampa with Jethro, who happened to witness (from his tree perch) Zargoza hiding the briefcase for the last time. Serge frees Lenny from a local chain gang and, with City and Country in tow, takes off after the money once again. = Johnny Vegas = Several of Dorsey's novels features one or more failed attempts by his recurring character, Johnny Vegas, to finally lose his virginity. In this novel, Johnny has traded in the Cigarette boat he was using in Florida Roadkill, and instead trolls for available women in a Porsche convertible. *He succeeds in luring an aspiring model, who gives her name as \\"If\\" into his car, and is about to have sex with her on the passenger seat, while the car is parked at the top of a bridge, only to be interrupted when she notices Serge torching his car and jumping from the bridge, an act mistaken by all the onlookers for a suicide. To cap off his failure, while they are watching from the bridge rail, a semi truck flattens his Porsche. *He picks up a spokesmodel in South Beach and, in order to be absolutely sure of success, drives her to a motel in Everglades City, only to be interrupted by a rash of wildfires that forces them to evacuate, in spite of his fervent wish to remain and complete his conquest. *Johnny rents a room at the Hammerhead Ranch Motel for himself and his latest date, but she is so terrified by the noise of the hurricane that she locks herself in the bathroom. *The novel's epilogue features three separate failures by Johnny: **Johnny is hiking in a park with an avid bird-watcher, when he mistakenly insults her by comparing her unfavorably to girls with tattoos, not knowing she has one; **Johnny unexpectedly gets another chance with If, who asks him to be her date for a local broadcast journalism awards banquet, with a promise of sex after she wins; the evening is ruined when a disgruntled former state safety employee who witnessed Serge's jump from the bridge shoots at the copy editor who composed the headline that led to his firing. **Johnny is so frustrated that he beats up the gunman on camera; later he is picked up in a bar by a statuesque blonde who thinks he's a hero and offers to sleep with him, but (based on her reference to the film The Crying Game and the fact that Johnny's \\"losing streak\\" remains unbroken in the following novels) is hinted to actually be a man in drag.

It may co-occur as vulvovaginitis with vaginitis, inflammation of the vagina, and may have infectious or non-infectious causes. The warm and moist conditions of the vulva make it easily affected. Vulvitis is prone to occur in any female especially those who have certain sensitivities, infections, allergies, or diseases that make them likely to have vulvitis. Postmenopausal women and prepubescent girls are more prone to be affected by it, as compared to women in their menstruation period. It is so because they have low estrogen levels which makes their vulvar tissue thin and dry. Women having diabetes are also prone to be affected by vulvitis due to the high sugar content in their cells, increasing their vulnerability. Vulvitis is not a disease, it is just an inflammation caused by an infection, allergy or injury. Vulvitis may also be symptom of any sexually transmitted disease or a fungal infection.  Causes  Vulvitis may be caused by the following reasons: # Allergies or sensitivities towards certain products like - coloured or perfumed toilet papers, vaginal sprays or douches, shampoos and hair conditioners, laundry detergents, creams or medications. # Reactions to - bubble bath or soaps used on genital area, spermicides, sanitary napkins. # Irritations caused by - a yeast infection, chlorinated water in swimming pools or hot tubs, synthetic underwear or nylon pantyhose without a breathable cotton crotch, wearing a wet bathing suit for a long time, bike or horseback riding, douching, poor personal hygiene, incontinence, by urine or stool if it remains in contact with the vulva (as may occur in women who have incontinence or are confined to bed), contact with urine and stool sometimes cause ongoing (chronic) vulvitis. # Infections such as - vaginitis, genital herpes, viral and fungal infection. # Factors such as - Diabetes, scabies or pubic lice, eczema or dermatitis, oral sex.  Symptoms and signs The symptoms of vulvitis are: # Extreme and constant itching # A burning sensation in the vulvar area # Vaginal discharge # Small cracks on the skin of the vulva # Redness and swelling on the vulva and labia (lips of the vagina) # clear fluid-filled Blisters on the vulva # Scaly, thick, whitish patches on the vulva # Bumps or warts # Soreness # Pain with sex # Increased sensitivity when wiping with toilet paper Symptoms of vulvitis may also be an indication of other diseases or disorders. A doctor should be consulted when one is having any of these symptoms. The symptoms may vary on depending on the cause and the time period it has been infected for.  Diagnosis  Vulvitis can have many different causes which makes the diagnosis difficult. The diagnosis of vulvitis starts with examining the medical history and pelvic examination of the person affected by it. Other diagnostic tools like pap smears, urine tests, blood tests and tests for sexually transmitted diseases are also done.  In children  Vulvitis, inflammation of the vulva, can have a variety of etiologies in children and adolescents, including allergic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, lichen sclerosus, and infections with bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Dermatitis in infants is commonly caused by a soiled diaper being left on for an extended period of time. Increasing the frequency of diaper changes and topical application of emollients are sufficient to resolve most cases. Dermatitis of the vulva in older children is usually caused by exposure to an irritant (e.g. scented products that come into contact with the vulva, laundry detergent, soaps, etc.) and is treated with preventing exposure and encouraging sitz baths with baking soda as the vulvar skin heals. Other treatment options for vulvar dermatitis include oral hydroxyzine hydrochloride or topical hydrocortisone. Lichen sclerosus is another common cause of vulvitis in children, and it often affects an hourglass or figure eight-shaped area of skin around the anus and vulva. Symptoms of a mild case include skin fissures, loss of skin pigment (hypopigmentation), skin atrophy, a parchment- like texture to the skin, dysuria, itching, discomfort, and excoriation. In more severe cases, the vulva may become discolored, developing dark purple bruising (ecchymosis), bleeding, scarring, attenuation of the labia minora, and fissures and bleeding affecting the posterior fourchette. Its cause is unknown, but likely genetic or autoimmune, and it is unconnected to malignancy in children. If the skin changes are not obvious on visual inspection, a biopsy of the skin may be performed to acquire an exact diagnosis. Treatment for vulvar lichen sclerosus may consist of topical hydrocortisone in mild cases, or stronger topical steroids (e.g. clobetasol propionate). Preliminary studies show that 75% of cases do not resolve with puberty. Organisms responsible for vulvitis in children include pinworms (Enterobius vermicularis), Candida yeast, and group A hemolytic Streptococcus. Though pinworms mainly affect the perianal area, they can cause itching and irritation to the vulva as well. Pinworms are treated with albendazole. Vulvar Candida infections are uncommon in children, and generally occur in infants after antibiotic therapy, and in children with diabetes or immunodeficiency. Candida infections cause a red raised vulvar rash with satellite lesions and clear borders, and are diagnosed by microscopically examining a sample treated with potassium hydroxide for hyphae. They are treated with topical butoconazole, clotrimazole, or miconazole. Streptococcus infections are characterized by a dark red discoloration of the vulva and introitus, and cause pain, itching, bleeding, and dysuria. They are treated with antibiotics.  Zoon vulvitis (Plasma cell vulvitis)  This is an uncommon, benign condition which was originally described in the glans penis of older men but has a counterpart in women under a variety of terms (Zoon vulvitis, vulvitis circumscripta plasmacellularis, plasmacytosis mucosae). Most patients are adult, in reproductive age or postmenopausal (age range 26‚Äì70 years). Lesions on the vulva are usually asymptomatic, composed of solitary or multiple, sharply defined, red-brown,shiny patches which frequently exhibit a speckled and hemorrhagic surface. Ulceration commonly supervenes. Treatment includes topical steroids for symptomatic relief. Rarely excision for refractory lesions. Microscopic Findings: # Dense plasma cell-rich band-like infiltrate in papillary and upper reticular dermis # Spongiotic epidermis with absent stratum granulosum and stratum corneum # ‚ÄúLozenge‚Äù-shaped configuration of superficial keratinocytes # Vascular proliferation in superficial submucosa with red cell extravasation and/or hemosiderin  References  Category:Inflammatory diseases of female pelvic organs ","title":"Vulvitis"},{"id":"2150808","text":"Cadillac Beach is the sixth novel written by Tim Dorsey, published in 2004. Plot summary The year is 1996. At long last, Serge A. Storms has been captured. He is committed to the psychiatric hospital at Chattahoochee, where he patiently tries to explain his views. Serge grows tired of this diversion, however, and escapes once more. His newest obsession involves investigating the circumstances surrounding his grandfather's death forty years earlier, when he allegedly committed suicide by wandering into the ocean at a Miami beach. Serge's grandfather, who passed on many of his habits and interests (as well as his mental instability) to his grandson, may have been involved with a lucrative jewel theft shortly before his disappearance, however, so his friends are understandably reluctant to talk. The novel then skips forward eight years and over the previous novels in the series to 2004, where Serge is living with his friend Lenny and Lenny's mother while planning a phantasmagoric array of projects, the biggest of which is still to solve the matter of his grandfather's supposed suicide. To finance his quest, Serge and Lenny start up a unique tour service highlighting the \\"lesser known\\" side of Florida's tourism industry. During one of his tours, a group of drunken convention attendees accidentally kidnap and kill a mob boss. The mobster in question just happens to be one that Serge personally insulted a few days earlier, incurring the wrath of both the mob and the FBI. Serge decides to keep close tabs on the salesmen for their own protection, not letting them leave his sight. Somehow, he also finds the time to publicly embarrass the Castro regime of Cuba and the United States government at the same time. Tagging along in Serge's deathmarch/tour are Lenny, a newspaper columnist from New York City, a friend of Serge's grandfather's named Chi Chi, and City and Country, a pair of dim-witted women that Serge ditched at the beginning of The Stingray Shuffle, in 1998.

He was born early in the sixth century, near the beginning of the reign of Justinian, Emperor of the East. Justinian kidnapped the infant Nathan, fearing that his wife would not give birth to a healthy male heir. When this fear proved unfounded, the Emperor gave the baby to a childless Jewish couple. Eventually, baby Nathan was returned to his rightful parents, but he had already been circumcised and given a Jewish name: Nathan. This in addition to his already mixed Scandinavian-Greek ancestry. In the strip, he is currently in his early teens but has already traveled through much of the known and unknown world with his family and others. He has courage and wisdom beyond his years, besides scientific knowledge and curiosity, and rare artistic talents. He is a slim and handsome youth with flaming-red hair. Recent adventures In the strip's episodes published in late 2005 and early 2006, Nathan helped to save the life of a Loch Ness Monster (see Loch Ness Monster in popular culture) and was captured by Viking pirates. His father helped him escape from the Viking captivity. On his way to Camelot, Nathan found his friend Sir Gawain. With his help he was able to reach Camelot and rejoin his mother, who immediately began organizing a mission to find and rescue Valiant. The expedition consisted of the Queen, Nathan, Gawain, and a few trustworthy, brave and hardy veteran knights. The expedition succeeded in finding Valiant in Africa.

It is within the historic Parish of Reay and the historic county of Caithness. The village is on the A836 road some west of the town of Thurso and west of Dounreay. Along with Thurso the village grew dramatically in the mid-20th century with the development of the experimental nuclear power facility at Dounreay, where technologies such as fast breeder reactors were developed. The last force-fire in Reay occurred about 1830.  Toponymy  The origin of the name is uncertain, but possibilities include the Gaelic Reidh (a flat place) or Ratha (a fort or enclosure). Possibilities from Norse include Ra (a boundary marker) or Vra (a nook or corner). Another possibility is the word Ra, a now obsolete word for the yardarm of a boat. A prehistoric mound at the west end of the beach is called Cnocstanger, which means pole hill.  History  The area around the village has been occupied for millennia. Within the modern village are the remains of a stone circle, several Viking houses and burials, the site of a Bronze Age settlement and a mound which contains the layered remains of several Simple Atlantic Roundhouses. The church in Reay, which is still in use, was built in 1739 to a highly unusual T-plan, and is now a category A listed building. The village contains the remains of a far earlier church, dating from the 16th century but on an ancient dedication to St Colman, along with its small, walled graveyard. The existent remains of this old church include a 9th-century cross slab. Although there are none actually within the village, the Parish of Reay contains the remains of several brochs. In 1437, the MacKays defeated the men of Caithness at Sandside Bay in the battle known as the Sandside Chase, turning there on the pursuers that had chased them away from an attempted raid. The parish of Reay was originally partly in the county of Caithness and partly in the county of Sutherland. However, in 1891 the parish boundaries changed so that the portion of the parish of Reay that was in Sutherland was disjoined and became part of the parish of Farr in Sutherland.http://www.scotlandsplaces.gov.uk/hay_shennan/pdfs/caithness- boundaries.pdf Sandside House on the edge of the village is a mansion house with extensive grounds dating from 1751. It was previously owned by Thomas Pilkington, who founded Reay Village Golf Club. Geography The parish includes the hamlets of Fresgoe, Islaud and Shebster, which are close to the boundary between Caithness and the neighbouring county of Sutherland. The parish had a parish council from 1894 to 1930, and has two neighbouring parishes in Caithess: the Parish of Thurso to the east and the Parish of Halkirk to the south. Dounreay is within the parish. Sandside Bay is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. It is recognised by surfers as being home to a powerful high quality left-hand reef break. This, however, is extremely fickle, and requires very particular wind, swell, and tide conditions to come into shape. The break is also notorious for being very rocky, shallow, and dangerous, such is the irregular form of the reef upon which the wave breaks. Local shop Sandside Bay in August 2006One of the main environmental issues caused by the Dounreay Nuclear Power Development Establishment are radioactive nuclear fuel particles that have been released from the site into the sea, and are now on the seabed near the plant and in Sandside Bay. Some of these are being washed ashore, including a small number on the privately owned Sandside Bay beach which is open to the public and is part of the Sandside Estate. The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs committed to clean up and open oversight of the work on 25 October 2006. The Dounreay Particles Advisory Group recommended that the particle monitoring frequency of the beach should be increased to fortnightly. . The 13th Laird of Sandside the Duke of Portland took the Government to Court to assert his ownership down to the low watermark of the estate granted by a barony of 1628 and won. The 19th Laird of Sandside since 1991, Geoffrey Minter, following the radioactive contamination beginning in 1997, took the Government owned UKAEA to court in 2003 and won, beyond appeal, a judicial review in Scotland's highest court proving radioactive damage to the estate's land and the UKAEA to be in breach of its statutory duty under the Nuclear Installations Act. UKAEA's contractors now regularly monitor the beach due to a permanent agreement with the landowner.  Local government  The village is within the Thurso and Northwest Caithness ward of the Highland Council. The ward elects four councillors by the single transferable vote system of election, which produces a form of proportional representation. It is one of seven wards within the council's Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross corporate management area and one of 22 wards within the council area.

As with Dorsey's previous works, the main character is amateur Florida historian and serial killer Serge A. Storms. Plot summary The book takes place mainly in the Florida Keys, where Serge heads to \\"reinvent himself\\". After flirting with becoming the next Jimmy Buffett (undaunted by a total lack of musical talent), he finally decides to marry. All he has to do is find the right woman. Given Serge's personality (a mixture of bizarre topic-hopping as his attention drifts and his penchant for brutal honesty), this proves quite a challenge. And somehow, he's picked up a legion of devoted followers continually begging him for pearls of wisdom. After briefly courting a few unwilling prospects, he falls in love at first sight with Molly, a new hire at the local library. She initially seems to be stereotypically meek and prim, but is won over when she inadvertently watches Serge beat a man to death for insulting her. She agrees to his hastily scheduled wedding (held during an underwater concert) and quickly proves to be more than a match for Serge's formidable libido. He is quickly baffled by the intricacies of a \\"normal\\" relationship, however, and his bride resents all the time he spends with his dim-bulb pal Coleman. Arguments and cold silences follow. With all of this frustration, Serge barely notices the brown Duster following him or the repeated attempts on his life. Meanwhile, the regulars at the No Name Pub are vexed by Gaskin Fussels, an obnoxious rich loudmouth who flies down to the Keys every weekend to \\"whoop it up\\". They ignore him as best they can until Fussels, obliviously following a half-joking suggestion, steals and accidentally destroys a prized possession of the local viciously psychotic drug lord obsessed with the movie Scarface. Simultaneously, downtrodden waitress Anna discovers that her abusive husband has been murdered, along with her brother and his wife. She flees for her life, trying to decide whom to trust and how to free herself from the trouble in which she suddenly finds herself. She finds an ally, and later a lover, in Jerry, the desperate-to-be-liked bartender at the No Name Pub. Gus is a deputy in a small police station. Gus can't escape his mocking nickname of Serpico or the humiliations his ex-wife heaped on him, both of which his partner Walter is happy to mention. Suddenly the fax starts spitting out bulletins about possible serial killers headed their way and dangerous cars to be on the lookout for. A slimy ex-CEO, recently tried for improprieties that robbed thousands of people of their retirement funds (in an apparent reference to the Enron scandal), decides to spread a little \\"goodwill\\" around the Keys. But he is obviously buying people's support before announcing his plans to obscure some of Florida's most beautiful shoreline with condominiums. Legally, he should have lost nearly all his wealth, but thanks to the quasi-legal dealings of his equally slimy lawyers, he is still spending other people's money and living the good life. In the end, of course, very few people are who they seem and identities are unmasked as all the plot threads come crashing together. Molly is a serial killer even more deranged than Serge, Fussels is a fed investigating Jerry (who is actually \\"Scarface\\"), and Anna and Gus find themselves in possession of a solid gold boat anchor worth millions. Notes Torpedo Juice marks the return of Seymour \\"Coleman\\" Bunsen, Serge's drug- and alcohol-abusing friend. Although Coleman was apparently killed in Florida Roadkill, he seems to be a favorite character of author Dorsey; he appeared in Triggerfish Twist (set in between chapters of Roadkill). The book's self- referential narrator, who sets the book as a production much like a motion picture or television show with actors portraying characters, claims that Coleman wanted out of the series before it hit big, then realized his mistake and begged for a return. The excuse for his reappearance is admittedly, although intentionally, weak; it was \\"a visiting friend\\" wearing Coleman's clothes who died in a vicious hail of gunfire during the events of Roadkill.

KNRJ is licensed to Cordes Lakes, Arizona, which is 66 miles north of Phoenix. KNRJ is owned by Sierra H Broadcasting. Its studios are located on Indian School Road in Phoenix, and its transmitter is in Crown King. History =Loop 101= The first attempt to put a station on the air on 101.1 in Payson failed. A group had a construction permit for KRMM, but that never got on the air and the construction permit lapsed. Another group applied for the frequency and was more successful. In the late 1990s, KESP-FM signed on from Payson as a classic hits format station named Loop 101. In 2000, the callsign was changed to KAZL (K AriZona Loop), and K224CJ 92.7 FM from South Mountain and K292DF 106.3 FM (now K228XO 93.5 FM) in Flagstaff were applied for and signed on during the same period. The station's goal was to be an alternative to KSLX-FM, another classic hits station serving the Phoenix area. KNRJ, K224CJ, and K292DF never achieved sufficient ratings. The dismal ratings were followed by a format change at 5 pm on June 18, 2002: KAZL began stunting with all-commercials (\\"All Commercials, All the Time, KAZL\\"). Steven Szalay, operations manager, an established A/V producer and stockholder in Sierra H Broadcasting, Inc, created an entire radio format complete with sweepers, liners, ID's and live DJ comments as well as a collection of classic radio commercials- his \\"theory\\" was that since all the most popular stations played many commercials, a station that played commercials all the time would shoot to the top in no time. The station received many calls asking if this was serious; some called to express their appreciation of the joke, and some believed it pleading and demanding that the classic hits format be returned. =Energy 92.7 and 101.1= Three days later, at 5 pm on June 21, 2002, KAZL switched to Dance Top 40, branded as \\"Energy 92-7 & 101-1\\". The first song on \\"Energy\\" was \\"The Launch\\" by DJ Jean. KNRJ was considered a clone of WKIE in Chicago; both were programmed and consulted by Chris Shebel until WKIE was sold and changed to a Spanish format in early 2003. KNRJ was also a reporter in Billboard Magazine's Dance/Mix Show Airplay panel. Energy 92.7 & 101.1 KNRJ's dance music product included house, trance, and club music, as well as remixes of pop and R&B; hits. The first personality to be live on-air was KEDJ's \\"Pistol Pete\\", who took the afternoon day part. Shortly thereafter, Lysa D. became evening host. In January 2004, Alex Santa Maria (at the time, PD of KNRJ's sister station, KAJM) took over the programming reins as well as becoming the voice of morning drive. The first mixshow to air on the station was a syndicated version of Paul Oakenfold's International BPM Sundays Nights. After months of promoting the station, evening personality Lysa D. launched live mixshows, including the Friday Night Funky Mix and GrooveSessionz, which aired weekend evenings. With the thought of expanding the station's reputation in the dance world, Lysa featured exclusive interviews and mixes from the likes of Bad Boy Bill and Richard Vission, as well as local talent, such as Rob Wegner, Kevin Brown and Pete Salas. In March 2003, Santa Maria brought in DJ Perry for mixing duties during the Rewind Lunch (which ran until early 2004), and then later recruited DJ Shy, who had a short-lived morning show. Around the same time, Greggy D and Randy became afternoon show hosts, with Pistol Pete moving to mornings. In May 2004, programming authority had changed, as well as the station's playlist. \\"Mike O\\", program director of Internet radio station \\"Energy 98\\", took the crown as KNRJ's new program director and afternoon host (while letting go of Greggy D and Randy), and attempted to improve the station with his format he used on \\"Energy\\" (which was merged with KNRJ's while Energy 98's website redirected to KNRJ's website). Months later, Pistol Pete left for Los Angeles, and Lysa D. took over mornings with her show titled \\"The Morning Frenzy\\". More mixshows and some syndicated radio talent would be featured, including Richard Dalton, Joe Bermudez, DJ Perry (Middays), Victor Dinaire, Roger Sanchez, Justin Dohman, Rod Carrillo, and many more. In summer 2005, Mike O was let go, and returned to programming \\"Energy 98\\". Rod Carrillo took over programming KNRJ, and Beau Duran (who previously worked weekends and evenings under Mike) took over afternoons. But a few months later, Rod also gained control of KAJM and let go of his MD Lysa D (who was on both stations), in addition to Beau Duran, and the station became mostly jockless. The unhosted morning show was titled More Music Mornings, while the unhosted mid-day show was called More Music Mid-Days. However, that didn't help ratings, and it was later decided to bring back Pistol Pete as afternoon host. On October 31, 2007, KNRJ began stunting, playing Wall of Voodoo's \\"Mexican Radio\\", Front 242's \\"Headhunter\\", and Ministry's \\"(Every Day Is) Halloween\\" along with commercials, the normal legal ID with voiceover Harry Legg saying \\"KNRJ Payson/Phoenix, 92.7 K227CJ Phoenix, 106.3 K292DF Flagstaff\\", and a white man speaking in Spanglish saying, \\"Friends, please excuse the music which you hear on 92.7 and 101.1. Tune in tomorrow at 10 o'clock in the morning for more information. Thank you.\\" At 10 AM on November 1, 2007, KNRJ played the Mexican Hat Dance three times, and then KNRJ was relaunched with Beau Duran saying that \\"Energy is back, and new and improved\\". The changes that took place included the return of Beau Duran as MD/Mid-day host, Pistol Pete remaining in afternoons, recorded mix shows were added in overnights (\\"High Energy After Dark\\" featuring Carl Cox, Armin van Buuren, Markus Schulz, Spencer Thomas, Eddie Amador, Mickey \\"Mixin\\" Oliver (of \\"Chicago's Hot Mix 5\\"), and many others), the station playlist was completely revamped, and all new jingles were produced without long time Energy voice over veteran Harry Legg; instead, he was replaced by Mitch Craig, a similar-sounding person. In April 2008, Rod Carrillo was let go, and Beau Duran took over as program director for the remainder of the format. After a few months, the station still struggled in the ratings (mainly due to the constant musical and airstaff adjustments over the years, and the lack of support from management for over two years). Beau Duran was then forced to take the station in a different direction. =The Beat= \\"Energy\\" signed off at 5 pm on October 31, 2008, with Depeche Mode's \\"Enjoy The Silence\\" as the last song. Translator K257CD 99.3 FM then began simulcasting KNRJ (as former simulcast partner KAJM now had adequate Phoenix area coverage on 104.3), and KNRJ launched a stunt format that started with a man saying \\"This is KNRJ Payson. If you're looking for Arizona's Old School, you need to hike it on over to Mega 104.3. The Valley will be in the Zone, Monday morning at 9:27 AM; right now though, I found this guy's iPod. Let's see what's on it.\\" and then played U2's \\"Pride (In The Name Of Love)\\". KNRJ's stunt format included many different songs from different genres as well as an announcer announcing that a new format will be coming to the Valley. Each announcement mentioned a different radio station, some of which were legacy names (e.g. \\"Y\\" for KYOT, which used to be KOY-FM/\\"Y-95\\"). At exactly the promised time on November 3, 2008, KNRJ switched to old school hip hop as 92.7 & 99.3 The Beat, with the first song being Ice Cube's \\"You Know How We Do It\\". At first, they were the only known all old-school hip hop station on terrestrial radio up until KDAY in Los Angeles relaunched their old school hip hop format in August 2009. KNRJ primarily played old school hip hop from the 1980s and 1990s, and some hip hop songs from the early 2000s. In 2011, Fred Rico was named the new program director of KNRJ. The music director was Ramses Ja. Since these changes have been made, newer hits had found their way onto KNRJ's playlist. In March 2012, KNRJ completed its signal upgrade and changed its city-of-license to Cordes Lakes. When the old transmitter near Payson went silent, K228XO in Flagstaff, at the same time, stopped simulcasting KNRJ, and began simulcasting KAFF. In May 2012, KNRJ stopped airing on K224CJ (92.7 FM), as they have now have enough coverage with 101.1. East Valley Institute of Technology's KVIT is using K224CJ to expand their coverage into the Phoenix Metropolitan Area. With this, the station rebranded as \\"99.3 & 101.1 The Beat\\". In November 2012, K257CD (99.3 FM) went silent, and upon resuming broadcast in January 2013, it began simulcasting KFNN. With this, the station rebranded again, this time as \\"101.1 The Beat\\"' In May 2013, KNRJ was added to Mediabase's Rhythmic panel due to a shift to a current-based presentation, putting it in direct competition with both KZON and KKFR. Despite incorporating more current focused hits, the station overall retains a predominant classic hip hop direction. By late 2017, KNRJ would complete its evolution to a current-based rhythmic, initially under the moniker of \\"Hip-Hop and Hits\\", and now \\"Arizona's Hip-Hop Station.\\" References External links * Official website NRJ Category:Rhythmic contemporary radio stations in the United States Category:1998 establishments in Arizona Category:Radio stations established in 1998 ","title":"KNRJ"},{"id":"2150847","text":"ASUE may refer to: ;ASUE *ASUE (Germany) - Germany's Association for the Efficient and Environmentally Friendly Use of Energy. *Arizona State University's Eastern campus *A Series of Unfortunate Events, a children's book series written by Lemony Snicket. ;Asue *Alfred Asue, a bishop from Equatorial Guinea *Awyu-asue, a language of West Papua *Sou-sou, or Esusu, a traditional method of saving money in Africa and the West Indies ","title":"ASUE"},{"id":"2150852","text":"sipXecs is an open-source enterprise communications system.Enterprise Communications System It was initially developed as a proprietary voice over IP telephony server in 2003 by Pingtel Corporation in Boston, MA, and later extended with additional collaboration capabilities in the SIPfoundry project. Its core feature is a software implementation of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), which makes it an IP based communications system (IP PBX). sipXecs is often compared to other open source telephony and softswitch solutions such as Asterisk, FreeSWITCH, and the SIP Express Router, but the design of sipXecs is substantially different from Asterisk and FreeSWITCH. History Development of sipXecs was started in 2003 by Pingtel Corp, a Boston, MA based venture backed company. In 2004, Pingtel adopted an open- source business model and contributed the codebase to the not-for-profit organization SIPfoundry. It has been an open source project since then. Pingtel's assets were acquired by Bluesocket in July 2007. In August 2008 the Pingtel assets were acquired from Bluesocket by Nortel. Subsequent to the acquisition by Nortel, Nortel released the SCS500 product based on sipXecs. SCS500 was positioned as an open and software-only telephony server for the SMB market up to 500 users and received some recognition. It was later renamed SCS and positioned as an Enterprise Communications System. Subsequent to the Nortel bankruptcy and the acquisition of the Nortel assets by Avaya, Avaya has backed away from SCS in an effort to rationalize its product portfolio post acquisition of Nortel. The sipXecs solution continued to be used as the basis for the Avaya Live cloud based communications service. In April 2010 the founders of SIPfoundry founded . commercialized the sipXecs solution in close cooperation with SIPfoundry and the open source community. sipXecs is typically deployed by enterprises wanting to replace a traditional private branch exchange (PBX) with a software-based solution that can be produced in a cloud environment. In addition to telephony features, sipXecs offers collaboration capabilities such as enterprise instant messaging and conferencing. Design philosophy sipXecs is designed as a software-only, distributed cloud application. It runs on the Linux operating system CentOS or RHEL on either virtualized or physical servers. A minimum configuration allows running all of the sipXecs components on a single server, including database, all available services, and the sipXecs management. Global clusters can be built using built-in auto-configuration capabilities from the centralized management system. sipXecs uses MongoDB as a distributed and partition tolerant database for global transactions, includes CFEngine for orchestration of clusters and JasperReports for reporting. The management and configuration system is based on the Spring Framework. sipXecs includes FreeSWITCH as its media server and Openfire for presence and instant messaging services. sipXecs follows standards such as Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), SRTP, Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), SIP and XMPP over TLS, and several Web standards including WebRTC, WebSOCKET and Representational State Transfer (REST). , Inc. holds the US patent on the architecture referred to as SIP Session Oriented Architecture or SSOA. Adoption Adoption of open source solutions is difficult to quantify. SIPfoundry claims on its Web site that over one million users have downloaded sipXecs in small and large companies worldwide. Amazon.com was an early adopter of sipXecs. This initial 5,000 user deployment expanded considerably in the following years. OnRelay, a company in the UK, selected sipXecs for its fixed-mobile convergence solution sold to carriers. Colorado State University and Cedarville University of Ohio committed to sipXecs in 2010. Red Hat deployed a commercial version of sipXecs from globally in 2012. Under the SIPfoundry Higher Education Program (HEP) and as of 2014 Lafayette College, St. Mary's University, Messiah College, Colorado School of Mines, Carthage College deployed sipXecs to replace their respective PBX systems. sipXecs is used by small and large enterprises ranging up to about 20,000 users per cluster. SIPfoundry lists the following users on its Web site: Brevard County FL, Dutch Police, Easter Seals, Siemens Transportation, British Airways. Availability sipXecs is available for Red Hat Linux and CentOS. It runs virtualized in different cloud environments such as the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, the Google Compute Engine, the HP Cloud, IBM SoftLayer, VMware vCloud and VMware ESX, OpenStack environments, and clouds from other vendors using these technologies. Licensing and Copyright  SIPfoundry distributes the sipXecs source code under the Affero General Public License (AGPL). Many different corporate and individual contributors contributed to sipXecs, including Pingtel, Bluesocket, Nortel, Avaya, and as some of the larger corporate contributors representing 864,791 lines of code. In addition, the sipXecs solution includes many other open source components. SIPfoundry holds Copyright on all derivative work. Contributions to sipXecs are made under a Contributor Agreement, which grants SIPfoundry shared Copyright with the original author on all contributed code. Hardware sipXecs supports a wide range of SIP compatible hardware, such as PSTN gateways, desk phones, softphones and mobile phone applications. A plug n'play auto-configuration capability is available for phones from currently (software release 14.04) 18 different vendors. SIP reference implementation The sipXecs system represents a reference implementation of the SIP standard. It was used at SIPIT interoperability events organized by the SIP Forum to test interoperability of SIP solutions from many different vendors.

Mironov. The Blind Man of Bethsaida is the subject of one of the miracles of Jesus in the Gospels. It is found only in Mark 8:22-26.The Miracles of Jesus by Craig Blomberg, David Wenham 2003 page 419 The exact location of Bethsaida in this pericope is subject to debate among scholars but is likely to have been Bethsaida Julias, on the north shore of Lake Galilee. According to Mark's account, when Jesus came to Bethsaida, a town in Galilee, he was asked to heal a blind man. Jesus took the man by the hand and led him out of the town, put some spittle on his eyes, and laid hands on him. \\"I see men like trees, walking\\", said the man. Jesus repeated the procedure, resulting in clear and perfect eyesight. \\"Neither go into the town,\\" commanded Jesus, \\"nor tell anyone in the town.\\" (New King James Version). Even though the story is found only in Mark, it is strongly supported by the criterion of embarrassment, since it could be argued that early Christians would not have been happy that Jesus had to give two blessings to achieve a proper result. Bede argues that \\"by this miracle, Christ teaches us how great is the spiritual blindness of man, which only by degrees, and by successive stages, can come to the light of Divine knowledge\\".Bede, On the Gospel of Mark, quoted in Pulpit Commentary on Mark 8, accessed 25 November 2017 The New Testament describes only one other miracle performed in Bethsaida, the feeding of the multitude in Luke 9:16, although John 21:25 states that many more things were done by Jesus than have been recorded. According to Matthew 11:21, Jesus cursed the city for its lack of belief in him despite \\"the mighty works done in you\\". Methodist founder John Wesley suggests that Jesus escorted the man out of the town before healing him \\"in just displeasure against the inhabitants of Bethsaida for their obstinate infidelity\\".Wesley, J., Notes on the New Testament on Mark 8, accessed 25 November 2017 References See also * Life of Jesus in the New Testament * Ministry of Jesus * Parables of Jesus * The Blind man Bartimaeus Category:Blind people Category:Gospel of Mark Category:Miracles of Jesus Category:People from Bethsaida Category:People in the canonical gospels Category:Unnamed people of the Bible ","title":"Blind man of Bethsaida"},{"id":"2150858","text":"Robert III (1249 ‚Äì 17 September 1322), also called Robert of B√©thune and nicknamed The Lion of Flanders (De Leeuw van Vlaanderen), was the Count of Nevers from 1273 and Count of Flanders from 1305 until his death. History Robert was the oldest son of Guy of DampierreRandall Fegley, The Golden Spurs of Kortrijk: How the Knights of France Fell to the Foot Soldiers of Flanders in 1302, (McFarland & Co., 2002), 104. from his first marriage with Matilda of B√©thune. His father essentially transferred the reign of Flanders to him in November 1299, during his war with Philip IV of France. Both father and son were taken into captivity in May 1300, and Robert was not released until 1305. Robert of B√©thune gained military fame in Italy, when he fought at the side of his father-in-law, Charles I of Sicily (1265‚Äì1268) against the last Hohenstaufens, Manfred and Conradin. Together with his father he took part in 1270 in the Eighth Crusade, led by Saint Louis. After his return from the Crusade he continued to be a loyal aid for his father, politically and militarily, in the fight against the attempts of the French King Philip IV the Fair to add Flanders to the French crown lands. Guy of Dampierre broke all feudal bonds with the French king (on 20 January 1297) mainly under his influence. When the resistance seemed hopeless Robert allowed himself to be taken prisoner, together with his father and his brother William of Cr√®vecoeur, and taken to the French King (May 1300). Shortly before that he had become the de facto ruler of Flanders. He was locked in the castle of Chinon. Contrary to popular belief, and the romantic portrayal by Hendrik Conscience in his novel about these events (The Lion of Flanders), he did not take part in the Battle of the Golden Spurs.J.F. Verbruggen, edited by Keely Devries, translated by D.R. Ferguson, The Battle of the Golden Spurs, page 19, 2002, . In July 1305, after his father had died in captivity, he was allowed to return to his county. The execution of the Treaty of Athis-sur-Orge would mark the rule of Count Robert. Initially, he achieved some success in moving the countryside and the cities to fulfill their duties. However, in April 1310 he started to radically resist the French, with support of his subjects and his family. Both diplomatically and militarily he managed to make a stand against the French king. In December 1318, King Edward II of England sent nobles to mediate between Count Robert and William I, Count of Hainaut, in order to ease the passage of trade. When Robert marched to Lille in 1319 the militia from Ghent refused to cross the Leie with him. When his grandson Louis I of Nevers pressured him as well, Robert gave up the battle and went to Paris in 1320 to restore feudal bonds with the French King. But even after that, he would hamper the execution of the Treaty of Athis-sur-Orge to the point of being excommunicated.The Low Countries and the Disputed Imperial Election of 1314, Henry S. Lucas, Speculum, Vol. 21, No. 1 (Jan., 1946), 83. Robert died in 1322 and was succeeded by his grandson, Louis, Count of Nevers and Rethel. He was buried in Flanders in Saint Martin's Cathedral in Ypres, as was his explicit wish to be buried on Flemish soil. His body was only allowed to be transferred to the abbey of Flines (near Douai) when Lille and Douai were again part of the County of Flanders. His first wife and his father were also buried in this abbey.

This skill was made popular by romanticized depictions of gunslingers in the Western genre, which in turn were inspired by famous historical gunfights in the American Old West. In modern times, fast draw can be seen both in sports and in military practices. The World Fast Draw Association (WFDA) is the international sanctioning body of the sport of fast draw. Unlike cowboy action shooting, fast draw is shot with special blanks or wax bullets. While some competitions are strictly against the clock, with the fastest time winning, many are set up as head to head single or double elimination matches. History The object of fast draw as a combative sport is to quickly draw one's pistol and fire with the most accuracy. The sport has been inspired by accounts of duels and gunfights which incorporated it during the Wild West, such as the Wild Bill Hickok ‚Äì Davis Tutt shootout, Luke Short ‚Äì Jim Courtright duel, Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Long Branch Saloon Gunfight and others, which in turn inspired the gunfights seen in Hollywood western movies. June 25, 2004 Gunfighters Jim Leavy and Tom Carberry became infamous for participating in at least two quick draw duels in their lifetimes.Jim Levy - The Jewish GunfighterMcGrath, Roger D. Gunfighters, Highwaymen & Vigilantes: Violence on the Frontier. University of California Press (March 23, 1987). pp. 99- 100. . In the case of Jonathan R. Davis, the quick draw is also necessary for a gunman to fight back if he is ambushed. Though many gunfighters were remembered to be dangerous with a pistol during the American frontier, only a few known historical individuals have been noted by historians as \\"fast\\", such as Wild Bill Hickok, Doc Holliday, John Wesley Hardin, Luke Short, Tom Horn and Billy the Kid. Although unlike the depiction seen in westerns, fast draw duels at that time were performed with the traditional dueling stance. Typically, historical Western duels were a crude form of the \\"Southern code duello,\\" a highly formalized means of solving disputes between gentlemen with swords or guns that had its origins in European chivalry.Agnew, Jeremy. December 2, 2014. The Creation of the Cowboy Hero: Fiction, Film and Fact, p. 88, McFarland. During the Old West, the term \\"fast on the draw\\" or \\"quick on the draw\\" didn't necessarily mean a person is swift on drawing a pistol, it actually meant that a person is aggressive and would draw his weapon at even the slightest provocation.DeArment, Robert K. Deadly Dozen: Forgotten Gunfighters of the Old West, Volume 3. University of Oklahoma Press; First edition (March 15, 2010). p. 82. While the ability to draw a firearm quickly was a popular skill during the American frontier, modern fast draw is inspired more by gun duels in western films than historical gunfights. Most gunfights that occurred in the Old West were more spontaneous and due to either alcohol consumption or heated squabbles. Duels, while also fought to uphold honor, were usually not formalized and sometimes were due to the heat of the moment. In these circumstances, the one who can draw, fire and hit his opponent first was usually the winner, but accuracy and calmness were also, and sometimes more, favored by actual gunmen in the era. =Holsters= In western movies, the characters' gun belts are often worn low on the hip and outer thigh, with the holster cut away around the pistol's trigger and grip for a smooth, fast draw. This type of holster is a Hollywood anachronism. Fast-draw artists can be distinguished from other movie cowboys because their guns will often be tied to their thigh. Long before holsters were steel-lined, they were soft and supple for comfortable all-day wear. A gunfighter would use tie-downs to keep his pistol from catching on the holster while drawing. Most of the time, gunfighters would just hide their pistols in their pockets, which was faster and more practical. June 7, 2012 Other gunfighters would use Bridgeport rigs that gave a faster and easier draw. Sport Fast draw is one of the fastest sports in the world. Every time is measured under one second, from the signal to draw to when the timer is stopped. The current World Fast Draw Association (WFDA) record for Open Class Fast Draw in an event called Standing Balloons is .208 seconds - and that includes the time it takes to react, draw, fire and pop a balloon target at eight feet away. A world class competitor can draw and fire a shot in under half a second. Given that the average human reaction time is around 0.2 to 0.25 seconds, the round is over before most people can react. The reaction times of the best fast draw shooters is 0.145 seconds, which means that the gun is cocked, drawn, aimed (from the hip), and fired in just over 0.06 seconds. To establish a World Fast Draw Association record, a second shot must be fired in the same competition that is no more than 0.30 seconds slower than the first; this is intended to prevent a shot that anticipates the start signal from setting a record. In competitions where two rounds must be fired, at separate targets, less than 0.10 seconds separate the shots. In Open Class, or \\"traditional\\" fast draw competition, shooters must start with the gun holstered, and their hands not touching the gun, as opposed to the newer sport of Cowboy Fast Draw, where the competitors start with their hand on the gun. A signal, usually both audible and visible, signals the shooter to fire. A timer is started when the signal is given. The shooter fires at either a metal plate (for wax bullets) or a balloon (for blanks). The timer is rigged to stop on the sound of the wax bullet hitting the plate, or the balloon popping. Different types of matches use one or more targets, and the shooter can fire from a standing position, or while walking towards or backing away from the target(s). The exhibition shooter Bob Munden (1942-2012), proclaimed by the Guinness Book of World Records as ‚Äúthe fastest man with a gun who ever lived\\", could draw, fire, break a balloon target with a blank using a standard weight single-action revolver and return his gun to his holster faster than the blink of an eye. On his DVD \\"Outrageous Shooting,\\" Munden was filmed shooting .16 of a second in an event called Walk and Draw Level. In the military Fast draw and quick draw can also be seen in real-life combat situations. It is an important skill that is still being taught and crafted in the military and the police. Draw speed is essential in a deadly force situation and soldiers are trained to be able to draw their sidearm and fire with speed and accuracy.Quick-Draw Drills Accidents In June 2011, a soldier named Sgt. Brent McBride played a game of quick draw with his fellow soldier and roommate, Sgt. Matthew Gallagher. The incident happened in their small trailer-like room in Al Kut, Iraq. During the game, McBride drew his pistol and shot Gallagher in the head at close range. Sgt. Brent McBride pleaded guilty at a Fort Hood, Texas, court martial in March 2012 to involuntary manslaughter.

The terms were an armistice for 40 years. A few years earlier in 1323, Republic of Novgorod had settled its conflict with Sweden in the Treaty of N√∂teborg.

(Note: unless otherwise noted, all statements in this article regarding the contents of Man Plus are based on the book itself). It won the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1976, was nominated for the Hugo and Campbell Awards, and placed third in the annual Locus Poll in 1977.Locus Index to SF Awards The story is about a cyborg, Roger Torraway, who is designed to operate in the harsh Martian environment so that humans can colonize Mars. Plot In the not-too-distant future, the Cold War threatens to turn into a fighting war. Colonization of Mars seems to be mankind's only hope of surviving certain Armageddon. To facilitate this, the American government begins a cyborg program to create a being capable of surviving the harsh Martian environment: Man Plus. After the death of the first candidate, due to the project supervisors forgetting to enhance his brain's ability to process sensory input to cope with the new stimuli he is receiving, Roger Torraway becomes the heart of the program. To survive in the thin Martian atmosphere, Roger Torraway's body must be replaced with an artificial one. At every step he becomes more and more disconnected from humanity, unable to feel things in his new body. It is only after arriving on Mars that his new body begins to make sense to him. It is perfectly adapted to this new world and he becomes perfectly separated from his old world and from humanity. The success of the Martian mission spurs similar cyborg programs in other spacefaring nations. It is revealed that the computer networks of Earth have become sentient and that ensuring humanity's survival will guarantee theirs as well. In the end, the network is puzzled; something has distorted their extrapolations, the same way they influenced humanity. Reception New York Times reviewer Gerald Jonas received the novel unfavorably, saying \\"Pohl seems to have lost his touch entirely. . . . the social extrapolation in Man Plus is simple-minded and the irony heavy- handed.\\"\\"Of Things to Come\\", The New York Times Book Review, October 17, 1976 Spider Robinson found Man Plus to be \\"tight, suspenseful, at times gruesomely fascinating,\\" but faulted it for \\"one dumptruck-sized hole\\" in its plotting.\\"Galaxy Bookshelf\\", Galaxy Science Fiction, May 1977, p.142 C.

A train event recorder ‚Äì also called On-Train Monitoring Recorder (OTMR), On- Train Data Recorder (OTDR), Event Recorder System (ERS), Event Recorder Unit (ERU), or simply Event Recorder (ER) ‚Äì is a device that records data about the operation of train controls and performance in response to those controls and other train control systems. It is similar to the flight data recorder found on aircraft.  Functions  Because event recorders are integrated with most car-borne systems, they are an attractive target for enhanced diagnostic and control functions. Some event recorders feature outputs controlling penalty brake or emergency brake (train) systems, and speedometers. Data storage can be provided by magnetic tape, battery-backed RAM and, more recently, non- volatile EEPROM or Flash Memory overwritten in a FIFO continuous loop. The data is intended for use in the investigation of accidents and incidents but is also used to monitor traction unit performance, the competence of drivers, and general state of the train over a period of time. Development A suggestion in The Times of 10 October 1853, commenting on a rail collision near Portarlington station, Great Southern and Western Railway, on 5 October that year, called for a paper-roll recorder to be carried in a locked box on trains, recording wheel revolutions against time, the record to be removed and stored by station masters at the destination station. In 1864 a similar proposal came from Charles Babbage, inspired by his 1840 experiments for the Great Western Railway using self-inking pens on paper rolls carried on dynamometer cars. No action seems to have been taken in either case. The earliest event recorders were the mechanical \\"TEL\\"HaslerRail history speed recorders of 1891, which recorded both time and speed.http://www.railway- technology.com/contractors/computer/hasler/ The TEL's manufacturer, Hasler Rail of Switzerland, remains a leading producer of train event recorders. France developed the Flaman Speed Indicator and Recorder. In Germany, the Indusi train protection system had included recording equipment from early on using a ticker tape on paper. For I60R a generalized recorder system was installed (Datenspeicherkassette [DSK] / data storage cassette) that allowed to enter the train number, driver info, train weight along with the driving events. The standardized DSK black box allows for approximately 30,000 km of general recording data and 90 km of detailed recording data. Later models of the DSK are electronic especially since the introduction of the computerized PZ80/PZB90 train protection generations. Modern Train Event Recorders follow International or National Standards like IEEE Std. 1482.1-1999, FRA 49 CFR Part 229, IEC 62625-1 etc. specifying the digital and analogue data to be acquired, recorded and transmitted for further analysis. The need for event recorders to sustain an accident has led to companies like Arrowvale Electronics (UK), Faiveley (France), Hasler Rail (Switzerland), Bach-Simpson (USA), Saira Electronics (Italy) [previously FAR Systems], MIOS Elettronica (Italy) to develop crash protected memory modules as a part of their event recorders. These new generation event recorders have growing demand both for rapid transit systems and mainline trains, in Europe, United States, India, etc..  Regulations  =Canada= Canadian regulations provide in the \\"Locomotives Design Requirements (Part II)\\" :\\"12. Event Recorders. 12.1 Controlling locomotives other than in designated and/or yard service, shall be equipped with an event recorder meeting the following minimum design criteria: The event recorder shall record time, distance, speed, brake pipe pressure, throttle position, emergency brake application, independent brake cylinder pressure, horn signal and Reset Safety Control function\\"Locomotives Design Requirements (Part II) - Event Recorders = United States = U.S. regulations define event recorders as follows: (CFR 49 Ch II 229.5): :\\"(g) Event recorder means a device, designed to resist tampering, that monitors and records data on train speed, direction of motion, time, distance, throttle position, brake applications and operations (including train brake, independent brake, and, if so equipped, dynamic brake applications and operations) and, where the locomotive is so equipped, cab signal aspect(s), over the most recent 48 hours of operation of the electrical system of the locomotive on which it is installed. A device, designed to resist tampering, that monitors and records the specified data.\\"Code of Federal Regulations - Sec. 229.5 Definitions The Federal Railroad Administrations (FRA) \\"Final Rule 49 CFR Part 229\\", (revised June 30, 2005)FRA ruling FRA press release requires that event recorders be fitted to the leading locomotives of all US, Canadian and Mexican trains operating above 30 MPH on the US rail network including all freight, passenger and commuter rail locomotives but does not apply to transit running on its own dedicated tracks. The new ruling applies to locomotives either ordered before Oct 1, 2006 or placed in service after Oct 1, 2009 and included: *Improved crash worthiness by means of a \\"hardened\\" memory module able to withstand: **Fire resistance of 750 ¬∞C for 1 hour, this test simulates the temperature of burning diesel fuel **Impact shock of 55 g 100ms **Static crush of 110 kN for 5 minutes, this test simulates a locomotive derailment and blunt object impact **Fluid immersion in Diesel, water, salt water or lube oils for 2 days **Hydrostatic pressure equivalent to immersion to a depth of 15 m in water for 2 days *Recording of additional information to enhance the quality of information available for post-accident investigations including the following \\"safety-critical\\" signals: **Speed **Direction of travel (Forward or Reverse) **Time **Distance **Throttle position **Operation of brakes **Status of Headlights and Marker Lights (On or Off) **Operation of Horn **Status of Cab signals *Store the last 48 hours of safety-critical train data. This is to prevent over-writing of the crash data if the loco is used for the subsequent \\"clean-up\\" of the crash scene. *The phasing out of the old magnetic tape models over a four-year period due to their vulnerability to data loss in the event of a crash. = United Kingdom and Ireland = All trains operating on Network Rail controlled infrastructure are required to be fitted with an event recorder complying with GM/RT 2472-2, the standard also cross references with BS EN 62625-1:2013. Ireland has also adopted this regulation. RSSB (Rail Safety and Standards Board) is responsible for event recorder standards in the UK. Crash protection requirements: *Fire resistance of 700 ¬∞C for 5 minutes *Impact shock of 100 g, three times on each of its six sides *Static crush of 20 kN for 1 minute, to all edges and faces *Fluid immersion in water, AFFF or R134A for 1 hour *Magnetic field produced by a current pulse of 0 to 64 kA, rising at 107 A/s, at a distance of 1 metre The UK approach is similar to US requirements, but the list of required signals is more comprehensive. This reflects, in part, the prevalence of passenger trains and the inevitable possibility of incidents involving access doors. Signals to be recorded include: *Brake demand including operation of all Brake Controls and other brake activations *Power notch *Wheel speed *Speedometer, both signal sent to speedometer and indication displayed to driver *Automatic Warning System (AWS) operation *Driver reminder appliance (DRA) operation *Vigilance Operation *Passenger Emergency Systems (PES) *Override of any Safety System *Horn *Door signals *Door inter-lock *Wheel slide protection (WSP) *Tilt, if fitted *Speed supervision & Control, if fitted = Switzerland = Speed recording equipment has been used by Swiss Federal Railways for many years.

The East Turkestan independence movement, also known as the Xinjiang independence movement or the Uyghur independence movement, is a political movement that seeks independence for Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, a large and sparsely-populated province- level subdivision of the People's Republic of China (PRC/China) located in the country's northwest, as a homeland for the Uyghur people, who are primarily of Turkic rather than Sinitic (Han Chinese) ethnic extraction. Within the movement, there is widespread support for the region to be renamed, since \\"Xinjiang\\" is seen by independence activists as a colonial name. \\"East Turkestan\\" is the most well-known proposed name. \\"Uyghurstan\\" is another well- known proposed name. Xinjiang was initially conquered by the Qing dynasty, an historical Chinese ethnic-Manchu regime, in the 1750s, with 1759 being the year of the establishment of the original form of the modern day administrative region. Xinjiang was subsequently inherited by the Republic of China (ROC), which succeeded the Qing dynasty in 1912, and then by the PRC, which mostly succeeded the ROC in 1949 (except in Taiwan). Throughout Qing and ROC rule, there were several periods of brief de facto independence for either the entire region of Xinjiang or parts of it, as well as foreign occupation and warlord governance. The PRC incorporation of Xinjiang occurred soon after the regime was established in 1949, and since then, Xinjiang has remained an integral region of China. The PRC claims that Xinjiang has been part of China for over 2000 years, though evidence for this claim is scant. Historically, Xinjiang has never truly been independent as \\"East Turkestan\\", though various non-Chinese regimes controlled the region at various points prior to the 1750s. Xinjiang has been a hotbed of ethnic and religious conflict throughout much of the period that it has been governed by successive Chinese regimes. The Chinese government (China) considers all support for the East Turkestan independence movement to fall under the definitions of \\"terrorism, extremism, and separatism\\". China is currently committing a so-called Uyghur genocide in Xinjiang, primarily in order to defeat the independence movement and eradicate Uyghur identity, though China claims that the main purpose is to stop terrorism, and has been portraying the United States War on Terror as a false equivalence. The East Turkestan independence movement is supported by both militant Islamic extremist groups which have been designated terrorist organizations by several countries and the United Nations, such as the Turkistan Islamic Party,\\"U.S.Department of State Terrorist Exclusion List\\" (Retrieved on 29 July 2014). as well as certain advocacy groups, such as the World Uyghur Congress. China considers the World Uyghur Congress a terrorist organisation although it has no verifiable links to terrorism. The United States and Germany support the position that the World Uyghur Congress is not a terrorist organisation. Proposed name The most common name for Xinjiang used by independence advocates is \\"East Turkestan\\" (or \\"Uyghurstan\\"). There is no consensus among secessionists about whether to use \\"East Turkestan\\" or \\"Uyghurstan\\"; \\"East Turkestan\\" has the advantage of also being the name of two historical political entities in the region, while Uyghurstan appeals to modern ideas of ethnic self-determination. Uyghurstan is also a difference in emphasis in that it excludes more peoples in Xinjiang than just the Han, but the \\"East Turkestan\\" movement is still a Uyghur phenomenon. The name \\"East Turkestan\\" is not currently used in an official sense by most sovereign states and intergovernmental organizations. Another proposed alternative is \\"Yarkand\\" or \\"Yarkent,\\" which harkens back to the Yarkent Khanate, a powerful Uyghur state in the 16th and 17th centuries.  History  =Yaqub Beg establishment of Kashgaria= The Kokandi Yaqub Beg invaded Kashgar during the Dungan revolt to establish an independent state after taking advantage of local rebellions. Also, during the Dungan revolt, the Taranchi Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang initially cooperated with the Dungans (Chinese Muslims) when they rose in revolt, but turned on them, because the Dungans, mindful of their Chinese heritage, attempted to subject the entire region to their rule. The Taranchi massacred the Dungans at Kuldja and drove the rest through the Talk pass into the Ili valley. = Within the Republic of China (1912‚Äì1949) = The right One of the earliest attempts at East Turkestan independence was the establishment of the short-lived \\"First East Turkestan Republic\\" (aka \\"Turkish Islamic Republic of East Turkestan\\"), which lasted between 1933 and 1934. This republic was formed following a rebellion in Kashgar against the Republic of China (1912‚Äì1949) (ROC), which was still in the process of conquering Kashgar after two decades of Warlordism in China (ROC). The Chinese Hui Muslim 36th Division (National Revolutionary Army) re-annexed the First East Turkestan Republic following Chinese (ROC) victories at the conclusions of the Battle of Kashgar (1933) and Battle of Kashgar (1934). During the later years of China under the ROC, which was engaged against the Chinese Communists in the context of the Chinese Civil War, the Soviet Union under leader Joseph Stalin invaded Xinjiang and assisted a local rebellion at Ili (Yining City). The rebellion led to the establishment of the Second East Turkistan Republic (1944‚Äì1949), which existed in three northern districts (Ili, Tarbaghatai, Altai) of Xinjiang with secret aid from the Soviet Union. After emerging (mostly) victorious at the conclusion of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, the People's Liberation Army annexed Xinjiang from the ROC and the Second East Turkestan Republic. = Within the People's Republic of China (1949‚Äìpresent) = Ever since the Chinese economic reform from the late 1970s exacerbated uneven regional development, while Uyghurs have migrated to urbanizing Xinjiang cities, some Hans have also migrated to Xinjiang for independent economic advancement. Increased ethnic contact and labor competition coincided with Uyghur separatist terrorism from the 1990s, such as the 1997 √úr√ºmqi bus bombings. A police roundup of suspected separatists during Ramadan resulted in large demonstrations that turned violent in February 1997 in an episode known as the Ghulja Incident that led to at least 9 deaths. The Urumqi bus bombs of 25 February 1997, perhaps a response to the crackdown that followed the Ghulja Incident, killed 9 and injured 68. Speaking on separatist violence, Erkin Alptekin, a former East Turkestan National Congress chairman and prominent Uyghur activist, said: \\"We must emphasize dialog and warn our youth against the use of violence because it delegitimizes our movement\\".  Recent events  Despite much talk of separatism and terrorism in Xinjiang, especially after the 9-11 attacks in the United States and the US invasion of Afghanistan, the situation in Xinjiang was quiet from the late nineties through mid-2006. In 2005, Uygur author Nurmemet Yasin was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment for inciting separatism following his publication of an allegorical short story, \\"The Blue Pigeon\\". Rebiya Kadeer claimed that Turkey is hampered from interfering with the Uyghurs because it recognizes that the Kurdish-Turkish conflict may receive interference from China in retaliation.  Views on independence  = Arguments in favor of independence = Several proponents of independence state that the Uyghurs have had a defined history in Xinjiang for \\"over 4000 years\\", a claim which has neither been proven nor disproven. There are historical arguments for the independence of Xinjiang, such as the argument that the People's Republic of China is a colonial occupier of Xinjiang, rather than the sovereign state which has traditionally ruled over Xinjiang. Evidence for this argument usually consists of claims that the PRC is not the legitimate successor state to either the ROC (now based in Taiwan) or the previous imperial dynasty of China, which is the Qing dynasty, or that previous regimes were also illegitimate. = Arguments against independence = The main camp which is opposed to Xinjiang (East Turkestan) independence is the Government of China and its supporters (including Chinese nationalists). China officially claims that Xinjiang has been part of China (the historical region) since the year 60 BCE, when the Han dynasty of China established the Protectorate of the Western Regions. China claims that Xinjiang has always belonged to China even at times when it was occupied by several other countries. Historically, various Chinese governments have described invasions of Xinjiang as a sort of \\"reconquest\\" of previously lost territories ever since the Han and Tang dynasties. Some Uyghur nationalist historians such as Turghun Almas claim that Uyghurs were distinct and independent from Chinese for 6000 years, and that all non-Uyghur peoples are non-indigenous immigrants to Xinjiang. However, the Han Dynasty (206 BCE‚Äì220 CE) established military colonies (tuntian) and commanderies (duhufu) to control Xinjiang from 120 BCE, while the Tang Dynasty (618‚Äì907) also controlled much of Xinjiang until the An Lushan rebellion. Chinese historians refute Uyghur nationalist claims by pointing out the 2000-year history of Han settlement in Xinjiang, documenting the history of Mongol, Kazakh, Uzbek, Manchu, Hui, Xibo indigenes in Xinjiang, and by emphasizing the relatively late \\"westward migration\\" of the Huigu (equated with \\"Uyghur\\" by the PRC government) people from Mongolia the 9th century. The name \\"Uyghur\\" was associated with a Buddhist people in the Tarim Basin in the 9th century, but completely disappeared by the 15th century, until it was revived by the Soviet Union in the 20th century. = Chinese government views = The Chinese government considers all support for the East Turkestan independence movement to fall under the definitions of \\"terrorism, extremism, and separatism\\". The Chinese government claims that the independence movement is largely funded and led by outside forces that seek to weaken China; it further claims that despite such movements, Xinjiang has made great economic strides, building up its infrastructure, improving its education system and increasing the average life expectancy.China White Paper on Xinjiang 26 May 2004 = Republic of China (Taiwan) views = Isa Yusuf Alptekin, the father of Erkin Aliptekin (the founder of the World Uyghur Congress) opposed independence of East Turkistan and served the Republic of China to undermine both the First East Turkestan Republic (1933-1934) and the Second East Turkestan Republic (1944-1949). He fled China after the Kuomintang's rule in mainland was replaced by the Communists. Chinese Muslim General Ma Bufang, the Republic of China's (Taiwan) ambassador to Saudi Arabia between 1957 and 1961, in response to a request by a former Uyghur Mufti living in Saudi Arabia, Abdul Ahad Hamed for accommodations to be granted to Uyghurs with Republic of China citizenship living outside of China, sent the following letter, which rejected Abdul Ahad Hamed's demands and his usage of the term \\"East Turkestan\\", upholding the official position of the Republic of China (Taiwan) that Xinjiang was a part of China and that it did not recognize the East Turkestan independence movement.Page 52, Ismail, Mohammed Sa'id, and Mohammed Aziz Ismail.

Organizations = Nonmilitant organizations = ETGIE members at Capitol Hill on 14 September 2004In general, the wide variety of groups who seek independence can be distinguished by both the type of government they advocate and the role they believe an independent East Turkestan should play in international affairs. One of the most seminal events of the East Turkestan independence movement was the establishment of the East Turkistan Government- in-Exile by a group of immigrants led by Anwar Yusuf Turani in Washington D.C. on 14 September 2004. Nonmilitant organizations which support the East Turkestan independence movement are as follows: * East Turkistan Government- in-Exile - Located in Washington D.C., United States. It was formed in 2004 after the split of the East Turkistan National Congress. * East Turkistan National Awakening Movement - Located in Washington DC, United States. It was formed on 4 June 2017. = Militant organizations = Some groups that support independence for East Turkestan are militant, most of which have been labeled terrorist organizations by many governments. For example, the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM, also Turkistan Islamic Party), which has claimed responsibility for attacks in Xinjiang, has been identified as a terrorist organization by the governments of China, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Turkey and the United States, as well as the United Nations. = Historical support = Historically, organizations which have supported the East Turkestan independence movement include: *East Turkestan People's Revolutionary Party (ETPRP) - Was an Uyghur communist party and was the largest armed separatist group in Xinjiang in its time. The Soviet Union was involved in funding and support to the ETPRP to start a violent uprising against China in 1968. *United Revolutionary Front of East Turkestan (URFET) - Was an Uyghur nationalist group in Xinjiang that participated in the Xinjiang conflict as an armed separatist force. It was backed by the Soviets. *East Turkestan Liberation Organization - Was a secessionist militant Uyghur organization that advocated for an independent Uyghur state in Xinjiang. Widely believed to have links to Taliban and the East Turkestan Islamic Movement.Eastern Turkistan Liberation Organization MIPT Terror Knowledge Base *Committee for National Revolution - Was a Turkic nationalist Uyghur party which existed in 1932‚Äì1934. It helped found the First East Turkestan Republic. *Young Kashgar Party - Was a Turkic nationalist Uyghur party which existed from 1933 to 1934. It helped found the First East Turkestan Republic.  Soviet Union  The Soviet Union supported the Uyghur Second East Turkestan Republic in the Ili Rebellion against the Republic of China. According to her autobiography, Dragon Fighter: One Woman's Epic Struggle for Peace with China, Rebiya Kadeer's father served with pro-Soviet Uyghur rebels under the Second East Turkestan Republic in the Ili Rebellion (Three Province Rebellion) in 1944‚Äì1946, using Soviet assistance and aid to fight the Republic of China government under Chiang Kai-shek. Kadeer and her family were close friends with White Russian exiles living in Xinjiang and Kadeer recalled that many Uyghurs thought Russian culture was \\"more advanced\\" than that of the Uyghurs and they \\"respected\\" the Russians a lot. Many of the Turkic peoples of the Ili region of Xinjiang had close cultural, political, and economic ties with Russia and then the Soviet Union. Many of them were educated in the Soviet Union and a community of Russian settlers lived in the region. As a result, many of the Turkic rebels fled to the Soviet Union and obtained Soviet assistance in creating the Sinkiang Turkic People's Liberation Committee (STPNLC) in 1943 to revolt against Kuomintang rule during the Ili Rebellion. The pro-Soviet Uyghur who later became leader of the revolt and the Second East Turkestan Republic, Ehmetjan Qasim, was Soviet educated and described as \\"Stalin's man\\". The Soviet Union incited separatist activities in Xinjiang through propaganda, encouraging Kazakhs to flee to the Soviet Union and attacking China. China responded by reinforcing the Xinjiang-Soviet border area specifically with Han Bingtuan militia and farmers. The Soviet Union supported Uyghur nationalist propaganda and Uyghur separatist movements against China. The Soviet historians claimed that the Uyghur native land was Xinjiang and Uyghur nationalism was promoted by Soviet versions of history on turcology. The East Turkestan People's Party received support from the Soviet Union. During the 1970s, the Soviets supported the URFET to fight the Chinese.

The name literally means \\"brave young man\\". Produced by Szczeci≈Ñska Fabryka Motocykli (SFM) (en.: Szczecin Factory Motorcycles) in three variants: M07, M10 and B20. During the nine years of production, 1956-1965, a total of 91,400 Junak motorcycles were produced. Several models were produced, namely: 10,000 tourist M07, rally M07-R and cross M07-C models, 2500 three-wheeled B20‚Äôs, 8500 sidecars type WB1 and W03 while the rest were M10 models. The Junak frame was produced by SFM in Szczecin while the engines were made by ZSM in ≈Å√≥d≈∫. During the transition from model M07 to M10 from 1960 to 1961 about 20,000 M10 models possessed some characteristics of the M07 model such as the headlight housing. These are called the transition or in Polish ‚Äúprzejsciowka‚Äù models. The Junak was designed in 1951-1952 in Biuro Konstrukcyjne Przemys≈Çu Motoryzacyjnego (Automotive Industry Design Bureau) under the leadership of J. Ignatowicz. At that time Junak was superior to many well known motorcycles. This was not surprising since experienced engineers designed the Junak basing their knowledge on T. Rudawski‚Äôs group. T. Rudawski was the father of pre-WWII Sokol motorcycles, which is why the Junak engine has many characteristics of the Sok√≥≈Ç 600 and 500. The governing system and inconvenient localization of the production line led to difficulties in ensuring quality. The same reasons hindered the production of the newer engines S130, S131, and S132. At the time of production Junak was a very expensive motorcycle for a common Polish worker. Eventually, a crash in the sales of large motorcycles led to a halt in production in 1965. Junak is called by some ‚Äúthe Polish Harley‚Äù, being the heaviest Polish post-war motorcycle, recognized today commonly as a classic in Poland. Despite some of its shortcomings Junak found many fans.

Compared with the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes, which marks off multiples of primes, the sieve of Atkin does some preliminary work and then marks off multiples of squares of primes, thus achieving a better theoretical asymptotic complexity. It was created in 2003 by A. O. L. Atkin and Daniel J. Bernstein.A.O.L. Atkin, D.J. Bernstein, Prime sieves using binary quadratic forms, Math. Comp. 73 (2004), 1023-1030.  Algorithm  In the algorithm: * All remainders are modulo-sixty remainders (divide the number by 60 and return the remainder). * All numbers, including and , are positive integers. * Flipping an entry in the sieve list means to change the marking (prime or nonprime) to the opposite marking. * This results in numbers with an odd number of solutions to the corresponding equation being potentially prime (prime if they are also square free), and numbers with an even number of solutions being composite. The algorithm: # Create a results list, filled with 2, 3, and 5\\\\. # Create a sieve list with an entry for each positive integer; all entries of this list should initially be marked non prime (composite). # For each entry number in the sieve list, with modulo- sixty remainder : ## If is 1, 13, 17, 29, 37, 41, 49, or 53, flip the entry for each possible solution to . The number of flipping operations as a ratio to the sieving range for this step approaches √ó (the \\"8\\" in the fraction comes from the eight modulos handled by this quadratic and the 60 because Atkin calculated this based on an even number of modulo 60 wheels), which results in a fraction of about 0.1117010721276.... ## If is 7, 19, 31, or 43, flip the entry for each possible solution to . The number of flipping operations as a ratio to the sieving range for this step approaches √ó (the \\"4\\" in the fraction comes from the four modulos handled by this quadratic and the 60 because Atkin calculated this based on an even number of modulo 60 wheels), which results in a fraction of about 0.072551974569.... ## If is 11, 23, 47, or 59, flip the entry for each possible solution to when . The number of flipping operations as a ratio to the sieving range for this step approaches √ó (the \\"4\\" in the fraction comes from the four modulos handled by this quadratic and the 60 because Atkin calculated this based on an even number of modulo 60 wheels), which results in a fraction of about 0.060827679704.... ## If is something else, ignore it completely. # Start with the lowest number in the sieve list. # Take the next number in the sieve list still marked prime. # Include the number in the results list. # Square the number and mark all multiples of that square as non prime. Note that the multiples that can be factored by 2, 3, or 5 need not be marked, as these will be ignored in the final enumeration of primes. # Repeat steps four through seven. The total number of operations for these repetitions of marking the squares of primes as a ratio of the sieving range is the sum of the inverse of the primes squared, which approaches the prime zeta function(2) of 0.45224752004... minus , , and for those primes which have been eliminated by the wheel, with the result multiplied by for the ratio of wheel hits per range; this results in a ratio of about 0.01363637571.... Adding the above ratios of operations together, the above algorithm takes a constant ratio of flipping/marking operations to the sieving range of about 0.2587171021...; From an actual implementation of the algorithm, the ratio is about 0.25 for sieving ranges as low as 67.  Pseudocode  The following is pseudocode which combines Atkin's algorithms 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 by using a combined set \\"s\\" of all the numbers modulo 60 excluding those which are multiples of the prime numbers 2, 3, and 5, as per the algorithms, for a straightforward version of the algorithm that supports optional bit packing of the wheel; although not specifically mentioned in the referenced paper, this pseudocode eliminates some obvious combinations of odd/even x's/y's in order to reduce computation where those computations would never pass the modulo tests anyway (i.e. would produce even numbers, or multiples of 3 or 5): limit ‚Üê 1000000000 // arbitrary search limit // set of wheel \\"hit\\" positions for a 2/3/5 wheel rolled twice as per the Atkin algorithm s ‚Üê {1,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,49,53,59} // Initialize the sieve with enough wheels to include limit: for n ‚Üê 60 √ó w + x where w ‚àà {0,1,...,limit √∑ 60}, x ‚àà s: is_prime(n) ‚Üê false // Put in candidate primes: // integers which have an odd number of // representations by certain quadratic forms. // Algorithm step 3.1: for n ‚â§ limit, n ‚Üê 4x¬≤+y¬≤ where x ‚àà {1,2,...} and y ‚àà {1,3,...} // all x's odd y's if n mod 60 ‚àà {1,13,17,29,37,41,49,53}: is_prime(n) ‚Üê ¬¨is_prime(n) // toggle state // Algorithm step 3.2: for n ‚â§ limit, n ‚Üê 3x¬≤+y¬≤ where x ‚àà {1,3,...} and y ‚àà {2,4,...} // only odd x's if n mod 60 ‚àà {7,19,31,43}: // and even y's is_prime(n) ‚Üê ¬¨is_prime(n) // toggle state // Algorithm step 3.3: for n ‚â§ limit, n ‚Üê 3x¬≤-y¬≤ where x ‚àà {2,3,...} and y ‚àà {x-1,x-3,...,1} //all even/odd if n mod 60 ‚àà {11,23,47,59}: // odd/even combos is_prime(n) ‚Üê ¬¨is_prime(n) // toggle state // Eliminate composites by sieving, only for those occurrences on the wheel: for n¬≤ ‚â§ limit, n ‚Üê 60 √ó w + x where w ‚àà {0,1,...}, x ‚àà s, n ‚â• 7: if is_prime(n): // n is prime, omit multiples of its square; this is sufficient // because square-free composites can't get on this list for c ‚â§ limit, c ‚Üê n¬≤ √ó (60 √ó w + x) where w ‚àà {0,1,...}, x ‚àà s: is_prime(c) ‚Üê false // one sweep to produce a sequential list of primes up to limit: output 2, 3, 5 for 7 ‚â§ n ‚â§ limit, n ‚Üê 60 √ó w + x where w ‚àà {0,1,...}, x ‚àà s: if is_prime(n): output n This pseudocode is written for clarity; although some redundant computations have been eliminated by controlling the odd/even x/y combinations, it still wastes almost half of its quadratic computations on non-productive loops that don't pass the modulo tests such that it will not be faster than an equivalent wheel factorized (2/3/5) sieve of Eratosthenes. To improve its efficiency, a method must be devised to minimize or eliminate these non-productive computations.  Explanation  The algorithm completely ignores any numbers with remainder modulo 60 that is divisible by two, three, or five, since numbers with a modulo 60 remainder divisible by one of these three primes are themselves divisible by that prime. All numbers with modulo-sixty remainder 1, 13, 17, 29, 37, 41, 49, or 53 have a modulo-four remainder of 1. These numbers are prime if and only if the number of solutions to is odd and the number is squarefree (proven as theorem 6.1 of). All numbers with modulo-sixty remainder 7, 19, 31, or 43 have a modulo-six remainder of 1. These numbers are prime if and only if the number of solutions to is odd and the number is squarefree (proven as theorem 6.2 of). All numbers with modulo-sixty remainder 11, 23, 47, or 59 have a modulo-twelve remainder of 11. These numbers are prime if and only if the number of solutions to is odd and the number is squarefree (proven as theorem 6.3 of). None of the potential primes are divisible by 2, 3, or 5, so they can't be divisible by their squares. This is why squarefree checks don't include 22, 32, and 52.  Computational complexity  It can be computed that the above series of three quadratic equation operations each have a number of operations that is a constant ratio of the range as the range goes to infinity; as well the prime square free culling operations can be described by the prime zeta function(2) with constant offsets and factors so it is also a constant factor of the range as the range goes to infinity. Therefore, the algorithm described above can compute primes up to N using O(N) operations with only O(N) bits of memory. The page segmented version implemented by the authors has the same O(N) operations but reduces the memory requirement to just that required by the base primes below the square root of the range of O(N1/2/log N) bits of memory plus a minimal page buffer. This is slightly better performance with the same memory requirement as the page segmented sieve of Eratosthenes which uses O(N log log N) operations and the same O(N1/2/log N) bits of memoryPritchard, Paul, \\"Linear prime-number sieves: a family tree,\\" Sci. Comput. Programming 9:1 (1987), pp. 17‚Äì35. plus a minimal page buffer. However, such a sieve does not outperform a Sieve of Eratosthenes with maximum practical wheel factorization (a combination of a 2/3/5/7 sieving wheel and pre-culling composites in the segment page buffers using a 2/3/5/7/11/13/17/19 pattern), which although it has slightly more operations than the Sieve of Atkin for very large but practical ranges, has a constant factor of less complexity per operation by about three times in comparing the per operation time between the algorithms implemented by Bernstein in CPU clock cycles per operation. The main problem with the Page Segmented Sieve of Atkin is the difficulty in implementing the \\"prime square free\\" culling sequences due to the span between culls rapidly growing far beyond the page buffer span; the time expended for this operation in Bernstein's implementation rapidly grows to many times the time expended in the actual quadratic equation calculations, meaning that the linear complexity of the part that would otherwise be quite negligible becomes a major consumer of execution time. Thus, even though an optimized implementation may again settle to a O(n) time complexity, this constant factor of increased time per operations means that the Sieve of Atkin is slower. A special modified \\"enumerating lattice points\\" variation of the Sieve of Atkin can theoretically compute primes up to N using O(N/log log N) operations with N1/2 + o(1) bits of memory but this variation is rarely implemented. That is a little better in performance at a very high cost in memory as compared to both the ordinary page segmented version and to an equivalent but rarely-implemented version of the sieve of Eratosthenes which uses O(N) operations and O(N1/2(log log N)/log N) bits of memory.Paul Pritchard, A sublinear additive sieve for finding prime numbers, Communications of the ACM 24 (1981), 18‚Äì23. Paul Pritchard, Explaining the wheel sieve, Acta Informatica 17 (1982), 477‚Äì485. Paul Pritchard, Fast compact prime number sieves (among others), Journal of Algorithms 4 (1983), 332‚Äì344. Pritchard observed that for the wheel sieves, one can reduce memory consumption while preserving Big O time complexity, but this generally comes at a cost in an increased constant factor for time per operation due to the extra complexity. Therefore, this special version is likely more of value as an intellectual exercise than a practical prime sieve with reduced real time expended for a given large practical sieving range.

It is the only album to feature guitarist Glen Drover and bassist Paul David Harbour, and the last to feature drummer John Luke H√©bert. House of God was remastered by Andy LaRocque and re-released in 2009. Plot The album's storyline is loosely based on the legend of Rennes- le-Ch√¢teau. It begins with a dirge-like monologue: \\"Upon the Cross he did not die, they tortured him, but he survived. Smuggled across the open sea, to Southern France, tranquility. There he married Magdalene, and founded another dynasty. A church was built upon a hill, to serve all of the gods at will.\\" (\\"Upon the Cross\\") One night centuries later, a weary traveler becomes lost in the woods, in an area ominously called \\"The Devil's Hide,\\" despite being familiar with the place. Unfortunately, he and his horse are soon surrounded by hungry wolves, watching from the forest (\\"The Trees Have Eyes\\"). Suddenly, a she-wolf with shining blue eyes appears, making all other wolves back away. Instinctively trusting this wolf, the traveler follows her to a small church at the bottom of a hill. Upon seeing it for the first time, the traveler notices a dark inscription on the door: \\"THIS PLACE IS TERRIBLE.\\" (\\"Follow the Wolf\\") The traveler enters the church, the titular House of God, in which everything starts to change from decrepitude to great opulence, full of food and drink. The wolf transforms into a beautiful woman and introduces herself as \\"Angel,\\" promising to love the traveler forever. The traveler falls in love with Angel at first sight, and the two make love to each other frequently in the church (\\"House of God\\"). However, within days the traveler begins noticing small, odd behaviors from Angel, including her kissing a small, black statue of a sinister devil \\"sitting by the altar.\\" He also mentions seeing two distinct pulpits, both depicting demonic images (\\"Black Devil\\"). Time passes. One day, while he is with Angel in the confession booth, she breaks down in tears and tells him her dramatic fate: a year prior to meeting the traveler, Angel was contracted by supernatural forces to guard the church; she reverts into her wolf form any time she leaves the grounds of the church and can only take human form within the building. Worse, Angel has one year to find a replacement for herself as guardian of the House of God. If she is successful, Angel will be freed from her contract and be permitted to leave the church as a normal woman once again, but with no memory of her time there. However, if she cannot find someone to take her place, she will die at the year's end, which will happen within one week. In sorrow, out of love for her the traveler signs the pact in order to save Angel's life, allowing her to be free even though she won't remember him (\\"The Pact\\", \\"Goodbye\\"). After her departure, the traveler nearly loses his mind out of heartache and isolation. The monotony of each day and the knowledge of being trapped for eternity unhinges him, and in his desperation he starts to destroy any mirror he can find around the church (\\"Just a Shadow\\", \\"Help!\\"). The traveler then witnesses the opening of a hidden trapdoor beneath the altar leading to the catacombs. Compelled by forces he cannot explain, the traveler descends (\\"Passage to Hell\\"). Following a mysterious light to a subterranean chamber, he encounters a crumbling statue of the Virgin Mary and breaks it open. Inside he discovers the mummified remains of a crucified, glowing corpse bearing \\"a crown of thorns.\\" Hearing an unearthly roar, in horror the traveler realizes that this is the body of Jesus Christ and flees back up into the church (\\"Catacomb\\"). Upon his re-emergence, the traveler is followed by what he describes as a myriad of winds and lights; \\"contorted faces and bodies.\\" Claiming to be unconcerned with living or dying anymore, the traveler questions these entities, who inform him that he has learned \\"the lie, the lie about the Cross.\\" While they tauntingly will not reveal why they are keeping the corpse of Jesus, the Entities state that they are the forces behind the ideals of God and Satan. The Entities survive on the beliefs inspired by the eternal battle between Good and Evil, though the Entities themselves are far higher beings beyond these concepts. They advise the traveler to simply \\"live [his] life the best [he] can, and leave the rest to [the Entities],\\" but after these revelations he loses his faith completely and denounces God. Now knowing what he perceives to be the truth of the world, the traveler cannot accept what he has learned and hangs himself in desperation and pain. As he leaps, he yells out, \\"THIS PLACE IS TERRIBLE,\\" the inscription on the door of the House of God (\\"This Place is Terrible\\").

Its city of license is Alameda, California, and it is under receivership by Patrick Communications. The station's studios are locatedhttp://www.927rev.com/contact.php in the Visitacion Valley district of San Francisco. The transmitter, formerly located atop of Bellaire Tower in the city's Russian Hill neighborhood, now transmits from a shared tower on Candlestick Hill in Bayview Park, San Francisco. History =Jazz music as KJAZ= As KJAZ from August 1, 1959, to July 31, 1994, the station aired a jazz format. Founded by Pat Henry, KJAZ prided itself on broadcasting only jazz music, and a 1965 station brochure proclaimed KJAZ \\"northern California's first and only fulltime jazz station\\". In 1994, KJAZ was sold after owner Ron Cowan, in a financial crisis, deemed the station unprofitable. Since the demise of the jazz format, some KJAZ programmers and announcers have made their way to KCSM. Since then, the KJAZ call sign has been used by various FM radio stations around the country, and is currently the call sign for a silent station in Point Comfort, Texas owned by Fort Bend Broadcasting of Austin, Texas. =Rock music as KXJO= Though listeners mounted a fundraising effort to keep KJAZ on the air (by some reports raising $1.5 million), the station was sold in 1994, and on July 31, KJAZ was converted to \\"La Z\\" a Spanish music station, the first of many different format changes the station would go through in the mid-late 1990s. From 1999 to 2002, it simulcast the rock format of KSJO in San Jose as KXJO. =92.7 Party, and Power 92.7= On May 26, 2002, the 92.7 frequency's history as a dance music outlet would begin as KPTI, \\"92.7 PARTY,\\" which was launched under former owner Spanish Broadcasting System. Nearly two years later, on March 17, 2004, it was sold to new owners, who flipped the format to mainstream urban as KBTB, \\"Power 92.7, The Beat of the Bay.\\" Power 92.7 debuted on April 15, 2004 with 48 straight hours of songs by Tupac Shakur, a rapper from Oakland. After it failed to attract an audience, along with controversy from rival KMEL (which made headlines in the press) and on top of that, seeing the sale falling apart, the station was put up for sale again. =Energy 92.7= KBTB was acquired by Flying Bear Media, backed by Alta Communications and Tailwind Capital. CEO Joe Bayliss flipped the station back to dance music on October 2, 2004 as Energy 92.7. The station kept the KBTB call letters for several months before changing to KNGY, and kept the slogan The Beat of the Bay for over a year, but changed it to Pure Dance in 2006. On July 17, 2005, KNGY moved its signal from its old tower on Russian Hill to the Sutro Tower, improving coverage in the South Bay, but later changed back to their old site due to signal issues. The effect was clear to South Bay listeners, who received a split signal between KNGY and KTOM, a country-format station from the Salinas area. In areas around the North Bay where line-of-site propagation is weak, listeners received a split signal between KNGY and KZSQ, a hot AC station from the Sonora, California area. Energy 92.7 was also heard on Comcast Digital Cable throughout the Bay Area on digital cable channel 964 and live online through the station's website. KNGY was a reporter in Billboard Magazine's Dance/Mix Show Airplay panel and was the most-listened-to dance/electronic radio station on the West Coast. KNGY as \\"Energy 92.7\\" offered a current-based mix of dance music, with Top 40, R&B; remixes, disco and club classics from the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s added into the presentation. It also broadcast sophisticated and mood-enhanced tracks including down-tempo groove, future jazz, electronic rock and chillout beats. Under Bayliss, KNGY quickly built a reputation as \\"The Gay Station\\"‚ÄîSan Francisco's first commercial radio station that appealed openly to the Bay Area's large and highly influential gay community, with a number of on-air DJs‚Äîand even a sportscaster‚Äîwho were openly gay. The station also became heavily involved in numerous gay-community events, including San Francisco's annual Gay Pride Parade in June. In fact, after Energy's demise in 2009, the station's morning show \\"Fernando and Greg in the Morning\\", which was widely popular with fans, was moved over to KMVQ. In December 2005, former KLLC program director John Peake was hired as Energy's new program director, filling the vacancy left by Chris Shebel. Prior to coming to San Francisco pre-KLLC, Peake was the PD of influential Top 40 KRBE/Houston, Texas, a station that was also known for adding dance cuts into their traditional playlist. In July 2008, Peake resigned from the PD job, which would be quickly filled by Don Parker, who, like Peake, also has credentials in programming dance-leaning stations as he was the PD of Rhythmic contemporary outlet KKFR/Phoenix during its dance-intensive days in the late 1980s and mid-1990s. On weekends, KNGY aired a show called \\"Ghetto House Radio\\" which aired every Saturday at midnight. The program featured a house/dance music mix with a mix of rap and \\"ghetto\\" music until 2a.m. Sunday morning, when Trevor Simpson's world town mix airs. In February 2009, KNGY added former KGO talk show host Karel to their lineup. His program aired from 9p.m. to midnight Monday through Thursdays and it was the only time that the station did not play any music. However, after five months, Karel's program was dropped from the lineup in June 2009.From www.radiokrl.com (June 30, 2009) =92.7 REV The Revolution= In July 2009, Flying Bear announced that KNGY was sold to Ed Stolz's Royce International Broadcasting for $6.5 million. AllAccess reported that the station will become a CHR-format station with the new callsign KREV. According to a published report,http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&article;=4194 Flying Bear was forced to sell the station after it was unable to renegotiate the terms of a $6 million loan held by a subsidiary of Wells Fargo Bank. In September 2009, KNGY's on-air and production staff were given notice that they were being laid off, and PD Don Parker gave a short farewell to listeners on the afternoon of September 10. Energy's final song was \\"Walk Away\\" by Kelly Clarkson.http://boards.radio- info.com/smf/index.php?topic=152592.msg1291720#msg1291720 At 9:08pm (PDT) that day, after a few false starts, KNGY's format was changed to Top 40 as \\"92.7 REV FM\\".http://www.mercurynews.com/topstories/ci_13318940 The first song on \\"REV FM\\" was P!nk's \\"Get This Party Started.\\" The flip to Top 40 marks KREV's entry into an already interesting CHR race in the San Francisco Bay Area, where it will have to compete for listeners with CBS Radio's Mainstream Top 40 KMVQ, iHeartMedia's Top 40 powerhouse KYLD and their Urban CHR sister KMEL both of whom have more signal coverage than KREV. KREV's playlist, station imaging and web site are essentially identical to that of KFRH in Las Vegas, which is also KREV's sister station. On October 12, 2009, the once- controversial morning show The Dog House returned to the Bay Area airwaves on KREV. To fill the hole left open by the flip of KNGY, KMVQ flipped their HD-2 sub-channel to dance as \\"Pulse Radio\\" in 2010. =Ed Stolz lawsuit by music copyright holders= On July 6, 2020, KREV one of the three FM stations owned by companies controlled by Ed Stolz‚Äôs Royce International Broadcasting are being transferred into a court-ordered receivership controlled by broker Larry Patrick after a lawsuit brought on by ASCAP and sixteen other music copyright holders.https://radioinsight.com/headlines/190923/ed-stolz-stations- transferred-to-receivership-after-lawsuit-from-music-copyright-holders/ References  External links  In the Spirit of KJAZ * Energy 92.7 Weekly Charts *U.S. Dance Radio Post *U.S. Dance Radio Megamix * Category:Contemporary hit radio stations in the United States REV Category:Radio stations established in 1959 ","title":"KREV (FM)"},{"id":"2151011","text":"Jenner & Block is an American law firm with offices in Chicago, London, Los Angeles, New York City and Washington, D.C. The firm is active in corporate litigation, business transactions, the public sector, and other legal fields. It has litigated several prominent cases before the United States Supreme Court. As of 2014, it is the 103rd largest law firm in the US, based on The American Lawyer's annual ranking of firms by headcount. History The firm was founded in Chicago in 1914 as Newman, Poppenhusen & Stern. Since its founding, the firm has had ten names. Name partner Albert E. Jenner, Jr., a former assistant counsel to the Warren Commission, established Jenner & Block's longstanding relationship representing General Dynamics in the 1950s.\\"Albert E. Jenner, 81, a Watergate Council\\", The New York Times, September 30, 1988; retrieved May 14, 2015. The name of the firm was changed to Raymond Mayer Jenner & Block in 1964 after Samuel W. Block became a name partner. In 1969, it was shortened to its present title. In late 1928, the former chief justice of the Illinois Supreme Court Floyd Thompson joined the firm. Known plainly as \\"The Judge,\\" Thompson handled several high-profile cases for the firm. Jenner & Block was one of the first national law firms to establish a Washington, D.C., practice specifically focused on appeals before the U.S. Supreme Court. It was once headed by Bruce Ennis, Jr., who argued more than a dozen cases before the Supreme Court, including three cases arising under different provisions of the same law, the landmark Telecommunications Act of 1996. The appellate practice is led by Paul M. Smith, a partner with the firm.Paul M. Smith, Chambers & Partners; retrieved May 14, 2015. The outgoing U.S. solicitor general, Donald Verrilli Jr., is a former member of the practice.Meet the Solicitor General, US Department of Justice; retrieved May 27, 2014.

Prominent legal work The firm has a history of litigating and representation in prominent cases, including several argued before the US Supreme Court. The firm's 1985 antitrust lawsuit of AT&T;, on behalf of MCI, sowed the seeds for the eventual break-up of telecommunications monopoly in the 1980s. The firm's involvement in civil rights cases spans decades. In the 1960s, the firm represented prominent Chicago cardiologist Jeremiah Stamler when he was subpoenaed to testify before the House Committee on Un-American Activities. The firm sued the Committee, seeking to have its mandate declared unconstitutional. After eight and a half years of litigation in the 1960s and 70s, the government agreed to drop its indictment against Dr. Stamler for contempt of Congress, and the doctor agreed to drop his civil suit against the Committee. In 1975, Congress officially abolished HUAC, by that time known as the Internal Security Committee. In 2009, firm chairman Anton R. Valukas was appointed as the examiner in the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, and he hired Jenner & Block to produce the report that captured the findings of a year-long investigation of the bank's finances. In 2010, the firm oversaw General Motors' $23.1 billion initial public offering of common stock and Series B mandatory convertible junior preferred stock, the largest US IPO ever at the time. The firm has achieved several victories before the US Supreme Court regarding free speech, gay rights, copyright, civil procedure, political asylum and other matters. The firm's first principal litigator, Edward R. Johnston, earned the firm's first Supreme Court victory, a landmark antitrust case against the US government (Maple Flooring Manufacturers Association v. U.S.) that allowed for trade association members to exchange information. The firm represented plaintiff Stephen Law in Law v. Siegel in the US Supreme Court in 2014; it had already been representing the plaintiff Law (who had earlier represented himself) in the US Court of Appeals (Ninth Circuit). The Supreme Court overturned a California court's decision to allow Law's home equity to be used as payment for legal fees to a trustee, even though the equity was protected by the state's homestead exemption. Jenner & Block has continued to represent environmental groups such as the Alliance for the Great Lakes and Natural Resources Defense Council in a Clean Water Act suit against Chicago's Metropolitan Water Reclamation District regarding raw sewage.U.S. v. Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago (2012), 11 C 8859. =Pro bono work= According to annual surveys by The American Lawyer, in 2014 and 2015, Jenner & Block was the leading law firm for per-attorney hours devoted to pro bono work in the US. From 2008 to 2015, it was the leader for five of those seven years. Recent pro bono victories include the acquittal of Jezon Young and the 2012 acquittal of Calvin Marshall who had been charged with murder. Notable cases *Maple Flooring Manufacturers' Association v. US: The firm had an early US Supreme Court victory in an antitrust case that helped establish its appellate credentials. The firm represented the Maple Flooring Manufacturers Association, a trade association based in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The US government charged that the group's activities ‚Äî such as sharing weekly statistics showing charges that had been made for various grades of lumber during the previous week ‚Äî violated the Sherman Act. The firm's principal litigator at the time, Edward Johnston, argued that the Association shared permissible economic information. In June 1925, the Court agreed. *Sam Insull cases: In the 1930s, former chief justice of the Illinois Supreme Court Floyd Thompson successfully defended Chicago utility czar Samuel Insull in three separate federal and state trials related to the collapse of his empire after the Great Depression. * Witherspoon v. Illinois: The firm represented William Witherspoon, who had been sentenced to death for the shooting death of a police officer, on a pro bono basis. In 1968, the US Supreme Court ruled that a state statute providing the state unlimited challenge for cause of jurors who might have any objection to the death penalty gave too much bias in favor of the prosecution. The Court reasoned: \\"A jury that must choose between life imprisonment and capital punishment can do little more ‚Äî and must do nothing less ‚Äî than express the conscience of the community on the ultimate question of life or death. Yet, in a nation less than half of whose people believe in the death penalty, a jury composed exclusively of such people cannot speak for the community.\\"Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 510 (1968); accessed January 4, 2016 The Court added: \\"To execute this death sentence would deprive [Witherspoon] of his life without the due process of the law.\\" As a result of the Witherspoon decision, more than 350 inmates on death row around the nation had their death sentences lifted. *Lawrence v. Texas: A significant case to ensure civil rights for the gay, lesbian and transgender community. In 2003, working with the Lambda Legal Defense Fund, the firm challenged Texas' anti-sodomy statute. The US Supreme Court struck down the statute, effectively invalidating anti-sodomy laws throughout the nation.Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003) Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote that two gay men arrested after police walked in on them having sex \\"are entitled to respect for their private lives. The state cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime.\\" * Lehman Brothers bankruptcy: After Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in 2008‚Äîthe largest bankruptcy in US history‚Äîthe court hired Jenner & Block's Chairman Anton Valukas to examine Lehman's collapse. Some commentators pointed to the bankruptcy as a factor contributing to the late 2000s global financial crisis. In March 2010, Valukas issued his 2,200-page report on the matter. * General Motors bankruptcy: In the late 2000s, General Motors had what The American Lawyer called a \\"near-death\\" experience as it filed for bankruptcy. In 2010, the $23 billion offering by GM set the record as the largest initial public offering (IPO) in history. Jenner & Block represented GM as it went through bankruptcy and the subsequent IPO. *Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association: The firm represented the Entertainment Merchants Association in a battle against a California law that restricted the sale or rental of violent video games to minors. In 2011, the US Supreme Court agreed with the firm's argument that the law violated the First Amendment's protection of freedom of speech and expression. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote that depictions of violence have never been subject to government regulation. *American Broadcasting Cos. v. Aereo, Inc.: The firm represented a group of broadcasting company clients in a fight against Aereo, Inc., a company that retransmitted copyrighted television programming without broadcaster authorization for a fee. In June 2014, the US Supreme Court agreed with the firm's argument that Aereo violated copyright law. Aereo filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2014. Recognition The firm has won many awards for its work.\\"Awards\\", Jenner & Block; retrieved May 14, 2015.

The New York office is a strong contributor to the firm's commitment to pro bono and public service. A team, along with the Veterans Legal Services Clinic at Yale Law School, successfully represented a proposed nationwide class of Vietnam War veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder who challenged their less-than-honorable discharges from the military. In addition to securing discharge upgrades for the named plaintiffs, the representation also prompted the Secretary of Defense to issue new guidance to the administrative boards hearing discharge upgrade requests to consider PTSD diagnoses for veterans, a result that should help thousands of veterans. In 2015, Jenner & Block was ranked first among all US law firms in the volume of its pro bono work and has ranked first in pro bono work in five of the past seven years, according to The American Lawyer annual rankings.\\"Jenner and Exelon: A business case for pro bono\\", Bloomberg BNA, 13 April 2015; retrieved May 11, 2015.

A limited edition includes a DVD on which frontman King Diamond tells the story of the Puppet Master. It is a concept album with a storyline telling the tale of a young couple who go to watch a puppet show in Budapest in the 1700s, and end up being turned into undead puppets by the Puppet Master and his wife. Plot The album opens at the end of the story, with the narrator giving a monologue as he is \\"hanging\\" from a wall, snow falling in the night outside. He reminisces about his life before his current predicament, giving small hints as to the horrors he was forced to witness and be subjected to (\\"Midnight\\"). The story shifts back eighteen years prior, to a nighttime puppet show in Budapest during Christmas. This particular puppet show is well known for both its life-sized, \\"grotesque\\" puppets, and the Puppet Master's inexplicable ability to make them dance without strings in the show's finale. The narrator, one of the audience members, is disturbed by the thought that one of the puppets, the Little Drummer Boy, looked at him as though it were \\"alive.\\" He also notices the puppet is bleeding (\\"The Puppet Master\\"). At the conclusion of the show, the narrator meets Victoria, a young lady who shares his sentiments about the puppet show. The two feel that the show was \\"magic,\\" which the narrator claims to also see in Victoria's eyes. The two talk and learn more about one another, culminating in the narrator kissing her. The couple begins a life together. However, a year later Victoria fails to return home after going to see another puppet show, and the fearful narrator sets out in the night to find her (\\"Magic\\"). In his search for Victoria, the narrator notices Emerencia, the Puppet Master's obese wife, emerge from the theater's cellar with a knife, a sack and a cart. Curious, he follows her. To his horror he witnesses Emerencia brutally murder a homeless man, taking his body back with her to the theater. She is careful not to let any blood spill from the corpse, keeping the knife inside her victim's body. Noticing that the door has remained open, the narrator attempts to follow Emerencia down into the cellar but is knocked unconscious by an unseen assailant (\\"Emerencia\\"). The narrator awakens on the floor of the cellar, tied up and surrounded by puppets. His eyes adjusting to the dark, he comes to the realization that the puppets are indeed made from human bodies. Upon scrutinizing one of them, he is devastated to find that one of the puppets has the exact same blue eyes as his beloved Victoria, confirming his worst fears (\\"Blue Eyes\\"). The Puppet Master and Emerencia then enter the cellar and begin performing a demonic ritual to convert the narrator into another puppet. First, the Puppet Master speaks an incantation to subdue the narrator's mind, but the frightened narrator \\"kicks\\" a shelf, knocking down and breaking a jar, the contents of which are revealed to be human blood. This infuriates the Puppet Master, but the ritual continues. The narrator's soul is taken from him, while his eyes are given \\"eternal life\\" due to his untimely breaking of the blood-filled jar (\\"The Ritual\\"). He then finds himself strapped to a hospital bed for the second and final part of the ritual. The Puppet Master and his wife stand in front of him with a scalpel. The Puppet Master leans over him and says: \\"First your eyes... then your skin... we will make you feel born again,\\" and starts to cut out his eyes. The Puppet Master uses an instrument to pull the eyeballs out of their sockets, cutting through the nerves holding the eyes in place. The Puppet Master then puts the eyeballs into a puppet's eye sockets, completing the work. The new puppet is placed on a shelf with the others, while the rest of the narrator's body is disposed of (\\"No More Me\\"). The narrator, in his new puppet form, can see and feel, but is otherwise unable to move and cannot sleep. He and Victoria, who is placed on a shelf across from him, can still \\"communicate with [their] eyes,\\" questioning why they were subjected to this horror. The couple are given injections of blood, which gives them mobility under the Puppet Master's direction, who affectionately refers to them as his \\"children.\\" After the injections successfully reanimate them for the first time, they are put back on their shelves in the cellar (\\"Blood to Walk\\"). The Puppet Master continues to train the narrator and Victoria for his upcoming puppet shows. The injections of blood last a maximum of an hour before their effects wear off; the narrator describes the hellish process as an unending cycle of living and dying, over and over. One night, the Puppet Master decides to try to have Victoria dance without strings, in spite of her fearful protests. As a result, Victoria knocks into the shelves of blood and breaks six of the jars. As punishment, the Puppet Master declares that she must be sent away to another puppet theater in Berlin (\\"Darkness\\"). The narrator is heartbroken, knowing he will lose Victoria again and is helpless to prevent it. The two converse for the final time as the narrator comforts her. In desperation, the narrator vows to find Victoria, and if he fails, he will be reunited with her in death. The couple declares their love for one another and they tearfully bid each other goodbye (\\"So Sad (Ghost's Song)\\"). The Puppet Master puts on his annual Christmas show, with the narrator starring as the new Little Drummer Boy. Without Victoria, the narrator is melancholic and desperate to escape his fate, even as he is forced to perform. In retaliation, he deliberately falls on the stage, breaking his drum and likely ruining the entire show (\\"Christmas\\"). Due to his actions during the Christmas performance, the narrator is sold to another shop, where his puppet body is pinned to the wall, a nail driven through its throat. The story returns to the present time, as the narrator describes how, in the eighteen years since he was sold, a rumor has spread that the Puppet Master's son and daughter will be opening a new puppet theater for children, describing how it will \\"be a bloody mess.\\" The narrator's appearance frightens those who enter the shop, as they sense something amiss with him and notice his eyes following them. The album and story end as the narrator admits he has never found his beloved Victoria, sadly wondering where she is. Unknown to him, Victoria is heard wondering where he may be as well (\\"Living Dead\\").

He also co-invented the Reed‚ÄìMuller code. Reed made many contributions to areas of electrical engineering including radar, signal processing, and image processing. He was part of the team that built the MADDIDA, guidance system for Northrop's Snark cruise missile ‚Äì one of the first digital computers. He developed and introduced the now-standard Register Transfer Language to the computer community while at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Lincoln Laboratory. He was a faculty member of the Electrical Engineering-Systems Department of the University of Southern California from 1962 to 1993. Reed was a member of the National Academy of Engineering (1979) and a Fellow of the IEEE (1973), a winner of the Claude E. Shannon Award, the IEEE Computer Society Charles Babbage Award, the IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal (1989) and with Gustave Solomon, the 1995 IEEE Masaru Ibuka Award. In 1998 Reed received a Golden Jubilee Award for Technological Innovation from the IEEE Information Theory Society. Anecdotes The University of Southern California graduate school of electrical engineering required doctoral students to pass an oral screening exam, in which there were eight categories of test questions. Reed always asked the questions about electromagnetism and specifically Maxwell's equations, which he obviously viewed as fundamental to communication theory. While a student in mathematics at the California Institute of Technology, Reed did not complete his required physical education courses due to time pressure and was set to enter the Navy. The only way he could graduate was to obtain a special release from Robert A. Millikan, the university's president and a former physical education instructor as well as a Nobel Prize winner and a noted hard-liner on the physical education requirement. As Reed was in Millikan's office pleading his case, he saw reprints of two papers he had published as an undergraduate on the president's table and drew them to Millikan's attention. Millikan smiled and said \\"You seem to me a healthy young man. I believe you will do well in the service of your country as a graduate of the California Institute of Technology.\\" Reed and colleagues demonstrated the MADDIDA computer to John von Neumann at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. The problem set for MADDIDA was computation of a mathematical function. Von Neumann, a noted lightning calculator, kept up with the computer and checked its results with a paper and pencil.

During a chase through central London, Tibble was fatally shot by Liam Quinn, a member of the Provisional Irish Republican Army. Death Four unarmed plain-clothed police officers, Trainee Detective Constables Derek Wilson and Kenneth Mathews and Police Constables Adrian Blackledge and Les White in two teams, had spent the day on the lookout for burglary suspects in the Fairholme Road area of Hammersmith. At one point during the course of the operation, Blackledge noticed a man behaving in a suspicious manner outside house number 39 on Fairholme Road; when he spotted the same individual thirty minutes later he decided to question him. Blackledge approached the suspect and introduced himself as a police officer and requested that the man empty out his pockets. The suspect was Liam Quinn, a US citizen from an Irish Republican family in San Francisco who had immersed himself in all things Irish, including affecting an Irish accent. A Provisional IRA volunteer, he had replaced Brendan Dowd as a member of the IRA's active service unit operating in London at the time.The Road To Balcombe Street, Steven Moysey, Haworth (2007), Blackledge noticed that Quinn was carrying a lot of Irish money on him, and so told Quinn he wanted to escort him back to the address he had been seen leaving in Fairholme Road to see what he had been up to. Quinn then attempted to flee, running west down Charleville Road, pursued by Blackledge, heading toward where Wilson and Matthews were sitting on a bench. The pair joined the chase and Wilson later stated that he heard the sound of a motorbike approaching from behind. The rider was 21-year-old off-duty PC Stephen Tibble, who was married and had been a serving officer for six months. Initially flagged down by Wilson, Tibble gave chase on his motorbike, riding past the pursuing officers and the running Quinn, and pulled to a stop at the junction of Charleville Road and Gledstanes Road. Tibble dismounted from his motorbike, crouched and spread out his arms to block the path of the suspect and catch hold of him. At that point, Quinn pulled a gun out and shot Tibble twice in the chest at point-blank range with a .38 Long Colt revolver. Tibble died three hours later in hospital. It is often erroneously believed that Quinn fled into the tunnel at Barons Court tube station, but in fact he had been pursued by Wilson on Tibble's motorbike and evaded capture by running through the ground floor of a tower block off Talgarth Road. Bomb factory The police discovered that the flat in Fairholme Road that Quinn had been seen entering was a bomb factory. The basement was found to contain enough bomb-making equipment to make half a dozen high-explosive bombs. Also found were an automatic pistol and ammunition as well as English and Irish money, wigs and a letter addressed to Joe O'Connell, another IRA volunteer. The landlord stated to police that a \\"Michael Wilson\\" occupied the flat. The discovery of the factory led police to identify four other suspects, who later became known as the Balcombe Street gang after they held a couple hostage in the Balcombe Street Siege in Marylebone. The London-based IRA active service unit had been responsible for a series of bombings and killings in England. This included the inadvertent car-bomb killing of Dr. Gordon Hamilton-Fairley, a cancer specialist who was not the target, and the assassination of Ross McWhirter, a conservative political activist and a co-founder of the Guinness Book of Records; he was shot on his doorstep by the unit after he offered a reward for their capture.Balcombe Street gang's reign of terror BBC News.

On reaching his sixteenth year, he began his studies at the University of Berlin, paying special attention to theology and the Talmud. He also mastered the English language and studied English literature. In 1855 Deutsch was appointed assistant in the library of the British Museum. He worked intensely on the Talmud and contributed no less than 190 papers to Chambers' Encyclopaedia, as well as essays on the Targum and the Samaritan Pentateuch for Smith's Dictionary of the Bible, essays for John Kitto's Biblical dictionary, and articles in periodicals. The monument of his official work in the British Museum is to be found in the Phoenician Inscriptions, edited by William Sandys Wright Vaux, to whom Deutsch rendered assistance.

It was formerly regarded as a species under the name Hosta undulata (Otto & A.Dietr.) L.H.Bailey. It is not accepted as a species by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families ,, search for \\"Hosta undulata\\" and has been relegated to cultivar status by Schmid. Tolerating temperatures as low as , H. 'Undulata' and its related cultivars are widely grown in temperate zones. Garden performance is best in partial to moderate shade, in well-drained moist soil. Hostas in the 'Undulata' group include an all-green cultivar, 'Undulata Erromena'; a white- edged cultivar, 'Undulata Albomarginata'; and white-centered (medio- variegated) cultivars that may be grouped according to the amount of white in the leaf. The typical H. 'Undulata' has a wide white center, wider than the green of the margins. Over time (or as a cultivar selection), the white center can narrow to a form classified as H. 'Undulata Univittata'; the displayed picture is more of this type. These four are the only registered Undulata cultivar names.hostaregistrar.org Other names for the white-centered forms include Undulata variegata, Undulata mediopicta, and registered forms such as H. 'Middle Ridge' and 'White Feather'. The expansion of the green margins (narrowing of the center) depends on garden culture. In time, the all-green 'Undulata Erromena' cultivar may appear. As this all-green form is significantly more vigorous than the variegated form, it can quickly overwhelm a planting of 'Undulata'. Division of the fast-growing clumps to remove undesired leaf forms is easily accomplished. In areas with significant summer heat, or where planted in too much light, the white-centered forms are also prone to a greening of the leaf centers, shown as a misting that darkens with the season. This is typical behavior and not indicative of disease or mutation. The substance of the leaves is among the thinnest of hostas, making them particularly subject to slug damage. All hostas are attractive to deer. The flower scapes of all H. 'Undulata' cultivars are tall and offer pale lavender blossoms which are very attractive to bees. The flowers for the various 'Undulata' cultivars are essentially similar. These cultivars are effectively sterile and do not generally set seed either by self-pollination or by attempted hybridization. The variety listed as Hosta undulata var. undulata has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

Dietrich (1767); portrait by Anton Graff Christian Wilhelm Ernst Dietrich (30 October 1712 ‚Äì 23 April 1774) was a German painter and art administrator. In his own works, he was adept at imitating many earlier artists, but never developed a style of his own. Biography Christian Wilhelm Ernst Dietrich, Portrait of a Woman with a Straw Hat He was born at Weimar, where he was brought up early to the profession of art by his father Johann Georg, then painter of miniatures to the court of the duke. Dietrich's sister was painter Maria Dorothea Dietrich. Having been sent to Dresden to perfect himself under the care of Johann Alexander Thiele, he had the good fortune to finish in two hours, at the age of eighteen, a picture which attracted the attention of the king of Saxony. Augustus II was so pleased with Dietrich's readiness of hand that he gave him means to study abroad, and visit in succession the chief cities of Italy and the Netherlands. There he learned to copy and to imitate masters of the previous century with a versatility that was truly surprising. Johann Joachim Winckelmann, to whom he had been recommended, did not hesitate to call him the Raphael of landscape. Yet in this branch of his practice he merely imitated Salvator Rosa and Allaert van Everdingen. He was more successful in aping the style of Rembrandt, and numerous examples of this habit may he found in the galleries of St. Petersburg, Vienna and Dresden. At Dresden, indeed, there are pictures acknowledged to be his, bearing the fictitious dates of 1636 and 1638, and the name of Rembrandt. Among Dietrich's cleverest reproductions we may account that of Ostade's manner in the Itinerant Singers at the National Gallery. His skill, in catching the character of the later masters of Holland is shown in candlelight scenes, such as the Squirrel and the Peep-Show at St. Petersburg, where we are easily reminded of Godfried Schalcken. Dietrich tried every branch of art except portraits, painting Italian and Dutch views alternately with scripture scenes and still life. In 1741 he was appointed court painter to Augustus III at Dresden, with an annual salary of 400 thalers, conditional on the production of four cabinet pictures a year. This condition, no doubt, accounts for the presence of fifty-two of the master's panels and canvases in one of the rooms at the Dresden museum. In 1746, he was appointed inspector of galleries. Dietrich, though popular and probably the busiest artist of his time, never produced anything of his own; and his imitations are necessarily inferior to the originals which he affected to copy. His best work is certainly that which he gave to engravings. A collection of these at the British Museum, produced on the general lines of earlier men, such as Ostade and Rembrandt, reveal both spirit and skill. Dietrich, after his return from the Peninsula, generally signed himself Dieterich, and with this signature most of his extant pictures are inscribed. He died at Dresden, after he had successively filled the important appointments of director of the school of painting at the Meissen porcelain factory (appointed 1763) and professor of the Dresden Academy of Art (appointed 1765).

He represented Connecticut as a delegate to the Continental Congress and in the United States House of Representatives. Early life Sturges was born in Fairfield in the Connecticut Colony where his father, Samuel (1712‚Äì1771) was a surveyor. His mother, Ann (Burr) Sturges was Samuel's second wife. His great-great grandfather, also Jonathan Sturges (1624‚Äì1700), was one of the original settlers of the town. Sturges graduated from Yale in 1759. He earned his master's degree from Yale in 1761, and his Doctor of Laws degree from Yale in 1806. He read law, and was admitted to the bar in May 1772. He began the practice of law in Fairfield. Career Sturges' entry into public service came when his neighbors in Fairfield sent him to the Connecticut House of Representatives in 1772. He was returned every year until 1784. In 1773 he served Fairfield County as a justice of the peace, and in 1775 he served as the judge of probate court. Connecticut sent him as a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1786. He served as a member of the Connecticut Council of Assistants from 1786 to 1788. When the new United States government was formed, the voters elected him to the U.S. House as a Pro-Administration Party candidate.

William DeWeese (born April 18, 1950) is an American politician who is a former member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. A member of the Democratic Party, DeWeese served as the 135th Speaker of the Pennsylvania House from 1993-94. After five years of investigation by Republican State Attorney General Tom Corbett, he was indicted in December 2009 on six charges of conflict of interest, theft and criminal conspiracy on accusations that two members of his staff used state resources to campaign for political office. The trial began January 23, 2010. He was re-elected in 2010 despite the charges, but was convicted of five of the six felony charges on February 6, 2012. In April 2012, DeWeese was sentenced to 30 to 60 months in state prison, and subsequently resigned his house seat. He maintains that the prosecution was politically motivated, and part of an ongoing feud with Corbett, who became Governor in 2011. Background DeWeese was born April 18, 1950, in Pittsburgh and raised in rural Greene County. After earning a B.A., History at Wake Forest University, he joined the United States Marine Corps 1972‚Äì1975. State House After leaving the Marines, DeWeese was elected to the Pennsylvania House in a 1976 special election and represented the 50th district (consisting of all of Greene and parts of Fayette and Washington Counties) for the ensuing thirty-six years. DeWeese's ascent through the echelons of House Democratic leadership began when he was elected by his colleagues as Majority Whip in 1988. Upon the death of Speaker of the House James Manderino, DeWeese was elected House Majority Leader in January 1990, serving in that position until he was elected Speaker of the House for the 1993‚Äì94 term. In 1994, he lost the Speakership when Democrat Rep. Tom Stish switched parties, giving the GOP the majority. He went on to serve as Minority Leader from 1994 until 2006. With the election of fellow Democrat Ed Rendell as Governor of Pennsylvania in 2003, DeWeese was able to wield more influence than otherwise would have been expected from a Minority legislator. Following November 2006 elections, a tight race in Chester County gave a slim 102-101 majority to the Democrats, DeWeese became Democratic speaker-designate. Days before the General Assembly convened on January 2, 2007, Rep. Thomas Caltagirone of Berks County announced he would not support DeWeese as speaker but would remain a Democrat. For the second time, DeWeese was denied the speakership by a member of his own party. DeWeese then nominated Philadelphia County Republican Rep. Dennis O'Brien for the office of Speaker. O'Brien defeated fellow Northeast Philadelphia Republican John Perzel in a 105‚Äì97 vote. =Role in the 2005 legislative pay raise= DeWeese supported a legislative and judicial pay raise in 2005. After criticism from the media and activist groups, DeWeese joined his colleagues in a near unanimous repeal of the pay raise. DeWeese reorganized the Democratic Caucus following the vote. Members who voted in favor of the pay raise were promoted to those positions; while those who voted against lost such positions as a result of their opposition. Republicans and a small number of fellow Democrats, including Governor Ed Rendell, criticized DeWeese's move; but he stood by his decision, explaining that those who opposed the pay-raise legislation knew the realignment would be a consequence. Despite the defeats of several legislative leaders in the wake of the pay scandal, DeWeese fought off a 2006 primary election challenge and was elected for an additional term in office on November 7, 2006. =2007 speaker election= In 2006, the Democratic party won a 102‚Äì101 majority in the House, giving DeWeese a second chance at the speaker's gavel. However, several Democratic representatives were rumored to be unhappy with DeWeese. Among them were Rep. Rosita Youngblood of Philadelphia, whom DeWeese accused of being \\"owned lock, stock and barrel\\" by Perzel Incorporated. Caltagirone publicly announced his intention to support Perzel, thereby denying DeWeese the Speakership.Democrat plans to support Perzel, spoiling party speakership , zwire.com, December 30, 2006; retrieved 2012-01-23. However, Democrats foiled Perzel's move by nominating a Republican, Dennis O'Brien for Speaker. O'Brien went on to win the election. =Bonus investigation= DeWeese initially attempted to block Pennsylvania Attorney General Tom Corbett's investigation into whether the House Democratic caucus made illegal payments to staffers, with motions to quash suboepenas and exclude evidence seized.

On December 15, 2009, DeWeese was indicted on one count of conflict of interest, four counts of theft and one count of criminal conspiracy. He was accused of paying a full-time political operative with state funds and directing his district office staff to do political work on state time.

He resigned from his leadership role after he was indicted on charges unrelated to the issues at the center of the Bonusgate case. Despite this reduced role in the Democratic caucus, the Pennsylvania Report expected DeWeese to \\"find some way to exert his influence and thus continue to be a power player and force behind-the-scenes in the PA House\\" and cautioned against anyone counting him out. On February 6, 2012, a jury found DeWeese guilty of five of the six felony counts with which he was charged, including three counts of theft, one count of conflict of interest and one count of conspiracy. He was acquitted on a single theft charge. After the verdict was delivered, DeWeese maintained the charges were politically motivated, and vowed to remain in the House until he was sentenced, at which time he said he would resign. DeWeese was the only Democrat to file for election to his House seat, and a Commonwealth Court judge ruled that his name could remain on the April 2012 primary ballot. He was sentenced to 30 to 60 months in state prison on April 24, 2012, the same day in which he resigned his House seat. His subsequent requests to be released on bail pending appeal were denied by the State Supreme Court, and he was incarcerated at the Camp Hill State Prison. In August 2012, a Commonwealth Court judge ruled in favor of State Democrats who had sought to have DeWeese's name removed from the general election ballot; the ruling allowed Democrats to select a new candidate to take DeWeese's place on the ballot.

Life and career Dingestedt was born at Halsdorf, Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel), Germany, and later studied at the University of Marburg nearby. In 1836 he became a master at the Lyceum in Kassel, from where he was transferred to Fulda in 1838. In 1839 he wrote Unter der Erde (\\"Beneath the Earth\\"), a novel which obtained considerable success. In 1841, Lieder eines kosmopolitischen Nachtw√§chters, the book by which he is best remembered, was published. These poems, animated as they are by a spirit of bitter opposition to everything that savours of despotism, were an effective contribution to the political poetry of the day. The popularity of this book determined Dingelstedt to take up a literary career, and in 1841 he obtained an appointment on the staff of the Augsburger Allgemeine Zeitung. In 1843, however, the satirist of German princes accepted, to general surprise, his appointment as private librarian to the king of W√ºrttemberg. In the same year he married the celebrated Bohemian opera singer, Jenny Lutzer (1816-1877). In 1845 he published a volume of poems dealing with then modern life, some of which possessed merit of a literary rather than strictly poetical nature. A subsequent collection, published in 1852, attracted little attention. He attained the position of intendant at the court theatre in Munich as a result of the success of his tragedy Das Haus der Barneveldt (1850), and he soon became the center of literary society there. He incurred, however, the animosity of the Jesuit clique at court, and in 1856 was suddenly dismissed on the most frivolous of charges. A similar position was offered to him at Weimar through the influence of Liszt, and he remained there until 1867. His administration was most successful, and he especially distinguished himself by presenting all Shakespeare's historical plays upon the stage in an unbroken cycle. In 1867 he became director of the court opera house in Vienna, and in 1872 of the Hofburgtheater, a position which he held until his death in Vienna on May 15, 1881. He was ennobled in 1867 by the king of Bavaria and in 1876 was created Freiherr by the emperor of Austria. His remains are buried beside his wife's at Wiener Zentralfriedhof. His other works include M√ºnchener Bilderbogen (1879), an autobiographical sketch of his Munich career, Die Amazone, an art novel of considerable merit (1869), translations of several of Shakespeare's comedies, and several writings dealing with questions of practical dramaturgy. Dingelstedt's S√§mtliche Werke appeared in 12 vols. (1877-1878), but this edition is far from complete.

He was the Dumbarton Oaks Professor of Pre-Columbian Studies at Harvard University and the chair of its anthropology department between 2012 and 2019. Urton retired from Harvard in 2020, after multiple former students accused him of sexual harassment. Education and career Urton received his B.A. from the University of New Mexico in 1969, and his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 1971 and 1979, respectively. He was a professor at Colgate University from 1978 to 2002. He is married to artist and anthropologist Julia Meyerson. Urton is a specialist in Andean archaeology, particularly the quipu (khipu) numerical recording system used in the Inca empire in the 15th and 16th centuries. Along with anthropologist Sabine Hyland, he is one of the most prominent advocates of the theory that the quipus encode linguistic as well as numerical information. From 2001 to 2005 he was a MacArthur Fellow. Sexual harassment allegations According to an investigation by The Harvard Crimson, Urton was the subject of a sexual harassment complaint from a former student in 2016. The student alleged that Urton \\"pressured her into 'unwelcome sex'\\" in exchange for a recommendation letter. Urton responded that the allegations were \\"either untrue, inaccurate, or misleading\\". More allegations emerged following the publication of the investigation. UC-San Diego professor Jade d'Alpoim Guedes alleged that Urton had inappropriately propositioned her for sex while she was a graduate student at Harvard. It was also alleged that Urton harassed students at his field school in San Jose de Moro, and the anthropology department received further complaints that were not made public. After 25 faculty members and nearly 400 students signed letters calling for his resignation, Urton retired from Harvard in July 2020. The allegations against Urton surfaced amidst reports of a general culture of sexual harassment and gender discrimination at Harvard's anthropology department. In June 2020, over fifty former students and faculty signed a letter complaining that under Urton's leadership, the department was an \\"old boys‚Äô club\\" that fostered \\"an environment that tolerated gender-based harassment, [...] sexual misconduct, sexism, and misogyny.\\" In 2015, while Urton was the chair of the department, a Title IX gender discrimination lawsuit was brought against it by former professor Kimberly Theidon. The lawsuit primarily concerned multiple allegations of sexual harassment against Urton's colleague Theodore C. Bestor, but also included the accusation that Urton had protected Bestor and \\"intentionally sabotaged\\" Theidon's application for tenure because of her advocacy for students who experienced sexual harassment. The complaints were dismissed by a federal court in 2018, with Judge Leo T. Sorokin writing that Urton had responded promptly and satisfactorily. The current department leadership has acknowledged that these are \\"long-standing problems\\" and formed a committee to address them.

RGD is responsible for attaching biological information to the rat genome via structured vocabulary, or ontology, annotations assigned to genes and quantitative trait loci (QTL), and for consolidating rat strain data and making it available to the research community. RGD is working with groups such as the Programs for Genomic Applications at MCW and the National BioResource Project for the Rat (NBPR- Rat) in Japan to collect and make available comprehensive physiologic data for a variety of rat strains. They are also developing a suite of tools for mining and analyzing genomic, physiologic and functional data for the rat, and comparative data for rat, mouse and human. RGD began as a collaborative effort between leading research institutions involved in rat genetic and genomic research. Its goal, as stated in RFA: HL-99-013, was the establishment of a Rat Genome Database to collect, consolidate, and integrate data generated from ongoing rat genetic and genomic research efforts and make these data widely available to the scientific community. A secondary, but critical goal was to provide curation of mapped positions for quantitative trait loci, known mutations and other phenotypic data. The rat continues to be extensively used by researchers as a model organism for investigating pharmacology, toxicology, general physiology and the biology and pathophysiology of disease. In recent years, there has been a rapid increase in rat genetic and genomic data. In addition to this, the Rat Genome Database has become a central point for information on the rat for research and now features information on not just genetics and genomics, but physiology and molecular biology as well. There are tools and data pages available for all of these fields that are curated by RGD staff. Data RGD's Data page lists eight types of data stored in the database: Genes, QTLs, Markers, Maps, Strains, Ontologies, Sequences and References. Of these, six are actively used and regularly updated. The RGD \\"Maps\\" datatype refers to legacy genetic and radiation hybrid maps. This data has been largely supplanted by the rat whole genome sequence. The \\"Sequences\\" data type is not a full list of either genomic, transcript or protein sequences, but rather mostly contains PCR primer sequences which define simple sequence length polymorphism (SSLP) and expressed sequence tag (EST) Markers. Such sequences are useful primarily for researchers still using these markers for genotyping their animals and for distinguishing between markers of the same name. The six major data types in RGD are as follows: *Genes: Initial gene records are imported/updated from the National Center for Biotechnology Information's (NCBI's) Gene database on a weekly basis. Data imported during this process includes the Gene ID, Genbank/RefSeq nucleotide and protein sequence identifiers, HomoloGene group IDs and Ensembl Gene, Transcript and Protein IDs. Additional protein-related data is imported from the UniProtKB database. RGD curators review the literature and manually curate GO, diseases, phenotypes and pathways for rat genes, diseases and pathways for mouse genes, and diseases, phenotypes and pathways for human genes. In addition, the site imports GO annotations for mouse and human genes from the GO Consortium, rat electronic annotations from UniProt and mouse phenotype annotations from the Mouse Genome Database/Mouse Genome Informatics (MGD/MGI). *QTLs: RGD's staff manually curates data for rat and human QTLs from the literature where such publications exist or from records directly submitted by researchers. Mouse QTL records, including Mammalian Phenotype (MP) ontology assignments, are imported directly from MGI. For rat and human QTLs, curation includes assigning MP and disease ontology annotations. QTL positions are automatically assigned based on the genomic positions of peak and/or flanking markers or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). QTL records link to information about related strains, candidate genes, associated markers and related QTLs. *Strains: As for QTL records, RGD strain records are either manually curated from the literature or submitted by researchers. Strain records include information about the origin and availability of the strain, associated phenotypes, whether the strain is a model for a human disease, and any information that is available about breeding, behavior, husbandry, etc. Strain records link to information about related genes and QTLs, associated strains (e.g. parental strains or substrains) and, where available, strain-specific nucleotide variants. For congenic and mutant strains, genomic positions are assigned for the introgressed region (congenic strains) or the location of the mutated sequence (mutant strains). RGD does not import data for mouse strains. *Markers: Because genetic markers such as SSLPs and ESTs have been, and continue to be, used for QTLs and strains, RGD stores marker data for rat, human and mouse. Marker data includes the sequences of the associated forward and reverse PCR primers, genomic positions and links to NCBI's Probe database. Marker records link to associated QTL, strain and gene records. *Ontologies: In order to make RGD's data both human readable and available for computational analysis and retrieval, RGD relies on the use of multiple ontologies. As of July 2015, RGD used 16 different ontologies to express the various types of data applicable to RGD's diverse datatypes. Ontology annotations are assigned manually by curators or are imported from external sources through the use of automated pipelines. Six of the ontologies in use at RGD were created or co-created at RGD and seven are under development by RGD staff members and/or collaborators, these being ontologies for Pathway (PW), Rat Strains (RS), Vertebrate Traits (VT), Disease (RDO), Clinical Measurements (CMO), Measurement Methods (MMO) and Experimental Conditions (XCO). Ontologies which are imported from outside sources are updated weekly. *References: RGD references are scientific publications that have been used for curation or are sources for data objects such as QTLs and strains. For references accessed via NCBI's PubMed, imported data includes the title, authors, citation and PubMed ID. In some cases, a reference is an internal record for processes such as automated pipelines or a personal communication, giving users of the database an indication of the source of a particular piece of data. PubMed records are not available for these. Each reference record links to all of the data curated from that article, including genes, QTLs, strains and ontology annotations. Genome tools RGD's Genome tools include both software tools developed at RGD and tools from third party sources. =Genome tools developed at RGD= RGD develops web-based tools designed to use the data stored in the RGD database for analyses in rat and across species. These include: *Gene Annotator: The Gene Annotator or GA tool takes as input a list of gene symbols, RGD IDs, GenBank accession numbers, Ensembl identifiers, and/or a chromosomal region and retrieves gene orthologs, external database identifiers and ontology annotations for the corresponding genes in RGD. The data can be downloaded into an Excel spreadsheet or analyzed in the tool. The \\"Annotation Distribution\\" function displays a list of terms in each of seven categories with the percentage of genes from the input list with annotations to each term. The \\"Comparison Heat Map\\" function allows comparisons of annotations for genes in the input list across two ontologies or across two branches of the same ontology. *Variant Visualizer: Variant Visualizer (VV) is a viewing and analysis tool for rat strain-specific sequence polymorphisms. VV takes as input a list of gene symbols or a genomic region as defined by chromosome, start and stop positions or by two gene or markers symbols. The user must also select their strains of interest from a list of strains for which whole genome sequences exist and can set parameters for the variants in the result set. Output is a heatmap-type display of variants. Additional information for individual variants can be viewed in a \\"detail pane\\" display. *OLGA - Object List Generator & Analyzer: OLGA is a search engine designed to allow users to run multiple queries, generate a list of objects from each query and flexibly combine the results. OLGA takes as input either a list of object symbols or search parameters based on ontology annotations or position. The final list of genes, QTLs or strains can be downloaded or submitted to the GA Tool, the Variant Visualizer or the Genome Viewer from within the tool. *Genome Viewer: The Genome Viewer (GViewer) tool provides users with complete genome views of genes, QTLs and mapped strains annotated to a function, biological process, cellular component, phenotype, disease, pathway, or chemical interaction. GViewer allows Boolean searches across multiple ontologies. Output is displayed against a karyotype of the rat genome. *Overgo Probe Designer: Overgo probes are pairs of partially overlapping 22mer oligonucleotides derived from repeat-masked genomic sequence and used as high specific activity probes for genome mapping. The Overgo Probe Designer tool takes as input a nucleotide sequence and outputs a list of optimized probe sequences containing the requisite 8 nucleotide overlap on their 3' ends. *ACP Haplotyper: The ACP Haplotyper creates a \\"visual haplotype\\" that can be used to identify conserved and non-conserved chromosomal regions between any of the 48 rat strains characterized as part of the ACP project. For the selected chromosome and between the selected strains, the tool compares the allele size data for microsatellite markers on the selected genetic or RH map. *SNPlotyper: SNPlotyper is a visualization and analysis tool for Rat SNP data imported from dbSNP and Ensembl. It enables users to view haplotype blocks shared between strains and identify informative (polymorphic) markers between two or more strains. Data in SNPlotyper is legacy genotyping data and does not include the strain-specific variants derived from WGS of rat strains. =Third party genome tools adapted for use with RGD data= RGD offers several \\"third party\\" software tools that have been adapted for use on the website utilizing data stored in the RGD database. These include: *Genome Browsers: As of July 2015, RGD supported two types of genome browsers for viewing data for rat, mouse and human. Both tools, GBrowse and JBrowse have been or are being developed by the Generic Model Organism Database. These tools allow the user to view the location of a genetic landmark (sequence, gene, locus, marker, and/or oligonucleotide) on the genome of the applicable species. They also allow comparisons between species via the use of \\"synteny tracks\\" and links between instances of the browsers for the different species. *RatMine: RatMine is a rat-centric version of the InterMine software. It enables users to mine and analyze rat data from diverse databases including RGD, NCBI, UniProtKB and Ensembl in a single location using a consistent format. The InterMine platform has been adapted for multiple species in other databases and is designed to be interoperable between instances so that users can query across species from the RatMine interface. *Virtual Comparative Map: The Virtual Comparative Map (VCMap) was originally developed to explore the syntenic relationships between rat, mouse and human genomes. A new version of VCMap is now available which also incorporates cow, pig and chicken. Users select a \\"primary\\" or \\"backbone\\" species, then can view the syntenic regions in one or more of the other species. Additional data and tools =Phenotypes and Models portal= RGD's Phenotypes and Models portal focuses on strains, phenotypes and the rat as a model organism for physiology and disease. The Phenotypes and Models portal has five sections: \\"Phenotypes\\", \\"Strains & Models\\", \\"Meet Joe Rat\\", \\"PhenoMiner\\" and \\"Strain Medical Records\\". *Phenotypes: The Phenotypes section contains a large body of data from the PhysGen Program for Genomic Applications project, an NHLBI- funded project to \\"develop consomic and knockout rat strains, phenotypically characterize these strains, and provide these resources to the scientific community.\\". Data categories include measurements of cardiovascular, renal and respiratory function, blood chemistry, body morphology and behavior. Links are also provided to protocols for phenotyping rats and to similar high-throughput phenotyping data at the National BioResource Project for the Rat in Japan (NBRP-Rat). *Strains & Models: The Strains and Models section contains general information on rat strains, including information about strain availability and animal husbandry, and links to the RGD strain search and to review articles about rat strains. The section also includes a subsection about disease models that gives detailed information about which rat strains have been used as models for human cardiovascular disease, neurological disease, mammary cancer, diabetes, respiratory diseases, and immune and inflammatory diseases. *Meet Joe Rat: \\"Meet Joe Rat\\" is designed as a general information resource for rat researchers. The Photos and Images pages link to images of PGA/PhysGen parental and consomic strains which in turn link to data for those strains. \\"Ratday\\" links to the yearly RGD rat calendar. \\"Community Submissions\\" gives information and forms for submitting photos, for registering strains and for submitting quantitative phenotype data for PhenoMiner. The final subsection contains information about strain availability. *PhenoMiner: PhenoMiner is a database and web application for finding and analyzing quantitative rat phenotype data. Data is annotated to ontologies for rat strain, clinical measurement, measurement method, and experimental condition. Experiments are categorized by the trait or disease assessed by the measurement. The use of standardized vocabularies and data formats allows comparison of values across experiments for the same measurement. The PhenoMiner results page includes a graph of the measurement values and a downloadable table of the values with their accompanying metadata. A link is provided to give users the opportunity to submit their own data to the database. *Strain Medical Records: RGD's Strain Medical Records (SMR) are designed to consolidate what is known about a particular strain. Information such as coat coloring, average body weights at various time points for both male and female, and information about reproduction is presented. Average values for quantitative phenotype measurements such as blood pressure, heart rate and blood chemistry for rats of that strain under standard/control conditions are given along with the corresponding range of values for other commonly used strains. Each SMR links to source(s) where the strain can be obtained, to PhenoMiner for the quantitative phenotype data and to variant, QTL and microarray expression data. =Diseases= As of July 2015, RGD had nine disease portals: *Cancer *Cardiovascular Disease *Diabetes *Immune and Inflammatory Disease *Neurological Disease *Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome *Renal Disease *Respiratory Disease *Sensory Organ Disease Disease portals consolidate the data in RGD for a specific disease category and present it in a single group of pages. Genes, QTLs and strains annotated to any disease in the category are listed, with genome-wide views of their locations in rat, human and mouse (see \\"Genome Viewer\\" in Genome tools developed at RGD). Additional sections of the portal display data for phenotypes, biological processes and pathways related to the disease category. Pages are also supplied to give users access to information about rat strains used as models for one or more diseases in the category, tools that could be used to analyze the data and additional resources related to the disease category. =Pathways= RGD's Pathway resources include an ontology of pathway terms (encompassing not only metabolic pathways but also disease, drug, regulatory and signaling pathways), as well as interactive diagrams of the components and interactions of selected pathways; \\"Pathway Suites and Suite Networks\\", i.e. groupings of related pathways which all contribute to a larger process such as glucose homeostasis or gene expression regulation; and Physiological Pathway diagrams which display networks of organs, tissues, cells and molecular pathways at the whole animal or systems level. =Knockouts= Until recently, direct, specific genomic manipulations in the rat were not possible. However, with the rise of technologies such as Zinc finger nuclease- and CRISPR -based mutagenesis techniques, that is no longer the case. Groups producing rat gene knockouts and other types of genetically modified rats include the Human and Molecular Genetics Center at MCW. RGD links to information about the rat strains produced in these studies via pages about the PhysGen Knockout project and the MCW Gene Editing Rat Resource Center (GERRC), accessed from RGD page headers. Funding for both the PhysGenKO project and the GERRC came from the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI). The stated goal of both projects was to produce rats with alterations in one or more specific genes related to the mission of the NHLBI. Genes were nominated by rat researchers. Nominations were adjudicated by an External Advisory Board. In the case of the PhysGenKO project, many of the rats produced by the group were phenotyped using a standardized high-throughput phenotyping protocol and the data is available in RGD's PhenoMiner tool. Community outreach and education RGD reaches out to the rat research community in a variety of ways including an email forum, a news page, a Facebook page, and regular attendance and presentations at scientific meetings and conferences. Additional educational activities include the production of tutorial videos, both outlining how to use RGD tools and data, and on more general topics such as biomedical ontologies and biological (i.e. gene, QTL and strain) nomenclature. These videos are hosted on a number of online video hosting sites including YouTube. Funding RGD is funded by grant HL64541 from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) on behalf of the NIH. The grant includes some additional funding from the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). As of July 2015, the principal investigator of the grant was Mary E. Shimoyama, PhD who took over this leadership position from Howard J. Jacob, PhD in early 2015. Accession numbers and genome assembly As of July 2015, the most current genomic sequence for rat is available under accession numbers AABR07000001-AABR07073554 in the international sequence databases (GenBank, DDBJ and EMBL). The most current assembly is Rnor_6.0. The assembly level is \\"chromosome\\" and the genome representation is \\"full\\", including a sequence of the Y chromosome (missing from all previous assemblies).

Entre Nous (1867) was built on a similar plan, and was followed by some psychological novels: Le Cahier Bleu de Mlle Cibot (1868); Autour d'une Source (1869); Un Paquet de Lettres (1870); Babolain (1872); Les √âtangs (1875); Une Femme G√™nante (1875); and L'Enfant (1885). His Tristesses et Sourires (1884) is a delicate analysis of the niceties of family intercourse and its difficulties.

Distribution The plant is native to southeastern Europe and Asia Minor, from Italy east through the Balkans to Crimea and Turkey.Flora Europaea: Euphorbia myrsinites Etymology The specific epithet myrsinites is derived from the Greek word (myrsinites), which was used in Dioscorides's De Materia Medica to describe its similarity to (myrsine), aka myrtle (Myrtus communis). Description Myrtle spurge is an evergreen perennial. It has sprawling stems growing to 20‚Äì40 cm long. The leaves are spirally arranged, fleshy, pale glaucous bluish-green, 1‚Äì2 cm long. The flowers are inconspicuous, but surrounded by bright sulphur-yellow bracts (tinged red in the cultivar 'Washfield'); they are produced during the spring.Huxley, A., ed. (1992). New RHS Dictionary of Gardening. Plants spread primarily by seed and are capable of projecting seed up to 15 feet. =Toxicity= The plant's milky sap can cause significant skin and eye irritation in humans. Goggles, gloves and protective gear is often used when removing plants. Children are more susceptible than adults to symptoms from myrtle spurge, suggesting play areas not in proximity to the species. Pets can have similar reactions to myrtle spurge sap exposure. The species can be strongly allelopathic, preventing other plants from growing nearby. Cultivation Euphorbia myrsinites is cultivated as an ornamental plant for its distinctive silver-gray foliage, and is used in garden borders, 'modernist' mass plantings, and as a potted plant. It is planted in drought tolerant gardens in California and other dry climates. In the United Kingdom, the cultivated plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Noxious weed Euphorbia myrsinites is identified as a noxious weed and/or invasive species in some regions. Its cultivation is illegal in the U.S. state of Colorado, where it is classified as a Class A noxious weed, and landowners are legally required to eradicate it.Myrtle Spurge Myrtle spurge is also classified as a noxious weed in the U.S. state of Oregon, subject to quarantine.Oregon State-listed Noxious Weeds It was listed as a noxious weed in Salt Lake County, Utah in 2007, and since has been illegal for sale within the county.Salt Lake County Weeds Salt Lake County landowners and land managers are legally responsible to contain, control, or eradicate the species on their property. The Utah Native Plant Society has also formally recommended it be listed as a Utah state noxious weed. =Control= ;Physical control: Small infestations can be controlled through multiple years of digging up at least 4\\" of the root. Myrtle spurge is best controlled in the spring when the soil is moist and prior to seed production. Make sure to dispose of all the plant parts in the garbage instead of composting. ;Chemical control: Myrtle spurge can be effectively controlled with products containing 2, 4-D and dicamba (i.e. Weed B Gon) applied in late fall. ;Biological control: There are currently no known bio-controls, though the leafy spurge flea beetle (Aphthona), has had a high survival rate on myrtle spurge in laboratory studies.

She is best known for her humorous tales of modern youth collected in Junior Miss and her semi- autobiographical stories collected in Meet Me in St. Louis. Early life and career Benson was born in St. Louis, the youngest of five children of Alonzo Redway and Anna Prophater Smith. She attended the Mary Institute until she moved with her family to New York. She attended the Horace Mann School, studied dance and then started working when she was 17 years old. At age 19, she married Reynolds \\"Babe\\" Benson. The couple had a daughter, Barbara, and later divorced. She began her career writing weekly interview articles and film reviews for the New York Morning Telegraph. Between 1929 and 1941, she published 99 stories in The New Yorker, including nine signed with her pseudonym Esther Evarts.Yagoda, Ben. About Town: The New Yorker and the World It Made. Scribner, 2000. Her stories \\"The Overcoat\\" and \\"Suite 2049\\" were selected as O. Henry prize stories for 1935 and 1936. Her collection, People are Fascinating (Covici Friede,1936) includes almost all the stories Benson had then published in The New Yorker, plus four from American Mercury. She followed with another collection, Emily (Covici Friede, 1938). Stories of the Gods and Heroes (Dial Press, 1940) was juvenile fiction adapted from Thomas Bulfinch's Age of Fable. Women and Children First was a collection published by Random House in 1943. Junior Miss Junior Miss was published by Doubleday in 1941. This collection of her stories from The New Yorker was adapted by Jerome Chodorov and Joseph Fields into a successful play that same year.\\"New Play in Manhattan\\", Time, December 1, 1941. Directed by Moss Hart, Junior Miss ran on Broadway from 1941 to 1943. In 1945, the play was adapted as the film Junior Miss with George Seaton directing Peggy Ann Garner in the lead role. The Junior Miss radio series, starring Barbara Whiting, was broadcast weekly on CBS in 1949. Meet Me in St. Louis MGM's Meet Me in St. Louis (1944) was one of the more popular movies made during World War II. The stories in Sally Benson's book Meet Me in St. Louis were first written as short vignettes in a series titled 5135 Kensington, which The New Yorker published from June 14, 1941 to May 23, 1942. Benson took her original eight vignettes and added four more stories for a book compilation with each chapter representing a month of a year (from 1903 to 1904). When the book was published by Random House as Meet Me in St. Louis in 1942, it was titled after the MGM film, then in the very early stages of scripting. At MGM, Benson wrote an early draft of the screenplay, but it was not used. Screenplays Her other screen work includes Shadow of a Doubt (1943) for Alfred Hitchcock, Come to the Stable (1949), Summer Magic (1963), Viva Las Vegas (1964) and The Singing Nun (1966). Her screenplay for Anna and the King of Siam (1946) was nominated for an Academy Award. Her work for television includes episodes of Bus Stop (1961).

Solomon was survived by one daughter.  Anecdotes  In his later years, Solomon consulted at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory near Pasadena, California. He was very interested in opera and in theater, and he even wanted to get minor acting parts himself, perhaps in television commercials. Between his assignments in the Communications Research Section at JPL, he taught foreign- born engineers and scientists English by exposing them to music from American musical productions. He believed in enhancing health and the feelings of well- being through breathing exercises, and he was a practitioner of the Feldenkrais method. Solomon used the mind-body connection philosophy of the Feldenkrais method to teach voice lessons. He had a strong love for music, and was a composer as well.

It reports to the Home Affairs Bureau, headed by the Secretary for Home Affairs. Purpose The Department is responsible for the District Administration Scheme, community building and community involvement activities, minor environmental improvement projects and minor local public works, and the licensing of hotels and guesthouses, bedspace apartments and clubs. It promotes the concept of effective building management and works closely with other government departments to consistently improve the standard of building management in Hong Kong. It monitors the provision of new arrival services and identifies measures to meet the needs of new arrivals. It also disseminates information relating to and, where necessary, promotes the public's understanding of major government policies, strategies and development plans; and collects and assesses public opinion on relevant issues affecting the community. These responsibilities are discharged primarily through the 18 district offices covering the whole of Hong Kong.  History  An office in Stanley For a long time the department was the only channel of communication between the people and the government. It used to be headed by the Registrar General, who was also called the 'Protector of the Chinese'. Fung-Chi Au (; 1847-1914), who was the teacher of Chinese literature for Sun Yat-sen, was the Secretary of the Department of Chinese Affairs ().Rebecca Chan Chung, Deborah Chung and Cecilia Ng Wong, \\"Piloted to Serve\\", 2012 In 1913 the department was called the Secretariat for Chinese Affairs. After the 1967 riots, the colonial government introduced the City District Officer Scheme (Ê∞ëÊîø‰∏ª‰ªª) \\"as the first sign of reaching out to the ordinary people\\" in Hong Kong society. It was renamed the Home Affairs Department in 1971 because,according to the government, the department dealt not only with matters relating to the Chinese. The first Secretary for Home Affairs was Donald Luddington. Area committees Area committees were formed in districts in 1972 primarily to promote public participation in the Keep Hong Kong Clean Campaign and Fight Violent Crime Campaign. Nowadays, the functions of area committees are to encourage public participation in district affairs, to advise and assist in the organisation of community involvement activities and the implementation of government- sponsored initiatives, and advise on issues of a localised nature affecting the area. Throughout the years, area committees have played an important role in the districts and in providing a link between the local community and the district office. Area committee members are appointed by the Director of Home Affairs and are drawn from a wide spectrum of the community including district council members of the area concerned. At present, there are 70 area committees throughout Hong Kong. In general, each area committee serves an area with a population, including residents and mobile population (workers, shoppers, tourists etc.), of about 80,000 to 100,000. Mutual Aid Committees A mutual aid committee is a voluntary body formed by the residents of a building. Mutual aid committees were promoted initially in private multi-storey buildings, and quickly extended to public housing estates, industrial buildings, temporary housing and squatter areas. As at March 31, 2004, there were 3,103 mutual aid committees throughout Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and the New Territories. The primary aims of a mutual aid committee are to promote a sense of friendliness, mutual help and responsibility among members, and to promote better security, a better environment and, generally, more effective management within the building. These committees provide a channel of two-way communication between the Government and the residents on matters affecting the well-being of the individual and the community and also provide opportunities for residents to participate in community activities. Owners' Corporation An Owners' Corporation is a legal entity formed under the Building Management Ordinance by the owners of a private building. Owners' corporations are statutory bodies vested with certain legal powers to facilitate the management of a building. At the end of March 2004, there were 7,294 owners' corporations throughout Hong Kong, among which 5,537 were formed with the assistance of the district offices.

Ayscoughfee Hall Gardens. Ayscoughfee Hall Gardens; the building at the head of the pool is Spalding War Memorial. Memorial stone Ayscoughfee Hall is a grade I listed building and modest associated parkland in central Spalding, Lincolnshire, England, and is a landmark on the fen tour.  History  The house, currently a museum, was built for a local wool merchant, traditionally supposed to be Richard Ailwyn (or Aldwyn) in the fifteenth century. A dendrological study of the roof timbers reveal that the house was built in one phase, with a completion date of the majority of the present building in 1451. Richard Ailwyn's son, Sir Nicholas Ailwyn, a member of the Mercers' Company, became Lord Mayor of London in 1499. The house is substantially unchanged from that period, and would be recognisable to a visitor from the fifteenth century. The Hall was reputed to have belonged to the Ayscough (Askew, Ainscough) family in the early part of the 16th century - Fee referring to the Knight's Fee or living from the property. Early records name the house as Ayscough Fee Hall. A grant of land at Spalding was made to Sir William Ayscough (1490‚Äì1541) by Henry VIII. E. H. Gooch writes about \\"Ayscoughfee Hall\\" in his book \\"The History of Spalding\\", 1940. In the seventeenth century, the Hall passed into the Johnson family. The most notable Johnson was the second Maurice Johnson, known as \\"the Antiquary\\" (1688‚Äì1755), who founded the Spalding Gentlemen's Society (the second oldest antiquarian society still in existence) in 1710.The oldest being the Oxford Ashmolean, Maurice Johnson was a good friend of the more famous local antiquarian William Stukeley.  Museum and civic amenity  When the last occupant left in 1896, the Hall and Gardens were bought on behalf of the people of Spalding as a memorial of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee, and was handed over to the town \\"free of debt\\" on 9 August 1902 in celebration of the coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra. Now a museum and civic amenity, the house was also used as a primary school for a number of years during the 20th century. Some of the features of the gardens were reputedly laid out by William Sands in the early eighteenth century, and are still visible. The gardens include many fine features, including tall yew hedges, an early ice-house, and a fine ornamental lake. At the end of which sits the Spalding War Memorial (opened in 1922) which was designed by Sir Edwin Landseer Lutyens and became Grade I listed in 2015. Other features include a bowling green, tennis courts, aviary and a caf√©. A rustic bandstand, built to commemorate the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, was built in 1937 but was destroyed by arsonists in the early 1970s. The Friends of Ayscoughfee still arrange summer concerts on the south lawn during the summer months. With Heritage Lottery Fund backing, and commitment from South Holland District Council, the Hall was closed in 2003 for a complete sympathetic restoration. The Hall was officially re-opened to the public as a museum and community facility on Friday 30 June 2006, by Dr Jonathan Clark, of the University of York.

She studied law until 1943 and held several legal functions, before she became a member of the Senate for the PvdA in 1969. In 1973 she became Minister of Health in the cabinet Den Uyl. A major issue was the legislation concerning drugs, which she achieved in 1976 together with Minister of Justice, Dries van Agt. The Netherlands has since then employed a distinction between hard and soft drugs. She also took the leading role in attempting to establish a legal basis for the fluoridation of drinking water. Though fluoridation to prevent tooth decay had been occurring in many areas across the Netherlands for years, the Supreme Court ruled in 1973 that it should be specifically provided for in the Water Supply law. Her bill to do so did not find support in the House of Representatives outside her own party, and was dropped. From 1978 until 1979 Vorrink was an alderman in the city of Amsterdam.

Commanding a highway to the Crimea, the monastery was intended to defend southern approaches to the Moscow Kremlin. History =Muscovite period= Our Lady of the Don, by Theophanes the Greek The monastery was built on the spot where Boris Godunov's mobile fortress and Sergii Radonezhsky's field church with Theophan the Greek's icon Our Lady of the Don had been located. Legend has it that Dmitry Donskoy had taken this icon with him to the Battle of Kulikovo in 1380. The Tatars left without a fight and were defeated during their retreat. Initially, the cloister was rather poor and numbered only a few monks. As of 1629, the Donskoy Monastery possessed 20 wastelands and 16 peasant households (20 peasants altogether). In 1612, it was taken for one day by the Polish-Lithuanian commander Jan Karol Chodkiewicz. In 1618, Russian Streltsy defeated the Ukrainian Cossacks of Petro Konashevych under the monastery walls. In the mid-17th century the monastery was attached to the Andreyevsky Monastery. In 1678, however, its independence was reinstated and the cloister received rich donations, including more than 1,400 peasant households. In 1683, the Donskoy Monastery was elevated to the archmandrite level and given 20 desyatinas of the nearby pasturelands. Vidogoshchsky, Zhizdrinsky, Sharovkin, and Zheleznoborovsky monasteries were attached to the Donskoy Monastery between 1683 and 1685. =Imperial period= Since 1711, the Great Cathedral's vault was used for burials of Georgian tsarevichs of the Bagrationi family and Mingrelian dukes of the Dadiani family. In 1724, the monks and the property of the Andreyevsky Monastery were transferred to the Donskoy Monastery. By 1739, it had already possessed 880 households with 6,716 peasants, 14 windmills, and a few fisheries. In 1747, the authorities wanted to transfer the Slavic Greek Latin Academy to the Donskoy Monastery, but the cloister confined itself to paying salaries to the academic staff from its own treasury. Archbishop Ambrosius was killed within the monastery walls during the Plague Riot in 1771. In 1812, the French army ransacked the Donskoy Monastery, the most valuable things having been moved to Vologda prior to that. There had been 48 monks and 2 novices in the monastery by 1917. =Soviet period and beyond= The Bagrationi burial vault contains the remains of Archil of Imereti and Vakhushti of Kartli After the October Revolution, the Donskoy Monastery was closed. In 1922-1925, Patriarch Tikhon was detained in this cloister after his arrest. He chose to remain in this monastery after his release. Saint Tikhon's relics were discovered following his canonization in 1989. They are exhibited for veneration in the Great Cathedral in summer and in the Old Cathedral in winter. In 1924, some of the facilities of the Donskoy Monastery were occupied by a penal colony for children. The Soviets moved the remnants of many demolished monasteries and cathedrals to the Donskoy Monastery, including the Cathedral of Christ the Savior, Church of Saint Nicholas the Wonderworker in Stolpy, Church of the Assumption on Pokrovka Street in Moscow, Sukharev Tower, and others. Architecture When the monastery was established, Boris Godunov personally laid the foundation stone of its cathedral, consecrated in 1593 to the holy image of Our Lady of the Don. This diminutive structure, quite typical for Godunov's reign, has a single dome crowning three tiers of zakomara. In the 1670s, they added two symmetrical annexes, and a refectory leading to a tented belltower. Its iconostasis, executed in 1662, formerly adorned one of Moscow churches demolished by the Communists. From 1930 to 1946, the cathedral was closed for services and housed a factory. The New (or the Great) Cathedral, also dedicated to the Virgin of the Don, was started in 1684 as a votive church of Tsarevna Sophia Alekseyevna. After she fell into disgrace, its construction was funded by private donations. The masons and artisans were invited from Ukraine, which explains some of the cathedral's unusual features. For the first time in Moscow, the five domes were arranged according to the four corners of the Earth (as was the Ukrainian custom). The Old Believers felt offended by this and called the cathedral \\"Antichrist's Altar\\". Eight tiers of its ornate baroque iconostasis were carved by Kremlin masters in 1688-1698\\\\. The iconostasis' central piece is a copy of the Virgin of the Don, as painted in the mid-16th century. The cathedral frescoes are the first in Moscow to be painted by a foreigner. They were executed by Antonio Claudio in 1782-1785\\\\.

Eight square and four circular towers with red-blood crowns were put up in 1686-1711\\\\. The Holy Gates of the monastery (1693) are topped with the Tikhvin church (1713-1714), noted for its wrought iron grille. A lofty belfry was erected over the western gates from 1730-1753 after designs sometimes attributed to Pietro Antonio Trezzini. Necropolis Old necropolis of the Donskoy Monastery. Several families of high aristocracy chose the Donskoy monastery as location of their burial vaults. The Alexander Svirsky Church, for instance, was constructed in 1796-1798 as a sepulchre of Princes Zubov. Princes Galitzine were buried in the Archangel Church (1714-1809), whereas the Church of St. John Chrysostom (1881-1891) marks the Pervushin family vault. The old necropolis in the south-eastern part of the monastery is remarkable for its ornate tombs, executed by some of the best Russian sculptors. They mark the graves of the poets Mikhail Kheraskov and Alexander Sumarokov, the philosophers Pyotr Chaadaev and Ivan Ilyin, the historians Mikhail Shcherbatov and Vasily Klyuchevsky, the critic Vladimir Odoyevsky, the architect Osip Bove, the painter Vasily Perov, the courtier Alexander Dmitriev-Mamonov, the notorious murderer Daria Saltykova, and the aviator Nikolay Zhukovsky. Tikhon of Moscow is interred underneath the old katholikon. Some of the tombs were transferred by Soviet authorities to the Shchusev Museum of Architecture, where no one can see them now. Since no Communists were buried in the old necropolis inside the monastery, the relatives of some notable Russian Whites decided to move their remains from foreign cemeteries to the Donskoy Monastery. Among the notable people reburied in this way are Ivan Shmelyov (2000), Vladimir Kappel (2007), Anton Denikin (2005), and Ivan Ilyin (2005). The dissident writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn also asked to be buried there, rather than at the Novodevichy Cemetery, with its Communist associations. A large new necropolis was inaugurated in 1910 just outside the monastery walls. It contains a common grave for the cremated ashes of executed political prisoners from Joseph Stalin's Great Purge. See New Donskoy Cemetery for details.

It is a conical-bore keyed instrument belonging to the bugle family and has a shape similar to the sudrophone's.  Name  The instrument's name comes from the Greek word ophis (·ΩÑœÜŒπœÇ) \\"serpent\\" + kleis (Œ∫ŒªŒµŒØœÇ) \\"keys\\", since it was conceived of as a serpent with keys. Like the serpent, some found it difficult to play, and early twentieth-century musicians felt it had a somewhat unpredictable sound.  History  The ophicleide was invented in 1817 and patented in 1821 by French instrument maker Jean Hilaire Ast√© (also known as Halary or Haleri) as an extension to the keyed bugle or Royal Kent bugle family. It was the structural cornerstone of the brass section of the Romantic orchestra, often replacing the serpent, a Renaissance instrument which was thought to be outdated. Its long tubing bends back on itself, and it is played with a cupped mouthpiece similar to modern trombone and euphonium mouthpieces. It originally had nine keys, later expanded to as many as twelve keys, covering the large tone holes. Examples exist in E‚ô≠, C, B‚ô≠, and A‚ô≠ (soprano), F and E‚ô≠ (alto or quinticlave), B‚ô≠ and C (bass), and F or E‚ô≠ (contrabass). The most common members are the bass ophicleides pitched in B or C. Soprano and contrabass instruments are very rare. Adolphe Sax and the modern maker Robb Stewart have built examples of soprano ophicleides an octave above the bass. Currently, only five contrabass ophicleides are known to exist. Three are in museums, and two are privately owned: one in Cooperstown, New York and one in Petaluma, California. Those in private hands were both made by Robb Stewart and are the only playable examples. The bass ophicleide was first scored for in the opera Olimpie by Gaspare Spontini in 1819. Other famous works which employ it include Felix Mendelssohn's Elias and Overture to A Midsummer Night's Dream (originally scored for English Bass Horn), as well as Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique, which was originally scored to include both an ophicleide and a serpent. Today, it is replaced with two tubas in modern orchestral performances but the original effect is lost. The tubas are too loud for the intended sound. The instrument was standard in French mid-19th century serious operas by Meyerbeer, Halevy, and Auber, as well as English operas by Michael Balfe, Vincent Wallace, and others. Verdi, Saverio Mercadante and Wagner also composed for the ophicleide before switching to the bass tuba or contrabass trombone, as did Sir Arthur Sullivan in his Overture Di Ballo (which, like Wagner's Rienzi, also has an additional part for serpent). American composer William Perry (b. 1930) has written a Concerto for Ophicleide and Orchestra for the Australian virtuoso, Nick Byrne. Titled Brass From the Past, it was premiered in 2012 and later recorded by Naxos Records with Byrne as soloist. The ophicleide (oficleide) was used in Brazilian choro bands well into the 20th century‚Äîsoloist Irineu de Almeida was the major performer on the instrument‚Äîuntil it was superseded by the saxophone.  Use  The ophicleide was eventually succeeded by the tuba, although it remained popular in Italy until the early twentieth century. The euphonium can also be called a successor instrument. One of the last great ophicleide players was the English musician Sam Hughes. There have been claims that the instrument was a direct ancestor of the saxophone: supposedly Adolphe Sax, while repairing an ophicleide, put a woodwind mouthpiece on the instrument and liked the sound, allegedly leading Sax to design and create a purpose-built instrument. However, this story is not considered plausible, since the developmental history of the saxophone is well documented and the ophicleide and saxophone are only superficially similar to each other in that both have a wide conical bore and large tone holes. A very loud bass reed organ stop is named after the ophicleide.  Playing  The ophicleide, like the keyed bugle (the soprano member of its 'family'), has a fingering system like no other wind instrument. All keys except one are normally closed, opening only when a finger presses the associated key lever. Just below the bell is the largest of the key-covered tone holes, which is normally open, closing only when the lever is pressed. This normally open tone hole is the acoustic bell, with the bell itself having little effect on sound or pitch. The sound produced with no key levers pressed is the nominal pitch of the instrument. If the player presses the lever for this normally open tone hole, that hole is closed and the now-longer air column extends past this hole up to the bell, lowering the pitch by one half step. In general, the player can obtain all the \\"partial\\" pitches available for a given air column length. To play a higher series of partials, he opens one of the normally closed tone holes, effectively making that hole the \\"bell\\" of the instrument, with a corresponding shorter air column and higher series of pitches. The left hand controls three such tone holes plus the normally open one below the bell. Pitches in the upper and middle range of the instrument can be obtained by using only the left hand's set of tone holes, and the right hand can hold and stabilize the instrument. At the point where the air column is shortened by opening all of the left hand tone holes, there comes a difficult couple of notes that can best be played by continuing to shorten the air column with two fingers of the right hand, before the series of partials \\"wraps\\" and the left hand is used again for another set of notes. In the lowest octave, some pitches cannot be obtained very well using the holes closer to the bell. For these notes, the other fingers of the right hand can open a few more tone holes that are relatively closer to the mouthpiece than to the bell. Some instruments were made with between one and three extra right hand keys to provide better intonation for specific notes in this register. The right hand keys may also be used in the upper registers as alternate fingerings to facilitate faster passages or to improve intonation. With the exception of these special few pitches in the low octave, the combinations of partials on various sets of opened tone holes results in the left hand fingers going through something very similar to what they would be doing to manipulate the valves on a modern brass instrument.

By redirecting blood flow from poorly-ventilated lung regions to well-ventilated lung regions, HPV is thought to be the primary mechanism underlying ventilation/perfusion matching. The process might initially seem counterintuitive, as low oxygen levels might theoretically stimulate increased blood flow to the lungs to increase gas exchange. However, the purpose of HPV is to distribute bloodflow regionally to increase the overall efficiency of gas exchange between air and blood. While the maintenance of ventilation/perfusion ratio during regional obstruction of airflow is beneficial, HPV can be detrimental during global alveolar hypoxia which occurs with exposure to high altitude, where HPV causes a significant increase in total pulmonary vascular resistance, and pulmonary arterial pressure, potentially leading to pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary edema. Several factors inhibit HPV including increased cardiac output, hypocapnia, hypothermia, acidosis/alkalosis, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, inhaled anesthetics, calcium channel blockers, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), high-frequency ventilation (HFV), isoproterenol, nitric oxide, and vasodilators. Molecular mechanism The classical explanation of HPV involves inhibition of hypoxia-sensitive voltage-gated potassium channels in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells leading to depolarization. This depolarization activates voltage-dependent calcium channels, which increases intracellular calcium and activates smooth muscle contractile machinery which in turn causes vasoconstriction. However, later studies have reported additional ion channels and mechanisms that contribute to HPV, such as transient receptor potential canonical 6 (TRPC6) channels, and transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channels. Recently it was proposed that hypoxia is sensed at the alveolar/capillary level, generating an electrical signal that is transduced to pulmonary arterioles through gap junctions in the pulmonary endothelium to cause HPV. This contrasts with the classical explanation of HPV which presumes that hypoxia is sensed at the pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell itself. High altitude pulmonary edema High- altitude mountaineering can induce pulmonary hypoxia due to decreased atmospheric pressure. This hypoxia causes vasoconstriction that ultimately leads to high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). For this reason, some climbers carry supplemental oxygen to prevent hypoxia, edema, and HAPE. The standard drug treatment of dexamethasone does not alter the hypoxia or the consequent vasoconstriction, but stimulates fluid reabsorption in the lungs to reverse the edema. Additionally, several studies on native populations remaining at high altitudes have demonstrated to varying degrees the blunting of the HPV response.

It took place in 1856 and 1857 and was under the direction of President of the Church Brigham Young. During the Reformation, Young sent his counselor Jedediah M. Grant and other church leaders to preach to the people throughout Utah Territory and surrounding Mormon communities with the goal of inspiring them to reject sin and turn towards spiritual things. The most conservative, and even reactionary, elements of LDS Church doctrine dominated the public discussions during the Reformation. As a result of the Reformation, almost all \\"active\\" or involved LDS Church members were rebaptized as a symbol of their commitment.  History  All pioneers who gathered to Utah Territory under the direction of Young, whether members of the LDS Church or sympathetic non-members, were welcome as long as they helped in efforts to build up Zion. The undeveloped area required labor for the cutting of timber, road development, the creation of farms and pastures for cattle and other livestock; and the construction of homes, meetinghouses, mills, businesses, and irrigation systems. Church members who were willing to physically strengthen the Mormon settlements were so valued that \\"problems they might have with smoking, drinking, profaning, Sabbath breaking, and even immoral living did not normally cost them their standing in the community and the Church.\\" Consequently, by the early 1850s, communities within the Mormon settlement region were prospering and secure but contained a segment whose personal practices were not within the exacting standards of the LDS Church. In 1852, Young felt the church in Utah was secure enough to announce the practice of plural marriage to the world. Shortly after the announcement, however, the Latter-day Saints in Utah experienced a period of trial. The population of the new territory was increasing at a rapid rate as Mormon converts from Europe joined the American Saints in their migration across the Great Plains. In 1855, a drought struck the flourishing but still largely undeveloped territory. Very little rain fell, and even the normally dependable mountain streams ran very low. In addition to the damage caused by drought, an infestation of grasshoppers and crickets destroyed whatever crops the Mormons had managed to salvage. During the winter of 1855‚Äì56, flour and other basic necessities were suddenly very scarce and very costly. Heber C. Kimball wrote his son, \\"Dollars and cents do not count now, in these times, for they are the tightest that I have ever seen in the territory of Utah.\\" In September 1856, as the drought continued, the trials and difficulties of the previous year led to an explosion of intense soul-searching. Jedediah M. Grant, a counselor in the First Presidency and a well-known conservative voice in the extended community, preached three days of fiery sermons to the people in the area of modern Kaysville, Utah. He called for repentance and a general recommitment to moral living and religious teachings. Five hundred people presented themselves for rebaptism as a symbol of their determination to reform their lives. The zealous message spread from Kaysville to surrounding Mormon communities. Church leaders traveled around the territory, expressing their concern about signs of spiritual decay and calling for repentance. Members were asked to seal their rededication with rebaptism. The reformation was promoted intensely by all three members of the First Presidency, as well as several apostles, who gave fiery sermons in favor of greater orthodoxy, and rebaptism in preparation for the full practice of \\"celestial law\\" in Utah Territory prior to the Second Coming, which they suspected would be soon. According to Young: \\"The time is coming when justice will be laid to the line and righteousness to the plummet; when we shall take the old broadsword and ask, Are you for God? And if you are not heartily on the Lord's side, you will be hewn down.\\" Throughout the winter special meetings were held, and Mormons urged to adhere to the commandments of God and the practices and precepts of the church. Preaching placed emphasis on the practice of plural marriage, adherence to the Word of Wisdom, attendance at church meetings, and personal prayer. Several sermons also focused on improving personal appearance, dress and hygiene. Although Grant died shortly after one of his winter tours, a victim of pneumonia, the influence of the reformation spread throughout the Mormon colonies. On December 30, 1856, the entire all-Mormon Utah territorial legislature was rebaptized for the remission of their sins, and reconfirmed under the hands of the Twelve Apostles. To encourage reformation, certain adjunct theocratic committees may have attempted to ensure order and conformity by censuring local troublemakers. Dissident Mormons of the time reported rumors that committees resorted to summary judgments with punishments meted out by enforcers colloquially termed \\"Danites\\" or \\"destroying angels.\\" For example, the southern Utah pioneer and militia scout of the time John Chatterley later wrote that he had received threats from \\"secret Committee, called... 'destroying angels'\\" in late 1856 and early 1857.. Commentators have pointed to pronouncements during the period by Young and Grant that would seem to give vigilante-style bloodshed a religious basis. Young denied that any such acts were condoned by him or the church leadership. In a speech in 1867 Young said: > Is there war in our religion? No; neither war nor bloodshed. Yet our enemies > cry out \\"bloodshed,\\" and \\"oh, what dreadful men these Mormons are, and those > Danites! how they slay and kill!\\" Such is all nonsense and folly in the > extreme. The wicked slay the wicked, and they will lay it on the Saints.. Historian Dean L. May noted that the more zealous reformation efforts were not universally accepted in Utah: in a possible tongue-in-cheek diary entry, Hannah Tapfield King responded to Grant's accusation that the Polysophical Society (a literary club organized by the more socially-liberal Lorenzo Snow and his sister Eliza R. Snow), had an \\"adulterous spirit.\\" King wrote, \\"Well, there may be, for he says there is, and probably he understands it. To me it all seemed good and nice, of course a little vanity and folly, and that one sees in the tabernacle and everywhere.\\"May, Dean L. Utah: A People's History. Bonneville Books, Salt Lake City, Utah, 1987. . As in similar Protestant Reformation movements, the enormous enthusiasm and dramatic signs of repentance could not be sustained. By the spring of 1857, with the return of more familiar spring rains, the religious life of Mormon communities returned to a more normal pattern. The Reformation appears to have burned out completely by early 1858.  Blood atonement  Several sermons by Willard Richards and George A. Smith that had been delivered earlier in the history of the LDS Church had touched on the concept of blood atonement, suggesting that apostates and those who committed certain other denounced sins, such as murder, were beyond the saving power of the blood of Christ and could be redeemed only by the voluntary shedding of their own blood. On September 21, 1856, while calling for sincere repentance by church members, Young took the idea further, and stated: \\"I know that there are transgressors, who, if they knew themselves and the only condition upon which they can obtain forgiveness, would beg of their brethren to shed their blood, that the smoke might ascend to God as an offering to appease the wrath that is kindled against them, and that the law might have its course.\\"Journal of Discourses 4:53‚Äì54. Young reiterated the concept in several other sermons during the Reformation period. Although the belief was never widely accepted by church members, it became part of the public image of the church at the time and was pilloried in eastern newspapers along with the practice of polygamy. During the subsequent history of the church, the concept was frequently criticized by church members and was formally repudiated as church doctrine in 1889 and again in 1978.  Impact  In addition to the Reformation's appeal to the spiritual and emotional lives of Latter-day Saints, actions taken during the movement had lasting impacts on church members, their families, and the church organization. According to historian Paul H. Peterson, the pledges of conformity with church practices led to a measurable increase in plural marriages throughout the Mormon region. Many men who had previously resisted plural marriages were sealed to one or more plural wives. Stanley S. Ivins's statistical research reveals that the number of plural marriages in relation to population was 65 percent higher in 1856‚Äì57 than in any other two-year period in Utah history.Ivins, Stanley S., \\"Notes on Mormon Polygamy,\\" Western Hunanities Review, vol. 10, 1956, p. 231. A second impact of the Reformation was an increase in practical and emotional unity among the church membership. Historians James Allen and Glen Leonard point out that the Reformation \\"may have accounted for the fact that the following year the Saints were emotionally prepared to confront the army of the United States en route to Utah.\\"Allen, James B. and Leonard, Glen M. (1976, 1992) The Story of the Latter-day Saints; Deseret Book; During the conflict, known as the Utah War, Mormon militia were asked to engage in diversionary action on the plains and in Wyoming. Also, church members were prepared, under Young's direction, to abandon and destroy their homes, farms, and businesses and move again to the White Mountains of Arizona, which Young had selected as a possible place of refuge if full-scale war began. Historians have also asserted that the emotional rhetoric contributed to the defensive dialogue and actions in Southern Utah, which ultimately burst forth in the Mountain Meadows massacre. Also, leaders at church headquarters then established a policy of assigning two \\"home\\" or ward missionaries in each congregational unit. They were asked to visit each family in the ward, assess their material needs and provide help where possible. They were also asked to inquire into family members' spiritual commitment, including asking searching questions about religious practices. After some months of these missionary visits, Latter-day Saints in Salt Lake City and surrounding communities who had not yet been rebaptized were asked to do so as an expression of their ongoing commitment to the church. Paul H. Peterson asserts that those who refused to be rebaptized might \\"lose their membership in the Church. In Britain, zealous application of Reformation principles resulted in trimming from Church rolls a large number of the less- committed.\\"Peterson, Paul H. \\"The Mormon Reformation of 1856‚Äì1857: The Rhetoric and the Reality.\\" 15 Journal of Mormon History 59‚Äì87 (1989).

He was arrested after an eight-day nationwide manhunt involving more than 500 police officers and 12 police forces, during which time he was Britain's \\"most wanted man\\". Police discovered notes written by Hobson that showed the murders were pre- meditated and well-planned, including a 'to-do' note detailing how he planned to lure his girlfriend's twin sister to his flat and a shopping list for \\"big bin liners,\\" tape, tie-wraps, fly spray and air freshener. Against his girlfriend's sister's name he had written \\"use and abuse at will.\\" The list of planned victims also included his girlfriend's parents and the parents of his ex-wife. Hobson was tried for the murders in April 2005. Pleading guilty, he was sentenced to four terms of life imprisonment with a recommendation that he should never be released. This was one of the first times that such a recommendation had been made for someone who had admitted their crime at the first opportunity. He is currently imprisoned at HMP Wakefield, West Yorkshire. Early life Hobson was born at Manygates Maternity Hospital in Wakefield on 2 September 1969. The first family home was in Norton Street, Wakefield, where Hobson grew up with his parents Peter and Sandra and his two sisters, Melanie and Leslie. They then moved to Woodhouse Road, Eastmoor. His father was a coal miner who had started his career at Walton colliery in 1958 and later become deputy and over-manager at the city's Park Hill colliery until its closure in 1982. The family then moved to the Selby area where Peter Hobson took work at a local coalfield. Hobson's mother worked as a machinist. Hobson's childhood was described by his contemporaries as \\"happy and stable.\\" He attended Heath View Primary School in Eastmoor, Wakefield, Staynor High School and Brayton High School, Selby. One of Hobson's teachers recalled him as \\"very well behaved... so average and ordinary that he was almost anonymous.\\" Later life In 1991 Hobson moved in with his childhood sweetheart and her two children from another relationship. They married in 1993, after the birth of their daughter. Hobson worked at Drax power station and as a landscape gardener. His wife described him as the \\"perfect husband.\\" In 1998 Hobson registered as a nightclub doorman and began working at \\"Kans\\" nightclub in Market Place, Selby. On New Year's Day 1999, he walked out on his family without giving a reason and began using cannabis and drinking heavily. His wife said: \\"There was no one else involved, he just didn't want married life any more. It was bizarre. I couldn't believe it. He turned to pot and drinking heavily. He never drank when we were married but now he got out of his face. He became like a zombie... His life just went completely off the rails.\\" Murders =Claire Sanderson= During the evening of 10 July 2004, he killed his girlfriend Claire Sanderson, 27, in the flat they shared on Millfield Drive, Camblesforth. She was struck on the head seventeen times with a hammer and strangled, after which Hobson wrapped her body in binbags. A plastic bag had also been placed over her head. Subsequent forensic analysis determined that an area of the flat had been cleaned with bleach but Claire had been first attacked in the living room and then taken into the bathroom. There was no evidence of recent sexual activity. =Diane Sanderson= On 17 July, he telephoned Sanderson's twin sister Diane and told her Claire was ill with glandular fever and wanted her to visit. When Diane arrived at the flat that evening she too was beaten with a hammer after being tortured with a disposable razor and scissors and sexually assaulted. She had been \\"hogtied\\" and her left nipple was completely bitten off. Police believe Hobson may have eaten it. The cause of her death was determined to be strangulation. Her head was also covered with a plastic bag and ligatures were found on her wrists, ankles and neck. Her pubic hair had been shaved and she had been sexually assaulted. =James and Joan Britton= The next day, he murdered an elderly couple, James and Joan Britton, at their home in Strensall, York.

Hobson had admitted grievous bodily harm and avoided a prison sentence, instead receiving a community punishment order. This lenient sentence came under much criticism in the light of Hobson's later offending. Appeal Hobson lodged an appeal to have a lower minimum sentence set, claiming that he should have been given a more lenient sentence because he had admitted all four murders at the earliest opportunity. He also claimed that no other murderer who admitted their crimes at the first opportunity had ever been recommended for lifelong imprisonment. This was not true, as a similar recommendation had been imposed on child killers Timothy Morss and Brett Tyler in 1996 even though they had admitted their crimes at the earliest opportunity.Silence as the terrible truth is revealed Telegraph, 18 August 2002 The appeal was turned down by the Court of Appeal when Lord Phillips agreed with the trial judge's recommendation, saying that in his opinion, Hobson should never be released, regardless of a guilty plea, since the murders had been so horrific.Killer Hobson loses tariff appeal BBC News, 30 November 2005 Imprisonment Shortly before this court case, Hobson was placed into solitary confinement for three months after attacking Ian Huntley (a former school caretaker convicted of murdering two girls at a Cambridgeshire school), and scalding him with a bucket of boiling water.

It is a non-fiction account of his experiences in Africa and was first published in 1972. It proved so successful that a revised edition came out in 1988, and then again in 2004. The title refers to the marauding elephants destroying peasant crops, driven by heavy poaching pressure in wilderness areas, which formed the most urgent task for Kinloch. That his book is still in demand is a source of pride to him and his wife, Elizabeth, who accompanied him frequently and typed up the notes of his original book. \\"It is a book that never dies, its contents are as relevant now as ever,\\" she said. The Shamba Raiders is an account of the struggle to preserve herds of game threatened by modern civilisation, poaching, war and the political and economic changes which have swept Africa in the middle of the last century. As the Chief Game Warden in Uganda, Tanzania and Malawi, Kinloch walked the tight rope of retaining Africa's wildlife heritage while safeguarding crops and livelihood of the population, featuring ivory poachers and middlemen as well as uncaring and bigoted officials. In particular, the book describes Kinloch's management of the Uganda Game and Fisheries Department during the introduction of the Protectorate's first National Parks, the introduction of Nile Perch to the upper Victoria Nile, and the creation of the College of African Wildlife Management.

The air force of Greece, the Hellenic Air Force, participated in the Balkan Wars, World War I, the Asia Minor War, World War II, the Greek Civil War and the Korean War.  Establishment and first actions in the Balkan Wars In 1911 the Greek Government appointed French specialists to form the Hellenic Aviation Service. Six Greek officers were sent to France for training, while the first four \\"Farman\\" type aircraft were ordered. The first Greek aviator was Emmanuel Argyropoulos, who flew in a Nieuport IV.G \\"Alcuin\\" fighter, on February 8, 1912. The first military flight was made on 13 May of that year by Lieutenant Dimitrios Kamberos. In June, Kamberos flew with the \\"Daedalus\\", a Farman Aviation Works aircraft that had been converted into a seaplane, setting the foundations of the Naval Aviation. That September, the Greek Army fielded its first squadron, the Aviators Company (ŒõœåœáŒøœÇ ŒëŒµœÅŒøœÄœåœÅœâŒΩ).  Inter-war years  Until 1930, Greek Aviation was split in the separate Army Aviation and Naval Aviation services, but in that year, the Aviation Ministry was founded with Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos as its first minister, establishing the Air Force as the third branch of the Hellenic Armed Forces. In 1931, the Air Force Academy, the Scholi Ikaron, was founded.  World War II and Civil War  A PZL P.24, the main Greek fighter in the Greco- Italian War During the Greco-Italian War, despite its small size and obsolete equipment, the Hellenic Air Force gave good account of itself against the Italians, but after 65 days of war, the RHAF had lost 31 officers killed and seven wounded, plus four NCOs killed and five wounded. Meanwhile, the number of combat aircraft had dropped to 28 fighters and seven battleworthy bombers. The rest of the air force was destroyed, mostly by the Germans, in April 1941. The Air Force was rebuilt in the Middle East as part of the Royal Air Force, flying Spitfires, Hurricanes and Martin Baltimores. After Greece's liberation in 1944, it returned home and subsequently participated in the Greek Civil War.  Civil war In 1946 Greek manned RAF squadrons were converted into the Royal Hellenic Air Force, that operated a variety of plane types, mainly British. The same year Civil War started During the first two years the government used the Air Force for reconnaissance and air supply missions to isolated areas. With artillery in short supply the Air Force was also used as \\"flying artillery\\" but the pilots had difficulty locating an enemy hidden and moving only by night. The equipment was not suited for counter-insurgency operations and cooperation with the Army was faulty. In 1948 the RHAF was upgraded with US assistance. At the same time the communists decided to abandon guerilla tactics and try to hold ground like regular army. The introduction of the Curtiss Helldiver dive-bomber and the napalm bombs allowed to attack the communist troops and made possible victory in 1949.https://stefanosskarmintzos.wordpress.com/2015/05/04/short-history-of- the-hellenic-air-force-1912-to-1962/  Post-war developments  In the 1950s, the force was rebuilt and organized according to NATO standards. The Hellenic Air Force participated in the Korean War with a transport flight unit. Greece participated in NATO nuclear weapons sharing until 2001, using A-7 Corsair IIs to deploy U.S. tactical B61 nuclear bombs from Araxos Air Base. Until the late 1980s the Air Force deployed Nike-Hercules Missiles armed with U.S. nuclear warheads. As a result of Greco-Turkish tensions around the 1974 Turkish invasion in Cyprus, the U.S. removed its nuclear weapons from Greek and Turkish alert units to storage. Greece saw this as another pro-Turkish move by NATO and withdrew its forces from NATO's military command structure from 1974 to 1980. In 1988 the first 3rd generation fighters were introduced, marking the beginning of a new era: The first Mirage 2000 EG/BG aircraft were delivered to the 114th Combat Wing and equipped the 331 and 332 squadrons. In January 1989, the first F-16 C/D Block 30 arrived in Nea Anchialos (111th Combat Wing) and were allocated between the 330 and 346 squadrons. On March 29, 1991 the RF-84F were retired from service after 34 years and 7 months of operational life. In November 1992 more RF-4E were delivered to the 348 Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron. In 1997 the reception of third generation aircraft continued. In July, delivery of forty F-16 Block 50 begun. The new aircraft, equipped with the LANTIRN navigation and targeting pod as well as AIM-120 AMRAAM and AGM-88 HARM missiles, were allocated to the 341 and 347 squadrons. In 2005, Greece was among the first countries to add the F-16 Block 52+ to its inventory. Sixty of these aircraft were acquired and another thirty are currently in order. This advanced F-16 type is an improved version of the Block 50 featuring a more powerful radar, better communications systems and an upgraded engine. Since the 1970s issues arose between Greece and Turkey over sovereignty rights in the Aegean Sea. The conflict over military flight activities has led to a practice of continuous tactical military provocations. Turkish aircraft regularly fly in the zones over which Greece claims control and Greek aircraft intercept, as a consequence they frequently engage in simulated dogfights, testing each other's will and capabilities. Mock dogfights are so usual now that are listed in the 'Daily Activities' section of the official website of Turkey's chief of general staff. Confrontations between Turkish and Greek military warplanes decreased for several years but escalated sharply in 2014 http://www.businessinsider.com/turkey-and-greece- had-large-number-of-dogfights-2015-1 Sometimes these dogfights cause casualties and losses for both the Greek and Turkish Air Forces: * On 18 June 1992, a Greek Mirage F1CG crashed during a low-altitude dogfight with two Turkish F-16's. * On 8 October 1996, a pair of Greek Mirage 2000s intercepted a pair of Turkish F-16s. One of the Turkish F-16s was shot down by a Greek Mirage 2000. * On 23 May 2006, a Greek F-16 and a Turkish F-16 collided near the island of Karpathos during a Turkish reconnaissance flight. Following the accident Turkish Chief of General Staff visited Athens to prevent further tension. * On 12 April 2018, a Greek Mirage 2000 crashed into the Aegean near Skyros following an interception sortie prompted by possible Turkish Air Force activity over that sea. The pilot, 34-year-old Georgios Baltadoros, died as a result. No visual identification of a target or use of munitions was reported.https://thedefensepost.com/2018/04/12/greek-military-jet-crashes- aegean-pilot-missing/ References  External links  *History of the Hellenic Air Force - Official HAF site *Hellenic Aviation History *The Royal Hellenic Air Force 1940-41 *The Greek PZLs *Greeks in Spitfires *Greek Bloch MB.151 C1 fighters *Greek PZL P.24 fighters ","title":"History of the Hellenic Air Force"},{"id":"2151302","text":"Pulborough is a large village and civil parish in the Horsham district of West Sussex, England, with some 5,000 inhabitants. It is located almost centrally within West Sussex and is south west of London. It is at the junction of the north-south A29 and the east-west (A283) roads. The village is near the confluence of the River Arun and the River Rother, on the Stane Street Roman road from London to Chichester. It looks southwards over the broad flood plain of the tidal Arun to a backdrop of the South Downs. It is on the northern boundary of the newly-established South Downs National Park. The parish covers an area of 5,183 acres (2,098 hectares). The twelfth-century parish church is dedicated to St Mary. In the 2001 census there were 4,685 people living in 1,976 households of whom 2,333 were economically active. At the 2011 Census the population of Bignor was included and the total population was 5,206. History left Historically, it was a fording place over the River Arun used by the Romans, who had a mansio across the river at Hardham, one day's march from Chichester on the London road. The Saxons bridged the River Arun here and at nearby Stopham, north of its confluence with the River Rother. It became an important watering and overnight halt for cattle drovers providing easy access to water. A mile to the west in woodland are the earthwork remains of a motte and bailey castle known as Park Mound, dating from the 11th century. Transport connections afforded by the River Arun, its navigation, and later by the LBSCR Arun Valley Line brought Pulborough into the industrial age. Good road connections permitted, in the 20th century, the development of manufacturing industry, notably heavy engineering in London Road. This has long since closed down and the site now supports, among other things, a supermarket and a health centre. The village is served by Pulborough railway station. Attractions Each year, Pulborough hosts the 12-hour lawn mower race which runs continuously for 12 hours.Pulborough mower race a cut above the rest, Richard Gurner, The Argus, 28 July 2008 On the fourth Saturday of September Pulborough hosts a traditional Harvest Fair complete with old time fair ground, welly wanging and a scarecrow competition, and in June the Pulborough duck race society holds its annual duck race, a charity event. Pulborough is also home to the South Downs Light Railway with its steam and diesel trains running regularly throughout the summer, and a more limited service through the colder months. Pulborough has an angling club, which has a number of initiatives to support local youngsters, including angling training as well as offering talks to local clubs, youth and conservation groups on the merits of angling and what anglers do to support, maintain and improve the habitat in conjunction with government departments and other groups. Local cricket Earliest records suggest cricket has been played in Pulborough since 1799. Now based at the Recreation Ground, Pulborough Cricket Club boasts numerous Senior and Junior (Colts) teams. Previously a member club of the Sussex Invitation League, Pulborough's 1st and 2nd Elevens were invited to join the Sussex Cricket League (\\"the county league\\") from the 2004 season. A 3rd League XI plays in the West Sussex League, home matches being played nearby at Watersfield. Pulborough was a founder member of the North West Sussex Colts Cricket League (now known as the iDentilam League) in 1987, when it became apparent that schools were not providing adequate cricketing opportunities to local youth. Various age-groups (Under 9s, 10s, 12s, 14s and 16s) now provide ample opportunity to develop cricket skills, played in a competitive environment and ultimately secure the long-term future of the club. The club also provides a mechanism for younger players to progress into senior cricket, with two non-league senior teams playing matches on Sunday afternoons. In 2006, the Sussex Cricket Board recognised the club's efforts towards youth sport, and awarded it ECB 'Focus Club' status. In 2008, the Club launches a junior girls team, thereby continuing the club's ongoing progressive and ambitious plans. Other notable events On 17 July 2000, Pulborough made the headlines when the body of missing girl Sarah Payne was found in a field off the A29 near the village. She had been reported missing some away near Littlehampton 16 days earlier. Roy Whiting, a 42-year-old convicted paedophile, was found guilty of her murder on 12 December 2001 and sentenced to life imprisonment.BBC News Retrieved 2009-11-04 On 19 April 2003, the body of 31-year-old Brighton music teacher Jane Longhurst, who had been strangled some weeks earlier, was found at Wiggonholt Common.

It may be defined in an insurance policy and paid by an insured person each time a medical service is accessed. It is technically a form of coinsurance, but is defined differently in health insurance where a coinsurance is a percentage payment after the deductible up to a certain limit. It must be paid before any policy benefit is payable by an insurance company. Copayments do not usually contribute towards any policy out-of-pocket maxima whereas coinsurance payments do.University of Puget Sound. Benefits update. 2006 medical plan frequently asked questions. What is the difference between co-payments, coinsurance, and deductibles? Retrieved November 10, 2008. Insurance companies use copayments to share health care costs to prevent moral hazard. It may be a small portion of the actual cost of the medical service but is meant to deter people from seeking medical care that may not be necessary (e.g., an infection by the common cold). In health systems with prices below the market clearing level in which waiting lists act as rationing tools,Lindsay, Cotton M. and Bernard Feigenbaum (1984) 'Rationing by waiting lists', American Economic Review 74(3): 404-17. copayment can serve to reduce the welfare cost of waiting lists.Diego Varela and Anca Timofte (2011), 'The social cost of hospital waiting lists and the case for copayment: Evidence from Galicia' , The USV Annals of Economics and Public Administration 11(1): 18-26. However, a copay may also discourage people from seeking necessary medical care and higher copays may result in non-use of essential medical services and prescriptions, thus rendering someone who is insured effectively uninsured because they are unable to pay higher copays. Thus, there is a balance to be achieved: a high enough copay to deter unneeded expenses but low enough to not render the insurance useless. Germany The German healthcare system had introduced copayments in the late 1990s in an attempt to prevent overutilization and control costs. For example, Techniker Krankenkasse-insured members above 18 years pay the copayments costs for some medicines, therapeutic measures and appliances such as physiotherapy and hearing aids up to the limit of 2% of the family's annual gross income. For chronically ill patients, the co-payment limit is 1% including any dependant living in their home. The average length of hospital stay in Germany has decreased in recent years from 14 days to 9 days, still considerably longer than average stays in the U.S. (5 to 6 days). The difference is partly driven by the fact that hospital reimbursement is chiefly a function of the number of hospital days as opposed to procedures or the patient's diagnosis. Drug costs have increased substantially, rising nearly 60% from 1991 through 2005. Despite attempts to contain costs, overall health care expenditures rose to 10.7% of GDP in 2005, comparable to other western European nations, but substantially less than that spent in the U.S. (nearly 16% of GDP). However, after research studies by the Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit (Research Institute for the Future of Labor) showed the copayment system was ineffective in reducing doctor visits, it was voted out by the Bundestag in 2012. Prescription drugs Some insurance companies set the copay percentage for non-generic drugs higher than for generic drugs. Occasionally if a non-generic drug is reduced in price insurers will agree to classify it as generic for copayment purposes (as occurred with simvastatin). Pharmaceutical companies have a very long term (frequently 20 years or longer) lock on a drug as a brand name drug which for patent reasons cannot be produced as a generic drug. However, much of this time is exhausted during pre-clinical and clinical research. Schacht, Wendy H. and Thomas, John R. Patent Law and Its Application to the Pharmaceutical Industry: An Examination of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984(\\"The Hatch-Waxman Act\\") Retrieved December 1, 2014. To cushion the high copay costs of brand name drugs, some pharmaceutical companies offer drug coupons or temporary subsidized copayment reduction programs lasting from two months to twelve months. Thereafter, if a patient is still taking the brand name medication, the pharmaceutical companies might remove the option and require full payments. If no similar drug is available, the patient is \\"locked in\\" to either using the drug with the high copays, or a patient takes no drugs and lives with the consequences of non-treatment. =Observed effects= Medication copayments have also been associated with reduced use of necessary and appropriate medications for chronic conditions such as chronic heart failure,Cole JA, et al. Drug copayment and adherence in chronic heart failure: effect on cost and outcomes. Pharmacotherapy 2006;26:1157-64. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, breast cancer, and asthma.Dormuth CR, et al. Impact of two sequential drug cost-sharing policies on the use of inhaled medications in older patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma. Clin Ther 2006;28:964-78; discussion 962-3. In a 2007 meta-analysis, RAND researchers concluded that higher copayments were associated with lower rates of drug treatment, worse adherence among existing users, and more frequent discontinuation of therapy.Goldman DP, Joyce GF, Zheng Y.

He is a former governor of Chihuahua and former secretary in the cabinet of President Vicente Fox. Barrio was born in Satevo, Chihuahua, and received a bachelor's degree in accounting and an MBA from the Autonomous University of Chihuahua. He did some consulting and worked in the private sector before joining the local chapter of the National Action Party in 1983 and becoming its first member to ever win the mayorship of Ju√°rez, Chihuahua. He ran for governor in 1986 and lost against the PRI candidate, Fernando Baeza Mel√©ndez, in one of the most controversial elections in the state's recent history. Six years later he made another attempt and won, ending more than 60 years of uninterrupted control of Chihuahua's governorship by members of the Institutional Revolutionary Party. As a governor, he delivered mixed results and consequently the PRI regained control of the state at the end of his term. While governor of Chihuahua, hundreds of women were raped and murdered in Juarez. Barrio refused for years to mount an inquiry, and suggested the attacks were not surprising because the victims walked in dark places at night and wore provocative clothing.http://beta.mytelus.com/telusen/portal/NewsChannel.aspx?CatID=National&ArticleID;=news/capfeed/national/n022636A.xml In the course of his political career, Barrio-Terrazas has served as Mayor of Ciudad Ju√°rez and Governor of the State of Chihuahua, a post he held from 1992 to 1998. In the 80‚Äôs, he held leadership roles in his native state during the political-democratic transition process, and later served as one of the first governors to rise from the ranks of the opposition party. During his tenure as governor, the State of Chihuahua placed first in the country in anti- corruption and good governance, according to the annual review conducted by the prestigious Monterrey Technological Institute of Higher Studies (ITESM). Barrio headed the Federal Comptroller's Secretariat (2000‚Äì2003) and, in 2003, was elected to the Chamber of Deputies, where he became the leader of the National Action Party's parliamentary group. On February 24, 2005, he expressed interest in becoming the PAN presidential candidate and campaigned for a few months before quitting on July 7, arguing partisan favoritism towards the former minister of the interior, Santiago Creel. In January 2009 he was named as the Mexican ambassador to Canada. This was met with controversy and protests from rights organizations in Canada and Mexico, due to his actions during the Juarez murders.http://beta.mytelus.com/telusen/portal/NewsChannel.aspx?CatID=National&ArticleID;=news/capfeed/national/n022636A.xml  See also  *Creel-Terrazas Family External links * Francisco Barrio's Presidential Campaign. * Can Francisco Barrio Break the Culture of Corruption? article on Business Week.

Views Eschenmayer's views are largely identical with those of Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, but he differed from him in regard to the knowledge of the absolute. He believed that in order to complete the arc of truth, philosophy must be supplemented by what he called non- philosophy (), a kind of mystical illumination by which was obtained a belief in God that could not be reached by mere intellectual effort.H√∂ffding, H., Hist. of Mod. Phil., Eng. trans. vol. 2, 1900, p. 170. He carried this tendency to mysticism into his physical researches, and was led by it to take a deep interest in the phenomena of animal magnetism. He ultimately became a devout believer in demoniacal and spiritual possession; and his later writings are all strongly impregnated with supernaturalism.

Its primary attraction is as the home of what it says is the largest Wurlitzer theater organ in the world. Powered by three turbine blowers (with a fourth as a standby) it has more than 5,500 pipes. The original organ was built for the Denver Theater and was installed in 1927. It saw service there until the 1930s. Rebuilt in 1975, including pieces from other Wurlitzers, it eventually ended up as a 78 rank organ. It is a frequent recipient of Phoenix New Times annual \\"Best of Phoenix\\" awards. History The first Organ Stop Pizza location opened in 1972 at the corner of 7th St and Missouri Ave in Phoenix, Arizona. A second location opened in Mesa near Southern Ave and Dobson Rd in 1975. There was also a location in Tucson for a short time. In 1984, the original owners of the restaurant sold the Phoenix location to a local real estate developer who subsequently closed it. The original Mesa location was sold to an employee of the restaurant the same year. In 1995, the original Mesa location was closed and replaced by a new, larger facility near Southern Ave and Stapley Dr. References External links *Official website *Arizona Republic article *Index of Phoenix New Times articles Category:Companies based in Mesa, Arizona Category:Pizzerias in the United States Category:Restaurants established in 1972 Category:Public venues with a theatre organ Category:1972 establishments in Arizona ","title":"Organ Stop Pizza"},{"id":"2151330","text":"James Mason (1909‚Äì1984) was an English actor.

He was educated at the Dominican order gymnasium of his native town, and in 1790 entered, as a novice, the Benedictine abbey of Marienmunster, in the Bishopric of Paderborn. His Benedictine name was Leander. He was priest at Schwalenberg from 1799 to 1821 after which he became extraordinary professor of theology and joint- director of the teacher's seminary at Marburg. In 1818 he received the doctorate of theology and of canonical law. In 1807, in conjunction with his cousin Karl van Ess, he had published a German translation of the New Testament, and, as its circulation was discountenanced by his superiors, he published in 1808 a defence of his views, entitled Auszuge aus den heiligen V√§tern und anderen Lehrern der katholischen Kirche uber das nothwendige und nutzliche Bibellesen. An improved edition of this tractate was published in 1816, under the title Gedanken der Bibel und Bibellehre, and in the same year appeared Was war die Bibel den ersten Christen? In 1822 he published the first part of a German translation of the Old Testament, which was completed in 1836. In 1822 he resigned his offices at Marburg in order to devote his whole time to the defence of his views regarding Bible reading by the people, and to endeavour to promote the circulation of the scriptures. He was associated first with the Catholic Bible Society of Regensburg, and then with the British and Foreign Bible Society. He died at Affolterbach in the Odenwald.

In ancient times, a Patil was the head of a village working under a Deshmukh who was head of the district. Under Deccan sultanates, and the Maratha empire, the Patil was the village headman and the most important Vatandar of the village. His main duties were to be the collector of revenue, as well as being the head of police and justice. In Konkan, a Patil was called \\"Khot\\". Historian Ness writes that \\"what the Patil and Kulkarni were to a village, the Deshmukh or Deshpande were to the district, or Pargana\\". Patil settled villages and collected revenues from the villagers, thus a Patil family typically owned 30-40 percent of village land. Colonising multiple villages promoted a Patil to a Deshmukh. The Patil was entitled to several free services from village peasants and artisans. The Patil presided over all village festivals, such as Dasara, Diwali and Holi. Patil watan was dominated by the Maratha or Kunbi caste, but there were also some Brahmins and Muslims who held this office.Sen, S., 1925. Administrative system of the Marathas. University of Calcutta, Calcutta. page 216 This watan was either purchased or granted by the king. The ancestors of some of the important personalities of the Maratha empire held hereditary Patilki rights for villages in Maharashtra. Shivaji's family had Patilki rights in the present day Pune district. The ancestors of Shinde rulers of Gwalior held similar rights in the village of Kanherkhed in Satara district. Similarly Sardar Vithal Sadashiv Vinchurkar (Dani) held Patilki of Vinchur village in Chandwad pargana. The majority of Patils were illiterate, with exception of Deshastha Brahmin families such as the Vinchurkars (Dani), Purandares, Sambranis and Tulshibagwales. Hence the correspondence would be carried in the name of Patil and Kulkarni and they would jointly sign all government documents. The Patil would typically put his thumbprint or other marks on the document. The Kulkarni would sometimes take advantage of the illiteracy of the Patil and \\"use him as a tool\\". Shahu Maharaj of Kolhapur, a social reformer, decided to end the dependency of the Patil on the Kulkarni. On 15 May 1912, he started a school called the \\"Patil School\\" to train future Patils in their duties as village officers. This school was in operation for seven years. The Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics commented that in 1955, it was made mandatory for the Police Patil to be educated up to at least the 4th grade although he was not usually a literate person before.

The Interests Section of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the United StatesInterests Section of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Washington is a part of the Pakistani Embassy in Washington, D.C., and is the de facto consular representation of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the United States. Iranian students seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran during the 1979 Iranian Revolution, leading to the breaking of diplomatic relations between Iran and the United States. As part of the Algiers Accords of 1981, the two countries agreed to establish \\"interests sections\\" to look after their interests in the other country. Each country picked a third country, which had friendly relations with both sides, to be its protecting power in the other capital. The Iranian embassy was seized by the U.S. State Department in retaliation for Iran's seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. As a result, the Iranian Interests Section operated out of a small office on Wisconsin Avenue associated with the Pakistani Embassy between 1981 and 2015. It has since relocated to a bigger office on Twenty Third Street.http://www.daftar.org/Eng/default.asp?lang=eng Algeria originally served as Iran's protecting power in the U.S. However, when Iranian leaders expressed support for the Islamic Salvation Front in January 1992, Algeria refused to continue serving as Iran's protecting power. In March 1992, Pakistan agreed to undertake a mandate as Iran's protecting power in the U.S. The Interests Section provides all essential consular services to Iranian citizens and issued visas to foreigners. Since the severing of diplomatic ties by Canada in 2012, the Section also handles the consular affairs of Iranian citizens residing in Canada.  Directors of the Interests Section, Stationed at Washington  This is an incomplete list. As agreed in the Algiers Accords of 1981, the Director is the sole Iranian diplomat at the Section.

Services for American citizens are limited. The section is not authorized to perform any U.S. visa/green card/immigration- related services. Contrary to usual practice, the old U.S. embassy complex was not handed over to the Swiss. Instead, part of the embassy has been turned into an anti-American museum, while the rest has become student organizations' offices.

Whiteknights Park, or the Whiteknights Campus of the University of Reading, is the principal campus of that university. The park covers the area of the manor of Earley Whiteknights, also known as Earley St Nicholas and Earley Regis. Whiteknights Park is some two miles south of the centre of the town of Reading in the English county of Berkshire. The campus is in size and includes lakes, conservation meadows and woodlands as well as being home to most of the university's academic departments and several halls of residence.Ordnance Survey (2006). OS Explorer Map 159 ‚Äì Reading. .  History  The site was the home of John De Erleigh II, the famous foster-son of the Regent of England, William Marshal, but takes its name from the nickname of his great grandson, the 13th-century knight, John De Erleigh IV, the 'White Knight'. The De Erleigh (or D'Earley) family were owners of this manor for some two hundred years before 1365. St. Thomas Cantilupe, Bishop of Hereford and advisor to King Edward I, was allowed to live there briefly during the 1270s. In 1606 the estate was purchased by the nephew of Sir Francis Englefield, following the confiscation of Englefield House and its estates in 1585. The Englefield family in turn sold the estate to George Spencer-Churchill, the Marquis of Blandford, in 1798.David Nash Ford (2001). Royal Berkshire History ‚Äì Whiteknights Park. Retrieved 1 July 2005. Between 1798 and 1819, the estate was the scene of vast extravagance and wild entertainments, all at the Marquis' expense. Splendid gardens were laid out, complete with the rarest of plants. In 1819, George Spencer, by now the Duke of Marlborough, became bankrupt and moved to his family home at Blenheim Palace at Woodstock in Oxfordshire. The gardens of the Whiteknights estate have been described in a book by Barbara Hofland with engraved pictures of the gardens and its multitude of bridges, fountains, seats and grottoes by her husband Thomas Christopher Hofland. The book was ordered by the then Marquess of Blandford, but like many other items that he ordered or purchased, it was never paid for. The gardens boasted a \\"chantilly garden\\" in the French style, a vineyard, a wilderness, a cottage, a gothic chapel, botanical gardens full of the rarest plants, many of them new from the Americas, an iron bridge, a stone bridge, an extensive sheep walk, an elm grove, an oak grove, a cedar seat, wychelms and cedars, an ice house, several conservatories, greenhouses and heated basins. In the grounds, cast-iron or wooden baskets filled with scarlet sage or the then exotic begonias were scattered throughout the lawns. There were many, some garden-critics commented \\"too many\\" seats, covered seats, treillages and pavilions. Mary Soames, who wrote a book about the 5th Duke of Marlborough and his gardens in Whiteknights and Blenheim remarked that the 280 acres were \\"too small a canvas\\" for the marquesses' \\"broad brush\\".The profligate Duke The estate was sold off and the house was demolished in 1840, supposedly by a mob of the Duke's angry creditors. The land was broken up into six leasehold units in 1867 and a number of the new houses were designed by Alfred Waterhouse, including his own residence at Foxhill House and the smaller Whiteknights House (now called Old Whiteknights House) for his father. During the Second World War, part of the park closest to the Earley Gate entrance was used for 'temporary' government offices, and several ranges of these single story, brick built, corridor and spur buildings still stand. After the war, this area became home to the Region 6 War Room responsible for civil defence in south- central England. The resulting nuclear bunker constructed in the 1950s still stands in a little visited corner of the campus, although demolition had been proposed in the 2007 campus development plan. However, in March 2009 the threatened building was given Grade II listed status, so demolition seems unlikely. The bunker is currently maintained and used by the campus library as a storage and cataloguing facility for books not present in the library itself. In the years after the second World War some traces of the gardens of the Marquess of Blandford have been discovered. There were a few old exotic trees and part of a fountain was found on a skip.The profligate Duke  Campus  The University of Reading purchased Whiteknights Park in 1947, and today it is the home of the university's administration, most of the academic departments and six halls of residence. The halls of residence (Bridges, Childs, MacKinder, Stenton, Windsor, and Wessex) are all along Whiteknights Road and Upper Redlands Road sides of the campus, with their own vehicular access off those roads and with only pedestrian access to the core of the campus. Along the Wilderness Road and Pepper Lane sides of the campus, the campus is screened from the outside by undeveloped woodland and by the Harris Garden, the university's botanical garden. The campus core is therefore only easily visible from outside in the area around the main entrance on the Shinfield Road and the adjacent Elmhurst Road. The centre of the campus is bisected into two unequal halves by a chain of lakes which are crossed by several pedestrian bridges but with no vehicular link. To the west of the lakes can be found most of the academic departments, catering services, the university administration and the students union building. With the exception of a couple of surviving Victorian residences, including Foxhill House, all of these are housed in purpose built buildings dating from the 1950s to the 2000s. The Ure Museum of Greek Archaeology, University of Reading Herbarium and the Cole Museum of Zoology are both found in this area. The largest building on the campus, the Edith Morley Building, forms one end of the central courtyard. Previously known as the HumSS (Humanities and Social Sciences) building before being renamed in commemoration of Edith Morley in 2017, it is sometimes nicknamed 'The Maze' due to its significant size and complex layout of corridors. The RUSU building comprises the students' union itself, a small parade of shops including a bookstore, a bubble tea shop, cafe and an oriental mini supermarket, as well as two of the university's bars and clubs. Next door to the RUSU building is a branch of Co-op Food. To the east of the lakes and surrounding conservation meadowland is the Earley Gate area of the campus. The second-world war era buildings here house the Fine Art Department, the Department of Typography and Graphic Communication, and various service functions. More recent buildings, dating from the 1990s and 2000s, house the Department of Applied Statistics; the Department of Meteorology; the School of Agriculture, Policy and Development; and the School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences. Also in this area can be found the Reading Enterprise Centre, the Science & Technology Centre, the University Atmospheric Observatory, and an NHS Speech and Language Therapy clinic, used by the students and staff of the Department of Clinical Language Sciences. Although the campus is much closer to the centre of Reading than it is to the town of Wokingham, the boundary between the unitary authorities of Reading and Wokingham meanders across the campus in a rather unpredictable fashion. The campus is split about one third to Reading, two thirds to Wokingham.

It is accredited by the American Bar Association and enrolls about 870 students. Its campus includes the Bullocks Wilshire building, an art deco National Register of Historic Places landmark built in 1929. Southwestern is an independent law school with no affiliation to any undergraduate university.  History  Moot court Southwestern Law School was founded on November 25, 1911, as the Southwestern College of Law. John J. Schumacher, its founder, intended the nonprofit institution to be a law school that reached out to women and minorities. The school is the second oldest law school in Los Angeles. Southwestern received a university charter in 1913 after it expanded to include a number of other disciplines including a business school. Southwestern's first home was in the Union Oil Building in downtown Los Angeles, followed by a small campus on South Hill Street, where it existed for the ensuing decades. The Great Depression and Second World War took a severe toll on the enrollment, and by the end of the 1930s the law school was the only school that remained. However, as veterans returned home the school experienced a surge of interest, and in 1974, the campus was moved to the school's current location on Westmoreland Avenue in the Wilshire Center area of Los Angeles. It joined the Association of American Law Schools (AALS) in 1974. It is a member of the North American Consortium on Legal Education. In 1994, Southwestern acquired the adjacent Bullocks Wilshire building, a historic landmark which was subsequently renovated to house the school's law library, classrooms, faculty offices, and court room and advocacy center.  Campus  The Bullocks Wilshire Building on the campus of the Southwestern Law School The Promenade at the center of the Southwestern Law School campus The campus is in the Koreatown area of the Mid-Wilshire district near downtown Los Angeles. The campus comprises the Westmoreland Building and the Bullocks Wilshire Building. Both house classrooms, administrative offices, and faculty offices. The Bullocks Wilshire Building also houses the Leigh Taylor Law Library (named for a former Dean of the law school), the Julian Dixon Courtroom and Advocacy Center, a fitness center, a dining area, and student lounges. The Westmoreland Building is a typical campus building, while the Bullocks Wilshire Building is a fully renovated art deco landmark restored to its 1929 state, from the clocks on the walls to the \\"showcases\\" in the library. At over and featuring over 470,000 volumes, the Leigh H. Taylor Law Library is the second largest academic law library facility in California. As of fall semester 2013, Southwestern opened student housing \\"The Residences at 7th\\". The Residences at 7th include 133 units ranging from studio to two bedrooms housing 153 or more students.  Bar passage rate and rankings  Based on July 2018 results, 53% of Southwestern Law graduates taking the test for the first time passed the California State Bar, vs. a statewide average of 55% for all first-time takers and a statewide average of 64% for first-time takers who graduated from ABA-approved law schools. Southwestern was ranked 146-192 in the 2019 U.S. News and World Report \\"Best Law Schools\\" rankings. The part-time program was ranked 42nd of 69. Southwestern has been ranked among the top entertainment law schools in The Hollywood Reporter  Post- graduation employment  According to Southwestern's official 2013 ABA- required disclosures, 38.3% of the Class of 2013 obtained full-time, long- term, JD-required employment nine months after graduation, excluding solo- practitioners. Southwestern's Law School Transparency under-employment score is 26.7%, indicating the percentage of the Class of 2013 unemployed, pursuing an additional degree, or working in a non-professional, short-term, or part- time job nine months after graduation. According to the law professor blog, The Faculty Lounge, based on 2012 ABA data, 44.1% of graduates obtained full- time, long-term, positions requiring bar admission (i.e., jobs as lawyers), nine months after graduation, ranking 154th out of 197 law schools.Rosin, Gary. \\"Full Rankings: Bar Admission Required, Full-Time, Long Term\\", The Faculty Lounge, March 30, 2013.

Low student-faculty ratio in the classroom promotes cooperative teaching and intellectual discussion among classmates. The program has a limited enrollment. = Joint Degree Programs = Southwestern has joined forces with the Drucker Graduate School of Management to create dual- degree programs. Students at Southwestern and the Drucker School, part of Claremont Graduate University (CGU), will be able to earn a J.D. and Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.), a J.D. and Master of Arts in Management (M.A.M.), or a J.D. and Executive Master of Business Administration (E.M.B.A.). TB.A./J.D. Joint Degree Program Under a partnership agreement with California State University, Northridge in which students will be able to simultaneously earn their Bachelor of Arts and Juris Doctor in six years instead of seven years. Starting in fall 2014, the program enrolls up to 35 incoming CSUN freshmen. Students spend three years completing their undergraduate course requirements and their first year of law school will also count as their fourth year of undergraduate education. Students in the program also receive a $10,000 Wildman/Schumacher entering student scholarship. The scholarship can be renewed provided that a minimum 2.7 GPA is maintained. In order to qualify for the program incoming freshmen must have a minimum 3.0 GPA and have received either a minimum score of 25 on the ACT or 1140 on the SAT. In addition, students in the program must maintain a 3.40 GPA and receive a 156 or higher on the LSAT. According to Dean Austen Parrish, the program will help young, promising undergraduate students pursue a legal education. = Master of Laws (LL.M.) =  General studies  Southwestern offers an individualized LL.M. program for students who have already earned a law degree and are interested in furthering their legal education. The program allows students to choose their own focus of study, from American Legal Systems to International Law to Technology Innovation and Commercialization. = Advocacy training = In 2006, Southwestern was awarded a federal grant to train Mexican lawyers and law faculty in advocacy skills as part of a USAID effort to assist Mexican legal reform.  Publications  = Southwestern Law Review = Law Review is a student-edited quarterly journal that publishes scholarly articles and commentary on a variety of legal issues in California and federal law contributed by prominent jurists, practitioners, law professors, and student members of the Law Review staff. Annual Symposia and the Distinguished Lecture Series are sponsored by Law Review. These programs feature prominent members of the legal community lecturing on areas of legal expertise and participating in panel discussions on relevant emerging and contemporary legal issues. = Southwestern Journal of International Law = Formerly the Southwestern Journal of Law and Trade in the Americas, the journal focuses on issues of international law and trade, publishing scholarly articles and notes exploring areas such as international insolvency, environmental law, international trade issues, NAFTA, international arbitration, privatization in Central and South American countries, immigration, human rights, and international crime. On October 3, 2008, the Southwestern Journal of International Law hosted one of the first U.S. conferences on Arctic sovereignty, featuring legal scholars from both the United States and Canada. = Journal of International Media & Entertainment Law = In association with the American Bar Association Forum on Communications Law and Forum on Entertainment and Sports Industries, the Journal of International Media & Entertainment Law explores the complex and unsettled legal issues surrounding the creation and distribution of media and entertainment products on a worldwide basis, which necessarily implicate the laws, customs, and practices of multiple jurisdictions. Additionally, it examines the impact of the Internet and other technologies, the often conflicting laws affecting those issues, and the legal ramifications of widely divergent cultural views of privacy, defamation, intellectual property, and government regulation.

It was an important military and economic center during the French and Indian War (1754‚Äì63) and figured significantly in the early career of George Washington. History At the current location of the city of Cumberland, Maryland, a crude frontier fort was constructed at the confluence of Wills Creek and the Potomac River in fall 1754 by troops of the Maryland militia, under the command of Captain John Dagworthy, and under the overall command of Colonel James Innes, the commander-in-chief of colonial forces at that time. A few years earlier, Thomas Cresap had established a trading post nearby, and hired Native Americans including the local chief Nemacolin to blaze a shorter path across the Allegheny Mountains to Redstone Creek on the Monongahela River, which became known as Nemacolin's Path. Initially named Fort Mount Pleasant, it was renamed Fort Cumberland in 1755.History Reconsidered,\\"Timeline of Maryland Forces, 1754-1764\\", extracts from the colonial Maryland Gazette September‚ÄìOctober 1754; accessed 13 October 2010. Ft Cumberland figured prominently in the French & Indian War in 1755, when it became a rally point for British forces under command of General Braddock. The wood palisade fort is now gone, and occupying the site is the existing Emmanuel Episcopal Church, but the old fort tunnels still remain underneath. This fort once marked the westernmost outpost of the British Empire in America, and was the jumping-off point for General Braddock's disastrous expedition against the French at Fort Duquesne in present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. When Braddock was killed, a young officer of Virginia militia, George Washington, led the troops back to Fort Cumberland. At the fort, Washington clashed with Captain Dagworthy over the issue of military rank and which colonial officer should be in command: Washington was a Major in the Virginia militia, outranking the Maryland Captain, but Dagworthy countered that because he also held a Royal commission as a Captain in the Provincial Troops, he automatically outranked any colonial militia officer.Delmarvanow.com, 6 October 2010, Stubborn Mr. John Dagworthy , by Maryland historian Michael Morgan; accessed 13 October 2010.Edward H.

This nikaya consists of fifteen (Thailand), fifteen (Sri Lanka follows Buddhaghosa's list), or eighteen books (Burma) in different editions on various topics attributed to the Buddha and his chief disciples. The word ' in the title means ‚Äòsmall‚Äô in Pali and ' is ‚Äòcollection‚Äô. The equivalent collection in the Chinese and Tibetan canons is the K·π£udraka ƒÄgama, but there is substantial variation among the collections.  Historical development  Professor Hirakawa Akira has statedA History of Indian Buddhism, Hirakawa Akira, translated and edited by Paul Groner, Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, Delhi, 1993, page 128 that the Khuddaka Nikaya represent a stage in the development of the Pali Canon / Agamas in which new material was not added any more to the rest of the Sutta Pitaka, but was added to a 'Khuddaka Pitaka' instead. This Khuddaka Pitaka was the repository for materials that were left out of the four Agamas/Nikayas (the Digha Nikaya, Majjhima Nikaya, Samyutta Nikaya and Anguttara Nikaya) and thus included both early and late texts. Some of the other schools that included a Khuddaka Pitaka in their canons were the Mahisasaka, Dharmaguptaka and Mahasanghika. The Khuddaka Nikaya of the Theravada school is the only complete extant example of such a Khuddaka Pitaka. Some texts from the Dharmaguptaka K·π£udraka ƒÄgama are preserved in Chinese and Tibetan translation, and fragments of Gandhari versions have also been discovered. On the dating of the various books in the Khuddaka Nikaya, Oliver Abeynayake notes that: Contents This nikaya contains some or all of the following texts: # Khuddakapatha # Dhammapada # Udana # Itivuttaka # Suttanipata # Vimanavatthu # Petavatthu # Theragatha # Therigatha # Jataka # Niddesa # Patisambhidamagga # Apadana # Buddhavamsa # Cariyapitaka # Nettipakarana or Netti (included in Burmese and Sinhalese editions, but not in Thai edition) # Petakopadesa (included in Burmese and Sinhalese editions, but not in Thai edition) # Milindapanha (included in Burmese edition, but not in Sinhalese and Thai editions) The introduction to the Sumangalavilasini, the commentary on the Digha Nikaya compiled in the fourth or fifth century by Buddhaghosa on the basis of earlier commentaries that no longer survive, says that the reciters of the Digha listed 2-12 in this nikaya, while the reciters of the Majjhima Nikaya listed 2-15. Later, it gives a listing of the contents of the Canon also found in the introductions to the commentaries on the Vinaya and Abhidhamma Pitakas, which gives 1-15 for this nikaya, though it also includes an alternative classification in which the Vinaya and Abhidhamma are also included in this nikaya, so that the five nikayas are a classification of the whole Canon, not just the Sutta Pitaka. Scholars conclude on the basis of these lists that 13-15 were added later, and 1 later still. Both surviving subcommentaries on the passage about reciters explain the apparent difference between the reciters as being, not a substantive disagreement on the contents of the Canon, but merely a nominal one on its classification. Thus they say for example that the Digha reciters did regard 15 as canonical but counted it as part of 10 instead of a separate book. Similarly, the more recent subcommentary, compiled by the head of the Burmese sangha about two centuries ago, says that 16 and 17 were counted as part of 11 and/or 12.Journal of the Pali Text Society, volume XXVIII The full list of 18 books are included in the inscriptions approved by the Burmese Fifth Council and in the printed edition of the text recited at the Sixth Council.

History left Matagami was founded in 1963 with the development of mining in the area. Previously, it existed only as a very small prospecting camp accessible only by float plane, but after a viable mineral deposit was found in the late 1950s a permanent settlement began to be established. In 1962, the Quebec Toponomy Commission attempted to name the new community Mazenod after Charles-Joseph-Eug√®ne de Mazenod, the founder of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, but after a public outcry by local residents the community was named after Matagami Lake.

The station is owned by Entercom and broadcasts a rhythmic contemporary format. KSFM's studios and offices are located at 5345 Madison Avenue in Sacramento, and its transmitter is in Woodland. From 2006 to 2010, KSFM's slogan was \\"Sacramento's #1 Station for Hip-Hop and R&B;\\". In 2010, the station changed its slogan to simply \\"102-5\\" with a broader mix of hip-hop, R&B;, and rhythmic pop music. Entercom bills KSFM as a rhythmic top 40 station due to its multicultural listenership. KSFM broadcasts in HD Radio. History =KATT/KRBT= On February 4, 1961, the station at 102.5 FM signed on as KATT, branded \\"The Tiger Tail\\". The station aired a middle of the road format and was owned by the Interstate Broadcasting Company, but by 1968, KATT went silent. In 1970, the station returned to the air as KRBT (Robot 10-25), a contemporary hit radio (CHR) outlet. It started out with live disc jockeys, but became automated shortly thereafter. On August 31, 1971, the station's owners, Tiger Broadcasting, sold the operation to KULA Broadcasting for $94,000. KULA Broadcasting, owner of KGMS (1380 AM), took control of the station on April 1, 1972 and switched the format to easy listening. Remaining an automated operation, KRBT adopted new call letters KSFM that June. (Previously, the KSFM call letters were assigned to a station in Sacramento on 96.9 FM, but that station was sold to the owners of Pacific Southwest Airlines and renamed as KPSC.) =Earth Radio 102= In early 1974, KULA Broadcasting searched for a new programmer and new format for KSFM after upgrading the station's transmitter and improving its signal to cover the Sacramento radio market from suburban Woodland. The owners hired Don Wright, formerly of KZAP, KXOA/KNDE, and KRBT. His plan was to flip the station to progressive rock, a rock-based format that was slightly more structured than the freeform format of KZAP. The air talent would have a mid-tempo delivery style (neither fast and screaming nor completely laid back). The station kept the KSFM call letters but used the moniker \\"Earth Rock 102 KSFM\\". On April 15, 1974, \\"Earth Rock 102\\" made its debut. Drake-Chenault, owners of KXOA-FM (107.9 FM), attempted to sue KSFM because KXOA-FM had recently used the \\"Earth Rock\\" name on the air. As a result, in July 1974, KSFM was rebranded as \\"Earth Radio 102\\". Within six months of its debut, \\"KSFM Earth Radio 102\\" reached number six in the Sacramento ratings. When the station management only delivered a $25 monthly pay raise, much of the air staff left to run KSJO in San Jose, where they installed the Earth Rock format. Nonetheless, KSFM continued to obtain positive ratings. The format featured both well- established and up-and-coming rock artists. While the station would play popular rock acts, the announcers often focused on their deeper album cuts. Additionally, the music flow was diverse enough that one could hear a searing Led Zeppelin track and a folksy Joni Mitchell song in the same set, yet the music would flow naturally. The air talent programmed much of the music without the use of a set playlist. While a listener could hear an occasional country record by Jerry Jeff Walker or a reggae tune by Peter Tosh, they knew it would be followed by a rock record along with song information from the knowledgeable air talent. KSFM's format was dayparted: listeners would be treated to a softer rock sound in the daytime and hard rock at night. With Earth Radio 102's limited song repetition, listeners were often surprised by what would play next. Earth Radio had several additional programming features that contributed to its unique sound. KSFM ran a news block each weekday morning from 9:20 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. known as \\"Earth News\\". The alternative news program included nationally syndicated interviews with rock stars of the day, as well as odd information that would interest the station's audience. Also on weekdays at 9:40 a.m., 1:40 p.m., and 6:40 p.m., the station announced upcoming concerts in both local and regional venues. Some evenings, the station would play an entire album from start to finish; starting out as a weekly feature, it was expanded to three nights a week. Between record sides, announcer Dave Whittaker would play an \\"Instrumental Interlude\\", a track from a completely different artist without vocals. In late 1976, the station hired Dennis Newhall as an on-air staff announcer. He had previous experience with KZAP and KSJO. Subsequently, he was promoted to program director in 1977. Earth Radio 102's success continued until mid-1979. In January 1979, KZAP's new owners installed radio consultant Lee Abrams' \\"Super Stars\\" format on the formerly freeform station. KZAP's new format was rock-oriented, stressing the biggest selling artists. The change brought KZAP stellar ratings at the expense of Earth Radio. In the Spring 1979 Arbitron ratings, KSFM went from a 4.7 share to 3.1. Initially, there were rumors of KSFM either becoming more mainstream or switching to a country music format. =FM102: Disco, contemporary, and urban= In August 1979, KSFM announced it would be switching to a more \\"mass appeal\\" music the following month. On August 20, the Sacramento Union featured an article on the format switch. The entire air staff would be replaced. KSFM management hired radio consultant Jerry Clifton to initiate the new format. In the Union article, Clifton described the \\"Earth Radio\\" format as \\"esoteric ... similar to a Jazz station\\". KSFM broadcast its last full day of progressive rock on September 9, 1979. The following day, September 10, the station began a five-day stunting period during it played a full day of music by a well-known artist each day. The first day consisted of all-Led Zeppelin music, while the second day featured the Beatles. By the fifth day, the station was playing Donna Summer and the Bee Gees as featured artists. On September 14, 1979, KSFM flipped to a hybrid top 40/disco format with the branding \\"FM102\\". Under the leadership of incoming programming director Jeff Lucifer, and based on the recommendations of Clifton, KSFM began to gradually work its way up in the ratings with its dance-friendly \\"churban\\" (a mix of contemporary hits and urban) format. Clifton would later apply this formula to other stations like KGGI in Riverside, California, WJMH in Greensboro, North Carolina, and WPOW in Miami (the last two both sister stations to KSFM). By June 1983, KSFM evolved all the way to its current rhythmic contemporary direction under the guidance of future WNOW-FM program director Rick Gillette and music director Chris Collins, the latter who also hosted The FM102 Morning Zoo and later succeeded Gillette as operating manager and PD. The move occurred after KPOP, the Sacramento market's only urban contemporary outlet at the time, flipped formats to modern rock. Gillette and Collins realized that dance music, popular in the clubs and the streets, did not receive any airplay in the area. KSFM took advantage of this opportunity, leading the station to several number one Arbitron rankings in the market under their guidance, eventually beating the more-mainstream top 40 stations. In July 1987, KSFM owner Duffy Broadcasting Corp. sold all but one of its stations to Genesis Broadcasting Company, a new entity owned in part by Duffy executives, for $74 million. KSFM faced a series of legal issues in the early 1990s. In 1990, KWOD owner Ed Stolz filed a libel lawsuit against Genesis Broadcasting for $10 million. According to the suit, on June 30, 1989, Collins disparaged KWOD on-air as being anti-gay and anti-African American; this resulted in lost advertisers, threats to station staff, and a drop in ratings. Collins, in turn, claimed his remarks were in response to anti-gay comments by KWOD morning host Pat Garrett. In late 1993, Collins sued Genesis Broadcasting for wrongful termination, seeking at least the approximate $335,000 value of the remaining two years of his contract. He alleged he was fired for threatening to report drug use in the workplace and associated abusive behavior by supervisors. Genesis responded that Collins was dismissed because of declining ratings. This dispute threatened to derail the pending merger of Genesis with Secret Communications. Royce International, then-owner of KWOD, petitioned the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to investigate the drug use allegations, as well as resolve issues related to a previous petition involving Genesis' alleged interference in Royce's business activities. The merger ultimately was approved, finally closing on August 1, 1994. In May 1996, Secret Communications sent KSFM and sister station KMJI (1380 AM) to American Radio Systems in a four-station swap worth $48.5 million, acquiring WQRS in Detroit and WFLN-FM in Philadelphia. KSFM continued to lead the market as the top 40 station of choice in Sacramento until the arrivals of mainstream contemporary hit radio (CHR) outlet KDND (107.9 The End) and urban-formatted KBMB (103.5 The Bomb) in 1998. KSFM offered a current-based mix of rhythmic pop, R&B;, and hip hop product in its playlist. Those ingredients placed KSFM between KDND, which offered listeners a broad-based playlist, and KBMB, which heavily emphasized hip hop. =CBS Radio era= In 1998, KSFM was bought by Infinity Broadcasting Corporation, which had already been acquired by Westinghouse Broadcasting. Westinghouse merged with CBS Radio shortly thereafter. Under CBS Radio ownership, the KSFM lineup featured programming director Tony Tecate in mornings, Bre in middays, Short-E in afternoons, Nina in evenings and The Specialist overnights. Featured programs included Club 102 with The Specialist on Friday and Saturday nights. In January 2010, KSFM's Arbitron ratings stood at a 3.1 share for persons ages 12 and over ‚Äî the lowest since the Spring 1979 report, when the station aired progressive rock. However, by April 2010, KSFM rebounded, although it achieved nowhere the record-breaking numbers from 1994 to 1997 when 11 and 12 shares under PD's Rick Thomas and Bob West were common. In the June 2012 Portable People Meter (PPM) report, KSFM's ratings rose enough to bring the station to fourth place in the Sacramento market. On June 1, 2010, KSFM relocated its studios from 1750 Howe Avenue to 280 Commerce Circle in Sacramento, home to the CBS Radio cluster there. =Entercom era= On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom. Entercom also owns KKDO, KUDL, KSEG, KRXQ, and KIFM in the Sacramento market; the company also owned KDND until it shut down that station and surrendered its license to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) two days later. On October 10, 2017, it was announced that KSFM would be the only station in the CBS Radio Sacramento cluster that would remain with Entercom following the merger of the two companies. Entercom's decision to keep KSFM while spinning off the other former CBS stations was due to its rhythmic top 40 format, which would give the company another top 40 station to pair with KUDL and serve as flankers in the market following KDND's aforementioned shutdown, much like the strategy with future rock siblings KKDO, KSEG, and KRXQ. KHTK, KNCI, KYMX, and KZZO were divested into a blind trust with Bonneville International operating them under a local marketing agreement until they could find new owners. Bonneville purchased the stations outright in September 2018. The CBS Radio-Entercom merger was approved on November 9, 2017 and was consummated on November 17. Upon the change of ownership, KSFM relocated to Entercom's studio building on Madison Avenue in Sacramento. In May 2018, Entercom replaced the KSFM staff. Michael Buhrman, former on-air personality from sister station KQKS in Denver, took over as the new PD and afternoon host, with Mia Amor from KRBQ in San Francisco working mornings, Nina Hajian voice-tracking middays from WBBM-FM in Chicago, and SOOSH*E (who was let go from KHHM after Entravision made major job cuts) taking evenings. In January 2019, KSFM boasted a 100% local on-air staff again when Bianca V moved to middays; she previously had been a part of the KSFM street team and hosting the Club 102 mix show. The station also brought in DJ Elements and DJ Oasis to mix their Club 102 mix shows, along with DJ Squintz who hosts the overnight time-slot. As of July 2019, KSFM once again became the only rhythmic top 40 station in Sacramento following KHHM's flip to a bilingual top 40 direction.Entravision Brings Fuego to Sacramento & Modesto Radioinsight - July 29, 2019 Since that move, KSFM has seen a resurgence ratings wise, eventually leading sibling KUDL in the Nielsen Audio ratings to become the most-listened to Top 40 station in Sacramento.‚ÄúJanuary 2020 (1/2 ‚Äì 1/29) Nielsen Audio PPM Ratings Day 3: News/Talkers Impeached To Big Gains‚Äù from Radio Insight (February 20, 2020)Sacramento Nielsen Audio Ratings from Radio Insight HD radio KSFM broadcasts in the HD Radio format with two digital subchannels: *KSFM-HD1 is a digital simulcast of the analog signal. *KSFM-HD2 broadcasts an urban adult contemporary format known as \\"The Love Train\\".

History  The natives of the island inhabited the valley of Jarabacoa. It is assumed that the city's name was formed out of the words 'Jaraba' and 'Coa', meaning \\"Land of Waters\\" in the native language. Some say that the Spanish conquistadors actually made it to Jarabacoa in their search for gold, but later abandoned the expedition. Some reasons include, resistance by the natives or as some say, because no large finds were ever made, although to this day gold can be washed from some of the many rivers. Jarabacoa most likely belonged to the Chiefdom of Maguana making it part of the kingdom of Cibao. Necessary archaeological work has yet to take place, but it can be assumed that the natives lived in the area long before the arrival of Christopher Columbus. It wasn't until 1805 that the area began being re- populated, during the Haitian invasion of the Cibao, when survivors from the massacres of Santiago de los Caballeros and La Vega escaped to the mountains of the Central Range and settled in the valley of Jarabacoa. In 1854, a military post was established and the town was formally founded. On September 27, 1858 the town was incorporated as a municipality.  Geography and climate La Confluencia, Jarabacoa Jarabacoa has a Tropical rainforest climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Af ). Due to its tropical location and high elevation (about 525m above sea level), it has warm days and mild nights during most of the year, and temperate days and cool nights during a few winter months. Because of its mild temperatures, visitors have christened Jarabacoa as \\"The City of Everlasting Spring.\\" One of the main touristic attractions is the mountains and natural environment of the area due to its location in the center of the Central Range. It is also one of the main access to the Pico Duarte and the Ebano Verde Scientific Reserve. Jarabacoa has three large rivers, Baiguate, Jimenoa and the Yaque del Norte, the last two merge in the Confluencia, continuing on as the Yaque del Norte, the second largest river in the country. The coldest temperature ever recorded was 7.1 ¬∞C (44.8 ¬∞F), on 24 February 2012.

UK Islamic Academy. . Early life and marriage Aminah was born to Wahb ibn Abd Manaf and Barrah bint ‚ÄòAbd al ‚ÄòUzzƒÅ ibn ‚ÄòUthmƒÅn ibn ‚ÄòAbd al-DƒÅr in Mecca. She was a member of the Banu Zuhrah clan in the tribe of Quraysh who claimed descent from Abraham through his son Ishmael. Her ancestor Zuhrah was the elder brother of Qusayy ibn Kilab, who was also an ancestor of Abdullah ibn Abdul-Muttalib. Qusayy ibn Kilab became the first Quraysh custodian of the Kaaba. Abdul Mutallib proposed the marriage of Abdullah, his youngest son, and Aminah. Some sources state that Aminah's father accepted the match, while others say that it was Aminah's uncle Wuhaib, who was serving as her guardian. The two were married soon after. Abdullah spent much of Aminah's pregnancy away from home as part of a merchant caravan, and died of disease before the birth of his son.Ibn Sa'd/Haq pp. 107-108. Birth of Muhammad Three months after Abdullah's death, in 570 CE, Muhammad was born. As was tradition among all the great families at the time, Aminah sent Muhammad into the desert as a baby. The belief was that in the desert, one would learn self- discipline, nobility, and freedom. During this time, Muhammad was nursed by Halimah bint Abi Dhuayb, a poor Bedouin woman from the tribe of Banu Sa'ad, a branch of the HawƒÅzin.\\"Muhammad: Prophet of Islam\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 28 September 2009. Retrieved on 28 September 2009. When Muhammad was six years old, he was reunited with Aminah, who took him to visit her relatives in Yathrib (later Medina). Upon their return to Mecca a month later, accompanied by her slave Umm Ayman, Aminah fell ill. She died around the year 577 or 578 ADPeters, F.E. Muhammad and the Origins of Islam. State University of New York Press: Albany, 1994. . and was buried in the village of Abwa'. The young Muhammad was taken in first by his paternal grandfather Abd al-Muttalib and later by his paternal uncle Abu Talib ibn Abd al-Muttalib. Fate in the afterlife Islamic scholars have long been divided over the religious beliefs of Muhammad's mother and her fate in the afterlife. One transmission by Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah states that God refused to forgive Aminah for her disbelief. Another transmission in Musnad al-Bazzar states that the Muhammad's mother was brought back to life and accepted Islam then returned to the barzakh. Some Ash øari and Shafi‚Äòi scholars argued that neither would be punished in the afterlife, as they were ahl al-fatrah, or \\"people of the interval\\" between the prophetic messages of Jesus and Muhammad. The concept of ahl al-fatrah is not universally accepted among Islamic scholars, and there is debate concerning the extent of salvation available for active practitioners of polytheism, though the majority of scholars have come to agree with it and disregard the ahadith stating that Muhammad's parents were condemned to hell. While a work attributed to Abu Hanifa, an early Sunni scholar, stated that both Aminah and Abdullah died upon their innate nature (mata 'ala al-fitra), some later authors of mawlid texts related a tradition in which Aminah and Abdullah were temporarily revived and embraced Islam. Scholars like Ibn Taymiyya stated that this was a lie, though al-Qurtubi stated that the concept did not disagree with Islamic theology. According to Ali al-Qari, the preferred view is that both the parents of Muhammad were Muslims. According to Al-Suyuti, Isma'il Haqqi, and other Islamic scholars all of the narrations indicating that the parents of Muhammad were not forgiven were later abrogated when they were brought to life and accepted Islam. Shia Muslims believe that all of Muhammad's ancestors, Aminah included, were monotheists and therefore entitled to paradise. A Shia tradition states that God forbade the fires of hell from touching either of Muhammad's parents.

With Rav Jacob Emden, he is well known as a protagonist in the Emden‚ÄìEybesch√ºtz Controversy. Biography Rav Eybesch√ºtz's father Nosson Nota was the rabbi in Ivanƒçice (, sometimes Eibeschutz), Habsburg Moravia. Rav Eybesch√ºtz was a child prodigy in Talmud; on his father's death, he studied in the yeshiva of Meir Eisenstadt in Prostƒõjov (Prossnitz), and then later in Hole≈°ov (Holleschau). He also lived in Vienna for a short time. He married Elkele Spira, daughter of Rabbi Isaac Spira, and they lived in Hamburg for two years with Mordecai ha-Kohen, Elkele's maternal grandfather. At the age of eighteen, Rav Eybesch√ºtz was appointed rabbi of Mlad√° Boleslav, where he stayed for three years, afterward settling in Prague in 1700 and becoming head of the yeshivah and a famous preacher. The people of Prague held Rav Eybesch√ºtz in high esteem and he was considered second there only to Dayan David Oppenheim. In Prague, Rav Eybesch√ºtz received permission to print the Talmud‚Äîbut with the omission of all passages contradicting the principles of Christianity in consultation with Dayan David Oppenheim. Legends and rumors seeking to discredit the event said that he did this without the consultation of the Rabbis of Prague, and they revoked the printing license. Already in Prague 1724, he was suspected of being a Sabbatean. He even got up on Yom Kippur to denounce the Sabbatean movement, but he remained suspected.Moshe Arie Perlmutter, R.Yehonatan Aibeshits ve-yahaso el ha-Shabtaut : hakirot hadashot 'al yesod ketav ha-yad shel s.va-avo ha-yom el ha-'ayin Therefore, In 1736, Rav Eybeschutz was only appointed dayan of Prague and not chief rabbi. He became rabbi of Metz in 1741. In 1750, he was elected rabbi of the \\"Three Communities:\\" Altona, Hamburg, and Wandsbek. In July 1725, the Ashkenazic beit din of Amsterdam issued a ban of excommunication on the entire Sabbatian sect (kat ha- ma‚Äôaminim). Writings of Sabbatian nature found by the beit Din at that time were attributed to Eybeschutz Emden, Beit Yehonatan ha-Sofer, fol. 4. In early September, similar excommunication proclamations were issued by the batei din of Frankfurt and the triple community of Altona, Hamburg, and Wandsbeck. The three bans were printed and circulated in other Jewish communities throughout Europe.Excerpts from the testimonies were printed by Emden in his Beit Yehonatan ha-Sofer, Altona 1762, fol. 4v; the full text of the testimonies, letters, and proclamations pertaining to the investigation can be found in [Josef Prager], Gahalei Esh, Oxford, Bodleian Library. Ms. 2186, Vol. I, fols. 70r -129 Rabbi Ezekiel Katzenellenbogen, the chief rabbi of the Triple Community Gahalei Esh, Vol. I, fol. 54 was unwilling to attack Eybesch√ºtz publicly, mentioning that ‚Äògreater than him have fallen and crumbled‚Äô and that ‚Äòthere is nothing we can do to him‚Äô Gahalei Esh, Vol. I, fol. 54 However, Rabbi Katzenelenbogen stated that one of the texts found by the Amsterdam beit din \\"Va-Avo ha-Yom el ha-Ayyin‚Äù was authored by Rabbi Jonathan Eybesch√ºtz and declared that the all copies of the work that were in circulation should be immediately burned. Prager, Gahalei Esh, Vol. I, fol. 54v. As a result of Eybeschutz and other rabbis in Prague formulating a new (and different) ban against Sabbatianism in September of that year his reputation was restored and Eybeschutz was regarded as having been totally vindicated. [Prager], Gahalei Esh, fol.112r The issue was to arise again, albeit tangentially, in the 1751 dispute between Emden and Eybeschutz. He was \\"an acknowledged genius\\" in at least three separate areas of Jewish religious creativity: Talmud and Jewish law (halakhah); homiletics (derush) and popular preaching; and Kabbalah. \\"He was a man of erudition, but he owed his fame chiefly to his personality. Few men of the period so profoundly impressed their mark on Jewish life.\\" His granddaughter was the Breslau poet and intellectual , born Esther Gad. Sabbatian controversy Rav Eybesch√ºtz again became suspected of harboring secret Sabbatean beliefs because of a dispute that arose concerning the amulets which he was suspected of issuing. It was alleged that these amulets recognized the Messianic claims of Sabbatai Zevi. The controversy started when Rav Yaakov Emden found serious connections between the Kabbalistic and homiletic writings of Rav Eybeschutz with those of the known Sabbatean Judah Leib Prossnitz, whom Rav Eybesch√ºtz knew from his days in Prossnitz. Rabbi Jacob Emden accused him of heresy. The majority of the rabbis in Poland, Moravia, and Bohemia, as well as the leaders of the Three Communities supported Rav Eybesch√ºtz: the accusation was \\"utterly incredible\\"‚Äîin 1725, Rav Eybesch√ºtz was among the Prague rabbis who excommunicated the Sabbateans. Others suggest that the Rabbis issued this ruling because they feared the repercussions if their leading figure, Rav Eybesch√ºtz, was found to be a Sabbatean.Rabbi Jacob Emden suggests that the rabbis decided against attacking Eybeschutz out of a reluctance to offend his powerful family and a fear of rich supporters of his living in their communities Emden, Sefer Hitabbkut, fos. 1v-2r Recent evidence has produced the actual amulets and their alleged connection to Sabbatean amulets.Sid Leiman/Simon Schwarzfuchs, New Evidence on the Emden-Eybesch√ºtz Controversy. The Amulets from Metz, in: Revue des Etudes Juives 165 (2006), In 1752, the controversy between Rav Emden and Rav Eybesch√ºtz raged. In December of that year, the Hamburg government banned any more discussion of the amulets, the Senate of Hamburg suspended Rav Eybesch√ºtz, and many members of that congregation demanded that he should submit his case to rabbinical authorities. At this point he was defended by Carl Anton, a convert to Christianity, but a former disciple of Rav Eybesch√ºtz.\\"Kurze Nachricht von dem Falschen Messias Sabbathai Zebhi,\\" etc. (Wolfenb√ºttel, 1752) The controversy was a momentous incident in Jewish history of the period‚Äîinvolving both Rav Yechezkel Landau and the Vilna Gaon‚Äîand may be credited with having crushed the lingering belief in Sabbatai current even in some Orthodox circles. In 1760, the quarrel broke out once more when some Shabbatean elements were discovered among the students of Rav Eybesch√ºtz' yeshivah. At the same time his younger son, Wolf Jonas Eybeschutz, presented himself as a Shabbatean prophet, and was close to several Frankists, with the result that the yeshivah was closed.Carmilly-Weinberger, Moshe. Wolf Jonas Eybesch√ºtz - An \\"Enlightened\\" Sabbatean in Transylvania. In: Studia Judaica, 6 (1997) 7-26 According to Jacob Katz, Rav Jonathan Eybesch√ºtz's grandson was rumored to be Baron Thomas von Schoenfeld, an apostate Jew who inherited his grandfather's collection of Sabbatean kabbalistic works. He eventually left the Sabbatean movement and founded a Masonic lodge called the Asiatische Bruder, one of four Illuminati lodges in Vienna. After his uncle's death on August 10, 1791, he was offered the leadership of the Frankist movement which he refused. Katz disputes this claim however, saying that Baron Thomas von Schoenfeld was a member of the Dobruschka family of Brno and was in no way related, either by blood or marriage, to Rav Eybeschutz. According to Gershom Scholem, the ideology of the Asiatic Brethren mixed Kabbalistic and Sabbatean ideas jumbled together with Christian theosophic doctrines. Some of Rav Eybeschutz's descendants are the Yiddish novelist and Holocaust survivor Chava Rosenfarb (1923‚Äì2011),, Rav Chaim Kreiswirth of Antwerp, Belgium, and Rav Shmuel Wosner (1913‚Äì2015), a prominent Haredi rabbi and posek ('decisor of Jewish law') who lived in Bnei Brak, Israel. Works Thirty of his works in the area of Halakha (Jewish law) have been published. In addition, several of his works on homiletics, teaching methodology, and Kabbalah are currently in print. Only one of his works was published in his lifetime. The posthumous printing of so many of his works is testimony to his influence on his contemporaries through his oral teachings and his personality. *Homiletics (derush) and popular preaching:: **Ya'arot Devash a frequently quoted collection of the sermons of Rabbi Eybeschutz. **Tiferet Yehonatan on the weekly Torah portion **Midrash Yehonatan on the weekly Torah portion **Ahavat Yehonatan on the weekly Haftarah **Shirei Mitzvot, the 613 commandments in rhymed acrostics. ** Notes on the Passover Haggadah, as well as Perush al Piska Had Gadya on the poem Had Gadya *On Talmud and halakhah:: **Chasdei Yehonatan, Pilpulim on assorted Sugyas of Talmud and halakhah. ** Novellae to Shulchan Aruch: Urim ve-Tummim on Choshen Mishpat; Kereti u-Peleti on Yoreh De'ah; Sar ha-Alef on Orach Chayim. ** Notes on Maimonides' Mishneh Torah: Binah la-Ittim and Chiddushim al Hilkot Yom Tov both dealing with the holy days, and both published by his students, based on notes taken from his lectures; Bene Ahuvah on the matrimonial laws. **Tiferet Yisrael, notes on the rabbinical laws of niddah (regarding menstruation), with additions by the editor, his grandson Israel. **Matuk MidVash, notes on the rabbinical laws of shabbos. *On Kabbalah:: **Shem Olam, a collection of letters on the Kabbalah Rabbi Eybeschutz also wrote Luchoth Edut (Tablets of Testimony), in which he describes the whole dispute and attempts to refute the charges against him.

In January 2014, Maggid Books, a division of Koren Publishers Jerusalem published \\"Derash Yehonatan: Around the Year with Rav Yehonatan Eybeshitz\\" by Rabbi Shalom Hammer.

History The company was bought by the Hoeschen family in 1930, and operated by them until it was sold to Molson in 1960, and incorporated as \\"Molson's Fort Garry Brewery Ltd\\". In 1990, Molson merged with Carling-Okeefe and closed the Fort Garry facility. In 1994, Richard D. Hoeschen resurrected the company. At the time, Fort Garry Brewing was the only micro-brewery in Manitoba, and the beer was originally intended only to be available in kegs. Before opening the doors, Hoeschen hired Gary De Pape as Brewmaster and the two developed the Company's flagship brand Fort Garry Dark. Richard D. Hoeschen died on September 16, 2002. In 2003, Fort Garry Brewing amalgamated with Winnipeg's Two Rivers Brewing Company (established in the 1990s), keeping the Fort Garry name, but adding some of Two Rivers‚Äô brands to its product line. On October 15, 2004, Fort Garry Brewing signed an agreement with its former Manitoba rival, New Manitoba Brewing, to warehouse, distribute and market the Agassiz Brewing brand, Catfish Cream Ale. In 2010, Fort Garry Brewing ceased production of the product. Since 2005, Fort Garry Beer is sold in Manitoba and Alberta. As of November 2015, the current brewmaster at Fort Garry is Dan Geddes. In 2007, Fort Garry began to brew and bottle Nubru Blend, the first gluten-free beer in Manitoba, for FarmPure Beverages of Regina, Saskatchewan. On October 22, 2007, Fort Garry Brewing Company amalgamated with Russell Brewing Company as wholly owned subsidiaries of Russell Breweries Inc, of Surrey, British Columbia, in a deal worth $4 million in cash and stock. In 2008, 2009, and 2010, the brewery produced a custom brew for Winnipeg's Folklorama festival, called \\"Folklorama Beer\\". In 2012, Fort Garry Brewing Company partnered with the Winnipeg Goldeyes to produce a pilsner called \\"Angry Fish\\" to promote the team's new secondary logo.

Volunteerism is a powerful means of engaging people in tackling development challenges, and it can transform the pace and nature of development. Volunteerism benefits both society at large and the individual volunteer by strengthening trust, solidarity and reciprocity among citizens, and by purposefully creating opportunities for participation. UNV contributes to peace and development through a dual mandate: mobilizing UN Volunteers for the United Nations and advocating for recognition of volunteers as a way to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). UNV embraces volunteerism as universal and inclusive, and recognizes volunteerism in its diversity as well as the values that sustain it: free will, commitment, engagement and solidarity. In 2019 UNV deployed over 8,000 UN Volunteers to over 40 UN partners in all regions of the world. Based in Bonn, Germany, UNV is active in around 130 countries every year. UNV, with six regional offices and field units in many countries, is administered by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and reports to the UNDP Executive Board.https://www.unv.org/about-unv/who-we-arel History In 1962, the US Peace Corps convened the International Conference on Middle Level Manpower in Puerto Rico, where the role of international volunteers helping to build skills in developing countries was promoted. As a result, the International Peace Corps Secretariat, later the International Secretariat for Volunteer Service (ISVS), was created as a global organization to promote volunteer services for development around the world. A United Nations Volunteers initiative was proposed in a speech at Harvard University on June 13, 1968 by Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and UNV was established 1970 by the UN General Assembly.Chronology UN Volunteers ISVS became instrumental in the establishment of UNV and was itself dissolved in 1976. UNV was originally headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. In 1996, the headquarters moved to Bonn, Germany, specifically to Haus Carstanjen.UNITED NATIONS: VOLUNTEERS PROGRAMME TO SHIFT TO BONN UNV headquarters moved to the former offices of the German Parliament in 2007.

Sadry (Iran), 1970 (first Coordinator of UNV), June 8, 2009 version archived at archive.org UN Volunteers UNV directly mobilizes on average 7,000 people as UN Volunteers every year nationally and internationally, with 80 per cent coming from Global South, and, as of 2020, 50 per cent volunteering within their own countries. UN Volunteers receive a Volunteer Living Allowance (VLA), a financial allowance intended to cover basic living expenses each month. The minimum age for UN Volunteers is 25 years. There is no upper age limit. UN Volunteers help to organize and run local and national elections and support a large number of peacekeeping and humanitarian projects. UN Volunteers comprise one third of all international civilians working in UN peacekeeping operations. With the UNV programme, individuals can volunteer in their own country (national volunteers), in a country different from their country of origin (international volunteers), or through the Internet (online volunteers). Online Volunteering In addition, UNV operates the Online Volunteering Service, a web-based virtual volunteering platform for non- governmental organizations (NGOs) or other civil society organizations, governments or other public institutions, United Nations agencies or other intergovernmental institution to involve online volunteers in various projects. The service was launched in 2000 as a part of NetAid, which hosted and co-managed the service until 2005. The service operates in English, French and Spanish. In 2019, over 13,000 people volunteers with the Online Volunteering service attracted applications from numerous qualified volunteers. Online volunteers mobilized through the Online Volunteering service are volunteers for the organization with which they collaborate. Online Volunteers do not follow the same conditions of service than UN Volunteers e.g. they do not receive a contract from UNV as such, and do not receive a VLA. Plan of Action to Integrate Volunteering into the 2030 Agenda Since 2012, integrating volunteerism into discussions around the post-2015 development agenda has been a priority for UNV. In 2014, UNV focused on supporting the second round of UNDG dialogues on implementation of the post-2015 development agenda. The dialogues were framed around six themes: localizing the post-2015 development agenda, helping to strengthen capacities and build effective institutions, participatory monitoring for accountability, partnerships with civil society, engaging with the private sector, and culture and development. UNV co-led the dialogues on partnerships with civil society and was strongly engaged in the dialogues on participatory monitoring for accountability. Field Units and Post-2015 International UN Youth Volunteers supported all six dialogues in several countries, contributing to and conducting local, national and global events and workshops to ensure stakeholders‚Äô voices were heard, good practices shared and concrete opportunities identified.Achieving the Global Goals: why volunteers are important To achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), people‚Äôs engagement in planning, implementation and monitoring needs to be facilitated and new partnerships forged. Volunteers will be instrumental in this process. This has strongly emerged from an extensive consultation process led by the UN, which has involved over 8 million people, and was summarized as follows by the UN Secretary-General in his Synthesis Report on the post-2015 sustainable development agenda: ‚ÄúAs we seek to build capacities and to help the new agenda to take root, volunteerism can be another powerful and cross-cutting means of implementation. Volunteerism can help to expand and mobilize constituencies, and to engage people in national planning and implementation for the Sustainable Development Goals. And volunteer groups can help to localize the new agenda by providing new spaces of interaction between governments and people for concrete and scalable actions.‚Äù At the seventieth session of the UN General Assembly, the Secretary-General presented a proposed Plan of Action for the next decade and beyond (2016-2030). This plan aims at integrating volunteering in peace and development policies and programmes through a strategic and collective long-term approach that matches the period of SDG implementation. The Plan of Action to Integrate Volunteering into the 2030 Agenda is a framework under the auspices of the United Nations through which Governments, United Nations entities, volunteer-involving organizations, private sector, civil society including academia and other stakeholders come together to integrate volunteerism into the planning and implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by: a) strengthening people‚Äôs ownership of the development agenda; b) integrating volunteerism into national and global implementation strategies; and c) measuring volunteerism. A global technical meeting on volunteering will take place virtually in 2020 as a special event on the margins of the 2020 High-level Political Forum (HLPF) in New York. A UN General Assembly resolution defines the meeting theme ‚ÄúReimagining volunteering for the 2030 Agenda‚Äù and requests that the United Nations Volunteers (UNV) programme organize it jointly with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). The meeting will provide a platform to advance the debate on volunteering and identify how volunteering can accelerate the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Advocacy for recognition of volunteers In 2012 UNV launched the Volunteer Action Counts campaign to tell the world about the impact of volunteering by documenting the actions of volunteers across the globe. Over 64 million actions were counted by the time the Rio+20 summit took place ‚Äî a \\"remarkable testament to bottom- up, grassroots commitment\\" yet one more demonstration of how Rio+20 is mobilizing a global movement for change, as UN Secretary-General, Mr Ban Ki- moon, said to the United Nations General Assembly in 2012. The Volunteer Action Counts website and social media profiles continue to gather stories about volunteering and provide information about upcoming events, opportunities and best practices. Likewise, through the Online Volunteering service newsletter, UNV showcases experiences, best practices and lessons learned about volunteering via the Internet from organizations and volunteers worldwide. UNV celebrates International Volunteer Day on 5 December every year. Past campaigns for IVD can be found on url=http://www.unv.org State of the World‚Äôs Volunteerism Report alt= Every three years UNV produces the State of the World‚Äôs Volunteerism Report, a flagship UN publication designed to strengthen understanding on volunteerism and demonstrate its universality, scope and reach in the twenty-first century. The first State of the World‚Äôs Volunteerism Report by the United Nations Volunteers (UNV) programme was launched at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, United States, on 5 December 2011 and about 80 countries around the world. The report examined important contributions in diverse fields such as sustainable livelihoods, social inclusion, social cohesion and disaster risk reduction. By suggesting how volunteerism can be taken forward, the SWVR also provides an alternative vision of a better society. The second State of the World's Volunteerism Report ‚Äì Transforming Governance was launched in June 2015. It is a \\"review of the power of volunteer voices to help improve the way people are governed. Drawing on evidence from countries as diverse as Brazil, Kenya, Lebanon and Bangladesh, the UN report shows how ordinary people are volunteering their time, energies and skills to improve the way they are governed and engaged at local, national and global levels. Better governance at every level is a pre- requisite for the success of the new set of targets for future international development, the Sustainable Development Goals\\". The 2018 State of the World's Volunteerism Report The thread that binds was launched on 18 July 2018 during the 2018 High Level Political Forum in New York, United States. The report presents new evidence on the role of volunteerism in strengthening community resilience. It finds that communities value volunteerism because it enables them to create collective strategies for dealing with diverse economic, social and environmental challenges. At the same time, unless appropriately supported by wider actors, volunteering can be exclusive and burdensome for some groups. The report thus explores how governments and development actors can best engage with volunteerism to nurture its most beneficial characteristics, while militating against potential harm to the most vulnerable. In doing so, the report provides an important contribution to the evidence base on inclusive, citizen-led approaches to resilience-building.

Type-in traffic is a form of direct navigation. Example: If you are interested in widgets, then instead of performing a search-engine search for the term 'widgets' you might type 'widgets.com' or 'widgets.mobi' in your mobile browser address bar to see if such a web site exists, and, if so, what content is there. From another perspective, if you are in the business of selling widgets, then owning the domain name 'widgets.com' or 'widgets.mobi' and having an active website at that address would be a desirable thing, as you could take advantage of the type-in traffic this name receives. This simple example holds true for virtually all products and services. History Prior to 2002 most web browsers resolved type-in search strings via DNS to the .com top-level domain; thus entering 'mysearchterm' in the web browser's address bar would typically lead the user to . This behavior changed as browsers evolved based on the 'default search engine' setting in the web browser's properties. Thus entering 'mysearchterm' in the address bar would now lead to an error page, as the computer is looking or to results from a search engine if a default is set. Much of Microsoft's Bing (formerly as MSN then Windows Live Search) high usage rank results from the error page traffic delivered via their dominant Internet Explorer browser. A significant percentage of Google's traffic originates from redirects via the Firefox and Google Chrome browsers and from the Google toolbar, all of which take over type-in traffic search strings to the browser address bar. In the last few years advertisers, publishers and ad networks such as MSN, AOL, Google and Yahoo have awoken to the power of displaying relevant advertising to highly targeted type-in traffic from domain names, browser address bar searches and error traffic. * In November 2004 Marchex acquired the generic domain name portfolio of Name Development Ltd., a little-known British Virgin Islands company, for 164 million dollars, predominantly for its 100,000+ domain name portfolio generating 17 million type-in traffic visitors each month. * In 2005, Highland Capital and Summit Partners, two venture capital firms, acquired a controlling interest in BuyDomains, paying an undisclosed sum for its domain name portfolio. * In August 2005, industry trade journals such as dnjournal, dnforum and domainstate reported that sale volumes and prices of existing generic domain-names were rising rapidly as a result of type-in traffic monetization opportunities. Small webmasters can buy a domain name with type-in traffic and utilize Google's AdSense product, or any of several traffic aggregators to display relevant advertising to the trickle of visitors coming to their domain names. Many small publishers are generating thousands of dollars each month in revenue with very little effort by building websites that serve relevant advertising to their type-in traffic visitors. * In April 2006 DemandMedia.com purchased the domain name registrar eNom as a tool for acquiring type-in traffic and for a portfolio of thousands of type-in traffic domain names. In July 2006 Demand Media purchased Bulkregister.com, another top ten ICANN accredited registrar. * In May 2006 iREIT acquired Netster.com, predominantly for the thousands of generic type-in domain name names contained within the broader Netster domain name portfolio. * Google's entry into the small publisher monetization space came as a result of their purchase of Applied Semantics (oingo.com) in 2003. The drop registrar phenomenon is directly related to the value and desirability of type-in traffic domain names. * Type-in traffic does not differentiate between trademark traffic and generic traffic as it relates to domain names. For example, the act of registering for one's own commercial gain would be considered cybersquatting. However, the act of registering or would likely be a defensible acquisition of a generic domain name for type-in traffic generation or resale business opportunities. Many companies have begun to actually buy backlinks from type- in traffic sites in an effort to capture more unique visitors from reasonably targeted networks.

Early Life Born in Cambridgeshire, England in 1872, Mitchell arrived in Calgary in 1891. He had a job with a dry goods business then later with the lumber firm of W. Stuart and Company. Mitchell would marry Kathleen Lang in June 1913. Political Career In 1905, Mitchell was elected to Calgary City Council as an Alderman representing the original Ward 3, and was subsequently reelected for four more terms. As an alderman, Mitchell spent time as Chairman of both the Fire and Finance Committees. Mitchell was elected mayor in the December 1910 Calgary Municipal election and held office from January 2, 1911 to January 2, 1913. In June 1911, during this time construction of Calgary City Hall would be completed and opened by Mitchell and then leader of the opposition Robert Borden. As mayor, Mitchell would host the Governor General of Canada Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, and Princess Patricia. Mitchell would also be the president of the Alberta Urban Municipalities Association in 1911-1912. During his time as Mayor, Mitchell led the city in skating a mineral claim on oil and gas resources in an attempt to provide a new source of revenue. Mitchell supervised a dig on June 12, 1911 which successfully located natural gas, however the city was late in submitting the claim and instead homesteader Michael Stoos would file the claim, which would become the famed Dingman Discovery Well in May 1914. Mitchell again became Alderman in 1915, however he would resign on November 22, 1915 to enlist as a member of the 82nd Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force for active overseas service during the First World War.

Award The award is a small silver-colored pin-on badge with the Sea Scout emblem (the Boy Scout universal badge over an anchor) superimposed on a trident and surrounded by a laurel wreath. The silver trident within a circle of blue olive leaves is the ancient symbol of Neptune's leadership over his dominions of the sea combined within a circle of friendship. The three prongs of the trident are symbolic of the three purposes of the BSA‚Äî citizenship, character and fitness development. The trident also symbolizes that the Seabadge recipient is a spearhead of Sea Scouts in attaining the program objectives of the Boy Scouts of America. Those who completed the course prior to 2012 were issued a corresponding cloth sew- on square knot insignia, a sea-blue trident on a silver gray background, on the BSA uniform. The Seabadge knot was one of the few that do not actually use a representation of a square knot. Unofficial knot emblems are still worn by many recipients. These have a contrasting background of tan, green, white, or navy blue to match the uniform shirt. Unofficial emblems featuring two or three tridents to indicate staff and course directors are also available. Origins In 1970, a group of experienced Sea Scout leaders met at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterrey, California. Their goal was to come up with an advanced management training experience for Sea Scout leaders. A curriculum was devised and the first Seabadge conference was held later that year at the U.S. Coast Guard training facility on Governor's Island, Alameda, California. A subsequent conference was held at U.S. Coast Guard Station, Los Angeles, California, and then spread all over the United States. The national committee on Sea Scouts saw the merit in this program and appointed a special subcommittee to gather the best practices of the courses that had been held. The result was the creation of the Seabadge Conference Guide, which is the definitive outline for delivering the Seabadge conference. Since 1970, the course has been revised several times, with the current course revised in 2002. Course Seabadge is offered by the four BSA Regions each year. It is delivered as a weekend course to those Sea Scout leaders who have completed basic training for Sea Scout leaders. Trained Scouters in other BSA programs can also take the course. The focus of the course is leadership and management for Sea Scout leaders. It is not meant to be a course in seamanship ‚Äî this is covered by the basic leader training courses and seamanship courses offered by the US Coast Guard Auxiliary and United States Power Squadron. Seabadge is awarded after the participant had completed both 1. the weekend classroom program and 2. a set of 5 participant set and advisor approved Sea Scout focused action goals called a 'rutter' 'log' or 'praxis', similar to the 'ticket' in Wood Badge. The second requirement was dropped for a time, but is now again required to complete the course and receive the Seabadge.

She appears in all of the show's nine seasons and is one of the show's three central characters. The character is portrayed by Leah Remini and lives in Rego Park, Queens, with her husband Doug Heffernan (Kevin James), and her father Arthur Spooner (Jerry Stiller). Carrie works as a legal secretary during the first six seasons and as a real estate firm secretary for the last three seasons. Character profile Carrie Heffernan (born in Manhattan on January 19, 1969) is the sharp-tongued wife of Doug Heffernan (Kevin James). Her father, Arthur Spooner (Jerry Stiller), lives in the couple's basement after losing his home in a fire. Carrie was born Simone Spooner but when she was a child, Arthur lost her name in a poker game which necessitated a switch of name with her cousin Carrie. Carrie's mother Sophia insisted on having \\"mother to Simone\\" engraved on her tombstone. Carrie originally had a sister (or probably, and more specifically, a paternal half- sister) named Sara (Lisa Rieffel) who moved in along with Arthur, but after the first season, the character was dropped. Little is known about Carrie's mother Sophia, except that she died when Carrie was 15, leaving Carrie in a state of confusion. Although it was later stated her birthday was July 16th, 1971, in Season 1 Episode 15 titled \\"Crappy Birthday\\" which aired February 1st, 1999, it is stated her birthday is \\"this Friday the 19th\\" and February 19th, 1999 did land on a Friday. Also in this episode it is snowing during her birthday dinner, making it nearly impossible to be in July in New York City. After difficult teenage years, Carrie met her future husband Doug Heffernan at a bar where she originally meant to spend the night with Doug's friend Richie Ianucci (Larry Romano) but ended up with Doug instead. Carrie's best friend is Kelly Palmer (Merrin Dungey), the wife of Doug's best friend Deacon Palmer (Victor Williams). At the end of the series, the couple decide to adopt after struggling to conceive a child, having miscarried earlier in the series. In the series finale \\"China Syndrome\\", Doug and Carrie decide to split up but eventually reunite after adopting a Chinese baby girl. The same day, Carrie discovers she is pregnant.China Syndrome, Parts 1 and 2: The King of Queens (TV series 1998‚Äì2007) at IMDb Carrie is a fierce person, even physically abusive, and is frequently deemed as scary by other characters, particularly by Doug and the family dog walker Holly (Nicole Sullivan). She is a paralegal and works at a variety of firms throughout the show before leaving to pursue a similar line of work at a real estate company. Carrie was accepted to Florida State University but her father never told her. She starts to resent him when she found out but when she thought he died after having a heart surgery her heart melted. Although she is a compassionate person who does have guilt, she can be selfish. In the episode \\"Ice Cubed\\", Carrie tries to make things right with an employee at a store after she accidentally gives her a free iPod and gets fired. However, in a later episode, she takes advantage to become friends with Doug's ex-girlfriend who he mistreated by tricking her into sleeping with him. She uses his ex-girlfriend (Janeane Garofalo) to get a 40% discount on one of her favorite stores, Saks.  Development and impact  The character of Carrie was created by David Litt and Michael J. Weithorn. The show was originally created around the character of Doug Heffernan after Kevin James' successful guest appearances on popular sitcom Everybody Loves Raymond. The King of Queens was partly inspired by the classic television sitcom The Honeymooners. Carrie Heffernan is based on the character of Alice Kramden, with similar mannerisms and deadpan expressions. The role was almost accepted by Megan Mullally who turned it down at the last minute to take a role in Will & Grace.The King of Queens (1998) \\"Did You Know?\\" at IMDb When Remini's short lived TV series Fired Up was cancelled in February 1998 she was subsequently offered the role of Carrie due to her promising comedic performance. Carrie Heffernan is a popular character in sitcom history. Examiner.com named her the 9th most memorable television wife.

Hosting 174 rooms, it also had such features as formal gardens with a fountain, a ballroom and 400-seat dining room. It was torn down in 1972 to make room for a new main United States Post Office and Distribution facility with a much smaller station for Amtrak service between the new Post Office and the railroad tracks. History and design The Queen City Hotel was located on Park and E. Harrison Street. The hotel was built only a year after the B&O; completed its rail connection to Pittsburgh. This placed Cumberland at a major junction of the route northwest to Pittsburgh and the B&O; main line west of the Ohio River. The building was designed by Thomas N. Heskett of the B&O; Road Department in the Italianate style, and the construction cost was over $350,000. The hotel served as a summer resort, although the railroad did not actively promote it as a tourist destination. Located in a valley surrounded by mountains, it provided an escape from the summer heat. The year the hotel was finished, the B&O; expanded its resort business by constructing the Deer Park Hotel in Garrett County, Maryland. (The latter hotel closed in 1929 and was later destroyed by fire.) The B&O; completed construction of a new, expanded passenger station component in 1912. The station occupied three floors and included offices for the railroad company. Decline and attempt at preservation As with other railroads, passenger traffic on the B&O; line declined in the mid-20th century. Interest in and occupancy of the hotel also declined. The hotel closed to the public in December 1964. Following a fire in 1969, the building was inspected by the city and declared to be a hazard. The B&O; made plans to demolish the hotel, and supporters of historic preservation attempted court action to save the building. These efforts were unsuccessful and the B&O; began demolition of the building in 1971. The effort to preserve this ornate, Victorian-era structure was one of the classic preservation battles of the early 1970s. It was one of the last remaining railroad hotels in the U.S. The battle was lost when the building was demolished. The hotel site is now occupied by the Cumberland Post Office.

Halimah and her husband were from the tribe of Sa'd b. Bakr, a subdivision of Hawazin (a large North Arabian tribe or group of tribes). Relationship with Muhammad Aminah bint Wahb, the mother of Muhammad, was waiting for the arrival of the Banu Sa'd; the women within the tribe of the Banu Sa'd were wet nurses. They would take the children of Mecca to the desert and teach them classical Arabic and other skills; in return, they would receive a salary from the family of the child in Mecca. Halimah's husband was al-Harith bin Abdul Uzza. Her son was named Abdullah, while the daughters were named Unaysa and Hudhafa. While traveling to Mecca, she was unable to feed her child because her she-camel stopped lactating. In Mecca, all those looking for foster children rejected taking care of the orphan Muhammad because they feared not getting paid on account of his father being dead. Halimah felt sad that every woman in her tribe had received a child except her. So she told her husband al-Harith: \\"By God, I do not like the idea of returning with my friends without a suckling; I will go and take that orphan.\\" Her husband agreed. Immediately after accepting him, blessing came to her and her family. Her husband's flock during a time of great famine was healthy and producing milk while the rest of the people's flocks were dying. When he was two years old, Halimah took him to Aminah and insisted that she let him remain with her, to which she relented. A strange and mysterious event happened a few months later. Muhammad's foster brother was playing with him, then suddenly Halimah and her husband saw their son (Muhammad's foster brother) who came running back and shouted: \\"two men dressed in white grabbed my brother and cut his chest.\\" So then Halimah and Al-Harith ran to Muhammad and found him pale- faced. When they asked him what happened, he said: \\"Two men came and opened my chest and took a portion of it\\". After this event, she gave up fostering him and informed his mother about what had happened. She later accepted Islam after the Battle of Hunayn. Death She died in 9 A.H. and her grave lies in Jannatul Baqi, Medina. The remains of the place she used to live in and where Muhammad grew up still stand today.

As a point guard, Williams was drafted out of the University of Illinois with the 25th overall pick in the 2002 NBA draft by the Denver Nuggets. In 2004, Williams was named to the University of Illinois All-Century Team. High school career Williams attended Manual High School in Peoria, Illinois, where he was a member of one of the most heralded teams in the nation. Williams led Peoria Manual to the final two of four consecutive IHSA class AA boys state basketball tournaments, in 1996 as a sophomore and again in 1997 as a junior. In both tournaments, Williams was named to the five-player All-Tournament team. As a senior, Williams was named the 1998 Illinois Mr. Basketball. College career After high school, Williams attended the University of Illinois, and played three seasons for the Fighting Illini under head coach Bill Self, leading the team to a string of NCAA Tournament appearances. After the 2000-2001 season, Williams was named the Big Ten player of the year, and received the Chicago Tribune Silver Basketball award. While at Illinois, Williams was re-united with high school teammates Marcus Griffin and Sergio McClain, (a.k.a. \\"The Peoria 3\\") where they earned a number one seed and eventually went to the Elite 8 in 2001. Williams' high school coach, Wayne McClain (Sergio's father) also was named assistant coach for the Illini during his time there. He was elected to the \\"Illini Men's Basketball All-Century Team\\" in 2004. In 2007, Williams was voted one of the \\"100 Legends of the IHSA Boys Basketball Tournament,\\" recognizing his superior performance in his appearance in the tournament.IHSA 100 Legends of Boys Basketball Professional career The New York Knicks acquired Williams in a draft-day trade in 2002 from the Denver Nuggets. He played sparingly in his first season, but found a bit more time on the court during the first half of the 2003-04 season. Unfortunately, new GM Isiah Thomas then traded for star point guard Stephon Marbury, and Williams was relegated back to the end of the bench. The Chicago Bulls acquired him as part of a multi-player trade in the next off-season, where Williams was popular due to his time with the Illini, and expected him to compete with Kirk Hinrich for the starting point guard job, but he showed up to training camp out of shape and spent most of the 2004-05 season on injured reserve. Dissatisfied with his effort, Chicago announced that he would not be re-signed for the next season. Williams signed with the Los Angeles Clippers on October 1, 2005 but was released four days later. Personal On June 10, 2009, Williams and his younger brother, Aaron, were arrested on drug charges at his Peoria, Illinois home after agents seized 55 grams of marijuana. Frank Williams was charged with unlawful possession of marijuana and unlawful possession of marijuana with intent to deliver, and accepted a plea deal of a misdemeanor marijuana possession charge and a $1,000 fine.

His junior year was his best, as he averaged 16.2 points and 10 rebounds while leading his team to the inaugural Big Ten Tournament championship and second round of the NCAA Tournament as a three seed. Traylor was one of the former Michigan players whose ties to booster Ed Martin roiled the program. During his freshman year, Traylor broke his arm in a car accident while out with teammates and recruiting prospect Mateen Cleaves (who ended up going to rival Michigan State). That accident triggered a six-year investigation into the Wolverine program. Martin, who died in 2003 at 69, pleaded guilty in 2002 to conspiracy to launder money and told federal prosecutors he took gambling money, combined it with other funds and lent $616,000 to Traylor, Chris Webber and two other Wolverine players dating to when they were still in high school.ESPN.com: \\"Traylor pleads guilty to tax fraud.\\" Retrieved March 15, 2007. Traylor received three years' probation for tax fraud. Due to NCAA violations connected to the case (principally the compromising of the amateur status of Traylor, Webber and Taylor), Michigan withdrew from consideration for the 2003 NCAA tournament, lost scholarships and was placed on probation. The school also vacated the records of every game in which Traylor played from its record book. Traylor also had to surrender his MVP award for the 1997 NIT, as well as his MVP award from the 1998 Big Ten tournament.

He played power forward and center positions. Originally from Detroit, Taylor played college basketball at Michigan and was selected by the Los Angeles Clippers as the 14th overall pick in the 1997 NBA draft. Taylor played from 1997 to 2007 in the NBA for the Clippers, Houston Rockets, New York Knicks, and Sacramento Kings. From 2009 to 2011, Taylor played internationally in Italy and China. College career Taylor attended the University of Michigan. The athletic forward, from Henry Ford High School in Detroit, burst onto the national scene during the 1994 Maui Invitational with fellow freshman Maceo Baston. He won Big Ten Freshman of the Year for the 1994‚Äì1995 season, averaging 12.4 points and 5.1 rebounds and playing in the NCAA Tournament. As a sophomore, he averaged 14 points and 7 rebounds and was picked 2nd Team All-Big Ten. Off the court that year, Taylor was involved in a traffic accident while out with potential recruit Mateen Cleaves that left teammate Robert Traylor with a broken arm and that led to the University of Michigan basketball scandal. After considering entering the NBA draft, Taylor returned to help lead a talented (if underachieving) Michigan team to the 1997 NIT Championship while averaging 12.3 points and 6.2 rebounds. Professional career =NBA= In 1997, he was drafted 14th overall by the Los Angeles Clippers. In 2000, Taylor told the Clippers he would not re-sign with them in free agency or accept any sign-and-trade situations. When he became a free agent, Taylor announced his intention of hoping to sign with the Orlando Magic to join newly acquired players Grant Hill and Tracy McGrady. No contract offer from Orlando ever came. He then signed with the Houston Rockets instead. He was then traded to the New York Knicks in 2005, before joining the Sacramento Kings in 2006.

The series features the two companies' teams of superheroes, DC Comics' Justice League of America and Marvel's Avengers. Publication history In 1979, DC and Marvel agreed to co-publish a crossover series involving the two teams, to be written by Gerry Conway and drawn by George P√©rez. The plot of the original crossover was a time travel story involving Marvel's Kang the Conqueror and DC's Lord of Time. Writer/editor Roy Thomas was hired to script the book, based on Conway's plot,P√©rez interview, David Anthony Kraft's Comics Interview #6 (Fictioneer, Aug. 1983). and although work had begun on the series in 1981 (P√©rez had penciled 21 pages by mid-1983) and it was scheduled for publication in May 1983,Giordano, Dick. \\"Meanwhile...\\" DC comics cover-dated April 1983. editorial disputes ‚Äì reportedly instigated by Marvel Editor-In-Chief Jim Shooter ‚Äì prevented the story from being completed.Marv Wolfman interview, Amazing Heroes #50 (Fantagraphics, July 1984).O'Neill, Patrick Daniel. \\"Career Moves\\" (P√©rez interview), Wizard Magazine #35 (July 1994). The failure of the JLA/Avengers book's publication also caused the cancellation of a planned sequel to the 1982 crossover issue The Uncanny X-Men and The New Teen Titans crossover. An agreement was reached between the two companies in 2002, with a new story to be written by Kurt Busiek and drawn by George P√©rez. In a joint panel at WonderCon 2000, Busiek (then writer of the Avengers title) and Mark Waid (the then-writer of the JLA title) stated they had nearly come to an agreement to begin the crossover within the regular issues of the respective titles, but the two companies could not come to a business arrangement. When the series was approved, however, Waid was unavailable due to an exclusive commitment with the company CrossGen, and Busiek became the sole writer on the project.McKiernan, Jay. \\"A Sit Down with Kurt Busiek,\\" ComiXtreme (July 25, 2003). P√©rez also had an exclusive commitment with CrossGen, but had a clause written into his contract allowing him to do the series if and when it was approved. JLA/Avengers is in canon for both companies, the cosmic egg appearing in DC's Trinity and the crossover itself described in Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe. The series was reprinted by DC Comics in 2004 as a two-volume collector's edition hardcover (which included for the first time the original 1983 P√©rez-penciled pages), and then re-released as a trade paperback in November 2008. As of 2020, it is the most recent crossover between DC and Marvel. Plot Krona, an exiled Oan, travels across the Multiverse and destroys universes seeking the truth of creation. When he arrives in the Marvel Universe, the Grandmaster‚Äîwanting to save his universe‚Äîproposes that they play a game. If Krona wins, the Grandmaster will lead him to Galactus, a being in that universe who has witnessed creation. If he loses, Krona has to spare the Grandmaster‚Äôs universe. Before choosing the players to participate in this game, Krona demands to swap champions, so the Avengers (the Grandmaster‚Äôs longtime adversaries) will represent Krona while and the Justice League (from Krona's home universe) will fight for the Grandmaster. This means that the Avengers must lose the game in order to save their universe. The Grandmaster informs the Justice League that to save their universe, they have to gather 12 items of power‚Äîsix from each universe‚Äîwhile his ally Metron tells the Avengers that they have to do the same to prevent their world from being destroyed. The six items from the DC Universe are the Spear of Destiny; the Book of Eternity; the Orb of Ra; the Medusa Mask; the Bell, Jar and Wheel of the Demons Three; and the Green Lantern Power Battery of Kyle Rayner. The six items from the Marvel Universe are the Ultimate Nullifier; the Evil Eye of Avalon; the Wand of Watoomb; the Casket of Ancient Winters; the Cosmic Cube; and the Infinity Gauntlet. The Justice League travels to the Marvel Universe and are dismayed (especially Superman) by the Avengers' failure to improve their Earth's condition; for instance, the Flash (Wally West) encounters a non-human-looking mutant running away from an anti- mutant mob and the Flash protects him from the mob. Convinced that the Flash is a member of Magneto's Acolytes, the mob attacks him as well. The Flash also discovers that the Speed Force (the source of his powers) does not exist in this universe. When the Avengers visit the DC Universe, they are surprised by the \\"futuristic\\" architecture of its Earth's cities and the honors that the Justice League and other native heroes receive for their deeds. As a result, they (mainly Captain America) become convinced that the Justice League are fascists who demand that civilians hero-worship them. Various Justice League and Avengers members travel across the two universes and fight each other to retrieve the artifacts of power. A final battle for the Cosmic Cube takes place in the Marvel Universe‚Äôs Savage Land. After a climactic, back-and-forth battle, Quicksilver claims the Cosmic Cube. At that moment, Krona and the Grandmaster arrive on the scene, with the latter observing and commenting that the score is even at 6‚Äì6. However, Batman and Captain America‚Äîwho together investigated the cause of the contest and discovered its true nature and stakes‚Äîarrive. Captain America purposely throws his shield and knocks the Cube from Quicksilver's hands, allowing Batman to catch it. With Captain America's forfeiture of the Cosmic Cube, the Grandmaster now announces the Justice League as the victors, with the final score now being 7‚Äì5. However, Krona is unwilling to accept defeat, and attacks the Grandmaster, forcing the identity of Galactus from him. He then summons Galactus and tries to extract information about the origin of the universe. The Grandmaster uses the power of the artifacts and merges both universes together before Krona can tear Galactus apart. Reality is altered such that the Justice League and the Avengers are now longtime allies, regularly traveling between worlds to fight various threats. In addition, long-dead JLA members the Flash (Barry Allen) and Green Lantern (Hal Jordan) have reappeared. But the universes are incompatible with one another and begin destroying themselves and each other, with people switching between worlds. One side effect of this is that Superman and Captain America become paranoid, irritable, and short-tempered; their emotions flare to the point where they blame each other for everything that is happening (this is later explained as both heroes being too strongly synchronized to their native universes). The appearance of a spectral Krona helps the heroes remember some of the contest and they find out what is happening to their worlds. The Phantom Stranger appears to lead the heroes to the Grandmaster. Weakened by Krona's attack, the Grandmaster explains how he brought the universes together to imprison Krona using the 12 items, but Krona is merging the universes further in order to destroy them, hoping to create a new Big Bang, which he can survive and finally learn its mysteries. Before dying, the Grandmaster asks the assembled heroes to stop Krona and restore order. At Captain America's insistence, he reveals various events that had taken place in the separate universes to show the heroes what sorts of worlds they are fighting for. Each team member witnesses the tragedies that had befallen them in their separate universes, such as the death of Barry Allen, Hal Jordan's descent into evil, and the loss of the Vision and the Scarlet Witch's children. Some of the heroes contemplate leaving the universes as they are to prevent the tragedies from happening, but Hal Jordan inspires everyone to work for the good of their worlds. Krona has trapped the universal avatars of Eternity and Kismet as reality continues to change. He has discovered that a sentience exists in universes and intends to force their spirits out, giving him their secrets. Both teams of heroes reconcile their differences with one another and make plans to stop Krona. Invading Krona's inter-dimensional base, Captain America leads every hero who has ever been a member of the Justice League or the Avengers. Chronal chaos at the base causes an ever-shifting roster of heroes to confront every villain whom the teams have ever fought with the villains having been mentally enthralled by Krona. Even though the chaos and the sheer forces against them (both from Krona and the summoned villains) cause the heroes to fall one by one along the way, Krona is ultimately defeated when the Flash distracts him long enough for Hawkeye to shoot an explosive arrow into the machine he used to keep both worlds merged, after which the Flash takes the items of power‚Äîboth heroes having been earlier presumed dead in battle. Krona is then sucked into the forming vortex. The Earths are separated with help from the Spectre (who at this time is Hal Jordan, now restored to his current state) and the universes are returned to their normal states. As the heroes from both universes return to their proper places, they affirm that whether they do too little or too much, they are still heroes who will always fight the good fight. Krona has imploded to form a cosmic egg, which is stored in the JLA Watchtower;JLA (vol. 3) #108-114 (Jan. - July 2005) Metron states that when the egg hatches, Krona will learn the secrets of its universe's creation by being part of it. Metron and the newly-resurrected Grandmaster discuss how Metron intentionally lured Krona to the Marvel Universe. The Grandmaster says that this is the first game that he has ever played where all sides won (the Grandmaster by way of the battle between the Justice Leaguers and Avengers, the heroes by saving their universes, and Krona by eventually gaining the answers that he sought).

Common House Geckos, mating, ventral view with hemipenis inserted in the cloaca A hemipenis (plural hemipenes) is one of a pair of intromittent organs of male squamates (snakes, lizards and worm lizards). Hemipenes are usually held inverted within the body, and are everted for reproduction via erectile tissue, much like that in the human penis. They come in a variety of shapes, depending on species, with ornamentation, such as spines or hooks. Background The hemipenis is the intromittent organ of squamata, which is the second largest order of vertebrates with over 9000 species distributed around the world. They differ from the intromittent organs of most other amniotes such as mammals, archosaurs and turtles that have a single genital tubercle, as squamates have the paired genitalia remaining separate. Squamate hemipenes also develop from a different cell origin, originating from the same embryonic cells that produce the limbs, whereas mammalian penises arise from the embryonic cells that develop the tail. Evolution Much debate continues regarding the evolutionary origin of hemipenes and its relationship to the intromittent organs of other species. However, embryonic and molecular research is beginning to shed light on the origin of the hemipenis. =Unpaired penis as ancestral form= This theory proposes that the single unpaired penis is the ancestral state for amniotes, and that this trait was retained by most amniotes today. A look at the embryonic underpinning of hemipenes and penises of other animals suggests that there are fundamental differences in their developmental stages, particularly their origin of development relative to the embryonic cloaca. Specifically, the hemipenes of squamata are found to develop on the posterior side, while the paired genitals of non-squamata amniota develop on the anterior side. This developmentally significant difference suggests that the two types of penises could have distinct homologies, and it is thought that this could be attributed to variance of signaling genes during embryological development. =Speciation= Hemipenes are also being used to study speciation among squamata, especially in identifying cryptic diversity and understanding taxonomy at a species level. One study conducted in 2015 investigated anole speciation through hemipenis variation, and found that anole hemipenial morphology evolved six times faster than other non-genital morphological features. Such studies can help researchers understand adaptive radiation and recover phylogenetic relationships, especially between species that are morphologically very similar. Morphology =Identification= Hemipenes on the western diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox) Hemipenes can be examined on a living snake or lizard by gently squeezing on the tail and massaging towards the vent, which is the cloacal opening on the underside of the tail. This will cause the hemipenis to evert out of the body. However, this method can also make it difficult to identify the sex of a non-living specimen if it is damaged or dry. While the presence of hemipenes is an indicator of a specimen being male, its absence should not be immediately inferred as the specimen being female. Juveniles of a species may appear similar in size to mature adults, but possess little-developed hemipenes that might not be easily recognizable. It is also possible to misinterpret the scent gland papillae by the cloaca of the female as a hemipenis, as it can also protrude and be quite large. However, they will be smaller than male hemipenes and have no visible blood vessels, though a red tip may be visible. =Structure and shape variation= Hemipenes can be found in a variety of shapes and sizes, but foundationally, have same general structure. They are made up of two hemipenises tucked under the tail side by side, with each of the lobes exhibiting a range of ornamentation, including spicules and hooks. Hemipenes also have an outer groove called the sulcus spermaticus, which transports sperm through the outside, rather than the inside, of the organ. This is structurally different from the human penis, which has sperm travel inside the organ through the vas deferens and the urethra. The surface of hemipenes is one of the most interesting and unique features, and is often covered in sharp spines and spicules that are organized in formations called rosettes. However, species with relatively smooth hemipene surfaces also exist. For example, the hemipenis of the Siamese spitting cobra (Naja siamensis) is smooth with blunt ends, while that of the many-spotted cat-eyed snake (Boiga multomaculata) is entirely covered in hooked spines and spicules. Yet despite this assortment of hemipenis designs, no association has been found between the design of hemipenes and the disposition or danger of the animal. Rather, it is believed that hemipenes found in the squamate world exhibit such diverse designs to facilitate mating compatibility amongst individuals of the same species, a theory that is referred to as the ‚Äúlock-and-key mechanism‚Äù. Function =Lock-and-key mechanism= The lock-and-key mechanism or hypothesis is the idea that genital morphology has evolved to maintain reproductive isolation between species, by ensuring that mating can only occur between a male and female of the same species. The idea was first postulated in 1844 by French entomologist, Leon Dufour, who observed the diversity of genital morphology among Dipteran flies. It is thought that the physiological differences between species prevent hybridization. The genital lock-and-key mechanism can operate in two ways: by the direct prevention of copulation and insemination due to physical incompatibilities, or by a sensory lock-and-key that induce behavioral responses that disrupt mating attempts. This mechanism is found across the animal kingdom, from Lepidoptera to Squamata. In snakes and lizards, morphological differences in the reproductive organs are believed to exist to help the male copulate with the female. Spikes and hooks are thought to assist the male in fixing the hemipenis in place during mating, and are made specifically compatible to the female of the species. For example, species with branched hemipenes have females with branched cloacas, and species with many spikes have females with thicker cloacal walls, compared to those of species with males having little or no spines. This huge variety among the reproductive organs of squamata is of interest to taxonomists, as it may be able to shed light on evolutionary relationships among reptiles. =Sexual conflict theory= The function of the ornamentation of the hemipenes is still being explored by researchers, but one study supports the theory that the spines that can be found on many hemipenes is a trait to assist in longer, and hence more successful, reproduction for males. Through surgically removing the large basal spine of the red-sided garter snake, researchers found that while males were still able to mate, the duration of mating and the depth of copulation were much shorter than the unaffected control males, indicating that the spines play a crucial role in the male's ability to mate successfully with the female. Females responded to the male hemipenis with strong vaginal contractions that prevented longer mating. To test that the purpose of the contractions was to shorten mating time, researchers anesthetized the female to prevent the contractions and found that mating did indeed last longer. =Cryptic female choice= Oftentimes, females snakes and lizards also have the ability to control whether they get pregnant immediately after mating or not, to account for the fact that the ideal time for mating may not translate to the most optimal time for ovulation and gestation. Consequently, females can store sperm internally for as long as five years, or possibly longer. This phenomenon is known as cryptic female choice, as the physiological mechanisms making this possible are hidden within the body, and the female has the ability to influence when egg fertilization occurs. While the exact mechanism of how the female controls the stored sperm to fertilize her eggs remains unclear, it is believed that the specialized pockets found in the reproductive tract play a key role. As a result, a female can mate with multiple males and choose when to fertilize her eggs. Furthermore, females can also produce offspring that can feature genetic material from multiple males in a single clutch if she mated with more than one male. A product of this system is that males are not guaranteed to successfully reproduce and bear offspring from a single mating. Therefore, it is in their interest to mate with as many females as possible to increase their chance of passing on genetic material. This is one hypothesized reason for males having two penises instead of one: as each hemipenis is associated with one testis and only one side can be used during mating, having a second hemipenis functions as a \\"backup\\" and ensures that mating can continue even if one side were to run out of sperm. It is important to distinguish between cryptic female choice and facultative parthenogenesis, a form of asexual reproduction. Due to the female's ability to get pregnant long after she has been in contact with a male, it is difficult to distinguish between the two in ambiguous cases. In such circumstances, molecular testing techniques can be used to identify whether her offspring share all or some of their genetic make-up with their mother. Hemiclitores Most research in the area of squamata reproductive organs has focused on the male hemipenis, but a recent study has started to investigate the homologous paired structures in females, dubbed \\"hemiclitores\\". Researchers investigated females of Phymaturus and Liolaemus lizards and discovered a structure that was previously undescribed. The hemiclitoris was observed to be smaller than a hemipenis, and the organs were consistently observed in the lizards in the study. While the specific functions are yet to be identified, this study brings attention to a squamata apomorphy that will likely continue to be investigated in detail. Other vertebrates Among vertebrates, penises can be found in a variety of shapes, sizes and structures, such as the lymphatic erection mechanism of ratites and the single vascular erectile body of turtles. One of the most similar organs to the squamata hemipenes, however, is the four-headed penis of echidnas. One of the most primitive mammals in the world, echidnas possess internal testes like squamata and similarly alternate usage of sides. Unlike squamata, however, their singular penis is four-headed. Many marsupials also exhibit bifurcated penises like squamata, suggesting that this feature may have been passed down from a common ancestor. With such diversity among species, reproductive morphology proves to be extremely helpful in not only understanding the mating mechanisms of specific species, but also the broader evolutionary relationships through time.

All that exists today are the earthwork remains of its large motte-and-bailey. Details Rayleigh is one of 48 castles mentioned in the Domesday Survey of 1086 and the only one in the county of Essex. The Survey records that Swein (other spellings are Sweyn, Sweyne, and Suen) built the castle in his manor. He was the son of Robert FitzWimarc, a Norman lord and favourite of Edward the Confessor (r. 1042‚Äì1066). Swein was one of the wealthiest landowners in post-Conquest Essex, and the Survey records that in 1086 his lands were worth ¬£255. As Swein was the son of a favourite of Edward it is likely that he did not arrive with William the Conqueror in 1066, but was instead born in England. Most land owners with significant holdings at the time of the Domesday Survey had disjointed, scattered properties however Swein was one of the exceptions and most of his land was within the hundreds of Rochford and Barstable with Rayleigh Castle as the administrative centre. Adrian Pettifer notes that Rayleigh's plan is similar to that of two other motte-and-bailey castles in Essex: Pleshey and Ongar. On Swein's death the castle passed to his son Robert of Essex (c. 1085 - died before 1159) and thence to his grandson Henry of Essex. Around 1140 the motte was covered in stone rubble. Henry was accused of cowardice in battle in 1163 and subject to a trial by combat which he lost. The castle and its estates were confiscated to become the property of the king, Henry II. Extensive alterations were made to it in 1172 and in 1183-4. The property given by King John to Hubert de Burgh in around 1200 who probably used it as a source of building materials for the castle which he started building in 1230 about away at Hadleigh. On the death of Hubert's son in the latter half of the 13th century, ownership of the castle reverted to the Crown. Documents dating between 1279 and 1303 refer to the motte being used for pasture, which probably means that the castle was no longer used as a fortification. In 1394 King Richard II gave permission for the townspeople of Rayleigh to use the foundations of the castle as a source of stone. Since the foundations are explicitly mentioned in the document giving permission, it is unlikely that any other masonry structures remained by then. The site of the castle was used for grazing sheep after it fell into disuse. Photos taken in the 1920s show the mount free from any large trees or shrubs as the grazing prevented their growth, however since the grazing stopped, large trees have grown on the site. The National Trust who manage the site have no plans to remove the trees for fear of disturbing any potential archaeology below. The Second World War Convoy rescue ship Empire Rest was originally laid down as a Castle class corvette to have been named HMS Rayleigh Castle after the ruins.

This makes a wave flume a well-suited facility to study near-2DV structures, like cross-sections of a breakwater. Also (3D) constructions providing little blockage to the flow may be tested, e.g. measuring wave forces on vertical cylinders with a diameter much less than the flume width.Ocean and Hydraulics Laboratory in KAJIMA Technical research Institute Wave flumes may be used to study the effects of water waves on coastal structures, offshore structures, sediment transport and other transport phenomena.

West Antarctica, or Lesser Antarctica, one of the two major regions of Antarctica, is the part of that continent that lies within the Western Hemisphere, and includes the Antarctic Peninsula. It is separated from East Antarctica by the Transantarctic Mountains and is covered by the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. It lies between the Ross Sea (partly covered by the Ross Ice Shelf), and the Weddell Sea (largely covered by the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf). It may be considered a giant peninsula stretching from the South Pole towards the tip of South America. West Antarctica is largely covered by the Antarctic ice sheet, but there have been signs that climate change is having some effect and that this ice sheet may have started to shrink slightly. The coasts of the Antarctic Peninsula are the only parts of West Antarctica that become (in summer) ice-free. These constitute the Marielandia Antarctic tundra and have the warmest climate in Antarctica. The rocks are clad in mosses and lichens that can cope with the intense cold of winter and the short growing-season. Location and description Geographic map of Antarctica Lying on the Pacific Ocean side of the Transantarctic Mountains, West Antarctica comprises the Antarctic Peninsula (with Graham Land and Palmer Land) and Ellsworth Land, Marie Byrd Land and King Edward VII Land, offshore islands such as Adelaide Island, and ice shelves, notably the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf on the Weddell Sea, and the Ross Ice Shelf on the Ross Sea. West Antarctica was named in the early 20th century Balch, 1902; Nordenski√∂ld, 1905); that usage became standard following the International Geophysical Year (1957‚Äì1958) and explorations which disclosed that the Transantarctic Mountains provide a useful regional border between West Antarctica and East Antarctica. Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) approved the name in 1962. West Antarctica is mostly covered by a massive ice sheet referred to as the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS). In recent decades this ice sheet has shown signs of decreasing mass. The geologic history of West Antarctica was summarized in a 2020 publication. Marielandia Antarctic tundra The parts of West Antarctica not covered with ice (Antarctic oasis), which are the coasts of the Antarctic Peninsula, constitute a biodiversity region known as Marielandia Antarctic tundra (after Marie Byrd Land).

This design puts the focal point at a convenient location behind the primary mirror and the convex secondary adds a telephoto effect creating a much longer focal length in a mechanically short system.Raymond N. Wilson, Reflecting Telescope Optics I: Basic Design Theory and its Historical Development, Springer Science & Business Media - 2013, pages 43-44 In a symmetrical Cassegrain both mirrors are aligned about the optical axis, and the primary mirror usually contains a hole in the centre, thus permitting the light to reach an eyepiece, a camera, or an image sensor. Alternatively, as in many radio telescopes, the final focus may be in front of the primary. In an asymmetrical Cassegrain, the mirror(s) may be tilted to avoid obscuration of the primary or to avoid the need for a hole in the primary mirror (or both). The classic Cassegrain configuration uses a parabolic reflector as the primary while the secondary mirror is hyperbolic. Modern variants may have a hyperbolic primary for increased performance (for example, the Ritchey‚ÄìChr√©tien design); and either or both mirrors may be spherical or elliptical for ease of manufacturing. The Cassegrain reflector is named after a published reflecting telescope design that appeared in the April 25, 1672 Journal des s√ßavans which has been attributed to Laurent Cassegrain.Andr√© Baranne and Fran√ßoise Launay, Cassegrain: a famous unknown of instrumental astronomy, Journal of Optics, 1997, vol. 28, no. 4, pp. 158-172(15) Similar designs using convex secondaries have been found in the Bonaventura Cavalieri's 1632 writings describing burning mirrorsLo specchio ustorio, overo, Trattato delle settioni conicheStargazer, the Life and Times of the Telescope, by Fred Watson, p. 134 and Marin Mersenne's 1636 writings describing telescope designs.Stargazer, p. 115. James Gregory's 1662 attempts to create a reflecting telescope included a Cassegrain configuration, judging by a convex secondary mirror found among his experiments.Stargazer, pp. 123 and 132 The Cassegrain design is also used in catadioptric systems.  Cassegrain designs  Light path in a Cassegrain reflector telescope = \\"Classic\\" Cassegrain telescopes = The \\"classic\\" Cassegrain has a parabolic primary mirror and a hyperbolic secondary mirror that reflects the light back down through a hole in the primary. Folding the optics makes this a compact design. On smaller telescopes, and camera lenses, the secondary is often mounted on an optically flat, optically clear glass plate that closes the telescope tube. This support eliminates the \\"star-shaped\\" diffraction effects caused by a straight-vaned support spider. The closed tube stays clean, and the primary is protected, at the cost of some loss of light-gathering power. It makes use of the special properties of parabolic and hyperbolic reflectors. A concave parabolic reflector will reflect all incoming light rays parallel to its axis of symmetry to a single point, the focus. A convex hyperbolic reflector has two foci and will reflect all light rays directed at one of its two foci towards its other focus. The mirrors in this type of telescope are designed and positioned so that they share one focus and so that the second focus of the hyperbolic mirror will be at the same point at which the image is to be observed, usually just outside the eyepiece. The parabolic mirror reflects parallel light rays entering the telescope to its focus, which is also the focus of the hyperbolic mirror. The hyperbolic mirror then reflects those light rays to its other focus, where the image is observed. In most Cassegrain systems, the secondary mirror blocks a central portion of the aperture. This ring-shaped entrance aperture significantly reduces a portion of the modulation transfer function (MTF) over a range of low spatial frequencies, compared to a full-aperture design such as a refractor or an offset Cassegrain. This MTF notch has the effect of lowering image contrast when imaging broad features. In addition, the support for the secondary (the spider) may introduce diffraction spikes in images. The radii of curvature of the primary and secondary mirrors, respectively, in the classic configuration are :R_1 = -\\\\frac{2DF}{F - B} and :R_2 = -\\\\frac{2DB}{F - B - D} where * F is the effective focal length of the system, * B is the back focal length (the distance from the secondary to the focus), and * D is the distance between the two mirrors. If, instead of B and D, the known quantities are the focal length of the primary mirror, f_1, and the distance to the focus behind the primary mirror, b, then D = f_1(F - b)/(F + f_1) and B = D + b. The conic constant of the primary mirror is that of a parabola, K_1 = -1, and that of the secondary mirror, K_2, is chosen to shift the focus to the desired location: :K_2 = -1 - \\\\alpha - \\\\sqrt{\\\\alpha(\\\\alpha+2)}, where :\\\\alpha = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left[ \\\\frac{4DBM}{(F + BM - DM)(F - B - D)}\\\\right] ^2, and M=(F-B)/D is the secondary magnification. = Ritchey-Chr√©tien = The Ritchey-Chr√©tien is a specialized Cassegrain reflector which has two hyperbolic mirrors (instead of a parabolic primary). It is free of coma and spherical aberration at a flat focal plane, making it well suited for wide field and photographic observations. It was invented by George Willis Ritchey and Henri Chr√©tien in the early 1910s. This design is very common in large professional research telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope, Keck Telescopes and Very Large Telescope(VLT); it is also found in high-grade amateur telescopes. = Dall-Kirkham = The Dall-Kirkham Cassegrain telescope's design was created by Horace Dall in 1928 and took on the name in an article published in Scientific American in 1930 following discussion between amateur astronomer Allan Kirkham and Albert G. Ingalls, the magazine's astronomy editor at the time. It uses a concave elliptical primary mirror and a convex spherical secondary. While this system is easier to polish than a classic Cassegrain or Ritchey-Chretien system, the off-axis coma is significantly worse, so the image degrades quickly off-axis. Because this is less noticeable at longer focal ratios, Dall-Kirkhams are seldom faster than f/15. = Off-axis configurations = An unusual variant of the Cassegrain is the Schiefspiegler telescope (\\"skewed\\" or \\"oblique reflector\\", also known as \\"kutter telescope\\" after its inventor Anton Kutter.telescopemaking.org - The Kutter Schiefspiegler ) which uses tilted mirrors to avoid the secondary mirror casting a shadow on the primary. However, while eliminating diffraction patterns this leads to several other aberrations that must be corrected. Several different off-axis configurations are used for radio antennas. pp. 424-429 Another off-axis, unobstructed design and variant of the cassegrain is the 'Yolo' reflector invented by Arthur Leonard. This design uses a spherical or parabolic primary and a mechanically warped spherical secondary to correct for off-axis induced astigmatism. When set up correctly the yolo can give uncompromising unobstructed views of planetary objects and non-wide field targets, with no lack of contrast or image quality caused by spherical aberration. The lack of obstruction also eliminates the diffraction associated with cassegrain and newtonian reflector astrophotography.  Catadioptric Cassegrains  Catadioptric Cassegrains use two mirrors, often with a spherical primary mirror to reduce cost, combined with refractive corrector element(s) to correct the resulting aberrations. = Schmidt-Cassegrain = The Schmidt-Cassegrain was developed from the wide- field Schmidt camera, although the Cassegrain configuration gives it a much narrower field of view. The first optical element is a Schmidt corrector plate. The plate is figured by placing a vacuum on one side, and grinding the exact correction required to correct the spherical aberration caused by the spherical primary mirror. Schmidt-Cassegrains are popular with amateur astronomers. An early Schmidt-Cassegrain camera was patented in 1946 by artist/architect/physicist Roger Hayward,US Patent 2,403,660, Schmidt- Cassegrain camera with the film holder placed outside the telescope. = Maksutov-Cassegrain = The Maksutov-Cassegrain is a variation of the Maksutov telescope named after the Soviet/Russian optician and astronomer Dmitri Dmitrievich Maksutov. It starts with an optically transparent corrector lens that is a section of a hollow sphere. It has a spherical primary mirror, and a spherical secondary that in this application is usually a mirrored section of the corrector lens. = Argunov-Cassegrain = In the Argunov-Cassegrain telescope all optics are spherical, and the classical Cassegrain secondary mirror is replaced by a sub-aperture corrector consisting of three air spaced lens elements. The element farthest from the primary mirror is a Mangin mirror, in which the element acts as a second surface mirror, having a reflective coating applied to the surface facing the sky. = Klevtsov- Cassegrain = The Klevtsov-Cassegrain, like the Argunov-Cassegrain, uses a sub-aperture corrector. It consisting of a small meniscus lens and Mangin mirror as its \\"secondary mirror\\".New optical systems for small-size telescopes  Cassegrain radio antennas  GDSCC Cassegrain designs are also utilized in satellite telecommunication earth station antennas and radio telescopes, ranging in size from 2.4 metres to 70 metres. The centrally located sub- reflector serves to focus radio frequency signals in a similar fashion to optical telescopes.

Early career Turnbow was born in Union City, Tennessee, and played baseball at Franklin High School, where he compiled a 30-4 record over four years. In his senior year, he posted a Franklin High single-season best 0.77 ERA. The school retired Turnbow's number (20) in 2001, and he is currently the only baseball player to have been awarded that honor. He was drafted in by the Philadelphia Phillies in the 5th round of the Major League Baseball Draft. He was then acquired by the Anaheim Angels in the Rule 5 draft. In October , Turnbow became the first major league player to test positive for a banned steroid. The positive test came during tryouts for USA Baseball's Olympic qualifying team. He did not face sanctions from Major League Baseball, because they did not begin testing for or penalizing steroid use until the season. He was banned for two years from international competition. He got out to a promising start in his career, even representing the Brewers at the 2006 MLB All-Star Game. 2004‚Äì2005 Claimed off waivers by the Milwaukee Brewers following the 2004 season, Turnbow worked with Brewers pitching coach Mike Maddux before the season to help control his fastball, which routinely clocked in at 97-98 mph. Turnbow became the Brewers' closer in April 2005 and finished the 2005 season with 39 saves, matching the team record set previously by Dan Kolb in 2004, and setting personal bests with a 1.74 ERA and 7-1 record in 67.1 innings pitched. Turnbow was rewarded with a three-year $6.5 million contract, which ran through and \\"bought out\\" his first two seasons of arbitration eligibility. Turnbow picked up his first career save on April 24, 2005, at San Francisco. He finished the 2005 season with an ERA of 1.74, the second lowest among National League relievers. He finished second, by just 3 points, behind Washington's Chad Cordero for the 2005 Rolaids Relief Man of the Year Award. 2006 season Before the season, Turnbow signed a three-year contract extension worth a guaranteed $6.5 million. In April , Turnbow made major league history since saves became an official statistic in 1969 by earning a save in each of the first four games of the season. In 2006, he was selected to his first All-Star team. Turnbow struggled with his command through the 2006 season, however, converting only 1 of 5 save opportunities and posting a 21.32 ERA in July 2006, and causing manager Ned Yost to remove Turnbow from the closer role in favor of Francisco Cordero. 2007 & 2008 seasons Turnbow with the Nashville Sounds in May 2008Turnbow struggled throughout much of . In eight relief appearances with Milwaukee in , he accumulated an 0-1 record with one save and a 15.63 ERA (11 earned runs in 6 innings). On May 1, 2008, Turnbow was designated for assignment by the Brewers. He was given the choice of reporting to the minors, being claimed off waivers by another team, or becoming a free agent and thus forfeiting his $3.2 million salary. On May 9, Turnbow was outrighted to the Triple-A Nashville Sounds. He joined the team on May 12. During his short tenure with the Sounds, Turnbow suffered a complete loss of command; in the 18 innings he pitched, he walked 41 batters and threw 10 wild pitches. Turnbow finished the 2008 season without being on any minor league roster due to a slight labrum tear. He was granted free agency during the Brewers' brief playoff run. 2009 season Just after the New Year, Turnbow signed with the Texas Rangers. Texas released him on May 1, 2009. 2010 season On January 29, 2010, Turnbow agreed to a minor league contract with the Florida Marlins with an invite to spring training. After only two appearances in the Grapefruit League, Turnbow injured his shoulder while throwing thus putting his comeback on hold. On March 17, 2010, Turnbow was released by the Florida Marlins and shortly thereafter announced his retirement from baseball.

He was a delegate for Delaware in the Continental Congress of 1783 and 1784, and served as Surgeon General of the United States Army during the War of 1812. Early life James was born in 1745 to Thomas Tilton, a farmer in Kent County, Delaware. After attending the West Nottingham Academy in Cecil County, Maryland, he attended the College of Philadelphia (which was later the University of Pennsylvania). He graduated in 1768 and earned a degree as a Doctor of Medicine in 1771. He started a medical practice at Dover, and also served as an infantry Lieutenant in Dover's Company of the Kent County militia. American Revolutionary War When the Revolutionary War began, his militia became part of the 1st Delaware Regiment of the Continental Army. Colonel John Haslet quickly reassigned him to duty as the regimental surgeon. He served with distinction and saw action at the battles of Brooklyn, White Plains, Trenton, and Princeton. Haslet's unit was virtually destroyed in the Battle of Princeton in January 1777. Colonel Haslet was killed and the command structure was rebuilt. Tilton remained in service with the Continental Army as the head of military hospitals, first at Princeton and later at Trenton, New Jersey and other sites; and when active fighting ended in 1781 he returned to his practice at Dover. tilton drawing of the hospital - originally stated morristown, image modified to reflect it was 7 miles away in basking ridge. A specially designed experimental hospital that Dr. James Tilton constructed and used successfully at Basking Ridge in the winter of 1779-80. The three wards, equipped with bunks, accommodated twelve patients in the central section and eight in each wing. In cold weather a \\"fire was built in the midst of the ward, without any chimney, and the smoke circulating about, passed off through an opening about 4 inches wide in the ridge of the roof.\\" The patients lay with their heads to the wall and their feet turned to the fire. The smoke, Tilton wrote, combatted \\"infection, without giving the least offense to the patient, for it always rose above their heads, before it spread abroad in the ward.\\" Thus, he maintained, he had provided a small, uncrowded, completely ventilated hospital in which patients suffering from fevers could be separated from the wounded. The hospital could hold up to 55 patients. The location of the Basking Ridge hospital - Winter of 1779-1780. Post-Revolutionary War James Tilton Memorial at Wilmington and Brandywine Cemetery As the war was ending, the surviving Delaware officers organized a chapter in the Society of the Cincinnati. Tilton was elected their first president at a meeting in Wilmington on July 4, 1783. He served in that office until 1793. During this time he also moved to a home and farm just outside Wilmington. Delaware named Tilton as a delegate to the Continental Congress three times from 1783 until 1785, although he didn't attend sessions in the last year. He also served several terms in the state's House of Representatives. The War of 1812 caused the U.S. Army to reorganize support and administrative functions in 1813. This included the creation of a position for a Surgeon General of the Army. Dr. Tilton was appointed and served as the first Surgeon General from June 1813 until June 15, 1815. Tilton died in 1822 at his home just outside Wilmington, and is buried in the Wilmington and Brandywine Cemetery. He was a longtime member of the American Philosophical Society and headed the Delaware Medical Society.

Leroy Orange was convicted on the basis of a confession he gave after being tortured in Chicago's Area 2 police station under the direction of Commander Jon Burge. Leroy confessed to a murder after police placed a plastic bag over his head and applied electric shocks to his testicles. Burge was thrown off the force in 1993 for directing the torture of scores of people in custody. Orange eventually confessed to the murders after twelve hours of interrogation and alleged torture at the hands of Chicago Police Lieutenant Jon Burge. At trial, despite Kidd's testimony on the witness stand that he had acted alone, Orange was convicted due in a large part to representation by Earl Washington, a private attorney retained by Orange's family accused of gross incompetence during the trial. After several appeals that were being forestalled on technicalities, the Bluhm Legal Clinic Director Thomas F. Geraghty and clinic students entered the case.

Wilmington Star described the character as having \\"blown away every stereotype the media has placed on cheerleaders\\", while PopMatters referred to her as \\"a walking contradiction.\\" Character development =Casting= Burton was one of the more prominent VJs on MTV for two years, with her looks and other onscreen activities acting as assets. She was the host of her own show, MTV's Hits, helped launch the network's Beach House from the New Jersey shore in May 2002 and was a regular on TRL. Her MTV VJ job allowed her to pursue other media career opportunities, and eventually led to her being cast as Peyton. Burton, who favored acting as a career, auditioned for the part of Ed Harris's daughter in the film Radio. She was encouraged by subsequent callbacks, but did not land the role. The casting department, however, remembered her and asked her to send an audition tape for One Tree Hill, and producers promised her a character that she \\"could sink her teeth into\\" ‚Äì Peyton. \\"[Burton] is an old soul,\\" said Mark Schwahn, the series' creator. \\"She's great. She's always just thrilled to do the job, even though she's kind of new to acting. She's just a joy to be around.\\" Burton said, \\"I've never studied acting or anything because I've been so lucky with MTV. I'm convinced I got the chance to be on One Tree Hill because I did a guest thing on Dawson's Creek as myself, when the cast appeared at the MTV Beach House.\\" She added, \\"And my only scene was with Chad Michael Murray (Lucas Scott). So, now The Chad and I are reunited. How bizarre is that?\\"Burton, 2004, \\"Me, Myself and Murray.\\" With regard to what her life is like as an actress, Burton said, \\"Actors like to think their lives are very difficult, but they're not. Yeah, you're running around a lot. But I used to work in a supermarket and in a bar. That was hard. This is fun.\\" =Personality and wardrobe= Peyton has been described as beautiful, smart, fiercely independent, and as someone who is often a victim on the series. \\"My character is a good girl, but she is also kind of [sexually] suggestive. This is definitely not your mom's drama,\\" said Burton.Burton, 2004, \\"Not your mom's drama.\\" \\"She's very contradictory. Yes, she is a cheerleader, but she also goes home and listens to punk music. She's into really dark art and probably rips the heads off of Barbie dolls. Basically, she's a train wreck.\\" Burton said the character may be \\"a train wreck\\" but that she was \\"so glad [that someone was] putting a girl like her on TV. You don't have to be one thing. Peyton has made that OK\\". Peyton's hair and wardrobe evolution: Her seasons 1 and 2 curly hair, along with vintage clothing style (bottom left), season 3 shorter hair style (top left), season 5 sexier dress style (top right), and season 6 straight hair style (bottom right). Burton said she herself was torn between cheerleading and hobbies which would not necessarily be considered hobbies of a cheerleader while in high school. \\"That's part of the reason I took the show, because I was like, holy cow, this was me in high school.\\" Burton said there are always stereotypes in high school. \\"People get put into groups. \\"You're a jock, you're a cheerleader, you're a freak, you're in the drama department. I had a lot of trouble fitting into those groups when I was in high school because I wanted to be a part of all of them,\\" she said. \\"I think that's how a lot of people are. Some people have the nerve to go ahead and branch out and be a part of everything and some people don't.\\" She said One Tree Hill represents people who are multidimensional and who like more than one thing. \\"People do like more than one thing. It's nice that [One Tree Hill] shows that,\\" she stated. Burton said that portraying a younger age (16 at 21) was not a problem, except for one aspect: \\"My only concern was when I had to put on my cheerleading uniform again. You forget how nerve-racking that is - the vulnerability of wearing bloomers.\\" She said she reread some of her journals from high school to get \\"into that place\\" as a high school student again, and that Peyton being similar to how she was in high school helped. \\"It also helped that the town where we film, Wilmington, isn't too different from the hometown where I grew up in Virginia. Both [are] small towns where high school sports played a big part,\\" she stated. Initially, the character was not well received. She came off as too angry and bitchy to some viewers. \\"At first, the audience rejected her character because, well, she was mean to our hero (Lucas),\\" said Schwann. \\"And she's pretty and popular.\\" Burton stated, \\"She was catching a lot of flack. [People were saying], 'Oh, she's this cheerleader. She's like, you know, this cute little girl. She wants to be all hard and angry.'\\" Schwann decided to soften the character a little, which included having her bond with character Haley James, Lucas's best friend, and she eventually caught on with the audience. \\"[That was] our challenge, because she [was designed as, and became] the moral center of the show,\\" said Schwahn. The character's wardrobe originally encompassed a rocker yet feminine look. She would drive around in a vintage car, listening to loud rock, often wearing a Ramones T-shirt. \\"[Burton] ‚Äì I just love her. Working with her (has) been wonderful. For her, [Peyton's] more of the do-it-yourself girl. She's so into music, art, she's such a rich character that there are a lot of different things to draw on,\\" stated One Tree Hill's costume designer, Carol Cutshall. \\"Sometimes she'll just be in a plaid flannel shirt because she's painting. Some days she'll be in a concert T-shirt. We have to find the right concert T-shirt. I do alter them a lot.\\" Cutshall would take a men's concert T-shirt, and have Burton put it on. \\"She's also very, very slender, so I'll taper them down to her figure. We come out of it with kind of a one-o-f-a-kind rock T-shirt. I take something and then turn it into my own piece of clothing,\\" said Cutshall. Peyton's main brands have been Cheap Monday, Levi's, some Diesel and Miss Sixty. Schwahn eventually began to change the character's styles, especially in season 4 and up. Burton said, \\"Peyton's wardrobe has changed quite a bit, which is nice for me, because I am a... In real-life I am [several years older], and was wearing T-shirts and jeans, and Converse sneakers for five years.\\" She said that after some time, it weighed on her femininity. With the four-year timeline jump, Peyton got to wear more skirts and dresses, and shorter ones. \\"Boobs aren't bigger, but legs are out,\\" said Burton. Schwahn had Peyton's personality complement Lucas's, and described their love story as a soulmate/meant to be one.From the official TheCWSource YouTube channel: Mark Schwahn talks about why Lucas picked who he did, when he knew this was going to happen and what will happen with the other two ladies. Burton explained her character's attraction to Lucas, saying she sees Peyton as questioning a lot about her life, similar to how Murray envisions Lucas, and thinks Peyton often differs from her friends on what is important - much like Murray has said he felt as a child. Artwork Various Peyton artwork. Peyton was further designed as an artist, in order to add more depth to the character and express what she cannot or does not want to say. It also complemented her romance with Lucas, as both are deep thinkers who use their skills to speak to the world. The actual artist of Peyton's works is Helen Ward. \\"Before joining [One Tree Hill], I had already worked as a set designer, storyboard artist and illustrator for a number of films. But I still had to try out for the job,\\" she said. \\"I think they asked a bunch of people to give their shot at a particular drawing. They were pretty specific about what they were looking for. I guess my work was closest. I got the job.\\" Ward said that although Burton is a talented actress and has done a great job with the character, she did not feel she had to get to know her in order to proceed with the drawings. \\"It was the character I was drawing for and I learned what I needed to from the show and the scripts,\\" she stated. In describing the process of drawing for a particular episode, she said she would mostly get input from Robbie Beck, the props master for the show. \\"Schwahn always knew exactly what he wanted and it would be described in the script. So Robbie would send me the info and I would initially do some quick sketches,\\" stated Ward. All of their communication was via e-mail. \\"I wish I could say something more exciting, like [Burton] and I would chat about what Peyton would be drawing,\\" stated Ward, \\"but the only time I ever spoke with her was when they were filming at my house in Wilmington (which oddly enough was Peyton's house on the show.)\\" Despite this, Ward said she did not mention to Burton that she was the artist behind Peyton's artwork. For scenes where Peyton is drawing or painting, Ward stated, \\"...there would likely be very light lines for her to follow. Often I would give a finished version and an unfinished for this purpose. If I remember correctly, it was usually the words that I left undone.\\" Regarding the evolution of Peyton's artwork over the years, she said, \\"I look back at the first season and think the drawings are awful! I certainly became more comfortable working in her style, but I think her style also evolved to fit mine. Does that make sense?\\" Ward clarified, \\"Initially I was trying to do something that just didn't flow well from me. The drawings were too clean. A little forced and not at all the way I liked to work.\\" Ward said that as the show progressed, she began to put more of my own style in them, and became more comfortable and the work got better. In Season 3, the artwork was promoted through the album Friends with Benefit. In Season 6, it is seen in color instead of in black and white, to reflect the character's happiness. Regarding most people not knowing she is the actual artist of the artwork, Ward stated that although people generally do not concern themselves with the workers behind the scenes, she believes this is how things should be, and that she is appreciative of those who have related to her artwork. Storylines =Overview= Peyton's true parentage and other family ties are not discovered until seasons 2, 3, 4, and 6. She is the biological daughter of Ellie Harp and Mick Wolf, and the adoptive daughter of Larry and Anna Sawyer. She is half-sister to Derek Sommers via Mick, and her middle name comes from her biological mother. When Peyton is 8, her adoptive mother (at the time known to her as her birth mother), Anna Sawyer, dies by running a red light on her way to pick her up from school. She soon forges a powerful friendship with Brooke Davis, who comforts her over Anna's death, and they become best friends. As the show begins, Peyton's boyfriend is Nathan Scott. She soon breaks up with him and falls in love with Nathan's rival and half-brother, Lucas Scott. Peyton drives a 1963 Mercury Comet convertible, which becomes a major plot point as it is because of it that she meets and first speaks to Lucas. =Early seasons= During the first season, 16-year-old Peyton Sawyer is girlfriend to popular jock/star basketball player Nathan, but they soon break up when Peyton reasons that their relationship is more about sexual benefits than love, and that she is tired of his cruelty. In addition, she realizes that she no longer wants to be the star basketball player's girlfriend. She has a romantic interest in her ex's brooding half brother, Lucas. Through various interactions with Lucas, she finds that he is kind and thoughtful towards her. However, when he confesses the depths of his need and want for her, she becomes scared and runs from him; Lucas is left heartbroken and desperate. Peyton later goes to visit Lucas and professes that she wants what he wants, but it is too late; Brooke, her best friend, has now become romantically involved with Lucas. Lucas and Peyton eventually cannot resist each other, and become secret lovers (though no sex is involved). On the night that they decide to tell Brooke, Lucas gets into a car accident and subsequently goes into a coma, which brings back painful memories for Peyton because her mother died in a car crash. When Lucas finally comes home from the hospital, he breaks up with Brooke in order to be with Peyton. Peyton soon ends their affair, however, after it is clear that Brooke has found out about the romance and she wants to spare Brooke's pain. Peyton continues to avoid Lucas while Brooke continues to avoid Peyton. Brooke declares her friendship with Peyton to be over. Peyton begins spending more time with Luke's best friend, Haley James, and with Jake Jagielski, along with Jake's daughter, Jenny. Eventually, her friendship with Lucas is slowly reformed, and the two attend a party together at Nathan's apartment. However, at the party, Peyton and Nicki, Jake's ex and Jenny's mother, fight. Peyton realizes Nicki is the girl Lucas hooked up with at a bar, shortly after she dumped him to spare Brooke's pain. Peyton is furious and feels betrayed, along with Brooke. This drives a wedge between Lucas and Peyton, but reconciles the friendship between Peyton and Brooke. The season ends with Peyton spending more time with Jake, and helping him escape from Nicki, who tries to take their daughter from Jake's grasp. Peyton's relationship with Lucas remains broken. In season 2, although she has initial success with getting the all-ages club TRIC opened, and with encouraging Haley to perform at the club, which eventually fuels Haley's desire to be a singer, Peyton begins to get involved with cocaine. She feels alone, as her father is away again, and she does not know where Jake is. She feels down that everyone is dealing with their issues and not helping her or realizing that she is upset and going through a difficult time in her life. She is accused of being a lesbian by Felix Taggaro and faces public humiliation when he writes DYKE on her locker, just so his sister, Anna Taggaro, will not be presumed a lesbian (it is later revealed that Anna is bisexual, but also uses the word gay to assert her sexuality). Hope comes for Peyton, who is in deep despair and about to buy some cocaine, when Jake comes back into her life; it turns out that an argument between Lucas and Peyton made Lucas realize that he had not been there for Peyton, and felt she needed someone else. As a result, he was the one who called Jake, knowing that Jake would have a positive effect on her. This does, and sparks a turnaround for Peyton, and she and Jake fall in love. This happiness is short-lived, as Nicki comes back wanting custody of Jenny. Nicki eventually takes Jenny away from Jake and runs off, causing Jake to run after her, which leaves Peyton alone and heartbroken. Soon, someone named Ellie Harp gets in contact with Peyton saying that she is from Alternative Press magazine and wants to do an interview. When Peyton starts receiving strange e-mails from someone named WATCHMEWATCHU, she begins to suspect that it is Ellie. Ellie, however, denies sending the e-mails and shockingly informs Peyton that she is her mother. The finale ends with a crying, bewildered Peyton on a beach, and Lucas coming to comfort her. \\"Looks like it's just me and you this summer,\\" he says. The two share a meaningful hug. In season 3, Peyton learns that she was adopted, and that Ellie really is her biological mother. Lucas witnesses Ellie purchasing drugs, but he learns that she was buying them for medical reasons; she has breast cancer. Meanwhile, Peyton is angry with Haley because she left Tree Hill to go on tour, but soon they make amends, and Peyton reveals that her hostility toward Haley was because she was the only one that came back out of all the people who have left her. Peyton soon grows close to Ellie, and they collaborate on a CD called Friends with Benefit, which benefits breast cancer research; there will also be a concert for it at TRIC and Haley is one of the performers. Unfortunately, Ellie dies before she sees the CD or the concert, leaving Peyton devastated. A school shooting breaks out later in the season (\\"With Tired Eyes, Tired Minds, Tired Souls, We Slept\\"), where Peyton is left fighting for her life after being hit by a stray round. Lucas and Nathan run inside the building to save Peyton and Haley; Lucas finds Peyton bleeding from a wound in her leg inside the school's library. She cannot walk due to the injury, so escaping is out of the question. Lucas and Peyton stay in hiding, and Lucas wraps her leg, hoping to help the bleeding and pain subside. As Peyton is lapsing in and out of consciousness, he forces her to talk about a fun day she once had. Minutes later, after receiving a promise from Lucas that everything will be okay, Peyton loses hope of surviving, despite Lucas promising to get her out alive; she kisses him, wanting to let him know that she loves him before she dies. Lucas returns the kiss, and Peyton soon falls unconscious. Lucas, desperate to save her, carries her out of the building, even at the risk of being killed by the shooter. Before Ellie died, she left a piece of advice for Peyton regarding Peyton's love life, telling her that it is never too late to pursue her romantic interest. Peyton decides to give love another try and dates Pete Wentz from Fall Out Boy. Their relationship does not work out, since Pete is busy with touring. Peyton's father tells her to follow her heart and listen to it, so Peyton, considering Ellie's advice as well, decides to give Jake a visit in Savannah; she knows that she still loves him and feels that this will be enough for her to be happy. She renews her relationship with Jake and Jenny, and even goes so far as to propose marriage to Jake, who gladly accepts. This happiness fades once Jake overhears Peyton say, \\"I love you, Lucas\\" in her sleep. Peyton is then forced to tell Jake about the kiss she and Lucas shared on the day of the shooting. Jake figures that while Peyton loves him, she also still loves Lucas. He tells her to go back to Tree Hill, and to find out if Lucas is still in her heart. If he is not, Jake promises to still be there waiting. Peyton does as Jake has advised. In the finale, Brooke once again ends her friendship with Peyton after Peyton tells her that she still has romantic feelings for Lucas. Lucas later tells Brooke about the kiss in the library. At the end of the episode, Peyton burns pictures of herself with Brooke. She then picks up a picture of the three of them (herself, Brooke and Lucas) and burns it. In season 4, Peyton discovers that she has a half-brother named Derek. With prompting from Lucas, she agrees to meet with him. However, unknown to Peyton and everyone else, the person she meets is not her half-brother but rather an Internet stalker who is the owner of the WATCHMEWATCHU emails and has been taking pictures of her, listening to her podcast, watching her on her webcam, and even going so far as to get a tattoo of Ellie's drawing of her on his back, and making a prostitute dress like Peyton before they have sex. Unaware of all this, and in an attempt to be more trusting, Peyton accepts him. Lucas, on the other hand, soon grows suspicious of 'Derek' when he catches him sniffing Peyton's hair during a hug and finds Peyton's jacket, which had gone missing, on the beaten prostitute still dressed as Peyton. Peyton soon realizes the truth, and, in a terrifying encounter, is manhandled and nearly raped by Psycho Derek. Lucas and the real Derek come to her rescue, pushing him out a window; by the time the police show up, he has disappeared. This series of events causes Peyton to withdraw from society, becoming scared and even skipping school and getting four locks on her bedroom door. Derek, who is in the Marine Corps and is unwilling to care too deeply due to having watched too many loved ones die, avoids Peyton until Lucas comes and talks to him about her. He and Peyton develop a healthy sibling relationship and he helps her come to terms with her fear, not only of Derek but of confessing her feelings to Lucas. Peyton is unwilling to ruin the friendship that she and Lucas have, especially until she is sure that he and Brooke are over. At Derek's encouragement, she asks Lucas to a banquet to honor Whitey, only to find out he is going with Brooke. Disappointed, she takes Derek instead. Derek tells her that he is being deployed to Iraq. That night, Lucas comes over to Peyton's to tell her that it is finally over between him and Brooke. She immediately confesses that she is in love with him, to which Lucas just says \\"Oh.\\" It is not until after winning the state championship that Lucas realizes that it has always been Peyton he wants. Lucas declares Peyton his girlfriend, but their happiness is short-lived when Lucas has a heart attack that same night and almost dies. Peyton fears she will lose him like she has lost everyone else. However, Lucas \\"comes back to the living\\" for Peyton, and to tell her he loves her. She and Lucas soon decide to just be happy. They decide to make love, for the first time, during a party in the room where Peyton first rejected him, but they are interrupted when Peyton hears everyone cat-calling at what she thinks is a sex tape of her and Nathan. When Lucas and Peyton rush out to put an end to the tape, they, and everyone else, discover that it is in fact, of Nathan and Brooke. Peyton is enraged at Brooke and punches her, giving her a black eye. Later, while at home, Peyton yells at Brooke that she did not ruin their friendship; Brooke ruined it a long time ago. Following this, Peyton decides to skip prom, but gets convinced not to do so by Lucas. As she walks to her door to answer it (thinking it is Lucas), the man behind the door turns around and it is actually her stalker, Psycho Derek. He ties her up and gags her in her basement and proceeds to make a mock prom for them; he takes pictures of the bound and gagged Peyton, dancing with her and telling her they are gonna \\"go upstairs and have the perfect prom night\\". Brooke arrives, knowing that Peyton would never skip prom. Psycho Derek tries to kill Brooke, but Peyton and Brooke eventually overpower him and he ends up in jail. This experience repairs Peyton's and Brooke's friendship. Peyton learns that Psycho Derek's real name is Ian Banks. She forgives him after discovering disturbing facts about his past, and tells him that she hopes he finds peace. Lucas and Peyton eventually have sex together for the first time. After making sure with Lucas, Peyton decides to take an internship in L.A. and thus spends the whole summer with Brooke. =Missing years= One year after season 4, Peyton is surprised by Lucas when he comes to LA to propose to her.

Tracy McLoone of PopMatters stated, \\"Perpetually cranky Peyton tears around town in a vintage car, listening to loud rock, and wearing a Ramones T-shirt, none of which fits with a typical cheerleader image.\\" McLoone added, \\"At one point, Lucas asks her why she's a cheerleader, noting that she's 'the least cheery person I know. She responds, 'You don't know me.' [And in fact], she's right. The girl is a walking contradiction. Peyton embodies aspects of the good girl (cheerleader) and bad girl (rocker).\\" The character's crankiness was eventually toned down, as she was revealed to have a deeper side and her interaction with Lucas and Haley started to win over viewers. The Wilmington Star credits the character with \\"[blowing] away every stereotype\\" the media has placed on cheerleaders: \\"She's‚Äîgasp‚Äîsmart! And interesting! And so not the pop-tart cheerleader TV often delivers,\\" stated Allison Ballard of the newspaper. Her romance with Lucas also became popular. MTV described the two as the generation's Joey and Pacey, \\"the overly dramatic couple you could not help but root for,\\" and the pairing emerged as one of the show's supercouples. Their departure received significant media attention, and was picked as one of the \\"12 most essential episodes\\" of One Tree Hill in 2009 by fans at starnewsonline.com.

It currently works in around 50 countries, with a primary focus on supporting those in poverty and providing disaster relief for disadvantaged communitieshttps://www.tearfund.org/about_us/where_were_working/. Tearfund states that it offers this support regardless of race or religious affiliation. However, they fulfil the work by operating largely through local Christian churches and other Christian partner organisations around the worldhttps://www.tearfund.org/about_us/where_were_working/. History The charity organisation was created by the Evangelical Alliance (EA), which was receiving spontaneous aid from its supportershttps://www.tearfund.org/en/about_us/history/. The money was distributed to support existing aid agencies, before the EA launched an entirely new organisation. Originally named The Evangelical Alliance Relief Fund Committee,this was later abbreviated to the acronym TEAR Fund, before finally changing to Tearfund. The charity was initially headed by former curate, George Hoffman, who was also one of its founders. TEAR fund was launched in 1968 and officially registered as a charity in 1973. In 1972, Tearfund worked overseas for the first time ‚Äì as opposed to funding projects run by existing agencies ‚Äì working in hospitals, clinics, and feeding camps of Bangladesh alongside the charity Interserve. Launch of disaster response work In 1994, Tearfund set up the Disaster Response Unit, later re-named the Disaster Management Team. The first disaster responded to was the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide. Tearfund is a member of the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC), an umbrella group, comprising 13 charities, including Oxfam and Christian Aid. Tearcraft and the fairtrade movement Tearfund began Tearcraft, an early fairtrade venture, in 1974. They imported goods such as coffee, crafts and jewellery from areas where it was working. Most of the items were sold through a network of volunteer church representatives in the UK. Tearcraft‚Äôs work was wound up in 2015, with more and more fairly traded goods available elsewhere. However, the charity Traidcraft, formed in 1979 by Tearcraft founder Richard Adams (businessman), continues very similar work ‚Äì Adams had left Tearfund, unhappy that Tearcraft only worked with evangelical Christian organisations overseas. Adams also went on to found the Fairtrade Foundation in 1989 which has played a central role in bringing fairly traded goods to a wider public. Child sponsorship programme Tearfund began an early child sponsorship programme, ‚ÄòFamily Plan‚Äô in 1974 ‚Äì later renaming it ‚ÄòPartners in Childcare‚Äô. The first children sponsored were Bangladeshi orphans. Tearfund later changed its emphasis from institutional care to supporting children through families and local churches. Tearfund‚Äôs child sponsorship work was wound up in 1999. Micah Network In 1999, Tearfund played a role in the foundation of the Micah Network, which consists of over 750 evangelical organisations worldwide. The network aims to strengthen the work of the member charities, share best practice, and examine the Christian distinctives of their work, . 50th Anniversary Tearfund marked its 50th Anniversary in 2018 with an extensive campaign encouraging financial giving, prayer for an end to extreme poverty and further support for its campaigning work. There have also been a number of events around the UK marking the anniversary, including a service in Coventry Cathedral featuring the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. Sister organisations A number of other international charities have been launched in partnership with Tearfund. These are separate organisations that all have ties with Tearfund itself: Tearfund Ireland, founded 2008. Tearfund (New Zealand), founded 1975. Tear based in the Netherlands, founded 1973. Tearfund Canada (formerly World Relief Canada), founded 1970. Sel based in France, founded 1980. Tear Australia, founded 1971. Tearfund Belgium, founded 1979. TearFund (Switzerland), founded 1984. In 2018 Tearfund announced that it was launching Tearfund USA, with Sonia Patterson, founder of the Impact Wisdom website, the first CEO. Projects working within Tearfund in the UK A number of discrete initiatives currently operate within Tearfund in the UK. These include: Restored: An international Christian Alliance working to end violence against women, with a focus on transforming relationships. Toilet Twinning: Funds the building of latrines and sanitation projects around the world by getting people to twin their toilets in the UK with an overseas latrine. Inspired Individuals: The Tearfund-sponsored programme identifies, nurtures and links up Christian entrepreneurs who are radical changemakers in their communities. Tearfund Learn: An arm of Tearfund that produces a wide range of educational resources for people involved in development work. There are also separate Tearfund offices in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, each initiating nation-specific campaigning and communications as well as coordinating on UK- wide work. Publications Tearfund produces a number of regular and one-off publications, mostly available in both printed and digital formats. Current publications include: Tear Times ‚Äì A magazine sent to supporters three times a year, with news, stories and promotions. Prayer Diary ‚Äì Sent with Tear Times, containing prayer points for every day. Tearfund Learn ‚Äì publish a number of educational resources, include Footsteps, a community development magazine. It is currently translated into five languages and distributed worldwide three times a year. They also regularly produce training materials on topics such as environmental sustainability. Church publications ‚Äì Tearfund sends supporting churches regular resources to coincide with appeals and emergencies. It occasionally produces church and Bible study group resources for Christmas and Easter. It also publishes a number of reports on development-related issues such as sustainability. Advocacy and campaigning Advocacy (influencing government policy and practice) and campaigning are a major part of Tearfund‚Äôs current work. Tearfund first spoke out about climate change as part of the Whose Earth? campaign in 1992, with evangelical organisations Spring Harvest and Youth for Christ. In 1997, Tearfund started a full-scale programme to equip supporters to campaign on poverty issues called ‚ÄòGlobal Action Network‚Äô. Isabel Carter from Tearfund was part of the team that launched the international Jubilee 2000 campaign in 1996. The campaign, which later became the Jubilee Debt Coalition, was based around the biblical idea of Jubilee (Christianity). It called for the debt of the world‚Äôs poorest nations to be cancelled, to mark the forthcoming new millennium. In 2005, Tearfund joined a number of NGOs and other groups for the Make Poverty History campaign. This also focused on global debt as well as fairer trade between rich and developing nations and more, ‚Äòbetter targeted‚Äô, aid. Make Poverty History was dissolved in 2006, although the Jubilee Debt Campaign continues to campaign on a number of related issues. In 2012 Tearfund campaigned with the Publish What You Pay coalition, leading to oil, gas, mining and forestry companies registered within the EU being required to publish payments made to governments anywhere in the world. Tearfund currently campaigns on climate change ‚Äì stressing its role in the creation of global poverty ‚Äì pressing for greater global access to clean energy. They are members of The Climate Coalition (UK), with 130 other charities including Christian Aid and Friends of the Earth. They have extensively promoted the circular economy ‚Äì an economic model based on the re-use of resources and avoidance of unnecessary waste. In 2019 Tearfund launched a 'Rubbish Campaign' which petitioned large companies such as Coca-Cola, Nestl√©, PepsiCo and Unilever to manage their plastic pollution.https://www.tearfund.org/en/2019/05/rubbish_campaign_launch/ High profile supporters and ambassadors Current Tearfund ambassadors include Tamsin Greig and Bear Grylls, along with a number of evangelical Christian leaders including Dr Krish Kandiah and Pete Greighttps://www.tearfund.org/en/about_us/whos_who/tearfund_ambassadors/.

Cordero played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Montreal Expos / Washington Nationals and Seattle Mariners. He currently serves as the bullpen coach for the Billings Mustangs, the Pioneer League rookie affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds. Cordero's best season was in 2005, when he was an All-Star and won the Rolaids Relief Man Award. During the period of 2005‚Äì2007, he recorded 113 saves, second most in the National League behind Trevor Hoffman's 131. Biography =College years= At age 18, Cordero was drafted by the San Diego Padres in the 26th round of the 200 MLB draft, but he chose to enroll at Cal State Fullerton, where he was a standout reliever. With an ERA of under 1.83 he made the 1st team All-America Freshman team and was selected to the Big West All-Conference team, the latter of which he repeated in each of his next two years. In , he was the Fullerton Regional MVP (College World Series), and then was drafted by the Expos in the 1st round (20th overall). =Pro career= First two years Cordero pitched briefly in 2003, and then appeared in 69 games for the Expos in , compiling an ERA of 2.94, usually appearing as a closer. He earned a save in the last Montreal Expo victory in Hiram Bithorn Stadium on July 11, 2004. He also threw the final pitch for the Expos at Olympic Stadium on September 29, 2004 and the final pitch for a win on October 2 against the New York Mets at Shea Stadium. 2005 Chad Cordero in 2007Cordero with the Nationals in 2008 The Expos became the Washington Nationals in 2005, and Cordero had a career-best season. In June 2005, Cordero tied the major league record for saves in one month with 15. He shares the record with Lee Smith and John Wetteland. He also converted his 24th consecutive save, breaking the club record held by Mel Rojas. On September 9, 2005, Cordero's 44th save broke the franchise record. He completed the 2005 season with 47 saves, leading the major leagues, and was selected to the National League pitching staff for the 2005 MLB All-Star game, facing one batter, Iv√°n Rodr√≠guez, and striking him out. He was the 2005 Washington Nationals Player of the Year, and won the National League Rolaids Relief Man of the Year Award. 2006 In February , Cordero and his teammate Brian Schneider were chosen to play for Team USA in the World Baseball Classic. During the season, however, his production tailed off. While he still got 29 saves (8th best in the league), his ERA went from 1.82 to 3.19. 2007 In the beginning of the season, Cordero faced a tough time against batters. By May 6, his ERA was 4.70. Cordero admitted he was distracted by the illness of his ailing grandmother, and missed six games for personal bereavement leave. He came back a changed man, and starting May 16 made 12 consecutive appearances without allowing a run. On June 13, Cordero (at age 25 years and 86 days) became the second youngest player in baseball history to reach 100 saves in a career. (The Tigers' Francisco Rodr√≠guez is the youngest at 24 years and 246 days old.) Echoing his final pitches at Olympic Stadium and Hiram Bithorn Stadium in 2004 Cordero closed out the final Nationals game at RFK stadium getting a save on September 23, 2007. He is likely the only pitcher in major league history to throw the final pitch at three different home stadiums for the same franchise. 2008-2011 Cordero missed almost all of the season after undergoing surgery to repair a labrum tear, an injury he suffered in April. On October 30, 2008 the Nationals sent him outright to AAA Syracuse, and he rejected the assignment, becoming a free agent. Among other reasons for Cordero's rejection was that he was displeased with how he found out that he would be \\"non-tendered\\" by the Nationals at the end of the season‚Äîvia an impromptu comment made by Nationals' GM Jim Bowden on a radio show in July. On March 12, 2009, Cordero signed a minor league contract with the Seattle Mariners with an invitation to spring training. He was to compete for the closer role once he fully recovered from surgery, but was unable to make a minor league appearance until July. He was called up to the Mariners on June 3, 2010, taking the spot of the retired Ken Griffey, Jr. On July 15, 2010 he refused a minor league assignment from the Seattle Mariners and became a free agent. On July 21, 2010 Cordero agreed on a minor league deal with the New York Mets and was assigned to Triple A Buffalo. On January 3, 2011, Cordero signed a minor league contract with an invite to spring training with the Toronto Blue Jays. He was released on May 17.Blue Jays Release Chad Cordero, MLBTradeRumors.com, May 17, 2011. Cordero later signed with the St. Paul Saints of the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball, but retired on June 20, 2011. On February 13, 2013, Cordero signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim due to his desire to play again. He was assigned to the Inland Empire 66ers of the California League, the (high) Class-A affiliate of the Angels, to begin the season. Personal life Cordero has two children: Riley and Tehya. Tehya died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome in 2010. He was married to Jamie Cordero but the couple is now separated.

He was a nobleman and soldier born in Rates, P√≥voa de Varzim. Sousa was born a noble and participated in military expeditions in Africa, fought the Moors and commanded the nau Concei√ß√£o to Portuguese India, part of the armada of Fern√£o de Andrade. Sousa was the first knight commander of the medieval Monastery of Rates, reinstablished in 1100 AD and dissolved in the 16th century. Sousa in Brazil Sousa was the agent in charge of restoring the king's authority in Colonial Brazil. Up until this point, Brazil had been neglected by Portugal, which was putting all of its resources into the spice trade in India. There was a decline in the spice trade and increasing threats around Brazil's borders by the surrounding Spanish colonies, which prompted Portugal to intervene. As part of this mission, Sousa had established his capital city of Salvador at Bahia on the Atlantic coast between S√£o Paulo and Pernambuco. The new capital was supposed to bring together the twelve pre-existing settlements, though Sousa traversed the bordering areas in an effort to promote his idea of justice and to diminish what the Portuguese saw as the lawlessness and chaos of the region. He planned on making the colony a strong military base to protect the Portuguese settlers from Indian or other outside forces. He brought 1,000 colonists and soldiers with him on an expedition to Brazil, including four hundred degredados - \\"men banished from Portugal for some minor criminal activity.\\"Crow, John A. The Epic of Latin America Page 225 Among the colonists were six Jesuits, the first in Brazil, whom he assisted in the christianization of the natives and helped to reaffirm the King's rule over the colonies. He was successful in decreasing the hostilities waged against the colonists by native people, in part through diplomatic avenues but primarily through his use of cruel and often extreme punishment. Return to Portugal In 1552, Sousa suggested that Rio de Janeiro might be a potential area for settlement and in 1553 he returned to Portugal to work with the King, acting as his adviser on Brazilian affairs. Sousa also helped to attract settlers to Brazil by installing municipal organizations, similar to the ones in Portugal, into the cities. He also managed to appoint local officials over the captaincies and strengthened tactical areas around the coast that would be beneficial to the safety of the citizens. Descendants According to the traditions of the de Souza family of West Africa, their founding patriarch - Francisco Felix de Sousa, the Chacha of Ouidah - was a direct descendant of Tom√® de Sousa. He arrived in Dahomey after leaving Brazil, and went on to become an African chieftain after serving as a powerful slave trader and royal advisor. With his harem of black consorts, he had a brace of children whose lineal descendants would go on to be prominent in the region. President Paul- Emile de Souza of Benin and his niece Chantal de Souza Boni Yayi, the first lady to President Boni Yayi of Benin, are arguably the most notable of them. Further reading Crow, John A.

Definition Let C be a category, and let F be a contravariant functor from C to the category of sets Set. A contravariant functor G from C to Set is a subfunctor of F if # For all objects c of C, G(c) ‚äÜ F(c), and # For all arrows f: c‚Ä≤ ‚Üí c of C, G(f) is the restriction of F(f) to G(c). This relation is often written as G ‚äÜ F. For example, let 1 be the category with a single object and a single arrow. A functor F: 1 ‚Üí Set maps the unique object of 1 to some set S and the unique identity arrow of 1 to the identity function 1S on S. A subfunctor G of F maps the unique object of 1 to a subset T of S and maps the unique identity arrow to the identity function 1T on T. Notice that 1T is the restriction of 1S to T. Consequently, subfunctors of F correspond to subsets of S. Remarks Subfunctors in general are like global versions of subsets. For example, if one imagines the objects of some category C to be analogous to the open sets of a topological space, then a contravariant functor from C to the category of sets gives a set-valued presheaf on C, that is, it associates sets to the objects of C in a way that is compatible with the arrows of C. A subfunctor then associates a subset to each set, again in a compatible way. The most important examples of subfunctors are subfunctors of the Hom functor. Let c be an object of the category C, and consider the functor . This functor takes an object c‚Ä≤ of C and gives back all of the morphisms c‚Ä≤ ‚Üí c. A subfunctor of gives back only some of the morphisms. Such a subfunctor is called a sieve, and it is usually used when defining Grothendieck topologies. Open subfunctors Subfunctors are also used in the construction of representable functors on the category of ringed spaces. Let F be a contravariant functor from the category of ringed spaces to the category of sets, and let G ‚äÜ F. Suppose that this inclusion morphism G ‚Üí F is representable by open immersions, i.e., for any representable functor and any morphism , the fibered product is a representable functor and the morphism Y ‚Üí X defined by the Yoneda lemma is an open immersion. Then G is called an open subfunctor of F. If F is covered by representable open subfunctors, then, under certain conditions, it can be shown that F is representable. This is a useful technique for the construction of ringed spaces. It was discovered and exploited heavily by Alexandre Grothendieck, who applied it especially to the case of schemes. For a formal statement and proof, see Grothendieck, √âl√©ments de g√©om√©trie alg√©brique, vol. 1, 2nd ed., chapter 0, section 4.5.

The Glenmore Reservoir, which is one of Calgary's sources of drinking water, is a major cause of traffic problems. The ring road would connect from about the Sarcee Trail‚ÄìGlenmore Trail intersection to Alberta Highway 22X, alleviating traffic congestion in the south. The proposed route of this ring road would cut across the corner of the reserve bordering the reservoir. A source of opposition to the proposed road comes from the environmental community which doesn't want to see major infrastructure built through land considered valuable to a fragile ecosystem. There have been discussions on and off regarding commencement of this project since the early 1990s. The land swap necessary to build the ring road through the reserve was rejected in a referendum by the Nation in 2009, and the City of Calgary announced that alternative plans will put the ring road on municipal and provincial lands only. Negotiations to locate the road on the reserve resumed in 2011, and a new agreement was accepted by the majority of Nation members in a referendum held on October 24, 2013. =Ring road agreement= In October 2013, members of the Tsuu T'ina Nation voted to accept the latest offer from the Province of Alberta in a referendum to exchange 428 acres of nation territory for an expansion 2,160 acres of Crown land.

He is considered a national hero in Hungary.  Early life  Damjanich was born in Staza√ñsterreichisches Biographisches Lexikon 1815‚Äì1950, 168. old. in Croatian Military Frontier (now part of Sunja, Croatia). His mother was a daughter of general Taboroviƒá. His wife Emilija ƒåarniƒá was related to the ƒåarnojeviƒá family.  Military career  Damjanich entered the army as an officer in the 61st regiment, and on the outbreak of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 was promoted to be a major in the 3rd Honv√©d battalion at Szeged. Although an Orthodox Serb, he was from the beginning a devoted adherent of the Hungarian liberals. This cites √ñd√∂n Hamvay, Life of J√°nos Damjanich (Hung.), (Budapest, 1904). His ability and valour at the battles of Alisbrunn (Serbian: Alibunar, Hungarian: Alibun√°r) and Lagerdorf/Temes≈ër in 1848 led to his promotion to colonel. In early 1849, he was appointed commander of the 3rd Army Corps in the middle Tisza, and quickly gained the reputation of being the bravest man in the Hungarian army. In March 1849 he annihilated an Austrian brigade at Szolnok, which was perhaps his greatest exploit. He was elected deputy for Szolnok to the Diet of Hungary, but declined the honour. Damjanich played a leading role in the general advance upon the Hungarian capital of Buda under Art√∫r G√∂rgey. The engagements of Hort and Hatvan, along with the bloody Isaszeg turned Damjanich into a national hero. At the ensuing review at G√∂d√∂ll≈ë, Lajos Kossuth expressed the sentiments of the whole nation when he doffed his hat as Damjanich's battalions passed by. Damjanich uncompromisingly supported the views of Kossuth, and was appointed commander of one of the three divisions which, under G√∂rgey, liberated V√°c in April 1849. His fame reached its height when, on April 19, he won the Battle of Nagysall√≥, which led to the relief of the fortress of Kom√°rom. At this juncture Damjanich broke his leg, an accident which prevented him from taking part in field operations at the most critical period of the war, when the Hungarians had to abandon the capital for the second time. He recovered sufficiently, however, to accept the post of commandant of the fortress of Arad. After the Surrender at Vil√°gos (now ≈ûiria, Romania), Damjanich, on being summoned to surrender, declared he would give up the fortress to a single company of Cossacks, but would defend it to the last drop of his blood against the whole Austrian army. He accordingly surrendered to the Russian general Dmitry Buturlin, by whom he was handed over to the Austrians, and he became one of the 13 Martyrs of Arad on October 6, 1849. Damjanich was last in the line to be executed because his enemies wanted him to watch hanging of his generals. His famous last words were: I believed I would be the last, because I was always the first in battle. My poor Emily! Long live Hungary! Execution of the Martyrs of Arad. Work by J√°nos Thorma. Controversy Damjanich is a controversial historical figure. Hungarians consider Damjanich a national hero who led the Hungarian revolutionary army against the Habsburg Monarchy, while Serbs consider him a national traitor, who despite the fact that he was ethnic Serb by origin, fought on the Hungarian side against his own people, i.e. against the Vojvodinian Serb army that was on the side of the Habsburgs during the revolution. Therefore, the Serbs gave him a nickname \\"ljuta guja, srpski izdajica\\" (\\"furious snake, Serbian traitor\\"). The following quote is accredited to him, > \\"Serbs shouldn't exist; I won't be still until the last Serb on this earth > is dead and once that is done, I shall kill myself.\\" Other sources say that Damjanich was actually proud of his Serb origin.

It was established and started operations in 1996 in San Diego then later moved to Indianapolis in 1998 and to its last location at Rickenbacker International Airport, Columbus. Air Tahoma operated contract cargo flights internationally to the Caribbean, Mexico, Vietnam, Philippines, and the United States. Air Tahoma ceased operations in 2009. History Noel Rude founded the company in 1996, and it was based out of Rickenbacker Airport in Columbus, OH Air Tahoma is a spin-off from Cool Air Inc., which was founded in 1986 by Rude and his father, Bud Rude, who is a veteran of the airline industry and who founded the parent company that originally flew firefighting missions in Washington. FedEx contracted with Air Tahoma to fly to cities without enough traffic to support a larger jet. Air Tahoma operated twin- engine turboprop Convairs (either the 580 or the 240). On 13 August 2004 Flight 185 crashed during approach to landing. Based on the September 1, 2008 FAA's post accident inspection report, on Friday November 7, 2008, Air Tahoma was presented with a list of alleged discrepancies on each of its aircraft. The company voluntarily suspended operations. On Monday November 10, Air Tahoma presented the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) with a 150-page document answering / dismissing every item in the FAA report. Air Tahoma subsequently resumed operations and requested input from the FAA as to any known safety items so that they could be properly addressed. Assigned FAA inspectors told the carrier it was \\"business as usual\\" and their instructions were to continue their daily surveillance as usual. With no new information, the FAA issued an emergency revocation on January 13, 2009 citing many systemic violations of the Federal Aviation Regulations. The Company appealed the revocation. During the appeal process, the FAA revoked all ferry flights to reposition the company's aircraft to its home base and blocked any attempt by the company to place aircraft with other operators. In exchange for dropping its appeal, the FAA allowed the company to move its aircraft home and agreed not to withhold necessary inspectors from other operators trying to lease Air Tahoma aircraft. The Inspector General also conducted an investigation of Air Tahoma and its management personnel. As part of the investigation,OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL - CASE I09A0000270500 two primary FAA officials with detailed knowledge of Air Tahoma stated: ‚ÄúThe First Inspector‚Äù read the FAA Enforcement Investigative Report (EIR) that was done after the fatal accident in September 2008, stated if that went to trial, 95% of the items within the EIR would be unsubstantiated. Several issues documented in the EIR concerned NDT (non-destructive testing), declared that Air Tahoma contracted much of its NDT work to outside companies. ‚ÄúThe Second Inspector‚Äù read the FAA Enforcement Investigative Report (EIR) about Air Tahoma. The EIR mentioned several issues with maintenance aspects and not many issues concerning operational items. stated if the maintenance items in the EIR were addressed individually in court, the items would not stand-up. Additionally, if Air Tahoma had the money to go to court, many aspects of the EIR would not have held-up. did not elaborate on those issues and his opinions. Although, stated agreed with the EIR, it appeared \\"loaded on.\\" did not elaborate At the conclusion, the Special Agent in charge briefed the Assistant United States Attorney (AUSA) about the information obtained and the AUSA declined the case for prosecution. Given that Air Tahoma successfully rebutted every item in the November 7, 2008 list of alleged aircraft discrepancies and given that the FAA's own inspectors believed that the Enforcement Investigative Report against Air Tahoma would not hold up in court, it is easy to conclude why the FAA aggressively pressured Air Tahoma into dropping its appeal of the revocation order.

The crash killed the First Officer Ray Gelwicks and the Captain received minor injuries. NTSB ruled that the crash was due to a dual engine flameout as a result of the Captain being distracted with preflight planning during the flight, Captain didn't follow proper crossfeeding procedures, and Flight Crew didn't monitor the fuel gauges. There was sufficient fuel on board and nothing was wrong with the aircraft systems. *Air Tahoma Flight 587 On September 1, 2008 an Air Tahoma Convair 580 crashed in Pickaway County, Ohio, shortly after taking off from Rickenbacker International Airport, claiming the lives of the 3 crew members. The FAA and NTSB investigated. Rickenbacker International Airport is southeast of Columbus, Ohio. The crash happened around the Noon hour. NTSB Identification: CHI08MA270 14 CFR Part 91: General Aviation Accident occurred Monday, September 1, 2008 in Columbus, OH Probable Cause Approval Date: 6/22/2009 Aircraft: CONVAIR CV-580, registration: N587X Injuries: 3 Fatal. The accident flight was the first flight following maintenance that included flight control cable rigging. The flight was also intended to provide cockpit familiarization for the first officer and the pilot observer, and as a training flight for the first officer. About one minute after takeoff, the first officer contacted the tower and stated that they needed to return to land. The airplane impacted a cornfield about one mile southwest of the approach end of the runway, and 2 minutes 40 seconds after the initiation of the takeoff roll. The cockpit voice recorder (CVR) indicated that, during the flight, neither the captain nor the first officer called for the landing gear to be raised, the flaps to be retracted, or the power levers to be reduced from full power. From the time the first officer called \\"rotate\\" until the impact, the captain repeated the word \\"pull\\" about 27 times. When the observer pilot asked, \\"Come back on the trim?\\" the captain responded, \\"There's nothing anymore on the trim.\\" The inspection of the airplane revealed that the elevator trim cables were rigged improperly, which resulted in the trim cables being reversed. As a result, when the pilot applied nose-up trim, the elevator trim system actually applied nose-down trim. An examination of the maintenance instruction cards used to conduct the last inspection revealed that the inspector's block on numerous checks were not signed off by the Required Inspection Item (RII) inspector. The RII inspector did not sign the item that stated: \\"Connect elevator servo trim tab cables and rig in accordance with Allison Convair [maintenance manual]...‚Äù The item had been signed off by the mechanic, but not by the RII inspector. The card also contained a NOTE, which stated in bold type, \\"A complete inspection of all elevator controls must be accomplished and signed off by an RII qualified inspector and a logbook entry made to this effect.\\" The RII inspector block was not signed off. The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident as follows: The improper (reverse) rigging of the elevator trim cables by company maintenance personnel, and their subsequent failure to discover the misrigging during required post-maintenance checks. Contributing to the accident was the captain's inadequate post-maintenance preflight check and the flight crew's improper response to the trim problem. During the civil cases filed by the pilots‚Äô families, it was discovered that the maintenance work card for the installation of the trim tab and rigging were properly signed by the mechanics and the inspector. The results of this card, were improperly transferred to the control sheet used by the company to track the completion of required checks. This control sheet also required the inspector's initials, it was this control sheet that was missing the required inspector initials. It was also discovered that at least four other incidents of improper (reverse) mis- rigging had occurred with other operators of Convair aircraft, including one case with the now manufacture of the aircraft. The manufacture subsequently issued a Service Bulletin (SB 340-27-001) requiring placards to safeguard against improper (reverse) rigging of the elevator trim cables in the future. The pilots‚Äô families sued the manufacture for improperly notifying Air Tahoma of the known mis-rigging issue with the Convair. The case has now been settled.

Four of the sons of Mosiah, including Ammon, were converted miraculously from rebellious youth into believers.

Ammon served a fourteen-year mission among the Lamanites and converted thousands. These people were ferocious and bloodthirsty, and had murdered and plundered not only the Nephites but their own people. Once converted to the gospel of Jesus Christ they buried their weapons of war and covenanted \\"that they never would use weapons again for the shedding of man‚Äôs blood\\" and \\"rather than shed the blood of their brethren they would give up their own lives\\".. The remaining unconverted Lamanites began to murder them. When Ammon saw this he moved the Ammonites to a Nephite territory called Jershon so they could be protected by the Nephite army. When the people of Ammon saw how the Nephite army suffered in defending them, they considered breaking their oath to lay down their weapons and defend themselves; Helaman persuaded them not to break their oath. Two thousand of their sons (who had been too young at the time to have made the covenant) volunteered to fight for the defense of the Nephites and the Ammonites. The young men asked Helaman, the son of Alma the Younger and a leader of the church among the Nephites, to be their commander. The young stripling warriors fought alongside the Nephite army and were one of the Nephites' most effective military units. Though every soldier was wounded at one time or another, there were no fatalities among the warriors. Helaman attributed this to the upbringing provided by their mothers and the great faith they exhibited.

Karl Fredrik Dahlgren (1791‚Äì1844), Swedish poet At a time when literary partisanship ran high in Sweden, and the writers divided themselves into Goths and Phosphorists, Dahlgren made himself indispensable to the Phosphorists by his polemical activity. In the mock-heroic poem of Markall's somnlosa nutter (Markall's \\"Sleepless Nights\\"), in which the Phosphorists ridiculed the academician Per Adam Wailmark and others, Dahlgren, who was a genuine humorist, took a prominent part. Life He was born at Stensbruk in √ñsterg√∂tland on 20 June 1791. In 1825 he published Babels Torn (\\"The Tower of Babel\\"), a satire, and a comedy, Argus in Olympen; and in 1828 two volumes of poems. In 1829 he was appointed to an ecclesiastical post in Stockholm, which he held until his death. In a series of odes and dithyrambic pieces, entitled Mollberg's EpislJar (1819, 1820), he strove to emulate the wonderful lyric genius of K. M. Bellman, of whom he was a student and follower. From 1825 to 1827 he edited a critical journal entitled Kometen (\\"The Comet\\"), and in company with Alrnqvist he founded the Manhemsforbund, a short-lived society of agricultural socialists. In 1834 he collected his poems in one volume; and in 1837 appeared his last book, Angbts-Sadnger (\\"Steamboat Songs\\"). On 1 May 1844 he died at Stockholm. Dahlgren is one of the best humorous writers that Sweden has produced; but he was perhaps at his best in realistic and idyllic description. His little poem of Zephyr and the Girl, which is to be found in every selection from Swedish poetry, is a good example of his sensuous and ornamented style. His works were collected and published after his death by A. J. Arwidsson (Stockholm, 1847‚Äì1852).

He attended elementary school at Transfiguration of Our Lord Catholic Elementary School and later St. Joseph's Preparatory School in North Philadelphia. He graduated from The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in 1979 with a degree in business. During his sophomore year in college, he started working as a DJ at Club Impulse in Philadelphia, where he was known as Mix Master Mike. After graduating from college, Nutter began to work at Xerox, and then at an investment banking firm. While in office, Mayor Nutter occasionally worked as DJ and a singer. Michael Nutter is a member of the Mt. Carmel Baptist Church in West Philadelphia. Philadelphia City Council =Elections= Nutter, then- leader of the 52nd ward of Philadelphia, initially challenged Democratic incumbent Ann Land for a seat on the Philadelphia City Council in 1987. Though ultimately unsuccessful in his initial bid, Nutter defeated Land in a rematch four years later. His district included Wynnefield, Overbrook, Roxborough, Manayunk, East Falls and parts of North Philadelphia, West Philadelphia, and Mount Airy. In February 2003, Nutter was elected chairman of the Pennsylvania Convention Center Authority Board at the urging of former Senator, Vincent Fumo.v =Tenure= In June 2002, Nutter introduced a measure requiring college students under 23 years old to register their address, license plate, car registration and insurance with their school, which would then put a sticker on that car as a \\"student\\" car, subjecting the student to triple the usual fines for traffic or parking tickets or any other offense. The ordinance also forced students in off-campus housing to inform their landlords of their student status.O'Neill, James M. (September 16, 2002). \\"Students at St. Joseph's University face new law\\". The Philadelphia Inquirer In September 2004, Nutter introduced legislation creating an independent Ethics Board; in addition, he proposed changes to the City's Ethics Code to provide for routine training and education of all City officers and employees, the issuance of advisory opinions, the adjudication of violations, and the imposition of civil fines. These measures were adopted at the end of 2005. On May 16, 2006, voters approved the Ethics Board ballot question with 81% voting to approve it, and was installed November 27, 2006. Nutter sponsored \\"The Clean Indoor Air Worker Protection Law,\\" expanding the definition of \\"public places\\" where smoking is not allowed to include restaurants and many bars, which Mayor Street eventually signed into law.http://www.nutter2007.com/bio.php Nutter's local bidder preference program, which took effect on July 1, 2004, gives preference to Philadelphia businesses in competitive bidding on City contracts greater than $25,000. In January 2005, Philadelphia announced a library reorganization plan in which 20 branches would shift from full-day service to half-day service, and that many head librarians would be laid off. Library supporters rejected these changes and petitioned the Mayor and city council to restore service and staffing levels. The City Council rejected the Administration's cut, funding was restored, and by the fall of 2005 all library branches had full-day service, Saturday hours, and a head librarian. As mayor, Nutter sought to close 11 libraries until city council brought a suit that kept the libraries open. He supported having the City of Philadelphia declare a \\"Crime Emergency\\" in selected areas of Philadelphia.The Nutter Crime Plan This would have stationed more officers in certain areas of Philadelphia, limited the ability to gather on public sidewalks, imposed a curfew for all residents, and limited the ability to travel in certain areas. The proposal included a warrant-less police search technique known as \\"stop-and-frisk.\\" Nutter claims that this approach is sufficiently similar to one that was found to be Constitutional by the United States Supreme Court in 1968 in Terry v. Ohio, but it still has not been determined if this specific exercise is in violation of Fourth Amendment rights.http://www.nutter2007.com/images/uploads/Safety_Now_Latest.pdf A version of this plan was later implemented by Nutter and was the target of a lawsuit. Nutter has supported the eviction of the Cradle of Liberty Council of the Boy Scouts of America from their headquarters on the Ben Franklin Parkway both as a councilman and as mayor.

He defeated two candidates in the general election of November 2011, garnering over 70% of the vote on a voter turnout of around 18%. =Public safety= When Nutter assumed office in 2008, he immediately started working to reform the Philadelphia Police Department. Early in 2008, the Philadelphia Police Department was reorganized.http://www.phila.gov/InformationCenters/Accomplishments/Pages/default.aspx PhillyRising In 2010, Mayor Nutter commissioned a pilot project labeled \\"Public Service Areas\\" to supplement police response with a coordinated effort from other city agencies in areas of the city plagued with chronic issues of crime and disorder. After some initial signs of crime reduction in the Hartranft community of North Philadelphia, the pilot was renamed \\"the PhillyRising Collaborative\\" and expanded across each of the Philadelphia Police Department's six divisions. Each neighborhood selected for participation in PhillyRising is chosen based on an evaluation data regarding levels of crime, disorder, and other quality of life data. Since its inception in 2010, the PhillyRising Collaborative has supported crime reduction through improved quality of life in some of Philadelphia's most challenged communities. The team has supported active citizens with a variety of strategies, including the creation of three public computer labs (Hartranft, Frankford, & Kensington), and three Citizens' Engagement Academies (Hartranft, Swampoodle/Strawberry Mansion, & Point Breeze) which have produced 65 resident graduates. PhillyRising has also helped re-open the Hartranft Community Pool and brought the Police Athletic League to Hartranft Elementary School. These efforts, and many others, have helped to produce an average reduction of Part 1 Crimes by 4% and Part 2 Crimes by 9.5% after a full year of PhillyRising involvement in the pilot neighborhood. These reductions are significantly greater than those for the surrounding Police District. RISE Through Mayoral Executive Order, Nutter created the Mayor's Office of Reintegration Services for Ex-offenders (RISE) prioritizing the needs of returning citizens. Its mission emphasizes and formalizes the commitment of the Nutter Administration to promote safer communities and reduce law enforcement costs, assisting ex-offenders to be constructive individuals who contribute positively to our Philadelphia community, thereby reducing recidivism. As a City department, rather than a contract agency, RISE now has an ability to take lead/coordinator/partner role with grant funding solicitations. There are additional synergies and efficiencies created from the sharing of City resources. RISE has increased reentry activity levels despite a decrease in funding from $3.2 million to $1.4 million. The number of walk-in clients serviced has doubled (944 vs. 2339) and the number of clients enrolled in services has increased (531 vs. 731). In addition, there has been a 31% increase in number of clients employed (180 vs. 253). Reducing youth violence In October 2011, Mayor Nutter joined forces with Mayor Mitch Landrieu of New Orleans to create Cities United, an initiative committed to reducing African-American male on African-American male violence. Cities United works to prevent violence in a collaborative effort among mayors, foundations, national nonprofits, federal agencies and youth, seeking to place African-American males who are victims and perpetrators of violence at the center of municipal agendas and develop recommendations for a national violence reduction strategy. Nutter speaks to the Knight Foundation in 2012. Nutter also initiated the Youth Violence Reduction Partnership. The YVRP includes the City Probation & Parole, the Police and the Philadelphia Anti- Drug Anti Violence Network working in targeted police districts to identify youth at risk of becoming involved in crime and providing them support through access to employment, education, mentoring, health care and drug treatment. Mayor Nutter has been on the front lines of reducing youth violence, especially among African-American males, who are much more likely to be victims and perpetrators of violent crimes and homicides. =Sustainability= In 2009, Mayor Nutter announced Greenworks, the city's plan to become the greenest city in America by 2015. \\"Greenworks\\" outlines 15 measurable targets and 166 initiatives in five topic areas: energy, environment, equity, economy, and engagement. As of June 21, 2013, 95% of the 166 initiatives were either complete or underway. Four years into the six-year implementation timeline, two-thirds of the targets show trends toward meeting established goals. Some specific highlights of current progress include: A reduction of municipal energy use by 7 percent; alternative energy use increase from 2.5 to 14 percent; Nearly 90,000 trees planted since 2008; City Council passage of energy bench-marking and disclosure legislation; and 11.6 new miles of trails completed since 2011. In 2012, Mayor Nutter signed Bill No. 120428 which amends the 'Energy Conservation' portion of the Philadelphia Code to require large commercial buildings to benchmark and report energy and water usage data to the city. The bill's purpose is not only to make organizations aware of their energy use, but also to identify opportunities for improvement and assist in establishing energy consumption baselines that will help set future goals. Nutter also implemented the City's first guaranteed energy savings project at the City's four largest downtown office buildings. In 2011, Nutter began implementing nine energy conservation measures in the City's largest downtown office buildings. =Education= In 2008, Nutter established the Mayor's Office of Education to work on the related goals of increasing the high school graduation rate to 80 percent by 2015 and raising the rate of Philadelphia residents with a college degree to 36 percent by 2018. Currently, the on-time high school graduation rate is 64 percent and the percentage of residents with a 4-year college degree or higher is 24.3 percent. Since, 2007, the high school graduation rate has increased by 11 percentage points. School funding The City has increased its annual funding to public education by $155 million since July 2010. This extraordinary amount of funding has been borne by Philadelphia taxpayers, home owners, and local businesses and has served to help stabilize the city's system of public education. These increased dollars were necessary, but not sufficient, to help the schools provide for the safe school environments and necessary curricular and extracurricular activities for Philadelphia youth. On September 11, 2013, Mayor Michael A. Nutter launched the Philadelphia Education Supplies Fund, a new fundraising campaign to provide funds to schools within the City in order to purchase consumable supplemental classroom supplies, including workbooks, paper, pens and pencils. This fund was created to alleviate some of the hardships being experienced by high-poverty schools. Under the stated criteria, schools with at least a 50% free and reduced price lunch population were eligible to apply, and those with more than 75% free and reduced price lunches will receive greater amounts, in each case based on enrollment. The City has contributed $200,000 to the Fund, and intends to do the same for at least five years. Over $540,000 was raised for the fund and 255 schools will receive funds, this includes 209 School District of Philadelphia schools, 20 charters, 13 Archdiocesan, and 13 independent/private. Strengthening K-12 educational systems In December 2011, the Great Schools Compact was signed by the City, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the SDP, the Pennsylvania Coalition of Public Charter Schools (PCPCS), the Philadelphia Charters for Excellence (PCE) and the Archdiocese. The agreement is designed to increase cooperation among Philadelphia K-12 education providers, establish and share consistent academic metrics, and expand high-quality educational options available to students. The Great Schools Compact was awarded $2.5 million by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in December 2012 to improve teacher effectiveness, create an Urban Leadership Academy for District and Charter principals, and align benchmark assessments to the Common Core standard. The Common Core standard is a federal effort to define the knowledge and skills that students receive during their K-12 education careers so that they will graduate high school able to succeed in entry-level jobs, credit bearing academic college courses and in workforce training programs. College access and success In November 2008, Nutter re-constituted the Youth Council as the Philadelphia Council for College and Career Success ‚Äì composed of leaders from government, K-12 and higher education, employers, foundations and youth-focused community organizations ‚Äì to organize and lead education improvement efforts. The Mayor's office of Education also convenes the College Completion Committee which includes \\"retention officers\\" from area colleges and universities and senior leadership from the School District of Philadelphia. The Mayor's Office of Education is involved with cross-sector collaborations such as the College Prep Roundtable, and the Gates Millennium Scholarship Campaign. Examples of College Prep Roundtable programs include Philadelphia Academies, Inc., GEAR UP, Upward Bound, and College Access Centers. The two signature campaigns focus on issues related to college affordability, financial aid and FAFSA completion, and has resulted in a 21.7% increase in completed Free Applications for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) from 2008 through 2012. The Mayor's office also partners with the national Gates millennium Scholarship Program to offer orientation to competitive scholarship programs to high achieving seniors who commit to completing the application (which includes eight essays). In 2012, close to 500 applications were received, the second highest in the country, and five out of seven Pennsylvania recipients were Philadelphians. In February 2010, the City launched PhillyGoes2College, a program designed to help Philadelphians go to college. The effort includes a one-stop office in City Hall and a companion website that provides comprehensive guidance and referral information to students of any age who are interested in attending or completing college. Through workshops, school visits and large scale college-promoting events, PhillyGoes2College has reached over 29,000 citizens since it opened in 2010, including 9,343 in FY13. In March 2011, the Graduation Coach Campaign was brought under the umbrella of PhillyGoes2College. The Campaign focuses on engaging adults in taking on a more robust role in helping the young people in their lives graduate from high school, get into college, and plan for a career. Since September 2010, the Campaign has trained over 4,300 Coaches through 315 workshops. Other educational programs and initiatives In June 2011, Nutter signed the Education Accountability Agreement to formalize a request for improved Information sharing and coordination between the City, Commonwealth and the School District of Philadelphia. Through the agreement, the City required the School District of Philadelphia to make data public on various expenditures, placed Executive Advisers from the State and City inside the School District of Philadelphia and required the School District of Philadelphia to develop and implement a Five-Year Plan. The Mayor's Returning to Learning Partnership allows City employees to pursue a college education by taking advantage of the tuition discount program offered by 13 area colleges and universities. Employees receive a 25% discount on tuition for each course for which they enroll and in some cases may also receive a full or partial scholarship to attend select institutions. The program is now housed in the City's \\"Center of Excellence\\". =Other initiatives= Philly311 In December 2008, Mayor Nutter launched the City of Philadelphia's first 311 service. Philly311 was implemented to provide the public with quick, easy access to all city services and information. Residents can connect with Philly311 by telephone, email, mail, a walk-in center or through the Philly Mobile App. Philly311 has also extended its service through various social media channels. Since the beginning of 2012, Philly311 has seen a 360% increase in its social media followers. Mayor Nutter speaks with Secretary of State John Kerry. Sanctuary city status In April 2014, Nutter signed an executive order largely ending the agreement that allowed the federal government to detain undocumented immigrants arrested in the city prior to release. The only exemption being if the individual is being released following a first or second degree felony conviction and federal officials obtain a warrant from a judgeCBS Philadelphia: \\"Philadelphia Ends Local Cooperation With ICE Detainers\\" by Cherri Gregg April 16, 2014Philly.com: \\"Nutter to end agreement with ICE on detention\\" By Troy Graham and Michael Matza February 21, 2014 \\\\- effectively making Philadelphia a sanctuary city.San Francisco Weekly: \\"Is Philadelphia More Immigrant-Friendly Than San Francisco?\\" by Peter Jamison June 28, 2010Philly.com: \\"Stu Bykofsky: Nutter's 'sanctuary' puts us all at risk\\" July 01, 2010 Nutter indicated that the change in policy supports public safety and will help rebuild the trust between police and the immigrant community.

He was a veteran of the French and Indian War and an officer of the Continental Army in the American Revolution, serving as the first Colonel of the 1st Delaware Regiment. He was killed in action at the Battle of Princeton. Early life and family Haslet was born in Straw, Burnfoot, County Londonderry in Ulster, Ireland, about 1727, son of Joseph and Ann Dykes Haslet. As the eldest son, he attended the University of Glasgow in Scotland, earned his degree in divinity in 1749 and was ordained a Presbyterian minister at Ballykelly, County Londonderry, in 1752. About 1750, he married Shirley Stirling, daughter of the Presbyterian minister from Walworth, Ballykelly.It may be doubtful that his first wife was Stirling's daughter, since he would have been elderly, having been minister at Ballkelly since the start of the 18th century. They had a daughter Mary, called Polly, born about 1752. Shirley most likely died in childbirth, as Polly was raised by her uncle, Samuel Haslet and followed her father to America in 1765. By 1764, he had settled near Milford, Delaware, and married Jemima Molleston, the widow of John Brinkle and sister of Henry Molleston. Records of the Presbyterian Historical Society of America do not show him as a preacher in America; rather he is commonly referred to as \\"doctor\\" Haslet, reference to his medical practice. In 1767, he bought a tract of land called \\"Longfield\\", now inside the northern limits of Milford just off Roosa Road. They had four children together, Ann, Jemima, John and Joseph. French and Indian War Arriving in America in 1757, he served in the French and Indian War as a captain in the Pennsylvania militia. He was part of the Forbes expedition that captured Fort Duquesne in November 1758. He wrote a letter describing the condition of the fort. American Revolutionary War In response to the request of the Continental Congress, the Lower Counties Assembly raised the 1st Delaware Regiment, placing Haslet at its command on January 19, 1776, with the rank of colonel. Known as the \\"Delaware Continentals\\" or \\"Delaware Blues\\", they were from the smallest state, but at some 800 men, were the largest battalion in the army. David McCullough in 1776 describes them as turned out in handsome red trimmed blue coats, white waistcoats, buckskin breeches, white woolen stockings, and carrying fine, 'lately imported' English muskets. Raised in early 1776, they went from north in July and August 1776, arriving in time to engage in the entire sequence of events surrounding the British capture of New York in 1776. At the Battle of Long Island, the Delaware Regiment fought with Colonel William Smallwood's Marylanders. Many thought these were the two best regiments in the Continental Army. They fought under the command of Brigadier General William Alexander, Lord Stirling, and were responsible for holding the Gowanus Road, the far right of the Continental Army line. They were immediately south of Brooklyn, with New York Harbor to their right. On August 27, 1776, the British sent much of their army well to the east, and under cover of darkness, easily turned the left flank of the Continental Army. Only on the right did the American's hold their own. McCullough again relates how Haslet later described \\"how his 'Delawares' stood with 'determined countenance', on them all the while, and the enemy, 'though six times their number', not daring to attack\\". But they were nearly surrounded and, once ordered to leave, could only undertake a harrowing retreat by wading and swimming across Gowanus Bay. When the fighting began, Haslet was attending a court martial in Manhattan, but returned to the regiment in time for some of the fighting. Retreating across Westchester County, Haslet's men won a victory over a corps of Loyalists at Mamaroneck, New York. At White Plains, on October 28, 1776, the Delaware Regiment again fought with Colonel William Smallwood's Marylanders, reinforcing militia placed on the strategic Chatterton's Hill. The local militia fled under the British attack, but Haslet and Smallwood fought on until, at last, they too yielded the ground. The Battle of White Plains was another British victory, but because of the difficulty in taking Chatterton's Hill, the price was great and the reward to the British was little. With expiring enlistments leaving fewer than 100 men remaining in his regiment, Haslet crossed the Delaware with Washington and joined the attack at the Battle of Trenton on the morning of December 26, 1776. However, on January 3, 1777, in a skirmish at the beginning of the Battle of Princeton, with General Hugh Mercer down and wounded, Haslet tried to rally Mercer's brigade and was himself shot in the head and killed instantly. Nevertheless, they did rally and a surprising victory was won to complement the earlier one at Trenton. The \\"corps of loyalists\\" he defeated at Mamaroneck was led by the famous Indian fighter Robert Rogers (soldier). Legend has it that Washington wept over his corpse on the battlefield and notes by Washington's stepson confirm that Washington did come across Haslet's body at Princeton, but does not mention any shedding of tears. Legacy Haslet was first buried at the First Presbyterian Church cemetery in Philadelphia. By an act of the Delaware General Assembly on July 1, 1841, his remains were disinterred and moved to the Presbyterian Cemetery in Dover, Delaware. In 2001, the State of Delaware dedicated a monument to honor him at Battle Monument Park in Princeton, New Jersey. John Haslet was perhaps the best soldier Delaware had to offer, and the next best soldier, his good friend Caesar Rodney, rushed to the Continental Army to try and fill his place. Haslet was succeeded as colonel by David Hall as Rodney returned home to be Delaware's wartime Governor, but the regiment Haslet had built remained among the finest in the Continental Army until it was virtually destroyed at the Battle of Camden in 1780.

It lies on the √öhlava River under the ≈†umava Range some 50 km south-west of the region capital of Plze≈à. It has about 5,000 inhabitants. N√Ωrsko is also a Municipality with Commissioned Local Authority within the Klatovy Municipality with Extended Competence. History The first written mention about N√Ωrsko dates back to 1327. It was probably a settlement in the 12th century. It was situated on the trade route to Bavaria near the ford across the √öhlava. A customs officer was located here. The lower part of the town, called Doln√≠ N√Ωrsko (\\"Lower N√Ωrsko\\"), was a member of the Royal Chamber, and the upper part, Horn√≠ N√Ωrsko (\\"Upper N√Ωrsko\\"), was a market village under the ownership of the Pajrek castle. In 1558 Horn√≠ N√Ωrsko joined Doln√≠ N√Ωrsko and both became property of the municipality of Byst≈ôice nad √öhlavou. The town developed and grew quickly at that time and it obtained many rights and privileges from Rudolph II in 1539. The development continued in the 19th century when the railroad, the factory for the production of optical instruments, and the shop of cut-glass were founded here. South of the town a 36m high stone dam for a reservoir was built in 1969.

DirecTV carried this channel on channel 859 until February 9, 2010. BPM can be heard on channel 51 for both services and Dish Network 6051 (99-51 on hopper) BPM features Geronimo, the Program Director, on weekdays 7-10am, Rida Naser on weekdays 10am-2pm, Ben Harvey on weekdays 2-6pm, Danny Valentino on Saturdays 10am-3pm and Sundays 12-5pm, Mallory Lynne on Saturdays 3-6pm and Sundays 5-9pm and Liquid Todd on weeknights 6-11pm. BPM bills itself as the world's EDM leader. Regular programming Sirius XM currently describes the channel as follows: > The world‚Äôs EDM leader! Spinning the EDM hits, remixes and club hits that > bring the energy and passion of a weekend party into every day and night. > #bpm @sxmelectro BPM is presented in a Top 40 radio style. Its original program director was Blake Lawrence (known on-air as \\"Maxwell House\\"), who headed the channel until he left XM for New York's WQCD in 2004. BPM's original format, from 2001 through 2005, was current mainstream dance; in 2006 it made a slight shift toward the pop mainstream. However, in March 2009, its emphasis changed dramatically to focus primarily on remixed top-40 music, 90's dance cuts and selected songs that date to the early 1980s, a similar format to the former Sirius channel, \\"The Beat\\". With the launch of the new retro Dance channel Utopia in 2010, BPM has phased out the recurrents and gold product in order to focus on current product. BPM is commercial-free and has on-air DJs. Despite being electronic music in general, the internet station can be adjusted to omit or strongly emphasize dubstep. Former shows *33 & 1/3 This was the first dance music countdown show on BPM, which ran from 2001 to 2006. The program aired on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays and counted down the top 33 & 1/3 songs (actually 34; 33 is the RPM on a dance 12\\" single, hence the show's name). In between the tracks, five new singles that were being tested as feedback for listeners called \\"Wannabes\\" was featured, along with a flashback of a number one song that reached the top spot on the show a year earlier. Originally hosted by Maxwell House (Blake Lawrence), then by Alan Freed. *The Spin Factor - A two-hour dance music countdown, hosted by former PD Alan Freed, showcasing the top songs on BPM based entirely on requests and user input. It consisted of approximately 28 songs and the #1 song from one year prior. This program replaced 33 & 1/3 in January 2006. In 2006, The Spin Factor aired every Sunday at 3pm ET, Monday at 6pm ET, and Monday nights at midnight ET. The Spin Factor was discontinued in January 2007; Its last weekly produced countdown program was December 24, 2006. No reason has yet been posted. *The BPM Project - An hour-long program that focused on new tracks and listeners were invited to respond with feedback on whether they want to hear them played regularly. Also hosted by Alan Freed, this program replaced the \\"Wannabes\\" segments that were part of 33 & 1/3. *Bullet Points - Daily short- form dance music news and event listings by Alan Freed. Each week's reports were published on the BPM web site attached to the weekly countdown chart. *Corsten's Countdown (which moved to sister dance station Electric Area) An interactive monthly countdown show hosted by Ferry Corsten. This series features new dance tracks, club mix sets and the top club songs voted on by listeners online. *D.U.I. (Dancing Under the Influence) (discontinued after the Sirius XM merger) Six hours of DJ sets from BPM Resident DJs **Melle Mel (Detroit) **DJ Armando (Hartford) **DJ Scotty Boy (Las Vegas) **Lil Cee (New York) In addition, Matt Darey's Nocturnal (a popular worldwide dance music show) aired as part of the \\"D.U.I.\\" block. Melle Mel came aboard as a replacement for DJ Smooth. Prior to the DUI show, DJ Smooth was one of the DJs who played the Rotation mix sets, from October 2002 to December 2005. *Global Domination (which moved to sister dance station Electric Area) features two- hour sets from five different DJs across the world (the name \\"Global Domination\\" comes from the far-flung nature of the DJs). **\\"Club Life\\" with DJ Ti√´sto of the Netherlands **\\"Nocturnal\\" with Matt Darey of London **\\"12 inches of Cox\\" with Chris Cox of Los Angeles **\\"Junior's World\\" with Junior Vasquez of New York **Jonathan Peters of New York **DJ Ti√´sto (replay) *Backspins With Boesche - An hour of classic dance music tracks from the 1990s and early 2000s mixed by BPM resident DJ Jon Boesche. *Air BPM (originally Air 81) - A three- hour block of DJ sets by BPM Resident DJs on Friday nights presented in the format of an imaginary flight across America from east to west. Each hour features a different DJ from a different city. Each hour the \\"flight\\" \\"touches down\\" in a new city and the next DJ plays. The block featured Johnny Budz (New York), Cato K (Miami), and DJ Leony (Orlando). *Air BPM in Reverse - Discontinued as of March 14, 2009. (Same as AIR BPM, but backwards with respect to programming schedule) An eight-hour block of DJ sets by BPM Resident DJs on Saturday nights presented in the format of an imaginary flight across America from east to west. Each hour features a different DJ from a different city. Each hour the \\"flight\\" \\"touches down\\" in a new city and the next DJ plays. **9pm ET - Mike Rizzo (New York) **10pm ET - DJ Theo (New York) **11pm ET - Joe Bermudez (Boston) **Midnight ET - DJ Leony (Orlando) **1am ET - Scotty Boy (Las Vegas) **2am ET - Cato K. (Miami) **3am ET - Nathan Scott (Chicago) **4am ET - Johnny Budz (New York) *Addiction w/ DJ Armando Used to air weeknights at 11pm ET/ 8pm PT, Sunday mornings at midnight ET/9pm PT. DJ Armando previously aired a live Addiction show at 5pm ET & 8pm ET. Many fans were disappointed by the move to 11pm. The BEAT Morning Show was added on January 15, 2009, after the merger of BPM on November 12, 2008, with many subscribers upset about the new channel and music programming. The show was removed from the line-up just three months later, with no reason. Criticism As noted above, in March 2009, the emphasis changed dramatically to focus on remixed top-40 music, taking the playlist from the now-defunct Sirius 36 The Beat. Most of the older dance content is now on The Strobe. Immediately afterward, there was major public backlash, notably on the station's Facebook page and other fan pages on the web. Many hardcore dance/club fans were alienated by the music favored by the small minority to whom the channel was trying to appeal. After many months of BPM \\"crying wolf\\" about changes coming, on June 16, 2009, the channel's pure dance origins temporarily returned. The station announced that it had expanded the playlist to include the entire channel library from 2001 to the present. Shortly afterward on June 30, 2009, program director Skyy left the company. Management of the station shifted to Mike Abrams (who has been with XM since 2004) and Geronimo, former program director of the defunct pre-acquisition Sirius dance channel, \\"The Beat\\", known for its heavy focus on mainstream top-40 remixes and tracks from the 90s and 80s. On January 15, 2009, \\"The Beat Morning Show with Geronimo\\" made its debut. Geronimo was heard on The Beat during its run on Sirius, and the show feature music that was heard on The Beat previous to the combination of the two services. As of June 13, 2009, \\"The Beat Morning Show\\" is no longer used on air or listed in the program guide. Many subscribers had expressed their displeasure with the \\"Bagatelle Brunch\\" that aired on Saturday afternoons from 3 pm to 6 pm. An overwhelming number of comments on the station's Facebook fan page have complained that the allegedly live broadcast from a nightclub is poorly mixed, with excessive crowd noise and a heavy dose of non-electronic dance music (i.e. classic rock and R&B;). As of October 12, 2009, BPM dropped the weekday 1pm \\"Best of Bagatelle Brunch\\" from the schedule. As of February 5, 2011, due to subscriber backlash, the show has been canceled. Awards BPM was twice the recipient of the annual International Dance Music Awards' \\"Best Satellite Dance Channel\\" award (for calendar years 2004 and 2005). This is notable for the fact that the award was presented only twice and because the public votes on the awards. BPM was the favorite of the other XM dance cluster channels nominated - \\"The Move\\" and \\"The System\\" - as well as the dance channels on former competitor Sirius. BPM has been nominated for a radio award in each of the subsequent IDMAs but has not won since 2005. In 2015, program director, Geronimo, was named #21 on Billboard's list of top EDM Power Players http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/6597674/billboard-edm-power- players-list-dance-2015?page=0%2C2 Other broadcast platforms BPM was included in almost every XM cross-promotion previous to the 2008 acquisition and was heard by subscribers to DirecTV Satellite TV (ch. 859), and on two United States airlines: JetBlue and AirTran Airways, and on supported devices by users of AT&T; Mobility, Sprint (for Sirius users) and Alltel wireless.

It was inscribed by UNESCO in the World Heritage List as representing the evolution of nomadic pastoral traditions spanning more than two millennia. (See List of World Heritage Sites in Mongolia). Location of the Orkhon Valley in Asia.  Importance  For many centuries, the Orkhon Valley was viewed as the seat of the imperial power of the steppes. The first evidence comes from a stone stele with runic inscriptions, which was erected in the valley by Bilge Khan, an 8th-century ruler of the G√∂kt√ºrk Empire. Some 25 miles to the north of the stele, in the shadow of the sacred forest-mountain √ñt√ºken, was his √ñrd√º, or nomadic capital. During the Qidan domination of the valley, the stele was reinscribed in three languages, so as to record the deeds of a Qidan potentate. Mountains were considered sacred in Tengriism as an axis mundi, but √ñt√ºken was especially sacred because the ancestor spirits of the khagans and beys resided here. Moreover, a force called qut was believed to emanate from this mountain, granting the khagan the divine right to rule the Turkic tribes.Franke, Herbert. The Cambridge History of China. Cambridge University Press, 1994. . Page 347. Whoever controlled this valley was considered heavenly appointed leader of the Turks and could rally the tribes. Thus control of the Orkhon Valley was of the utmost strategic importance for every Turkic state. Historically every Turkic capital (√ñrd√º) was located here for this exact reason. There were many houses by the bank but they are all gone now.  Sites  Ulaan Tsutgalan waterfall (dry). The main monuments of the Orkhon Valley are as follows: # The Orkhon monuments are early 8th-century Turkic memorials to Bilge Khan and Kul Tigin, the most impressive monuments from the nomadic G√∂kt√ºrk Empire. They were discovered by Russian archaeologists in 1889 and deciphered by Vilhelm Thomsen in 1893. # Ruins of Ordu-Baliq at the site known as Kharbalgas in Mongolian, an 8th-century capital of the Uyghur Empire, which cover 50 square km and contain evidence of the palace, shops, temples, monasteries, etc. # Ruins of Mongol capital of Karakorum, which could have included the famed Xanadu palace. # Erdene Zuu monastery is the first Buddhist monastery established in Mongolia.

It was the biggest civilian maritime disaster in the Atlantic Ocean until the sinking of Titanic eight years later, and is still the largest loss of life from a Danish merchant ship. History She was built in 1881 by Alexander Stephen and Sons of Linthouse, Glasgow, for the Belgian company Theodore C. Engels & Co of Antwerp; her original name was Pieter de Coninck. The ship was 3,359 GRT and , and the engine gave a speed of . She could carry a maximum of 800 passengers. In 1889, she was sold to a Danish company, A/S Dampskibs-selskabet Thingvalla, for its Stettin-Copenhagen-Kristiania- Kristiansand-New York service and renamed Norge. On 20 August 1898, Norge collided with the French fishing brigantine La Coquette in a fog. La Coquette broke in two and sank, and 16 of the 25 crew aboard drowned. Following financial difficulties, Thingvalla was purchased in 1898 by Det Forenede Dampskibs-Selskab (DFDS), Copenhagen, which served the route as \\"Scandinavia- America Line\\". By then, the capacity of Norge was 1100 passengers; 50 first class, 150 second class, and 900 third class. Final voyage On 22 June 1904 Norge left Copenhagen under the command of Captain Valdemar Johannes Gundel. After taking on Norwegian emigrants at Oslo and Kristiansand, the ship set course across the Atlantic Ocean, travelling north of Scotland to New York City. She was carrying a crew of 68 and 727 passengers. Among the steerage passengers, there were 296 Norwegians, 236 Russians, 79 Danes, 68 Swedes, and 15 Finns. Half of the steerage passengers had prepaid tickets, paid for by relatives living in the United States. On 28 June, Norge ran aground on Hasselwood Rock, Helen's Reef, close to Rockall, in foggy weather. She was reversed off the rock after a few minutes, but the collision had ripped holes in the ship's hull, and water began pouring into the hold. The crew of the Norge began lowering the lifeboats, but the first two lowered were destroyed by waves. Of the eight lifeboats on board, only five were successfully launched. Page 7 Many passengers jumped overboard, only to drown. The Norge sank twelve minutes after the collision. Captain Gundal stayed with the ship as it sank, but managed to swim to one of the lifeboats. According to author Per Kristian Sebak's comprehensive account, more than 635 people died during the sinking, among them 225 Norwegians. The first survivors to be rescued, a group of 26, were found by the Grimsby trawler Sylvia. 32 more were picked up by the British steamer Cervonax, and 70, including Captain Gundal, by the German steamer Energie. Some of the 160 survivors spent up to eight days in open lifeboats before rescue. Several more people lost their lives in the days that followed rescue, as a result of their exposure to the elements and swallowing salt water. Among the survivors was the poet Herman Wildenvey.wildenvey.com Wreck today The disaster remains the worst in Danish maritime history.

It commemorates the more than 9,000 Japanese Americans who were imprisoned at the Minidoka War Relocation Center during the Second World War.\\"Minidoka,\\" Hanako Wakatsuki. Densho Encyclopedia, 10 June 2013. Located in the Magic Valley of south central Idaho in Jerome County, the site is in the Snake River Plain, a remote high desert area north of the Snake River. It is northeast of Twin Falls and just north of Eden, in an area known as Hunt. The site is administered by the National Park Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior, and was originally established as the Minidoka Internment National Monument in 2001. by President Bill Clinton Its elevation is just under above sea level. Minidoka War Relocation Center The Minidoka War Relocation Center operated from 1942 to 1945 as one of ten camps at which Japanese Americans, both citizens and resident \\"aliens\\", were interned during World War II. Under provisions of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order 9066, all persons of Japanese ancestry were excluded from the West Coast of the United States. At its peak, Minidoka housed 9,397 Japanese Americans, predominantly from Oregon, Washington, and Alaska. The Minidoka irrigation project shares its name with Minidoka County. The Minidoka name was applied to the Idaho relocation center in Jerome County, probably to avoid confusion with the Jerome War Relocation Center in Jerome, Arkansas. Construction by the Morrison-Knudsen Company began in 1942 on the camp, which received 10,000 internees by years' end. Many of the internees worked as farm labor, and later on the irrigation project and the construction of Anderson Ranch Dam, northeast of Mountain Home. The Reclamation Act of 1902 had racial exclusions on labor which were strictly adhered to until Congress changed the law in 1943.National Park Service - history - Anderson Ranch Dam & Powerplant, Idaho - accessed 2012-02-09 Population at the Minidoka camp declined to 8,500 at the end of 1943, and to 6,950 by the end of 1944. The camp formally closed on October 28, 1945. On February 10, 1946, the vacated camp was turned over to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which used the facilities to house returning war veterans. The Minidoka War Relocation Center consisted of 36 blocks of housing. Each block contained 12 barracks (which themselves were divided into 6 separate living areas), laundry facilities, bathrooms, and a mess hall. Recreation Halls in each block were multi-use facilities that served as both worship and education centers. Minidoka had a high school, a junior high school and two elementary schools - Huntsville and Stafford. The Minidoka War Relocation Center also included two dry cleaners, four general stores, a beauty shop, two barber shops, radio and watch repair stores as well as two fire stations. In June 1942, the War Department authorized the formation of the 100th Infantry Battalion consisting of 1,432 men of Japanese descent in the Hawaii National Guard and sent them to Camps McCoy and Shelby for advanced training. Because of its superior training record, FDR authorized the formation of the 442nd RCT in January 1943 when 10,000 men from Hawaii signed up with eventually 2,686 being chosen along with 1,500 from the mainland. The Minidoka Internees created an Honor Roll display to acknowledge the service of their fellow Japanese-Americans. According to Echoes of Silence, 844 men from this camp volunteered or were drafted for military service.https://www.dropbox.com/sh/2nihl23t9tg7uxv/AAAUYc2PkAR72q99FMxy7jGfa/14)%20SOLDIERS%20AND%20CAMPS?dl=0&preview;=!SOLDIERS+AND+THE+CAMPS+(Alphabetical)+646B.pdf&subfolder;_nav_tracking=1 Although the original was lost after the war, the Honor Roll was recreated by the Friends of Minidoka group in 2011 following a grant from the National Park Service. =Terminology= Since the end of World War II, there has been debate over the terminology used to refer to Minidoka, and the other camps in which Americans of Japanese ancestry and their immigrant parents, were incarcerated by the United States Government during the war. Minidoka has been referred to as a \\"War Relocation Center\\", \\"relocation camp\\", \\"relocation center\\", \\"internment camp\\", and \\"concentration camp\\", and the controversy over which term is the most accurate and appropriate continues to the present day. National Historic Site Japanese-American internees in Idaho at the Minidoka War Relocation Center The internment camp site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 10, 1979. A national monument was established in 2001 at the site by President Bill Clinton on January 17, as he invoked his authority under the Antiquities Act. As one of the newer units of the National Park System, it currently has temporary visitor facilities and services available on location. A new visitor contact station is being built and will open in 2020. Currently, visitors see the remains of the entry guard station, waiting room, and rock garden and can visit the Relocation Center display at the Jerome County Museum in nearby Jerome and the restored barracks building at the Idaho Farm and Ranch Museum southeast of town. There is a small marker adjacent to the remains of the guard station, and a larger sign at the intersection of Highway 25 and Hunt Road, which gives some of the history of the camp. The National Park Service began a three-year public planning process in the fall of 2002 to develop a General Management Plan (GMP) and Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). The General Management Plan sets forth the basic management philosophy for the Monument and provides the strategies for addressing issues and achieving identified management objectives that will guide management of the site for the next 15-20 years. In 2006, President George W. Bush signed H.R. 1492 into law on December 21, guaranteeing $38 million in federal money to restore the Minidoka relocation center along with nine other former Japanese internment camps. Less than two years later on May 8, 2008, President Bush signed the Wild Sky Wilderness Act into law, which changed the status of the former U.S. National Monument to National Historic Site and added the Bainbridge Island Japanese American Exclusion Memorial on Bainbridge Island, Washington to the monument.

It is so named because its box is smaller size box, and the colony of honeybees is in it, and a nuc hive is centered on a queen bee, the nucleus of the honey bee colony.  Layout  A nuc hive has all the features of a standard 10 frame Langstroth hive except with a reduced width. A link shows a United States Department of Agriculture USDA layout for building a nuc. A typical nuc has 5 Langstroth frames arranged side-by-side. Nuclei can also be created using other hive dimensions, with the British modified national hive being the most common in the United Kingdom. According to FERA's National Bee Unit guidelines, the nucleus should be between 3-6 frames of bees, including a queen, workers, brood in all stages, and honey stores.  Creation  The nuc box, also called a nuc, is a smaller version of a normal beehive, designed to hold fewer frames. The nuc box is smaller because it is intended to contain a smaller number of honeybees, and a smaller space makes it easier for the bees to control the temperature and humidity of the colony, which is vital for brood rearing. When using a Langstroth hive, a nuc is created by pulling two to five frames from an existing colony. These frames and the nurse bees clinging to them form the basis for the nuc colony. A nuc may or may not be given a queen at the time it is created. If the nuc does not contain a queen or queen-cell, but does contain eggs, the workers will create a new queen from one of the eggs. If the nuc is to be given a new queen, the queen will be introduced to the colony in her queen cage either at the time the nuc is split from the main colony, or after a period of queenlessness that increases the likelihood that the new queen will be accepted. Nucs are often used to prevent swarming in a larger colony, by removing frames with queen-cells from a larger colony and using them to provide the basis for a new colony. The removal of queen cells and reduction in population in the donor colony diminish the urge to swarm. This procedure may also be called a walk-away split.  Care and feeding  A nuc is extremely vulnerable, as it possesses in some cases less than a tenth of the workers in a normal colony. Nucs are almost always fed using a boardman feeder or frame feeder. Feeding allows the worker bees to remain in the nuc, acting as nurse bees for developing brood. Because of their small population, Nucs are vulnerable to robbing, in which a stronger hive steals all the nectar, honey, or syrup from a weaker hive. The bees from a robbing hive will kill any bees that defend the nuc. Robbing can lead to starvation in days.  Uses  A nucleus colony can be used to stop overcrowding in a larger, healthy colony by splitting some of the population off to a new colony. A nuc can also be used to care for spare queens. The loss of a queen in a large colony can set the colony back by up to a month. A nucleus colony can be combined with the larger colony to re-queen it with a much smaller break in brood rearing. A nuc can also grow into a full-sized colony, given proper time, favorable weather, and appropriate resources. The terms 'nuc' and 'split' are not strictly interchangeable. While a nuc may have a number of different uses, a split more often refers to dividing a colony for the purposes of growing the removed bees back to a full-sized colony. A nuc is not normally intended for overwintering, as nuc colonies do not possess a large enough winter cluster to survive winter in harsher climates. Beekeepers often combine nucs together in the fall to produce a single, strong colony. This results in the loss of all but one queen, but provides a colony capable of surviving winter. In warm climates, nucs can overwinter. Nucs can also survive winter indoors, or in an observation hive.  Mating nucs  Mating nucs are a special type of nuc that may be even smaller than nucs that use standard size frames. These tiny nucs are sometimes called mini-mating nucs. Mating nucs are used in a queen mating yard. A capped queen cell is put into a mating nuc together with a sufficient number of attendant worker bees. When the virgin queen emerges and matures (a process that takes around five to seven days from the point at which she emerges), she flies out and mates with up to 20 drones before returning to the mating nuc. When mating is successful a nice brood pattern can be seen on the frames of the mating nuc. Successfully mated queens are caged and shipped to be used as production queens by beekeepers. Queen breeders raise thousands of queens in this fashion.

The problem was first formulated in 1929 by Sir Nevill Francis Mott and Werner Heisenberg, illustrating the paradox of the collapse of a spherically symmetric wave function into the linear tracks seen in a cloud chamber. In practice, virtually all high energy physics experiments, such as those conducted at particle colliders, involve wave functions which are inherently spherical. Yet, when the results of a particle collision are detected, they are invariably in the form of linear tracks (see, for example, the illustrations accompanying the article on bubble chambers). It is somewhat strange to think that a spherically symmetric wave function should be observed as a straight track, and yet, this occurs on a daily basis in all particle collider experiments. A related variant formulation was given in 1953 by Mauritius Renninger, and is now known as Renninger's negative- result gedanken experiment. In this formulation, it is noted that the absence of a particle detection can also constitute a quantum measurement; namely, that a measurement can be performed even if no particle whatsoever is detected. Mott's analysis In the original 1929 formulation by Mott and Heisenberg, the spherical wave function of an alpha ray emitted from the decay of a radioactive atomic nucleus was considered. It was noted that the result of such a decay is always observed as linear tracks seen in Wilson's cloud chamber. Intuitively, one might think that such a wave function should randomly ionize atoms throughout the cloud chamber, but this is not the case. Mott demonstrated that by considering the interaction in configuration space, where all of the atoms of the cloud chamber play a role, it is overwhelmingly probable that all of the condensed droplets in the cloud chamber will lie close to the same straight line. What is uncertain is which straight line the wave packet will reduce to; the probability distribution of straight tracks is spherically symmetric. Modern applications In modern times, the Mott problem is occasionally considered theoretically in the context of astrophysics and cosmology, where the evolution of the wave function from the Big Bang or other astrophysical phenomena is considered.

The main park visitor center is in Mountainair. Construction of the missions began in 1622 and was completed in 1635. History Once, thriving Native American trade communities of Tiwa and Tompiro language-speaking Puebloans inhabited this remote frontier area of central New Mexico. Early in the 17th century Spanish Franciscans found the area ripe for their missionary efforts. However, by the late 1670s the entire Salinas District, as the Spanish had named it, was depopulated of both Indian and Spaniard. What remains today are austere yet beautiful reminders of this earliest contact between Pueblo Indians and Spanish Colonials: the ruins of three mission churches, at Quarai, Ab√≥, and Gran Quivira and the partially excavated pueblo of Las Humanas or, as it is known today, the Gran Quivira pueblo. It was first proclaimed Gran Quivira National Monument on November 1, 1909. As with all historic areas administered by the National Park Service, the National Monument was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. On December 19, 1980 it was enlarged and two New Mexico State Monuments were absorbed into it on November 2, 1981. It was renamed on October 28, 1988. Quarai Ruins The Quarai Ruins are located about 8 miles north of Mountainair, at about 6650 feet (2026 m) above sea level. There is a visitor center and a 0.5 mile (0.8 km) trail through the ruins. In a forest, an interpretive sign reads that when Francis Gardes traveled through the area, he heard birds sing a song called \\"When Explorers Came\\". Francis Gardes's trail became Francis Garde National Historic Trail, and it passes through Quarai. Ab√≥ Ruins The Abo Pueblo community was established in the 11th Century on the edge of the existing pueblo culture and was often attracted by roaming Nomadic Tribes of the eastern plains. San Gregorio de Ab√≥ Mission (located in Mountainair, New Mexico) was one of three Spanish missions constructed in or near the pueblos of central New Mexico?

He built Buckwood Lodge, a small mansion, on the side of Kittatinny Ridge, between the river and Sunfish Pond, a small lake higher up the ridge covering . Worthington gave Sunfish Pond the name of Buckwood Lake, and used it as a water supply for his lodge. Worthington hunted deer in what is now the State Forest. The forest includes the Dunnfield Creek Natural Area; the creek is designated a Wild Trout Stream.

Western Regional Climate Center. The Salt River runs through this area, providing a rare, year-round source of water. Cliff dwellings Well-preserved cliff dwellings were occupied by the Salado culture during the 13th, 14th, and early 15th centuries. The people farmed in the Salt River Valley, and supplemented their diet by hunting and gathering native plants. The Salado were fine craftspeople, producing some of the most flamboyant polychrome pottery and intricately woven textiles to be found in the Southwest. Some of the artifacts excavated nearby are on display in the visitor center museum. The Tonto National Monument Archeological District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. Tonto National Monument, Lower Ruin and Tonto National Monument, Upper Ruin are archeological sites that were NRHP-listed in 1989. Natural history The National Monument is surrounded by the Tonto National Forest, which includes low plains, desert scrubland, and alpine pine forests. The Upper Sonoran ecosystem is known for its characteristic saguaro cacti. Other common plants include: cholla, prickly pear, hedgehog, and barrel cactus (flowering from April to June); yucca, sotol, and agave; creosote bush and ocotillo; palo verde and mesquite trees; an amazing variety of colorful wild flowers in good years (February to March); and a lush riparian area which supports large Arizona Walnut, Arizona Sycamore, and hackberry trees.

The clear waters surrounding Saint John support a diverse and complex system of coral reefs. The health of these reefs is closely tied to its component plants and animals as well as adjacent non-coral marine environments such as sandy bottoms, seagrass beds, and mangrove forests. Seeking to provide greater protection to the sensitive coral reef resources, President Clinton established the Virgin Islands Coral Reef National Monument on January 17, 2001. The monument includes 12,708 acres (51 km2) of federal submerged lands within the 3 mile (5 km) belt off Saint John, including Hurricane Hole and areas north and south of Saint John.  Ecosystem  Hurricane Hole, the only coastal part of the National Monument The coral reefs of the U.S. Virgin Islands suffered severely from coral bleaching in 2005, which led to a 60% decline in coral activity. The USGS began extensive research in the area and scientists discovered previously unknown coral ecosystems at the submerged stems of mangrove trees in the Hurricane Hole area of the National Monument. They found about 30 of the 45 coral species in the Virgin Islands, which is an astonishing diversity for the small area, and were surprised by the number of sponge species as well.

Early life Gray is the son of Dan and Mitzi Gray of Illinois. In Hellyeah's DVD Below the Belt, he talks of how his grandmother, Betty Rau, raised him and brought him to perform in choir. Career =Mudvayne= Gray performing with Mudvayne He quit his factory job that paid $40,000 a year to move to Peoria, Illinois and formed Mudvayne. Gray wrote Mudvayne's \\"Death Blooms\\" about his grandmother's disease. Gray has made several guest appearances with other bands, including on the songs \\"Monsters\\" by V Shape Mind, \\"Falling Backwards\\" by Bloodsimple and \\"Miracle\\" by Nonpoint. Gray has made an appearance during Mitch Lucker's Memorial Show and sang \\"Fuck Everything\\" by Suicide Silence. =Hellyeah= Gray became friends with Nothingface guitarist Tom Maxwell, and they talked about the possibility of forming a supergroup. The following year, Nothingface toured with Mudvayne and talks to form the supergroup continued, although were constantly put on hold due to scheduling conflicts. At this time, Gray and Maxwell had brainstormed five band names. Gray with Hellyeah in 2008 Mudvayne guitarist Greg Tribbett approached Maxwell \\"out of the blue\\" and wanted to join the band. Nothingface drummer Tommy Sickles originally helmed the drum kit for the band's demo, however, things did not work out and the search for a new drummer began.Jon Wiederhorn, \\"Hellyeah: Night Riders\\", Revolver, March 2007, p. 60-64 (link to Revolver back issues ) The band knew former Pantera and Damageplan drummer Vinnie Paul, and tried to persuade him to join the band as their drummer. Originally, Paul was not sure if he would return to music after the death of his brother, Dimebag Darrell and an 18-month hiatus: \\"It was one of those things that I didn't think I'd be a part of this ever again without him, and after about a year and a half had gone by, these guys called me up, Chad [Gray] and Tom [Maxwell], they were like, 'We're thinking about putting this band together, would you be into it?' First couple of times, I told them, 'No, I don't think I'm ready to do this yet.' And they just were real persistent, they kept calling me. And one night, I had been drinking some red wine and listening to some KISS on 12\\" vinyl record and I said, 'You know what, lets take a shot at this, lets see what happens.'\\" The band's persistence paid off and Paul joined the project. Paul commented about joining the project: \\"Everybody had their head in the right place and that let's-tear-the-world-a-new-ass attitude\\". Personal life Gray previously married Kelli Olson in 2005. He is engaged to Shannon Gunz, a radio host for several Sirius XM channels including Turbo, Octane and Ozzy's Boneyard.

For thousands of years, people came to the red bluffs above the Canadian River for flint, vital to their existence. Demand for the high- quality, rainbow-hued flint is reflected in the distribution of Alibates flint through the Great Plains and beyond. Indians of the Ice Age Clovis culture used Alibates flint for spear points to hunt the imperial mammoth before the Great Lakes were formed. The flint usually lies just below the surface at ridge level in a layer up to 6 ft thick. The quarry pits were not very large, between 5 and 25 ft wide and 4 to 7 ft deep. Many of these quarries were exploited by the Antelope Creek people of the Panhandle culture between 1200 and 1450 AD. The stone-slabbed, multiroom houses built by the Antelope Creek people have long been of interest to the public and studied by archaeologists. Today, this area is protected by the U.S. National Park Service and can only be viewed by ranger-led guided tours, which must be reserved in advance. Alibates Flint Quarries was the only national monument in the state of Texas until the Military Working Dog Teams National Monument was created in 2013, and is adjacent to and managed together with Lake Meredith National Recreation Area. The monument was authorized as Alibates Flint Quarries and Texas Panhandle Pueblo Culture National Monument on August 31, 1965, but the designation was shortened to the current name on November 10, 1978.

The memorial is located in a natural setting on the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border on the southeast flank of the Huachuca Mountains south of Sierra Vista, Arizona and is bordered to the north and west by Coronado National Forest. Within the memorial is an overlook at Montezuma Pass where the Coronado expedition entered modern Arizona. The memorial confirms the ties that bind the United States and Mexico. Memorial development Official statements indicate that it was initially designed as a gesture of goodwill and cooperation between the United States and Mexico, through the recognition of Coronado's 1540 expedition to the area. For example, in 1939 the House Committee on Foreign Affairs noted: :As a result of this expedition, what has been truly characterized by historians as one of the greatest land expeditions the world has known, a new civilization was established in the great American Southwest. And E. K. Burlew, Acting Secretary of the Interior added in 1940: :To commemorate permanently the explorations of Francisco V√°squez de Coronado. . .would be of great value in advancing the relationship of the United States and Mexico upon a friendly basis of cultural understanding. . . [It would] stress the history and problems of the two countries and would encourage cooperation for the advancement of their common interests. Thus the site was first designated Coronado International Memorial on August 18, 1941, with the hope that a comparable adjoining area would be established in Mexico. The arrangement might have been similar to the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park between the United States and Canada. However, despite interest by the government of Mexico, the Mexican memorial was never created, therefore Congress changed the authorized designation to a national memorial on July 9, 1952. The memorial was established by Harry S. Truman on November 5 of that year. As with all historic areas administered by the National Park Service, the national memorial was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966.

It had 300 boys and girls, which rose to 700 in 1950 and 900 by 1958. It was decided to split the school into two schools ‚Äì a boys' and girls'. This provoked protests from parents. In 1959, the school became Chadderton Grammar School for Girls with around 600 girls in the 1960s. The boys school, a grammar-technical school was on Chadderton Hall Road. =Comprehensive= It was renamed Mid Chadderton Comprehensive academy after grammar schools were abolished in September 1975, and the boys' school became the North Chadderton School. The two sites of the North Chadderton Secondary Modern School were split between the two new schools based on the former girls' and boys' schools.. In January 1976, the school pupils voted on a change of name. The name \\"Radclyffe\\" was taken from a local land owning family in the 19th century and at one time, had owned the land that the schools stood upon. Contrary to the aforementioned, pupils were not consulted as to the choice of name; rather the name was presented as a fete accompli through a rigged vote. However, the original torch badge was designed by pupils in a competition. The school was originally located across two sites ‚Äì the Lower School (Years 7‚Äì9) on Broadway and the Upper School (Years 10 & 11) on Hunt Lane. However, in 2008 a new state of the art school was built at the Hunt Lane site, housing both the lower and upper school students. The school has a successful Young Enterprise team which first garnered attention in 2007 after winning several awards including the New Start, New Stars Judges Award, Pride in Oldham Award and were Overall Winners at the Oldham Business Awards.

Oil on canvas.' Anna Rosalie Boch (10 February 1848 ‚Äì 25 February 1936) was a Belgian painter, born in Saint-Vaast, Hainaut. Anna Boch died in Ixelles in 1936 and is interred there in the Ixelles Cemetery, Brussels, Belgium. Artistic style Anna Boch, c. 1889, by Th√©o van Rysselberghe Boch participated in the Neo-Impressionist movement. Her early works used a Pointillist technique, but she is best known for her Impressionist style which she adopted for most of her career. A pupil of Isidore Verheyden, she was influenced by Th√©o van Rysselberghe whom she met in the Groupe des XX. Collection Besides her own paintings, Boch held one of the most important collections of Impressionist paintings of her time. She promoted many young artists, including Vincent van Gogh, whom she admired for his talent and who was a friend of her brother Eug√®ne Boch. The Vigne Rouge (The Red Vineyard), purchased by Anna Boch, was long believed to be the only painting Van Gogh sold during his lifetime. The Anna Boch collection was sold after her death. In her will, she donated the money to pay for the retirement of poor artist friends. Legacy 140 of her own paintings were left to her godchild Ida van Haelewijn, the daughter of her gardener. Many of these paintings show Ida van Haelewijn as a little girl in the garden. In 1968, these 140 paintings were purchased by her great nephew Luitwin von Boch, the CEO of Villeroy & Boch Ceramics. The paintings remained in the house of Ida van Haelewijn until her death in 1992. The Anna & Eug√®ne Boch Expo opened 30 March 2011. Some paintings were also donated by Anna Boch's will to various museums like the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium. Different exhibitions of her life and work were held at the at Morlanwelz, between October at December 2000 or in the Vincent van Gogh-huis in Hoogeveen in 2010. Her name is associated with famous museums like the Pushkin Museum in Moscow, the Mus√©e d'Orsay in Paris or the in Zundert, the Netherlands.

The song was introduced in the Broadway play Whoopee!, which opened in December 1928. Ruth Etting's performance of the song was so popular that she was also given the song to sing in the play Simple Simon, which opened in February 1930. Recorded versions =Major recorded versions= The original version of the song, the biggest-selling at the time, was recorded by Ruth Etting on December 17, 1928. It was issued by Columbia Records as catalog number 1680-D, with the flip side \\"I'm Bringing a Red, Red Rose\\", another Donaldson/Kahn composition. The song reached #2 on the charts in 1929. Other versions which also enjoyed popularity at this time were by Guy Lombardo's Royal Canadians, with a vocal by Carmen Lombardo (recorded March 20, 1929, released by Columbia Records as catalog number 1782D, with the flip side \\"I'm Still Caring\\") and by Leo Reisman and his orchestra (recorded April 22, 1929, released by Victor Records as catalog number 21966A, with the flip side \\"Sweet Chewaulka, Land of Sleepy Water\\"). A recording made on December 24, 1947 by Bing Crosby and John Scott Trotter's orchestra was released in 1951 by Decca Records as catalog number 27667. As the song was considered to be one of Etting's biggest hits, its title was chosen for the 1955 biographical movie about her life, in which Doris Day played Etting. Day's recording of the song, from the soundtrack, became a major hit for her. The same year, Sammy Davis Jr. and Lena Horne also experienced success with their versions of the song. Davis's version was released by Decca Records as catalog number 29484, with the flip side \\"Something's Gotta Give\\". It first reached the Billboard magazine charts on May 28, 1955 and lasted 12 weeks on the chart. On the Disk Jockey chart, it peaked at #20; on the Best Seller chart, at #12. (However, another source gives the highest position as #9, but lists this as a position for the combined two sides of the record, \\"Love Me or Leave Me\\" and \\"Something's Gotta Give.\\") Horne's was released by RCA Victor Records as catalog number 20-6073. It reached the Billboard magazine Disk Jockey chart on July 9, 1955, its only week on the chart, at #19. In the United Kingdom, it was released 1955 by HMV Records as catalog number B-309 (78rpm) and 7M-309 (45rpm),. Both releases were with the flip side \\"I Love To Love\\". Singer/pianist/songwriter Nina Simone also recorded the song on her debut album Little Girl Blue (1958) and Let It All Out (1966). The version was released as a single in 1959 by Bethlehem Records as catalog number 11021 and by Australian Parlophone Records as catalog number A-8008, with the flip side \\"I Loves You Porgy\\".

The mountains stretch more than 60 miles (100 km) in a northwest to southeast direction, and are located east of the Salton Sea and south and west of the Chuckwalla Mountains and the Colorado River. To the northwest lie the Orocopia Mountains. Geography The Chocolate Mountains form the northeast boundary of the Salton Trough extending as a narrow range some southeast from the Orocopia Mountains to the Colorado River valley.Singer, Eugene, Geology of the Imperial Valley The mountains are located about west of the Chocolate Mountains of Arizona, but the two ranges are not connected. The range reaches an elevation of 2,475 feet (754 m) at Mount Barrow, and serves as a drainage divide for the Salton Watershed to the west. The mountains receive very little rainfall in a normal year, typically 4-6 inches (100 to 150 mm). The predominant natural plants are of the creosote bush‚Äìwhite bursage community, and the mean annual temperature is about to . Geology The range is composed of Precambrian basement rocks and Orocopia Schist with Mesozoic granite intrusions. The range may have been formed by the collision of a microcontinental fragment with mainland Southern California during the Late Cretaceous. The collision is indicated by a thrust fault which emplaced Proterozoic and Mesozoic rocks of continental crust on top of the late Mesozoic Orocopia Schist which in turn was composed of oceanic sedimentary and volcanic rocks.Dillon, J.

A large part of the Chocolate Mountains lies within the gunnery range, and is closed to the public. Wilderness areas = Little Picacho Wilderness = At the southeastern end of the Chocolate Mountains range are two important wilderness areas. The first is the Little Picacho Wilderness, a 38,170 acre (154.5 km¬≤) region of geological features and habitat protection under the direction of the Bureau of Land Management. The preserve has within its boundaries the southern portion of the Chocolate Mountains. Elevations within this area range from 200 to . The topography, characterized by jutting spires and steep ridges, is quite dramatic. Ravines laced within the range gradually broaden into sandy, tree-lined washes. Slopes and plains are devoid of vegetation, instead covered with a desert pavement of angular cobbles. These rusty dark orange and brown colored cobbles stand out against the nearly white bottoms of the washes. It is also called the Little Picacho Peak Wilderness.Little Picacho.

Quartz Peak is the highest point in the wilderness capped at . Jagged peaks and spires are sliced by mazes of twisting canyons which carry water from occasional desert cloudbursts into several tree-lined washes. One of these washes passes through the heart of the wilderness area, giving rise to the region's local name, \\"Julian Wash country.\\" The area's proximity to the Colorado River and the Arizona Desert contribute to the presence of wildlife species not commonly found in the California Desert.Indian Pass.

These were designed, in 1887, by architect Henry Hudson Holly. The Edison laboratories operated for more than 40 years. Out of the West Orange laboratories came the motion picture camera, improved phonographs, sound recordings, silent and sound movies and the nickel-iron alkaline electric storage battery. Properties The park comprises two properties in West Orange: the second Edison Laboratories complex, and Edison's home in Llewellyn Park about to the west. The laboratory complex comprises the industrial facility built by Edison in 1887 to research and develop his inventions. The complex includes more than a dozen buildings that supported Edison's research into electricity, photography, motion pictures, chemistry, metallurgy, chemistry and other disciplines. A private library was attached to the main laboratory building. Specialty heavy and precision machine shops made tooling and prototypes. Edison's Queen Anne style home was designed by Henry Hudson Holly and built between 1880 and 1882 for Henry Pedder. It originally comprised 23 rooms. The mansion was built with gravity-convection central heat, indoor flush toilets, and hot and cold piped water. Pedder was found to have embezzled funds from his employer to build Glenmont, and was forced to surrender the estate, which Edison bought in 1886 for $125,000, moving in with his newly-married second wife Mina and his three children from his first marriage. The house retains its original furnishings in an Eastlake style interior. Edison added six more rooms, and electrical wiring. Edison's children with Mina grew up at Glenmont, including future New Jersey governor Charles Edison and industrialist Theodore Miller Edison History The history of how the site became a National Historical Park is complicated. Edison's home was designated as the Edison Home National Historic Site on December 6, 1955. The laboratory was designated as Edison Laboratory National Monument on July 14, 1956. On September 5, 1962, the site containing the home and the laboratory were designated the Edison National Historic Site and overseen by the National Park Service. On March 30, 2009, it was renamed Thomas Edison National Historical Park, adding \\"Thomas\\" to the title in hopes to relieve confusion between the Edison sites in West Orange and Edison, New Jersey. Following extensive renovations of the laboratory complex, there was a grand reopening on October 10, 2009. In popular culture A view of the interior of the industrial complex Glenmont, Edison's estate In 1996, the alternative rock band They Might Be Giants recorded four songs on phonograph cylinder at the museum.

Eisenhower, the 34th President of the United States, and its surrounding property of . It is located in Cumberland Township, Adams County, Pennsylvania, just outside Gettysburg. Purchased by then-General Eisenhower and his wife Mamie in 1950, the farm served as a weekend retreat for the President and a meeting place for world leaders, and became the Eisenhowers' home after they left the White House in 1961. With its putting green, skeet range, and view of South Mountain and the Gettysburg Battlefield, it offered President Eisenhower a much-needed respite from the pressures of Washington. It was also a successful cattle operation, with a show herd of black Angus cattle. Some of the more notable of Eisenhower's guests were Premier Nikita Khrushchev of the Soviet Union, President Charles de Gaulle of France, Prime Minister Winston Churchill of Britain, and Governor Ronald Reagan of California (who later became President himself). History Dwight D. (\\"Ike\\") Eisenhower had a long history with the Gettysburg area. His graduating class from West Point had visited the battlefield in 1915. In 1918, he was assigned to nearby Camp Colt in his first independent command as an army officer, commanding a tank training unit; he and Mamie Eisenhower were newly married.Walsh, Kenneth T. From Mount Vernon to Crawford (Hyperion, 2005) pp. 122‚Äì123Eisenhower Military Chronology U.S. National Park Service Throughout his long army career, Dwight Eisenhower and his wife never had a house to call their own, with the couple moving from army post to army post. After he became Columbia University's president in 1948, Mamie requested that they finally have a place to call their own. A married couple that were friends with the Eisenhowers, George and Mary Allen, had recently purchased a small farm around Gettysburg, and recommended the area. In 1950, they found a \\"run-down farm\\" on the outskirts of Gettysburg, and purchased the farm and its for $40,000 (equal to $ today) from one Allen Redding, who had owned the farm since 1921. Eisenhower stated that he could feel the \\"forgotten heroisms\\" that occurred on the grounds as the Battle of Gettysburg.Walsh p. 122The Presidents (Eisenhower National Historic Site) U.S. National Park Service When purchased, the included 600 chickens, 25 cows, and many dilapidated buildings dating back to the 18th and 19th centuries. Renovation of the property was delayed when Eisenhower became supreme commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1951. After he had attained the presidency of the United States in 1953, Mamie had him rebuild the old house. Much of the original building had to be torn down, due to its deterioration. The total cost of renovation was $250,000 (equal to $ today). This large expense was due partly to Mamie's whims, but also to Eisenhower's employment of union labor; he spent $65,000 (equal to $ today) for union workmen who came each day from Washington, D.C. ( away) to work on the farmhouse. On their 1955 wedding anniversary, the Eisenhowers held a party to celebrate completion of the work. The entire staff of the White House were invited, attending in two shifts, so that the White House would not be unstaffed. The staff were forever grateful to the Eisenhowers for including them in the festivities.Eisenhower National Historic Site - Eisenhower at Gettysburg U.S. National Park ServiceWalsh pp.122-124 From its completion in 1955 to the end of Eisenhower's second term on January 20, 1961, the President spent 365 days total on the Gettysburg farm. The longest of these stays was 38 days in late 1955, while recovering from a heart attack he had suffered that September. After 1955, the Eisenhowers spent most weekends and summer vacations at the Gettysburg farm. They sometimes went to both the Gettysburg farm and Camp David, prompting one person to call Camp David \\"an annex to Gettysburg\\".Walsh p. 126 The Gettysburg farm provided a few headaches. Democrats chose the amount of time the Eisenhowers spent at the Gettysburg farm as another way to attack him. Paul M. Butler, head of the Democratic National Committee, called him a part-time president due to his many stays in Gettysburg. When his World War II colleague Bernard Montgomery visited the farm, Eisenhower commented to Montgomery (speaking as military commander to military commander) that he would have fired a subordinate that would initiate Pickett's Charge. Many Southerners saw this as disrespect toward Robert E. Lee, and protested.Gettysburg Refought Time Magazine May 27, 1957 Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev visited the farm in September 1959, and was \\"grandfathery\\" to the Eisenhower grandchildren. David Eisenhower said that Khrushchev was such a nice guy, he (David) could become a Communist if he did not know better, causing much embarrassment to the Eisenhowers.Walsh pp. 126, 132, 133 The Eisenhowers donated their home and farm ( total at the time) to the National Park Service in 1967, with lifetime living rights for the former president. Two years later, Eisenhower died at the age of 78. Mamie Eisenhower rejected the idea of moving to Washington to be closer to family and friends and, with Federal permission, lived on the farm until her death in 1979, although the living area for Mamie was reduced to . The National Park Service opened the site in 1980. Grounds National Park Service illustration of the grounds of the site The plans for decoration and construction of the house were dictated by Mamie Eisenhower. At one point, Eisenhower told the contractor \\"For God's sakes, just give her what she wants and send me the bill.\\" His main concern was personally mixing the paint to recolor the barn, which had a red coat he thought was hideous, so he painted it a light gray- green. Mamie, meanwhile, was delighted in being able to use everything they always had in storage, and decorated more for sentimentality than for aesthetics.Walsh pp.123-125 Cattle were raised at the farm. Eisenhower would often poke the rump of a bull with his shotgun to show what quality of steak the animal would eventually produce, alarming the Secret Service agents that were protecting him. Once, while barbecuing (something he loved to do on the farm), he made the mistake of announcing which cow he was cooking. As it had been the favorite cow of his granddaughter Susan Eisenhower, she was brought to tears.Walsh pp.125, 132 A row of fifty Norway spruce trees lines the main driveway leading to the farm. These trees represent the fifty U.S. states, and were given to Eisenhower as birthday presents from each of the state Republican Party chairmen in 1955. The furthest one from the house was the tree representing Texas, and it was seen as a mark of Eisenhower's recovery that he was able to walk that far after his heart attack.Walsh p.127 The Eisenhowers (especially Dwight in the beginning) spent most of their time in a glass-covered porch overlooking Seminary Ridge. Reading and playing cards with friends were popular pastimes on the porch, it was said that he would sit for hours reflecting on his life and legacy.Walsh pp.126,127 Today The Eisenhower National Historic Site is open daily from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm, except for Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day.

The memorial is located in Straits State Park near St. Ignace in the modern-day U.S. state of Michigan, where he founded a Jesuit mission in 1671 and was buried in 1678. The associated Father Marquette Museum building was destroyed in a fire on March 9, 2000. History Fr. Jacques Marquette Marquette arrived in New France in 1666. Marquette established Michigan's earliest European settlements at Sault Ste. Marie and St. Ignace near Mackinac Island in 1668 and 1671. He lived among the Great Lakes Indians from 1666 to his death in 1675. During these nine years, Father Marquette mastered several native languages and joined Louis Jolliet in his expedition to explore and map a navigable route to the Pacific Ocean, which resulted in the French discovery of the Mississippi River. The Marquette and Joliet expeditions explored the Fox River, the Mississippi River as far as Arkansas, the Illinois River, and the Chicago River. They did not proceed to the mouth of the Mississippi due to hostility of the natives and fear of confronting Spanish colonials. In October 1674, Marquette and two companions set out on a missionary expedition. By the end of the year, he was afflicted with dysentery. He died near Ludington, Michigan while attempting to return to St. Ignace. The grave of Father Marquette was found to be located in downtown St. Ignace near the Ojibway Indian Museum on State Street. The site today Main building Subsequent to the destruction of the Marquette Memorial Museum by fire in 2000, the site contains exhibits and a fifteen-station interpretive trail. The main building is an open-concept wood structure with kiosks. Administrative history The memorial is owned and administered by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and is an affiliated area of the National Park Service. The national memorial was authorized on December 20, 1975. Unlike most national memorials, Father Marquette is not listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Located within the Davis Mountains of West Texas, the historic site was established in 1961 to protect one of the best remaining examples of a United States Army fort in the southwestern United States. History Established in October 1854 along the Limpia Creek at Painted Comanche Camp by Bvt. Maj. Gen. Persifor Frazer Smith, Fort Davis was named after Secretary of War Jefferson Davis.Wooster, R., Fort Davis, 1994, Austin: Texas State Historical Assoc.0876111398 \\"Hoping to protect the garrison from winter northers, Smith tucked the fort into a canyon flanked on three sides by sheer rock walls.\\" Commanding the post was 8th Infantry Regiment commander Lt. Col. Washington Seawell. Other forts in the frontier fort system were Forts Griffin, Concho, Belknap, Chadbourne, Stockton, Richardson, Bliss, McKavett, Clark, McIntosh, Inge, and Phantom Hill in Texas, and Fort Sill in Oklahoma.Carter, R.G., On the Border with Mackenzie, 1935, Washington D.C.: Enyon Printing Co., p. 48 \\"Sub posts or intermediate stations\\" also were used, including Bothwick's Station on Salt Creek between Fort Richardson and Fort Belknap, Camp Wichita near Buffalo Springs between Fort Richardson and Red River Station, and Mountain Pass between Fort Concho and Fort Griffin.Carter, R.G., On the Border with Mackenzie, 1935, Washington D.C.: Enyon Printing Co., p. 49 From 1854 to 1891, Fort Davis was strategically located to protect emigrants, mail coaches, and freight wagons on the trans-Pecos portion of the San Antonio-El Paso Road and the Chihuahua Trail, and to control activities on the southern stem of the Great Comanche War Trail and Mescalero Apache war trails. The fort was evacuated in April 1861 under orders from General David E. Twiggs at the start of the Civil War. During John R. Baylor's invasion of New Mexico, only 20 Confederate States Army troops manned the fort. On the night of 4 August 1861, Mescalero Apaches raided a nearby cattle pen, and during the pursuit on 11 August, Lt. Reuben E. Mays and all but one of his 13-man patrol were killed in an ambush. This defeat convinced Baylor to staff the fort with three officers and 70 enlisted men. The Confederates evacuated the fort and all other posts west of Fort Clark in August 1862. Fort Davis is important in understanding the presence of African Americans in the West and in the frontier military because the 24th and 25th U.S. Infantry regiments and the 9th and 10th U.S. Cavalry regiments, all-black regiments (known as the buffalo soldiers), which were established after the Civil War, were stationed at the post. Lt. Col. Wesley Merritt led Troops C, F, H, and I of the 9th Cavalry in reoccupying the fort on 29 June 1867. They rebuilt the fort, using limestone and adobe, outside the canyon walls. Preservation Today, 24 restored historic buildings and over 100 ruins and foundations are part of Fort Davis National Historic Site. Five of the historic buildings have been refurbished to the 1880s, making it easy for visitors to envision themselves being at the fort at the height of its development. A self-guided tour of the fort begins at the site's visitor center. Living history demonstrations are common during the summer. Fort Davis National Historic Site was authorized as a unit of the National Park System in 1961, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960. A memorial at Fort Davis honors the heroism of Indian Emily, the fictional subject of a popular legend. The actress Jolene Brand portrayed \\"Indian Emily\\", who saved the fort from an Apache attack, in the 1959 episode of the same name on the syndicated television anthology series, Death Valley Days, hosted by Stanley Andrews. Emily adopts the white man's ways but flees when a young officer, Tom Easton (Burt Metcalfe), whom she loves prepares to marry another. She returns to warn the fort of a pending Apache attack but dies of a gunshot wound fired in error. Meg Wyllie played Tom's compassionate mother, Mrs. Easton.

It was later replaced and the second fort was operated by the US until 1871. This site was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1961. The fort was the first site of the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas, which had jurisdiction over western Arkansas and all of Indian Territory. It began operations in 1875 with the appointment of Isaac C. Parker as the first federal district judge here. The town of Fort Smith, Arkansas developed around the fort.

History The site was established in 1961 in order to protect the remains of two 19th-century U.S. military forts, including a building that once housed the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas, which had jurisdiction over federal cases in Indian Territory. Fort Smith was also notable as a major stop for the Cherokee people along the \\"Trail of Tears.\\" during the period of Indian Removal from the Southeast. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961.Frank B. Sarls, Jr. (December 10, 1958) , National Park Service and The original fort was established on December 25, 1817 by Major William Bradford in order to maintain harmony between the local Osage Indians, who had long been dominant in this territory, and a band of Cherokee who had migrated west, under pressure from European Americans, from their traditional territory in the Southeast. This time would later be historically referenced as the \\"First Fort.\\" It ended in 1824 when the U.S. Army abandoned Fort Smith after constructing Fort Gibson further west. As a result of the increased tensions Indians following the Indian Removal Act of 1830, and local white settlers who encroached on their territory, the U.S. Army created a second Fort Smith in 1838 near the original's ruins. This is the beginning of the historical \\"Second Fort\\" period. During General Zachary Taylor's command of the fort in the 1840s, it became a supply depot for other forts within the Indian Territory. It was captured during the Civil War from Confederate forces in 1863 by Union troops. The majority of the Cherokee and other Five Civilized Tribes had initially allied with the Confederacy, and supplied warriors to its forces. The fort continued in use as a supply depot to other forts in the region until it was no longer occupied in an official capacity by 1871; historically the end of the \\"Second Fort\\" era. As often happened, a small town developed around the fort, with people attracted for business. In addition, court operations continued at a courthouse built in town for the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas, which presided over the western half of Arkansas and all of Indian Territory. It was first held at the fort, as noted above. The first federal district judge here was Isaac C. Parker, who presided over the court from 1875 to 1896.

Here Assiniboine, Crow, Cree, Ojibwe, Blackfoot, Hidatsa, Lakota, and other tribes traded buffalo robes and furs for trade goods including beads,De Vore, 1992 clay pipes,Sudbury, J. Byron, 2009.

At first, Indians traded beaver pelts for Euro-American goods because of the popularity of beaver hats in the East and in Europe. When silk and woolen hats became more popular during the 1830s, demand for beaver pelts decreased, and the trade shifted to bison robes.Historical Archaeology, 1990, pp. 1‚Äì2 During the historical period, Fort Union served as a haven for many frontier people and contributed to further economic growth on the American frontier. As headquarters for the American Fur Company, it played a primary role in the growth of the fur trade and allowed fur trade entrepreneurs to exert considerable influence in forming policies that affected the Indian nations of the region. The presence of the fort near the northern border of the United States also symbolized national sovereignty in the region.Historical Archaeology, 1990, p. 3 The fort maintained a large inventory of firearms that were traded with Indian tribes for furs. In turn, Indians used the firearms in hunting for furs and buffalo robes. Northern Plains Indians preferred the English-made \\"North West Gun,\\" a smooth-bore flintlock, because of its reputation for quality and reliability.National Park Service, Essay: Firearms of the Fur Trade, 2015 Conflicts between Euro-American traders and Indians were less frequent around Fort Union than conflicts between the Indian tribes themselves.National park Service, Essay, MacVaugh, 2017 However, during the summer of 1863, when many tribes along the Missouri River became openly hostile to whites, Fort Union was nearly under siege, and steamboats and their passengers were exposed to significant danger.Chittenden, 1903, Vol. II, p. 324 See also * Fort Buford, nearby site * Missouri-Yellowstone Confluence Interpretive Center * Fur trade in Montana * List of National Historic Landmarks in Montana * National Register of Historic Places listings in Roosevelt County, Montana * List of National Historic Landmarks in North Dakota * National Register of Historic Places listings in Richland County, North Dakota References Bibliography    * =Online sources= External links Fort Union Trading Post Historic Site at NPS.gov Category:IUCN Category III Union Category:History museums in North Dakota Category:Missouri River Category:Museums in Williams County, North Dakota Category:National Historic Landmarks in North Dakota Category:National Historic Landmarks in Montana Category:National Historic Sites in North Dakota Category:Native American museums in North Dakota Category:Pre-statehood history of North Dakota Category:Buildings and structures in Roosevelt County, Montana Category:Government buildings completed in 1829 Category:Protected areas of Williams County, North Dakota Category:Protected areas of Roosevelt County, Montana Category:Trading posts in the United States Category:Commercial buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in North Dakota Category:Protected areas established in 1966 Category:1966 establishments in Montana Category:1966 establishments in North Dakota Category:National Register of Historic Places in Williams County, North Dakota Category:National Register of Historic Places in Roosevelt County, Montana Category:American Fur Company Category:Forts along the Missouri River ","title":"Fort Union Trading Post National Historic Site"},{"id":"2152049","text":"Mashona may refer to: * Mashonaland, a region in northern Zimbabwe ** Mashona language, a Bantu language also known as the Mashona language ** Mashona people, a Bantu ethnic group also known as the Mashona people * Mashona mole- rat, a species of rodent in the family Bathyergidae * Mashona Washington, a retired tennis player from the United States * 1467 Mashona, a rare-type carbonaceous asteroid from the outer regions of the asteroid belt * HMS Mashona (F59), a Tribal-class destroyer of the Royal Navy that saw service in the Second World War  See also  * Shona (disambiguation) ","title":"Mashona"},{"id":"2152052","text":" øAbd al- øUzzƒÅ ibn  øAbd al-Mu·π≠·π≠alib laeen (), often known as Ab≈´ Lahab () (c. 549 ‚Äì 624) was Muhammad's half paternal uncle. He was one of the Meccan Quraysh leaders who opposed Muhammad and his followers and was condemned in the surah Lahab (Surah al-Massad) of the Quran for antagonizing Islam.  Family  He was born in Mecca c. 549, the son of Abdul Muttalib, chief of the Hashim clan, and the paternal grandfather of Muhammad. He was thus a paternal half-brother of Abdullah, father of Muhammad. His mother, Lubna bint Hajar,Ibn Hisham note 97. Translated by Guillaume, A. (1955). The Life of Muhammad p. 707. Oxford: Oxford University Press. was from the Khuza'a tribe. People from the Khuza'a tribe were the caretakers of the Ka'bah for several centuries, before the Quraysh took over the responsibility through their ancestor Qusai ibn Kilab. Abu Lahab was also related to Muhammad as half-uncle in another way, since Mu·∏•ammad's grandmother was FƒÅ·π≠imah bint ‚ÄòAmr of Banu Makhz≈´m clan. His original name was 'Abd al-'UzzƒÅ, but his father called him Ab≈´ Lahab (\\"Father of Flame\\") \\"because of his beauty and charm\\" due to his red (inflamed) cheeks.

Muattab, Durrah (Fakhita), 'UzzƒÅ and KhƒÅlida.Ibn Saad/Bewley vol. 8 p. 37 (all three daughters are listed here, with Umm Jamil named as their mother). Abu Lahab had another son, also named Durrah, who may have been born by another woman. He may also have been the father of Masruh, a son born to his slave Thuwayba. His daughter Durrah embraced Islam and became a narrator of Hadƒ´th. One is in Ahmad‚Äôs Musnad, where she reports that a man got up and asked the Prophet, ‚ÄúWho is the best of the people?‚Äù He answered, ‚ÄúThe best of the people is the most learned, the most godfearing, the most to be enjoining virtue, the most to be prohibiting vice and the most to be joining the kin.‚Äù ‚ÄòUtbah also embraced Islam after the conquest of Mecca and pledged allegiance to Mu·∏•ammad. = The Wa ·π¢abƒÅ·∏•ah (c. 613) = When Muhammad announced that he had been instructed by God to spread the message of Islam openly, the Quran told him to warn his kinsfolk about divine punishment. He therefore climbed Mount ·π¢afƒÅ and shouted: \\"Wa ·π£abƒÅ·∏•ah!\\" which means, \\"O [calamity of] the morning!\\" In Arabia this alarm was traditionally raised by any person who noticed an enemy tribe advancing against his own tribe at dawn. On hearing this, the inhabitants of Mecca assembled at the mountain. Muhammad then addressed the clans by name. \\"O Ban≈´ HƒÅshim, O Ban≈´ 'Abd al-Mu·π≠allib ... [and so on], if I were to tell you that behind this hill there is an enemy about to attack you, would you believe me?\\" The people responded that they would, since Muhammad was known to be honest. He continued saying: \\"Then I warn you that you are heading for a torment.\\" At this point, Abu Lahab interrupted: \\"Woe be on you the rest of the day! Is that what you summoned us for?\\" Another tradition recalls Ab≈´ Lahab picking up a stone to throw at his nephew.. Abu Lahab rejected the claims of Muhammad and said: \\"Muhammad promises me things which I do not see. He alleges that they will happen after my death; what has he put in my hands after that?‚Äù Then he blew on his hands and said, ‚ÄúMay you perish. I can see nothing in you of the things that Muhammad says.‚ÄùIbn Ishaq/Guillaume pp. 159-160. = The Sura of Abu Lahab = As a direct result of this incident, a chapter of the Quran, Al- Masad (\\"The Palm Fibre\\"), was revealed about him. Its English translation by Sahih International reads: In the name of Allah, the most compassionate, the most merciful (ÿ®ÿ≥ŸÖ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá ÿßŸÑÿ±ÿ≠ŸÖŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ±ÿ≠ŸäŸÖ) #Perish the two hands of Abu Lahab, and perish he, #His wealth will not avail him or that which he gained, #He will [enter to] burn in a Fire of [blazing] flame, #His wife [as well] ‚Äì the carrier of firewood (thorns of Satan which she used to put on the way of the Prophet). #Around her neck is a rope of twisted fiber (masadd). Umm Jamil is called ‚Äúthe bearer of the wood‚Äù because she is said to have carried thorns and cast them in Muhammad's pathway.Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 161. Being a next-door neighbor to Mu·∏•ammad, she also threw garbage over the wall into Muhammad's house. Abu Lahab had married two of his sons to the daughters of Mu·∏•ammad, 'Utbah to Ruqayyah and 'Utaibah to Umm Kulthum. However, the marriages were never consummated.Ibn Saad/Bewley vol. 8 p. 25. After the announcement of Al- Masadd, Abu Lahab told his sons: \\"My head is unlawful to your head if you do not divorce Muhammad's daughters.\\" They therefore divorced them.Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 314. Abu Lahab's daughter Durrah was at some stage married to Zaid ibn ·∏§arƒ´thah, who was at that time regarded as Muhammad's son, and they were later divorced; but the timing of this marriage and divorce is not known.Muhammad ibn Saad, Tabaqat vol. 3. Translated by Bewley, A. (2013). The Companions of Badr p. 32. London: Ta-Ha Publishers. Later, she married ·∏§ƒÅrith ibn Naufal of Banu HƒÅshim; and after his death, she married Dihya ibn Khalifa.Ibn Saad/Bewley vol. 8 p. 37. = Other acts of opposition (613‚Äì619) = When the Quraysh began to torture the Muslims, Abu Lahab's brother Abu Talib called upon the Hashim and Al-Muttalib clans to stand with him in protecting his nephew. It was a custom among the Arabs to staunchly support their own clan. Despite the dissension between Mu·∏•ammad and some members of Banu Hashim & Banu Mu·π≠·π≠alib, most of them stood by him in his predicaments and provided him protection and security except Abu Lahab.Ibn Ishaq p. 120. While Muhammad was praying near the Kaaba, Abu Jahl once threw the entrails of a sacrificed camel over him.Sealed Nectar Pg.52, Muhammad later told Aisha: \\"I was between two bad neighbours, Abu Lahab and Uqba ibn Abu Mu'ayt. They brought excrements and threw them before my door and they brought offensive material and threw it before my door.\\" Muhammad said he came out of his house, saying: \\"O sons of Abdumanaf! Is it the behaviour of a neighbour?\\" and threw the rubbish away. On the 7th year of preaching Islam, the Quraysh imposed boycott on Banu HƒÅshim & Banu Mu·π≠·π≠alib and forced them to live in a mountain gorge outside the city. Most of the members of Banu HƒÅshim had not accepted Islam at that time. Yet they stood by Mu·∏•ammad and suffered as much as he did. Abu Lahab was the only member of Banu HƒÅshim who supported the boycott and did not join his clan. Through a deep sense of animosity, Abu Lahab violated this ‚ÄòArab tradition and took the side of non-Muslim Quraysh clans. Abu Lahab renounced his affiliation with the Hashim clan and remained in Mecca. Soon afterwards, he met his sister-in-law, Hind bint Utbah, and said to her, \\"Haven‚Äôt I helped Al-Lat and Al-Uzza, and haven‚Äôt I abandoned those who have abandoned them and assisted their opponents?‚Äù She replied, ‚ÄúYes, and may god reward you well, O Abu Utba.‚ÄùIbn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 159.  Between the Boycott and Badr (619‚Äì624)  After the boycott was lifted, another nephew, Abu Salama, came to Abu Talib asking for protection. When the Makhzum clan protested about this, Abu Lahab supported his brother. He told the Makhzumites: ‚ÄúO Quraysh, you have continually attacked this shaykh for giving his protection among his own people. By God, you must either stop this or we will stand in with him until he gains his object.‚Äù The Makhzumites wanted to keep Abu Lahab's support, and therefore they agreed not to annoy Abu Salama. Abu Talib died in 620,Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 191. From this time, Muhammad went around the trade fairs and markets to tell the Arab tribes that he was a prophet and call them to worship Allah. Abu Lahab used to follow him around the fairs, saying, ‚ÄúThis fellow wishes only to get you to strip off Al-Lat and Al-Uzza from your necks and your allies of the Malik ibn Uqaysh tribe for the misleading innovation he has brought. Don‚Äôt obey him and take no notice of him.‚ÄùIbn Ishaq/Guillaume pp. 194-195. Someone reported: ‚ÄúBefore my own Islam I used to see the Prophet in markets outside Makkah calling out: ‚ÄòPeople, say there is no deity save Allah and you will prosper.‚Äô People would gather around him but a man, bright faced, intelligent looking, with two locks of hair (hanging down), would appear from the rear and say: ‚ÄòThis man has renounced the religion (of his forefathers). He is a liar.‚Äô He followed the Prophet wherever he went. The people would enquire who he was to learn that it was his (the Prophet's) uncle.‚Äô‚Äù Once Abu Lahab chased and hit Mu·∏•ammad with stones in one of those markets. He hit so hard that his feet began to bleed profusely and his slippers were filled with his own blood causing great pain and difficulty in walking. Muhammad and most of the Muslims left Mecca in 622, and Abu Lahab had no further direct interaction with his nephew.  Death  When the rest of the Quraysh went to Badr to protect the merchant-caravan carrying their property from an expected attack, Abu Lahab remained in Mecca, sending in his place Abu Jahl's brother al-‚ÄòƒÄ·π£ ibn HishƒÅm who owed him four thousand dirhams that he could not pay. So he hired him with them on the condition that he should be cleared off his debt.Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 291. The first people to reach Mecca with the news of the Quraysh defeat in the Battle of Badr were al-Haysuman and 'AbdullƒÅh ibn al-KhuzƒÅ'ƒ´, who bewailed the fact that so many of their chieftains had fallen on the battlefield. Abu Lahab went to the large tent of Zamzam, \\"his face as black as thunder\\". Before long, his nephew Abu Sufyan ibn al-Harith arrived, so he called him over for news. A small crowd gathered around the two as Ab≈´ SufyƒÅn told his uncle, \\"The facts are the Quraysh met our enemy and turned their backs. They [the Muslims] put us to flight, taking prisoners as they pleased. I cannot blame our tribesmen because they faced not only them but men wearing white robes riding piebald horses, who were between heaven and earth. They spared nothing, and no one had a chance.\\" At the other end of the tent, a Muslim freedman named Abu Rafi' and Abbas's wife Lubaba sat sharpening arrows. When they heard the news of the men in white riding between heaven and earth, they could no longer contain their happiness, and Abu Rafi exclaimed: \\"They were angels!\\" Abu Lahab was so furious that he forced the frail Abu Rafi' to the ground and beat him up. Lubaba grabbed a nearby tent pole and hit her brother-in-law over the head, crying: \\"Do you think that you can abuse him just because Abbas is away?\\" Lubaba wounded Abu Lahab so severely that his head was split open, laying bare part of his skull. The wound turned septic, and his entire body erupted into open pustules. He died a week later. This would have been in late March 624. The smell from Abu Lahab's wound was so repulsive that nobody could come near him. His family left his decaying body decomposing in his home for two or three nights until a neighbour rebuked them. \\"It is disgraceful. You should be ashamed of leaving your father to rot in his house and not bury him from the sight of men!\\" They then sent in slaves to remove his body. It was watered from a distance, then pushed with poles into a grave outside Mecca, and stones were thrown over it.Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 310. A Muslim narration says that after Abu Lahab's death, some of his relatives had a dream in which they saw him suffering in Hell. He told them that he had experienced no comfort in the Afterlife, but that his sufferings had been remitted \\"this much\\" (indicating the space between his thumb and index finger) because of his one virtuous deed of manumitting his slave Thuwayba, who had briefly suckled Muhammad.

Frederick Law Olmsted (1822‚Äì1903) is recognized as the founder of American landscape architecture and the nation's foremost parkmaker of the 19th century. In 1883, Olmsted moved his home to suburban Boston and established \\"Fairsted\\", the world's first full-scale professional office for the practice of landscape design. Over the course of the next century, his sons and successors expanded and perpetuated Olmsted's design ideals, philosophy, and influence. The site is located at 99 Warren Street, in the Green Hill section of Brookline. Olmsted bought the Clark homestead, an 1810 Federal farmhouse, in 1883, to be near his frequent collaborator, H. H. Richardson, whose home and office were nearby. Olmsted and his son John Charles renovated the house, landscaped the property, and relocated the barn closer to the house, and in 1903 added the office wing to the northwest of the main house. Members of the Olmsted family occupied the main house until 1936, when Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. moved to Elkton, Maryland, renting the house to tenants. The offices of the Olmsted Brothers firm continued to be in the wing during this time, although business also declined. Members of the firm reoccupied the house in the 1960s, making substantial alterations to the original landscaping of the property. The property was acquired by the National Park Service in 1980. The grounds have been restored to a c. 1930 appearance, restoring much of Olmsted's landscaping. Park resources include the restored \\"Fairsted\\" historic landscape, and the design office (which remains virtually unchanged from the days when the Olmsted firm's activity was at its height.) Housed within the office complex are nearly 1,000,000 original design records detailing work on many of America's most treasured landscapes, including the grounds of the U. S. Capitol and White House; Great Smoky Mountains and Acadia National Parks; Yosemite Valley; New York's Central Park; and whole park systems in cities such as Buffalo, Seattle, Boston, Louisville and Montreal. The Olmsteds also played an influential role in the creation of the National Park Service, which now owns and maintains the Olmsted site. Frederick Law Olmsted National Historic Site is open to the public. The Park Service offers guided tours of the grounds and office wing.

The station is owned by Entercom and airs a Top 40 (CHR) radio format. The station has studios at the intersection of Wilshire Boulevard and Hauser Boulevard in the Miracle Mile district of Los Angeles, and the transmitter on Mount Wilson. KAMP-FM broadcasts in the HD Radio format. The KAMP-HD2 subchannel carries \\"Channel Q\\", an LGBTQ-oriented talk/EDM format from Radio.com. KAMP-HD3 airs a non-stop dance mixshow format billed as \\"Fire Lane\\". KAMP is one of two top 40 stations in the Los Angeles area, the other being KIIS-FM (102.7 FM), which is owned by iHeartMedia. History =Early years= In 1954, the station signed on as KFMU and operated under those call letters during the 1950s and early mid-1960s. It was originally licensed to the Los Angeles suburb of Glendale and was owned by Nicolas M. Brazy.Broadcasting Yearbook 1957 page 61 KFMU aired an easy listening format known as \\"Good Music\\". The station was a subsidiary of Metropolitan Theatres Corp., which by 1959 was program testing KFMW in San Bernardino and held a permit for a KFMX in San Diego, as well as two other stations. In the late 1960s, KFMU was purchased by Storer Broadcasting and became home to KGBS-FM, as a sister station to KGBS (1020 AM). The two stations carried a country music format. Since its AM station was a daytimer, only authorized to be on the air during daylight hours, the FM station allowed the format to be heard around the clock, for those who had FM radios. In the early 1970s, the station experimented with rock and roll and pop music formats before switching to a soft country format in 1973, when it adopted the name \\"Gentle Country\\". In 1976, KGBS-FM continued with its country music format while its AM sister station switched to top 40. On August 28, 1978, the FM station changed its call letters to KHTZ while continuing with its country music format. On July 31, 1979, Storer, after having sold the AM radio station which was now known as KTNQ (Ten-Q), moved its top-40 format to 97.1 FM and began broadcasting as KHTZ (\\"K-Hits\\"). For a few hours, the two stations simulcast the signal until KTNQ switched to Spanish-language programming at noon. Within a few weeks, the station evolved into a more adult contemporary station. On November 27, 1985, the station changed its call letters to KBZT and was known as \\"K-Best 97\\". =Classic rock era = On September 26, 1986 at 3 p.m., the station was renamed KLSX and flipped to a classic rock format.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1980s/1986/RR-1986-10-03.pdf The call letters KLSX were chosen to sound like the word \\"classics\\". To demonstrate the vastness of the station's on-air library, KLSX advertised \\"no-repeat workdays\\", not playing any song more than once per day. Each day, the station played one song twice as part of a contest; listeners could win a prize for being the destination caller and identify correctly the intentionally repeated track. Additionally, KLSX hosted an annual \\"A‚ÄîZ\\" event where the entire library was played in alphabetical order by artist during weekday hours, a playlist that ran about 100 hours. Whenever the station played \\"Southern Man\\" by Neil Young, it was always followed by Lynyrd Skynyrd's \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\". In 1988, the long-running Beatles show Breakfast with the Beatles with host Deirdre O'Donoghue moved to KLSX from KNX-FM, a show which she began doing on KMET in 1983. After she died in 2001, the show was taken over by Chris Carter. On September 3, 2006, the station broadcast the last airing of Breakfast with the Beatles, which was then replaced by infomercials, drawing some local protest. Then-host Carter has stated that the departure of Howard Stern can be attributed to why the program was dropped. Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, and Yoko Ono have all called into the program. In late November 2006, local classic rock KLOS picked up the show. On July 21, 1991, the station began to air the syndicated Howard Stern Show, and took on the slogan \\"Howard Stern all morning, classic rock all day\\". =Hot talk era= On July 31, 1995, KLSX changed to a hot talk format on weekdays and went by the moniker \\"Real Radio 97.1\\", and had hosts such as Susan Olsen and Ken Ober, Scott Ferrall, Riki Rachtman, Kato Kaelin, Mother Love, Carlos Oscar, Voxx, and the Regular Guys (Larry Wachs and Eric von Haessler).http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1995/RR-1995-08-04.pdfhttps://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- Other-Documments/LA-Radio-Guide/LA-Radio-Guide-1995-09-10.pdf Howard Stern was critical of this format change and referred to it as \\"Hindenburg Radio\\". In 1996, the station dropped the \\"Real Radio\\" name and became known as \\"The FM Talk Station\\", hiring new hosts; the following year, the station began carrying the syndicated Tom Leykis Show, becoming its flagship station. On April 1, 2002, KLSX temporarily brought back Kaelin and the \\"Real Radio\\" slogans and jingles as part of an April Fools' Day joke. KLSX was owned by Greater Media until 1997, when Greater Media swapped KLSX and sister station KRLA for three stations: WMMR in Philadelphia and WBOS and WOAZ in Boston. The deal enabled Greater Media to operate larger clusters in these two markets while exiting Los Angeles. The swap led KLSX into the ownership of CBS Radio, where it joined radio stations KTWV and KCBS-FM. From 1995 until its acquisition by CBS in 1997, KLSX played alternative music on weekends. Instead of competing with its now-sister station, established modern rock outlet KROQ- FM, it was asked to switch to triple-A, a blend of album rock and alternative music that appealed to a 35-and-up age demographic). That format continued on weekends until 1999, when the talk format was expanded to weekends, leaving Sunday morning's Breakfast with the Beatles as the only program that played music. During that era and prior to being sold, KLSX boasted the only late- night talk shows in Los Angeles featuring women as hosts: Dr. X and subsequently a short-run of Shrink Rap. KLSX was also the local home of the syndicated novelty music program Dr. Demento. KLSX was the Los Angeles-area radio home of the Oakland Raiders of the National Football League. Previously, the station aired games from the Jones Radio Network's Sports USA service and NFL on Westwood One Sports. In 2001, it carried the Los Angeles Xtreme of the XFL. KLSX has also aired a sports year-in-review show from Westwood One. A number of changes came to KLSX in 2005. On October 25, it was announced that Adam Carolla would take over as the station's morning show host in January 2006 due to Howard Stern's departure to satellite radio. On that same day, the station also became known on-air as \\"97.1 Free FM\\"‚Äîso-called to highlight that its stations broadcast free-to-air, funded by commercials, whereas satellite radio requires a subscription fee. In addition to KLSX, CBS Radio introduced its Free FM branding on KSCF in San Diego, KIFR in San Francisco, and other hot talk-formatted outlets. Those three California stations carried The Tom Leykis Show and The John and Jeff Show. Locally, Tim Conway Jr. and comedy writer Doug Steckler co-hosted the evening show (The Conway and Steckler Show) until June 2005, when Steckler's contract was not renewed. Funnyman/impressionist Brian Whitman was brought in as Steckler's replacement, and the show was renamed The Conway and Whitman Show. The Frosty, Heidi, and Frank Show was picked up and, until January 2007, was syndicated to KSCF. In 2007, KLSX added Danny Bonaduce to The Adam Carolla Show (replacing sportscaster Dave Dameshek). In 2008, he was given his own (local) one-hour show following Frosty, Heidi & Frank, in a timeslot that had been vacant since the departure of entertainment reporter Sam Rubin in 2003. Also in 2008, Brian Whitman unexpectedly left the station in March. Tim Conway, Jr. ended up hosting the evening show alone. Arsenio Hall was a semi-regular guest host with Tim on the Tim Conway Jr. show on Wednesday nights in 2008‚Äì09. KLSX was the last station to use the Free FM branding, having abandoned the moniker in early October 2008, signaling the official desertion of the brand nationally by CBS Radio. The program director for KLSX at this time was Jack Silver. The assistant program director and creative voice of the station was Rich Boerner, who also programmed the weekend music formats. =Top 40 era = In early 2009, speculation arose on whether KLSX would be switching formats. On February 17, information started to emerge that KLSX was to drop hot talk on February 20 and flip to a top 40 format aimed at younger listeners, taking the \\"AMP\\" format that was created by KROQ-FM program director Kevin Weatherly and APD John Michael on KCBS-HD2. The station's main line up of The Adam Carolla Show, Frosty, Heidi & Frank, Danny Bonaduce (in a solo spot known as Broadcasting Bonaduce), The Tom Leykis Show, The Tim Conway Jr. Show and The John and Jeff Show were all given advance notice of the format shift and afforded the opportunity to host final shows to explain the situation and say their goodbyes. \\"97.1 FM Talk\\" ended on February 20 at 5 p.m. (Pacific time), giving longtime radio veteran Tom Leykis the final sign-off and the opportunity to \\"blow up\\" the station (in reference to a catchphrase used by the show's callers, \\"Blow me up, Tom!\\"). \\"AMP Radio\\" then launched with Paranoid by Kanye West (which coincidentally was also playing on its new rival KIIS-FM at the same time), beginning a commercial-free block of 10,000 songs, similar to the debuts of the current KDAY in 2004 and, in 1989, KQLZ (Pirate Radio). The launch of \\"AMP\\" marked the first top 40 radio battle in Los Angeles since KPWR switched to a hip hop-heavy rhythmic contemporary format in 1994. On June 30, 2009, the station changed its callsign to KAMP to go with the current format, and changed again on July 7, 2009 to KAMP-FM in order to avoid confusion with KAMP (AM), an unlicensed student-run radio station at the University of Arizona. On January 4, 2010, KAMP rounded out their on-air lineup, which featured Carson Daly in mornings, Chris Booker middays, Ted Stryker afternoons, and Casey McCabe at night. CBS Radio would later expand the \\"AMP Radio\\" brand to Detroit (WDZH), Boston (WODS), Orlando (WQMP), New York City (WBMP), Philadelphia (WZMP), and Dallas (KVIL). , all of these stations had dropped the \\"AMP Radio\\" brand and flipped to different formats, although the Philadelphia outlet has since returned to the top 40 format under a different branding. On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom. CBS Radio to Merge with Entercom The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on November 17. Entercom Completes CBS Radio Merger On July 28, 2017, Carson Daly left the station. The morning drive timeslot remained open until February 2018, when the station introduced a new morning show hosted by former WBMP New York morning host Edgar \\"Shoboy\\" Sotelo, former WWWQ Atlanta morning show co-host and comedian Brian Moote, and Billboard news correspondent Chelsea Briggs. Moote left the station in July 2019, while Sotelo left in October 2019. The departures would result in the on-air lineup being revised, making Booker move from afternoons to mornings, and adding former KPWR morning co-host Krystal Bianca to mornings, Christen Limon to middays, and Yesi Ortiz to afternoons, while McCabe remains as night host. Booker left the station on April 3, 2020. On March 30, 2020, KAMP-FM dropped \\"Radio\\" from their moniker and re-branded as \\"97.1 AMP\\". At some point later on in September it reverted back to 97.1 Amp Radio HD Radio KAMP-FM broadcasts in HD Radio with three digital subchannels. *KAMP-HD1 is a digital simulcast of the FM analog signal. *KAMP-HD2 carries \\"Channel Q\\", an LGBTQ- oriented talk/EDM format. *KAMP-HD3 airs a non-stop dance mixshow format billed as \\"Fire Lane\\". =History of KAMP-HD2= On January 8, 2018, Entercom entered a deal to bring the New York City-based dance/EDM webcast Pulse 87 to the Los Angeles airwaves as a HD2 subchannel of KAMP-FM, billing it as \\"Pulse 97.1 HD2\\".

Diffusionmeters using visible light are found in airports or along roads to measure horizontal visibility. Radar scatterometers use radio or microwaves to determine the normalized radar cross section (œÉ0, \\"sigma zero\\" or \\"sigma naught\\") of a surface. They are often mounted on weather satellites to find wind speed and direction, and are used in industries to analyze the roughness of surfaces.  Optical  Airport scatterometer (or diffusometer). Optical diffusionmeters are devices used in meteorology to find the optical range or the horizontal visibility. They consist of a light source, usually a laser, and a receiver. Both are placed at a 35¬∞ angle downward, aimed at a common area. Lateral scattering by the air along the light beam is quantified as an attenuation coefficient. Any departure from the clear air extinction coefficient (e.g. in fog) is measured and is inversely proportional to the visibility (the greater the loss, the lower is the visibility). These devices are found in automatic weather stations for general visibility, along airport runways for runway visual range, or along roads for visual conditions. Their main drawback is that the measurement is done over the very small volume of air between the transmitter and the receiver. The visibility reported is therefore only representative of the general conditions around the instrument in generalized conditions (synoptic fog for instance). This is not always the case (e.g. patchy fog).  Radar scatterometer  Radar scatterometer A radar scatterometer operates by transmitting a pulse of microwave energy towards the Earth's surface and measuring the reflected energy. A separate measurement of the noise-only power is made and subtracted from the signal+noise measurement to determine the backscatter signal power. Sigma-0 (œÉ‚Å∞) is computed from the signal power measurement using the distributed target radar equation. Scatterometer instruments are very precisely calibrated in order to make accurate backscatter measurements. The primary application of spaceborne scatterometry has been measurements of near- surface winds over the ocean. Such instruments are known as wind scatterometers. By combining sigma-0 measurements from different azimuth angles, the near-surface wind vector over the ocean's surface can be determined using a geophysical model function (GMF) which relates wind and backscatter. Over the ocean, the radar backscatter results from scattering from wind-generated capillary-gravity waves, which are generally in equilibrium with the near-surface wind over the ocean. The scattering mechanism is known as Bragg scattering, which occurs from the waves that are in resonance with the microwaves. The backscattered power depends on the wind speed and direction. Viewed from different azimuth angles, the observed backscatter from these waves varies. These variations can be exploited to estimate the sea surface wind, i.e. its speed and direction. This estimate process is sometimes termed 'wind retrieval' or 'model function inversion'. This is a non-linear inversion procedure based on an accurate knowledge of the GMF (in an empirical or semi-empirical form) that relates the scatterometer backscatter and the vector wind. Retrieval requires an angular diversity scatterometer measurements with the GMF, which is provided by the scatterometer making several backscatter measurements of the same spot on the ocean's surface from different azimuth angles.

Scatterometer measurements have been used to measure winds over sand and snow dunes from space. Non-terrestrial applications include study of Solar System moons using space probes. This is especially the case with the NASA/ESA Cassini mission to Saturn and its moons. Several generations of wind scatterometers have been flown in space by NASA, ESA, and NASDA.

A work, published by the journal Science in May 2004 with the title \\"Wind as a Long-Distance Dispersal Vehicle in the Southern Hemisphere\\", used daily measurements of wind azimuth and speed taken by the SeaWinds scatterometer from 1999 to 2003. They found a stronger correlation of floristic similarities with wind connectivity than with geographic proximities, which supports the idea that wind is a dispersal vehicle for many organisms in the Southern Hemisphere. =Semiconductor and precision manufacturing= Scatterometers are widely used in metrology for roughness of polished and lapped surfaces in semiconductor and precision machining industries.John C.

His father, Captain Richard Grant, was a Hudson's Bay Company employee, and therefore, in his mid-teens, he left for Fort Hall, Idaho, to meet up with his father. There he learned the trading business. However, in the 1840s the fur trade was dying out, so Johnny Grant and his brother James turned to trading with emigrants traveling west along the Oregon Trail. He made a considerable profit by trading travelers one healthy cow or horse for two trail-wearied ones. He then fed and rested the tired animals and the following season traded them again. This is how he got into the cattle business. Grant started using the Deer Lodge Valley in 1857 to graze his cattle during the winter along the banks of the Clark Fork river near Cottonwood creek. In 1859 he decided to permanently locate a ranch and constructed a permanent residence in 1862. He convinced traders to settle around him, forming the town of Cottonwood (later to become Deer Lodge). Johnny was initially successful, but found that when gold miners arrived in the area, he was at a disadvantage, because he spoke French and the newcomers spoke English. He was taken advantage of in contracts and felt that he could no longer be successful in the area. In August 1866, he sold his ranch to a cattle baron, Conrad Kohrs, for $19,200 and returned to Canada. Conrad Kohrs home ranch (1866‚Äì1887) Kohrs-Bielenberg ranch, c. 1880 Conrad Kohrs was born on August 5, 1835, in Wewelsfleth, in Holstein province, which was then a part of the German Confederation. At the age of 22, he became a citizen of the United States. He went to California during the gold rush days. He then moved on to Canada and arrived at the gold camps of Montana in 1862. He never struck gold, but he became wealthy by selling beef to the miners. Kohrs built his cattle operation until he owned 50,000 head of cattle and had grazing pasture of 10 million acres (40,000 km2). However, he had a setback when the severe winter of 1886‚Äì1887 left over half the cattle population in the northwest dead. Most cattlemen went bankrupt, but Kohrs managed to receive a 100,000 dollar loan from his banker, A. J. Davis. While the open range era was ending, Kohrs adapted successfully and was able to pay off the loan in only four years. Kohrs and his half-brother, John Bielenberg, turned to more modern methods of ranching, including buying purebred breeding stock, fencing his rangeland and raising and storing fodder. His became known as \\"Montana's Cattle King.\\" Bielenberg helped Kohrs to run the Grant‚ÄìKohrs ranch. He originally came to Montana at age 18 in 1864 to help with the butcher shop that served the mining camps. Bielenberg had a lot to do with the horse side of the Grant‚ÄìKohrs ranch. He bred what were called the \\"Big Circle\\" horses, reputed to be able to cover twenty miles of country in a half a day; a trait useful when gathering cattle spread over a very large area. Together, Bielenberg and Kohrs made a most successful team for over half a century. Decline of the open range and dissolution of the Kohrs‚ÄìBielenberg Ranch (1877‚Äì1922) The winter of 1886‚Äì1887 was one of the harshest on record in Montana. Ranchers using the open range for their herds lost upwards of 90% of their cattle to brutal cold and lack of feed. In Eastern Montana, temperatures hovered at 30‚Äì40 degrees below zero for weeks on end. The summer of 1887 witnessed a great many ranchers in Montana go out of business. Conrad K. Warren era (1922‚Äì1940) Warren Hereford ranch (1940‚Äì1958) Transfer to National Park Service Grant‚ÄìKohrs Ranch visitor center In the 1960s, the National Park Service, under the leadership of Director Conrad Wirth, reenergized the search for historic properties under the auspices of the Historic Sites Act of 1935 and Mission 66. The original Grant‚ÄìKohrs ranch was among several other ranches which were recommended for National Historic Landmark status. Con Warren wanted to sell the Grant‚ÄìKohrs portion of his ranch to the National Park Service as a historic landmark. In 1970 an agreement to sell the property to the park service was achieved with the proviso that it would be managed as a living ranch by the National Park Service. The original purchase involved of the active Warren Hereford Ranch. In December 1970, the National Park Foundation acquired an additional of the ranch allowing the National Park Service to take administrative control of the site. In August 1972, the U.S. Congress authorized the establishment of Grant‚ÄìKohrs Ranch National Historic Site to provide an understanding of the frontier cattle era of the Nation‚Äôs history, to preserve the Grant‚ÄìKohrs Ranch, and to interpret the nationally significant values thereof for the benefit and inspiration of future generations. In 1972 the National Park Foundation transferred ownership of its portions of the site to the National Park Service. Initially the site was administered under the jurisdiction of Yellowstone National Park. In 1972 the Grant‚ÄìKohrs Ranch National Historic Site was administratively listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Throughout the 1970s, the National Park Service continued to acquire acreage from Conrad Warren, rehabilitate elements of the ranch and provide improvements for visitation to include a visitor center, interpretive trails and access for the public. In 1974 the site became an independently operating unit of the National Park Service with its own superintendent, historian and budget. A formal dedication ceremony was held on July 17, 1977, and visitors were admitted to the new site., National Park Service operations Entrance to Grant‚ÄìKohrs ranch on the west side of the city of Deer Lodge; Powell County Fairgrounds visible in background The Grant‚ÄìKohrs National Historic Site today is operated by the National Park Service. It is a major tourist attraction in Deer Lodge, Montana, and the tour is free. The National Park Service runs it as a living history ranch, using draft horse teams to hay the land, and blacksmiths on site make horseshoes for the horses. They keep all operations as close to how they would be in the 19th century as possible. =Ranch properties= Aerial map of ranch site See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Powell County, Montana *List of National Historic Landmarks in Montana Notes  External links *National Park Service: Grant‚ÄìKohrs Ranch National Historic Site *Cowboys to Cattlemen: Grant‚ÄìKohrs Ranch National Historic Site, Virtual Museum Exhibit from National Park Service *Rep.

Homestead National Monument of America, a unit of the National Park System, commemorates passage of the Homestead Act of 1862, which allowed any qualified person to claim up to of federally owned land in exchange for five years of residence and the cultivation and improvement of the property. The Act eventually transferred from public to private ownership. The national monument is five miles west of Beatrice, Gage County, Nebraska on a site that includes some of the first acres successfully claimed under the Homestead Act. The national monument was first included in the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966 (ID 66000115). Homestead Heritage Center and Education Center The Homestead Heritage Center, dedicated in 2007, contains exhibits that treat the effect of the Homestead Act on immigration, agriculture, native tribes, the tallgrass prairie ecosystem, and federal land policy. The roof line of the center resembles a \\"single bottom plow moving through the sod,\\" and the parking lot measures exactly .Homestead NM website. A separate Education Center features science and social science presentations that can be shared with classrooms anywhere in the United States through distance-learning. Homestead NM website.

This restoration, which necessitates regular mowing, haying, and prescribed burns, has been managed by the National Park Service for more than 60 years and is the oldest in the National Park System.Homestead NM website; Rose Houk, Homestead National Monument of America (Fort Washington, PA: Eastern National, 2000), 37. Curiously, there is no legislative mandate in the enabling legislation for restoring the prairie. The park maintains about of hiking trails through the prairie and the woodland surrounding Cub Creek, accessible via all-terrain wheelchair.Homestead NM website The Homestead Heritage Center overlooks the 100 acres of restored Tallgrass prairie found at Homestead National Monument of America. A 3-mile trail system winding through the prairie allows further exploration of this ecosystem. Palmer-Epard Cabin Palmer-Epard Cabin In 1867, George W. Palmer built the Palmer-Epard Cabin from mixed hardwoods about 14 miles northeast of the Monument. It measures 14 x 16 feet and is representative of the local construction style. Palmer lived in the cabin with his wife and 10 children. Between 1875 and 1880, a 10 x 12 foot lean-to was added to the rear of the cabin, and the Palmers continued to live in it until 1895, when it was sold to nephews Eugene Mumford and William Foreman. A few years later, the farm was sold to Lawrence and Ida Mumford Epard, who lived in the cabin for nearly 40 years. The cabin was donated to the park in 1950 and has been moved and restored several times in intervening years.Houk, 35; Robert Tecklenberg, \\"Homestead National Monument of America: An Administrative History, 1962-1981,\\" 8; Homestead NM website. Freeman School The Freeman School. A historic one-room school at Homestead National Monument of America. The Freeman School, built of foot-thick red brick with carved limestone lintels, was the longest continuously used one-room school in Nebraska (1872‚Äì1967). The school also served as a Lutheran church, a polling place for Blakely Township, and a community center for debates, clubs, and box socials. The National Park Service restored the school to appear as it did during the 1870s.Houk, 39; Homestead NM website. The school may have been named either for Daniel Freeman or Thomas Freeman (no relation), a local bricklayer who likely made the bricks for the school. Both men served on the school board contemporaneously. The Freeman School was the focus of an early, influential judicial decision regarding separation of church and state. In 1899, Daniel Freeman sued the school board after a teacher, Edith Beecher, refused to stop praying, reading the Bible, and singing gospel songs in her classroom. In Freeman v. Scheve, et al. (1902), the Nebraska Supreme Court ruled that Beecher's activities violated provisions of the Nebraska constitution.Jeremy Patrick, \\"The Religion Provisions of the Nebraska Constitution: An Analysis and Litigation History,\\" Journal of the Law and Religion, 19 (2004), 331 ff. Administrative history Daniel Freeman (1826‚Äì1908), a native of Ohio, filed the first homestead claim in the Brownville, Nebraska land office on January 1, 1863. By the mid-1880s, Freeman also claimed to have been the first homesteader in the nation.See Charles Plante and Ray H. Mattison, \\"The 'First' Homestead,\\" Agricultural History, 36 (October 1962), 183-93. Freeman said that as a spy for the Union army, he had been suddenly ordered to St. Louis, and therefore convinced the land office registrar to let him file his claim just after midnight of the old year. There is no evidence to confirm Freeman's story; in fact, there is no record of Freeman ever having served in either the army or the Secret Service. Freeman eventually amassed more than and became a prominent citizen of Gage County. As early as 1884, he first proposed the idea of memorializing himself as the earliest homesteader, and shortly after his death in 1908, Beatrice residents talked of preserving his homestead as a national park.Ray H. Mattison, \\"Homestead National Monument: Its Establishment and Administration,\\" Nebraska History, 43 (March 1962), 7. Proposals to create such a park were rejectedAt the time, national parks were effectively limited to places of \\"extraordinary‚Ä¶beauty, freaks of nature, geysers, etc.\\" Beatrice Daily Sun, January 28, 1911, quoted in Mattison, 9. until during the mid-1920s, the influential Senator George W. Norris suggested a historical museum of agricultural implements be established on the Freeman property and the local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution dedicated a marker there.Mattison, 9-10. In 1934, Beatrice citizens organized the National Homestead Park Association,Friends of Homestead National Monument of America is a lineal descendant of this private group. See Friends of Homestead, ‚ÄúOur History,‚Äù website. reinvigorating the movement. In 1935, Norris and newly elected congressman Henry C. Luckey of Lincoln introduced legislation to create the park, which eventually became law in March 1936. But federal funding for the purchase was not obtained until March 1938. Negotiations with the Freeman heirs \\"dragged on for months over the value of the land,\\" and condemnation proceedings were instigated to bring them to terms. The government took possession at the end of the year.Mattison, 16-24. A few improvements were made to the site before American entrance into World War II effectively ended both visitation and development. In the 1950s, the National Park Service acquired the Palmer-Epard cabin and built a visitor center as part of its Mission 66 program.Mattison, 26-27. A small museum there exhibited some of the artifacts donated to the park by the Gage County Historical Society in 1948.Robert Tecklenberg, \\"Homestead National Monument of America: An Administrative History, 1962-1981,\\" 2. By 1981 the national monument had five permanent employees, one part-time employee, and some seasonal personnel.Tecklenberg, 17. In the 1970s and '80s, seasonal rangers presented living history demonstrations, although many of their activities were later viewed as \\"not historically accurate for the homestead era\\" and \\"more reminiscent of the Appalachian hill country than prairie homesteads.\\"L. S. Lange, \\"Homestead National Monument of America: A Half Century of Interpreting Prairie History,\\" Journal of the West, 38 (January 1999), 31. By the 1990s, the NPS had limited funding for such interpretation, and the monument began to extend the story of the Homestead Act to other regions of the country. Under Superintendent Mark Engler, a Beatrice native, the national monument dedicated the Homestead Heritage Center in 2007 with more interactive displays that treated the Homestead Act from a broader prospective, a change symbolized in part by a \\"Living Wall\\" at its entrance with a physical representation of the percentage of land successfully homesteaded in each state.Homestead NM website.

It is considered a meeting ground of two cultures between the Navajo and the settlers who came to the area to trade. History In 1878, John Lorenzo Hubbell purchased this trading post, ten years after Navajos were allowed to return to the Ganado region from their U.S.-imposed exile in Bosque Redondo, Fort Sumner, New Mexico. This ended what is known in Navajo history as the \\"Long Walk of the Navajo.\\" It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1960. Navajo people When the Navajos returned from The Long Walk in 1868, they found their herds decimated, their fields destroyed. Their way of life was ripped apart and their life was forever changed. The Navajos were troubled by an economic depression in the late 19th century as a result of the Long Walk. Thus, trade became increasingly important. Heavy sandstones from the area were quarried in 1883 to begin construction of this solid building along the southern banks of the Pueblo Colorado Wash. Life at Hubbell Trading Post centered around it. The idea of trading was not new to the Navajos. Native American tribes in the Southwest had traded amongst themselves for centuries. During the four years' internment at Bosque Redondo, Navajos were introduced to many new items (e.g., flour, sugar, coffee, baking powder, canned goods, tobacco, tools, cloth, etc.). When the Anglos came to trade with the Navajos, the difference was in the products exchanged, and in the changes brought about by these exchanges. Traders like Hubbell supplied these items. Trade with men like Hubbell became increasingly important for the Navajos. The trader was in contact with the world outside the newly created reservation; a world which could supply the staples the Navajos needed to supplement their homegrown products. In exchange for the trader's goods the Navajos traded wool, sheep and, later, rugs, jewelry, baskets and pottery. It was years before cash was used between trader and Navajos. Interior of residential area which may be visited on free Park Service guided tour Old baskets on the ceiling Inside the active trading post showing rugs for sale Hubbell family members operated this trading post until it was sold to the National Park Service in 1967. The trading post is still active, operated by the non-profit Western National Parks Association, which maintains the trading traditions the Hubbell family established. Today, Hubbell Trading Post National Historic Site is still situated on the original homestead, which includes the trading post, family home, out buildings, land and a visitors center. Visitors can experience this historic trading post on the Navajo Nation, which includes weaving demonstrations; and the store still maintains a wooden floor and walls from the days of old. A set of initials carved on the gate of the privacy wall which separates the public spaces from the private stand for John Lorenzo Hubbell. Hubbell and a weaver in front of the post in the 1890s Hubbell's life Hubbell's father was Anglo, his mother Spanish. He was raised in Pajarito Mesa, New Mexico, a small village just south of Albuquerque, New Mexico. He came to this area in 1876, less than ten years after the Long Walk. In 1878 he bought the small buildings comprising the compound from a trader named William Leonard, and started business. He was twenty-three years old, single and trying to make a living among the Navajos, a people he did not know very well. He had to find a niche in a new culture, a difficult language. He probably learned \\"trader Navajo\\" very quickly. John Lorenzo was trilingual. He spoke English, Spanish and Navajo. Mr. Hubbell married a Spanish woman named Lina Rubi. They had two sons and two daughters. Additions to the family home to accommodate the growing family were finished in 1902. It started out as a plain adobe building which the Hubbell family gradually made into a comfortable, and in some ways, luxurious home. Paintings and artifacts and many large Navajo rugs still decorate the interior. Unlike other traders who left their families \\"back home\\" in the east, the entire Hubbell family spent most of the year in the village of Ganado. The Hubbells lived in the house until 1967. The guest house was built in the early 1930s by Roman and Dorothy Hubbell, Mr. Hubbell's son and daughter-in-law, as a tribute to Mr. Hubbell. Dorothy Hubbell carved the inner wooden door. Visitors stayed in the Hubbell home, such as artists who were interested in the color and shapes of the land; anthropologists who came to Mr. Hubbell for information; statesmen; friends of the family; and ordinary travelers in need of a place to stay. Architecturally, the guest house is in the Hogan (pronounced hoe-gone) (Navajo for home) style. Most hogans are built of logs, and the door always faces the east. Hogans are one-room dwellings and usually have six or eight sides. Mr. Hubbell built several traditional hogans on the grounds for the Navajos who came long distances to trade. The guest house was originally called Pueblo Colorado (the inscription over the door) but often was confused with the town of Pueblo, Colorado. There was an important Navajo leader named totsohnii Hastiin (pronounced Toe-so-knee haaus-teen) (Navajo for \\"man of the big water clan\\"). He was also called Ganado Mucho (pronounced gah-nah-doe-moo-cho) (Spanish for \\"many cattle\\") and Mr. Hubbell renamed this place Ganado for him. Ganado Mucho had a son, Many Horses, who is buried on the property. Beyond the perimeter wall to the north courses the Pueblo Colorado Wash, the northern boundary of the Hubbell settlement. In some sections of the Ganado-Cornfields valley, the wash is spring-fed and runs year round. Melting snows in spring and heavy summer rains sometimes cause it to flood. In the Southwest a good source of water has always attracted people. The Anasazi (pronounced Ah-na- eeh-son-ni) (Navajo for \\"the ancient ones\\") lived in small villages up and down the valley hundreds of years ago. The Navajos came later, and then the traders - all attracted to the source of water. The cone-shaped hill located northwest of the trading post is Hubbell Hill. The family cemetery is at the top. Mr. Hubbell, his wife, three of his children, a daughter-in-law, a granddaughter, and a Navajo man named Many Horses are buried there. Many Horses was one of the local herdsmen and the son of Ganado Mucho. He and Mr. Hubbell were close friends for many years. Mr. Hubbell maintained a friendship with many of his customers until his death in 1930. Then his younger son Roman operated the business. When Roman died in 1957, his wife Dorothy managed the store for another ten years, until 1967 when the National Park Service acquired the site. Built with juniper logs upright in the ground, the corrals of the trading post held lambs and sheep purchased from Navajo stockmen by Mr. Hubbell. The flocks stayed in the corral complex until they could be herded to the railroad. From time to time Mr. Hubbell kept beef cattle as well. Mr. Hubbell homesteaded before they were part of the reservation and territory. When the reservation expanded, it surrounded the Hubbell property. Through an act of Congress Mr. Hubbell got permission to keep his home. Freight wagons brought supplies fifty-six miles to the store from the little railroad town of Gallup, New Mexico, two to four days' travel in good weather. Going back to Gallup, freight wagons hauled huge sacks of wool. Construction Construction of the trading post barn began in 1897. The builders, local people, made the walls of local sandstone and the roofs fashioned in the ancient Anasazi-style dwellings. Ponderosa pine beams, aspen poles, juniper bark, cornstalks, and dirt make up layers, each at right angles to the one below it. Mules and pulleys lifted the beams into place. The timbers came from about twelve miles (19 km) east of Ganado Village where it is high enough for Ponderosa to grow.

Background Lumley was the son of Brigadier General Osbert Lumley, youngest child and son of the 9th Earl. He attended Eton College and Magdalen College, Oxford. Career Lumley followed his father into the military, passing out from the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 11th Hussars on 26 January 1916, and was promoted to lieutenant on 26 July 1917. He served in France during World War I. He was demobilised on 3 June 1919, with the rank of lieutenant, but retained a reserve lieutenant's commission in the 11th Hussars, as well as being attached to the Yorkshire Dragoons. From 1920 to 1921, he was attached to an Officer Training Corps (OTC) University Contingent, with the local rank of captain. Lumley sat in the House of Commons as Member of Parliament (MP) for Kingston upon Hull East 1922‚Äì29, then York 1931‚Äì37. In 1923 he was Parliamentary Private Secretary to William Ormsby-Gore, from 1924‚Äì26 to Sir Austen Chamberlain and subsequently to Anthony Eden. On 8 March 1931, he was promoted to captain in the reserves in both the 11th Hussars and the Yorkshire Dragoons. He was brevetted to the rank of major in the Yorkshire Dragoons on 1 January 1937, and was awarded the Efficiency Decoration on 11 May. In 1937, he was appointed Governor of Bombay, serving until 1943, when he was appointed Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India. Upon his return from India, Lumley served as acting Major-General in World War II. Following the War, he continued his connections with the Army, as an honorary colonel. He succeeded to the Earldom of Scarbrough in 1945 following the death of his uncle. He served as Lord Chamberlain from 1952 to 1963 and chancellor of the University of Durham from 1958 to 1969. He was made a Knight of the Garter in 1948. Outside politics, the Earl had a keen interest in Asian and African studies. He presided over the Interdepartmental Commission of Enquiry on Oriental, Slavonic, East European and African Studies set up after the Second World War to consider how Britain might maintain and increase the links it had built up during the war in the geographical areas under the Commission's consideration. The Commission's report, presented in 1947, argued for considerable strengthening of university departments' capacity to carry out research and training related to these areas, and for significant funds to be made available to this end. However, after five years of strong growth following the presentation of the Scarbrough report, in 1952 much of the funding was withdrawn. Lumley was initiated into freemasonry on 3 May 1923 in Apollo University Lodge No 357 in Oxford. From 1951 to 1967 he served as the Grand Master of the United Grand Lodge of England.

Court Ladies Playing Double Sixes, attributed to Zhou Fang. Zhou Fang (; c. 730‚Äì800), courtesy name Zhonglang (), was a Chinese painter during the Tang dynasty. Zhou lived in the Tang capital of Chang'an, which is now modern Xi'an, during the 8th century. He came from a noble background and this was reflected in his works, such as Court Ladies Adorning Their Hair with Flowers (attributed) and Court Lady With Servants. He was influenced by the pure and detailed style of Gu Kaizhi and Lu Tanwei from the Six dynasties in his work. The late Tang art critic Zhu Jingxuan said: \\"Zhou Fang's Buddha, celestial beings, figures, and paintings of beautiful women are all incredible masterpieces.\\" Zhou was an important figure in the Tang Dynasty after fellow Tang dynasty painter Wu Daozi. He was a famous religious and character painter, and the most famous painting Zhou created is a Buddhist image called \\"Water Moon Goddess of Mercy\\". His Buddhist painting has become a long-standing popular standard, known as \\"Zhou Jiaxiang\\". Zhou Fang's artistic activity is long, up to three or four decades, that is, the calendar to Zhenyuan years (766-805), its activities mainly concentrated in Chang'an and Jiangnan two places. Due to his official career and aristocratic status, Zhou lived and worked with many notabilities. Therefore, he had the opportunity to accept Zhang Xuan's painting theme and artistic techniques. Zhou Fang's style and Zhang Xuan's style of the traces are so similar so that later generations have to distinguish between the small different of the color stained on ladies. Most of Zhou Fang's works have been lost, but the title can still be seen from the general content, such as: You spring, cooking tea, railing, flute, dance crane, lap, flute, Go and other names of the ladies figure. In the Tang Dynasty, his works were very popular among the Korean. Until today, we can still find Zhou Fang style's ancient ladies painting in Japan. The image of the abundance of women in the Tang Dynasty is widely popular, which is even found in Xinjiang Turpan Tomb. See also *Zhang Xuan, another significant painter of the middle Tang dynasty.

Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail. The Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail is a National Park Service unit in the United States National Historic Trail and National Millennium Trail programs. The trail route extends from Nogales on the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona, through the California desert and coastal areas in Southern California and the Central Coast region to San Francisco.http://www.nps.gov/juba/ de Anza National Historic Trail . 9/9/2010 The Trail commemorates the 1775‚Äì1776 land route that Spanish commander Juan Bautista de Anza took from the Sonora y Sinaloa Province of New Spain in Colonial Mexico through to Las Californias Province. The goal of the 1775‚Äì1776 trip was to establish a mission and presidio on the San Francisco Bay. The trail was an attempt to ease the course of Spanish colonization of California by establishing a major land route north for many to follow. It was used for about five years before being closed by the Quechan (Yuma) Indians in 1781 and kept closed for the next 40 years. History Map of the route Juan Bautista de Anza travelled in 1775‚Äì76 from Mexico to today's San Francisco via the Gila River corridor and the Yuma Crossing of the Colorado River. Mojave and Sonoran deserts block easy land travel to California. The easiest way across was to use the Gila River corridor. Typical sand dunes west of Yuma, Arizona = 1st California Trip = Juan Bautista de Anza leading an exploratory expedition on January 8, 1774, with 3 padres, 20 soldiers, 11 servants, 35 mules, 65 cattle, and 140 horses set forth from Tubac Presidio, south of present-day Tucson, Arizona. They went across the Sonoran desert to California from Mexico by swinging south of the Gila River to avoid Apache attacks until they hit the Colorado River at the Yuma Crossing‚Äîabout the only way across the Colorado River. The friendly Quechan (Yuma) Indians (2,000-3,000) they encountered there were growing most of their food using irrigation systems and had already imported pottery, horses, wheat and a few other crops from New Mexico. After crossing the Colorado to avoid the impassable Algodones Dunes, they followed the river about to approximately Arizona's southwest corner on the Colorado River. There Anza turned westward following along a seasonal dis-tributary river of the Colorado until it turned northwest near present-day Mexicali, Mexico and then turned north through present-day Imperial Valley. Anza then turned northwest again crossing the remaining desert and mountains before reaching the coastal valleys of Southern California and the Mission San Gabriel Arc√°ngel near the future city of Los Angeles, California. The Pueblo de Los Angeles would be established in 1781 by eleven families recruited mostly from Sonora y Sinaloa Province. It took Anza about 74 days to make this initial reconnaissance trip to establish a land route into California. On his return trip he retraced his path to the Yuma Crossing of the Colorado River and then went down the Gila River corridor until reaching the Santa Cruz River (Arizona) corridor and continuing on to Tubac, Arizona. The return trip only took 23 days as he now had found a trail with sufficient water to make land access to California possible. On the Gila River, he encountered several extensive villages of Pima (Akimel O'odham) Indians. These were a peaceful and populous agricultural tribe with extensive crops and irrigation systems located along the river.Guerro, Vladimir; \\" The Anza Trail: The Settling of California\\"; Heyday Books; (2006); Map of the drainage basin of the Gila River in Arizona, New Mexico and Sonora in the United States and Mexico. = 2nd California Trip = In Anza's second trip (1775‚Äì1776) he returned to California via the Gila River path he had discovered with 240 friars, soldiers and colonists with their families. They took 695 horses and mules, 385 Texas Longhorn bulls and cows with them‚Äîstarting the cattle and horse industry in California. In California, the cattle and horses had few enemies and plentiful grass in all but drought years and essentially grew and multiplied as feral animals, doubling roughly every two years. They started from Tubac Arizona on October 22, 1775 and arrived at San Francisco Bay on March 28, 1776. There they established the Presidio of San Francisco, followed by Mission San Francisco de As√≠s (Mission Dolores) ‚Äì the future city of San Francisco, California. In 1779, Father Francisco Garc√©s was assigned to establish a mission at Yuma crossing of the Colorado River. In 1780, the Spanish established two combination missions and pueblos at the Yuma Colorado River Crossing of the Anza trail: Mission San Pedro y San Pablo de Bicu√±er and Mission Puerto de Pur√≠sima Concepci√≥n. Both these pueblos and missions were on the California side of the Colorado River near the mouth of the Gila River but were administered by the Arizona authorities. The settlement of Los Angeles, California involved two groups totaling 44 persons including 22 children. One group under Alf√®rez Ramon Laso de la Vega crossed the Gulf of California on launches and then travelled overland to San Diego and up to the San Gabriel Mission.Bancroft, Hubert Howe. 1886. History of California. 7 volumes. San Francisco: History Company.\\" available one-line The second group, under Fernando Rivera y Moncada, took an overland route over the Anza trail through the desert from Sinaloa Mexico. They passed through the new missions on the Colorado River, Mission Puerto de Pur√≠sima Concepci√≥n and Mission San Pedro y San Pablo de Bicu√±er. The group arrived at the Colorado River in June 1781. Rivera y Moncada sent most of his party ahead, but he stayed behind to rest the livestock before continuing their drive across the desert. His party would never reach San Gabriel. In July, Rivera was killed along with the local missionaries, settlers, and travelers with the revolt of the Quechan Indians (Yuma Revolt) in 1781. The Quechan and Mojave Indians rose up against the party for encroaching on their farmlands and for other abuses inflicted by the soldiers. On July 17-19, 1781, the Yuma (Quechan) Indians, in a dispute with the New Spain government and church, destroyed both missions and pueblos ‚Äì killing 103 soldiers, colonists and Friars and capturing about 80 more (mostly women and children). Included in the casualties were Fernando Rivera y Moncada military commander and former governor of California and Father Francisco Garc√©s founder of the missions on the Colorado River. In four well-supported punitive expeditions in 1782 and 1783 against the Quechans, the Spanish managed to gather their dead and ransom nearly all the prisoners but failed to re-open the Anza Trail. The Yuma Crossing and the Anza trail were closed for Spanish traffic and would stay closed until the late 1820s. As a result, California was nearly isolated again from land-based travel, and about the only way into California from Mexico would now be a 40- to 60-day voyage by sea.Santiago, Mark; \\"Massacre at the Yuma Crossing: Spanish Relations with the Quechans, 1779‚Äì1782\\"; University of Arizona Press (2010); According to historian David Weber, the Yuma revolt turned California into an \\"island\\" and Arizona into a \\"cul de sac\\", severing Arizona-California and Mexican land connections before they could be firmly established. Modern touring Along the Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail route, visitors can experience the varied landscapes similar to those the expedition saw; learn the stories of the expedition's events, members, and descendants; better understand the Native American diversity of cultures in their homelands and their guidance on the expedition; and appreciate the extent and lasting influences of Spanish colonial settlements in present-day Arizona and California. The Trail was designated a National Historic Trail in 1990 and a National Millennium Trail in 1999. In 2005, Caltrans began posting signs on roads that overlap with the trail route so that California drivers could follow the trail. =Designated sites= The National Park Service has developed a printed and online: Brochure Map for driving and guides for auto tours, hiking sections, and designated Historic sites, landmarks, and museums open to the public. Schedules of Anza celebrations and other historic events are on an updated NPS: What to Do-Events Guide. The detailed Anza Trail Maps by County show more points of interest, trailheads, and local lore. =Growth= The Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail \\"project\\" is growing as local, state, and NPS efforts establish more trails, signage, and interpretive programs. The Trail is inspiring activities at existing municipal parks, neighborhood greenbelts, regional parks, and large open space preserves. Such opportunities can be discovered and tracked at the official Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail website. =Gallery= File:Jbda-trail-az-1.jpgCottonwood tree along Santa Cruz River on Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail.

This area was a major trading and agricultural area. Three villages were known to occupy the Knife area. In general, these three villages are known as Hidatsa villages. Broken down, the individual villages are Awatixa Xi'e (lower Hidatsa village), Awatixa and Big Hidatsa village. Awatixa Xi'e is believed to be the oldest village of the three. The Big Hidatsa village was established around 1600. Geography The Knife River Indian Villages National Historic Site is located in central North Dakota, at the confluence of the Knife River with the Missouri River. The village is located ¬Ω mile north of present-day Stanton, North Dakota, 1 hour north west of Bismarck, and 1 ¬Ω hours south west of Minot, North Dakota. The Knife River is a tributary to the Missouri River. Scenic sights such as broad plains, river bluffs, and river bottom forests can all be seen along the two rivers. The national park borders both sides of the Knife River, and is made up of a forested peninsula along the length of the river. The Missouri River is known as the \\"Big Muddy\\" due to its high sedimentation loads. The Missouri River drains approximately one-sixth of the United States and its basin encompasses . During the pre-development period, the Missouri River represented one of North America's most diverse ecosystems. History =Village= Interior of the Earth LodgeAt the Knife River Indian Villages National Historical Site, there are the visible remains of earth-lodge dwellings, cache pits, and travois trails. The remains of the earth-lodge dwellings can be seen as large circular depressions in the ground. These dwellings were as large as in diameter. Many were once large enough to house up to 20 families, a few horses, and dogs. The dwellings were constructed at ground level. As the dwellings were abandoned, the walls and roof collapsed and created the visible outer circular rim. Sakakawea (Sacagawea) lived in one of the villages of the Knife River. The presence of Sakakawea and her son on the Lewis and Clark expedition was extremely crucial to the safety of the party and the success of their mission. In addition to her ability to translate for them, tribes who encountered the party believed that the presence of the young woman and child indicated they were not a threat. This is due to the fact that war parties did not allow women and children to accompany them. The Knife River Villages served as an important major central trading and agricultural area. The Native Americans served as middlemen in a trading area that stretched from Minnesota, to the Great Plains and Gulf Coast, and the Northwest Pacific Coast. Their trading business largely consisted of furs, guns, and metals such as copper, but the Hidatsa and Mandan traded corn and other agricultural products. =Smallpox epidemic= The Knife River villages thrived until 1837, when a series of smallpox outbreaks nearly wiped out the population; they suffered a 50% loss in population. Gradually survivors of the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara villages migrated north and developed the village of Like-a-Fishhook. The smallpox outbreaks from 1837‚Äì1840 had a 90% death rate among the Mandan. The two Mandan villages that had been in contact with Lewis and Clark suffered the horrific effects of the virus. The smallpox outbreak lasted from 1837‚Äì1838 and, out of 1,600 Mandan villagers, 31 survived. The smallpox epidemic was largely spread through the trading business. Despite warnings of outbreaks, Native Americans still visited trading posts and became exposed to the virus. Once the infected Mandan villages were empty, neighboring peoples raided the village for goods, but suffered after carrying back the virus via blankets, horses, and household tools. Flora and fauna Prairie Rose Over the hundreds of years that the Native Americans occupied this area, a very different landscape existed than what can be observed today. When occupied by the tribes, the upland areas were a mixed prairie region that contained a minimal number of trees. The floodplain forests in the river bottomlands were rich and fertile. This fertile area was cleared and used by the Native Americans in the cultivation of such crops as corn, beans, squash, and sunflowers. Trees such as green ash, cottonwood, American elm, and box elder were common in the bottomlands. Other smaller trees and shrubs such as sandbar willow, red osier dogwood, and buffalo berry were also common. In 1974, as an effort to preserve the historic value and beauty as it once appeared, the area surrounding the park was transformed back to how it originally looked when the Native Americans occupied the area. The area now contains native short grass prairies, exotic grasslands, of hardwood forest, cultural village sites, wetland areas and sandbars. Within some areas of the park, the forest composition has changed very little. A few prairie areas contain wheatgrass, needlegrass, grama, and big bluestem grasses and many forbs and flowers. Native wildlife feed on plants such as choke cherry, wild plums, buffaloberry and Juneberry. The various vegetative communities within the park are home to many species of wildlife. The surrounding forests are home to white tailed deer, coyotes, beavers, skunks, prairie pocket gophers and thirteen-lined ground squirrels. The park is also home to a large variety of birds. Game birds found here include turkeys, pheasants, Canada geese and mourning doves. Raptors such as owls, red-tailed hawks, bald eagles and kestrels can be spotted. Other birds surrounding the rivers that can be viewed here are white pelicans, snow geese, and great blue herons. The Missouri and the Knife Rivers are home to twenty‚Äìsix known species of aquatic mollusks within the park. Within the park limits, insect species are being collected and analyzed. Over 200 different species of invertebrates have been identified. The most common order of insects found here include Coleoptera (beetles), Diptera (flies), Hemiptera (true bugs) Homoptera (leaf hoppers), and Hymenoptera (bees, wasps and ants). Many of these insects are crucial to the diet of park wildlife. As with everywhere else, the park struggles with the management of exotic invasive species. Exotic plants first appeared when Native Americans and Euro-Americans cleared the forests. Many exotic plants are introduced accidentally but a few were planted deliberately. Exotic plant species include leafy spurge, Canada thistle and sweet clover. The park is currently conducting an inventory and monitoring program to gather information on the plant and animal species present within the park. From this information, the managers will be able to best decide how to manage and control the exotic invasive plants.

It is part of the National Trails System of the United States. It extends for some from Wood River, Illinois, to the mouth of the Columbia River in Oregon. The trail is administered by the National Park Service, but sites along the trail are managed by federal land management agencies, state, local, tribal, and private organizations. The trail is not a hiking trail, but provides opportunities for hiking, boating and horseback riding at many locations along the route. The trail is the second longest of the 23 National Scenic and National Historic Trails. Beginning at the Camp Dubois recreation in Illinois, it passes through portions of Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota, Montana, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. The Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail is approximately long, extending from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to the mouth of the Columbia River, near present day Astoria, Oregon. It follows the historic outbound and inbound routes of the Lewis and Clark Expedition as well as the preparatory section from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to Wood River, Illinois. The Trail connects 16 states (Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, South Dakota, North Dakota, Montana, Idaho, Washington, and Oregon) and many tribal lands. It is administered by the National Park Service. Headquarters and visitor center  National Park Service Midwest Regional Headquarters on the Downtown Omaha riverfront The official headquarters for the trail is located at the National Park Service Midwest Regional Headquarters, in Omaha, Nebraska. The visitor center features exhibits about the explorers and their historic trip, as well as information about sites along the trail. History Omaha and Council Bluffs on the trail In 1948 the National Park Service proposed a \\"Lewis and Clark Tour-way\\" along the Missouri River from St. Louis to Three Forks, Montana. Later, Jay \\"Ding\\" Darling proposed the development of the expedition route as a recreational trail. Following a 1966 report by the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation, the National Trails System Act of 1968 listed the route for study as a possible National Scenic Trail. Finally in 1978 the law was amended by the National Parks and Recreation Act to provide for a new category of trail, National Historic Trails, one of which was to be the Lewis and Clark trail.Lewis and Clark Trail Foundation Document From 2003 to 2006, the National Park Service commemorated the bicentennial of the Lewis and Clark Expedition with the Corps of Discovery II traveling exhibit.NPS: Summary History of Corps II The 2019 John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act extended the Trail an additional along the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to Wood River, Illinois.

He was brother of Umar Ibn Abi Rabi'ahIbn Khallikan's Biographical Dictionary, trans. by Bn Mac Guckin de Slane, Oriental Translation Fund (Series), 57, 4 vols (Paris: Printed for the Oriental translation fund of Great Britain and Ireland, 1842-71), I 373. and one of the arch-enemies of Muhammad and the flag-bearer of opposition towards Islam and the early Muslims. Islam views him as having malevolence and enmity to such an extent that Muhammad gave him the title of \\"The Pharaoh of this Ummah\\". Muhammad said, ‚ÄúHe who calls Abu Jahl 'Abu Hakam' has made a serious mistake. He should seek forgiveness from Allah for this.‚ÄùThe Life of Muhammad: A Translation of ibn Is·∏•ƒÅq‚Äôs Sƒ´rat Rasul AllƒÅh with introduction & notes by Alfred Guillaume, Oxford University Press, 1955. Contrary to general misconception, ibn Hisham was not an uncle (as was Abu Lahab) or another blood relative of Muhammad. Muhammad belonged to the Banu Hashim clan of the Quraysh tribe, and ibn Hisham belonged to the Banu Makhz≈´m clan of the Quraysh. Amr ibn Hisham was also known as Asad al-ahlaf, as he was the lion of the opposing groups that had sworn to fight against Islam and Muhammad.Letter No.28, 2nd paragraph, Peak of Eloquence (Page-575), ; retrieved 11 January 2015 Abu Jahl was fatally and badly wounded by Mu‚Äòawwidh ibn ‚ÄòAfrƒÅ‚Äô and Mu'ƒÅdh ibn 'Amr ibn al-Jam≈´·∏• and eventually killed by Abdullah ibn Masud on March 13, 624, when he died fighting the Muslims in the Battle of Badr. Name His epithet was Ab≈´ l-·∏§akam (ÿ£ÿ®Ÿà ÿßŸÑÿ≠ŸÉŸÖ) (literally \\"father of wise judgments\\") as he was considered a man of deep wisdom, cunning and understanding by the elders of Quraysh for which they trusted his opinion and relied on him as an elite member of their assembly. Even at the age of thirty, he used to attend the special assemblies held at DƒÅr‚Äô an-Nadwa, the residence owned by ·∏§akƒ´m ibn ·∏§izƒÅm, although the rule of age of entry to these private assemblies was at least forty. ‚ÄòAmr ibn HishƒÅm showed relentless animosity to Muhammad and rejected his message. Therefore Muhammad referred him as Ab≈´ Jahl (ÿ£ÿ®Ÿà ÿ¨ŸáŸÑ) (literally \\"father of ignorance\\"). ‚ÄòAmr ibn HishƒÅm was also called Ibn al-·∏§an·∫ìalƒ´ya from his mother's side.Guillaume, p. 298 Family = Parents and siblings = His father was Hisham ibn al-Mughirah and his mother was Asma bint Makhrabah ibn Jandal al-Tamimiya, who early to converted being Muslim.

Umm Habib (Habiba) Identification mark Amr ibn Hisham had a trace of a scar on his knee which helped 'Abdullah ibn Mas'≈´d to identify him among the slain and wounded soldiers of Quraysh in the battlefield of Badr. 'Amr ibn HishƒÅm was almost the same age of Muhammad. Once in their youth, they had been pressed together at the table of 'Abdullah ibn Jud'ƒÅn at-Taymƒ´. Muhammad was thinner than ibn Hisham and gave him a push which sent him to his knees and one of them was scratched so deeply that it left a permanent scar.Guillaume, p. 304 After Muhammad announced his prophecy (c 613) 'Amr was among the chieftains that in varying degrees kept a relentless hostility towards the Muslims. Abu Jahl showed fierce opposition against Muhammad when he began preaching publicly. The people of Mecca were mostly devout and were already familiar with the Abrahamic faith as descendants of Isma‚Äòƒ´l. Likewise,and stuck to the social and religious traditions of the community prevalent since the time of his forefathers. However, the following causes of dissension created hostility towards Muhammad: =Power struggle between Ban≈´ Makhz≈´m and Ban≈´ ‚ÄòAbd ManƒÅf= Abu Jahl once secretly went out by night to listen to Muhammad as he was praying in his house while Abu Sufyan b. ·∏§arb and al-Akhnas b. Sharƒ´q al-Thaqafi also did the same thing. Every one of them chose a place to sit where he could listen, and none knew where his fellow was sitting. So they passed the night listening to him, until as the dawn rose, they dispersed. On their way home they met and reproached one another, and one said to the other, 'Don't do it again, for if one of the light-minded fools sees you, you will arouse suspicion in his mind.' Yet they continued doing this for the next two days.Guillaume, p. 142 Abu Jahl later told al-Akhnas ibn Sharƒ´q, ‚ÄúWe competed with Ban≈´ ‚ÄòAbd ManƒÅf in everything to attain status and nobility. They fed people, so we also fed people. They gave charity, so we also gave charity. They looked after people; so did we. We did these until we became equal. And now they say, ‚ÄòA prophet has come from us who receives revelations from the sky‚Äô How can we possibly be able to compete with this? By Allah, we will never believe in him and we will never accept his message!‚Äù Al-Mughƒ´rah ibn Shu‚Äòbah, a man from a·π≠-·π¨ƒÅ‚Äôif, once visited Makkah. He was walking with Ab≈´ Jahl ibn HishƒÅm in the streets when they came across Muhammad. Muhammad invited ‚ÄòAmr ibn HishƒÅm to Islam by saying, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you accept Islam and believe me as the Messenger of Allah?‚Äù ‚ÄòAmr ibn HishƒÅm said, ‚ÄúO Muhammad, when are you going to stop cursing our gods? If you want us to testify that you have fulfilled your mission, we will testify for you. And if I knew that you are telling the truth, I would have already followed you.‚Äù Muhammad then left. ‚ÄòAmr ibn HishƒÅm looked at al-Mughƒ´rah and said, ‚ÄúI know that he is telling the truth, but there is something holding me back. The descendants of Qu·π£ayy ibn KilƒÅb ibn Murrah [whereas Ban≈´ Makhz≈´m was the descendant of Yaqa·∫ìah ibn Murrah] wanted al-·∏§ijƒÅbah (Guardianship of al-Ka‚Äòbah & preservation of its key), as-SiqƒÅyah (Custody of Zamzam & catering the pilgrims during the ·∏§ajj), al-IfƒÅdah (Authority of trade & commerce), al-LiwƒÅ‚Äô (Authority of the banner of battles), the authority of armed forces and an-Nadwah (Assembly of the Quraysh). We sacrificed all in favor of them [Ban≈´ Makhz≈´m was only in charge of the cavalry, KhƒÅlid ibn Walƒ´d being its commander] and started picking up & competing with them. When we are running neck to neck, they say ‚ÄòWe have a prophet among us‚Äô; How can we compete with that? By Allah, we are never going to accept this.‚ÄùBayhaqƒ´ = Persecution of converts = Abu al-Hakam stirred up the Meccans against the Muslims. When he heard that a man had become a Muslim, if he was a man of social importance and had relations to defend him, he reprimanded him and poured scorn on him, saying, 'You have forsaken the religion of your father who was better than you. We will declare you a blockhead and brand you as a fool, and destroy your reputation.' If he was a merchant he said, 'we will boycott your goods and reduce you to beggary.' If he was a person of no social importance, he beat him and incited people against him.Guillaume, p145 Therefore, many converted slaves had to suffer the extreme savagery of Abu al-Hakam. It has been told that Amr ibn Hisham often put heavy stones on the backs of his slaves if they made a mistake. Convert slaves belonging to the polytheist Quraysh received the harshest punishment. Abu al-Hakam beat ·∏§arƒ´thah bint al-Mu‚Äòammil, one such slave, for her conversion to such an extent that she lost her eyesight. He also attacked Sumayyah bint Khayyat, the mother of ‚ÄòAmmƒÅr ibn Yasir, and inflicted on her mortal wounds by stabbing her with a spear in her private parts. She was the first Muslim to meet martyrdom in the cause of Islam. Abu al-Hakam also persecuted ‚ÄòAmmar‚Äôs father Yasir ibn Amir and his brother ‚ÄòAbdullah and tortured them to death right in front of his eyes. Abu al-Hakam had once clawed at ‚ÄòAbdullah ibn Mas‚Äò≈´d and punched him in Mecca. = The Man from Banu IrƒÅsh = The harassment of Abu Jahl was not only directed to his own people, but his misdemeanor extended to the people outside of Mecca also. Once a man from the tribe of IrƒÅsh came to Makkah complaining that Abu Jahl had bought some camels from him without paying him back. When the IrƒÅshi man asked people to help him, they referred him to Muhammad with the intention of stirring up an argument. Muhammad brought him to Abu Jahl‚Äôs house and asked him to give the IrƒÅshi man‚Äôs money that he owed him. Abu Jahl immediately came back with the money with his face looking extremely pale and timid. The disappointed Quraysh blamed Abu Jahl with sarcasm later on. He said, ‚ÄúWoe unto you all! As soon as I heard the knock on my door, I heard a terrifying sound which filled me with awe. When I looked to see what it was, it was the most colossal and vicious camel I had ever seen towering over my head. By Allah, if I had delayed or refused it would have devoured me alive!‚ÄùGuillaume, p177-178 = Abu Jahl condemned Christian converts = While Muhammad was in Mecca some twenty Christians came to him from Abyssinia (or NajrƒÅn) when they heard news of him. Muhammad answered all their questions and read the Quran to them. Their eyes flowed with tears and they accepted Islam. Abu Jahl intercepted them as they were leaving, saying, 'God, what a wretched band you are! Your people at home sent you to bring them information about the fellow, and as soon as you sat with him you renounced your religion and believed what he said. We don't know a more asinine band than you'. They answered: 'Peace be on you. We will not engage in foolish controversy with you. We have our religion and you have yours. We have not been remiss in seeking what is best.'Guillaume, p179 = Hostility to Muhammad = One day Abu Jahl declared, \\"I call God to witness that I will wait for him tomorrow with a stone which I can hardly lift and when he prostrates himself in prayer I will split his skull with it. Betray me or defend me, let the Ban≈´ 'Abdu ManƒÅf do what they like after that.\\" The Qurayshi people said that they would never betray him on any account, and he could carry on with his project. When morning came Abu Jahl took a stone and sat in wait for Muhammad. The apostle rose to pray while Quraysh sat in their meeting, waiting for what Abu Jahl was to do. When the apostle prostrated himself, Abu Jahl took up the stone and went towards him, until when he got near him, he turned back in flight, pale with terror, and his hand had withered upon the stone, so that he cast the stone from his hand. The Quraysh asked him what had happened, and he replied that when he got near him a camel's stallion got in his way. \\"By God\\", he said, \\"I have never seen anything like his head, shoulders, and teeth on any stallion before, and he made as though he would eat me.\\"Guillaume, p135 Narrated ‚ÄòAbdullah ibn ‚ÄòAbbas: Abu Jahl said, \\"If I see Muhammad praying at the Ka'ba, I will tread on his neck.\\" When the Prophet heard of that, he said, \\"If he does so, the Angels will snatch him away.\\"Sahih Bukhari 6.482 Narrated 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud: Once the Prophet was offering prayers at the Ka'ba. Abu Jahl was sitting with some of his companions. One of them said to the others, \\"Who amongst you will bring the entrails of a camel of Bani so and so and put it on the back of Muhammad, when he prostrates?\\" The most unfortunate of them got up and brought it. He waited till the Prophet prostrated and then placed it on his back between his shoulders. I was watching but could not do anything. I wish I had some people with me to hold out against them. They started laughing and falling on one another. Allah's Apostle was in prostration and he did not lift his head up till Fatima (Prophet's daughter) came and threw that (camel's abdominal contents) away from his back. He raised his head and said thrice, \\"O Allah! Punish Quraish.\\" So it was hard for Abu Jahl and his companions when the Prophet invoked Allah against them as they had a conviction that the prayers and invocations were accepted in this city (Mecca). The Prophet said, \\"O Allah! Punish Abu Jahl, 'Utba bin Rabƒ´'a, Shaiba bin Rabƒ´'a, Al-Walƒ´d bin 'Utba, Umaiya bin Khalaf, and 'Uqba bin Abu Mu'ƒ´·π≠ (and he mentioned the seventh whose name I cannot recall). By Allah in Whose Hands my life is, I saw the dead bodies of those persons who were counted by Allah's Apostle in the Qalib (one of the wells) of Badr.Sahih Bukhari 1.241. also Sahih Bukhari 4.185, Sahih Bukhari 4.409, Sahih Bukhari 5.193 = Disbelieving in Muhammad's miracles =  Splitting of the moon  Muslim legend relates that Quraysh polytheists demanded Muhammad to perform most unlikely things possible to prove his prophethood. Once Abu Jahl, along with other leaders including al-Walƒ´d ibn al-Mughƒ´rah, al-‚ÄòƒÄ·π£ ibn WƒÅ‚Äôil, al-‚ÄòƒÄ·π£ ibn HishƒÅm, Aswad ibn ‚ÄòAbd Yagh≈´th, al-Aswad ibn al-Mu·π≠·π≠alib, Zam‚Äòah ibn Aswad, an-Na·∏çr ibn al-·∏§ƒÅrith asked Muhammad, ‚ÄúIf you truly are a prophet, then split the moon in half so that one half will appear over Mount Abu Qubais and the other over Mount Quayqian.‚Äù Muhammad asked, ‚ÄúIf I do it, will you become Muslims?‚Äù They agreed. On the 14th night, when it was full moon, Muhammad prayed to Allah to give him the miracle. When Gabriel informed him that Allah had granted his prayer, he announced it to the Meccans. The polytheists witnessed the splitting of the moon. Muhammad shouted to the Muslims: ‚ÄúO Abu Salama ibn ‚ÄòAbdu‚Äôl Asad! ArqƒÅm ibn Abi‚Äôl ArqƒÅm! Bear witness!‚Äù However, the polytheists said ‚ÄúThe son of Abu Kabsha cast a spell on you!‚Äù Some of them also said: ‚ÄúIf Muhammad had cast a spell on us, then he couldn‚Äôt have cast a spell on everyone! Let us ask the wayfarers who came from the surrounding areas if they saw what we saw.‚Äù So when they asked the people they answered that the moon was indeed split into two. Yet, the polytheists rejected Islam. ‚ÄúThis is a prevalent magic‚Äù, they said, ‚ÄúAb≈´ ·π¨ƒÅlib‚Äôs orphan affected the sky with his spell‚Äù. (·π¢a·∏•ƒ´·∏• al-BukhƒÅri 3636, 3638) = ·∏§amzah ibn ‚ÄòAbdul Mu·π≠·π≠alib antagonized by Abu Jahl = Abu Jahl passed by Muhammad at al-·π¢afƒÅ, insulted him and behaved most offensively, speaking spitefully of his religion and trying to bring him into disrepute. Muhammad did not speak to him. Now a freedwoman, belonging to 'Abdullah b. Jud'ƒÅn b. 'Amr b. Ka'b b. Sa'd b. Taym b. Murra, was in her house listening to what went on. When he went away he betook himself to the assembly of Quraysh at the Ka'ba and sat there. Within a little while ·∏§amza b. 'Abdu'I Mu·π≠·π≠alib arrived, with his bow hanging from his shoulder, returning from the chase, for he was fond of hunting and used to go out shooting. When he came back from a hunt he never went home until he had circumambulated the Ka'ba, and that done when he passed by an assembly of the Quraysh he stopped and saluted and talked with them. He was the strongest man of Quraysh, and the most unyielding. Muhammad had gone back to his house when he passed by this woman, who asked him if he had heard of what ‚ÄòAmr b. Hisham had done just recently to his nephew, Muhammad; how he had found him sitting quietly there, and insulted him, and cursed him, and treated him badly, and that Muhammad had answered not a word. ·∏§amza was filled with rage, for God purposed to honor him, so he went out at a run and did not stop to greet anyone, meaning to punish Abu Jahl when he met him. When he got to the mosque he saw him sitting among the people, and went up to him until he stood over him, when he lifted up his bow and struck him a violent blow with it, saying, 'Will you insult him when I follow his religion, and say what he says? Hit me back if you can!' Some of Ban≈´ Makhz≈´m got up to go to Abu Jahl's help, but he said, 'Let Ab≈´ 'UmƒÅra alone for, by God, I insulted his nephew deeply.'Guillaume, p131 =‚ÄòAyyƒÅsh ibn Abƒ´ Rabƒ´‚Äòah held prisoner by Abu Jahl= ‚ÄòAyyƒÅsh ibn Abƒ´ Rabƒ´‚Äòah was one of the paternal cousins of ‚ÄòAmr ibn HishƒÅm as well as his maternal brother. ‚ÄòAyyƒÅsh was among the early Muslim converts who emigrated to Madƒ´nah before Muhammad. Abu Jahl devised a plan to bring him back to Makkah. Accordingly, he went to Madƒ´nah with his brother ·∏§ƒÅrith and told ‚ÄòAyyƒÅsh a deceptive story about his mother‚Äôs illness as a decoy only to provoke his emotion. Abu Jahl also lied about his mother‚Äôs making an oath that she would neither sit in the shade nor comb her hair until she saw ‚ÄòAyyƒÅsh again. ‚ÄòUmar ibn al-Kha·π≠·π≠ƒÅb tried to warn him by saying \\"This is nothing but an attempt of the people to seduce you from your religion so beware of them; for, by Allah, if lice were causing your mother trouble she would use her comb, and if the heat of Mecca oppressed her she would take shelter from it.\\" But ‚ÄòAyyƒÅsh said, \\"I will clear my mother from her oath; also I have some money there which I can get.\\" ‚ÄòUmar told him that he was one of the richest of the Quraysh and he could have half his money if he refused to go with the two men. But when ‚ÄòUmar saw that he was determined to go he said, \\"If you must go, then take this camel of mine. She is well bred and easy to ride. Don't dismount, and if you suspect them of treachery you can escape on her.\\" The three went off and while they were on their way Abu Jahl said, \\"Nephew, I find my beast hard to ride. Won't you mount me behind you?\\" When he agreed he and they made their camels kneel to make the change over, and whenon the ground they fell on him and bound him securely and brought him to Mecca by day and said, 'O men of Mecca, deal with your fools as we have dealt with this fool of ours.' = When the family of Ja·∏•sh migrated for Madinah = The house of the Banu Ja·∏•sh was locked up when they left and ‚ÄòUtba ibn Rabƒ´‚Äòah, al-‚ÄòAbbƒÅs ibn ‚ÄòAbdu‚Äôl-Mu·π≠·π≠alib and Abu Jahl passed by it on their way to the upper part of Mecca. ‚ÄòUtbah looked at it with its doors blowing to and fro, empty of inhabitants, and sighed heavily and said: ‚ÄúEvery house however long its prosperity lasts will one day be overtaken by misfortune and trouble.‚Äù Then 'Utbah went on to say, ‚ÄòThe house of the Banu Ja·∏•sh has become tenantless.‚Äô To which Abu Jahl replied, ‚ÄòNobody will weep over that. This is the work of this man's nephew. He has divided our community, disrupted our affairs, and driven a wedge between us.‚ÄôGuillaume, p 215  Imposition of the Boycott  As a means of deterring Muhammad from spreading his message, the Quraysh laid a boycott on Ban≈´ HƒÅshim and Ban≈´ Mu·π≠·π≠alib. Ab≈´ Jahl, met ·∏§akƒ´m ibn ·∏§izƒÅm with whom was a nephew carrying flour intended for his aunt Khadƒ´ja who was with him in the mountain gorge. He hung on to him and said, 'Are you taking food to the Ban≈´ HƒÅshim? By Allah, before you and your food move from here I will denounce you in Mecca.' Ab≈´'l-Bakhtarƒ´ (al-‚ÄòƒÄ·π£) ibn HishƒÅm came to him and said, 'What is going on between you two?' When he said that ·∏§akƒ´m was taking food to the Banu HƒÅshim, he said: 'It is food he has which belongs to his aunt and she has sent to him about it. Are you trying to prevent him taking her own food to her? Let the man go his way'. Ab≈´ Jahl refused until they came to blows, and Ab≈´'I-Bakhtarƒ´ (al-‚ÄòƒÄ·π£) ibn HishƒÅm took a camel's jaw and knocked him down, wounded him, and trod on him violently.Guillaume, p160  Abu Jahl‚Äôs denial to the abrogation of the boycott  This situation ultimately created dissension amongst the various Makkan factions, who were tied with the besieged people by blood relations. After three years of blockade and in Muharram, the tenth year of Muhammad's mission, the pact was broken. HishƒÅm ibn ‚ÄòAmr, who used to smuggle some food to Ban≈´ HƒÅshim secretly at night, went to see Zuhair ibn Abu Umayyah ibn al-Mughirah, one of Abu Jahl's paternal cousins, and reproached him for resigning to that intolerable treatment meted out to his uncles in exile. The latter pleaded impotence, but agreed to work with Hisham and form a pressure group that would secure the extrication of the exiles. On the ground of motivation by uterine relations, there emerged a group of five people who set out to abrogate the pact and declare all relevant clauses null and void. They were HishƒÅm ibn ‚ÄòAmr, Zuhair ibn Abu Umayyah ibn al-Mughirah, Al-Mu·π≠‚Äòim ibn ‚ÄòAdƒ´, Ab≈´'l-Bakhtarƒ´ (al-‚ÄòƒÄ·π£) ibn HishƒÅm and Zam‚Äòa ibn al-Aswad. They decided to meet in their assembly place and start their self-charged mission from the very precinct of the Sacred House. Zuhair, after circumambulating seven times, along with his colleagues approached the hosts of people there and rebuked them for indulging in the amenities of life whereas their kith and kin of Ban≈´ HƒÅshim were perishing on account of starvation and economic boycott. They swore they would never relent until the parchment of boycott was torn to pieces and the pact broken at once. Abu Jahl, standing nearby, retorted that it would never be torn. Zam‚Äòa was infuriated and accused Abu Jahl of telling lies, adding that the pact was established and the parchment was written without seeking their approval. Ab≈´'l-Bakhtarƒ´ intervened and backed Zam‚Äòa. Al-Mu·π≠‚Äòim bin ‚ÄòAdi and Hisham bin ‚ÄòAmr attested to the truthfulness of their two companions. Abu Jahl, with a cunning attempt to liquidate the hot argument that was running counter to his malicious goals, answered that the issue had already been resolved sometime and somewhere before. (Ar-Raheeq Al-Makhtum)  Plan of assassination  In the end, Abu Jahl came up with a plan to assassinate Muhammad. Each clan should provide a young, powerful, well-born, aristocratic warrior; that each of these should be provided with a sharp sword; then that each of them should strike a blow at him and kill him. Thus they would be relieved of him, and responsibility for his blood would lie upon all the clans. The Banu 'Abdu ManƒÅf could not fight them all and would have to accept the blood-money which they would all contribute to.Guillaume, p222  The Hijrah of Muhammad  At the news of Muhammad's flight with Abu Bakr, Abu Jahl rushed to the house of Abu Bakr. When interrogated, Abu Bakr's daughter Asma refused to tell him their whereabouts. Abu Jahl, in a fit rage, slapped her so hard that a few of her teeth came loose and her earring flew off. = Event with Suraqah ibn Malik = As soon as the Quraysh realized that Muhammad had Ÿáÿßÿ¨ÿ± with Ab≈´ Bakr, they sent a cavalry including Umayyah ibn Khalaf, Abu Lahab & Abu Jahl to chase after them. In their frantic attempt to hunt them down, the Quraysh followed their trails up to Mount Thaor where Muhammad was indeed hiding inside a cave. One of the pursuers suggested checking out the cave but Umayyah ibn Khalaf jested at him and showed the intact cobweb and an undisturbed bird‚Äôs nest at the mouth of the cave. Ab≈´ Jahl was the only one yet to be convinced and said, \\"By LƒÅt & ‚ÄòUzzƒÅ, I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre holed up somewhere nearby. They must be watching us now as we look for them. Muhammad has cast a spell on our eyes so we can‚Äôt see them.\\" Although Muhammad managed to escape for the time being, Abu Jahl would not give up and declared a bounty of 100 of the finest Arab camels for bringing him dead or alive. Suraqah ibn Malik ibn Ju‚Äôshum al-Madlajƒ´ raced after Muhammad right away. As he was gaining on them, suddenly the hooves of his stallion sagged in the desert sand and his limbs became paralyzed. So he begged him for mercy. At his entreaty, Muhammad prayed for his relief and let him get away scot-free by making a treaty of maintaining the secrecy of their whereabouts as well as warding off the other pursuers. When Suraqah was completely certain that Muhammad had reached Madƒ´nah, he returned to Makkah relating his miraculous incident to everyone. Since Suraqah was the leader of Banu Madlaj, Abu Jahl feared that his tribe would accept Islam influenced by this story. So Abu Jahl wrote a letter to the Banu Madlaj tribe warning them of the deviation of Suraqah, despised him for his cowardice and selfishness and advised them to disobey him. Suraqah, however, replied to this letter saying, \\"O Abu‚Äôl ·∏§akam! By Allah, had you witnessed how my horse got pinned into the sand, you also would not doubt the prophethood of Muhammad. I truly see that he will soon dominate all of Arabia and everyone will be his followers!\\"  Before the Battle of Badr  Prior to the Battle of Badr, Sa'd ibn Mu‚ÄòƒÅdh had visited Mecca once to perform his Umrah with his non-Muslim friend Umayyah ibn Khalaf, when they came across 'Amr. They had an argument, and as it became heated, Sa‚Äôd threatened him with stopping the Meccan trade route to Syria and 'Amr informed Umayyah that his life was threatened by Muhammad. 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud narrated:Sahih Bukhari 4.826, Sahih Bukhari 5.286, Sahih Bukhari 5.297 The Meccans would not leave Muhammad at peace even in Madinah. So they sent Abu Jahl leading three hundred riders to terrorize the Muslims. Muhammad immediately dispatched a group of thirty Muhajir≈´n led by ·∏§amza ibn ‚ÄòAbdu‚Äôl-Mu·π≠·π≠alib (Ibn Sa‚Äôd, 2: 9). The two parties confronted each other on the seashore in the neighbourhood of aI-‚Äòƒ™·π£ (in the territory of Juhayna) standing face to face in preparation for battle. In the heat of the moment, Majdi ibn 'Amr al-Juhani intervened and compelled them to lay down their arms. He was at peace with both the parties according to a truce. So the encounter ended up without any fight. At this, Abu Jahl showed much regret in a poem composed by him and hoped for a future victory over the Muslims.Guillaume, p283 When Abu Sufyan ibn ·∏§arb sent a distress message to Mecca, the Quraysh marshalled about 1,000 men for battle. Abu Jahl, on the point of his journey to Badr, grabbed the hangings (GhilƒÅf) of Ka‚Äôbah and made an earnest supplication to Allah that He would make whichever party was on the right side victorious.  Battle of Badr  Abu Jahl's obstinate attitude culminated in an actual fight despite several attempts of intimidation by some Quraysh leaders. Al-Ju·∏•fa Juhaym ibn al-·π¢alt ibn Makhrama ibn al-Mu·π≠·π≠alib tried to intimidate the Quraysh belligerents from going into battle based on an ominous vision. But Ab≈´ Jahl sardonically replied, \\"Here's another prophet from Ban≈´ al-Mu·π≠·π≠alib! He'll know tomorrow if we meet them who is going to be killed!\\"Guillaume, p296 When Ab≈´ SufyƒÅn ibn ·∏§arb saw that he had saved his caravan he sent word to Quraysh, \\"Since you came out to save your caravan, your men, and your property, and God has delivered them, go back.\\" But Ab≈´ Jahl said, \\"By Allah, we will not go back until we have been to Badr.\\" Badr is the site of one of the Arab fairs where they used to hold a market every year. \\"We will spend three days there, slaughter camels and feast and drink, wine, and the girls shall play for us. The Arabs will hear that we have come and gathered together, and will respect us in future. So come on!\\" ·∏§akƒ´m ibn ·∏§izƒÅm tried to restrain ‚ÄòUtbah ibn Rabƒ´‚Äòah from going to battle based on the report gathered by 'Umayr b. Wahb al-Juma·∏•ƒ´. On ‚ÄòUtbah‚Äôs counsel, ·∏§akƒ´m approached Abu Jahl so that he might put him off. But Abu Jahl scorned his advice by saying, \\"By Allah, his lungs are swollen (with fear) when he saw Muhammad and his companions. No, by Allah, we will not turn back until Allah decides between us and Muhammad. ‚ÄòUtba does not believe his own words, but he saw that Muhammad and his companions are (in number as) the eaters of one slaughtered camel, and his son (i.e. Ab≈´ ·∏§udhayfa ibn ‚ÄòUtbah) is among them, so he is afraid lest you slay him.\\"  Death  Abu Jahl was fatally wounded in the Battle of Badr by Mu'adh ibn ‚ÄòAfrƒÅ‚Äô and Mu'ƒÅdh ibn 'Amr, but was finally killed by Abdullah ibn Masud.Muhammad ibn Ishaq. Sirat Rasul Allah. Translated by Guillaume, A. (1955). The Life of Muhammad, pp. 304, 337-338. Oxford: Oxford University Press. \\"Muhammad ibn Ishaq. Sirat Rasul Allah.\\" 'Abdur- Rahman bin 'Auf narrated:Sahih Bukhari 4.369, Sahih Bukhari 5.324, Sahih Bukhari 5.298, Sahih Bukhari 5.300, Sahih Bukhari 5.301, Sahih Bukhari 5.355 The body of Abu Jahl along with other Meccan soldiers Mu'ƒÅdh ibn 'Amr ibn al- Jam≈´·∏• said, \\"I heard the people saying when Abu Jahl was in a sort of thicket, 'Abu'l-·∏§akam cannot be got at'. When I heard that I made it my business, and made for him. When I got within striking distance I fell upon him and fetched him a blow which sent his foot and half his shank flying. I can only liken it to a date-stone flying from the pestle when it is beaten. His son ‚ÄòIkrima struck me on the shoulder and severed my arm and it hung by the skin from my side, and the battle compelled me to leave him. I fought the whole of the day dragging my arm behind me and when it became painful to me I put my foot on it and standing on it I tore it off.\\" He lived after that into the reign of 'UthmƒÅn. Mu‚Äòawwidh ibn ‚ÄòAfrƒÅ‚Äô passed Ab≈´ Jahl as he lay there helpless and smote him until he left him at his last gasp. He himself went on fighting until he was killed. Then 'Abdullah ibn Mas'≈´d passed by Ab≈´ Jahl when the Apostle had ordered that he was to be searched for among the slain. 'Abdullah ibn Mas'≈´d said that he found him at his last gasp and put his foot on his neck and said to him: \\"Has God put you to shame?\\" He replied, \\"How has He shamed me? Am I anything more remarkable than a man you have killed? Tell me how the battle went.\\" He told him that it went in favor of Allah and His apostle. Abu Jahl said, \\"You have climbed high, you little shepherd.\\" Then ['Abdullah ibn Mas'≈´d] struck off his head and showed his head to Muhammad. When Muhammad saw his lifeless body on the battlefield he said, \\"This is the Pharaoh of this Ummah.\\"\\"The Pharoah of the Community\\" Upon his death, the people of Quraysh mourned for him and composed elegies and requiems depicting him as a noble, generous and glorified man.  Quranic verses related to Abu Jahl  ‚ÄòAbdullah ibn ‚ÄòAbbƒÅs says that 84 verses of the Quran were revealed regarding Abu Jahl. Then Abu Jahl came up to him saying, ‚ÄúShould I not stop you from this?!‚Äù So the Messenger rebuked him and warned him to stop harassing him. Abu Jahl then told the Prophet, ‚ÄúDo you threaten me when you know very well that I have the most backing and support than anyone in this valley of Makkah?‚Äù Allah then revealed: 9\\\\. Do you not see the one who forbids? 10\\\\. A slave when he (turns to Allah) to pray? 11\\\\. Don't you see if he is on (the road of) Guidance?- 12\\\\. Or enjoins Righteousness? 13\\\\. Don't you see if he denies (Truth) and turns away? 14\\\\. Does he not know that Allah sees him? 15\\\\. Let him beware! If he does not stop, We will drag him by the forelock 16\\\\. A lying, sinful forelock! 17\\\\. Then, let him call (for help) to his council (of comrades): 18\\\\. We will call on the angels of punishment (to deal with him)! 19\\\\. Nay, heed him not: But bow down in adoration, and bring yourself the closer (to Allah)! (S≈´rah al-\`Alaq, 96: 9-19) Abu Jahl then backed off hearing these lines. Ibn ‚ÄòAbbƒÅs says that if Abu Jahl had called his gang to hurt the Messenger, then Allah would have sent upon him the angels of punishment to deal with him. = Suratul An'am: 108 = Once Abu Jahl said to the prophet, ‚ÄòBy Allah, Muhammad, you will either stop cursing our gods, or we will curse the God you serve.‚Äô So Allah revealed concerning that, ‚ÄúCurse not those to whom they pray other than God lest they curse God wrongfully through lack of knowledge.‚Äù (Sura 6:108)Guillaume, p162 = Sura Dukhan: 43 = When Allah mentioned the tree of al-Zaqq≈´m to strike terror into the Quraysh, Abu Jahl asked them, ‚ÄúO Quraysh, do you know what the tree of al Zaqq≈´m is with which Muhammad would scare you?‚Äù When they said that they did not, he said: ‚ÄúIt is Yathrib dates buttered. By Allah, if we get hold of them we will gulp them down in one!‚Äù So Allah sent down the following verse: ‚ÄúVerily the tree of al- Zaqq≈´m is the food of the sinner like molten brass seething in their bellies like boiling water.‚Äù (S≈´ra 44: 43)Guillaume, p167 = Sura Anfal: 33-34 = Narrated Anas bin Malik: Abu Jahl said, \\"O Allah! If this (Quran) is indeed the Truth from You, then rain down on us a shower of stones from the sky or bring on us a painful torment.\\" So Allah revealed: \\"But Allah would not punish them while you were amongst them, nor He will punish them while they seek (Allah's) forgiveness...\\" (8.33) And why Allah should not punish them while they turn away (men) from Al-Masjid-al-Haram (the Sacred Mosque of Mecca)...\\" (8.33-34)Sahih Bukhari 6.171, Sahih Bukhari 6.172 = Sura Ma'un: 2-3 = Abu Jahl was infamous for his ruthless attitude toward orphans as well. 'Amr, who was a custodian of an orphan, refused to return his belongings once he asked for and drove him away.

This National Historic Site preserves the last remaining Minuteman II ICBM system in the United States. 450 of the newer Minuteman III missiles are still on active duty at Malmstrom AFB, Montana, Minot AFB, North Dakota, and F. E. Warren AFB, Wyoming. Facilities This National Historic Site consists of three facilities: a main office and two significant Cold War-era sites, a launch control center and a missile silo/launch facility, formerly operated by the 66th Strategic Missile Squadron of the 44th Strategic Missile Wing, headquartered at Ellsworth Air Force Base in Rapid City, South Dakota. The facilities represent the only remaining intact components of a nuclear missile field that once consisted of 150 Minuteman II missiles, 15 launch-control centers, and covered over of southwestern South Dakota. The silo, known as launch facility Delta Nine (D-09) was constructed in 1963. It occupies 1.6 acres (6,000 m2) nearly one-half mile (800 m) southwest of Interstate 90 at Exit 116 and six miles (10 km) from the town of Wall, South Dakota, in eastern Pennington County. It consists of an underground launch tube (\\"missile silo\\") in diameter and deep, made of reinforced concrete with a steel-plate liner. An unarmed missile is on display inside. The launch tube's 90-ton cover has been rolled partly away and welded to the rails it rides on. The launch tube was then covered with a glass viewing enclosure. Not only does this permit visitors to see the missile, it means Russian satellites are able to verify that the site is not operational, and hence in compliance with the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. Because the only way to get to the underground part of the site is by a ladder long, tours are not conducted underground for safety reasons. Visitors can conduct self-guided tours of the site during the day by calling a number on their cell phones and walking around the site, listening to the description of various points over the phone. The launch control facility, known as Delta One (D-01), is about away, to the east-southeast in northwestern Jackson County. It occupies approximately six acres (24,000 m2) about 1.7 miles (2.7 km) north of I-90 at Exit 127. It consists of an above- ground building containing a kitchen, sleeping quarters, offices and life- support equipment. Below this building is the actual launch control center, buried deep, connected to the building by an elevator. Guided tours are conducted underground here, but are limited to six people at a time due to the very small underground launch control center (\\"capsule\\") and are a half-hour long. Self-guided tours are not possible here; the gate for the fence around D-01 is always locked, just like it was when it was an active launch control facility. History The complex, one of six located in the central United States, was built as a deterrent to a nuclear first strike by the Soviet Union. By placing missiles underground in widely separated locations, it was hoped that regardless of the size of a Soviet missile attack, enough US missiles would survive to ensure devastation on the aggressor nation. The Minutemen in this complex remained on alert for nearly 30 years until the wing was deactivated following the signing of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) by President George Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1991. Under the terms of the treaty, the missiles in this complex were removed from their silos, and in 1994 the 44th Missile Wing was deactivated. All sites in the complex, except D-01 and D-09, have been destroyed. D-01 and D-09 were candidates for becoming a national historic site for a few reasons: * close to a major road (Interstate 90) * close to existing recreational facilities (Badlands National Park, Mount Rushmore) * the sites saw limited modification since they were built in the 1960s (true of all sites in the 44 SMW). The Minuteman Missile National Historic Site was the subject of a 2013 federal law ‚Äì Minuteman Missile National Historic Site Boundary Modification Act (S. 459; 113th Congress) ‚Äì which granted the park additional land.

Vienna: C. Kr. Dvorna in Dr≈æavna Tiskarna, p. 146.) is a village in the Municipality of Radovljica in the Upper Carniola region of Slovenia. It is known for being the location of the headquarters of the Elan Line company. Name Begunje na Gorenjskem was first attested in written sources in 1050 as Beg√ªn (and in 1063 as Uegun). The name of the settlement is derived from the personal name *Bƒõgun—ä, probably as a clipped version of *Bƒõgun'e (selo) 'Bƒõgun—ä's village' (i.e., a neuter singular form) that later shifted to a feminine plural form.Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimolo≈°ki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Zalo≈æba ZRC, p. 54. In Slovene, the settlement was originally simply called BegunjeKrajevni leksikon Dravske Banovine. 1937. Ljubljana: Zveza za tujski promet za Slovenijo, p. 529. but the modifier na Gorenjskem 'in Upper Carniola' was later added to distinguish it from Begunje pri Cerknici (literally, 'Begunje near Cerknica'). In older sources, the settlement was sometimes named Begunje pri Lescah ()‚Äîthat is, 'Begunje near Lesce',Killy, Walther, et al. 2000. Deutsche biographische Enzyklop√§die. Munich: K.G. Saur, p. 1056. which also corresponded to the parish name. History Stain, engraving by Johann Weikhard von Valvasor, 1689 The ruins of 12th-century Kamen (German: Stein or Stain) Castle are just outside the village in the Draga Valley. First documented in 1185, it appeared as Castrum Lapis in 1263 and Stain in 1350, when it passed into the Carniolan possessions of the Counts of Ortenburg. The castle played a vital role in protecting the comital lands in the Bohinj and Upper Sava Valley. When the Ortenburgs became extinct in 1418, it passed to Count Hermann II of Celje and was inherited by the Austrian House of Habsburg in 1456. The 15th-century Kacen≈°tajn Castle, rebuilt in the late 17th century, stands in the centre of the village. The castle was used as women's prison in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and it was seized as Upper Carniolan headquarters of the Nazi German Gestapo during the war. After the war, a Yugoslav labor camp for political prisoners operated in the village.Mrviƒç, Irena. 1999. \\"Tabori≈°ƒçe.\\" Enciklopedija Slovenije, vol. 13 (≈†‚ÄìT), pp. 177‚Äì179. Ljubljana: Mladinska knjiga, p. 179. A memorial and a museum dedicated to the victims were set up in part of the building, which today houses a psychiatric hospital accepting patients from all over the Upper Carniola region. =Mass graves= Begunje na Gorenjskem is the site of several mass graves from during and after the Second World War. During the war, the Germans held 11,477 hostages at Kacen≈°tajn Castle; 849 inmates were killed,Begunjske knjige na spletu. Gorenjski muzej. and 5183 were deported to Nazi concentration camps such as Mauthausen.Po poti spominov. Radovljica: Obƒçina, 1990, p. 45. Mass graves of tortured and shot Slovenes are located in the castle parkGrobi≈°ƒçe ustreljenih talcev, Partizan monuments, Geopedia. and in the Draga Valley to the east.Grobi≈°ƒçe talcev v Dragi, Partizanski spomeniki, Geopedia. Immediately after the Second World War, six known mass graves were created as a result of executions by the communists. The Krpin Gravel Pit 1 and 2 mass graves () are located north of the settlement; the first is in the bushes a few meters above the paved road, between a gravel pit and a dirt road, and the second is a few dozen meters higher, on a slope to the left of the path. The graves contain the remains of at least 20 Russian Liberation Army prisoners of war and civilians that were murdered at the end of June or beginning of July 1945. The Krpin Ski Slope 1‚Äì3 mass graves () are located north of the settlement; the first and second are in a picnic area behind a shed, and the third is on level ground behind the ski slope. The graves contain the remains of Russian Liberation Army prisoners of war and civilians murdered at two locations in the nearby gravel pit. The Mazevec Crevasse Mass Grave () is located north of Kamen Castle, on the edge of a quarry below a large spruce tree, and is 10 m long. It contains the remains of German prisoners of war from Begunje and probably also civilian victims murdered on May 29, 1945. Church Saint Ulrich's Church The parish church in Begunje na Gorenjskem is dedicated to Saint Ulrich. It is a Baroque structure that was built from 1740 to 1743. It has a cupola vault, a bell tower centered with the front side of the church, and furnishings created by Leopold Layer (1752‚Äì1828) and Janez Vurnik (1849‚Äì1911). The interior was painted by Matija Brada≈°ka (1852‚Äì1915) in 1894 and 1897. The side altar dedicated to the Virgin Mary was taken from Kacen≈°tajn Castle.

The park, operated by the National Park Service, encompasses thousands of acres of landscape infused with historical elements from prehistoric archaeological ruins to 19th-century ranches, to a battlefield of the American Civil War. Its largest single feature is Pecos Pueblo, a Native American community abandoned in historic times. First a state monument in 1935, it was made Pecos National Monument in 1965, and greatly enlarged and renamed in 1990. Two sites within the park, the pueblo and the Glorieta Pass Battlefield, are National Historic Landmarks. Features Pecos National Historical Park's main unit is located in western San Miguel County, about east of Santa Fe and just south of Pecos. =Pecos Pueblo= The main unit of the park preserves the ruins of Pecos Pueblo, also known historically as Cicuye. The first Pecos pueblo was one of two dozen rock-and-mud villages built in the valley around AD 1100 in the prehistoric Pueblo II Era. Within 350 years the Pueblo IV Era Pecos village had grown to house more than 2,000 people in its five-storied complex. The main unit also protects the remains of Mission Nuestra Se√±ora de los √Ångeles de Porci√∫ncula de los Pecos, a Spanish mission near the pueblo built in the early 17th century. A self-guiding trail begins at the nearby visitor center and winds through the ruins of Pecos Pueblo and the mission church. Pecos Glazeware bowl from the early Spanish era, displayed in the Park museum. It is described as a \\"serpent figure.\\" Pecos was visited by expeditionaries with Francisco V√°squez de Coronado in 1540. The Spanish mission church was built in 1619. A traditional kiva was built in front of the church during the Pueblo Revolt in 1680 as a rejection of the Christian religion brought by Spanish colonists. However, when the Spanish returned in 1692, the Pecos community stayed on friendly terms with them. The site was abandoned in 1838, after the Pecos population suffered from marauding Comanches. The surviving remnant of the Pecos population moved to the Jemez Pueblo. The Pecos people enjoyed a rich culture with inventive architecture and beautiful crafts. They also possessed an elaborate religious life, evidenced by many ceremonial kivas. Farming was a main part of their diet and staple crops included the usual beans, corn, and squash. Their location, power and ability to supply goods made the Pecos a major trade center in the eastern part of the Puebloan territory, connecting the Pueblos to the Plains cultures such as the Comanche. =Forked Lightning Ranch= Another part of the park is the Forked Lightning Ranch, a cattle ranch established in the 1920s by Tex Austin, a famous producer of rodeos. It was headquartered at the Kozlowski's Stage Stop and Tavern, a stagecoach stop on the Santa Fe Trail that had also served as a Union forces encampment before the Battle of Glorieta Pass. It was only a cattle ranch for a time before Austin converted it into a dude ranch which he promoted to Easterners. The main ranch was designed by John Gaw Meem in the Pueblo Revival style. Austin's heavily mortgaged endeavour failed, closing in 1933. In 1936 the ranch again became a working cattle ranch, and in 1941 it was purchased by Buddy Fogelson, a Texas oilman who married actress Greer Garson. After her husband died, Garson sold her share of the park in 1991 to a conservation group, which donated it to the Park Service. =Old Santa Fe Trail= Portions of the historic Santa Fe Trail run through all units of the park. This rutted wagon trail was one of the major routes by which the American Southwest grew in the 19th century. =Glorieta Pass Battlefield= The Battle of Glorieta Pass was fought March 26‚Äì28, 1862 in the mountain pass west of Pecos Pueblo, along the route of the Old Santa Fe Trail. Confederate forces were en route to take Union-controlled Fort Union, and were fought to a standoff by militia raised in the Colorado Territory. Although parts of the battlefield have been compromised by highway construction, two sections of the battlefield have been preserved by the Park Service on either side of the pass. Access to these units is limited; requests should be made at the main unit visitor's center. Administrative history Pecos Pueblo and an area of was acquired by the state and preserved as a state monument in 1935. In 1965, President Lyndon Johnson established Pecos National Monument over the same area, and control was turned over the Park Service. In 1990 the main unit of the park was expanded to more than , including a large area of ranchland and archaeologically sensitive landscapes. The two units of the Glorieta Pass Battlefield were formally added to the park in 1993.

Formed in 1979, DS was affiliated to the United Secretariat of the Fourth International. DS was one of the first groups to affiliate with the Workers' Party (PT) when the PT formed in 1980. The activists in Socialist Democracy hoped to transform the PT into a revolutionary socialist party. As the PT grew, DS grew to become one of the largest Trotskyist organizations in the world. DS has been most prominent in the municipal government of Porto Alegre, where DS member Raul Pont was vice-mayor from 1992 to 1996 and mayor from 1996 to 2000, and the state government of Rio Grande do Sul. DS members played a significant role in the elaboration of the Participatory Budget (though they had initially opposed its introduction) and also in the arrangements for the three World Social Forums held in Porto Alegre. In recent years, the PT has become more moderate, especially after party leader Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva became President of Brazil in 2003. This caused tension in the entire left wing of the PT, including in Socialist Democracy. In 2004, Helo√≠sa Helena (a member of DS and a Brazilian Senator) and other dissident PT members were expelled from the party, and they formed the Socialism and Liberty Party (P-SOL). Part of the DS tendency remained in the PT, but another part left to join the P-SOL. Those who entered PSOL formed a tendency called Enlace. The DS majority remaining in the PT has come to be the core of attempts to unseat the PT's current leadership, with DS member Raul Pont narrowly losing with 48% of the votes in a 2005 election for the presidency of the PT.

It was redesignated as a national historical park from its previous status as national monument on October 18, 1972. The park in its various forms has sought to commemorate the Tlingit and Russian experiences in Alaska. History The history of Alaska's oldest federally designated cultural and historic park dates back to June 21, 1890 when President Benjamin Harrison set aside the site of the Tlingit fort Shis'k√≠ Noow (Tlingit for \\"Sapling Fort\\") for public use. The site, located near the mouth of the Indian River, served in 1804 as the location of an armed conflict between the native Tlingit people and Russian fur hunters (accompanied by their Aleut allies), known today as the Battle of Sitka. From 1903 to 1905, District Governor John G. Brady set about acquiring Native totem poles from all over Alaska for display at the park; the majority of the poles came from Haida villages located on Prince of Wales Island, while others had been on display at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition.Patrick, Andrew (2002). The Most Striking of Objects: The Totem Poles of Sitka National Historical Park. Anchorage, AK: U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service. Shortly thereafter, a group of influential Sitkans concerned about vandalism and the poor condition of the park in general pressured the federal government to declare the site a national monument. Detail of a raven head on a totem pole The Sitka National Monument was proclaimed by President William H. Taft under the Antiquities Act on March 23, 1910 to preserve the fort site and totem pole collection and protect them from further harm. With the creation of the National Park Service in 1916, the monument fell under the new agency's care, though no significant appropriation was made until 1921. Many of the poles exhibited today along the park's two miles (3.2 kilometers) of wooded pathways are replicas of the deteriorating originals, now held in protective storage. Interspersed among the giant Sitka spruce trees are a variety of ferns, shrubs and flowers. Salmon can be seen swimming up Indian River during spawning season. The 112-acre (45-hectare) park was placed under the control of the U.S. Army in 1942 and briefly occupied for defensive purposes, during which a series of military construction projects resulted in the removal of massive amounts of gravel from the park's river, shoreline and estuary. Environmental impacts from the gravel removal were to be a major resource issue for decades after. Responsibility for the park was formally returned to the Department of the Interior in 1947. In 1965, a new visitor center (the park's first true visitor facility, which provides space for exhibits and demonstrations of Alaska Native arts and crafts) was opened. The park was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. In a groundbreaking arrangement, the Alaska Native Brotherhood assumed control of the demonstration program and established its focus on Southeast Alaska Native cultural arts in 1969; the Southeast Alaska Indian Cultural Center celebrated its 30th anniversary in January 2000. Many of the remarkable Tlingit artifacts in the collection were loaned or donated by local clans under agreements designed to ensure ongoing, traditional use. Russian Bishop's House Located approximately one-half mile from the Park, the Russian Bishop's House was constructed out of native spruce in 1841-43 by Tlingit workers overseen by Finnish builders. It is one of only four surviving examples of Russian Colonial Style architecture in the Western Hemisphere. Bishop Innocent (Ivan Evseyevich Popov Veniaminov) of the Russian Orthodox Church, a clergyman, teacher and linguist, occupied the residence until 1853. The Church operated the facility as a school, residence, and place of worship for another century, until the dilapidated condition forced its abandonment in 1969 and sale in 1973 to the Park Service. In 1973, the Park Service embarked on a 16-year restoration project to return the property to its former glory. Modern plumbing, heating, and electrical systems were installed, while at the same time keeping the structure as authentic as possible. The second floor was restored to its 1853 appearance, based on archaeological evidence and early diaries and drawings. Today, numerous exhibits and lavish icons in the Chapel of the Annunciation convey the legacy of Russian America. The Russian Bishop's House is a National Historic Landmark; both it and the main area of the park are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 2005 it had 3.1 million profiles, by 2015 it had 5.77 million and as of 2016 it has 5.86 million. The database, which was growing in 2007 by 30,000 samples each month, is populated by samples recovered from crime scenes and taken from police suspects although data for those not charged or not found guilty are deleted. Only patterns of short tandem repeats are stored in the NDNAD ‚Äì not a person's full genomic sequence. Currently the sixteen loci of the DNA-17 system are analysed, resulting in a string of 32 numbers, being two allele repeats from each of the sixteen loci. Amelogenin is used for a rapid test of a donor's sex. However, individuals' skin or blood samples are also kept permanently linked to the database and can contain complete genetic information. Because DNA is inherited, the database can also be used to indirectly identify many others in the population related to a database subject. Stored samples can also degrade and become useless, particularly those taken with dry brushes and swabs. The UK NDNAD is run by the Home Office, after transferring from the custodianship of the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA) on 1 October 2012. A major expansion to include all known active offenders was funded between April 2000 and March 2005 at a cost of over ¬£300 million. Origin and function The United Kingdom's National DNA Database (NDNAD) was set up in 1995 using the Second Generation Multiplex (SGM) DNA profiling system (SGM+ DNA profiling system since 1998). All data held on the National DNA Database is governed by a tri-partite board consisting of the Home Office, the National Police Chiefs‚Äô Council and the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners, there are also independent representatives present from the Human Genetics Commission. The data held on the NDNAD is owned by the police authority which submitted the sample for analysis. The samples are stored permanently by the companies that analyse them, for an annual fee. All forensic service providers in the UK which meet the accredited standards can interact with the NDNAD. The UK's NDNAD is the foremost and largest forensic DNA database of its kind in the world ‚Äì containing nearly 10% of the population, compared to 0.5% in the USA. The data held on the National DNA Database consists of both demographic sample data and the numerical DNA profile. Records on the NDNAD are held for both individuals sampled under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) and for unsolved crime-stains (such as from blood, semen, saliva, hair and cellular materials left at a crime scene) Whenever a new profile is submitted, the NDNAD's records are automatically searched for matches (hits) between individuals and unsolved crime-stain records and unsolved crime-stain to unsolved crime-stain records - linking both individuals to crimes and crimes to crimes. Matches between individuals only are reported separately for investigation as to whether one is an alias of the other. Any NDNAD hits obtained are reported directly to the police force which submitted the sample for analysis. The NDNAD is widely acknowledged as an intelligence tool, for its ability to aid in the solving of crimes, both past and present. One-off speculative intelligence searches can be initiated by scientists in instances where a crime-stain DNA profile does not meet the required standard for loading to the NDNAD. These searches can produce many matches which may be restricted by demographic data. The latest innovative intelligence approach brought forward by the Forensic Science Service, is in the use of familial searching. This is a process that may be carried out in relation to unsolved crime-stains whereby a suspect's DNA may not be held on the NDNAD, but that of a close relative is. This method identifies potential relatives by identifying DNA profiles held on the NDNAD that are similar. Again many matches may be produced which may be restricted by demographic data. However, this technique raises new privacy concerns because it could lead to the police identifying cases of non-paternity. Control transferred to the National Policing Improvement Agency in 2007 In April 2007, responsibility for the delivery of National DNA Database (NDNAD) services was transferred from the Home Office to the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA).National Police Improvement Agency, NPIA and the DNA Database The agency's role was to run the database operations and maintain and ensure the integrity of the data, and to oversee the National DNA Database service so that it is operated in line with agreed standards. =Database subjects= England and Wales Though initially only samples from convicted criminals, or people awaiting trial, were recorded, the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 changed this to allow DNA to be retained from people charged with an offence, even if they were subsequently acquitted. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 later allowed DNA to be taken on arrest, rather than on charge. Between 2004 when this law came into force and 2012, anyone arrested in England and Wales on suspicion of involvement in any recordable offence (all except the most minor offences) had their DNA sample taken and stored in the database, whether or not they are subsequently charged or convicted. In 2005-06 45,000 crimes were matched against records on the DNA Database; including 422 homicides (murders and manslaughters) and 645 rapes.The national DNA database, Home Office However, not all these matches would have led to criminal convictions and some would be matches with innocent people who were at the crime scene. Critics argued that the decision to keep large numbers of innocent people on the database did not appear to have increased the likelihood of solving a crime using DNA. Since the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 in 2012, those not charged or not found guilty must have their DNA data deleted within a specified period of time. Scotland The PFSLD houses the DNA database for Scotland, and exports copies to the National DNA Database in England. Only samples from convicted criminals, or people awaiting trial, are recorded, although a new law will allow the DNA from people charged with a serious sexual or violent offence to be kept for up to five years after acquittal. Isle of Man Samples collected by the Isle of Man Constabulary's Scientific Support Department from crime scenes are sent to the UK for testing against the database. Samples from suspects are also added to the database, but are removed if the suspect is not convicted of the crime. Channel Islands Data supplied by the police of Jersey and Guernsey is also stored on the database. Legal challenges The issue of taking fingerprints and a DNA sample was involved in a case decided at the High Court in March 2006. A teacher who was accused of assault won the right to have her DNA sample and fingerprints destroyed. They had been taken whilst she was in custody, but after the Crown Prosecution Service had decided to not pursue any charges against her. She should have been released expeditiously once this was the case and so her continued detention to obtain samples was unlawful, and thus the samples were taken \\"without appropriate authority\\". Had they been taken before the decision not to prosecute, the samples would have been lawful and retained as normal under the rules at the time. After the 2012 Protection of Freedoms Act, they would have had to be destroyed within a specified period of time. = European Court of Human Rights = The DNA Database's indefinite retention policy was abolished by the 2012 Protection of Freedoms Act. Before that, a test case was filed by two claimants from Sheffield, Mr. S. and Michael Marper, both of whom had fingerprint records and DNA profiles held in the database. S and Marper were supported by the Liberty and Privacy International, non-profit pressure groups who were permitted to make amicus brief submissions to the court. S. was a minor, at 11 years old, when he was arrested and charged with attempted robbery on 19 January 2001; he was acquitted a few months later, on 14 June 2001. Michael Marper was arrested on 13 March 2001, and charged with harassment of his partner; the charge was not pressed because Marper and his partner became reconciled before a pretrial review had taken place. In November 2004 the Court of Appeal held that the keeping of samples from persons charged, yet not convicted - i.e. S and Marper - was lawful. However, an appeal was made to the European Court of Human Rights and the case was heard on 27 February 2008. On 4 December 2008, 17 judges unanimously ruled that there had been a violation of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which refers to a person's right to a private life, and awarded ‚Ç¨42,000 each to the appellants.BBC NEWS  UK  DNA database 'breach of rights', BBC, Thursday, 4 December 2008. The judges said keeping the information \\"could not be regarded as necessary in a democratic society\\".CASE OF S. AND MARPER v. THE UNITED KINGDOM, ECHR In response to this the Home Office announced in May 2009 a consultation on how they would comply with the ruling. The Home Office proposed to continue retaining indefinitely the DNA profiles of anyone convicted of any recordable offence, but to remove other profiles from the database after a period of time - generally 6 or 12 years, depending on the seriousness of the offence. The practice of taking DNA profiles upon arrest was not affected by the decision. On April 2010 the Crime and Security Act 2010 established that DNA profiles and fingerprints of anyone convicted of a recordable offence would be stored permanently, while those obtained on arrest, even when no conviction follows, would be stored for 6 years, renewable on new arrests. On 18 May 2011 the UK supreme court also ruled, by a majority, that the ACPO DNA retention guidelines at the time were unlawful because they were incompatible with article 8 of the ECHR. However, not wishing to step on the toes of Parliament discussing the same issue, they granted no other relief. Finally on 1 May 2012 the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 received Royal Assent. This act allowed the police to retain fingerprint and DNA data on NDNAD indefinitely for most people convicted of a recordable crime. Those not charged or not found guilty must have their DNA data deleted within a specified period of time. Privacy concerns The UK DNA database is one of the world's largest, and has prompted concerns from some quarters as to its scope and usage. Recordable offences include begging, being drunk and disorderly and taking part in an illegal demonstration. The use of the database for genetic research without consent has also been controversial, as has the storage of DNA samples and sensitive information by the commercial companies which analyse them for the police. Given the privacy issues, but set against the usefulness of the database in identifying offenders, some have argued for a system whereby the encrypted data associated with a sample is held by a third, trusted, party and is only revealed if a crime scene sample is found to contain that DNA. Such an approach has been advocated by the inventor of genetic fingerprinting, Alec Jeffreys. Others have argued that there should be time limits on how long DNA profiles can be retained on the Database, except for people convicted of serious violent or sexual offences. GeneWatch UK has launched a campaign calling on people to reclaim their DNA if they have not been charged or convicted of a serious offence, and has called for more safeguards to prevent misuse of the database.GeneWatch UK - Home The Human Genetics Commission has argued that individuals' DNA samples should be destroyed after the DNA profiles used for identification purposes have been obtained. The Liberal Democrats believed that innocent people's DNA should not be held on the database indefinitely. They launched a national online petition arguing that whilst they believe \\"DNA is a vital tool in the fight against crime, there was no legitimate reason for the police to retain for life the DNA records of innocent people.\\"Protect innocent people's DNA They revealed figures in November 2007 showing that nearly 150,000 children under the age of 16 have their details on the database.Liberal Democrats : Almost 150,000 children on DNA database - Clegg The Conservative Party objected to the database on the grounds that Parliament had not been given the opportunity to vote on it. Damian Green, former Tory home affairs spokesman, issued a press release in January 2006 stating: \\"We do have concerns about the Government including on the database the DNA and fingerprints of completely innocent people.... If the Government wants a database which has the details of everyone, not just criminals, they should be honest about it and not construct it by stealth.\\"Damian Green /// MP for Ashford, shadow minister for immigration Mr Green had his own DNA profile on the database for a time having been arrested and subsequently released without charge on 27 November 2008. A YouGov poll published on 4 December 2006, indicated that 48% of those interviewed disapproved of keeping DNA records of those who have not been charged with any crime, or who have been acquitted, with 37% in favour.Survey Report In early 2007, five civil servants were suspended and sued in the High Court by the Forensic Science Service after being accused of industrial espionage and for allegedly copying confidential information and using it to establish a rival firm. In 2009 the Home Office consulted on plans to extend the period of DNA retention to twelve years for serious crimes and six years for other crimes.The Guardian, 19 July 2009, DNA database plans based on 'flawed science', warn experts According to the official figures, enough searches (around 2.5 trillion by 2009) had been run on the NDNAD such that statistically at least two matches (a 1 in a trillion chance, under ideal conditions) should have arisen by chance. However, depending on factors such as the number of incomplete profiles and the presence of related individuals, the chance matches might actually be higher. However the official position was that no chance matches have occurred,Brian Costello, Crimeline, Are DNA ‚Äòcold hits‚Äô resulting in miscarriages? a position backed up by the fact that the majority of the searches would have been repeated, and that there are not 1 trillion unique DNA profiles on file. In July 2009, a lawyer, Lorraine Elliot, was arrested on accusations of forgery which were quickly proven to be false. A DNA sample was taken from her and logged. She was cleared of the accusations a day later and exonerated. However, Mrs Elliot subsequently lost her job (even though she was completely innocent of any crime) when the fact that her DNA profile was stored on the national database was discovered during a subsequent work-related security check. In 2010 she was finally able to have her details removed from the database. Racial demographics and controversy Census data and Home Office statistics indicated that by 2007 almost 40% of black men had their DNA profile on the database compared to 13% of Asian men and 9% of white men. In July 2006, the Black Police Association called for an inquiry into why the database held details of 37% of black men but fewer than 10% of white men. In November 2006, similar concerns were raised by the Sunday Telegraph which claimed that three in four young black men were on the DNA database. According to the Sunday Telegraph, an estimated 135,000 black males aged 15 to 34 would have been added to the DNA database by April 2007, equivalent to 77 percent of the young black male population in England and Wales. By contrast, only 22 per cent of young white males, and six per cent of the general population, would be on the database. This figure was confirmed by the British Government‚Äôs own Human Genetics Commission 2009 report on the topic, titled Nothing to hide, nothing to fear? Balancing individual rights and the public interest in the governance and use of the National DNA Database, which said that \\"the profiles of over three quarters of young black men between the ages of 18 and 35 are recorded.\\" Nothing to hide, nothing to fear? Balancing individual rights and the public interest in the governance and use of the National DNA Database, Human Genetics Commission. November 2009 One explanation for the racial disparities is racial bias towards certain demographics, as evidenced by the reaction of the then chair of the home affairs select committee, Keith Vaz MP, in August 2009 who said that \\"Such disparity in the treatment of different ethnic groups is bound to lead to a disintegration of community relations and a lack of trust in the police force.\\" These allegations have been refuted by the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA), which used to run the National DNA database. According to the NPIA, the database is a successful tool in fighting crime and points out that \\"between April 09 and 28th January 2010 the National DNA Database produced 174 matches to murder, 468 to rapes and 27,168 to other crime scenes.\\" National Police Improvement Agency, The National DNA Database In addition, the NPIA says that the ¬®National¬® DNA Database continues to provide police with the most effective tool for the prevention and detection of crime since the development of fingerprint analysis over 100 years ago. Since 1998, more than 300,000 crimes have been detected with the aid of the Database, reassuring the public that offenders are more likely to be brought to justice.\\" Profiles retained on the DNA Database by ethnic appearance as of 2015 were; 76% White North European, 2.1% White South European, 7.5% black, 5.2% Asian, 0.8% Middle Eastern, 0.6% Chinese, Japanese or South East Asian, and 8.0% unknown.National Police Improvement Agency, NDNAD by Ethnic Appearance Potential expansion of database The idea of expanding the database to cover the entire UK population has drawn some support as well strong criticism from experts such as the Nuffield Council on Bioethics,BBC, 18 September 2007, Experts call for DNA restrictions Nuffield Council on Bioethics, 18 September 2007, The forensic use of bioinformation: ethical issues but been rejected for the moment by the UK government as impractical and problematic for civil liberties.

The Franciscan church of Mission San Jos√© de Tumac√°cori, across the river from and replacing Mission San Cayetano de Tumac√°cori, was built in the 1750s. The third mission was established in 1756, Mission San Cayetano de Calabazas. The Mission San Jos√© de Tumac√°cori complex is open to the public. Nearby are the park's visitor center and the Tumac√°cori Museum in a historic Mission Revival style building. The Guevavi and Calabazas missions are not open to the general public, but can be visited on reserved tours led by park staff. The Tumac√°cori missions complex was originally protected as Tumac√°cori National Monument, in 1908 by President Theodore Roosevelt. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. In 1990 the national monument was redesignated a National Historical Park. The Guevavi and Calabazas mission units were added to the Tumac√°cori missions complex unit, within the new Tumac√°cori National Historical Park. The site was on the route of the 1775-1776 Juan Bautista de Anza Expedition from New Spain to Alta California, the first Spanish overland expedition to claimed but un-colonized upper Las Californias territory.

Mission San Jos√© de Tumac√°cori. Mission San Jos√© de Tumac√°cori Mission San Jos√© de Tumac√°cori was established in 1691 by Jesuit padre Eusebio Kino in a different nearby location. It was established one day before Mission Los Santos √Ångeles de Guevavi, making it the oldest Jesuit mission site in southern Arizona. The first mission was named Mission San Cayetano de Tumac√°cori, established at an existing native O'odham or Sobaipuri settlement on the east side of the Santa Cruz River. After the Pima rebellion of 1751, the mission was moved to the present site on the west side of the Santa Cruz River and renamed San Jos√© de Tumac√°cori.NPS‚ÄîTumac√°cori National Historical Park: Mission San Jos√© de Tumac√°cori By 1848, the mission was abandoned and began falling into severe disrepair. In 1854 it became a part of the U.S. Arizona Territory, after the Gadsden Purchase. Restoration and stabilization efforts began in 1908 when the site was declared Tumac√°cori National Monument by President Theodore Roosevelt. In 1990 it became part of the new Tumac√°cori National Historical Park.  Tumac√°cori Museum  Folkl√≥rico dancers performing at Tumac√°cori's annual Fiesta Tumac√°cori Museum was built in 1937 within what was then Tumac√°cori National Monument and is now Tumac√°cori National Historical Park. Designed by Scofield Delong, it contains interpretative displays relating to three historic missions preserved within the park, and includes artwork created by artist Herbert A. Collins. The museum building, a fine example of Mission Revival style architecture, with Spanish Colonial Revival details, was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1987.

The site is located about west of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, near Cheyenne, Oklahoma. Just before dawn on November 27, 1868, the village was attacked by the 7th U.S. Cavalry under Lt. Col. George Custer. In the Battle of Washita, the Cheyenne suffered large numbers of casualties. The strike was hailed at the time by the military and many civilians as a significant victory aimed at reducing Indian raids on frontier settlements as it forced the Cheyenne back to the reservation set aside for them. The site is a small portion of a large area that was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1965, and and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. The landmarked area encompasses the entire battlefield, which extends for some through the city of Cheyenne. Description The Washita Battlefield National Historic Site is located just a few miles west of the town of Cheyenne, on the north side of Oklahoma State Highway 47. The main body of the site is located between SR 47A and the Washita River, with the visitors center located near the junction of 47 and 47A. It is completely surrounded by the Black Kettle National Grassland, and consists mainly of open prairie, with strips of trees in the riparian area of the river. Trails lead from the parking area on 47A through the park. The visitors center features exhibits about the battle, the soldiers and the Cheyenne, as well as a film and a bookstore.

Landscape areas mainly to the east, north, and south include ridge lines that were the areas from which Custer's attack was launched. Portions of the battlefield extend into Cheyenne, and have been compromised by the construction of roads and railroads through the area. The historic site includes one of the largest and best-preserved tracts, including the village of the Cheyenne, which was the focal point of the battle.

They include Cusco Quechua, Puno Quechua, North Bolivian Quechua, and South Bolivian Quechua. Together with Ayacucho Quechua, which is mutually intelligible, they form the Southern Quechua language. In 1975, the term \\"Cusco-Collao\\" was coined by the government of Juan Velasco Alvarado as the name of one of six officially recognized regional varieties of Quechua in Peru, and is still used in both Spanish and Quechua forms in publications of the Peruvian governmentYachakuqkunapa Simi Qullqa - Qosqo Qollaw.

Concerning vocabulary, Cusco Quechua is closest to Ayacucho Quechua, with which it has 96% lexical similarity,Ethnologue report for language code: quy (Quechua, Ayacucho) whereas Puno Quechua and the Bolivian Quechua varieties have borrowed more lexicon and morphology from AymaraEthnologue report for language code: qxp (Quechua, Puno) and Spanish (e.g. the diminutive suffix -ita, -itu, -sita, -situ instead of -cha: cf. \\"small stone\\": rumisitu in Bolivia vs. rumicha in both Cusco and Ayacucho). Typical for Cusco-Collao dialects is the appearance of subordinating conjunctions, e.g. imaraykuchus (because) and sichus (if), or relative pronouns, e.g. pitachus (whom) or imachus (that, what), which are uncommon in Ayacucho Quechua and other Quechua varieties.

The series was written by Ron Marz and Peter David, with art by Dan Jurgens and Claudio Castellini. The special crossover series pitted Marvel Comics superheroes against their DC counterparts in battle. The outcome of each battle was determined by reader ballot, which were distributed in advance to comic book stores. Plot Two god-like Brothers who personify the DC and Marvel Universes each become aware of the other's existence, and challenge one another to a series of duels involving each universe's respective superheroes. The losing universe would cease to exist. The story had an \\"out of universe\\" component in that the outcomes of the primary battles were determined by the readers' votes. Numerous smaller, story-driven skirmishes occur throughout the series, not counted with the primary duels meant to determine the outcome between the Brothers. There were 11 battles fought between the two universes. The result of the following six battles were determined by the miniseries' creative team: *Aquaman (DC) vs. Namor the Sub- Mariner (Marvel). Aquaman won by summoning a whale to leap out of the water and land on top of Namor. Since Namor is pinned and unable to move, he is declared the loser. *Elektra (Marvel) vs. Catwoman (DC). Elektra won by cutting off Catwoman's whip as she hung from a girder on a building under construction, but Catwoman survived by falling into a dumpster filled with sand. *The Flash (DC) vs. Quicksilver (Marvel). The Flash won using superior speed. *Robin (DC) vs. Jubilee (Marvel). Robin won by using his cape as a decoy and then tying up Jubilee. *The Silver Surfer (Marvel) vs. Green Lantern (DC). The Silver Surfer won when both collided with each other and released a huge explosion which knocked out Green Lantern, but left the Silver Surfer unfazed. *Thor (Marvel) vs. Captain Marvel (DC). Thor won when Captain Marvel was forced to change back to his alter ego of Billy Batson. Billy tried to change back, but Thor used Mjolnir to intercept the lightning bolt that would have transformed him back into Captain Marvel; the resulting impact knocked Billy out and sent Thor's hammer flying off into the distance. The result of the following five battles were determined by the readers' votes: *Superman (DC) vs. the Hulk (Marvel). After exchanging punches and a burst of heat vision, Superman won the fight eventually. *Spider-Man (Marvel) vs. Superboy (DC). With the advantage of his spider-sense, Spider-Man won by tying up Superboy with impact webbing and electrocuting him with high voltage, knocking him out. *Batman (DC) vs. Captain America (Marvel). The match ends in uncertainty - though both are evenly matched after hours of combat, a sudden flushing of the sewer knocks Captain America off balance as Batman manages to strike him with a batarang. Batman rescues Captain America from certain death via drowning, but Captain America's unconsciousness from nearly drowning causes him to lose. *Wolverine (Marvel) vs. Lobo (DC). Wolverine beats Lobo in a brutal barfight, which was largely off-panel. *Storm (Marvel) vs. Wonder Woman (DC). After Wonder Woman drops Thor's hammer in order to allow the fight to happen as it was intended to, Storm won the battle after repeatedly hitting Wonder Woman with lightning after a brief mele√© encounter. Although the final victor of the fight is unknown, the new character of Access, a man capable of traversing between the two universes, infuses Batman and Captain America each with fragments of their respective universes before the Spectre and the Living Tribunal attempt to create a compromise by fusing the two universes together. This resulted in the creation of the Amalgam Universe, which sees various amalgamated versions of the heroes and villains acting as though they have been in existence for years. Access is eventually able to find the Dark Claw and Super-Soldier - versions of Batman and Captain America who have been 'amalgamated' with Wolverine and Superman, respectively - and use the fragments of the original universes in them to return the universes to normal. As the Brothers engage in direct battle, the Spectre and the Living Tribunal attempt to stop the conflict, but Batman and Captain America convince Access to take them to the conflict as well. Reading the minds of Batman and Captain America as they try to stop the fight, the Brothers realize that the two men are essentially the Brothers in miniature, each one unique among their worlds, but with no interest in the conflict that the Brothers have engaged in. Realizing the pointlessness of the conflict, the Brothers withdraw and congratulate each other, with both of them saying together \\"You've done well.\\" Collected editions The series was collected into a trade paperback titled DC versus Marvel Comics (collects the miniseries and Doctor Strangefate #1 (April 1996); 163 pages; September 1996; ).

She is a member of the Committee for the Basic Law of the National People's Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC) since 1997 and the chairman of the Operations Review Committee of the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) since 2015. As a successful politician early on, Tam was a member of the four different levels of representative councils, Executive Council, Legislative Council, Urban Council and Central and Western District Board in colonial Hong Kong in the 1980s. She was also a member of the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee and took up various appointments from the Beijing government after she departed from the colonial government over the conflict of interest scandal in 1991. Since 1997, she has become one of the most recognisable spokesmen and \\"most loyal mouthpieces\\" for the Beijing authorities on constitutional matters such as the interpretations of the Basic Law and constitutional reforms, in which she has always firmly stood and defended Beijing's controversial decisions. Early colonial career Tam was born on 2 November 1945 in Hong Kong to Tam Chung, a senior police officer. She graduated from the St. Paul's Co-educational College before she obtained a Bachelor of Laws from the University of London and her admission as a barrister at the Gray's Inn. She first stepped into politics when she ran in the 1979 Urban Council election as an advocate for women's rights. She was elected with more than 5,000 votes, the third ranked in the election behind veteran Urban Councillors Elsie Elliott and Denny Huang. She was soon be appointed to sit on the Legislative Council in 1981. She was one of the recipients of the Ten Outstanding Young Persons Award and was appointed Justice of the Peace in 1982. She became the appointed member of the Central and Western District Board when the board was first created in 1982 under the district administration reform by Governor Murray MacLehose. She became a member of four different levels of representative councils in Hong Kong when she was appointed to the Executive Council, the top advisory body in the colonial government in 1983. Transition period During her era the Sino- British negotiations over the Hong Kong sovereignty after 1997 took place. She was one of the members of the delegation of the unofficial members of the Executive and Legislative Councils (UMELC) led by Sir Chung Sze-yuen to London and Beijing to lobby for the interests of the Hong Kong people. In December 1984 when she met with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, she raised the question of the proposed Sino-British Joint Declaration and the \\"possible incompatibility between the Chinese constitution and the basic law\\", especially the protection of human rights. She was appointed by the Beijing government to sit on the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee in 1985 which was responsible for the drafting of the Basic Law of Hong Kong, the mini- constitution of the post-1997 Hong Kong. She was also awarded an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in 1985, and a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in 1988. Chinese University of Hong Kong Citation She founded both the Federation of Women Lawyers and the Junior Police Officers' Association.Hong Kong police urged to reject ‚Äòquestionable‚Äô cash for jailed officers‚Äô families, SCMP, 6 Mar, 2017 As the colonial government intended to introduce greater representative democracy in the transition period, Tam also founded the Progressive Hong Kong Society (PHKS) in 1985 to participate in the elections. The Progressive Hong Kong Society became the backbone of the Liberal Democratic Federation of Hong Kong (LDF) set by the a group of conservative business and professional elites in 1990 for the preparation of the first direct election of the Legislative Council in 1991, of which she became the vice-chairman of the new party. However, Tam's political career seemed to come to an end when she was found to be in a potential conflict of interest as she was involved in her family's taxi company while also being a member and former chairman of the Transport Advisory Committee. Although she eventually abandoned her shares in the company under pressure, she was not re-appointed by Governor David Wilson in the Executive and Legislative Councils after the incident. A new set of guidelines was also introduced requiring members of the councils to declare their business interests. Pro-Beijing career After her departure from the colonial government, she found favour from the Beijing authorities. She accepted various appointments in the run up to 1997, including to the Preparatory Committee for the HKSAR, and as a Hong Kong Affairs Advisor and member of the Selection Committee. She was elected to the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) installed by Beijing. She subsequently resigned from the PLC to take a seat on the Basic Law Committee of the National People's Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC) in 1997. In that capacity, Tam became one of the most loyal mouthpieces of the Beijing authorities on legal matters, especially in defence of controversial interpretations of the Basic Law and in the constitutional reform debate after 1997.Vines, Steven (25 Mar 1997). \\"Tycoons shift allegiance as Britain's power wanes\\". The Independent In 1997, she led the Liberal Democratic Federation to merge with the Hong Kong Progressive Alliance (HKPA), another pro-business pro-Beijing party. In 2005 when the Progressive Alliance was merged into the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB), Tam became the party vice-chairman from 2005 to 2007. She also held various public positions at the time, such as member of the Urban Renewal Authority and the Airport Authority Hong Kong. During the highly controversial national security legislation of the Basic Law Article 23 which later caused a record number of more than 500,000 people demonstration on 1 July 2003, Tam supported the government's decision to pass the bill. She even said that anyone who did not support the Article 23 legislation was not fit to be Chinese. In the constitutional reform debates in 2005 and 2010, Tam led the opposition against the pro-democrats' demand for the universal suffrage of Chief Executive and Legislative Council and defended the government's proposals. In February 2006, Tam joined the board of subsequently Hong Kong-listed mainland Nine Dragons Paper Holdings Limited, one of the world's largest paperboard manufacturers, whose conditions for workers at its plants were sharply criticised in the 2008 human rights report by the US Congressional-Executive Commission on China and by Hong Kong's Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehaviour (SACOM).Bluebox recycler cited for abuses, 23 February 2009. Toronto Star Recent career Tam became the convenor of National People's Congress Hong Kong delegation from March 2013. On the matter of the universal suffrage of the Chief Executive, Tam said the United Nations' International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights indicated that the right to be elected is not universal. She also suggested that an interpretation of the Basic Law by Beijing could be the last option for determining how universal suffrage could be implemented for the 2017 Chief Executive election. In the 2014 constitutional reform debate, Tam actively opposed the pro-democrats' campaign for the \\"public nomination\\" of the Chief Executive, saying that was against the Basic Law, which states that candidates shall be put forward by a nominating committee. She received the Grand Bauhinia Medal (GBM), the highest award under the HKSAR honours and awards system, on 1 July 2013. In 2015, Tam was appointed chairman of the Operations Review Committee of the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) by Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying.ICAC Advisory Committees Under her spell, high-flying head of investigations Rebecca Li Bo-lan was controversially sacked. The sudden dismissal came during Li's enquiry into possible impropriety relating to a $50 million payment made to Leung Chun-ying.Hong Kong Anti-Graft Watchdog Under Threat, Asia Sentinel, 11 July 2016 In 2017, Tam was the founding president of the Junior Police Officers‚Äô Association fund which raised over HK$10 million for the families of the seven police officers who were convicted and jailed for two years for beating activist Ken Tsang Kin-chiu at the height of the Occupy protests in 2014.

On November 29, 1847, Dr. Marcus Whitman, his wife Narcissa Whitman, and 11 others were slain by Native Americans of the Cayuse. The site commemorates the Whitmans, their role in establishing the Oregon Trail, and the challenges encountered when two cultures meet. History In 1836, a small group of Methodist missionaries traveled with the annual fur trapper's caravan into \\"Oregon Country\\". Among the group, Narcissa Whitman and Eliza Hart Spalding became the first white women to travel across the continent. Marcus Whitman and his wife Narcissa Whitman established the Whitman Mission at Waiilatpu, near the Walla Walla River. The mission was in the Cayuse territory. The Cayuse were a warring tribe and were suspicious of the Whitmans. Relations between the Whitmans and the Cayuse improved greatly when Marcus Whitman attempted to learn the Cayuse language. While Dr. Whitman had learned the Cayuse language he was insistent that the Cayuse should learn the white man's way of living by becoming farmers. Differences in culture led to growing tensions between the native Cayuse people and the Whitmans. 248x248px The Mission became an important stop along the Oregon Trail from 1843-1847, and passing immigrants added to the tension. With the influx of white settlers the Cayuse became suspicious of the Whitmans again, fearing that the white man was coming to take the land. A measles outbreak in November 1847 killed half the local Cayuse. The measles also broke out in the Mission but more white settlers survived. Some of the Cayuse blamed the devastation of their tribe on Dr. Whitman and Mrs. Whitman. They were killed along with eleven others; forty-seven other mission residents were taken hostage. The deaths of the Whitmans shocked the country, prompting Congress to make Oregon a U.S. territory, and precipitated the Cayuse War. In more recent times, the site has been excavated for important artifacts, and then reburied. A memorial obelisk, erected fifty years after the event, stands on a nearby hill. The historic site was established in 1936 as Whitman National Monument and was redesignated a National Historic Site on January 1, 1963.

It is distributed under the MIT License. Implementation FreeRTOS is designed to be small and simple. The kernel itself consists of only three C files. To make the code readable, easy to port, and maintainable, it is written mostly in C, but there are a few assembly functions included where needed (mostly in architecture-specific scheduler routines). FreeRTOS provides methods for multiple threads or tasks, mutexes, semaphores and software timers. A tick-less mode is provided for low power applications. Thread priorities are supported. FreeRTOS applications can be completely statically allocated. Alternatively RTOS objects can be dynamically allocated with five schemes of memory allocation provided: * allocate only; * allocate and free with a very simple, fast, algorithm; * a more complex but fast allocate and free algorithm with memory coalescence; * an alternative to the more complex scheme that includes memory coalescence that allows a heap to be broken across multiple memory areas. * and C library allocate and free with some mutual exclusion protection. There are none of the more advanced features typically found in operating systems like Linux or Microsoft Windows, such as device drivers, advanced memory management, user accounts, and networking. The emphasis is on compactness and speed of execution. FreeRTOS can be thought of as a 'thread library' rather than an 'operating system', although command line interface and POSIX-like I/O abstraction add-ons are available. FreeRTOS implements multiple threads by having the host program call a thread tick method at regular short intervals. The thread tick method switches tasks depending on priority and a round-robin scheduling scheme. The usual interval is 1/1000 of a second to 1/100 of a second, via an interrupt from a hardware timer, but this interval is often changed to suit a particular application. The download contains prepared configurations and demonstrations for every port and compiler, allowing rapid application design. The FreeRTOS.org site also contains a lot of documentation and RTOS tutorials (additional manuals and tutorials are available for a fee), as well as details of the RTOS design. Key features * Book and reference manuals. * Small memory footprint, low overhead, and fast execution. * Tick- less option for low power applications. * Intended for both hobbyists and professional developers working on commercial products. * Scheduler can be configured for both preemptive or cooperative operation. * Coroutine support (coroutines in FreeRTOS are simple and lightweight tasks with limited use of the call stack) * Trace support through generic trace macros.

This is FreeRTOS with libraries for IOT support, specifically for Amazon Web Services. Since version 10.0.0 in 2017, Amazon has taken stewardship of the FreeRTOS code, including any updates to the original kernel. = SAFERTOS = SAFERTOS was developed as a complementary version of FreeRTOS, with common functionality but designed specifically for safety-critical implementation. FreeRTOS was subjected to HAZOP, and weaknesses were identified and resolved. The result was put through a full IEC 61508 SIL 3 development life cycle, the highest level for a software-only component. SAFERTOS was developed by WITTENSTEIN High Integrity Systems, in partnership with Real Time Engineers Ltd, primary developer of the FreeRTOS project. Both SAFERTOS and FreeRTOS share the same scheduling algorithm, have similar APIs, and are otherwise very similar, but they were developed with differing objectives.Relationship between FreeRTOS and SAFERTOS SAFERTOS was developed solely in the C language to meet requirements for certification to IEC61508. SAFERTOS can reside solely in the on-chip read only memory of a microcontroller for standards compliance. When implemented in hardware memory, SAFERTOS code can only be utilized in its original, already- certified, configuration. This means certification of systems do not need to re-test the kernel portion of their designs. SAFERTOS is included in the ROM of some Stellaris MicrocontrollersTI Stellaris Product range from Texas Instruments. SAFERTOS source code does not need to be separately purchased. In this usage scenario, a C header file is used to map SAFERTOS API functions to their location in read-only memory. = OPENRTOS = OPENRTOS is a commercially-licensed version of Amazon FreeRTOS, sold by WITTENSTEIN High Integrity Systems. This product provides support and allows companies to use the Amazon FreeRTOS kernel and libraries without the a:FreeRTOS MIT license.

Thin-layer chromatography is performed on a sheet of glass, plastic, or aluminium foil, which is coated with a thin layer of adsorbent material, usually silica gel, aluminium oxide (alumina), or cellulose. This layer of adsorbent is known as the stationary phase. After the sample has been applied on the plate, a solvent or solvent mixture (known as the mobile phase) is drawn up the plate via capillary action. Because different analytes ascend the TLC plate at different rates, separation is achieved. The mobile phase has different properties from the stationary phase. For example, with silica gel, a very polar substance, non-polar mobile phases such as heptane are used. The mobile phase may be a mixture, allowing chemists to fine-tune the bulk properties of the mobile phase. After the experiment, the spots are visualized. Often this can be done simply by projecting ultraviolet light onto the sheet; the sheets are treated with a phosphor, and dark spots appear on the sheet where compounds absorb the light impinging on a certain area. Chemical processes can also be used to visualize spots; anisaldehyde, for example, forms colored adducts with many compounds, and sulfuric acid will char most organic compounds, leaving a dark spot on the sheet. To quantify the results, the distance traveled by the substance being considered is divided by the total distance traveled by the mobile phase. (The mobile phase must not be allowed to reach the end of the stationary phase.) This ratio is called the retardation factor (Rf). In general, a substance whose structure resembles the stationary phase will have low Rf, while one that has a similar structure to the mobile phase will have high retardation factor. Retardation factors are characteristic, but will change depending on the exact condition of the mobile and stationary phase. For this reason, chemists usually apply a sample of a known compound to the sheet before running the experiment. Thin-layer chromatography can be used to monitor the progress of a reaction, identify compounds present in a given mixture, and determine the purity of a substance. Specific examples of these applications include: analyzing ceramides and fatty acids, detection of pesticides or insecticides in food and water, analyzing the dye composition of fibers in forensics, assaying the radiochemical purity of radiopharmaceuticals, or identification of medicinal plants and their constituents A number of enhancements can be made to the original method to automate the different steps, to increase the resolution achieved with TLC and to allow more accurate quantitative analysis. This method is referred to as HPTLC, or \\"high-performance TLC\\". HPTLC typically uses thinner layers of stationary phase and smaller sample volumes, thus reducing the loss of resolution due to diffusion. Plate preparation TLC plates are usually commercially available, with standard particle size ranges to improve reproducibility. They are prepared by mixing the adsorbent, such as silica gel, with a small amount of inert binder like calcium sulfate (gypsum) and water. This mixture is spread as a thick slurry on an unreactive carrier sheet, usually glass, thick aluminum foil, or plastic. The resultant plate is dried and activated by heating in an oven for thirty minutes at 110 ¬∞C. The thickness of the absorbent layer is typically around 0.1‚Äì0.25 mm for analytical purposes and around 0.5‚Äì2.0 mm for preparative TLC.Tables showing the thickness value of commercial regular and preparative Thin Layer Chromatography plates Technique The process is similar to paper chromatography with the advantage of faster runs, better separations, and the choice between different stationary phases. Because of its simplicity and speed, TLC is often used for monitoring chemical reactions and for the qualitative analysis of reaction products. Plates can be labeled before or after the chromatography process using a pencil or other implement that will not interfere or react with the process. To run a thin layer chromatography plate, the following procedure is carried out:Thin Layer Chromatography: How To http://www.reachdevices.com/TLC.html * Using a capillary tube, a small spot of solution containing the sample is applied to a plate, about 1.5 centimeters from the bottom edge. The solvent is allowed to completely evaporate off to prevent it from interfering with sample's interactions with the mobile phase in the next step. If a non-volatile solvent was used to apply the sample, the plate needs to be dried in a vacuum chamber. This step is often repeated to ensure there is enough analyte at the starting spot on the plate to obtain a visible result. Different samples can be placed in a row of spots the same distance from the bottom edge, each of which will move in its own adjacent lane from its own starting point. * A small amount of an appropriate solvent (eluent) is poured into a glass beaker or any other suitable transparent container (separation chamber) to a depth of less than 1 centimeter. A strip of filter paper (aka \\"wick\\") is put into the chamber so that its bottom touches the solvent and the paper lies on the chamber wall and reaches almost to the top of the container. The container is closed with a cover glass or any other lid and is left for a few minutes to let the solvent vapors ascend the filter paper and saturate the air in the chamber. (Failure to saturate the chamber will result in poor separation and non-reproducible results.) * The TLC plate is then placed in the chamber so that the spot(s) of the sample do not touch the surface of the eluent in the chamber, and the lid is closed. The solvent moves up the plate by capillary action, meets the sample mixture and carries it up the plate (elutes the sample). The plate should be removed from the chamber before the solvent front reaches the top of the stationary phase (continuation of the elution will give a misleading result) and dried. * Without delay, the solvent front, the furthest extent of solvent up the plate, is marked. * The plate is visualized. As some plates are pre-coated with a phosphor such as zinc sulfide, allowing many compounds to be visualized by using ultraviolet light; dark spots appear where the compounds block the UV light from striking the plate. Alternatively, plates can be sprayed or immersed in chemicals after elution. Various visualising agents react with the spots to produce visible results. = Separation process and principle= Different compounds in the sample mixture travel at different rates due to the differences in their attraction to the stationary phase and because of differences in solubility in the solvent.Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC): Principle with animation By changing the solvent, or perhaps using a mixture, the separation of components (measured by the Rf value) can be adjusted. Also, the separation achieved with a TLC plate can be used to estimate the separation of a flash chromatography column. (A compound elutes from a column when the amount of solvent collected is equal to 1/Rf.)Fair, J. D.; Kormos, C. M. J. Chromatogr. A 2008, 1211(1-2), 49-54. () Chemists often use TLC to develop a protocol for separation by chromatography and use TLC to determine which fractions contain the desired compounds. Development of a TLC plate. A purple spot separates into a red and blue spot. Surface of a freshly cut plank of Eucalyptus camaldulensis displaying thin-layer chromatography. The horizontal blue strip is from a reaction between the iron bandsaw supports and the acidic timber. Separation of compounds is based on the competition of the solute and the mobile phase for binding sites on the stationary phase. For instance, if normal-phase silica gel is used as the stationary phase, it can be considered polar. Given two compounds that differ in polarity, the more polar compound has a stronger interaction with the silica and is, therefore, better able to displace the mobile phase from the available binding sites. As a consequence, the less polar compound moves higher up the plate (resulting in a higher Rf value). If the mobile phase is changed to a more polar solvent or mixture of solvents, it becomes better at binding to the polar plate and therefore displacing solutes from it, so all compounds on the TLC plate will move higher up the plate. It is commonly said that \\"strong\\" solvents (eluents) push the analyzed compounds up the plate, whereas \\"weak\\" eluents barely move them. The order of strength/weakness depends on the coating (stationary phase) of the TLC plate. For silica gel-coated TLC plates, the eluent strength increases in the following order: perfluoroalkane (weakest), hexane, pentane, carbon tetrachloride, benzene/toluene, dichloromethane, diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, acetonitrile, acetone, 2-propanol/n-butanol, water, methanol, triethylamine, acetic acid, formic acid (strongest). For C18-coated plates the order is reverse. In other words, when the stationary phase is polar and the mobile phase is nonpolar, the method is normal-phase as opposed to reverse- phase. This means that if a mixture of ethyl acetate and hexane as the mobile phase is used, adding more ethyl acetate results in higher Rf values for all compounds on the TLC plate. Changing the polarity of the mobile phase will normally not result in reversed order of running of the compounds on the TLC plate. An eluotropic series can be used as a guide in selecting a mobile phase. If a reversed order of running of the compounds is desired, an apolar stationary phase should be used, such as C18-functionalized silica. Analysis As the chemicals being separated may be colorless, several methods exist to visualize the spots: * Fluorescent analytes, like quinine, may be detected under blacklight (366 nm) * Often a small amount of a fluorescent compound, usually manganese-activated zinc silicate, is added to the adsorbent that allows the visualization of spots under UV-C light (254 nm). The adsorbent layer will thus fluoresce light-green by itself, but spots of analyte quench this fluorescence. * Iodine vapors are a general unspecific color reagent * Specific color reagents into which the TLC plate is dipped or which are sprayed onto the plate exist.Thin Layer Chromatography stains http://www.reachdevices.com/TLC_stains.htmlJork, H., Funk, W., Fischer, W., Wimmer, H. (1990): Thin-Layer Chromatography: Reagents and Detection Methods, Volume 1a, VCH, Weinheim, Jork, H., Funk, W., Fischer, W., Wimmer, H. (1994): Thin-Layer Chromatography: Reagents and Detection Methods, Volume 1b, VCH, Weinheim **Potassium permanganate ‚Äì oxidation ** Bromine ** Acidic vanillin **Phosphomolybdic acid * In the case of lipids, the chromatogram may be transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane and then subjected to further analysis, for example mass spectrometry, a technique known as far- eastern blot. Once visible, the Rf value, or retardation factor, of each spot can be determined by dividing the distance the product traveled by the distance the solvent front traveled using the initial spotting site as reference. These values depend on the solvent used and the type of TLC plate and are not physical constants. Applications =Characterization= In organic chemistry, reactions are qualitatively monitored with TLC. Spots sampled with a capillary tube are placed on the plate: a spot of starting material, a spot from the reaction mixture, and a cross-spot with both. A small (3 by 7 cm) TLC plate takes a couple of minutes to run. The analysis is qualitative, and it will show if the starting material has disappeared, i.e. the reaction is complete, if any product has appeared, and how many products are generated (although this might be underestimated due to co-elution). Unfortunately, TLCs from low-temperature reactions may give misleading results, because the sample is warmed to room temperature in the capillary, which can alter the reaction‚Äîthe warmed sample analyzed by TLC is not the same as what is in the low-temperature flask. One such reaction is the DIBALH reduction of ester to aldehyde. In one study TLC has been applied in the screening of organic reactions,TLC plates as a convenient platform for solvent-free reactions Jonathan M. Stoddard, Lien Nguyen, Hector Mata-Chavez and Kelly Nguyen Chem. Commun., 2007, 1240 - 1241, for example in the fine- tuning of BINAP synthesis from 2-naphthol. In this method, the alcohol and catalyst solution (for instance iron(III) chloride) are placed separately on the baseline, then reacted, and then instantly analyzed. A special application of TLC is in the characterization of radiolabeled compounds, where it is used to determine radiochemical purity. The TLC sheet is visualized using a sheet of photographic film or an instrument capable of measuring radioactivity. It may be visualized using other means as well. This method is much more sensitive than the others and can be used to detect an extremely small amount of a compound, provided that it carries a radioactive atom. =Isolation= Since different compounds will travel a different distance in the stationary phase, chromatography can be used to isolate components of a mixture for further analysis. The separated compounds each occupying a specific area on the plate, they can be scraped off (along with the stationary phase particles) and dissolved into an appropriate solvent. As an example, in the chromatography of an extract of green plant material (for example spinach) shown in 7 stages of development, Carotene elutes quickly and is only visible until step 2. Chlorophyll A and B are halfway in the final step and lutein the first compound staining yellow. Once the chromatography is over, the carotene can be removed from the plate, extracted into a solvent and placed into a spectrophotometer to determine its spectrum. The quantities extracted are small and a technique such as column chromatography is preferred to separate larger amounts. However, big preparative TLC plates with thick silica gel coatings can be used to separate more than 100 mg of material. image:Chromatography of chlorophyll - Step 1.jpgStep 1 image:Chromatography of chlorophyll - Step 2.jpgStep 2 image:Chromatography of chlorophyll - Step 3.jpgStep 3 image:Chromatography of chlorophyll - Step 4.jpgStep 4 image:Chromatography of chlorophyll - Step 5.jpgStep 5 image:Chromatography of chlorophyll - Step 6.jpgStep 6 image:Chromatography of chlorophyll - Step 7.jpgStep 7 = Examining reactions and compound stability = TLC is also used for the identification of the completion of any chemical reaction. To determine this it is observed that at the beginning of a reaction the entire spot is occupied by the starting chemicals or materials on the plate. As the reaction starts taking place the spot formed by the initial chemicals starts reducing and eventually replaces the whole spot of starting chemicals with a new product present on the plate. The formation of an entirely new spot determines the completion of a reaction. Furthermore, two-dimensional TLC is frequently used as a method to check if a compound is stable in the stationary phase (such as silica gel, which is usually slightly acidic). For this purpose, the tested compound mixture is eluted twice in a square-shaped TLC plate, first in one direction and then rotated 90¬∫. If the target compound appears on the diagonal of the square, it is stable in silica gel and safe to purify. If it appears below the diagonal, it is decomposing on silica gel. If this is the case, purification can be attempted using neutralized silica gel (with triethylamine, for example), or an alternative stationary phase such as neutral alumina.

The station is owned by Entercom and airs an urban adult contemporary radio format. KTWV has studios on Wilshire Boulevard in the Miracle Mile district of Los Angeles, and its transmitter (shared with its former sister station KTTV) is located on Mount Wilson. KTWV is known for pioneering the smooth jazz radio format in the late 1980s. KTWV broadcasts in HD Radio. History =Early years (1961‚Äì1968)= On March 7, 1961, KLAC-FM first signed on the air. It served as an FM sister station to KLAC (570 AM), simulcasting its programming. KLAC-AM-FM were purchased by Metromedia in 1963. By the mid-1960s, the FCC wanted FM sisters to AM stations to air separate programming; thus, KLAC-FM became an automated station, playing a mix of middle-of-the-road and big band music like other FM stations owned by Metromedia. In order to separate itself further from its AM sister, the station changed its call letters to KMET in 1968. =KMET ‚Äî The Mighty Met (1968‚Äì1987)= A few months after the station adopted its new call sign, Tom Donahue convinced Metromedia to establish a freeform rock format on KMET and KSFR in San Francisco (which then became KSAN) after a dispute with the owners of KPPC-FM. Donahue brought over most of those who went on strike at KPPC, including his Los Angeles tag team partner in former KFWB \\"Swinging Gentleman\\" B. Mitchel Reed. He had become enamored with the underground rock sound after attending the Monterey Pop Festival and shortly afterward bonded with fellow top 40 veteran Donahue over their increasing unhappiness with AM radio and its restrictions. KMET became legendary and popular as \\"The Mighty 'MET\\" for its freeform style in letting DJs choose the music without genre restrictions and an irreverent, loose and laidback presentation of the music. In the early 1980s, however, Metromedia changed the presentation and sound of KMET to a more conventional album-oriented rock (AOR) format. In the process, KMET quickly became a shell of its former self: playlists were tightened and hit- oriented, disc jockeys became less personal in their presentation, and the station was heavily constructed by outside consultants. This drove KMET's ratings down to the point of being well behind established AOR pioneer KLOS as well as behind KROQ-FM, a station that rose from the ashes of KPPC-FM to become the trademark radio home in Los Angeles for the new wave and punk scenes in the 1980s. Then, in 1986, KMET got two new competitors that hurt the station irrevocably: KNAC, targeting younger listeners via the budding heavy metal genre that KMET wouldn't touch and more aggressively than KLOS and KROQ, and KLSX, targeting older listeners with the music that KMET made famous through the newly created classic rock genre. Both stations ate further into KMET's ratings immediately. Additionally in 1986, Metromedia ‚Äî which already sold off its TV stations (including KTTV) to News Corporation ‚Äî sold KMET and eight other stations for $250 million to a group of investors who rechristened the company Metropolitan Broadcasting (which had been Metromedia's original corporate name). End of the Mighty Met The new competition combined with the existing double threat of KLOS and KROQ-FM all drove KMET's ratings to a shocking low of 1.6 by January 1987. VP/GM Howard Bloom and program director Frank Cody considered retooling or tweaking the station's format again, to the point of hiring back KMET veterans including Jim Ladd with jock- friendly contracts and trying a modern rock-intensive approach targeting KROQ with a new \\"94.7% New Rock\\" slogan and identity. But in the end, research the station conducted came to the conclusion KMET had become too damaged and so the decision was made to pull the plug rather than another station retooling. On February 6, 1987, four days after making the decision, the entire KMET air staff was summoned one by one to the Sheraton Premiere Hotel in Universal City where they were told by Bloom and Cody they were being let go and the station was changing formats. The last live jock on the air that day was morning man Paraquat Kelly. He got word of what was happening, and at the end of his shift played \\"Beautiful Losers\\" by Bob Seger (dedicated to his co-workers) and \\"It's Only Rock 'n Roll (But I Like It)\\" by The Rolling Stones (for KMET itself). Choked with emotion, his last words were \\"We all love you. Goodbye, Southern California. This is KMET, the Mighty 'MET.\\" At that time, the station went jockless and automated while playing an ominous countdown to noon on February 14, 1987 set to the opening bars of Tangerine Dream's \\"Sunset Drive\\". Valentine's Day 1987 would be known as the \\"St. Valentine's Day Massacre\\" for Los Angeles rock fans. The last hour featured sentimental songs \\"My Generation\\" by The Who and \\"You're All I've Got Tonight\\" by The Cars, and California-inspired songs \\"L.A. Woman\\" by The Doors and \\"Hotel California\\" by The Eagles wrapped around classic KMET IDs by Tom Donahue and B. Mitchel Reed. Nearly 19 years of rock came to an end with \\"Funeral for a Friend\\" by Elton John, \\"Born to Run\\" by Bruce Springsteen, and then the second half of the Abbey Road medley by The Beatles with \\"Golden Slumbers\\", \\"Carry That Weight\\" and then ending with (appropriately) \\"The End\\".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kYYh_Hs-pc The fired KMET jocks were given the chance to give a full goodbye to listeners via on-air tributes from their former rivals KLOS and KLSX. They then were split between those two and KSCA, which would be launched by Gene Autry's Golden West Broadcasters that fall. KSCA and future eclectic rock station KSWD (which notably had multiple on-air tributes to KMET during its run) would both pay tribute to KMET's closing by themselves closing with Abbey Road with the former repeating KMET's closing (and signing off after playing the hidden finale \\"Her Majesty\\") and the latter playing all of Side 2 from \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" through \\"The End\\". =KTWV - 94.7 The Wave (1987‚Äìpresent)= New age contemporary/smooth jazz (1987-2010) Speculation for KMET's new format was between a first of its kind new age/smooth jazz/soft rock hybrid format, or a dance-rock format positioned between KIIS-FM, KPWR, and KROQ. In the end, on February 14, 1987 at noon, the station indeed flipped to the former, a format that eventually came to be called \\"new adult contemporary\\" (NAC) or simply \\"smooth jazz\\" with the branding \\"94.7 The Wave\\" and new call letters KTWV. The first song on The Wave was the fittingly titled \\"If You Love Somebody Set Them Free\\" by Sting, followed by the first instrumental, \\"Maputo\\" by Bob James and David Sanborn. In its initial 19 months, management referred to The Wave as a \\"mood service\\" rather than a radio station; the only live voices heard were those of personalities from Financial News Network doing news and traffic updates. In lieu of disc jockeys, listeners were encouraged to call a \\"Wave Line\\" to learn what the music being played was and the music was wrapped around pre-recorded vignettes called \\"Playlets\\" featuring \\"ordinary people\\" in unique situations (one of whom was voiced by Terry McGovern, coincidentally the former morning man on KSAN from 1974 to 1979) that noted the time as part of the dialogue. The launch of \\"The Wave\\" prompted stations across North America to adopt the NAC format. Markets with smooth jazz stations included Santa Cruz‚ÄîSan Jose (on KLRS), San Francisco (KKSF), Chicago (WNUA, formerly sister station WMET), Seattle (KNUA), San Diego (KIFM), (KOAI), Washington, D.C. (WBMW), and New York (WWCD, albeit with a more traditional presentation with jocks or announcers). Additionally, beginning in late 1987, Metropolitan Broadcasting syndicated the \\"Wave\\" format via the Satellite Music Network to other markets including San Diego (as KSWV), Kansas City (KCWV), Chicago (WTWV), Denver (KHIH), Detroit (WVAE), and notably Cleveland (WNWV). From 2000 to 2011, there was a station in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada modeled entirely after KTWV, CIWV- FM (which also served nearby Toronto). That station used the moniker \\"The Wave\\" with a similar logo to KTWV and also broadcast on 94.7 FM. (CIWV-FM flipped to a country format in 2011; \\"The Wave\\" was moved first to a webstream before launching on an HD Radio subchannel in 2015.) Ratings for KTWV's initial presentation were weaker than hoped, with the \\"Playlets\\" being limited to only the top of the hour by June. Eventually, Frank Cody left to be a radio consultant for budding NAC stations (and later coined the phrase \\"smooth jazz\\"), and John Sebastian (former programmer of KHJ, who had launched a similar sounding station in Washington, D.C.) was hired as the new program director. He promptly introduced a traditional presentation similar to other NAC stations, dropping the playlets entirely, expanding the playlist, and hiring live jocks who started on September 19, 1988. The core group of these included Don Burns, Talaya Trigueros, Keri Tombazian, Amy Hiatt and China Smith. The syndicated Wave then wound down (although it did copy KTWV in adding live jocks before this); only Cleveland remained with the format under local operation until 2019 (excluding from 2009 to 2011 when it was aired on an HD Radio subchannel of WNWV). In the early 1990s, like most NAC stations launched at the same time as KTWV, the station dropped new age and jazz fusion in favor of a blend of contemporary jazz, soft R&B;, and adult contemporary (AC) crossover hits; this new mix would define the smooth jazz label going forward. Eventually, as the 21st century approached, the same reasons that led KMET down ratings-wise (tight playlists formatted through consultants) would plague 94.7 The Wave and other smooth jazz stations, although this would not be made clear until the adoption of the PPM ratings system in 2008. At that time, many of the stations that launched in KTWV's shadow flipped out of the format. In 2001, Pat Prescott began hosting morning drive for KTWV alongside saxophonist Dave Koz; he was with the station for six years. Replacing Koz on January 15, 2007 was R&B; musician Brian McKnight who co-hosted mornings until January 22, 2010; The Brian McKnight Show was syndicated nationwide to urban adult contemporary and smooth jazz stations. Evolution to urban adult contemporary (2010‚Äìpresent) In February 2010, Jhani Kaye took over KTWV from the departing Paul Goldstein. Kaye, who previously programmed crosstown heritage AC station KOST, transitioned KTWV toward a \\"smooth adult contemporary\\" direction in an attempt to attract a younger demographic by increasing the amount of crossover vocals and dramatically reducing the number of instrumentals played (with most of the remaining being pop covers and basic originals). In addition, references to \\"smooth jazz\\" were eliminated as the station reformatted to compete directly with KOST. With this, Don Burns (who voice-tracked from his home in Palm Springs) along with fellow original Wave air personality Keri Tombazian were both let go. From May 2010 to June 2012, Kim Amidon, a former morning DJ at KOST, co-hosted mornings with Prescott. In November 2013, KTWV introduced a revamped logo, still utilizing the font from the 1987 logo while dumping the original \\"Wave\\" graphic, and changing its slogan from \\"Southern California's Place to Unwind and Relax\\" to just \\"Smooth R&B;\\". June 2014 saw the return of longtime assistant PD Ralph Stewart, when he became program director and reintroduced some mainstream AC/pop crossovers into the playlist, and dropped the \\"Smooth R&B;\\" slogan. In February 2015, after the flip of KHHT from rhythmic oldies to urban contemporary as KRRL \\"Real 92.3\\", KTWV adjusted its format to urban adult contemporary. The station added more classic soul and current R&B; to fill the void of KHHT's departure and adopted the new \\"Soul of Southern California\\" slogan, while also dropping most of the mainstream AC/pop crossovers, further positioning KTWV against KJLH. It also adopted a new logo that notably removed all remaining elements of the original Wave logo after three decades. These moves have seen KTWV's ratings improve further, putting the station among the Los Angeles market's top stations, including sister KRTH. On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on November 17. On April 18, 2019, it was announced that original \\"Wave\\" jock Talaya Trigueros was leaving KTWV after 31 years in midday drive due to budget cuts. Trigueros, who originally began under just her first name, had been the last remaining jock from the original group hired by John Sebastian in 1988. HD Programming KTWV broadcasts in HD Radio on three digital subchannels: *KTWV-HD1 is a digital simulcast of the analog signal. *KTWV-HD2 airs a smooth jazz format branded \\"Wave Classics\\", which was launched September 15, 2010. The previous format, all-news as a simulcast of sister station KNX, was moved to KTWV-HD3, ending the Los Angeles simulcast of another sister station, country music-formatted KFRG in Riverside, California.HD Radio Guide for Los Angeles *KTWV-HD3 broadcasts Persian- language programming as \\"Radio Hamrah\\". The format was previously launched on KTWV-HD2 on November 15, 2017, after former provider KSWD was sold to Educational Media Foundation. Superpower status KTWV is a \\"Superpower\\" grandfathered Class B FM station. Under normal FCC regulations, KTWV would be allowed to broadcast with a maximum ERP of 930 watts at the same antenna height of 863 meters. The station currently broadcasts at 58 kW, more than 20 times as much as the power they would be allowed today. This station, along with several other L.A.-area FM stations, went on the air before power regulations took effect in 1962. That is what allows them to broadcast at such high levels.

The name is also used for their main products, the Nagravision encryption systems. Analog system An analog Nagravision system (Syster) for scrambling analog satellite television programs was used in the 1990s. In this line-shuffling system, bottom 32 lines of the PAL TV signal are shifted in time by one video field, and read out in permuted order under the control of a pseudorandom number generator. A smartcard security microcontroller (in a key-shaped package) decrypts data that is transmitted during the blanking intervals of the TV signal mixed with teletext and extracts the random seed value which contains present line combination needed for reverting the picture back. The system also permitted the audio signal to be modulated at 12.8 kHz using a frequency mixer. Digital systems 4 currently used versions of Nagravision are in common use for digital satellite television, known as Nagravision, Nagravision Cardmagedon, Nagravision Aladin and Nagravision Merlin. Nagravision Cardmagedon and Aladin are often confused with each other and used under the term \\"Nagravision 2\\" which technically does not exist. Nagravision Cardmagedon is, however, a complicated combination of Nagravision Aladin and Mediaguard SECA 2 encryption. Nagravision Merlin is also known as Nagravision 3. The decryption unit is either integrated into a receiver, available as a conditional-access module (CAM), or as one of many encryption schemes supported on a CAM emulator.

Today, they are the members of the Presidential Guard (), a ceremonial unit that guards the Greek Tomb of the Unknown Soldier () and the Presidential Mansion in Athens. An Evzone () is also known, colloquially, as a Tsoli√°s (; pl. , Œ§œÉŒøŒªŒπŒ¨Œ¥ŒµœÇ, Tsoli√°des). Evzones are known for their distinctive uniform, which evolved from the clothes worn by the klephts who fought the Ottoman occupation of Greece. The most visible item of this uniform is the fustanella, a kilt-like garment. Their distinctive dress turned them into a popular image for the Greek soldier, especially among foreigners. Etymology The word evz≈çnos () is first attested in Homer's Iliad and derives from and , meaning \\"well-girt\\". The word was used by ancient writers for centuries to describe light infantry (better known as psiloi or gymnitai). History =Light infantry in the early regular army= Men of the light infantry battalions established by Ioannis Kapodistrias The term \\"Evzones\\" was revived in modern practice as a Greek version of the European-style light infantry (such as the German J√§ger, French Chasseurs, or British Riflemen) in 1824 during the Greek War of Independence, when the first attempts to form a regular, European-style army were undertaken by the Greek rebels. The first regular infantry battalion comprised six companies, one of which was designated as an \\"Evzone Company\\" (ŒõœåœáŒøœÇ Œï·ΩêŒ∂œéŒΩœâŒΩ). The uniform now associated with the Evzones was not used at the time; but a uniform derived from the traditional costume of the fustanella, had already been adopted by the British-sponsored Greek Light Infantry Regiments raised during the Napoleonic Wars. A similar uniform was adopted when Governor Ioannis Kapodistrias reformed the nascent Hellenic Army in 1828 and formed the so-called \\"Light Battalions\\" (ŒïŒªŒ±œÜœÅŒ¨ Œ§Œ¨Œ≥ŒºŒ±œÑŒ±)‚Äîfive from Western Continental Greece and eight from Eastern Continental Greece‚Äîin an attempt to instil discipline and gradually regularize the irregular groups (\\"klephts\\") that had provided the bulk of the Greek forces during the War of Independence. The men of these battalions wore the traditional costume, although they were not designated as Evzones. Following the assassination of Kapodistrias in 1831 and the ensuing political infighting, the Light Battalions effectively disbanded, and their men became armed brigands under the command of the chieftains of the old irregular groups. =Reign of King Otto: light infantry and Mountain Guard= Rumeliote light infantry in 1838 In 1833, after the arrival of King Otto () to Greece, the Hellenic Army was organized along new lines by the Bavarian officials who had come with Otto. In February 1833, the infantry was organized into eight regular infantry battalions, of 728 men and six companies each: one of grenadiers, four line infantry companies, and one light infantry company. The latter received the name \\"Evzones\\" (\\"Voltigeurs\\" in the Bavarian terminology), but their uniform was of European style, identical to the rest of the infantry, apart from the use of green as their distinctive colour in the piping, epaulettes and decoration of their uniforms. Men of the Mountain Guard battalions with a captive In March 1833, ten independent battalions of light infantry (termed ·ºàŒ∫œÅŒøŒ≤ŒøŒªŒπœÉœÑŒ±ŒØ, \\"Skirmishers\\", or ŒöœÖŒΩŒ∑Œ≥ŒøŒØ, \\"Hunters\\" in Greek) of 204 men and four companies were established. However, because the \\"tight\\" European uniforms prescribed for these units were unpopular with many veterans of the War of Independence, recruitment remained very low. In the end, the attempt was given up and in 1836, four Light Infantry Battalions were formed instead, who were allowed to wear a uniform based on the traditional Greek dress. These battalions had six companies each, but with 162 men per company instead of the 120 men in the regular infantry battalions. In January 1838, the four Light Infantry Battalions were merged into two regular infantry battalions (while one of the original four line battalions was disbanded), and replaced by eight \\"Mountain Guard\\" battalions (Œ§Œ¨Œ≥ŒºŒ±œÑŒ± ·ΩâœÅŒøœÜœÖŒªŒ±Œ∫ŒÆœÇ). Assigned the role of border guards, the Mountain Guard battalions had four companies with 299 men and 16 officers. In February 1838, they were subordinated to three Mountain Guard Headquarters, commanded by a colonel or lieutenant colonel. In another reorganization in 1843, the regular infantry battalions were reduced to two Line Infantry Battalions of eight companies (including one Evzone company) of 140 men each, and two Skirmisher Battalions of four companies each. At the same time, an additional three light companies were established, which in 1844 were amalgamated into the \\"Supplementary Mountain Guard Corps\\" (Œ†Œ±œÅŒ±œÄŒªŒ∑œÅœâŒºŒ±œÑŒπŒ∫œå Œ£œéŒºŒ± ·ΩâœÅŒøœÜœÖŒªŒ±Œ∫ŒÆœÇ). The entire Mountain Guard was then placed directly under the command of the Ministry of Military Affairs, abolishing the Mountain Guard Headquarters. In October 1852, the Mountain Guard was reorganized into four two-battalion regiments. In August 1854, the Mountain Guard was disbanded and its units converted into three Skirmisher Battalions, while the regular infantry battalions were increased to six. In 1860, the infantry was homogenized into ten infantry battalions of six 120-man companies (one Evzone company), plus ten reserve battalions. =Establishment of the Evzone Battalions = On 12 December 1868, King George I () signed a Royal Decree authorizing the creation of four independent (Œ±·ΩêŒ∏œçœÄŒ±œÅŒ∫œÑŒ±) Evzone Battalions (Œ§Œ¨Œ≥ŒºŒ±œÑŒ± Œï·ΩêŒ∂œéŒΩœâŒΩ), \\"forming part of the Army's regular strength and intended especially for service on the frontier, and in providing assistance to the Gendarmerie.Royal Decree of 12 December 1868, published in Œ¶ŒïŒö 63/1868, pp. 440‚Äì442 Each battalion was to be commanded by a lieutenant colonel or a major, with a staff of 4 officers and 6 NCOs, and comprising four companies of 122 officers and men each. Their personnel were to be exclusively career and volunteer soldiers, rather than draftees. Prospective recruits had to be of good health and character, over 17 and under 40 years of age, and preferably unmarried. On the same day, due to the precarious security situation, the King also provisionally authorized the creation of eight further Evzone Battalions, numbered 5‚Äì12, as well as the increase of each Evzone company's strength to 170.Royal Decree of 12 December 1868, published in Œ¶ŒïŒö 62/1868, p. 430 In addition, on the same day a special detachment, initially named Agema (ŒÜŒ≥Œ∑ŒºŒ±), the precursor of the modern Presidential Guard, composed of two Evzone infantry companies and a cavalry company, was formed.Royal Decree of 12 December 1868, published in Œ¶ŒïŒö 63/1868, pp. 438‚Äì440 =Eastern Crisis of 1877‚Äì1878= Greek Evzones in 1878 During the Great Eastern Crisis, in 1877 the Hellenic Army was reorganized, with two square infantry divisions being established. The 1st Evzone Battalion at Kravasaras was subordinated to the Patras Brigade, and the 2nd Evzone Battalion at Karpenisi to the Corfu Brigade, with the two brigades comprising the Peloponnese Division. The 3rd Evzone Battalion at Ypati was subordinated to the Athens Brigade, and the 2nd Evzone Battalion at Gardiki to the Missolonghi Brigade, with the two brigades comprising Continental Greece Division. The 1878 reorganization greatly increased the size of the army, but the Evzone battalions remained the same, with a peacetime strength of 1,968 men (out of 10,400) and an intended wartime strength of 4,160 men (out of 21,000 men). In 1880, another reorganization increased the Evzone units to 11 independent battalions of four companies each, and one training battalion. However, the 1881 army regulations again revised the number to nine Evzone battalions. In 1885, during a reorganization of the infantry, the Evzone battalions of the active army were reduced to eight, but two reserve battalions were established. =Greco-Ottoman crisis of 1885‚Äì1886= The Hellenic Army was mobilized during the diplomatic crisis with the Ottoman Empire that followed the de facto annexation of Eastern Rumelia to the Principality of Bulgaria in 1885. In May 1886, clashes broke out between Greek and Ottoman troops in Thessaly, and at Koutra, 300 men of the 5th Evzone Battalion surrendered to the Turks. The two captains responsible for the Koutra incident were court-martialled and condemned to death in August 1887, although the death sentence was immediately commuted by the King. The eight Evzone battalions were retained by to the 1887 regulations issued by the French military mission, but two of them were skeleton formations in peacetime, with only their professional personnel assigned to them. =Greco- Turkish War of 1897 and aftermath= Evzones in a blockhouse during the Greco- Turkish War of 1897 In total, ten Evzone battalions (1st‚Äì9th, 11th) fought in the disastrous 1897 war with Ottoman Turkey. The 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 11th Battalions, comprising 6,996 men, fought in the Army of Thessaly, while the 1st, 3rd and 11th Battalions with 4,494 men were subordinated to the Army of Epirus. In the aftermath of the war, various reorganization attempts were undertaken, and the number of Evzone battalions varied considerably. In June 1900 two Evzone regiments were established by combining some of the hitherto independent battalions: the 1st Evzone Regiment (1Œø Œ£œçŒΩœÑŒ±Œ≥ŒºŒ± ŒïœÖŒ∂œéŒΩœâŒΩ) comprised the 6th, 8th, and 9th Evzone Battalions, and the 2nd Evzone Regiment (2Œø Œ£œçŒΩœÑŒ±Œ≥ŒºŒ± ŒïœÖŒ∂œéŒΩœâŒΩ) the 1st and 4th Evzone Battalions. The new army regulations composed in 1903‚Äì04 combined the 1st and 2nd Evzone Regiments in the 1st Brigade under the 1st Infantry Division, with an additional Evzone Battalion (1st‚Äì3rd) attached to each of the three infantry divisions. This structure was not of long duration, however, as in 1904 a new, more homogeneous divisional structure was adopted, with four regular infantry regiments and two Evzone battalions for each of the three infantry divisions. 1st Division now comprised the 4th and 6th Evzone Battalions, 2nd Infantry Division the 1st and 2nd Evzone Battalions, and 3rd Infantry Division the 3rd and 7th Evzone Battalions. The 1910 army regulations envisaged again nine Evzone Battalions (to 18 infantry regiments), but the 1912 regulations reduced them again to six, each of four companies and two machine gun squads. =Balkan Wars, World War I, Asia Minor and World War II= Evzones in campaign uniform during the Balkan Wars In the mobilization prior to the outbreak of the Balkan Wars in 1912, four more Evzone battalions were raised. They operated independently on the vanguard or the flanks of the army. They distinguished themselves for their fighting spirit suffering high casualties, especially among officers. landing at Smyrna, May 1919 Royal Guard with Damaskinos of Athens, 1945 Subsequently the Evzone units were increased to five regiments, which fought with distinction as elite shock troops in the First World War, the Asia Minor Campaign and the Greco-Italian War. During the German invasion in 1941, a memorable event is said to have occurred: on April 27, as the German Army was entering Athens, the Germans ascended to the Acropolis of Athens and ordered the young Evzone who was guarding the flag post, Konstantinos Koukidis (q.v.), to haul the Greek flag down and replace it with the swastika flag. The young soldier did so, but refused to hand over the Greek flag to the Germans, and instead wrapped himself in it and fell off the Acropolis to his death. After the occupation of the country, in 1943, the collaborationist government raised a number of \\"Security Battalions\\" (Œ§Œ¨Œ≥ŒºŒ±œÑŒ± ŒëœÉœÜŒ±ŒªŒµŒØŒ±œÇ), which were dressed in the Evzone uniform and participated in operations against the EAM-ELAS partisans. They were derisively known as Germanotsoliades (\\"German Evzones\\") or Tagmatasfalites (\\"Security Battalionists\\"), and were disbanded after liberation in 1944. =Post-war history= After the war, the reconstituted Hellenic Army did not re-establish the Evzone regiments, their elite status and role being assumed by the newly established Mountain Raiding Companies. The traditions and distinctions of the Evzones are, however, maintained by a special ceremonial unit, which has served under several names: Palace Guard (), Flag Guard (), Tomb of the Unknown Soldier Guard (), Royal Guard () and after 1974, with the abolition of the monarchy, the Presidential Guard (). Several regular Army Infantry units have been given the numbers and names of the post-1913 Evzone Regiments, however, these names are only honorific.  Former units  The historical units were numbered and known as Œ§Œ¨Œ≥ŒºŒ± ŒïœÖŒ∂œéŒΩœâŒΩ (\\"Evzone Battalion\\") or Œ£œçŒΩœÑŒ±Œ≥ŒºŒ± ŒïœÖŒ∂œéŒΩœâŒΩ (\\"Evzone Regiment\\"). The first Evzone Regiment was formed in 1912, shortly before the outbreak of the Balkan Wars. The \\"traditional\\" and well-known Evzone regiments, which fought in World War I, the Asia Minor Campaign, and World War II, were formed after the Balkan Wars by the Royal Decree of 23 December 1913. Since the regiments were distinctive, elite units, they had dual numbers‚Äîthe first, numbering them in the Evzones order of seniority, the second, in the overall infantry hierarchy. Thus the 5/42 Evzone Regiment was the 5th Evzone regiment, but also the 42nd infantry regiment. *1/38 Evzone Regiment, the former 1st Evzone Regiment, based in Karditsa and recruited in Thessaly *2/39 Evzone Regiment, based in Missolonghi and recruited in Aetolia-Acarnania *3/40 Evzone Regiment, based in Arta and recruited in Epirus *4/41 Evzone Regiment, based in Veroia and recruited in western Macedonia *5/42 Evzone Regiment, based in Lamia and recruited in Central Greece  Uniform  In 1833, the uniform of the Evzones (as in all infantry companies of the line battalions) was in the unpopular Bavarian style of blue trousers, tailcoats and shako. As light infantry the Evzones were distinguished only by green braid and plumes. In 1837, a new uniform was created; based on the traditional fustanella style worn by the klephts, armatoli, and many of the best-known fighters of the Greek War of Independence. At first, it was only issued to the native light infantry battalions, but its popularity led to its adoption as the official uniform of the Evzones in 1868. In the 1868 regulations, officers and warrant officers continued wearing the regular Army uniform, but the other ranks of the Evzone battalions were issued a special uniform with a white wool jacket (œÜŒ≠œÅŒºŒµŒªŒ∑) with dark blue cord embroidery (Œ≥Œ±œäœÑŒ¨ŒΩŒπŒ±), with the battalion number embroidered in crimson at the end of each sleeve. The jacket was also decorated with two rows of twelve yellow metal buttons on the chest, and eight on the sleeves. A fez (œÜŒ≠œÉŒπŒøŒΩ) with a silk tassel, bearing the national cockade and the royal crown was worn; plus a knee-length fustanella of white cloth, closed by a belt of cotton in blue and white stripes. On the legs were worn tsarouchia, with white wool leggings and garters; the former decorated in dark blue embroidery. For bad weather, an \\"iron-coloured\\" knee-length cape was issued. During the remainder of the 19th century, the dress of the separate line battalions of Evzones appears to have differed slightly in detail between units.Rene North, page 123 \\"Military Uniforms 1686-1918\\", SBN 600 00118 0 After a few minor changes over the years, it became the familiar uniform seen worn today by the Presidential Guard. In 1910 a new field service uniform was adopted, substituting a khaki farion cap and khaki doulama jacket for the respectively red and dark blue garments previously worn. The long white woollen hose and turned-up tsarouchia shoes were still retained, although sometimes replaced on campaign by the standard khaki trousers and leather boots of the line infantry. The khaki and off-white field uniform of 1910 was still being worn during the Greek-Italian War of 1940-41, although without the red collar piping and shoulder straps of the earlier uniform. The traditional black fez tassel, and large pompoms on the footwear, were usually removed before battle.

Ted Rall describes the comic as \\"explor[ing] the limits of pessimism and fatal consequence in a universe that would be difficult to imagine on the printed page.\\"Rall, Ted (2006). Attitude 3: The New Subversive Online Cartoonists, New York: Nantier, Beall, Minoustchine. . The comic was officially \\"on hiatus\\" A Lesson Is Learned But The Damage Is Irreversible :: View topic - Letter to Our Forum Friends from September 2006 to December 10, 2012, with the comic \\"I Name Thee Annihilator\\" ending the hiatus but ultimately being the penultimate entry in the series.http://www.alessonislearned.com/index.php?comic=42 Dale and David are the primary characters, although they do not appear in every episode, and there is a small cast of real-life supporting characters, including schoolfriend/mad scientist Paul, Dale's sister Sally, and David's mother, Debby Hellman (who dated the Devil in one strip). Dale and David, who met at The Park School of Baltimore in ninth grade, published the first strip on July 15, 2004, and since then have produced more than 40 strips. New episodes appeared with varying frequency, sometimes weekly, monthly, or occasionally after a two-month hiatus.  Content  Characters, many introduced for just one strip, are often surreal and imaginative, as with a wise yeti or breakdancing giants. Fantastical characters, often exhibiting magical or anthropomorphic qualities, include intelligent robots, cute woodland animals, and dogs. The plots are erratic. Most episodes seemingly begin in surreal realms and hardly leave; others take root in reality. Real-world Dale beats up all the monks in a Buddhist monastery, whereupon a group of Shaolin monks seek revenge; these events span two episodes. The first 35 episodes maintain almost no continuity between strips. The few recurring characters often change appearance (especially facial hair) from strip to strip. March 4, 2006 saw a change in direction for the comic; the first 35 strips, dating back to 2004, were retrospectively grouped as \\"Series One,\\" and all episodes since have been released as part of \\"Series Two\\". While the comics of the first series generally featured the non-continuous adventures of the authors, the second series consists of loosely connected storylines with each new strip generally having some connection to previous episodes ‚Äì either by following characters through more than one strip, introducing characters with a connection to others already featured or by making tangential references (\\"The Earthbound Clouds\\" pictures both the mice of the previous strip, and Kitestring's girlfriend in the next strip, without either impacting on the storyline). Prior to the hiatus, David and Dale were not featured in a Series Two comic. This changed with \\"I Name Thee Annihilator\\" in which both characters were featured in a comic similar to the style of those in Series One. It remains to be seen whether or not the theme of interconnected storylines will continue in future comics in Series Two. The strips are linked by recurrent themes and styles of visual play, although the specific art style varies considerably from strip to strip, and sometimes even from panel to panel. The styles range from the intricately detailed to cartoonishly simple, and apply subtle, medium-specific artistic devices, as in episodes 18 and 31. The strips usually have more than ten panels, although sometimes there is only one or no panels at all. The paneled structure frequently breaks down as panels overlap or bleed color, lines and characters into one another. Hellman draws the comic entirely on a computer, using Photoshop with a WACOM tablet.  Response  A Lesson Is Learned But The Damage Is Irreversible was named one of the best webcomics of 2004 and 2005 by The Webcomics Examiner, won the 2005 Web Cartoonist's Choice Award for Outstanding Layout, following the latter achievement up the following year by winning Outstanding Layout again, along with awards for Outstanding Use of Color and the overall award for Outstanding Artist. In June 2006, Hellman And Beran were interviewed in the book Attitude 3: The New Subversive Online Cartoonists, edited by Ted Rall.

In the latter campaign, he was slain by Byzantine forces. Life Ikrima's father was Amr ibn Hisham ibn al-Mughira, a leader of the polytheistic Quraysh tribe's Banu Makhzum clan who was called \\"Abu Jahl\\" (father of ignorance) by the Muslims for his stringent opposition to the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Ikrima's father was slain fighting the Muslims at the Battle of Badr in 624. At the Battle of Uhud, where the Quraysh defeated the Muslims, Ikrima commanded the tribe's left wing; his cousin Khalid ibn al-Walid commanded the right wing. The Makhzum's losses at Badr had diminished their influence and gave way to the Banu Abd Shams under Abu Sufyan to take the helm against Muhammad. However, the influence of Ikrima, by then the preeminent leader of the Makhzum, in Mecca had increased toward the end of the 620s. He opposed the negotiations with Muhammad at Hudaybiyya and broke the agreement when he and some Quraysh attacked the Banu Khuza'a. When Muhammad conquered Mecca in 630, Ikrima escaped as a fugitive for the Yemen where the Makhzum had commercial connections. Muhammad later pardoned Ikrima, apparently after being petitioned by Ikrima's wife and paternal first cousin Umm Hakim bint al-Harith, who had converted to Islam. According to the historian al-Waqidi, Muhammad appointed Ikrima as a tax collector of the Hawazin tribal confederation in 632. Ikrima was in the Tihama region between Yemen and Mecca when Muhammad died. According to Blankinship, after he embraced Islam, Ikrima devoted to his new religion's cause \\"much of the energy that had characterized his earlier opposition\\" to Islam. After Muhammad's death, the Islamic prophet's close associate Abu Bakr became caliph (leader of the Muslim community) and appointed Ikrima to lead a campaign against rebel Arab tribes in the Ridda wars (632‚Äì633), which saw him command expeditions around the entire Arabian Peninsula, with particular focus in Yemen. By 634, Abu Bakr reassigned Ikrima and his troops, who hailed from the Tihama, northern Yemen, Bahrayn and Oman, to reinforce Khalid's army in the Muslim conquest of Syria. Ikrima was most likely killed fighting the Byzantines in the Battle of Ajnadayn in Palestine in 634, though it is also held that he may have been slain in the Battle of Yarmouk in 636. Family According to the historian al-Ya'qubi (d. 898), Ikrima was married to Qutayla bint Qays ibn Ma'dikarib, the sister of the chieftain of the Kindite Banu Mu'awiya clan, al- Ash'ath ibn Qays. She was sent from Yemen to marry Muhammad but arrived after the Islamic prophet died and afterward was wed to Ikrima. The Islamic tradition mostly agrees that Ikrima died childless, though the 8th-century historian Sayf ibn Umar mentions a son named Amr and Ibn Hazm (d. 1064), possibly deriving his information from Sayf, calls this same son Umar. The modern historian Michael Lecker holds that Ikrima's marriage to Qutayla proved problematic for later Muslim scholars as the remarriage of Muhammad's wives was forbidden. Lecker holds the Islamic tradition censored out the original report used by the traditional Muslim authors that Qutayla bore Ikrima \\"a feeble-minded son\\", which he considers to be the \\"more trustworthy\\" version.

Vlahos consistently devised solutions that made the modern blockbuster possible - he is remembered in particular for creating the Ultimatte process, which refined the colour process known as \\"bluescreening\\" or alternatively \\"greenscreening\\" to solve the transparency, edge-sharpening and \\"blue spill\\" problems of simple chroma keying, and combining this with motion control camera technology to create the modern special effects shot. This technology allows film editors in post-production to digitally remove an image of an actor working in front of a usually blue or green colored background and insert him into any computer-generated or other preexisting digital background. In recognition of his contributions, he was awarded multiple Oscars, as well as an Emmy Award. Early life Vlahos was born in Raton, New Mexico, the son of Greek immigrants. He showed an early aptitude for electronics and ham radio, and in 1941, he gained his Engineering degree from the University of California at Berkeley. He worked as a designer for Douglas Aircraft in World War II, and later as a radar engineer at Bell Laboratories. After the war, he moved to Hollywood and worked for MGM. Hollywood career The technology used today as a way of combining actors with background footage still derives from the techniques he developed. Vlahos was not the first to use the blue-screen technology--it was invented by Larry Butler for the 1940 filming of The Thief of Bagdad--but he made the process much more realistic and scientific. He created a system called the sodium vapor matte first for the parent trap and the absend-minded professor and later the Disney musical Mary Poppins (1964) which would win him an academy award. For the film Ben Hur he refined the color-difference bluescreen process that made memorable visual effects possible in films and developed a way to minimize the unfortunate side effects of earlier methods. Vlahos' breakthrough was to create a complicated laboratory process which involved separating the blue, green and red parts of each frame before combining them back together in a certain order. He moved the process along and introduced the use of motion control cameras during bluescreen work. He called his cutting-edge invention the colour-difference travelling matte scheme. Francis Ford Coppola and Vlahos (right) Along with his son, Paul Vlahos, he founded the Ultimatte Corporation in Chatsworth, California, in 1976. His company's first Ultimatte units were analog \\"black boxes\\" which later evolved into advanced, real-time digital hardware and computer software products. When sci-fi and fantasy films became dominant at the box office, Vlahos‚Äô techniques became dominant in filmmaking, essential to movies such as the Star Wars trilogy. Refinements of his pioneering technique were used to make many of the blockbuster films of the 1990s, notably Titanic (1997), in which dangerous, expensive or difficult to film scenes were finally possible. In all, Petro Vlahos held more than 35 patents for film-related gadgetry. Accolades A member of the Academy‚Äôs original Motion Picture Research Council, he was honored by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences many times, starting with a Scientific and Technical Award in 1960 for a camera flicker indicating device. He won his first Oscar in 1964 for the \\"conception and perfection of techniques for color traveling matte composite cinematography.\\" In 1978, Petro won an Emmy Award for Ultimatte Compositing Technology. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gave him a Medal of Commendation in 1992. In 1993 he was the recipient of the Gordon E. Sawyer Award, his second Oscar. In 1995, he shared a third Oscar (Academy Scientific and Technical Award) with his son, Paul, for the blue-screen advances made by Ultimatte Corporation.

The structure was commissioned in 1389 by Timur, who ruled the area as part of the expansive Timurid Empire, to replace a smaller 12th-century mausoleum of the famous Turkic poet and Sufi mystic, Khoja Ahmed Yasawi (1093-1166). However, construction was halted with the death of Timur in 1405. Despite its incomplete state, the mausoleum has survived as one of the best-preserved of all Timurid constructions. Its creation marked the beginning of the Timurid architectural style. The experimental spatial arrangements, innovative architectural solutions for vault and dome constructions, and ornamentations using glazed tiles made the structure the prototype for this distinctive art, which spread across the empire and beyond. The religious structure continues to draw pilgrims from across Central Asia and has come to epitomize the Kazakh national identity. It has been protected as a national monument, while UNESCO recognized it as the country's first site of patrimony, declaring it a World Heritage Site in 2003. Location of the mausoleum within the town's defensive walls. Location The Mausoleum of Khawaja Ahmed Yasawi is situated in the north-eastern part of the modern-day town of Turkestan (formerly known as Hazrat-e Turkestan), an ancient centre of caravan trade known earlier as Khazret and later as Yasi, in the southern part of Kazakhstan. The structure is within the vicinity of a historic citadel, which is now an archaeological site. Remains of medieval structures such as other mausoleums, mosques and bath houses characterize the archaeological area. To the north of the Mausoleum of Khawaja Ahmed Yasawi, a reconstructed section of the citadel wall from the 1970s separates the historical area from the developments of the modern town. History Rear view of mausoleum where banna'i technique - patterns of glazed brickwork - can be best observed. =Khawaja Ahmed Yasawi= Khoja Ahmed Yasawi (Khawaja or Khwaja (Persian: ÿÆŸàÿßÿ¨Ÿá pronounced kh√¢je) corresponds to \\"master\\", whence Arabic: ÿÆŸàÿßÿ¨ÿ© khawƒÅjah), also spelled as Khawajah Akhmet Yassawi, was the 12th-century head of a regional school of Sufism, a mystic movement in Islam which began in the 9th century. He was born in Ispidjab (modern Sayram) in 1093, and spent most of his life in Yasi, dying there in 1166. He is widely revered in Central Asia and the Turkic-speaking world for popularizing Sufism, which sustained the diffusion of Islam in the area despite the contemporary onslaught of the Mongol invasion. The theological school he created turned Yasi into the most important medieval enlightening center of the area. He was also an outstanding poet, philosopher and statesman. Yasawi was interred in a small mausoleum, which became a pilgrimage site for Muslims. =New mausoleum= A view of the mausoleum, ca. 1879. The town of Yasi was largely spared during the Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia in the 13th century. Overtime, the descendants of the Mongols settled in the area and converted to Islam. The town then came under the control of the Timurid Dynasty in the 1360s. Timur (Tamerlane), the founder of the dynasty, expanded the empire's realm to include Mesopotamia, Iran, and all of Transoxiana, with its capital located in Samarkand. To gain the support of local citizens, Timur adopted the policy of constructing monumental public and cult buildings. In Yasi, he put his attention to the construction of a larger mausoleum to house Yasawi's remains, with the intention of glorifying Islam, promoting its further dissemination, and improving the governance of the immediate areas. The new mausoleum was begun in 1389. Timur imported builders from cities which he laid waste during his campaigns, including mosaic-workers from Shiraz and stonemasons and stucco-workers from Isfahan. The master builders were led by Khwaja Hosein Shirazi from Iran. It was reported that Timur himself participated in the design of the structure, where he introduced experimental spatial arrangements, types of vaults and domes. These innovations were later implemented in the religious edifices of other cities. However, the mausoleum was left unfinished, when Timur died in 1405. The dome of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi's mausoleum is the largest in Central Asia. =Decline and preservation= When the Timurid Empire disintegrated, control of the immediate territory passed on to the Kazakh Khanate, which made Yasi, then renamed Turkestan, its capital in the 16th century. The khans (Turkic for \\"ruler\\") sought to strengthen the political and religious importance of Turkestan to unify the nomadic tribes within the young state. Hence, as the khanate's political center, ceremonies for the elevation of the khans to the throne and missions from neighboring states were received in Turkestan. The Kazakh nobility also held their most important meetings to decide state- related matters in the capital. Plan of Mausoleum. The town, situated on the border of the nomadic and settled cultures, flourished as the khanate's largest trade and craft center. Fortifications were erected to safeguard this commercial role, including the 19th-century construction of defensive walls around the unfinished mausoleum, which became an important landmark and pilgrimage center of the town. In the succeeding centuries, Turkestan and its historic monuments became connected with the idea of the Kazakh state system. Political struggles and the shift in overland trade in favor of maritime routes soon led to the town's decline, before it finally passed on to the Russian Empire in 1864. General View of Sultan Akhmed Yassavi's Mausoleum from the Southern Side (historic photo, created on around 1865-1872) The town was eventually deserted; a new town center was developed west of the area, built around a new railway station. The territory came under Soviet rule by the 20th century. The new administration carried out preservation and restoration work on site, although they considered it more as an architectural rather than a spiritual structure. Hence, the mausoleum was closed to the devotees who came to pay homage to Yasawi. Nevertheless, the local khoja based at the mausoleum allowed pilgrims to secretly enter the structure at night. Beginning in 1922, several commissions took part in the technical investigation of the building. Regular maintenance has been in place beginning in 1938, while a series of restoration campaigns were started in 1945, with the last one being held from 1993 to 2000. Among the latest conservation steps implemented were the replacement of the structure's clay foundation with reinforced concrete, the consolidation of walls, the waterproofing of the roofs, and the layering of new tiles, based on historic designs and patterns, on the domes. The continuous conservation works have been in place when Kazakhstan gained its independence. The building is protected as a national monument and is included on the List of National Properties of Kazakhstan. The site is under the administration of the Azret-Sultan State Historical and Cultural Reserve Museum, in charge with the safeguarding, research, conservation, monitoring and maintenance of the mausoleum. Architecture The unfinished state of the Mausoleum of Khawaja Ahmed Yasawi, especially at the entrance portal and sections of the interior, allow for the better architectural scrutiny of how the monument was designed and constructed. The structure is rectangular in plan, measuring 45.8 √ó 62.7 m (150.3 √ó 205.7 ft), and is 38.7 m (127.0 ft) high. It is oriented from the south-east to the north-west. The primary material used for the building is ganch--fired brick mixed with mortar, gypsum and clay--which was made in a plant located in Sauran. Layers of clay reaching a depth of 1.5 m (4.9 ft), to prevent the water penetration, were used for the original foundation. These were replaced with reinforced concrete in modern restoration works. The main entrance to the mausoleum is from the south-east, through which visitors are ushered into the 18.2 √ó 18.2-m (59.7 √ó 59.7-ft) Main Hall, known as Kazandyk (the \\"copper room\\"). The section is covered by the largest existing brick dome in Central Asia, also measuring 18.2 m (59.7 ft) in diameter. At the center of the Kazandyk is a bronze cauldron, used for religious purposes. The tomb of Yasawi is situated on the central axis at the end of the building in the northwest, with the sarcophagus located exactly at the center of the section, which has a double dome ribbed roof --the inner dome being 17.0 m (55.8 ft) high and the outer dome being 28.0 m (91.9 ft) high. The dome exterior is covered with hexagonal green glazed tiles with gold patterns. The interior is adorned with alabaster stalactites, known as muqarnas. Additional rooms in the structure, totaling more than 35, include meeting rooms, a refectory, a library, and a mosque, which had light blue geometric and floral ornaments on its walls. The mausoleum's exterior walls are covered in glazed tiles constituting geometric patterns with Kufic and Suls epigraphic ornaments derived from the Qur'an. Initial plans also called for the addition of two minarets, but this was not realized when construction was halted in 1405. Legacy =Birth of Timurid Architecture= The construction of the mausoleum provided important advances in building technology, displaying unsurpassed records of all kinds in terms of its vaulted constructions and artistic innovations. The achievements derived from the mausoleum's erection, together with the Timurids‚Äô patronage of music, calligraphy, Persian miniature painting, literature, and various scientific pursuits, gave birth to a distinct Islamic artistic style, to be known as Timurid. The spacious structure employed a radially symmetrical plan for spatial arrangement. The visual balance created by the precise construction became a characteristic aesthetic feature of Timurid buildings--one which would famously be adopted by the Mughal Architecture of India, especially in the gardens and structures of Humayun's Tomb and Taj Mahal, both commissioned by descendants of Timur. Entrance to mausoleum. Typical architecture of Timurid type. The double dome technique executed in the mausoleum made possible the huge domes of the Timurid era. The dome is created by employing a squinch, or corner bracketing, that allows for the transition from a square, octagonal or 16-sided base to a dome top. Indeed, the mausoleum's main dome remains the largest existing brick dome in Central Asia. The use of glazed tiles, mosaics, patterned brickwork, and Islamic calligraphy was also influential. Advances in pottery techniques allowed for the mass production of glazed tiles used for various decorative functions. Among the techniques devised for tile decoration are: * Banna‚Äôi technique: the \\"builder's technique,\\" consists of revetment of glazed bricks set within unglazed ones to form geometric patterns * Haftrangi: a technique that permits the creation of multi-colored patterns on the same tile before firing without letting the colors mix * Faience: a patterned arrangement of closely fitted small pieces of tiles which have surface glaze of different colors The employment of tiles and muqarnas bear strong influence from Iran, where many of Timur's architects were from. The covered surfaces create visual effects based on how the observer would view the building, and \\"read\\" the calligraphic messages. The tile work was also used to obscure the structural joints of the building. The use of turquoise and azure-blue as the prominent color of choice for many structures were meant to contrast with the bright sunlight of the Central Asian desert. Prominent examples of Timurid domes: from Turkestan's Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi, left, and from Samarkand's Gur-i Amir, right. The mausoleum's construction at a time when many other Central Asian settlements had been experiencing building sprees under Timur's political ideology allowed for the exchange of ideas and techniques across the empire. Master builders and laborers from the conquered cities congregated to build projects. The employment of Persian architects in leading the major construction activities resulted in the introduction of Persian elements in the Timurid style. This and the Timurids‚Äô general patronage of the arts have made them the greatest patrons of Iranian culture. The landmark architectural and artistic solutions realized in the erection of the Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi were immediately utilized in other building endeavors, such as contemporary works in Samarkand, Herat, Meshed, Khargird, Tayabad, Baku and Tabriz. It is thought that the peak of Timurid Architecture could be found in the buildings of Samarkand. Timur filled his capital with both secular and religious monuments, as well as a plethora of gardens, which featured stone walls and floors with elaborate patterns and palaces outfitted with gold, silk and carpets. Among these are: * Bibi-Khanum Mosque: the world's largest mosque when it was completed in 1404; it displays Timur's concern for monumental effect and theatrical arrangement * Gur-i-Amir Mausoleum: the burial place of Timur; it contains a double shell dome for the achievement of a vertical effect * Shah-i Zinda Complex: a funerary complex presenting the pinnacle of every tile technique known to the Timurids * Registan: considered the pinnacle of Timurid architecture; a broad plaza fronted by the towering edifices of three madrassas (Islamic schools), even if none of them were commissioned by Timur himself and were built in a later period by Ulug Beg and Governor Yalangtush. The mausoleum is thus seen as a prototype, marking the beginning of a new architectural style, which culminated in the monuments of Samarkand, but was also continuously developed as in the case of India's Mughal Architecture. Indeed, the Timurids‚Äô outstanding achievement in architecture is encapsulated in an Arab proverb from one of Timur's buildings, \\"If you want to know about us, observe our buildings.\\" It is also for this reason that UNESCO has recognized the mausoleum as a World Heritage Site in 2003, following the same international recognition for the sites of Samarkand, Humayun's Tomb and Taj Mahal. The interior view of the Mausoleum of Ahmad Yasavi. =Religious and cultural importance= The larger mausoleum which Timurid ordered further enhanced the shrine's religious importance. During the Kazakh Khanate, prominent personalities chose to be buried within the immediate vicinity of the monument. Among these are Abulkhair, Rabi'i Sultan-Begim, Zholbarys-khan, Esim-khan, Ondan-sultan (the son of Shygai-khan), Ablai Khan, Kaz dauysty Kazbek-bi. The mausoleum's holy reputation also reached foreign lands. In the early 16th century, Ubaydullah Khan, the successor to Muhammad Shaybani Kahn of the neighboring Uzbek Khanate, stopped at the mausoleum before his battle against Babur, who would later become the founder of the Mughal Empire. He swore that if he were to emerge victorious, his rule would fully follow the sharia law. Despite the public closure of the monument during the Soviet era, the mausoleum has continued to draw pilgrims once the order was lifted. Up to contemporary times, the Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi has remained an object of pilgrimage for Kazakh Muslims. Hence, the town of Turkestan became the second Mecca for the Muslims of Central Asia Indeed, the mausoleum's importance to the town is attested by Turkestan's former name, Hazrat-e Turkestan, which literally means \\"Saint of Turkestan,\\" a direct reference to Yasawi. As the capital of the preceding Kazakh Khanate, which saw the emergence of the distinct Kazakh nationality, Turkestan remains the cultural heart of modern Kazakhstan. Being the burial site for the Sufi theologian and the khanate's Kazakh nobility, the mausoleum has further enhanced the town's prestige. The continuance of the Kazakh nation and Central Asian Islamic faith in modern times are testaments to the historical and cultural importance of Turkestan, with the Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi at its center. Perceived as one of the greatest mausoleums of the Islamic world, it has survived and remains a significant monument both to faith and architectural achievement in the region.

He was also the last Dean of Durham to govern the university. Early life Kitchin was the son of the Reverend Isaac Kitchin, Rector of St. Stephen's, Naughton, Suffolk.The Oxford Magazine, Volume 31 (1913), p. 20 He was educated at King's College School and King's College, London, then at Christ Church, Oxford, where in 1850 he took a Double First in Classics and Mathematics, promoted by seniority to MA (Oxon) in 1852.Kitchin on the Christian Classics Ethereal Library at Calvin College website Career In 1854, Kitchin was an examiner in Mathematics at Christ Church.Kitchin on the 'Centre for Church Music' website He soon left Oxford to become Headmaster of Twyford Preparatory School in Hampshire, but returned to residence at Oxford as Censor in 1861. While at Christ Church, in late 1861 he was partly responsible for the ending of the Latin Prayer Service, conducted there since time immemorial, and for the continuation of which special provision had been made in the Act of Uniformity 1662.Henry Lewis Thompson, Henry George Liddell, D.D., dean of Christ church, Oxford (J. Murray, 1899), p. 153 Kitchin served as Oxford's first Junior Censor of non-collegiate students from 1868 to 1883. He was also Select Preacher at Oxford for 1863‚Äì1864 and Whitehall Preacher for 1866‚Äì1867. He took a break from Oxford life to live at Brantwood, in the Lake District, from 1869 to 1871, a property later bought by his friend John Ruskin. While there he undertook assignments for the Clarendon Press, including working on the proofs of Richard Cleasby and Gudbrand Vigfusson's Icelandic-English Dictionary. He was appointed as Chaplain to William Jacobson, Bishop of Chester, from 1871 to 1872, was tutor of Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark (later Frederick VIII of Denmark), and was lecturer and tutor in History at Christ Church from 1870 to 1883. He was also Commissary to Charles Sandford, Bishop of Gibraltar, from 1874 to 1904, and was an Honorary Fellow of King's College, London, and an honorary Student (meaning Fellow) of Christ Church. In theology he was a moderate liberal. The grave of George Kitchin, Durham Cathedral churchyard In 1879, Kitchin was a member of a committee formed to create a women's college at Oxford \\"in which no distinction will be made between students on the ground of their belonging to different religious denominations.\\" This resulted in the founding of Somerville Hall, later renamed Somerville College. In 1883, Kitchin was appointed as Dean of Winchester and in 1894 as Dean of Durham. At Oxford, his friends included John Ruskin and Lewis Carroll.Clarke, Garth, Michael Cardew, London: Faber and Faber, 1976. . While Dean of Winchester Kitchin was responsible for refurbishments within the Cathedral, most notably the restoration of the mediaeval reredos behind the High Altar, usually known as 'The Great Screen'. The restoration was initially entrusted to the architect J D Sedding. However, Sedding's design for the scheme did not meet with general satisfaction and was not implemented.Sedding's architectural design drawing is held at The National Monuments Record, Swindon. Thereafter, Kitchin personally took over and master-minded the entire project, essentially as his own architect, commissioning the many new statues needed to populate the restored screen. When completed, this was acclaimed as one of the Church of England's major artistic ecclesiastical restorations of the 19th century. Kitchin wrote the hymn 'Lift High the Cross' in 1887 for a Missionary Service in Winchester Cathedral. Kitchin described several biblical manuscripts: Uncial 0132, minuscule 73, Minuscule 506, Minuscule 507, and Minuscule 639. In 1910, when the University of Durham was given a new constitution, Kitchin was elected as its first Chancellor and remained in office until his death two years later. He died on 13 October 1912. He is buried on the west (right hand side) of the entrance path to Durham Cathedral next to Bishop Alfred Tucker. Private life On 8 September 1863, at Westminster Abbey, Kitchin married Alice Maud Taylor, second daughter of Bridges Taylor, the British consul in Denmark.Glasgow Herald, 10 September 1863. Their daughter Alexandra, known as 'Xie', born in 1864, became Lewis Carroll's favourite photographic subject. Their son George Herbert Kitchin (1870‚Äì1951), was a prolific architect, especially in Hampshire. Examples of his work include Compton End, Winchester, Lyegrove House, Sodbury, and Horsley Hall, Gresford. He was also a botanist and garden architect. They had three further children, two sons, Hugh Bridges and Brook Taylor, and a second daughter, Dorothy Maud Mary.
