She finished her studies at Santa Catalina College, Marcela acquired her learning in music and feminine crafts. At the age of 30, Marcela Coronel Mari√±o married Felipe Encarnacion Agoncillo, a Filipino lawyer, and a jurist, and gave birth to six children. Her marriage led an important role in Philippine history. When her husband was exiled in Hong Kong during the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution, Marcela Mari√±o Agoncillo and the rest of the family joined him and temporarily resided there to avoid the anti- Filipino hostilities of the occupying Spain. While in Hong Kong, General Emilio Aguinaldo requested her to sew the flag that would represent the Republic of the Philippines. Do√±a Marcela Mari√±o de Agoncillo, with her eldest daughter Lorenza and a friend Delfina Herbosa Natividad, niece of Dr. Jose Rizal, manually sewed the flag in accordance with General Emilio Aguinaldo's design which later became the official flag of the Republic of the Philippines. While the flag itself is the perpetual legacy of Do√±a Marcela Mari√±o de Agoncillo, she is also commemorated through museums and monuments: like the marker in Hong Kong (where her family temporarily sojourned), at her ancestral home in Taal, Batangas which has been turned into a museum, in paintings by notable painters as well as through other visual arts. Early life Marcela Coronel Mari√±o was born on June 24, 1859 in Taal, Batangas, Philippines to Don Francisco Diokno Mari√±o and Do√±a Eugenia Coronel Mari√±o. She grew up in her ancestral Mari√±o house in Taal, Batangas built in the 1770s by her grandparents, Don Andres Sauza Mari√±o and Do√±a Eugenia Diokno Mari√±o. As a daughter of a rich and religious family, Marcela Coronel Mari√±o was referred to in their town as Roselang Bubog which means \\"a virgin enthroned in the town church\\". Stories told in the area related that people kept waiting patiently by the church patio for her appearance in the morning to attend mass accompanied either by a maid or an elder relative. Marcela Coronel Mari√±o was sent to a convent after her education in Manila. The convent she was studying in was the Santa Catalina College of the Dominican nuns, an exclusive school for girls, established in the Walled City of Intramuros where she finished her elementary and secondary education. In college, she learned Spanish, music, the feminine crafts and social graces. She spent her girlhood partly in their hometown and partly in the convent. Accordingly, Marcela was skilled in needlework. Ancestral House of Marcela Mari√±o de Agoncillo in Taal, Batangas Marriage and family Marcela Coronel Mari√±o was married to Felipe Encarnacion Agoncillo, a rich Filipino revolutionist (KKK) and the first Filipino diplomat. They were both thirty and Felipe was already a judge when they finally married. The Agoncillo moved from Taal to Manila, where they lived together in a two-story house on M.H. del Pillar St., Malate, near the Malate church. Six daughters were born to them: Lorenza (\\"Enchang\\"), Gregoria (\\"Goring\\"), Eugenia (\\"Nene\\"), Marcela (\\"Celing\\", named after her mother because they thought she would be their last child), Adela (who died at the age of three) and the youngest, Maria (\\"Maring\\", who was their last surviving child and died on July 6, 1995). Most of her daughters became teachers. Gregoria Mari√±o Agoncillo was the first Filipina to graduate from Oxford University. After the graduation of the three elder daughters, they were offered to positions to teach. Lorenza was given an appointment to teach in Malate Catholic School. They so immersed themselves in the respective teaching careers that not one of them chose to be married. However, Maria Mari√±o Agoncillo married Leoncio Noble later on in life, with children: Anita Mari√±o Agoncillo Noble (Miss Philippines 1926), Froila Mari√±o Agoncillo Noble and Vicente Mari√±o Agoncillo Noble. Do√±a Marcela Mari√±o de Agoncillo cared for all of her daughters until they reached maturity. One of her favorite pieces of advice to them was to \\"live honestly and well, and to work hard and not depend on family property. Besides the legal services rendered by Felipe to the impoverished, Do√±a Marcela Mari√±o Agoncillo and her daughters observed every Thursday as a day of charity, when a queue of needy people seeking alms would form in the Agoncillo driveway. No one ever left their house empty-handed. Agoncillo would hand them a bag of rice in addition to the money she gave them. This practice lasted until the couple retired. Exile in Hong Kong After learning of the plans of the Governor-General of the Philippines (Basilio Augustin y Davila) to deport Don Felipe Encarnacion Agoncillo, he sailed to Yokohama, Japan, staying there only briefly until proceeding to Hong Kong where he joined other Filipino exiles who found asylum when the revolution broke out in 1896. Twenty-two months after the departure of Don Felipe Encarnacion Agoncillo for Hong Kong, the Agoncillos and the rest of the family (her last two daughters were not yet born) followed him into exile. They rented a house at 535 Morrison Hill in the Wan Chai district. While in Hong Kong, Agoncillo gave birth to their last child on March 22, 1906. Don Felipe Encarnacion Agoncillo, being an exile himself, received any Filipino who came into their house. Thereafter, the place became a sanctuary for other Filipino revolutionary exiles. They initiated meetings in the Agoncillo's residence, especially during the critical months of March and April 1898. Among these folks were Gen. Antonio Luna and General Emilio Aguinaldo. Also, Josephine Bracken, Jose Rizal's fianc√©e, sought refuge in their house when the Spanish authorities threatened to torture her. =The Making of the Philippine flag= The detail of Fernando Amorsolo's The Making of the Philippine flag depicting Agoncillo and company's manual sewing After the signing of the Pact of Biak-na-Bato on December 14, 1897, General Emilio Aguinaldo visited the Agoncillo residence in Hong Kong after their voluntary exile. After having met them, General Emilio Aguinaldo requested that Do√±a Marcela Mari√±o de Agoncillo immediately hand-sew a flag according to his design which would embody the national aspirations of all Filipinos. After receiving the request, Do√±a Marcela Mari√±o Agoncillo delegated her eldest daughter, five-year-old Lorenza Mari√±o Agoncillo, and Mrs. Delfina Herbosa Natividad, Dr.Jos√© Rizal's niece by his sister Lucia, to help her make the first Philippine flag. The process took only a short time, but it was difficult. The three worked manually and with the aid of a sewing machine. They had to redo the flag after the rays of the sun were not in the proper direction. Their eyes and hands suffered due to the prolonged work session. Made from 100% fine silk which she bought in Hong Kong, the flag was embroidered in gold and contained stripes of blue and red and a white triangle with the sun and three stars on it. The flag was finished in five days and became known as \\"The Three Stars and a Sun flag\\". The thimble used by Do√±a Marcela Mari√±o de Agoncillo in sewing the first Philippine flag; on display at Presidential Museum & Library. On May 17, 1898, the flag was delivered personally by Agoncillo and was packed among the things President Emilio Aguinaldo brought back to Manila. This flag was hoisted from the window of Aguinaldo's house in Kawit, Cavite, during the proclamation of Philippine independence on June 12, 1898 accompanied by the Philippine National Anthem Marcha Filipina. However, she did not witness either this first public display of the flag or the time when the flag was unfurled during the Malolos Congress because her husband remained in Hong Kong and she remained with him. In response to the message written by General Emilio Aguinaldo, Do√±a Marcela Mari√±o de Agoncillo wrote the following statement when she was interviewed: Post-exile and death Do√±a Marcela Mari√±o de Agoncillo and her daughters stayed in Hong Kong from 1895 to 1906. She took care of their house, which became an asylum. Their funds had run out because of the heavy expenses incurred by Don Felipe for his diplomatic activities in France and in the United States. She once had to sell the children's pinafores and their jewels to support her family and to pay for their voyage back to Manila. The other money was also used to help boost the revolutionary funds. Their support for the revolution made them an impoverished family; however, they gained it back when Felipe resumed his legal practice. After the fall of the first Philippine Republic and the establishment of the American regime, Do√±a Marcela Mari√±o de Agoncillo and her family ended their exile and went back to Manila as soon as they were fetched by Don Felipe after his diplomatic activities abroad had ended. The Agoncillos settled in their family house in Malate. After the death of Don Felipe, Agoncillo's remaining family suffered from starvation due to their meager supply of food, water and other needs. The Japanese conquerors also contributed to their anguish during the period of the Japanese invasion. Taking this all in stride, Marcela remained pragmatic and a source of inspiration. After their house was incinerated during the Japanese occupation, all she said to her remaining daughters was \\"We will then have to go to Taal.\\" Though she endured the 1945 Battle of Manila, the health of Do√±a Marcela Mari√±o de Agoncillo, who was alternatively called Marcela and \\"Lola Celay\\" during her old age, was steadily deteriorating. She continued to mourn her deceased husband to such an extent that her daughters found it necessary to hide all his remaining photographs. On May 30, 1946, she quietly died in Taal at the age of 86. Her mortal remains were brought from Taal to Manila and interred alongside her husband in the Catholic cemetery of La Loma according to the wishes of her last will.

(Marcela Agoncillo Elementary School) Several commemorative figures were created in remembrance of Agoncillo's historic family. On November 27, 1955, a marker was erected by the National Historical Institute of the Philippines and a museum was established in Taal, Batangas in accordance with her last wish and was named Marcela Mari√±o de Agoncillo Museum and Monument. The museum is Mari√±o-Agoncillo ancestral house. The house- turned-museum permanently exhibits flags and a diorama depicting the sewing of the first flag. A bronze statue of her holding the flag was erected outside the house in its garden. In Hong Kong, a historical marker was created by the Hong Kong Antiquities Council at Morrison Hill Park to commemorate the site where the first Philippine flag was sewn. However, the place where the Agoncillos resided, the location of the Hong Kong Junta, and other locations of historical importance to Filipinos remain unmarked. Do√±a Marcela Mari√±o de Agoncillo's legacy is remembered through the visual arts as well. In 1996, Filipino National Artist Napoleon Abueva created the concrete and marble sculpture Three Women Weaving the Filipino Flag at the UP Diliman to commemorate Agoncillo and the other two women who assisted her in their important task.Moreover, The Marcela Agoncillo Elementary School is made to honor her. Renowned Filipino painter Fernando Amorsolo painted the historical sewing and is nationally known as The Making of the Philippine flag.

Plot Elmer is the owner of a gas station somewhere on the desert highway. One day a family of ruthless businessmen show up and erect their own gas station directly opposite Elmer's and begin competing with him. The two businesses repeatedly lower their prices for gas with Elmer eventually gaining the upper hand, but when the customers arrive they believe Elmer's gas to be cheap since it is going for such a low price and get gas from the rival station instead. When a beautiful girl arrives at Elmer's station he attempts to brush all of the desert sand off of the girl's car but ends up covering her in it. While Elmer is attending to the girl, the rival businessman pumps gas into her car and flirts with the girl. He tells the girl that he runs a baseball team nearby and invites her to watch him play. Elmer, fueled by jealousy challenges the businessmen to an impromptu baseball practice and is quickly outclassed. The two agree to assemble their own teams and face one another the next day. The beautiful girl arrives and decides she'll go on a date with whoever wins. During the game, both men resort to cheating, with the businessman tying the home base to his ankle so he can drag it closer to him, and Keaton using a bat twice its regular size. The conclusion of the game comes when Elmer steals a bullet from a nearby policeman's holster and places it inside his bat. When the opposing team pitches the ball, Elmer hits it with the bat and the resulting boom sends the ball flying across the desert, allowing Elmer to win the game. Elmer and the beautiful girl embrace but the rival businessman sneaks up and kisses the girl. The girl goes to slap the businessman but Elmer unwittingly moves into the path of the slap. Shocked, Elmer runs off across the sand as the girl chases after him.

She obtained a first-class degree and she would have been Fifth Wrangler in 1898 (if she had been a man). She took part two of the mathematical tripos in 1899. Career and continued studies Like her sister, she was usually known by the single surname Cave professionally. Along with Beatrice, she worked with Karl Pearson at University College London.David Alan Grier, When Computers Were Human, Princeton University Press, 2005, pp. 111-112 Her work was funded by the first research grant offered at Girton: an Old Students‚Äô Research Studentship from Girton, provided by Florence Margaret Durham. Her research in the field of meteorology produced two publications in the Proceedings of the Royal Society which discussed barometric measurements, and was read to the British Association at Cambridge in 1904. In 1903, Cave returned to Girton as a fellow. She prioritised teaching over research, and focussed on developing the weakest students because she felt that was where the biggest difference could be made. She became the Director of Studies in 1918. She was on the executive council of the college and was largely responsible for drafting the Charter of incorporation granted in 1924. Cave was made Honorary Fellow of Girton in 1942. Cave received an MA from Trinity College, Dublin in 1907 (since the rules of Cambridge University did not then permit women to take degrees) and from Cambridge in 1926.

There are railway stations at Pamban and Rameswaram. Rameswaram with a population of 38,035 (2001 census) is the largest and most populous town on the island. It is one of the most sacred Hindu religious sites and a pilgrimage destination for thousands of Hindus every year. The Ramanathaswamy Temple at Rameswaram has the longest corridor in Asia. Rameswaram is situated at the centre of the island, around 11 kilometres from the township of Pamban and 18 kilometres from Dhanushkodi. Pamban, situated at the western edge of Pamban Island, is a fishing village and a harbour which is the main point of entry for the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram. It has a population of around 9,000 inhabitants. Its importance has enhanced because it is located at the eastern end of Pamban Bridge through which supplies enter the island. Pamban is 11 kilometres from Rameswaram, 30 kilometres from the tip of Dhanushkodi and around 7 kilometres from Mandapam on the Indian mainland. It is separated from the Indian mainland by a narrow strip of sea. Thangachimadam situated between Pamban and Rameswaram is a minor settlement. It derives its name from a mutt(Madam) which is located in the town. There are a couple of temples and a few churches. The township is also served by a police station. Ekantharamar Temple constructed and maintained by the Kanchi mutt is the main attraction here. At the eastern tip of the island lies the site of Dhanushkodi, a harbour and a pilgrimage centre, was washed away by the December 1964 cyclone. Prior to its destruction it was a flourishing township and a prominent place of pilgrimage. In its heyday, it rivalled Rameswaram in size and population. However, the December 1964 cyclone destroyed the town in its entirety claiming over 2,000 lives and crippling power supply and communications. Houses, temples, churches, dispensaries and dharmashalas were destroyed leaving nothing but a ghost town. Some of the dharmashalas and a prominent mutt based in Dhanushkodi have been moved to Rameswaram. But Dhanushkodi could never be rebuilt. Dhanushkodi was well connected by rail and road with Pamban and the mainland until the cyclone struck. The ruins of the station and the railway track have been left untouched thereby making the ghost-town a popular tourist destination.  Physical features and vegetation  Pamban Island has a few hillocks and elevated physical features in the vicinity of Rameswaram of which Mt. Gandamadana is the tallest. It is believed that this was the hillock from whose summit Lord Rama observed Sri Lanka and conceived the idea of constructing a bridge between India and Sri Lanka. A temple commemorates the site. Most of Pamban Island is covered with white sand and hence is not suitable for cultivation. Coconut and palm trees are found in abundance along with fig and eucalyptus plants. Scrubs and rushes are found in abundance all along the sea-shore.

Early life Molly Lefebure was born in the London Borough of Hackney on 6 October 1919, the daughter of Charles Hector Lefebure OBE (1941 Birthday Honours) and Elizabeth Cox. Charles Lefebure's family was descended from prominent arms manufacturers in 18th-century Paris. He was a senior civil servant who worked with Sir William Beveridge on the establishment of the National Health Service, applying some of the revolutionary ideas of Robespierre, the Parisian Lefebures having professed Jacobin sympathies. Some of Lefebure's forebears had been men of letters. One of them, Pierre Lefebure, helped to set up the Institut Fran√ßais, and became a professor of languages at the newly formed University of London. Her uncle was Major Victor Lefebure (OBE, Chavalier of the Legion of Honour and Officer of the Crown of Italy) who, on 5‚Äì6 October 1916, carried out one of the most successful cylinder gas attacks of World War I, on the French front at Nieuport. He was a British chemical liaisons officer with the French until the war closed, and wrote The Riddle of the Rhine: Chemical strategy in Peace and War. During childhood summers on a remote farm on Exmoor, arranged by her maternal grandmother, Lefebure learned to hunt. Molly Lefebure was educated at the North London Collegiate School, and went on to study at King's College London where she met her future husband, John Gerrish.  Career  During World War II she worked as a reporter for a London newspaper and met the pathologist Dr Keith Simpson. Despite initial hesitation, she became his secretary for almost five years, during which time she gained the information for her first book Evidence for the Crown. It became the inspiration for the 2013 two-part ITV drama Murder on the Home Front, a title used for the book when it was republished in 2013. Lefebure was the first woman ever to work at Southwark mortuary, and she became known as 'Molly of the morgue' by Scotland Yard detectives. Lefebure wrote on hunting for both The Field and Country Life, and was a member of the Blencathra Hunt in the Lake District for more than 50 years. Lefebure was a Coleridge scholar, and among her 20 or so other books was a 1974 biography of the poet, subtitled The Bondage of Opium, which followed a six-year study of drug addiction at Guy's Hospital in London. She also wrote a study of Coleridge's wife, The Bondage of Love (1986), which won Lefebure the Lakeland Book of the Year award. This was followed by a study of the Coleridge children, The Private Lives of the Ancient Mariner. She also wrote several novels, and two studies of drug addiction under the name Mary Blandy, an 18th-century forebear who was convicted of poisoning her father. Lefebure's children's books include illustrations by the famous Lakeland author, hill walker and illustrator Alfred Wainwright. She was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2010.  Personal life  Lefebure and John Gerrish married at Marylebone in 1945, after he returned from active service in India. They lived by the river at Kingston-upon-Thames and had two children. In 1957 they bought a house, \\"Low High Snab\\", in Newlands Valley, Cumbria, where Lefebure wrote many of her books.

Plot A young man named Elmer answers an ad from a woman looking for a new husband. He arrives at the house, meets a young girl named Molly, and is immediately smitten with her. He discovers that the person who placed the ad was not Molly but her aunt. Molly's aunt sets Elmer and Molly to work washing dishes in the kitchen, but the clumsy pair end up smashing them. That evening, Molly's aunt plays the piano and sings boisterously, causing many objects in the house to fall and break despite Elmer's best efforts to save them. As Elmer tries to sleep that night, rain drips onto him from a hole in the roof. He climbs up on the roof to try to patch, but falls through it and lands on Molly's aunt's bed, propelling her through the bedroom window and into a muddy puddle. Elmer covers the giant hole in the roof with a blanket. The rain eventually fills it, causing it to burst, and sending the water flooding down onto Elmer, and then Molly's aunt on the floor below his. The aunt makes her way up to Elmer's bedroom and accidentally sends him out of the window and into the same muddy puddle. Elmer decides to spend the night in the barn instead. The next morning, he tries to tell Molly he loves her, but is repeatedly interrupted by her aunt. That night, Elmer is confronted by a ghostly version of himself who tells him that he needs to leave before Molly's aunt discovers he is in love with Molly. As he tries to flee, the aunt catches him and marches him at gunpoint to the Justice of the Peace. A quickie wedding is organised, but at the last minute it is revealed that the arranged wedding is for Elmer and Molly. As Elmer prepares to marry Molly, he sees the ghostly version of himself again, but chases it off with a gun, shooting it in the backside.

He stood only 5'6\\" tall but could hit the ball with prodigious power and efficiency. In fact, Satchel Paige called him one of the two most dangerous hitters in Negro league history. He had a good eye and hit line drives to all fields, striking fear into opposing pitchers. Biography Smith was born in Greenwood, South Carolina and played for the semipro Philadelphia Giants in 1924. He worked at New York City's Penn Station and played in 1925 for their baseball team, the Pennsylvania Red Caps of New York, playing for them as a second baseman alongside shortstop Dick Seay.Martin, Alfred M.; Martin, Alfred T. (2008). The Negro Leagues in New Jersey : A History. Mcfarland & Co Inc. Smith broke into the professional Brooklyn Royal Giants later that year. He recorded batting averages of .341 in 1925 and .439 in 1927. In 1929, he joined the New York Lincoln Giants of the new American Negro League, and batted .464, collecting 118 hits in only 67 games, with 23 home runs and 24 doubles, all of which paced the league. The league was not a stable one, however, and it folded the next year, with the Lincoln Giants continuing on as an independent team. They battled the Homestead Grays for the eastern title, only to lose out at the end of the season. During this season he hit opposing pitchers at a .468 clip. In 1930, Smith played in the first game involving a black team at Yankee Stadium; he hit a triple and two home runs. The incomplete records of the time show that Smith had a .423 career batting average in Negro league competition. He hit .335 in Cuban winter ball and .405 (or .423 depending upon sources) against white major leaguers. Smith's nickname of \\"Chino\\" is thought to have originated from his Asian-like appearance. Author James A. Riley wrote, \\"A line drive hitter whose line shots to all parts of the ballpark looked like frozen ropes, he had a good eye at the plate and rarely struck out. Going with the pitch to all fields, he hit everything thrown to him and respected no pitcher. Sometimes he would spit at a pitcher's best offerings as it came across the plate, taking two strikes before lining a base hit through the middle. Supremely confident at the plate, the little slugger had no weakness.\\"Riley, James A. (1994). The Biographical Encyclopedia of The Negro Baseball Leagues. Carrol & Graf Publishers Inc., New York. Fellow Negro leaguer Cool Papa Bell said, \\"He'd go out there, say 'I guess I'll get me three hits,' and go out there and hit that ball. I don't care who pitched, he could do everything.\\"  Illness and death  At the age of 30, Smith became ill with yellow fever while playing in Cuba and died. On what would have been his 51st birthday, Smith got the second most votes as best right fielder in the 1952 Pittsburgh Courier player-voted poll of the Negro leagues' best players ever.\\"1952 Pittsburgh Courier Poll of Greatest Black Players\\" See also * List of baseball players who died during their careers References * Shatzkin, Mike, Editor, \\"The Ballplayers\\" (1990), William Morrow and Company, New York, External links Category:1903 births Category:1932 deaths Category:Baltimore Black Sox players Category:Baseball players from South Carolina Category:Brooklyn Royal Giants players Category:Lincoln Giants players Category:Pennsylvania Red Caps of New York players Category:People from Greenwood, South Carolina ","title":"Chino Smith"},{"id":"14067843","text":"John Douglas Edwards (26 February 1931 ‚Äì 23 August 2014) was an Australian rules footballer who played with North Melbourne in the Victorian Football League (VFL) during the 1950s.

The reissue was 100% analog mastered using the original master tapes provided to the label by the original sound engineer on the project, Phill Brown. The album quickly became Intervention‚Äôs best selling reissue ever and resulted in Murray Head‚Äôs decision to perform songs from the album live for the first time ever.

Velo 1  The initial Velo 1 was a PDA device released by Philips in August 1997.Was senior product manager for mobile software for the Philips Velo 1 * Launched one of the first mobile Windows CE mobile devices into the consumer electronics market. * Device won Best of Comdex award. * Was the first PDA to include software for voice recording and compression, fax, software modem and built-in database. The device was typical of the HPCs at the time, being powered by two AA batteries or a rechargeable NiMH battery pack. The device had a green back-lit 5.1-inch resistive touchscreen with a resolution of 480√ó240 pixels at two bits per pixel which allowed for the display of four shades of grey. It originally shipped with Windows CE 1.0, with a ROM upgrade to Windows CE 2.0 that customers could order for $99.99. Expandability was via two internal 'miniature' expansion slots, as well as a PCMCIA slot in the docking station. The standard model included 4 MB of RAM and 5 MB ROM. An 8 MB model with NiMH battery pack was also available for $839.99 with a free upgrade to Windows CE 2.0 when it was available. Unlike most other HPCs, the Velo 1 included a built-in low-power software modem, where most other devices required a PCMCIA card modem. PCMCIA cards quickly drain batteries, so the low-power software modem helped eke out battery life. The modem operated at 14.4 kbit/s. Other communication features included an infrared (IrDa) port and serial port, both capable of a maximum transmission rate of 112,500 bit/s. The MIPS processor in the unit made its performance snappy compared to other devices, such as the HP 300LX or HP320LX.  Velo 500  In July, 1998 the Velo 1 was replaced by the Velo 500, which included more RAM and ROM and a much faster Philips PR31700 MIPS processor running at 75 MHz. The Velo 500 had a widescreen resolution of 620√ó240 pixels, which was becoming the norm. Not only did the screen feature more horizontal pixels, it now displayed in four bits per pixel, allowing 16 shades of grey to be displayed. It featured up to 24 MiB of RAM as well as an upgrade to the software modem, which operated at 28.8 kbit/s, a digital voice recorder and shipped with Windows CE 2.0.Unofficial Velo FAQ Page - My Velo 1Philips Velo 500 HPC Review, by Julie Strietelmeier, June 5, 1998, The GadgeteerPhilips Licenses Spyglass Windows CE Technology for Velo 500 Handheld PC, 1997 July 15, PRNewswireFeatures - Philips Velo 500, By Dan Hanttula, 1998 ,Pen Computing Magazine See also * Philips Nino References External links * Philips HPC at linux-mips.org Category:Mobile computers Category:Philips products Category:Windows CE devices ","title":"Philips Velo"},{"id":"14067930","text":"The list of Moscow State University people includes notable alumni, non- graduates, and faculty affiliated with the Lomonosov Moscow State University (also known as \\"Moscow State University\\").

Design The original engines were built in Belfast by Harland & Wolff under licence from Burmeister & Wain known as the \\"Harlandic\\" type. An eight cylinder in line uniflow two-stroke engines with blower scavenging which developed at 1200 rpm. The transmission was a Voith-Sinclair torque converter design with two final drive gear ratios, geared for 0r . Two \\"National\\" diesel generator sets producing DC power for train lighting and air conditioning. In 1953 spare parts supply difficulties and engine age prompted the NSWGR to re-engine the fleet with four 6‚Äì110 GM diesel engines rated at at 1800 rpm coupled in pairs driving Allison torque converters to the inner axle of each bogie. These are coupled in pairs through a GM Model TCLA 965 torque converter to gear boxes connected to each of the bogies. A Standard Waygood GM 120 volt, , generator set for power requirements including train lighting, cooking and air conditioning. The power van was re- classed 'DP', tare weight was . Service Broken Hill had two tramways which were established by the early 1900s. One was closed in 1926 due to being unprofitable while the other was converted to standard gauge rail in 1919 and eventually connected to Sydney via the Broken Hill line in 1927. When the rolling stock was ordered, it was planned that they would be utilised on both the Parkes to Broken Hill and Dubbo to Bourke services. In September 1937 the Silver City Comet commenced operating three times a week between Parkes and Broken Hill connecting with the Western Mail from Sydney. This was increased to daily from May 1938 before reverting to thrice weekly in October 1939. This released some stock for transfer to Sydney to operate Federal City Express services to Canberra from October 1939 until November 1945. In April 1940 the remaining stock was also transferred to Sydney to operate Newcastle Flyer services for a few months. From January 1957, Silver City Comet stock operated a three times per week service from Parkes to Orange and Dubbo. Following the introduction of the Central West XPT service to Dubbo, in April 1982 this was cut back to Orange, but was extended to start at Forbes.. By 1983, the Parkes - Forbes section was by bus. By 1986, the mail was withdrawn. Silver City Comet was retimed to connect with Central West XPT, three days per week each way. The Orange - Forbes connection on the other four days was now by airconditioned bus. Rolling stock The New South Wales Government Railways placed orders for five diesel power vans with Eveleigh Carriage Workshops and 12 trailer cars with Ritchie Brothers, Auburn in the mid-1930s. The double ended power cars were each fitted with two Harland & Wolff Hardlandic diesel engines. PH 105 was destroyed by fire at Ivanhoe in January 1950 with the remaining four repowered with General Motors 6‚Äì110 engines between 1952 and 1957. DP 102 was withdrawn after being struck at a level crossing at Forbes in August 1982. The carriages were the first in Australia to feature air- conditioning.Comets of the Silver City Railpix Originally painted silver with blue lining, in the 1950s they were repainted in the standard tuscan and russet livery. By the 1970s they had returned to their original livery. In the 1980s they were repainted into the State Rail Authority's candy colours before once again being returned to their original livery in time for their 50th anniversary in 1987.\\"Happy Birthday Silver City Comet\\" Railway Digest September 1987 page 278 In its twilight years the Silver City Comet became a popular train for enthusiast tours including operating to Melbourne (Vic.) in February 1983, up the North Coast line to Brisbane in April 1986 and the Main Northern line to Tenterfield in October 1989.\\"Another Comet Passes By\\" Railway Digest July 1986 page 199\\"By Comet to (Almost) Wallangarra\\" Railway Digest December 1989 page 415 In September 1987, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of their entry into service, a set operated tours from Sydney to Canberra and Kiama.\\"Silver City Comet ‚Äì 50th Anniversary\\" Railway Digest November 1987 page 347 Trailer Cars Along with the power cars, 12 air-conditioned passenger trailers were ordered from Ritchie Brothers of Auburn NSW. The trailers were built in three configurations ‚Äì four First Class sitting cars (coded BT 201‚Äì204), four Second Class sitting cars with buffet (coded RFT 205‚Äì208) and four Second Class sitting cars (coded FT 209‚Äì212). Two additional parcel trailers (coded HT 301‚Äì302) were also constructed by NSWGR Carriage Works at Eveleigh, NSW. The passenger trailers were each 55 feet long while the parcel trailers were 42 feet long. All cars featured a full-length side skirt below the floor level, partially covering the bogies and underfloor equipment. They were all painted in the same silver and blue livery as the power cars. The trailers were constructed principally of aluminium alloy on a steel underframe. The cars were arranged internally with two saloons separated by male and female toilets. Entrance doors and vestibules were provided at each end. The trailers were refurbished in the early 1950s to bring them up to the same standard as the new air-conditioned HUB and RUB daylight express carriages. The original First Class seating was retained and reclassified as Second Class, while new First Class seating was installed. Two buffet cars (DR 205 and 207) were also converted into full dining cars. FT 212 was converted to a relief parcel trailer in 1953 and was condemned following a shunting accident in 1968. Following the demise of DEH 212 an Emergency Parcel Trailer {ETP 1475) was converted to operate with the Comet and renumbered EDH 320. This vehicle was condemned in 1981. To fulfil the luggage and parcel loading requirements on Comet services following the withdrawal of DH 301 and 302 and EDH 320, two surplus 500 Class trailer cars (HCT 504 and 508) were converted into Comet parcels trailers in 1985. Demise and Preservation On 3 November 1989 the final Silver City Comet ran with road transport taking over the service.\\"The Official Last Comet\\" Railway Digest February 1990 page 55 Following their withdrawal in November 1989 the rolling stock was disposed of by auction at Parkes on 22 December 1989.

He is notable for having upheld legal opinions during the Bush administration that narrowly defined torture and authorized enhanced interrogation techniques. These opinions were mostly secret during this period, but rumors of abuse of prisoners were widespread, particularly after the 2004 Abu Ghraib prisoner torture and abuse scandal in Iraq. These opinions were repudiated in 2009 by the Obama administration. Early life, education and career Activities during Bush administration Daniel Levin was appointed to the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) under President George W. Bush. In July 2004, he was appointed Acting Assistant Attorney General and head of the office. On August 6, 2004, he sent a letter to the Central Intelligence Agency advising the CIA that it was lawful to use waterboarding as an interrogation technique. He prepared early drafts of OLC opinions, later signed by Steven G. Bradbury, finding all 13 of the CIA's \\"enhanced interrogation techniques,\\" including waterboarding, to be lawful under the federal torture statute, 28 U.S.C. 2340-2340A. These opinions were issued in the spring of 2005 under the signature of James B. Comey, Deputy Attorney General, although he had objected internally and encouraged the Attorney General Alberto Gonzales in May 2005 to argue against them at a White House meeting. The lawyers were under intense White House pressure to approve these memos. On December 30, 2004, Levin signed an opinion updating OLC's interpretation of the torture statute and replacing an unclassified August 2002 opinion by then Assistant Attorney General Jay S. Bybee. This 2002 opinion had been withdrawn by Jack Goldsmith, head of the OLC from September 2003 to June 2004. ABC News reported in November 2007 that Levin himself had voluntarily undergone waterboarding in 2004 before declaring torture \\"abhorrent\\" and concluding that \\"waterboarding could be illegal torture unless performed in a highly limited way and with close supervision.\\" In September 2004, Levin wrote a letter to the general counsel of the Health and Human Services Department, stating the OLC's opinion that the anti-prostitution pledge could constitutionally be required from all U.S.-based organization receiving federal funds. This requirement was overturned by the Supreme Court in 2013 in the case Agency for International Development v. Alliance for Open Society International, Inc.

The Forth River has its origin directly east of Pelion West at Frog Flats ( above sea level), the lowest point on the whole Overland Track. At its closest point the Overland Track passes within of the mountain summit. Ascending Keith Ernest Lancaster, an early bushwalking and mountain climbing pioneer, climbed Mount Pelion West on 30 January 1946 by enduring a slow and painful crawl through sections of the sharp and prickly Richea scoparia that frequently inhabits alpine areas around Tasmanian mountains. Lancaster referred to Mount Pelion West as one of \\"The Giants of the Reserve\\". In his account of his climb Lancaster mentions \\"the confusion of the enormous boulders\\" on the top of the mountain. On the Achilles Tasmap is marked the approximate location of a walking track to climb the mountain along its northeastern spur. The unmarked track start is approximately east of the Pelion Creek crossing on the Overland Track and is in between two logs that are perpendicular to the Overland Track. This mountain is much more difficult to climb than either Mount Ossa or Mount Pelion East, the more traditional side-excursion climbs along the famous Overland Track.The Overland Track Tasmania Parks & Wildlife Service This is due to a difficult traverse of over across huge dolerite boulders to reach the obelisk shaped, sloping summit boulder.

The three-part serial stars James Nesbitt as Max Raban, a former investigative journalist who discovers an international conspiracy involving government policy groups and death squads. It co-stars Catherine McCormack as Alice Ross, a policy advisor who helps Raban, and Reece Dinsdale as Blake, the head of the death squad. The serial was written by David Kane in response to national paranoia in the wake of the War on Terror. Kane was inspired by the way the films Three Days of the Condor, The Parallax View and The Conversation reflected a post-Vietnam paranoia in the United States. The director David Drury had the predominantly nighttime-set serial filmed in the winter, to maximise the use of darkness and keep down production costs. His inspiration for the look of the serial came from The Godfather, which featured rich colours. Reaction to the serial was generally positive; critics believed the drama was formulaic and uninspired, but appreciated the direction and acting. Nesbitt received a Best Actor nomination at the 2008 ITV3 Crime Thriller Awards.  Plot  Max Raban (played by James Nesbitt) is a former investigative journalist who lost his job when he named a source in a government scandal. The source killed herself and Raban's guilt left him estranged from his wife, Carolyn (played by Zara Turner), and daughter. The guilt manifested itself as phengophobia, a fear of daylight, which Raban seeks to cure by regularly visiting a therapist, Trevor (played by Peter Capaldi), at unsociable hours. To earn money, Raban scours dustbins for celebrity scandals, which he sells to his former editor and best friend whom he has known since university, Jimmy Kerrigan (played by Ian Puleston-Davies). In Part 1, Raban discovers that two Iranian cousins have been murdered. Some investigation links the killings to a policy group called Defence Concern, headed by Daniel Cosgrave (played by Rupert Graves). Raban believes that Defence Concern had something to do with the killings, and recruits Cosgrave's policy advisor Alice Ross (played by Catherine McCormack) to help him uncover the truth. That night, Raban is approached in a cafe by Blake (played by Reece Dinsdale), a member of the death squad Pugnus Dei (\\"God's Fist\\"). Blake tells Raban to keep out of their business. Raban is amused and remains so as Blake makes a telephone call ordering Carolyn's death. As Blake leaves, Raban's smile fades and he runs to Carolyn's house. Part 2 continues directly from Part 1. Raban finds Carolyn lying dead in her front doorway. The police arrive and suspect Raban of killing her. As his daughter is taken away to stay with her aunt, Raban flees the scene. He arranges to meet with Kerrigan to tell him what he has discovered. Ross accesses a confidential file that she downloaded from Cosgrave's computer and discovers the name of one of the Iranian cousins, proving Raban's claim of Defence Concern's role in the killings. She arranges a meeting with him and Raban meets with Kerrigan. Raban is forced to flee again when Kerrigan double-crosses him and brings the death squad to kill him. He arrives at the meeting place and finds Ross submerged in a bathtub. In Part 3, Raban revives Ross and they discuss the implications of Defence Concern's actions. Raban believes that Pugnus Dei is being funded by the Validus Group, an American private equity group and a significant global arms dealer. It is headed by Donald Hagan (played by Alan Dale), a former United States Secretary of Defense. In the denouement, Raban holds Hagan at gunpoint until he realises Hagan's death is what the death squad wanted all along. After Raban leaves, Blake shoots Hagan, hoping the death of such a high-ranking official will start a new War on Terror. Raban, still being tracked by the police, contacts his daughter and asks her to upload the contents of a CD to the Internet. Pugnus Dei's plot is revealed to the public and Raban is reunited with his daughter.  Production  Writer David Kane pitched a story to Carnival Films executive producer Gareth Neame about a former investigative journalist with a fear of daylight who makes a living from raking through celebrity dustbins for scandals to sell to tabloids. During the writing process, Kane happened upon a news item about a group of ex-police, -soldiers and security experts who had set up an organisation to target pro-Islamists. Using this, Kane and Neame introduced the \\"death squad\\" plot. Kane and Neame were influenced by the films Three Days of the Condor, The Parallax View and The Conversation; those films dealt with the paranoia of America brought on by the Vietnam War in the same way Midnight Man dealt with paranoia in Britain following the War in Iraq and the War on Terror.Wood, David (25 April 2008). \\"Shot in the dark\\". Broadcast (Emap Media): pp. 22‚Äì23. The serial was commissioned by ITV1's director of drama Laura Mackie in response to executive chairman Michael Grade's pledge to introduce more contemporary drama to the network.Parker, Robin (22 October 2007). \\"Nesbitt stars in ITV thriller\\". Broadcast (Emap Media). Max Raban was initially based on Benjamin Pell, though the similarity disappeared when the focus on dumpster diving was removed. James Nesbitt was named by Kane and Neame as a potential lead actor early in the planning stages. Neame believed Nesbitt could deliver a \\"dryer, wryer humour\\" compared to his other roles.Dickson, E. Jane (3‚Äì9 May 2008). \\"Of Muck and Men\\". Radio Times (BBC Magazines): pp. 22‚Äì23. Nesbitt had previously been the subject of a tabloid scandal, and researched investigative journalism with a journalist who \\"broke one the biggest political scandals of the Thatcher era\\". As Blake, Reece Dinsdale took the opportunity to play a \\"baddie\\" to put a distance between his previous work, such as playing mild-mannered Rick Johnson in two series of The Chase. He discovered that he had the part 24 hours before his wife, Zara Turner, found out she had been cast as Carolyn Raban. Ian Puleston-Davies researched his role as newspaper editor Jimmy Kerrigan by asking his sister, a former journalist, about her previous editors. Alan Dale read for his part because Nesbitt is one of his favourite actors.Wylie, Ian (22 May 2008). \\"Being headline news\\". Manchester Evening News (M.E.N. media). Filming began the week beginning 22 October 2007.Staff (18 October 2007). \\"ITV1 conspires with Carnival on thriller\\". C21Media.net. Retrieved on 3 August 2008. To keep production costs down, filming took place at a time of year when the nights began earlier, allowing the cast and crew to work half-days instead of all night. Extras and minor characters were drawn from those attending an NFL game taking place at Wembley including a sterling debut performance from the unknown Phillip Wright. The production crew arrived to set up locations in the afternoon and worked with the cast through to 11 p.m. The initial script drafts included 49 separate locations. Director David Drury and producer Alan J. Wands worked through the script and, by merging the settings of some scenes, reduced the locations by a third. Drury scheduled time for the actors to rehearse on location, saying, \\"I'm a great believer in rehearsals to find the characters. I work a specific way, sitting down in 'family groups' with the actors and script and talking about relationships. I go onto the set with just myself and the actors and nobody else, so that they can get to know the space. Only when we are comfortable will I invite the crew in.\\" He did not want to film London as a clich√©, so did not include shots of Big Ben and other major landmarks: \\"I want to give [...] the action a contemporary edge in an environment that was recognisably London without looking film noir.\\" In contrast to other contemporary thrillers that feature the use of hand-held camera, Drury and director of photography Simon Richards used traditional single-camera movement to emulate the style of The Godfather (\\"rich colour and classical style with no trickiness\\"). Unlike other Carnival Films television series such as Hotel Babylon, Midnight Man was not filmed in high-definition; Richards believed that film offered the highest definition for locations that used natural street lighting. Instead of spending part of the budget on a second unit crew, Richards and assistant cameraman Jim Jolliffe filmed establishing shots and pick-ups during principal photography while there was a break. They sometimes stayed behind after the cast and other crew had wrapped in order to shoot scenes of London nightlife.  Reception  Reviewing Part 1 the day after it aired, Tim Teeman of The Times wrote that Midnight Man stretched credibility; \\"If, as the drama insisted, so many people of a certain group and political persuasion had been killed, a newspaper‚Äîmany newspapers‚Äîwould be investigating it.\\" Teeman also expressed dissatisfaction that Midnight Man \\"imput[ed] a kind of bigotry into its audience [that] it didn't have\\", and mocked the portrayal of print journalism.Teeman, Tim (9 May 2008). \\"Midnight Man; Out of the Blue\\". The Times (Times Newspapers). Hermione Eyre of The Independent on Sunday questioned the way exposition was put into a character's mouth, calling it \\"such a badly disguised way of telegraphing information to the audience it's practically postmodern\\", but concluded that Midnight Man \\"promises to be a relaxing sort of series, free from realism or originality\\".Eyre, Hermione (11 May 2008). \\"Flood, ITV; Midnight Man, ITV; Shrink Rap, More 4; Clarissa and the King's Cookbook, BBC4\\".

In The Spectator, Simon Hoggart wrote, \\"I have known many investigative journalists, some of whom have written articles which were extremely discomfiting for the powers that be. Yet not one of them has come home to find their wife with a bullet through her forehead. Not one! The art of thriller writing is to keep one foot in the surreal, the unthinkable and the horrible, and the other firmly in reality. Skip to one side or another and you‚Äôve lost.

The Spectator. Critiquing Part 2, Harry Venning of The Stage felt cheated that Raban had overcome his fear of daylight by simply putting on a pair of sunglasses.

Alison Graham, the television editor for Radio Times, reviewed all three episodes. Part 1 was selected as \\"Pick of the Day\\" for 8 May.

Radio Times (BBC Magazines): p. 98. Reviewing Part 3, Graham described the characters' quirks (Raban's phengophobia, Ross's obsessive-compulsive disorder) as being \\"grafted on\\" in order to flesh them out.

It contains the confessions of eight men who had broken into the tomb of Sobekemsaf II and a description of the reconstruction of the crime. It throws light on the practices followed at ancient Egyptian courts: eliciting confessions by beating with a double rod, smiting their feet and hands, reconstructing the crime on site, and imprisonment of suspects in the gatehouse of a temple.Breasted, op.cit., ¬ß¬ß 540f. The document remains an important document for understanding the importance of burial and the afterlife in ancient Egypt as well as crime and punishment practices in Egypt during the 20th Dynasty.Spencer, p95 Background history Ramesses IX. The grave robbery described in the Amherst-Leopold document came during the 20th Dynasty of ancient Egypt and \\"a background of economic trouble and incipient national disunity.\\"Ikram and Dodson p62 This was a difficult time for Egypt and one that certainly was not prosperous. Egypt was no longer able to control its foreign territories and lost them, whilst foreign powers, such as Libya, would trouble Egypt with raids into Egyptian territories. During this period regional leaders, foreign dignitaries and administrative representatives found themselves with more power as Pharaohs attempted to control civil order.Grandet, Twentieth Dynasty Civil order and administrative power was at a low, whilst economic conditions in Egypt had faltered due to inflation: \\"in the late Twentieth Dynasty, a period for which we have a wealth of documentary evidence about tomb-robbing, the practice was clearly encouraged by economic factors.\\"Spencer, p77Peden, Ramesses IX As such tomb-robbing became a lucrative and more appealing way to get riches during a weak period of ancient Egypt. \\"Intact burials are frequently very poor ones, the ancient plunderers having known well that they were not worth the trouble of investigation.\\"Spencer, p74 Tomb-robbing was a common feature in the Ancient World, and was very common in Egypt in particular: ‚Äúit is a sad fact that the vast majority of ancient Egyptian tombs have been plundered in antiquity.‚Äù Efforts had been made in the past to discourage tomb-robbers, but it only served to increase their ingenuity and craft. At first the coffins themselves were made harder to open, and went from being made out of wood to stone, whilst entrances were sealed in a way to make it difficult for robbers to enter, secret burial chambers were then used to hide the bodies. Despite all the measures to stop these robbers, the lure of potential treasures during the hard times can be seen to have led to robberies like those described in the Amherst-Leopold Papyrus.Spencer, p79-80 Content The symbol for impalement. The actual content of the papyrus is concerned with the confessions of the perpetrators on the crime committed as well as the punishment handed out to them. The tomb that was robbed belonged to Sobekemsaf II and the crimes dated to Year 13 of Ramesses IX. Amenpnufer is shown as the main player in the robbery, and in his trial we are told that the amount of gold found in the pyramid came to 32 lbs.Cottrell, p135 The robbery was not just limited to Sobekemsaf; \\"we also found the royal wife and collected all that we found on her. We took objects of gold, silver, bronze, and divided them amongst us.\\"Ikram and Dodson, p63 Whilst the perpetrators admitted to committing the crimes, we know that crime and punishment during the time was not so fair or comfortable: \\"the robbers brought before investigators of the Twentieth Dynasty were questioned about their activities and witnesses were called to confirm or contradict their stories. Both the accused and the witnesses were beaten as an aid to their memories.\\"Spencer, p98 Knowing this, it becomes harder to really judge whether those accused really were responsible for committing the crimes, although the description of the event would point towards the guilt of the accused: \\"We stripped off the gold, which we found on the august mummy of this god, and its amulets and ornaments which were at its throat, and the coverings wherein it rested.\\"Breasted, p537 The punishment we are given as listed is that of impalement, a punishment used for the most serious of crimes: \\"the punishment for violating a royal tomb: impalement.\\"Ikram and Dodson p63 Modern history of the papyrus Lord Amherst of Hackney. The Amherst-Leopold Papyrus is split in two halves: the lower half of the papyrus was bought in Egypt by Lord Amherst of Hackney in the middle of the 19th century, and sold to John Pierpont Morgan in 1913. In 1935 the missing upper part was found by the Belgian Egyptologist Jean Capart in the Mus√©es Royaux d'Art et d'Histoire at Brussels,Mus√©es Royaux d'Art et d'Histoire / Koninklijke Musea voor Kunst en Geschiedenis Catalog number E.06857 and given the name Leopold II papyrus. This fragment had been hidden inside a wooden statuette which had been acquired by the future Belgian king Leopold II during one of his visits to Egypt in 1854 or 1862. As such efforts in coordinating the documentation and understanding of the Amherst-Leopold Papyrus have been difficult, unlike similar documents such as the Abbot Papyrus.James, op. cit., pp. 44f. Historical importance The Amherst- Leopold Papyrus is of great importance in helping understand the culture of ancient Egypt \\"and give[s] us more detail than we could ever have recovered from purely archaeological evidence.\\" The document shows us the prevalence of tomb-robbing in ancient Egypt and the rewards it offered, and demonstrates why people would perform the difficult and dangerous act of robbing a tomb. The punishments given for the crime itself also can be seen to be important, the harshness of impalement shows that tomb-robbing was taken very seriously. This suggests that the authorities either wanted to prevent future robberies by giving such harsh punishments and deter future tomb-robbers (even though it had not deterred those in the past), or it might show the importance of death and the afterlife in ancient Egypt. The acts in robbing tombs, such as taking away funerary gifts and destroying coffins or even the bodies of the deceased, was thought to endanger their passage into the afterlife, and could be the reason for using such a violent and painful punishment. What we do know for sure is that this source is an interesting view into Egyptian culture and administration, giving us an idea of what life and the practices of ancient Egyptians were like.

Most Palestinians consider the fedayeen to be \\"freedom fighters\\", while most Israelis consider them to be \\"terrorists\\". Considered symbols of the Palestinian national movement, the Palestinian fedayeen drew inspiration from guerrilla movements in Vietnam, China, Algeria and Latin America. The ideology of the Palestinian fedayeen was mainly left-wing nationalist, socialist or communist, and their proclaimed purpose was to defeat Zionism, claim Palestine and establish it as \\"a secular, democratic, nonsectarian state\\". The meaning of secular, democratic and non-sectarian, however, greatly diverged among fedayeen factions. Emerging from among the Palestinian refugees who fled or were expelled from their villages as a result of the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War,Almog, 2003, p. 20. in the mid-1950s the fedayeen began mounting cross-border operations into Israel from Syria, Egypt and Jordan. The earliest infiltrations were often to access the land's agricultural products they had lost as a result of the war, or to attack Israeli military, and sometimes civilian targets. The Gaza Strip, the sole territory of the All-Palestine Protectorate‚Äîa Palestinian state declared in October 1948‚Äîbecame the focal point of the Palestinian fedayeen activity.Facts On File, Incorporated. Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East. Fedayeen attacks were directed on Gaza and Sinai borders with Israel, and as a result Israel undertook retaliatory actions, targeting the fedayeen that also often targeted the citizens of their host countries, which in turn provoked more attacks. Fedayeen actions were cited by Israel as one of the reasons for its launching of the Sinai Campaign of 1956, the 1967 War, and the 1978 and 1982 invasions of Lebanon. Palestinian fedayeen groups were united under the umbrella the Palestine Liberation Organization after the defeat of the Arab armies in the 1967 Six-Day War, though each group retained its own leader and independent armed forces. Definitions of the term Popular Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PDFLP) in Lebanon The words \\"Palestinian\\" and \\"fedayeen\\" have had different meanings to different people at various points in history. According to the Sakhr Arabic-English dictionary, fida'i‚Äîthe singular form of the plural fedayeen‚Äîmeans \\"one who risks his life voluntarily\\" or \\"one who sacrifices himself\\". In their book, The Arab-Israeli Conflict, Tony Rea and John Wright have adopted this more literal translation, translating the term fedayeen as \\"self-sacrificers\\". In his essay, \\"The Palestinian Leadership and the American Media: Changing Images, Conflicting Results\\" (1995), R.S. Zaharna comments on the perceptions and use of the terms \\"Palestinian\\" and \\"fedayeen\\" in the 1970s, writing: > Palestinian became synonymous with terrorists, skyjackers, commandos, and > guerrillas. The term fedayeen was often used but rarely translated. This > added to the mysteriousness of Palestinian groups. Fedayeen means \\"freedom > fighter.\\" Mohammed al-Nawaway uses Zaharna translation of fedayeen as > \\"freedom fighters\\" in his book The Israeli-Egyptian Peace Process in the > Reporting of Western Journalists (2002). Edmund Jan Osma≈Ñczyk's Encyclopedia of the United Nations and International Agreements (2002) defines fedayeen as \\"Palestinian resistance fighters\\", whereas Martin Gilbert's The Routledge Atlas of the Arab-Israeli Conflict (2005) defines fedayeen as \\"Palestinian terrorist groups\\". Robert McNamara refers to the fedayeen simply as \\"guerrillas\\", as do Zeev Schiff and Raphael Rothstein in their work Fedayeen: Guerrillas Against Israel (1972). Fedayeen can also be used to refer to militant or guerrilla groups that are not Palestinian. (See Fedayeen for more.) Beverly Milton-Edwards describes the Palestinian fedayeen as \\"modern revolutionaries fighting for national liberation, not religious salvation,\\" distinguishing them from mujahaddin (i.e. \\"fighters of the jihad\\"). While the fallen soldiers of both mujahaddin and fedayeen are called shahid (i.e. \\"martyrs\\") by Palestinians, Milton nevertheless contends that it would be political and religious blasphemy to call the \\"leftist fighters\\" of the fedayeen. History =1948 to 1956= Palestinian immigration into Israel first emerged among the Palestinian refugees of the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, living in camps in Jordan (including the Jordanian-occupied West Bank), Lebanon, Egypt (including the Egyptian protectorate in Gaza), and Syria. Initially, most infiltrations were economic in nature, with Palestinians crossing the border seeking food or the recovery of property lost in the 1948 war. Between 1948 and 1955, immigration by Palestinians into Israel was opposed by Arab governments,\\"There is strong evidence from Arab, British, American, UN and even Israeli sources to suggest that for the first six years after the [1948] war, the Arab governments were opposed to infiltration and tried to curb it...The Lebanese...effectively sealed the border with Israel. The Syrian authorities also exercised strict control over their border with Israel, and infiltration was rarer. The Egyptian authorities...pursued a consistent policy of curbing infiltration until 1955...Secret Jordanian documents captured by the Israeli army during the June 1967 war...reveal strenuous efforts on the part of the Jordanian military and civilian authorities...to keep [infiltrators] from crossing [the Israeli border].\\" ‚Äì Shlaim, The Iron Wall pp. 84‚Äì85, As an Israel Foreign Ministry official stated: For years the army [i.e. IDF] has been informing the Ministry and the outside world that infiltration is being sponsored, inspired, guided, or at least utilised by the Legion or other powers that be. However...when [we] asked [the army for] ...some clear documentary proof of the [Arabs] Legion's complicity [in the infiltrations]...no clear answer came from the army. Finally Fati [i.e. deputy DMI Yehoshafat Harbaki] told Leo [Savir, senior Foreign Ministry official] and myself, on two separate occasions, that no proof could be given because no proof existed. Furthermore, Fati told me that having personally made a detail study of infiltration, he had arrived at the conclusion that Jordanians and especially the Legion were doing their best to prevent infiltration, which was a natural decentralised and sporadic movement. In fact, listening to Fati or his colleagues these days, one could almost mistake them for British Foreign Office [which consistently argued in this vein].\\" Benny Morris (1993) Israel's Border Wars, 1949‚Äì1956: Arab Infiltration, Israeli Retaliation, and the Countdown to the Suez War Oxford University Press, P 67 in order to prevent escalation into another war. The problem of establishing and guarding the demarcation line separating the Gaza Strip from the Israeli-held Negev area proved vexing, largely due to the presence of over 200,000 Palestinian Arab refugees in this Gaza area.UN Doc S/1459 of 20 February 1950 a report on the activities of the Mixed Armistice Commissions The terms of the Armistice Agreement restricted Egypt's use and deployment of regular armed forces in the Gaza strip. In keeping with this restriction, the Egyptian Government's solution was to form a Palestinian para-military police force. The Palestinian Border police was created in December 1952. The Border police were placed under the command of 'Abd-al-Man'imi 'Abd-al-Ra'uf, a former Egyptian air brigade commander, member of the Muslim Brotherhood and member of the Revolutionary Council. 250 Palestinian volunteers started training in March 1953, with further volunteers coming forward for training in May and December 1953. Some Border police personnel were attached to the Military Governor's office, under 'Abd-al-'Azim al-Saharti, to guard public installations in the Gaza strip.Yezid Sayigh (1999) Armed Struggle and the Search for State: The Palestinian National Movement 1949‚Äì1993. Oxford University Press p 61 After an Israeli raid on an Egyptian military outpost in Gaza in February 1955, during which 37 Egyptian soldiers were killed, the Egyptian government began to actively sponsor fedayeen raids into Israel.\\"Records show that until the Gaza raid, the Egyptian military authorities had a consistent and firm policy of curbing infiltration...into Israel...and that it was only following the raid that a new policy was put in place, that of organizing the fedayeen units and turning them into an official instrument of warfare against Israel.\\" ‚Äì Shlaim, pp. 128‚Äì129. However, official policy and actual actions were not always consistent ‚Äì whether due to incompetence or deliberately turning a blind eye to Palestinian actions, both in Jordan and in Egypt. In fact, during this period there were some 7,850 infiltrations and border incidents on the Jordanian border (including incidents in which Jordanian troops sniped into Israeli areas, conducted intelligence forays or, in one case tried to block the Israeli road leading to the southern Israeli town of Eilat) ‚Äì how many of these actions by Jordanian troops were local initiatives and how many were officially sanctioned is not clear. On the Egyptian border there were in this period approximately 3,000 infiltrations and incidents, the vast majority along the Gaza section of that border. These too were virtually all Palestinian in origin, but also included an undetermined number of shooting incidents initiated by Egyptian troops ‚Äì usually against Israeli border patrols. Carta's Atlas of Israel Volume 2: The First Years 1948‚Äì1961 (Hebrew) The first struggle by Palestinian fedayeen may have been launched from Syrian territory in 1951, though most counterattacks between 1951 and 1953 were launched from Jordanian territory. According to Yeshoshfat Harkabi (former head of Israeli military intelligence), these early infiltrations were limited \\"incursions\\", initially motivated by economic reasons, such as Palestinians crossing the border into Israel to harvest crops in their former villages. Gradually, they developed into violent robbery and deliberate 'terrorist' attacks as fedayeen replaced the 'innocent' refugees as the perpetrators. In 1953, Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion tasked Ariel Sharon, then security chief of the Northern Region, with setting up of a new commando unit, Unit 101, designed to respond to fedayeen infiltrations (see retribution operations). After one month of training, \\"a patrol of the unit that infiltrated into the Gaza Strip as an exercise, encountered Palestinians in al-Bureij refugee camp, opened fire to rescue itself and left behind about 30 killed Arabs and dozens of wounded.\\"Yoav Gelber, 2006, \\"Sharon's Inheritance\\" In its five-month existence, Unit 101 was also responsible for carrying out the Qibya massacre on the night of 14‚Äì15 October 1953, in the Jordanian village of the same name. Cross-border operations by Israel were conducted in both Egypt and Jordan \\"to 'teach' the Arab leaders that the Israeli government saw them as responsible for these activities, even if they had not directly conducted them.\\" Moshe Dayan felt that retaliatory action by Israel was the only way to convince Arab countries that, for the safety of their own citizens, they should work to stop fedayeen infiltrations. Dayan stated, \\"We are not able to protect every man, but we can prove that the price for Jewish blood is high.\\" According to Martin Gilbert, between 1951 and 1955, 967 Israelis were killed in what he claims as \\"Arab terrorist attacks\\", a figure Benny Morris characterizes as \\"pure nonsense\\". Morris explains that Gilbert's fatality figures are \\"3-5 times higher than the figures given in contemporary Israeli reports\\" and that they seem to be based on a 1956 speech by David Ben- Gurion in which he uses the word nifga'im to refer to \\"casualties\\" in the broad sense of the term (i.e. both dead and wounded). According to the Jewish Agency for Israel between 1951 and 1956, 400 Israelis were killed and 900 wounded in fedayeen attacks. Dozens of these attacks are today cited by the Israeli government as \\"Major Arab Terrorist Attacks against Israelis prior to the 1967 Six-Day War\\". According to the Jewish Virtual Library, while the attacks violated the 1949 Armistice Agreements prohibiting hostilities by paramilitary forces, it was Israel that was condemned by the United Nations Security Council for its counterattacks. United Nations reports indicate that between 1949 and 1956, Israel launched more than seventeen raids on Egyptian territory and 31 attacks on Arab towns or military forces. From late 1954 onwards, larger scale Fedayeen operations were mounted from Egyptian territory. The Egyptian government supervised the establishment of formal fedayeen groups in Gaza and the northeastern Sinai. General Mustafa Hafez, commander of Egyptian army intelligence, is said to have founded Palestinian fedayeen units \\"to launch terrorist raids across Israel's southern border,\\" nearly always against civilians. In a speech on 31 August 1955, Egyptian President Nasser said: :Egypt has decided to dispatch her heroes, the disciples of Pharaoh and the sons of Islam and they will cleanse the land of Palestine....There will be no peace on Israel's border because we demand vengeance, and vengeance is Israel's death. In 1955, it is reported that 260 Israeli citizens were killed or wounded by the fedayeen. Some believe fedayeen attacks contributed to the outbreak of the Suez Crisis; they were cited by Israel as the reason for undertaking the 1956 Sinai Campaign. Others argue that Israel \\"engineered eve-of-war lies and deceptions.... to give Israel the excuse needed to launch its strike\\", such as presenting a group of \\"captured fedayeen\\" to journalists, who were in fact Israeli soldiers. In 1956, Israeli troops entered Khan Yunis in the Egyptian controlled Gaza Strip, conducting house-to-house searches for Palestinian fedayeen and weaponry. During this operation, 275 Palestinians were killed, with an additional 111 killed in Israeli raids on the Rafah refugee camp. Israel claimed these killings resulted from \\"refugee resistance\\", a claim denied by refugees; there were no Israeli casualties. =Suez Crisis= Israeli policemen inspecting the bodies of 5 fedayeen killed near Nir Galim, 1956 On 29 October 1956, the first day of Israel's invasion of the Sinai Peninsula, Israeli forces attacked \\"fedayeen units\\" in the towns of Ras al-Naqb and Kuntilla. Two days later, fedayeen destroyed water pipelines in Kibbutz Ma'ayan along the Lebanese border, and began a campaign of mining in the area which lasted throughout November. In the first week of November, similar attacks occurred along the Syrian and Jordanian borders, the Jerusalem corridor and in the Wadi Ara region‚Äîalthough the state armies of both those countries are suspected as the saboteurs. On 9 November, four Israeli soldiers were injured after their vehicle was ambushed by fedayeen near the city of Ramla; and several water pipelines and bridges were sabotaged in the Negev. During the invasion of Sinai, Israeli forces killed fifty defenseless fedayeen on a lorry in Ras Sudar. (Reserve Lieutenant Colonel Saul Ziv told Maariv in 1995 he was haunted by this killing.) After Israel took control of the Gaza Strip, dozens of fedayeen were summarily executed, mostly in two separate incidents. Sixty-six were killed in screening operations in the area; while a US diplomat estimated that of the 500 fedayeen captured by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), \\"about 30\\" were killed. =1956 to 1967= Between the 1956 war and the 1967 war, Israeli civilian and military casualties on all Arab fronts, inflicted by regular and irregular forces (including those of Palestinian fedayeen), averaged one per month ‚Äî an estimated total of 132 fatalities. During the mid and late 1960s, there emerged a number of independent Palestinian fedayeen groups who sought \\"the liberation of all Palestine through a Palestinian armed struggle.\\" The first incursion by these fedayeen may have been the 1 January 1965 commando infiltration into Israel, to plant explosives that destroyed a section of pipeline designed to divert water from the Jordan River into Israel. In 1966, the Israeli military attacked the Jordanian-controlled West Bank village of Samu, in response to Fatah raids against Israel's eastern border, increasing tensions leading to the Six-Day War. =1967 to 1987= A Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine patrol unit in Jordan, 1969 Fedayeen groups began joining the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in 1968. While the PLO was the \\"unifying framework\\" under which these groups operated, each fedayeen organization had its own leader and armed forces and retained autonomy in operations. Of the dozen or so fedayeen groups under the PLO framework, the most important were the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) headed by George Habash, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) headed by Nayef Hawatmeh, the PFLP-General Command headed by Ahmed Jibril, as-Sa'iqa (affiliated with Syria), and the Arab Liberation Front (backed by Iraq). The most severe act of sabotage of the fedayeen occurred on 4 July 1969, when a single militant placed three pounds of explosives under the manifold of eight pipelines carrying oil from the Haifa refinery to the dockside. As a result of the explosion, three pipelines were temporarily out of commission and a fire destroyed over 1,500 tons of refined oil. West Bank In the late 1960s, attempts were made to organize fedayeen resistance cells among the refugee population in the West Bank. The stony and empty terrain of the West Bank mountains made the fedayeen easy to spot; and Israeli collective punishment against the families of fighters resulted in the fedayeen being pushed out of the West Bank altogether, within a few months. Yasser Arafat reportedly escaped arrest in Ramallah by jumping out a window, as Israeli police came in the front door. Without a base in the West Bank, and prevented from operating in Syria and Egypt, the fedayeen concentrated in Jordan. Jordan After the influx of a second wave of Palestinian refugees from the 1967 war, fedayeen bases in Jordan began to proliferate, and there were increased fedayeen attacks on Israel. Fedayeen fighters launched ineffective bazooka-shelling attacks on Israeli targets across the Jordan River, while \\"brisk and indiscriminate\\" Israeli retaliations destroyed Jordanian villages, farms and installations, causing 100,000 people to flee the Jordan Valley eastward. The increasing ferocity of those Israeli reprisals directed at Jordanians (not Palestinians) for fedayeen raids into Israel became a growing cause of concern for the Jordanian authorities. One such Israeli reprisal was in the Jordanian town of Karameh, home to the headquarters of an emerging fedayeen group called Fatah, led by Yasser Arafat. Warned of large-scale Israeli military preparations, many fedayeen groups, including the PFLP and the DFLP, withdraw their forces from the town. Advised by a pro-Fatah Jordanian divisional commander to withdraw his men and headquarters to nearby hills, Arafat refused, stating \\"We want to convince the world that there are those in the Arab world who will not withdraw or flee.\\" Fatah remained, and the Jordanian Army agreed to back them if heavy fighting ensued. On the night of 21 March 1968, Israel attacked Karameh with heavy weaponry, armored vehicles and fighter jets. Fatah held its ground, surprising the Israeli military. As Israel's forces intensified their campaign, the Jordanian Army became involved, causing the Israelis to retreat in order to avoid a full-scale war. By the battle's end, 100 Fatah militants had been killed, 100 wounded and 120-150 captured; Jordanian fatalities were 61 soldiers and civilians, 108 wounded; and Israeli casualties were 28 soldiers killed and 69 wounded. 13 Jordanian tanks were destroyed in the battle; while the Israelis lost 4 tanks, 3 half tracks, 2 armoured cars, and an airplane shot down by Jordanian forces. The Battle of Karameh raised the profile of the fedayeen, as they were regarded the \\"daring heroes of the Arab world\\". Despite the higher Arab death toll, Fatah considered the battle a victory because of the Israeli army's rapid withdrawal. Such developments prompted Rashid Khalidi to dub the Battle of Karameh the \\"foundation myth\\" of the Palestinian commando movement, whereby \\"failure against overwhelming odds [was] brilliantly narrated as [an] heroic triumph.\\" Yasser Arafat (leader of Fatah) and Nayef Hawatmeh (leader of DFLP) at an Amman press conference discussing the situation between the fedayeen and Jordanian authorities, 1970 Financial donations and recruitment increased as many young Arabs, including thousands of non-Palestinians, joined the ranks of the organization. The ruling Hashemite authorities in Jordan grew increasingly alarmed by the PLO's activities, as they established a \\"state within a state\\", providing military training and social welfare services to the Palestinian population, bypassing the Jordanian authorities. Palestinian criticism of the poor performance of the Arab Legion (the King's army) was an insult to both the King and the regime. Further, many Palestinian fedayeen groups of the radical left, such as the PFLP, \\"called for the overthrow of the Arab monarchies, including the Hashemite regime in Jordan, arguing that this was an essential first step toward the liberation of Palestine.\\" In the first week of September 1970, PFLP forces hijacked three airplanes (British, Swiss and German) at Dawson's field in Jordan. To secure the release of the passengers, the demand to free PFLP militants held in European jails was met. After everyone had disembarked, the fedayeen destroyed the airplanes on the tarmac.  Black September in Jordan  On 16 September 1970, King Hussein ordered his troops to strike and eliminate the fedayeen network in Jordan. Syrian troops intervened to support the fedayeen, but were turned back by Jordanian armour and Israeli army overflights. Thousands of Palestinians were killed in the initial battle ‚Äî which came to be known as Black September ‚Äî and thousands more in the security crackdown that followed. By the summer of 1971, the Palestinian fedayeen network in Jordan had been effectively dismantled, with most of the fighters setting up base in southern Lebanon instead. Gaza Strip The emergence of a fedayeen movement in the Gaza Strip was catalyzed by Israel's occupation of the territory during the 1967 war. Palestinian fedayeen from Gaza \\"waged a mini-war\\" against Israel for three years before the movement was crushed by the Israeli military in 1971 under the orders of then Defense Minister, Ariel Sharon. Palestinians in Gaza were proud of their role in establishing a fedayeen movement there when no such movement existed in the West Bank at the time. The fighters were housed in refugee camps or hid in the citrus groves of wealthy Gazan landowners, carrying out raids against Israeli soldiers from these sites. The most active of the fedayeen groups in Gaza was the PFLP, an offshoot of the Arab Nationalist Movement (ANM)‚Äîwho enjoyed instant popularity among the already secularized, socialist population who had come of age during Egyptian President Nasser's rule of Gaza. The emergence of armed struggle as the liberation strategy for the Gaza Strip reflected larger ideological changes within the Palestinian national movement toward political violence. > The ideology of armed struggle was, by this time, broadly secular in > content; Palestinians were asked to take up arms not as part of a jihad > against the infidel but to free the oppressed from the Zionist colonial > regime. The vocabulary of liberation was distinctly secular. The \\"radical left\\" dominated the political scene, and the overarching slogan of the time was, \\"We will liberate Palestine first, then the rest of the Arab world.\\" During Israel's 1971 military campaign to contain or control the fedayeen, an estimated 15,000 suspected fighters were rounded up and deported to detention camps in Abu Zneima and Abu Rudeis in the Sinai. Dozens of homes were demolished by Israeli forces, rendering hundreds of people homeless. According to Milton-Edwards, \\"This security policy successfully instilled terror in the camps and wiped out the fedayeen bases.\\" The destruction of the secular infrastructure, paved the way for the rise of the Islamic movement, which began organizing as early as 1969‚Äì1970, led by Sheikh Ahmed Yassin. Lebanon On 3 November 1969, the Lebanese government signed the Cairo Agreement which granted Palestinians the right to launch attacks on Israel from southern Lebanon in coordination with the Lebanese Army. After the expulsion of the Palestinian fedayeen from Jordan and a series of Israeli raids on Lebanon, the Lebanese government granted the PLO the right to defend Palestinian refugee camps there and to possess heavy weaponry. After the outbreak of 1975 Lebanese Civil War, the PLO increasingly began to act once again as a \\"state within a state\\". On 11 March 1978, twelve fedayeen led by Dalal Mughrabi infiltrated Israel from the sea and hijacked a bus along the coastal highway, killing 38 civilians in the ensuing gunfight between them and police. Israel invaded southern Lebanon in the 1978 Israel-Lebanon conflict, occupying a wide area there to put an end to Palestinian attacks on Israel, but fedayeen rocket strikes on northern Israel continued. Israeli armoured artillery and infantry forces, supported by air force and naval units again entered Lebanon on 6 June 1982 in an operation code-named \\"Peace for Galilee\\", encountering \\"fierce resistance\\" from the Palestinian fedayeen there. Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon and its siege and constant shelling of the capital Beirut in the 1982 Lebanon War, eventually forced the Palestinian fedayeen to accept an internationally brokered agreement that moved them out of Lebanon to different places in the Arab world. The headquarters of the PLO was moved out of Lebanon to Tunis at this time. The new PLO headquarters was destroyed during an Israeli airstrike in 1985. During a September 2, 1982 press conference at the United Nations, Yasser Arafat stated that, \\"Jesus Christ was the first Palestinian fedayeen who carried his sword along the path on which the Palestinians today carry their cross.\\" =First Intifada= On 25 November 1987, PFLP-GC launched an attack, in which two fedayeen infiltrated northern Israel from an undisclosed Syrian-controlled area in southern Lebanon with hang gliders. One of them was killed at the border, while the other proceeded to land at an army camp, initially killing a soldier in a passing vehicle, then five more in the camp, before being shot dead. Thomas Friedman said that judging by commentary in the Arab world, the raid was seen as a boost to the Palestinian national movement, just as it had seemed to be almost totally eclipsed by the Iran‚ÄìIraq War.Friedman, Thomas L. \\"Syria-Based Group Says It Staged Israel Raid\\", New York Times, 1987-11-27. Palestinians in Gaza began taunting Israeli soldiers, chanting \\"six to one\\" and the raid has been noted as a catalyst to the First Intifada. During the First Intifada, armed violence on the part of Palestinians was kept to a minimum, in favor of mass demonstrations and acts of civil disobedience. However, the issue of the role of armed struggle did not die out altogether. Those Palestinian groups affiliated with the PLO and based outside of historic Palestine, such as rebels within Fatah and the PFLP-GC, used the lack of fedayeen operations as their main weapon of criticism against the PLO leadership at the time. The PFLP and DFLP even made a few abortive attempts at fedayeen operations inside Israel. According to Jamal Raji Nassar and Roger Heacock, > [...] at least parts of the Palestinian left sacrificed all to the golden > calf of armed struggle when measuring the degree of revolutionary commitment > by the number of fedayeen operations, instead of focusing on the positions > of power they doubtless held inside the Occupied Territories and which were > major assets in struggles over a particular political line. During the First Intifada, but particularly after the signing of the Oslo Accords, the fedayeen steadily lost ground to the emerging forces of the mujahaddin, represented initially and most prominently by Hamas. The fedayeen lost their position as a political force and the secular nationalist movement that had represented the first generation of the Palestinian resistance became instead a symbolic, cultural force that was seen by some as having failed in its duties. =Second Intifada and current situation= After being dormant for many years, Palestinian fedayeen reactivated their operations during the Second Intifada. In August 2001, ten Palestinian commandos from the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) penetrated the electric fences of the fortified army base of Bedolah, killing an Israeli major and two soldiers and wounding seven others. One of the commandos was killed in the firefight. Another was tracked for hours and later shot in head, while the rest escaped. In Gaza, the attack produced \\"a sense of euphoria‚Äîand nostalgia for the Palestinian fedayeen raids in the early days of the Jewish state.\\" Israel responded by launching airstrikes at the police headquarters in Gaza City, an intelligence building in the central Gaza town of Deir al-Balah and a police building in the West Bank town of Salfit. Salah Zeidan, head of the DFLP in Gaza, stated of the operation that, \\"It's a classic model‚Äîsoldier to soldier, gun to gun, face to face [...] Our technical expertise has increased in recent days. So has our courage, and people are going to see that this is a better way to resist the occupation than suicide bombs inside the Jewish state.\\" Today, the fedayeen have been eclipsed politically by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), which consists of the major factions of the PLO, and militarily by Islamist groups, particularly Hamas. Already strained relations between Hamas and the PNA collapsed entirely when the former took over the Gaza Strip in 2007. Although the fedayeen are leftist and secular, during the most recent hostilities between Israel and the Gaza Strip, fedayeen groups fought alongside and in coordination with Hamas even though a number of the factions were previously sworn enemies of them. The al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, an armed faction loyal to the Fatah-controlled PNA, undermined Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas by lobbing rockets into southern Israel in concert with rivals Hamas and the Islamic Jihad. According to researcher Maha Azzam, this symbolized the disintegration of Fatah and the division between the grassroots organization and the current leadership. The PFLP and the Popular Resistance Committees also joined in the fighting. To rival the PNA and increase Palestinian fedayeen cooperation, a Damascus-based coalition composed of representatives of Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the PFLP, as-Sa'iqa, the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front, the Revolutionary Communist Party, and other anti-PNA factions within the PLO, such as Fatah al-Intifada, was established during the Gaza War in 2009.Bauer, Shane Palestinian factions united by war , Al-Jazeera English. 2009-01-20. Philosophical grounding and objectives The objectives of the fedayeen were articulated in the statements and literature they produced, which were consistent with reference to the aim of destroying Zionism. In 1970, the stated aim of the fedayeen was establishing Palestine as \\"a secular, democratic, nonsectarian state.\\" Bard O'Neill writes that for some fedayeen groups, the secular aspect of the struggle was \\"merely a slogan for assuaging world opinion,\\" while others strove \\"to give the concept meaningful content.\\" Prior to 1974, the fedayeen position was that Jews who renounced Zionism could remain in the Palestinian state to be created. After 1974, the issue became less clear and there were suggestions that only those Jews who were in Palestine prior to \\"the Zionist invasion\\", alternatively placed at 1947 or 1917, would be able to remain. Bard O'Neill also wrote that the fedayeen attempted to study and borrow from all of the revolutionary models available, but that their publications and statements show a particular affinity for the Cuban, Algerian, Vietnamese, and Chinese experiences. =Infighting and breakaway movements= During the post-Six-Day War era, individual fedayeen movements quarreled over issues about the recognition of Israel, alliances with various Arab states, and ideologies. A faction led by Nayef Hawatmeh and Yasser Abed Rabbo split from PFLP in 1974, because they preferred a Maoist and non-Nasserist approach. This new movement became known as the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP).Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine Arab Gateway to Palestinian Organizations. In 1974, the PNC approved the Ten Point Program (drawn up by Arafat and his advisers), and proposed a compromise with the Israelis. The Program called for a Palestinian national authority over every part of \\"liberated Palestinian territory\\", which referred to areas captured by Arab forces in the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War (present-day West Bank and Gaza Strip). Perceived by some Palestinians as overtures to the United States and concessions to Israel, the program fostered internal discontent, and prompted several of the PLO factions, such as the PFLP, DFLP, as-Sa'iqa, the Arab Liberation Front and the Palestine Liberation Front, among others, to form a breakaway movement which came to be known as the Rejectionist Front. During the Lebanese Civil War (1975‚Äì1990), the PLO aligned itself with the Communist and Nasserist Lebanese National Movement. Although they were initially backed by Syrian president Hafez al-Assad, when he switched sides in the conflict, the smaller pro-Syrian factions within the Palestinian fedayeen camp, namely as-Sa'iqa and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command fought against Arafat's Fatah-led PLO. In 1988, after Arafat and al- Assad partially reconciled, Arafat loyalists in the refugee camps of Bourj al- Barajneh and Shatila attempted to force out Fatah al-Intifada‚Äîa pro-Syrian Fatah breakaway movement formed by Said al-Muragha in 1983. Instead, al- Muragha's forces overran Arafat loyalists from both camps after bitter fighting in which Fatah al-Intifada received backing from the Lebanese Amal militia. The PLO and other Palestinian armed movements became increasingly divided after the Oslo Accords in 1993. They were rejected by the PFLP, DFLP, Hamas, and twenty other factions, as well as Palestinian intellectuals, refugees outside of the Palestinian territories, and the local leadership of the territories. The Rejectionist fedayeen factions formed a common front with the Islamists, culminating in the creation of the Alliance of Palestinian Forces. This new alliance failed to act as a cohesive unit, but revealed the sharp divisions among the PLO, with the fedayeen finding themselves aligning with Palestinian Islamists for the first time. Disintegration within the PLO's main body Fatah increased as Farouk Qaddoumi‚Äîin charge of foreign affairs‚Äîvoiced his opposition to negotiations with Israel. Members of the PLO- Executive Committee, poet Mahmoud Darwish and refugee leader Shafiq al-Hout resigned from their posts in response to the PLO's acceptance of Oslo's terms. =Tactics= Until 1968, fedayeen tactics consisted largely of hit-and-run raids on Israeli military targets. A commitment to \\"armed struggle\\" was incorporated into PLO Charter in clauses that stated: \\"Armed struggle is the only way to liberate Palestine\\" and \\"Commando action constitutes the nucleus of the Palestinian popular liberation war.\\" Preceding the Six-Day War in 1967, the fedayeen carried out several campaigns of sabotage against Israeli infrastructure. Common acts of this included the consistent mining of water and irrigation pipelines along the Jordan River and its tributaries, as well as the Lebanese-Israeli border and in various locations in the Galilee. Other acts of sabotage involved bombing bridges, mining roads, ambushing cars and vandalizing (sometimes destroying) houses. After the Six-Day War, these incidents steadily decreased with the exception of the bombing of a complex of oil pipelines sourcing from the Haifa refinery in 1969. The IDFs counterinsurgency tactics, which from 1967 onwards regularly included the use of home demolitions, curfews, deportations, and other forms of collective punishment, effectively precluded the ability of the Palestinian fedayeen to create internal bases from which to wage \\"a people's war\\". The tendency among many captured guerrillas to collaborate with the Israeli authorities, providing information that led to the destruction of numerous \\"terrorist cells\\", also contributed to the failure to establish bases in the territories occupied by Israel. The fedayeen were compelled to establish external bases, resulting in frictions with their host countries which led to conflicts (such as Black September), diverting them from their primary objective of \\"bleeding Israel\\". Airplane hijackings The tactic of exporting their struggle against Israel beyond the Middle East was first adopted by the Palestinian fedayeen in 1968. According to John Follain, it was Wadie Haddad of the PFLP who, unconvinced with the effectiveness of raids on military targets, masterminded the first hijacking of a civilian passenger plane by Palestinian fedayeen in July 1968. Two commandos forced an El Al Boeing 747 en route from Rome to Tel Aviv to land in Algiers, renaming the flight \\"Palestinian Liberation 007\\". While publicly proclaiming that it would not negotiate with terrorists, the Israelis did negotiate. The passengers were released unharmed in exchange for the release of sixteen Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. The first hijacking of an American airliner was conducted by the PFLP on 29 August 1969. Robert D. Kumamoto describes the hijacking as a response to an American veto of a United Nations Security Council resolution censuring Israel for its March 1969 aerial attacks on Jordanian villages suspected of harbouring fedayeen, and for the impending delivery of American Phantom jets to Israel. The flight, en route to Tel Aviv from Rome, was forced to land in Damascus where, Leila Khaled, one of the two fedayeen to hijack the plane proclaimed that, \\"this hijacking is one of the operational aspects of our war against Zionism and all who support it, including the United States ...[;] it was a perfectly normal thing to do, the sort of thing all freedom fighters must tackle.\\" Most of the passengers and crew were released immediately after the plane landed. Six Israeli passengers were taken hostage and held for questioning by Syria. Four women among them were released after two days, and the two men were released after a week of intensive negotiations between all the parties involved. Of this PFLP hijacking and those that followed at Dawson's field, Kumamoto writes: \\"The PFLP hijackers had seized no armies, mountaintops, or cities. Theirs was not necessarily a war of arms; it was a war of words ‚Äì a war of propaganda, the exploitation of violence to attract world attention. In that regard, the Dawson's Field episode was a publicity goldmine.\\" George Habash, leader of the PFLP, explained his view of the efficacy of hijacking as a tactic in a 1970 interview, stating, \\"When we hijack a plane it has more effect than if we killed a hundred Israelis in battle.\\" Habash also stated that after decades of being ignored, \\"At least the world is talking about us now.\\" The hijacking attempts did indeed continue. On 8 May 1972, a Sabena Airlines 707 was forced to land in Tel Aviv after it was commandeered by four Black September commandos who demanded the release of 317 fedayeen fighters being held in Israeli jails. While the Red Cross was negotiating, Israeli paratroopers disguised as mechanics stormed the plane, shot and killed two of hijackers and captured the remaining two after a gunfight that injured five passengers and two paratroopers. The tactics employed by the Black September group in subsequent operations differed sharply from the other \\"run-of-the-mill PLO attacks of the day\\". The unprecedented level of violence evident in multiple international attacks between 1971 and 1972 included the Sabena airliner hijacking (mentioned above), the assassination of the Jordanian Prime Minister in Cairo, the Massacre at Lod airport, and the Munich Olympics massacre. In The Dynamics of Armed Struggle, J. Bowyer Bell contends that \\"armed struggle\\" is a message to the enemy that they are \\"doomed by history\\" and that operations are \\"violent message units\\" designed to \\"accelerate history\\" to this end. Bell argues that despite the apparent failure of the Munich operation which collapsed into chaos, murder, and gun battles, the basic fedayeen intention was achieved since, \\"The West was appalled and wanted to know the rationale of the terrorists, the Israelis were outraged and punished, many of the Palestinians were encouraged by the visibility and ignored the killings, and the rebels felt that they had acted, helped history along.\\" He notes the opposite was true for the 1976 hijacking of an Air France flight redirected to Uganda where the Israelis scored an \\"enormous tactical victory\\" in Operation Entebbe. While their death as martyrs had been foreseen, the fedayeen had not expected to die as villains, \\"bested by a display of Zionist skill.\\" Affiliations with other guerrilla groups Several fedayeen groups maintained contacts with a number of other guerrilla groups worldwide. The IRA for example had long held ties with Palestinians, and volunteers trained at fedayeen bases in Lebanon. In 1977, Palestinian fedayeen from Fatah helped arrange for the delivery of a sizable arms shipment to the Provos by way of Cyprus, but it was intercepted by the Belgian authorities. The PFLP and the DFLP established connections with revolutionary groups such as the Red Army Faction of West Germany, the Action Directe of France, the Red Brigades of Italy, the Japanese Red Army and the Tupamaros of Uruguay. These groups, especially the Japanese Red Army participated in many of the PFLP's operations including hijackings and the Lod Airport massacre. The Red Army Faction joined the PFLP in the hijackings of two airplanes that landed in Entebbe Airport.

In the space of just over a year RM-39, RM-40 and RM-41 replaced each other in succession. RM-41 remained in production until 1943, when the USSR decided to cease making 50mm mortars. Only the RM-41 was a new design with the others being incremental improvements of the original RM-38. =Design Improvements= The problem of having only two fixed elevations and thus needing to adjust the range with the complex adjustment of gas escape made for inaccurate ranging and was dangerous to the mortar-man as well. The minimum shooting range of 200m was felt to be impractical in Red Army use as well. RM-39 added a protective shield which directed the escaping hot gases away from the operator. Barrels got shorter with each new model. =Variants= *RM39 **Barrel Length: 77.5 cm **Weight: 14 or 17 kg *RM40 **Barrel Length: 63 cm **Weight: 12.1 kg 50mm RM41 Essentially a new design, influenced by German 50mm mortars, which was continued in use until 50mm mortars were removed from Soviet Army service. This mortar was without a tripod but instead relied on its barrel yoke which contained traverse and elevation adjustments. The gases now vented under the muzzle via a tube. Use All models saw widespread use by the USSR in World War II. Captured in large numbers, they were also re-used by the Finns and Germans. After World War II the USSR supplied them to North Korea and Vietnam. The Finns were apparently not impressed with these Russian 50mm mortars, giving them mildly derogatory nicknames - \\"Naku\\" and \\"Tiltu\\", and not being over-zealous about re-issuing them. The Finns found the RM-39 relatively accurate in use and getting the mortar ready to fire took only about one minute. The mortar was no substitute for the 80-82mm mortars however, perhaps due to only having 100g of TNT in the shell, less than some hand grenades.

Morton, was an American character actor.James C. Morton bio at threestooges.net He appeared in 187 films between 1922 and 1943. Career Born in Helena, Montana, Morton is best known to modern audiences as the hapless soul whose toup√©e was often removed at the most inopportune times. Perhaps the best known example of this embarrassment is in the Three Stooges film Disorder in the Court, in which Larry Fine's violin bow yanks Morton's hairpiece off. The Stooges then misinterpret the toup√©e as a wild tarantula, leading Moe Howard to grab a pistol from a court bailiff and shoot it.Disorder in the Court at threestooges.com Another example is in the 1935 Our Gang short Beginner's Luck where Morton is a piano accompanist to the amateur talent in a neighborhood kids' show, and the Rascals‚Äîcausing all kinds of raucous disarray in the front row‚Äîknock off his toup√©e with a gust of air; Morton turns to them saying, \\"You kids are beginning to get into my hair!\\" Morton also appeared as the bartender who provides Oliver Hardy with a wooden mallet to shut up Stan Laurel singing \\"The Trail of the Lonesome Pine\\" in the film Way Out West. Morton appeared in many Hal Roach productions, playing supporting roles with Our Gang and Laurel and Hardy, and also played a small role in Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times. On the Los Angeles stage Morton played the title role of Tik-Tok in The Tik-Tok Man of Oz (1913), by L. Frank Baum, Louis F. Gottschalk, Victor Schertzinger and Oliver Morosco.

Wilson was born in Adelaide, South Australia and educated at Riverton and Whinham College, North Adelaide. He bought a store at Broken Hill, New South Wales in 1898 and he married Lily May Suckling in February 1901. He was elected an alderman of the City of Broken Hill in 1908, but moved to Adelaide in 1909. He was mayor of the Corporate Town of St Peters in 1916 and 1917. Political career Wilson ran unsuccessfully for the South Australian Legislative Assembly seats of Torrens in 1912 and East Torrens in 1918, but was elected to the Australian Senate as a nominee of the Farmers and Settlers' Association to the composite Nationalist Party of Australia ticket at the 1919 election. From 1923 to 1925, he was an honorary minister in the Bruce-Page government with some responsibility for health and immigration. In March 1923, Stanley Bruce put him in charge of organising the Australian pavilion for the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley, London, which was aimed at stimulating immigration to Australia, promoting foreign investment and developing markets for Australian produce. In London, he also sought to negotiate an immigration agreement with the United Kingdom. He later negotiated a reciprocal trade agreement with Canada, which still gives some preferences for cars and car parts. Wilson returned to Australia in June 1924 and was appointed Minister for Markets and Migration in January 1925. Although he had joined the Country Party, he refused to attend its parliamentary meetings and he refused to nominate for its pre-selection at the 1925 election on the basis that pre-selection should be automatic for ministers. As a result, the South Australian Country Party refused to endorse him and, even with Bruce's support, he gained only fourth place on the non-Labor ticket for the Senate and, as a result, failed to be re-elected. Later life Wilson moved to Sydney in the late 1920s. He was president of the Motion Picture Distributors' Association from 1927 to 1939 and was accused of favouring American over Australian and British films. He died in his house in the Sydney suburb of Neutral Bay, survived by two daughters. Honours Wilson was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1926.

It is located on Mortimer Hill on the east side of the town of Tring, Hertfordshire, England. Tring School includes a Sixth Form with over 300 students. The school was founded by the Church of England and is within the Diocesan Board of Education of the St Albans Diocese.  History  In the early 19th century, the only education local children received was from the church-run school of St Peter and St Paul's, which taught around 240 pupils together in the Vestry Hall. However this was insufficient because the school only operated on Sundays and, in the opinion of the Brougham inspectors of 1811 at least, was severely unprovided for in comparison with Long Marston school, which contained only 92 students. Tring National School was founded in 1842 by Church of England Revd Edward I. Randolph, with the assistance of a grant from the National Society, on land granted by the Dean and Chapter of Christ Church, Oxford. At that time it was built on Aylesbury Road in the middle of Tring, where Tring Library now stands. During the First World War, the school building was taken over as a military hospital. In the 1930s the junior and secondary departments were re- organised as separate schools, though still occupying the same building. The junior school would later become Bishop Wood C of E Junior School. In 1956 the senior school, now known as Tring School, moved to its present site at the top of Mortimer Hill, to the east of the town, and in 1969 it was re-organised as an all-ability 11-19 co-educational school. The school converted to academy status in August 2012 and then became part of the Ridgeway Learning Partnership in December 2017.  Academic standards  Following the Ofsted inspection in November 2017, Tring School was rated ‚ÄòGood‚Äô with an ‚ÄòOutstanding‚Äô Sixth Form and ‚ÄòOutstanding‚Äô Personal Development and ‚ÄòOutstanding‚Äô Behaviour. The school was also rated ‚ÄòGood‚Äô under the SIAMS inspection framework in May 2019 with ‚ÄòOutstanding‚Äô Religious Education.  Wider Curriculum  Clubs are led by staff and students alike and the school also hosts clubs run by external providers such as Air Cadets. Increasing in popularity is the Duke of Edinburgh Scheme and World Challenge programmes. Organisation = House system = The students of the school are separated into four houses, namely Ascott, Claydon, Halton and Waddesdon all of which are country houses from the local area, each of which has its own Head of House. They compete annually for a House Cup as well as for other cups and trophies throughout the year with the cup being presented at the end of year assembly. Each house has its own colour: Blue, Red, Green and Yellow respectively. Since September 2009 Tring School's form system has incorporated vertical tutoring, with each tutor group including pupils from the same house across the age range of the school. The previous house system consisted of Ashridge, Beacon, Chiltern, Mentmore, Pendley and Ridgeway. =Layout= Tring School's facilities are about to see a major redevelopment with all buildings, except the Desborough Hall, Beloe Block and the Sports Centre, being replaced. The Sports Centre had a complete refit in 2019 and both the Beloe and Desborough buildings will be refurbished to match the new build.  Relations with other schools  Tring School is part of the Ridgeway Learning Partnership which also includes Grove Road Primary School. Tring School has transition links with other local primary schools.

The investigation and trial of the perpetrators, house painter Rainer K√∂rppen and his son Sven K√∂rppen, produced substantial public and media attention,See e.g. including TV documentaries. In the 2000s, it also spawned a series of lawsuits related to the privacy of the perpetrators.  Abduction and murder  The victim, Jakub Fiszman, was a millionaire German businessman from Frankfurt am Main. He was seized and carried off, even though injured, of the premises of his corporation in Eschborn on October 1, 1996. On October 10, the abductors received the ransom payment of four million Deutsche Mark that they had demanded. Rainer and Sven K√∂rppen, along with three other people, were arrested by the police of the state of Hessen on October 16, 1996. The badly decomposed body of Jakub Fiszman was eventually found on October 19 in the Taunus mountains, after a massive search operation involving some 500 police officers. The forensic report indicated that he was bludgeoned to death with a blunt instrument. Fiszman was buried on October 22, 1996, with great public attention. Trial and conviction Criminal proceedings against Rainer and Sven K√∂rppen began on October 2, 1997. On October 1, 1998, the principal perpetrator Rainer K√∂rppen was sentenced to life in prison and to indefinite security detention (Sicherungsverwahrung). Sven K√∂rppen was sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment. He was released in May 2006. He committed suicide in November 2010.Artikel vom 2.12.2010 im Wiesbadener Kurier (retrieved 12.12.2010) Privacy lawsuits From prison, Rainer K√∂rppen has filed suits against various German media, including the Berliner Zeitung, the Hessischer Rundfunk and the Norddeutscher Rundfunk, claiming that the reproduction of his full name in the online archives of the media coverage about his crime is in violation of his right to privacy. Even though he has little chance of ever being released, the Landgericht (state court) Hamburg has sided with him in several cases, holding that \\"reporting about a crime committed by a convicted person may substantially infringe their fundamental right to the free development of their personality\\".

Elmer attempts to gain Molly's father's blessing to propose to Molly and is told to go and fetch a justice of the peace, however this is a ruse so that the justice can marry Molly and Homer instead. Homer throws Elmer out of the house so he can marry Molly in peace. Outside, Elmer saves a man named Oscar from his wife whom he was intending to leave for another woman. In return Elmer asks for Oscar's help putting a stop to the wedding. However, when the two arrive at the wedding Oscar recognizes Molly as the woman he was going to leave his wife for. Elmer, Oscar and Homer engage in a three way scuffle each attempting to marry Molly. Eventually Oscar's wife shows up and causes chaos in the house.

Early life McKeown grew up as one of a large, working-class London family. He left school at the age of 14 and went to work in the darkroom of the Daily Herald. He joined the Navy in 1943 and served with the Fleet Air Arm in the Far East on board HMS Ameer as a photographer. At the end of the Second World War, he returned to London. He was offered a job at Illustrated London News in 1946 and he stayed with the magazine until 1952. In 1950, his picture Jitterbugging on a London Dance Floor won the international \\"News Picture of the Year\\" competition. He married Doris Leslie in 1952. Work for Picture Post McKeown's years at Picture Post (1953 - 1957) saw him mature as a photographer, producing some of his most memorable work. These included assignments to the Soviet Baltic Fleet in 1953, featured in the coronation issue (a story about this has him drinking multiple toasts in vodka with the Soviet officers, ending in one to the Queen), the funeral of Sibelius, Princess Margaret's tour of the West Indies and the wedding of Grace Kelly and Prince Rainier of Monaco. His photograph Need for Speed, which depicts the great Argentine racing driver Fangio winning the 1954 French Grand Prix remains one of his most widely reproduced. In stark contrast with the pictures of royalty and high society were those he took of ordinary people living in the austerity of post-war Britain. It is perhaps these, though, which are of the most lasting value as social documents. In 1954, he photographed Leonard Cheshire for Russell Braddon's biography, Leonard Cheshire VC: a story of war and peace. In 1956, he was dispatched to Egypt to cover the Suez crisis, an event which his brother Michael portrayed from the Israeli side. His photographs have become some of the defining images of the war and were widely reproduced on the 50th anniversary of the conflict. He was sent back home after he was blown out the back of a Land Rover. Later life and work After leaving Picture Post, McKeown worked as a freelance, with photographs appearing frequently in Life and Paris Match. He did a considerable amount of advertising work in this era; probably the best remembered campaign he worked on was \\"Go to work on an egg\\". In 1967, he took a picture of Donald Campbell rowing on Coniston Water, the evening before his fatal attempt at the water speed record. The picture was unpublished until 1981. Also in 1967, he collaborated with Aubrey Wilson on London's Industrial Heritage. The Evening News said: \\"Illuminated by Joseph McKeown's moody, lyrical photographs, here is a guide to a London that has hitherto eluded eyes accustomed to other aesthetics standards.\\" As such, Wilson and McKeown were among the pioneers of industrial heritage as an idea. He moved, with his wife and two children, to Bungay, Suffolk in the early eighties. His best known photograph from this period was the 1990 picture of John Selwyn Gummer, then Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, feeding his daughter Cordelia a hamburger at the height of the BSE crisis. Shortly after his death in 2007, his work was featured in a Getty Images exhibition of photographs from Picture Post.

It denotes the minimum contents of a contract in order for it to be held effective and legally binding. General contracts Two parties purport to \\"agree\\" to have concluded a contract for a car, but have not actually worked out a price, it cannot be said that they have concluded a contract. The price would seem to be an \\"essential term\\". If further, the \\"buyer\\" had gone to a car dealer and said he would pay ¬£10,000 for a car, but has not said which car, a \\"essential term\\" is probably lacking again. The price and the thing exchanged are examples of essential terms in simple sale of goods contracts. However, the court may not just hold that a contract is invalid. In England, the Sale of Goods Act 1979 s.8(2) states ‚Äòthe buyer must pay reasonable price‚Äô when a contract of sale is silent on price. Accordingly the absence of price may not be fatal to a contract of sale. Employment contracts In contracts of employment, essential terms can include not just pay and a basic job description (the work-wage bargain) but also to specifics on holidays, a notice period in the event of dismissal, the place of work, any collective agreements and whether the job is expected to be permanent or a fixed term contract. These are examples under European Union law, implemented under Directive 91/533 on an employer's obligation to inform employees of the conditions applicable to the contract of employment relationship.OJ L 1991 288 Article 2 of the Directive states, > \\"1. An employer shall be obliged to notify an employee to whom this > Directive applies hereinafter referred to as the \\"employee\\", of the > essential aspects of the contract or employment relationship\\" All countries in the European Union are required to \\"translate\\" directives into national legislation. An example of this is the Employment Rights Act 1996, section 1, in the United Kingdom, which sets out the obligation of employers to supply employees with a statement of written particulars within two months of employment beginning. In the English speaking world, this notion has not survived as well as in civil law jurisdictions, for the doctrine of consideration has essentially covered the requirement of essential terms in basic bargains. However the concept of what is \\"essential\\" changes according to the nature of a particular contract, and so there may be fewer \\"essentials\\" in the case of a simple shopping exchange, and more essentials necessary for the proper functioning of a contract in the case of renting a home, taking out a bank loan or pursuing a career.

(1999) Attachment Theory and Research: Implications for the theory and practice of individual psychotherapy with adults. Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications eds Cassidy, J. & Shaver, P. (1999) Guilford Press: New York and London. pp. 575‚Äì594Special Issue: Attachment-based psychoanalytic psychotherapy. Attachment & Human Development, 6, June 2004, pp. 113‚Äì207. As a branch of relational psychoanalysis, attachment-based psychotherapy combines the epidemiological categories of attachment theory (including the identification of the attachment styles such as secure, anxious, ambivalent and disorganized/disoriented) with an analysis and understanding of how dysfunctional attachments get represented in the human inner world and subsequently re-enacted in adult life. Psychotherapy, or talk therapy, can help to alleviate dysfunctional emotions caused by attachment disorders, such as jealousy, rage, rejection, loss, and commitment issues that are brought on by the lack of response from a parent or the loss of a loved one. Events, such as domestic abuse or lack of a father figure, can result in these dysfunctional emotions. These issues can also have effects of the child in their adulthood, by making them incapable of making and keeping healthy relationships or by making them have false beliefs that they will be abandoned.Holmes, J. (1996) Attachment, Intimacy, Autonomy: Using Attachment Theory in Adult Psychotherapy\\" The use of Psychotherapy helps modify dysfunctional emotions in order to give the patient a healthy understanding of the traumatic experiences they have gone through. It is important for psychotherapists dealing with Attachment disorders to create a personal relationship with the patient in order to help the patient to make intimate attachments in their normal lives. Effective psychotherapy for patients dealing with attachment disorders must be supportive and consist of effective communication between the patient and therapist. Treatment Therapists apply psychotherapy to patients with attachment disorders by applying a method of listening and reflecting on the experiences of the patient that caused their difficulty in making emotional connections. The therapist's objective is to get the patient to open up to them so the patient can explore the experiences that are causing them to have dysfunctional relationships and to recreate the experience from the point of view of the therapist in order to resolve any emotional or social disruptions within the patient's life. According to Dan Hughes this process is known as ‚Äúattunement, disruption, and repair‚Äù. The first part of the treatment, the attunement, consists of the forging of a personal relationship between the therapist and the patient, it is the first step for the patient toward creating healthy attachments. Attachment patients live stressful lives with very little emotional attachments to people, thus it is the therapist's job to create a secure, accepting, caring, non-judgmental, and reliable environment where the patient can feel comfortable sharing their most traumatic experiences.Hughes, D. (2010) Attachment and Human Development\\" Once the patient and therapist have created a trust worthy and reliable relationship the therapist will probe the patient on any traumatic experiences that may have happened to them in their child hood and that connect to any disruptions in their lives at the time. The therapist pays special attention to the relationship between the patient and their parents because the lack of responsiveness of a parent early in a child development can lead to dysfunctional relationships later on in their life. The therapist may even ask the parent or caregiver to attend the therapy sessions in order to correct any complications in their relationship. The therapist will ask the parent to be present if they want to help the child and parent repair their relationship. The therapist will facilitate in their communication and have them share in an ‚Äúaffective/ reflective‚Äù way. Having the parent in the room, such as in group therapy, may also help the patient face the root of their problems, which most psychologists believe stems from the parents. In this sense the parent or care giver will be taking on the role of the therapist in order to resolve issue that directly impact the parent's life This part of the therapy treatment is called disruptive because by having the patients talk about their traumatic experiences and relationship with their parents in depth, the therapist is getting them to re-experience the trauma. Getting the patient to face their own trauma has the effect of getting them to accept their own ego and understand why they have trouble creating healthy attachments with people. As the patient shares their experiences the therapist is expected to be actively listening and express empathy and acceptance to the patient. The therapist creates an even deeper relationship with the patient by treating the patient's experiences as their own experiences and coming up with their own interpretations to the events while constantly be understanding of and engaged with the patient. The therapist may also mimic the patient's emotions in order to show their understanding and to encourage the patient to keep sharing. After the patient shares the traumatic events from their life and the therapist integrates them as their own, the therapist begins the repair of the patient. The repair stage of the therapy aims to alter the patient's current reactions to the events that cause them emotional distress by sharing their own interpretations of the event. By sharing their own subjective interpretation they hope create a new reality of the traumatic events for the patient in order to get rid of unwanted emotions.

A street artist during the sixties, his art has been labelled as part of hyperrealism and a representative of the ‚Äúnew figurative‚Äù movement. He paints classical empty buildings and interiors: ballrooms, office receptions, halls of the Louvre museum, chambers of the Prado, the Palace of Versailles, monumental spaces that fuse reality and fiction under a fleeting atmosphere of light. His unique creative universe mixes scientific and mathematical concepts and a passion for art from the past, Italian, Dutch and Spanish old masters, especially Diego Vel√°zquez and Francisco Goya. It has inspired numbers of writers and critics, like Jean-Christophe Bailly or Julio Cort√°zar who, fascinated by Taul√©'s rooms and tables, wrote the story ‚ÄúFin de etapa‚Äù, in Deshoras,* a book published in 1983. From 1982 onwards, Antoni Taul√© has created set designs, largely springing from development in his own painting, for some of the great opera and theatre, including Washington Square, Henry James's novel, adapted by Rudolf Nureyev, Enfance and Pour un oui, pour un non (For No Good Reason) by Nathalie Sarraute, or Francis Poulenc and his Dialogues of the Carmelites adapted from a play by Georges Bernanos.

He is one of the most important polyphonists in the music history of Portugal. Another representative of the high level of cultural interchanges between the two countries, as some of the highest figures of the peninsular cultural history have moved around between the two countries freely and mostly in a way unrelated to the political events of the time (Diego Vel√°zquez was of Portuguese origin; and Alonso S√°nchez Coello are some of the examples). Life Lopes Morago was born in Vallecas, near Madrid, but he passed the vast majority of his life in Portugal. He was a student of Filipe de Magalh√£es at the Cathedral of √âvora, where he obtained his licentiate degree. After that, in August 1599, he went to the Cathedral of Viseu where he was appointed canon and mestre de capela. In 1626, the chapter of the Cathedral allowed him to go to Lisbon to publish his works. These included the Livro Comum and the Vesperal, which have survived. The place and year of his death are uncertain. There are indications that Morago moved to Spain and died there about 1628. However, a later document (1630) states that Morago had retired to a Franciscan monastery in Viseu (Convento de Orgens) and died there. Works Morago composed motets, responsories, psalms, Magnificats, and a Requiem. His work is considered to be highly innovative in the Iberian Peninsula. The musicologist Manuel Joaquim considered his motet Oculi mei \\"genial and worthy of the renown of Palestrina's O vos omnes, or Hoc die\\". The British composer Ivan Moody wrote: ...what causes special impact in the music of Morago is the usage of the dissonance, and (...) an interest in antiphonary effects. Motets such as Oculi mei, of ambiguous key and intercalated with numberless diminished fourths, demonstrate perfectly the expressiveness of this harmonic audacity. The alternances of this kind of intense imitative composition painstakingly elaborated with sudden twitches of rhythmical homophony are also typical of the works Versa est in luctum and Commissa mea; in fact, the work of Morago for penitential and funerary texts is extremely sensitive. The works of Morago are kept in the archives of Viseu. The Funda√ß√£o Calouste Gulbenkian published most of them in the book Obras de M√∫sica Religiosa (Portugaliae Musica IV, 1961).

The suburb was named after one of the three historic subdivisions of Yorkshire. 'North' was favoured at the time due to North Riding's location north of the CBD of Johannesburg. The Suburb formerly fell under the jurisdiction of the Randburg Town Council before it was incorporated into the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan area. Of the original 3 farms that were joined to form Randburg, North riding was located on the Olievenhout farm. North Riding fully encloses the Suburb of Bellair Park. The area was once prominently known as a horse riding and stable stronghold in the north of Johannesburg, but gave way to other areas such as Kyalami and Honeydew extensions. This can be seen in the road and street names. Previously the area was rather rural, had Agricultural Holding status and is still referred to as Northriding A.H. by some. After 1996 North Riding developed rapidly, in both the residential and commercial sector. Surrounding suburbs include: Olivedale, Northworld, Northwold Garden, Northgate, Johannesburg North, Noordhang and Golden Harvest. Main streets in the suburb include Blandford, Bellair and Malibongwe (previously Hans Strijdom) with the original entrance roads of Windsor and Smith, Ascot and Hyperion. North Riding includes various shopping centers and bed and breakfast accommodation. Various streams flow through the area, one such flowing from west to north-east is the Olievenhoutspoort.

July 1863 ‚Äì 22 June 1891) was an English footballer who played as a full back. He was born in Walsall, won the FA Cup in 1888 and represented the England national football team twice. Career Aldridge started his career at hometown club Walsall Swifts where he spent six seasons. He played in nine FA Cup ties and scored one goal, in a third round win over Mitchell St George's in January 1885. In March 1886 Aldridge moved to West Bromwich Albion where he earned his first cap for England in a British Home Championship match against Ireland in Belfast. He had great success in the FA Cup while at West Bromwich Albion, helping them to the final in 1887, and to win the trophy in 1888 by beating the much-fancied Preston North End in the final. Despite his cup heroics, Aldridge moved back to the newly merged Walsall Town Swifts during that summer. He played in 13 matches in the Midland Association for the Saddlers in 1888‚Äì1889 and earned his second, and final, England cap in a match against Ireland in the British Home Championship at Anfield. Aldridge was the second player to play for England while at Walsall, after Alf Jones who appeared for the national side while playing for Walsall Swifts in 1882. In 1889 Aldridge joined Aston Villa, where he made 14 appearances in the First Division as Villa finished as runners-up. Death Aldridge died on 22 June 1891 at his home in Walsall, due to poor health. He was only 27 years old.

These programs often use procedural generation to generate the landscapes. If not using procedural generation to create the landscapes, then normally a 3D artist would render and create the landscapes. These programs are often used in video games or movies. Basic elements of landscapes created by scenery generators include terrain, water, foliage, and clouds. The process for basic random generation uses a diamond square algorithm.  Common features  Most scenery generators can create basic heightmaps to simulate the variation of elevation in basic terrain. Common techniques include Simplex noise, fractals, or the Diamond- Square Algorithm, which can generate 2-dimensional heightmaps. A version of scenery generator can be very simplistic. Using a Diamond-Square Algorithm with some extra steps involving fractals an algorithm for random generation of terrain can be made with only 120 lines of code. The program in example takes a grid and then divides the grid repeatedly. Each smaller grid is then split into squares and diamonds and the algorithm then makes the randomized terrain for each square and diamond. Most programs for creating the landscape can also allow for adjustment and editing of the landscape. For example World Creator allows for terrain sculpting which uses a similar ‚Äúbrush‚Äù system as Photoshop and allows to enhance it additionally with its procedural techniques such as erosion, sediments, and more. Other tools the World Creator program can use are terrain stamping which you can import height-maps and uses them as a base. The programs tend to also allow for additional placement of rocks, trees, Etc. These can be done procedurally or by hand depending on the program. Typically the models used for the placement objects are the same as to lessen the amount of work that would be done if the user was to create a multitude of different trees. The terrain generated the computer does a generation of multifractals then integrates them until finally rendering them onto the screen. These techniques are typically done ‚Äúon-the-fly‚Äù which typically for a 128x128 resolution terrain would mean 1.5 seconds on a CPU from the early 1990s.‚ÄúDynamic Terrain Generation Based on Multifractal Techniques‚Äù TNO Physics and Electronic Laboratory.

These typically use either custom or purchased engines that contain their own scenery generators. For some games they tend to use a procedurally generated terrain. These typically use a form of height mapping and use of Perlin noise. This will create a grid that with one point in a 2D coordinate will create the same heightmap as it is pseudo-random, meaning it will result in the same output with the same input. This can then easily be translated into the product 3D image. These can then be changed from the editor tools in most engines if the terrain will be custom built. With recent developments neural networks can be built to create or texture the terrain based on previously suggested artwork or heightmap data. These would be generated using algorithms that have been able to identify images and similarities between them. With the info the machine can take other heightmaps and render a very similar looking image to the style image. This can be used to create similar images in example a Studio Ghibli or Van Gogh art-style. Software There is a large variety and amount of software that will generate scenery and allow for editing of it.

The north-east A14 passes under the roundabout, but the west-east A14 traffic, which is the majority, must enter the roundabout. Traffic lights were added in 2006 in an attempt to reduce the number of accidents and improve traffic flow. The word spital or spittal in this context itself derives from 'hospital', in the sense of hospitality or shelter, as almshouses were originally known. In this case the 'spital' in question is St Margaret's Hospital, which owned land to the north of Huntingdon in medieval times.

He has also worked in the USA under the name Paul Cline.  Biography  Born in the East End, Smith attended Walthamstow College of Art where in 1956 he met and became the lover of Eric Hebborn, who was to become a notorious art forger. Smith moved on to the Royal College of Art and Hebborn to the Royal Academy, but the couple stayed together for the next 13 years. Upon Hebborn's return from a two-year stay in Italy after winning the Academy's Prix-de-Rome, the couple lived together in the run-down Cumberland Hotel in Highbury. They set up business buying and selling art, and spent many hours scouring junk shops for bargains. They befriended Marie Gray, who owned a shop near Leicester Square, and it was at her suggestion and from her stock that they used blank sheets of period paper upon which Hebborn could create original drawings, while Smith 'antiqued' them. In 1963 they moved to Italy and opened a gallery, which attracted the attention of several of the art cognoscenti of the day. Notable amongst them was Sir Anthony Blunt, who often stayed with the couple when visiting Rome. Smith and Hebborn grew apart and in 1969 Smith returned to London. He moved into fabric and wallpaper design, creating stylised designs of trees, flowers, birds and animals for Jean Muir and Osborne & Little, amongst others. In the late 1970s Smith relocated with his lover John Elliker to California, and again changed artistic direction, now working in book illustration under the name Paul Cline. After Elliker died in 1987, Smith began to create a series of erotic drawings influenced by the medieval Dance of Death, and the resurrection of the genre by the Mexican artist Jos√© Guadalupe Posada. These reflected his horror at the impact of AIDS on the homosexual community. Geraldine Norman, in her article in The Independent refers to them as 'terrifying' and states that they use 'a highly finished academic style, reminiscent of the fine drawing taught by 19th century French academies'. They were exhibited in the Rita Dean gallery in San Diego. At this time Smith also lived a parallel life on the fringe of the hustler community in Los Angeles. He became friendly with Rick Castro and memorably appeared as Ambrose Sapperstein in his 1996 movie Hustler White.Hustler White directed by Rick Castro & Bruce LaBruce, 1996 Smith's autobiography was published in 1996, which, he says, he wrote partly to refute some of the claims of Hebborn's own autobiographical work. In 1997 Smith returned to London where he now lives. He continues to write, mainly poetry, and to create further tableaux drawings on death and homo-erotic themes.

It was subsequently acquired by Curro Holdings to formulate Curro Aurora. The school was established in 1993 by Wendy Benbow- Hebbert, Judy Nicholas and Debbie Adam, three former inner City of Johannesburg teachers who sought to reform practises of the education system perceived as stifling and counter productive. As a result, Aurora was created as a liberal educational institution which drew significant attention from its inception in comparison with contemporary traditional private schools in South Africa. Location Aurora was located where its present successor is currently located in Sundowner, Randburg. Entrances are located on both Taurus Road and Puttick Avenue. Aurora moved to this site in 1998 having previously occupied a site in Randpark Ridge called TV Park which now houses Willowridge Private School. The original layout of the school is unconventional in having circular building complexes named after the planets of the solar system positioned around the original school hall. The extraterrestrial theme of the school, which has carried through to its successor, mimics the theme of the surrounding suburban street names. The school is flanked by two sporting grounds, the older Galaxy Park to the west and relatively newer Dream Park to the east. Despite subsequently changing, it was intended that Mercury houses Grade 0 (Grade R), Venus house Grades 1‚Äì3, Mars house Grades 4‚Äì6, Jupiter house Grades 7‚Äì9 and both Saturn A and B house Grades 10 through to Matriculation. The pre-school has continued to operate along with the aftercare facilities in a complex called Solaria. Operating as a school quadrangle was the Luna piazza, with a fountain at its centre, it extended from the Hall to the Pavilion and a large outcrop of geological rocks which characterised the school's landscape. The rock face and piazza have subsequently been demolished and the Pavilion has been converted into an administrative extension of the present Primary School. Uniform It was often incorrectly contended that Aurora had no uniform, a rarity in the South African educational system. The uniform of the school evolved throughout the history of the school but remained distinct and relatively casual. At inception the school required pupils to wear a simple T-shirt in any of the school's three colours with black trousers or shorts of any kind and any black footwear. Subsequently, takkies or sneakers were forbidden except for sport use and the school came to provide black denim pants with white stripes on the rear pockets. The primary school uniform consisted of white golf shirts with green collars paired with black shorts and black shoes. In the absence of a blazer, a red jumper was worn. Primary school pupils could wear an optional green sunhat. Socks and hair accessories could be in any of the school colours. The senior high school uniform originally mimicked the primary school with substituted black jumpers. Eventually, this gave way to a single uniform for the high school which consisted of white golf shirts with red collars as previously worn by pupils in the junior high school. The white jumpers previously worn by the junior high school were abandoned. Winter uniforms included black tracksuit pants coupled with red tracksuit jackets with a black chevron and green blazons from the shoulders down. Scarfs, gloves and beanies could be worn provided they were in the school's colours. As the school progressed, it introduced the traditional school blazer. For the primary school, irrespective of the pupils' achievements, this was black. In the high school, students became eligible for an Honours Blazer which was ivory-white in colour. Both had the school emblem on the left chest pocket. Honours were awarded for full colours in two or more disciplines in the codes of academics, sport or, as a cross-over for both, general. Scrolls, badges and trimmings were applied per participation and level of achievement of the pupil. The left sleeve's forearm was trimmed for team colours, the right equivalent was for half colours and a full blazer trimming was for full colours in a single discipline are correlated to a red scroll which was also affixed. In Grade 11 pupils entered into negotiations with representatives of the school's governing body concerning Matric privileges. Among these negotiations was a decision in respect of what the uniform would be for pupils in Grade 12 who would wear a different uniform from the rest of the school often of their own collective design. The School retained the right to refuse this privilege and often did when it deemed the uniform inappropriate, too casual or at odds with the school's identity. An area where the pupils had remarkable freedom in comparison with their contemporaries at other private schools was with respect to their bodily appearances. In the high school, students were permitted to do what they wished with their hair. This was provided that it remained clean and if it touched their collars it would be tied up. This was later restricted to remain within the realms of a natural colour. Further, high school students were permitted tattoos and piercings provided the former were not visible when wearing the uniform and were only worn with a bristle with regards to the latter. Pupils were allowed to wear makeup however the school retained the right to determine whether it was suitable on a case-by-case basis. Learning structure Aurora is different from any other schools in Johannesburg, as they offer a number of external certificates which students can gain throughout their journey at Aurora, ranging from business management, event management and catering to the ICDL and ITSI computer certificates. . Aurora is affiliated with the IEB independent assessment agency and strives for all of the matrics to graduate with their NSC at the end of grade 12. From grades 7‚Äì9 the subjects given are: English, Afrikaans/Zulu, Mathematics, Life Orientation, Human and Social Sciences, Natural Science, Economic Management Science, Physical Education, Computer literacy, Arts and culture and Technology.

The screenplay was written by Barr√© Lyndon who made a number of changes to the novel, including the change of George Harvey Bone into a classical composer-pianist and filming the story as an early 20th-century period piece.. The movie was released in New York City on February 7, 1945, two months after its star, Laird Cregar, suffered a fatal heart attack. Plot In Edwardian London, in the summer of 1903, a Scottish shopowner in Fulham is stabbed to death and his shop set on fire by distinguished composer George Harvey Bone (Laird Cregar), who stumbles out onto the street in a stupor. George eventually makes his way back the next night to his basement flat at 12 Hangover Square in Chelsea to find his girlfriend Barbara Chapman (Faye Marlowe) and her father Sir Henry Chapman (Alan Napier) inside. George admits privately to Barbara that there is \\"a whole day missing\\" from his memory. The newspaper has stories of the murder and fire, and George goes to see Dr. Allan Middleton (George Sanders) who works at Scotland Yard. Bone tells Middleton that when he is stressed or overworked he suffers from periods of amnesia brought on by discordant sounds. Middleton's advice is to go out among ordinary people and observe how they work and recreate. On August 29 at a smoking concert at a working-class pub, George meets an ambitious and conniving singer named Netta Longdon (Linda Darnell) through his buddy Mickey (Michael Dyne). Although Netta, who also lives in the square, is a mediocre talent, George is enamoured of her. Netta finds George boring, yet nonetheless mercilessly manipulates him to get money, dinners, drinks and all kinds of favours for months. Meanwhile, Barbara is put off by George's interest in Netta, as Middleton tries to get closer to her. George is driven to the point of having another amnesia episode and almost strangles Barbara to death. George finally strangles Netta to death on Guy Fawkes Night. He carries her wrapped body through streets filled with revelers and deposits it on top of the biggest bonfire. Having no memory of the killing, George is able to convince the police that he had nothing to do with it; however, Middleton remains suspicious. He later confronts George on the night of his concerto premier, and insists that he be taken in for his own protection. However, George locks Middleton into his flat and performs the concerto as planned. Middleton's banging is heard by a local workman and he is freed. Midway through the concerto performance he enters the music salon with several other policemen, causing George to enter into one of his episodes. He is forced to stop performing and asks Barbara to carry on playing; however, whilst being questioned by the police in a separate room he attacks them, in the process of which a gas lamp is knocked over, setting the room alight. George proceeds to continue with his piano concerto, unmindful of the conflagration around him and ignoring Barbara's pleas to escape, as flames consume everything. As Middleton and Barbara look on from outside, Middleton says that \\"it is better this way\\".

Fox agreed, but wanted to recreate the success it had enjoyed the previous year with The Lodger, and made several changes to the story, including the main character's personality and the setting. Cregar, George Sanders and John Brahm, who had all worked together in The Lodger, were announced as working on the film. Cregar, who had ambitions of being a leading man and was worried that he would always be cast as a villain, refused the role and was put on suspension. Glenn Langan was announced as his replacement. However, Cregar realized he could use his romantic scenes with Linda Darnell and Faye Marlowe to his advantage in order to change his public image into a more romantic one. He thus accepted the role, but began a radical crash diet to give his character more physical appeal. The film had to be shot entirely in sequence so as to be consistent with Cregar's real-life weight loss. This frustrated director John Brahm, who frequently clashed with Cregar over how the film should be handled. Cregar, a real-life musician, was eager to perform the musical pieces on his own; however, Brahm insisted that Cregar mime. Cregar used amphetamines to aid his rapid weight loss, which led to erratic behavior on his part. Brahm lost patience with Cregar, and forced the entire cast and crew to sign a document stating they were on Brahm's side and not Cregar's in order to humiliate the actor into submission. When filming had ended, Cregar told Brahm: \\"Well, I think we've worked together long enough to know we never want to work together again.\\" George Sanders also brought complications. Having been put on suspension the previous year for refusing to perform in The Undying Monster, he accepted the role of Dr. Allan Middleton. However, he was unhappy with his script, particularly the final line in the film, which required him to justify the death of George Harvey Bone by saying, \\"He's better off this way.\\" When shooting the scene, which was very expensive to film, Sanders repeatedly refused to say the line. He later got into an altercation with the film's producer, Robert Bassler, which ended in Sanders punching him. The line was later changed to, \\"It's better this way.\\" The American composer Stephen Sondheim has cited Bernard Herrmann's score for Hangover Square as a major influence on his musical Sweeney Todd.National Theatre: Platform Papers: Stephen Sondheim. June 1993. Last accessed: July 16, 2008. Reception =Box office= The film made a profit of $27,700. =Critical= The film received mixed reviews. The staff at Variety magazine liked the film and wrote, \\"Hangover Square is eerie murder melodrama of the London gaslight era‚Äîtypical of Patrick Hamilton yarns, of which this is another.

Hollywood Cauldron: Thirteen Horror Films from the Genre's Golden Age, p. 347. McFarland & Company. CD release of Herrmann's music In 2010, the British label Chandos released a CD that includes a 17-minute concert suite from Hangover Square, assembled by Stephen Hogger. The film's musical tour de force is a sonata movement for piano and orchestra in the Lisztian style (where the scherzo and adagio movements, which are typical as succeeding movements in a concerto, are compressed and presented in place of a central development). Slightly revised by the composer in 1973 for Charles Gerhardt's RCA film music series and retitled \\"Concerto Macabre\\", it has been recorded by RCA, Na√Øve, Koch and Naxos, in addition to the recording paired with Hogger's suite. Save for that released by RCA, all of the recordings of the Concerto relied on the version edited and engraved in 1992 by Christopher Husted, editor of the Bernard Herrmann Edition. The disc also includes Stephen Hogger's extended suite based on Herrmann's incidental music for Citizen Kane (1941).

Plot Elmer Triple is a chemist who is a constant source of frustration to his professor boss, who feels that while he showed promise at a young age he has ultimately never used his gifts for anything useful. Elmer aims to correct him by showing a series of concoctions he has developed. The first liquidizes an entire breakfast which can then be consumed in one gulp. Elmer's second invention can make things grow to three times their original size, which he demonstrates on a parrot and a goldfish. Elmer's final invention is a candy which he claims will make women fall in love with the first person they see. Elmer gives his candy to a young woman who turns out to be the girlfriend of a gangster. The girl falls instantly in love with Elmer and when the gangster sees the two kissing he throws Elmer back into his laboratory. He has only one of the candies left and nut it gets lost in a box of regular chocolates. He attempts to give the candy to an attractive secretary, but he himself ends up eating his specially created one and passionately kisses the secretary and subsequently receiving a beating. The professor is unimpressed with Elmer's inventions and tells him he'd better invent something useful soon. While trying to invent noiseless fire crackers, Elmer unwittingly invents an explosive yet noiseless powder which the head of the university theorizes could be used in war zones. Elsewhere the gangster learns of the explosive powder in the paper and realizes he could use it to blow open bank vaults. The gangster and his two associates dress up as professors, convince Elmer they are there to inspect the powder and take him with them to a bank which they then hold up. When his attempts to blow up the safe, Elmer realizes he has brought his love powder instead of his explosive powder. The gang march Elmer back to the university and get him to demonstrate how the powder works. Elmer shows them that the powder explodes when brought into contact with water. Before they can make their way back to the bank, Elmer covers the gangsters in the powder and threatens to spray them with water until they turn themselves in. After taking the gangsters to the police station Elmer is hailed as a genius by numerous other professors to the university and offers them some of the growth formula he demonstrated earlier which they accept. Outside the police station Elmer is spotted by the gangster's girlfriend who is still in love with him and the two kiss. However the two are soon chased down the street by the professors who have in fact shrunken down to the size of dwarfs due to Elmer supplying them with the wrong formula.

History In 1906, Fort Bragg residents established an official water dump site behind the Union Lumber Company onto what is now known as \\"Site 1\\". Most water-fronted communities had water dump sites discarding glass, appliances, and even vehicles. Locals referred to it as \\"The Dumps.\\" Fires were often lit using Molotov cocktails to reduce the size of the trash pile. When the original dump site filled up in 1943, the site was moved to what is now known as \\"Site 2\\", the active dump site from 1943 until 1949. When this beach became full in 1949, the dump was moved north to what is now known as \\"Glass Beach\\", which remained an active dump site until 1967. The California State Water Resources Control Board and city leaders closed this area in 1967. Various cleanup programs were undertaken through the years to correct the damage. Over the next several decades, what was biodegradable in the dump sites simply degraded and all the metal and other items were eventually removed and sold as scrap or used in art. The pounding waves broke down the glass and pottery and tumbled those pieces into the small, smooth, colored pieces that often become jewelry-quality, which cover Glass Beach and the other two glass beaches (former dump sites) in Fort Bragg. There are three Glass Beach sites in Fort Bragg where trash was dumped into the ocean between 1906 and 1967. Site Two (1943-1949) and Three (1949‚Äì1967 - \\"Glass Beach\\") are located at the end of the path that begins on the corner of Elm Street and Glass Beach Drive. These sites are accessible by foot and by a short climb down the cliffs surrounding the beach. Site One (1906‚Äì43) is 1/4 mile south of Site Two and has become accessible by foot as of January 2015 when the northern section of the new Coastal Trail in Fort Bragg opened. In 1998, the private owner of the property began a five-year process of working with the California Coastal Conservancy and the California Integrated Waste Management Board for the cleanup and sale of the property to the state. Following completion of the clean up, the California Department of Parks and Recreation purchased the property adjacent to Glass Beach, and it was incorporated into MacKerricher State Park in October 2002. All of the actual \\"Glass Beach\\", Site 3, is adjacent to MacKerricher State Park. All entities in California end at the mean high water mark (MHW), according to Article 10 of the state constitution. In Fort Bragg, the mean high water mark is 5.2', and all of Glass Beach, Site 3, is below that water mark. Sites 1 & 2 are located south of \\"Glass Beach\\" and do not abut the state park area, though they abut the new city park area, which also ends at the mean high water mark (MHW). Tourism The beach is now visited by tens of thousands of tourists yearly. Collecting is discouraged by State Park Rangers on the section of \\"Glass Beach\\" adjacent to the state park, where they ask people to leave what little glass is left for others to enjoy, although most of the sea glass is now found on the other two glass beaches outside the state park area. About 1,000 to 1,200 tourists visit Fort Bragg's glass beaches each day in the summer. Most collect some glass. Because of this and also because of natural factors (wave action is constantly grinding down the glass), the glass is slowly diminishing. There is currently a movement by Captain J.H. (Cass) Forrington to replenish the beaches with discarded glass. Captain Forrington, founder, owner and curator of the local Sea Glass Museum, is a strong advocate for a full time research facility studying the benefits to the marine environment of the minerals used to make and clarify the glass, with a supporting aquarium that highlights the rich diversity of life found in Fort Bragg's waters, with the ultimate goal of promoting the formation of glass reefs to initiate new food chains worldwide on all the badly depleted continental shelves. Fort Bragg currently trucks its glass over the Sierra Nevada mountains to a landfill in Sparks, NV, even though 90% of the 7 foot depth of glass that used to cover Glass Beach, Site 3, was locally recycled, being used in things like the pathways to the Guest House Museum and Skunk Train, and in art like the beautiful back-lit mosaic created by high school students that adorns one of the local temples. On December 10, 2012, the City Council of the City of Fort Bragg discussed the beach glass depletion and declined to move forward with replenishment efforts due to the cost and perceived likelihood that required permits would not be approved. Similar beaches are found in Benicia, California and Eleele, Hawaii. Plants and animals Several endangered and protected native plants occur at Glass Beach including hybrid Menzies' wallflower.

Fort McRee was named in his honor. Early life McRee was born in December 1787 in Wilmington, North Carolina. He was the son of Major Griffith John McRee, a veteran of the American Revolution, and the daughter of Dr. John Fergus of Wilmington. Military career McRee was an 1805 graduate of the United States Military Academy and received his commission as a second lieutenant into the Army Corps of Engineers on 1 July 1805. From 1806 until 1808, he served as an assistant engineer surveying sites for coastal fortifications in the southern US. In 1808 he transferred to Charleston, South Carolina where he was involved in construction of defenses for that city's harbor. During the War of 1812, McRee was chief of artillery for the Northern Army then chief engineer for the Army of the Niagara Frontier. For gallant conduct in the Battle of Niagara he was brevetted to lieutenant colonel. For distinguished and meritorious service at the defense of Fort Erie, he was brevetted to colonel. After the War of 1812, McRee traveled to Europe where he served in Belgium and France surveying fortifications in those countries from 1815 to 1817. Upon his return to the US in 1817, McRee served on the Board of Engineers where he took part in the two- year general survey of America's coastal defenses. In bitter protest to the appointment of the foreign officer General Simon Bernard as the assistant to the chief of engineers, McRee resigned his officer's commission and was discharged from the military on 31 March 1819. Post-military career From February, 1825 until July, 1832, McRee served as Surveyor General of the United States for the territories of Illinois, Missouri and Arkansas. McRee died on 15 May 1833 in St. Louis, Missouri. In an ironic twist, it was General Bernard, the foreign officer that McRee so despised, that designed the seacoast fort that would eventually be named after McRee.

Bean. Both starring and written by the husband and wife team of Ren√©e Taylor and Joseph Bologna, the film traces the relationship of Pandora and Giggy, a seemingly incompatible couple who meet in a group therapy session and fall in love. The film was the second screenplay written by the couple (Lovers and Other Strangers being their first), and is also Bologna's film debut. In addition, there are early screen appearances from Paul Sorvino, Candice Azzara and Olympia Dukakis. Plot On Christmas Eve, Guido ‚ÄúGig‚Äù Panimba (Joseph Bologna) and Pandora ‚ÄúPanda‚Äù Gold (Renee Taylor) each morosely wander the streets of Manhattan and later join an emergency group therapy meeting designed to help the participants break self-destructive patterns. Each person lists his or her neuroses, ranging from bed-wetting to paranoia. When it is Panda's turn, we learn she is there on her 4th emergency session. She declares herself a failure as an actress, singer, dancer and woman, and launches into a long description of her life and many disastrous love affairs. We learn about Panda's past, in which her mother repeatedly assures her that she will be famous while her father repeatedly abandons them for affair after affair. To escape her unhappy home life, young Panda immerses herself in Hollywood movies, often imitating movie stars such as Rita Hayworth. By the time she is nineteen, Panda tries to attract her father's attention by displeasing him, and to that end moves in with a married, Chinese boyfriend. When her father learns of this, he dies of a heart attack, and at the funeral, his many lovers hysterically blame Panda for his demise. Her next boyfriend ends up leaving her for another man. She works as a hostess of a television quiz show and a nightclub performer, but she gives up both professions to go live in England with her latest boyfriend, whom she caught sleeping with two other women. Panda then enthusiastically announces her \\"comeback\\" at an upcoming cabaret revue and invites everyone in the session to come and see her. Gig, a newcomer to therapy, claims that he has no problems, and when the other participants goad him to be honest, he gets up to leave. Within minutes, however, he returns and announces that he caused his last girlfriend to attempt suicide. Gig recounts his past. He has little privacy from his parents and sisters and is made to feel guilty about his sexual urges. After his mother convinces him that love requires purity, and lust must be violently purged, Gig begins to treat women cruelly and eventually tries to join the seminary, but is soon caught in a tryst with a maid. Gig briefly joins the military, where he embraces an enemy soldier in joy upon learning that the man is not dead. Returning to America, Gig fails to prosper in his father's barbershop and instead goes back to college, where his African studies major horrifies his parents. He then embarks on relationship after relationship, leaving each woman in heartbreak until the latest, tried to kill herself. At the meeting, some of the women berate him but Panda is sympathetic. After the session, Gig and Panda get to talking and end up having sex in his car. While having sex, Panda accidentally blurts out that she loves him, after the encounter, Gig responds coldly and dismisses her. After some encouragement from the doctor who ran the session, Panda calls Gig in an attempt to scold him for his treatment of her, but she ends up inviting him to dinner. There, he enjoys the food but then readies to leave, promising to return later to have sex after the party he's going to. As he walks out the door, Panda screams after him that she will no longer accept being treated poorly. After she collapses on her bed, he returns silently and asks what they should do next. Gig reluctantly agrees to Panda's suggestion that they move in together, hoping to break his pattern of abusiveness. Gig finds he is able to really open up to Panda and he playfully helps Panda to overcome her inability to achieve orgasm. On New Year's Eve, Panda's mother appears, reminding Panda that she is late for her night club comeback. Ignoring her mother's disapproval of Gig, Panda rushes to prepare for her act and insists that Gig join them. He is appalled, however, by her act, a painfully amateurish song-and-dance number in which she asks the audience to create a new identity for her. Later, when she asks his opinion, he admits he did not understand it, prompting her mother to lash out at him. Panda asks her to leave, and later at a caf√© asks Gig for more constructive criticism. Upon learning that she has worked on the show for five years, Gig explodes that the act is awful and states that she embarrassed herself and him. Panda runs out and Gig follows, but on the street they fight and ultimately go their separate ways. Panda goes home alone and realizes her act is actually awful and that Gig was right. Meanwhile, Gig tries to sleep with another woman only to find himself impotent with her. The next day, Panda shows up at Gig's apartment and they make up. Learning that he is going to visit his parents, she insists on joining him, and on the way urges him to introduce her as his girl friend. Gig's large family seems welcoming to Panda until they ask how she met Gig and she responds with a long story about their encounter group and the necessity of escaping the psychological wounds inflicted by their parents. Soon, Gig's mother is screaming at her to leave and Gig shouts back that she must apologize to Panda. She concludes that she will not attend their wedding because Panda is Jewish and her views are so different from their own. Gig's father chastises her for overreacting and declares that they're just having fun, and clearly Gig would never marry Panda. To prove Panda is not Gig's type, he brings out a photo of Gig's first love, a slim Italian teenager. This visibly upsets Gig who decides to get up and leave with Panda, while his family screams after them. In the car, Gig starts to pick apart his parents, and their comments about Panda. However, Panda tells him that some of their comments about her (particularly her physical features) were accurate. This causes Gig to fly into a rage, because she's agreeing with his parents after all the nasty things they said, so he begins to berate her as well, eventually breaking up with her and forcing her to get out of the car. Panda walks off, but Gig immediately follows her. Eventually, after a lot of arguing, the two break down crying and Gig admits he really loves Panda and the two decide to get engaged.

All its arms operate in the DRC, while the company is based in Brussels. History TEXAF is best known as a brand name of DRC produced consumer textiles, along with UTEX, UTEXAFRICA, ONAFITEX, UTEXELEO, UTEXCO and IMMOTEX. From independence consumer textiles were among the most high profile domestic industries in Congo/Zaire. Based in Kinshasa, the company traces its lineage back to a 1925 Franco-Belgian company, founded in the then Belgian Congo, called TEXAF.HISTORIQUE DE TEXAF, texaf.be, retrieved 2011-09-26. In the 1930s‚Äî1950s the original TEXAF concession sold off its cotton plantation and shipping elements and focused on its textile production division, under the name UTEXLEO (founded 1934). Its name stood for Usines Textiles du Leopoldville, from the colonial name for Kinshasa. In 1960 it was the 31st most capitalized Conogolese company, though it remained European owned. Following independence, President Mobutu's \\"Zaireization\\" campaign saw the company nationalized in 1974, and renamed to reflect the new names of the country and its capital: UTEXCO. In the late 1970s and 1980s, the holding company of these brands‚ÄîTEXAF‚Äîconsolidated much of the Zaire textile industry, with the acquisitions of SOLBENA, Za√Øreprint (printing), Otricot-Super Star (food), ESTAGRICO (cotton), MECELCO (construction) COTONNIERE DU KASAI-MANIEMA, and the reacquisition of the resources of its cotton farming company (sold off in 1934) ONAFITEX. From 1980, a series of European companies held majority stock in TEXAF. The Congolese Civil War saw the deterioration of all Congolese industry, and TEXAF also suffered as its large \\"UTEXAFRICA Concession\\" plants and offices in Kinshasa city center were looted and destroyed in 1997. In 2001 TEXAF (now under the name UTEXAFRICA) was bankrupted and was eventually combined with BNP Paribas owned COBEPA. ownership changed again several times until the combined brands were purchased by Chinese firm CHA Textiles in 2004. From this point, UTEXAFRICA operated its consumer textiles division under the name CONGOTEX. In 2007, CONGOTEX was liquidated, marking the end of any independent Congolese textile industry. From this time, TEXAF textiles are produced overseas for Congolese and other markets. Operations Congotex' website states that the company is the largest textile and apparel manufacturer in the DRC.

The contestants would be confined to a single room with a TV that only showed their team's baseball games. Their faces would also be hidden from public view. If their team won, they got to eat dinner and a small portion of their face would be revealed to the audience. If their team lost, they would get no food and the lights would turn out, leaving them in darkness until the next day's game. If the contestant's favorite team went on a win streak, the quality of the food they could eat would increase as well as gain public exposure and popularity due to their entire face being shown on TV until their team finally lost. A losing streak would mean that a contestant could go days in the dark without food. At the end of the season, the contestant would win an overall prize depending on how their team placed.

It was published simultaneously in several leading biomedical journals in October and November 2007 and comprises both the checklist and an explanation and elaboration article which gives examples of good reporting and provides authors with more guidance on good reporting. It is also referred to in the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals established by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors and is endorsed by hundreds of biomedical journals.  Purpose  > The STROBE Statement was developed by the STROBE Initiative, an > international collaboration of epidemiologists, methodologists, > statisticians, researchers and journal editors with the aim to assist > authors when writing up analytical observational studies, to support editors > and reviewers when considering such articles for publication, and to help > readers when critically appraising published articles.  Extensions  There are many extensions to the STROBE Statement which cover a variety of different topic domains such as nutritional epidemiology, genetic association studies, rheumatology, molecular epidemiology, infectious disease molecular epidemiology, respondent-driven sampling, routinely collected health data (e.g., health administrative data, electronic health records, and registry data), antimicrobial stewardship programs, seroepidemiologic studies for influenza, medical abortion, simulation-based research, newborn infection, veterinary, and sports injury and illness. A draft checklist for reporting observational studies in conference abstracts is also available.  Adaptations and Future  In 2010, three years after STROBE's publication, the original creators reconvened and deemed an update unnecessary at the time. However, since, calls have supported for the reporting guideline to be updated, similarly to other reporting guidelines (like CONSORT and PRISMA) which have been updated as needed. An assessment of extension content as well as a survey of authors of observational studies provided several areas to improve upon. The STROBE Statement checklist is also available to use within a Writing Aid Tool Add-In for Microsoft Word that you can download and install. It includes the STROBE checklist within the software. The STROBE Statement has also been adapted as a public, open-source repository for epidemiological research methods and reporting skills for observational studies. Epidemiologists, statisticians, and public health researchers are welcome to comment and edit the tool to inform future updates of the reporting guideline.

According to historical records from the Han Dynasty, Sun Bin's Art of War contained an extensive 89 chapters, with four volumes of pictures attached, but was lost by the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty. As a result, Sun Bin's Art of War is sometimes confused with Sun Tzu's The Art of War. Rediscovery A Han dynasty (202 BC - 220 AD) copy of Sun Bing's Art of War (in a scroll of wooden strips), from a tomb of Shandong province, now in the Military Museum In April 1972, bamboo slips of both Sun Tzu's and Sun Bin's works were unearthed in the Yinque Hills (Linyi city, Shandong province). Due to natural erosion, some of the bamboo slips were damaged and difficult to read. After the initial collection and study by experts, the Cultural Relic Press published a new edition of Sun Bin's Art of War, divided into two volumes, each containing 15 chapters, from the 364 bamboo slips, with a total of 11,000 words. After a decade of textual research and study, the Cultural Relic Press made a major adjustment to the book: the second volume was no longer considered to be Sun Bin's writings; the first volume was edited and one chapter detailing five types of training was added. The current edition of Sun Bin's Art of War contains 16 chapters from 222 bamboo slips, with a total of 4891 words. Contents =Chapter 1 : Capturing Pang Juan= Describes the four stratagems employed in the Battle of Guiling: #A southward march at the initial stage of the war, to avoid a decisive battle with Pang Juan #Launching a false attack and feigning retreat and defeat in Pingling, which reinforced Pang Juan's determination to attack Handan #Direct advance on Kaifeng (capital city of the Wei state) to force Pang Juan to turn back to rescue Wei #Ambush at Guiling to destroy the enemy in one move =Chapter 2: Meeting King Wei= Sun Bin discusses with King Wei of Qi about war and states: \\"Only victory in war can bring about authority and prosperity\\". Sun believes that the historically progressive unification accomplished in war had been an important means of facilitating the submission of feudal lords. To start a war, one must have \\"a storage of materials, a just cause for war\\" and must \\"be well-prepared before launching an attack\\". Sun also pointed out that \\"Warmongers will inevitably lose and those who expect to make a fortune out of war will also suffer defeat and disgrace\\". =Chapter 3: King Wei asks for advice= Sun Bin advises King Wei and Tian Ji, engaging them in a comprehensive discussion on his basic thoughts about strategy and tactics. The chapter focuses on resolute attacks on weakly defended key enemy positions and on the military philosophy of using Tao and flexible principles to attain victory. =Chapter 4: Tian Ji asks how to construct a defence= Set in the Battle of Maling, Sun Bin and Tian Ji discuss the problems of battlefield positions in field operations. The combination of terrain, weapons and the types of soldiers is emphasized. =Chapter 5: Selection of the best soldiers= Comments on the basic principles of building and training an army, and on the factors of field command that will determine victory or defeat. On the topic of building an army, Sun Bin focuses on the employment of the best soldiers in terms of field command. He stresses 'five factors that will lead to constant victory': #The commander who has won the sovereign's trust and has an independent command will win. #The one who knows the art of war will win. #The one who gets uniform support from his soldiers will win. #The one whose subordinates work in concert with each other will win. #The one who is good at analysing and utilising terrain will win. There are also five corollaries that will lead to constant defeat: #The one whose command is constrained by the sovereign will be defeated. #The one who does not know the art of war will be defeated. #The one who does not have the support of his soldiers will be defeated. #The one whose subordinates do not work in harmony will be defeated. #The one who does not know to use spies will be defeated. =Chapter 7: Eight formations= Discusses the methods of a commander and the principles of battle formation. It emphasises that a commander must \\"be well versed in both meteorology and geography. He also must get the support of his people at home, while understanding the actual situation of his enemy. In a direct battle, he knows well the basic points of the eight formations. If one is sure of victory he will fight; if unsure he should not fight.\\" Sun Bin also emphasises \\"that in laying a formation, the army can be divided into three divisions. In each, the best soldiers should be placed as a vanguard and every team should be followed with a sustainable reserve.\\" He emphasises \\"dividing the army into three teams\\" and \\"engaging one team in battle in while leaving the other two strictly in defence.\\" Sun Bin says that an army must take an advantageous geographical position to attack enemy in a less defensible position. \\"When land is flat there should be more armed chariots; when terrain is difficult, more cavalry should be sent: and when is narrow and blocked, there should be more archers sent.\\" =Chapter 14: Organisation of military posts= Chapter 14 is similar to military rules and regulations of the later ages. It may be divided into three parts: #Regulations for army organization and command, emphasising that all types of organizations, units and systems must complete and appropriately meet the requirements for battle. #Regulations for military operations under different enemy situations, different terrain, and different climates. Its focus is to emphasize flexibility in command and in the employment of soldiers, and on the need to make decisions according to the situation. #Specific rules on marching, camping, patrolling, guarding, war preparations and logistics.

(1995). Above the Clouds: Status Culture of the Modern Japanese Nobility, p. 218; Shirane, Haruo et al. (2000). Inventing the Classics: Modernity, National Identity, and Japanese Literature, p. 113. Many cultured women gathered as wives of Emperors, and court ladies, as well as the maids for these women; court officials often visited these women for influence, literary charm, or romances. Significant contributions to the literature of Japan were created in the K≈çky≈´ during this period: works such as The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu, The Pillow Book by Sei Sh≈çnagon, and many anthologies of waka poems. Conflated definitions The term \\"Dairi\\" refers not only to the buildings in which the Japanese Imperial family resided; it also refers indirectly to the women of the Imperial family (the K≈çky≈´), to the Imperial court of Japan, or as an indirect (now archaic) way of referring to the Emperor himself. The \\"Dairi\\" -- schematic plan of the Heian-ky≈ç \\"Inner Palace\\" within the \\"Greater Palace\\" of the Imperial compound in Kyoto The \\"Dai-Dairi\\" -- schematic plan of the \\"Greater Palace\\" within the Imperial complex of official structures and kuge residences The names of the several gates in the walls surrounding the Imperial grounds refer not only to the specific wall-openings themselves; these names were also used to refer indirectly to a nearby residence of an empress whose husband had abdicated, or as an indirect way of referring to the Empress Dowager herself, e.g., , whose official home, after the abdication and death of Emperor Takakura, was located near the Kenrei Gate. In this same way, the term k≈çky≈´ has multiple meanings, referring to the group of buildings situated near the sovereign's personal apartments where the consorts resided, and also describing the staff of female palace officials assigned to the service of those consorts. More broadly, the term k≈çky≈´ could be used in identifying the array of consorts below the empress.Lebra, p. 219. Structure The structure of the royal household and ranks for court ladies were defined in Taih≈ç Code and Y≈çr≈ç Code. In these Codes, there were originally to have been twelve sections, and the various ranks for ladies' of the Imperial household within the K≈çky≈´ were defined. Fine distinctions were collapsed or expanded in a gradual re-organization which became formalized during the Heian period. For example, in 806, Emperor Heizei elevated the former Fujiwara no Tarashiko (Ëó§ÂéüÂ∏ØÂ≠ê) (?-794), also known as Taishi, by giving her the Imperial title of K≈çg≈ç or empress. This occurred 12 years after her death, and it became the first time this posthumously elevated rank was bestowed.Ponsonby-Fane, P. 318; Many of the court ranks which were not defined in either the Taih≈ç or Y≈çr≈ç Codes have been in continuous use in the centuries following the early Heian period. =Imperial Wives= * Emperor's Wives ** K≈çg≈ç (ÁöáÂêé) (1 person): Empress Consort; also, K≈çk≈çg≈ç (ÁöáÂêéÂÆÆ).Titsingh, Isaac.

Relations soured even more after Bolivia lost its coast to Chile during the War of the Pacific and became a landlocked country (Bolivia still claims a corridor to the Pacific Ocean). Chile and Bolivia have maintained only consular relations since 1978, when territorial negotiations failed and Bolivia decided to sever diplomatic relations with Chile. However, in spite of straining relationship, Chile and Bolivia still have economic treaties supporting tourism and cooperation; therefore, trading between two nations is not affected by the territorial dispute. In 2019, Chile's government expressed concern for the \\"disruption\\" of the electoral process in Bolivia following the forced resignation of then- President Evo Morales. Historical relations =Relations following independence from Spain (1818-1828)= When Chile and Bolivia gained independence from Spain in 1818 and 1825 respectively, both countries established their borders using the uti possidetis principle. The origins of the dispute came from the borders established in the Spanish Empire that just defined the Atacama desert as the northern border of the Captaincy General of Chile. Bolivian and Chilean historians disagree on whether the territory of Charcas, originally part of the Viceroyalty of Peru, later of the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata and ultimately of Bolivia, included access to the sea. Supporting their claims with different documents, Bolivians claim that it did, while Chileans disagree. When Sim√≥n Bol√≠var established Bolivia as a nation in 1825, he claimed access to the sea at the port of Cobija, disregarding overlapping claims by Chile, which claimed that it bordered Peru at the Loa River and that Bolivia was therefore landlocked. =Santa Cruz and the War of the Confederation (1829-1839)= Andr√©s de Santa Cruz became President of Bolivia in 1829 and intervened militarily in Peru, leading to the creation of the Peru-Bolivian Confederation in 1836. Chilean minister Diego Portales perceived the confederation as a threat to Chilean interests and the balance of power in the region. Chile declared war in 1836 followed by Argentina in 1837; both countries were supported by Peruvian dissidents. The war began with victories by the Confederation over its enemies. A turning point took place on the fields of Paucarpata where the Peru-Bolivian Confederation led by Santa Cruz forced the Chilean and Peruvian rebel armies to sign the peace treaty known as the Paucarpata Treaty, which included their unconditional surrender; later this treaty was rejected by the Chilean parliament. The Peruvian rebels and the Chilean army set off on a new campaign against Santa Cruz, defeating the Confederation on the fields of Yungay. The confederation was dissolved in 1839. This was a turning point in Bolivian history because, for nearly 60 years afterwards, coups and short-lived constitutions dominated Bolivian politics. =Border and economic treaty (1866-1874)= Bolivian-Chilean national borders had not been agreed upon until 1866, when the two countries had negotiated a treatyTratado de l√≠mites de 1866 entre Bolivia y Chile that established the 24th parallel south as their boundary. In Chile, the territories recognised as Bolivian on the Pacific coast were seen as ceded, while in Bolivia they were seen as finally recognised by Chile as Bolivian. This treaty also entitled Bolivia and Chile to share tax revenue on mineral exports out of the territory between the 23rd and 25th parallels. The area between the 25th and 23rd parallels would also remain demilitarized. A second treaty in 1874 superseded this, entitling Bolivia to collect full tax revenue between the 23rd and 24th parallels, but fixed tax rates on Chilean companies for 25 years. At the time, most economic exploitation of the coastal region was being conducted by Chilean companies and British interests under the aegis of Chile's more robust economy and more stable institutions. Bolivia subsequently became dissatisfied at the arrangement due to the negative financial status of the national budget, especially after the earthquakes that struck Cobija in 1868 and 1877. This was the only small coastal town founded by Bolivians. =War of the Pacific (1879-1904)= Tacna, occupied by Chile from 1880 to 1929. Mural in San Pablo de Tiquina, Bolivia, declaring \\"What once was ours will be ours again\\" and \\"Hold on, rotos (Chileans): here come the Colorados of Bolivia\\" In 1879, Bolivian dictator General Hilari√≥n Daza increased the taxes on the exportation of saltpeter in violation of the 1866 treaty. When Chilean-owned saltpeter companies refused to pay, Daza expropriated the companies and sold them in a public auction. Daza then put an end to all commerce with Chile and exiled all Chilean residents in Bolivia (the Bolivian port of Antofagasta had more Chileans than Bolivians). In response, Chile declared the border treaties null and reactivated its old claim that Chile had inherited a land border with Peru using the uti possidetis principle. Chile disembarked troops at Antofagasta the day of the auction. Later, Chile declared war on Bolivia and occupied Bolivia's coast. Peru had, in 1873, signed a secret pact with Bolivia in which the two countries agreed to fight together against any nation that threatened either of them. When Peru refused to be neutral in the conflict between Chile and Bolivia, Chile declared war on Peru. Chile defeated both countries and annexed the coast claimed by Bolivia. This was ratified by Peru in the Treaty of Anc√≥n (1883) and by Bolivia in a Treaty of Peace and Friendship signed in 1904. =1904 Bolivia-Chile treaty= =Further negotiations (1964-1978)= Diplomatic relations with Bolivia continued to be strained because of Bolivia's continuing aspiration to have access to the sea. In 1964, Bolivian President V√≠ctor Paz Estenssoro severed diplomatic relations with Chile. Generals Augusto Pinochet and Hugo Banzer resumed diplomatic relations and attempted to settle the territorial disputes. Secret negotiations started in 1973, and in 1975 diplomatic relations between Chile and Bolivia were established. That year, Pinochet and Banzer met in the Bolivian border town of Chara√±a. Pinochet agreed to give Bolivia a small strip of land running between the Chilean city of Arica and the Peruvian border. However the Treaty of Lima between Peru and Chile specified that Chile must consult Peru before granting any land to a third party in the area of Tarapac√°. Peruvian President General Francisco Morales Berm√∫dez did not agree with the Chara√±a proposal and instead drafted his own proposal, in which the three nations would share administration of the port of Arica and the sea immediately in front of it. Pinochet did not agree to this proposal, and Banzer broke ties with Chile again in 1978. The failure of the Chara√±a accords was one of the reasons for Banzer's downfall that very year. Since the 1990s =Bolivian gas conflict= In early 2002, the administration of President Jorge Quiroga proposed to build a pipeline through neighboring Chile to the port of Mejillones, the most direct route to the Pacific Ocean to export Bolivia's newly discovered gas reserves. However, antagonism towards Chile ran deep in Bolivia because of the loss of Bolivia's Pacific coastline to Chile in the War of the Pacific (1879‚Äì1884). Bolivians began campaigning against the Chilean option, arguing instead that the pipeline should be routed north through the Peruvian port of Ilo, 260 km further from the gas fields than Mejillones, or, better yet, first industrialised in Bolivia. According to Chilean estimates, the Mejillones option would be $600 million cheaper. Peru, however, claimed the difference in cost would be no more than $300 million. Bolivian proponents of the Peruvian option said it would also benefit the economy of the northern region of Bolivia through which the pipeline would pass. Supporters of the Chile pipeline argued that US financiers would be unlikely to develop processing facilities within Bolivia. Meanwhile, the Peruvian government, eager to promote territorial and economic integration, offered Bolivia a special economic zone for 99 years for exporting the gas at Ilo, the right of free passage, and the concession of a 10 km¬≤ area, including a port, that would be exclusively under Bolivian administration. President Jorge Quiroga postponed the decision shortly before leaving office in July 2002 and left this highly contentious issue to his successor. It was thought that Quiroga did not want to jeopardize his chances of re-election as president in the 2007 elections. After winning the 2002 presidential election, Gonzalo S√°nchez de Lozada expressed his preference for the Mejillones option but made no \\"official\\" decision. Despite this, a consortium called Pacific LNG was formed to exploit the newly discovered reserves. The consortium comprised the British companies BG Group and BP, and Spain's Repsol YPF. Repsol is one of three companies that dominate the gas sector in Bolivia. The other two are Petrobras and Total. A plan costing US$6 billion was drawn up to build a pipeline to the Pacific coast, where the gas would be processed and liquefied before being shipped to Mexico and the United States (Baja California and California) through a Chilean port, for example Tocopilla. Lozada's 2003 deal was heavily opposed by Bolivian society, in part because of nationalistic resentment against Chile, and the Gas War led to Lozada's resignation in October 2003. Lozada's successor, Carlos Mesa, held a gas referendum with the question: \\"Do you agree with President Carlos Mesa's policy of using gas as a strategic resource to achieve a sovereign and viable route of access to the Pacific Ocean?\\" The referendum was approved with 54.79% of the votes saying \\"yes\\". Mesa even took the question about a sea access to the OAS where he had a discussion with Chilean president Ricardo Lagos, who said that it was a bilateral topic. Mesa resigned following the 2005 Hydrocarbons Law. Evo Morales, who was elected president in 2005, is strongly opposed to having a foreign consortium export Bolivia's natural gas without processing it domestically. He argued it should be used domestically to help Bolivia, the poorest country in South America. Chile and Bolivia maintain consular relations and appear to have become friendlier. Former Chilean President Ricardo Lagos attended the inauguration of current Bolivian President Evo Morales. In 2015, Morales announced his intention to establish conditional diplomatic relations with Chile in order to achieve Bolivia's aspiration for sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean via Chilean land. Chile, on the other hand, wants unconditional diplomatic relations. The dispute with Chile was taken to the International Court of Justice. The Court ruled in support of the Chilean position, and declared that although Chile may have held discussions about a Bolivian corridor to the sea, the country was not required to negotiate one or to surrender its territory.

Kingscavil had a quarry located in it. Sandstone quarried from Kingscavil was used to construct Linlithgow Palace.

The full name of the jurisdiction is the Autonomous Orthodox Metropolia of Milan, Aquileia, Western Europe and Canada. History The diocese was granted a tomos of autonomy in 1978 from Archbishop Auxentios in order to pursue missionary work among the non-Eastern- Orthodox people of the West. The title of the synod at this time was the Metropolia of Western Europe. After the transfer of its first chief hierarch, Metropolitan Gabriel of Portugal, to the autocephalous Church of Poland, Bishop Evloghios of Milan was chosen as second chief hierarch and elevated to the rank of metropolitan. Metropolitan Evloghios remained at the helm of the holy synod of bishops of the Church of Milan until his death on January 20, 2019, which comprises four dioceses in Europe, as well as missionary deaneries in England, Spain, France, South Africa, and the United States. Western Rite communities exist within the Holy Synod of Milan, though the principal rite is the Byzantine Rite of the Eastern Orthodox Church, celebrated most commonly in the Slavic style but in some parishes in the Greek style. In 1989, Archbishop Evloghios was in full communion with Metropolitan Mstislav, the primate of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church United States and later the Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kiev Patriarchate. Full communion with the Kiev patriarchate ceased in 2006 before the condemnation of Patriarch Filaret of Kiev from Moscow. The title reconfirmed by Patriarch Volodymyr through a new tomos of autonomy (1994) is Archbishop of Milan and Longobardy - Metropolitan of Aquileia, Western Europe and Canada. In 1990, Archbishop Evloghios was elevated as metropolitan of the Holy Synod of Milan. In 1990, Metropolitan Evloghios became member of the Holy Synod of the Patriarchate of Kiev; In 1993, Metropolitan Evloghios obtained the Tomos of Autonomy for the Holy Synod of Milan from the hands of Patriarch Volodymyr. In 1995, Metropolitan Evloghios participated to the election of the new Patriarch of Kiev (Filaret (Denisenko). A month after the enthronement of Patriarch Filaret, Evloghios consecrated Volodymir as bishop of St. Julius island. In 1997, following a breakdown in their relationship with the Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kiev Patriarchate, the Milan Synod added two archdioceses in the United States, with an Archbishop of New York and an Archbishop of Texas. In February 2011, the archbishops in the United States were granted a tomos of autonomy by the Holy Synod of Milan, which included the British deanery. Formal communion ceased between the American church, the Autonomous Orthodox Metropolia of North and South America and the British Isles, and the Holy Synod of Milan in April 2011. In September 2013 the tomos of autonomy granted to the archbishops in the United States was definitively suspended by the Holy Synod of Milan in Decree No. 639, along with the official suppression of the bishopric of New York and its metropolitan. In October 2013, the Holy Synod of Milan began to take steps to reorganize the American church with the establishment of a new deanery under the direct supervision of Bishop Voldimir, the Bishop of Class and St. Julius Island and the chairman of external church relations, and named him Exarch for the new Western Rite Exarchate worldwide. However, by December of that year members of the Synod decided to terminate their support of the Orthodox Western Rite by closing the deanery and newly established Exarchate. =Ecclesiastical status= As with all of the Old Calendarist jurisdictions, the Milan Synod was not in communion with mainstream Eastern Orthodox churches.

Its primary function is to help clinicians identify the best available evidence with which to answer clinical questions. Its roots are firmly in the world of evidence-based medicine. History The site was created in 1997 as a search tool to help the staff of ATTRACTATTRACT answer clinical questions for GPs in Gwent, South Wales. Shortly afterwards Bandolier highlighted the Trip Database and this helped establish the site. In 2003, after a period of steady growth, Trip became a subscription-only service. This was abandoned In September 2006 and since then the growth in usage has been significant. Originally \\"Trip\\" stood for Turning Research Into Practice, but the system is now simply called Trip. Process The core to Trip‚Äôs system is the identification and incorporation of new evidence. The people behind Trip are heavily involved in clinical question answering systems (e.g., NLH Q&A; Service). Therefore, if resources are identified that are useful in the Q&A; process they tend to be added to Trip. Users A site survey (September 2007) showed that the site was searched over 500,000 times per month, with 69% from health professionals and 31% from members of the public. Of the health professionals around 43% are doctors. Most users come from either the United Kingdom or the United States. In September 2008 the site was searched 1.4 million times. To date the site has been searched over 100 million times. Recent updates At the end of 2012 Trip had a major upgrade which saw significant new enhancements: * New content - widening the coverage * New design * Advanced search * PICO search - to help users formulate focused searches * Improved filtering * Search history/timeline - recording all a user activity on the site * Related articles Education tracker Trip has an education tracker which allows users to record their activity on Trip which can then be used, subject to local regulations, for revalidation/re-licensing. Future areas of work Trip is exploring numerous innovative technologies to improve the site, these include: * Link out to full-text articles via Trip. * RCT database. * Rapid (within a week) systematic review quality reviews. * Learning from users prior use of the site and that of similar users to improve search results.

Main themes =Overview= * Low-dimensional manifolds are classified by geometric structure; high-dimensional manifolds are classified algebraically, by surgery theory. : \\"Low dimensions\\" means dimensions up to 4; \\"high dimensions\\" means 5 or more dimensions. The case of dimension 4 is somehow a boundary case, as it manifests \\"low dimensional\\" behaviour smoothly (but not topologically); see discussion of \\"low\\" versus \\"high\\" dimension. * Different categories of manifolds yield different classifications; these are related by the notion of \\"structure\\", and more general categories have neater theories. * Positive curvature is constrained, negative curvature is generic. * The abstract classification of high- dimensional manifolds is ineffective: given two manifolds (presented as CW complexes, for instance), there is no algorithm to determine if they are isomorphic. =Different categories and additional structure= Formally, classifying manifolds is classifying objects up to isomorphism. There are many different notions of \\"manifold\\", and corresponding notions of \\"map between manifolds\\", each of which yields a different category and a different classification question. These categories are related by forgetful functors: for instance, a differentiable manifold is also a topological manifold, and a differentiable map is also continuous, so there is a functor \\\\mbox{Diff} \\\\to \\\\mbox{Top}. These functors are in general neither one-to-one nor onto; these failures are generally referred to in terms of \\"structure\\", as follows. A topological manifold that is in the image of \\\\mbox{Diff} \\\\to \\\\mbox{Top} is said to \\"admit a differentiable structure\\", and the fiber over a given topological manifold is \\"the different differentiable structures on the given topological manifold\\". Thus given two categories, the two natural questions are: * Which manifolds of a given type admit an additional structure? * If it admits an additional structure, how many does it admit? :More precisely, what is the structure of the set of additional structures? In more general categories, this structure set has more structure: in Diff it is simply a set, but in Top it is a group, and functorially so. Many of these structures are G-structures, and the question is reduction of the structure group. The most familiar example is orientability: some manifolds are orientable, some are not, and orientable manifolds admit 2 orientations. =Enumeration versus invariants= There are two usual ways to give a classification: explicitly, by an enumeration, or implicitly, in terms of invariants. For instance, for orientable surfaces, the classification of surfaces enumerates them as the connect sum of n \\\\geq 0 tori, and an invariant that classifies them is the genus or Euler characteristic. Manifolds have a rich set of invariants, including: * Point-set topology ** Compactness ** Connectedness * Classic algebraic topology ** Euler characteristic ** Fundamental group ** Cohomology ring * Geometric topology ** normal invariants (orientability, characteristic classes, and characteristic numbers) ** Simple homotopy (Reidemeister torsion) ** Surgery theory Modern algebraic topology (beyond cobordism theory), such as Extraordinary (co)homology, is little-used in the classification of manifolds, because these invariant are homotopy-invariant, and hence don't help with the finer classifications above homotopy type. Cobordism groups (the bordism groups of a point) are computed, but the bordism groups of a space (such as MO_*(M)) are generally not. Point-set The point-set classification is basic‚Äîone generally fixes point-set assumptions and then studies that class of manifold. The most frequently classified class of manifolds is closed, connected manifolds. Being homogeneous (away from any boundary), manifolds have no local point-set invariants, other than their dimension and boundary versus interior, and the most used global point-set properties are compactness and connectedness. Conventional names for combinations of these are: * A compact manifold is a compact manifold, possibly with boundary, and not necessarily connected (but necessarily with finitely many components). * A closed manifold is a compact manifold without boundary, not necessarily connected. * An open manifold is a manifold without boundary (not necessarily connected), with no compact component. For instance, [0,1] is a compact manifold, S^1 is a closed manifold, and (0,1) is an open manifold, while [0,1) is none of these. Computability The Euler characteristic is a homological invariant, and thus can be effectively computed given a CW structure, so 2-manifolds are classified homologically. Characteristic classes and characteristic numbers are the corresponding generalized homological invariants, but they do not classify manifolds in higher dimension (they are not a complete set of invariants): for instance, orientable 3-manifolds are parallelizable (Steenrod's theorem in low-dimensional topology), so all characteristic classes vanish. In higher dimensions, characteristic classes do not in general vanish, and provide useful but not complete data. Manifolds in dimension 4 and above cannot be effectively classified: given two n-manifolds (n \\\\geq 4) presented as CW complexes or handlebodies, there is no algorithm for determining if they are isomorphic (homeomorphic, diffeomorphic). This is due to the unsolvability of the word problem for groups, or more precisely, the triviality problem (given a finite presentation for a group, is it the trivial group?). Any finite presentation of a group can be realized as a 2-complex, and can be realized as the 2-skeleton of a 4-manifold (or higher). Thus one cannot even compute the fundamental group of a given high-dimensional manifold, much less a classification. This ineffectiveness is a fundamental reason why surgery theory does not classify manifolds up to homeomorphism. Instead, for any fixed manifold M it classifies pairs (N,f) with N a manifold and f\\\\colon N\\\\to M a homotopy equivalence, two such pairs, (N,f) and (N',f'), being regarded as equivalent if there exist a homeomorphism h\\\\colon N\\\\to N' and a homotopy f'h \\\\sim f\\\\colon N\\\\to M. =Positive curvature is constrained, negative curvature is generic= Many classical theorems in Riemannian geometry show that manifolds with positive curvature are constrained, most dramatically the 1/4-pinched sphere theorem. Conversely, negative curvature is generic: for instance, any manifold of dimension n\\\\geq 3 admits a metric with negative Ricci curvature. This phenomenon is evident already for surfaces: there is a single orientable (and a single non-orientable) closed surface with positive curvature (the sphere and projective plane), and likewise for zero curvature (the torus and the Klein bottle), and all surfaces of higher genus admit negative curvature metrics only. Similarly for 3-manifolds: of the 8 geometries, all but hyperbolic are quite constrained. Overview by dimension * Dimensions 0 and 1 are trivial. * Low dimension manifolds (dimensions 2 and 3) admit geometry. * Middle dimension manifolds (dimension 4 differentiably) exhibit exotic phenomena. * High dimension manifolds (dimension 5 and more differentiably, dimension 4 and more topologically) are classified by surgery theory. Thus dimension 4 differentiable manifolds are the most complicated: they are neither geometrizable (as in lower dimension), nor are they classified by surgery (as in higher dimension or topologically), and they exhibit unusual phenomena, most strikingly the uncountably infinitely many exotic differentiable structures on R4. Notably, differentiable 4-manifolds is the only remaining open case of the generalized Poincar√© conjecture. One can take a low-dimensional point of view on high-dimensional manifolds and ask \\"Which high-dimensional manifolds are geometrizable?\\", for various notions of geometrizable (cut into geometrizable pieces as in 3 dimensions, into symplectic manifolds, and so forth). In dimension 4 and above not all manifolds are geometrizable, but they are an interesting class. Conversely, one can take a high-dimensional point of view on low-dimensional manifolds and ask \\"What does surgery predict for low-dimensional manifolds?\\", meaning \\"If surgery worked in low dimensions, what would low-dimensional manifolds look like?\\" One can then compare the actual theory of low- dimensional manifolds to the low-dimensional analog of high-dimensional manifolds, and see if low-dimensional manifolds behave \\"as you would expect\\": in what ways do they behave like high-dimensional manifolds (but for different reasons, or via different proofs) and in what ways are they unusual? Dimensions 0 and 1: trivial There is a unique connected 0-dimensional manifold, namely the point, and disconnected 0-dimensional manifolds are just discrete sets, classified by cardinality. They have no geometry, and their study is combinatorics. A connected 1-dimensional manifold without boundary is either the circle (if compact) or the real line (if not). However, maps of 1-dimensional manifolds are a non-trivial area; see below. Dimensions 2 and 3: geometrizable Every connected closed 2-dimensional manifold (surface) admits a constant curvature metric, by the uniformization theorem. There are 3 such curvatures (positive, zero, and negative). This is a classical result, and as stated, easy (the full uniformization theorem is subtler). The study of surfaces is deeply connected with complex analysis and algebraic geometry, as every orientable surface can be considered a Riemann surface or complex algebraic curve. Every closed 3-dimensional manifold can be cut into pieces that are geometrizable, by the geometrization conjecture, and there are 8 such geometries. This is a recent result, and quite difficult. The proof (the Solution of the Poincar√© conjecture) is analytic, not topological. While the classification of surfaces is classical, maps of surfaces is an active area; see below. Dimension 4: exotic Four-dimensional manifolds are the most unusual: they are not geometrizable (as in lower dimensions), and surgery works topologically, but not differentiably. Since topologically, 4-manifolds are classified by surgery, the differentiable classification question is phrased in terms of \\"differentiable structures\\": \\"which (topological) 4-manifolds admit a differentiable structure, and on those that do, how many differentiable structures are there?\\" Four-manifolds often admit many unusual differentiable structures, most strikingly the uncountably infinitely many exotic differentiable structures on R4. Similarly, differentiable 4-manifolds is the only remaining open case of the generalized Poincar√© conjecture. Dimension 5 and more: surgery In dimension 5 and above (and 4 dimensions topologically), manifolds are classified by surgery theory. The Whitney trick requires 2+1 dimensions (2 space, 1 time), hence the two Whitney disks of surgery theory require 2+2+1=5 dimensions. The reason for dimension 5 is that the Whitney trick works in the middle dimension in dimension 5 and more: two Whitney disks generically don't intersect in dimension 5 and above, by general position (2+2 < 5). In dimension 4, one can resolve intersections of two Whitney disks via Casson handles, which works topologically but not differentiably; see Geometric topology: Dimension for details on dimension. More subtly, dimension 5 is the cut-off because the middle dimension has codimension more than 2: when the codimension is 2, one encounters knot theory, but when the codimension is more than 2, embedding theory is tractable, via the calculus of functors. This is discussed further below. Maps between manifolds From the point of view of category theory, the classification of manifolds is one piece of understanding the category: it's classifying the objects. The other question is classifying maps of manifolds up to various equivalences, and there are many results and open questions in this area. For maps, the appropriate notion of \\"low dimension\\" is for some purposes \\"self maps of low-dimensional manifolds\\", and for other purposes \\"low codimension\\". =Low-dimensional self-maps= * 1-dimensional: homeomorphisms of the circle * 2-dimensional: mapping class group and Torelli group =Low codimension= Analogously to the classification of manifolds, in high codimension (meaning more than 2), embeddings are classified by surgery, while in low codimension or in relative dimension, they are rigid and geometric, and in the middle (codimension 2), one has a difficult exotic theory (knot theory). * In codimension greater than 2, embeddings are classified by surgery theory. * In codimension 2, particularly embeddings of 1-dimensional manifolds in 3-dimensional ones, one has knot theory. * In codimension 1, a codimension 1 embedding separates a manifold, and these are tractable. * In codimension 0, a codimension 0 (proper) immersion is a covering space, which are classified algebraically, and these are more naturally thought of as submersions. * In relative dimension, a submersion with compact domain is a fiber bundle (just as in codimension 0 = relative dimension 0), which are classified algebraically. =High dimensions= Particularly topologically interesting classes of maps include embeddings, immersions, and submersions. Geometrically interesting are isometries and isometric immersions. Fundamental results in embeddings and immersions include: * Whitney embedding theorem * Whitney immersion theorem * Nash embedding theorem * Smale-Hirsch theorem Key tools in studying these maps are: * Gromov's h-principles * Calculus of functors One may classify maps up to various equivalences: * homotopy * cobordism * concordance * isotopy Diffeomorphisms up to cobordism have been classified by Matthias Kreck: * M.

But the planned attack was repulsed and soon turned into a siege, which later culminated in the massacre of the remaining emigrants, on September 11, 1857. The Emigrants The Arkansas emigrants, who were later attacked at Mountain Meadows, were traveling to California shortly before the Utah War began. After leaving Arkansas and traveling in several smaller groups these emigrants gathered together near Salt Lake City, Utah and became the Baker-Fancher party. As these emigrants were crossing into the Utah Territory, the Mormons throughout the Territory had been mustered to fight the advancing United States Army, which they believed was intent on destroying them as a people. It was during this period of tension that the Baker-Fancher party passed through the Utah Territory, and soon rumors among the Mormons linked the Baker-Fancher train with enemies who had participated in previous persecutions of Mormons along with more recent malicious acts. After the party was organized they left Salt Lake City on or about August 5, 1857. As they passed through Utah, the emigrants were in need of supplies, but because of the possibility of war many Mormons refused to trade with them; this was one of several problems the emigrants would encounter. When passing through Provo, 40 miles south of Salt Lake City, the emigrants decided to stop and let their animals rest. An area just west of the town had been marked off, by the local settlers, as use for animal feed during the upcoming winter. The emigrants allowed their livestock to wander into this area, and after seeing this the local settlers asked the party to move on to another area a few miles to the west; even offering to help them move. One of the party's leaders refused saying \\"This is Uncle Sam's grass...We are staying right here.\\", so the settlers gave them the option of fighting or leaving; the party left. After camping the night, the Baker-Fancher party continued to pass through Utah over the next few weeks, arriving near Cedar City on Thursday, September 3, 1857. Cedar City was the last major settlement where emigrants could stop to buy grain and supplies before a long stretch of wilderness leading to California.. When the Baker-Fancher train arrived there, however, they were turned a cold shoulder once again; important goods were not available in the town store, and the local miller charged an exorbitant price for grinding grain. As tension between the Mormons and the emigrants mounted, a member of the Baker-Fancher train was said to have bragged how he had the very gun that \\"shot the guts out of Old Joe Smith\\".see Mountain Meadows Massacre Leader in Tietoa Mormonismista Suomeksi.) Other members of the party reportedly bragged about taking part in the Haun's Mill massacre some decades before in Missouri. Others were reported by Mormons to have threatened to join the incoming federal troops, or join troops from California, and march against the Mormons.; Salt Lake City Messenger #88; Mountain Meadows Massacre: An Aberration of Mormon Practice According to one witness, the captain of the emigrant train, Alexander Fancher, rebuked these men on the spot for their inflammatory language against the Mormons. After staying less than one hour in Cedar City, the emigrants passed over Leach's cutoff, passed the small town of Pinto and headed into Mountain Meadows. Here they stopped to rest and regroup their approximately 800 head of cattle. An emigrant wagon train The Mormons The Mountain Meadows Massacre was caused in part by events relating to the Utah War, an 1858 invasion of the Utah Territory by the United States Army which ended up being peaceful. In the summer of 1857, however, Mormons expected an all-out invasion of apocalyptic significance. From July to September 1857, Mormon leaders prepared Mormons for a possible seven-year siege predicted by Brigham Young. Mormons were to stockpile grain, and were prevented from selling grain to any passing emigrants. As far-off Mormon colonies retreated, both Cedar City and nearby Parowan became isolated and vulnerable outposts. Brigham Young sought to enlist the help of Indian tribes in fighting the \\"Americans\\" (the approaching U.S. Army), and allowed them to steal cattle from emigrant trains. In August 1857, Mormon apostle George A. Smith, set out on a tour of southern Utah, instructing Mormons to stockpile grain. He met with many of the eventual participants in the massacre, including William H. Dame, Isaac C. Haight, and John D. Lee. He noted that the militia was organized and ready to fight, and that some of them were anxious to \\"fight and take vengeance for the cruelties that had been inflicted upon us in the States\\". On his return trip to Salt Lake City, Smith camped near the Baker-Fancher party; a traveling partner of Smiths, Jacob Hamblin, suggested the Fanchers stop and rest their cattle at Mountain Meadows. Some of Smith's party claimed to have seen a member of the Baker-Fancher party poison the local Corn Creek and a dead ox, in order to kill Indians; a rumor that would precede the wagon train to Cedar City. Among Smith's party were a number of Indian chiefs from Southern Utah. When Smith returned to Salt Lake, Brigham Young met with these leaders and Jacob Hamblin on September 1, 1857. Brigham Young asked them for their help with fighting the \\"Americans\\" (the advancing United States Army). The Indian chiefs were reportedly reluctant, saying they would let the Mormons fight while they, the Indians, \\"would raise grain.\\" Yet, some scholars theorize, that the Indian leaders returned to Mountain Meadows and participated in the massacre. However, it is uncertain whether they would have had time to do so, as their traveling companion, Jacob Hamblin, did not return home until after the massacre. =Meetings at Cedar City= Today it is believed that the attack against the wagon train was planned by leaders in Iron County; after the Baker-Fancher party had left Cedar City. Several meetings were held in Cedar City and Parowan by the local Mormon Leaders, pondering how to implement Brigham Young's war time directives. At least nine southern Utah militiamen had already been sent out as scouts to the area's emigrant trails and mountain passes, looking for any advance parties of the United States dragoons. Major Isaac C. Haight, Mormon Stake President of Cedar City and second in command of the Iron County militia, sent a letter to William H. Dame, the militia's commanding officer and Stake President of Parowan, asking that the militia be called out against the Baker-Fancher party.James H. Martineau, \\"The Mountain Meadow Catastrophy\\", July 23, 1907, Church Archives, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Dame reportedly denied the request, but told Isaac Haight to let him know if the Fanchers committed any acts of violence. Haight, however, who was of equal rank to Dame in ecclesiastical matters, settled on a secondary plan to use the Native Americans instead of the militia. The plan was to ambush the emigrants in the Santa Clara Narrows, south of Mountain Meadows, and have their Indian allies do the killing. Whether Dame was privy to this plan is a matter of disagreement between the witnesses. According to one report, Isaac Haight said the \\"Indian attack\\" plan was being put in place under the religious authority of the Cedar City Stake, without William H. Dame's authorization as military commander.. John D. Lee, however, said Isaac Haight told him that orders for the \\"Indian attack\\" came from William H. Dame. Philip Klingensmith reported that the orders came from \\"headquarters\\" other than Cedar City, but he was unsure whether that meant Parowan or Salt Lake City.Klingensmith affidavit. Old Spanish Trail Possibly on September 4, 1857,. Lee said this meeting probably took place late on a Sunday, which would be September 6, but because this date would conflict with statements by other witnesses. Haight had a meeting with John D. Lee ordering him to assemble Paiute fighters to head towards Mountain Meadows for the planned attack. Lee was a bishop, a territorial legislator, and a friend to Joseph Smith and Brigham Young, in both of whose service Lee had performed duties as a constable and of personal protection and was rumored to have meted out secret punishments as a Danite as well. Lee's meeting with Haight, according to Lee, took place late at night in Cedar City at the iron works, while they were wrapped in blankets against the cold. In the afternoon of Sunday, September 6, Major Isaac C. Haight held his weekly Stake High Council meeting after church services, and brought up the issue of what to do with the emigrants. The Council believed that there were U.S. Armies approaching from the north and the south, and it was reported at the meeting that the Baker- Fancher party had threatened to \\"destroy every damned Mormon\\", and some of them had claimed to have killed Joseph Smith, and that some emigrants would wait at Mountain Meadows and then join with the approaching armies in a massacre of Mormons.. The plan for an Indian massacre of the Baker-Fancher train was discussed, but not all the Council members agreed it was the right approach. The Council resolved to take no action until Haight sent a rider (James Haslam) out the next day to carry an express to Salt Lake City (a six- day round trip on horseback) for Brigham Young's advice; as Utah did not yet have a telegraph system. Following the Council, Isaac C. Haight decided to send a messenger south to John D. Lee. What Haight told Lee remains a mystery, but considering the Council's decision to wait for advice from Brigham Young, he may have hoped Lee would back off the planned attack. John M. Higbee was directed to command a special contingent of militia drawn from throughout the southern settlements whose initial orders were to coordinate the affair while maintaining a picket around the area's perimeter. Siege (September 7‚Äì10, 1857) One witness claimed John D. Lee, left his home in Harmony on September 6, 1857 in the company of 14 Native Americans and headed toward Mountain Meadows. (statement to Gibbs by Benjamin Platt, an employee at Lee's home who said he did not participate in the massacre). In the early morning of Monday, September 7 . the Baker-Fancher party was attacked by as many or more than 200 Paiutes Lee said the first attack occurred on a Tuesday and the Native Americans were several hundred strong. and Mormon militiamen disguised as Native Americans. Why John D. Lee changed the plans to attack the Wagon Train in the Santa Clara Narrows, and instead attacked at Mountain Meadows several days earlier, remains a mystery. The attackers were positioned in a small ravine south-east of the emigrant camp. This ravine was about five feet deep and had been carved by the headwaters of Magotsu Creek. As the attackers shot into the camp, the Baker-Fancher party defended itself by encircling and lowering their wagons, wheels chained together, along with digging shallow trenches and throwing dirt both below and into the wagons, which made a strong barrier. Seven emigrants were killed during the opening attack and were buried somewhere within the wagon encirclement. Sixteen more were wounded. The attack continued for five days, during which the besieged families had little or no access to fresh water and their ammunition was depleted.. Map of the Meadows by Josiah F. Gibbs According to one report, they attempted to send a little girl to a nearby spring for water, dressed in white, and she was fired upon, but escaped unharmed back to the camp. (statement to Gibbs by Benjamin Platt, a Lee employee, who said he heard details of the massacre from Lee at a church meeting after the massacre). When two emigrant horsemen attempted to retrieve water, one was shot while another escaped, but not before seeing that the shooter was a white man. On September 9, local Mormon leader Isaac C. Haight and his counselor Elias Morris visited Dame in Parowan, where the council decided that the militia would allow the emigrants to pass safely.Andrew Jenson, notes of discussion with William Barton, Jan. 1892, Mountain Meadows file, Jenson Collection, Church Archives After the Parowan council meeting, however, Haight spoke with Dame confidentially, relating the information that the emigrants probably already knew that Mormons were involved in the siege. This information changed Dame's mind, and he reportedly authorized a massacre. The Massacre Following orders from Haight in Cedar City, 35 miles (56 km) away, on Friday, September 11 John Higbee ordered a group of militiamen not in disguise to march and stand in a formal line a half-mile from the Baker- Fancher party,\\"Remembering Mountain Meadows\\", published in the LDS Church's Church News 23 June 2007, with information gleaned from lectures by historians Ron Walker and Richard Turley on a bus tour of the massacre site on 28 May then John D. Lee and William Batemen approached the Baker‚ÄìFancher party wagons with a white flag. Lee told the battle-weary emigrants he had negotiated a truce with the Paiutes, whereby they could be escorted safely to Cedar City under Mormon protection in exchange for leaving all their livestock and supplies to the Native Americans. Accepting this, they were split into three groups. Seventeen of the youngest children along with a few mothers and the wounded were put into wagons, which were followed by all the women and older children walking in a second group. Bringing up the rear were the adult males of the Baker-Fancher party, each walking with an armed Mormon militiaman at his right. Making their way back northeast towards Cedar City, the three groups gradually became strung out and visually separated by shrubs and a shallow hill. After about 1.5 miles (2 kilometers) Higbee gave the prearranged order, \\"Do Your Duty!\\" Each Mormon then turned and killed the man he was guarding. All of the men, women, older children and wounded were massacred by the Mormon militia and Paiutes who had hidden nearby. Approximately seventeen children were spared because of their young age, and were taken in by local Mormon families. All of the Mormon participants in the massacre were then sworn to secrecy.Shirts, (1994) Paragraph 11 The many dozens of bodies were hastily dragged into gullies and other low lying spots, then lightly covered with surrounding material which was soon blown away by the weather, leaving the remains to be scavenged and scattered by wildlife.Shirts, (1994) Paragraph 10 Notes References #Bagley, Will (2002), Blood of the Prophets: Brigham Young and the Massacre at Mountain Meadows, Norman, Oklahoma: University of Oklahoma Press, . #Briggs, Robert H.

He was a pioneer of the movement to protect birds from the plume trade and was a co-founder of the Plumage League. He died on 10 February 1893 and was buried at Nunburnholme, East Riding of Yorkshire, England. Early life Morris was the eldest son of the Royal Navy's Admiral Henry Gage Morris and Rebecca Orpen, youngest daughter of the Rev. Francis Orpen, vicar of Kilgarvan, co. Kerry. Francis Orpen Morris grew up on the western shores of Ireland where he developed an enduring love of the natural world. The whole family relocated to England in 1824. After living for some time in Worcester, they settled in Charmouth, Dorset in 1826. Education At Bromsgrove School his love of natural history grew, and he started a collection of birds and insects. He left school in 1828, spent a year with a private tutor, and enrolled at Worcester College, Oxford. Here he read Classics and was awarded a BA in 1833. Among the subjects he studied was Pliny's Natural History. During this period he met the entomologist James Duncan (1804‚Äì1861), author of British Butterflies. As a student Morris maintained his interest in natural history, and helped organise the insect collection in Oxford's Ashmolean Museum. Church He entered the Church and became curate at Hanging Heaton, near Dewsbury. Then followed his ordaining as Deacon by the Archbishop of York in August 1834. Between 1842 and 1844 he was vicar at Huttons Ambo. In November 1844, he became vicar of Nafferton near Driffield in East Yorkshire, a parish he served for nine years. In 1854 he moved to the Rectory of Nunburnholme, near Market Weighton in East Yorkshire. Here he had ample leisure to pursue his interests in natural history. Writing County Seats of The Noblemen and Gentlemen of Great Britain and Ireland (1870) During his stay at Nafferton, Morris acquired a reputation for writing popular essays on natural history and in particular on birds. His first book was an arrangement of British birds and was published in 1834. About this time he formed a close working association with Benjamin Fawcett (1808‚Äì1893), a local printer. This relationship would last nearly 50 years and have a profound effect on British ornithology. Benjamin Fawcett was arguably the most accomplished of nineteenth century woodblock colour printers. Alpine Accentor. Hand coloured, wood-block print by Alexander Francis Lydon for 'A History of British Birds' by Francis Orpen Morris. First Edition published by Groombridge & Son. London 1850‚Äì57. Printed by Benjamin Fawcett in Driffield. From the collection held by RestoredPrints.com Morris wrote the text for books which were financed and printed by Fawcett, and were illustrated by Alexander Francis Lydon (1836‚Äì1917). Colour printing was a major change from the fine monochrome work of Thomas Bewick (1753‚Äì1828). At first wood-engraving illustrations were coloured by hand, but later a system of colouring from multiple wood blocks was used. Morris' books were mostly published by Groombridge & Sons, of London. His first best-seller was A History of British Birds which was published from June 1850 in monthly parts over a period of some seven years. Each folio consisted of text and 4 hand-coloured plates. Initially only a thousand copies were printed, but surprising demand quickly forced Fawcett to move to larger premises at East Lodge in Driffield. A Natural History of the Nests and Eggs of British Birds, A History of British Butterflies and A History of British Moths followed in rapid succession. The final work which Fawcett, Morris and Lydon would do together was The County Seats of the Noblemen and Gentlemen of Great Britain and Ireland. This appeared in six volumes, each with 40 coloured plates, and text as usual by Morris. Groombridge & Sons dissolved about 1880, with neither Fawcett nor Morris having profited much financially from their collaboration. Personal life In January 1835 he married Anne Sanders, who was the second daughter of Charles Sanders of Bromsgrove, eventually raising a family of 3 sons and 6 daughters. His youngest child, Marmaduke Charles Frederick Morris, was an antiquarian,Morris, M.C.F, 1907, Nunburnholme: Its History and Antiquities, Frowde author and Rector of Nunburnholme after his father.Papers of Rev. M.C.F. Morris and Rev. F.O. Morris, 1842-1931. Hull University Archives, Hull History Centre. GB 50 U DX21 From all accounts Morris was irascible by nature, impatient with conservatism and imbued with the spirit of reform ‚Äì this did not endear him to many people. He had deep-seated convictions on some matters: he was an anti-feminist, loathed fox hunting and any other destruction of wildlife, had an abiding abhorrence of evolution as expounded in Charles Darwin's Origin of Species and a fervent dislike of Thomas Huxley whom he saw as an enthusiastic vivisectionist. Morris was the author of anti-Darwinian pamphlets. He rejected common descent and natural selection, which he believed were absurd concepts unsupported by evidence.Livingstone, David N. (1997). Darwin's Forgotten Defenders. Regent College Publishing. p. 131. Armstrong, Patrick. (2000). The English Parson-naturalist: A Companionship Between Science and Religion. Cromwell Press. p. 7. Morris questioned why proponents of Darwinism were unable to answer such questions as \\"by what act of natural selection was the pouch of the camel formed\\" and \\"how are the electric organs in fishes accounted for by natural selection.\\"Lightman, Bernard. (2007). Victorian Popularizers of Science: Designing Nature for New Audiences. University of Chicago Press. pp. 43-48. In his book Records of Animal Sagacity and Character (1861) he provided \\"abducent evidence\\" for the \\"mental capacities of animals furnished by their actions\\". He wrote that the Bible did not contradict the idea of animal immortality and argued for the possibility of a \\"future resurrection or restoration of the animal creation.\\" He was an early advocate for conservation, campaigning extensively and ultimately successfully for a nature conservation act.Morris, 1897. pp. 135‚Äì155 He founded the Plumage League along with Mrs. R Cavendish-Boyle and Lady Mount- Temple (Georgina Cowper-Temple n√©e Tollemache) in December 1885 with its headquarters at Broadlands, Hampshire. It soon merged into the Selborne League in January 1886 to become the Selborne Society for the Preservation of Birds, Plants and Pleasant Places. His sister Cornelia Morris married Abraham Bower, making their son, Frederick Orpen Bower, Morris's nephew, and probably leading Bower to become a botanist.

To his opinion the Roman Law is strange to the original German law-culture and must be considered as a foreign body.  Life  Estor was born in Schweinsberg (now part of Stadtallendorf, Hesse) and educated at the universities of Gie√üen, Halle, and Jena. He became professor of history and law first in Giessen, then in Jena. He moved to the University of Marburg in 1742. As professor in Giessen he learned natural history from his colleague Joahnn Melchior Verdrie√ü and became national geographer of the county of Hessen-Darmstadt. In this time (around 1730) he came in contact with the famous geographer and physicist Johann Jakob Scheuchzer. Estor died in Marburg in 1773, and was buried in his native Schweinsberg.  Work  The reason for Estor's aversion to the Roman Law is certainly his strong democratic inclination. In his early work Auserlesene kleine Schrifften there are several articles by himself and by other authors in which it is proven that the bondage of the peasants, which was in practise at his time, meant nothing more or less than slavery. One article deals with the fate and status of the slaves in ancient Rome and here parallels become evident. One of his most impressive works is Freiheit der teutschen Kirchen, where he describes the constant struggle between the Roman-German emperors and the popes since the Pope Gregory VII. in the 11th century. In contrast to the popes the Roman-German emperors had no absolute power and the highest authority in the Holy Roman Empire was not the emperor, the Kaiser, but the Reichsversammlung (Imperial Assembly), especially its most prominent members, the \\"Kurf√ºrsten\\" (Electors) whose task was to elect the Kaiser. So the constitution of the Holy Roman Empire was democratic in a wider sense in contrary to the ancient Roman Empire, which was autocratic and where the princeps or Imperator Augustus possessed absolute power. Estor illustrates this fact in \\"Neue kleine Schriften\\", Vol. 1 page 526 by describing the controversy about the Chapter 5 of the \\"Aurea Bulla\\", the constitution of the Holy Roman Empire. A large number of public law teachers of Estor's time, who were adherents of the Roman Law, thought that the authors of this constitution must have been insane, because this chapter deals with the case, when the Kaiser is discharged and is going to be accused of a crime. These romanists thought that the impeachment of an emperor had to be considered as a contradictio in adiecto, a contradiction in itself. But to Estor's point of view this chapter 5 was typical for the democratic character of the Holy Roman Empire and for the role of the Kaiser as the first Representative of the Reichsversammlung. Very interesting is, what Estor says in \\"Freiheit der teutschen Kirchen\\" about Pope Gregory VII. Contrary to the legend, that this powerful pope stemmed from the noble family Aldobrandeschi, Estor claims, that he was the son of a blacksmith in Saona in the Italian county of Toscana and that his full name was Hildebrand Bonizi. Apparently he was completely different from his father, a small and tiny person. His father forced him in his youth to cut wood for the fire, which Hildebrand hated as hell. So he decided to become a prominent and powerful person. In the Germany of the 11th century he was called later \\"Pabst Hildebrand H√∂llenbrand\\" (Hildebrand Hellfire). Estors version of Hildebrands origin is much more probable than the legend mentioned above, because Estors arguments are based on a whole library, as is mentioned in the foreword of his \\"Freiheit ..\\".  Discovery of the Sprites (lightning)  In the second volume of his \\"neue kleine Schriften\\", pages 195/6, there is a little note, in which Estor says that he had explored the landscapes of Hessen-Darmstadt on horseback or walking to accomplish a book about the national geography of this county. This was in the years around 1730. His teachers Verdrie√ü and Johann Jakob Scheuchzer had given him a hint, to make observations \\"coelo tristi\\" (in a sad sky). rightrightSo, following this hint, he one day went uphill one of the highest mountains in the Vogelsberg near Burgharts, called \\"the saddle\\", through a thundercloud. In the middle of the cloud he felt little water droplets on his skin like dew. And as he had reached the top of the mountain, he saw the blue sky above him and the cloud beneath like a white sea, from which flashes mounted as well directly up into the sky (sprite (lightning)) and shot down to the earth.

Born in 1910 in Cosmopolis, Washington, Bennett grew up and worked on the Washington coast, attended art school at the age of 36 and by 1956 became a full-time artist making serigraphs or silk screen prints. He continued working until his death with his wife in 1974 in a commercial plane crash. Style Bennett chose the silkscreen medium because of his belief that original art should be accessible to everyone. Prints allowed him to produce many original silkscreens at relatively affordable prices. Despite the fact that his prints now sell for hundreds or thousands of dollars, according to his daughter during his lifetime he never sold one for more than $15. Using silkscreens allowed him to vary the work by changing the colors and recombining or reusing elements to the point where a work was never finished and continually evolving - he could always tinker with it and improve it more. For example, a catalog of his artwork might include multiple images of a scene such as \\"Around the Cape\\" using different color pallets, such as blues, gold, greens, etc. or the same middle-background sailing ship may appear in multiple scenes such as \\"Down to the Sea\\", \\"Return to the River\\", and \\"Forest of Spars\\". Subjects The coast of the Pacific Northwest, the sea, ships, and landscapes that Bennett grew up with and worked among were his primary subjects. People are relatively rare, and almost never the main subject, appearing as silhouettes on shore or on a ship. Often the rain and weather of the north pacific coast are nearly as prominent as the main subject. These elements often contribute to a peaceful loneliness in the images. The subjects also very much reflect the technology of the early period of his life. Tall ships, steam ships and old lumber mills are often featured in his prints. Sometimes the transition in technology is represented, as with the steam tug-boat pulling the sailing ship in \\"Down to the Sea\\" or the inboard-powered, double-ended fishing troller passing the schooner going the opposite direction in \\"Journey into Silence\\".

Background  Blurt was founded in 1979 in Stroud, Gloucestershire by poet, saxophonist and puppeteer Ted Milton along with Milton's brother Jake, formerly of psychedelic group Quintessence, on drums and Peter Creese on guitar. After three albums Creese left the band to be replaced by Herman Martin on synthesizers who, after a year of constant touring left the band, and was replaced by Steve Eagles, former member of Satan's Rats, The Photos and Bang Bang Machine. Shortly thereafter Jake Milton left to be replaced by Nic Murcott, who was subsequently replaced by Paul Wigens. Eagles was replaced by Chris Vine as guitarist from 1990 to 1994, and returned to the band following Vine's departure. Wigens was briefly replaced by Charles Hayward between May and October 2001 before returning to the band, before departing the band for good in 2005. His replacement was Bob Leith (of Cardiacs), who stayed with the band until 2008, at which time he was replaced by the band's current drummer Dave Aylward. Most of Blurt's compositions feature simple, repetitive, minimalistic guitar and/or saxophone phrases, but they can also explore more abstract musical territories, often serving as an atmospheric backdrop for Ted Milton's existentialist poetry.

It was first released in the United Kingdom by Collins in 1976 and later in the same year by Doubleday in the United States. Plot A team of criminals led by mastermind Peter Branson kidnaps the President of the United States and his two guests from the Middle East, a prince and a king, on San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge, in a masterfully conceived and clockwork-timed operation. Branson and his men block off both ends of the bridge, wire it with explosives, and demand half a billion dollars and a full pardon for themselves. Any rescue attempts will result in the detonation of the explosives, which will kill the President (and his guests) and destroy the Golden Gate Bridge. However, Branson is an egomaniac, and he cannot resist attention from the media. So he invites the press to stay on the bridge and cover the story. Aware that the FBI will have placed agents among them, he takes the precaution of searching them and removing the armed ones. However, Hagenbach (the FBI's dour but extremely adept head agent) has an ace in the hole: a hand-picked special agent, Paul Revson, who was equipped with only a camera. Allowed to remain on the bridge, Revson sets out to foil Branson's plans and rescue the President. With the help of a doctor and a female journalist, Revson gets a message to his superiors, suggesting various courses of action: supplying drugged food to the terrorists, placing a submarine under the bridge, and trying to neutralize the terrorists' equipment with a laser beam. He also arranges for several carefully disguised weapons and gadgets to be smuggled to him. Working on both ends, Revson, Hagenbach, and those working with them unleash their own carefully conceived plans.

Rustemi was the leader of both democratic organisations \\"Atdheu\\" and \\"Bashkimi\\", and also a member of the democratic opposition in the Albanian National Assembly preceding the Revolution of June 1924. He is also known for assassinating Essad Pasha Toptani. Early life Rustemi was born in Libohov√´, in a patriotic family of landowners with ancient progressive traditions who were born into the Bektashi faith. He attended secondary school in Janina (Ioannina) and Istanbul. In 1908, at only 13 years of age, he abandoned school to join the guerrilla group of √áer√ßiz Topulli and in 1910 he attempted the assassination of the Ottoman army general of expedition, Turgut Pasha in Shkod√´r. In 1912-13, he studied at a teacher training college in Geneva and returned to Albania in 1914 where he served as a volunteer fighter against the Greek chauvinist forces in southern Albania during the Occupation of Albania (1912‚Äì1913). In 1915, he studied at a Jewish school in Janina (Ioannina) run by the Alliance Isra√©lite Universelle. In 1917 he taught school in Tepelen√´ and Vlor√´, and than in early 1919, Rustemi began further studies at the Arberesh College of Saint Adrian in San Demetrio Corone in Calabria. In the spring of 1919 in San Demetrio Corone, he formed the League of the Albanian Youth () for the defence of the Albanian nation.Jan Myrdal, Gun Kessle Albania defiant (1976) page 105, 107, 112 After a stay in Rome, he returned to Vlor√´ in the spring of 1920 and to the political chaos reigning in Albania. It was there, after contact with certain individuals who were no doubt supporters of those in power, that he was encouraged to assassinate Essad Pasha Toptani, who was scheming to overthrow the new and unstable government. Essad Pasha was regarded as a traitor for having murdered Hasan Riza Pasha, commander of Shkod√´r, in April 1913, and for turning the fortress of Shkod√´r over to Montenegro. Assassination of Essad Pasha Essad Pasha was in Berlin and was hoping to return to Albania at the head of a new government or, indeed, as the country's monarch. On 21 May 1920, Avni Rustemi travelled to Rome and continued from there to Paris, pursuant to his instructions. Three weeks later, on 13 June 1920, he shot and killed Essad Pasha Toptani, who was leaving the Hotel Continental in Paris. Albanian historians characteristically give lofty patriotic motives for the spectacular deed, which caught the attention of the French and European press. Rustemi was acquitted of the crime before a French court on 2 December 1920. The assassination was largely seen as a heroic act, as it has historically been seen as a signal of a new bourgeois and a peasant revolution against the feudal traditions of Albania and a crossing bridge in the newly democratic-petite bourgeois values.Miranda Vickers The Albanians: a modern history IB Tauris (2006) page 96 Political career On his return to Albania later that month, he was lauded as a national hero and entered the political arena. In April 1921, he took part in the founding in Vlora of the Atdheu (Fatherland) society and, when he founded Bashkimi (Unity) society on 13 October 1923,Vladimir Viktorovich Aleksandrov Essays in contemporary history, 1917-1945(1989) page 86 Rustemi was chosen for parliament with the support of Bajram Curri as deputy of HASI and came to lead the democratic forces of Fan Noli, Bajram Curri and Sulejman Delvina in an increasingly-bitter struggle with the conservative landowners under Ahmet Zogu. On 23 February 1924, Rustemi was involved in an attempt to assassinate Zogu. Death Avni Rustemi, monument in Tirana On April 20, 1924, he was shot in Durr√´s Road in Tirana by a miller called Jusuf Re√ßi, an agent of Zogu, and died two days later of his wounds. His widely attended funeral in Vlora on 30 April gave rise to the anti-government demonstrations that led to the Noli Revolution and the rise to power of Fan Noli in June 1924. Ideology Avni Rustemi was an eminent democratic activist and ideologist. His ideology, expressed through different forms of speeches and journalism, became a strong weapon for the democratic Albanian youth. He claimed that \\"when the government does not fulfill the needs of the people, then this need must be fulfilled with the organised interest of people to push government to do so.'\\" For the solution to the country's crisis, he pointed at the development of the independent national economy. He is quoted saying that \\"Without an independent economy, there can be no independent politics.\\" His ideology was further enforced in the National Assembly of 1924; he became a deputy of the people from ex-prefecture of Kosovo. He bravely criticized the bureaucratic system of that time and the ignorance of the governing classes and fiercely defended traditional values and the human rights of the Albanians living in ethnic Albania. Films Avni Rustemi has also been the subject of numerous feature films, in most of them he appears as national hero, who killed the traitor of the nation.

Though once an active air base, it is now mostly used as a helicopter training site. Being one of the oldest airports in the Netherlands, many buildings on the airfield are now listed as monuments. History Map of Deelen, the airbase is the area under the red crossmarks. Deelen Air Base was founded in 1913 as a base for border patrol missions. When the Netherlands surrendered to Germany in World War II, the Luftwaffe started using the field, significantly expanding and upgrading the base. The Focke-Wulf Fw 190, Messerschmitt Bf 110 and Junkers Ju 88 were operated from the airfield, and anti-aircraft guns were installed. A railway from the nearby town of Wolfheze was constructed, initially to facilitate the transport of building materials for a Luftwaffe command bunker and later to supply the base with munitions. It was the headquarters of 1. Jagd Division from May 1942, later re-designated 3. Jagd Division In 1944 the airfield was extensively bombed by Allied forces in preparation for the Battle of Arnhem, and flying activity from the base was suspended by the Germans. The base was reduced to an auxiliary airfield and turned into a depot for V-1 flying bombs. After the war, up until 1950, the Dutch military used Deelen as a storage facility. In 1950, the decision was made to restore Deelen back to an operational air base, and from 1957 to 1963 was the base for the Royal Netherlands Air Force Republic RF-84F Thunderflash photo reconnaissance aircraft. Between 1964 and 1995 the field was used by various lighter aircraft, such as the de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver, Piper J-3, Hiller OH-23 Raven, A√©rospatiale Alouette II / Alouette III and B√∂lkow 105.Museum Vliegbasis Deelen, details from website, visited August 11, 2011.Deelen Research Group, details from website, visited August 11, 2011.

A√©rospatiale Alouette III in special markings for the 75th Anniversary of the Royal Netherlands Air Force at Deelen in 1988.There was less need for the air base after the end of the cold war and in 1995 it was closed as such. The top layer of the runway was removed making it no longer suitable for landings by heavy aircraft. Its designation was downgraded to Military Aviation Site Deelen (Dutch: Militair Luchtvaart Terrein Deelen). However, it has remained in use as a military site for helicopter training and for that reason is frequently visited by various military helicopters, such as the Boeing AH-64 Apache, Boeing CH-47 Chinook and Eurocopter AS532 Cougar. None of these helicopters are based at Deelen however and for that reason the base is only fully operational when exercises take place. The closure of Soesterberg Air Base resulted in a lot more helicopter movements at Gilze-Rijen Air Base, and in order to reduce traffic there it was decided to use Deelen more often as a training site. To facilitate this it was decided to resurface part of the runway and to create a slope for helicopters to practice sloped landings on. The increased importance of Deelen resulted in it once again receiving the designation of Air Base (Dutch: Vliegbasis). There is also glider activity on the field and very nearby there is a second aerodrome used almost exclusively by gliders, Terlet Airfield.

Two cousins, a pair of brothers, also became Liberal MPs: Sir Stuart Samuel, 1st Baronet, a London Justice of the Peace, and Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel, the High Commissioner for Palestine after the Balfour Declaration and eventually Home Secretary. Lily Montagu was also influenced by Claude Montefiore, a reform-oriented philanthropist and scholar. Until the age of 15, she was educated at Doreck College, and privately educated thereafter. In 1893 she founded the West Central Jewish Girls Club (which subsequently merged into the Jewish Girls' Brigade). She was active in social improvement, particularly in respect to unemployment, sweat shops and bad housing. In 1901 and 1902, Montagu lay the groundwork for the establishment of the Jewish Religious Union in London. In February 1902 she arranged the first meeting of the Jewish Religious Union for the Advancement of Liberal Judaism at her sister Henrietta Franklin's house. The Union set up the first synagogue in Liberal Judaism in the UK and helped found the World Union for Progressive Judaism. Montagu was a founding member with her sister of the Jewish League for Woman Suffrage. She sat on the executive committee and led the meetings in prayer. Following the retirement of Leo Baeck, Montagu served for a brief stint (1955‚Äì1959) in her 80s as president of the World Union for Progressive Judaism, before handing the reins over to Solomon Freehof.

These principles have been discovered, tested, and used in practical situations. They provide additional insight into what makes people learn most effectively. Edward Thorndike developed the first three \\"Laws of learning:\\" Readiness,Exercise and effect. Readiness Since learning is an active process, students must have adequate rest, health, and physical ability. Basic needs of students must be satisfied before they are ready or capable of learning. Students who are exhausted or in ill health cannot learn much. If they are distracted by outside responsibilities, interests, or worries, have overcrowded schedules, or other unresolved issues, students may have little interest in learning. For example, we may identify the situation of an academic examination of a school, in which the cause of securing good marks in various subjects leads to mental and emotional readiness of students to do more hard labour in acquiring knowledge. Exercise Every time practice occurs, learning continues. These include student recall, review and summary, and manual drill and physical applications. All of these serve to create learning habits. The instructor must repeat important items of subject matter at reasonable intervals, and provide opportunities for students to practice while making sure that this process is directed toward a goal. But in some or many cases, there is no need for regular practice if the skill is acquired once. For instance if we have learnt cycling once, we will not forget the knowledge or skill even if we aren't exercising it for a long time. Effect However, every learning experience should contain elements that leave the student with some good feelings. A student‚Äôs chance of success is definitely increased if the learning experience is a pleasant one. Primacy Primacy, The instructor must present subject matter in a logical order, step by step, making sure the students have already learned the preceding step. If the task is learned in isolation, if it is not initially applied to the overall performance, or if it must be relearned, the process can be confusing and time consuming. Preparing and following a lesson plan facilitates delivery of the subject matter correctly the very first time. Recency The principle of recency states that things most recently learned are best remembered. Conversely, the further a student is removed time-wise from a new fact or understanding, the more difficult it is to remember. Intensity The more intense the material taught, the more likely it will be retained. A sharp, clear, vivid, dramatic, or exciting learning experience teaches more than a routine or boring experience. The principle of intensity implies that a student will learn more from the real thing than from a substitute. Examples, analogies, and personal experiences also make learning come to life. Instructors should make full use of the senses (hearing, sight, touch, taste, smell, balance, rhythm, depth perception, and others). Freedom Since learning is an active process, students must have freedom: freedom of choice, freedom of action, freedom to bear the results of action‚Äîthese are the three great freedoms that constitute personal responsibility. If no freedom is granted, students may have little interest in learning. Requirements The law of requirement states that \\"we must have something to obtain or do something.\\" It can be an ability, skill, instrument or anything that may help us to learn or gain something. A starting point or root' Laws of Learning Applied to Learning Games The principles of learning have been presented as an explanation for why learning games (the use of games to introduce material, improve understanding, or increase retention) can show such incredible results. This impacts flow and motivation and increases the positive feelings toward the activity, which links back to the principles of exercise, readiness, and effect. Games use immersion and engagement as ways to create riveting experiences for players, which is part of the principle of intensity. Finally, part of the primary appeal of games is that they are fun. Although fun is hard to define, it is clear that it involves feelings such as engagement, satisfaction, pleasure, and enjoyment which are part of the principle of effect.

There are two other 'roads' - Big Street and Little Street (which is now a footpath). The village dates back to around the late 17th century. Its name suggests that the inhabitants came from London - possibly post the outbreak of plague in 1665 or after the fire of 1666 and settled in the fields outside Andover. There have been over one hundred Little Londons (currently there are 12) in the UK and another one just 12 miles away near Kingsclere, Hampshire. There is a village well in Little Street that has been capped and there are several other wells on private properties in the village. Annually there is a Summer Village Fete, annual Christmas light switch on, quiz, and a fireworks night. These are mostly organised by the Little London Playing Field Association. A newly built German all glass Hauf Haus has been recently built and overlooks the village surroundings. In terms of wildlife, the village has a range of bats, birds including night jars, nuthatches and buzzards, and several different types of deer.

It includes hit singles by the group on both the Epic and Imperial labels over a time span of 1965 to 1972. It spent seven weeks on the Billboard 200 charts, peaking at number 156. Content The group's work was initially released on Imperial Records in the United States, then a subsidiary of Liberty Records, until the latter merged with United Artists Records and the Imperial imprint was discontinued. In 1967, the Hollies tsigned with Epic in the U.S., and this compilation appeared six years after the group's previous, featuring hits for Epic as well as several from the Imperial period. Since the group did not figure prominently on the American singles chart until late 1965, this compilation misses songs that had been big hits for the Hollies in the United Kingdom such as \\"Stay,\\" \\"Here I Go Again,\\" and \\"I'm Alive.\\" The album consists of every Top 40 hit enjoyed by the band in the United States with the exception of the number 40 hit \\"Jennifer Eccles\\" from 1968 and their cover of \\"Stop! In the Name of Love\\" from 1983. Nine of the tracks feature founding member Graham Nash during his tenure in the band through 1968. \\"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother,\\" \\"Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress,\\" and \\"Long Dark Road\\" were all released on Epic after his departure. The front cover consists of a collage referring to all twelve tracks. Greatest Hits was reissued on compact disc by Legacy Records on March 26, 2002.

Nanoionic devices were first proposed in 1992: \\"The results obtained show that it is possible to form arrays of electrochemical devices with single elements ~10 nm in size in the films\\". The basis of design of nanoionic devices is the creation of nanostructures with nanoionic parameter Œª / L ~ 1, where L is the size of device structure, and Œª is the characteristic size of specific region where the property of fast ionic transport is realized. ‚ÄúPossibilities to influence on these specific regions < Œª > in a controllable manner may appear in short sized devices‚Äù. Ion - electronic hybrid devices should be considered as a step on a way to the future nanoelectronics-nanoionics (nanoelionics) that was first proposed in 1996. Nanoionic devices have been developed to generate novel functions overcoming limitations of conventional materials synthesis and semiconductor technology. Various physical properties can be tuned and enhanced by local ion transport near the solid/solid interface. Two electronic carrier doping methods can be used to achieve extremely high-density electronic carriers: one is electrostatic carrier doping using an electric double layer (EDL); the other is electrochemical carrier doping using a redox reaction. In general, it is atomistic restructuring near the solid/solid interface.  History  The first hard disk drive (HDD) was made in 1956 by IBM. It weighed nearly 2000 pounds and was . It held 5 MB. It . It was used in IBM's RAMAC 305 computer. As time progressed HDDs were able to store more information and the parts became much smaller. In 1976 the first solid-state drive (SSD) was made by Dataram and could store up to 2 MB. The SSD did not become popular until 2001 when the SSD industry's revenues reached $25 million a year. The reason for this slow growth was that early SSDs were expensive. In 1978 1 GB would have cost $1 million. Even in 2001, Adtron‚Äôs S35PC 3.5‚Äù SSD drive which had 14 GB storage cost $42,000. The idea for nanoionic technology began at Arizona State University in 1992 and in 1996 the nanoionic supercapacitor was the first device to use nanoionics. The first drive to have this technology was invented by Dr. Michael Kozicki at Arizona State University 1996.  Mode of operation  Nanoionic devices rely on the fundamentals of electrochemistry. Currently the hard drives are made up of solid materials which weigh less and generate more power; solids have one polarity for ions that are moving. The ions are what the electrodes are made of. Electrodes are key components in nanoionic devices. Those electrodes can be made out of ZrO2, a metal which is coated in La2NiO4/La2CuO4, or Bi10V4(metal)O26. Where \\"metal\\" is any metal found in the transition metal group like copper. These nanoionic devices are made up of smaller devices that are that are spaced less than a tenth of a nanometer apart. Due to the small distance between the materials in the nanoionic device smaller ions are necessary for the pathway. Metals in the first group of the periodic table are small, but they are too reactive. So there needs to be a compromise between the reactivity of chemicals and size. That is why materials like Cu or Ag fulfill the needs of the nanoionic drives. In the nanoionic device there would be chalcogenide glass with has the metal like gold and an element for group six infused in the glass. This glass is the electrode for the nanoionic. In the oxidation reaction the Ag+ then loses the electron and turns into Ag. This reaction only happens when a switch confirms the reaction to happen and these switches are used for the binary information storage. That binary information storage is where all the data is saved on the hard drive. All this is dependent on the small current of ions, hence the name nanoionic, to allow the reaction to happen.

He was a member of the band Zaiko Langa Langa from 1969 to 1988 and it most successful and prolific songwriter. Musical history =1968-9: Early years = Ombale was a drummer for the rhythm and blues and pop band Zezes (1968‚Äì1969). =1969-80: Zaiko Langa Langa= Ombale joined Zaiko in 1969, two days before the band first public performance. He was brought in by Vieux Otis, a friend of the founding members as a drummer for the pop section of the group. After two years in the band Ombale decided to shift both role and genre, changing from drumming to singing and pop music to Soukous. Zaiko's then-singers Jossart Nyoka Longo, Jules Shungu Wembadio, Anto Evoloko Atshuamo and Simeon Mavuela Somo opposed Omabale singing in the band, ultimately causing him to leave the band. In 1971 he joined his musical idol Tonny Dee in the band Tabou National. Shortly after Tabou National began performing, Zaiko member DV Muanda asked Ombale to rejoin the band. Ombale would only remain in Tabou National for a few more months before returning fully to Zaiko. While Ombale was back in Zaiko, tensions still existed between him and the singers, who considered him difficult to work with . Ombale then shifted his focus to songwriting. Bimi Ombale's first song \\"Joliba\\" was recorded in 1971, and received favorable review and heavy airplay. In 1972 he released \\"Jose-Lina\\" and \\"Mwanza\\" to mixed reviews . However, this year Zaiko also broke into the mainstream with the song \\"Consolation\\" off Efonge Gina, which was awarded best song of the year. By 1973, Zaiko was a successful band on the music charts and revolutionizing the youth music with rhythm Cavacha. Bimi Ombale's song \\"Zena\\" was one of the biggest releases of the year. In 1974, Anto Evoloko became the frontman of the band. However, Bimi Ombale and fellow member Jossart Nyoka were given less space to perform. The two began rehearsing at Bimi Ombale family home. The result of their collaboration were the acclaimed songs \\"Mwana Wabi\\", \\"Mizou\\" and \\"Mbelengo\\". Rising tensions in Zaiko between the frontman and the instrumentalists led to their decision in 1975 to oust Evoloko and the singers in favour of Ombalie and Nyoka. Ombale became the creative heart of Zaiko, writing numerous songs and fronting the band in Nyoka Longo. Zaiko continued their success, and many of the former singers returned to the band. However, a developing rivalry between Ombale and singer Mashakado Mbuta over band leadership came to a head at the end of the year during a live performance on Zairian national television. The two singers fought on air for the microphone and refused to sing and dance at each other songs. Mashakado Mbuta left the band in 1976 to join Yoka Lokole. Un his three years as a singer in Zaiko \\"Bimi\\" will write seven songs, third most prolific writer after \\"Anti Evoloko\\" and \\"Jules Shungu\\" who both have been singers for five years. With a stable lineup, Ombale entered an artistically fruitful era, as Zaiko released songs of his including \\"Ima\\", \\"Likamuisi\\", \\"Aziza\\", \\"Moni Amina\\", \\"Amitie\\", \\"Lolita\\", \\"Misolina\\", \\"Cherie b wabi\\", \\"Kinshasa makambo, \\" diakina\\", \\"didina\\", \\"youyou\\" and many more. In five years Bimi Ombale will write over fifteen songs. =1980-8: Tout choc Anti choc Zaiko Langa Langa= At the beginning of 1980, worried that the large number of musicians meant that the band was losing cohesion, Ombale, Nyoka Longo, Teddy Sukami and DV Muanda decided to suspend all the singers and requested all to reapply for their position. During the changes, founding members Pepe Manuaku and Teddy Sukami also left. To prove they could survive the change, the band was now called Tout choc Anti choc Zaiko Langa Langa. Ombale's hits from the streamlined lineup included \\"La blonde and \\"baby\\". Other Ombale songs released included \\"Mopaya zoba\\", \\"Baby\\", \\"Elima ngando\\", \\"Sandralina\\", \\"Fanny moke\\", and \\"Nibe ya bomwana\\". Ans Bimi Ombale will released part of th√© trio \\" NYOBIWE\\" which was a \\"Bimi Tombale\\", \\" Nyoka Longo\\" ans \\"Papa Wemba\\" th√© hits \\"Mimi la Rwandaise\\" ans \\"Andy Loli\\". The band also toured Europe and Asia. Again \\" Bimi\\" will by far the most prolific songwriter of this era with eight songs in seven years while the band average was of three songs. \\"Bimi Ombale\\" will cement his place as the one man songs factory of Zaiko Langa Langa and all-time most prolific songs writer in the history of Zaiko with over 30 songs in 18 years. =1988-91: Split and Zaiko Familia Dei= In 1988, Zaiko Langa Langa split into the two groups Zaiko Langa Langa Nkolo Mboka and Zaiko Langa Langa Familia Dei. Bimi Ombale led the latter. Bimi Ombale led the dissident fraction of Zaiko Langa Langa called Zaiko Familai Dei, from 1988 to 1991. A leadership quarrel between him and his co-leader Ilo Pablo, forced him to leave the band in 1991. =1991-5: Basilique Loningisa= In 1991, Bimi Ombale created his own band Basilique Lonigisa. He requested the support of Karlito Lassa, a member of the successful Congolese band, Choc Stars. Karlito performed in Basilique Loningisa as a guest and featured in all songs and albums released by the band. The band split in 1995. =1995-2011: Frere Andre= In 1995, Bimi Ombale converted to Christianity. He preferred to be known as Frere Andre.

He played college football at Boston College. Kissell grew up in Nashua, New Hampshire, and attended Boston College on an athletic scholarship. He played there for the 1942 season, when the school's football team made the Orange Bowl but lost to Alabama. He then entered the U.S. Army during World War II, serving in Europe, Africa and the Middle East for three years. He returned to college after the war and played football for two more seasons. Kissell signed with the Bills in 1948 and played there for two years before the AAFC dissolved and the team disbanded. He was then sent to the Browns in a deal orchestrated by coach Paul Brown to acquire former Buffalo players. He played in Cleveland through 1956, interrupted by one year with the Ottawa Rough Riders of the Canadian Football League. He was part of a defensive line that featured Len Ford, Don Colo and Bob Gain, who helped the Browns win NFL championships in 1950, 1954, and 1955. Kissell spent two years away from football after leaving the Browns, returning to play for the Kitchener-Waterloo Dutchmen in Canada for the 1959 season. He then retired from playing and became a junior high school teacher back in Nashua. He died of cancer in 1992. Early life and college Kissell grew up in Nashua, New Hampshire and attended Nashua High School, where he played basketball, track and football in the late 1930s under head coach Pete Chesnulevich. He was named an all-New Hampshire tackle in two of his years at Nashua. He later attended La Salle Military Academy, a private Roman Catholic high school in Oakdale, New York. After graduating, Kissell enrolled at Boston College on an athletic scholarship. He was on a Boston College Eagles football team that finished the 1942 season with an 8‚Äì2 win‚Äìloss record under head coach Denny Myers and lost to Alabama in the Orange Bowl. Kissell then entered the U.S. Army as American involvement in World War II intensified. He was a private stationed at first at Fort Hood in Texas, and played for the base's service football team before being sent to Europe. He spent time at the Ecole Sp√©ciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr in Fontainebleau outside of Paris in 1945, and also served in Africa and the Middle East. Kissell returned to Boston after the war and played as a defensive lineman in the 1946 and 1947 seasons. Professional career Kissell was selected by the National Football League's Los Angeles Rams in the 12th round of the 1947 draft, but instead joined the Buffalo Bills of the rival All-America Football Conference (AAFC) in 1948. Buffalo finished the regular season 7‚Äì7 in a tie with the Baltimore Colts for first place in the AAFC East. After beating the Colts in a playoff, the Bills lost the AAFC championship game to the Cleveland Browns. The Bills finished 5‚Äì5‚Äì2 the following season, losing again to the Browns in a playoff. Kissell was named an All-Pro defensive tackle by the International News Service after the season. The AAFC disbanded at the end of 1949 because of financial struggles stemming from poor attendance and competition over player salaries, and three of its teams ‚Äì the Browns, Colts and San Francisco 49ers ‚Äì were absorbed by the NFL. In 1950, players from the AAFC's defunct teams ‚Äì including the Bills ‚Äì went into a dispersal draft. Kissell, however, was sold along with halfback Rex Bumgardner and guard (American football) Abe Gibron to the Browns in a deal that gave Bills owner James Breuil a 25% share in the team. In the Browns, Kissell joined a team that had won all of the AAFC's four championships behind an offense that featured quarterback Otto Graham, fullback Marion Motley and ends Mac Speedie and Dante Lavelli. Yet while the Browns had been the league's best team, many sportswriters and owners doubted that the team would continue its string of success in the NFL starting in 1950. Cleveland began the season by beating the previous year's NFL champion Philadelphia Eagles and went on to win the NFL championship over the Los Angeles Rams. Kissell finished his education at Boston College in 1950, graduating with a bachelor's degree in education and government. With the Browns, Kissell had a reputation as a mean and exceptionally strong defender playing beside defensive end Len Ford and linebacker Bill Willis under head coach Paul Brown. He was \\"a little bit rowdy\\", teammate John Sandusky later recalled, and once hit a blocking sled in practice so hard that he broke it. Cleveland finished the 1951 season with an 11‚Äì1 record and again reached the championship game, but lost this time to the Rams. Sportswriters named Kissell a second-team All-Pro after the season. The Browns again contended for the NFL championship in 1952 but lost to the Detroit Lions. After that season, Kissell decided to jump to the Canadian Football League, signing with the Ottawa Rough Riders for $9,500 a year plus bonuses ‚Äì $2,000 more than he was making with the Browns. He joined numerous other NFL players, including teammate Mac Speedie, in a player exodus to the CFL, which was trying to build its talent pool by offering better salaries to American players. The move, however, prompted a drawn-out legal case between the Browns and the Rough Riders in the Canadian courts at the beginning of the 1953 season. Kissell was allowed to stay in the Canadian league as the proceedings continued, and the Rough Riders finished the season with a 7‚Äì7 record, falling short of an appearance in the league playoffs. The Browns and Rough Riders settled their differences the following April, agreeing to send Kissell back to Cleveland. Kissell said he had \\"made a mistake\\" by going to the Canadian league and thanked Brown for giving him a second chance. The Browns won two more championships in 1954 and 1955 while Kissell was with the team. He recovered a fumble in the 1954 championship game against the Lions and was part of a defensive front with Ford, Don Colo and Bob Gain that kept the Rams' offense off balance in the 1955 championship game. His last season in Cleveland was in 1956, when the team had its first-ever losing record. Kissell took two years off of football before signing in the summer of 1959 to play for the Kitchener-Waterloo Dutchmen, a Canadian team. Bob Jauron, a coach from Nashua, had been hired to lead the team, which played in the Ontario Rugby Football Union. He played there for one year. Later life and death After his professional career, Kissell went back to New Hampshire and was the recreation director at Spring Street Junior High School in Nashua, later serving as a teacher there until 1985. In 1964, he took a job as line coach for the short-lived Nashua Colts, a team in the semi-pro Eastern Football League. The Colts won the league championship in 1966. Kissell died of cancer in 1992. He had two children. Three of his brothers, Adolph Kissell, Veto Kissell and Ed Kissell, also played professional football.

It combines elements of Persian and Gujarati cuisine. Dhansak is made by cooking mutton or goat meat with a mixture of lentils and vegetables. This is served with caramelised white rice, which is rice cooked in water, whole spices, and caramelized onions. The dal cooked with mutton and vegetables served with brown rice, altogether is called dhansak. The technique of extending a relatively expensive ingredient (meat) by combining it with vegetables and/or lentils in the same recipe is widely employed in Persian cooking (\\"Dhan\\" is Gujarati cereal dish mentioned in Kanhadade Prabandha in 1455 AD; \\"Sak\\" (derived from Gujarati \\"shaak\\" meaning vegetable greens or cooked vegetables). The Gujarati element of the recipe is the liberal use of a variety of Indian spices and condiments, in contrast to the more mellow Iranian recipes. In Parsi homes, dhansak is traditionally made on Sundays owing to the long preparation time required to cook the lentils and vegetables into a mush (in the days before pressure cooking was employed). Dhansak is also always had on the fourth day after the death of a near one. There is no meat consumed for three days after the death of a near one. And dhansak is used to break this abstinence on the fourth day. Hence, dhansak is never prepared on auspicious occasions like festivals and weddings. Ingredients Dhansak is made by cooking mutton cubes with a mixture of various lentils and vegetables. Traditionally, four lentils (arhar dal, Bengal gram or chana dal, red masoor dal and brown masoor dal) are used, but one or more of the lentils may be omitted or substituted. The vegetables include potato, tomato, brinjal, pumpkin and fenugreek leaves: again, substitutions, such as squash for pumpkin, and sweet potato for potato, may be employed: it depends on what vegetables are conveniently at hand. After prolonged cooking in the traditional recipe (or the use of a pressure cooker), the vegetables are more or less homogenised with the lentils, which are also broken down, so that the result is a thick stew rather than a curry. The recipe has evolved over time. The Parsees, who are adherents of Zoroastrianism, came to Western India as religious refugees in the 8th century CE, after the Arab conquest of Persia and the fall of the Sassanid empire in 651 C. They brought with them the tradition of cooking meat with lentils and/or vegetables. However, tomatoes, chilies, pumpkin and potatoes are native to the Americas and were unknown in India until some time after the Portuguese (who in turn got them through trade with Spain) brought them to India in the 16th century CE. The dhansak is flavoured with a spice mixture called \\"dhansak masala\\", which is similar to \\"garam masala\\" except that the spices chosen are more aromatic and sweet rather than pungent. Cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, nutmeg, dried ginger, coriander seed and cumin seed, as well as a pinch of asafetida, are among the spices employed. Onion and garlic are browned to serve as the stew's base, and coriander leaves, green chilli and mint leaves are employed as garnish. While \\"dhansak masala\\" is sold as a ready-made mixture, the individual cook may make the spice mixture from scratch, altering the combination and proportion of spices based on personal preference. Within the Parsi community, dhansak usually contains goat meat or mutton; it is rarely made with other meats, such as chicken, or without meat. International recipe variants for the dhansak sometimes call for pineapple chunks to provide a sweet flavour, but traditional Indian recipes prefer the use of pumpkin, squash or gourd.

The highway runs from MD 28 near Dawsonville east to West Diamond Avenue next to MD 355 in Gaithersburg. MD 117 is an L-shaped highway that connects the rural western Montgomery County communities of Dawsonville and Boyds with Germantown, Gaithersburg, and Interstate 270 (I-270) in the suburban central part of the county. The highway also provides access to Seneca Creek State Park, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and several commuter rail stations along MARC's Brunswick Line, which the highway parallels. MD 117 was the inspiration for the 1971 hit song \\"Take Me Home, Country Roads\\". MD 117 originally consisted of three disjoint segments. The segment from MD 28 to west of Boyds was built in the early 1910s and extended to Boyds in the late 1920s. The two other segments were built west from Germantown and west from MD 124 in Gaithersburg in the early 1930s. MD 117 east of MD 124 was originally part of the latter highway, which was constructed in the early 1910s. The two gaps in MD 117 were filled in the early to mid-1950s before the route between Boyds and Gaithersburg was transferred to county maintenance in the late 1950s. MD 117 was returned to its course from Boyds to Gaithersburg in the mid-1970s and extended to downtown Gaithersburg over what had been MD 124 in the 1980s. The highway was expanded to a four- to six-lane divided highway in parts of Germantown and Gaithersburg by the late 1990s. Route description View east along MD 117 in Blocktown MD 117 begins at an intersection with MD 28 (Darnestown Road) between Dawsonville and Beallsville. The highway heads north as two-lane undivided Bucklodge Road past the historic home Friends Advice, then curves northeast and crosses Bucklodge Branch. MD 117 passes under CSX's Metropolitan Subdivision, which carries MARC's Brunswick Line. The highway curves southeast at its tangent junction with Barnesville Road and assumes that name as it approaches the village of Boyds. At the southern end of MD 121 (Clarksburg Road), MD 117 turns south onto Clarksburg Road and passes under the railroad again adjacent to the Boyds station serving MARC. Just south of the railroad, the highway turns east onto Clopper Road, which parallels the railroad then veers away southeast and crosses Little Seneca Creek. East of Little Seneca Creek, MD 117 enters the suburban area of Germantown. The highway expands to a four-lane divided highway at Kingsview Middle School and intersects MD 118 (Germantown Road), the main street through Germantown that serves the Germantown MARC station. MD 117 gains a third eastbound lane to MD 119 (Great Seneca Highway), where the divided highway ends and soon drops to two lanes as it leaves Germantown. The highway crosses Great Seneca Creek and passes an entrance to Seneca Creek State Park. MD 117 expands to a four-lane undivided highway as it enters the city of Gaithersburg. The highway intersects Metropolitan Grove Road, which leads to the eponymous MARC station. MD 117 expands to a six-lane divided highway west of its intersection with MD 124 (Quince Orchard Road). The highway continues east as West Diamond Avenue along the northern edge of an unincorporated enclave within the city of Gaithersburg. The enclave contains the campus of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, whose main entrance is along MD 117 east of MD 124. East of the federal agency's campus, MD 117 has a partial interchange with I-270 (Eisenhower Memorial Highway). The interchange consists of a straight ramp from the state highway to southbound I-270 and a loop ramp from northbound I-270 to MD 117. Connections with I-270 in the direction of Frederick are made via the freeway's interchange with MD 124 to the north. A park and ride lot is located within the loop ramp from northbound I-270. MD 117 drops to three lanes through the interchange, then expands to a four-lane divided highway again at Perry Parkway. The highway passes south of The Avalon School before it fully re-enters the city of Gaithersburg at its junction with Muddy Branch Road, east of which the highway drops to two lanes and reaches its eastern terminus at MD 117A, an unsigned connector between MD 117 and southbound MD 355 (Frederick Avenue). West Diamond Avenue continues east as a city street that parallels the Metropolitan Subdivision rail line under MD 355. West Diamond Avenue becomes Old Towne Avenue, which intersects Fulks Corner Road--which provides access to northbound MD 355--on its way to downtown Gaithersburg and the Gaithersburg MARC station. MD 117 is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial between MD 118 and MD 119 in Germantown. Cultural significance What is today MD 117 was the inspiration for John Denver's hit song \\"Take Me Home, Country Roads,\\" a song now associated with West Virginia. Songwriters Bill Danoff and Taffy Nivert, who later formed the Starland Vocal Band, wrote much of \\"Take Me Home, Country Roads\\" in December 1970 while working in Georgetown. Danoff and Nivert showed the song to Denver, who helped them finish writing the song. The song was inspired by a drive along Clopper Road to a family reunion in Gaithersburg. Denver, Danoff, and Nivert first performed the song December 30, 1970, at The Cellar Door in Georgetown. \\"Take Me Home, Country Roads\\" became Denver's first major hit after he recorded it in 1971. History The first segment of MD 117 constructed was from the modern MD 117-MD 124 intersection east of Gaithersburg. This segment was one of the original state roads planned by the Maryland State Roads Commission in 1909; the highway later became part of MD 124. This highway was constructed as a macadam road west of Gaithersburg in 1911 and 1912 and within the town of Gaithersburg in 1914. Bucklodge Road from MD 28 near Dawsonville north to the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (now CSX) was constructed as a macadam road by Montgomery County with state aid by 1915. Bucklodge Road was extended as a concrete road to the underpass of the railroad at Boyds east of the southern end of MD 121 in 1928. A disjoint segment of macadam road was laid from MD 118 at Old Germantown west to Schaeffer Road in 1930 and extended west to near Little Seneca Creek by 1933. A third section of macadam road was also built from the modern MD 117-MD 124 intersection west to the hamlet of Clopper east of Great Seneca Creek by 1933. All three segments were later marked as MD 117. MD 117's underpass of CSX's Metropolitan Subdivision rail line viewed from the highway's junction with MD 121 at Boyds MD 117 was widened from from Old Germantown to Little Seneca Creek in 1948. The gap between Old Germantown and Clopper was filled with a modern highway, including the modern bridge across Great Seneca Creek, and was brought into the state highway system in 1951 and 1952. MD 117 became a single highway when the county highway between Boyds and Old Germantown was brought into the state highway system in 1956. However, in 1959, MD 117's eastern terminus was rolled back to the railroad crossing at Boyds. The highway between Boyds and MD 124 west of Gaithersburg was brought back into the state highway system in 1974. The following year, MD 124 was rerouted north along Quince Orchard Road through a cloverleaf interchange with I-270 to MD 355, then southeast concurrent with MD 355 to rejoin its old alignment in downtown Gaithersburg. West Diamond Avenue from MD 124 to MD 355 was assigned MD 924. By 1987, the MD 924 designation was removed--to be used on its current course in Harford County--and replaced with an extension of MD 117. MD 117's partial interchange with I-270 was constructed in 1987; to that point, MD 117's access to I-270 had been indirect via the Interstate's interchange with Quince Orchard Road, which had been built as a county highway concurrent with the freeway in 1956. MD 117 was expanded to a divided highway from west of MD 118 to MD 119 in Germantown and on either side of its intersection with MD 124 in Gaithersburg by 1999. Since at least 1950, West Diamond Avenue had passed under MD 355's bridge across the railroad and met that highway at an oblique intersection. In 1987, MD 355's bridge was replaced with the present bridge and the oblique intersection was replaced with a more gentle curve and right- in/right-out interchange with northbound MD 355. In 1991, access to southbound MD 355 was added via what is now MD 117A. In 2003, the right-in/right-out interchange with northbound MD 355 was removed. Old Towne Road was built as an extension of West Diamond Avenue to Summit Avenue in downtown Gaithersburg. Northbound MD 355 connected with this extension via Fulks Corner Avenue. The piece of MD 117 from the removed ramps to Fulks Corner Road became a short, municipally maintained extension of MD 117. In 2012, MD 117 was truncated at the intersection with MD 117A west of the MD 355 overpass. Junction list Auxiliary route MD 117A is the designation for the unnamed two-lane connector between West Diamond Avenue at MD 117's eastern terminus and a right-in/right-out interchange with southbound MD 355 in Gaithersburg. MD 117A was constructed in 1991.

The State Parole Board's Office of Interstate Services (OIS) monitors the supervision in other states of parolees who were sentenced in New Jersey, and the supervision in New Jersey of parolees who were sentenced in other states. The Office also manages the extradition of absconders from State Parole Board and juvenile parole supervision, as well as escapees from the New Jersey Department of Corrections and the New Jersey Administrative Office of the Courts Intensive Supervision Program (ISP). Special Operations Group (SOG) The Parole Apprehension Team (PAT) conducts investigations to locate parole absconders, and conducts missions to capture them and return them to incarceration. The Parole Apprehension Team members are deputized by the U.S. Marshals Service, with the authority to make arrests outside of New Jersey and return the offender to New Jersey through the extradition process. As members of the U.S. Marshals Service New York/New Jersey Regional Fugitive Task Force, the State Parole Board's Parole Apprehension Team members also aid in the investigations and arrests of fugitives sought by other law enforcement agencies. The Gang Supervision Unit (GSU) members supervise parolees statewide who are known gang members. The Unit uses several aggressive methods to prevent gang violence and recruitment. These include intensive supervision of parolees, and sharing gang intelligence with the FBI, state and local law enforcement agencies. The officers' interaction with these parolees gives them a unique, street-level view of the ways gang membership affects individuals and communities, and the ways gangs attempt to lure young people. Additionally, the Gang Supervision Unit members also conduct gang education and recognition training for hospitals, universities, public schools and municipal police departments, based on up-to-the-minute information collected during their everyday duties. The Gang Supervision Unit also provides Gang Resistance Education and Training (GREAT) programming for elementary school students. Sex Offender Management Unit (SOMU) The State Parole Board's caseload of sex offenders is one of the largest in America, mainly due to the advent of Community Supervision for Life (CSL) and Parole Supervision for Life (PSL) sentencing for sex offenders. Prior to the introduction of this sentencing mandate, sex offenders made up less than 5 percent of the State Parole Board's caseload. Today, they make up nearly a third of the caseload, with a net increase of about 45 new sex offenders each month. Parole officers assigned to the Sex Offender Management Unit use a \\"containment\\" approach to sex offender supervision. This approach includes intensive parole supervision and information sharing with partner law enforcement agencies; sex offender- specific treatment to help control sex offenders' impulsivity; and will soon include polygraph examinations in certain cases, to obtain sexual history information and monitor offenders for behaviors that increase the risk of re- offense. Recruit selection and training At the end of 2011 the State Parole Board Executive Staff made the decision to initiate a new comprehensive hiring process for all new parole officer recruits. A major factor in this new process was to have all future recruit classes attend the DCJ Training Academy's Basic Course for Investigators in Sea Girt. The first recruit class attended in 2012 and continues today. A candidate for sworn parole officer must possess a four year college degree from an accredited university or college. Those seeking selection to become a sworn parole officer must pass a series of entrance requirements which begins with the taking of a Civil Service Selection Examination given by the State of New Jersey's Civil Service Commission (CSC). Once the test is given and graded, passing applicants will be certified by CSC and the applicant will be provided the application package. An intensive background investigation is conducted by the Office of Professional Standards, which includes, but not limited, previous employment checks, family and neighborhood checks, criminal background and driver history checks, school checks and drug screening. If the candidate passes the background check they will be referred for medical and psychological examinations. Lastly, the candidate will be referred for an oral review board. If the candidate is successful in all areas of selection, the candidate will be offered employment and given orientation for the agency and the police academy. The six-month Basic Course for Investigators covers general topics such as investigative procedures essential to the successful investigation, apprehension and prosecution of criminals. Basic firearms training and physical conditioning training are also conducted during this rigorous training academy course. The DCJ Academy is a Police Training Commission certified academy that conducts a wide range of in-service and pre-service training programs for the state's law enforcement and criminal justice communities, including state and county investigators, deputy attorneys general, assistant prosecutors, municipal and county police, police executives, arson investigators, parole, and corrections personnel. At the successful conclusion of the academy, a candidate is commissioned as a sworn law enforcement officer with the title of Parole Officer Recruit (POR). PORs are assigned to the various district offices where they receive on the job training from a veteran Senior Parole Officer (SrPO), who has been trained as a Field Training Officer (FTO). The FTO program is designed for the POR to be exposed all functions of parole officers and to gain experience by learning in a hands on environment. The FTOs prepare reports that are forwarded to their Lieutenants (Lt) and the LETG. PORs will serve a one-year probationary period. New Jersey State Association of Chiefs of Police Accreditation The State Parole Board achieved the New Jersey Association of Chiefs of Police Law Enforcement Accreditation on May 9, 2013. Accreditation status represents a significant professional achievement as it acknowledges the implementation of policies and procedures that are conceptually sound, operationally effective and consistent with nationally recognized best practices. Accreditation is a progressive and time-proven way of improving overall performance. The rigorous standards set forth by the Chiefs of Police have resulted in significant enhancements to the operational efficiency and efficacy of the agency. Some specific areas of improvement have been realized in the areas of recruitment, evidence collection and storage, performance management, officer safety, and training. The State Parole Board continues to strive to maintain compliance with accreditation standards on a daily basis. The State Parole Board earned reaccreditations in 2016 and 2020.

He served as a member of the Norwegian Parliament from Rogaland from 1949‚Äì1965. Biography He was born in Kristiania (now Oslo), Norway. He was the son of Hans Hegna (1863‚Äì1945) and Birthe Buttingsrud (1876‚Äì1956). He attended Oslo Cathedral School. He studied economic and social economics at the University of Oslo where he became Cand.philol. in 1923. While a student, he became a member of the Norwegian Labour Party organization for students (Den Socialdemokratiske Studenterforening). It was here the paper and the organization Mot Dag was founded in 1921, and Hegna was involved from the beginning. He edited the paper between 1926 and 1928, remaining throughout its existence a central contributor, and was chairman for the Norwegian Students' Society in 1924 and 1926. Between 1924-25 he was editor-in-chief in Rjukan Arbeiderblad. When Mot Dag became a part of the Communist Party of Norway (NKP) in 1927, Hegna also became the editor for Norges Kommunistblad in a period. He left the party in 1929 along with most of the members of Mot Dag. Between 1932 and 1936 he was also one of the editors of Arbeidernes Leksikon. When Mot Dag was dissolved in 1936, Hegna again became a member of the Norwegian Labour Party. Between 1939 and 1940 he was the editor of Vestfold Arbeiderblad, and in 1940 he became editor of 1ste Mai (now Rogalands Avis) in Stavanger. During the Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, the newspaper was closed after publishing the headline \\"Ingen nordmann til salgs!\\" (No Norwegian for sale!). In September 1940, Hegna was arrested and imprisoned in Grini concentration camp until 1943. After the liberation of Norway at the end of World War II, he again became editor of 1ste Mai, a position he held until 1958. He was a member of Stavanger city council from 1945 to 1955, and was represented at the Storting between 1950 and 1965, for a period leader of the Standing Committee on Finances and Customs . He was in the national board of the Labour Party between 1949 and 1953 and deputy chairman of the party group at Stortinget from 1958. Hegna was one of many Mot Dag members that became influential in the Labour Party after the second world war, but in a contrast to many of these, Hegna was active in the left wing of the party, among other things against Norwegian membership in the European Economic Community in 1972, but he chose to remain with the party. Hegna also wrote several books, among these books about the Soviet Union, about genealogy, and also served as a translator of fiction books. In 1983 he published the autobiography Min versjon. Personal life In 1939, he married Ragna H√∏yland (1913-1973). Hegna is the grandfather of Norwegian comedian Anne-Kat H√¶rland.

It currently has only one, though not actively used, runway. History Open Street Map of the base. In June 1944 the German Luftwaffe constructed the first airfield near the town of De Rips, consisting of a single 1400 meters long and 75 meters wide grass strip. The airfield did not see much use by the retreating German forces and was later briefly used in October 1944 by the Royal Canadian Air Force 126 wing as an Advanced Landing Ground (designated B-84). It was not located on the site of the current air base, but about 8 kilometers to the north-west of it. There are no visible remains of it today.Abandoned & Little- Known Airfields - Noord Brabant, the Netherlands - De Rips , article retrieved April 10, 2013. The air base was founded as a diversion airfield in 1954 with two parallel runways (06L/24R and 06R/24L) and never served as an active base for aircraft, seeing only incidental usage from the aerial photo reconnaissance unit from nearby Volkel Air Base, even though the base was expanded in 1973 for possible NATO use. In 1993 it was closed as an operational airfield and became the home base of the Royal Netherlands Air Force guided missile division (Groep Geleide Wapens, or GGW). One runway remained however, though it is no longer actively used by the military. The base is used for glider flying however. Military aerial exercises also take place in its airspace. In March 2012 it was decided as part of a reorganisation to transfer control of the base from the Royal Netherlands Air Force to the Royal Netherlands Army, resulting in a name change to Lieutenant General Best Barracks ().

Known as Germantown Road, the highway runs from MD 28 in Darnestown north to MD 355 in Germantown. MD 118 is the four- to six-lane main highway through the central Montgomery County community of Germantown. The highway also connects Germantown and Darnestown with Interstate 270 (I-270). The northernmost part of MD 118 was paved by 1910. The highway was extended south through Germantown in the early 1920s and extended to Darnestown in the early 1930s. MD 118 was relocated and expanded to a divided highway through Germantown in the late 1980s and late 1990s, and near its northern end in the mid-1990s. Route description View north at the south end of MD 118 at MD 28 in Darnestown MD 118 begins at an intersection with MD 28 (Darnestown Road) in the village of Darnestown. The highway heads north as a two-lane undivided road that crosses Great Seneca Creek and passes an electrical substation south of Black Rock Road. MD 118 enters the suburban area of Germantown at the entrance to South Germantown Recreational Park, which includes the Maryland SoccerPlex. The route expands to a six-lane divided highway just south of its intersection with MD 117 (Clopper Road). MD 118 continues northeast and meets the southern end of Father Hurley Boulevard, which serves the northwestern part of Germantown, then crosses over CSX's Metropolitan Subdivision next to the Germantown station on MARC's Brunswick Line. MD 118 intersects Wisteria Drive, Middlebrook Road, and Crystal Rock Drive within the Germantown Town Center commercial area, which contains the BlackRock Center for the Arts. MD 118 passes the Germantown campus of the United States Department of Energy at its partial cloverleaf interchange with I-270 (Eisenhower Memorial Highway), through which the highway temporarily reduces to four lanes. The route passes the Germantown campus of Montgomery College before reaching its northern terminus at MD 355 (Frederick Road), which leads to MD 27 a short distance to the north. Germantown Road continues east as a two-lane undivided county highway toward Montgomery Village. MD 118 is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial from MD 117 to its northern terminus at MD 355 in Germantown. History MD 118 northbound in Germantown The first segment of MD 118 to be constructed as a modern road was from Middlebrook Road north of Germantown to Frederick Road at Neelsville, which was built as a macadam road by Montgomery County with state aid by 1910. The macadam road was extended south to what is today the MD 117 intersection in what was called Old Germantown in 1923. MD 118 was extended south as a concrete road from Old Germantown to Black Rock Road in 1930. The highway was completed when the concrete road was extended to MD 28 at Darnestown in 1934. MD 118 originally followed most of its present course. The highway followed what are today Liberty Mill Road and Walter Johnson Road through Old Germantown and Germantown and Boland Farm Road at its northern end at U.S. Route 240 (now MD 355). Washington National Pike (now I-270) was completed from MD 121 in Clarksburg to MD 118 in Germantown in 1954. That same year, MD 118 had curves modified, was widened to , and was resurfaced from the new freeway to US 240. MD 118 was expanded to a divided highway on either side of the cloverleaf interchange by 1963. The first step of the highway's relocation through Germantown was completed in 1987. MD 118 was expanded to a divided highway from Aircraft Drive to Middlebrook Road and built as a divided highway on its present alignment from Middlebrook Road to Wisteria Drive. The highway turned east onto Wisteria Drive to connect back with the old two-lane highway. The second step was completed in 1998; MD 118 was extended from Wisteria Drive along a new divided highway alignment that crossed a new bridge across the railroad tracks and reconnected with the old road at the southern end of divided highway south of MD 117. MD 118 was relocated from Seneca Meadows Parkway to its present junction with MD 355 in 1995. The highway's interchange with I-270 was changed from a cloverleaf to a partial cloverleaf interchange in 2004.

He served in this capacity from 27 June 1901 to his death in 1929, after he successfully deposed his liberal and reformist brother Dev Shamsher. Although generally perceived as despotic and conservative, he is credited with several reforms including the abolition of slavery and the Nepal-Britain Treaty of 1923, which recognized Nepal as an independent nation and an ally of Britain. Family and early life Chandra Shumsher's immediate family Chandra Shumsher was the sixth of the seventeen sons of Dhir Shumsher Rana (the youngest brother of Jung Bahadur Rana) through his Thapa wife Nanda Kumari, of whom he was the third son. He was educated in Kolkata and thus became the first Nepalese Prime Minister who had passed matriculation examination. In the convocation address of 1884, the then Vice Chancellor of Calcutta University praised him as: \\"a gentleman who has shown he can handle pen as efficiently as sword.\\" Seto Bagh, a historical novel set on the early days of Chandra Shumsher, depicts him as an ambitious and cunning young man with an excellent command of the English language. Rise to power He along with his brothers Khadga Shumsher and Bir Shamsher, orchestrated the murder of his uncle Sri Teen Maharaja Ranodip Singh in order to rise in the line of succession for the hereditary Rana Prime Minister of Nepal. After the demise of his eldest brother Bir Shamsher in March 1901, he became the Commander in Chief of the Nepalese Army under the premiership of his brother Dev Shamsher. Dev Shamsher, however, was a liberal and fearing the rise in public awareness and eventual democratisation that his short rule had brought, Chandra Shamsher orchestrated coup d'√©tat and seized the power for himself in June 1901. Although opposed to reforms and public education, he would later bring numerous reforms, most of them unwillingly, after his visit to Europe, as he found Nepal to be far more backwards than Europe. In Chandra Shumsher's regime, Sardar RamMani Acharya Dixit was one of the mandarins to wield enormous influence by virtue of his proximity. Chandra used Ram Mani's native genius to keep the Mahila Gurujyu in check and ran the country with the advice of these two brilliant bahuns. With their help, Chandra amassed a fortune by making deals with the British over the recruitment of Gurkha soldiers and the mercenary services rendered by the Royal Nepali Army on the side of the British Empire. Rule During the 28 years of his rule, Chandra Shumsher held the firm control of domestic as well as the foreign policy of Nepal. His ADC (Assistant Deputy Commissioner) was Nar Narayan Shah. He went to Britain under the guidance of his ADC. Nar Narayan Shah worked as ADC for 20 years. After his return from the European tour, he is said to have been embarrassed by the backwardness of his country, so he executed some noteworthy reforms. He abolished Sati custom, and made it illegal for a person to be killed for witchcraft. He was counseled by Sardar RamMani Acharya Dixit, which further assured him to ban the ritual suicide, and make additional reforms such as abolishing slavery with the money from the treasury of Pashupatinath temple. He built the first college of Nepal, Tri- Chandra College in 1975 B.S. He established several canals in Terai region and established hospitals throughout Nepal. The first railway service in Nepal, Nepal Government Railway from Raxaul to Amlekhganj, started its service in his tenure. These reforms, however, were mostly brought for the benefit of his family. He was the second Nepalese prime minister to visit Britain and tour Europe after Jung Bahadur Rana. In Britain, he stayed in Mortimer house and was entertained by His Majesty Edward VII. He also observed naval exercises of British Royal navy and in one of the warships, he met the French President under the arrangement of Edward VII. On 24 June, the University of Oxford conferred the honoris causa degree of Doctor of Civil Laws on him. On his departure, the Daily Telegraph wrote: > During the last few years this country has been visited by an unexampled > succession of foreign personages, but none of them has been more interesting > and few more important than the Prime Minister of Nepal. He provided monetary and military assistance to Britain in the First World War, as a result of which Nepal received a huge sum of monetary assistance and the friendship became even more cordial after the successful conclusion of the Nepal‚ÄìBritain Treaty of 1923, which recognised Nepal as an independent nation and an ally of the British Empire. Legacy Prime Minister Chandra Shamsher (left) greeting King George V during a hunting trip to the Nepal Terai in 1911 Chandra Shamsher suffered with tuberculosis and followed a strict diet regimen of rice and black lentils exclusively, as a result he was extremely thin and is sometimes called \\"Phistey Maharaj\\". A popular quote \\"‡§ö‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞‡•á ‡§π‡§æ‡§Å‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø‡•ã ‡§§ ‡§®‡§æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø‡•ã\\" suggests that he seldom laughed and his laughter was rather an ominous one. He abolished Sati custom and slavery from Nepal. TriChandra Campus, Tribhuwan Chandra Military Hospital, Chandra Jyoti Hydro Power at Pharping still bears his name as he established them. Singha Durbar, then the largest palace in Asia with over 1200 rooms, was built by him. Chandra Nahar, the oldest canal of Nepal located in Saptari, was built by him as well. The city of Chandranigahpur in Rautahat district was named after him. Descendants All 8 sons of Chandra Shamsher Chandra Shamsher's son and daughter-in-law; Ranaji Vishnu Shamsher and Raniji Urmila Devi Chandra Shamsher's descendants are still among the most prominent members of the Rana family. They are scattered all over princely states of the Indian subcontinent. Since Chandra Shamsher ruled Nepal for a period of 28 years and had the exclusive control of the national economy, he accumulated immense wealth and built lavish palaces for his sons. His descendants are the richest in all of the Rana dynasty.

It was built on The Mall in 1887, opposite the Lahore High Court. It was consecrated on 25 January 1887. It is the seat of the Diocese of Lahore, of the Church of Pakistan. The cathedral is in the Neo-Gothic style of architecture. It was originally built out of pink sandstone by architect John Oldrid Scott (son of George Gilbert Scott). In 1898, two towers with tall steeples were added to the building, but the steeples were taken down after the earthquake of 1911. The Cathedral Church is commonly referred to by Lahoris as Kukar Girja (Girja being a Hindi/Urdu word meaning 'church' originating from Portuguese igreja) because of a weather cock that was mounted on the central lantern, one of the highest points. A treasure of the cathedral is the ancient Saint Thomas Cross of Saint Thomas Christians excavated in 1935 near the site of the ancient city of Sirkap, although its antiquity is disputed . The structure is also well known for its stained glass windows, pipe organ, and a clock that dates back to 1862. History According to historians, the first church of Lahore was constructed in 1595 near the Lahore Fort, during the Portuguese period when Jesuit missionaries were attending the court of the Mughal Empire. There were three Jesuit missions to Mughal court, as invited by Akbar (1556-1605). The third mission was led by Father Jerome Xavier (1549-1617) who arrived in Lahore in 1595. Emperor Akbar granted formal permission for the construction of a church near the Lahore fort in 1595. On the order of Emperor Jahangir, it was closed in 1614. Ten years later, the church was re-opened but in 1632, on the orders of the Emperor Shah Jehan it was demolished, even though various missions continued to live and preach in Lahore. Two centuries later, the church was again established at Lahore by the British. Today the Cathedral Church of the Resurrection, Lahore is the centre of the Lahore Diocese, which was carved out of the Diocese of Calcutta, the largest Anglican diocese in South Asia, in 1877, which included the area up to Delhi, East Punjab, Kashmir, Afghanistan, with some responsibility for the southern states of the Persian Gulf. Bells Originally the Church was to have eight change-ringing bells, however only six arrived from England. They were cast in 1903 by John Taylor & Co of Loughborough. The largest bell weighs a ton and used to vibrate the foundations. Until the installation of a peal of twelve bells at St Andrew's Cathedral, Singapore in 2019,http://taylorbells.co.uk/project/st-andrews-cathedral/ they were the only 'ringable' peal of church bells on the whole continent of Asia (there is another peal of bells at the Church of the Holy Name in Pune, India, however these are considered 'unringable' because the tower is cracked, and could not withstand the stresses associated with change ringing). Organ Another important possession of the cathedral is a huge organ, which is currently not in use. According to Roy Menzies, a regular visitor to the church, it was last used in 1982. He says: \\"I still remember the melodious tunes of this organ. Sir Griffin James was the last one to play it till 1982\\".

The cerebral hemispheres develop completely but abnormally. The condition is frequently, though not always, associated with anencephaly. The foetus is said to suffer from acrania if it meets the following criteria: the foetus should have a perfectly normal facial bone, a normal cervical column but without the foetal skull and a volume of brain tissue equivalent to at least one third of the normal brain size. Cause Infant with both acrania and anencephaly. There are two problems that may occur during development that cause acrania. =Genetics= There are no known family ties in acrania and recurrence rates are extremely low. Not much is known about the exact mechanism involved in acrania. It is hypothesized that like other developmental malformations, there are multiple origins for acrania. Recent work has identified mutations in the hedgehog acyltransferase (HHAT) gene that have caused acrania along with holoprosencephaly and agnathia. The mutation in which causes this disease is a loss-of-function mutation. Before this discovery in 2010, HHAT was known to play a role in the sonic hedgehog pathway. When HHAT contains a loss-of- function mutation, less HHAT protein is produced. is necessary for the production of Hedgehog () proteins post-transcriptionally. As HHAT production decreases, production of long-range Hh proteins decreases proportionally. Decreases in Hh production disturb the production of extracellular signal- regulated kinases, bone morphogenetic proteins, and fibroblast growth factors, all of which play important roles in craniofacial patterning. Disruption of these pathways leads to abnormal bone and cartilage formation causing acrania and multiple other craniofacial patterning problems. Genetic counseling Little genetic counseling can be offered for acrania because the genetic origins are not fully understood. In order to make genetic counseling for families easier this disease is often differentially diagnosed with other diseases that can occur at the same time such as anencephaly and acalvaria, though these diseases may not always occur simultaneously. While this disease is tragic, reoccurrence rates are extremely low so genetic counseling is not always necessary. =Amniotic band syndrome= During amniotic band syndrome (ABS), fibrous bands may entrap various parts of the developing fetus causing malformations. When these fibrous bands form around the developing skull, the bones will not form properly. ABS occurring in the developing brain neural tissue is one cause of acrania. When is the cause of acrania the fibrous bands cannot be detected through ultrasound. Mechanism During the fourth week of human development the neuropore in a normally developing fetus closes. When this process is either interrupted or never initiated, acrania occurs. The desmocranium becomes a membranous coverage instead of forming the epidermis of the scalp. Whether from being blocked by amniotic bands or by just not initiating, the migration of mesenchyme under the ectoderm does not occur. Because this migration does not occur, the skull, and all involved muscles, are never formed. Without the presence of the neurocranium, the brain fails to separate into two separate lobes. The hindbrain proceeds to develop normally, allowing for the child to be carried to term, but the diencephalon and ocular lobe remain small and underdeveloped. =Ectodermal mesenchyme = Mesenchyme is formed in the developing embryo and will eventually become cartilage and bone. When ectodermal mesenchyme fails to migrate into the head region of the embryo, the skull will not be able to form. What exactly causes the failure of mesenchymal migration is unknown. Diagnosis Acrania can be diagnosed early in pregnancy through an ultrasound. This abnormality appears during the beginning or end of the fourth week of the fetus's development. An absence of the skull is needed in order to make a diagnosis. A presence of brain tissue will confirm the diagnosis of acrania and differentiate it from other developmental problems such as anencephaly. Prognosis Anencephaly is a fatal condition. Infants with anencephaly are stillborn in about 75 percent of cases. Newborns who survive die within several hours, days, or weeks.https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15032-anencephaly This disease is rare, occurring in 1 in 20,000 live births. In order to better manage an acrania diagnosis, early detection is of extreme importance. Families may choose either to terminate the pregnancy, or to carry the child to term.

The station first signed on with a test pattern on September 21, 1953; regular broadcasts began on October 12. It was owned by Charleston businessman Joseph L. Smith, Jr. along with WKNA radio (950 AM, now WVTS; and 97.5 FM, now WQBE). It was an ABC affiliate, and also carried a secondary affiliation with the DuMont Television Network. The station was very locally oriented. Some of the local shows included What's Cookin, a cooking show sponsored by Appalachian Electric Power; The 49ers Club, a children's show; and TV Juke Box. However, the station was doomed from the start. For one thing, Charleston is located in a very rugged dissected plateau, and at the time UHF reception was mediocre at best in rugged terrain. The station's signal barely covered Charleston itself, and even then reception was hit-or-miss more than five miles from the station's tower on Bownemont Hill. The few people who could watch the station were confronted with another problem. When the Federal Communications Commission opened the UHF band in 1952, it didn't require television set manufacturers to include UHF tuning capability. More often than not, the few people who could watch WKNA-TV had to do so by buying an expensive converter, and even then picture quality was mediocre at best. Local and national advertising were almost nonexistent, as no advertiser wanted to buy time on a station where he couldn't even see his own ad. With limited revenue, WKNA-TV's on-air look was very primitive even by 1950s small-market standards. It had no access to news film, and only one live camera. It didn't help matters that Huntington's WSAZ-TV (originally on channel 5, now on channel 3) decently covered Charleston as a result of a significant power increase a few months before WKNA-TV's sign-on. WSAZ-TV was able to cherry-pick live programming from all four networks via its privately owned microwave system, while WKNA-TV had to make do with airing ABC and DuMont programming on a two-week delay via kinescopes. As a result, even though it was obvious by this time that Huntington and Charleston were going to be a single television market, ABC would not even consider giving an exclusive affiliation to channel 49. By the time WKNA-TV was finally able to get a live microwave feed in 1954, WCHS-TV had signed on channel 8 as a CBS affiliate. Not long afterward, ABC pulled all of its programming from channel 49, opting to air on the stronger WSAZ-TV and WCHS-TV via kinescope. With DuMont in its death throes, this proved to be the death knell for WKNA-TV. By early 1955, WKNA-TV was losing around $16,000 per month, and was due to get another competitor later in the year with the sign-on of WHTN-TV (channel 13, now WOWK-TV) from Huntington. Under these circumstances, channel 49 went off the air on February 13, 1955. Smith, however, had every intention of returning the station to the air as soon as possible. Various proposals were bandied about, including returning as a satellite of WOAY-TV in Oak Hill or persuading the FCC to allocate VHF channel 5 to Charleston. However, nothing came of these proposals, and the license was deleted in 1965.

Biography  Zapponi was born in Rome in 1927. He began his literary career writing for Orlando and Marc'Aurelio, two well- established Italian satirical magazines, later branching out into radio and television. An expert in literary innovation, Zapponi founded the cult magazine Il Delatore (The Spy), published four novels including Gobal, a famous collection of short stories, as well as songs, plays and theatre sketches. Revered for his work with Fellini, he also collaborated on films by Dino Risi and co-wrote Dario Argento's Deep Red.  Fellini, Poe and Toby Dammit  Zapponi first met Fellini in July 1967 during pre-production of the \\"Toby Dammit\\" segment in the omnibus film, Histoires extraordinaires after Fellini had abandoned his ambitious project, The Voyage of G. Mastorna.Bernardino Zapponi, Il Mio Fellini, Venezia: Marsilio Editori, 1995, p. 16. While recovering from a devastating illness (provoked by the Mastorna fiasco), Fellini read Zapponi's Gobal and hoped to convince French producer, Raymond Eger, of financing one of its short stories. The story in question, The Driver, was a macabre tale of a chauffeur demolishing the car he doesn't own. Interested solely in screen adaptations of work by Edgar Allan Poe, Eger rejected the proposal. Fellini then instructed his assistant Liliana Betti to read and summarize all of Poe's tales for him. Although tempted by several stories, it was Never Bet the Devil Your Head with the protagonist Toby Dammit that fired his imagination. Zapponi read a news item while scouting locations with Fellini that concerned the collapsed Ariccia Bridge in the Castelli Romani quarter outside Rome. Visiting the area at night, they were deeply impressed by the bridge's ruined splendor and decided to make it a crucial element in the death of Toby Dammit.Bernardino Zapponi, Il Mio Fellini, Venezia: Marsilio Editori, 1995, p. 17. In Fellini's version of Toby Dammit, the eponymous hero is decapitated by a steel wire strung across the collapsed bridge as he attempts to clear the gap in the Ferrari given to him by his film producers. In addition to \\"Toby Dammit\\", Zapponi collaborated on Fellini: A Director's Notebook, Satyricon, I clowns, Roma, Fellini's Casanova, and City of Women, for a total of seven films with the Italian director.

Born in Wilmington, Delaware, Bob Camac came from a Thoroughbred horse racing family in which two of his uncles worked as trainers. He became a professional trainer in 1976 and built a successful career working primarily at smaller racetracks in Delaware and Philadelphia. In 1988, he was the leading trainer for the fall-winter meet at Philadelphia Park Racetrack and although he was never in the national limelight until after his death, during his career Camac trained the winners of 1,811 races. A well-respected and well-liked trainer, fellow horseman John Servis told The New York Times that Camac \\"was more than just a trainer, he was a good businessman and would manage his owners' stables. Not too many guys had the kind of overall knowledge he had.\\" For a number of years Bob Camac trained horses for stable owner Arthur I. Appleton, earning a Grade I win in the 1992 Philip H. Iselin Handicap with Jolie's Halo. Camac bred the 2003 New Jersey horse of the year, Gators N Bears, but it was Smarty Jones who was his most important breeding accomplishment. Camac trained for Roy and Patricia Chapman, owners of Someday Farm. For them, Camac purchased the filly I'll Get Along for $40,000 at the 1993 Keeneland September yearling sale. I'll Get Along won twelve races and earned $276,969 before becoming a broodmare. Camac suggested that the Chapmans breed her to Elusive Quality. They agreed, and Camac arranged the mating which on February 28, 2001, produced a colt given the name Smarty Jones. Death Sixty-one-year- old Robert Camac and his fifty-five-year-old wife, Maryann V. Camac, were shot to death at their farm in the Pedricktown section of Oldmans Township, New Jersey, on December 6, 2001. Their funeral service was held at Trinity United Methodist Church in Pennsville, New Jersey on December 12, and they were buried in Gracelawn Memorial Park in New Castle. Thirty-six-year-old Wade Russell, Maryann Camac's son from a previous marriage, was arrested and charged with their deaths. Russell plead guilty to aggravated manslaughter and was sentenced to twenty-eight years in prison. He was later transferred to a psychiatric facility in Trenton, New Jersey, after authorities had to place him on suicide watch. Following Bob Camac's death, Roy and Patricia Chapman sold most of their horses but on the advice of a friend, kept Smarty Jones.

It was first published by the composer in 1803Stone, Grove. The exact date of publication is disputed. and served as an illustration of a nouveau syst√®me (Fr. \\"new system\\") Reicha invented for fugue composition. This system involved, among other things, extensive use of polyrhythms, derived from traditional music, and fugal answers on any and all scale degrees, rather than just the dominant, which was standard at the time.  Historical background  Reicha most probably started composing the fugues during his short stay in Hamburg. In 1799 he moved to Paris and soon published a collection of twelve fugues there, all of which were subsequently included in 36 Fugues (as numbers 1, 2, 4, 8, 20‚Äì23, 25‚Äì27 and 35).Stone, Grove By 1802 Reicha moved to Vienna, but the same year two more works that would later be included in the collection were published in Paris. These were a fantaisie from Etude de transitions et 2 fantaisies, Op. 31, and a fugue on a theme by Domenico Scarlatti, Op. 32. The complete cycle was published in 1803 in Vienna under the French title Trente six fugues pour le pianoforte, compos√©es d'apr√®s un nouveau syst√®me (\\"Thirty-six fugues for the piano, composed using a new system\\"). The collection was dedicated to Haydn, whom Reicha knew since the early 1790s, and included a dedicatory poem by Reicha, in French and German. The fugues were preceded by extensive textual notes, in which Reicha defended his methods, particularly polyrhythm, for which he cites numerous examples from traditional music of Switzerland, Alsace, Greece and western France around the Bay of Biscay.Reicha's text cited in: Vit Roubicek. Liner notes to \\"36 Fugues for piano, Op. 36 (selection)\\", Milan Langer (piano) The second edition was published in Vienna in 1805 and included a short theoretical text, √úber das neue Fugensystem, in which Reicha explains the theoretical basis of the fugues in form of a polemic against the numerous opponents of his ideas. These included Ludwig van Beethoven, who dismissed Reicha's method for turning the fugue into something that is no longer a fugue (\\"da√ü die Fuge keine Fuge mehr ist\\"),Beethoven's letter Breitkopf & H√§rtel, written on 18 December 1802, see autograph and Robert Schumann.Vit Roubicek. Liner notes to \\"36 Fugues for piano, Op. 36 (selection)\\", Milan Langer (piano) Also mentioned in Reicha's text are the circumstances that led to the composition of some of the fugues with borrowed themes: apparently, his Parisian friends had chosen several themes and asked Reicha to compose fugues on them using the new method.  General information  Fugue No. 13, an example of Reicha's \\"new harmonic system\\", which can provide cadences on almost all of the scale degrees, as pointed out in the score by Reicha himself. In √úber das neue Fugensystem Reicha outlines his idea of the fugue as a form. To him, the characteristics required were the following: * the theme must appear in all voices, voices entering one by one, * throughout the fugue the texture and character must remain properly contrapuntal, * all musical ideas should be derived from the subject alone.Walker, Paul. \\"Fugue. 7. The Romantic Era\\", Grove Music Online, ed. L. Macy, grovemusic.com (subscription access). The standard rule of answering the subject at the dominant did not matter to Reicha, and he argues that any scale degree can be used (for example, the subject is answered at the tritone in Fugue No. 20). He also dismisses limitations on the nature of the fugue's subjects, such as obligatory non-periodic structure (one of the subjects of Fugue No. 18 consists of a single note repeated) and a maximum span of a ninth (the subject borrowed from Mozart, in Fugue No. 7, has a span of more than two octaves). Finally, in some fugues of the cycle, Reicha experiments with the structure of the form by adding introductory sections (Fugue No. 27) or alternating between two different forms of texture (Fugue No. 14). Although most fugues employ a single subject, some are different: six fugues employ two subjects (nos. 4, 13, 18, 31, 32, 34), fugue number 30 has three and fugue number 15 has six. Of the 36 fugues, 6 use subjects from other composers. These are the following: * Fugue No. 3 in F minor uses the primary theme from the first movement of Joseph Haydn's String Quartet No. 23 in F Minor, Op. 20, No. 5 * Fugue No. 5 in G major uses the subject of Johann Sebastian Bach's G major fugue from Book II of the Well-Tempered Clavier, BWV 884/2 * Fugue No. 7 in D major uses the theme that starts Mozart's Haffner Symphony, K. 385 * Fugue No. 9 in G minor uses the subject of Domenico Scarlatti's Cat's Fugue, Kk. 30/ L. 499 * Fugue No. 14, fuga-fantasia, uses the subject of Girolamo Frescobaldi's Recercar Cromatic[h]o post il credo from the second Mass of Fiori musicali, Missa Degli Apostoli. * Fugue No. 15 is built on six subjects, one of which is a theme from Handel's oratorio Israel in Egypt, namely the line \\"I will sing unto the Lord\\" from the first chorus of the second part, \\"Moses and the children of Israel [...]\\".

Whitehouse was an accomplished left winger, who was equally comfortable filling in at left back. He served his only club, Sheffield United, for 13 years between 1987 and 2000, making 275 appearances and scoring 50 goals. Club career Whitehouse signed professionally for Sheffield United in July 1987 and made his first team debut against Blackpool in 1988, aged just 18. He made a good early impression, but was in and out of the team for most of his early professional career. He played a part in the Blades' promotion from the old Third Division in 1988, and again in the next season when United were promoted to the top flight. He began to establish himself as a first-team regular during the 1991‚Äì92 season. His goals included a double against Chelsea in a 2‚Äì1 win, and he also chipped in with three FA Cup goals. In the first Steel City derby of the 1991‚Äì92 campaign, Whitehouse scored against local rivals Sheffield Wednesday in a 2‚Äì0 win at Bramall Lane. In the return fixture at Hillsborough, he was once again on target, scoring the first goal. After a game against Bristol City, Whitehouse broke his leg and missed a large proportion of the 1992‚Äì93 season. Despite the seriousness of the injury, he returned to play a part towards the end of the campaign. He starred in the closing stages of the Blades' run to the FA Cup semi-final, making an appearance at Wembley Stadium in the defeat to Sheffield Wednesday. He was also on the scoresheet twice in the final game of the season, when United hammered Chelsea 4‚Äì2. Despite an opening day win over Swindon Town the next season, United were again struggling to keep their Premier League status intact. In a 3‚Äì2 home win over West Ham United, Whitehouse smashed the ball into the top corner from nearly 30 yards for what was one of the goals of the season. Despite Whitehouse's goals, United were relegated on the final game of the season, losing 3‚Äì2 away at Chelsea. Whitehouse was again in good scoring form at the start of the 1994‚Äì95 season. He eventually finished with 10 goals in all competitions, which included a hat-trick in the League Cup against Stockport County, but the Blades failed to win promotion. After a disappointing 1995‚Äì96 season United parted with longtime manager Dave Bassett. Howard Kendall took charge and, despite a clear out of players, Whitehouse was still a first-team regular in the new regime. He finished with six goals in the 1995‚Äì96 season, which included a goal against Arsenal at Highbury in the FA Cup. During the 1997‚Äì98 campaign, Whitehouse was a regular up to November. In a game against Port Vale he was crudely tackled by Gareth Ainsworth, and Whitehouse suffered a serious knee injury. Despite an attempt to get back to fitness, which included a few outings for the reserves, Whitehouse was forced to retire.

It is classically associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia, but it is not pathognomonic. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram negative, aerobic bacillus. This type of skin lesion was first described in association with Pseudomonas aeruginosa by L. Barker in 1897. It was given the name \\"ecthyma gangrenosum\\" by Hitschmann and Kreibich. It mostly occurs in patients with underlying immunocompromise (e.g. malignancy or HIV). Although most cases are due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, there are recent reports of this skin lesion in association with other microorganisms, such as Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, various other Pseudomonas species, and Morganella morganii.  Signs and symptoms  The primary skin lesion usually starts with a macule that is painless, round and erythematous. Then, it develops into a pustule, and then a bulla with central hemorrhagic focus. The bulla progresses into an ulcer which extends laterally. Finally it becomes a gangrenous ulcer with a central black eschar surrounded by an erythematous halo. The lesions may be single or multiple. They are most commonly seen in perineum and under arm pit. However, they can occur in any part of the body.  Mechanism  The organism enters directly through the breakdown of mechanical defense barriers such as mucosa or skin. Conditions which lead to the development of an immunocompromised state make the patient more susceptible to ecthyma gangrenosum and sepsis. In case of sepsis, the bacteria reaches the skin via the bloodstream. Defective humoral or cellular immunity increases risk, as the organism is not cleared from the bloodstream as usual. The main mechanism of the organism that is causing the typical skin lesions is the invasion of the organism into the arteries and veins in the dermis and subcutaneous tissues of the skin. This perivascular invasion leads to nodular formation, ulceration, vasculitis and necrosis due to impaired blood supply. Perivascular involvement is achieved by direct entry of bacteria through the skin or hematogenous spreading in case of sepsis.  Diagnosis  Diagnosis is made by clinical observation and the following tests. (1) Gram stain of the fluid from pustules or bullae, and tissue swab. (2) Blood culture (3) Urine culture (4) Skin biopsy (5) Tissue culture Magnetic resonance imaging can be done in case of ecthyma gangrenosum of plantar foot to differentiate from necrotizing fasciitis.  Prevention  The main organism associated with ecthyma gangrenosum is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, multi- bacterial cases are reported as well. Prevention measures include practicing proper hygiene, educating the immunocompromised patients for awareness to avoid possible conditions and seek timely medical treatment.  Treatments  Treatments involve antibiotics that cover for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. antipseudomonal penicillins, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, third generation cephalosporins or aztreonam can be given. Usually, the antibiotics are changed according to the culture and sensitivity result. In patients with very low white blood cell counts, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor may be given. Depending on the causal agents, antivirals or antifungals can be added. Surgery will be needed if there is extensive necrosis not responding to medical treatments.  Recent research  A recent retrospective study of all cases of ecthyma gangrenosum from 2004‚Äì2010 in a university hospital in Mexico shows that neutropenia in immunocompromised patients is the most common risk factor for ecthyma gangrenosum.

The town was composed of tents and log cabins, but soon had stores, carpenters, a hotel, saloon, blacksmith shop, and an assayer. By 1874 the town had more than a thousand residents and 400 buildings. A U.S. post office opened in 1874, and in September 1874 the Rosita Index began as a weekly newspaper. Rosita took the seat of Custer County away from Ula (now also a ghost town) in 1878.

In the early 1880s, Rosita was surpassed by the nearby mining towns of Querida and Silver Cliff. After a bitter four-year fight, Silver Cliff took the county seat from Rosita in the 1886 election, and Rosita declined further.

A follow-up, Texas, was issued in 2006 without much fanfare. The band takes its name from a line found in the 1983 Elvis Costello song \\"Shipbuilding\\". Biography Diving For Pearls originated in Boston, MA, and was formed by Danny Malone (lead vocals, guitar) and Jack Moran (keyboards), both former members of local act The Trademarks. After slugging it out on the Boston scene for a couple of years, Malone and Moran moved to New York City where they were eventually joined by Yul Vazquez (guitar, vocals), formerly with Urgent, and Peter Clemente (drums), who had played with the Michael Monroe fronted NY act Secret Chiefs and appears on Monroe's 1987 debut solo album, Nights Are So Long; Vazquez and Clemente had also both been part of Jean Beauvoir's Drums Along the Mohawk touring band. L.A. native David Weeks (bass) would complete the DFP line-up. Things began to move for the band when Epic Records A&R; man Michael Kaplan came out to a NY gig in 1988 and convinced Epic to sign the band to a $20,000 development deal. He subsequently introduced the members to up and coming producer David Prater who cut half a dozen songs with the group. Not fully convinced yet, Epic head of A&R;, Don Grierson, allotted some extra money and another half a dozen songs were recorded under the guidance of Prater. One of the new tracks was \\"New Moon\\" and according to Malone, it was this particular track that convinced Grierson to sign the group. Diving For Pearls eponymous debut was recorded from April 14 to June 10, 1989 at the Eleven-Eleven Sound Studios in Nashville, TN with Prater at the helm. The album's release in October 1989, was preceded by the release of the first single and MTV video, \\"Gimme Your Good Lovin'\\", and spawned another radio favorite, \\"I Don't Want To Cry\\". The record went on to sell over 250,000 copies in the U.S. alone and was named as one of Kerrang! magazine's Top 20 for 1989. A second album was in the works but never completed when the band was dropped by the label due to the changing musical climate. Diving For Pearls was remastered and re-issued by English label Rock Candy in 2006, including 5 bonus tracks, a studio demo of The Beatles' \\"Dear Prudence\\", and 4 live cuts recorded at the Toy Tiger club in Louisville, KY in 1990, including a cover of The Cult's \\"She Sells Sanctuary\\". Danny Malone would move on to join Band Of Angels, led by Elliot Easton of The Cars, whose Roy Thomas Baker produced album for Atlantic Records was shelved and remains unreleased. However, 5 songs from the BOA sessions with Malone on lead vocals would surface as bonus tracks on the 1996 re-issue of Easton's solo album Change No Change, originally released in 1985. Malone would also team up with former Styx member Glen Burtnik in a short lived band called Dunaways who played a half dozen shows at New York's famed CBGBs before calling it quits. In 2002, Malone resurrected Diving For Pearls and secured a recording contract with Swedish label Atenzia Records. A new album, Texas, eventually surfaced in 2005; it was their first release in 17 years. The band now consisted of Malone as the only original member along with contributions from returning producer David Prater. Though the CD was well written and performed it received little fanfare. As of 2008, Malone was studying for his art major in his hometown of Boston. Since the demise of Diving For Pearls in the early 1990s, guitarist Yul Vazquez has gone on to a successful TV and movie acting career, starting in 1992 with a role in the movie The Mambo Kings. Between 1995 and '98, he appeared in several episodes of Seinfeld as Bob, The Intimidating Gay Guy. Vazquez was nominated for a 2011 Tony Award for \\"Best Featured Actor in a Play\\" for his role of Cousin Julio in The Motherfucker With the Hat. In 2009, Vazquez played acoustic guitar with Ian Astbury of The Cult under the name The Soft Revolt appearing at The Bowery Electric in New York City on the opening night of John Patrick Shanley's play Savage in Limbo, which Astbury was producing. They performed songs by The Cult and Astbury solo material as well as covers by the Rolling Stones, Radiohead, among others. Peter Clemente later became vice president and director of online entertainment practice at Internet customer relationship management firm Cyber Dialogue. Early in his career, he had been a member of The Mundanes, a new wave band based in Providence, RI, whose 1982 demo was produced by Mick Ronson. Former bassist David Weeks made the headlines in 2002 as a lawyer representing Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee in their infamous sex video lawsuit against Seattle-based Internet Entertainment Group.

Background  Busanda was sired by 1937 U.S. Triple Crown champion War Admiral, a son of Man o' War, who was ranked first in the Blood-Horse magazine list of the top 100 U.S. Thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century. Busanda's dam, Businesslike, was sired by U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee Blue Larkspur and out of the extremely important broodmare La Troienne. Businesslike was owned by Colonel E. R. Bradley at the time of Busanda's conception. When Bradley died in August 1946, Businesslike was sold to Ogden Phipps, who became Busanda's breeder of record. Busanda's name is an acronym for the Bureau of Supplies and Accounts, which was a Navy bureau that Phipps had served in during World War II. Busanda was conditioned by Hall of Fame trainer \\"Sunny Jim\\" Fitzsimmons, who handled a large string of horse for the Phipps family. In some of her races, though, Fitzsimmons' assistant Bartholomew Sweeney is recorded as the trainer.  Racing career  In an era when most Thoroughbreds were raced frequently and for two to three years, Busanda made sixty-five starts during four seasons of competition. At age two, her best showing was a third-place finish to winner Bed o'Roses in the Selima Stakes at Laurel Park Racecourse. Although as a three-year-old in 1950 she won the important Alabama Stakes, it was at age four in 1951 when she had her best campaign. That year, her performances included wins against male horses when she captured the New Castle, Suburban, and Top Flight Handicaps as well as the Saratoga Cup. In 1952, in addition to her second straight Saratoga Cup, she won the Diana Handicap before being retired to broodmare duty.  Retirement  Bred to U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee Tom Fool, in 1963 Busanda produced the colt Buckpasser, who was the 1966 American Horse of the Year and a 1970 U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee.

In studies of China and Mongolia, the campaigns are often treated as a success due to the establishment of tributary relations with ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát despite the Mongols suffering several military defeats. In contrast, Vietnamese historiography emphasizes the Dai Viet military victories. The first invasion began in 1258 under the united Mongol Empire, as it looked for alternative paths to invade Song China. The Mongol general Uriyangkhadai was successful in capturing the Vietnamese capital Thang Long (modern-day Hanoi) before turning north in 1259 to invade the Song dynasty in modern-day Guangxi as part of a coordinated Mongol attack with armies attacking in Sichuan under M√∂ngke Khan and other Mongol armies attacking in modern-day Shandong and Henan. The first invasion also established tributary relations between the Vietnamese kingdom, formerly a Song dynasty tributary state, and the Yuan dynasty. In 1282, Kublai Khan and the Yuan dynasty launched a naval invasion of Champa that also resulted in the establishment of tributary relations. Intending to demand greater tribute and direct Yuan oversight of local affairs in ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát and Champa, the Yuan launched another invasion in 1285. The second invasion of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát failed to accomplish its goals, and the Yuan launched a third invasion in 1287 with the intent of replacing the uncooperative ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát ruler Tr·∫ßn Nh√¢n T√¥ng with the defected Tr·∫ßn prince Tr·∫ßn √çch T·∫Øc. By the end of the second and third invasions, which involved both initial successes and large losses for the Mongols, the ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát and Champa decided to accept the nominal supremacy of the Yuan dynasty and serve as tributary states in order to avoid further conflicts. Background By the 1250s, the Mongol Empire controlled large amounts of Eurasia including much of Eastern Europe, Anatolia, North China, Mongolia, Manchuria, Central Asia, Tibet and Southwest Asia. M√∂ngke Khan (r. 1251-59) planned to attack the Song dynasty in southern China from three directions in 1259. Therefore, he ordered the prince Kublai to pacify the Dali Kingdom. Uriyangkhadai led successful campaigns in the southwest of China and pacified tribes in Tibet before turning east towards ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát by 1257. In the autumn of 1257, Uriyangkhadai addressed three letters to Vietnamese ruler Tr·∫ßn Th√°i T√¥ng (known as Tr·∫ßn Nh·∫≠t C·∫£nh by the Mongol) demanding passage through to southern China. Tr·∫ßn Th√°i T√¥ng opposed the encroachment of a foreign army across his territory to attack their ally, and so prepared soldiers on elephants to deter the Mongol troops. After the three successive envoys were imprisoned in the capital Thang Long (modern-day Hanoi) of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát, Uriyangkhadai invaded ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát with generals Trechecdu and Aju in the rear. The ancestors of the Tr·∫ßn clan originated from the province of Fujian and later migrated to ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát under Tr·∫ßn Kinh Èô≥‰∫¨ (Ch√©n Jƒ´ng), the ancestor of the Tr·∫ßn clan in 1127. Their descendants, the later rulers of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát who were of mixed-blooded descent later replaced the house of L√Ω, established the Tr·∫ßn dynasty in 1226, which ruled Vietnam (ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát); despite many intermarriages between the Tr·∫ßn and several royal members of the L√Ω royals alongside members of their royal court as in the case of Tr·∫ßn L√Ω and Tr·∫ßn Th·ª´a, some of the mixed-blooded descendants of the Tr·∫ßn dynasty and certain members of the clan could still speak Chinese such as when a Yuan dynasty envoy had a meeting with the Chinese-speaking Tr·∫ßn prince Tr·∫ßn Qu·ªëc Tu·∫•n in 1282. p. 190. Kublai Khan, the fifth Great Khan of the Mongol Empire, and the founder of the Yuan dynasty Historian Liam Kelley noted that people from Song dynasty China like Zhao Zhong and Xu Zongdao escaped to ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát after the Mongol invasion of the Song and helped the Vietnamese fight against the Mongol invasion. The ancestors of the Tr·∫ßn clan originated from the Fujian region of China as did the Daoist Chinese cleric Xu Zongdao who recorded the Mongol invasion and referred to them as \\"Northern bandits\\". He quoted the ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát S·ª≠ K√Ω To√†n Th∆∞ which said ‚ÄúWhen the Song [Dynasty] was lost, its people came to us. Nh·∫≠t Du·∫≠t took them in. There was Zhao Zhong who served as his personal guard. Therefore, among the accomplishments in defeating the Yuan [i.e., Mongols], Nh·∫≠t Du·∫≠t had the most.‚Äùproof that he runs the blog Southern Song Chinese military officers and civilian officials left to overseas countries, went to Vietnam and intermarried with the Vietnamese ruling elite and went to Champa to serve the government there as recorded by Zheng Sixiao. Southern Song soldiers were part of the Vietnamese army prepared by emperor Tr·∫ßn Th√°nh T√¥ng against the second Mongol invasion.  First Mongol invasion in 1258  First Mongol - Tr·∫ßn war (1257-1258) =Background= In 1258, a Mongol column under Uriyangkhadai, the son of Subutai, invaded ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát. According to Vietnamese sources, the Mongol army consisted of at least 30,000 soldiers of which at least 2,000 were Yi troops from the Dali Kingdom. Modern scholarship points to a force of several thousand Mongols, ordered by Kublai to invade with Uriyangkhadai in command, which battled with the Viet forces on 17 January 1258. =Campaign= 13th-century sword ƒëao and iron-hooks. Tr·∫ßn dynasty period, National Treasure, Vietnam Military History Museum A battle was fought in which the Vietnamese used war elephants: king Tr·∫ßn Th√°i T√¥ng even led his army from atop an elephant. Aju ordered his troops to fire arrows at the elephants' feet. The animals turned in panic and caused disorder in the Vietnamese army, which was routed. The Vietnamese senior leaders were able to escape on pre-prepared boats while part of their army was destroyed at No Nguyen (modern Viet Tri on the Hong River). The remainder of the Dai Viet army again suffered a major defeat in a fierce battle at the Ph√∫ L·ªô bridge the day after. This led the Vietnamese monarch to evacuate the capital. The ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát annals reported that the evacuation was \\"in an orderly manner;\\" however this is viewed as a embellishment because the Vietnamese had to retreat in disarray to leave their weapons behind in the capital.Descending Dragon, Rising Tiger: A History of Vietnam by Vu Hong Lien, Peter Sharrock, Chapter 6. King Tr·∫ßn Th√°i T√¥ng fled to an offshore island, while the Mongols occupied the capital city ThƒÉng Long (modern-day Hanoi). They found their envoys in prison, however one of whom died. Although the Mongols had successfully captured the capital, the provinces around the capital were still under Vietnamese control. While Chinese source material is sometimes misinterpreted as saying that Uriyangkhadai withdrew from Vietnam due to poor climate, Uriyangkhadai left Thang Long after nine days to invade the Song dynasty in modern-day Guangxi in a coordinated Mongol attack with armies attacking in Sichuan under M√∂ngke Khan and other Mongol armies attacking in modern-day Shandong and Henan. The Mongol army gained the popular local nickname of \\"Buddhist enemies\\" because they did not loot nor kill while moving north out to Yunnan. After the loss of a prince and the capital, Tr·∫ßn Th√°i T√¥ng submitted to the Mongols. In 1258, the Vietnamese monarch commenced regular diplomatic relations and a tributary relationship with the Mongol court, treating them as equals to the embattled Southern Song dynasty without renouncing their ties to the Song.  Invasion of Champa in 1282  King Tr·∫ßn Nh√¢n T√¥ng was the political leader of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát during the Mongol invasion, ruled from 1278 to 1293 Portrait of Prince Tr·∫ßn Qu·ªëc Tu·∫•n (1228-1300), was known to the Mongol as H∆∞ng ƒê·∫°o ƒë·∫°i V∆∞∆°ng, the military hero of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát during the second and third Mongols invasion, 19th century Vietnamese painting. With the defeat of the Song dynasty in 1276, the newly established Yuan dynasty turned its attention to the south, particularly Champa and ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát. In late 1281, Kublai decided to make Champa to be a new province of the Yuan Empire, and announced the invasion of Champa. Sogetu of the Jalairs, the governor of Guangzhou, was dispatched to demand the submission of Champa. Although the king of Champa accepted the status of a Mongol protectorate,Grousset, R. (1970) p. 290 his submission was unwilling. In March 1282, Sogetu led a maritime invasion of Champa with 5,000 men, but could only muster 100 ships because most of the Yuan ships had been lost in the invasions of Japan.Delgado, J. (2008) p. 158 Sogetu's fleet arrived and landed in Champa's capital Vijaya in 17 February 1283, and captured the city two days later, but then withdrew and set up camps outside the city. The aged Champa king Indravarman V retreated out of the capital, avoiding Mongol attempts to capture him in the hills. The Cham king and his prince both refused to visit Mongol camp, and ambushed Sogetu's troops in the mountains. His son would wage guerrilla warfare against the Mongols for the next two years, eventually wearing down the invaders.Delgado, J. (2008) p. 159 Stymied by the withdrawal of the Champa king, Sogetu asked for reinforcements from Kublai but sailed home in March 1284 just as another Mongol fleet with more than 15,000 troops under Ataqai and Arigh Khaiya embarked on a fruitless mission to reinforce him. Sogetu presented his plan to have more troops invade Champa through ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát. Kublai accepted his plan and put his son Toghan in command, with Sogetu as second in command. Second Mongol invasion in 1285 Second Mongol invasion of Vietnam (1284-1285) Mobile trebuchets deployed by both Mongol Yuan and the Vietnamese in Vietnam =Background= In 1266, the Vietnamese monarch Tr·∫ßn Th√°nh T√¥ng (son of Tr·∫ßn Th√°i T√¥ng) agreed in 1266 to acknowledge the overlordship of Kublai Khan, however in the following year, he rejected the \\"Six-Duties of a vassal state\\" of the Mongol Emperor gave, included the permit the stationing of a darughachi (regional general) with authority over the local administration. In 1278, Tr·∫ßn Th√°nh T√¥ng retired and made crown prince Tr·∫ßn Kh√¢m (as known as Tr·∫ßn Nh√¢n T√¥ng) as the successor. Kublai Khan was dissatisfied with the tributary arrangement, which granted the Yuan dynasty the same amount of tribute as the former Song dynasty had received, and requested greater tributary payments. These demands included taxes to the Mongols in both money and labor, \\"incense, gold, silver, cinnabar, agarwood, sandalwood, ivory, tortoiseshell, pearls, rhinoceros horn, silk floss, and porcelain cups\\", and direct oversight from a Mongol-appointed darughachi. In 1283, Khubilai Khan sent word to ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát that he intended to send Yuan armies through Vietnamese territory to attack the kingdom of Champa, with demands for provisions and other support to the Yuan army. In 1284 Kublai appointed his son Toghan () to conquer Champa. Toghan demanded from the Vietnamese a route to Champa, which would trap the Champan army from both north and south. While Th√°nh T√¥ng and Nh√¢n T√¥ng initially accepted the demand reluctantly, then denied, and ordered an defensive war against the Mongol army. A Yuan envoy recorded that the Vietnamese had already sent 500 ships to help the Cham. As the Mongol invasion was imminent, in 1284, king Nh√¢n T√¥ng held the All-Vietnamese Central Executive Conference of Di√™n H·ªìng (Vietnamese: H·ªôi Ngh·ªã Di√™n H·ªìng), with the participation of all nobles and officials. All members of the Conference agreed to resist the Mongol invasion rather than accept the \\"darughachi\\" system. The king ordered all regulars and military to tattoo on their hands two words \\"S√°t Th√°t\\" (, death to the Tatars).Vtudien dictionary =Campaign= The main Yuan army led by Toghon was said in History of Yuan to consist of 8 tumens, with some 20,000 unarmed Jurchen and Han Chinese supporters, and many Yuan veterans such as Ariq Qaya (Uyghur), Li Heng (Tangut), Bolqadar, and Mangqudai.History of the Yuan Dynasty, vol. 209 Yuan troops crossed the Friendship Pass (Sino-Vietnamese border's gate) in 27 January 1285. After passed the mountainous terrains with collecting nails, traps along the highway, Mongol forces captured 400 Song officers who were fighting alongside with the Vietnamese. In the Red River Delta, the combined Yuan land forces attacked the Vietnamese forces by land and river, destroyed several Vietnamese catapults (Hu dun pao) along the Red River, successful captured ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát's capital ThƒÉng Long and drove the Vietnamese forces and the Royal family to the coast. Planning to weaken the enemies first, the Vietnamese royal family abandoned the capital and retreated south while enacting a scorched earth campaign by abandoning empty capital and cities, burning villages and crops where the Mongols occupied. At the same time, Sogetu moved his army up north in an attempt to envelop the Vietnamese royal family in a pincer movement, but Kinh Nh√¢n T√¥ng and his army managed to escape to Nam ƒê·ªãnh, and re-concentrated here. The king tried to prevent Sogetu from linking with Toghon, but failed and forced royal family retreated to the coastal Qu·∫£ng Ninh province. The Yuan forces under Omar launched two naval offensives in April and again drove the Vietnamese forces to the south. Sogetu's army was weakened by the summer heat and the lack of food, so they stopped chasing the royal family and move north to join with Toghan. Seeing the Mongols‚Äô movement, prince Tr·∫ßn Qu·ªëc Tu·∫•n concluded that the Mongol army was weakened and decided to take the opportunity to strike, selecting battlefields where the Mongol cavalry could not be fully employed. The Cham were in pursuit of Sogetu as he was heading north, and killed him and defeated his army.Delgado, J. (2008) p. 160 However, according to Vietnamese history, Sogetu was defeated in H√†m T·ª≠, H∆∞ng Y√™n and was killed by the Vietnamese in his retreat. In May 1285, situation began changing as Yuan's supplies running low. Take avdantage, a Vietnamese fleet under prince Tr·∫ßn Qu·ªëc Tu·∫•n sailed to the north and attacked V·∫°n Ki·∫øp, the important Mongol camp and cut off the Mongol supplies. As the Yuan forces bogged down in the Red River delta, dispersing their power, Prime Minister Quang Kh·∫£i personally launched a large counterattack at Ch∆∞∆°ng D∆∞∆°ng and V·∫°n Ki·∫øp, forcing Toghan to withdraw. Toghan returned without a huge loss of the army under him thanks to the Kipchak officer Sidor and his navy. The Yuan retreated back to China in June 9, 1285. Third Mongol invasion, 1287-88 Third Mongol invasion of Vietnam (1287-1288) =Background= In 1286, Kublai Khan appointed Tr·∫ßn Th√°nh T√¥ng's younger brother, Prince Tr·∫ßn √çch T·∫Øc, as the King of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát from afar with the intent of dealing with the uncooperative incumbent Tr·∫ßn Nh√¢n T√¥ng. Tr·∫ßn √çch T·∫Øc, who had already surrendered to the Yuan, was willing to lead a Yuan army into ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát to take the throne. Kublai Khan cancelled plans underway for a third invasion of Japan to concentrated miltary preparations in the south. In October 1287, the Yuan land forces commanded by Toghon moved southwards from Guangxi and Yunnan in three divisions led by general Abachi and Changyu, while the naval expedition led by generals Omar, Zhang Wenhu, and Aoluchi. The army was complemented by a large naval force that advanced from Qinzhou, with the intent to form a large pincer movement against the Vietnamese. The force was composed of Mongols, Jurchen, Han Chinese, Zhuang, and Li troops. =Campaign= Wooden stakes from the Bach Dang river in Museum of Vietnam The Yuan were successful in the early phases of the invasion, occupying and looting the ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát capital. In January 1288, as Omar's fleet passed through the Ha Long Bay, followed by Zhang Wenhu's supply fleet, the Vietnamese navy under prince Tr·∫ßn Kh√°nh D∆∞ attacked and destroyed Wenhu's fleet. The Yuan land army under Toghan and naval fleet under Omar, both already in V·∫°n Ki·∫øp (today H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng province), were unaware of the loss of their supply fleet. Toghon returned back to the capital ThƒÉng Long to loot food, while Omar destroying king Tr·∫ßn Th√°i T√¥ng's tomb in Th√°i B√¨nh. Due to a lack of food supplies, Toghon and Omar's army retreated from ThƒÉng Long to their fortified main base in V·∫°n Ki·∫øp (northeast of Hanoi) on 5 March 1288. They planned to withdraw from ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát but waited for the supplies to arrive before departing. As food supplies ran low and their positions became untenable, Toghon decided on 30 March 1288 to return to China. Toghon boarded a large warship for himself and the Yuan land force could not withdraw in the same way from which they came. Tr·∫ßn H∆∞ng ƒê·∫°o, aware of the Yuan retreat, prepared to attack. The Vietnamese had destroyed bridges, roads and creating traps along the retreating Yuan route. They pursued Toghon's forces to L·∫°ng S∆°n, where in April 10, Toghon was forced to abandoned his ship, avoided highway and was escorted back to China by his few remaining troops through the forests. Most of Toghon's land force were killed or captured. Meanwhile, the Yuan fleet commanded by Omar were retreating through the B·∫°ch ƒê·∫±ng river. At the B·∫°ch ƒê·∫±ng River in April 1288, the Vietnamese prince Tr·∫ßn H∆∞ng ƒê·∫°o ambushed Omar's Yuan fleet in the third Battle of B·∫°ch ƒê·∫±ng. The Vietnamese forces placed hidden metal-tipped wooden stakes in the riverbed and attacked the fleet once it had been impaled on the stakes. Omar himself was taken as a prisoner of war. The Yuan fleet was destroyed and the army retreated in disarray without supplies. In 1288, the Yuan army engaged the Vietnamese army at the Th√°i B√¨nh River in a battle during which Toghan was struck by a poisoned arrow. Several thousand Yuan troops, unfamiliar with the terrain, were lost and never regained contact with the main force. An account of the battle from L√™ T·∫Øc, a Vietnamese scholar who defected to the Yuan in 1285, said that the remnants of the army followed him north in retreat and reached Yuan-controlled territory on Lunar New Year's Day in 1289. After three further months in ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát, the Yuan army were withdrawn before malaria season. Aftermath =Yuan= As late as 1293, Kublai Khan planned a fourth military campaign to install Tr·∫ßn √çch T·∫Øc as the King of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát, but the plans for the campaign were halted when Kublai Khan died in early 1294. According to the book History of Yuan, the Yuan dynasty had mobilized up to 1 million people (troops, civilians) for the second and third invasion of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát and Champa. =ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát= The Tr·∫ßn monarchs of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát decided to accept the supremacy of the Yuan dynasty in order to avoid further conflicts. In 1289, ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát released most of Mongol prisoners of war back to China, but Omar, whose return Kublai particularly demanded, was intentionally drowned when the boat transporting him was contrived to sink. In the winter of 1289‚Äì1290, the Tr·∫ßn ruler Tr·∫ßn Nh√¢n T√¥ng led an attack into modern-day Laos, against the advice of his advisors, with the goal of preventing raids from the inhabitants of the highlands. Famines and starvations ravaged the country from 1290 to 1292. There were no records of what caused the crop failures, but possible factors included neglect of the water control system due to the war, the mobilization of men away from the rice fields, and floods or drought. In 1293, Kublai detained the Vietnamese envoy, ƒê√†o T·ª≠ K√≠, because Tr·∫ßn Nh√¢n T√¥ng refused to go to Beijing in person. Kublai's successor Tem√ºr Khan (r.1294-1307), later released all detained envoys and resumed their tributary relationship initially established after the first invasion, which continued to the end of the Yuan. The The Travels of Marco Polo describes Marco Polo's 1288 visit to ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát: > Caugigu [Giao Ch·ªâ] is a province towards the east, which has a king. The > people are Idolaters, and have a language of their own. They have made their > submission to the Great Kaan, and send him tribute every year. And let me > tell you their king is so given to luxury that he hath at the least 300 > wives; for whenever he hears of any beautiful woman in the land, he takes > and marries her.

The initial Mongol goal of placing ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát, a tributary state of the Southern Song dynasty, as their own tributary state was accomplished after the first invasion. However, the Mongols failed to impose their demands of greater tribute and direct darughachi oversight over ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát's internal affairs during their second invasion and their goal of replacing the uncooperative Tr·∫ßn Nh√¢n T√¥ng with Tr·∫ßn √çch T·∫Øc as the King of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát during the third invasion. Nonetheless, friendly relations were established and Dai Viet continued to pay tribute to the Mongol court.Simons, G. The Vietnam Syndrome: Impact on US Foreign Policy. Palgrave Macmillan; 1998 edition (October 27, 1997). p. 53. Walker, Hugh Dyson. East Asia: A New History. AuthorHouse (November 20, 2012). p. 242. Vietnamese historiography emphasizes the Vietnamese military victories. The three invasions, and the Battle of B·∫°ch ƒê·∫±ng in particular, are remembered within Vietnam and Vietnamese historiography as prototypical examples of Vietnamese resistance against foreign aggression.

It lies within the civil parish of Haccombe with Combe, between Newton Abbot and Shaldon, about half a mile (1 km) inland from the estuary of the River Teign. Despite this closeness to the river, the name Combeinteignhead is not derived from it: in the Domesday Book the district contained thirteen manors which totalled an area of ten hides and the whole area was known as the \\"Ten Hide\\". This was later corrupted to Teignhead through the influence of the river name. The name of the nearby village of Stokeinteignhead has a similar derivation.Gover, J.E.B., Mawer, A. & Stenton, F.M. (1931). The Place-Names of Devon. English Place-Names Society. Vol viii. Part II. Cambridge University Press. P.459. The village has two historic pubs: the Wild Goose Inn, originally called the Country House Inn, a 17th-century tavern in the centre of the village, and the Coombe Cellars Inn, right on the estuary of the River Teign. Coombe Cellars was an early base for the local fishing industry and was also used by smugglers. The village church (dedicated to All Saints) has ancient origins: Bishop Bronescombe dedicated two altars here in 1259, and the high altar was dedicated in 1339. The present building dates from the 14th and 15th centuries; it was restored in the 1880s, but retains its 12th century font. Henry de Bracton was rector here for a short time in the 13th century. The pews have fascinating carved bench ends dating from Elizabethan times. These include many well known and obscure saints as well as wild men, animals, St George in armour spearing a dog-like dragon, and some depictions that are difficult to identify. They may be the finest wood carvings in Devon. The nearby almshouses built of red sandstone were founded in 1620 by William Bourchin.

The Uzi submachine gun is arguably the most popular submachine gun in the world, because of its compact nature and reliability. Overall, the Uzi has the highest sales statistics of all modern submachine guns, worldwide. The IMI Galil is a compact assault rifle, along with integrating some other design features. The Negev is IMI's main light machine gun. The Jericho 941 is a semi-automatic pistol, while the Tavor is a bullpup assault rifle. In the 1980s an American firearms designer, Magnum Research, contracted IMI to re- design and manufacture a Magnum caliber (.44 Magnum, .357 Magnum and .50 AE), semi-automatic pistol. The result was the Desert Eagle, a very powerful handgun made famous by Hollywood and first-person shooters. Other products are created, mainly for use by the IDF. The Uzi, however, is popular with many forces worldwide, while the Galil and Tavor are popular with counter-terrorist forces. In 2005, Israel Military Industries sold its Magen division (Small Arms Division) to Israeli privately owned holding company SK Group and renamed Israel Weapon Industries. Other products Entrance to IMI headquarters IMI has dedicated factories manufacturing ammunition for firearms, artillery (both explosive rounds and rockets), tanks and air-to-ground (both stand-off and direct attack). Many of its products are standard NATO-compatible, but IMI also produces eastern bloc-caliber munitions. However, for the past the weapons have not been STANAG compliant. Besides small arms, the IMI also produces heavy weapons. IMI engages in many upgrade projects for military vehicles (tanks, APCs and other armoured fighting vehicles). Upgrade components include firepower, survivability and maneuverability. IMI also produces a wide range of defensive products such as vehicle add-on armor packages, landmine clearing systems, and reconnaissance systems and bridges.

M W Greenslade and R B Pugh (London, Victoria County History series), pp. 309-315, notes 2‚Äì6. Accessed 1 February 2016.) is an obscure Anglo-Saxon abbess associated with Polesworth (Warwickshire) and Tamworth (Staffordshire) in Mercia. Her historical identity and floruit are uncertain. Some late sources make her a daughter of King Edward the Elder, while other sources claim she is the daughter of Egbert of Wessex. Her feast day is 15 July. Identity Edith (Ealdgyth) is included in the first section of the late Old English saints' list known as Secgan, which locates her burial place at Polesworth.Yorke, Nunneries and the Anglo-Saxon royal houses, pp. 77-8. The question of St Edith's historical identity is fraught with difficulties. =As sister to a West-Saxon king= The tradition which was written down at the monastery of Bury St Edmunds in the 12th century and was later re-told by Roger of Wendover (d. 1236) and Matthew Paris (d. 1259) asserts that she was a sister of King √Üthelstan, who gave her in marriage to Sihtric C√°ech, a hiberno-scandinavian King of southern Northumbria and Dublin. It then suggests that the marriage was never consummated. When Sihtric broke his side of the agreement by renouncing the Christian religion and died soon thereafter, she returned south and founded a nunnery at Polesworth, not far from the Mercian royal seat at Tamworth, spending the rest of her life as a devout nun and virgin.Hudson, Viking Pirates and Christian Princes. pp. 28-9. The story appears to take its cue from an earlier source, the D-version of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which confirms that on 30 January 926 King √Üthelstan married his sister to Sihtric (d. 927) and attended the wedding feast at the Mercian royal centre of Tamworth. The Chronicle, however, gives no name. Reporting on the same event in the early part of the 12th century, William of Malmesbury identified her as a daughter of Edward the Elder and Ecgwynn, and therefore a full-blooded sister to √Üthelstan, but says that he was unable to discover her name in any of the sources available to him.William of Malmesbury, Gesta regum, Book II, ch. 126. A variant version of the Bury tradition, which locates her burial place at Tamworth rather than Polesworth, identifies this Edith as a daughter of √Ülffl√¶d, Edward's second wife, and hence √Üthelstan's half-sister.Thacker, \\"Dynastic monasteries and family cults\\", pp. 257-8'Hyde' Chronicle, ed. Edwards, p. 11. However, another late source drawing upon earlier material, the early 13th-century Chronicle of John of Wallingford, names Sihtric's wife Orgiue.Hudson, \\"√ìl√°f Sihtricson\\" These late, contradictory statements have garnered a mixed response from modern historians. Some scholars favour Roger's identification or at least the possibility that her name was Eadgyth/Edith.Hudson, Viking pirates and Christian princes, p. 29, considers it possible that her name was Eadgyth (and hence also a source for confusion with namesakes). Alan Thacker, for instance, states that \\"given the strong Mercian connections of √Üthelstan himself, it is not at all unlikely that such a woman, if repudiated, should have ended her days in a community in the former heartlands of the Mercian royal family. Perhaps, like √Üthelstan, she had been brought up at the Mercian court.\\". Barbara Yorke, however, argues that the name Eadgyth is unlikely to belong to two of Edward's daughters at the same time, the other being a daughter by √Ülffl√¶d. A slightly earlier if largely legendary source which potentially casts some light on traditions surrounding St Edith is Conchubran's Life of Saint Modwenna, a female hermit who supposedly lived near Burton-on-Trent. The text, written in the early 11th century, mentions a sister of King Alfred by the name of Ite, a nun who served as the saint's tutor and had a maidservant called Osid. Although an Irish nun called St Ita was active in the 7th century, Ite's name has been interpreted as \\"almost certainly a garbling of Edith\\" and that of Osid a rendering of Osgyth.Bartlett, Geoffrey of Burton. Life and miracles of Modwenna, pp. xviii-xix. =As early Mercian saint= Yorke prefers to identify the historical figure of Edith with an earlier namesake instead. The saint's inclusion in Secgan, grouped as she is with other early saints buried near rivers, may be taken as evidence for the hypothesis that she was a Mercian saint who flourished in the 7th or 8th century.Yorke, Nunneries and the Anglo-Saxon royal houses, pp. 22, 39 n. 58, 77-8. According to Alan Thacker, on the other hand, the entry in Secgan may also be a later addition, along with at least two other items which seem to reflect interests peculiar to √Üthelstan's time. Later traditions The saint is commemorated in a number of churches around the Midlands, the most notable of these being Polesworth Abbey and the Collegiate Church of Tamworth, which bears her name. Other churches dedicated to St. Edith include Church Eaton in Staffordshire, Amington Parish Church (in Tamworth), St Edith's Church in Monks Kirby, Warwickshire as well as a number of churches in Louth, Lincolnshire.

Function  The protein encoded by this intronless gene is a bZIP transcription factor that can bind as a homodimer to certain DNA regulatory regions. It can also form heterodimers with the related proteins CEBP-alpha, CEBP-delta, and CEBP-gamma. The encoded protein is important in the regulation of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses and has been shown to bind to the IL-1 response element in the IL-6 gene, as well as to regulatory regions of several acute-phase and cytokine genes. In addition, the encoded protein can bind the promoter and upstream element and stimulate the expression of the collagen type I gene. CEBP-beta is critical for normal macrophage functioning, an important immune cell sub-type; mice unable to express CEBP-beta have macrophages that cannot differentiate (specialize) and thus are unable to perform all their biological functions - including macrophage-mediated muscle repair. Observational work has shown that expression of CEBP-beta in blood leukocytes is positively associated with muscle strength in humans, emphasizing the importance of the immune system, and particularly macrophages, in the maintenance of muscle function. Function of CEBPB gene can be effectively examined by siRNA knockdown based on an independent validation.  Target genes  CEBPB is capable of increasing the expression of several target genes. Among them, some have specific role in the nervous system such as the preprotachykinin-1 gene, giving rise to substance P and neurokinin A and the choline acetyltransferase responsible for the biosynthesis of the important neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Other targets include genes coding for cytokines such as IL-6, IL-4, IL-5, and TNF-alpha. Genes coding for transporter proteins that confer multidrug resistance to the cells have also been found to be activated by CEBPB. Such genes include ABCC2 and ABCB1.

The enigmatic postexilic biblical leader receives a revelatory vision outlining personalities and events associated with the restoration of Israel, the End of Days, and the establishment of the Third Temple.  History  The groundwork for the book was probably written in Palestine between 629 and 636, during fierce struggles between Persia and the Byzantine Empire for control of the Holy Land (qq.v. Byzantine-Arab Wars, Muslim conquest of Syria). These wars touched Byzantine Palestine and stirred Messianic hopes among Jews, including the author for whom the wars appear to be eschatological events leading to the appearance of the Messiah. Armilus is thought to be a cryptogram for Heraclius, and that the events described in the Sefer Zerubbabel coincide with the Jewish revolt against Heraclius. However, firm evidence of the work's existence prior to the tenth century is elusive. The Zohar is cognizant of the legend of Hephzibah whom the apocalypse first names as the mother of the Davidic Messiah. Rabbis Saadia Gaon (892‚Äì942) and Hai ben Sherira Gaon (939‚Äì1038) probably knew the book, but never mention it by name. Sefer Zerubbabel is extant in a number of manuscript and print recensions. What may be the oldest manuscript copy is part of a prayer book reportedly dated to about 840 CE. The first publication was in 1519 in Constantinople within an anthology called Liqqutim Shonim. It was reprinted again along with the Sefer Malkiel in Vilna in 1819, and again by Adolph Jellinek in his Bet Ha-Midrasch (1853‚Äì77) and S. A. Wertheimer in his Leqet Midrashim (Jerusalem, 1903). The fullest edition of the work was prepared by Israel Levi in his book L'apocalypse. Because the book gave an unequivocal date (1058 CE) for the return of the Messiah, it exerted great influence upon contemporary Messianic thought. The book is mentioned by Eleazar of Worms and supposedly by Rashi. Abraham ibn Ezra criticized the book as \\"unreliable.\\" One edition of the Pirke Hekalot gave a figure of 890 years until the return of the Messiah, making the Messianic year 958 CE, within a decade of the birth of Saadia Gaon. That date perhaps led to a message sent by Rhenish Jews to Palestine inquiring after rumors of the Messiah's advent.  Contents  The sefer describes the eschatological struggle between the Antichrist Armilus,also spelled Armilos, Armilius who is the leader of Rome and Christianity, and the Messiah ben Joseph, who fails in battle but paves the way for the Davidic Messiah and the ultimate triumph of righteousness. The original author expected the Messiah would come in the immediate future; subsequent editors substituted later dates. Set after Nebuchadnezzar's destruction of Jerusalem, the book begins with Zerubbabel, whose name was associated with the first restoration, receiving a vision after praying for \\"knowledge of the form of the eternal house.\\" In the vision he is transported by the angel Metatron to Ninevah, the \\"city of blood\\" representing Rome by which the author likely means Byzantium. There he finds in the marketplace a \\"bruised and despised man\\" named Menahem ben Ammiel who reveals himself to be the Messiah ben David, doomed to abide there until his appointed hour. Zerubbabel asks when the lamp of Israel would be kindled. Metatron interjects that the Messiah would return 990 years after the destruction of the Temple (approximately 1058 CE). Five years prior to the coming of Hefzibah,also spelled Hephsibah, Hephzibah who would be the mother of the Messiah ben David, the Messiah ben Joseph, Nehemiah ben Hushiel, will appear but he will be slain by Armilus. Afterwards, the Messiah ben David will resurrect him. The Sefer Zerubbabel mentions Gog and Armilos rather than Gog and Magog as the enemies. In the narrative Zerubbabel is led to a \\"house of disgrace\\" (a church), a kind of antitemple. There he sees a beautiful statue of a woman (the Virgin Mary). With Satan as the father, the statue gives birth to the Antichrist Armilus. Forces associated with Armilus and the antitemple come to rule over the entire world. But in the end these forces are defeated. The work concludes with Zerubbabel's vision of the descent of the Heavenly Temple to earth. Thus the \\"form of the eternal house\\" is revealed; unlike the Second Temple it is made in heaven. According to Martha Himmelfarb (2002) alongside from a passage in the Tractate Berakhot 2.4 10ff in the Talmud Yerushalmi, dealing with the mother of the Messiah Menahem ben Ammiel, Sefer Zerubbabel is the only early Jewish text to import a mother of the Messiah into Judaism.The Talmud Yerushalmi and Graeco-Roman culture: Volume 3 - Page 369 Peter Sch√§fer, Catherine Hezser - 2002 The Mother of the Messiah in the Talmud Yerushalmi and Sefer Zerubbabel by Martha Himmelfarb \\"Through the centuries the Virgin Mary has played a central role in Christian piety.

Managerial career Wheeler joined Bradford City as manager in June 1968. He was the first full-time manager since the death of Grenville Hair in training in March 1968, with coach Jim McAnearney and captain Tom Hallett taking over first-time duties in the intermediate period. Wheeler had instant success at Valley Parade and secured promotion from Division Four in 1968‚Äì69 which included a record-breaking sequence of 21 games without defeat to come fourth. The following season started well but results tailed off and the team came 10th in Division Three.

Specific requirements relating to the structure of the Certification Body in relation to training is included in this section. Specifically, if the certification body also offers training it must demonstrate how the impartiality of the certification is not compromised by the training. Resource Requirements This section describes the resource requirements for Certification Bodies for Persons. Resource requirements include criteria for the personnel and staff of the Certification Body for Persons. Specific requirements for persons (both internal to the organization and external to the organization such as consultants and volunteers) involved in certification activities are included as are criteria associated with outsourcing to other bodies. This section also includes requirements for other resources such as examination equipment required to operate the certification activities. Records and Information Requirements This section describes the records and information requirements for Certification Bodies for Persons. The requirements include criteria relating to the records of applicants, candidates and certified persons. Requirements regarding information that must be made public as well as information that must be kept confidential are included in this section and criteria for the information security (exam papers, etc.) are described. Certification Scheme This section includes requirements for the development and maintenance of the certification scheme. The certification scheme is the competence and other requirements for awarding the certification to a person and includes a scope of certification, job and task description, required competence, abilities (when applicable), prerequisites (when applicable), and a code of conduct (when applicable). Criteria for the initial certification and recertification must be part of the scheme and includes description of the assessment methods, and the criteria for suspending and withdrawing the certification. Certification Process Requirements This section includes requirements for the certification process including criteria for the certification application process, assessment process, examination process, and the decision on certification. Criteria for suspending, withdrawing or reducing the scope of certification and recertification requirements are included in this section. This section also includes requirements for the use of certificates, logos and marks, and requirements associated with appeals and complaints. Management System Requirements This section requires the Certification Body for Persons to establish, document, implement and maintain a management system capable of supporting the requirements of the standard. A body that has established and maintains a management system in accordance with ISO 9001 and that is capable of supporting ISO/IEC 17024 fulfills the management system requirements of ISO/IEC 17024. ISO/IEC 17024:2003 Released by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 2003, ISO/IEC 17024 was designed to harmonize the personnel certification process worldwide.Davies, S: \\"Easy reference for ISO 17024\\", Personnel Certification and Training, June 2007 In the European Union ISO/IEC 17024 replaced EN 45013 (1989), which was published in the UK as BS 7513:1989. The issues that ISO 17024 tackles can be summarized as: *Defining what it is you examine (the competencies) *Knowledge, skills and personal attributes *Examination must be independent *Examination must be a valid test of competence Where competency is typically described as ‚Äúthe demonstrated ability to apply knowledge, skills and attributes‚Äù. Guidance Each accreditation body provides various levels of guidance around compliance and the implementation of ISO 17024.

Early life Howat was born in Glasgow, Scotland. As a boy he was awarded a bursary to Glenalmond College. He continued his education at Edinburgh University. He then did his National Service as a Flying Officer based at RAF Titchfield. Academic career He spent three years teaching for the oil firm Trinidad Leaseholds Ltd at Pointe-√†-Pierre. Sonny Ramadhin was the firm's storekeeper. Returning to England, he was head of the history department at Kelly College in Tavistock for five years, followed by fourteen years at Culham College of Education as principal lecturer and head of the history department. He was able to combine his love of cricket with his college duties by instituting the biannual cricket matches between the History Department and his village cricket team of North Moreton for whom he was wicketkeeper and captain. One regularly told story was that he conducted an interview out on the cricket square when one potential teaching student applied who was already on the books of Yorkshire Cricket Club! Unfortunately for Howat, the student did not take up the place which was presumably offered to him, but did go on to have a reasonably successful cricket career. He had an abrupt tutoring technique and once (at least) locked the door when the time of his tutor group was due to start which left only one student in the room (at the magnificent mansion of Nuneham) to enjoy his didactic and engaging teaching style. Meanwhile, he undertook a research degree on \\"the place of history in education\\" for Exeter College, Oxford. He also turned his hand to the world of publishing, for a time being general editor of the Historical Division of Pergamon Press. He wrote several school textbooks, and was general editor of a Dictionary of World History (1973), a massive project which involved working closely with an advisory board that included A.J.P. Taylor, Max Beloff and Asa Briggs. He also spent a year with Mitchell Beazley editing an illustrated biographical dictionary entitled Who Did What (1974). He was Head of History at Radley College, but writing and editing were taking much of his attention, and neither he nor the school was very happy with his time there. He said: \\"I was not ambitious to be a headmaster and I came to resent the fact that I never had time to put pen to paper (or, more specifically, to write a book) during my years there.\\" In 1977, he moved to a senior pastoral post at Lord Williams's School, Thame, which gave him more time to pursue his other interests. For a short period he was also a visiting professor at Western Kentucky University. He also acted as an Oxbridge Board examiner. He retired from teaching in 1985. He was an associate editor of the 2004 edition of the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. He supplied seventy entries himself, many on former cricketers. Cricket literature He covered schools cricket for The Daily Telegraph for many years, as well as for The Cricketer. His retirement from academia gave him more time for his cricket writing, and he produced several well received biographies of famous players. That on Learie Constantine, whom he had first met when at Glenalmond College, won the Cricket Society's golden jubilee award. His last book was his autobiography, Cricket All My Life. This was published only a few months before his death and refers to his poor health although it ended on a positive note with a reference to his return to Lord's for a committee meeting and how he \\"was coming home\\". He was an MCC member for over 40 years. He chaired the club's publishing working party. He seemed well-qualified to serve on the arts and library sub- committee, but he did not get on with the sub-committee's chairman, E.W. Swanton. Howat played club cricket as a wicket-keeper for Moreton CC in Oxfordshire until he was 77. He was associated with the club for almost fifty years. Family He had three children: David, Gillian and Michael. Michael played first-class cricket for Cambridge University as a medium-fast bowler, appearing in the University Match in 1977 and 1980.Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 2008 edition, Obituaries section. Gerald was the Chairman of TASS (The Abingdon School Society), where his sons were educated. Death Howat died at Oxford on 10 October 2007 at age 79.

For aerial vehicles the advantages of performing formation flight include fuel saving, improved efficiency in air traffic control and cooperative task allocation. For space vehicles precise control of formation flight may enable future large aperture space telescopes, variable baseline space interferometers, autonomous rendezvous and docking and robotic assembly of space structures. One of the simplest formations used is where autonomous aircraft maintain formation with a lead aircraft which may itself be autonomous.  Civil aviation  WeFly! Team of Fly Synthesis Texans at an airshow In civil aviation, Formation flying is proposed to reduce fuel use by minimizing drag. Formation flying is performed at air shows or for recreation. In the early 2000s, NASA‚Äôs Autonomous Formation Flight program used a pair of F/A-18s. In 2013, the Air Force Research Laboratory‚Äôs Surfing Aircraft Vortices for Energy project showed 10-15% in fuel savings, installed on two Boeing C-17 Globemaster IIIs. In 2017, NASA measured 8%-10% lower fuel flow with two Gulfstream III aircraft on wake surfing test flights. In 2018, the ecoDemonstrator, a Boeing 777F freighter from FedEx Express, had its fuel consumption reduced by 5-10% with the autopilot maintaining the separation based on ADS-B and TCAS information. By taking advantage of wake updraft like migrating birds (biomimicry), Airbus believes an aircraft can save 5-10% of fuel by flying behind the preceding one. After A380s tests showing 12% savings, it launched its 'fello'fly' project in November 2019 for test flights in 2020 with two A350s, before transatlantic flight trials with airlines in 2021. Certification for shorter separation is enabled by ADS-B in oceanic airspace, and the only modification required would be flight control systems software. Comfort would not be affected and trials are limited to two aircraft to reduce complexity but the concept could be expanded to include more.

The IRA unit, firing from the back of an armoured dump truck, attacked the small base with heavy machine- guns, grenades, anti-tank rockets and a flamethrower. A nearby Army patrol arrived at the scene and a fierce firefight erupted. The IRA withdrew after leaving a van bomb inside the complex, but it did not fully detonate. The assault on the outpost left two soldiers dead and two wounded.  Planning  According to journalist Ed Moloney, the IRA Army Council, suspecting a great deal of infiltration by double agents at the grassroots level of the IRA, decided to form an experimental flying column (instead of the usual active service unit) to mount a large-scale operation against a permanent vehicle checkpoint along the border. It hoped that this would prevent any information leak that could result in another fiasco like the Loughgall Ambush of 1987. Moloney maintains that the planning was in the charge of Thomas Murphy, alleged leader of the South Armagh Brigade, and that the raid was to be led by East Tyrone Brigade member Michael \\"Pete\\" Ryan. Journalist Ian Bruce instead claims that the IRA unit was led by an Irish citizen who had served in the Parachute Regiment, citing intelligence sources.Ex-Para 'led attack by IRA which killed Scots soldiers' by Ian Bruce, Herald Scotland, 2 January 1990 The column was made up of about 20 experienced IRA volunteers from throughout Northern Ireland, 11 of whom would carry out the attack itself.Moloney, Ed (2003). A secret story of the IRA. W.W. Norton & co. . p.333 Bruce reported that IRA members from County Monaghan, supported by local Fermanagh militants, carried out the raid.  Attack  The target was a permanent vehicle checkpoint at Derryard. Described as a \\"mini base\\", it included an accommodation block and defensive sangars. It was manned by eight soldiers of the 1st Battalion, King's Own Scottish Borderers and a Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) officer. The 11 IRA members would be driven to the checkpoint in the back of a makeshift Bedford armoured dumper truck. They were armed with 7.62mm AK-47s and 5.56mm Armalite AR-18s, two 12.7mm DShK heavy machine-guns, RPG-7s, different kinds of grenades, and a LPO-50 flamethrower. The heavy machine guns and the flamethrower were mounted on a tripod on the lorry bed. To assure widespread destruction, the column would detonate a van bomb after the initial assault. The attack took place shortly after 4PM.McKittrick, David (1999). Lost lives: the stories of the men, women and children who died through the Northern Ireland troubles. Mainstream, p. 1187; IRA members sealed off roads leading to the checkpoint in an attempt to prevent civilians from getting caught up in the attack. The truck was driven from the border and halted at the checkpoint. As Private James Houston began to check the back of the truck, the IRA opened fire with assault rifles and threw grenades into the compound. Two RPG-7s were fired at the observation sangar while the flamethrower stream was directed at the command sangar. Heavy shooting continued as the truck reversed and smashed through the gates of the compound. At least three IRA volunteers dismounted inside the checkpoint and sprayed the portacabins with gunfire and the flamethrower's fire stream, while throwing grenades and nail bombs. The defenders were forced to seek shelter in sangars, from where they fired into their own base. A farmer some distance away saw an orange ball of flames and heard gunfire 'raking the fields'. As the truck drove out of the now wrecked compound, a red transit van loaded with a 400 lb (182 kg) bomb was driven inside and set to detonate once the IRA unit had made its escape. However, only the booster charge exploded. The attack was finally repulsed by a four-men Borderers section from the checkpoint that was patrolling nearby, with the support of a Wessex helicopter. The patrol fired more than 100 rounds at the IRA unit. The Wessex received gunfire, and was forced to take evasive action. The IRA column, at risk of being surrounded, fled toward the border in the truck. It was found abandoned at the border with a bomb on board. Two soldiers were killed in the attack: Private James Houston (22) from England and Lance-Corporal Michael Patterson (21) from Scotland. Corporal Whitelaw was badly wounded by shrapnel\\"2 British Soldiers Killed in Raid\\". Associated Press, 14 December 1989. and later airlifted for treatment. Another soldier suffered minor injuries.  Aftermath  There was outrage in Westminster and among unionists, as a supposedly well-defended border post had been overrun by the IRA and two soldiers killed. On the other hand, according to Moloney, there was also some disappointment among republicans. Despite the positive propaganda effect, the quick and strong reaction from the outpost's defenders convinced some high-ranking IRA members that the Army Council had been infiltrated by a mole.Moloney, p. 334 A senior British military officer, when quizzed about the IRA attack, said: > They are murdering bastards, but they are not cowards. This team actually > pressed home a ground attack right into the heart of the compound. That > takes guts when there are people firing back. KOSB officers and security sources believed that the IRA unit involved was not locally recruited, putting the blame instead on IRA members from Clogher (County Tyrone) and South Monaghan (in the Republic).\\"Calculating, professional enemy that faces KOSB\\" by Ian Bruce. Herald Scotland, 15 December 1989 The same sources said that the attack was executed \\"in true backside-or- bust Para style\\". Major Bob Andrew, the KOSB garrison commander at Cookstown, went on to say: > The Provos in Belfast or Londonderry tend to stage incidents timed to catch > the six o'clock news.

After the action of Derryard, the British Army in Northern ireland were issued the French designed Luchaire 40mm rifle grenade, fitted on the muzzle of the SA80 rifle. This gave the troops a lightweight armour piercing capability to deal with the threat imposed by improvise armoured vehicles. Permanent checkpoints along the border were also fitted with GPMG machine guns. From 1990 until the end of the IRA campaign in 1997, there were a number of further bloodless, small-scale attacks against permanent vehicle checkpoints along this part of the border using automatic weapons, particularly in County Fermanagh\\"IRA cease-fire ends\\".

The organization was formed in 1965 as a project proposed by members of the American Theatre Association. The College is now an independent not-for-profit organization.  Activities  Membership in the college is conferred on individuals of acknowledged national stature who have distinguished themselves during careers of notable dedication, exceptional service and outstanding achievement. Fewer than ten new Fellows are created each year, but almost 200 persons have been so honored to date. The majority are still living and most are still active in the theatre to some degree. The College meets each year at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. in conjunction with the Kennedy Center/American College Theatre Festival. Festival participants are invited to the College of Fellows Annual Lecture, which honors Roger L. Stevens, founder and first Chairman of the Center. Each year one of the Fellows is selected to give a lecture on the topic of his or her choice. On the eve of the meeting day, Fellows and their guests honor the new class of Fellows-Elect at the College's Annual Dinner. The college bestows its public recognition and honors in order to encourage and promote excellence in research and creativity in both the educational and the professional theatre. Among the Fellows are actors, theatre critics, costume designers, directors, scene designers, playwrights, lighting designers, producers and administrators, research scholars, and teachers, any of whom may be associated with the commercial as well as the educational theatre in America. Each year at the annual meeting, and in individual sessions elsewhere during the year, distinguished members of the organization are interviewed on video tape in order to preserve the history of American theatre with which they have been involved. A history of the Fellows was published in 1995: American Theatre Fellows: the First Thirty Years, edited by Jed H. Davis and an advisory board consisting of the dean and deans emeriti of the College.

It was a three-hour fight which could have been prevented if Augustus II of Poland had informed the Swedes and Russians of certain matters. At the time, an alliance existed between the Poles, Saxons, and Russians. The battle was fought by Russian cavalry, led by commander Aleksandr Menshikov; against a smaller Swedish force headed by colonel Mardefelt. The Russians played a role of significance here because they needed to support their Saxon allies under Augustus. Prelude Charles XII of Sweden's victory in the Battle of Fraustadt had forced August the Strong of the Electorate of Saxony to drop out of the Great Northern War and abdicate his claims to the Polish crown in the Treaty of Altranst√§dt, marking an end to the Civil war in Poland (1704-1706).Frost (2000), p.230 When he learned of the recently arranged treaty while on his travels with Menshikov, Augustus chose to keep the news from him. His decision was based on the Russians' support through generosity in expenses. They were prepared to fight for him and Augustus could not risk angering his ally with the recently learned information. His last attempt to mend the situation was also unsuccessful. He sent word to the waiting Swedish force begging them to retreat upon meeting, but Mardefelt, having been unaware of the treaty, interpreted the plea as a trick of battle. As a result of poor communication, and to Augustus' dismay, the Battle of Kalisz did occur. At the time, king Augustus of Poland, also the Electorate of Saxony, had in secret negotiated a peace treaty with the swedes. This because after five years of marching, war and burning, the swedes had attacked Augustus where it hurt; his own electorate. Thus, the main Swedish army was at the time in Saxony. August himself, however, was with the Russian commander Menshikov and the third Russian army, which numbered 18,000 Russians. These were sent by Tsar Peter after the previous two had been defeated and dispersed. August had not informed Menshikov of the peace treaty because of the large contributions from Russia, and tried to avoid a battle, as he knew that his deceit would anger the swedes. August secretly sent a letter to the Swedish major general Arvid Axel Marderfelt who was in command of the small Swedish army stationed in western Poland. August declared that the peace was almost concluded, and that he hoped to be informed of this by the Swedish king, Charles XII, and that a battle would thus be avoided. Marderfelt had, however, not been informed of this (the couriers had most likely been killed by kossacks). Marderfelt thus concluded that the letter was yet another of Augusts' deceits and replied that he had not received any information of the peace and would stand his ground in the case of a battle. In reality, he was more concerned than he wished to admit. Battle The Swedes had about 4,358 men present in the vicinity of which one regiment and two battalions consisted of foreign troops captured in the Battle of Fraustadt, while their Polish and Lithuanian allies could field around 9,000‚Äì10,000 men. The coalition army was twice as large and included 5,000 Saxons under Augustus II the Strong, 7,000 Poles and Lithuanians under Adam Miko≈Çaj Sieniawski and 9,000 Russians with equally many Cossacks and Kalmyks in Russian service under Alexander Danilovich Menshikov. In total 30,000 men according to their own stories. To the number, the Swedish army was vastly outnumbered with only 4 000 infantry troops, if it had not been for the allied Polish and Lithuanian cavalry. Mardefelt did not wish to engage the much larger Russian army, but the commander of the Polish crown army, J√≥zef Potocki, insisted on chasing the Russians out of the country. Mardefelt pointed out carefully that the Poles had not been keen on fighting Russians or anyone at all during the war, but Potocki convinced him that this time they would fight to the last drop of blood. When the battle commenced, the Swedish infantry lined up in the middle with the Polish and Lithuanians on the sides, protecting the flank. When the Russians advanced, the Poles immediately fled the battlefield and thus left the Swedish flank exposed. The Swedish infantry fought on, even though the outcome would be obvious. Aftermath In the battle and its immediate aftermath the Swedes and their Polish allies suffered 2,000 men killed and another 2,900 captured of which about 700 killed were Swedes with at least 1,800 captured. The Russian‚ÄìPolish‚ÄìSaxon counterpart lost up to 3,000 men in the battle of which, according to their own stories of two letters written after the battle, 806 killed and equally many wounded belonged to the Saxons and other Germans while the Russians (possibly with the irregular Cossacks and Kalmyks) had sustained 500 killed and 800 wounded.The Present State of Europe, Volume 17.

Also, although he had planned to originally renounce the Treaty of Altranst√§dt, Augustus went along with its terms. Finally 1,800 Swedish prisoners were returned.

The street is perpendicular to Leblon‚Äôs beach, starting in the Avenue Delphin Moreira and finishing in the staircase that gives access to the Capitao Cesar de Andrade street. It intersects with General San Martin avenue, Ataulfo de Paiva avenue, Professor Artur Ramos street, Jo√£o de Barros street, Humberto de Campos street, Dias Ferreira street, Desembargador Alfredo Russel street and Antero de Quental square. Its name is a homage to General Justo Jos√© de Urquiza, president of Argentina from 1853 to 1860. Before that, the street was known only as the 15th street. At first sight, the intense arborization gives an impression of homogeneity to the street, but when you walk along the street this sensation quickly disappears. The different height and style of the buildings is clearly heterogeneous. The street has a narrow one-directional road, and presents parking in both sides in almost all its extension. The sidewalk that used to present different widths along the street, is now being partially rectified by using fences, making walking along General Urquiza much less pleasant. The reason for the fences is to give security to the inhabitants against the increasing violence in Rio de Janeiro. The buildings present very different dates of construction, architectural styles and number of floors. From buildings preserved as part of the historic patrimony to buildings recently constructed due to property speculation. The number of floors ranges from buildings with two floors to buildings with even 13 floors. From simple flats with 50m¬≤ to luxurious attics of even 600m¬≤. Flats on the side next to the beach are more expensive that the one located on the other side. The General Urquiza street has non-residential buildings (stores, restaurants, banks, post offices and doctor offices), buildings for multiple use, that have stores at ground level and strictly residential at the others levels. Traffic in General Urquiza is usually calmed, only in the block from Antero de Quental square there is more movement. This is because of the location of 3 bus-stops in this block. These stops are also a good point for the street. These buses go across the downtown to the other zone of the city, providing the inhabitants with an important medium of transport. All this variety that the street presents makes it a place for inhabitants of different social levels and economic levels. General Urquiza Street is also a meeting point for young people in the Leblon beach. A common nickname for this street is \\"GU\\". Another important meeting point is the corner with Dias Ferreira Street.

His contributions One of his closest friends describes him as ‚Äúa pastor's pastor ‚Äì seeing light in the other, light as attractiveness in and with the other. He is a pastor of others within the Eucharist; within the Anglican Communion, pastor on behalf of Abrahamic communions and to human communities more generally.... all of whom he sees lit up by (the) divine attractiveness itself.... the great cosmic and ecclesial and divine communion of lights which draws him to it and to us and draws us to be near him.‚Äù (Peter Ochs) His vocation has been primarily about the seeking of God's wisdom. It has been prophetic insofar as it has attempted to engage more deeply with life in all its particularity. It has been priestly in tracing that prophetic wisdom to its source in the divine intensity of love and in seeking to mediate that love through the church for the whole world, concentratedly in the Eucharist: light and love together. Secondly his vocation is a tribute to the thinker who has perhaps more than any other been his teacher and inspiration over many decades, Samuel Taylor Coleridge. He recognized that Coleridge engaged deeply with God and most aspects of God's creation ‚Äì intellectually, imaginatively, practically, spiritually, emotionally and through much personal suffering. Above all Coleridge responded in all those ways to the attraction of the divine. He discerned the Word and the Spirit endlessly present, active and innovative lifting the world from within, raising it into its future - giving us a huge hope in God and God's future, and inviting us intensively and unremittingly to participate in that, as we are drawn through divine love into levels of existence of which we can hardly begin to imagine or dare to dream. His career The genesis of his vocation to ordination lay in his years as a student in Haverford College and in the finding of himself before God that was encouraged and enabled by participation in its regular Quaker worship. The rhythm and pattern of worship of General Theological Seminary, then built on this and was the most formative thing during his time as a student there. It was a daily invitation to go deeper into the intensity of God, an attraction that has perhaps been the most fundamental dynamic of his life. His title post (served in Christ Episcopal Church, Greenwich, Connecticut) added a second key dynamic. This is exemplified best through his engagement with a group of young people - beginning with what really mattered and was significant for them, and then trusting, discerning and helping them to recognise the source and energy of life (God's Spirit) already at work within their lives - (and) making the deep connections with the truth of the Gospel. They were hungry for this and the group began to thrive in just a short space of time. The curacy culminated in helping to design the new daughter church of St Barnabas, strengthening an interest in architecture that in later years has proved fruitful again and again both with actual buildings and with the architectonics of theology and institutions. He returned to General Theological Seminary as a fellow and tutor for two years, accompanied by his wife Perrin, who, together with their growing family, grew to be the cantus firmus of his life. The experience of teaching and a sense of the crying need for theological thinking led to further study in Oxford University. Yet that was in many ways a painful disappointment, finding a theology that was too influenced by positivist philosophy and rarely confident enough to explore the depths and wonders of God and God's ways with the world. The twenty-one years that followed were spent teaching in the University of Birmingham. The 'golden thread' of those rich and varied years was the pursuit of a theology that might give dedicated attention both to the intensity of God and to the way the world is, especially as described, interpreted and explained by theologians, philosophers and scientists since the sixteenth century. Exploring and testing their thought was a slow and often lonely task, but for several hours each week there was intensive conversation with the colleague who became his son-in-law, David F. Ford. Moving to the Van Mildert Professor of Divinity in Durham University and a canon in Durham Cathedral brought him back to a combination of daily worship with academic work. If he were to choose just one key element in those years it would be the fresh, multifaceted involvement in ecclesiology that this has remained at the forefront of his thinking ever since. He recrossed the Atlantic to be Director of the Princeton Center of Theological Inquiry for five years. Much of his time there was spent in rethinking the Center (along lines now happily being pursued by the current Director) and in working closely with individual members from many disciplines and many countries. But, judged in terms of long-term results, it is probably the relationship with one member, the Jewish philosopher Peter Ochs of the University of Virginia, that was the most fruitful. Peter, David F. Ford (of University of Cambridge) and he have spent much time over many years since the early 1990s working together with others developing the practice of Scriptural Reasoning, the shared study of our scriptures by Jews, Christians and Muslims. His involvement in the 1998 Lambeth Conferences and participation in some of the Primates' meetings during the years that followed made him long for a reconciliatory imagination and practice centred on scripture and nurturing a deeper and richer sociality, touching healingly the depths of each person. In October 2007, he received an honorary doctorate recognizing him for his life work from the General Theological Seminary. Death He died from a glioblastoma.

Malcolm X wearing browline glasses, of which he owned several pairs, each in different colours Malcolm X in Glasses Browline glasses are a style of eyeglass frames which were very popular during the 1950s and 1960s, especially in the United States of America. The name derives from the fact that the \\"bold\\" upper part of the frames frame the lenses in the same way that eyebrows frame the eyes. The glasses were first manufactured by Shuron Ltd in 1947 under the \\"Ronsir\\" brand, and quickly emulated by various other manufacturers. The design became the most common style of eyeglasses throughout the 1950s and the early 1960s before it was surpassed in popularity by solid plastic styles. Browlines enjoyed a renaissance as sunglasses in the 1980s before returning to popularity in the 2010s, with the rise of retro style and the hipster subculture. Description Browline glasses are constructed in such a way that the upper portion of the frame is thicker than the lower portion, simulating additional eyebrows or otherwise drawing attention to the wearer's natural brow line. The most common means of construction is for the upper portion of the frame (the \\"brows\\" or \\"caps\\") and temples to be made of plastic, with the remainder of the frame (the bridge and eyewires, or \\"chassis\\") to be made of metal. The chassis inserts into the brows and is held in place by way of a series of screws. For a period in the 1960s, numerous models emerged in which the brows were constructed from aluminium; following the style's resurgence in the 2000s, browlines made wholly out of one type of metal with less pronounced brow portions became popular. =Monobrowlines= Monobrowlines are a variant of browlines in which the bridge is contiguous with the caps, creating a solid, unbroken line across the top of the frame. The style dates back to the Shuron Stag, a browline prototype, which enjoyed some brief popularity before being replaced by the Ronsir as Shuron's flagship frame. The original stag had no metal chassis: the lenses were mounted directly to the brow caps via two sets of screws. Although the style was never popular in the United States, it became particularly fashionable in Europe and England in the 1960s as part of Amor's Spotlite line. The modern monobrowline originated in the 1980s, as part of an effort by Bausch and Lomb to diversify their Ray-Ban sunglass collection with the Wayfarer Max, a fusion of the then-popular Wayfarer and Clubmaster sunglass models. The style proved unpopular and was quickly phased out. The monobrowline design was resurrected by a variety of manufacturers in the 2010s (chiefly Oakley) after browlines returned to popularity. Unlike its tenure in the 1980s, monobrowlines proved to be a popular variant among eyeglass wearers in the 2010s. History =1940s ‚Äì 1960s= Browline glasses were invented in 1947 by Jack Rohrbach, then vice-president of Shuron Ltd., an eyeglass company.\\"Looking Back\\": an illustrated history of the American Ophthalmic Industry, by the Optical Laboratories Association The first browlines ‚Äì sold under the \\"Ronsir\\" model name ‚Äì were made out of interchangeable bridges, eyewires, and \\"brows,\\" allowing wearers to completely customize the size, fit, and color of their glasses. At the time, most frame manufacturers offered a limited number of colors and sizes, making browlines a unique means of customizing one's personal appearance. The style quickly caught on in popularity amongst eyeglass wearers, resulting in numerous other companies releasing their own browline frames. Most notably, Art-Craft Optical produced the \\"Art-Rim\\" brand, which offered designs for both men (under the \\"Clubman\\" models) and women (under the \\"Leading Lady\\" models), making the style unisex.Art Craft Optical: History Though numerous companies manufactured their own versions of browlines, through the 1960s, six manufacturers in particular dominated the browline market: Shuron, Art-Craft Optical, Victory Optical, American Optical, and Bausch and Lomb (which branded the model as the Ray-Ban Browline); each company differentiated their frames through unique plaques on the upper corners of the frames, which sometimes also served to cover the rivets attaching the temples to the frame. The style continued to rise in popularity throughout the 1950s, with different manufacturers modifying the original browline design in order to compete. Art-Craft and Victory Optical introduced aluminum browlines, which replaced the plastic brows with aluminum caps, drastically decreasing the frame's weight. Shuron began modifying the original browline shape, beginning with the rectangular \\"Rondon\\" model, to appeal to individuals of all face shapes. For a period in the 1950s, plastic brows designed to emulate wood grains became popular, with Victory Optical offering models that allowed wearers to switch off the caps to coordinate to different outfits. Ultimately, browline glasses accounted for half of all eyeglasses sold and worn in the 1950s.Shuron Ltd.: About UsShuron Ltd. / Shuron.com As a result, many famous figures from the mid-20th century are pictured wearing browlines, including black liberationist Malcolm X, Kentucky Fried Chicken founder Colonel Sanders, Lyndon B. Johnson (most notably in his national statement regarding the signing of the 1964 Civil Rights Act), Vince Lombardi, Josemar√≠a Escriv√°, Josip Broz Tito (President of Yugoslavia) and others. Browlines continued to remain popular through the 1960s, but their market influence slowly waned throughout the decade as advances in plastics manufacturing offered wearers even further frame customization via solid plastic eyeglasses, which could now be made in more shapes, sizes, and colors than in the past. Wearers who wished to wear plastic frames but still liked the browline style flocked to \\"plastic browlines,\\" plastic glasses with transparent lower portions and solid upper portions, which became a major frame style of the 1960s. =1970s ‚Äì 1990s= Ray-Ban 3016 Clubmaster sunglasses In 1971, Shuron sold their sixteen-millionth pair of Ronsirs. However, the general backlash against the culture and fashion of the 1950s and 1960s which had begun with the hippie subculture led to a rapid decline in the popularity of browlines, which had come to carry undesirable conformist connotations. The style remained unpopular through the end of 1978, except among conservatives and the elderly. Demand suddenly rose between 1978 and 1980, as the anti-disco backlash affected the until-then popular Aviators and Teashades, which became associated with the fashion of the time. The rise also boosted the Wayfarer model, which like the Ronsirs were about to be phased out in the early 1980s. About 12,000 pairs were sold in 1982. Five years earlier fewer than 5,000 were purchased. However, by 1987 figures amounted for over 500,000. In the mid-1980s, Bruce Willis wore a pair of Shuron Ronsirs with tinted lenses on the series Moonlighting, leading to a surge in demand for browline sunglasses. In response, Ray-Ban, which already dominated the sunglasses market with their Wayfarers and Aviator sunglasses, introduced the Clubmaster, a traditional browline frame with sunglass lenses, and the Wayfarer Max, a Wayfarer shaped-and-sized browline. The Clubmaster went on to become the third best selling sunglasses style of the 1980s, behind the Wayfarer and aviator. Bob Geldof can also be seen wearing a pair of browline sunglasses that look to be Clubmasters in the 1982 Pink Floyd movie The Wall. Browlines (and plastic glasses in general) were deeply affected by the backlash against the 1980s consumer culture, and carried a variety of stigmas during the 1990s, variously identifying the wearer as a nerd, geek, elderly, or a devotee of far-right politics; the 1993 film Falling Down in particular helped to cement an association between browlines and the \\"angry white male\\". =2000s onwards= During the 2000s, browlines were still seen as overtly conformist or \\"nerdy\\" and were still associated with 1950s culture and fashion. The influence of the television series Mad Men on the fashion world led to several eyeglass manufacturers offering browlines in order to meet demand for 1960s inspired frames. Major characters on several television series in the late 2000s and early 2010s were seen wearing browlines, including Mad Men, Heroes (on which the style worn by character Noah Bennet was erroneously identified as \\"horn rimmed glasses\\"), American Horror Story, and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. By 2013, of the major companies that produced browlines during the height of their popularity, only Shuron and Victory Optical still manufacture them. Shuron is the only company to have constantly produced browlines since their inception; Victory Optical shut down for a period in the 1980s-1990s before resuming manufacture in the 2000s. Art- Craft optical still features the Clubman model on their webpage, although the company no longer manufactures the frame, and now only sells remaining parts from the factory.

providing weather to and collecting reports from pilots while in flight. While U.S. Flight Service Stations (FSS) operate Flight Watch, Flight Watch does not provide a full range of FSS services such as filing flight plans, acquiring preflight weather briefings, providing NOTAMs, or picking up IFR clearances; instead, it is limited to the following: * en route weather updates * collection of pilot weather reports (PIREPs) The service was available on a single common frequency, 122.0 MHz, to flights operating below Flight Level 180 (18,000 feet MSL) across the conterminous United States. Discrete frequencies are available for high altitude aircraft (at and above 18,000 feet MSL, or FL180), based on location. Flight Watch may have been unavailable below 5,000 feet AGL, depending on terrain and the distance from the nearest station. On October 1, 2015, Flight Watch services were consolidated with existing Flight Service Station (FSS) services and the services were terminated on the 122.0 frequency.

His interests started primarily in analysis but moved into mathematical logic. Schechter is best known for his 1996 book Handbook of Analysis and its Foundations, which provides a novel approach to mathematical analysis and related topics at the graduate level.  Important works  Schechter has authored a number of articles in analysis, differential equations, mathematical logic, and set theory. He is best known for writing two textbooks covering advanced material but written at an introductory level: * (2005) Classical and Nonclassical Logics () (more information) * (1996) Handbook of Analysis and its Foundations () (more information) Handbook of Analysis and its Foundations was reviewed at length by the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics review, which wrote: :Every once in a while a book comes along that so effectively redefines an educational enterprise -- in this case, graduate mathematical training -- and so effectively reexamines the hegemony of ideas prevailing in a discipline -- in this case, mathematical analysis -- that it deserves our careful attention. This is such a book., S.I.A.M. Review, Volume 40, Number 2, pp. 421-426. Schechter also maintains two webpages that are frequently cited: * Common Errors in Undergraduate Mathematics * A Home Page for the Axiom of Choice Politics Schechter is involved in political activism of the democratic socialist variety.

The war was fought between factions of Sigismund III Vasa and Maximilian III, with Sigismund eventually being crowned King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania. Two major battles of this conflict included the Siege of Krak√≥w, in which Maximilian III failed to capture the capital of the Commonwealth, and the Battle of Byczyna, in which Maximilian was forced to surrender. Sigismund's victory was significantly the doing of Chancellor and Hetman Jan Zamoyski, who stood behind both the political intrigue and the military victories of this conflict. Background In 1586, following the death of the previous Polish king, Stefan Batory, the Swedish crown prince Sigismund III Vasa and Habsburg Maximilian III, Archduke of Austria, took part in the election to the joint Polish-Lithuanian throne. Each of the two candidates had supporters in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth with the two opposing sides gathered around pro-Sigismund Chancellor and Hetman Jan Zamoyski and the Primate of Poland, Stanis≈Çaw Karnkowski, on one side and the pro-Maximilian Zborowski family on the other. Bad blood between Zamoyski and the Zborowski family dated years past; tensions during the elections ran high. Sigismund, supported by Zamoyski and the former king's wife, Anna Jagiellon, was elected King of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth on 19 August 1587 and recognized as such by the interrex, the Primate Karnkowski. However, the election was disputed by the other candidate, Maximilian III of Austria, and opponents of Sigismund chose not to respect the election outcome, decreeing that Maximilian was the rightful monarch three days later, on 22 August. Zborowscy called for the rokosz (legitimate right to rebel) and the election ended in chaos, with several killed and many wounded. For both Zamoyski and Zborowski, losing was not an option, as they knew the losing side would likely pay a severe price, from confiscations and prestige loss to a possible death sentence for treason. Neither Sigismund nor Maximilian were present in the Commonwealth at that time. After receiving news of his election, both Sigismund and Maximilan made haste for Poland. Sigismund arrived at Gda≈Ñsk on the 28 September, and after approximately two weeks he had departed to Krak√≥w, where he arrived on 9 December and was crowned on 27 December. War Maximilian attempted to resolve the dispute by bringing a military force to Poland ‚Äì thereby starting the War of the Polish Succession. He took Lubowla, but after a failed attempt to storm Krak√≥w (the capital of Poland) in late 1587, successfully defended by Zamoyski, he retreated to gather more reinforcements, pursued by the forces loyal to Sigismund. While waiting for reinforcements, he was defeated at the Battle of Byczyna in January 1588, and forced to surrender. This marked the end of this conflict. Aftermath After the intervention of a papal envoy, Maximilian was released, but only after spending thirteen months as a \\"guest\\" of Zamoyski. In the Treaty of Bytom and Bƒôdzin (signed on 9 March 1589) Maximilian had to renounce the Polish crown and Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor had to pledge not to make any alliances against Poland with Muscovy or Sweden. The town of Lubowla, taken early in the conflict by Maximilian, was returned to Poland. Upon his return to Vienna he failed to honor his pledge and renounce his claim to the Polish crown (he would do so only in 1598). Nonetheless, there would be no serious military tensions between the Commonwealth and the Habsburgs, as each would quickly become concerned with other issues.

Usually, it has all the ingredients of kimchi, but the baechu (hangul: Î∞∞Ï∂î; Napa cabbage) used for kimchi is replaced with Korean radish (called mu, Î¨¥ in Korean). Kkakdugi is a popular banchan (side dish) enjoyed by Koreans and others. Origin and history The origin of kkakdugi is mentioned in a cookbook named Joseon yorihak (Ï°∞ÏÑ†ÏöîÎ¶¨Ìïô ÊúùÈÆÆÊñôÁêÜÂ≠∏, literally \\"Korean Gastronomy\\") written by Hong Seon-pyo (ÌôçÏÑ†Ìëú) in 1940. According to the book, kkakdugi was created by Princess Sukseon (ÏàôÏÑ†ÏòπÏ£º Ê∑ëÂñÑÁøÅ‰∏ª), a daughter of King Jeongjo (r. 1776-1800) and the wife of Hong Hyeon-ju (ÌôçÌòÑÏ£º Ê¥™ È°ØÂë®), a high- ranking government officer titled as Yeongmyeongwi (ÏòÅÎ™ÖÏúÑ Ê∞∏ÊòéÊÖ∞). When a matter for congratulation happened to the royal court, members of the royal family gathered to have a feast, and the princess presented a new dish made with diced radish to the king. He highly praised it and asked her about the dish's name. She replied that the dish did not have a name because she had accidentally made it, but found that it tasted good, so she brought in the new dish to the court. The king replied that the dish would be named kkakdugi because cutting food into cubes is called ggakduk sseolgi (ÍπçÎëëÏç∞Í∏∞) in Korean. At that time, kkakdugi was called gakdokgi (Í∞ÅÎèÖÍ∏∞ ÂàªÊØíÊ∞£) and then became spread over commoners. Preparation Kkakdugi consists of radish cut into small cubes. The radish is flavored with salt, red chili powder, spring onions, and ginger. The radish and the other ingredients are mixed together and then traditionally stored in a jangdok (hangul: Ïû•ÎèÖ) or onggi (hangul: ÏòπÍ∏∞, hanja: ÁîïÂô®), both names which refer to a large earthenware pot. Fermentation takes about two weeks in a cool, and dry place. Kkakdugi is served cold and is usually consumed when the radish is crisp. This is before the radish becomes soft. Kkakdugi, along with other types of kimchi, is a popular dish in Korea and is believed to share many of the health benefits of kimchi, due to the fermentation process. kkakdugi made of persimmon Varieties There are several main types of kkakdugi, which are all fairly similar in their ingredients and preparation: *Regular kkakdugi *Gul kkakdugi (Íµ¥ÍπçÎëêÍ∏∞) is a variety of kkakdugi that is flavored with whole raw oysters. It is made especially in winter around Korean New Year. Saeujeot (salted preserved shrimp) and water dropwort leaves, along with other spices, are used for making this. Because of the use of oysters, gul kkakdugi has a comparatively short shelf life compared to other types of kkakdugi. It is most often consumed in Jeju Island and Seoul. *Gegeolmu kkakdugi (Í≤åÍ±∏Î¨¥ÍπçÎëêÍ∏∞) is made with gegeolmu (gegeol radish), a local specialty of the Yeoju region. *Myeongtae seodeori kkakdugi (Î™ÖÌÉúÏÑúÎçîÎ¶¨ÍπçÎëêÍ∏∞) is made with the gills of Alaska pollock. Meongtae refers to the fish and seodeori means the offal of fish in Korean. *Suk kkakdugi (ÏàôÍπçÎëêÍ∏∞) is made with diced radish that has been boiled, so it is reputed to be more easily digestible and therefore good for old people. *Musongsongi (Î¨¥ÏÜ°ÏÜ°Ïù¥) is a form of kkakdugi once consumed in the royal court, whose name derives from the adverb, songsong (ÏÜ°ÏÜ°) because the radish used for it is chopped and diced small. Seolleongtang Korean soups such as seolleongtang (beef soup), galbitang (galbi, or beef rib soup), samgyetang (ginseng chicken soup) are considered \\"good friends\\" for kkakdugi. The taste of the kkakdugi overpowers the taste of stew itself and gets rid of the distinctive smell of the stew. Additionally, radish is very good for digestion. When eating meat in stew, kkakdugi is believed to aid in digestion.

Opened in 1967 as the Regency Hyatt House, John C. Portman, Jr.'s revolutionary 22-story atrium design for the hotel has influenced hotel design enormously in the years since. The hotel instantly became one of the most recognized buildings in Atlanta. The building consists of the main \\"Atrium Tower\\" and two extensions, completed in 1971 and 1982, respectively, containing a total of 1,260 rooms. On top of the Hyatt Regency is a revolving restaurant called Polaris, located just beneath the blue dome- shaped structure which gives the hotel its distinctive profile. This was Portman's first designed revolving restaurant of many. When the hotel first opened, the restaurant gave diners an ever-changing panoramic view of the entire city; however, as taller buildings were erected on all sides of the hotel, the restaurant's view became increasingly constricted. The Polaris closed in August 2004 and remained empty until renovation plans were approved in 2013. Polaris reopened in June 2014. In 1971, the Ivy Tower (now called Radius Tower) was constructed, which was also designed by John Portman. It closely resembles his Westin Peachtree Plaza, which opened five years later. So similar are the two buildings that in 1981, the Tower doubled for the Peachtree Plaza in the film Sharky's Machine starring Burt Reynolds. Stuntman Dar Robinson dropped () from the Tower, setting a record for the highest freefall (unrestrained) jump from a building in a film. In 1969, Jim Morrison, lead singer of The Doors, stayed at the Hyatt Regency Atlanta while attending the Atlanta Film Festival. At the awards ceremony, he gave his room key to the woman presenting him the plaque. In 1982, the International Tower was added, which is the same as the original design but has expanded rooms and suites.

The .450 Bushmaster is a rifle cartridge developed by Tim LeGendre of LeMag Firearms, and licensed to Bushmaster Firearms International. The .450 Bushmaster is designed to be used in the standard M16s and AR-15s, using modified magazines and upper receiver assemblies. History The .450 Bushmaster is descended from the \\"Thumper\\" concept popularized by gun writer Jeff Cooper. Cooper was dissatisfied with the small-diameter 5.56√ó45mm NATO (.223 Remington) of the AR-15, and envisioned a need for a large bore (.44 cal or greater) cartridge in a semi-automatic rifle to provide one-shot kills on big-game animals at 250 yards. Inspired by this, LeGendre developed his .45 Professional cartridge, and later built and delivered an AR-15 in .45 Professional to Cooper. Bushmaster requested the ammunition manufacturer Hornady to produce the .45 Professional cartridge for this project, but Hornady wanted to shorten the cartridge case and overall length to accommodate their 0.452\\" 250-grain pointed SST Flex-Tip bullet.

It is located west of Minsk, and has a population of 4,206 (2017). Ivyanets is best known as the birthplace of Felix Dzerzhinsky. History =Lithuanian-Polish rule= Ivyanets is located in a hilly forested area on the Volma River, and its origins can be traced to the end of the 15th century in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Originally known as Givenech, presumably derived from Lithuanian gyventi ‚Äì \\"to live\\", it was founded in 1444 as a privately owned settlement of the Sologub family, and by 1522 it was listed as a town within Minsk County of the Vilnius Voivodeship. Ivyanets was home to a primarily Protestant Calvinist community, and saw rapid growth with schools and a hospital. In 1606, a wooden church was built, and in 1640 the town was composed of 27 lots. During the Russo-Polish War (1654‚Äì1667), Ivyanets was severely damaged by Russian forces, and slowly recovered over the next century. At the beginning of the 18th century Ivyanets County was formed, with its administrative center located in the town, and in 1702 a Franciscan monastery was built by Theodore Vankovich. In 1745, Jan Michal Sologub built a stone church in the town. Sologub was the current Podskarby, the chief financial manager of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth and a member of the Senate, and the owner of the town. By 1780, Ivyanets was composed of 7 streets, a market, and 174 lots. =Russian rule= In 1793, as a result of the second partition of Poland, Ivyanets became part of the Russian Empire and the center of a Minsk County township. During the January Uprising (1863-1864) against Russian rule in the former Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, 189 men from the town fought as insurgents on the Polish side. Following the suppression of the uprising, Russian authorities began a Russification process in the region - a public school was opened in Ivyanets, and on November 28, 1869, forcibly altered the local Church of St. Michael and the Holy Trinity to the Moscow Patriarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church. By 1880, Ivyanets had 288 houses, 2 schools, 35 shops, 17 potteries, 2 inns, 2 churches and 2 synagogues, as well as weekly auctions and 2 fairs a year. According to the census of 1897, the number of households had increased to 399, with 2 churches and 2 chapels, a public school, 2 religious schools, 2 almshouses, an emergency room, a water mill, 15 workshops of baking pots, 9 store forges, 64, 2 restaurants, vodka storage, held 2 annual fairs and auctions on Sundays. At the beginning of the 20th century, Ivyanets featured numerous hospitals and clinics, and in 1915 years around the St. Euphrosyne of Polotsk Orthodox church was built next to the fairgrounds. =Byelorussian SSR and Polish rule= In February 1918, Ivyanets was occupied during the First World War by German troops as part of the invasion of Russia. On 25 March, 1918, Ivyanets was proclaimed part of the short-lived independent Belarusian People's Republic, but on 1 January, 1919, in accordance with the decision of the Congress of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Belarus, became a part of the Byelorussian SSR, but in August 1919, Ivyanets was occupied by the Polish Army. According to the Treaty of Riga (1921) the town was included in the inter-war Second Polish Republic, in 1923 becoming part of Wo≈Ço≈ºyn (Valozhyn) County in the Nowogr√≥dek Voivodeship, and was now from the Belarusian SSR border. In 1934, the electrification of Ivyanets began when individuals from the town founded a power plant on the Volma River, on the land of a former Sologub family property. In 1936, Ivyanets built a new school, and by 1938 the town had 574 buildings (including 10 stone) and a military airport. =Soviet rule= In September 1939, Ivyanets was occupied by the Red Army and, on 14 November 1939, incorporated into the Byelorussian SSR. Nazi German occupation and Jewish massacres From 25 June 1941 until 6 July 1944, Ivyanets was occupied by Nazi Germany and administered as a part of the Generalbezirk Wei√üruthenien of Reichskommissariat Ostland. In 1941, there were probably about 1,200 Jews residing in Ivyanets district. On September 5, 1941, 50 male Jews from the town were shot. In November 1941, the Germans established an enclosed Jewish ghetto in Ivyanets which also received Jews from the surrounding villages. In early 1942, some Jews were selected and sent to other ghettos established in Poland, such as one in Navahrudak, as the Germans liquidated the Ivyanets ghetto on June 9, 1942. That day, about 800 victims were shot in a pit in a forest outside of town.http://www.yahadmap.org/#village/ivenets-ivyanets-minsk-belarus.399 On June 19, the Polish Partisan Unit from the AK Sto≈Çpce District captured Iwieniec and destroyed the local German garrison. The city was free for a dozen or so hours. These events went down in history as the 'Iwieniec Uprising'.

Dramatising real events using a documentary style, Battle for Haditha is Broomfield's follow up to Ghosts. The film was aired on Channel 4 in the UK on 17 March 2008. Plot The film is inspired by the Haditha killings incident that occurred three months after the Battle of Haditha in the Iraq War. On 19 November 2005 in Haditha, a city in the western Iraqi province of Al Anbar, 24 unarmed Iraqi men, women, and children were killed by a group of United States Marines following an incident where an I.E.D killed one Marine and seriously wounded two others. Since the release of the film, the US military controversially dropped all charges to all Marines involved.MILITARY: Haditha Marine acquitted The names of the Marines have been changed in the film, while the Iraqi civilians retain their real names. Production Shot in Jerash, Jordan, the film uses former US Military personnel and Iraqi refugees to play many of the roles. However, the film was shot in an unconventional way ‚Äì it was shot sequentially enabling the cast to build their characters as the story progressed. It also used real locations, and a very small documentary style film crew. This greatly added to the feeling of reality. Actors, while working from a detailed script, and the final form of the film reflects that structure, were also able to improvise and add to the dialogue, making it their own. Cast The film features Elliot Ruiz as Cpl Ramirez, a Marine who loses his composure after watching a friend die, Andrew McLaren as Captain Sampson the tough company commander in Charge of Cpl Ramirez, Jase Willette as PFC Cuthbert, the young Marine whose death sets off the chain of events, Yasmine Hanani as Hiba, a young Iraqi woman stuck in the middle of the chaos, Eric Mehalacopoulos as the no-nonsense Sgt Ross, Nathan Delacruz a former United States Marine plays Cpl Marcus with his infamous comical one liners Falah Flayla as a former Iraqi Army officer turned insurgent, and Thomas Hennessy Jr. as a Navy corpsman assigned to Kilo company.

Personal life Percy Bassett was born in Danville, VA, in 1930, but his family moved to West Philadelphia when Bassett was 6 years old. Bassett went to Overbrook High School (Wilt Chamberlain later went there) but he dropped out once he began boxing. He had 16 amateur fights and won the prestigious Inquirer Diamond Belt championship in 1947. He turned pro later that year. Professional career Bassett made his professional debut at the age of 17, on July 31, 1947. The result in his first professional bout was a 3rd round knockout of opponent Joe Camarata. Bassett fought frequently, and had compiled a record of 25-0 before losing for the first time, an eight-round points loss to Brown Lee on December 23, 1948. Bassett avenged that loss just eight days later, with a ten-round decision. Bassett continued to fight often, and to win most of the time. Unfortunately for Bassett, he had no mob connections, and never got a title fight. He did get an interim belt while Sandy Saddler was in the army, but never had the privilege of fighting for the championship. Despite this, Bassett faced a number of the top small fighters of his era, including Mario Pacheco, Miguel Acevedo, Redtop Davis, Jimmy Carter, Frankie Sodano, Federico Plummer, Ray Famechon, Lulu Perez, and others. Bassett's retirement due to a detached retina came after his last fight, a tenth round TKO of undefeated (16-0) Seraphin Ferrer. Bassett's final record was 64 wins (41 by knockout), 12 losses, and 1 draw. Tragedy On December 20, 1950 Bassett fought Sonny Boy West, a well-regarded veteran lightweight from Baltimore with a professional record of 46-7-1. Between the sixth and seventh rounds West began to complain in his corner of double vision, but the fight was allowed to continue. According to boxrec.com, \\"After he was hurt to the body by Bassett, he was floored by a right hand. As he fell, he landed hard on his head. West died of injuries suffered in this bout on December 21st. The official cause of death was given as a 'inter-cerebral hemorrhage resulting from a cerebral concussion.'\\".

According to Chinese customs, Renri was the day human beings were created. It is celebrated not only in China, but also in the surrounding region influenced by Chinese culture. Origin In Chinese mythology, N√ºwa was the goddess who created the world. She created the animals on different days, and human beings on the seventh day after the creation of the world. Questions and Answers on Rites and Customs () by Dong Xun () of the Jin dynasty and the Book of Divination (), an earlier of publication by Dongfang Shuo in the Western Han dynasty, both specify the order of creation: : First of Zhengyue: Chickens : Second of Zhengyue: Dogs : Third of Zhengyue: Boars : Fourth of Zhengyue: Sheep : Fifth of Zhengyue: Cows : Sixth of Zhengyue: Horses : Seventh of Zhengyue: Mankind. Hence, Chinese tradition has set the first day of Zhengyue as the \\"birthday\\" of the chicken, the second day of Zhengyue as the \\"birthday\\" of the dog, etc. And the seventh day of Zhengyue is viewed as the common \\"birthday\\" of all human beings. Celebration =Chinese= According to legend, the custom dates back to the Han dynasty, and gained importance after the Three Kingdoms period and Jin dynasty. Ancient Chinese had a tradition of wearing head ornaments called rensheng (), which were made of ribbon or gold and represented humans. People also climbed mountains and composed poems. Emperors after the Tang dynasty granted ribbon rensheng to their subjects and held festivities with them. If there were good weather on Renri, it was considered that people will have a year of peace and prosperity. Fireworks and huapao (Ëä±ÁÇÆ) are lit, so Renri celebrates the \\"birthday\\" of fire as well. Since the first days of Zhengyue are considered \\"birthdays\\" of different animals, Chinese people avoid killing the animals on their respective birthdays and punishing prisoners on Renri. Nowadays during Zhengyue, Renri is celebrated as part of the Chinese New Year. Chinese people prepare lucky food in the new year, where the \\"seven vegetable soup\\" (‰∏ÉËèúÁæπ), \\"seven vegetable congee\\" (‰∏ÉËèúÁ≤•) and \\"jidi congee\\" (ÂèäÁ¨¨Á≤•) are specially prepared for Renri.

Commissioner, 119 T.C. 1 (2002), was a United States Tax Court decision which closed the door on a potential loophole with regard to annuities and capital gains tax. The case affirmed that annual lottery annuities cannot be assigned and sold as capital assets.Tax Watch: Couple takes their lumps after winning lottery - InvestmentNews Facts In 1991, James F. Davis won $13,580,000 in the California State Lottery's Super Lotto Plus game. As a result, Davis became entitled to receive $679,000 as yearly annuity, in 20 payments. (The game did not yet offer a lump sum option.) Normally, income derived from annuities are taxed as ordinary income. In 1997, in an apparent attempt to circumvent this tax treatment, Davis entered into an agreement with Singer Asset Finance Company, LLC (Singer). The agreement called for Davis to assign a portion of his right to these annual payments to Singer, in exchange for a single payment of $1,040,000. In his 1997 income tax return, Davis reported the assignment as a sale of capital asset held for more than one year with a cost basis of $7,009 (representing the cost of attorney's fees). Thus, Davis claimed a long term capital gain of $1,032,991. By claiming this sum as a capital gain and not ordinary income, this figure was entitled to preferential tax treatment.Lottery proceeds: ordinary or capital gains?  Banking & Finance > Financial Markets & Investing from AllBusiness.com The Commissioner of the IRS determined this amount to be ordinary income because rights to lottery annuity payments are not capital assets under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Issue Was the amount Davis received in exchange for his rights to receive a portion of future annual lottery payments ordinary income or capital gain? Holding The Tax Court held that the right to receive future annual lottery payments does not fit the definition a capital asset per Internal Revenue Code (I.R.C.) ¬ß 1221, and therefore the $1,040,000 that petitioners received from Singer was ordinary income, and not capital gain. Reasoning The court rejected Davis's argument that Arkansas Best Corp. v. Commissioner effectively overruled a line of cases which had previously precluded taxpayers from characterizing the right to receive future annual lottery payments as a capital asset within the meaning of section 1221.

Career =Data analysis= In 1984, Gray founded the company Gray Data in Chicago, which provided data analysis research services and published reference cards for microcomputer software. He continues to work as a data analyst through his company Gray Consulting.Amir Alexander, \\"One Man‚Äôs Quest for SETI's Most Promising Signal,\\" The Planetary Society, January 27, 2012. =Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI)= Gray is best known for his work as an independent SETI researcher. The Atlantic called Gray \\"the 'Wow!' signal's most devoted seeker and chronicler, having traveled to the very ends of the earth in search of it.\\" The Wow! signal was detected by the Ohio State University Radio Observatory (also known as Big Ear) on August 15, 1977. The signal was so pronounced in the data, and so similar to a radio signal rather than a natural source, that SETI scientist Jerry R. Ehman circled it on the computer printout in red ink and wrote \\"Wow!\\" next to it. After hearing about the Wow! signal a few years after its detection, Gray contacted the Ohio team, visited Big Ear, and spoke with Ehman, Robert S. Dixon (director of the SETI project) and John D. Kraus (the telescope's designer). In 1980, Gray began scanning the skies from his backyard in Chicago, using a 12-foot commercial telecommunications dish.Frederic Golden, \\"NASA scientists search heavens for 'E.T.',\\" Santa Cruz Sentinel, September 2, 1988, pp. E1, E3. He operated his small SETI radio observatory regularly beginning in 1983 and for the next 15 years, but did not find a trace of the Wow! signal. In 1987 and 1989 he led searches for the signal using the Harvard/Smithsonian META radio telescope at the Oak Ridge Observatory in Harvard, Massachusetts. In September 1995 and again in May 1996, Gray and Kevin B. Marvel reported searches for the signal using the Very Large Array (VLA) radio telescope in New Mexico (which is an array of 27 dishes simulating a single dish with a diameter of up to 22 miles), becoming the first amateur astronomer to use the VLA, and the first individual to use it to search for extraterrestrial signals. The VLA was, until the end of the twentieth century, the most powerful radio telescope ever built. In 1998, he and University of Tasmania professor Simon Ellingsen conducted searches using the 26-meter dish at the Mount Pleasant Radio Observatory in Hobart, Tasmania. Gray and Ellingsen made six 14-hour observations where the Big Ear was pointing when it found the Wow! signal, searching for intermittent and possibly periodic signals, rather than a constant signal. No signals resembling the Wow! were detected. =Writing= Gray and Marvel published a 2001 paper in The Astrophysical Journal detailing his use of the VLA in search of the signal. Gray and Ellingsen published \\"A Search for Periodic Emissions at the Wow Locale\\" in the October 2002 issue of The Astrophysical Journal, reporting on searches for the Wow! signal. In 2011, Gray published the book The Elusive Wow: Searching for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, summarizing what is known about the Wow! signal, covering his own search for the signal, and offering an overview of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. In 2016, Gray published an article in Scientific American about the Fermi paradox, which claims that if extraterrestrials existed, we would see signs of them on Earth, because they would certainly colonize the galaxy by interstellar travel. Gray argues that the Fermi paradox, named after Nobel Prize-winning physicist Enrico Fermi, does not accurately represent Fermi's views. Gray states that Fermi questioned the feasibility of interstellar travel, but did not say definitively whether or not he thought extraterrestrials exist.Robert H.

Like BCL2, BCL3, BCL5, BCL7A, BCL9 and BCL10, it has clinical significance in lymphoma.  Function  The protein encoded by this gene is an evolutionarily conserved zinc finger transcription factor and contains an N-terminal POZ/BTB domain. This protein acts as a sequence-specific repressor of transcription and has been shown to modulate the STAT-dependent Interleukin 4 (IL-4) responses of B cells. This protein can interact with several corepressor complexes to inhibit transcription. This gene is found to be frequently translocated and hypermutated in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and contributes to the pathogenesis of DLBCL. An exon 7 skipping splice variant encodes a shorter form of the protein which lacks the first two zinc fingers of the DNA binding domain. Physiologically, BCL6 is a master transcription factor which leads the differentiation of naive helper T cells in Follicular Helper T cells (TFH cells). Its action is negatively regulated by the gene PRDM1 encoding the transcription factor Blimp-1. Diagnostic utility The presence of BCL6 can be demonstrated in tissue sections using immunohistochemistry. It is exclusively present in the B-cells of both healthy and neoplastic germinal centres. It therefore demonstrates both reactive hyperplasia in lymph nodes and a range of lymphomas derived from follicular B-cells, such as Burkitt's lymphoma, follicular lymphoma and the nodular lymphocyte predominant subtype of Hodgkin's disease. It is often used together with antibodies to Bcl-2 antigen to distinguish neoplastic follicles from those found in benign hyperplasia, for which Bcl-2 is negative.

Rubin is an American computer programmer, engineer, entrepreneur, and venture capitalist. He is the founder and former CEO of venture capital firm Playground Global, as well as the co-founder and former CEO of both Danger Inc. and Android Inc. He was nicknamed \\"Android\\" by his co-workers at Apple in 1989 due to a love of robots, with the nickname eventually becoming the official name of the Android operating system. As the creator of the Android operating system, he's also known as the \\"Father of Android\\". Early life and education Rubin grew up in Chappaqua, New York as the son of a psychologist who later founded his own direct-marketing firm. His father's firm created photographs of the latest electronic gadgets to be sent with credit card bills. He attended Horace Greeley High School in Chappaqua, New York from 1977 until 1981 and was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree in computer science from Utica College, Utica, New York in 1986.  Career  Andy Rubin worked at Apple from 1989 to 1992 as a manufacturing engineer. =Google= After Android was acquired by Google in 2005, Rubin became the company's senior vice president of mobile and digital content, where he oversaw development of Android, an open-source operating system for smartphones. On March 13, 2013, Larry Page announced in a blog post that Rubin had moved from the Android division to take on new projects at Google, with Sundar Pichai taking over Android. In December 2013, Rubin started management of the robotics division of Google (which includes companies bought by Google, such as Boston Dynamics). On October 31, 2014, he left Google after nine years at the company to start a venture capital firm for technology startups. =Sexual harassment allegations= According to The New York Times, while the departure was presented to the media as an amicable one where Rubin would spend more time on philanthropy and start-ups, CEO Larry Page personally asked for Rubin's resignation after a sexual harassment claim by an employee against Rubin was found to be credible during an investigation by Google; the employee, with whom Rubin had an extramarital relationship, accused him of coercing her into oral sex in a hotel room in 2013. Rubin strongly disputed these reports and denied wrongdoing, stating, \\"these false allegations are part of a smear campaign to disparage me during a divorce and custody battle\\". The incident, among others, led to the 2018 Google walkouts from Google's employee workforce over Rubin reportedly receiving a $90 million \\"exit package\\" to expedite his separation from the company. Google responded by sending a memo to employees saying no employees dismissed due to sexual harassment concerns after 2016 had received payouts. =After Google= Rubin founded Playground Global in 2015 along with Peter Barrett, Matt Hershenson and Bruce Leak. The company is a venture capital firm and studio for technology start-ups, providing funding, resources, and mentorship. In 2015, Playground Global raised a $300 million fund from investors including Google, HP, Foxconn, Redpoint Ventures, Seagate Technology and Tencent, among others. It has invested in several companies such as Owl Labs. Rubin left Playground Global in May of 2019. Rubin eventually joined and helped create the Android phone start-up Essential Products. In November 2017, he took a leave of absence from Essential Products after reports of the inappropriate relationship from his time at Google surfaced. In December 2017, he returned to Essential Products. Rubin and his ex-wife, Rie Hirabaru Rubin, owned and operated Voyageur du Temps, a bakery and cafe in Los Altos, California, which closed in September 2018. =Timeline= * Carl Zeiss AG, robotics engineer, 1986-1989. * Apple Inc., manufacturing engineer, 1989-1992. * General Magic, engineer, 1992-1995\\\\.

IL4R is its human gene.  Function  This gene encodes the alpha chain of the interleukin-4 receptor, a type I transmembrane protein that can bind interleukin 4 and interleukin 13 to regulate IgE antibody production in B cells. Among T cells, the encoded protein also can bind interleukin 4 to promote differentiation of Th2 cells. A soluble form of the encoded protein can be produced by an alternate splice variant or by proteolysis of the membrane-bound protein, and this soluble form can inhibit IL4-mediated cell proliferation and IL5 upregulation by T-cells. Allelic variations in this gene have been associated with atopy, a condition that can manifest itself as allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, asthma, or eczema. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms, a membrane-bound and a soluble form, have been found for this gene. Interactions of IL-4 with TNFŒ± promote structural changes to vascular endothelial cells, thus playing an important role in tissue inflammation. The binding of IL-4 or IL-13 to the IL-4 receptor on the surface of macrophages results in the alternative activation of those macrophages. Alternatively activated macrophages (AAMŒ¶) downregulate inflammatory mediators such as IFNŒ≥ during immune responses, particularly with regards to helminth infections.  Interactions  Interleukin-4 receptor has been shown to interact with SHC1.  Structure  The N-terminal (extracellular) portion of interleukin-4 receptor is related in overall topology to fibronectin type III modules and folds into a sandwich comprising seven antiparallel beta sheets arranged in a three-strand and a four-strand beta-pleated sheet. They are required for binding of interleukin-4 to the receptor alpha chain, which is a crucial event for the generation of a Th2-dominated early immune response.

Importin alpha binds the NLS-containing cargo in the cytoplasm and importin beta docks the complex at the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear pore complex.

Sir Charles James Freake, 1st Baronet (7 April 1814 - 6 October 1884) was an untrained English architect and builder, responsible for many famous 19th- century fa√ßades in London, including Eaton Square, Exhibition Road and Onslow Square, mainly specialising in domestic architecture for wealthy clients.https://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol45/pp191-205 From humble beginnings and apprenticeship as a carpenter, he became a master builder, patron of the arts ‚Äî especially music ‚Äî and a philanthropist. Career Freake's father, Charles Freake, was originally a coal merchant. In the 1820s, he took a lease of the Royal Oak public house in Elizabeth Street, Belgravia (a mainstay of the blossoming Grosvenor Estate), Westminster. Being a publican apparently became his main business but he speculated in building projects. In 1837, he granted his son (who was described as a carpenter) a sub-lease of a small mews house by the Royal Oak. In 1838, Charles James Freake (now described as a builder) acquired some house plots in Elizabeth Street. Over a five-year period he built forty houses in South Eaton Place and Chester Row, and on the south side of Eaton Square. The Grosvenor Estate's London surveyor from 1828 to 1845 was George Basevi. In 1843, Basevi and Freake were involved in a joint project in Chelsea. Basevi had designed St. Jude‚Äôs Church and Freake had been appointed to build it. So, when a new tract of land became available for development in 1843 when the lease of Thomas Gibbs‚Äô nursery expired, Basevi used his influence to obtain the contract for Freake. The trustees signed a building agreement with Freake in April 1844. Over the next decades, the trustees entered into new-building (development) agreements with Freake in 1849, 1850, 1855, 1861, 1862 and 1883. The land he took on included nearly all the Estate west of Pelham Crescent, amounting to . As \\"building leases\\" all were granted direct to Freake, rather than to backers or speculators. Freake lived on the Estate for most of the years of its development. In 1860, he moved to Cromwell House, 21 Cromwell Road, which continued to be his London home for the rest of his life. The Prince of Wales and the Duke of Edinburgh were guests there, where he put on lavish musical and theatrical events. Freake built the National Training School for Music at his own expense in 1874‚Äì5, becoming the Royal College of Organists, now a private house, opposite the Royal Albert Hall. This charitable act earned him a baronetcy (the title of Sir which can be passed down the male line) in 1882, with formal (seldom used) territorial designation: of Cromwell House and of Fulwell Park and which died out in 1951. He famously only allowed straight chimneys in his buildings after his solicitor William Pulteney Scott Charles James Freake and Onslow Square and Gardens, British History, English Heritage, UK. told him about soot wart ‚Äî a form of cancer of the scrotum prevalent in child sweeps. Straight chimneys allowed brushes to be used for the entire chimney and would have saved many Victorian working class children from a painful and premature death. He died in 1884 and is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London. Even after his benefactions he was a shrewd businessman who at death had sworn (the next year) assets of ¬£718574 12s 1d ().UK Government Calendar of Probates sworn. Personal life He married twice; his first wife died in childbirth, and he had three daughters by his second wife. His second wife, Eliza Pudsey, died 26 November 1900 at 11 Cranley Gardens, South Kensington In 1885 and 1900 probate calendars confirm she lived also in one of the couple's additional homes, Fulwell Park in Twickenham.

It connects North London, from Camden Road near its junction with Holloway Road, and central London's Pentonville Road in the south. It is known colloquially as the \\"Cally\\" and forms the entirety of the A5203. Character The road is mostly residential from Camden Road until it reaches Caledonian Road Underground station. Residential developments have been constructed around the station including student accommodation. South of the station near the bridge carrying the North London Line is Pentonville Prison. South of the prison the road is lined with shops and cafes including several Ethiopian restaurants. The area is poor compared to the north end and the shops serve the council estates bordering the road and the more affluent Barnsbury area of mostly Georgian terraces to the east. The road crosses the Regents Canal at Thornhill Bridge and to the south are trendy shops and restaurants that have opened as a result of the King's Cross Central developments. The road ends at Pentonville Road near King's Cross railway station and the border with Camden. Housmans Bookshop, specialist radical book and magazine retailers established in 1945, is at No.5, as are the offices of Peace News and London Greenpeace, the people behind the McLibel Trial. In August 2013, the railway bridge over the road was repainted to remove the word \\"Ferodo\\" (one of many such bridges advertising the company name) and replaced it with the street's informal name, \\"The Cally\\". As of September 2016, Phil Coy's \\"your right to continued existence [cally colour chart\\"] was installed under \\"The Cally\\" bridge. The work illuminates the underside of the bridge with one colour at a time, with each colours name is simultaneously displayed on a dot matrix screen.The pallet of 191 colour names were developed in consultation with local community groups with reference to the Caledonian Roads history. The road was the subject of an hour-long episode in the 2012 BBC and Open University co- production, The Secret History of Our Streets, which chose the Caledonian Road as a typical London example. The road is mentioned in the song \\"Up The Bracket\\" by The Libertines. History The Metropolitan Cattle Market as seen in 1855 The road was constructed in pursuance of an act of Parliament, 6 Geo. IV 156 (1825), obtained by the Battle Bridge and Holloway Road Company. The company built the Caledonian Road in 1826 as a toll road to link the New Road with Holloway Road (which is part of the Great North Road) and provide a new link to the West End from the north. Originally known as Chalk Road, its name was but changed after the Royal Caledonian Asylum for the children of poor exiled Scots, was built here in 1828. The building has since been demolished and its site is occupied by local authority housing, the Caledonian Estate built 1900-7. The first residential buildings on the road were Thornhill Terrace (numbers 106-146) built in 1832, and other terraces were built in the 1840s. From around 1837 to 1849, cottages in gardens were built between Brewery Road and the site of the railway which were part of the failed Experimental Gardens or French Colony founded by a philanthropist, Peter Baume. Due to poor lighting and roads, the cottages declined into slums. Pentonville Prison was built in 1842 immediately to the south of the asylum. Cattle drovers passed along the road on their way to Smithfield until 1852 when the City of London Corporation transferred the Metropolitan Cattle Market to the Caledonian Market. In the mid 20th century, many communities were attracted to Caledonian Road by its relatively low property prices. An Irish community grew there; and in 1955, a cache of weapons belonging to the Irish Republican Army was discovered in the cellar of No. 257 Caledonian Road.  Buildings  Caledonian Road Methodist Church The road has a number of architecturally important or interesting buildings. Its listed buildings, include an Italianate Methodist Chapel built in 1870; the Caledonian Estate, an early Edwardian flatted estate; Pentonville Prison; and the Flying Scotsman, a 1901 public house and offices. Caledonian Road Underground station is also Grade II listed. University College London's controversial New Hall building attracted negative responses from some architectural critics on its completion for its purported failure to accommodate its Victorian facade with the building behind. It was awarded the 2013 Carbuncle Cup for the ugliest building in the United Kingdom. The road passes Islington Council social housing estates such as Tiber Gardens.

On 19 September 1919, during the Irish War of Independence, he suggested that the police force in Ireland be expanded via the recruitment of a special force of volunteer British ex-servicemen. Following direct intervention from London, the \\"Black and Tans\\" and Auxiliary Division of the Constabulary were introduced in order to achieve a decisive result. This intervention preceded a purge of the Irish administration at Dublin Castle during which Shaw himself was replaced. Shaw retired in 1920 and died on 6 January 1942.

He played as a centre forward for West Ham United from 1961 to 1966 before injury ended his career whilst playing for Blackburn Rovers. Career =West Ham United= Spotted playing youth team football, for Essex and London schoolboys, by West Ham chief scout, Wally St Pier, Britt signed for West Ham in 1961. He won three England youth team caps and played in both legs of the 1963 Youth Cup final against Liverpool. Britt made his full debut for West Ham in May 1963 against Blackburn Rovers. Finding opportunities limited behind strikers Johnny Byrne and Geoff Hurst he still managed four goals from eleven appearances in season 1963‚Äì64. Serious injury then struck when during a training session he suffered what was thought to be cruciate ligament damage but later proved to be a chipped bone in the knee joint. Failing to make a single appearance the following season he did score three goals from 14 appearances the next season; mostly aided by using his left leg and avoiding jumping using his damaged right leg. =Blackburn Rovers= Finding his selection chances still limited Britt fell out with manager Ron Greenwood and, despite still carrying a bad injury to his right knee, he transferred to Blackburn Rovers in 1967 for ¬£25,000. He made just eight appearance for Blackburn BLACKBURN ROVERS : 1946/47 - 2008/09 before an exploratory operation discovered a broken knee and resulted in a piece of bone being removed from his knee. He would not play another game and retired from injury aged only 21. Understandably annoyed Blackburn felt they had been ripped-off and that Britt's injury had not been fully revealed to them before his transfer. After a disagreement between the two clubs Blackburn gained some of Britt's transfer fee back. Unable to play he remained at Blackburn for eighteen months in a coaching capacity. Leaving football he later started his own successful textile business.

The law of primacy in persuasion, otherwise known as a primacy effect, as postulated by Frederick Hansen Lund in 1925 holds that the side of an issue presented first will have greater effectiveness in persuasion than the side presented subsequently. Lund presented college students with a document in support of one side of a controversial issue and then presented a second document which supported the opposite position. He found the document read first had greater influence, regardless of which position it expressed. This empirical evidence was generally accepted until 1950, when Cromwell published findings of the opposite: a recency effect in which arguments presented later had greater effectiveness in persuasion than arguments presented first. It now appears that both primacy and recency effects occur in persuasion. Theoretical background There are many different theoretical models proposed to explain the occurrence of primacy and recency effects. = Sensory-variation= Schultz (1963) developed the \\"sensory-variation\\" hypothesis for order effects, which suggests that humans seek high activation and will respond to novel stimuli more strongly than to stimuli they are familiar with. Novel stimuli should provide higher activation than familiar information, according to this theory. Shultz developed four postulates from this general hypothesis: # When a person encounters a topic for the first time, the communication is perceived as novel and causes high activation. Any subsequent communication on the same topic produces less activation, and so the person will react according to the initial communication in an attempt to experience the higher activation. A primacy effect should be observed in this scenario. # If the person is allowed to record his opinion after each communication, the person will respond more to the communication that he encounters either second in a group of two or last in a group of three or more in order to maintain a high level of activation. Therefore, a recency effect is hypothesized. # When a time delay or another task is inserted between the two communications, the higher level of activation will be dissipated by the time the second communication occurs. The second communication acts as a novel stimulus in this scenario. Either a recency effect or no order effect will occur in this scenario. # When communications are familiar, such as social issues or current issues, the first communication will not produce activation that is less than the activation for unfamiliar communication. However, some aspect of the communication may be novel, and so there may be some increased activation. Therefore, either a small primacy effect or no order effect will be demonstrated. =Attention decrement= Anderson (1981) theorized that order effects occur due to \\"attention decrement\\". According to this theory, when the first piece of information is presented about an opinion, people tend to pay less attention to subsequent information that may provide evidence to the contrary opinion. Therefore, people's opinions about something are influenced strongly by the information that they paid attention to, which was the first information presented to them. This model of \\"attention decrement\\" predicts a primacy effect in opinion formation. =The belief-adjustment model= Hogarth and Einhorn (1992) proposed the belief-adjustment model to try to predict in which situations order effects would occur and what specific order effect will occur. According to Hogarth and Einhorn, early information forms an initial impression, which is called an anchor. This anchor is then adjusted as new information is processed. This model predicts order effects based on the type of mental processing that is used for the new information. For end-of-sequence processing, or processing that occurs once all of the information has been presented, the model predicts primacy effects. The initial piece of information serves as the anchor, and subsequent pieces of information are aggregated together to adjust the initial piece of information. Therefore, the initial piece of information is weighted more than subsequent pieces of information, leading to a primacy effect. However, when processing changes to step-by-step processing, or processing that occurs after each new piece of information, recency effects are predicted. Each new piece of information received will be processed separately. This new piece of information will then become the new anchor, which forms a new impression. Beliefs are being adjusted with the processing of each new anchor, which leads to more weight being placed to the information most recently received. Therefore, recency effects are predicted to occur when information is processed in a step-by-step manner. Factors that moderate order effects There are factors that can moderate the occurrence of order effects. Moderating factors affect the likelihood of order effects occurring. =Need for cognition= Need for cognition moderates the occurrence of order effects. Kassin, Reddy, and Tulloch (1990) demonstrated that a juror's need for cognition affects which order effect the juror relies on for their vote. An ambiguous confession was played by one side of the case, and then both sides commented that the confession fit into their narrative of the crime. The side who presented the confession spoke first. Jurors who had high need for cognition were more likely to exhibit a primacy effect, meaning that they believed the confession fit with whichever side presented the confession as evidence. Conversely, jurors who had low need for cognition demonstrated a recency effect, and believed that the confession supported the case for the side who did not submit the confession. Kassin, Reddy, and Tulloch (1990) believed that the reason for this effect was due to the nature of processing that the jurors engaged in. Jurors who were high in need for cognition actively process the information. This active processing leads to agreeing with the initial presentation of the data, and then participating in processing that confirms this agreement. However, people low in need for cognition do not process information, and therefore, rely on the information presented most recently for their opinion. This impact of need for cognition is supported by a study conducted by Huagtvedt and Petty (1992). The experimenters played a message for two groups of people, one group that was high in need for cognition and one group that was low in need for cognition. The two groups were determined by their own need for cognition, and were not experimentally manipulated into the two groups. Initially, both groups were equally persuaded by the message. However, the two groups then listened to a weak counter-message, which was not as strong as the evidence for the initial message. The group that had high need for cognition were not persuaded by the weak counter-message, and their opinions were still in line with the initial message. The other group, the low need for cognition group, was persuaded by the new message. The high need for cognition demonstrated a primacy effect, while the low need for cognition demonstrated a recency effect. =Chunking= Chunking interacts with the order of information and need for cognition to moderate the occurrence of order effects. Petty, Tormala, Hawkins, and Wegener (2001) conducted a study which examined the effect chunking has on order effects in people with high and low need for cognition. Participants read arguments for and against an exam policy, and this information was presented as being either chunked or unchunked. When the information was chunked, those who show high need for cognition were prone to primacy effects, while those with low need for cognition were prone to recency effects. However, when the information was presented in an unchunked nature, the opposite results were found. People who had high need for cognition demonstrated recency effects, whereas people who had low need for cognition showed a primacy effect. Therefore, chunking appears to interact with need for cognition to allow for order effects to occur. =Familiarity of information= A study conducted by Lana (1961) demonstrates a moderating effect of the familiarity of information presented on order effects. In the study, a topic of initial low familiarity was used. Then, the researchers presented a long talk to well familiarize one group with the topic and a short talk to another group to gain little familiarization with the topic. A third group was then presented with no familiarization talk. Each of these three groups was then split into two subgroups, which listened to arguments for and against the topic twelve days later. One subgroup would listen to the argument for the topic first and then the argument against the topic, and the second subgroup would listen to the argument against it first. These groups then filled out a Likert scale questionnaire on their opinions on the topic. The results show that prior familiarization with a topic increased the likelihood of a primacy effect. Therefore, those in the long familiarization group had an opinion on the topic that coincided with which argument they heard first, regardless of the actual stance. However, no prior familiarization led to a recency effect to be demonstrated. Therefore, the group that was given no familiarization talk demonstrated opinions that coincided with the argument presented last to them. =Controversy of the topic= A study conducted by Lana (1963) demonstrates that the controversiality of the topic can have a moderating effect on order effects. College students and high school students read arguments for and against a controversial topic and a noncontroversial topic, and were then asked to fill out an opinion questionnaire about the topics. For college students, the controversial topic exhibited a primacy effect. College students did not exhibit any order effects for a noncontroversial topic. The college students were persuaded more by the argument they encountered first for a controversial issue, but were not influenced by the order of the presentation of arguments for noncontroversial topics. However, for high school students, no order effects were exhibited for either the controversial or noncontroversial topics. Therefore, the controversy of a topic appears to affect the role order effects play for some age groups in persuasion. Order effects in jury trials Order effects in judgment formation =Sports= Smith, Greenlees, and Manley (2009) found that order effects can occur in assessment of sports ability. The researchers had participants watch a video composed of an ultimate Frisbee player performing certain skills. Two videos were shown, either in descending ability or increasing ability. The participants were then asked to make assessments of the overall ability of the players and three aspects of their ability. However, the assessments occurred at differing times in the video. One group made the assessments at the end of the video, one group made delayed assessments at the end of the video, a third group made the assessments after each skill in the video, and a fourth group that made the overall assessment after each skill but then made the assessment of the ability after viewing the entire video. Results indicate that a primacy effect was exhibited in each of the conditions, except for the third group, which did not demonstrate any order effects. The assessment of ability tended to agree with the initial ability level shown. However, the group that made assessments in an extended step-by-step manner were not influenced by the order the abilities were shown. Therefore, a primacy effect can occur in ability assessment, unless extended step-by-step processing is employed. =Service encounters= In a study conducted by Garnefeld and Steinhoff (2013), order effects were demonstrated for opinions regarding service encounters. Four groups received daily descriptions of a hypothetical hotel stay over the course of five days. One group had a very positive experience on the first day, and then a neutral to slightly positive experience for the rest of the days. The second group had a negative experience on the first day, and then a neutral to slightly positive experience for the rest of the stay. Groups three and four experienced a neutral experience for the first four days, with group three then having a positive experience on the last day and group four having a negative experience on the last day. Each group was then tested for customer satisfaction regarding their hypothetical stay. Garnefeld and Steinhoff found that the timing of positive or negative occurrences is what affected satisfaction. For negative events, a recency effect was demonstrated, meaning that negative events which occurred at the end of the stay affected customer satisfaction more than negative events at the beginning of the stay. For positive events, a primacy effect was demonstrated, which means that positive events that occurred at the beginning of the stay affected customer satisfaction more than positive events at the end of the stay. Therefore, the timing of particular types of events in extended service encounters predicts the effect of the event on satisfaction. Order effects in health care Order effects may be used to influence a patient to receive an effective treatment that aligns with their values. One study, conducted by Bansback, Li, Lynd, and Bryan (2014), demonstrates that a primacy effect will influence the decision for treatment. The researchers presented three groups with information about sleep apnea treatments. The three groups were based on the order in which the information was presented. One group received information in an order unrelated to their values, while two groups received information ordered based on their values. One of the groups received information that aligned with their values first, and the other group received information that aligned with their values last. The researchers found that patients were more likely to choose the treatment that aligned with their values when this information was presented first, thus demonstrating a primacy effect for information on treatments that align with a patient's values. The order in which patients receive information appears to influence which treatment option they choose. Order effects in politics =Voter mobilization= In a study conducted by Panagopoulos (2010), order effects were found in terms of voter mobilization. Calls were made to residents of an American city at different times before an election. Some residents received a call 4 weeks prior to an election, some received a call two weeks prior to an election, some received a call three days before an election, and some residents did not receive a call. The call made was a nonpartisan attempt to mobilize people to vote. Results indicate that the timing of the call may not have an effect on the general voter population, but that the timing can affect certain populations and get certain populations to vote at higher rates. According to Panagopoulos, high- propensity voters, voters who typically turn out in higher numbers, voted at higher percentages when they received the call four weeks prior to the election, demonstrating a primacy effect. However, for lower propensity voters, voters who typically do not vote, calls made three days prior to the election were more effective at getting this population to vote, demonstrating a recency effect. Therefore, for voter mobilization, propensity to vote appears to be a moderating variable influencing the effect of timing of a mobilization call.

Function  The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the SWI/SNF family of proteins and is similar to the brahma protein of Drosophila. Members of this family have helicase and ATPase activities and are thought to regulate transcription of certain genes by altering the chromatin structure around those genes. The encoded protein is part of the large ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex SWI/SNF, which is required for transcriptional activation of genes normally repressed by chromatin. In addition, this protein can bind BRCA1, as well as regulate the expression of the tumorigenic protein CD44. BRG1 works to activate or repress transcription. Having functional BRG1 is important for development past the pre-implantation stage. Without having a functional BRG1, exhibited with knockout research, the embryo will not hatch out of the zona pellucida, which will inhibit implantation from occurring on the endometrium (uterine wall). BRG1 is also crucial to the development of sperm. During the first stages of meiosis in spermatogenesis there are high levels of BRG1. When BRG1 is genetically damaged, meiosis is stopped in prophase 1, hindering the development of sperm and would result in infertility. More knockout research has concluded BRG1‚Äôs aid in the development of smooth muscle. In a BRG1 knockout, smooth muscle in the gastrointestinal tract lacks contractility, and intestines are incomplete in some cases. Another defect occurring in knocking out BRG1 in smooth muscle development is heart complications such as an open ductus arteriosus after birth.  Clinical significance  BRG1 (or SMARCA4) is the most frequently mutated chromatin remodeling ATPase in cancer. Mutations in this gene were first recognized in human cancer cell lines derived from adrenal gland and lung. Later it was recognized that mutations exist in a significant frequency of medulloblastoma and pancreatic cancers, and in many other tumor subtypes. In cancer, mutations in BRG1 show an unusually high preference for missense mutations that are frequently heterozygous and target the ATPase domain. Mutations are enriched at highly conserved ATPase sequences, which lie on important functional surfaces such as the ATP pocket or DNA-binding surface. These mutations act in a genetically dominant manner to alter chromatin regulatory function at enhancers and promoters. Mutations of BRG1 are associated with context-dependent expression changes at MYC-genes, which indicates that the BRG1 and MYC proteins are functionally related. Another study demonstrated a causal role of BRG1 in the control of retinoic acid and glucocorticoid-induced cell differentiation in lung cancer and in other tumor types. This enables the cancer cell to sustain undifferentiated gene expression programs that affect the control of key cellular processes. Furthermore, it explains why lung cancer and other solid tumors are completely refractory to treatments based on these compounds that are effective therapies for some types of leukemia. The role of BRG1 in sensitivity or resistance to anti-cancer drugs had been recently highlighted by the elucidation of the mechanisms of action of darinaparsin, an arsenic-based anti-cancer drugs.

The new Articles 105a, 105b and 105c EPC (of the EPC 2000) form the legal basis of the limitation and revocation procedures. These procedures are applicable since 13 December 2007 to all European patents, whether already granted or granted after that date.OJ 2007, Special edition 4/2007, page 118, item 14.  Rationale  Until a decision of the Enlarged Board of Appeal of the EPO of 1994, namely G 9/93 (reverting earlier decision of the same instance of 1985, namely G 1/84), it was possible for the proprietor of a European patent to oppose its own patent with the aim of centrally limiting it. Decision G 9/93 however deprived patent proprietors of this opportunity. CA/PL 29/99, item I.1. This means that, after G 9/93, the only possibility for the proprietor of a European patent to voluntarily limit the scope conferred by its patent (e.g. for instance to strengthen the patent in view of some newly discovered prior art documents and/or in advance of envisaged litigation) was to request such limitation at the national level, i.e. before the national patent offices or competent courts of the Contracting States, if permitted.CA/PL 29/99, item II.7: \\"Failing opposition proceedings before the EPO ..., patent proprietors have to rely on national limitation procedures or, where these do not exist, on partial surrender or non-enforcing agreements. Often the only remaining option is \\"self-limitation\\" in national revocation proceedings. This is not only administratively time-consuming and expensive, but also means that European patents granted in accordance with a unitary procedure can be valid in different versions in different contracting states, which makes their legal enforcement on the one hand and the monitoring of protective rights on the other considerably more difficult.\\" The EPC of 1973 made no provision for a limitation procedure, and a fortiori no provision for centrally limiting a European patent before the EPO after the nine-month period for filing an opposition (nine months as from the date of grant of the European patent). The travaux pr√©paratoires laid out the rationale for a limitation procedure: :\\"Limitation proceedings would enable patentees to narrow down the protection conferred by a patent post-grant by means of a simple, quick and inexpensive administrative procedure. For example, it may be necessary to limit a granted patent if, because of prior art which was not known during the examination proceedings or prior national rights not taken into account in these proceedings, the extent of the protection conferred is too great. Using the limitation procedure, patent proprietors may themselves reduce the extent of the protection claimed in a manner which is binding, and thus generally preclude disputes over the validity of a patent. Postgrant limitation is also in the public interest, because it limits the protection claimed by the patentee with effect for the general public. This creates legal certainty and facilitates access by competitors to the freely available prior art.\\" CA/PL 29/99, item II.5.  Request  A request for limitation or revocation can only be filed by the proprietor(s) of the patent. The request may be filed at any time throughout the entire term of the European patent.EPO web site, CA/PL PV 14, Minutes of the 14th meeting of the Committee on Patent Law (Munich, 3 to 6 July 2000), item 167: \\"There [is] deliberately no time limit on the limitation procedure. It should be applicable at any time during the entire term of the patent to ensure that all parties concerned were on a level playing field.\\"EPO web site, Frequently asked questions about the revised European Patent Convention (EPC 2000) , item 10. Consulted on 31 October 2007. According to the Guidelines, the request can even be filed after expiry of the patent.: \\"Introduction\\": \\"(...) the request can be filed at any time after grant, after opposition proceedings, or even after expiry of the patent.\\" However, the request may not be filed while opposition proceedings are pending. Precedence, i.e. priority, is always given to opposition proceedings. This prevents limitation from occurring where an opposition has already been lodged.OJ 2007, Special edition 4/2007, page 116, item 3. If, at the time of filing a request for limitation or revocation, opposition proceedings are pending, the request \\"shall be deemed not to have been filed (see section \\"Special cases\\" - below - for the case, \\"likely to be infrequent in practice\\", where an opposition is filed \\"following the valid lodging of a request for limitation or revocation\\" ). The request must be filed with the EPO and the procedure is subject to the payment of a fee. The fee is due on the date that the request is filed.: \\"Fees for limitation/revocation, opposition, appeal, petition for review\\".  Admissibility  In addition, the request should be filed in writing and should contain:OJ 2007, Special edition 4/2007, page 116, item 2. * \\"particulars of the proprietor of the European patent making the request (the requester)\\"; * \\"an indication of the [EPC] Contracting States for which the requester is the proprietor of the patent\\"; * \\"the number of the patent whose limitation or revocation is requested\\"; * \\"a list of the Contracting States in which the patent has taken effect\\"; * \\"where appropriate, the names and addresses of the proprietors of the patent for those Contracting States in which the requester is not the proprietor of the patent, and evidence that the requester is entitled to act on their behalf in the proceedings\\"; * \\"where limitation of the patent is requested, the complete version of the amended claims and, as the case may be, of the amended description and drawings;\\" and * where the requester has appointed a representative, his name and the address of his place of business. and If these requirements are not met, the requester is invited to correct the deficiencies and, if this is not done, the Examining Division \\"shall reject the request as inadmissible\\". and .  Particulars of the proceedings and effects  The subject of limitation or revocation proceedings is the European patent as granted or as amended in opposition or limitation proceedings before the EPO.; : \\"Basis for the examination\\". Therefore, a European patent may be subject to several successive limitation proceedings.Since, under , the subject of limitation or revocation proceedings may be the European patent as amended in limitation proceedings. See also : \\"Basis for the examination\\" and : \\"Multiple requests\\". The responsibility for limitation or revocation proceedings, i.e. deciding on requests for limitation or revocation, rests with the Examining Division. The process of examining an admissible request for revocation differs from the process of examining an admissible request for limitation.For the examination of a request for revocation, see Rule 95(1) EPC 2000, for the examination of a request for limitation, see . As soon as a request for revocation is found to be admissible, the patent is revoked by the Examining Division. In contrast, in order to reach a decision on the allowability of a request for limitation, the Examining Division establishes whether the requested amendment of the claims actually limits the patent or \\"whether it is designed to protect something else\\".OJ 2007, Special edition 4/2007, page 118, item 5. It also establishes whether the amended claims meet the requirements of (clarity, conciseness and support of the claims) and (the amendments can not add subject-matter going beyond the content of the application as filed and the scope of protection cannot be extended after grant). When examining a request for limitation, \\"the EPO does not examine whether * the aim of the limitation (e.g. delimitation with respect to a particular prior art) is achieved, or * the subject-matter of the limited patent is still patentable...\\" OJ 2007, Special edition 4/2007, page 118, item 6. (this second point is intended to guarantee a quick decision ). The fact that the patentability of the limited patent is not checked by the EPO relies on the fact that the originally granted patent was valid when granted. Issues may however arise as a result of the absence of any check on patentability in rare cases where the priority right is endangered by the limitation.Andrea Veronese & Peter Watchorn, Procedural law under the EPC-2000, 3rd Edition May 2013, Kastner AG, Chapter XVIII.1.2.1. \\"Examination of substantive issues\\" , page 411. Upon approval of the amended claims by the Examining Division, a fee must be paid and the amended claims must be translated in the two official languages of the EPO other than the language of the proceedings, within a period of three months.Rule 95(3) EPC 2000 In addition, complete translations of the patent as limited, in an official language of some countries may need to be filed in the countries prescribing it. (see also London Agreement) and OJ 2007, Special edition 4/2007, page 118, item 12. The request for limitation or revocation has effect ab initio.; OJ 2007, Special edition 4/2007, page 118, item 10; and : \\"Decision on request for revocation\\". This means that the limitation or revocation has effect as from the filing date of the patent application which led to the patent, rather than from the date of the decision on the limitation or revocation. Decisions of the Examining Divisions in limitation and revocation proceedings are open to appeal.OJ 2007, Special edition 4/2007, page 118, item 6, as well as Articles 106(1) and 21 EPC.  Special cases  If opposition proceedings are initiated following the valid lodging of a request for limitation or revocation, the following applies: * \\"if revocation is requested, such proceedings are to continue and the patent may be revoked\\"; * \\"if limitation of the patent is requested, limitation proceedings are terminated\\". The limitation fee is reimbursed in this case. A requester may request to restrict the claims with respect to one or more, but not all, Contracting States. The limitation would then result in claims being different in different Contracting States. This may however only be done in some special cases, one of them being in order to avoid conflict with national prior rights (a national prior right is a national patent filed before the filing date - or priority date - of the European patent subject to the limitation procedure but published after the filing date - or priority date - of the European patent).: \\"Limitation results in the claims becoming different in different Contracting States\\". This results from .  Relation with national proceedings  \\"The European limitation procedure does not ... take precedence over national proceedings (revocation proceedings in particular). Where parallel cases do occur, the national proceedings can be stayed or continued in accordance with national law or practice. Where national proceedings resulting in limitation have already been concluded, the limitation may be extended to further contracting states via European limitation proceedings (provided the requirements of the EPC are met). [In addition,] limitation of a European patent in proceedings before the EPO does not preclude further limitation in national proceedings.\\" OJ 2007, Special edition 4/2007, page 116, item 4.

Twentieth Century Negro Literature (1902) noted that \\"she is regarded as one of the foremost and best cultured women of her race.\\" Biography Ariel Serena Hedges was born in Newark, New Jersey where her father, Charles Hedges, was a Presbyterian clergyman. He was an 1869 graduate of Lincoln University in Pennsylvania and he had organized churches in New York State. Her mother represented one of the oldest Presbyterian families of that state. Her grandfather was a bugler in the Mexican war, and was a Guard of Honor when Lafayette revisited the United States. Her parents moved to Pittsburgh, where she attended the Avery Institute and completed the academic course at this school. Her parents then moved to Baltimore, where her father became pastor of Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church, and finally of Grace Presbyterian Church. She was sent to high school in Springfield, Massachusetts where she remained, and they graduated her with honor in 1885. She also took the Teachers' Course and Examination and passed a creditable examination, afterwards being favorably considered as teacher for one of the schools of that city. She then was called to teach History and English Language at the Tuskegee Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama under Prof. B. T. Washington. She read Greek, Latin, and German with facility. In 1886, Hedges was married to Dr. J. W. E. Bowen of the Gammon Theological Seminary, Atlanta, Georgia. She became a life member of the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church. She moved to Atlanta with her husband in 1893, where the couple raised a family of four children (one son and three daughters). Bowen became Professor of Music in Clark University in 1895, writing broadly on music (Music in the Home), as well as being an accomplished vocalist and musician with the piano and pipe organ. Bowen also was a notable figure in the Southern Women's Christian Temperance Union, writing The Ethics of Reform and serving as state president of the Georgia W. C. T. U., No. 2.

He started his career making small-format cabinet pictures of genre scenes, in particular of Caravaggesque merry companies. Later he switched to history painting, working on larger formats in a Flemish Baroque style which was influenced by Rubens and van Dyck. Life Simon de Vos was born in Antwerp as the son of the dice maker Herman de Vos and Elisabeth van Oppen.Frans Jozef Peter Van den Branden, Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche schilderschool, Antwerpen, 1883, pp. 808‚Äì902 Merry Company, 1631 At only 12 years old de Vos started his art studies in 1615 with the eminent portrait painter Cornelis de Vos (1584 ‚Äì 1651), to whom he was not related.Christine van Mulders, \\"Vos, Simon de,\\" Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, [accessed 11 July 2014]. Upon completion of his training in 1620, he became at the young age of 17 a master in Antwerp's Guild of Saint Luke. There is uncertainty about de Vos' movements after he became a master. It is possible that he stayed in Antwerp, where he may have worked in the workshop of Peter Paul Rubens. Alternatively, he may have travelled abroad. A stay in Rome is suggested by his early works, which show a similarity with the \\"low-life\\" genre paintings of the group of Dutch and Flemish painters active in Rome known as the Bamboccianti. An influence by the German painter Johann Liss active in Rome in the 1620s has been discerned in de Vos' paintings and may also be explained by a residence in Rome.Hans Vlieghe, Flemish Art and Architecture 1585‚Äì1700, New Haven: Yale University Press (1998): 152. In addition, on the basis of the attribution to Simon de Vos of a 1626 composition referred to as Gathering of Smokers and Drinkers (Louvre Museum, Paris) it is believed that de Vos resided in Aix-en-Provence in France in the mid-1620s.Gathering of Smokers and Drinkers at the Louvre Gathering of Smokers and Drinkers, 1626 De Vos must have returned to his hometown in 1626 as in that year he married Catharina van Utrecht, a sister of the Antwerp still life painter Adriaen van Utrecht. The couple remained childless. He worked in Antwerp for most of his life. He is known to have supplied art works for the Antwerp art dealers Forchondt and Chrysostoom van Immerseel. He enjoyed the respect of his peers as is shown by the fact that when Rubens died his estate included one of his pictures.Simon de Vos at the Netherlands Institute for Art History De Vos was successful financially. When his wife died in 1670 he possessed four properties in Antwerp and owned a collection of 290 paintings. Between 1629 and 1649 he received 6 pupils. These included Gregori de Greeff, the other Jan van Kessel (ca. 1620-in of na 1661), Jan van Kessel the Elder and Caspar van Opstal. Work =Early work: genre paintings= Martyrdom of St Philip, 1645‚Äì1648 De Vos' first works were cabinet pictures of genre scenes, including various merry companies and group portraits. These are composed in a Mannerist, pyramidical construction. The settings are loosely sketched in and the colours are rich and often gaudy. His style in this period is close to that of the German painter Johann Liss‚Äîactive in Italy during the 1620s‚Äî (particularly in the Caravaggesque treatment of the merry company scenes) and Frans Francken the Younger. It also showed the influence of the Caravaggists of Utrecht. The Fortune Teller, 1639 An example of a painting from this period is the Gathering of Smokers and Drinkers (Louvre Museum, Paris) of 1626. The painting depicts three young men at half-length who are enjoying a pipe and a glass of wine. The persons represented are assumed to be Simon de Vos himself (in the middle), flanked on the left by Jan Cossiers and on the right by Johan Geerlof. Cossiers and Geerlof were two artist friends of de Vos who had also settled in Aix-en-Provence. Typical for his early work, Simon de Vos painted the faces in this composition with thick features and eyes set wide apart. The painting's composition, tightly framing three half- length figures, is clearly influenced by the Caravaggists of Utrecht. Simon de Vos used the light effects typical of the Caravaggists by lighting the artists' faces from the painting's left-hand side, making the faces stand out against the neutral background. The inspiration for the picture may have been the early works of Caravaggio himself, which Simon de Vos may have seen if he visited Rome. His works from the late 1620s until around 1640, which were made after returning to Antwerp, are mostly small \\"merry company\\" and courtly genre scenes reminiscent of contemporary Dutch painters Dirck Hals and Pieter Codde. Garland of flowers surrounding a mocking of Christ =Later work: history paintings= After 1640, de Vos turned almost entirely away from genre scenes and painted mostly religious, history subjects and allegorical scenes, influenced stylistically at first by Rubens and then increasingly by Anthony van Dyck. Examples include The Martyrdom of St Philip (c. 1645‚Äì1648) in the Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Antwerp. These later works were generally larger in format but used the compositional formulae of the cabinet paintings and therefore appear to lack balance. During this period he also created a 12-part series from Genesis (1635‚Äì44; Seville Cathedral and elsewhere), which includes a large number of animals. It is therefore assumed that Simon de Vos was likely a specialist in the field of animal painting. =Collaborations= As was current practice in Antwerp in the 17th century, de Vos often collaborated with other artists who were specialists in their field. Allegory of Vanitas He is known to have collaborated with the flower painter Daniel Seghers and Alexander Adriaenssen on so-called 'garland paintings'.A Garland of Flowers Surrounding a Mocking of Christ at the Nasher Museum of ArtA Garland of Flowers Surrounding the Holy Family with St John at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Garland paintings are a special type of still life developed in Antwerp by Jan Brueghel the Elder in collaboration with the Italian cardinal Federico Borromeo at the beginning of the 17th century.David Freedberg, \\"The Origins and Rise of the Flemish Madonnas in Flower Garlands, Decoration and Devotion\\", M√ºnchener Jahrbuch der bildenden Kunst, xxxii, 1981, pp. 115‚Äì150. The genre was initially connected to the visual imagery of the Counter-Reformation movement. It was further inspired by the cult of veneration and devotion to Mary prevalent at the Habsburg court (then the rulers over the Southern Netherlands) and in Antwerp generally.Susan Merriam, Seventeenth-Century Flemish Garland Paintings. Still Life, Vision and the Devotional Image, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2012 Garland paintings typically show a flower garland around a devotional image, portrait or other religious symbol (such as the host). Garland paintings were usually collaborations between a still life and a figure painter. An example of a collaboration between de Vos and Seghers on a garland painting is A Garland of Flowers Surrounding a Mocking of Christ (c. 1643, Nasher Museum of Art), which shows a garland of flowers painted by Daniel Seghers surrounding a cartouche depicting the mocking of Christ by de Vos. De Vos also collaborated with the animal painter Frans Snyders.J. Michalkowa: Les tableaux de Simon de Vos dans les collections polonaises, Bulletin du Mus√©e National de Varsovie, vol.

Nautilus workout machines proved to be very similar to Gustav Zander's exercising machines which were widespread in America in the early 20th century, but Jones insists that he made these discoveries without any knowledge of Zander's discoveries: :\\"So, in attempts to improve my exercise results, I designed and built a total of about twenty very sophisticated exercise machines, then believing that these were the first exercise machines ever built by anybody. But many years later, I learned that a doctor named Gustav Zander had designed and built a number of exercise machines in Europe nearly a hundred years before I built my first one; I did not copy Zander's work and learned nothing from him, was not even aware of his work until long after I had made the same discoveries that he had made. But if I had known about, and understood, Zander's work, it would have saved me a lot of time and a rather large fortune in money, because the man was a genius; his only problem was that he lived about a century ahead of his time, at a time when very few people cared about exercise and even fewer knew anything about it.\\"Brian D.

He is considered to be the \\"father of deprogramming.\\" Early life Ted Patrick was born in what he calls \\"a red-light district\\" of Chattanooga, Tennessee, in which he was surrounded by \\"thieves, prostitutes, murderers [and] pimps\\". He dropped out of high school in tenth grade to help support his family, worked a variety of jobs and opened a nightclub, then became co-chairman of the Nineteenth Ward in Chattanooga. At the age of twenty-five, he left his wife and infant son in Tennessee, and went with a friend to San Diego, California, where he became an activist for the black community. For his efforts in the Watts Riots in 1965, Patrick was awarded the Freedom Foundation Award, which ultimately led to his job as the Special Assistant for Community Affairs, under then-Governor Ronald Reagan. Career as a deprogrammer Despite a lack of formal education and professional training, Patrick was hired by hundreds of parents and family members to \\"deprogram\\" their loved ones. A high school dropout, Patrick based his techniques and practices on his own life experience. Patrick once remarked in a May 1979 TV debate with members of the Hare Krishna group, \\"How I got into deprogramming was through my own son. All outdoor boy, couldn't nothing keep him in the house. Then one day, he was psychologic... psychological(ly) kidnap(ped) by a cult\\". In this interview, Patrick also explained how this search to understand cults led him to speaking with \\"witches, warlocks, healers\\" and in fact, he went \\"all the way to New Orleans\\" to the same person his mother brought him to for his speech impediment. He also stated that he spent time in a religious group and after a week \\"...didn't know where I were, nor how I got there...I was hook(ed).\\" Patrick stated this research, and his understanding of the mind from his ongoing struggle with his own speech, served as the background for his work in deprogramming. On 12 June 1971, Mrs. Samuel Jackson contacted Patrick to file a complaint concerning her missing son, Billy. As Billy was 19, the police and FBI would not look for him. Billy was involved with the group known as the Children of God, who had approached Patrick's own son, Michael, a week prior. Patrick contacted other people whose relatives were in the cult, and even pretended to join them, to study how the group operated. This was when he developed his method of deprogramming. He ultimately left his full-time job in order to work on deprogramming full time. Patrick founded the FREECOG organization, later known as the Citizen's Freedom Foundation, in 1971 before merging into the Cult Awareness Network. As one of the pioneers of deprogramming, Patrick used a 'confrontational' method: Patrick stood trial several times on kidnapping charges related to his activities. After the first trial, which found him not guilty, he stopped executing the actual kidnapping but continued with his deprogramming. He testified before an ad hoc Congressional committee organized in 1979 by Senator Bob Dole. According to The New Republic, Dole intended the hearing to \\"provide a forum\\" for Patrick and other anti-cult activists. In 1980 Patrick was paid $27,000 to carry out the deprogramming of Susan Wirth, a 35-year-old teacher living in San Francisco. He was hired by her parents, who objected to her involvement in leftist political activities. The process involved handcuffing her to a bed for two weeks and denying her food.Postpage, Stephen Garrard (Georgetown University Press 1993) Inquiries in Bioethics ( / 978-0-87840-538-1 page 71)Beaver County Times (Associated Press 2 July 1980) Daughter kidnapped over politics (page A-13) (Retrieved 14 November 2013) She was later released and after returning to San Francisco spoke out against deprogramming but declined to press legal charges against her parents or Patrick.Merced Sun-Star (29 July 1980) \\"Feared kidnapped, she reconciles with mother.\\" A documentary about the career of Patrick, DEPROGRAMMED, directed by Mia Donovan was released April 26, 2015 by EyeSteelFilm. Civil and criminal proceedings involving Patrick Some criminal proceedings against Patrick have resulted in felony convictions for kidnapping and unlawful imprisonment. *In 1980, Patrick was convicted of conspiracy, kidnapping, and false imprisonment. These charges were related to the abduction and attempted deprogramming of Roberta McElfish, a 26-year-old Tucson waitress. Patrick was sentenced to one year in prison and fined five thousand dollars. *In 1990, Patrick attempted to deprogram Elma Miller, an Amish woman who had joined a liberal sect. He was hired by her husband to return her to him and the Amish church. Criminal charges of conspiracy were filed against Miller's husband, brother, and two others; but were later dropped on her request to the prosecuting attorney, who decided not to charge Patrick.Amish Woman Asks Prosecutor to Drop Charges on Kidnapping, Madison Courier, December 8, 1990, pg. 3 References Sources *Conway and Siegelman, Black Lightning (Chapter 6 of Snapping: America's Epidemic of Sudden Personality Change), 1995, *Ted Patrick, Let Our Children Go (Chapter 1 of Ted Patrick's Let Our Children Go), Publications * Patrick, Ted.

CASP7 orthologs have been identified in nearly all mammals for which complete genome data are available. Unique orthologs are also present in birds, lizards, lissamphibians, and teleosts.  Function  Caspase-7 is a member of the caspase (cysteine aspartate protease) family of proteins, and has been shown to be an executioner protein of apoptosis. Sequential activation of caspases plays a central role in the execution-phase of cell apoptosis. Caspases exist as inactive proenzymes that undergo proteolytic processing by upstream caspases (caspase-8, -9) at conserved aspartic residues to produce two subunits, large and small, that dimerize to form the active enzyme in the form of a heterotetramer. The precursor of this caspase is cleaved by caspase 3, caspase 10, and caspase 9. It is activated upon cell death stimuli and induces apoptosis. Alternative splicing results in four transcript variants, encoding three distinct isoforms.  Interactions  Caspase 7 has been shown to interact with: * Caspase 8, * Survivin and * XIAP.

The PDBREPORTS database is a useful facility for judging the quality of protein structures in in silico protein structure bioinformatics projects, and has been used frequently by participants of the CASP homology modelling 'competition'. PDBREPORTs are made using the WHAT_CHECK software. WHAT_CHECK is the option of the WHAT IF software that validates macromolecules (especially proteins). Many of the WHAT_CHECK options determine normality values; that is, the number of standard deviations that any given observation deviates from its mean.

The section 'validation' of the WHAT_CHECK pages explains this with more detail. Issues PDBREPORT entries may be seen as error reports for macromolecular structures deposited in the PDB. The term error report should be used with caution as the WHAT_CHECK software that produces the PDBREPORT flags every anomaly of four standard deviations or more as an error.

Fern√°ndez (December 7, 1925 ‚Äì March 13, 1986) was a Cuban artist, photographer, and photojournalist. He was an art director of Visi√≥n Magazine in New York City and a photographer for the Revoluci√≥n newspaper in Havana, Cuba. Fern√°ndez was granted the Cintas Foundation Fellowship for painting in 1967 and 1975.  Biography  Jesse Antonio Fern√°ndez was born in Havana, Cuba on December 7, 1925. He and his family moved to Asturias, Spain in the late 1920s to escape the repressive leadership of Cuban leader Gerardo Machado. They returned to Cuba in December 1936 to escape the Spanish Civil War. In 1942, Fern√°ndez left for Philadelphia to study electronic engineering. In 1945, he returned to Cuba, and devoted himself to painting. In 1947, Fern√°ndez returned the United States, settling in New York City. He registered with the Art Students League, where he studied painting with George Grosz and Preston Dickinson. In 1948, Fern√°ndez met painter Wifredo Lam, who introduced him to several European painters living in New York City at the time, including Marcel Duchamp and Esteban Franc√©s. In 1949, Fern√°ndez's daughter Yolanda was born in New York City. In 1952, Fern√°ndez travelled to Medellin, Colombia, where he was influenced to begin studying photography. In 1954, Fern√°ndez worked for Propaganda Epoca, a Colombian advertising agency, where he met Fernando Botero and Gabriel Garcia M√°rquez. In 1955, Fern√°ndez travelled the Amazonian area of El Atrato, studying archaeology and ethnology. After photographing Native Americans in Guajira for four months, he returned to New York City, where he sold many of the photographs he had taken in South America. In 1957, he took part as a photographer in the filming of Nazar√≠n de Luis Bu√±uel in Mexico. His photographs were published in Life, Esquire, Paris Match, Jours of France, Pagent, Cosmopolitan, Evergreen Review, Time Magazine, The New York Times, and the Herald Tribune. In 1958, Fern√°ndez accepted the artistic director position for Visi√≥n magazine, for which he traveled to Ecuador, Mexico, and Central America. He also worked as a photographer for the Revoluci√≥n newspaper and its weekly magazine, the Lunes of Revoluci√≥n, photographing writers, musicians, and artists, including Jose Lezama Lima and Ernest Hemingway. During this time period he traveled to Havana on a yearly basis to see his family. During one of these trips, he wrote a report on the artistic life of Cuba for Life Magazine. In 1960, he returned to New York City and temporarily gave up photography to devote himself to painting, teaching at the School Visual Arts. He lived in the ‚ÄúVillage‚Äù, regularly meeting with Jorge Luis Borges, Aldous Huxley, Joan Mir√≥, Antoni T√†pies, and Antonio Will. In 1961, his work was exhibited at the D‚ÄôArcy Gallery of New York. In 1969, he started to alternate his work in New York with stays in San Juan, Puerto Rico, in search of an environment more favorable to creation. During this period he wrote as an art critic for several publications, including the San Juan Star, Opus International, and Knowledge of Arts. From 1971 to 1973, his works were exhibited at the El Morro gallery in San Juan, the museum of the University of Puerto Rico, and at the Alliance Fran1caise and Botello gallery in San Juan. Between 1974 and 1976, he lived in the Spanish cities of Toledo and Madrid. In the late 1970s and early 1980s he took part in several exhibitions, including the Basel Art Fair 76, one at the Ynguanzo gallery of Madrid, ‚ÄúOne Jackson Pollock‚Äù at the American Arts center of Paris, ‚ÄúSiete A√±os‚Äù at the Theo gallery of Madrid, one at the American Arts center of Madrid, and another at the Museum of Contemporary art in Caracas, Venezuela. He died in Paris, France, on March 13, 1986. Legacy Fern√°ndez's work was included in Caras y m√°scaras, exhibited at Galer√≠a 8 in 1983 and at Miami Dade Community College in 1988. In 1993, Cintas Fellows Revisited: A Decade After was shown at the Main Library of the Metro Dade Cultural Center in Miami, Florida. The same year, his work was included in Photography by Cintas Fellows, which was exhibited at The Art Museum of the Florida International University in Miami. In 2003, the National Museum of Art Reina Sofia in Madrid held a retrospective of his photographs, drawings, and cajas (boxes) from June to September. Archives of his works are kept by the Cuban Office of Historical Matters in Havana and the Cintas Foundation in New York.

He received nominations for the British Academy Film Award and four Oscars, including two wins (in 1962 and 1964). A native of Louisiana, Eugene F. Callahan had a lifelong association with the state. He kept a home in the capital, Baton Rouge, where he began his designing career in the 1940s as a student at Louisiana State University, and his penultimate film assignment was as production designer on Steel Magnolias, lensed in Natchitoches in 1989. Callahan was a prolific contributor to early television, starting with the first full-schedule broadcast season in 1948‚Äì49. He worked on numerous live shows during TV's Golden Age and continued with filmed episodes through the late 1950s and early 60s. His first film as set decorator was 1959's The Fugitive Kind, and his fourth assignment, 1961's black-and-white The Hustler brought him his first Academy Award. 1964 was a banner year for him with two Oscar nominations--The Cardinal in the color category and America America in the category of black-and-white films, with the latter winning him his second Oscar. Unlike the 1962 win for The Hustler, which he shared with production designer Harry Horner or his shared nomination for The Cardinal with production designer Lyle R. Wheeler, the award for America America, was his alone. Elia Kazan's acclaimed epic set in turn-of- the-century Greece and Turkey was nominated for Best Picture and Best Director, but it was Callahan's epic production values that won the film's only Oscar. Gene Callahan's professional relationship with Elia Kazan began two years before America America and extended to four of Kazan's final five films. The first title, 1961's Splendor in the Grass, which introduced Warren Beatty to the screen and won an Oscar for William Inge's screenplay, credited Callahan as the set decorator. Eight years later, he was the production designer for Kazan's next film after America, America, 1969's The Arrangement, which received almost entirely negative reviews and no Oscar nominations. He did not work on Kazan's next production, 1972's The Visitors, another poorly accepted title, but five years later, in 1977, there was one more Oscar nomination for Gene Callahan. The Last Tycoon, Elia Kazan's final directorial effort assigned him the task of recreating 1920s Hollywood as it was portrayed in F. Scott Fitzgerald's last, unfinished novel which reimagined the period setting and its driven, doomed protagonist, an Irving Thalberg-like movie producer, portrayed by Robert De Niro. The nomination (shared with art director Jack T. Collis and set decorator Jerry Wunderlich) was the only one given by the Academy to the film, which in addition to a mixture of good, tepid and negative reviews, was burdened by weak publicity and box office returns. Gene Callahan died of a heart attack at his home in Baton Rouge, seven weeks after his 67th birthday. His final film, The Man in the Moon, a touching coming-of-age story filmed, as in the case of Steel Magnolias, in Natchitoches as well as Louisiana's Kisatchie National Forest, was released in October 1991, nearly a year after his death.

After the departure of original guitarist Andy Taylor in 2006, the band decided to start over with a new batch of songs that became 2007's Red Carpet Massacre. The making of Reportage In Andy's 2008 autobiography, Wild Boy: My Life in Duran Duran, he revealed that the band had originally been offered the opportunity to record their next album \\"aboard a [$450 million] superyacht owned by Paul Allen... but sadly the plan fell through at the last minute due to the boat becoming unavailable.\\"'\\"Wild Boy: My Life In Duran Duran\\" by Andy Taylor, 1st Edition, Grand Central Publishing, New York, 2008, p.297-8 Instead they began with three weeks of self-produced recording sessions at Andre Agassi's Tiburon mansion in September 2005.YouTube video: Duran Duran - Reportage They moved the recording sessions to London in October, where they continued working on the album until April 2006 with Michael Patterson as engineer and co-producer.Studio update... 4/20/2006 In March, drummer Roger Taylor commented that \\"the record will be in some ways a homage to our roots as a band, more direct and a return to our dance and new wave origins.\\"A Postcard From The Studio Bassist John Taylor discussed the circumstances behind Reportage during a 2007 XM Radio Artist Confidential Session: \\"We'd been on the road with the reunion tour for a couple of years and we were feeling pretty confident. We felt that we'd found ourselves again as musicians, so we were quite excited to come off the road and start writing and recording straight away. Our confidence was such [that] we felt we didn't need a producer, we could make all the decisions ourselves, so we wrote songs quite quickly and really felt that we had an album.\\" According to Andy, John was taking charge of the sessions: \\"We did some more recording in February 2006, and this time John seemed more determined than ever to take on the role of producer.\\"'\\"Wild Boy: My Life In Duran Duran\\" by Andy Taylor, 1st Edition, Grand Central Publishing, New York, 2008, p.302 Following sessions at London's Sphere Studios, they submitted a rough mix of the album to their record label Sony Music in May 2006, but it was rejected for not having an obvious lead single. According to John, \\"I guess we'd worked on it for about six months, we got a title Reportage and we kind of had a cover and we presented it to the label. They said they heard the second single and the third single but not the first single, so they suggested could we perhaps go and cut a couple of songs with a producer -- maybe something a little bit more commercial.\\" According to Andy, the band met with producer Youth in June and discussed working with him at his studio in Spain that Autumn to \\"work out which bits were the most important and how to make all the various components work together as a whole.\\"'\\"Wild Boy: My Life In Duran Duran\\" by Andy Taylor, 1st Edition, Grand Central Publishing, New York, 2008, p.305 They also made plans to record a few potential singles with Timbaland in October. The band and Timbaland had previously met and expressed their desire to work together. Timbaland sessions and second split with Andy Taylor The Timbaland sessions were advanced to September to allow for the participation of Justin Timberlake. They both joined the band along with Nate \\"Danja\\" Hills at Manhattan Center Studios in New York City for writing and recording sessions, but Andy didn't appear. After a month of fan speculation, on 26 October 2006, Duran Duran announced that \\"As of last weekend, the four of us have dissolved our partnership and will be continuing as Duran Duran without Andy, as we have reached a point in our relationship with him where there is an unworkable gulf between us and we can no longer effectively function together. Although obviously disappointed and saddened about this, we are excited about the next chapter of the Duran Duran story and look forward to seeing you all soon.\\".Duran Duran: \\"A message to our fans\\"Billboard: \\"Andy Taylor splits with Duran Duran\\" One week later, before a concert in Providence, John Taylor went on to suggest that the split had been coming for some time: \\"We've not really been on the same page for a while. And it's been getting very testy most of this year, actually. And there's just been a break coming. We‚Äôve had different aims, different considerations, different loyalties. (...) And life goes on. Four out of the five of us have rediscovered each other, and realized that we‚Äôre the best friends we've ever had. And we‚Äôre enormously grateful to have each other in our lives. And there's nobody I'd rather make music with, and I can say the same for the other three. I don't think I could say that for Andy.\\"Providence Journal: \\"Duran Duran stays strong despite rift\\" Andy Taylor later wrote in his autobiography that there had been \\"pressure building up\\" between the band members, a \\"lack of clear direction\\" during the sessions, and that the music had been prematurely submitted to Sony in his opinion: \\"the album needed more work\\" he wrote, although he had \\"played enough guitar parts for about three albums\\". Andy attributed the cause of his departure to a combination of \\"constant arguments within the band\\", clinical depression brought on by his father's recent death, and \\"administrative failures by the band's management\\" in neglecting to renew his US work visa, leaving him feeling \\"as if I'd been trapped on a derailed runaway train.\\"'\\"Wild Boy: My Life In Duran Duran\\" by Andy Taylor, 1st Edition, Grand Central Publishing, New York, 2008, p.292,303-4,307-10 The band initially planned to incorporate the new Timbaland-produced songs into Reportage. A December 2006 Billboard article claimed that \\"the as-yet-untitled follow-up to 2004's Astronaut would also feature the reggae-tinged '48 Hours Later' and 'Transcendental Mental,' which Rhodes says takes aim at 'new-age frauds. It's one of the funniest lyrics Simon has written in many years.'... Asked if the disparate sounds of [the Timbaland tracks] compared to the album's more guitar-driven songs may be jarring to the listener, Rhodes says, 'With [those cuts], you can tell there was another hand in them for sure. Although they are a slight change of direction in that some of the others are a bit more guitar-heavy or indie- sounding, Simon is the glue that holds them all together.'\\"Duran Duran Grooves With Timbaland, Timberlake Red Carpet Massacre After parting ways with their guitarist the band soon decided to abandon all of the \\"Reportage\\" songs, cancel the Youth sessions, and further explore their new musical direction with Dom Brown on guitar and Danja producing and co-writing.Timbaland gives Duran Duran a new sound John was quoted as saying, \\"we were kind of coming to the decision that we were going to let go of all of this music, and we were going to let go of songs that we had been working on for months and months. But there was such a thing that we were moving forward, that we were creating this new identity.\\"Duran Duran Gets An Update As Rhodes commented later, \\"Our sound exploded with pop culture's brightest flowers (...) The vision became clear\\".Duran Duran: \\"A postcard from the studio\\" Duran Duran wrote and recorded three songs with Timbaland, and they became the starting core of an entirely new album titled Red Carpet Massacre. Completed with the help of Hills, Jimmy Douglass and Timberlake, and anticipated by the Falling Down single, Red Carpet Massacre was released on 19 November 2007 to mixed reviews and disappointing sales (it peaked at #44 on the UK album chart compared to the #3 peak position of Astronaut). As a result, the band broke ties with Epic Records and its parent company Sony. In a 2011 interview for the release of their album All You Need Is Now, Nick and John commented on the Reportage/Red Carpet Massacre days. According to John Taylor, \\"That whole project was a fucking nightmare. We delivered an album to Sony that was a natural-sounding, almost rock album, and they were like 'We need something a bit pop, do you fancy doing a couple of tracks with Timbaland?' And around the same time we fell out with Andy, so the Timbaland stuff sounded hugely different from what we'd done before.\\" Nick Rhodes expanded: \\"The thing was, we got an opportunity to work with Timbaland, so we thought 'Great, let's go for it'. We knew it was a risk in terms of what the fans would like, if you're working with someone who is ostensibly an electro/hip hop producer. When Timbaland saw the guitar and the bass and the drums come in to the studio, I think he was mortified, because everything's in a box for those guys. But I'm really glad we made that album, because in time I think it will stand up.\\"Boys On Film: Duran Duran Interviewed Songs recorded for Reportage Keyboardist Nick Rhodes described the album's edgy sound in an interview with Details magazine: \\"It was a very angry record for Duran Duran, quite political. We've always reflected what's around us; it's just that we always tried to pick the more uplifting subjects. But there was so much doom and gloom and horror that it had got pretty deep under our skin. There's one track on there called 'Criminals In The Capital,' about our dueling leaders on both sides of the Atlantic... there was one song about a fighter pilot in the [Iraq] war. There's another song, one of my favourites on the record, actually, about the decay of the world and how we're all ignoring it ‚Äî a song of desperation.\\"Wild Boys Never Lose It Singer Simon Le Bon said of the album in 2011: \\"I would be failing in my duty if I didn't get at least the song '48 Hours Later', which is sublime. It's one of the best Duran Duran songs I've ever heard. And it would work well with what we're doing now. You could easily have it on All You Need Is Now. There's another one called 'Transcendental Mental' which sounds great. There's another called 'Traumatized' which lyrically isn't as strong, but the melody is great.\\" He also mentioned a song with the working title of 'Nobody' in a September 2005 interview on YouTube: \\"We wanted to recapture the rawness and energy of our first album and I think we've got it with songs like 'Traumatized' and 'Nobody', which are working titles obviously.\\" John commented on a song called \\"Under the Wire\\" in April 2006: > We have been working on around fifteen songs over the last couple of > months... We're mixing today, a song for the new album. It's a noisy one, > quite aggressive in places, and Mike Patterson our Engineer/Co-Producer is > working several knobs at once so that Simon sounds just the right mixture of > nasty and cool. It's new territory for us, this song. It's about > alienation‚Ä¶or is it? I have to be careful making assumptions about Simon's > lyrics. The chorus line, 'We go under the wire, we go in under fire.' But > this war zone is domestic, a council estate. He also mentioned the songs \\"Angel Fire\\" and \\"Criminals In The Capitol\\" during the band's 2007 XM Radio session: \\"we were writing songs about the stuff that was on the television, the stuff that was in the newspapers -- there was a song called 'Criminals In The Capitol', there was a song called 'Angel Fire'.\\" Information on another song was provided by the Duranasty news site: \\"There is one song of Reportage called 'Judy, Where Are You'. Nick told me that the song is about their friend in New Orleans who went missing after Hurricane Katrina. Nick said it's a beautiful song and has got [a] Kinks influence.\\"Duranasty.com April 2008 Archived News Additionally, the song titles 'Naomi Tonight' and 'You Ain't Foolin' No One' were revealed by music industry insiders on the Velvet Rope message board.Velvet Rope Forums: Duran Duran Both song titles have also been registered by the band with ASCAP.Google ACSAP searchGoogle ASCAP search These are the working song titles that have been identified by band members and music industry sources as being part of the Reportage project before it was abandoned: * \\"Criminals in the Capitol\\" * \\"48 Hours Later\\" * \\"Transcendental Mental\\" * \\"Traumatized\\" * \\"Angel Fire\\" * \\"Under the Wire\\" * \\"Judy, Where Are You?\\" * \\"Naomi Tonight\\" * \\"You Ain't Foolin' No One\\" All of the above song titles are registered with ASCAP. \\"Criminals in the Capital\\" was registered as 'Criminals In The Capitol, 'Traumatized' was registered with the American spelling and 'Judy, Where Are You?' was registered as 'Judy'.

Hylands House, Writtle, near Chelmsford Early life He was born the eldest surviving son of William Comyns, barrister, of Lincoln's Inn and his wife Elizabeth, the daughter and coheiress of Matthew Rudd of Little Baddow, Essex. He was educated at Felsted School and Queens' College, Cambridge.http://www.queens.cam.ac.uk/page-242 Career Comyns was a member of Lincoln's Inn, and was called to the bar in 1690. He entered Parliament in 1701 as member for Maldon, and represented that borough for 17 of the next 26 years (1701‚Äì08, 1710‚Äì15 and 1722‚Äì26). On the three separate occasions on which he was returned for Maldon his opponents petitioned against his election, alleging bribery or improper conduct by the bailiff (who was the returning officer for the borough); but their only success was in 1715 when they also accused him of having refused to take the Qualification Oath, and his election in that case was declared void on those grounds. He was made serjeant-at-law in 1705, and was appointed a Baron of the Exchequer and knighted in 1726, a Justice of Common Pleas in 1736 and Chief Baron of the Exchequer in 1738. Works Comyns is the author of 'Reports of Cases adjudged in the Courts of King's Bench, Common Pleas, and Exchequer.' This work was written in law French. The 'Reports' were translated by the judge's nephew J. Comyns of the Inner Temple, and published in one volume in 1744, with the sanction and approbation of the judges. They were re-edited in 1792 by Samuel Rose. He is also the author of 'A Digest of the Laws of England' This work was also written in law French but afterwards translated. Hylands House Around 1726, Sir John Comyns purchased the manor of Shaxstones in Writtle, and commissioned the construction of a new family home on the estate, suitable for a man of his standing. Completed in 1730, Hylands House was an elegant two-storey red brick building in Queen Anne style architecture. The grounds were set out in the formal geometric style fashionable at the time, with a pleasure garden and small kitchen garden to the north of the house. It is now a Grade II* listed building. Family He married three times; firstly Anne, daughter and coheiress of Dr Nathaniel Gurdon, rector of Chelmsford, secondly Elizabeth Courthorpe of Kent and thirdly Anne Wilbraham. He left no children. Hylands passed to a nephew, also John Comyns, after the death of his widow.

The premises include the former Wholesale Market Hall (Gro√ümarkthalle), a new 185/165 m twin-skyscraper and a new low-rise building to connect the two. It was completed in 2014 and was officially opened on 18 March 2015. The ECB is required by the Treaties of the European Union to have its seat within the city limits of Frankfurt, the largest financial centre in the Eurozone. The ECB previously resided in the Eurotower and, due to lack of office space there, in three other high-rise buildings (Eurotheum, Japan Center and Neue Mainzer Stra√üe 32‚Äì36) in the city centre of Frankfurt. Architecture The newly built main office building consists of two towers that are joined by an atrium with four interchange platforms. The North tower has 45 storeys and a roof height of , whereas the South tower has 43 storeys and a roof height of . With the antenna, the North tower reaches a height of . The new ECB premises furthermore comprises the Grossmarkthalle, a former wholesale market hall built from 1926‚Äì1928 and fully renovated for its new purpose. History =Development= In 1999, an international architectural competition was launched by the bank to design a new building. It was won by a Vienna-based architectural office called Coop Himmelb(l)au. The building was to be 185 meters tall (201 meters with antenna), accompanied by other secondary buildings on a landscaped site on the site of the former wholesale market (Gro√ümarkthalle) in the eastern part of Frankfurt. The main construction work was planned to commence in October 2008, with completion scheduled for before the end of 2011. Construction was put on hold in June 2008 as the ECB was unable to find a contractor that would build the Skytower for the allocated budget of ‚Ç¨500 million due to the bidding taking place at the peak of the pre-late-2000s recession bubble. A year later with prices having fallen significantly the ECB launched a new tendering process broken up into segments. File:Grossmarkthalle002.jpgGro√ümarkthalle site (2006) File:European Central Bank Headquarters (model 01).jpgModel seen in 2011 File:European Central Bank - new building under construction - Frankfurt - Germany - 23.jpgConstruction in 2012 File:Europ√§ische Zentralbank - European Central Bank (19190136328).jpgBuilding at night It is expected that the building will become an architectural symbol for Europe and is designed to cope with double the number of staff who operate in the Eurotower. The total cost of the project was between 1,3 and 1,4 billion euros. For the total surface of 185 000 square meters, this gives a building cost in excess of 7000 euros per square meter. =Opening= Staff began moving into the new building in November 2014, and the building was officially opened on 18 March 2015. The opening was marked by a three-day protest by the anti-capitalist Blockupy movement, an offshoot of the Occupy movement, and other opponents of the European troika, and by violence across Frankfurt on the opening day. Police used water cannons and tear gas against protestors, while demonstrators threw stones at police, firefighters and Frankfurt's trams, and set fire to cars and barricades. The ECB's new headquarters was reportedly selected as the venue for the demonstration so as to highlight the contradiction between the ECB's lavish spending on its own 1,4 billion euro building while forcing cuts and market reforms on countries like Greece and Cyprus. Ulrich Wilken, an organizer, said: ‚ÄúOur protest is against the ECB, as a member of the troika, that, despite the fact that it is not democratically elected, hinders the work of the Greek government. We want the austerity politics to end.‚Äù The pan- European protests included members of Greece's radical left governing party Syriza and Spain's left-wing Podemos. Headquarters Agreement The Seat of the European Central Bank enjoys special legal protections granted by its Headquarters Agreement with the German government. It is illegal to enter the ECB's premises to enforce a court order or execute a search warrant. It is also illegal to confiscate materials on the ECB's premises. The German government has a duty to protect the Central Bank against intruders, including foreign agents and protestors.

Background  Poyer was a merchant and the mayor of Pembroke town in 1642, when he asked the local MP, Sir Hugh Owen of Orielton, for help in the defence of the county. He became Governor of Pembroke Castle and raised a force on behalf of Parliament, defending the castle against the Royalist commander, Richard Vaughan, 2nd Earl of Carbery.  Rebellion  In March 1644 Poyer led a force that captured Carew Castle from the Royalists. When, in 1647, he was commanded to disband his army and surrender Pembroke Castle, he refused to do so on the grounds that he was owed money. In April 1648 he was contacted by the Prince of Wales and, with the support of other local Parliamentary commanders, Rowland Laugharne and Rice Powell, he joined a Royalist rebellion, culminating in the Battle of St Fagans. The remaining forces, besieged by Oliver Cromwell himself at Pembroke, surrendered on 11 July 1648, and Poyer, Laugharne and Powell were condemned to death. It was agreed that only one would face the firing squad, and the three men drew lots. The lots would be drawn by a child, with Poyer being the loser the child asked him \\"Did I do well?\\" Poyer responded \\"Yes, you have done very well\\". He was executed at Covent Garden, London.

Other common names are ROKŒ≤ and P160ROCK. ROCK1 is a major downstream effecter of the small GTPase RhoA and is a regulator of the actomyosin cytoskeleton which promotes contractile force generation. ROCK1 plays a role in cancer and in particular cell motility, metastasis, and angiogenesis.  Gene and expression  ROCK1 is also the name of the gene that encodes the protein ROCK1, a serine/threonine kinase. ROCK1 is activated when bound to the GTP-bound form of RhoA. The human ROCK1 gene is located on human chromosome 18 with specific location of 18q11.1. The location of the base pair starts at 18,529,703 and ends at 18,691,812 bp and translates into 1354 amino acids. ROCK1 has a ubiquitous tissue distribution, but subcellularly it is thought to colocalize with the centrosomes. This is consistent with its function as a key modulator of cell motility, tumor cell invasion, and actin cytoskeleton organization. In rats, ROCK1 is expressed in the lung, liver, spleen, kidney, and testis.  Structure and regulation  The ROCK1 structure is a serine/threonine kinase with molecular weight of 158 kDa. It is a homodimer composed of a catalytic kinase domain (residues76-338) located at the amino or N-terminus of the protein, a coiled-coil region (residues 425-1100) containing the Rho-binding domain, and a pleckstrin- homology domain (residues 1118-1317) with a cysteine-rich domain. When a substrate is absent, ROCK1 is an autoinhibited loop structure. Enzyme activity of ROCK1 is inhibited when the pleckstrin-homology and Rho-binding domains in the C-terminus independently bind to the N-terminus kinase domain. When a substrate such as GTP-bound RhoA binds to the Rho-binding region of the coiled-coil domain, the interactions between the N-terminus and the C-terminus are disrupted, thus activating the protein. Cleavage of the C-terminal inhibitory domain by caspase-3 during apoptosis can also activate the kinase. This view of autoinhibition released by RhoA binding has been challenged by low resolution electron microscopy data showing ROCK to be a constitutive linear dimer 120 nm in length. According to this new data ROCK does not need to be activated by RhoA or phosphorylation because it is always active, and whether ROCK will phosphorylate its substrates (e.g. myosin regulatory light chain) depends only on their subcellular localization. There is one other isoform of ROCK known as ROCK2. ROCK2 is located at 2p24 and is highly homologous with ROCK1 with an overall amino acid sequence identity of 65%. The identity in the Rho-binding domain is 58% and approximately 92% in the kinase domain. The ROCK isoforms are encoded by two different identified genes and are ubiquitously expressed. GTPase-RhoA binding can increase the activity of ROCK1 by 1.5-2-fold. Without RhoA binding, lipids such as arachidonic acid or sphingosine phosphorylcholine can increase ROCK1 activity 5- to 6-fold. These two lipids interact with the pleckstrin-homology domain, thus disrupting its ability to inhibit ROCK1. G-protein RhoE binds to the N-terminus of ROCK1 and inhibits its activity by preventing RhoA binding. Small G-proteins, Gem and Rad, have been shown to bind and inhibit ROCK1 function, but their mechanism of action is unclear.  Substrates and interactions  ROCK1 phosphorylation sites are at RXXS/T or RXS/T. More than 15 ROCK1 substrates have been identified and activation from these substrates most often leads to actin filament formation and cytoskeleton rearrangements. MYPT-1 is involved in a pathway for smooth muscle contraction. When ROCK1 is activated by binding of GTPase RhoA it produces multiple signaling cascades. For example, RhoA is one of the downstream signaling cascades activated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). ROCK1 acts as a negative regulator of VEGF endothelial cell activation and angiogensis. ROCK1 activation by RhoA also promotes stabilization of F-actin, phosphorylation of regulatory myosin light chain (MLC) and an increase in contractility, which plays a crucial role in tumor cell migration and metastasis. This activated ROCK1 also activates LIM kinase, which, phosphorylates cofilin, inhibiting its actin-depolymerizing activity. This depolymerization results in stabilization of actin filaments and decreased branching which promotes contraction. Cardiac troponin is another ROCK1 substrate that upon phosphorylation causes reduction in tension in cardiac myocytes. ROCK1 also acts as a suppressor of inflammatory cell migration by regulating PTEN phosphorylation and stability.  Function  ROCK1 has a diverse range of functions in the body. It is a key regulator of actin-myosin contraction, stability, and cell polarity. These contribute to many progresses such as regulation of morphology, gene transcription, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and oncogenic transformation. Other functions involve smooth muscle contraction, actin cytoskeleton organization, stress fiber and focal adhesion formation, neurite retraction, cell adhesion and motility. These functions are activated by phosphorylation of DAPK3, GFAP, LIMK1, LIMK2, MYL9/MLC2, PFN1 and PPP1R12A. Additionally, ROCK1 phosphorylates FHOD1 and acts synergistically with it to promote SRC-dependent non-apoptotic plasma membrane blebbing. It is also required for centrosome positioning and centrosome-dependent exit from mitosis.  Interactions  ROCK1 has been shown to interact with: * LIMK1, * MLC, * MYPT1, * PFN2, and * RHOA.  Clinical significance  In humans, the main function of ROCK1 is actomyosin contractility. As mentioned before, this contributes to many proximal progresses such as regulation of morphology, motility, and cell‚Äìcell and cell‚Äìmatrix adhesion. In addition, ROCK kinases influence more distal cellular processes including gene transcription, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and oncogenic transformation. Given this diverse range of functions, it is not surprising that ROCK1 has been implicated in numerous aspects of cancer. = Role in cancer = Recent studies have explored the role of ROCK1 in cancer with particular attention focused on cell motility, metastasis, and angiogenesis. Rho GTPases such as RhoA are highly involved in morphologic changes in cells. When a tumor progresses from invasive to metastatic form it requires that they undergo these dramatic morphologic changes. Therefore, increased expression of RhoA and its downstream effector ROCK1 is often observed in human cancers. These cancers are typically more invasive and metastatic phenotypes. = Angiogenesis = Increased expression of RhoA and ROCK1 in endothelial cell migration pathways can cause an increase in angiogenesis and metastatic behavior in tumor cells. It has been suggested that ROCK1 either regulates the expression of angiogenic factors or ROCK1 activation facilitates angiogenesis by increasing the plasticity of the tumor. By reducing the strength of cell-cell interactions and aiding the movement of tumor cells, ROCK1 may enable endothelial cells to penetrate the tumor mass more easily. = Breast cancer = Overexpression of ROCK1 and RhoA is often seen in breast cancer. Activated ROCK1 phosphorylates MLC involved in actin- myosin contractility. RhoA also activates focal adhesion kinase activity. Together, these two pathways create the motile and invasive phenotype of cancer cells. Breast cancers often contain regions of reduced O2 which increases the activity of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). HIFs have been shown to activate transcription of RhoA and ROCK1 leading to cytoskeletal changes that underlie the invasive cancer cell phenotype. = ROCK1 inhibitors in cancer therapy = ROCK1 inhibitors might be used in cancer therapy for: *targeting of stromal rather than tumor cells *concomitant blocking of ROCK and proteasome activity in K‚ÄêRas‚Äêdriven lung cancers *treating haematological malignancies such as chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) ROCK1 inhibition for cancer treatment has not been approved for standard therapy use. Y27632 and Fasudil are examples of ROCK1 inhibitors. Both inhibit ROCK1 by competing with ATP for the kinase activation site. Experiments with Y27632 show it is a promising candidate as a therapeutic antihypertensive agent. Fasudil has been used to characterize the role of ROCK1 in vascular function in clinical studies and has been approved for use in Japan for treatment of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage. = Other diseases = The ROCK1 signaling plays an important role in many diseases including diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and pulmonary hypertension.

Function  This gene encodes a protein similar to the RAS effector proteins. Loss or altered expression of this gene has been associated with the pathogenesis of a variety of cancers, which suggests the tumor suppressor function of this gene. The inactivation of this gene was found to be correlated with the hypermethylation of its CpG-island promoter region. The encoded protein was found to interact with DNA repair protein XPA. The protein was also shown to inhibit the accumulation of cyclin D1, and thus induce cell cycle arrest. Seven alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene encoding distinct isoforms have been reported.  Interactions  RASSF1 has been shown to interact with: * CNKSR1, * Death associated protein 6 * HRAS, * MAP1B, * MAP1S, and * RASSF5.  Pathology  Cervical cancer is known to be one of the most severe forms of cancer and is frequently associated with human papilloma virus (HPV). A few studies have been done to investigate the relationship between cervical cancers and RASSF1A, an isoform of RASSF1 that has been shown to suppress the proliferation in tumor cells. Through these studies, it was found that RASSF1A is commonly inactivated in adenocarcinomas (ACs) due to hypermethylation of the promoter region. However, this is not observed in squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the cervix, though they can be associated with HPV as well. It was found that RASSF1A was silenced in cancer cells when the promoter region was hypermethylated. It is speculated that cancer subtypes may develop due to the inverse relationship of RASSF1A and HPV. RASSF1A promoter hypermethylation and oncogenic HPV were detected in ACs, but SCCs displayed a high level of HPV DNA and no RASSF1A promoter methylation. Another study used Hela cells to study the potential therapeutic effects of RASSF1A. Hela cells are a line of cells that are derived from cervical cancer cells and are used in scientific research. When Hela cells were generated with RASSF1A expression, the growth of these cells decreased when compared to cells without RASSF1A expression. The rate of apoptosis in those cells had also increased with RASSF1A expression. Through these studies, it was indicated that RASSF1A expression could induce apoptosis and regulate proliferation to suppress tumors, making it a potential therapeutic mechanism for cervical cancers.

IKK-Œ± is part of the IŒ∫B kinase complex that plays an important role in regulating the NF-Œ∫B transcription factor. However, IKK-Œ± has many additional cellular targets, and is thought to function independently of the NF-Œ∫B pathway to regulate epidermal differentiation.  Function  = NF-Œ∫B response = IKK-Œ± is a member of the serine/threonine protein kinase family and forms a complex in the cell with IKK-Œ≤ and NEMO. NF-Œ∫B transcription factors are normally held in an inactive state by the inhibitory proteins IŒ∫Bs. IKK-Œ± and IKK-Œ≤ phosphorylate the IŒ∫B proteins, marking them for degradation via ubiquitination and allowing NF-Œ∫B transcription factors to go into the nucleus. Once activated, NF-Œ∫B transcription factors regulate genes that are implicated in many important cellular processes, including immune response, inflammation, cell death, and cell proliferation. = Epidermal differentiation = IKK-Œ± has been shown to function in epidermal differentiation independently of the NF-Œ∫B pathway. In the mouse, IKK-Œ± is required for cell cycle exit and differentiation of the embryonic keratinocytes. IKK-Œ± null mice have a truncated snout and limbs, shiny skin, and die shortly after birth due to dehydration. Their epidermis retains a proliferative precursor cell population and lacks the outer two most differentiated cell layers. This function of IKK-Œ± has been shown to be independent of the protein's kinase activity and of the NF-Œ∫B pathway. Instead it is thought that IKK-Œ± regulates skin differentiation by acting as a cofactor in the TGF-Œ≤ / Smad2/3 signaling pathway. The zebrafish homolog of IKK-Œ± has also been shown to play a role in the differentiation of the embryonic epithelium. Zebrafish embryos born from mothers that are mutant in IKK-Œ± do not produce a differentiated outer epithelial monolayer. Instead, the outermost cells in these embryos are hyperproliferative and fail to turn on critical epidermal genes. Different domains of the protein are required for this function of IKK-Œ± in zebrafish than in mice, but in neither case does the NF-Œ∫B pathway seem to be implicated. = Keratinocyte migration = IŒ∫B kinase Œ± (IKKŒ±) is a regulator of keratinocyte terminal differentiation and proliferation and plays a role in skin cancer. Activation of three major hydrogen peroxide-dependent pathways, EGF, FOXO1, and IKK-Œ± occur during injury-induced epidermal keratinocyte migration, adhesion, cytoprotection and wound healing. IKKŒ± regulates human keratinocyte migration by surveillance of the redox environment after wounding. IKK-Œ± is sulfenylated at a conserved cysteine residue in the kinase domain, which correlated with derepression of EGF promoter activity and increased EGF expression, indicating that IKK-Œ± stimulatea migration through dynamic interactions with the EGF promoter depending on the redox state within cells. = Other cellular targets = IKK-Œ± has also been reported to regulate the cell cycle protein cyclin D1 in an NF-Œ∫B-independent manner.  Clinical significance  Inhibition of IŒ∫B kinase (IKK) and IKK-related kinases, IKBKE (IKKŒµ) and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), has been investigated as a therapeutic option for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and cancer. Mutations in IKK-Œ± in humans have been linked to lethal fetal malformations. The phenotype of these mutant fetuses is similar to the mouse IKK-Œ± null phenotype, and is characterized by shiny, thickened skin and truncated limbs. Decreased IKK-Œ± activity has been reported in a large percentage of human squamous cell carcinomas, and restoring IKK-Œ± in mouse models of skin cancer has been shown to have an anti-tumorigenic effect.  Interactions  IKK-Œ± has been shown to interact with: * HDAC9, * AKT1, * AKT2, * CTNNB1, * FANCA, * IKBKG * IKK2, * IRAK1, * MAP3K14, * MAP3K7, * MAP3K8, * NFKBIA, * NCOA3, * PPM1B, * PRKDC, and * TRAF2.

It was first named by Robert R. Reisz and David W. Dilkes in 2003 and the type species is Archaeovenator hamiltonensis. Archaeovenator hamiltonensis is known from the holotype KUVP 12483, a three-dimensionally preserved, nearly complete and articulated skeleton, including the skull, with limbs and girdles slightly separated from postcranial skeleton. It was collected in the Hamilton Quarry, from the Calhouns Shale Formation of the Shawnee Group, dating to the Virgilian stage (or alternatively late Kasimovian to early Gzhelian stage) of the Late Pennsylvanian Series, about 300 million years ago. The generic name is derived from the Latin Archaeo and venator, meaning \\"ancient hunter\\". The specific name is named after its finding place Hamilton Quarry. Archaeovenator is the oldest and the basalmost known varanopid, as it is the sister taxon to all other known varanopsids.

It is a theory of aesthetics calling for artistic practise engaging with and working through the developments, evolutions and paradigms of late twentieth century communications technologies. Observing the emerging supremacy of networks over subjects, it called for an artistic approach that was both adapted to, and invested in this changing techno-social arena. Background At the occasion of Artmedia, on Video Art organized by Mario Costa, Professor of Aesthetics at the University of Salerno, Fred Forest had been invited to enact a performance and installation involving the Italian National Television Broadcaster (RAI). The ensuing encounter revealed their mutual enthusiasm and interest in the evolution of the place of art in society given then developing communications technologies. Following an evening of intense discussion they wrote and signed a manifesto with Argentinian artist Horacio Zabala acting as witness. From the next day onwards, they established a list of artists whose practises reflected the artistic movement they had thus established. As a result, Roy Ascott, Antoni Muntadas, St√©phan Barron, Marc Denjean, Natan Karczmar, Jean-Claude Anglade, Mit Mitropoulos, Christian Sevette, Robert X Adrian, Jean-Marc Philippe, Wolfgang Ziemer Chrobatzek, Tom Klinkowstein, Eric Gidney, Ugo la Petria, Horacio Zabala, Daniel Dewaele and Piotr Kowalski expressed their alignment with the informal international group. Derrick de Kerckhove, director of the Marshall McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology at the University of Toronto, in direct communication with Fred Forest and Mario Costa, then set up a Canadian group titled ‚ÄúStrategic Arts‚Äù responding to the same concepts and objectives and in which Norman White was involved. Communication Aesthetics is currently intact, though for geographical reasons it is today broken up into three distinct spheres of thought, action and intercession: * Mario Costa holds positions and furthers action within the universities of Salerno and Naples in Italy * while Fred Forest is active in France as professor at the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis and currently the National Art School of Cergy, Sorbonne Paris 1 * and Derrick de Kerckhove upholds the North American connection as Director of the Marshall McLuhan programme at the University of Toronto. Theory In an article first published in French in 1985 and available online in English, Fred Forest outlines the purpose of Communication Aesthetics: ‚ÄúElectrical, electronic and computer technology have now brought us firmly into communication society. This technology is at the heart of changes tha that have come about in social reorganization over a century, thus modifying not only our physical environment but also our mental system of representation. Electricity, electronics and computers today provide artists with new instruments of creation. The way our surroundings are being transformed in this direction a little more each day, together with our continually evolving adjustment with an ever-changing reality, is doubtless what is most important. This is why we must constantly reconsider our perceptions in order to apprehend the world in which we live.‚ÄùIbid. In short, Communication Aesthetics claims that a concomitant evolution in technologies of communication and strategies in art would have democratized (and thus demystified) the means of artistic production thus replacing the purpose of art as material production with the purpose of art as social interaction: ‚Äúthe artist now intervenes directly on reality, that is to say the carries out his symbolic and aesthetic activity using different means from those he has used up to now.‚Äù But Communication Aesthetics pushing this position further, by calling for an interactive intervention on reality, one that plays with the spectator in both meanings of the phrase. This play is in turn a form of power play as it questions the labelling and limitations of figures of authority. The political ramifications of Communication Aesthetics are openly acknowledged by the founders, indeed they are called for: ‚ÄúIn turn, the artist becomes a \\" social operative \\", he becomes a social performer. The scaling down and the provocation of power, and its recuperation as a form of play, belong to the field of art. The responsible artist knows this power as his, and confronts the surrounding world with it.‚Äù The socio-political position-taking goes further still, as the artists call for the recognition of the formative as well as informative nature of technology, and particularly information technologies: ‚ÄúIt must be admitted once and for all that the history and genesis of the configurations of the imaginary are indelibly engraved in the \\"technologies\\" upon which our perception is utterly dependent - and thus today engraved in the \\"technologies\\" of communication.‚Äù It is this analysis of the formal and functional aspects of communication that Communication Aesthetics calls for. Communication Aesthetics pushes the psycho-physiological implications of technological innovations further still, elaborating on their concomitant modification of our concepts of Space and Time. Just as the auto mobile changed our approach and experience of home and locality, so too Communication Aesthetics posited that IT innovations would change our approach to human interaction. ‚ÄúThe hooking-up of computers to each other, and also to other machines, is a fore-runner of the opening out of the telecommunications network and the abolition of certain constraints of distance.‚Äù And, once again, it is for the artist to understand and harness these modifications and constraints so as to engage with these evolutions in the name of communication: ‚ÄúWe can but remark that all these transformations brought about by media systems are, without our knowing it, reorganising our whole system of aesthetic representation.‚Äù Lastly, Communication Aesthetics engages with another more problematic implication of technological innovations, the increasing intangibility of perception and sensuality resulting from the rise of the virtual. Indeed, far from encouraging this lapse into asociality or asensuality, Communication Aesthetics seeks to frame these emerging problems rather than shy away from them. Once again, Communication Aesthetics seeks to lay claim to societal relevance and influence by allying communications innovations and artistic innovations on the levels both formally and functionally. \\"The goal of Communication artists is certainly not to produce first level meanings, but above all to make us aware as to how, in the end, the generalised practice of Communication interreacts on the whole of our sensory system. This evolution is about to put into place the data for a \\" new awareness \\" at the edge of our perception, and then, along with new \\" ways of feeling \\", it will open up new aesthetic paths.\\" Examples * 1972 \\" Talk out\\", Douglas Davis, Everson Museum, Syracuse * 1973 \\"Arch√©ologie √©lectronique du pr√©sent\\", Fred Forest, Galerie Germain, Paris * 1974 \\"Manhattan is an Island\\", Ira Schneider * 1975 \\"Teleshock/Telexchange\\", Fred Forest TV France 2 * 1975-1977 \\"Aesthetic Research in Telecommunications: Satellite Arts Project\\", Kit Galloway and Sherry Rabinowitz, NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Maryland and the Educational Television Center, Menlo Park, CaliforniaLoeffler, Carl Eugene, and Roy Ascott. \\"Chronology and working survey of select telecommunications activity.\\" Leonardo (1991): 236-240. * 1977 \\" Satellite Telecast\\", Douglas Davis.

He was the father of diplomat John H. Holdridge and the adoptive father of actress Cheryl Holdridge. Biography =Early life= Holdridge was born Herbert Charles Heitke on March 6, 1892, in Wyandotte, Michigan. His parents were German immigrants Emil Heitke and Ida Petzke, who came to the United States in 1881. Herbert Heitke grew up on the family farm, along with his four brothers and three sisters. He was able to secure an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, and graduated with the class of 1917. While at West Point, he legally changed his surname to \\"Holdridge\\", a move precipitated by the rising anti-German sentiment in America during its entry into World War I. Upon graduation, he married Marie Gunther (1896‚Äì1981), a New York factory worker's daughter. =Military career= Holdridge was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the U.S. Army in 1917, and assigned to the Quartermaster Corps of the Army's Reserve (II Corps) at Camp Gordon, Georgia. He was promoted to First Lieutenant by 1920, and made Captain two years later, at which time he was assigned to duty with Headquarters Army Trains, with the First United States Army in New York City.The New York Times, \\"Reserve Corps Orders\\", July 12, 1922, pg 22 This move reunited him with his wife, who had remained behind in New York after his posting to Georgia, and led to the birth in 1924 of their only child, John H. Holdridge. By 1925 Holdridge had transferred to the Cavalry, while still assigned to the Reserve Corps in New York.The New York Times, \\"Army Orders and Assignments\\", March 28, 1925, pg 31 He was later appointed as Assistant Professor of History and Social Sciences at West Point, and also taught summer sessions at Columbia University during 1928.The New York Times, \\"Columbia Expects 15,000 for Summer\\", March 25, 1928, pg 19 Before 1930, Holdridge had been transferred to the Army's Cavalry School at Fort Riley, Kansas, his wife and son this time accompanying him.US 1930 Census for Kansas Holdridge would remain with Training Commands for the rest of his Army career. He was promoted to Colonel and headed the Plans Training Division of the Adjutant General's Department at the onset of World War II, and was assigned as Commandant of the Adjutant General School at Fort Washington, Maryland, on January 19, 1942. He also became Director, Schools Training, Army Administration Schools, and was promoted to Brigadier General in early 1942. In this position Holdridge was responsible for implementing the opening of Officer Candidate Schools at colleges around the country, to provide twelve- week courses of instruction for the massive increase in the US Army's officer corps during 1942-1944. Holdridge saw that many of these schools were opened at smaller public and private colleges and universities that had been hard hit by loss of students to military service, helping to ensure their financial viability during the war years. For his efforts, he was awarded a Doctor of Laws degree by Grinnell College on January 24, 1943. =Controversy= In May 1944, Holdridge became the only US general officer to retire during the country's greatest military conflict. The reasons for this early retirement are not known. Speculation has centered on his later political actions; among his relatives it was rumored that he was denied permission to publish a book of economic theories and chose to retire. However, it is also possible that events in his personal life (see below) may have led to his early retirement. =Political career= Within six months of having retired, Holdridge gave a speech at a Socialist Party meeting in New York City, decrying the ideas of the two presidential contenders, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Thomas E. Dewey. Holdridge was quoted as saying: > In electing Dewey, instead of Roosevelt, you don't change horses in the > middle of the stream, you merely change jockeys of the same old capitalistic > horse, both competing for the privilege of leading the country into > Fascism.The New York Times, \\"Socialist Assails Both\\", October 21, 1944, pg 9 Unexpected as this opinion might be coming from a recently retired general, it at least expressed a fairly orthodox Socialist position. From this point on, however, Holdridge's public statements would become increasingly unorthodox and inconsistent, reflecting no coherent ideological basis. Opposition to mental health reform and the Roman Catholic Church, commitment to pacifism, and championship of returning Native American tribes to government by traditional chieftains, were among the few positions that he did hold consistently over the years. 1948 presidential election Notwithstanding his support for the Socialist ticket in 1944, Holdridge put himself forth as a candidate for the Democratic Party presidential nomination in 1948. His candidacy was brought to an abrupt halt over a lawsuit Holdridge filed against then Representative John E. Rankin (D) of Mississippi. Holdridge filed for defamation of character, claiming Rankin had slandered him in comments made to a reporter in a Congressional cloakroom during 1946. A Federal District judge ruled against Holdridge, saying that such a conversation, in person, and within the Capitol building, was immune to lawsuit.The New York Times, \\"Congressional Immunity is Established in Rankin Suit\\", June 9, 1948, pg 31 1952 presidential election In February 1952 Holdridge was selected as the provisional presidential candidate for the \\"American Rally for Peace, Abundance and the Constitution\\" AKA the American Rally Party, a splinter group that was seeking to take-over the Democratic nominating convention later that summer.The New York Times, \\"American Rally Opens Drive\\", February 26, 1952, pg 16 Three months later, Holdridge was also lobbying to be selected as the candidate for President on the American Vegetarian Party ticket. Holdridge, as reported in the press, promised: > In the White House, I would obtain the best vegetarian chef in the country > to cook such delicious vegetarian meals that guests would wonder why they > ever thought meat edible.The New York Times, \\"Multi-Party System\\", June 15, > 1952, pg SM58 At the Democratic Convention in July 1952, Holdridge, now a California resident, sought to contest that state's pledging of delegates to Estes Kefauver. His attempt to replace twenty of the Kefauver delegates with his own Rally group was turned aside, the convention perhaps being alarmed by Holdridge's pledge to elevate the Department of Commerce to a branch of government in itself, equal to the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.The New York Times, \\"Kefauver Pitches Coonskin Cap\\", July 18, 1952, pg 8 The American Vegetarian Party also rejected Holdridge, instead nominating Daniel J. Murphy for President in 1952. 1956 presidential election Embittered by his double rejection, Holdridge himself resigned from the American Rally on November 5, 1952, claiming that it was being devoted to \\"Marxist principles\\". He returned to California and started \\"The Holdridge Foundation\\" out of his home in Sherman Oaks. In 1953, he used donations to it to publish his book of political allegory, The Fables of Moronia. Later that year, he announced to reporters that he wanted to talk to American GIs held by the North Koreans, who had refused repatriation, and that he had written to his old classmate, then President Dwight D. Eisenhower, about it.The New York Times, \\"General Wants to Confer With G.I.'s Held By Reds\\", October 19, 1953, pg 3 This was one of the earliest of what would soon become a Holdridge trademark event; writing a public letter to a well-known figure about a controversial issue, then calling a press conference about it. In 1955, Holdridge again sought a nomination, this time as a vice-presidential candidate for the Prohibition Party.The New York Times, \\"Prohibition Slate Set\\", September 8, 1955, pg 26 Placed on the ticket in September 1955, with law professor Enoch A. Holtwick as the nominee for president, Holdridge was replaced in August 1956 by Edwin M. Cooper, after Holdridge distributed virulently anti-Eisenhower pamphlets on the floor of the Republican Party nominating convention.The New York Times, \\"Only Three Questions Left\\", August 20, 1956, pg 8 Holdridge punctuated his non-election year with a fracas at a House Un-American Activities Committee hearing held in Los Angeles on December 7, 1956. Representative Clyde Doyle, a California Democrat, had Holdridge ejected from the building by a Federal Marshal after the two exchanged heated personal insults during the hearing.The New York Times, \\"Inquiry on Reds Ejects General\\", December 8, 1956, pg 12 =Later life= Despite having failed to secure a presidential nomination from even minor national parties in three different elections over a dozen years, Holdridge would always claim to have been nominated by the Vegetarians and the Prohibitionists, an achievement of such ephemeral value that no reporter ever questioned it. After 1956 he never again sought a nomination from established political parties. Instead, he devoted his efforts to nascent movements designed to empower American Indians, and to anti-Catholic propaganda against the 1960 presidential campaign of John F. Kennedy.The New York Times, \\"Democrats List 5 as Extremists\\", September 16, 1960, pg 14 Holdridge founded the \\"Minute Men for the Constitution\\" in 1957, which published two newsletters but did little else. In 1960 he established the \\"Constitutional Provisional Government of the United States\\", which claimed the Hopi Indians were still a sovereign nation, since they had never signed a peace treaty with the United States. Holdridge apparently appointed himself to represent the Hopi in this matter, without actually attracting any members of that tribe to his organization. Holdridge and his first wife Marie had divorced in the 1940s. He then married a former dancer named Julie Phelps (19 October 1908 ‚Äì 24 October 2003), and adopted her daughter Cheryl. His political activities and incessant writing of public letters to newspapers and elected officials would prove a minor embarrassment to his stepdaughter's acting career.Forever Hold Your Banner High, by Jerry Bowles, 1976, pg 61 Meanwhile, his son, John H. Holdridge, pursued a diplomatic career. By the early 1960s Holdridge had become estranged from his second wife and their daughter. Holdridge was not invited to the latter's wedding to Woolworth heir Lance Reventlow in November 1964, and shortly thereafter, moved to Toledo, Ohio. His principal occupation during the last years of his life was in attempting to keep alive his Hopi government project, which was rendered futile by his inability to attract either funding or supporters. Holdridge died at the Veteran's Administration Hospital in Brecksville, Ohio, on September 29, 1974. References Further reading *The Fables of Moronia, by Herbert C.

It was announced on 2 October 2007, and released that same year on Q4 in three colors: red, teal, and navy (blue). The phone is a music player when closed, and can be swiveled for use of the mobile phone. It also has a VGA-resolution camera with a special \\"night shot\\" mode for taking photos in low-light conditions. The official song for this phone is \\"Juke Box Hero\\" by Foreigner. But on the commercial, it was misspelled \\"Jukebox Hero\\". In Europe, the phone is known as the F210, and is sold under T-Mobile UK and O2 Telecom. In Australia, it was mistakenly titled the Jukebox, until executives clarified the error. Features The basic features of the handset beyond call functionality include an alarm clock, a calculator with tip calculations and unit/currency converter, calendar, stopwatch, world clock, and notepad. The phone allows creating an In Case of Emergency (ICE) contact list for emergency access when the device is locked. The user interface of the Verizon device only has English and Spanish display languages. =Storage= The Juke includes 2 GB of internal flash memory, of which up to 22 Mb is available for pictures, ringtones, and sounds, while 1.87 GB is dedicated storage for music only. The phone does not have a microSD card slot, therefore users cannot expand storage beyond what's available. =Phone and media management= Over-the-air V CAST music downloads are not available. The handset does rely on V CAST Music Manager software to transfer music to the phone, and that program only supports Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows Media Player 10, but not Mac OS X or any other operating systems. The phone is alternately accessible with BitPim, an open source and multi-platform application to access CDMA phones of various cellphone manufacturers. =Music player= The device's audio player supports MP3, Windows Media Audio (WMA and WMA Pro), and Advanced Audio Coding (AAC and AAC+) file types by default, instead of converting all formats to the WMA format, like most other V CAST phones require. Music player features include an equalizer and 3D sound settings, playlist creation and music playback by artist, genre, and album. The music player's UI skin can show a visualizer, album artwork or lyrics. When in use, the music player can mostly work in the background; it pauses for phone calls, but stops for outgoing calls, at app launch, and at music synchronization. =Messaging= In addition to text messaging (SMS), the device also utilizes picture messaging, which among other things allows saving received pictures and audio, including setting the latter up as ringtones. The phone supports sending and receiving e-mail. The handset also includes Mobile Instant Messaging, which uses data calls, and supports AOL Instant Messenger, Windows Live Messenger, and Yahoo! Messenger. It is not known whether any of these protocols are still supported as of 2014; for example, Microsoft is migrating its users from Windows Live Messenger to Skype. Mobile instant messages are charged per Verizon's text messaging plan. Operator-dependent features The phone relies on Verizon's Get It Now application and service for users to buy and download ringtones, images, games, and apps. The service and some applications use datacalls, such as Wikimobile. This could be confused as the Internet, although there appears to be no actual mobile Internet connectivity. GPS functionality can be enabled through a download via Get It Now, and the location chip must be turned on for use. The phone supports what the manufacturer and operator term as advanced voice encryption (the device contains software from RSA). These functions are exclusive to Verizon Wireless.

The ship entered service in 1945 and had a brief, quiet career before being decommissioned in 1957 after her modernisation was cancelled. She was broken up in 1960. Design and description Superb was the last of the Minotaurs to be built, and was completed to a slightly different design to that of the previous members of the class, with a foot more beam than her immediate predecessor , which had introduced Type 274 lock and follow radar directors for surface action. With Superb the first Type 275 sets, modified versions of the lock and follow radar, were introduced to also control anti-aircraft fire of the twin 4-inch mounts. Unfortunately the versions of 275 fitted were the British glasshouse director version, which had higher tolerances and less reliability than the American versions of the set, which were reserved for the latter s and aircraft carriers and under construction and in particular the last battleship, for its secondary armament. Construction on her unfinished sister ships was halted after the end of the war and they were later scrapped, or converted into the new automatic gun cruiser. Superb herself was planned to be converted to full automatic 6-inch and 3-inch/70 gun Tiger specifications and would have been much more suitable for such modernisation than the narrower beam Swifsure. The plans to modernise Superb at the time of the 1957 Defence Review were much more cost constricted and would have been similar to the limited modernisation of ,N. Freidman.

She was approved for disposal 2 years later and arrived at the Dalmuir yards of Arnott Young on 8 August 1960 to be scrapped. Although Superb was the latest of the line of 6-inch gun cruisers to be completed, (the 1943 Minotaur class followed directly from the 1938 Colony and 1936 Town classes), she was also one of the first of this type to be broken up. Plans for her modernisation were abandoned after the 1957 defense review. No more cruiser modernizations were approved, with new guided missile ships to take precedence.

It is a sequel to the Shaw Brothers previous film, Rape of the Sword. Plot The three Gan sisters are mourning the death of their father when they are visited by Prince Lu Tien Hsia, who wishes to pay his respects. Lu informs the sisters that their father's sword, the Purple Light Sword, should be offered to the Emperor. At that moment, the sisters' cousin, Hsu, arrives and warns them that Lu's real intentions are to steal the sword for himself and that Lu and his father had plotted to kill the Gan's sister's father. A battle breaks out and Lu escapes without the sword. Concerned that Lu will return to try and retake the sword, the Second Gan sister leaves to seek help from her Uncle, Hsu's father. Lu, bloodied and exhausted from the battle stumbles into a run-down and seemingly abandoned temple, where he encounters the Five Tiger; Brave Tiger, One-eyed Tiger, Crippled Tiger, Drunken Tiger and Sick Tiger. After a short battle, Lu convinces the Five Tigers that he knows a place filled with money, jewels and the Purple Light Sword, if they're brave enough to attack it; The Gan residence. Lu, the Five Tigers and a band of warriors attack the Gan residence. During the battle, Lu instructs some of the warriors to burn the residence down. Hsu evacuates the injured Third Gan sister but, by the time he returns, the battle is over and the Eldest Gan sister has been taken prisoner by the Five Tigers, along with the Purple Light Sword. The attackers celebrate their victory at an Inn. While distracted by the celebrations, Lu attempts to double-cross the Five Tigers and take the Purple Light Sword, which Brave Tiger had claimed for his own. A battle occurs between the Lu and his warriors, and the Five Tigers. The warriors are defeated and Lu is taken captive by the Tigers, although Brave Tiger is injured by a poisoned dart in the process. One of the warriors is sent to Lu's father to request a ransom while the remainder are brutally slaughtered. The Second Gan sister, her uncle and a band of warriors arrive at the remains of the Gan residence and agree to set out to track Lu and his father down. Meanwhile, Hsu and the Third Gan sister arrive at a nearby town, whose streets are abandoned. They seek out a doctor to treat the Third Gan sister's injury. They learn that the doctor is also being forced by Brave Tiger to treat his wound from the poisoned dart. After treating her wound and allowing her time to rest, Hsu and the doctor come up with a plan to steal back the Purple Light Sword from Brave Tiger. The Second Gan sister finds Lu's father and battles her way into his room. Lu's father informs her that Lu and the Purple Light Sword have been taken by the Five Tigers and asks her to rescue him. She kills him instead as revenge for her father's death and leaves to track down Lu and the Five Tigers. Back at the Five Tigers' camp, the doctor distracts Brave Tiger while Hsu attempts to steal the Sword. However, Second Sister, who has also stumbled upon the camp, accidentally foils Hsu's attempt to take the sword, and as a result, Brave Tiger kills the doctor for his subterfuge. The pair team up and fight the Tiger Five and their men, managing to kill Drunken Tiger, before getting captured when Brave Tiger orders them to surrender or he'll kill the captured Eldest Gan sister. One-eyed Tiger goes to the doctor's residence, where the Third Gan sister is recovering, realising that's where she'd be, if the doctor was helping them. As One-eyed Tiger and the Third Gan sister fight, an elderly Taoist priest arrives at the door and kills One-eyed Tiger before capturing the Third Gan sister and taking her to the Five Tiger's camp. At the camp, the Taoist priest is revealed to be Lu's master and he frees Lu and the pair begin battling the camp. The sisters and Hsu manage to break free and join in the fighting. The remaining Tigers are defeated by the Taoist priest. The sisters' uncle arrives with reinforcements, who proceed to burn the camp down. The Taoist priest meets up with the Gan sisters, Hsu and his father and informs them that he was preparing to kill Lu for bring shame and dishonoring his teachings of doing good and helping the weak and the poor. Instead he hands over the Purple Light Sword and Lu to the sisters so they may get their justice. Lu runs into the fire and dies rather than face his fate.

It was released in 1983, and was the second album Mink DeVille recorded for Atlantic Records, and Atlantic brought in two in-house producers, Howard Albert and Ron Albert, to produce the album. Mink DeVille as a rock group had effectively ceased to exist as a band; only lead singer Willy DeVille remained from the original band. For this album, Willy DeVille reached deeper into his Latin roots, even recording a salsa number, \\"Demasiado Corazon.\\" A single, ‚ÄúEach Word‚Äôs a Beat of My Heart,‚Äù reached number 89 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts. Two percussionists from the Latin dance/disco band Foxy, Richie Puente and Joe Galdo, played on the album. A recording of \\"Stand by Me\\" was made at this session and released on a 7-inch single along with ‚ÄúDemasiado Corazon‚Äù and ‚ÄúAre You Lonely Tonight?‚Äù Reviews Trouser Press said about the album, ‚ÄúThis uncluttered and uncomplicated tribute to DeVille's chosen forebears -- Sam Cooke, Phil Spector, the Drifters, Joe Tex, James Brown -- also includes forays into Spanish Harlem and other wondrously nostalgic time warps.

Other information Boris Kinberg, a percussionist in The Mink DeVille Band, considered \\"Lilly's Daddy's Cadillac\\" one of the best songs Willy DeVille ever wrote. \\"It's a brilliant song. It‚Äôs a mini-film. In a three-minute song you have an hour and a half movie. It‚Äôs about drug deal gone bad.\\"See interviews on the Live in the Lowlands DVD (2006; Eagle Rock). Background singers Margaret Reynolds and Beverly Champion had sung with KC and the Sunshine Band and in 1985 would, under the name Margaret Reynolds and Girlfriends, record the Dubwise 12-inch single \\"Three Steps from True Love.\\" Willy DeVille recorded \\"The Moonlight Let Me Down\\" a second time in 1996 for a CD single. The single included a radio version and extended version of the song as well as \\"Ballad of the Hoodlum Priest\\" (from DeVille's Loup Garou). The album‚Äôs title comes from the Johnny Mercer song ‚ÄúFools Rush In (Where Angels Fear to Tread),‚Äù not from the novel by that title written by E. M. Forster.

Together, Ku70 and Ku80 make up the Ku heterodimer, which binds to DNA double-strand break ends and is required for the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway of DNA repair. It is also required for V(D)J recombination, which utilizes the NHEJ pathway to promote antigen diversity in the mammalian immune system. In addition to its role in NHEJ, Ku is required for telomere length maintenance and subtelomeric gene silencing. Ku was originally identified when patients with systemic lupus erythematosus were found to have high levels of autoantibodies to the protein.  Nomenclature  Ku80 has been referred to by several names including: * Lupus Ku autoantigen protein p80 * ATP-dependent DNA helicase 2 subunit 2 * X-ray repair complementing defective repair in Chinese hamster cells 5 * X-ray repair cross-complementing 5 (XRCC5)  Epigenetic repression  The protein expression level of Ku80 can be repressed by epigenetic hypermethylation of the promoter region of gene XRCC5 which encodes Ku80. In a study of 87 matched pairs of primary tumors of non-small- cell lung carcinoma and nearby normal lung tissue, 25% of the tumors had loss of heterozygosity at the XRCC5 locus and a similar percentage of tumors had hypermethylation of the promoter region of XRCC5. Low protein expression of Ku80 was significantly associated with low mRNA expression and with XRCC5 promoter hypermethylation but not with LOH of the gene.  Senescence  Mouse mutants with homozygous defects in Ku80 experience an early onset of senescence. Ku80(-/-) mice exhibit aging-related pathology (osteopenia, atrophic skin, hepatocellular degeneration, hepatocellular inclusions, hepatic hyperplastic foci and age-specific mortality). Furthermore, Ku80(-/-) mice exhibit severely reduced lifespan and size. Loss of only a single Ku80 allele in Ku(-/+) heterozygous mice causes accelerated aging in skeletal muscle, although post natal growth is normal. An analysis of the level of Ku80 protein in human, cow, and mouse indicated that Ku80 levels vary dramatically between species, and that these levels are strongly correlated with species longevity. These results suggest that the NHEJ pathway of DNA repair mediated by Ku80 plays a significant role in repairing double-strand breaks that would otherwise cause early senescence (see DNA damage theory of aging).  Clinical significance  A rare microsatellite polymorphism in this gene is associated with cancer in patients of varying radiosensitivity. = Deficiency in cancer = A deficiency in expression of a DNA repair gene increases the risk for cancer (see Deficient DNA repair in carcinogenesis). Ku80 protein expression was found to be deficient in melanoma. In addition, low expression of Ku80 was found in 15% of adenocarcinoma type and 32% of squamous cell type non-small cell lung cancers, and this was correlated with hypermethylation of the XRCC5 promoter. Ku80 appears to be one of 26 different DNA repair proteins that are epigenetically repressed in various cancers (see Cancer epigenetics).  Interactions  Ku80 has been shown to interact with: * DNA-PKcs, * GCN5L2, * Ku70, * NCOA6, * PCNA, * POU2F1, * TERF2IP, * Telomerase reverse transcriptase, * Tyrosine kinase 2, and * Werner syndrome ATP-dependent helicase.
