Moffat studied painting in New York and in Paris before exhibiting his work in New York during World War I. He married the actress and poet Iris Tree, and the couple moved to London after the war, where Moffat took up abstract photography. He collaborated with Man Ray and Cecil Beaton on numerous occasions throughout his career. He opened a photographic studio in London in 1925. Four years later, he opened an interior design showroom and gallery, displaying a combination of modern, antique and African tribal furnishings. His home became a popular salon for artists, intellectuals and gourmands. He moved back to America in 1939 with his second wife, settling on Martha's Vineyard, where he continued to paint. Early years Moffat was born in Brooklyn in 1887 into a wealthy New York City family, the son of Edwin Curtis Moffat Sr. (1853‚Äì1931) and Aline Adelaide Graves.Genealogy of the Moffat Family Moffat moved to Brittany, France with his parents at an early age before being educated at St. Mark's School in the U.S.Curtis Moffat biography at the Victoria & Albert Museum website After a brief diplomatic career early in the new century, he studied painting in New York and was part of a group of artists including George Bellows, Robert Henri and John French Sloan. In 1913‚Äì1914, he studied at the Beaux arts in Paris. One man shows of his work were held in New York in 1916 and 1919. In 1916, he married actress- poet Iris Tree, the daughter of actor-manager Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree, in New York. A son, Ivan, born in Cuba in 1918, became a screenwriter.Ivan Moffat biography at the Internet Movie Database After World War I ended, Moffat and his wife settled in London, and he became interested in photography. In 1923 he went to Paris where he was involved with the Surrealists and the Dada movement. He collaborated with Man Ray, with whom he developed \\"painting with light\\" 'Rayogram' compositions and other experimental techniques.Curtis Moffat at the Factum Arte website In 1925 he opened a photographic studio with Olivia Wyndham in London called the \\"M Studio\\". His large and striking black and white portraits of friends such as the Sitwells, Lady Diana Cooper, Augustus John and Nancy Cunard influenced Cecil Beaton,Curtis Moffat related photographers: Cecil Beaton Victoria & Albert Museum website among others. Two exhibitions of his photographs were held in London in 1925 and 1926. No 4 Fitzroy Square, London (2015), Formerly the gallery of Curtis Moffat Ltd. Interior design In 1929, financed by the American millionaire Jock Whitney, he opened a gallery, Curtis Moffat Ltd., at 4 Fitzroy Square in London.Ivan Moffat's obituary, The Daily Telegraph, August 3, 2002. Two adjoining houses were converted into showrooms with a flat above designed by the architect Frederick Etchells. The showrooms combined modern interior design and lighting with one of the first major collections of African tribal sculpture in London. Objects for sale ranged from 16th century antiques to rugs by Edward McKnight Kauffer and Marion Dorn, and modern china, silver and glass. The insides of the cupboard doors were painted by Francis Wyndham. Moffat undertook interior design commissions, often collaborating with John Duncan Miller. In 1930 one of the rooms was converted to a picture gallery and run by Freddie Mayor. Opening with a show of work by Augustus John, Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant among others, its last show, \\"Since Cezanne\\", featured artists such as Picasso, Matisse and Modigliani. In 1933, due to the Great Depression, financial backing was withdrawn and the gallery closed. Later years Moffat continued to live and work at Fitzroy Square. He and Iris Tree had been divorced in 1932. He returned to portrait photography and also undertook commercial colour photography. He began experimenting with the complex and delicate carbro three colour process. A one-man show of his colour photographs, \\"Still Lifes and Compositions with Light\\", was held at the Mayor Gallery in 1925. His work was included in the Museum of Modern Art exhibition \\"Photography 1839‚Äì1937\\". On 16 April 1936 in London, he married Kathleen Allan, who had worked with him for some years in his studio. The couple had a daughter, Penelope, in 1938. Moffat's original and eclectic taste in art and design also extended into the area of gastronomy. He was an early member of the Wine and Food Society and the Saintsbury Club, and a close friend of Andr√© Simon. His table was famous for its wine and food, the choice of the latter being governed by his selection of the former, according to his son, Ivan. His large house in Fitzroy Square, perhaps the first and most original of the so- called modern interiors of the late Twenties and early Thirties, was the meeting place for many of the celebrated painters, writers, critics and designers of the day. Early in 1939, Moffat returned to New York where he held a one-man show of his paintings. He and his family then settled on Martha's Vineyard in 1940, where he continued to paint until he died in 1949 in Edgartown, Massachusetts, on the Vineyard. His photographic archive and papers relating to his gallery, Curtis Moffat Ltd., are held and exhibited in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

It is a simple red brick Georgian building with flint footings and a hipped roof of slate. In 1884 Sunday school room was built at the back of the chapel. In the early years services were conducted by visiting ministers or licensed lay preachers, but in 1955 a wealthy local farmer, who had been a lifelong strong supporter, bequeathed a large piece of land opposite the chapel and on this houses were built. The resulting finance enabled a house to be built for the Minister and for chapel modernisation, including modern heating and an extension built in 1956 that includes a kitchen and toilets. A trust was also established and this still provides for the upkeep of the exterior of both buildings. In 1978 Padre Bernard Railton Bax took over the ministry. His work was continued, after his death in 1990, by Rev John Harrington and his wife Nina. Mrs Harrington died in 1996 and Rev Harrington retired at the age of 87, after 13 years of service. The chapel has always been independent, but it has neighbourly links with the local Church of England parish church of St John the Evangelist. There was once a move to integrate with the Congregational Church, but the plan did not materialise. The chapel has an ecumenical attitude and residential Ministers in recent years have included those from various church traditions, including Baptist, Church of the Nazarene and several from a United Reformed Church background. In June 2015 an outdoor service was held, attended by many villagers, to celebrate the chapel's bicentenary. The congregation sat in a marquee in the chapel grounds and sang hymns with accompaniment from the Reading Central Salvation Army brass band. Rev David and Rev Sonya Jackson gave readings and led prayers, as did Rev Kevin Davies, the minister for Henley deanery. The service was followed by a village picnic. A celebration cake was cut by 95-year-old Ken Jago, the oldest member of the congregation. =Ministers= * 1959‚Äì65: Pastor Ernest Dickerson * 1967‚Äì72: Rev John Potts * 1973‚Äì75: Rev Arthur Tilling * 1977‚Äì90: Rev Padre Bernard Railton Bax * 1990‚Äì2004: Rev John Harrington * 2004‚Äì10: Rev David Holmwood * 2010‚Äì16: Revs David and Sonia Jackson * 2016‚Äì present: Rev Mark Taylor Maharajah's Well The Maharajah's Well, with Well Cottage behind the hedge on the right Maharajah's well cupola with wording \\"His Highness the Maharajah of Benares\\" Maharajah's Well - golden elephant inside Edward Anderton Reade, the local squire at Ipsden, had worked with the Maharajah of Benares in India in the mid-nineteenth century. Under Reade's leadership, a well was sunk in 1831 to aid the community in Azamgarh. Reade left the area in 1860, and after his departure, the Maharajah decided to make a contribution to Reade's home area in England. Recalling Reade's help in creating the Azimgurgh well in 1831 and his stories of water deprivation in his home area of Ipsden the Maharajah commissioned the well at Stoke Row and it was sunk in 1863. The Wallingford firm of RJ and H Wilder made the well mechanism in 1863 and completed the pavilion over the well in 1864. The pavilion is open-sided with a cupola on top and a golden-coloured elephant above the well mechanism. The well and pavilion can be seen in a small park on the north side of the main road through Stoke Row village. Amenities The Cherry Tree Inn The village has two 17th-century pubs: the Cherry Tree Inn, a Brakspear tied houseCherry Tree Inn and the Crooked Billet a free house.The Crooked Billet Built in 1642 the pub is reputed to have once been the hideout of highwayman Dick Turpin, who was said to have been romantically attached to the landlord's daughter, Bess. It was England's first gastropub and was the venue for Titanic star Kate Winslet's wedding reception. In June 1989 the British progressive rock band Marillion played its first performance with Steve Hogarth as frontman at the pub; a documentary DVD called From Stoke Row To Ipanema ‚Äì A Year In The Life was subsequently produced. The Crooked Billet pub In the 1851 Census the head of the household at No 1 Stoke Row was George Hope, who built \\"The Hope\\" public house. This was later called \\"The Farmer\\" and today is Hope House, at the junction of Main Street with Nottwood Lane.

Shaw Jeffrey taught at a variety of schools before spending sixteen years as headmaster at Colchester Royal Grammar School. With his wife, Alice, he retired first to South Africa, then to the town of Whitby, North Yorkshire, in 1916, where he spent his time between numerous trips to countries around the world. Early life Percy Shaw Jeffrey grew up with his parents, Thomas Ashby Jeffrey, a chemist, and Mary Helen Jeffrey (n√©e Sparrow), in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, and with his younger siblings Ada Constance, Russell Henry, Ethel Maude and Amy Louise. For three years from 1875, he attended Trent College, Long Eaton, where he rose to become \\"Head of the School, proxime accessit [runner up] for the Duke of Devonshire's Gold Medal, with first-class honours in the Cambridge Local, third in the list in Latin and distinguished in French\\". Early teaching career Whilst reading for a maths scholarship at the University of Marburg, Shaw Jeffrey was offered the chance to work at Trent College, unofficially, as first the headmaster's private secretary, and then as a teacher. Unfortunately, he was unable to win the Marburg scholarship in 1881, and, left unemployed after the death of the Headmaster the year after, he took up a post as a junior master at Emanuel School, Wandsworth, soon after its move to new premises. On 30 January 1884, he matriculated into the University of Oxford as a member of The Queen's College, where he completed a Bachelor of Arts in 1887 and was granted his MA in 1890. He was disappointed to receive a degree with only third-class honours, however, and was advised to put any ambition of teaching on hold‚Äîadvice which he did not follow. After a brief spell teaching at Christ's College, Finchley, for six months during 1887, Shaw Jeffrey became an assistant mathematics and science master at The Skinners' School, Royal Tunbridge Wells, whilst simultaneously studying for an Inter Bachelor of Science, with first class honours. Whilst at Skinners' he published words he had written for the school song, set to music by Cuthbert H. Cronk, which persist to the present day.\\"The Leopards\\" Song\\", sheet music (2nd edition, 1927). Although it was not his initial intention, in 1893 he took up a post as private tutor to a student he had been coaching at The Skinners' School and travelled to Florida with him. Upon his return and owing to a shortage of officers, a short diversion from his teaching duties during 1893 saw Shaw Jeffrey join the Volunteer battalion of the Royal West Kent Regiment. Unable to afford a new uniform (then costing ¬£80), after a change in regiment apparel to a much more popular red-with-light-blue colour scheme, he was forced to resign his commission later that year. In 1894 he took up another post, this time to become a holiday modern-languages tutor (a well paid position) to the son of Sir Thomas and Lady Glen-Coats, Thomas Glen-Coats, later to compete at the 1908 Olympics. Putting his schoolmaster plans aside, he travelled with them to France, and the next year to Germany, where both enrolled at the University of Marburg. Once Glen-Coats was \\"safely... installed at Merton College, Oxford,\\" Shaw Jeffrey returned to the university to study for a Phil.Doc., but, shortly before completing the degree in 1897, he was persuaded by the Dean of Queen's College to take up a position at Clifton College, Bristol. Headmaster at Colchester Royal Grammar School Colchester Royal Grammar School, circa 1908 Having been an assistant master at the Clifton College for three years, he was offered a position as headmaster at a new school which was to be founded in Argentina by the educationalist Michael Ernest Sadler, but could not get the funding to travel there, instead he assumed the role of headmaster at Colchester Royal Grammar School (known locally as CRGS). It is unclear exactly what date he can be said to have joined the school, because although agreement between the school and the governing legislature was reached in May 1899, the process of finding a new headmaster went on under the guidance of an interim one. Certainly, his official term as headmaster started on 1 September 1900 and by the end of 1900 he had already made his mark on the school‚Äîachievements included the introduction of a new school song, \\"Carmen Colcestriense\\", which used the same tune as, and a variation of the lyrics for, the school song of The Skinners' School. He retired his post as headmaster in 1916, but kept a lasting interest in the school. During his 16-year stay at CRGS, student numbers increased from 29 to 180 boys under his guidance, particularly through the introduction of day pupils. Shaw Jeffrey is also credited with the introduction of many changes at the school, including the introduction of purple blazers, the setting up of the Old Colcestrian Society for former boys (and quite often honoured former masters), a preparatory school, a cadet corps, an orchestra, a bugle band and a series of school entertainments and theatrical performances, and the acquisition of several buildings on behalf of the school. He was a national pioneer of the teaching of modern European languages through phonetics, employed language teachers from Germany and France, and set up arrangements for foreign study during holidays. CRGS cadet corps, July 1914 Whilst at CRGS he founded the school magazine, The Colcestrian, designed to relay information about the school to students, ex-students and parents on a regular basis. This ran for over sixty consecutive years, and has recently been restarted in a similar style. Even after he left the school, he wrote into the magazine, adding his own memories, thoughts and opinions on articles of news published. He often signed himself off as \\"J\\", \\"an abbreviation that was and is commonly used in reference to him\\" throughout his time at CRGS and as synonymous with the man himself that it could be used for an article about his death in the local newspaper. In recognition of his achievements at the school, a school house was named after him in 1950. The change from School House to Shaw Jeffrey's House completed a quartet that had featured three other notable headmasters of the school since Shaw Jeffrey himself introduced the four-house system in 1908. The house is still informally known by students as \\"J's\\". Another tribute, a painting of him by Frank Daniell, a Colchester artist, was presented to him on his retirement by the governors of CRGS and members of the Old Colcestrian Society and a replica was initially to be hung in the school hall;, reprinted from it was, however, the replica that was taken by Shaw Jeffrey and the original hung in the school, where it remains. Visits to Borley Rectory Shaw Jeffrey was the first known witness of what was later deemed to be paranormal activity at Borley Rectory. In 1885 he spent time at the rectory with his friend Henry \\"Harry\\" Bull with whom he was studying at Oxford, during which he experienced \\"lots of small adventures at the Rectory. Stones falling about, my boots found on top of the wardrobe, etc.\\" He also stated that he had seen the nun who was reputed to haunt the rectory several times and had often heard the ghostly coach during the night. In his view, however, the most striking of the phenomena, which he later recounted to the researcher and author on the subject Harry Price, was the loss of a French dictionary which was later thrown on the floor of his bedroom in the night. Price regarded Shaw Jeffrey's testimonies as an \\"important contribution to the evidence for the early haunting of Borley Rectory\\", and used them in many of the studies which made the rectory famous in 1937. However, due to the time difference been events and their reporting over 50 years later, they have been challenged as unreliable. Publications Shaw Jeffrey was particularly at home with modern languages, having become fluent in both French and German in the 1890s, and lectured on the topic and how it should be taught‚Äìphonetically, in his opinion. Later on, he authored more works relating to education, including the Work and Progress Record Book (Arnold) and The Schools of England (Ed. J. Burrow). He was also a contributor to the Argosy and other London periodicals, including the English Illustrated Magazine, Longmans and the Boy's Own Paper. His first book, however, came with Useful Facts in Physiology (Educational Supply Association) in 1889. Later, having settled down at CRGS, he used his spare time to publish Elementary German Words and Phrases for Red Cross Workers and Elementary French Words and Phrases for Red Cross Workers (both Hachette) in 1914. They were endorsed by Queen Alexandra and spawned over 50,000 copies. Over the course of his life he adapted and authored several foreign-language works for English audiences, namely: *The Study of Colloquial and Literary French, With notes on the present state of modern language teaching, etc. A joint work with his professor at the University of Marburg, Eduard Koschwitz; *Ausgewaelte Marchen (Published 1902, by Whittaker), an adaptation of a story from Ludwig Bechstein's Deutsches M√§rchenbuch, with added introduction and notes. *Au P√¥le en ballon from the French original by Victor Patrice; *Poucinet. (Conte finlandais) from the French original by √âdouard Ren√© and Lefebvre Laboulaye. *Short passages for translation into French and German (Oxford University Press) In 1923 he published another non-fiction book, Whitby Lore and Legend, having retired to Whitby via South Africa. A Schoolmaster's Apologia: Memories of Eighty Years was his collection of memoirs, published by Abbey Press, Whitby, in 1948. His time at CRGS is documented in his 1948 collaboration, Some Chapters in the History of the Royal Grammar School Colchester, with the one time Mayor of Colchester, Sir William Gurney Benham, who was a personal friend of Shaw Jeffrey and first president of the Old Colcestrian Society. After retirement, Shaw Jeffrey could also give time to his love of travelling, and authored a number of related titles. Round the World with an Empress and Round the world with the 'Empress of Britain' (both Ed. J. Burrow) were accounts of the trips he made while lecturing on board the liners of Canadian Pacific Railway during the British winter; a series dubbed The Little Travel Books (Horne) documented others of his travels, and grew out of articles he wrote for the Whitby Gazette. They included: *Black and White in South Africa *Sunshine on the Waters (Australia and New Zealand) *Eastward to the Cape *Sidelights-South African Roundabout *Third Time Lucky (South Africa) *Columbus Calling (West Indies) A selection of these books he later sent to Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret, who were said to have enjoyed them. Later life and death On 13 August 1901, only shortly after becoming headmaster at CRGS, Shaw Jeffrey married his wife Alice, whom he had met on a Mediterranean cruise, and who stayed at the school throughout his time there. On his retirement, they moved to South Africa, where he did \\"valuable works on the Press for the Allied cause\\"., edited by B. A. B. Barton; with a foreword by Hervey W. G. Benham. From 1914 onwards they also had possession of Whitby's Bagdale Old Hall, built in 1530, as a residence, and eventually took residence there on his return from South Africa, though they were often away travelling. Despite retirement from any sort of career, Shaw Jeffrey maintained that he \\"had no intention of leading an idle life\\" and was variously an inspector and examiner for both the University of Cambridge and the University of London and an assessor for all of Cambridge's French papers for five years after the introduction of the higher certificate. He was also an occasional inspector in modern languages for the Board of Education and deputised as professor of French at the University of Durham while the professor himself was incapacitated due to illness. He was an assessor of all modern language papers set at Durham for five years. He continued to fill in positions inspecting in Spanish and Italian, despite only having learned the languages during his travels. Although he spent barely 10 or 12 weeks in any one year in Whitby, he was still attached to it. Shortly before his death he published A Haunt of Ancient Peace, a history of Bagdale Old Hall (with Sir D'Arcy Power, KBE), and also made several large donations: ¬£3000 to Whitby Parish Church, ¬£2000 to the museum and ¬£500 to the Whitby Literary and Philosophy Society. Shaw Jeffrey died on 22 February 1952, leaving Alice as a widow. The couple had just celebrated their golden wedding anniversary, a fact reported in the Essex County Standard, along with a short obituary, and an overview of the latest Old Colcestrian annual meeting (held only a day after his death), at which a variety of tributes had been paid. The article describes him as \\"one of Colchester's most famous headmasters\\" and one with \\"tons of personality\\". His death was particularly poignant for members of CRGS, for it came two days before a World War Two war memorial, for which he and his wife had contributed the majority of the money, was to be unveiled and dedicated. On her death, his wife left their house in Whitby to the Whitby Literary and Philosophy Society, though efforts to turn it into a museum were ultimately unsuccessful.

Gordon's most notable action was the Action of 18 September 1810, when he was seriously wounded in battle and his frigate HMS Ceylon captured by the French frigate V√©nus. Gordon was recaptured by Commodore Josias Rowley the following day and later took part in the capture of √éle de France. This was the second occasion on which Gordon had been captured, but he had also distinguished himself in operations against Persian Gulf pirates in the campaign of 1809 and was flag captain at the capture of √éle de France in December 1810. His later career was unremarkable, although he eventually rose to become an admiral and was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath before his death in 1860. Gordon was the third son of Robert Francis Grant-Gordon and Mary Aston, daughter of Sir Willoughby Aston, 5th Baronet. He was the younger brother of Sir James Willoughby Gordon, who was created a baronet and Rear-Admiral Henry Gordon, who was twice mayor of Bath. Military career Charles Gordon joined the Royal Navy in June 1796 as a midshipman and by later advanced to become a commander in the sloop St Lucia. In 1807 he was captured but was exchanged soon afterwards and made a post captain in command of HMS Caroline, which he commanded in the Indian Ocean, operating against pirates in the Persian Gulf during the campaign of 1809: At Ras al-Khaymah in November 1809, Caroline destroyed or captured 80 pirate vessels. Shortly after the operations in the Persian Gulf, Gordon took command of the Indian-built frigate HMS Ceylon and continued operating in the Indian Ocean, based at Madras. In September 1810, word reached Madras that the British force that was blockading the French island of √éle de France had been destroyed at the Battle of Grand Port and its commander Josias Rowley was in desperate need of reinforcement. Sailing south to join Rowley, Ceylon visited Port Napoleon on √éle de France in the hope of meeting Rowley there. Instead he found the large French frigate V√©nus and the corvette I√©na under the command of Commodore Jacques Hamelin. The French ships chased Ceylon westwards towards √éle Bourbon and caught her on 17 September within sight of Saint Denis. In a series of bitterly contested engagements during the night, Ceylon was battered and defeated, the badly wounded Gordon surrendering to Hamelin, but only after inflicting significant damage to his flagship. Gordon was taken aboard the French ship and was thus freed when Rowley chased and captured Hamelin's ship on 18 September. At the eventual court martial into his conduct in the action, Gordon was honourably acquitted.James, p. 307-313 Although badly wounded in the action, Gordon was made captain of HMS Africaine, which later served as Admiral Albemarle Bertie's flagship in the successful invasion of √éle de France. In the aftermath of the campaign, Gordon was sent back to Britain and despite living another 50 years and remaining in the Navy throughout, he never again served at sea.Annual Register, 1860, p. 441-442 He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath and gradually rose through the retired ranks, becoming a vice-admiral in 1853, and a full admiral prior to his death in October 1860 aged 79. Personal life Gordon married Anne Blayney, daughter of Lt.-Gen. Lord Blayney in 1818.

Origins and influences Chanson r√©aliste grew out of the caf√©s-concerts and cabarets of the Montmartre district of Paris during the 1880s. Home to such theatrical landmarks as the Moulin Rouge, and Le Chat Noir, Montmartre became a centre for hedonistic and brazen entertainment from the late 19th century to the early 20th century.Gendron, Bernard (2002).

Bohemians: The Glamorous Outcasts, Tauris Parke Paperbacks. p 224. . His compositions were also different in that they included the everyday language and slang used by the commoners. Borrowing elements of the com√©die en vaudeville, the chanteuses r√©alistes (realist singers [female]) often wore black dresses, red lipstick and white face makeup‚Äîtheir faces highlighted with stark lighting, set against a modest, almost bare backdrop‚Äîall done to draw audiences' attention to the singers' emotive facial expressions. In contrast to the picturesque chanson which was popular in post-World War II France‚Äîwith its songs of love, cobbled Parisian streets, and the sound of the accordion‚Äîthe chanteuses r√©alistes sang songs of loss, hopelessness and abandonment; their songs dealt with life in the poorer Parisian faubourgs, and the thugs, pimps, prostitutes, and orphans who called them home; its themes of poverty and the criminal underworld, as well as its sociopolitical commentary, were influenced by the works of such literary realists and naturalist writers as √âmile Zola, Jean Richepin and Paul Bourget. The performers The chanson r√©aliste sentimentalised the plight of poor and dispossessed women, such as prostitutes, waitresses, failed singers in cheap bars, orphans, single mothers and the like. Some of the performers of the genre were also known to have lived the part‚Äîboth √âdith Piaf and Fr√©hel sang in the streets as children, were teenage mothers and lost their children very young‚Äîand many shortened their lives with drugs, alcohol and illness: Yvonne George lived an excessive lifestyle and died at the age of 34; Fr√©hel became an alcoholic at an early age, attempted suicide at 19 and eventually died in poverty; Piaf suffered from addictions to morphine and alcohol and died of cancer. However, given the dramatic and melancholy aspects of chanson r√©aliste, the withered and diseased aspect of their appearance became an integral part of the show. Piaf, for example, was known for her waif-like stage presence and became tightly identified with her role;Cannon, Steve & Dauncey, Hugh (2003). Popular Music in France from Chanson to Techno: Culture, Identity, and Society, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. p. 30. . she was, however, critical of the style: Another common theme of the chanson r√©aliste was motherhood, particularly the mother-son relationship; such songs were a speciality of the singer Berthe Sylva, whose songs dealt with such topics as dying mothers, mothers worrying about their sons at war, sons placing flowers on a mother's grave, and songs about the mundane experiences of a bored housewife.

As commander of the submarine Torricelli he made a gallant last stand against overwhelming British naval forces in June 1940. Early career Pelosi was born in Montella, in the province of Avellino, and entered the Naval Academy at Livorno in 1921. In 1923 he was commissioned as a junior officer, and served aboard the battleship , and then the cruiser in the Far East, where he also served in the San Marco Battalion based at the Italian concession of Tientsin. He returned to Italy to attend the Advanced Course at the Naval Academy, specializing in gunnery. He was promoted to Tenente di Vascello and served aboard the destroyers Bettino Ricasoli and Pantera as gunnery officer, then aboard the cruiser as navigating officer. In 1933 he was transferred to the cruiser , in which he took part in operations during the conflict with Ethiopia in 1935/36. He later commanded a squadron of torpedo boats in Sicily, and also took part in operations during the Spanish Civil War. He was promoted to Capitano di corvetta, and commanded several submarines before taking command of the Torricelli at the start of the war. Red Sea In 1940 Pelosi was the commander of the submarine Torricelli, part of the Red Sea Flotilla based in Massawa, Eritrea. Toricelli was on patrol in the Gulf of Aden on 23 June 1940 when she was intercepted by a Royal Navy squadron comprising the destroyers , , and the sloop off Perim. The Torricelli was trapped on the surface and unable to dive due to damage from a previous attack. Pelosi fought back with deck gun and torpedoes at close range, and hit the Shoreham, but with his submarine heavily damaged, and himself badly wounded, he eventually ordered that the submarine be scuttled. A shell from the Torricelli may have also hit Khartoum, which hours later suffered from an explosion and fire in a magazine. She was forced to beach and was later written off. Pelosi was awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valor for this action, and spent the rest of the war as a POW. Post-war Pelosi was repatriated in 1945 and was promoted to Capitano di fregata, with seniority from 1942. He first served as Chief of Staff of Submarine Command, and later as Commander of Submarines. In 1948, after the period in command of the destroyer Alfredo Oriani, he was promoted to Capitano di vascello. He attended the Istituto di Guerra Marittima, and from December 1949 to August 1951 was commander of Italian Naval Forces in the Trust Territory of Somaliland, before serving as Chief of Staff at the maritime department of the lower Tyrrhenian. From 1952 to 1953 he was commander of Coastal Naval Forces, and then served aboard the cruiser as Chief of Staff of the 2nd Naval Division until July 1954, when he was appointed Chief of Staff at the Maritime Military Command of Sicily. Pelosi was a promoted to Contrammiraglio on 1 January 1957, and attended the Centro Alti Studi Militari (\\"Center for High Military Studies\\"), and served as Inspector of the Corpi Equipaggi Militari Marittimi (CEMM) Schools. After promotion to Ammiraglio di divisione, he served as commander of the Autonomous Maritime Military Command in Sicily, and on promotion to Ammiraglio di squadra in 1964, he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Maritime Department of the Ionian and Lower Adriatic Sea, and also served as President of the Commissione Ordinaria di Avanzamento (\\"Ordinary Commission of Promotion\\").

Located approximately south-east of the centre of Reading, it located near to the University of Reading's Whiteknights Campus. History The school was founded in 1891 as Redlands Board School. Initially it consisted of just an Infant Department which catered for children aged 2 to 7, but in 1892 separate Boys and Girls Departments were opened for children aged 7 to 14. The school buildings, which were designed by local architect S. Slingsby Stallwood, were intended to hold 1166 children, and consisted of a small block which housed the Infants and a larger two-storey block which housed the Boys upstairs and the Girls downstairs. In 1902 the abolition of the school boards led to the school's name being changed to Redlands Council School. During World War I, between 1915 and 1918, the school buildings were converted to No. 4 Reading War Hospital and the teachers and pupils were temporarily moved out to nearby schools. In 1929 the three departments of the school were reorganized into just two: a Primary Department for children aged up to 11 and a Secondary Department for older children. In 1945 these two departments were recognized as separate schools: Redlands Primary School and Redlands Secondary School. However, in 1963 the local education authority decided that the Secondary School was too small to support and closed it. The Primary School moved into the larger building in 1968.

United States  The Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) degree is a four-year undergraduate degree. Usually the first two years consist of liberal arts courses and the last two years focus on social work classes in human development, policy/law, research, and practice. Programs accredited by the Council on Social Work Education require BSW students to complete a minimum of 400 field education or internship hours. Accredited BSW programs often allow students who are interested in obtaining a Master of Social Work degree to complete the degree in a shorter amount of time or waive courses.  Latin America  In Latin America this is a four to five-year degree that can replace liberal arts subjects into health sciences, resulting in social work as a type of community psychology and socioeconomic studies, focused in hospitals, prisons or pedagogy, among others.  Nordic countries  Bachelor of Social Services (called socionom in Swedish and Danish, sosionom in Norwegian, and sosionomi in Finnish) is a degree in social welfare from Nordic universities. At the core it is based on the competences needed to work in social services. Courses in sociology, human rights, gerontology, community services, psychology, social security and entrepreneurship are part of the degree. Service orientation and client work is seen through a social pedagogical framework. The studies take 3 to 5 years. Degree holders are usually hired for services in Scandinavian welfare systems. NGO oriented services take place with families and people of all ages in areas such as: child protection, early childhood education, community work, substance abuse prevention or promotion of mental health.

Burl Ives narrated the special which also featured the Irving Berlin song \\"Easter Parade;\\" it marked Ives's return to a Rankin/Bass special for the first time since Rudolph twelve years prior. Plot Stuffy is a stuffed rabbit, given to a little girl named Glinda as a Christmas present. But when she comes down sick with scarlet fever, her old toys are thrown away to be burned in order to disinfect the playroom. Stuffy is rescued by a sprite named Calliope, who brings him to life and sends him to Easter Valley at the North Pole where he befriends Santa Claus and three other rabbits named Spats, Flops, and Whiskers to help him with the Easter traditions. However, an ice wizard named Zero wants to freeze the valley by stealing the Golden Easter Lily with the help of his reluctant partner, a living snowball named Bruce. In order to stop Zero and save Easter, Stuffy must become the Easter Bunny, while Santa (having been warned of the incident by Bruce, who temporarily betrays his partner) talks Zero into returning the Golden Lily by threatening to move away from the North Pole to the South Pole.

It is a typical true limpet; a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Patellidae, with gills.Gofas, S. (2014). Patella vulgata Linnaeus, 1758. Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=140685 on 2014-10-29 This species occurs in the waters of Western Europe. Radula The radula in this species is longer than the shell itself. It contains 1,920 teeth in 160 rows of 12 teeth each. Patella vulgata is found attached to firm substrates from the high shore to the edge of the sublittoral zone, although it predominates in areas of wave action. Its shell is conical, up to around 6 cm long, and lacks defined chirality. Common limpets are believed to be able to live for up to twenty years. Patella vulgata has been the focus of a range of scientific investigation, as far back as 1935. Its development is well described and it has been the focus of transcriptomic investigation, providing a range of genomic sequence data in this species for analysis. Their teeth are the strongest natural material known. A study published in the Royal Society journal in 2015 concluded that \\"the tensile strength of limpet teeth can reach values significantly higher than spider silk, considered to be currently the strongest biological material, and only comparable to the strongest commercial carbon fibres.‚Äù The material was able to withstand 4.9 GPa. This considerable tensile strength of limpet teeth is attributed to a high mineral volume fraction of reinforcing goethite nanofibres.Webb, Jonathan. \\"Limpet teeth set new strength record\\" BBC News, 18 February 2015.

During the operation, KLA leader Adem Jashari and his brother Ham√´z were killed, along with nearly 60 other family members. The attack was criticized by Amnesty International, which wrote in its report that: \\"all evidence suggests that the attack was not intended to apprehend armed Albanians, but 'to eliminate the suspects and their families.'\\" Serbia, on the other hand, claimed the raid was due to KLA attacks on police outposts. Background Adem and Ham√´z Jashari were members of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), a militant group of ethnic Albanians that sought the independence of Kosovo from Yugoslavia. Adem Jashari was responsible for organizing the first armed political formation in Srbica (Sk√´nderaj in Albanian) in 1991. Pursuing Adem Jashari for the murder of a Serbian policeman, Serbian forces again attempted to assault the Jashari compound in Prekaz on 22 January 1998. On 28 February, a firefight erupted between Albanian militants and a Serbian police patrol in the small village of Liko≈°ane. Four Serbian policemen were killed and several were injured. The KLA militants, one of whom was Adem Jashari, escaped. Subsequently, Serbian police killed thirteen people in a nearby household. Later that same day, Serbian policemen attacked the neighbouring village of ƒÜirez and subsequently killed 26 Albanians. However, the Albanian militants managed to escape and the police decided to move in on Adem Jashari and his family. In the Drenica valley, Jashari decided to stay in his home and he instructed his fighters to stay there as well and resist to the last man. Operation On 5 March 1998, the KLA launched another attack on a police patrol in Donji Prekaz, which caused the Serbian police to seek retribution, according to the official Serbian public report.Rights Watch: Violence in Kosovo After the second attack, the police prepared a brutal response for the Jasharis. They started hunting down local KLA militants who were forced to retreat to Jashari's compound in the same village. Yugoslav policemen surrounded the group and invited them to surrender, while urging all other persons to clear the premises. The police further alleged that they gave them two hours to comply. Within the given deadline, dozens of civilians complied with the order and dispersed in safety from the stronghold. According to the police, after the two-hour deadline had expired, Adem Jashari, his brother and most of his family-members, however still refused to comply and remained inside the compound. After a tense verbal stand-off, according to official Serbian statements, Jashari's group responded by firing on the police using automatic weapons as well as mortars, hand grenades and snipers, killing two and injuring three policemen. In the ensuing violence, the Yugoslav police killed more than sixty people, including both Jashari brothers. The only survivor was Besarta Jashari, Ham√´z Jashari's daughter. She claimed that the policemen had \\"threatened her with a knife and ordered her to say that her uncle (Adem Jashari) had killed everyone who wanted to surrender.\\" Goran Radosavljeviƒá, a major in the Serbian Interior Ministry, claimed that \\"Adem Jashari used women, children and the elderly as hostages...\\". Yugoslav Army General Neboj≈°a Pavkoviƒá stated that \\"It was a normal policing action against a well-known criminal. It was successful. The other details I don't remember\\". Evidence gathered later showed that the attack wasn't intended to apprehend of armed Albanian \\"militants\\"; rather, the attack was to eliminate them and their families. Other houses of Jashari family members were also attacked by the police as well as the residential compound of the Lushtaku family. In response, the UN security council turned to Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter without authorizing the final measure of the chapter which was military intervention. Mortars fired on houses, and snipers shot those who fled. = Burial = The local Council for the Defense of Human Rights and Freedoms was contacted by the police to collect the bodies, but when the council requested documentation about the deceased none was made public. According to the council, the police had moved the corpses to a Pristina morgue before returning them to the Drenica area. On 9 March, the police warned that if the bodies weren't buried by their families they would be buried by the authorities, while the families requested autopsies to be performed. On 10 March, the police got a bulldozer and dug a mass grave near Prekaz, and buried the bodies, ten of which were still unidentified at that time. Families had hoped that autopsies might be performed, but a group of doctors from Pristina, the families of the deceased, representatives from the Catholic Church, the Muslim community and international human rights organizations were denied access to the area. The heads of the Serbian police accused the organizations that they had smuggled weapons into the region in the past. On 11 March, the bodies were reburied according to Islamic tradition. Forty-two individuals, Albanians, were identified to have died in Donji Prekaz during the operation. Six Albanians died in the nearby village of Lau≈°a under unclear circumstances. Aftermath Adam Jashari Memorial hall The shootout at the Jashari family compound involving Adem Jashari, a KLA commander and surrounding Yugoslav troops in 1998 resulted in the massacre of most Jashari family members.. The deaths of Jashari and his family generated an international backlash against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The Prekaz attack led to a rapid increase of the KLA's popularity among ethnic-Albanians and village militias were formed in many parts of Kosovo. As news of the killings spread, armed Kosovo Albanian militias emerged throughout Kosovo, seeking to avenge Jashari's death as Albanians flocked to join the KLA. The event became a rallying myth for KLA recruitment regarding armed resistance to Yugoslav forces.. \\"We concentrate on one symbolic event ‚Äì the massacre of the insurgent Jashari family, killed in the hamlet of Prekaz in March 1998 while fighting Serbs troops. This was neither the only massacre nor the worst during the recent conflict...\\"; pp: 515‚Äì516. After the event, Adem Jashari himself was portrayed as a \\"terrorist\\" in the Yugoslav media, while the Albanian media depicted him as a \\"freedom fighter\\". The casualties of the attack would be described as the fall of \\"martyrs\\" in the Albanian media, while in the Serbian media they were reported to be \\"collateral effects of the fight against terrorism\\". On 13 March, about 50,000 people demonstrated against the attacks, while on 15 March, the Catholic Church called for masses to be held throughout the region, after which about 15,000 people demonstrated in Pristina. In late March 1998, more than 100,000 people marched in eight American cities and European capitals to protest the attack. Eventually, events spiralled out of control and the Kosovo War ensued.

The Alabama's home port is Vineyard Haven, Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. The Alabama is owned by The Black Dog Tall Ships, along with the Shenandoah, and offers cruises of Nantucket Sound.Alabama Accessed December 13, 2008. History The schooner Alabama was one of the last vessels built from the design of one of the most notable designers of Gloucester Fishing Schooners, Thomas F. McManus. Commissioned by the Mobile Bar Pilot Association of Mobile, Alabama, the vessel was built in Pensacola, Florida, launched in 1926, and originally called Alabamian until her predecessor the Bar Pilot Association's original Alabama was retired. Though the hull bore strong resemblance of McMannus' famous Gloucester fishing schooner designs, it served as a pilot boat stationed on the Mobile Bar until 1966. In 1967 the schooner was bought by Captain Robert S. Douglas, master and designer of the Shenandoah, and moved to Vineyard Haven. There she sat on a mooring with minimal necessary upkeep until 1994. In the early nineties with a dwindling market for windjammer cruises which leave out most modern amenities kids became the new direction for the Coastwise Packet Company - the original name for what is now also The Black Dog Tall Ships. Because of the success of these \\"Kids Cruises\\" on board the Shenandoah, Alabama was to be rebuilt by the Five Corners Shipbuilding Company headed by Gary Maynard a former First Mate that sailed on the Shenandoah. Most of the work was done in Vineyard Haven with the vessel afloat on her mooring using Captain Douglas' own power tools and shop space. Any other work was done in Fairhaven, Massachusetts at D.N. Kelly's Shipyard. The Alabama now proudly flies the Douglas house flag and the Black Dog emblem from her lofty rig. Serving as an ambassador for the Black Dog as well as a platform for youngsters to experience life at sea, the Vessel can be seen cruising the waters of Southern New England during the summer months and making occasional visits to towns with maritime heritage in the shoulder season. A Coast Guard boatcrew safely transferred 17 passengers from the grounded Schooner \\"Alabama\\" near the mouth of the Mystic River, Connecticut, Sunday evening, June 18, 2017. At approximately 6:15 p.m., watchstanders at Coast Guard Sector Long Island Sound Command Center were notified that the 126-foot Schooner, \\"Alabama\\", with 17 passengers and five crew aboard ran aground near the mouth of the Mystic River in Conn. Sector Long Island Sound watchstanders launched a Coast Guard boatcrew from Coast Guard Station New London and issued a safety marine information broadcast. The Station boatcrew arrived on scene and safely transferred the 17 passengers from the \\"Alabama\\" to Noank shipyard in Groton, Conn. Sector Long Island Sound marine investigators are scheduled to conduct an investigation to ensure the integrity of the vessel prior to the vessel operating again. The Alabama is a regular participant in the annual Gloucester Schooner Festival.

The French Army deployed it in 1916 but the type was quickly withdrawn from front-line service.Taylor, 1989, p.697 Development Developed in response to an order by the A√©ronautique Militaire in the summer of 1915, it was to have been a two-seat reconnaissance machine capable of making a flight of and back while carrying a load of bombs. Nieuport's design started with the Nieuport 12 reconnaissance aircraft, but had its fuselage stretched to balance out the single nose-mounted Hispano-Suiza V-8 engine and its wingspan increased by the addition of an additional bay.Sanger, 2002, 41‚Äì44, 71 Protracted development that saw some refinement in the engine installation and the wing area increased from square meters to resulted in it entering service only in mid 1916. Further development, with a larger engine and a further enlarged and airframe would result in the Nieuport 15. Three additional unrelated airframes that some sources have connected to the Nieuport 14 were built, all featuring a nose radiator, single bay wings and a deep hunchback fuselage. One had large wing cut-outs to improve visibility and was fitted with a Lorraine-Dietrich 8A engine, another with a Hispano-Suiza engine, and a third with a Hispano-Suiza engine and a crescent-shaped wing. With its failure as a combat aircraft, a dedicated trainer variant was developed, the Nieuport 14 √âcole with dual controls, nosewheels to guard against nose-over accidents, and an Le Rhone 9C rotary engine in the place of the original V-8. It is possible that some of these airframes had been left over from the original production. When further refined, the trainer version was redesignated the Nieuport 82 E.2 and would be nicknamed Grosse Julie (\\"Big Julie\\"). Operational history Deliveries to reconnaissance squadrons commenced in late 1916, replacing obsolete Voisin III and V types. However, changing priorities resulted in production being curtailed as the Hispano- Suiza engines were desperately needed for SPAD VII fighters, and several units including Escadrille 102 and 103 that had planned on operating the Nieuport 14 became fighter units instead, operating the Nieuport 17.Davilla, 1997, p.374-375 With production halted prematurely, the remaining machines were relegated to training duties and as unit hacks once improvements had been made to their side-mounted Hazet radiators that had been the source of some problems. While the Nieuport 14 only saw service in France, the Nieuport 82 served more widely. Aside from flight schools in France, Brazil operated 9 Nieuport 82s from 1919 to 1924, and Japan operated a small number, with at least one acquiring the civil registration J-TOXC. The first Native American and African-American female aviator Bessie Coleman did some of her training in a Nieuport 82 in France.

It originally premiered on ABC on April 6, 1977.BCDB The special includes original songs, including two sung by Astaire: \\"The Easter Bunny Is Comin' to Town\\" and \\"All You Have to Do is Think 'Can Do'\\". Plot S.D. Kluger (from Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town and once again voiced by Fred Astaire) returns as a train engineer, but still a mailman to answer questions about the Easter Bunny in the children's letters. The story begins in the small town of Kidville, run by all orphaned children (including S.D. Kluger when he was a kid) and located on the other side of Big Rock Mountain. The children enjoy the simple life, despite being bothered by Gadzooks the Bear (Allen Swift) who hates everything to do with the holidays. One Easter morning, they find an orphaned baby rabbit, raise him as their own, and name him Sunny when they notice how much he likes the warm sun. Sunny (Skip Hinnant), now one year old, makes plans with the children to sell what they make in exchange for what they need, including their eggs, with help from three chickens called the Hendrew Sisters (Jill Choder and Karen Dahle). Sunny sets off to deliver his eggs. Along the way, he meets a friendly hobo named Hallelujah Jones (Ron Marshall), who suggests to him that he could sell his eggs in a town called Town. However, upon climbing Big Rock Mountain, Sunny runs into Gadzooks who steals his eggs. After escaping, Sunny makes it to Town which is a dreary, dismal place. There, nobody laughs, everyone dresses in dark clothing, and if any children are born, the whole family has to move away, and beans are eaten for every meal, by order of the ruthless Dowager Duchess Lily Longtooth, who wants her seven-year-old nephew, King Bruce the Frail, to follow in her footsteps. Bruce complains about wanting to be a normal child instead of being king, despite his aunt's objections. Saddened by this, Sunny heads back to Kidville and explains the problem. Hallelujah and the children dip the eggs in various bowls of paint as a way of tricking Gadzooks. He lies to the bear, saying he is on his way to sell colored stones as paperweights. Gadzooks, befuddled by Sunny's lie, lets him go, demanding he bring him eggs. Sunny makes it into Town again, passing out his eggs to all the townspeople, including King Bruce, who crowns him the Easter Bunny, Royal Knight of the Rainbow Eggs and he and Sunny initiate a traditional ritual of eating the eggs. However, Lily, disappointed in her nephew, chases Sunny out, outlaws eggs, and sends him to bed without supper. After Bruce tells Sunny that he knew his supper would be more beans, anyway, Sunny promises to bring him very special beans next Easter. The following year, Sunny, Hallelujah, and Herbert the Baker make the first Easter jelly beans. However, upon their way to Town to deliver them, Gadzooks, still angered by Sunny's lie and thinking his eggs are colored stones again, flings them far, far away. All hope seems lost until all the other children hunt the eggs up in bushes and trees, and Sunny decides that he'll always hide them. Next Easter, Sunny sets out, only to get caught by Gadzooks, who chases him to Kidville, where everybody has all pitched in to make him a brand new Easter outfit made by the Kidville tailors. Touched by their gesture of kindness, Gadzooks becomes their friend. Meanwhile back in Town, the townspeople become interested in the Easter eggs Sunny hides, King Bruce and his servants enjoy eating the jelly beans, and the children are loved by all the townspeople. But Lily, outraged, sends her guards out to arrest them, but Sunny and the children leave just in time, and promise to return next year. Next Easter, Sunny has the candy maker come up with a secret weapon of his own for their next visit. Hallelujah suggests Sunny should do something for Bruce so he can stand up to Lily, which Sunny agrees to and goes to the Kidville seamstress and pillow makers for this idea. On their next visit to Town, after causing the guards to trip on the rolling Easter eggs, Sunny hops into a paper bag, where the guards discover that they captured a chocolate bunny, thus being let into Town where Sunny brings Bruce stuffed animals to give him courage every night when he is lonely. Just as Bruce is about to give Sunny permission to come to Town whenever he wants, Lily arrives to stop him. Bruce tells her that he outranks her, but finds it difficult. Afterwards, Lily tells her guards do anything they can to stop Sunny from coming to Town. The following year, Sunny and friends plan to have Gadzooks help them bring all the Easter treats to Town. However, Lily's guards cause the bear to trip and break his leg. Everyone is saddened that Gadzooks can't help, but Hallelujah suggests that they build a railroad over Big Rock Mountain from Kidville to Town. After the railroad is built, Sunny and his friends go to the trainyard to hire a train to carry all the goods. In a sequence based upon The Little Engine that Could, the big engines in the roundhouse are too important to help, so they find a small switch engine named Chugs (Bob McFadden), all rusty after being put down for years, hire him, and paint him yellow. Meanwhile, Lily orders her guards to do anything they can to stop the train from getting to Town. They spread melted butter on the rails, causing Chugs to slip, but Hallelujah pours jelly beans on the butter, providing extra traction and allowing them to climb the hill, thus foiling Lily's plan.

Kluger in a Rankin/Bass holiday special, before his actual death in 1987. He was also the narrator of Santa Claus is Comin' to Town (1970). The Easter Bunny is Comin' to Town is also a semi-sequel to the same special, Santa Claus is only mentioned once in the special and as such, it shares many similarities with the earlier special (Sunny as Kris Kringle, the Kidville kids as the Kringles, King Bruce as Jessica, Hallelujah Jones as Topper, Gadzooks as the Winter Warlock, and Lily Longtooth as Burgermeister Meisterburger). It was also Astaire's second time starring in a production about the holiday, following the 1948 MGM musical Easter Parade. * This was the third Rankin/Bass special about Easter. The first two were Here Comes Peter Cottontail (1971), narrated by Danny Kaye, and The First Easter Rabbit (1976), narrated by Burl Ives. * Warner Home Video released The Easter Bunny is Comin' to Town on DVD in 2008.

It is the company that has the exclusive licence to sell Pepsi products in Iraq. PepsiCo International's franchise agreement authorises Baghdad Soft Drinks Company to produce and distribute PepsiCo's Pepsi-Cola, Seven-Up and Mirinda soft drink brands. Many bottling companies are franchisees of corporations such as Coca-Cola and PepsiCo who distribute the beverage in a specific geographic region. It has a staff of ~1,400, and the 2004 agreement with pepsi is expected to create some 2,000 new jobs at Baghdad. Iraqi Pepsi is currently selling about 7.2 million bottles a month, though this number drops subject to power outages. History Pepsi-Cola in Iraq goes back to 1950, when the brand was launched. Pepsi grew to become Iraq's leading soft drink brand, with Baghdad Soft Drinks Company, becoming a Pepsi franchisee in 1984. However, that relationship ended in 1990, when PepsiCo ceased doing business in Iraq after US and international trade sanctions barred trade with the country. Hamid Jassim Khamis, serves as managing director, but resigned after he clashed with Uday Hussein, son of the dictator Saddam Hussein, who bought a 10 per cent share of the company. During the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the local Pepsi-maker was forced to replace authentic PepsiCo concentrates with counterfeit varieties smuggled in from eastern Europe, due to international regulation. After 2003, Uday Hussein's stake was frozen and Mr Khamis was brought back.

A new company with the name The Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Iraq has been set up. Coca-Cola drinks are imported into Iraq from Jordan, Turkey and other neighbouring countries. Pepsi Cola had been the only cola in Iraq since the mid-1960s Arab League boycott of israel, because of Coke's investments in Israel.

She is an Associate Editor and Project Manager of the book Records of the Salem Witch-Hunt (Bernard Rosenthal, Editor, Cambridge University Press, 2009). She resides in New Hampshire. Although not directly related to any of those accused in North Andover, Burns is the great-x10-granddaughter of Rebecca Nurse, one of the foremost protagonists of the trials in Salem; it was Burns's initial interest in that controversy that led her to explore its North Andover analog. She puts the total accused in the 1692 event at 153. Burns appears in several history documentaries about the Salem witchcraft trials: \\"Salem Witch Hunt: Examine the Evidence\\" (2011) for the Essex National Heritage Commission and the National Park Service,\\"Salem Witch Hunt:Examine the Evidence Premieres Oct. 4\\", Salem Gazette, September 30, 2011 and \\"Salem: Unmasking the Devil\\" (2011) with author Katherine Howe, discussing the case of Rebecca Nurse, for the National Geographic Channel. It aired on the BBC under the alternate title \\"Salem Witch Trials Conspiracy\\". In 2016, she appeared, along with historian Mary Beth Norton, in Season 7, Episode 2, of the TLC cable television series, \\"Who Do You Think You Are?\\" discussing actor Scott Foley's ancestor, Samuel Wardwell of Andover, MA, who was one of the 19 people hanged for witchcraft during the Salem witchcraft trials of 1692. She appeared a second time on this show, with Emerson Baker, in 2018 in Season 9, Episode 7, speaking with actress Jean Smart about her ancestor, Dorcas Hoar of Beverly, MA, who was also convicted at Salem but never executed.

The synagogue's small size points to it having possibly been the private synagogue of a wealthy man. It is also possible that C√≥rdoba's complex of buildings was a yeshivah, kollel, or study hall. Another possibility is that this was the synagogue of a trade guild, which converted a residence or one of the work rooms into the synagogue. The synagogue was decorated according to the best Mudejar tradition.  History  After the expulsion of the Jews in 1492, the synagogue was seized by the authorities and converted into a hospital for people suffering from rabies (hydrophobia), the Hospital Santo Quiteria. In 1588, the building was acquired by the shoemakers guild, who used it as a community center and small chapel, changing the patron saint of the building to Santos Crispin-Crispian, the patron saint of shoemakers. It was declared a National Monument in 1885. Since then it has undergone several phases of the restoration including that of Felix Hernandez in 1929. In 1935, the Spanish authorities marked the eight-hundredth anniversary of Maimonides' birth by changing the name of the square in which the synagogue is located to Tiberias Square, honoring the great native-born philosopher, who is buried in Tiberias. At this celebration the first Jewish prayer service in 443 years to occur openly and with full knowledge of the authorities was held at the synagogue. Another restoration was begun in 1977 for the reopening of the building in 1985 to celebrate the 850th anniversary of Maimonides birth. It is the only synagogue in C√≥rdoba to escape destruction during years of persecution. Although clearly no longer functioning as a house of worship, it is open to the public. Architecture =Building restrictions= The floor plan of the synagogue, as well as other synagogues of the time period, was greatly affected by the restrictions placed upon synagogue construction by Christian leaders. Restrictions varied depending on the location of the synagogue and whether or not Jews enjoyed a privileged status in that community. The size of the synagogue had to reflect its humility and inferiority to the Catholic church, but it differed from place to place in accordance with the Christian buildings in the area. Sometimes even the king's favor was not sufficient to avoid the troubles that the local clergy could cause. In April 1250, Innocent IV ordered the Bishop of C√≥rdoba to take action against the Jews who were building a synagogue whose height was not acceptable to the local clergy. Documents from the reign of Pope Innocent IV recorded resentment toward a prominent new congregational synagogue: The courtyard of C√≥rdoba Synagogue. > The Jews of Cordoba are rashly presuming to build a new synagogue of > unnecessary height thereby scandalizing faithful Christians, wherefore ... > we command [you] ... to enforce the authority of your office against the > Jews in this regard.... =Courtyard= The C√≥rdoba Synagogue has a gate in the eastern wall that leads into a small courtyard that measures slightly more than . The courtyard walls of the synagogue measure on the northern wall, 5.5 meters on the western wall, however the southern wall is only long, the eastern wall which contains the gate is the longest at . This gives the floor plan of C√≥rdoba an unusual trapezoidal footprint. This unusual shape is most likely due to the layout of the surrounding streets, which run at an angle. View of C√≥rdoba Synagogue entrance hall, from the prayer hall =Entrance hall= The entrance to the synagogue, the facade, is located on the northern wall of the courtyard with three openings: a door and two windows on either side. Beyond the facade is the entrance hall that measures on the northern wall, on the southern wall, a western wall, and an eastern wall of . This room has a wooden stairwell which leads up to the women's section. This entrance hall functioned both as a cloakroom and a place for the (water basin for ritual ablutions). The ceiling of the entry hall is made of wood and is high. =Prayer hall= The prayer hall is the largest room in the synagogue, but even it is small in comparison to most buildings or homes of the period. It is slightly rectangular, measuring . It has an extremely high roof in comparison, at to the top of the gables. The height of the room is notable because it is high even among larger synagogues. 256x256px =Women's section= The women's section of the synagogue is in the gallery above the entrance hall; its measurements and layout are identical to those of the entrance hall. It is unclear whether the women's section and the entrance hall were part of the original building. Differences in the structure and height of the roof suggest that this part of structure may have been added later. The women's section features three broad arches that look onto the sanctuary. These arches are decorated with elaborately interwoven stucco and latticework, customary in Sephardic synagogues. The original latticework was either of wood or stucco; it is uncertain which. The three arches are interwoven with elaborate patterns and Hebrew text. The central arch is different than the identical outer arches, having different decoration and being taller in order to accommodate the doorway. Foci of the synagogue 267x267px The hekhal (ark), where the Torah scrolls were kept, was located on the eastern wall, which was customary. The wall is angled, following the street outside, and was decorated with elaborate stucco in accordance with the Mudejar tradition. One of the Hebrew inscriptions mentions the hekhal, reading \\"I will bow down before Your Holy hekhal....\\" The second focus, the bimah (elevated platform), may have been in the center of the room; it has not survived. Benches for the congregants were placed along the walls of the room. The location of the hekhal was based on directions given by Maimonides in his authoritative legal code, the Mishneh Torah. His Second Book of Love of the Torah, Laws of Prayer, states: \\"When building a synagogue ... a heikhal should be built to hold a Torah scroll in it. The heikhal should be built in the direction of prayer in that town [towards Jerusalem], so that they [the congregation] should face the heikhal when they pray. And a bimah should be set up in the center of the house, to enable the reader of the Torah or one who admonishes the congregation, to go up to it so that everyone will be able to hear him....\\" Ceiling and illumination level The ceiling and illumination level of C√≥rdoba Synagogue. The ceiling of the synagogue is made of thin wooden panels above thick beams that hold the ceiling in order to hide the gabled tile roof. The wood panels and beams were richly decorated and worked to add to the building's ornamentation. The ceiling is angled upward in order to give the sanctuary a greater feeling of height common in the architecture of Spanish synagogues. The only floor that receives natural light is the top floor because the synagogue was built in a neighborhood where the houses butted against each other. Three of the upper walls have windows for illumination, five windows for each of three windowed walls. The windows were wide and high. The lintels of the windows are classic arch shapes and may have been decorated with latticework at one time. Decorations and inscriptions Translated from Hebrew: \\"Provisional sanctuary and abode for the Testimony completed by Yitzhak Moheb son of Mr. Ephraim Wadawa, in the [Hebrew] year [50]75 [(1315 C.E.)] So return, oh God hasten to return to Jerusalem\\" The C√≥rdoba Synagogue was influenced by the Mudejar tradition of stucco panels, stylized geometric patterns, and floral patterns. Hebrew verses in the style of the Ibn Shushan Synagogue of Toledo wrap around the windows, and much as in Toledo the stucco panels used many colors. The inscriptions featured inside the synagogue are mostly from Psalms, other books of the Bible, and piyyutim (liturgical poetry). One of the inscriptions gives important information on the synagogue's construction, as well as the primary benefactor of the synagogue. The reconstruction of the text today is based on the version accepted by Cantera-Burgos. \\"This minor sanctuary has been refurbished by Yitzhak Mahab son of the wealthy Ephraim in the Hebrew year 5075 (1315 C.E.) may God remove curses from our nation and rebuild Jerusalem soon.\\" The inscription states that the building was refurbished in the year 1315 C.E. The hekhal had a decorative band that praised the Temple in Jerusalem and linked the synagogue to it: \\"I will bow down toward your holy hekhal and praise Your name for Your mercy and Your truth, for You have magnified Your word above all Your name....\\"(Psalms 138:2). In the women's section there is a verse in praise of women: \\"Your neck is like the tower of David built with turrets\\" (Song of Songs 4:4). There were several verses of longing for Jerusalem: \\"Pray for the peace of Jerusalem; those who love you shall be blessed. Peace be within your walls, prosperity within your palaces\\" (Psalms 122:6‚Äì7). There were also many verses of pleading: \\"Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me; for my soul trusts in You; in the shadow of Your wings I will take refuge until these great troubles pass by\\" (Psalms 57:2).

One of the most selective universities in the country, the academy offers M.B., B.S. (equivalent of the M.D.) degree programs. Upon graduation, most DSMA cadets are commissioned with the rank of Lieutenant in the Myanmar Army Medical Corps. The military physicians are to serve the healthcare needs of rural people when they are assigned in the country's remote regions where access to healthcare is poor. History The DSMA was founded in 1992 as the Defence Services Institute of Medicine (DSIM) to develop physicians to serve in the Tatmadaw Myanmar Armed Forces. Prior to the founding of the academy, the Tatmadaw had recruited its medical and dental officers from civilian medical school graduates, who had to undergo a month-long basic military training program at the Medical Corps Center. While the medical corps of the Tatmadaw had always been short of physicians, by the early 1990s, the shortage became more pronounced as the military government, fearing student unrest, had shut down most civilian universities, following the 8888 Uprising in 1988. Most civilian universities were closed off and on for much of the 1990s. The military run universities essentially became the only venue for those who wished to continue university education inside the country. The DSIM was operated by the Ministry of Health and the Directorate of Medical Services. The purported \\"aim of the DSMA is to produce good Medical officers endowed with brilliant physical and mental ability to safeguard The Three Main National Causes\\" espoused by the military government. The first batch of 47 cadets from the DSIM were commissioned as lieutenants on 17 December 1999, after six years of study and a year as house-surgeons. Through nine intakes, the DSMA produced a total of 1525 medical officers. As of 2008, the DSMA had produced seven Doctor of Medical Science degree holders. The academy is only source of medical officers for the DMS. In terms of Master of Medical Science, by the early 2008, the DSMA had produced 335 specialists, including 48 physicians and 41 surgeons. Nowadays, many army doctors' clinics can be seen in Yangon and specialists of army hospital are also practicing at many private hospitals and clinics. Army doctors are serving the country both in rural and urban regions in the form of private and public practice. Admissions The academy accepts approximately 400 students annually. Unlike at the country's other four civilian medical schools, the selection process goes beyond high University Entrance Examination scores. All prospective candidates must be male and must have high enough college matriculation exam scores to enter any civilian medical university. In addition, the prospective student must sit for another entrance exam as well as physical and psychological exams. After 2010, the matriculation examination marks are not considered for entrance. Personal interview becomes the most important step for entrance. The academy has accepted fewer than 100 students a year since 2010, and only 40 students are accepted to DSMA in 2012. The selection criteria are: * Males only * DSMA entrance exams on 1. Biology, Botany and Zoology and 2. English * Physical fitness * Teamwork and comradeship screening * Psychometric assessment * General interviews * Medical checkups The entrance selection including physical fitness tests, teamwork and comradeship screening, psychometric assessments and general interviews process takes about five to seven days at Officer Testing Team. Only those who pass all the tests and steps above are admitted to the DSMA. Students are eligible for state scholarship programs. The benefit of being a student at DSMA is to get a stipend after acceptance to the school and faster career development than civilian medical doctors. The salary is higher than civilian doctors. Programs The DSMA offers courses for both basic and advanced degrees in medicine and surgery, and runs 20 graduate programs in medical sciences. * Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery (M.B., B.S.) * Diploma in Medical Science (Dip.Med.Sc.) * Master of Medical Science (M.Med.Sc.); Physiology, Anatomy, Biochemistry, Microbiology, Pharmacology, Pathology, Public Health, Forensic Medicine, Internal Medicine, Surgery, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Pediatrics, Orthopedics, Anaesthesiology, Radiology, Otorhinolaryngology, Ophthalmology, Mental Health, Rehabilitation medicine, Radiation oncology. * Doctor of Medical Science (Dr.Med.Sc.); Medicine, Surgery, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Pediatrics, Orthopedics, Cardiac surgery, Cardiology, Neurology, Neurosurgery, Radiology, Anaesthesiology.

The new generation army doctors are likely to take the duty at Ministry of Health and influence the Myanmar health system set up. The DSMA is equipped with lab materials, modern textbooks, and training resources. As intern surgeons, the students must take a field practical tour of duty at military hospitals, where they get field training from professional surgeons. The academy is open year round, and is in session for eleven months of study in an academic year‚Äîten months of medical science coursework plus a month of military science and military leadership.

As its name suggests, the tree is made of aluminum, featuring foil needles and illumination from below via a rotating color wheel. The aluminum Christmas tree was used as a symbol of the commercialization of Christmas in the highly acclaimed and successful 1965 television special, A Charlie Brown Christmas, which discredited its suitability as a holiday decoration. By the mid-2000s aluminum trees found a secondary market online, often selling for high premiums. The trees have also appeared in museum collections. History =Manufacturing= Aluminum trees have been said to be the first artificial Christmas trees that were not green in color.Hewitt, James. The Christmas Tree, ( Google Books), Lulu.com, 2007, p. 34, (). It is more accurate to say that aluminum Christmas trees were the first nongreen Christmas trees commercially successful on a grand scale. Long before aluminum Christmas trees were commercially available at least by the late 1800s, white \\"Christmas trees\\" were made at home by wrapping strips of cotton batting around leafless branches, making what appeared to be snow-laden trees that stayed white in the home. These non-green trees made perfect displays for ornaments and dropped no needles. After Christmas, the cotton was unwrapped and stored with the ornaments for the next year while the branches were burnt or otherwise discarded. Flocked trees, real or artificial, to which flocking was applied became fashionable for the wealthy during the 1930s and have been commercially available since. A 1937 issue of Popular Science advocated spraying aluminum paint using an insect spray gun to coat Christmas trees causing it to appear as if \\"fashioned of molten silver\\".Keith, K.F., \\"Sprays Aluminum Paint on Christmas Tree\\", (Google Books link), Popular Science, January 1937, p.90. Retrieved September 22, 2012. Aluminum Christmas trees were first commercially manufactured sometime around 1955, remained popular into the 1960s, and were manufactured into the 1970s. The trees were first manufactured by Modern Coatings, Inc. of Chicago. Between 1959 and 1969, the bulk of aluminum Christmas trees were produced in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, by the Aluminum Specialty Company; in that decade the company produced more than one million aluminum trees. At the time they were produced in Manitowoc the trees, including the company's flagship product the \\"Evergleam\\", retailed for $25 and wholesaled for $11.25. =Popularity= An aluminum Christmas tree on display in Washington state During the 1960s, the aluminum Christmas tree enjoyed its most popular period of usage. As the mid-1960s passed, the aluminum Christmas tree began to fall out of favor, with many thrown away or relegated to basements and attics. The airing of A Charlie Brown Christmas in 1965 has been credited with ending the era of the aluminum tree,Andrews, Candice Gaukel. Great Wisconsin Winter Weekends, (Google Books), Big Earth Publishing, 2006, p. 178, () and by 1967 their time had almost completely passed. At the height of the aluminum tree's popularity, the trees were sold in the Sears catalog. =Re-emergence= 1960s tree in the collection of The Children's Museum of Indianapolis By 1989, it was not uncommon to find aluminum Christmas trees for sale in yard sales or at estate sales being sold for as little as 25 cents. In recent years the aluminum Christmas tree has seen a re-emergence in popularity. Collectors began buying and selling the trees, especially on online auction web sites. A rare 7-foot-tall pink aluminum Christmas tree sold on the Internet for $3,600 in 2005.Pinto, Barbara. \\"Town Leads Aluminum Christmas Tree Revival \\", ABC News, December 18, 2005, accessed December 13, 2008. Design Many aluminum trees utilized a rotating color wheel which projected colored light up through the tree from the floor. Aluminum Christmas trees consisted of aluminum branches attached to a wooden or aluminum central pole. The central pole had holes drilled into at angles so when the aluminum foil branches were attached they formed a tree shape. The foil branches had woven aluminum \\"needles\\" as well. Each tree took about 15 minutes to assemble. The first aluminum trees could not be illuminated in the manner traditional for natural Christmas trees or other artificial trees. Fire safety concerns prevented lights from being strung through the tree's branches; draping electric lights through an aluminum tree could cause a short circuit. The common method of illumination was a floor-based \\"color wheel\\" which was placed under the tree. The color wheel featured various colored segments on a clear plastic wheel; when the wheel rotated a light shone through the clear plastic casting an array of colors throughout the tree's metallic branches. Sometimes this spectacle was enhanced by a rotating Christmas tree stand.Lukas, Paul. \\"Trees Made of Tinsel \\", Money Magazine, via CNNMoney.com December 1, 2004, accessed December 13, 2008. Aluminum Christmas trees have been variously described as futuristic or as cast in a style which evoked the glitter of the space age. A Money magazine article published on the CNN website in 2004 called the design of aluminum Christmas trees \\"clever\\". The same article asserted that once the trees overcame their cultural baggage as icons of bad- taste, that aluminum Christmas trees were actually beautiful decor. The Space Age-feel of the trees made them especially suited to the streamlined home decor of the time period.\\"Aluminum Christmas Trees \\", Cool Things, Kansas State Historical Society, official site, accessed December 13, 2008. Cultural significance A color wheel for use with an aluminum Christmas tree, from the collection of the Children's Museum of Indianapolis. The aluminum Christmas tree was used as a symbol of the over-commercialization of Christmas in the 1965 Peanuts holiday special, A Charlie Brown Christmas. The program is considered a classic amongst Christmas specials, and its mention of the aluminum tree solidified the tree's legendary status while satirizing it as well. In the special, Lucy van Pelt implored Charlie Brown to get a \\"big, shiny aluminum tree...maybe painted pink\\" for the group's nativity play. Charlie Brown lamented the commercialization of Christmas and, in a lot surrounded by many huge aluminum trees (much larger than most aluminum trees of the era), purchased a small, scrawny natural tree on a whim instead.\\"A dark family secret: the artificial Christmas tree\\", Oakland Tribune, December 24, 2006, via findarticles.com, accessed December 13, 2008. The re-emergent popularity of aluminum Christmas trees has allowed them to find their way into museum collections. One example is the Aluminum Christmas Tree Museum (officially known as the Aluminum Tree and Aesthetically Challenged Seasonal Ornament Museum and Research Center).Priestly, Kent and Elliston, Jon.

His work included engravings, linocuts, etchings, and lithographs, though he is most remembered for the technical skill of his woodcuts and wood engravings.Adip Dutta, Manifestations II : Indian Art in the 20th Century, Delhi Art Gallery, 2004 Haren Das followed a tradition of wood engraving that developed in the bazaars of north Calcutta in the mid-19th century. His early academic training was received partially from Ramendranath Chakravorty (1902‚Äì55), who had been influenced in color woodcut printing by the Japanese style of Ukiyo-e prints.Paula Sengupta, Haren Das: The End of Toil, Delhi Art Gallery, 2008 Throughout his life Das perfected his woodcut and wood engraving techniques, sometimes producing multi-colored prints of enormous technical proficiency. Though Das created numerous etchings, aquatints, dry points and linocuts, he seldom ventured outside the realm of printmaking. Working during a time when fine art was equated with painting and sculpture, Haren Das was often criticized for working in what was then considered little more than a commercially oriented craft. Throughout his career Das remained committed to British academic and Victorian ideals that included concepts of perfection and traditionally perceived beauty. Unlike artists such as Somnath Hore, who reacted with brutal directness to the horrors of the 1943 Bengal Famine, Haren Das remained focused upon his vision of a rural ideal. However, his bucolic images paid continuous homage to the hardworking people of India‚Äôs farms and villages.Sohini Dhar, Manifestations, Delhi Art Gallery, 2003 In 1947 Das became a teacher at the Government School of Art in Calcutta, and in 1951 he became a Lecturer at the Government College of Art & Craft in the same city. His printmaking work has been exhibited and recognized in India, Japan, Germany, Switzerland, Poland, Argentina and Chile.

It was depopulated in 1948. It was located at the site of the biblical city of Abel-beth-maachah. Name According to Khalidi, its Arabic name derives from Aramaic; the first part of its name, abil, means \\"meadow\\" and the latter part, qamh, means \\"wheat\\". According to Palmer, who wrote in the 19th century when the name of the village was Abl, it was probably derived from the biblical name Abel Beth Maachah.Palmer, 1881, p. 13 History =Bronze Age and Iron Age= Abil al-Qamh was established on a site that had been inhabited since 2900 BCE and remained populated for over 2,000 years. It was captured by Thutmose III in 1468 BCE. During the Israelite period, under the reign of David, it was fortified, and later conquered by the Arameans. In 734 BCE it was incorporated into the Assyrian Empire.Khalidi, 1992, p.428Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 96 =Byzantine period= Ceramics from the Byzantine era have been found here.Dauphin, 1998, p. 641 =Mamluk period= Under Mamluk rule in 1226 CE, Arab geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi mentions \\"Abil al Kamh\\" as a village belonging to Banias, between Damascus and the Mediterranean Sea.al-Hamawi quoted in le Strange, 1890, p.381 =Ottoman period= In 1517, Abil al-Qamh was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire, and by 1596 it was under the administration of the nahiya (\\"subdistrict\\") of Tibnin, part of Sanjak Safad, and went under the name of Abil al-Qamh, with a population of 24 families and 2 bachelors, an estimated 143 persona. All the villagers were Muslim. They paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on wheat, barley, olives, beehives, vineyards, goats and beehives; a total of 1,846 Ak√ße.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 183, quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 428.Note that Rhode, 1979, p. 6 writes that the register that H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah studied was not from 1595/6, but from 1548/9 In 1838 it was noted as Catholic village in the Mejr Ayun district.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol. 3, p. 347, 2nd appendix. pp. 136-137 In 1875 Victor Gu√©rin visited the place, which he called Tell Abel Kamah.Gu√©rin, 1880, pp. 346 -349 On the highest point, to the north, he found the ruins of a wall and a Muslim cemetery.Gu√©rin, 1880, pp. 346 -349; as given by Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 107 In 1881, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described the village as being near a stream, and containing a church and ancient ruins.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, pp. 85,86. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 428 =British Mandate= Abil al-Qamh was a part of the French Mandate of Lebanon until 1923 when it was incorporated into the British Mandate in Palestine. In the first half of the 20th century, it had a triangular outline that conformed to the hill on which it was built. Agriculture was the basis of its economy, and the village's abundant water supply earned it the local name of Abil al-Mayya meaning the \\"Meadow of Water\\". In the 1931 census of Palestine Abil al-Qamh had a total population of 229; 122 Muslims and 107 Christians, in a total of 58 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 105 In the 1945 statistics the population was 330; 220 Muslims and 100 Christians, with a total of 4,615 dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey. The village had a mixed population of 230 Shia Muslims and 100 Arab Christians.United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine, Appendix B , p. 4 A total of 3,535 dunums of land were allocated to cereals; 299 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics.

Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 168 =1948 and aftermath= Abil al-Qamh was captured and depopulated on May 10, 1948 by the First Battalion of the Palmach commanded by Yigal Allon in Operation Yifatch. There was no fighting in the village, but after the fall of Safad to Israel and from a \\"whispering campaign\\" by local Jewish leaders to the heads of Arab villages (makhatir) warning them of massive Jewish reinforcements arriving in the Galilee, the residents of Abil al-Qamh fled. In 1952, Israel established the town of Yuval on village lands, from the village site. The site itself is \\"overgrown with grasses and weeds. A grove of trees stands in the northeast corner, and stones from destroyed houses are strewn throughout the site...,\\" according to Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi in 1992.Khalidi, 1992, pp.428-429. In recent years, the Lebanese Authorities has claimed that Abil al-Qamh and six other depopulated Shia villages along the border belong to Lebanon.Lamb, Franklin.

It was a small and light biplane with a conventional wheeled undercarriage intended to operate from platforms on small ships, but while it had good handling, an unreliable and underpowered engine meant that the aircraft did not enter production, with only one prototype being completed. In 2014, a replica Kitten ‚Äì originally started in the 1980s ‚Äì was completed by enthusiasts at the Yorkshire Air Museum.York Express newspaper article, (Retrieved 4 Mar 2014) Design and development In 1916, the British Admiralty produced a requirement for a small single seater fighter landplane intended to fly off short platforms on the forecastle of the Royal Navy's Destroyers and other small ships to provide a widely distributed airship interceptor. Orders were placed with the RNAS Experimental Flight at Eastchurch and the Marine Aircraft Experimental Department at Port Victoria on the Isle of Grain for single prototypes to meet this requirement.Collyer 1991, p.52. G.H. Millar, the chief technical officer of the Eastchurch flight, designed a small, angular, single- bay biplane, named the Eastchurch Kitten, powered by the required 45 hp (34 kW) ABC Gnat engine. It was larger and heavier than the Isle of Grain design, with equi-span upper and lower wings, which had bracing wires that ran from the wings through the undercarriage axle to the opposite wing. Initially it had no fixed horizontal tailplane, being fitted with a balanced elevator. Armament was a single Lewis gun mounted to the top wing.Bruce 1965, p.183. The Eastchurch Kitten was part built when Harry Busteed, the commander of the Eastchurch Experimental Flight, was posted to the Isle of Grain to take command of the Marine Aircraft Experimental Department, taking Millar and the part built Eastchurch Kitten with him to Port Victoria for completion.Mason 1992, p.110. The Eastchurch Kitten was given the designation P.V.8, with the competing Port Victoria designed P.V.7, named the Grain Kitten, flying first in June 1917. The Eastchurch Kitten did not fly until 7 September 1917, powered by a 35 hp (26 kW) ungeared Gnat engine, as the originally planned engine was unavailable.Mason 1992, p.111. After this first flight, when it was found to be unstable, it was fitted with a small fixed tailplane with revised elevators. Thus modified, it had superior performance and handling to the Grain Kitten, but was similarly plagued by the terrible unreliability of the Gnat.Bruce 1965, p.184‚Äì185. Official testing praised the view for the pilot and the handling but considered the aircraft too fragile for regular use.Bruce 1965, p.185‚Äì186. No orders followed, with adapted versions of the Sopwith Camel, operating both from aircraft carriers and from lighters towed behind destroyers being used instead. The Eastchurch Kitten was packed for dispatch to the United States of America in March 1918 for evaluation, but it is uncertain whether it was actually dispatched.Green and Swanborough 1994, p.480.

Situated on rising land immediately behind the Royal Yacht Squadron it is prominently displayed to passing yachtsmen and its tiered gardens afford marvelous views over the busy waters of the Solent. It is constructed of Isle of Wight yellow brick in the gothic style with 100 feet long nave walls, 12 external buttresses, and a castellated tower. Inside, the pillar less nave is remarkably light and airy. The Church was consecrated as a place of worship on Cowes foreshore for sailors and seafarers and it very soon acquired a Royal and yachting patronage which has continued from Queen Victoria to the present day. The nave bears a number of memorial plaques honouring past members of the Royal Yacht Squadron and in the gardens stands the Fastnet Memorial. This rock sculpture was erected in memory of sailors who were killed in the storm which struck the 1979 Fastnet race. Parish status The church is grouped with St Mary the Virgin Church, Cowes.

The exceptional script of this, a great example of the genre of the Wiener Film, was by Walter Reisch and Willi Forst, who also directed. The German premiere was held in Berlin on 21 August 1934, the Austrian premiere in Vienna not until 26 September of the same year.  Plot  The film is set in Viennese high society of about 1900. After a masked carnival ball, Gerda Harrandt (Hilde von Stolz), wife of the surgeon Carl Ludwig Harrandt (Peter Petersen), allows the fashionable artist Ferdinand von Heidenick (Adolf Wohlbr√ºck)later better known in the English-speaking cinema as Anton Walbrook to paint a portrait of her wearing only a mask and a muff. This muff however belongs to Anita Keller (Olga Tschechowa), in secret the painter's lover but also the fianc√©e of the court orchestra director Paul Harrandt (Walter Janssen), the brother of Gerda's husband. The picture is published in the newspaper. When Paul sees it and asks von Heidenick some searching questions about the identity of the model, the artist is forced to improvise a story and on the spur of the moment invents a woman called Leopoldine Dur as the alleged model. Leopoldine Dur however turns out to be a real woman (Paula Wessely), whose acquaintance Heidenick makes shortly afterwards. This makes his lover Anita so jealous that she shoots him. He survives, and Leopoldine nurses him back to health, in the course of which they fall in love. The true identity of the sitter in the portrait remains a mystery, however.  Background  In February 1934, in the middle of the brief Austrian Civil War, Walter Reisch and Willi Forst wrote the screenplay of Maskerade in the Hotel Kranz- Ambassador in Vienna. Filming began in the same month in the Rosenh√ºgel Film Studios of Sascha-Film. It was only the second film directed by Willi Forst, but is nevertheless one of his masterpieces. It was also the first ever film role for the already distinguished stage actress Paula Wessely.  Production  Since the microphones of the period were not very sensitive, they had to be brought as close to the performers as possible. Because of the visible shadows that the microphones would have cast under the intense lighting of the film sets they had to be hidden in many scenes behind all sorts of objects such as armchairs, bookshelves and vases. The actors had nevertheless to be constantly instructed to speak louder, which caused a number of problems in scenes in which by their nature it was necessary to speak quietly. Essential to the visual success of the film was the contribution of the virtuoso of the film camera of 1930s Austria, Franz Planer, with his lively and beautifully lit compositions. The sets were the creation of Oskar Strnad, a great name of the contemporary Austrian art scene and lecturer at the School of Commercial Art (Wiener Kunstgewerbeschule, now the Universit√§t f√ºr angewandte Kunst Wien), assisted by Emil Stepanek. Strnad's costume designs however were passed over by Forst in favour of those by Gerdago, whose dress for Paula Wessely contributed both to the success of the film and to Wessely's breakthrough into films. Willy Schmidt-Gentner composed the score. The declared production costs were 863,539,45 Austrian Schillings.  Remakes  = Escapade= Because of the film's great success it was remade in America in 1935 under the title Escapade. =Operetta= At the end of the 1970s Reisch wrote an operetta based on the film of Maskerade with his cousin Georg Kreisler, who composed the music.Kreisler had already worked with Reisch in Hollywood in 1946 on the film Song of Scheherazade (Robert Stolz had initially been commissioned for the music but died in 1975 aged 95, just after he had begun work on it). The premiere took place in 1983 during the Wiener Festwochen in the Theater in der Josefstadt under Kreisler's musical direction, and the piece ran for two seasons to packed houses; it has never been performed since. Reisch did not live to see it performed, as he fell ill and died in Los Angeles on 28 March 1983.

History  Sources published in the late 20th century claim that this station opened on Sunday 28 February 1909, which would have been highly unlikely given Scotland's sabbatarian culture at the time. Contemporary sources, such as railway notices, timetables, maps and Post Office Directories, show that the station existed nearly 30 years before that date. When the station opened, on 1 July 1879, it allowed Caledonian Railway trains from Edinburgh and Lanarkshire, which had previously terminated at to reach Bridge Street to connect with trains for Greenock and Wemyss Bay, with through carriages being provided from Edinburgh to stations on the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway and Greenock and Wemyss Bay Railway.Caledonian Railway notice in Glasgow Herald, 1 July 1879 These continued to terminate at Bridge Street even after Central Station had opened on 1 August 1879.Notice from Caledonian Railway, published in Glasgow Herald, 1 August 1879 On 19 March 1883, there was a collision between two trains at Eglinton Street station in which four people died and many more were injured.The People's History of Glasgow, 1899, page 38 The crash involved the 6:15pm train from Central Station to East Kilbride and the 5pm train from Edinburgh to Glasgow Central, which had stopped at Eglinton Street Station. The driver of the Edinburgh train failed to heed the signal against the train leaving the station. The East Kilbride train had left Central on time and had a clear signal to proceed. It was slowing down when it collided with the Edinburgh train which was getting up steam. The drivers and firemen of both trains survived the crash, having been violently thrown from their engines.Glasgow Herald, 20 March 1883 Opened by the Caledonian Railway on the former routes of the Cathcart District Railway and Polloc and Govan Railway on the southern approached to Glasgow Central, Eglinton Street station became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway during the Grouping of 1923. The station was located in the routes to the: * Two platforms - Cathcart Circle, the Barrhead, East Kilbride and Kilmarnock lines * Four platforms - West Coast Main Line The station was closed in 1965.

Nikolaus Pevsner The land was given by Thomas Chamberlayne Esq., of Cranberry Park. On 6 September 1831, the twelve-year-old Princess Victoria laid the foundation stone of the new church. Construction of the church was completed by 1833 and on 12 July 1833, Princess Victoria and her mother the Duchess of Kent attended the consecration service by Charles Richard Sumner the Bishop of Winchester. The total cost of the build was ¬£3,000. Between 1864 and 1868, the church was greatly enlarged and altered by the architect Thomas Hellyer. In 1870, the chancel was added, as well as a private chapel. In June 2009, a new project started allowing the congregation of the church to meet before services to have breakfast together.

He was active in his native country when the west Africa country of Republic of Benin was called Dahomey. Spending almost his entire adult life outside his native country, he worked for the World Health Organization in Brazzaville. In the 1968 presidential election, he won with over 80 percent of the vote. This decision was annulled, however, by incumbent President Alphonse Alley because organised demonstrations prohibited almost three-quarters of the electorate from casting their ballots. Early life Moumouni graduated from the Victor Segalen Bordeaux 2 University of Bordeaux as a Doctor of Medicine Moumouni was born in Cotonou on October 25, 1922.. Moumouni graduated from the Victor Segalen Bordeaux 2 University of the University of Bordeaux in France with a Doctorate of Medicine, and later qualified as a Master of Public Health and Science, obtained respectively in Montreal, Quebec, Canada and Chicago, United States. After his university studies, Moumouni returned to Cotonou, where he practised as a physician until 1959, and would later spend much of his adult life outside Dahomey's borders.. When independence was obtained, Moumouni was appointed Director of the Ministry of Health for his country. From 1963 to 1968, he worked for the World Health Organization in Brazzaville, Congo. 1968 presidential election Moumouni was one of five candidates in his country's presidential election held on May 15, 1968. He was heavily backed by supporters of former premier Justin Ahomadegb√©-Tom√™tin and won the election with 83 percent of the vote,. and 241,120 ballots of 289,079 cast. This made Moumouni the first democratically elected president of Dahomey since January 1964. However, only 27.6 percent of eligible voters actually voted. The election results were annulled by President Alphonse Amadou Alley because organised demonstrations prohibited almost three-quarters of the electorate from casting their ballots. Medical journalism Moumoni returned to Brazzaville after the elections. He would continue with his medical research, particularly into public health services, publishing numerous books in collaboration with other distinguished physicians. In 1970, along with people such as L. Atayi and L. Charles, he published the book in Brazzaville, Une Conception int√©gr√©e des services de sant√© publique dans la R√©gion africaine., a study of current public health issues within the Africa region, working for the Bureau r√©gional de l'Afrique. Mounmouni rejoined the World Health Organization and continued to publish his studies into African public health. In 1985 he collaborated with others once again to publish the book, Trainer's guide for health management: strengthening of public health delivery systems in Central and West Africa. published under the WHO. Later life Moumouni retired from his medical career in 1991. Following this, he would continue as a writer, broadening his writing to cover topics such as politics and government, socio-economic conditions and even the history of Benin. On June 14, 2007, Moumouni released his book Pour un B√©nin m√©tamorphos√©, la Nation que nous voulons, a book which examined political and socio-economic conditions in Benin since 1960. He worked on the book for seven years. The book was critically acclaimed, Professor Felix Iroko calling it Moumouni's victory on adversity. Moumouni was also a professor at the University of Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo and for the Harvard Institute for International Development. He died in November 2019 at the age of 97.

It is a large brick structure with a two-story central section featuring a cylindrical tower with a domed cap and one-story wings extending from each end along the railroad tracks. It was designed by Baldwin and Pennington, and built in 1884 by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad across the tracks and a meadow from the Railroad's Oakland Hotel, which opened in 1876, to support the development of Oakland and Garrett County as a resort area. It is one of the finest remaining examples in Maryland of a Queen Anne style railroad station. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974 as the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Station, Oakland. It was revived for service on Amtrak's Shenandoah between 1976 and 1981.

Venetian possessions are in green and orange. By 1463, the Ottoman dominions would have expanded to include the Byzantine Empire (purple), and most of the smaller Balkan states. The First Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War was fought between the Republic of Venice and her allies and the Ottoman Empire from 1463 to 1479. Fought shortly after the capture of Constantinople and the remnants of the Byzantine Empire by the Ottomans, it resulted in the loss of several Venetian holdings in Albania and Greece, most importantly the island of Negroponte (Euboea), which had been a Venetian protectorate for centuries. The war also saw the rapid expansion of the Ottoman navy, which became able to challenge the Venetians and the Knights Hospitaller for supremacy in the Aegean Sea. In the closing years of the war, however, the Republic managed to recoup its losses by the de facto acquisition of the Crusader Kingdom of Cyprus.  Background  Following the Fourth Crusade (1203‚Äì1204), the lands of the Byzantine Empire were divided among several western Catholic (\\"Latin\\") Crusader states, ushering in the period known in Greek as Latinokratia. Despite the resurgence of the Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty in the later 13th century, many of these \\"Latin\\" states survived until the rise of a new power, the Ottoman Empire. Chief among these was the Republic of Venice, which had founded an extensive maritime empire, controlling numerous coastal possessions and islands in the Adriatic, Ionian, and Aegean Seas. In its first conflict with the Ottomans, Venice had already lost the city of Thessalonica in 1430, following a long siege, but the resulting peace treaty left the other Venetian possessions intact.Finkel (2006), pp. 40‚Äì41 In 1453, the Ottomans captured the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, and continued to expand their territories in the Balkans, Asia Minor, and the Aegean. Serbia was conquered in 1459, and the last Byzantine remnants, the Despotate of Morea and the Empire of Trebizond were subdued in 1460‚Äì1461.Finkel (2006), pp. 60‚Äì62 The Venetian-controlled Duchy of Naxos and the Genoese colonies of Lesbos and Chios became tributary in 1458, only for the latter to be directly annexed four years later.Finkel (2006), p. 60 The Ottoman advance thus inevitably posed a threat to Venice's holdings in southern Greece, and, following the Ottoman conquest of Bosnia in 1463, in the Adriatic coast as well.Finkel (2006), p. 63Shaw (1976), pp. 64‚Äì65  Outbreak of the war  According to the Greek historian Michael Critobulus, hostilities broke out because of the flight of an Albanian slave of the Ottoman commander of Athens to the Venetian fortress of Coron (Koroni) with 100,000 silver aspers from his master's treasure. The fugitive then converted to Christianity, and demands for his rendition by the Ottomans were therefore refused by the Venetian authorities.Setton (1978), p. 241 Using this as a pretext, in November 1462, Turahanoƒülu √ñmer Bey, the Ottoman commander in central Greece, attacked and nearly succeeded in taking the strategically important Venetian fortress of Lepanto (Nafpaktos). On 3 April 1463 however, the governor of the Morea, Isa- Beg Ishakoviƒá, took the Venetian-held town of Argos by treason. Although Venice, dependent on the trade with the Ottomans, had in the past been reluctant to confront them in war, the urgings of the papal legate, Cardinal Bessarion, and an impassioned speech by the distinguished Council member Vettore Cappello, tipped the balance, and on 28 July, the Senate narrowly voted for declaring war on the Porte.Setton (1978), p. 243 Pope Pius II used this opportunity to form yet another Crusade against the Ottomans: on 12 September 1463, Venice and Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus signed an alliance, followed on 19 October by an alliance with the Pope and Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy. According to its terms, upon victory, the Balkans would be divided among the allies. The Morea and the western Greek coast (Epirus) would fall to Venice, Hungary would acquire Bulgaria, Serbia, Bosnia, and Wallachia, the Albanian principality under Skanderbeg would expand into Macedonia, and the remaining European territories of the Ottomans, including Constantinople, would form a restored Byzantine Empire under the surviving members of the Palaiologos family.Shaw (1976), p. 65 Negotiations were also begun with other rivals of the Ottomans, such as Karamanids, Uzun Hassan, and the Crimean Khanate.  Campaigns in the Morea and the Aegean, 1463‚Äì1466  The new alliance launched a two-pronged offensive against the Ottomans: a Venetian army, under the Captain General of the Sea Alvise Loredan, landed in the Morea, while Matthias Corvinus invaded Bosnia. At the same time, Pius II began assembling an army at Ancona, hoping to lead it in person. Map of the Morea in the Middle Ages In early August, the Venetians retook Argos and refortified the Isthmus of Corinth, restoring the Hexamilion wall and equipping it with many cannons.Setton (1978), p. 248 They then proceeded to besiege the fortress of the Acrocorinth, which controlled the northwestern Peloponnese. The Venetians engaged in repeated clashes with the defenders and with √ñmer Bey's forces, until they suffered a major defeat on 20 October, which resulted in the wounding and subsequent death of the Marquis (son of Taddeo d'Este). The Venetians were then forced to lift the siege and retreat to the Hexamilion and to Nauplia (Nafplion). In Bosnia, Matthias Corvinus seized over sixty fortified places and succeeded in taking its capital, Jajce after a 3-month siege, on 16 December.Setton (1978), p. 250 Ottoman reaction was swift and decisive: Sultan Mehmed II dispatched his Grand Vizier, Mahmud Pasha Angeloviƒá, with an army against the Venetians. To confront the Venetian fleet, which had taken station outside the entrance of the Dardanelles Straits, the Sultan further ordered the creation of the new shipyard of Kadirga Limani in the Golden Horn (named after the \\"kadirga\\" type of galley), and of two forts to guard the Straits, Kilidulbahr and Sultaniye.Setton, Hazard & Norman (1969), p. 326 The Morean campaign was swiftly victorious for the Ottomans: although messages received from √ñmer Bey had warned of the strength and firepower of the Venetian position at the Hexamilion, Mahmud Pasha decided to march on, hoping to catch them unawares. In the event, the Ottomans reached the Isthmus just in time to see the Venetian army, demoralized and riddled with dysentery, leave its positions and sail to Nauplia.Setton (1978), p. 249 The Ottoman army razed the Hexamilion, and advanced into the Morea. Argos fell, and several forts and localities that had recognized Venetian authority reverted to their Ottoman allegiance. Zagan Pasha was re-appointed governor of the Morea, while √ñmer Bey was given Mahmud Pasha's army and tasked with taking the Republic's holdings in the southern Peloponnese, centered around the two forts of Coron and Modon (Methoni). Sultan Mehmed II, who was following Mahmud Pasha with another army to reinforce him, had reached Zeitounion (Lamia) before being apprised of his Vizier's success. Immediately, he turned his men north, towards Bosnia. However, the Sultan's attempt to retake Jajce in July and August 1464 failed, with the Ottomans retreating hastily in the face of Corvinus' approaching army. A new Ottoman army under Mahmud Pasha then forced Corvinus to withdraw, but Jajce was not retaken for many years after. However, the death of Pope Pius II on 15 August in Ancona spelled the end of the Crusade.Setton (1978), p. 270 condottiere Sigismondo Malatesta, Lord of Rimini. His tenure in command of the land forces in the Morea (July 1464 to January 1466) failed to reverse the Republic's fortunes. In the meantime, for the upcoming campaign of 1464, the Republic had appointed Sigismondo Malatesta, the ruler of Rimini and one of the ablest Italian generals, as land commander in the Morea.Setton (1978), pp. 251‚Äì252 The forces available to him along with mercenaries and stratioti, however, were limited, and in his tenure in the Morea he was unable to achieve much. Upon his arrival in the Morea in mid-summer, he launched attacks against Ottoman forts, and engaged in a siege of Mistra in August‚ÄìOctober. He failed to take the castle, however, and had to abandon the siege at the approach of a relief force under √ñmer Bey.Setton (1978), pp. 252‚Äì253 Small-scale warfare continued on both sides, with raids and counter-raids, but a shortage of manpower and money meant that the Venetians remained largely confined to their fortified bases, while √ñmer Bey's army roamed the countryside. The mercenaries and stratioti in Venice's employ were becoming disgruntled at the lack of pay, while increasingly, the Morea was becoming desolate, as villages were abandoned and fields left untended.Setton (1978), pp. 253‚Äì255 The bad supply situation in the Morea forced √ñmer Bey to withdraw to Athens in fall 1465.Setton (1978), p. 284 Malatesta himself, disenchanted by the conditions he encountered in the Morea and increasingly anxious to return to Italy and attend to his family's affairs and the ongoing feud with the Papacy, remained largely inactive throughout 1465, in spite of the relative weakness of the Ottoman garrisons following the withdrawal of √ñmer Bey from the peninsula.Setton (1978), pp. 255‚Äì257 In the Aegean, the new Venetian admiral, Orsato Giustinian, tried to take Lesbos in the spring of 1464, and besieged the capital Mytilene for six weeks, until the arrival of an Ottoman fleet under Mahmud Pasha on 18 May forced him to withdraw.Setton (1978), p. 251 Another attempt to capture the island shortly after also failed, and Giustinian died at Modon on 11 July. His successor, Jacopo Loredan, spent the remainder of the year in ultimately fruitless demonstrations of force before the Dardanelles. In early 1465, Mehmed II sent peace feelers to the Venetian Senate in 1465. Distrusting the Sultan's motives, these were rejected.Setton (1978), p. 273 Soon after, the Venetians were embroiled in a conflict with the Knights Hospitaller of Rhodes, who had attacked a Venetian convoy carrying Moorish merchants from the Mamluk Sultanate.Setton (1978), p. 277 This event enraged the Mamluks, who imprisoned all Venetian subjects living in the Levant, and threatened to enter the war on the Ottoman side. The Venetian fleet, under Loredan, sailed to Rhodes under orders to release the Moors, even by force. In the event, a potentially catastrophic war between the two major Christian powers of the Aegean was avoided, and the merchants were released to Venetian custody. By 1465 the Maniot Kladas brothers, Krokodelos and Epifani, were leading bands of stratioti on behalf of Venice against the Turks in Southern Peloponnese. They put Vardounia and their lands into Venetian possession, for which Epifani then acted as governor. In April 1466, Vettore Cappello, the most vociferous proponent of the war, replaced Loredan as Captain General of the Sea. Under his leadership, the Venetian war effort was reinvigorated: the fleet took the northern Aegean islands of Imbros, Thasos and Samothrace, and then sailed into the Saronic Gulf. On 12 July, Cappello landed at Piraeus, and marched against Athens, the Ottomans' major regional base. He failed to take the Acropolis, however, and was forced to retreat to Patras, which was being besieged by the Venetians under the provveditore of the Morea, Jacopo Barbarigo. Before Cappello could arrive there, and as the city seemed on the verge of falling, Omar Beg suddenly appeared with 12,000 cavalry, and drove the outnumbered Venetians off. Six hundred Venetians fell and a hundred were taken prisoner out of a force of 2,000, while Barbarigo himself was killed, and his body impaled. Cappello, who arrived some days later, attacked the Ottomans trying to avenge this disaster, but was heavily defeated. Demoralized, he returned to Negroponte with the remains of his army. There, the Captain General fell ill, and died on 13 March 1467.Setton (1978), pp. 284‚Äì285  The war in Albania, 1466‚Äì1467  In spring 1466, Sultan Mehmed marched with a large army against the Albanians. Under their leader, Skenderbeg, they had long resisted the Ottomans, and had repeatedly sought assistance from Italy. For the Albanians, the outbreak of the Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War offered a golden opportunity to reassert their independence; for the Venetians, they provided a useful cover to the Venetian coastal holdings of Durazzo and Scutari. Notable Montenegrin feudal lord Ivan Crnojeviƒá was of high significance for the defence of Scutari, for which he gained fame in Venice. The major result of this campaign was the construction of the fortress of Elbasan, allegedly within just 25 days. This strategically-sited fortress, at the lowlands near the end of the old Via Egnatia, cut Albania effectively in half, isolating Skenderbeg's base in the northern highlands from the Venetian holdings in the south.Finkel (2006), p. 64 However, following the Sultan's withdrawal Skanderbeg himself spent the winter in Italy, seeking aid. On his return in early 1467, his forces sallied from the highlands, defeated Ballaban Pasha and lifted the siege of the fortress of Croia (Kruj√´), attacked Elbasan but failed to capture it.Setton, Hazard & Norman (1969), p. 327Setton (1978), p. 278 Mehmed II responded by marching again against Albania. He energetically pursued the attacks against the Albanian strongholds, while sending detachments to raid the Venetian possessions to keep them isolated. The Ottomans failing again to take Croia, and they failed to subjugate the country but they overthrow Tomornitsa. However, the winter brought an outbreak of plague, which would recur annually and sap the strength of the local resistance.Setton (1978), p. 283 Skanderbeg himself died of malaria in the Venetian stronghold of Lissus (Lezh√´), ending the ability of Venice to use the Albanian lords for its own advantage. The Albanians were left to their own devices, and were gradually subdued over the next decade.  Final Albanian campaigns, 1474‚Äì1479  After Skanderbeg died, some Venetian-controlled northern Albanian garrisons continued to hold territories coveted by the Ottomans, such as ≈Ωabljak Crnojeviƒáa, Drisht, Lezha, and Shkodra‚Äîthe most significant. Mehmed II sent his armies to take Shkodra in 1474 but failed. Then he went personally to lead the siege of Shkodra of 1478-79. The Venetians and Shkodrans resisted the assaults and continued to hold the fortress until Venice ceded Shkodra to the Ottoman Empire in the Treaty of Constantinople on 25 January 1479 as a condition of ending the war. After the Venetian War the Ottomans attacked Hungary, but their army was defeated in the Battle of Breadfield.

History The school was founded in Roubaix (Nord-Pas de Calais, France) with municipal funding. It was originally meant to provide a special studying program for the requirements of the textile industry at Roubaix and France. After 1889, the institution became known as the √âcole d'Arts et M√©tiers Textiles. Because the school was near from the war front, it was closed in some wartime periods (World War I and World War II), many students and academic staff died in these wars. Nowadays, the ENSAIT has a very large parc of machinery. In 1991, the GEMTEX was inaugurated as the first French center with research competence in all textile engineering fields. Entrepreneurship is also promoted with GENI-INNOTEX.  Student life  Since the ENSAIT foundation, the students perpetuate their own traditions and folklore, and are members of a student society. They call themselves \\"AIT\\" . The \\"BDE\\" folklore includes traditional clothing, language, songs and legends, related symbolism, and ceremonials. BDE activities are independent of the administration of the school and are exclusively run by the students, although the two parts often cooperate for organising cultural or sporting events.

He became acting chief editor in 1967 and the chief editor in 1968, remaining in that role for 27 years until he retired in 1996. He also established a record as the longest serving editor in Bennett Coleman and Co. which owns the Times of India Group. The company is more than 150 years old. In Loksatta & Maharashtra Times he wrote around 8000 editorials during his tenure, which is a record in itself. In addition, he wrote articles on diverse subjects of national and international importance and educated his readers. The newspaper acquired the status of a legend during his tenure. In the impact that his writings had on Maharashtrian society, Talwalkar has been compared to Bal Gangadhar Tilak. In the history of Marathi journalism, there have been two great epochs, the Age of Tilak and the Age of Talwalkar Such was his influence on the social, political, economic, educational, cultural and intellectual life of Maharashtra. Several readers acknowledge that they learnt what to read and how to think rationally because of him. He was a visionary editor, a man of ideas, who gave a new direction to Marathi journalism. He believed that the pursuit of knowledge and science, public service and moral foundation were the key to achieving greatness for a national. He edited his paper with this agenda and encouraged his readers to follow these principles. Talwalkar is best known for his editorials and articles. According to Raj Thackeray, \\"Talwalkar justified being recognized as Agralekhancha Badshah (the emperor of editorials)\\". Late famous Marathi writer, journalist and intellectual, S. M. Mate. admiringly remarked that Talwalkar had a felicity of pen, while poet G. D. Madgulkar used to call him \\"DnyanMurti\\" and \\"DnyanGunSagar\\".Amche Vachaspati Baba, an article on Govind Talwalkar by Dr. Nirupama G. Talwalkar, published in Lalit magazine, July 2005 In the tradition of Lokmanya Tilak & the Maharashtrian saint Samarth Ramdas, he used simple Marathi to make difficult subjects easily understandable to ordinary readers, while at the same time making all salient points with notable gravitas. Several of his editorials and articles are collected in his books, including Agralekh, Bahar, Pushpanjali, Lal gulag ('Red Gulag'), Niyatishi karar. Shri Govind Talwalkar had been a Guiding Light for three generations of Maharashtrians. He had the greatest influence over the literary, political, educational, social, cultural and intellectual fabric of post-independence Maharashtra over fifty years. As an editor, he made his mark as an intellectual, interested in diverse subjects. He educated his readers. In the words of famous economist Nani Palkhiwala, he was an institution. Poet Kusumagraj noted that Talwalkar was doing a great public service by educating the masses through his newspaper and setting an example in excellence, promoting good reading, writing and diverse and original ideas. He was best known for his editorials, which appealed to the reason. His hard- hitting editorials were feared but respected by the politicians and people in powerful places; and immensely admired by the masses and the scholars. In this he followed the tradition of Lokmanya Tilak. He did so selflessly, without expecting any Padma award, a seat on Rajya Sabha or anything for that matter. He had no party affiliation. He was admired by his readers across the ideological spectrum, and feared by politicians across the ideological spectrum as well. He set the tone of discussion in Maharashtra and threw light on the plight of the land-less labour, famine conditions, dams, agriculture, banking, economic reforms, refugee problem and problems facing the universities, need to abolish superstition, need for social justice for the downtrodden and many important issues. He was committed to the idea of secularism. He exposed corruption in politics, universities, hospitals, social and public matters. Under his editorship Maharashtra Times was rightly regarded as a broad intellectual forum. Talwalkar was in high esteem for his honesty, integrity, courage and intellectual contribution to the society. To him goes a large share of credit for nourishing Maharashtrians' moral universe and keeping politicians on a tight leash. He stood for credibility. It is said that some politicians have blocked giving him PadmaVibhushan award, while honouring many undeserving people. Though proud of his mother-tongue, Marathi, Talwalkar thought that his readers should know the best literature in various languages. He started a popular column introducing books in English, writing under the pseudonym Vachaspati. They were not just book reviews. He wrote a critical essay on the book and that subject, thereby enlightening the readers on that subject matter, and encouraging them to read and widening their intellectual horizon. His articles on books have been published as collections ‚Äì Vachta vachta, Granthasangati, Sourabh. On his retirement in 1996, Talwalkar and his wife Shakuntala settled with their daughters in the United States, but continued to write critical articles and essays in Marathi and English on world politics, economics, history, social issues and books. He died on 21 March 2017 at the age of 91. He helped generously to people in need and donated for public causes over the years. He donated his precious collection of 5000 books to the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute in Pune, where they are placed in a special memorial hall named after him on his first birth anniversary in 2017. He had previously donated several thousand other books to libraries. Author of books on modern history of India and the world Talwalkar was a scholar as well as a writer. His books were based on deep research. He has written several books on the modern history of India. His book on the constitutional aspects of transfer of power in India - Sattantar:1947, vol 1,2,3 - is now in its third edition. This book as well as his other books Naoroji te Nehru, Niyatishi Karar, Gandhi Parva (vol 1 and 2) encompass the freedom movement of India, for the transfer of power from the British, with the historical, economic and cultural perspective and lucid analysis. They are considered very important for the study of that period for scholars as well as general public. Many of Talwalkar's books are on the leaders of India's freedom movement : Justice Ranade, Tilak, Gopal Krishna Gokhale. Like Gokhale, Talwalkar was a social reformer and a patriot. The books Naoroji te Nehru; Virat dnyani:Nyaymurti Ranade; Tilak darshan; Bal Gangadhar Tilak received various awards. He translated his Marathi book Nek Namdar Gokhale into English, entitled, Gopal Krishna Gokhale: Life and Times, published by Rupa and Co. The Tribune's review of Gopal Krishna Gokhale: Life and Times praises Talwalkar as \\"a versatile journalist\\", and describes the book as a \\"comprehensive study\\" with a \\"lucid and straightforward\\" narrative. Talwalkar made further changes to this book in English. This new book entitled Gopal Krishna Gokhale:Gandhi's Political Guru was published by the Pentagon Press. The Hindu's review of Gopal Krishna Gokhale:Gandhi's political guru notes that in addition to being a classic biography of Gokhale, it is also an in-depth study of the country's freedom struggle in the early stages; and skillfully locates Gokhale's work in the context of his times. Talwalkar's book Bharat Ani JagMouj prakashan is a scholarly analysis of India's foreign policy and economic and political situation in the post-independence era (i.e. since 1947). It is a valuable reference book. Talwalkar was the author of books on the wars in Iraq & Afghanistan ‚Äì Iraqdahan, Agnikand. His books have been well received for their wealth of information, insight, scholarship and style. He wrote fluently in Marathi as well as English. He always wrote in beautiful, cultured, decent Marathi in the tradition of Lokmanya Tilak & Ramdas Swami, making even very difficult and scholarly topics easy for the common people to understand. His books are a treasure trove of scholarship and a great joy to read. Freethinker, writer on the Soviet empire, China and communism From the 1950s, India sought economic and technological help from the Soviet Union. When it was fashionable to be a communist, Talwalkar remained an independent and wrote against the totalitarianism of the Right as well as the Left. He was steeped in the humanist thoughts of M. N. Roy, George Orwell, Karl Pauper, Arthur Koestler, and Kolakowsky. In fact, he had predicted the fall of Soviet Union long before other experts. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Talwalkar toured Eastern Europe and wrote journalistic essays on the changing scene. These are collected in his book ‚Äì Badalta Europe.Majestic prakashan He was a scholar of Russian studies. He wrote a four volume book in Marathi on the rise and fall of the Soviet empire: Soviet Samrajyacha Uday Ani Asta, winning the Kelkar prize. His book Lal Gulag is a collection of his articles on communist Russia and China.Popular prakashan Journalist Talwalkar contributed articles in English to newspapers including The Times of India, The Telegraph (of Calcutta), The Illustrated Weekly of India, Frontline magazine, The Mainstream and the Deccan Herald, The Tribune (Chandigarh), Outlookindia and Asian Age . He regularly wrote articles in Marathi for a literary magazine Lalit. After retirement he wrote a regular column ‚Äì Saurabh ‚Äì in Lalit each month on books & other topics such as 400th anniversary of saint Ramdas Swami. These articles are published by Majestic prakashan under the title Sourabh, vol. 1 & 2\\\\. Grantha Sangati is another collection of his book reviews published by Popular Prakashan. He has received the Durga Ratan and B.D. Goenka Awards for excellence in journalism, and the Ramshatri Award for social justice. After retirement, Talwalkar wrote regularly for the daily, Divya Marathi and weekly Sadhana and occasionally for Maharashtra Times and other Marathi newspapers, and in English for The Tribune (Chandigarh), The Asian Age. Talwalkar continued original research right till the end. In 2016 he obtained original papers from Japan and Russia and proved that the freedom fighter Subhas Chandra Bose did die in the aeroplane crash. He wrote articles in the Tribune (Chandigarh) which finally put to rest the controversy surrounding Subhas Babu's death. Bose's grand nephew Ashis Ray uploaded this very important information on the website he specially created and devoted to Subhas Bose.

Overview Prior, often called by his second name, is an intelligent, deeply cynical soldier whom we first meet recovering from shell shock at Craiglockhart. At the beginning of Regeneration he is temporarily mute, having found the detached eye of a dead comrade in the trenches, and mainly communicates through writing with pen and paper. However, he eventually overcomes this through counselling with Dr. W. H. R. Rivers, the historical psychologist who features prominently in all three novels. His relationship with Rivers is problematic and sometimes argumentative. During the trilogy they are at odds over class difference (Billy comes from working class origins), Prior's sardonic treatment of the hospital staff, and Rivers's own moral misgivings about the war. During Regeneration Prior commences a tentative romance with Sarah, a young munitions worker. In The Eye in the Door we discover that he is bisexual, as he has a dalliance with Captain Manning. In the first novel of the series we learn that Prior was emotionally abused by his father, an abrasive wife-beater, an experience that also helped shape the man he would become. Literary significance and criticism Nahem Yousaf and Sharon Monteith called Prior \\"the mobilizing force in the trilogy; not only does he experience the war in phases, his chameleonlike character also facilitates shifts in perspective.\\" Film, TV or theatrical portraits Jonny Lee Miller portrayed Prior in the 1997 film adaptation of Regeneration.

In 1682 Leavitt first served as an Exeter selectman, an office he held several times during his lifetime.New England Families, Genealogical and Memorial, Vol. I, William Richard Cutter, Lewis Historical Publishing Company, New York, 1915 Leavitt was an early signer of an appeal to the King in England to arbitrate the claims of the Masonian proprietors,John Mason, an Englishman who had served as a colonial governor of New Hampshire without having set foot in the province, was an early partner of merchant-adventurer Sir Ferdinando Gorges. After Mason's death, his heirs in England later attempted to assert their ownership claims on New Hampshire lands, enraging settlers who felt they had won their lands by hard-earned labor. who were asserting ownership rights to lands claimed by early settlers.The History of New-Hampshire, Jeremy Belknap, S.

Although nominally independent, the Mongolian People's Republic was a satellite state of the Soviet Union until a third Mongolian revolution in January 1990. The revolution also ended Chinese Beiyang government's occupation of Mongolia, which had existed since 1919. The official Mongolian name of the revolution is \\"People's Revolution of 1921\\" or simply \\"People's Revolution\\" (). Prelude =Mongolian Revolution of 1911= For about three centuries, the Qing dynasty had enforced‚Äîalbeit with mixed success‚Äîa policy of segregating the non-Han peoples on the frontier from Han Chinese. By the end of the 19th century, however, China faced the prospect of being parcelled out among the Western powers and Japan, each competing for its own sphere of influence in the country. On the northern frontier, Russian Empire was viewed by the Qing court as posing the greatest threat to its territorial integrity. In response, the Qing government adopted a different policy, the \\"New Administration\\" or \\"New Policies\\" (Xin zheng), which called for the sinification of Mongolia through Chinese colonisation, the exploitation of Mongolia's natural resources (mining, timber, fishing), military training, and education.Thomas E. Ewing, Ch'ing Policies in Outer Mongolia 1900‚Äì1911, Modern Asian Studies (Cambridge, Eng., 1980), pp. 145-57. Many Mongols regarded the \\"New Policies\\" as a major threat to their traditional way of life, as was agreed to be preserved when they recognised authority of the Qing emperors, and began to seek independence. In July 1911 a group of Khalkha nobles persuaded the Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, the head of Mongolian Buddhism, that Mongolia must declare its independence from the Qing dynasty. They agreed to send a small delegation to Russia to obtain its assistance in this undertaking. In October 1911 revolution broke out in China, with one province after another declaring its independence from the Qing government. On 1 December 1911 Outer Mongolia declared independence, and established a theocracy under the Khutuktu. On 29 December he was installed as the Bogd Khan (Great Khan, or Emperor) of Mongolia.See Thomas E. Ewing, \\"Revolution on the Chinese Frontier: Outer Mongolia in 1911\\", Journal of Asian History (Bloomington, Indiana, 1978), pp. 101‚Äì19. This ushered in the Bogd Khan era, which lasted from 1911 to 1919. =Bogd Khan= The Bogd Khan The new Mongolian government was a fusion of Buddhist theocracy, Qing imperial usages, and 20th century Western political practices. The Bogd Khan assumed the same powers‚Äîsymbolic and real‚Äîof Qing emperors in the past. He adopted a reign title, \\"Elevated by the Many\\"; the Mongolian nobility now owed their tribute to him instead of to the Qing emperor; and the Bogd Khan assumed the right of conferring upon the lay nobles their ranks and seals of office. This new state also reflected the Mongols' desire to reshape their country into a modern state‚Äîthey formed a national parliament composed of two chambers, a government with five ministries, and a national army. The Buddhist religious establishment discovered new opportunities for political gain and financial profit. Despite the presence of a state government, real power lay in the Bogd Khan's court. The religious establishment appropriated revenues for its own purposes. For example, it enlarged its financial holdings by transferring to the religious estate (Ikh shav') wealthy herdsmen who traditionally had owed their services and taxes to lay princes. There is a commonly held misconception that, over time, the greed of the Buddhist religious establishment so disaffected the lay nobility that it came to reject the very principles of theocracy upon which the new country had been founded.Thomas E. Ewing, Between the Hammer and the Anvil. Chinese and Russian Policies in Outer Mongolia, 1911‚Äì1921, (Bloomington, Indiana, 1980), pp. 34‚Äì43. According to Mongolian and Russian sources, the Mongolian society was generally satisfied with the theocracy but there were different views on future development of the country.Kuzmin, S.L. 2011. The History of Baron Ungern. An Experience of Reconstruction. Moscow: KMK Sci. Press, On the diplomatic front, the Mongols worked tirelessly between 1912 and 1915 to win international recognition of a new pan-Mongolian state that would include Inner Mongolia, Western Mongolia, Upper Mongolia, Barga, and Tannu Uriankhai. The Republic of China, for its part, did all it could to re-establish Chinese sovereignty over the country. Russia refused to support full independence for Mongolia; nor would it agree to the restoration of Chinese sovereignty. The matter was settled in 1915 by the tripartite Treaty of Kyakhta (1915), which provided for Mongolian autonomy within the Chinese state and forbade China from sending troops to Mongolia. Both the Chinese and Mongols found the treaty equally dissatisfying, although for different reasons. Abolition of autonomy The outbreak of the Russian Revolution in 1917 and the Russian Civil War a year later changed the Mongolian-Chinese dynamic. In response to rumors of an imminent Bolshevik invasion, the Mongolians, very reluctantly and only after much encouragement by the Chinese High Commissioner Chen Yi at Urga (modern Ulaanbaatar), requested in the summer of 1918 military assistance from China (approximately 200 to 250 troops arrived in September). The invasion in fact did not occur, and so the Bogd Khan's government requested that the troops be recalled. The Beijing government refused, seeing this violation of the Kyakhta Treaty as the first step in restoring Chinese sovereignty over Mongolia.Ewing, Between the Hammer and the Anvil, p. 113. Early in 1919, Grigori Semyonov, a White Guard general, had assembled a group of Buryats and Inner Mongols in Siberia for the formation of a pan-Mongolian state. The Khalkhas were invited to join, but they refused. Semyonov threatened an invasion to force them to participate. This threat galvanized the lay princes, who now saw a larger opportunity: the end of theocratic rule. In August, the Mongolian Foreign Minister approached Chen Yi with a message from the \\"representatives of the four aimags\\" (i.e., the Khalkhas) with a request for military assistance against Semyonov. More importantly, perhaps, it contained a declaration that the Khalkhas were unanimous in their desire to abolish autonomy and restore the previous Qing system.Xu ShuzhengNegotiations, with participation of the Bogd Khan's representatives, began immediately. By October, Chen Yi and the Mongolian princes had agreed upon a set of conditions, the \\"Sixty-four Points\\", effectively recreating the political and administrative system. The \\"Points\\" were submitted to the Parliament. The upper house consented to it; the lower house did not.Ts. Puntsagnorov, Mongolyn avtonomit √ºyeiin t√º√ºkh [The history of Mongolian in the autonomous period], (Ulaanbaatar, 1955), p. 195. However, in this as in all other matters submitted to the Parliament in the past, the upper house prevailed. Chen Yi sent the draft Articles to Beijing. The Bogd Khan dispatched a delegation of lamas to Beijing with a letter stating that the people of Mongolia did not want to abolish autonomy. He wrote that this was all a contrivance of Chen Yi, and he asked that Chen be recalled.Zhung-O guanxi shiliao: Wai Menggu [Sources on Chinese-Russian relations: Outer Mongolia], (Taipei, 1959), no. 386, pp. 573-74. However, the Chinese government was not interested in esoteric arguments whether or not a consensus existed in Mongolia for the abolition of autonomy. The \\"Points\\" were submitted to the Chinese National Assembly, which approved them on October 28.Zhung-O, app. 1, pp. 28-29. Political events then unfolding in China were to fundamentally alter Mongolian history. The Beijing government was controlled by a group of warlords nicknamed the \\"Anhui clique\\" headed by Duan Qirui. The government had come under severe public criticism for its failure at the Paris Peace Conference to obtain a just settlement of the Shandong Problem. There was criticism also of Duan's \\"War-participation army\\", which ostensibly had been formed for service in Europe in the First World War but in fact was used to maintain Duan's internal control. To divert criticism, he simply rechristened his office the \\"Bureau of Frontier Defense\\" and his army the \\"Frontier Defense Army\\". In June 1919, Xu Shuzheng, a prominent member of Duan's clique, was named \\"Northwest Frontier Commissioner\\", making him the senior Chinese military and civilian officer of Outer Mongolia.Li Yushu, Waimeng zhengjiao chidu kao [Study of the Outer Mongolian political system], (Taipei, 1962), p. 237. Earlier, in April, Xu had submitted a plan to the Beijing government for the total social and economic reconstruction of Mongolia, proposing, among other things, that Chinese colonisation and intermarriage between Chinese and Mongolians be encouraged in order to \\"transform the customs of the Mongols\\".Zhung-O, no. 108, pp. 380-84. In short, Xu appeared to want nothing less than the total sinification of Mongolia under his authority. Ceremony marking the abolition of Mongolian autonomy 1920 Chen Yi's Sixty-four Points, which guaranteed Mongolia a kind of autonomy, would have compelled Xu to abandon his plans. This may explain the timing of his personal intervention. Xu arrived in Urga in October accompanied by a military contingent. He informed Chen that the Sixty-four Points would have to be renegotiated based upon a new set of proposals, his \\"Eight Articles\\", which called for an increase in population (presumably through Chinese colonisation) and economic development. Xu presented the Articles to the Bogd Khan with a threat that refusal to ratify them would result in his deportation. The Bogd Khan submitted the Articles to the Mongolian Parliament. As before, the upper house accepted them, while the lower house did not; some members of the lower house even threatened to expel Xu by force. Lamas resisted Xu's plans most of all. But again, the upper house prevailed.L Dendev, Mongolyn tovch t√º√ºkh [A short history of Mongolia], (Ulaanbaatar, 1934), pp. 175-76. On 17 November 1919, Xu accepted a petition‚Äîsigned by the ministers and deputy ministers but not by the Bogd Khan himself‚Äîfor the abolition of autonomy.Zhung-O, no. 414, p. 589. Xu returned to Beijing, where he received a hero's welcome arranged by the Anhui clique. By December, he was back in Urga to organise a formal ceremony for the transfer of authority: soldiers were lined up on either side of the road to the Bogd Khan's palace; the portrait of the President of China was borne on a palanquin; the flag of the Chinese republic followed, and after it a marching band. Mongols were required to prostrate themselves repeatedly before these symbols of Chinese sovereignty.Chen Chungzu, Wai menggu jinshi shi [A modern history of Mongolia], (Shanghai, 1926), bien 3, p. 11. That night, some Mongolian herdsmen and lamas gathered outside the palace and tore down the flags of the Chinese Republic hanging from the gate.A. Kallinikov, U istokov mongol'skoi revolyutsii [Sources of the Mongolian revolution], Khozyaistvo Mongolii, pt. 1, p. 74. Resistance The Russian Consulate in Niislel H√ºree where Bodoo taught and headed the Consular Hill group Between 1919 and early 1920 a few Mongolians came to form what were known later as the \\"Consular Hill\\" (Konsulyn denj) and East Urga (Z√º√ºn kh√ºree) groups.Thomas E. Ewing chronicled the history of these two groups in \\"The Origin of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party: 1920\\", Mongolian Studies (Bloomington, Ind., 1978-79), pp. 79-105. This was the beginning of resistance to Xu and the abolition of autonomy. The first group owed its existence principally to Dogsomyn Bodoo (1885‚Äì1922), a highly educated, 35-year-old lama who worked in the Russian Consulate at Urga during the Bogd Khan era. Sharing a yurt with Bodoo was Khorloogiin Choibalsan (1895‚Äì1953), later to be known as the \\"Stalin of Mongolia\\". A certain Mikhail Kucherenko, a typesetter in the Russo- Mongolian printing office and a member of the Bolshevik underground in Urga, occasionally visited Bodoo and Choibalsan; conversations, no doubt, turned on the Russian revolution and the political situation in Mongolia. In time, other Mongolians joined Bodoo and Choibalsan in discussions over the abolition of autonomy and the failure of Mongolian princes and senior lamas to put up an effective resistance to the Chinese.Kh. Choibalsan, D. Losol, D. Demid, Mongolyn ardyn √ºndesnii khuv'sgal ankh √º√ºseg baiguulagdsan tovch t√º√ºkh [A short history of the Mongolian revolution] (Ulaanbaatar, 1934), v. 1, p. 56. The leaders of the East Urga group were Soliin Danzan (1885‚Äì1924), an official in the Ministry of Finance, and Dansranbilegiin Dogsom (1884‚Äì1939), an official in the Ministry of the Army. Another, albeit less prominent at the time, member was Damdin S√ºkhbaatar (1893‚Äì1923), a soldier in the Mongolian army who, after his death, was canonised by Communist historians as the \\"Lenin of Mongolia\\". The beginning of the East Urga group may be traced to mid- November 1919, when several of the more militant members of the lower house of the Mongolian Parliament, including Danzan and Dogson, met secretly on the first night following its dissolution by Xu Shuzheng, and resolved to resist the Chinese. Twice they approached the Bogd Khan to obtain his support for armed resistance; twice the Khan counselled patience. The group plotted to seize the Mongolian army's arsenal and assassinate Xu Shuzheng; however, the placement of Chinese guards at the arsenal and a revised travel itinerary for Xu thwarted both plans.L. Bat-Ochir, D. Dashjamts, Damdiny Sukhe-Bator. Biografiya [Biography of Damdiny S√ºkhbaatar], (Moscow, 1971), p. 36. Formation of the Mongolian People's Party  Russian expatriates in Urga had elected a revolutionary \\"Municipal Duma\\", headed by Bolshevik sympathisers, which had learned of the Consular Hill group. In early March 1920, the Duma was sending one of its members, I. Sorokovikov, to Irkutsk. It decided that he should also take a report with him about these Mongolians. Sorokovikov met with representatives of the two groups. On his return to Urga in June, he met with them again, promising that the Soviet government would provide \\"assistance of all kinds\\" to the Mongolian \\"workers\\". He invited them to send representatives to Russia for further discussions.G. Kungurov and I. Sorokovikov, Aratskaya revolyutsiya [Herdsmen‚Äôs revolution], (Irkutsk, 1957), p. 84. A new sense of purposefulness now animated both groups. They had maintained a wary distance from one another, perhaps because of their different agendas‚Äîthe Consular Hill group espousing a rather progressive social program while the East Urga group was more nationalistic in its goals‚Äîand there had been little cooperation between the two. The Soviet invitation changed that. The two groups met on 25 June, and formed the \\"Mongolian People's Party\\" (renamed later the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party), adopted a \\"Party Oath\\", and agreed to send Danzan and Choibalsan as delegates to Russia.Choibalsan, Losol, Demid, v. 1, pp. 100-02. Danzan and Choibalsan arrived in Verkhneudinsk, the capital of the pro-Soviet Far Eastern Republic, in the first part of July. They met with Boris Shumyatsky, then acting head of the government. Shumyatsky knew little about them, and for three weeks dodged their demands for a speedy Soviet decision whether or not to provide military assistance to the Mongolians against the Chinese. Finally, perhaps at Shumyatsky's suggestion, they sent a telegram to members of the MPP in Urga with a coded message that they should obtain a letter, stamped with the seal of the Bogd Khan, formally requesting Soviet assistance. The MPP did succeed in obtaining a letter from the Khan's court, albeit with difficulty. Five members of the Party‚ÄîD. Losol, Dambyn Chagdarjav, Dogsom, L. Dendev, and S√ºkhbaatar‚Äîbrought it to Verkhneudinsk. When the seven men met with Shumyatsky, he told them that he had no authority to make a decision on their request; they must go to Irkutsk.Choibalsan, Losol, Demid, v. 1, pp. 172‚Äì73. On arriving in Irkutsk in August, the Mongolians met with the head of what was later to be reorganised as the Far Eastern Secretariat of the Communist International (Comintern), and explained that they needed military instructors, 10,000 rifles, cannon, machine guns, and money. They were told that they must draft a new letter, this time in the name of the Party, not the Bogd Khan, stating their objectives and requests. Such a petition would have to be considered by the Siberian Revolutionary Committee in Omsk.Choibalsan, Losol, Demid, v. 1, pp. 174‚Äì95. The Mongolians divided themselves into three groups: Danzan, Losol, and Dendev left for Omsk; Bodoo and Dogsom returned to Urga, where they were to enlarge the party's membership and form an army; S√ºkhbaatar and Choibalsan proceeded to Irkutsk to serve as a communication link between the others. Before separating, the group drafted a new appeal with a more revolutionary message: The Mongolian nobility would be divested of its hereditary power, to be replaced by a democratic government headed by the Bogd Khaan as a limited monarch. The document also contained a request for immediate military assistance.Choibalsan, Losol, Demid, v. 1, pp. 187‚Äì93. File:Dogsomyn Bodoo.jpgDogsomyn Bodoo File:Kh.

Danzan and his compatriots left for Moscow, arriving in about mid-September. For over a month they met frequently but inconclusively with Soviet and Comintern officials. A White Guard invasion of Mongolia under Baron Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, however, forced the Soviet government into action. In late October to early November 1920, around 1,000 troops under his command had laid siege to the Chinese garrison in Urga numbered about 7,000. On 10 or 11 November, the three Mongols were hurriedly summoned to a meeting with Soviet authorities. They were told that the Party would be supplied with all the weapons it needed, but they must quickly return to Mongolia, and there increase the Party's membership and raise an army.Choibalsan, Losol, Demid, v. 1, pp. 242-48. At the same time, Moscow ordered the Soviet Fifth Red Army to cross the Mongolian border and destroy von Ungern-Sternberg's army.Sovetsko-mongolskiye otnosheniya, 1921‚Äì1974. [Soviet-Mongolian relations, 1921‚Äì1974.], (Moscow, 1975), v. 1, p. 464. The Chinese garrison in Urga, however, successfully repulsed von Ungern- Sternberg's attack. This altered the Soviet strategy. The army of the Far Eastern Republic was already exhausted. Only the Fifth Army of the Reds was left on the eastern front, and already by late 1920 many of its more experienced units had either been demobilized, or sent west to fight in Poland, or assigned to the labor front, where they were needed to repair the badly damaged Siberian economy.See Jan M. Meijer, ed. The Trotsky Papers 1917‚Äì1922 (The Hague, 1971), v. 2, no. 669, pp. 401‚Äì403. Thus, when the Chinese repulsed von Ungern-Sternberg, the Soviets on 28 November withdrew their order for an invasion.Dokumenty vneshnei politiki SSSR [Documents of the foreign policy of the USSR], (Moscow, 1957), v. 3, no. 192, pp. 55‚Äì56. However, von Ungern-Sternberg launched a second attack in early February 1921. This time he was successful. Chinese soldiers and civilians fled the city in panic. With the fall of Urga, the Chinese administrations and military garrisons at Uliastai and Khovd departed quickly for Xinjiang. The Bogd Khan was restored as Mongolian monarch by von Ungern-Sternberg. The Bogd Khan and his government were also restored, and a solemn ceremony held on 22 February. Growth of the Mongolian People's Party S√ºkhbaatar meets with Lenin, a poster of Bolsheviks Damdin S√ºkhbaatar in Troitskosavsk News of von Ungern- Sternberg's seizure of Urga again influenced Soviet plans. A plenary session of the Comintern in Irkutsk on February 10 passed a formal resolution to aid the \\"struggle of the Mongolian people for liberation and independence with money, guns and military instructors\\".Istoricheskskii opyt bratskogo sodruzhestva KPSS i MNRP v bor'be za sotsializm [The historical experience of the solidarity of the CPSS and the MPRP in the struggle for socialism], (Moscow, 1971), p. 217. With Soviet support, the MPP was now a serious contender for power. The Party, hitherto rather amorphous and loosely connected, required better organisational and ideological definition. A party conference (subsequently regarded as the first congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party) met secretly on 1‚Äì3 March at Kyakhta. The first session was attended by 17 persons, the second by 26. The Party approved the creation of an army command staff headed by S√ºkhbaatar with two Russian advisors, elected a central committee chaired by Danzan with one representative from the Comintern, and adopted a party manifesto composed by the progressive Buryat Jamsrangiin Tseveen.Mongolyn ardyn khuv'sgalt namyn negd√ºgeer ikh khural [First congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party], (Ulan Bator, 1971). On 13 March, a provisional government of seven men was formed, soon to be headed by Bodoo. On 18 March, the Mongolian guerrilla army, its ranks now enlarged to 400 through recruitment and conscription, seized the Chinese garrison at Kyakhta Maimaicheng (the Chinese portion of Kyakhta). A new confidence now animated the Party. It issued a proclamation announcing the formation of the government, the expulsion of the Chinese, and the promise to convene a congress of \\"representatives of the masses\\" to elect a permanent government.Ts. Nasanbaljir, Revolyutsionnye meropriyatiya narodogo pravitel'stva Mongolii v. 1921‚Äì1924 gg. [Revolutionary measures of the Mongolian people's government, 1921‚Äì1924], (Moscow, 1960), pp. 11-13. A propaganda war of sorts between the provisional government and the Bogd Khaan's court followed: the Party saturated the northern border with leaflets urging people to take up arms against the White Guards; the legal government of the Bogd Khaan government barraged the same area with warnings that these revolutionaries were intent upon destroying the Mongolian state and shattering the very foundations of the Buddhist faith.Thomas E. Ewing, Russia, China, and the Origins of the Mongolian People's Republic, 1911‚Äì1921: A Reappraisal, (London, 1980), p. 419. The new Soviet government was anxious to establish diplomatic relations with China. It had sent a representative to Beijing; the Chinese government reciprocated with its own to Moscow. Perhaps the principal reason that the Soviets had hesitated to aid the Mongolians too openly was fear of prejudicing those negotiations. But by early 1921 whatever restraints there were upon open Soviet support for Mongolia had ended: China suspended talks with the Soviet government in January 1921; the Chinese government appeared to be incapable of dealing with von Ungern-Sternberg; and in early March it had refused Soviet military assistance against the White Guards. It was then that the Russians became firmly committed to the Mongolian revolution.Ewing, Russia, China, p. 419. The material expression of this commitment was an increase in the flow of Soviet advisers and weapons in March to the MPP. In March and April, Soviet and Far Eastern Republican units were transferred to Kyakhta, while the Mongols doubled the number of their guerrillas to 800. Von Ungern-Sternberg's forces attacked Kyakhta in early June. He encountered a body of Red Army troops army several times larger than his own, and the White Guards were thrown back with heavy losses. On 28 June, the main Soviet expeditionary corps crossed the border into Mongolia, and on 6 July, the first Mongolian and Russian units entered Urga. Formerly it was solely stated generally with regard to von Baron Ungern Sternberg that Mongol/Mongolian Communist troops had defeated him and had him executed apparently duly for his widespread impalements and killings. The Mongolian revolutionaries went to work immediately. On 9 July, they sent a letter to the Bogd Khaan's court, announcing that power was now in the hands of the people: \\"The disorder which reigns presently is as much due to the shortcomings of the [hereditary] leaders as to the fact that the existing laws and situation do not correspond any longer to the spirit of the times. Everything, therefore, except religion, will be subject to gradual change.\\"Nasanbaljir, pp. 22‚Äì23. The following day, the Party's Central Committee issued a resolution declaring the formation of a new government headed by Bodoo, with the Jebtsundamba Khutuktu as a limited monarch. On 11 July, he was ceremonially installed on the throne of Mongolia. Aftermath Mongolia's regime transferred to the People's Party, led by S√ºkhbaatar (painting) Von Ungern-Sternberg's army, now defeated, began to crumble. His men deserted him, and he was seized by a Red Army detachment. The Soviets executed him later that same year. Fighting then shifted to western Mongolia, and by the end of 1921, the White Guards had either been destroyed or expelled. The Chinese government was not indifferent to von Ungern-Sternberg's invasion, appointing Zhang Zuolin as commander of an expeditionary army to deal with it. However, the occupation of Urga by Red forces in July and internal Chinese warlord politics forced him to abandon his plans.Gavan McCormack, Chang Tso-lin, the Mukden Military Clique, and Japan, 1920‚Äì1928 (PhD dissertation, London University, 1974), p. 55. On the diplomatic front, the Soviets had proposed to the Chinese the convening of a tripartite conference, similar to that of 1914-15, to discuss Mongolia's relationship with China. The Chinese government, however, emboldened by the prospect of Zhang's expedition, responded that Mongolia was part of China, and thus could not be the subject of international negotiations. It was not until 1924 that a Chinese-Soviet treaty was concluded, by which the Soviet Union recognised Mongolia as an integral part of China, and agreed to withdraw its troops. The treaty notwithstanding, the death of the Khutuktu in that same year provided an opportunity for the MPP to dispense with theocratic rule entirely, and the Party announced the establishment of the Mongolian People's Republic. In 1945, the Chinese Nationalist government recognized the full sovereignty of the Mongolian People's Republic, though Chiang Kai-shek was to withdraw that recognition a few years later.Ewing, Between the Hammer and the Anvil, pp. 256‚Äì258. However, in 2002 the Republic of China did recognize Mongolia as independent. On May 21, 2012, the Mainland Affairs Council of the Republic of China in Taiwan stated that Outer Mongolia should be considered as an independent state.ÊúâÈóúÂ§ñËíôÂè§ÊòØÂê¶ÁÇ∫‰∏≠ËèØÊ∞ëÂúãÈ†òÂúüÂïèÈ°åË™™ÊòéÊñ∞ËÅûÂèÉËÄÉË≥áÊñô Taiwan however continued to appoint a \\"Minister of Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission\\" (until 2017 ).

History The village of Whippingham, and St Mildred's Church as its parish church, are best known for their connections with Queen Victoria. Whippingham was the centre of a royal estate supporting Osborne House and Barton Manor. In 1804 a church was reconstructed by John Nash on the site of the lost medieval parish church: in 1854‚Äì60 it was pulled down and rebuilt. Prince Albert (the Prince Consort) took an active role in the redesigning of the church building. The chancel of the church was built in 1854 and 1855 by the architect Albert Jenkins HumbertThe Buildings of England, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. Nikolaus Pevsner although Prince Albert is thought to have had a guiding hand. The remainder of the church was constructed in 1861 and 1862. A side chapel with the tomb of Prince Henry of Battenberg and Princess Beatrice, is dedicated to the Battenberg/Mountbatten family. Queen Victoria took a close interest in 'her people' in Whippingham. This is reflected in the many memorials in St Mildred's Church which commemorate members of the Royal Family, including the Prince Consort , Princess Alice, Duchess of Hesse and Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany and members of the royal household. The church also has a memorial to the Hessian soldiers who fought under the British flag in the 1790s, and were invalided to the Isle of Wight. Soldiers from the Musketeer Regiment Prinz Carl were housed in the newly built Whippingham mill, which became a temporary barrack and hospital. Eighty-four of them are buried in the churchyard. The memorial was unveiled in 1906 by the Landgrave of Hesse. The church is now in a united benefice with St James's Church, East Cowes.

As its name suggests, it is the oldest part of Letterkenny and was the starting point of the area's development, though it existed before Letterkenny itself. Oldtown is bordered by Creeve to the west and by Lismonaghan to the south. It may be entered from central Letterkenny on its northern flank via the Oldtown Bridge (for traffic) or Devlin Way (for pedestrians). The Rail Bridge (formerly used for trains run by the Lough Swilly Railway) is currently disused, and the only remaining evidence of Oldtown railway station. Oldtown has a weak range of essential services with the area being limited to green spaces within housing developments; facilities serving the area are primarily located in the town centre rather than in the Oldtown neighbourhood itself.. Part B, pp. 21 and 22. History Oldtown existed as a Native Irish settlement before the plantation of Ulster, which saw Patrick Crawford develop the market town on the other side of the Swilly at the Oldtown Bridge. The early inhabitants of the Oldtown spoke Gaelic and their main food source came from fishing the Swilly estuary which flowed up to Conwal Cemetery; they also raised livestock on the hillside where Leck Graveyard is today. Oldtown railway station was located on the Letterkenny & Burtonport Extension line. It opened on 9 March 1903 before finally closing for passengers and goods on 6 January 1947. There is no evidence of the station in existence today, a hotel occupies the site. However, an old rail bridge may be seen spanning the River Swilly.:File:LKBRIDGE.jpg The stone bridge which allows residents passage to the town is appropriately old, but also crumbling. Administration =Resident representation= The residents' association has a prominence. =Local and national government= Se√°n Maloney resided in the area during his time as a Senator representing the Labour Party. Other politicians with links to the area include Mayors Victor Fisher and Dessie Larkin of Fianna F√°il, as well as Larkin's father James, founder of Independent Fianna F√°il. =Policing and crime= Recorded crime is consistent in Oldtown, notably violent crime and other means have risen. During the COVID-19 pandemic, for instance, assaults by locals on paramedics and hospital workers were reported. Illegal dumping by locals is also a problem. Demography Oldtown suffers from overpopulation issues. Amenities and business The Hideout has been standing on this spot since the 1800s. Residents may purchase their bread, milk and toiletries at Oldtown Stores or Larkin's Shop. Old Dunnes, the nearest department store to the area, is located on the opposite side of the Oldtown Bridge. Former industries in the Oldtown include the Model Bakery, where the local children would gather to be fed free buns. There was also the Gaeltex Factory. Charlie Devlin had a mobile shop. Current employers in the area include Dunnes Stores, NowDoc, Jungle King and The Hide Out Bar (Oldtown Inn), which was established in the 19th century. The pub was redeveloped in 2008 and was awarded the most improved public house by the then Minister for the Environment, John Gormley. However, its new owner John G. Larkin, had ties with Dessie Larkin, the Fianna F√°il mayor and councillor (Gormley was in coalition with Fianna F√°il at this time). The pub was later renamed The Snug. A fire occurred at the Model Bakery in April 2020. Religious institutions Old Leck Church is situated in Oldtown, as is the adjacent Old Leck Graveyard. The nearby New Leck Graveyard, which alongside Conwal Cemetery houses the town's dead, is also located within Oldtown. Education The nearest primary school is Scoil Colmcille. Secondary education for young men is provided by St Eunan's College, girls are sent to the nuns at the local convent and a \\"vocational school\\" is also available, though each is a significant walking distance from the area. Some residents have also taken posts as teachers in the local primary and secondary schools.

The course was sold in 1965 for ¬£3000 and the club moved to its current home at Barnhill. Due to the area's growing population the land was developed into housing at the turn of the 21st century. Localities and housing The area contains approximately 600 residential properties. Residential areas include Brookcourt, Lu√≠ Na Gr√©ine and Ros Suilighe. The Jim Larkin Court and Gaeltex Drive blocks of flats are regarded as having a serious lack of facilities. They have no play area for children and families run the risk of having one of their children seriously injured or killed by a passing car. McNeely Villas, developed by Con Harvey and named in honour of the then recently deceased Bishop of Raphoe William MacNeely, was built in 1969 and opened the following year. Originally comprising 40 houses, four others were later added. One resident, Margaret Doherty, was renowned for pursuing the local council to \\"make sure things were done right\\". At its fiftieth anniversary in 2020, one third of the original residents still lived there.

The egg was made for Nicholas II of Russia, who presented it to his wife, the Empress Alexandra Feodorovna on Easter 1914. Its Easter 1914 counterpart (presented to the Dowager Empress) is the Catherine the Great egg. Design left The Egg was crafted by Albert Holmstr√∂m (1876‚Äì1925) under the supervision of Peter Carl Faberg√© and is made of yellow gold, platinum, brilliant diamonds, rose-cut diamonds, ruby, emerald, topaz, sapphire, garnet, half-pearls, moonstone, white enamel and opaque pink enamel. It consists of a series of yellow gold belts which are pav√©-set with diamonds and a variety of gems in a floral pattern, providing a look of petit point tapestry work. The pattern of the egg contains five oval panels bordered by half-pearls set in enamel, with brilliant diamonds placed at each intersection. The technical precision of the design was complemented by platinum that was cut, rather than welded. At the apex of the egg is a moonstone through which can be seen the year 1914 and Empress Alexandra's initials in Russian characters. =Inspiration= The floral tapestry pattern was designed by Alma Theresia Pihl, who was inspired by needlework fire screens found in aristocratic sitting rooms of the time. Pihl was the niece of the egg's workmaster Albert Holmstr√∂m, who came from a family of Finnish jewelers employed by Faberg√©. Surprise right The pedestal surprise is made of gold, pearls, rose-cut diamonds, green garnets, translucent green, opaque white, opalescent pale pink, pale green and pale sepia grisaille enamel. The surprise is a removable miniature frame with relief profiles of Nicholas and Alexandra's five children in a cameo brooch style. The back of the frame is enameled with a sepia basket of flowers. The basket is bordered with the year 1914 and the names of each of the Romanov children (Anastasia Nikolaevna, Alexis Romanov, Olga Nikolaevna, Maria Nikolaevna, Tatiana Romanov). The frame rests on a gold stand in the shape of the royal crown and is held in place within the egg by gold clips. History The Mosaic Egg was commissioned by Tsar Nicholas II and presented to his wife, Empress Alexandra Fedorovna for Easter 1914. It was later confiscated, along with much of the family's belongings, by the provisional government in 1917 during the Russian Revolution. In 1933 the egg was sold by the Antikvariat to an unknown buyer for 5,000 roubles, though the Royal Collection online object description suggests that it was likely purchased by Armand Hammer. On 22 May 1933 it was purchased from Cameo Corner, London, by King George V for 250 pounds \\"half cost\\", likely as a gift for Queen Mary's birthday. The Mosaic Egg remains a part of the Royal Collection of Queen Elizabeth and was included in a public display from July to October 2011 in the exhibit Royal Faberg√© during the summer opening of Buckingham Palace.

Amit's experimentation with a new medium took off and gained more readers than he had anticipated. History Much of Amit's freelance writing, such as Op-Eds for the Wall Street Journal Asia, were elaborations on ideas that were initially explored on the blog. However, India Uncut was, most of the time, a filter-and-comment blog. Some of its readers often chose coming to India Uncut over reading a morning newspaper, and wanted many links. Others hated the one-line link posts, and wanted him to write more. To evolve the blog, on February 15, 2006 the new India Uncut was created in collaboration with Madhu 'Madman' Menon. It sought to expand the ways in which it can bring pleasure to readers. The new sections were: * The India Uncut (IU) Blog: This is a continuation of the original India Uncut with Amit Varm as its sole author. * Linkastic: This is a filter blog, whose purpose is to save you time by bringing you some of the most interesting stuff to read on the internet, across a range of categories.

She signed with the label The Entertainment Group in May 2006 after being turned down by BMG/Sony, which had an option to sign the runner-up in the competition. Her debut album, Fearless, was released in 2007 and peaked at #43 and stayed on the charts for six weeks.

Early life and education The second son of Harry Leopold, Sr., and Ethel Kimmelstiel, Richard Leopold grew up on the upper west side of Manhattan. He attended the Franklin School before attending Phillips Exeter Academy in 1926, where he graduated cum laude in 1929. He then attended Princeton University, graduating Phi Beta Kappa with highest honors in 1933. After Princeton, he studied at Harvard under Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr., receiving his master's degree in 1934 and a Ph.D. in 1938. The book based on his dissertation, Robert Dale Owen (Harvard University Press, 1940), a study of the Indiana congressman and utopian socialist, won the John H. Dunning Prize of the American Historical Association. During World War II, he was commissioned as a naval officer and assigned to the Office of Naval Records and Library in Washington, where he devised system to organize the reports and materials relating to the ongoing naval operations. Academic career After his release from active service in the United States Navy, he returned to Harvard University for two years and then joined the history faculty of Northwestern University in 1948, where he spent the remainder of his career. In 1963, he was appointed William Smith Mason Professor of History at Northwestern and served in that position until he retired 31 August 1980. Among the prominent students whom Leopold influenced in their careers were Sen. George McGovern (D-SD), former Rep. Richard Gephardt (D-MO), Rep. James Kolbe (R-AZ), former assistant secretary of state Phyllis E. Oakley, historian John Morton Blum, journalist Georgie Anne Geyer, and television and motion picture director Garry Marshall. Leopold served on numerous governmental advisory committees, including the Secretary of the Navy's Advisory Committee on Naval History, The Department of State Historical Advisory Committee, The Department of the Army Historical Advisory Committee, Atomic Energy Commission's Historical Advisory Committee, CIA Historical Review Panel and Library of Congress. He was a member of the Editorial Advisory Committee for the Papers of Woodrow Wilson and of the board of directors for the Harry S. Truman Library Institute. He was president of the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations in 1970 and of the Organization of American Historians in 1976. In 1984, the Organization of American Historians established the Richard W. Leopold Prize, which is awarded biannually. In 1990, former students of Professor Leopold's established the annual Richard W. Leopold Lectureship at Northwestern in his honor. In 1997, Northwestern University endowed the Richard W.

It is 12 miles northwest of Lincoln on the A156 road. Seven miles to the north is Gainsborough Old Hall and 10 miles southeast is Lincoln Castle. It is a 16th-century Tudor stone-built fortified manor house founded by the Jermyn family of Suffolk. It is a Grade-I listed building and a scheduled ancient monument but the building is on the Heritage at Risk Register. The site is private, with no public access and is only visible from the A156 road and a public footpath, on the west bank of the River Trent.  History  The country house was built by Sir Robert Jermyn in c. 1560. It may have been built as a waypoint for the Jermyn family's travels to York or as a gift to one of their sons. In 1645, the property was slighted during the English Civil War. Having been taken from the Royalist Jermyn family by Parliamentarians, it was burned by Royalist soldiers based at Newark. Very little of the structure remained. Though the Jermyn family retained control of the estate after the Civil War, the property was not restored, but continued to deteriorate. The remains of the buildings were scavenged for usable building supplies by residents of the area. Also, the hall was built quite close to the flood-prone River Trent, which may have stood the family in good stead as a source of transportation and commerce (as the Lords of Torksey had been permitted to levy tolls on the river's travellers), but which also contributed to the damage of the building through flooding. In 1961, the Trent River Board buried part of the ruins when raising the river bank. The west facade and part of the rear wall survive. English Heritage undertook stabilisation of the building in 1991 but the building is on the Heritage at Risk Register. Origin of the name It is not known why Torksey Castle was popularly termed a castle. The building was never used as a fortress and would not have been suitable for that purpose. Although the structure is a hall rather than a castle, it bears similar architectural design features, including angular projecting towers and crow-stepped gables. According to Heritage Lincoln, these features may have led to its being termed castle. Alternatively it may have been built on the site of an earlier medieval castle. Construction of the hall It is obvious from the materials and architectural features of the remaining structure that the building was constructed, at least in layout if not in ornament, to the latest Renaissance fashion. The lower or ground floor level is built of thin limestone blocks, is very plain and has small mullioned windows, meaning it was probably used as the domestic area of the house, where the servants would have worked, but probably not slept. The upper level is built in red brick in English bond and most probably constitutes a piano nobile, a principle still very much new in Northern Europe at the time. Brick at the time, although having been used previously, had rarely been in use in British secular architecture before this period. Brick was widely considered at this time a lavish building material, due to their handmade nature, the cost of the labour involved, and the scarcity of brick and its manufacture, it was often a case that the kilns used to fire the bricks were constructed afresh on the building site. All of which added to the expense. The hall consists of a planned series of ranges around a square courtyard. The symmetrical nature of the surviving main facade makes it a great departure from the usual ad hoc nature which preceded it, and indeed continued up until the mid-seventeenth century.  Depictions in Art  Torksey Castle was painted by Peter De Wint in 1835. The watercolour is now held in the Usher Gallery in Lincoln.

After the death of his father, his counties Nassau- Dillenburg, Nassau-Siegen, Nassau-Dietz, and Vianden were divided among his five living sons. Ernest Casimir followed him as Count of Nassau-Dietz. In 1631, he inherited the small county of Spiegelberg near Lauenstein. Ernest Casimir was primarily known as an outstanding military leader during the Eighty Years' War. He served under Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange, in the siege of the cities of Steenwijk and Oldenzaal, and Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange, during the Siege of Groenlo and the Siege of 's-Hertogenbosch. As Stadtholder of Groningen, he founded the Nieuweschans fortress in 1628. Although he owned little in Friesland, he was popular there, and people granted his heir the right to rule after his death. He was killed by a bullet at the siege of Roermond while he was inspecting the trenches in June 1632. His son, Henry Casimir I, succeeded him as count of Nassau-Dietz and as Stadtholder of Friesland, Groningen and Drenthe.

He was born on 1 May 1800 at 17 Great Hampton Street, Birmingham, the fourth surviving son of the sculptor and architect William Hollins. Several members of his family were involved in artistic pursuits, including a cousin, John Hollins, the son of a Birmingham glass painter, who found success as a painter of portraits and historical subjects in London. Peter Holins Hollins studied drawing under Vincent Barber and sculpture in his father's studio before moving to London to work for Francis Chantrey in 1822. He assisted Chantrey with the installation of his portrait of James Watt in the Watt Memorial Chapel at St Mary‚Äôs Church in Handsworth. In London, Hollins shared a studio with fellow Birmingham artist, Henry Room, in Old Bond Street where he held an exhibition of his work in 1831. It included a group entitled, Conrad and Medora illustrating a scene from The Corsair by Lord Byron. It won the Sir Robert Lawley Award at the Birmingham Society of Arts, reconfirming Hollins‚Äô close links with his native city. He visited Italy around 1835 and returned to Birmingham in 1843 to take over his father's studio on Great Hampton Street in the Jewellery Quarter. In 1839 he competed, unsuccessfully, for the Lord Nelson Memorial commission for Trafalgar Square, won by Edward Hodges Baily. Showing both classical and romantic influences, he produced over sixty major works, including statuary at Malvern Priory, Bodelwyddan Castle, the Royal College of Surgeons and Weston Park.. He also sculpted the public statues of Sir Robert Peel in Birmingham and Dr Jephson in Jephson Gardens, Leamington Spa. Although he was less well known as a result of being based outside London for much of his career, Hollins' best work is considered to be the equal of that of Chantrey. His cousin, John Hollins, moved to London to paint portraits and became an associate of the Royal Academy. Hollins was vice-President of the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists for 37 years, and also exhibited at the Royal Academy. He taught modelling for the Birmingham Society of Artists and was instrumental in securing the Royal Charter for the Society in 1868. Sadly, he felt as though the town of Birmingham had been slow to exploit his talents as a sculptor. He said: ‚ÄòI wish to draw a veil over my labours for my native town as they were a grievous disappointment to me, and the more than Egyptian darkness and ignorance of that branch of art which I had chosen was simply appalling'. Hollins became inactive later in life, due to his suffering from rheumatism, which was perhaps caused by prolonged working with wet clay in a cold studio. He died in the house of his birth on 16 August 1886.

History Building began on the site in the 13th century and the church was dedicated in 1292. It originally served the Estur family as a chapel to Gatcombe House. The manor later passed into the hands of the Worsley family who provided the church with both financial support and a number of Rectors. The font is probably early 13th-century. The chancel was rebuilt by R. J. Jones in 1864‚Äì65; and the church was further restored by W. D. Car√∂e in c.1920. The tower contains three bells which are hung dead. Stained glass East window The church is noted for its stained glass by William Morris, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Ford Madox Brown and Edward Burne-Jones,http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-392705-church-of-st- olave-gatcombe- dating from 1865 and 1866. Rossetti founded the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood with which Morris, Brown and Burne-Jones were associated. Monuments The wooden effigy Memorial to Captain Charles Grant Seely (killed 1917) A carved wooden military effigy with crossed legs in the style of the early 14th century lies in a recess in the chancel, on the north side of the altar. It has an angel by its head and a lion at its feet. Scholarly opinion is divided as to whether it is a genuine medieval figure, recut, restored and embellished at a later date; or an early modern concoction in deliberately archaic style. It has been speculatively identified as representing an ancestor of the Estur family. Various legends have been attached to it, and in the 1960s it inspired the \\"Lucy Lightfoot\\" hoax. At the west end of the church stands a monument to Captain Charles Grant Seely, eldest son and heir of Sir Charles Seely, 2nd Baronet, who was killed in action serving with the Isle of Wight Rifles at the Second Battle of Gaza in 1917. It takes the form of a tomb chest bearing a recumbent effigy of Seely, who is depicted in uniform and with legs crossed in allusion to his service as a modern-day \\"crusader\\". It was the final work of the eminent sculptor Sir Thomas Brock, and was unveiled in 1922. In 1927 it was vandalised by a local woman, Nellie Kerley, who appears to have been aggrieved by the contrast between the memorial's grandiosity and the relative neglect of the memory of her brother, who had also died in the war. The damage to the effigy's face and sword-hilt is still clearly visible. Organ The organ was built by Henry Speechly in 1919. It was donated to the church by Sir Charles and Lady Seely as a memorial to the officers, NCOs and men of the Isle of Wight Rifles who had died in the First World War, and was dedicated in September 1922 on the same occasion as the unveiling of the monument to Charles Grant Seely. The organ chamber was designed by W. D. Car√∂e. The organ was overhauled in 2000 by Griffiths & Cooper and incorporated pipework from an organ in Upper Chine School, Shanklin. A specification can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.

Boxing career Little is known about his personal life except that he was born in Newton. His professional boxing record does not even contain a birth date for him. There are also discrepancies in the spelling of his last name, both \\"DeSiglio\\" and \\"DiSiglio\\" have been used by sources. As a professional boxer he used the \\"DiSiglio\\" spelling. the correct spelling is diseglio. He also used the name \\"Rocky\\", a derivative of his given name \\"Rocco\\". As an amateur boxer before he became professional he trained with future professional boxers Anthony Veranis, Joseph Barboza, Tommy Sullivan, George W. Holden, Americo Sacramone, Edward G. Connors and Joe DeNucci. He weighed between 141 and 148 pounds. He was also a criminal associate of mafioso boxer Joseph Barboza, who would later lead Boston police to the site of his corpse. Rocco fought his first professional fight on June 10, 1960, against Walter Giles at the Boston Garden in Boston, Massachusetts. His second match on July 19, 1960, he was matched up against Eddie Grenke at Veterans' Memorial Stadium in Quincy, Massachusetts. During his professional boxing career he weighed in between 144 and 145 pounds This match was Eddie Grenke's professional boxing debut. On October 31, 1961, he knocked out competitor Donald Mendes in Revere, Massachusetts, in 1:50 and won the match. His last winning match was on February 2, 1962, when he knocked out Gene Garrison. Rocco himself was knocked out by Tommy Thibault on November 17, 1961, in Worcester, Massachusetts, and again on January 9, 1962, in Revere by Jackie Lynch. His last professional boxing match was against Jesse Ammons on February 17, 1964, which he lost. His overall professional boxing record was three wins, four losses and one withdrawn match in a total of twenty-seven matches fought. It is rumored by Howie Carr and former mobster Vincent Teresa that Rocco supplemented his petty boxer's income by being a prizefighter for members of the Patriarca crime family who had interests in illegal betting and professional sports. In 1964 he gave up his dreams of being a professional boxer entirely and became active in the Patriarca crime family. He was married to an Italian-American housewife and drove a burgundy 1962 Ford Thunderbird on a desolate street at night in his home city of Newton. He left behind a wife and no children. Criminal career In 1966 Stephen Flemmi, acting as an informant told FBI agent H. Paul Rico that Rocco was robbing illegal card and dice games. There had been two dice games and three high-stakes card games that were held up by DiSiglio within three weeks. The most recent brazen robbery was on April 9, 1966, when five men burst in on a dice game that was happening at an address on the corner of Morton and Blue Hill Avenue in Mattapan, Boston with Bernard Zinna and Richard DiVincent, armed with sawed- off shotguns. They were robbing lucrative card games that he controlled in his territory of Newton and Lowell, Massachusetts overseen by Gennaro Anguilo, gambling czar for the Patriarca crime family which at the time was headed by Raymond Patriarca. They robbed the players of an estimated $4,500. None of the individuals bothered to wear ski masks during and all appeared to be of Italian ethnic extraction. DiSiglio was the \\"inside man\\" who saw to it that the door was unlocked for Zinna and DeVincent to come in unannounced and surprise the card players. One of them made a comment to the card players, \\"Larry told you not to run.\\" Flemmi advised the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) that this was a reference to Ilario Zannino who oversaw a lucrative illegal barboot game that ran on Sundays in the neighborhood. One of the card players at this game had been relieved of $10,000 and he had just borrowed the money from a Jewish loan shark named \\"Richfield\\" in the North End, Boston so he could act as a loan shark at the high-stakes card game for unfortunate players. Retaliation from Gennaro Anguilo Patriarca crime family underboss and acting boss Gennaro Anguilo of the Angiulo Brothers quickly became infuriated with DiSiglio's maverick actions and robbing the patrons of his gambling operations. In 1968, Patriarca crime family capo Gennaro Anguilo and two others were arrested and charged with first degree homicide but later acquitted. In August 1967, after H. Paul Rico testified before a Suffolk county grand jury about his conversations with Joseph Barboza concerning the murder of DiSiglio, the Boston SAC sent an urgent teletype to J. Edgar Hoover at 1:03 a.m. The Special Agent in charge noted that Suffolk County District Attorney Garret Bryne was commented that this \\"tremendous penetration into the La Cosa Nostra and the hoodlum element was effected through the outstanding investigative efforts of the FBI and his office.\\" Joseph Barboza stated that Gennaro Anguilo summoned Bernard Zinna and Richard DeVincent and gave them a choice, to either carry out the murder of their former gang mastermind or be murdered themselves. The following week, Zinna and DeVincent set up DiSiglio at a bar in East Boston, luring DiSiglio to ride with them. They drove over to a dark street and Mario exited the Thunderbird under the guise of picking up a stolen car for a robbery they had planned. As he sat in the driver's seat of his Ford Thunderbird Landau on a desolate street he was shot three times at close range in the head by DeVincent. They drove the car out to Danvers, Massachusetts, and left it in the woods. Shortly after his murder Joseph Barboza became a stool pigeon and he identified DiSiglio's triggermen as police officers in the Boston Police Department, including the murderers of Edward Deegan. One bullet tore off part of DiSiglio's face, another went through his head and out an eye socket. The murderers drove to Topsfield, Massachusetts, and dumped the body in the Ipswich River Wildlife Sanctuary. Barboza told the jury that he knew this because the accused triggermen Zinna and Richard \\"Vinnie the Pig\\" DeVincent told him so after the slaying. DeVincent bragged about it. Barboza even went to see Gennaro Anguilo at his office: \\"I told him that Benny Zinna and Vinnie DeVincent told me that he gave the order to whack out Rocky DiSiglio or he would whack them out. The reason I wanted to know this was that DiSiglio was a friend of mine and to find out if he had done anything wrong on his part to be killed. I told Anguilo they were running at the mouth. That they came down and told me everything. Anguilo said that he would talk to Zinna and that he didn't trust 'the Pig.'\\" Joseph Barboza later revealed the location of where they had dumped DiSiglio's corpse to the police. They found him in the backseat of his Thunderbird in the woods abandoned outside of Danvers, Massachusetts. Soon after the charges against Bernard Zinna for his involvement in the murder of DiSiglio were dropped, he was executed gangland style by being shot twice in the back of his head as he sat in his own car by unknown gunmen. Homicide investigators were never able to charge anyone with the homicide, except Gennaro Anguilo most likely ordered his death for his mother who he allowed to give an interview to television reporter John Henning during the trial. DeVincent was murdered by unknown members of the Patriarca crime family in Medford, Massachusetts, on April 3, 1996.

Located at the corner of 9th and Figueroa in Downtown L.A.'s South Park district, The Pantry (as it is known by locals) claims to never have closed or been without a customer since it opened including when it changed locations in 1950 to make room for a freeway off-ramp; it served lunch in the original location and served dinner at the new location the same day. This claim is also attributed to the fact that Dewey Logan never refused a customer even if he or she was short on money. It was however, closed briefly at the order of health inspectors on November 26, 1997, and reopened the next day. The restaurant is currently owned by former Los Angeles mayor Richard Riordan and has served many celebrities and politicians. History When it was opened in 1924 at its original location at 9th Street and Francisco Street, the restaurant consisted of one room, a 15-stool counter, a small grill, a hot plate and sink. In 1950, The Pantry moved to its current location at 9th and Figueroa, and has since been designated as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument No. 255,Cultural Heritage Commission, Historic-Cultural Monuments, City of Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department, July 1987 and has been ranked as the most famous restaurant in Los Angeles.Famous Restaurants in Los Angeles The restaurant is known for serving coleslaw to all patrons in the evening hours, even if they ultimately decide to order breakfast. It claims to serve 90 tons of bread (or 461 loaves per day) and 10.5 tons (20,000-tree harvest) of coffee per year. After 87 years, the restaurant's tradition of serving free coffee ended in 2011.https://articles.latimes.com/2011/jul/28/local/la-me- pantry-coffee-20110728 Part of the building on Figueroa Street became Riordan's Tavern, also owned by the former mayor. For the celebration of the 90th anniversary of the restaurant in 2014, some people submitted their stories around The Original Pantry Cafe. This was the text (\\"A Pancake Tradition\\") of the winner, Devin Kelley. A sign can be found in the entrance of the coffee shop: > It's Sunday, 10:30. Brunch-time. We're standing in line outside the Original > Pantry. The summer breeze ripples my t-shirt. I grin at my grandma. She's > standing, not noticing me, arms crossed, looking ahead at the front door. I > count the heads in front of us again. Now we're in ninth place. The couple > behind us shuffles their shoes, catching up with us, as the line shifts > forward another few feet. The line is long but welcoming. Everyone wavers in > it, shifting, looking behind, forward again, and heads bobbing and peering > over others towards the front. My grandma looks at me, a paper menu clutched > between soft fists, and forces a smile. She's been going here since she was > nine years old. Always, every Sunday, her mother and father would bring her > to the pantry after mass, allowing her to order whatever she desired. > Scanning the long menu, between the classic Sour Dough French Toast, and the > mouth-watering Bacon and Cheese Omelet, she would wrinkle her brow and > pretend to consider ordering something different. But she never did. It was > always the pancakes and a large orange juice. Her parents would laugh at her > seriousness. \\"Let me guess,\\" her mother would say. \\"The Pancakes?\\" My > grandma taught me this not-so-secret combination when I was nine. I too > ordered the pancakes every time. I too dreamed of the pillowy cakes drenched > in maple syrup and butter. I too washed it down with a tall glass of OJ. And > I too pretended, though I never meant it, to consider the long list of > options on the menu. We had a simple tradition at the Pantry. The line moves > again. I count the heads. We're three feet away from the entrance and I can > already smell the buttery bread and bacon. My grandma puts her arm around my > shoulder and winks at me, as she drops her menu on the ground. I bend to > pick it up, but as I do, I notice two tall, large men, sneak in front of us. > \\"Excuse me\\" my grandma says, \\"the line starts back there.\\" She points down > St. James Blvd., down a long line of excited people fidgeting. Somewhere in > line a man is playing soft rock on his phone. It's \\"Take it Easy\\" by the > Eagles. The two big men, one with sunglasses and a muscle shirt, and the > other with torn jeans, ignore her call to arms. To my amazement, she pokes > one of them on the back. \\"What do you want old lady?\\" the man exclaims as he > turns around. \\"Excuse me, my grandson and I have been waiting in line for > pancakes.

Lore The wait staff, and even the cook, were known for wearing impeccably starched white dress shirts with black bow ties. It was said that The Pantry hired its staff from among men recently released from jail or prison, providing them with an occupation as a way of rehabilitating them into society. This however, cannot be substantiated. For many years, a gentleman who could have passed as the twin brother of actor Humphrey Bogart worked at The Pantry as a waiter, and was known as \\"Bogie\\" by regulars. In popular culture The cafe is regularly mentioned or visited by characters in Michael Connelly's series of mystery novels featuring LAPD detective Harry Bosch, including The Black Echo and The Last Coyote. The restaurant is featured in a scene in Judd Apatow's 2007 comedy Knocked Up, in which Seth Rogen's character informs his father (Harold Ramis) of his girlfriend's pregnancy.

Since the last third of the 20th century, anarchists have been involved in anti-globalisation, peace, squatter and student protest movements. Anarchists have participated in violent revolutions such as in the Free Territory and Revolutionary Catalonia and anarchist political organizations such as the International Workers' Association and the Industrial Workers of the World exist since the 20th century.

As the movement shaped 21st century radicalism, wider embrace of anarchist principles signaled a revival of interest. Various anarchist groups, tendencies and schools of thought exist today, making it difficult to describe the contemporary anarchist movement.Franks, Benjamin (August 2013).

While theorists and activists have established \\"relatively stable constellations of anarchist principles\\", there is no consensus on which principles are core and commentators describe multiple \\"anarchisms\\" (rather than a singular \\"anarchism\\") in which common principles are shared between schools of anarchism while each group prioritizes those principles differently. Gender equality can be a common principle, although it ranks as a higher priority to anarcha-feminists than anarcho-communists.Franks, Benjamin (August 2013). Freeden, Michael; Stears, Marc (eds.). \\"Anarchism\\". The Oxford Handbook of Political Ideologies. Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 386. . Anarchists are generally committed against coercive authority in all forms, namely \\"all centralized and hierarchical forms of government (e.g., monarchy, representative democracy, state socialism, etc.), economic class systems (e.g., capitalism, Bolshevism, feudalism, slavery, etc.), autocratic religions (e.g., fundamentalist Islam, Roman Catholicism, etc.), patriarchy, heterosexism, white supremacy, and imperialism\\".Jun, Nathan (September 2009). \\"Anarchist Philosophy and Working Class Struggle: A Brief History and Commentary\\".

Overview  = New anarchism = New anarchism is a term that has been notably used by several authors to describe the most recent reinvention of the anarchist thought and practice. What distinguishes the new anarchism of today from the new anarchism of the 1960s and 1970s, or from the work of Anglo- American based authors such as Murray Bookchin, Alex Comfort, Paul Goodman, Herbert Read and Colin Ward, is its emphasis on the global perspective.

Influenced by anti-authoritarian postmodern philosophy, post- leftists reject Enlightenment rationality and deconstruct topics such as gender. While a few advocate for armed insurrection, most advocate for creating spaces and affinity groups to act freely within current society rather than fighting for utopian ideal. In the United States, Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed, CrimethInc. and Green Anarchy are associated with post-leftism as many post-left anarchists advocate for anarcho-primitivism. Influenced by anarcho-punk, green anarchy and Situationism, CrimethInc. argues for a DIY folk approach to everyday life, including refusal of work, escaping gender roles and straight edge lifestyle.

[...] But the movements of the sixties were driven by concerns that were more compatible with an expressive style of politics, with hostility to authority in general and state power in particular. [...] By the late sixties, political protest was intertwined with cultural radicalism based on a critique of all authority and all hierarchies of power. Anarchism circulated within the movement along with other radical ideologies. The influence of anarchism was strongest among radical feminists, in the commune movement, and probably in the Weather Underground and elsewhere in the violent fringe of the anti-war movement.\\" In 1968, the International of Anarchist Federations was founded during an international anarchist conference held in Carrara by the three existing European federations, namely the French Anarchist Federation, the Iberian Anarchist Federation and the Italian Anarchist Federation as well as the Bulgarian Anarchist Federation in French exile.\\"London Federation of Anarchists involvement in Carrara conference, 1968\\".

In the United Kingdom during the 1970s, this was associated with the punk rock movement as exemplified by bands such as Crass (pioneers of the anarcho-punk subgenre) and the Sex Pistols. The housing and employment crisis in most of Western Europe led to the formation of communes, intentional communities and squatter movements like that of Barcelona. In Denmark, squatters occupied a disused military base and declared the Freetown Christiania, an autonomous haven in central Copenhagen. The relationship between anarchism and punk as well as squatting has carried on into the 21st century. In Infinitely Demanding, Simon Critchley wrote: \\"There is no doubt that 60s anarchism was libertarian and linked to the sexual revolution, liberation of the erotic instincts and what Herbert Marcuse called 'nonrepressive sublimation'.

Contemporary members of the Italian Anarchist Federation marching in Rome in 2008 in an anti-Catholic manifestation (the text translates as \\"free from dogmas, always heretics\\") Around the turn of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti-war, anti-capitalist and anti-globalisation movements. Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Group of Eight and the World Economic Forum. Some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting, property destruction and violent confrontations with police. These actions were precipitated by ad hoc, leaderless and anonymous cadres known as black blocs, although other peaceful organisational tactics pioneered in this time include affinity groups, security culture and the use of decentralised technologies such as the Internet. A significant event of this period was the 1999 Seattle WTO protests.

Kaufman, the first of eight on which they collaborated in the 1930s. Plot The satirical comedy focuses on the effect talking pictures have on the entertainment industry. When the New York City vaudevillean team of Jerry Hyland, May Daniels, and George Lewis find themselves in a faltering vaudeville act, they decide to head west and present themselves as elocution experts in the hope someone will hire them to train actors unaccustomed to speaking on screen. On the train they meet gossip columnist Helen Hobart, who introduces them to megalomaniac film mogul Herman Glogauer when they arrive in Hollywood. The trio's misadventures include encounters with Lawrence Vail, a New York City playwright driven to distraction and eventually a sanatorium by studio bureaucracy and a lack of work to keep him busy; silent screen beauties Phyllis Fontaine and Florabel Leigh, whose voices sound like nails on a blackboard; two pages in 18th-century dress who periodically arrive carrying placards with announcements about Glogauer's latest doings; a ditzy receptionist who wears an evening gown to work; and aspiring actress (and proverbial dumb blonde) Susan Walker and her chaperoning stage mother. Dimwitted George becomes a director who shoots the wrong script, forgets to turn on the soundstage lights, and audibly cracks nuts during filming, yet his movie is called a masterpiece and he's declared a genius by trend-conscious journalists who believe he's ahead of his time.

He has a rare distinction of governing under three kings, Hyder Ali, Tipu Sultan and Krishnaraja Wadiyar III. He governed the Mysore kingdom from 1782 to 1811. He was known for his skill with accounts, prodigious memory and proficiency in several languages. He was also a wartime military commander while serving under Tipu Sultan. After Tipu Sultan's defeat, Mummadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar was educated and trained by Purniah from 1799 till 1810 (when Krishnaraja Wodeyar III came of age), he governed the Kingdom of Mysore together with the English resident of the East India Company. Residence built by Purniah in Yelandur, now a museum. Early years and rise Purniah came from an orthodox Deshastha Madhva Brahmin family. He was born in 1746 CE. He lost his father at the age of eleven and had to seek employment to support his family. He started writing accounts at a trader's shop. This grocer had close contact with a rich merchant, Annadana Shetty, who supplied large quantities of groceries to Hyder Ali's palace and army. Through this connection Purniah very soon earned confidence of Hyder Ali because of his proficiency in accounting and excellent handwriting. Endowed with prodigious memory, proficiency in several languages and sheer hard work, Purniah became head of Accounts Department and a confidant of the ruler. Purniah was fluent in Kannada (mother tongue), Marathi, Sanskrit and Persian. He understood English, but could not read or write the language. Years with Tipu In 1782, when Hyder Ali died, near Chittoor, Tipu was encamping in Malabar coast. Purniah kept the king's death a top secret, and sent the word to Tipu by the speediest way possible. Meanwhile, Hyder's body was kept embalmed, and business went on usual. Purniah thus played a key role in keeping the news of Hyder's death confidential, as many adversaries could have seized this advantage and tried to usurp throne. Purniah thus paved the way for the succession of Tipu. Purniah became a member of Tipu's inner cabinet. Purniah attended every military campaign Tipu Sultan led. In the Third Anglo- Mysore War of 1792, Purniah commanded a rocket units (131 men)., Page 5 of Rockets in Mysore and Britain, 1750-1850 A.D. In his last battle with the British, Tipu had entrusted his eldest son and heir-apparent to Purniah's care. In the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War, Purniah commanded the forces of Mysore against the English in some of the battles including Battle of Sultanpet Tope. Tipu died on the battlefield in 1799. Meeting with British Lord Harris Residence, later residence of Puraniah, Seringapatam Inscription at the Lord Harris Residence, Seringapatam After Tipu's death Purniah sought an interview with the General Harris, who was very much impressed with Purniah's political acumen, maturity and fearlessness. He informed the General that administration had nearly collapsed, many of the able army and civil officers were killed and plundering had already set in. The British were convinced and made Purniah the first Dewan of the newly formed state of Mysore(thus he became beneficiary of Tipu's defeat instead of Mir Sadiq which raises doubts that who actually did said treason against Tipu). Queen Regent Lakshammanni readily agreed to the arrangement. The child-king, later Mummadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar, was educated and trained by Purniah. He was granted the jagir of Yelandur, which yielded an annual revenue of 10000 star pagodas, by the Maharaja of Mysore at a special Durbar on 27 December 1807. The British Resident Sir John Malcolm and the East India Company honoured him on his retirement by presenting him a horse, an elephant and a rich killat. Krishnaraja Wodeyar attained the age of 16 in early 1810 and hence attained the age of discretion. After discussing with the British Resident, A. H. Cole, the reins of the state were transferred from Dewan Purnaiah to the king. Purniah retired from service in 1811. After his retirement from service in 1811, Purnaiah lived at the house is known as Lord Harris's House or The Doctor's Bungalow or Puraniah's Bungalow in Seringapatam, near the Scott‚Äôs Bungalow and Garrison Cemetery, and died there on 28 March 1812. Days before his death, he wrote a letter to his friend Col. Hill, Commandant of Seringapatam, Old and infirm, after a life of unusual activity and care, I am going to the land of my fathers, for which Col. Hill replied Say I am travelling the same road, and passed away a short time after Purnaiah. A tablet on the wall of this house records the connection of Lord Harris and Puraniah to this house. The photo of the bungalow at Bangalore shown as that of Purniah is actually that of his grandson Sir P. N. Krishnamurti, who was also Dewan of Mysore during the first decade of the 1900s.

This Yelandoor bungalow is now developed as a museum for Dewan Purnaiah's memory by Karnataka Government. Purniah was closely associated with Gen. Arthur Wellesley (Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington), when he was stationed in Mysore. American historian Prof. Robert Frykenberg https://history.wisc.edu/people/frykenberg-robert-eric/ suggests that Wellesley learned how to maximize the utility of cavalry from Purniah Years with Wodeyars The home of Purnaiah's descendants in BangaloreHeritage building Purniah's first concern was law and order. He suppressed the revolting Palegars (local chieftains) who had become despots. He started releasing cash allowances to Mathas, temples and dargahs, which the British had stopped after Tippu Sultan's death. He opened a judicial department for peoples' complaints. His public works have left a great legacy. About nine mile canal was dug to supply drinking water to Mysore. Several tanks were dug. A stone bridge, dedicated to Marquess of Wellesley, the Governor General was constructed across river Kaveri connecting Srirangapattana with Kirangur., Wellesley Bridge Pictures. It has stood stead fast for the last two hundred years. Large number of choultries were built in the name of Maharaja of Mysore, but people called them \\"Dewan Purniah's Chatras\\". They were available to all travelers. Revenue administration was streamlined. Mysore state had a volatile border with incessant skirmishes, a legacy of the previous regime. Methodical land surveys were conducted. Borders were notified. Posts of Shekdars, Amaldars and Tehsildars were created which came down to modern times. He was honoured with big grants and a large pension. His desire to make his position a hereditary one, just like that of a ruler, did not materialise. Purniah is remembered for laying the foundation of sound administrative machinery for the state. Mysore came to be recognised as one of the foremost progressive native states in British India.

Eventually the builders gave up building it in the planned flat location and built it on the hill. The church is medieval.The Buildings of England, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight.

It is situated one-and-a-half miles (2 kilometres) north of Padstow on the west side of the River Camel estuary .Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 200 Newquay & Bodmin The hamlet consists of two terraces of cottages, a few detached dwellings, a coastguard station and a boathouse with a slipway which once housed the Padstow lifeboat. The actor Edward Woodward lived there until his death in 2009. The first lifeboat, built by the Padstow Harbour Association, was kept at Hawker‚Äôs Cove and in 1855 the Padstow branch of the RNLI was formed. A new boathouse with a roller slipway was built in 1931. By the 1960s, silting was becoming a problem and in October 1967 the Padstow lifeboat relocated to a new boathouse and slipway at Trevose Head, a few miles to the west. Facilities at Hawkers Cove are limited, although there is now a (tiny) tea garden at the back of the two-hundred-year-old ‚ÄòCoastguard Houses‚Äô, approximately 150m from the slipway at the beach. Evidence has been found of occupation during the Bronze Age, Iron Age and Roman periods, and the use of Harbour Cove for trading vessels. Road access to Hawker's Cove is via a lane which leads from the Padstow-St Merryn road through Crugmeer to Lellizzick . As traffic is discouraged beyond Lellizzick, motorists are directed to a nearby carpark from where a track leads to the coastpath at Tregirls beach. Geography Between Padstow and Hawker's Cove the South West Coast Path passes Gun Point, site of an abandoned gun emplacement and fortifications dating back to the Napoleonic War. This stretch of path has fairly easy gradients and is well-surfaced, but beyond Hawker's Cove it steepens on the climb up to Stepper Point. There are no toilets or other public facilities nearby. The ebb tide uncovers a wide sandy beach which, at low water, extends across the estuary mouth towards Trebetherick Point. But at high water, the beach is submerged and the sand bank is the notorious Doom Bar which presents a hazard to shipping.

Operation Kutschera was the code name for the successful execution of Franz Kutschera, SS and Reich's Police Chief in German-occupied Warsaw, who was shot on 1 February 1944 by a combat sabotage unit of Kedyw of the Home Army (predecessor of Battalion Parasol) mainly manned by members of scouting and guiding Gray Ranks. This special action was a part of the larger Operation Heads - the code name of a series of executions of Nazi officials by the Polish Resistance.Strzembosz (1983) Background SS-Brigadef√ºhrer und Generalmajor der Polizei Franz Kutschera became SS and Police Leader of the Warsaw District on 25 September 1943. During his earlier posting in the Mogilev District of the Soviet Union he proved himself as a ruthless officer, prone to brutal and unscrupulous methods.Strzembosz (1983) Soon after his arrival in Warsaw he stepped up terror measures directed against the civilian population. The number of public executions and ≈Çapanka round-ups were increased, and lists of hostages to be shot in reprisal for civil disobedience or any attack on a German soldier were published daily. These actions, based on a decree by Hans Frank, were intended to crush the will to resist among the Polish population. As a result, the Polish underground leadership included Kutschera in its \\"Operation Heads\\" list.Strzembosz (1983) Kutschera's whereabouts in Warsaw were a closely guarded secret but were discovered by Aleksander Kunicki (code name \\"Rayski\\"), head of intelligence of the Agat company, while he was investigating two other assassination targets: Dr Ludwig Hahn, Chief of the Sicherheitspolizei and Sicherheitsdienst in occupied Warsaw and SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer Walter Stamm. In the course of his surveillance of the area around the Gestapo HQ on Aleje Szucha, Rayski one day noticed an Opel Admiral limousine entering the drive of the building at Aleje Ujazdowskie number 23, which was then the SS headquarters in Warsaw (and now houses the Hungarian Embassy). The SS-man who emerged from the car wore the insignia of a general, and Rayski began to monitor his arrivals and departures from the building. The SS-man was soon identified as Kutschera, who actually lived only 150 metres away, at Aleja R√≥≈º number 2. Rayski also discovered that despite the short distance from his home to the SS headquarters, Kutschera always used his car to get there.Strzembosz (1983) Preparations Rayski filed a report about Kutschera to Kedyw commander Emil August Fieldorf (code name \\"Nil\\") and several days later Kutschera was sentenced to death by a \\"Special Court\\" of the Polish Underground State. Adam Borys (code name \\"P≈Çug\\"), commander of the Parasol Battalion of the Armia Krajowa, selected Parasol's 1st Platoon to carry out the execution. Platoon commander Bronis≈Çaw Pietraszewicz (code name \\"Lot\\") was appointed as leader of the assassination team and planned the operation in close cooperation with P≈Çug.Strzembosz (1983) The first attempt on Kutschera's life was prepared for 28 January 1944 but had to be aborted after Kutschera failed to leave his home that day. After the execution team broke up, one member of the platoon, Jan Kordulski (code name \\"≈ªbik\\"), was wounded by a German patrol. He was replaced in the team by Zbigniew Gƒôsicki (code name \\"Juno\\") and Stanis≈Çaw Huskowski (code name \\"Ali\\"). The second attempt took place on the morning of 1 February 1944. The execution team was in position at 8:50am and included:Strzembosz (1983) #\\"Lot\\" (Bronis≈Çaw Pietraszewicz) ‚Äì commander and 1st executioner (armed with: MP 40 submachine gun, Vis pistol, Filipinka hand grenade). #\\"Ali\\" (Stanis≈Çaw Huskowski) ‚Äì second-in-command and security screen (grenades). #\\"Kruszynka\\" (Zdzis≈Çaw Poradzki) ‚Äì 2nd executioner (Sten submachine gun, grenades). #\\"Mi≈õ\\" (Micha≈Ç Issajewicz) ‚Äì 3rd executioner, driving an Adler Trumpf-Junior and armed with a Parabellum pistol and grenades. #\\"Cichy\\" (Marian Senger) ‚Äì cover (Sten submachine gun, Parabellum pistol, grenades). #\\"Olbrzym\\" (Henryk Humiƒôcki) ‚Äì cover (Sten submachine gun, Parabellum pistol, grenades). #\\"Juno\\" (Zbigniew Gƒôsicki) ‚Äì cover (Sten submachine gun, Vis pistol, hand grenades). #\\"Bruno\\" (Bronis≈Çaw Hellwig) ‚Äì driving an Opel Kapit√§n and armed with 2 Parabellums and grenades. #\\"Sok√≥≈Ç\\" (Kazimierz Sott) ‚Äì driving a Mercedes 170 V and armed with 2 Parabellums and grenades. #\\"Kama\\" (Maria Stypu≈Çkowska-Chojecka) ‚Äì signals. #\\"Dewajtis\\" (El≈ºbieta Dziƒôbowska) ‚Äì signals. #\\"Hanka\\" (Anna Szarzy≈Ñska-Rewska) ‚Äì signals.

As he approached the gate of the SS HQ, he was blocked by the car driven by Mi≈õ.Strzembosz (1983) Lot and Kruszynka left the car, approached the limousine and opened fire on it at close range, killing the driver and badly wounding Kutschera. Mi≈õ then exited the car as well and finished off Kutschera with a gunshot to the head. They then searched his body for documents. Meanwhile, the two other getaway vehicles moved into position and German guards stationed nearby opened fire on the executioners. An intense firefight ensued between the Germans and the covering team (Cichy, Olbrzym and Juno). At this critical moment, Ali was unable to open his briefcase, in which several hand grenades were concealed. Cichy, Lot and Olbrzym were all wounded in the firefight.Strzembosz (1983) Due to his injury, Lot's call to withdraw was not loud enough to be heard and as a result the shootout was unnecessarily prolonged, but all the executioners were able to eventually get into their cars and drive away. The original medivac scheme failed, and a frantic search for a hospital willing to defy the Germans and operate on the heavily wounded Cichy and Lot began. It took several hours and five attempts before a hospital finally admitted them. As a result of the delay, both men died within a couple of days. Meanwhile, Sok√≥≈Ç and Juno were intercepted while driving across the Kierbed≈∫ Bridge. After a short exchange of fire, they jumped into the Vistula river where they were shot at. Later, according to a German schupo report, the Germans recovered their bodies. Sokol was shot and had his ID with him which later caused German reprisal against his family. Juno drowned, and when his body was recovered he had no documents and could not be identified by the Germans. To help conceal Juno's identity and his connection to Operation Kutschera, the AK later took his railway hat and documents from his family in Piastow and later delivered them to a pro German Blue Police station in the suburb of Grojec city. It is unknown what the Germans did with the bodies they recovered.Strzembosz (1983) Aftermath The Germans held Kutschera's funeral ceremony in the Br√ºhl palace. His body was then transported to Berlin on a special train. On the next day, 2 February 1944, Germans shot 300 civilian hostages in one of the last public executions in the city before the outbreak of the Warsaw Uprising. Also, Germans imposed a 100 million z≈Çoty tribute on Polish residents of Warsaw and Warsaw County. In popular culture The execution of Kutschera was the subject of the 1959 movie Zamach by Jerzy Passendorfer. Every year the operation is commemorated by Polish Scouts.

It is now considered the definitive work on garden design of the many produced during that period, and has been labeled as the first monograph dedicated to garden architecture in the world, and among the great masterpieces of garden literature. Structure The work is broken into three volumes. Volume one focuses on overall principles, in particular: situation, layout, buildings and their fittings. Volume two contains descriptions and illustrations of decorative balustrades. Volume three covers doorways, windows, walls, decorative pavements, artificial mounds, rock selection, and a final chapter, chapter ten on borrowed scenery (jie jing). Emphasis The work is primarily focused on architectural features, rather than natural features. Contrasts have been drawn between this and other classic works of East Asian garden design, such as Sakuteiki (of the Japanese Heian period) which concentrates on water and rocks, and numerous Japanese works of the Edo period (Tsukiyama teizoden, Sagaryuniwa kohohiden no koto, Tsukiyama sansuiden), to suggest a fundamental difference in approach between Chinese and Japanese garden design - namely, emphasis on architectural and natural features, respectively. However in face of a more advanced understanding of the last, conclusive chapter ten of the book it is clear that natural features are in fact the prime theme of Yuanye. Last Chapter Ten: Jie jing The title of the last chapter of Yuanye is Jie jing ÂÄüÊôØ, borrowing scenery. The text presents jie jing not as a single design idea of borrowing scenery as is usually believed. Rather it deals with the essence of landscape design philosophy in its entirety. The ever-changing moods and appearances of landscape in full action are understood by the author as an independent function that becomes an agent for garden making. The object and subject, as either the landscape or the garden maker, shift continuously moving towards the conclusion: landscape and garden maker are both object and subject and are interchangeable. To be able to make a garden, the garden maker needs to meld with the landscape on the site, while natural phenomena become mnemonics for common knowledge as expressed in well-known passages in classic literature or poetry. It is the ecology of nature, including man, which motivates and moves design.Wybe Kuitert (2015) Borrowing scenery and the landscape that lends - the final chapter of Yuanye, Journal of Landscape Architecture, 10:2, 32-43, See also *Chinese garden Notes Bibliography *Ji Cheng: Craft of Gardens, Yale University Press, 1988, Translated by Alison Hardie *Yuanye, le traite du jardin, Ji Cheng, Traduit par Che Bing Chiu *The Garden as Architecture.

Mercer Adam, Canadian Monthly and National Review, pp.1-9 Toronto: Rose-Belford Publishing Co., 1881, accessed 23 Dec 2008 As a young man, Johnston emigrated in 1792 to Canada for its opportunities. He had letters of introduction to Lord Dorchester, Governor of the colony. Through him, he met leaders in society, including the magnates of the recently formed North West Company in Montreal, Quebec. The fur trade looked like a good opportunity to make a profit. Johnston planned to be a \\"wintering partner\\", one who traded with Native Americans at the frontier post in the interior of the territory. With his own capital, he purchased trade goods in Montreal to take with him. Marriage Johnston went to Sault Ste. Marie, a journey which then took several weeks, where he settled on the south side of the river. There Johnston met Ozhaguscodaywayquay (Woman of the Green Glade), daughter of Waubojeeg (White Fisher), a prominent Ojibwe war chief and civil leader from what is now northern Wisconsin. Johnston fell in love with Chief Waubojeeg's daughter, but the Chief was skeptical of white men. He initially refused when Johnston asked for his daughter in marriage, saying: > White Man, I have noticed your behaviour, it has been correct; but, White > Man, your colour is deceitful. Of you, may I expect better things? You say > you are going to Montreal; go, and if you return I shall be satisfied of > your sincerity and will give you my daughter.Penny Petrone, First People, > First Voices, University of Toronto Press: 1984, p. 27 The couple married, after which Ozhaguscodaywayquay took and also used the name of Susan Johnston. Like Johnston, most fur traders were Europeans of social standing and, together with the upper-class Ojibwa women they married, they formed the upper tier of a two-class frontier society. \\"Kinship and ties of affinity proved more than merely useful to the traders. They were both a source of power and a necessity if one was to achieve success in the trade.\\"Robert E. Bieder, \\"Sault Ste. Marie and the War of 1812: A World Turned Upside Down in the Old Northwest\\", Indiana Magazine of History, XCV (Mar 1999), accessed 13 Dec 2008 Johnston was considered the first permanent European-American settler in Sault Ste. Marie.Mary M. June, \\"British Period - Sault Ste. Marie Timeline and History\\" , Bayliss Public Library, 2000, accessed 13 Dec 2008 The Johnstons' cedar log house on Water Street in Sault Ste. Marie was built in 1796 in a French colonial style.\\"John Johnston Home\\", Sault Ste. Marie, accessed 13 Dec 2008 When their eldest daughter Jane married Henry Schoolcraft, the US Indian agent, the Johnstons built an addition for them to live in. Some years later, the Schoolcrafts built their own house in the village. The addition is now the only remaining part of the Johnston house, and it is one of the featured historic houses in the city.\\"Historic Structures\\", Sault-Sainte-Marie, accessed 13 Dec 2008 Jane Johnston Schoolcraft is considered the first Native American woman poet. Although the south side of the river became United States territory in 1797 after treaty settlements following the end of the American Revolutionary War, Johnston never became a US citizen. At the time, the border was a fluid area. In those years, Native Americans had separate status and were generally not considered United States citizens. For the people at Sault Ste. Marie after 1797, there was little change in their daily lives or relations with the Ojibwa, except as they received more American explorers. Career As a young man, Johnston was thrilled at the opportunity he saw with the North West Company. He was impressed by the partners he met and their refined lives. When formed in 1787, the company had 23 partners and 2000 employees: \\"Agents, factors, clerks, guides, interpreters, and voyageurs.\\"William Kingsford, \\"John Johnston, of Sault Ste. Marie: A Passage in Canadian History\\", in G. Mercer Adam, Canadian Monthly and National Review, p.3, Vol. 7, 1881 Jul-Dec, Toronto: Rose-Belford Publishing Co., 1881, accessed 23 Dec 2008 Over the years Johnston became successful himself, with his fur trading and relations with the Ojibwa enhanced by his wife Susan's family ties to the Ojibwa community. The Johnstons were known as a refined and cultured family, leaders in both the Ojibwa and Euro-American communities, who maintained a wide range of relations.William Kingsford, \\"John Johnston, of Sault Ste. Marie: A Passage in Canadian History\\", in G. Mercer Adam, Canadian Monthly and National Review, pp.4-6, Vol. 7, 1881 Jul-Dec, Toronto: Rose-Belford Publishing Co., 1881, accessed 23 Dec 2008 As part of their culture of building relationships, the Johnstons welcomed to their home an array of significant players in the region, including surveyors, explorers, traders, governmental officials, trappers, and political leaders. With his wife and her family's help, Johnston developed a broad knowledge of both the Ojibwa ways and the Great Lakes region. He played an integral role in developing the Michigan frontier and was appointed a Justice of the Peace. Sault Ste. Marie was a community with a mix of fur traders, most of whom had Native American wives; Ojibwa natives, some of high status; and workers who were M√©tis, European, and Native American. Permanent and temporary structures included warehouses for furs, scattered housing and Indian wigwams, and sheds for boats. Many of the Ojibwa stayed in the area for the fishing more than for the settlement. Increasing economic tensions between Great Britain and the US affected the fur trade. In 1806 US changes to the Jay Treaty of 1794 restricted British fur traders to operating in Canada. Both they and the Ojibwa wished to return to the previous arrangement, which allowed free passage across the border for trade by nationals of both countries and by the Indians. During the War of 1812, Johnston assisted the British, due to his longstanding affiliations with them. After a direct appeal from the garrison at Michilimackinac, Johnston supplied about 100 of his men and took two batteaux for their relief in 1814. When an American force failed to intercept him, it continued to Sault Ste. Marie. There the US raiders burned the North West Company warehouses on both sides of the St. Mary's River, causing substantial losses to Johnston and the Company. The troops also raided his house, called Johnson Hall. They looted the library and furnishings and burned the house down. (Johnston's wife and children fled into the woods when the soldiers arrived.) Johnston never became a U.S. citizen. The Johnstons' oldest son Louis (also appears as Lewis) was a lieutenant in the British Navy and served on the Queen Charlotte during the War of 1812. He was captured by Commodore Oliver Perry during the battle on Lake Erie. His treatment by the Americans while he was held prisoner at Cincinnati, Ohio turned him against living under their rule. After the war, Johnston made a direct appeal to Governor Lewis Cass of Michigan to have the restriction against his trading in the interior lifted because of his other services to the region, but to no avail. He suffered financially from his losses and reduced trading and was never able to rebuild his former wealth. Although he applied to the British government for compensation for his losses, no payment was made. Believing he was too old to remove to Canada, he stayed in Sault Ste. Marie. In 1821 Johnston served as a Commissioner during negotiations to end the rivalry between the North West and Hudson's Bay companies and helped achieve their merger.Robert E. Bieder, \\"Sault Ste. Marie and the War of 1812:A World Turned Upside Down in the Old Northwest\\", Indiana Magazine of History, XCV (Mar 1999), p.10, accessed 13 Dec 2008 Still worried about potential British agitation of Native Americans along the border, in 1822 the US government built and staffed Fort Brady at Sault Ste. Marie. With the fort and troops, other American settlers started to come into the area in greater number. The culture of Sault Ste. Marie changed markedly. Johnston and others who had earlier formed and dominated the community were passed by as the newcomers banded together. The presence of military troops formalized the role of government. The new American residents were reluctant to become involved with the French, Ojibwe, or M√©tis, and disdained most of the existing society. Family The Johnstons had eight children, most of whom were American by the timing of their births in that city. They educated them in English, Ojibwe and French. Johnston had a large library filled with English classical authors, including poets, which his children used for their literary education.Margaret Noori, \\"Bicultural Before There Was a Word For It\\", Women's Review of Books, 2008, Wellesley Centers for Women, accessed 12 Dec 2008 The parents took care to educate their children in both cultures, and expected them to have opportunities in society equivalent to their standing. Many fur traders sent their children to Montreal for formal education. The Johnstons' eldest daughter Jane married Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, who arrived in Sault Ste. Marie in 1822 as Indian agent for the US government. He was to establish formal relationships with the Native Americans in the region. He became noted as an ethnographer and writer about Native American life. Despite his marriage and interests, he remained more outside Native American life than had the fur trader John Johnston. Jane Johnston Schoolcraft was inducted in 2008 into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame for her own contributions to literature and history. She is recognized as the first Native American literary writer and poet. A major collection of her work was published in 2007. The second daughter Eliza never married. The next two married well. The third daughter married Archdeacon MacMurray, of Niagara, who worked as a missionary with tribes along Lake Superior. Maria, the youngest daughter, married James Laurence Schoolcraft, a younger brother of Henry Rowe Schoolcraft. The Anglo- American settlement and rule over Sault Ste. Marie and Michigan after the War of 1812 changed the culture markedly within a generation. Mixed-race men, even those of upper-class families such as the Johnstons, were discriminated against by the Americans. The Americans disdained the children of mixed marriages; in addition, they were suspicious of Roman Catholics and French speakers. They often did not take the time to discern the layers of northern Michigan society, but lumped all those together who had preceded them in Sault Ste. Marie and other communities. As noted above, the oldest son, Lewis Johnston, stayed in Canada after the War of 1812.William Kingsford, \\"John Johnston, of Sault Ste. Marie: A Passage in Canadian History\\", in G. Mercer Adam, Canadian Monthly and National Review, p.8, Vol. 7, 1881 Jul-Dec, Toronto: Rose-Belford Publishing Co., 1881, accessed 23 Dec 2008 Because of Johnston's resistance to becoming a citizen of the US, his second son George was shut out of the fur trade as the Americans exerted more control in the area. During the 1820s, George Johnston worked for Henry Schoolcraft in various roles for the US Indian Agency, including as interpreter. After Johnston's death, his widow Susan Johnston and their son William managed the sugaring and fishing business. The youngest son, John McDougall Johnston, settled on Sugar Island (an island along the St. Mary's River) across from Canada. He was later appointed as the last official US Indian Agent in the area. Many descendants of John Johnston live around the world. Tom Johnston, a noteworthy basketball player, is the most commonly known descendant.

Early life Horlick was born into a Cheshire family and spent most of her youth in the Wirral Peninsula. Her father, Michael Gayford, was a businessman and Liberal candidate in the 1970s for the Wirral constituency. Her grandmother was a Jewish refugee from Poland. Horlick attended the independent Kingsmead School in Hoylake, Wirral between the ages of six and twelve. She was one of four girls amongst 300 boys initially. She then boarded at the independent Cheltenham Ladies' College in 1973. She stayed for two years then went to Birkenhead High School GDST. She also spent some time at the Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire, US, on an English-Speaking Union exchange scholarship. She gained nine O levels, four A levels and an S level. She gained a place at Balliol College, Oxford, in 1979 to study law, and graduated in 1982. She was president of the Oxford Law Society and counted William Hague, later Conservative Party leader, as a friend. Career Between 1982 and 1983, Horlick worked for her father in the family business. She joined S. G. Warburg & Co. as a graduate trainee in 1983, starting in the investment management business, which later became Mercury Asset Management. She was appointed a director in 1989. She joined Morgan Grenfell Asset Management in 1991 and was appointed Managing Director of the UK investment business in 1992. During five years that she was in charge, the amount of assets managed by the firm grew from ¬£4 billion to ¬£18 billion. She was suspended from the job on 14 January 1997 and resigned two days later, after it was claimed she was moving to a rival and trying to get colleagues to join her. Accompanied by a large contingent of reporters, Horlick flew to the company's headquarters in Frankfurt to demand that her job be reinstated. As her future husband later described it, \\"Amid rumours that she was going to defect to a rival, Horlick had been suspended from a senior job ... She took the trip to Germany accompanied by a piranha shoal of story-hungry hacks.\\" She set up SG Asset Management in 1997 and Bramdean Asset Management LLP in 2005. She founded and is the CEO of Money&Co.;, a marketplace lending business focusing on business loans. She also has a film business called Derby Street Films. Horlick is the Chairman of film finance fund Glentham Capital, which raised funds on equity crowdfunding platform Seedrs in 2013. She was also a founding partner of Rockpool in 2011, which has its offices in Victoria, London. The other businesses are based in nearby Mayfair. Politics It was reported that Horlick tried to become a Labour MP in the 1997 United Kingdom general election, and told the Sunday Express that she hoped \\"that Tony Blair will win the election\\". In a May 2017 LinkedIn blog post, Horlick stated that her preferred outcome at the forthcoming 2017 United Kingdom general election was a hung parliament. Horlick encouraged voters in constituencies \\"where Labour won last time\\" to vote Labour (under then leader Jeremy Corbyn) so that the UK would \\"not end up with 'hard' Brexit\\", and that \\"the important thing is to avoid a large Tory majority if we are to protect the economic future of our country\\". In the wake of the EU referendum, she wrote of her strong opposition to Brexit and cautious support of the Liberal Democrats. On 3 October 2019, it was announced that she was to be the Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate in Chelsea and Fulham. Horlick was unsuccessful in her bid to become the MP for Chelsea and Fulham at the 2019 United Kingdom general election ‚Äì incumbent Greg Hands retained the seat for the Conservative Party (UK) with an increased majority. Personal life Horlick has been called \\"Superwoman\\" in the media for balancing her high-flying finance career with bringing up six children, Georgina, Alice, Serena, Antonia, Rupert, and Benjie. Her eldest daughter, Georgina, died of leukaemia in 1998 when she was 12. Journalists writing about the role of mothers in the workplace refer to her as an exemplar of \\"having it all\\", although Horlick acknowledges her reliance on paid help. According to Horlick, \\"It's ridiculous that I am known as 'superwoman' ... Look at someone who has no help at home and holds down a job. Or look at me with my nanny and my secretary. Who would you call 'superwoman'?\\" This nickname came from Shirley Conran's book Superwoman, and apparently pre-dates Horlick's media fame. Her media appearance made her the subject of an Alex cartoon on 25 January 1997. She married Timothy Piers Horlick, whom she had met while at Oxford, in June 1984, when she was 23. He was also a City investment banker. They separated in December 2003 and divorced in 2005. Her second marriage is to Martin Baker, a financial journalist, on 8 September 2006. They had met in March 2005, when he interviewed her for the Sunday Telegraph. She acted as technical editor to his thriller novel set in the world of high finance. She lives in Barnes, London. She supports charities such as Just a Drop, which works for clean drinking water worldwide, UNICEF, and Great Ormond Street Hospital.

History Social movements involving Black groups are found throughout Brazil's history. However, until the abolition of slavery in 1888, these social movements were almost always clandestine and radical in nature since their main objective was the liberation of black slaves. Since slaves were treated like private property, escapes and insurrections threatened the social order along with causing economic harm. These insurrections became the object of violent repression not only by the ruling class, but also by the state and its agents. Pre-Abolition Black Resistance =Quilombos, Quilombolas, and Quilombagem= The principal form of embodiment of resistance against slavery by black rebel movements for nearly four centuries (1549‚Äì1888) was quilombagem. According to Clovis Moura: \\"Quilombagem is understood as the permanent rebel movements organized and directed by the slaves throughout the national territory. Considered a provocative social change movement, it was a constant and significant demoralizing force for the slave system undermining the slave system on several levels‚Äîeconomic, social and military. This kind of activity greatly influenced the crisis that the slave economy experienced and was eventually substituted by free labor\\" (22, 1989). Even though according to Moura the quilombagem had as its organizational center the quilombo where escaped slaves sought refuge in addition to all sort of individuals excluded and marginalized by society during the colonial era, the quilombagem comprised \\"other forms of individual or collective protests\\" such as insurrections (the most notable one being in Salvador in 1835) and bandoleirismo, a guerrilla tactic in which groups of escaped slaves organized themselves to attack groups of people and travelers on the roadways (Moura, 1989). In Moura's study the quilombagem as an emancipatory movement \\"greatly precedes the liberal abolitionist movement\\" that only began to be more public after 1880 when slavery had already entered into crisis. Nevertheless, because of the absence of mediators between the rebel slaves and the ruling class, the problems surrounding the quilombagem could only be solved by violence and not through dialogue. Even though there existed exceptions like the Republic of Palmares which lasted for almost a century, most of the quilombola movements did not have the means to resist for long against the oppressive mechanism of the state. =From Inconfid√™ncias to Isabelismo= While the Inconfid√™ncia Mineira was a separatist movement without a popular base and an almost complete absence of blacks, it was opposed to the situation known as the Inconfid√™ncia Baiana, or the 1798 Revolt of the Alfaiates (Tailors). The objectives of the rebelling baianos were, according to Moura, \\"much more radical, and the proposal to liberate the slaves was one of the main goals of their objectives. Among its leaders and members were included \\"freed blacks, black slaves, pardo slaves, freed pardos, artesans, tailors; those who were from the most oppressed or discriminated classes of Bahia colonial society\\".Moura 1989:43. After the abolition of slavery, a certain portion of the black groups engaged themselves in the defense of Isabelism, a kind of cult to Princess Isabel who was given the name of \\"redeemer\\" as if abolition had been an \\"act of personal kindness\\" from the regent (Moura 1989). One of the most fervent believers of this movement was Jos√© do Patroc√≠nio who sought to mobilize ex-slaves to defend the monarchy who had been threatened by the surge in groups who intended to establish a republic in Brazil. This movement culminated in the foundation of the Black Guard (Guarda Negra), a kind of shock troop composed of \\"capoeiras and marginalized individuals\\" whose principal function was to disperse republican rallies through the use of force. However, with the downfall of the Empire and the proclamation of the Republic, Jos√© do Patroc√≠nio joined the winning side, and the Black Guard was dissolved. =From revolt to pacified resistance= With the end of the Empire different black groups joined a diversity of popular movements, particularly those messianic in character, such as that of Canudos and that of the blessed Louren√ßo. They even had a significant role in the Revolta da Chibata (The Revolt of the Lash or Whip) in 1910 which was led by the sailor Jo√£o C√¢ndido. Through this revolt, C√¢ndido succeeded in making the Brazilian Navy stop applying the punishment of flogging to sailors who were in their majority black. Despite this victory and a promise of amnesty the leadership of the movement was almost completely exterminated a year later. Even Jo√£o C√¢ndido who had survived purged by the government, lived out the final days of his life forgotten and in misery. The Revolt of Chibata was virtually the last organized armed black rebellion that took place in Brazil. From then on black groups sought out alternative forms of resistance, \\"especially in leisure, cultural or sport groups\\" (Moura 1989). This pacific form of resistance already existed during the era of slavery even though it was not the only existing instrument of resistance. Since these practices did not occur in a social vacuum, Moura alerts to the fact that these groups did not conserve their original purity since they \\"suffered the acculturated influence (that is, whitening) of the dominant ideological mechanism. It is an ideological- cultural battle that is fought on all levels, even before our very eyes\\" (Moura 1989). Moura gives examples referring to the samba schools of Rio de Janeiro that from spontaneous popular manifestations during the first decades of the 20th century converted into a highly lucrative business for its directors that relied on official protection from the state. The Black Movement in the 20th Century =Genesis: 1915-1945= With S√£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro as principal centers of mobilization, the Afro-Brazilian social movements began to forge new paths beginning in the 1910s in an attempt to fight for the recently acquired citizenship and transform themselves into national organization. The first major manifestation is the emergence of the black paulista (S√£o Paulo) press, whose first newspaper, the Menelick, begins to circulate in 1915. It is followed by A Rua (The Street) in 1916, O Alfinete (The Pin) in 1918, A Liberdade (Liberty) in 1919, A Sentinela (The Guardian) in 1920, O Getulino and O Clarim d'Alvorada (Clear Daybreak) in 1924. This wave of publications last until 1963 when O Correio d'√âbano was closed down. All of these newspapers were characterized by the fact of not covering major national events (which they carefully avoided). According to Moura, it \\"was a highly specialized press in its information and directed to a specific public\\" (1989). Because of this melting pot of ideological culture promoted by the black paulistana press, one of the most interesting national Afro-Brazilian movements is developed in the 1930s, the Frente Negra Brasileira (FNB - Brazilian Black Front). Established on September 16, 1931 due to a strong centralized organization in the form of a \\"Grand Counsel\\" of 20 members and presided over by a chief or boss (this caused it to be accused of being a Fascist movement). Relying on thousands of members and sympathizers, the FNB had a featured role in the fight against racial discrimination, for example, having been responsible for the inclusion of blacks in the Public Force of S√£o Paulo. After attaining success, the FNB decided to establish itself as a political party, and in doing allowed them to be involved in the Electoral Tribunal in 1936. However, FNB's life as a political party was short. In 1937 with a decree by the Estado Novo of Get√∫lio Vargas, all political parties, including the FNB, were declared illegal and dissolved. From that moment until redemocratization in 1945, black social movements had to recede back to their traditional forms of cultural resistance. The only possible exception during this period (but is categorized as cultural resistance) is connected to the actions of Abdias do Nascimento whom in 1944 in Rio de Janeiro founded the Teatro Experimental do Negro (TEN - Black Experimental Theater). Nascimento was responsible for an expressive theatrical production that sought to boost \\"the consciousness of black Brazilians\\" and combat racial discrimination (Moura 1989). =Rearticulation: 1945‚Äì1975= Beginning in the 1950s, the black movements initiated a slow cycle of rearticulation that is marked by the founding of the Associa√ß√£o Cultural do Negro (ACN - Black Cultural Association) in S√£o Paulo in 1954. Even though it emerged as an ideological assertion movement, the ACN did not neglect providing assistance to its members by establishing culture, sport, student and feminine departments, and even a Recreation Committee. After a period of expansion, it entered a phase of decline and experienced a time of inactivity. It reemerged on May 13, 1977 with objectives focused more on assistance and philanthropy that included the creation of a school and free literacy courses. However, according to Moura, the ACN had lost \\"its initial ethos\\" and had to shut down its activities soon after. In 1975 the Instituto de Pesquisa e Cultura Negra (IPCN - Black Culture and Research Institute) is founded in Rio de Janeiro. It is an organization of great relevance for the black movement, and its sustainment is due to the contribution of hundreds of partners. One of the few entities to have their own facilities, the IPCN encountered financial problems at the end of the 1980s having to subsequently shut its doors. =1975-1988= The Movimento Negro Unificado Contra a Discrimina√ß√£o Racial (MNU) was founded in 1978. It emerged as part of a public protest on July 7, 1978 against the torture of Robson Silveira da Luz at the Guaianases police headquarters in S√£o Paulo; the discrimination of four Afro-Brazilian athletes at the Tiet√™ Regatta Club, and the police killing of Nilton Louren√ßo, a worker. The date, July 7, would later be known as the National Day to Combat Racism. The MNU created Centros de Luta (Fighting Centers) in cities and town across Brazil to promote social activism at the local level. The MNU led to the creation of the first public body dedicated to the support of Afro-Brazilian social movements in 1984, known as the Participation Council And Development of the Black Community. Andr√© Franco Montoro, a governor of S√£o Paulo, championed the movement, which ultimately criminalized racism in the Brazilian Constitution of 1988. The definition of racism as a crime was established by the Ca√≥ Law of 1989, written by . In 1989, a documentary, Ori, narrated by Beatriz Nascimento and directed by Raquel Gerber was released which explored the relationship between Africa and Brazil and traced the trajectory of the Black Movement in the country.

She is the second of three children who all became artists, in a comfortably-off Jewish family. Biography Rebecca Solomon was born on 26 September 1832, the youngest of the three daughters, and she was one of eight children born into an artistically-inclined Jewish merchant family in Bishopsgate in east London. Her father was Michael (Meyer) Solomon, the first Jew to be honoured with the Freedom of the City of London; her mother was Catherine (Kate) Levy. Solomon was the lesser-known artist to her painter brothers Simeon Solomon (1840‚Äì1905) and Abraham Solomon (1824‚Äì1862). There were five other children in the family: Aaron, Betsy, Isaac, Ellen, and Sylvester. Initially Solomon was taught by her older brother Abraham and worked in his studio as an apprentice and copyist. She also, took lessons at the Spitalfields School of Design. Solomon exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts between 1852 and 1868, and also at the Dudley Gallery and Gambart's French Gallery.Gerrish-Nunn, P. 'Rebecca Solomon', in Geffrye Museum.

Solomon worked in the studio of John Everett Millais, one of founders of the Pre- Raphaelite Brotherhood. She also worked with the second wave Pre-Raphaelite artist, Edward Burne-Jones.Ferrari, Roberto C. \\"Rebecca Solomon, Pre- Raphaelite Sister.\\" The Review of the Pre-Raphaelite Society, 12:2 (Summer 2004): 23‚Äì36 Solomon taught her younger brother, Simeon, much of what she learned from her assistant-ship to Millais. Solomon was also active in contemporary social reform movements and in 1859 she joined a group of thirty- eight women artists petitioning the Royal Academy of Arts to open its schools to women, which led to the first woman, Laura Herford, being admitted to the Academy in 1860. After her elder brother, Abraham's death in 1862, she made sure to find work outside of his studio. As a result, Solomon broadened her material use when developing new works of art. Her newer mediums included: illustration and watercolors. Her last recorded exhibition was in 1874. In 1886, Solomon died aged 54, from injuries sustained after being run over by a hansom cab on the Euston Road in central London. Themes within her work Solomon's artistic style was typical of popular 19th-century painting at the time and falls under the category of genre painting. She used her visual images to critique ethnic, gender and class prejudice in Victorian England. When Solomon started painting genre scenes, her work demonstrated an observant eye for class, ethnic and gender discrimination. Solomon‚Äôs paintings reflect a combination of interest in the theatre and commitment to social consciousness that is not exist in other artist‚Äôs painting in the nineteenth century. One critic commented on the wholesome, moral and sometimes humanizing sentiment in her art, not an uncommon element in Victorian painting. However, Solomon's Jewish background was probably instrumental in developing her critical consciousness of difference and prejudice. Over the next ten to fifteen years, her artwork explored the plight of women and minorities, and the dominance of class discrimination in English society. She is considered among the first women from a Jewish background to make a prominent career as a painter in Britain. In the late 1850s Solomon made a successful transition to classical and historical painting, the most highly valued genre of art within the powerful art academies of the time. True to her vision, she continued to include images that reflected the historical foundations of nineteenth-century social injustice. The Governess (1854), compares the lives of two women within a Victorian home; One being an isolated working-class woman and the other, married and of a higher status. This work by Solomon emphasizes the loneliness of a governess‚Äô predicament.

The original structure was destroyed about 1850. The Commonwealth of Virginia and the Mount Vernon Ladies‚Äô Association have reconstructed the gristmill and the adjacent distillery. The reconstructed buildings are located at their original site three miles (5 km) west of Mount Vernon proper near Woodlawn Plantation in Alexandria, Virginia. Because the reconstructed buildings embody the distinctive characteristics of late eighteenth century methods of production and are of importance to the history of Virginia, the site is listed on the National Register of Historic Places despite the fact that the buildings are not original. History George Washington inherited Mount Vernon in 1754. In 1771 he erected a large stone gristmill on the plantation to replace a mill his father had built in the 1730s. The new mill was located three miles (5 km) west of Mount Vernon on Dogue Run Creek. It was used to produce flour and cornmeal for the plantation as well as high-quality flour for export to the West Indies, England, and continental Europe. Washington also built a house for the miller and a cooperage to supply barrels for the mill, and later, the distillery operation. The mill was powered by a large water wheel. To ensure a steady power supply, water was diverted from Piney Branch into Dogue Run Creek above the mill's headrace. The additional waterflow significantly increased the mill's production capacity. In 1791 Washington automated his mill using technology developed and patented by Oliver Evans of Delaware.\\"Distillery & Gristmill\\", George Washington‚Äôs Mount Vernon Estate and Gardens, www.mountvernon.org, Mount Vernon Ladies‚Äô Association, Mount Vernon, Virginia, 2008\\"George Washington‚Äôs Gristmill\\", National Register of Historic Places Registration Form, National Park Service, Department of Interior, Fairfax County, Virginia, 3 June 2003 Evans was personally acquainted with the mill and had repaired some of its works.Washington's letter to Col. Clement Biddle, April 8, 1798, published in Volume 48, The Pennsylvania magazine of history and biography, pp. 198-199 Once the gristmill was well established, Washington's farm manager, James Anderson, suggested building a whiskey distillery adjacent to the mill. When it was completed in 1797, the distillery was the largest in America. By 1799 it had become one of Washington's most successful enterprises, producing 11,000 gallons of whiskey per year.Cooper, Rachel, \\"George Washington‚Äôs Whiskey Distillery and Gristmill at Mount Vernon\\", About.com, The New York Times Company, New York, New York, 2008 A variety of whiskeys were produced at the site along with brandy and vinegar. The most common whiskey recipe used 60% rye, 35% corn, and 5% malted barley. Smaller amounts of rye whiskey were distilled up to four times and were more expensive. Some whiskey was also flavored with cinnamon. When rye was scarce the distillery used wheat. Apple, peach and persimmon brandies were also produced.\\"George Washington‚Äôs Distillery FAQS\\", Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, www.discus.org, Washington, D.C., 2007 The whiskey was marketed in Alexandria, Virginia, or shipped directly from Mount Vernon's dock on the Potomac River. The distillery process produced a significant waste stream, which was fed to 150 cattle and 30 hogs that were kept at the site.\\"A Brief History of George Washington‚Äôs Distillery\\", Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, www.discus.org, Washington, D.C., 2007 After Washington's death in December 1799, the gristmill and distillery passed to his nephew, Lawrence Lewis. In 1808 he rented the site to Alexandria merchant James Douglass. The last known reference to the distillery business is an 1808 whiskey advertisement. The distillery building burned in 1814; this is documented by a small insurance payment made to Lewis that year. In 1848 Lewis‚Äô grandson sold the gristmill property along with Woodlawn Plantation. That is the last record of the original buildings. Local oral history suggests that the mill was quite run- down by 1848, and it was razed around 1850. Reconstruction Reconstruction of George Washington's 1771 gristmillIn 1932 the Commonwealth of Virginia purchased around the old mill site. The state initiated an archaeological field survey of the site with the goal of reconstructing the gristmill, distillery and other Washington-era buildings. The gristmill and miller's house were reconstructed in 1933. Shortly after their completion, the site was opened as a state park. However, by 1936 the state had stopped maintaining the park. Sometime around 1940 a local chapter of the Future Farmers of America began caring for the grounds, but public use of the park was sparse. The state resumed responsibility for the park in 1962. Over the next two decades, several additional structures were built on the site. In 1997 Virginia conveyed the property to The Mount Vernon Ladies' Association which owns and operates the Mount Vernon estate. From 1997 to 2002 the main structures underwent major renovation, including rebuilding the internal millworkings, renovation of the miller's house, restoration of the millraces, and construction of new brick pathways throughout the site. Because the property embodies the distinctive characteristics of late eighteenth-century production methods, the site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.\\"Announcements and actions on properties for the National Register of Historic Places\\", Director of the National Park Service, National Register of Historic Places, Washington, D.C., 8 August 2003 In 1999 archaeologists began to investigate the distillery site; after five years of study the distillery reconstruction began. It was completed and opened to the public in 2007. This $2.1 million project was funded by the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States and the Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of America. Historic site George Washington's Gristmill is located on approximately three miles west of the Mount Vernon estate. It is situated on an eastward sloping lot, bounded by Dogue Run Creek to the south, pasture land belonging to the National Trust for Historic Preservation to the west, the park's paved parking lot and a housing subdivision to the north, and a wooded lot to the east. The property is bisected by Virginia Route 235. All the site's historic elements (except one archeological site) are located on the east side of the highway. This includes the gristmill, distillery, miller's house and several archeological sites. The west side of the property contains one archaeological site and three non- contributing structures. Gristmill The internal millworkings are enclosed in a heavy oak frameThe gristmill is a Colonial Revival-style stone building that was constructed in 1933 based on archaeological and documentary evidence. Its rectangular footprint measures by . Its foundation is built into a hillside, with two and one half stories above ground on the north side and three and one half stories on the south side. It is a masonry structure built with sandstone arranged in a random pattern with stone lintels and sills. The mill's roof is covered with wooden shingles. On the south side of the building is a vertical-board door on the first floor; there is an identical door on the ground floor on the north side as well. Both have stone landings. The millrace enters the mill on the north side and exits at ground level on the south side. The internal millworkings and structural members installed during the 1933 reconstruction were taken from an 1818 gristmill located near Front Royal, Virginia. Some of the structural members from Front Royal mill are still in the building; however, most of the millworkings were replaced between 1997 and 2002. The interior has exposed masonry walls with heavy timber framing. The flooring throughout the building is random-width pine. A masonry fireplace is in the southwest corner of the first floor. The grinding platform is accessed from the second floor. The third level is one large room with rolling screens and other processing equipment. A staircase in the western half of the structure runs from the first floor to attic. The mill's two grinding stones are powered by a pitch-back water wheel. The mill machinery is enclosed in a hurst frame,An inner timber frame that is separated from the outer stone walls so that vibrations do not break the outer walls built from heavy oak and pine beams. Its frame is built directly on the mill's foundation, and is not connected to the walls. This protects the structure from the machinery's potentially damaging vibrations. The hurst frame occupies the eastern half of the first two levels. Miller‚Äôs house The miller's house was built at the same time as the gristmill; the reconstructed house was sited on its original site. The design for the building is based on archaeological evidence and a mid-nineteenth-century drawing. Its wood-frame structure rests on a stone foundation. It is clad with beaded weatherboard. In 1970 a -story addition doubled the size of the building. The interior of the original section is laid out in a hall-parlor configuration with two major rooms and a small bathroom. This area is used as a gift shop. The new section of the house includes a kitchen, pantry, and additional retail space for the gift ship. Distillery Reconstruction of George Washington's 1797 distilleryBecause there is no surviving example of eighteenth century distillery, the reconstruction of Washington's distillery required extensive archeological and documentary investigation before an authentic structure could be built. The archeological study began in 1997 and lasted until 2006. During the excavation archaeologists uncovered the distillery's stone foundation which is some thirty-six inches (900 mm) thick. Some of the original foundation stones are over twenty-four inches (600 mm) in diameter. The initial course of the sandstone superstructure was intact along the southern foundation, and was two feet (600 mm) thick. They discovered the location of five stills and boilers, and found many objects used in the distilling process along with fragments of domestic items such as teacups, drinking glasses and buttons.\\"George Washington‚Äôs Distillery\\" , Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, www.discus.org, Washington, D.C., 2007 The distillery was reconstructed in 2007. To ensure an authentic reconstruction the wood was finished by hand and the construction used hand-made nails and hardware. There were some compromises necessary to comply with modern building codes and safety requirements. For example, the original structure's 30 by 75 foot (9 m by 23 m) footprint was extended by in order to house an elevator and modern staircase for public use. The distillery has two floors with five largecopper still copper stills, mash tubs and a boiler that demonstrate the eighteenth- century distilling process. The building includes a storage cellar for whiskey barrels, an office, and two bedrooms where the site manager and his assistant would have lived. The building's floors are made of three different materials. A stone floor is used in the mashing area to reduce vibrations that can disturb the fermentation process. Around the boilers and under the staircase is a brick floor, and an elevated wooden floor around the stills. Wooden planks are used for flooring in the rest of the building. Access The gristmill, distillery, and gift shop are open to the public from April through October. They are located approximately three miles west of Mount Vernon's main gate on Virginia Route 235. Tickets to tour the gristmill and distillery are available at Mount Vernon and the gristmill's gift shop. The tickets can be combined admission to Mount Vernon or purchased separately. Public transportation is available between Mount Vernon and the gristmill.

The conditioned emotional response is usually measured through its effect in suppressing an ongoing response. For example, a rat first learns to press a lever through operant conditioning. Classical conditioning follows: in a series of trials the rat is exposed to a CS, often a light or a noise. Each CS is followed by the US, an electric shock. As an association between the CS and US develops, the rat slows or stops its lever pressing when the CS comes on. The slower the rat presses, the stronger its conditioned emotional response, or \\"fear.\\" Researchers working on theories of conditioning often use the conditioned emotional response to measure the strength of the association between CS and US. They use the suppression ratio to quantify this strength. The suppression ratio equals the number of responses made during a CS divided by the number of responses made during the CS plus the number of responses made during a period just before the CS that has the same duration as the CS: SR = D / (D+B). Where SR = suppression Ratio, D = responding during CS and B = responding before CS. *If SR = 0, there were no responses during the CS and conditioning is strong. *If SR = 1/2, the response rate did not change when the CS was presented and there is no evidence of conditioning *It would be unusual for SR to be greater than 1/2. This would mean the subject responded faster during the CS than before; this could happen if the US were something positive, like food, instead of shock.

In March 1812 he was sworn of the Privy Council and appointed Treasurer of the Household under Spencer Perceval, an office he retained when Lord Liverpool became Prime Minister in June 1812 after Perceval's assassination. In July 1812 he was made Vice-Chamberlain of the Household, a post he held until the Liverpool administration fell in 1827. In 1821 he was created Baron Clanbrassil, of Hyde Hall in the County of Hertford and Dundalk in the County of Louth, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which entitled him to an automatic seat in the House of Lords. The same year, on 20 August 1821, he was also appointed a Knight of the Order of St Patrick. In 1858 he was sworn of the Irish Privy Council.leighrayment.com Privy Counsellors ‚Äì Ireland Supporter of Protestant causes Despite Lord Roden's political career, he is best remembered for his strong support for Protestant causes in the north of Ireland and elsewhere. He supported religious societies such as the Hibernian Bible Society, the Sunday School Society, the Evangelical Alliance and the Protestant Orphan Society, and also conducted service in the private chapel at Tullymore Park, Castlewellan, County Down, his chief residence in Ireland. He was an important leader in the Orange Order, eventually rising to the rank of Grand Master. However, in 1849 a clash took part between Orangeman and Roman Catholics at Dolly's Brae, near Castlewellan, in which several people were killed after he had invited the Orangemen onto his estate and addressed them, urging them to \\"do their duty as loyal, Protestant men\\". A commission was set up to examine the event, and severely criticised Roden for his conduct. As a result of this he was removed from his position as a member of the Commission of the Peace. Family Lord Roden was twice married. He married firstly the Hon. Maria Frances Catherine, daughter of Thomas Stapleton, 16th Baron le Despencer, on 9 January 1813. They had three sons and three daughters. His eldest son, Robert Jocelyn, Viscount Jocelyn, was also a politician, but predeceased his father. After Roden's first wife's death on 25 February 1861, he married secondly Clementina Janet, daughter of Thomas Andrews, of Greenknowes, and widow of Captain Robert Lushington Reilly, of Scarva, County Down, on 16 August 1862. They had no children. In later life Lord Roden spent time in Edinburgh, Scotland, to improve his health. He died there in March 1870, aged 81, and was succeeded in the earldom by his grandson, Robert, the son of Viscount Jocelyn. The Countess of Roden died on 9 July 1903.

At the time, it was the 33rd largest bank in the United States, and its federal seizure bailout was the second largest on record. At its peak, it had been the 18th largest bank and had over 470 branch offices. The liquidation company was named Recoll Management Corporation and its bankruptcy estate has continued to exist to pay out claims against the company. As of 2016, most of what was once Bank of New England is now part of Bank of America. Formation and interstate growth The Bank of New England Corporation was formed as the first interstate regional bank in the United States in 1985 as a result of a merger between the (old) Bank of New England Corporation and CBT Corporation. CBT was the parent of Connecticut Bank and Trust Company, which traced its roots to the Union Bank of New London (founded in 1792), as well as the Connecticut Trust and Safe Deposit Company, the Hartford Trust Company, and the Phoenix State Bank and Trust Company (founded in 1814). The old Bank of New England traced its roots to the Merchants Bank (founded in 1831) and was for a time known as the New England Merchants National Bank and the New England National Bank of Boston. The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 prohibited interstate bank holding companies (although some existing companies were \\"grandfathered\\"). The 1966 Douglas Amendment to the Act permitted interstate bank holding companies as long as the individual states also permitted it. Connecticut and Massachusetts were among the first states to implement reciprocal legislation and in 1984 New England Merchants National Bank and CBT Corporation attempted to test this legislation by applying for permission to merge. Citicorp challenged the merger under the constitutional concept known as an \\"illegal compact between states\\". Despite a new federal law creating a New England regional interstate banking zone, the case continued and was appealed to the Supreme Court in Northeast Bancorp, Inc. v. Governors, FRS, 472 U.S. 159 (1985), which found the interstate compact was not illegal. This paved the way for the merger of the entities in 1985 and several subsequent mergers of other banks. In 1987 the new Bank of New England Corporation acquired the Conifer Group of community banks and in 1988 was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol NEB. However, the bank swung from a 74 million dollar profit in 1989 to a 1.2 billion dollar loss in 1990. This loss is attributed to poor investments in the real estate market and was part of the larger savings and loan crisis engulfing the banking industry at the time. These investments were the result of CEO Walter Connolly's aggressive growth and acquisition strategies throughout the mid-1980s and in 1989 he was forced to resign by the board of directors and replaced by Lawrence Fish. At the same time as his resignation, the federal government issued a cease and desist order to the bank to restrain its lending practices, which were considered a risk to its solvency. Crisis and decline Despite efforts to restore the company's financial health, such as selling the credit card unit to Citigroup and laying off 5,600 employees, the bank continued to experience large losses. The Federal Reserve's Boston branch loaned the bank $478 million as temporary financing, however real estate related losses for the year of nearly 6 billion dollars overwhelmed the bank's solvency. Part of the problem involved large loans made between bank entities in the holding group that distorted financial results, as well as embezzlement by a vice-president of the bank, which was discovered at the height of the crisis in late 1990. In January 1991 the FDIC seized Bank of New England's three subsidiary banks‚ÄîBank of New England Trust Company, Connecticut Bank and Trust, and Maine National Bank‚Äîand placed them into Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation. To avoid an expected bank run due to panic, the FDIC insured all accounts, even those above the $100,000 insurance limit, with the total cost of the bailout estimated at $2.3 billion. The FDIC indicated that a panic at the Bank of New England would have created a systemic risk to the entire financial markets. Even with the additional assurance, over a billion and a half dollars were withdrawn from the bank in the days leading up to the seizure, compounding the effect of withdrawals that had taken place over the prior year of turmoil at the bank. These withdrawals occurred in long Depression-era lines that were widely reported in the press. The Bank of New England Trust Company in West Palm Beach, Florida which was a subsidiary of the Bank of New England was not taken over and was instead sold off as part of the liquidation process. Liquidation Subsequently three bridge banks were set up to oversee the assets of the Bank of New England, Connecticut Bank & Trust Company, and Maine National Bank. These bridge banks were transferred to Fleet/Norstar Financial Group and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and operated by Fleet, and later Bank of America, as the Recoll Management Corporation, collecting loans owed to the defunct banks. Major payments were made in 1998 for $140 million in claims and in the end secured creditors received 100% of their money while unsecured creditors received 34 cents on the dollar.

The son of former Somerset all- rounder Johnny Lawrence, and like him a right-handed middle-order batsman and a leg-spin bowler, Miles Lawrence made 33 in his debut innings as an 18-year- old for Somerset late in the 1959 season. In the next match, he performed even better: he took 45 minutes to score his first run but then made 35 and shared a 118-run sixth-wicket partnership with his captain, Maurice Tremlett, before finishing off a victory for Somerset with three of the last four Nottinghamshire wickets. Those bowling figures of three for 44 were to remain his best, however. In 1960, he played five games without bettering his personal batting or bowling bests. The following year, he was given an extended run on the Somerset side, playing in 10 of the first 12 first-class matches. He was used almost entirely as a batsman, bowling just seven overs and failing to take a wicket. In 18 innings, two of them not out, he made only 199 runs at an average of 12.43. This included his highest score of 41, made against Middlesex at Taunton. He left Somerset at the end of the season, and did not play first-class cricket again. Miles Lawrence returned to Yorkshire where he was associated with his father's indoor cricket schools business and coached at Leeds Grammar School. In Yorkshire league cricket, he became a wicketkeeper. He died just four months after his father, aged 48.

It has been speculated that these two groups are the result of separate waves of colonisations, with the yellow-throated being the result of an early colonisation, and the white-throated the result of a secondary colonisation. The yellow-throated are found on most northern and central islands (Vanua Levu, Viti Levu, Taveuni, Ovalau, Kioa, Rabi, Koro and Vatu Vara), while the white-throated are found on some southern islands (Kadavu, Gau and southern Lau Islands. =Vocalisations= Song Vidawa, Taveuni, Fiji Isles References Fiji whistler Birds of Fiji Endemic fauna of Fiji Fiji whistler ","title":"Fiji whistler"},{"id":"20685057","text":"Platysolenites is a genus of agglutinated foraminifera known from Ediacaran and lower Cambrian assemblages.

Peterson opened his first store in 1964, which grew to a regional consumer electronics, home appliance, and furniture chain in the 1970s. His memorable television commercials and unusual promotions made him a widely recognized personality in the Portland area by the 1980s, leading to several cameo appearances in the films of Gus Van Sant. In the early 1990s, having acquired and been unable to successfully integrate a competing chain of electronics stores, Peterson filed for bankruptcy protection before reemerging as a scaled-down furniture retailer that offered minimal electronics. He continued appearing in his own commercials into the early 2000s, and the store's final location closed in February 2009. Early life Peterson was born outside St. Paul, Minnesota, where he grew up on a farm, the son of a federal government worker. He studied business at the University of Minnesota. Peterson met his future wife Gloria, also from the St. Paul area, at a Lutheran church camp at Green Lake in northern Minnesota at the age of 14. The two were married on September 20, 1952. Tom Peterson's =Founding and expansion= Peterson spent ten years working at the Jolly Green Giant Co., rising to eastern regional manager in charge of 17 food processing plants in the United States and Canada. However, the western regional manager was the son of the company's president, so in 1963 Peterson obtained a franchise from Muntz television, sold his home for US$10,000, which he put into the business, and moved with Gloria to Portland on the advice of friends. He opened his first store at Southeast 82nd and Foster Road in 1964. Peterson paid himself a salary of $100 a week and $50 a week to Gloria, who was the controller of the business. In 1964, his first year in business, Peterson had revenues of $300,000. By 1989, Peterson was selling $30 million per year. It was during this period that Peterson first achieved fame in Portland and throughout the Pacific Northwest. By the early 1980s, Peterson had become one of the largest home electronics dealerships in Portland, alongside Smith's Home Furnishings, Stereo Super Stores, Montgomery Ward and Sears. Peterson went on to open stores in Eugene, Gresham, Hillsboro, North Portland and as far away as Spokane, Washington but later closed these stores, citing an inability to offer the personal service by appearing on the floor alongside his sales staff. The Petersons' children also worked in the business, daughter Kathy as a personnel manager and son Keith as a partner in an affiliated electronics import-export business, operating out of Boston. =Bankruptcy and reorganization= In September 1989, Peterson outbid two challengers to acquire Stereo Super Stores, whose parent company had filed for bankruptcy the month before, paying $940,000 plus another $1,000,000 for inventory. The acquisition included a car stereo specialty shop at Mall 205, Car Stereo East. Peterson continued to operate the franchise's locations at Jantzen Beach and Washington Square Too without a branding change until March 1991, when he renamed them Tom Peterson Super Stores, as he did his original home electronics store at 82nd and Foster. Peterson explained that the original stores were performing better than the newly acquired outlets, so he decided to combine them. His other two stores and car specialty store were unaffected. The former Tom Peterson's store at the corner of SE 82nd and Foster.In August 1991, Peterson closed his Jantzen Beach location and in October filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, listing liabilities of $7.5 million owed to 283 creditors on assets of $2.7 million. He also faced lawsuits from suppliers and AT&T; Commercial Finance. At the time of the filing, Peterson said: \\"I should have listened to my wife. She said, 'Don't buy Stereo Super Stores.' She was right.\\" Peterson said sales shrank 16 percent in the company's 1991 fiscal year compared to 1990, and that his business had been in the red every month but one in the 25 months since the buyout. Peterson said at the time: \\"They should have been called Stereo Stupid Stores.\\" Peterson closed his furniture store at 82nd and Foster, consolidating all operations in his two remaining stores, but kept his ads on the air. At Gloria's suggestion, immediate subsequent television spots referred to the bankruptcy, spelling out the troubles and asking customers to please buy today. A crisis manager took control of operations, leaving Peterson to work the sales floors until the stores closed in March 1992. Peterson said in 1995, \\"The big nationals make it very tough on the regional, like Smith's, and on the locals, like us.\\" However, Peterson did not lay all of the blame on national retailers, saying \\"In life, we are all carpenters of our own crosses. Don't blame someone else.\\" =Tom Peterson & Gloria's Too!= Sign outside last Tom Peterson's location in late 2008.In September 1992, Peterson reopened for business at his original location, an showroom at 8130 Southeast Foster Road, under the name Tom Peterson & Gloria's Too! Peterson's son-in-law Robert Condon became president, daughter Kathy the store's accountant and Gloria Peterson resumed duties as chief financial officer. Peterson himself remained the primary public face of the company, and resumed his familiar advertising. Condon raised a portion of the new venture's seed money from the sale of Tom Peterson memorabilia, having bought hundreds of wristwatches and alarm clocks from the bankruptcy trustee, then reselling them at a profit. By 1995, Peterson and a staff of 18 were selling $5 million worth of household durables per year, having shown a profit in 23 of 25 years. As of 2002, Peterson was working \\"part time\\" 44 hours per week, half of what he once had put in, and booking $4 million in sales per year. In the mid-2000s, the Petersons sold their last remaining property at the corner of Southeast 82nd and Foster and moved the store to a side street a block away, just off 82nd Avenue. The final location closed on February 28, 2009. Television advertising Peterson is widely known in Portland for writing and starring in his own local TV commercials, for his trademark flattop haircut, catch phrases including \\"Free is a very good price\\" and referring to his store as \\"the happy place to buy.\\" In the 1980s, Peterson was described by Oregonian columnist Margie Boul√© as \\"arguably, the most recognizable man in Portland.\\" From the 1960s, Peterson was a frequent sponsor of KPTV's Portland Wrestling programs and often appeared live at the now defunct Portland Sports Arena to advertise items from his store. He advertised regularly on Portland Wrestling until the show was cancelled in 1991. Peterson's most famous commercials were his late night \\"Wake up! Wake up!\\" spots, which began airing in the mid-1970s. Peterson borrowed the idea from another retailer in Corpus Christi, Texas. Said Peterson, \\"Somebody told me about it and I followed it up. Ours was much more successful than theirs. They didn't have the store owner or a strong personality doing theirs.\\" Peterson kept his stores open from 11 a.m. to 3 a.m. to accommodate customers inspired by the ad to visit his store late at night. The \\"Wake up!\\" commercials continued to run through the 1980s, though less frequently, and last aired in 1988. In 1987, Peterson experimented with hiring an outside firm to produce a series of commercials, a first in 23 years on the air. The new commercials parodied daytime soap operas, featuring a housewife named Monica whose domestic problems are solved by merchandise from Peterson's stores. Commenting on his television advertisements in 1987, Peterson said: \\"It's probably the best-known commercial in town, but not the best-liked one.\\" Peterson continued to write and star in his own commercials into the early 2000s. ing Special promotions =Tom Peterson haircuts= In July 1986, Peterson offered a free flattop haircut to anyone who attended the opening of his third store at 82nd and Foster. Peterson, who got his first flattop haircut in 1952, hired three barbers to give haircuts on the floor of his showrooms. They gave about 50 haircuts the first day, and Peterson decided to make the gimmick a weekly event. He continued offering the haircuts for two decades and as of 2002 was still giving away about ten haircuts per week. =Halloween masks= Starting Halloween 1986, Peterson offered visitors free cardboard masks with his face on it. All 5,000 went in a single year. In 1987, Peterson said, \\"We thought about doing a better mask, with a more realistic Tom Peterson on it. But then we thought, what if somebody robs a bank wearing one, and the witnesses say, 'It was Tom Peterson!' So we're sticking with the black and white cardboard.\\" =Alarm clocks= A Tom Peterson alarm clock. In October 1990, after he had ceased running the \\"Wake up!\\" TV spots, Peterson debuted an alarm clock in the shape of a television set with his face in the center and voice as the alarm, saying: \\"Wake up! Wake up to a happy day!\\" Peterson said of the promotion at the time: \\"If you can put your face in 5,000 homes in Portland, it certainly can't hurt.\\" =Wristwatches= Peterson has cited as his most successful promotion the Tom Peterson watch, also featuring his face. Peterson said in 1988: \\"It particularly went well with college youth. They're a big thing on campus. I guess it's kind of a cult thing.\\" Northwest native Kurt Cobain wore a Tom Peterson wristwatch, as did David Foraker, the attorney representing the creditors in Peterson's bankruptcy case. =Other promotions= Other Peterson giveaways included hats, T-shirts, cups and coloring books. Peterson also turned a bus into a trolley that traveled a circuit around his parking lots on 82nd and Foster. To mark the tenth anniversary of Tom Peterson & Gloria's Too! and the couple's fiftieth wedding anniversary in September 2002, Peterson offered customers coffee mugs with photos of Tom and Gloria, fifty years ago and present day. In media =Film roles= Peterson has made three cameo appearances in the films of Gus Van Sant, and as of 1995 had appeared in more Van Sant films than any other actor. His first was Drugstore Cowboy, in which a Peterson commercial plays on the television. Van Sant later cast Peterson in a non-speaking role as a police chief in My Own Private Idaho and used another Peterson commercial in To Die For. Peterson also appeared in a small role in Mr. Holland's Opus, which was filmed in Portland. Van Sant related to the Los Angeles Times, \\"So many people responded that I decided to keep using him.\\" Van Sant and Peterson have used the same video editor, Wade Evans, and Van Sant bought his Magic Chef refrigerator from Peterson. =Celebrity appearances= Peterson served as the best man at a wedding planned by the \\"Morning Zoo\\" of radio station KKRZ (Z-100) FM in 1989. Professional wrestler Rowdy Roddy Piper officiated. Peterson, who had never met the 24-year-old groom, called him \\"a very nice young gentleman.\\" He also played bongo drums on Where's the Art?, a public- access television cable TV show with Stephanie Pierce, proprietor of the 24 Hour Church of Elvis. =Tom Peterson art= Peterson is the subject of several works by Portland artist Norman Forsberg. They include the 1989 painting \\"Sphinxface\\" and \\"Six Toms and a Bob\\", pairing Peterson's face with that of Bob the Weather Cat, then a fixture of KATU local news. Forsberg, on Peterson: \\"Most pop icons are entertainers or athletes. Whereas he's someone selling televisions. That says something.\\" Peterson's face was also appropriated by Portland stencil artists who spray-painted graffiti with the caption \\"Trust Tom\\", often modifying pre-existing \\"Trust Jesus\\" graffiti by adding Peterson's name and face. Tom Peterson‚Äôs face icon and name appear on several stores in the comic book Boris the Bear #2, published by Portland company Dark Horse Comics and created by Portland artist James Dean Smith. =In music= In 1987, Z-100 radio personality Dan Clark and musician Roger Sause wrote a song, \\"I Woke Up with a Tom Peterson Haircut\\", which featured a singing part for Peterson. The station sold 5,000 copies of the single, donating the proceeds to charity, and continued running the song into the 1990s. In addition to wearing a Tom Peterson wristwatch, Nirvana lead singer Kurt Cobain also was photographed wearing a Tom Peterson T-shirt at live concerts. Personal life During his bankruptcy, Peterson started a second business as a motivational speaker, which he continued until 2001. Peterson lived with his wife in a one-story Craftsman-style home in Happy Valley, Oregon. He was a fan of upland bird hunting, specifically the chukar. In later years, he suffered from Parkinson's disease. He died on July 25, 2016 at the age of 86.

Species, as defined in the Act for listing purposes, is a taxonomic species or subspecies of plant or animal, or in the case of vertebrate species, a distinct population segment. Criteria for designation The criteria for designation of a population or group of populations as a DPS was most recently articulated in a 1996 joint USFWS-NMFS policy (61 FR 4722: February 7, 1996): Three elements are considered in a decision regarding the status of a possible DPS as endangered or threatened under the Act. These are applied similarly for addition to the lists of endangered and threatened wildlife and plants, reclassification, and removal from the lists: # Discreteness of the population segment in relation to the remainder of the species to which it belongs; # The significance of the population segment to the species to which it belongs; and # The population segment's conservation status in relation to the Act's standards for listing (i.e., is the population segment, when treated as if it were a species, endangered or threatened?). =Discreteness= A population segment of a vertebrate species may be considered discrete if it satisfies either one of the following conditions: # It is markedly separated from other populations of the same taxon as a consequence of physical, physiological, ecological, or behavioral factors. Quantitative measures of genetic or morphological discontinuity may provide evidence of this separation. # It is delimited by international governmental boundaries within which differences in control of exploitation, management of habitat, conservation status, or regulatory mechanisms exist that are significant in light of section 4(a)(1)(D) of the Act. =Significance= If a population segment is considered discrete under one or more of the above conditions, its biological and ecological significance will then be considered in light of Congressional guidance (see Senate Report 151, 96th Congress, 1st Session) that the authority to list DPSes be used \\"...sparingly\\" while encouraging the conservation of genetic diversity. In carrying out this examination, the Services [USFWS and NMFS] will consider available scientific evidence of the discrete population segment's importance to the taxon to which it belongs. This consideration may include, but is not limited to, the following: # Persistence of the discrete population segment in an ecological setting unusual or unique for the taxon, # Evidence that loss of the discrete population segment would result in a significant gap in the range of a taxon, # Evidence that the discrete population segment represents the only surviving natural occurrence of a taxon that may be more abundant elsewhere as an introduced population outside its historic range, or # Evidence that the discrete population segment differs markedly from other populations of the species in its genetic characteristics. Because precise circumstances are likely to vary considerably from case to case, it is not possible to describe prospectively all the classes of information that might bear on the biological and ecological importance of a discrete population segment. =Status= If a population segment is discrete and significant (i.e., it is a distinct population segment) its evaluation for endangered or threatened status will be based on the Act's definitions of those terms and a review of the factors enumerated in section 4(a)of the Act. It may be appropriate to assign different classifications to different DPSes of the same vertebrate taxon. Priorities The Fish and Wildlife Service's Listing and Recovery Priority Guidelines (48 FR 43098; September 21, 1983) generally afford DPSes the same consideration as subspecies, but when a subspecies and a DPS have the same numerical priority, the subspecies receives higher priority for listing. The Services will continue to generally accord subspecies higher priority than DPSes. Relationship to evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) In consideration of Pacific salmon for listing under the Act, NMFS has relied on the evolutionarily significant unit (ESU) concept and previous developed a policy on the definition of species under the Act (56 FR 58612‚Äì 58618; November 20, 1991). The policy applies only to species of salmonids native to the Pacific. Under this policy, a stock of Pacific salmon is considered a DPS if it represents an evolutionarily significant unit (ESU) of a biological species. A stock must satisfy two criteria to be considered an ESU: (1) It must be substantially reproductively isolated from other conspecific population units; and (2) It must represent an important component in the evolutionary legacy of the species. The 1996 joint policy considers the 1991 NMFS policy on Pacific salmon to be consistent with the joint policy, being a detailed extension of it. The joint policy further states that NMFS will continue to exercise the 1991 policy with respect to Pacific salmonids. References Waples, R.S. 1991.

The lack of glaciated terrain accounts for high hills, bluffs, and ridges. The Chippewa, Black, La Crosse, Kickapoo, Baraboo, Lemonweir, Pine, Wisconsin, Grant, Platte and Pecatonia rivers and their tributaries create deeply eroded valleys that contrast the nearby peaks. One dramatic example is Wildcat Mountain State Park. The Baraboo Range anchors the eastern edge where the Wisconsin River turns and runs through the area to the Mississippi River. The Baraboo Range is a monadnock in Sauk County and a National Natural Landmark formed 1.6 billion years ago featuring Devil's Lake, an endorheic lake. Its first use appears to have been in Edwin James' three- volume work, \\"An Account of an Expedition from Pittsburgh to the Rocky Mountains, Performed in the Years 1819, 1820... under the Command of Maj. S.H. Long\\" (London, 1823). James wrote, \\"The only hills worthy of particular notice, not only in this variety, but in the whole section under consideration, are the Ocooch and Smokey mountains, which are broad and elevated ridges rather than mountains. The former is situated about twelve miles north of the Wisconsin one hundred miles above its mouth...\\" He later says, \\"The third is a range of hilly and broken country, commencing on the Wisconsin near the Portage, and extending northwardly to Lake Superior. To this range we have taken the liberty to give the name of the Wisconsin Hills. The Ocooch and Smoke Mountains before mentioned, are connected with this range.\\" James's description suggests that the term Ocooch was used only for the southernmost portion of the Wisconsin Western Uplands. Three years later, Maj. Stephen Long led a second expedition, this time into the upper Mississippi Valley. It was described in William Keating's \\"Narrative of an Expedition to the Source of St. Peter's River\\" (London, 1825). In volume two, page 214, Keating wrote of western Wisconsin, \\"To this region the name of the Wisconsin Hills has been given, which are terminated on the south by the Ocooch and Smoky Mountains, whose altitude is about twelve hundred feet above the common level, or two thousand feet above tide water. Its aspect is exceedingly diversified by hills and vallies, the former of which are high and rugged, supporting a heavy growth of pine, &c.; while the latter often present extensive flats, abounding in lakes, swamps, and ponds, yielding wild rice in great abundance and perfection.\\" Keating's report on the 1823 Long expedition included a \\"Map of the country embracing the route of the expedition of 1823 commanded by Major S.H. Long\\". The name Ocooch is placed on this map approximately where the Baraboo Hills are located. Hachures extend the range to the north and northwest, but the implication is that the name Ocooch applied only to its southernmost end. An 1833 map, \\"Northwest and Michigan Territories\\" issued by Baldwin and Craddock for the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge also depicted the western highlands of Wisconsin. Unlike James and Keating, it placed the label Ocooch Mountains further north, at the headwaters of the Black, La Crosse, Kickapoo and Pine rivers. It showed the range running roughly north-northeast through modern La Crosse, Jackson, Clark and Taylor counties.\\"Wisconsin State Historical Society\\", \\"Term: Ocooch Definition:\\" https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&term;_id=3901&term;_type_id=2&term;_type_text=Places&letter;=O The vowels and consonants of Ocooch and their order are correct for the Ioway language, a Siouan language. The Ho Chunk, a related Native American tribe, called them a name phonetically similar to Ocooch, waxoj, pronounced WAH-KOH- CH(e). The Ioway-Otoe-Missouria emerged from the Oneota cultural group in western Wisconsin. Evidence of their presence is found throughout the Wisconsin Western Uplands as far north as Lake Pepin, and Red Wing, Minnesota, over to Effigy Mounds National Monument, the Upper Iowa River, and La Crosse, Wisconsin dated from AD 900 to 1700. Decimated by epidemics, the Ioway left the area after the Otoe-Missouria and as the Algonquin language speaking Sac and Fox and Kickapoo peoples came from Michigan fleeing the Iroquois as a result of the French and Indian Wars, or Beaver Wars.

They are located near the Tropic of Capricorn in the southern Great Barrier Reef, 107 km due east of Gladstone, Queensland, Australia, and 412 km north of the state capital Brisbane. The island is the fourth island in the Great Barrier Reef chain of islands (with the first being Lady Elliot Island), and is part of the Capricorn and Bunker Group of islands, forming part of the Capricornia Cays National Park as well as part of the Capricornia Cays Important Bird Area. Most people only see the island by the more easily reached Lady Musgrave Island, which can be readily reached by fast catamaran from the town of 1770, Queensland, or from Gladstone, both of which are located approximately five hours' drive north of Brisbane. The pair of Hoskyn cays are *East Hoskyn *West Hoskyn Geomorphology and landscape The eastern cay is composed of shingle and supports vegetation similar to, although less well-developed than, that of Lady Musgrave Island. The western cay is composed of sand and its vegetation is similar to that of the larger sand cays Capricorn Group. Both cays have increased in size since 1936. The Capricorn and Bunker Cays form part of a distinct geomorphic province at the southern end of the Great Barrier Reef.Hopley, D. (1982) The Geomorphology of the Great Barrier Reef - Quaternary Development of Coral Reefs. Wiley-Interscience Publication, John Wiley and Sons Ltd., New York The cays and their reefs lie on the western marginal shelf, and are separated from the mainland by the Curtis Channel. The cays are not generally visible from the mainland, although Masthead Island may be viewed from Mount Larcom on a clear day. Geologically the cays are young, having developed during the Holocene period, they are mostly around 5000 years old. The sea level was much lower during the last Ice Age (at the end of the Pleistocene period) and the coastal plain on which today's reefs and cays developed was completely exposed. Early in the Holocene (around 10,000 years ago) the sea level began to rise, until it stabilised at its present level around 6000 years ago. Once the sea level stabilised, it was possible for reef flats to expand and provide potential sites for the formation of cays. Hoskyn Reefs is a Closed Ring Reef.William Graham Henderson Maxwell - Atlas of the Great Barrier Reef Elsevier, 1968 The cays occur on planar reefs of various sizes and with various levels of exposure to the prevailing winds. These factors have largely determined cay size and composition, which consists either of shingle, sand, or a mixture of both. Cay stability is profoundly affected by cyclonic disturbance. The coral cays belong to two distinct types:Fairbridge, R. W. 1950b. Recent and Pleistocene coral reefs of Australia. J. Geol. 58: 330-401 # Vegetated sand cays: Hoskyn (West). # Shingle cays: Hoskyn (East). The sand cay is located to the lee of their reef flat, whereas the shingle cay is located on the windward side.Mather and Bennett, 1993 A Coral Reef Handbook: a guide to the geology, flora and fauna of the Great Barrier Reef, 3rd Ed. Australian Coral Reef Society Handbook Series  History  =Discovery= In 1803 Captain Eber Bunker of the whaling ship was the first European to discover the region and gave his name to the southern group. The southern cays and reefs were first chartered between 1819 and 1821 by Lieutenant Phillip Parker King of the Royal Navy initially in Mermaid and later in Bathurst. The main charting exercise for all the islands and reefs was carried out in 1843 under the command of Captain Francis Blackwood in which was accompanied by . The naturalist, Professor J. Beete Jukes, was on board Fly and his published journal provides valuable information on some of the cays. =Mining of guano 1930s= The mining of guano (bird droppings) had occurred earlier during the 1890s on Lady Musgrave Island, Fairfax and North West Island . This was an extension of a more substantial guano mining operation on Lady Elliot Island to the south. Yet later during September 1933 the leases and guano rights of Fairfax and Hoskyn Islands, off Gladstone, were sold by auction at Gladstone. They were bought on behalf of the Barrier Reef Phosphate (Guano) Syndicate.The Courier-Mail Saturday 16 September 1933 It is unsure if the project ever succeeded in the removal of guano from Hoskyn Islands, but as can be seen from the below newspaper article the company intended to remove a significant quantity of the accumulated droppings of innumerable birds for use as a fertiliser: > The Barrier Reef Phosphate (Guano) Syndicate interests on the north-east > coast of Queensland have been taken over by Phosphates Pty, Ltd, a private > company formed with a capital of ¬£10,000 to work guano deposits and exploit > other products The Bunker Group includes Lady Musgrave, Fairfax, and Hoskyn > Islands, as they run m that order north of Lady Elliott Island The new > company has secured leases of Fairfax and Hoskin, and the right to remove > guano there from.

Early life Boyle was the eldest surviving son of Edmund Boyle, 7th Earl of Cork and his first wife Anne, daughter of Kelland Courtenay. Career Commissioned an ensign in the 22nd Regiment of Foot on 16 April 1785, he was promoted to lieutenant in the 100th Regiment of Foot on 10 December 1785. On 27 May 1787, he was commissioned a lieutenant in the Somersetshire Regiment of Militia, and was promoted from captain-lieutenant to captain on 22 April 1789. On 27 January 1791, he was promoted captain in an independent company, from a lieutenancy in the 34th Regiment of Foot, and shortly thereafter exchanged into the 14th Regiment of Foot. On 5 April 1794, he was promoted to major in the recently raised 87th Regiment of Foot, and was promoted to lieutenant-colonel in the regiment on 19 July. On 20 January 1795, he exchanged into the 11th Regiment of Foot. Dungarvan exchanged into the captaincy of a company in the Coldstream Guards on 21 May 1796, and was appointed an aide-de-camp to George III on 9 January 1798. In July 1803, he exchanged from the half-pay of the 4th Regiment of Foot to become colonel of a reserve battalion of infantry, the 16th Garrison Battalion. On 27 May 1825, he was breveted general.

In Somerset he lived at Marston House within the grounds of Marston Bigot Park. He employed Jeffry Wyattville in 1817 to embellish the central block with four Ionic columns. Wyattville was known locally for his work at Longleat and then at the Church of St John the Baptist, Frome in the same decade. In 1821, on the corner of the then named Hill Street and the Market Place in Frome, the Earl was persuaded by Thomas Bunn to build an Assembly Room above a covered market, in the style of the Greek revival; in 1822, the street was renamed Cork Street. He had been shown by Bunn an image of the Roman Forum as 'a good design for a modern market-place'; he had demurred and 'thought of economy and said it would not pay'. Bunn's persuasion paid off; it remains one of Frome's notable buildings, now a bank with the ground floor enclosed. They worked together on various other projects, including the National and Christ Church Schools, with the Earl as the chair of committee. The Earl contributed to local charities such as the Blanket Fund and the Coal Fund, both for the relief of the poor, and chaired meetings of the Frome Savings Bank. Thomas Bunn thought highly of him as 'a kind friend to the inhabitants of Frome'. In November 1838 he recorded an incident in the Magistrate's Court when, finding the room very crowded, the Earl took up his own coat from the bench beside him and offered Bunn a seat: 'not as a mark of attention to me but of gentlemanly conduct'. He died on 29 June 1856 and was succeeded by his grandson Richard. In 1857 his youngest son, Richard Boyle, vicar of Marston, had a school and schoolhouse built \\"For The Benefit of The Poor And in Memory of His father\\" on Tuckmarsh Lane along the south-east boundary of the family estate.

Shell description  The shell is small, subcylindrical, smooth shining. Growth lines are very fine, a little oblique. Apex is smooth. The color of the shell is dark chest-nut. The shell has 5 rounded whorls, that are somewhat regularly increasing and decreasing to a bluntly rounded apex. Sutures are impressed. The aperture is obscurely semicircular, lateral and truncated above. The \\"circumference\\" of the aperture is \\"made up of two curves of different radius uniting in the peristome, where the junction causes an angle projecting inwards, the smaller curve comprising about one-fourth part and forming the superior portion of the peristome. The aperture has six teeth as follows: two sharp, projecting teeth of about equal size placed on the parietal wall and dividing that region into three nearly equal parts; one on the columella, large, massive, broad; a third placed on the outer lip above or at the junction of the two radii, long, curved, ridge- like, pointing directly between the two parietal teeth; a fourth on the base of the lip, small, conical, tubercular; and one large, entering, elevated, long lamina, which begins on the base of the lip and curves backward until it disappears behind the columella tooth (this is the \\"gular lamina\\" of Sterki). Peristome is white or brownish-white, reflected, the terminations separated, but joined by a prominent callus. The umbilicus is well marked, open, deep. Base of the shell is rounded. The width of the shell is 0.80-0.90 mm. The height of the shell is 0.90-1.40 mm. The height of aperture is 0.25-0.30 mm.  Anatomy  The animal is similar in form to the other species of Vertigo. The color is dirty white, darker on the upper surface. The foot is very broad, posterior of the center, from whence it tapers rapidly to a point. The foot is thick and fleshy and well able to support the light shell. Eye-peduncles are of medium length, somewhat enlarged at the tips, where the eyes are placed. The jaw is very slightly arcuate, the ends a trifle rounded. Concave margin is notched and anterior surface lightly striated. The jaw is of equal width throughout its length. The formula of the radula is like this: 2 7 7 \\\\+ + + + 2 7 7 Teeth are as in the other members of the genus. There are four perfect lateral teeth and the first marginal tooth is similar but with a second outer cusp. From this point the marginals become wider, the inner cusp remains always the larger, and the outer cusp develops from five to seven small cusps or denticles.

Partial deficiencies have been observed in several caucasian families. The deficiency is transmitted through an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. The gene for Enolase 1 has been localized to Chromosome 1 in humans. Enolase deficiency, like other glycolytic enzyme deficiences, usually manifests in red blood cells as they rely entirely on anaerobic glycolysis. Enolase deficiency is associated with a spherocytic phenotype and can result in hemolytic anemia, which is responsible for the clinical signs of Enolase deficiency.  Symptoms  Symptoms of enolase deficiency include exercise-induced myalgia and generalized muscle weakness and fatigability, both with onset in adulthood. Symptoms also include muscle pain without cramps, and decreased ability to sustain long term exercise.  Causes  Genetics is found to be the cause of enolase deficiency. The individual in the first known case of this deficiency was heterozygous for the gene for Œ≤-enolase, and carried two missense mutations, one inherited from each parent. His muscle cells synthesized two forms of Œ≤-enolase, each carrying a different mutation. These mutations changed glycine at position 374 to glutamate (G374E) and glycine at position 156 to aspartate (G156D).  Pathophysiology  The enolase enzyme catalyzes the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate; this is the ninth step in glycolysis. Enolase is a dimeric protein formed from three subunits, Œ±, Œ≤, and Œ≥, encoded by different genes. The Œ±Œ± homodimer assumes all enolase activity in the early stages of embryo development and in some adult tissues. In tissues that need large amounts of energy, the Œ±Œ≥ and Œ≥Œ≥ in the brain, and Œ±Œ≤ and Œ≤Œ≤ in striated muscles these forms of enolase are present. At all stages of development, Œ≤-enolase expression is only found in striated muscles. In adult humans, the Œ≤Œ≤ homodimer accounts for more than 90% of total enolase activity in muscle. Two mutations in the ENO3 gene, the gene encoding Œ≤-enolase, is responsible for the deficiency, both mutations changed highly conserved amino acid residues. One of the changes was of a glycine residue at position 374 to aspartate, this amino acid change was located in close proximity to the His residue of human enolase, which is an important part of the Œ≤-enolase catalytic site, while the glycine at position 156 changed to glutamate, which may have brought about change the secondary structure of the enzyme. These mutations may impair activity by significantly reducing the steady- state level of the protein, rather than produce a non- functional mutant protein. Mutations of the Œ≤-enolase dimer complexes might result in incorrect folding and increased susceptibility to protein degradation thus causing the deficiency. Similar mutations on yeast showed destabilization of the protein and decreased substrate affinity. Destabilization of the protein results in partial dissociation, some researchers propose that in muscle cells this dissociation may be perceived as an abnormality leading to degradation of the mutated enolase.

He was the father of the violinist Nigel Kennedy. John Kennedy was born in London. His parents were Australians, the cellist Lauri Kennedy and the pianist Dorothy Kennedy. He studied at the Royal Academy of Music (RAM). At age 24 he became first cello with the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, making him the youngest principal in Great Britain. He joined the Sydney Symphony Orchestra in 1949, as principal, where he performed as soloist in such works as the Elgar Cello Concerto under Otto Klemperer. He taught at the New South Wales Conservatorium of Music for two years and appeared in concerts for Musica Viva Australia. In 1952 he toured New Zealand as part of the Llewellyn-Kennedy Piano Trio with the violinist Ernest Llewellyn and the pianist Scylla Stoner - who was billed as \\"Scylla Kennedy\\", John's first wife. He returned to the UK, where he was principal cello at Covent Garden. He later became the principal cellist with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra under Sir Thomas Beecham. He was the first person to perform a cello concerto at the Edinburgh Festival. He returned to Australia as senior cello lecturer at the University of Melbourne Conservatorium. When he left the UK, he ended his marriage with Scylla Stoner. When they divorced he was not aware that Scylla was pregnant by him, and she later gave birth to his son, who was to become famous as the violinist Nigel Kennedy (born 28 December 1956). His mother wanted Nigel taught a string instrument but chose the violin because she did not want a cello in the house as a reminder of John Kennedy. John and Nigel Kennedy did not meet until Nigel was 11. John married the Welsh soprano Joan Dargavel, and had more children (Nigel‚Äôs half- siblings), including the bassist Debbie Kennedy and the cellist Laurien Kennedy, who won the 1978 ABC Young Performers Award. John and Joan divorced in 1975. He had a fourth child in 1976, violinist, Erica Kennedy (1st violinist in the Flinders String Quartet). He continued teaching, playing and broadcasting in Australia until he retired in 1979 due to ill health. John Kennedy became an alcoholic and died of liver failure in 1980, at Box Hill, Melbourne.

He was awarded the country's highest sporting honour the Arjuna award in 1967. He captained the Indian National Basketball Team in the year 1965 which made its first appearance in Asian Basketball Championship. He represented the Indian team from 1964 to 1972. He is father of former Indian Team captain and Dhyan Chand Award winner Ram Kumar. Early life and background Born in Jhamri village in the [Jhajjar] district of Haryana in Jat Family, Khushi Ram spent his childhood in village and completed his education there. He joined Delhi based Army unit the Rajputana Rifles in 1950 as a Boy Recruit. Here began his interest for the game, looking at his 6' 4\\" height and good physical built the Basketball coaches in Rajputana Rifles advised him to take up the game. Khushi Ram was mentored by basketball coach Subedar Moolchand in the early stage of his career and he made his debut in National Basketball Championship in 1952 where he played for Services basketball team. Sporting career Khushi Ram began by playing for Armed Forces in initial stages of his career. From 1958 to 1968, the time he was associated with Army, the Armed Force basketball team won the National title continuously for 10 years in which he was judged as the best player many times. Khushi Ram quickly gained popularity and became a star player in India. After taking retirement from Army in the year 1969 he moved to Kota in Rajasthan and joined Shri Ram Rayons, then he represented Rajasthan team for 5 years in National Basketball Championships. In 1964 Khushi Ram was selected in the Indian National Basketball Team for the 4th Quardrangular tournament in Colombo. It was his international debut. The very next year in 1965 he was named as the captain of Indian team for Asian Basketball Championship which was held in Kuala Lumpur, though India's position was 7th in the tournament, Khushi Ram was the highest scorer of the tournament. He was the 2nd highest scorer in 1967 ABC Championship in Seoul where India secured 6th position. In a match played between India and Philippines, India faced a defeat by a big margin but Khushi Ram solely netted 40 points out of 63 points scored by the Indian team, his basket conversion percentage was 85% in all major international tournaments. During 1969 ABC Championship in Bangkok he once again topped the scoring charts in Asia. India progressed a level and stood 5th in the tournament. No other basketball player from India has ever been highest scorer in the Asian Basketball Championship. In 1970 he participated in 10th Anniversary Celebrations Championship in Manila. In this tournament he scored 196 points in 7 games including 43 points against the then powerhorse of Asia and the home team Philippines, which is the highest individual score by any Indian player. Seeing his outstanding performance the organisers in Philippines awarded him the 3 honours: 1\\\\. The most valuable player of Asia 2\\\\. The most consistent shooter in Asia 3\\\\. The best centre player of the meet At the end of the invitational tournament in Manila, former legend of Philippines Basketball Lauro Mumar who insisted Khushi Ram to leave India and play for Philippines said, \\"Khushi Ram has defined how Basketball is played, just unstoppable never saw a player of such a calibre and kind of mental and physical toughness he has in the entire Asia . I would just say that Give us Khushi Ram and we will conquer the entire world . He can rule the world of Basketball.\\" Khushi Ram is the only Basketball player from India to be honoured by these 3 prestigious trophies in his days of stardom. In the same year he was again selected to captain the Indian team for 6th Asian Games at Bangkok, but due to a severe eye injury at the training camp in NIS Patiala he could not participate in the Asian Games. In 1970 itself, the University of Illinois Springfield basketball team of United States of America came to India to play exhibition matches against the Indian team, Springfield team was recognised as the best team of that time in US and NBA D League . Americans are known for their wonderful athletic capabilities as compared to Indian athletes because of which they were comfortably winning matches against India but the strong and speedy Americans were unable to stop Khushi Ram from scoring baskets at pivot point . As reported by a newspaper reporter ((Khushi Ram is an outstanding player, Americans had a tough time while defending him and were unable to figure out on how to stop him from scoring, what a remarkable game sense he has, it's amazing to watch him in action)) Many newspapers and magazines in country published articles on him named The Magician of Basketball as he became the best ranked player of Asia. He became an inspiration for all youngsters who were keen to take up the game. During an interview in Mumbai in 2011 where Khushi Ram came as Guest of Honour in Savio Cup All India Tournament, a press reporter from The Hindustan Times interviewed him . The journalist asked him that Sir what keeps you glued to Basketball even in your 70's ? He smiles and says Basketball is my bread and butter , whatever I am today it's just because of this game , I love training kids and will continue to do it till my last breath . I am happy that my sons Ram Kumar and Ashok took the legacy forward and they respected the game in the same spirit as I did Coaching Khushi Ram also contributed his services for the game as a coach. After announcing his retirement he took over as the coach of Shri Ram Rayons Basketball team in 1976 and also coached Rajasthan Basketball team for many years. Under his coaching Shri Ram Rayons was the best team in India and won many All India tournaments. Olympians Ajmer Singh, Hanuman Singh are his best gifts to the Indian Basketball, he also coached his son, Ram Kumar, and Ashok Kumar, who was also a former India captain. He was deeply associated with the game till his last breath. During his later years, he worked as the Basketball coach at Modern School, Kota and groomed young school students in the trade of basketball. He was widely loved and regarded among the students for his coaching style. He died on 29 December 2013 when he felt chest pain while giving away the prizes in a local function at his home town. On that day he was very happy and was proud on the achievement of his followers/trainees. After his death the Haryana Government has decided to build a stadium in his village Jhamri, District. Jhajjar as a tribute to him because Khushi Ram's vision was development of children through sports and education.

It is dimorphous with tetragonal thorite, and isostructual with monazite. An uncommon mineral, huttonite forms transparent or translucent cream-colored crystals. It was first identified in samples of beach sands from the West Coast region of New Zealand by the mineralogist Colin Osborne Hutton (1910‚Äì1971). Owing to its rarity, huttonite is not an industrially useful mineral. Occurrence Huttonite was first described in 1950 from beach sand and fluvio-glacial deposits in South Westland, New Zealand, where it was found as anhedral grains of no more than 0.2 mm maximum dimension. It is most prevalent in the sand at Gillespie's Beach, near Fox Glacier, which is the type location, where it is accompanied by scheelite, cassiterite, zircon, uranothorite, ilmenite and gold. It was found at a further six nearby locations in less plentiful amounts. Huttonite was extracted from the sands by first fractionating in iodomethane and then electromagnetically. Pure samples were subsequently obtained by handpicking huttonite grains under a microscope. This was accomplished either in the presence of short wave (2540 √Ö) fluorescent light, where the dull white fluorescence distinguishes it from scheelite (fluoresces blue) and zircon (fluoresces yellow), or by first boiling the impure sample in hydrochloric acid to induce an oxide surface on scheelite and permitting handpicking under visible light. Hutton suggested the huttonite contained in the beach sand and fluvio-glacial deposits originated from Otago schists or pegmatitic veins in the Southern Alps. In addition to New Zealand, huttonite has been found in granitic pegmatites of Bogatynia, Poland, where it associated with cheralite, thorogummite, and ningyoite; and in nepheline syenites of Brevik, Norway. Physical properties Huttonite typically occurs as anhedral grains with no external crystal faces. It is usually colorless but also appears in colors; such as cream and pale yellow. It has a white streak. It has a hardness of 4.5 and exhibits distinct cleavage parallel to the c-axis [001] and an indistinct cleavage along the a-axis [100]. Structure Huttonite is a thorium nesosilicate with the chemical formula 4. It is composed (by weight) of 71.59% thorium, 19.74% oxygen, and 8.67% silicon. Huttonite is found very close to its ideal stoichiometric composition, with impurities contributing less than 7% mole fraction. The most significant impurities to be observed are 2 and 25. Atomic environment along a SiO4-ThO5 chain (parallel to the c axis) Huttonite crystallizes in the monoclinic system with space group P21/n. The unit cell contains four ThSiO4 units, and has dimensions a = 6.784 ¬± 0.002√Ö, b = 6.974 ¬± 0.003√Ö, c = 6.500 ¬± 0.003√Ö, and inter-axis angle Œ≤ = 104.92 ¬± 0.03o. The structure is that of a nesosilicate -- discrete SiO42‚àí tetrahedra coordinating thorium ions. Each thorium has coordination number nine. Axially, four oxygen atoms, representing the edges of two SiO4 monomers on opposite sides of the thorium atom, form a (-SiO4-Th-) chain parallel to the c axis. Equatorially, five nearly planar oxygen atoms representing vertices of distinct silicate tetrahedra coordinate each thorium. The lengths of the axial Th-O bonds are 2.43 √Ö, 2.51 √Ö, 2.52 √Ö, 2.81 √Ö, and of the equatorial bonds, 2.40 √Ö, 2.41 √Ö, 2.41 √Ö, 2.50 √Ö, and 2.58 √Ö. The Si-O bonds are nearly equal, with lengths 1.58 √Ö, 1.62 √Ö, 1.63 √Ö, and 1.64 √Ö. Huttonite is isostructural with monazite. Substitution of the rare-earth elements and phosphorus of monazite with thorium and silicon of huttonite can occur to generates a solid solution. At the huttonite end-member, continuous rare-earth substitution of thorium of up to 20% by weight has been observed. Thorium substitution in monazite has been observed up to 27% by weight. Substitution of PO4 for SiO4 also occurs associated with the introduction of fluoride, hydroxide, and metal ions. Huttonite is dimorphic with thorite. Thorite crystallizes in a higher symmetry and lower density tetragonal form in which the thorium atoms coordinate to one less oxygen atom in an octahedral arrangement. Thorite is stable at lower temperatures than huttonite; at 1 atmosphere, the thorite‚Äìhuttonite phase transition occurs between 1210 and 1225 ¬∞C. With increasing pressure the transition temperature increases. This relatively high transition temperature is thought to explain the relative rarity of huttonite on the Earth's crust. Unlike thorite, huttonite is not affected by metamictization.

Family He was the eldest son of Arthur James Plunkett, 7th Earl of Fingall and his wife Henrietta Wollascot, daughter and heiress of William Wollascot of Woolhampton, Berkshire. He became Earl of Fingall in 1793 upon the death of his father. He married in 1785 Frances Donelan, daughter of John Donelan of Ballydonnellan, County Galway and his wife Mabel Hore, daughter of Matthew Hore of Shandon, County Waterford; she died in 1835. They had a son, Arthur Plunkett, 9th Earl of Fingall, and a daughter, Harriet (died 1871), who married James Jones of Llanarth, Monmouthshire, and was the mother of Sir Arthur James Herbert. Fingall was appointed a Knight of the Order of St Patrick on 20 October 1821, on the occasion of the Royal Visit to Ireland of King George IV. His creation as Baron Fingall, of Woolhampton Lodge in the County of Berkshire on 20 June 1831 made him a member of the United Kingdom House of Lords. Cause of Catholic Emancipation For many years he was a champion of the cause of Catholic Emancipation, and for a time worked closely with Daniel O'Connell to secure it. In 1807 he obtained an interview with the 1st Duke of Wellington, the Chief Secretary for Ireland, who explained that Catholic Emancipation was not at that time practical politics, but that the remaining Penal Laws would be enforced with all possible moderation.Longford, Elizabeth Wellington-the Years of the Sword Panther Books 1971 As one of the leaders of the Catholic Association in its original form, which the Government maintained was illegal, he was briefly arrested, but never prosecuted.

Atomic positions oscillate, so that the perfect order of the 1-D crystal is broken.  Peierls‚Äô theorem  Peierls' theorem states that a one-dimensional equally spaced chain with one electron per ion is unstable. The lowest Bloch band of an undistorted 1D lattice. The lowest Bloch bands of a distorted 1D lattice. Energy gaps appear in ka=\\\\pm \\\\pi/2 as a result of the Peierls' instability. This theorem was first espoused in the 1930s by Rudolf Peierls. It can be proven using a simple model of the potential for an electron in a 1-D crystal with lattice spacing a. The periodicity of the crystal creates energy band gaps in the \\\\epsilon-k diagram at the edge of the Brillouin zone ka=\\\\pm\\\\pi (similar to the result of the Kronig‚ÄìPenney model, which helps to explain the origin of band gaps in semiconductors). If the ions each contribute one electron, then the band will be half-filled, up to values of ka=\\\\pm \\\\pi/2 in the ground state. Peierls distortion of a 1-d periodic lattice. Imagine a lattice distortion where every other ion moves closer to one neighbor and further away from the other, the unfavourable energy of the long bond between ions is outweighed by the energy gain of the short bond. The period has just doubled from a to 2a. In essence, the proof relies on the fact that doubling the period would introduce new band gaps located at multiples of ka=\\\\pm \\\\pi/2; see the figure in the right. This would cause small energy savings, based on the distortion of the bands in the vicinity of the new gaps. Approaching ka=\\\\pm \\\\pi/2, the distortion due to the introduction of the new band gap will cause the electrons to be at a lower energy than they would be in the perfect crystal. Therefore, this lattice distortion becomes energetically favorable when the energy savings due to the new band gaps outweighs the elastic energy cost of rearranging the ions. Of course, this effect will be noticeable only when the electrons are arranged close to their ground state ‚Äì in other words, thermal excitation should be minimized. Therefore, the Peierls transition should be seen at low temperature. This is the basic argument for the occurrence of the Peierls transition, sometimes called dimerization.  Historical background  Peierls‚Äô discovery gained experimental backing during the effort to find new superconducting materials. In 1964, Dr. William Little of the Stanford University Department of Physics theorized that a certain class of polymer chains may experience a high Tc superconducting transition. The basis for his assertion was that the lattice distortions that lead to pairing of electrons in the BCS theory of superconductivity could be replaced instead by rearranging the electron density in a series of side chains. This means that now electrons would be responsible for creating the Cooper pairs instead of ions. Because the transition temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the mass of the charged particle responsible for the distortions, the Tc should be improved by a corresponding factor: : \\\\frac{T}{T_i} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{M_i}{m_e}}. The subscript i represents \\"ion\\", while e represents \\"electron\\". The predicted benefit in superconducting transition temperature was therefore a factor of about 300. In the 1970s, various organic materials such as TTF-TCNQ were synthesized. What was found is that these materials underwent an insulating transition rather than a superconducting one. Eventually it was realized that these were the first experimental observations of the Peierls transition. With the introduction of new band gaps after the lattice becomes distorted, electrons must overcome this new energy barrier in order to become free to conduct. The simple model of the Peierls distortion as a rearrangement of ions in a 1-D chain could describe why these materials became insulators rather than superconductors.  Related physical consequences  Peierls predicted that the rearrangement of the ion cores in a Peierls transition would produce periodic fluctuations in the electron density. These are commonly called charge density waves, and they are an example of collective charge transport. Several materials systems have verified the existence of these waves. Good candidates are weakly coupled molecular chains, where electrons can move freely along the direction of the chains, but motion is restricted perpendicular to the chains. NbSe3 and K0.3MoO3 are two examples in which charge density waves have been observed at relatively high temperatures of 145 K and 180 K respectively. Furthermore, the 1-D nature of the material causes a breakdown of the Fermi liquid theory for electron behavior. Therefore, a 1-D conductor should behave as a Luttinger liquid instead. A Luttinger liquid is a paramagnetic one-dimensional metal without Landau quasi-particle excitations.  Research topics  1-D metals have been the subject of much research. Here are a few examples of both theoretical and experimental research efforts to illustrate the broad range of topics: * Theory has shown that polymer chains that have been looped and formed into rings undergo a Peierls transition. These rings demonstrate a persistent current, and the Peierls distortion can be modified by modulating the magnetic flux through the loop. * Density functional theory has been used to calculate the bond length alterations predicted in increasingly long chains of organic oligomers. The selection of which hybrid functional to use is paramount in obtaining an accurate estimate of the bond length alteration caused by Peierls distortions, as some functionals have been shown to overestimate the oscillation, while others underestimate it. * Gold deposited on a stepped Si(553) surface has shown evidence of two simultaneous Peierls transitions. The lattice period is distorted by factors of 2 and 3, and energy gaps open for nearly 1/2-filled and 1/3‚Äì1/4 filled bands. The distortions have been studied and imaged using LEED and STM, while the energy bands were studied with ARP. * Luttinger liquids have a power-law dependence of resistance on temperature. This has been shown for purple bronze (Li0.9Mo6O17). Purple bronze may prove to be a very interesting material, since it has shown renormalization of the Luttinger-liquid density of states anomalous exponent, which is one of the parameters that are used to describe Luttinger liquid behavior. * The dependence of resonant tunneling through island barriers in a 1-D wire has been studied, and is also found to be a power-law dependence. This offers additional evidence of Luttinger liquid behavior.

There are also pros and cons on development on these economic zones, the pros are creating more job opportunities, increasing its economic growth (national GDP) and encourage on foreign direct investment. As a result, it was a success because China is currently one of the fastest growing countries and significantly influencing the global economy. From the past two decades, China has become an industrialized country because of the development of these economic zones. In which encourage foreign direct investments, where trading, exports of manufacture goods, became one of the main aspect of economic growth. On the other hand, it also made it reliant on these foreign investment, such as reliant on Hong Kong for these foreign investment, due to the reason that Hong Kong is a free trade market. Based on the case in Shenzhen, its problem with being one of the economic zones can be categorized in four category 1) Foreign exchange leakage,2) Cost ineffectiveness, 3) Failure to achieve state objectives and 4) Economic crimes and related social problems.

Life Prince Josef Friedrich Wilhelm, Officer in Imperial Service, was the son of Imperial field Marshal Herman Friedrich of Hohenzollern-Hechingen and Josepha von Oettingen zu Spielberg. He succeeded his unmarried cousin, Frederick Louis, in 1750. On 25 June 1750 in Vienna, Josef married Princess Maria Theresia Folch de Cardona y Silva, the 18-year-old daughter of F√ºrst von Cardona. Maria Theresia died only three months into the marriage and left behind her family's fortune in its entirety. Marriages in the House of Hohenzollern-Hechingen were often chosen based on dowry and inheritance. In 1751, Josef married Countess Maria Theresia of Waldburg-Zeil who bore him six children, of which only the youngest daughter grew past childhood. Josef was an enthusiastic hunter and traveler. In 1764, during a stay in Bad Wildbad, he became acquainted with a Prussian Stabskapit√§n who had been released from the Prussian army after the end of the Seven Years' War. This man was Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben (1730‚Äì1794), who would spend the next 12 years as Hofmarschall in Josef's service before his role assisting George Washington in the Revolutionary War as General Inspector and Organizer of the United States Army. Steuben was also involved when the prince began to implement money- saving or money-creating policies. These include his attempt in 1772 to dissolve the court and to travel incognito with only his wife and Steuben accompanying him. He stayed for extended periods of time in Strasbourg, Montpellier, and Lyon. Josef spent much of his money and time with company, fine dining, gambling, theater, carnival, and hunting. This continued for three full years, until the princess succeeded in convincing the prince to end his masquerade. In the following years, Josef became comfortable in the position of an enlightened leader; he promoted agriculture and established compulsory education. In 1775, he founded a Gymnasium (roughly equivalent to the American high school) as well as a Latin school in the \\"Old Castle\\", and contributed to the reduction of churchly holidays despite resistance from the population. He was considered to be tolerant towards Protestants and Jews. His need for representation led to the establishment of the Collegiate church in Hechingen. In 1764, the well-renowned French architect Pierre Michel d'Ixnard was hired as the director of this construction project. Although the prince intended to always appear as a friendly father-figure for his people, he was relentless in conflicts with his subjects and was always distrustful of his potential successors. On 9 April 1798, Josef died after 48 years of reigning. Because he had no male successors, the crown passed to his nephew Hermann.

It was released on September 23, 2008 by Fervent Records and was produced by Otto Price and Susan Riley for Twelve-18 Entertainment. \\"It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year\\", \\"Carol of the Bells / Sing We Now of Christmas\\", \\"I'll Be Home for Christmas\\" and \\"Hallelujah (Light Has Come)\\" were released as singles. It is BarlowGirl's sole album to deviate from a pop rock sound, as the band opts for a traditional Christmas genre instead.  Background  When the Barlow sisters were growing up, they wished to have a baby grand piano at home. One Christmas Eve in the early 1990s, their mother convinced them to spend the day shopping. It was at that time that their father and brother moved the heavy piano inside the home. Upon noticing the piano when they returned home, the sisters had tears of joy. It was then that they began a Christmas tradition of singing carols in four-part harmony with their four female cousins. The seven girls dreamed of creating a Christmas record at that time, a dream that materialized with Home for Christmas. The four cousins, the Shell sisters (Jessica, Jodie, Jennie and Jane), indeed share vocals with the Barlow sisters on \\"Panis angelicus\\" and on the \\"Angelic Proclamation\\" medley.  Recording  Development of the album began in 2008, with all the instrumentation already recorded before the Barlows began their studio work in Franklin, TN and Nashville, TN in March 2008. In addition to being BarlowGirl's sole Christmas album, it is also the band's only album to omit rock music and have the sisters perform vocals only, despite implication to the contrary in the \\"Hallelujah (Light Has Come)\\" music video and in the album liner's band listing. This was done to make the album enjoyable to older generations, including parents and grandparents. Lauren Barlow lost her voice the week prior to recording. She notes that forsaking her drum set felt \\"weird [‚Ä¶] but it was freeing, too\\". Lauren further describes the studio environment as being Christmas-themed, from the decorations (\\"Christmas lights and garland\\") to the Christmas-only music and movie policy to the air-conditioned \\"freezing\\". The Barlows' recording session concluded in April 2008. Sarah Barlow photographed the album art in Vail, Colorado during the first week of March 2008 while the band was taking a three-day break from Winter Jam 2008. The album consists of eleven tracks, seven which focus on the birth of Jesus Christ and four festivities-focused songs which are more secular in nature. Three medleys (two Christian, one more secular) are featured on the album. For the remaining tracks, each of the sisters could include two of her favorite songs on the album. For Rebecca, this included \\"What Child Is This?\\", the only published recording where she sang lead vocals. For Alyssa, this included the Catholic hymn \\"Panis angelicus\\", the only BarlowGirl recording in a foreign language; Alyssa sang the lead vocals in Latin, while her sisters and the Shell sisters add English background vocals based on \\"O Lord Most Holy\\", the English adaptation. Both songs were released as free downloads.  Singles  * \\"It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year\\" debuted on Christian CHR charts on December 12, 2008. It peaked at No. 21 on the Billboard Christian Songs chart. This cover was used to advertise Christmas at the White House: An Oprah Winfrey Special. Oprah is among Lauren's favorite personalities. * \\"Carol of the Bells / Sing We Now of Christmas\\", a medley, also debuted on Christian CHR charts on December 12, 2008. The single was released in a cappella form as a digital download on October 27, 2009. The song peaked at No. 7 on Billboard Christian Digital Songs and at No. 21 on Billboard Christian Streaming Songs. * \\"I'll Be Home for Christmas\\" debuted on Christian CHR charts on December 19, 2008. * \\"Hallelujah (Light Has Come)\\" was released as a full HD video single by the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association on December 1, 2010. The song peaked at No. 46 on Billboard Christian Digital Songs.  Release  Home for Christmas was released worldwide on September 28, 2008 by Fervent Records. It was made available for digital download by the iTunes Store and Amazon Music.  Marketing  Warner Music Group designed a promotional site, Christmas for the Whole Family, to promote Christmas music in its roster such as BarlowGirl. Two free downloads were made available for this album: \\"What Child Is This?\\" was free on Amazon Music (then known as Amazon MP3), while \\"Panis angelicus\\" was free on iTickets. The band's merchandise store also offered Christmas merchandise for sale, including ornaments and collector tins.  Critical reception  Home for Christmas received positive reviews from music critics. Sarah Fine of New Release Today gave the album five stars out of five, writing: \\"Not only is this one of the best Christmas albums of 2008, it's one of the best that I own.\\" John Fisher of Cross Rhythms was less generous, giving the album six out of ten stars, as he deemed that \\"Go Tell It On The Mountain\\" was \\"a bit more sedate than the usual renditions\\" and the lack of rock music as \\"surely an album which will disappoint many\\". Three other critics gave the album four out of five stars: Andy Argyrakis of CCM Magazine, Russ Breimeier of Christianity Today and Lauren Summerford of Jesus Freak Hideout.

Background Pakenham Hall Castle, County Westmeath Pakenham was the eldest son of Edward Pakenham, 2nd Baron Longford, by Catherine Rowley, daughter of Hercules Rowley. His sister, the Honourable Catherine Pakenham, was the wife of the Duke of Wellington. One of his younger brothers was the Honourable Sir Edward Pakenham, a British Army officer who served under Wellington in the Peninsular War. A younger brother was Sir Hercules Robert Pakenham CB, KCB, a lieutenant-general of the British Army and was brevet colonel and aide-de-camp to the William IV of the United Kingdom.

Pakenham succeeded his father in the barony in 1792, inheriting Pakenham Hall Castle (otherwise known as Tullynally Castle) and two years later also succeeded his grandmother, Elizabeth Pakenham, 1st Countess of Longford, as second Earl of Longford.thepeerage.com Thomas Pakenham, 2nd Earl of Longford Public life Longford was one of the original 28 Irish representative peers elected to the 1st Union Parliament on 2 August 1800. He was a member of the House of Lords until his death. He was appointed a Knight of the Order of St Patrick on 17 December 1813. In 1821 he was created Baron Silchester, of Silchester in the County of Southampton, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which gave him and his descendants an automatic seat in the House of Lords. He used his influence to strongly, but unsuccessfully, oppose Catholic Emancipation. This led him to clash publicly with his brother-in-law Wellington, a convert to Emancipation who as Prime Minister steered the measure through Parliament. Family Lord Longford remodelled the 17th-century Pakenham Hall Castle in the Gothic Revival style in the early 1800s, adding towers and a moat. It was by then larger than any other castellated house in Ireland. He married Lady Georgiana Emma Charlotte Lygon, daughter of William Lygon, 1st Earl Beauchamp, in 1817. They had several children. Their third son the Honourable Thomas Alexander Pakenham was a rear-admiral in the Royal Navy and the father of Admiral Sir William Pakenham. Their seventh and youngest son the Honourable Sir Francis Pakenham was a diplomat and notably served as Ambassador to Sweden. Longford died in May 1835, aged 61, and was succeeded in the earldom by his eldest son, Edward. Longford's second son William, who eventually succeeded his brother to the earldom, was a general in the British Army. The Countess of Longford survived her husband by over 40 years and died in February 1880.

The Down constituency elected two members. Since its re-creation in 1922, it had consistently elected unionists, with all other candidates polling less than 15% of the votes cast.Craig, F. W. S. (1983) [1969]. British parliamentary election results 1918-1949 (3rd edition ed.). Chichester: Parliamentary Research Services. Until the 1945, every MP for the seat had been a member of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP). Little was elected unopposed for the UUP at a 1939 by-election. The other Down MP, Viscount Castlereagh, decided to retire at the 1945 general election, and the UUP decided to also make Little's seat subject to reselection. Little resigned from the party in protest at this, and easily held his seat as an Independent Ulster Unionist. Official Unionist Walter Smiles won the second seat, narrowly beating the second official Unionist, John Blakiston Houston and a second independent unionist, James Brown. Little took 40% of the votes, and the three other candidates around 20% each. Candidates At the by-election, the Ulster Unionist Party hoped to regain the second seat. They stood C. H. Mullan, a lieutenant in the Royal Navy,Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR) Officers 1939-1945 who had unsuccessfully contested South Down at the 1945 Northern Ireland general election. The Northern Ireland Labour Party had generally performed well at the 1945 election, although it did not win any seats. It stood Desmond Donnelly, a British politician with Irish ancestry. At the 1945 election, he had taken third place in Evesham standing for the Common Wealth Party, but had since joined the British Labour Party. Two independent unionist candidates stood: J. Hastings-Little, son of James Little,The Annual Register of World Events: A Review of the Year (1947) and James Brown, the unsuccessful candidate from the previous year, and former Stormont for South Down. Result The by-election was won by Mullan, who took more than half the votes cast. Donnelly took 29% and a clear second place, while Hastings-Little managed 17%. Brown's share of the vote collapsed to only 2%. At the 1950 general election, all remaining multi-member constituencies were abolished. Down was divided into North Down and South Down. Mullan chose to stand down and pursued his career as a solicitor. Donnelly was elected MP for Pembrokeshire in 1950 and enjoyed a colourful career, eventually joining the Conservative Party.

He served in the Danish, Dutch, and French whaling industries from 1619 to 1636, and later became a privateer.Henrat (1984), p. 545. Voyages, 1619-37 In 1619 he was among Basque whalemen recruited for a Danish whaling expedition to Spitsbergen. In the following years he continued to participate in the Danish whaling industry in one form or another. In 1624 Vrolicq served as a harpooner for the Dutch Noordsche Compagnie, and the following year he represented two Basque whaling merchants who sent ships to Spitsbergen for a Copenhagen company. In July 1629 Cardinal Richelieu gave Vrolicq a charter for whaling north of 60¬∞. In 1631 Vrolicq was master of the ship Valk (140 tons), in which he sailed to Spitsbergen in partnership with the Hamburg merchant Johan Braem, who also sent a ship to the island. The Dutch tried to expel them from their anchorage in K√∏benhavns Bay (Kobbefjorden), but failed. The following year, 1632, he parted ways with Braem and sailed under the patronage of Cardinal Richelieu and the King of France. A company was formed in Le Havre and Vrolicq was put in command of three vessels, the St.-Fran√ßois (200 tons), under Pierre Harel, the Gr√¢ce (130 tons), under Martingo de Lagairalde, and the Notre Dame des Anges (100 tons), under Jacques Godefroy. When Vrolicq reached the northwest coast of Spitsbergen early in July he was promptly expelled by the admiral of the Dutch whaling fleet, Jacob Jansz Duynkercker.Dalg√•rd (1962), p. 170. He fled to Iceland, where he obtained a paltry two whales, both found dead.Du Pasquier (2000), p. 322. In 1633 Vrolicq sailed to Spitsbergen (or Terre-Verte, as the French called it) with a fleet of four vessels. Besides Lagairalde and Harel, who again commanded the Gr√¢ce and St. Fran√ßois, respectively, the fleet included the St. Jacques (200 tons), under Jean Herault, and the Esp√©rance (250 tons), under Paul Languillet. Barred from Mauritius Bay (modern Smeerenburgfjorden) and K√∏benhavns Bay (Port-Saint- Pierre to the French) by the Dutch admiral Cornelis Ys, Vrolicq was forced to the south, where he found a tiny bay he named Refuge Fran√ßois or Port Louis (modern Hamburgbukta, lying just south of Magdalenefjorden).Du Pasquier (2000), p. 323; Dalg√•rd (1962), pp. 183-84. He returned to Port Louis in 1634, this time with a total of six vessels: Vrolicq in the Hardy, Harel and Languillet again in the St. Fran√ßois and Esp√©rance, as well as Abraham Oulson in the Lion Rouge (250 tons), one Martin in the barque La Marie, and an unnamed sixth vessel. In June, only a few days after their arrival in Port Louis, two English men-of-war, under William Goodlad, tried to expel Vrolicq and his ships, but failed. They left Spitsbergen in September, with a total catch of eighteen bowhead whales.Du Pasquier (2000), pp. 75-77, 323. In 1635 Vrolicq once more resorted to Port Louis, this time with a fleet of four vessels: the St. Jacques, under Vrolicq himself, the St. Fran√ßois, under Harel, the Lion Rouge, under Oulson, and an unnamed fourth vessel. The St. Fran√ßois was armed with 14 pieces of ordnance and the Lion Rouge with 10; both were to land four pieces at the mouth of Port Louis to prevent attack from Dutch and English vessels. The following year, 1636, Vrolicq left with five vessels. Vrolicq again sailed in the St. Jacques, Harel in the St. Fran√ßois, Oulson in the Lion Rouge, Baptiste Girard in the Avenir (120 tons), and an unnamed fifth vessel.Du Pasquier (2000), pp. 78-80, 323. Following a Spanish raid which resulted in the sacking of St-Jean-de-Luz, Ciboure, and Socoa and the capture of fourteen French Basque whaleships in 1636, Vrolicq devoted himself to privateering. Contributions to cartography A map (c. 1634) of Spitsbergen entitled La France Artique has been attributed to Vrolicq. Among the features labelled are Baie des Holandois (Smeerenburgfjorden), Port St. Pierre (Kobbefjorden), Port-Louis or Refuge Fran√ßais (Hamburgbukta, mentioned above), and Baie aux Anglois (Kongsfjorden). To the southwest of Spitsbergen lies Jan Mayen, which is labelled as Ysle de Richelieu.Henrat (1984), p. 544; Conway (1906), p. 79; among others. Dalg√•rd (1962), p. 160, says he called it Pico. Vrolicq makes the obviously spurious claim of having discovered the island in 1612. Footnotes References Henrat, P. 1984. French Naval Operations in Spitsbergen During Louis XIV‚Äôs Reign.

Miles was primarily a hard running wingman or half back but could also play up forward, especially later in his career. Recruited from Ivanhoe Amateurs in the Victorian Amateur Football Association, Miles spent three seasons at Collingwood, in which he played 31 of a possible 68 senior matches, before being delisted. He moved to Western Australia in 1985 after being recruited by Claremont, for whom he played a total of 73 senior matches over the next seven seasons. He was part of the inaugural West Coast list and debuted in their inaugural VFL game at the start of the 1987 season. Miles was a regular with the Eagles for three seasons, during which he played mostly in defence but also showed his ability in attack ‚Äì as when he kicked five goals from eight kicks in a 76-point win over Carlton during 1989. 1990, however, saw Miles struggling to get a game as a champion defence led by Guy McKenna and John Worsfold emerged. Consequently, Miles returned permanently to Claremont and played in their 1990 grand final loss to Swan Districts. The following season Miles did not play in the AFL but was a member of the Tigers' 1991 premiership team, by which time he had been moved permanently into attack and formed a deadly combination with future Brisbane, Sydney and Fremantle full-forward John Hutton.Stocks, Gary; 'Miles and Hutton in Goal Feast'; The West Australian, 10 June 1991, p. 88 He would have played for the WAFL against the SANFL but for an appointment in Victoria. A four-time Western Australian interstate representative, he was traded to Geelong in the 1991 AFL Draft, thus missing out on West Coast's premierships in 1992 and 1994. He did however take part in the 1992 AFL Grand Final with Geelong, but lost to his former club West Coast. After spending much of the first half of 1992 back in defence and then six rounds in the reserves, Miles returned to attack and upon promotion to the Cats' senior team kicked seven goals in a game against Melbourne and followed it up with five goals in each of the next two rounds. The following year 1993, Miles won a premiership with local BFL side Barwon Heads, before becoming president of that club until 2006. During this period, Miles became the foundation coach of controversial ninth Westar Rules club in 1997. The Thunder suffered a string of dreadful thrashings in 1997 and won only one game by three points, but Miles'New Setback for Peel as Miles Quits'; in The West Australian, 3 June 1998, p. 152 set a target of six wins for 1998. After the Thunder remained winless nine games into the season, however, Miles abruptly resigned, saying that he had given up trying to improve the club.

After spending several seasons in the minors, he had a breakout season in , winning the Pacific Coast League Most Valuable Player Award while playing for the A's Triple-A farm club, the Sacramento River Cats. That earned him a September call-up to the majors, where he played in seven games for Oakland. =2001: Becoming a major league regular= Before the 2001 season, Baseball America ranked him the best prospect in Oakland's farm system and the 34th-best prospect in baseball. Ortiz started the year in Oakland, but was returned to the minor leagues two weeks later after batting .179 in his first 11 games. After a second brief call-up in May Ortiz was traded to the Colorado Rockies on July 25 as part of a package that brought Jermaine Dye to Oakland. Ortiz was installed as the Rockies starting second baseman, replacing Todd Walker (who had been traded to the Cincinnati Reds). Ortiz batted .255 the rest of the way, with 13 home runs in just 204 at bats in 53 games. =2002: Sophomore slump?= Ortiz opened the season as the Rockies' starter at second again, but his power numbers declined substantially. By mid-June, while he was hitting .244, Ortiz had just one home run through the same number of games (53) in which he'd hit 13 home runs the year before. Ortiz was sent down to the Triple-A Colorado Springs Sky Sox and was replaced at second by Brent Butler. After hitting .333 with 6 home runs in 26 minor league games, Ortiz was brought back up in September.

Maharaj Prem Singh (1915‚Äì2000) was an Indian polo player born in a polo- playing family on 15 November 1915. His grandfather, Maharaj Bhopal Singh was an excellent horseman while his grand uncle Sir Pratap Singh of Idar was a renowned polo player. Maharaj Prem received most of his training from his father, Maharaj Kishen Singh, who himself was an excellent player and had received training from the famous Major-General Delisle. Early life He received early encouragement to play polo from his Principal, A. P. Cox, at Chopasani School and eventually joined his father‚Äôs regiment, the Jodhpur Lancers in 1937. The following year, his team won the prestigious Rajpipla Cup in Mumbai defeating all the cavalry teams including the Poona Horse. This was his first major victory. Thereafter, during the Second World War (1939‚Äì45), he further enhanced his play skills and played tournaments in Peshawar and Risalpur. His handicap during this period was increased to +7 (the highest for any Indian at that time). He reached the apex of his career in 1952-53 in England when he was invited by L. Arthur Lucas to play for his team, the Woolmers Park. The team composed of Arthur Lucas (England), Maharaj Prem, Carlos de la Serna (Argentina) and Francisco Astaburuaga (Chile) won every tournament they played that season (1953) in England, which included the Cowdray Cup, the Senior Cup, the Subsidiary Cup and the Midhurst Cup. Subsequently in France, they won the Silver Cup, the Gold Cup and the Deauville World Cup the same season. Maharaj Prem became the first Indian to be a part of a team to win the World Cup in Polo. His team, the ‚ÄòGolden Falcons‚Äô won all major tournaments in Egypt in 1951-52 when he was invited to play there by His Excellency Vahid Yusri Pasha. In 1955, General Rafael Trujillo invited him to play in Dominican Republic where he spent a year and visited the United States of America for the first time. Thereafter, in 1959-60, he played the North American Championship for ‚ÄòOak brook‚Äô on invitation by Paul Butler. In 1962, he was awarded the Arjuna Award (first for polo) by the Government of India in recognition of his achievements. By the 1970s, Maharaj Prem had started spending considerable amount of time popularising and revitalizing polo in Calcutta, Madras and Mumbai. Several industrial families supported him through his endeavours which included industrialists like Shyam Sunder Jalan in Calcutta, Hansraj Mariwala in Mumbai and A. C. Muthiah in Madras. In the 1980s, he was actively coaching teams which included the Cambridge and Woolmers Park Polo Club teams, the Indian Army team, members of Delhi Polo Club and others. Maharaj Prem apart from being a renowned polo player also won several golf tournaments (Asian Championship in Calcutta in 1960 amongst the many others), shooting championships, tennis championships and cycle-polo tournaments during his lifetime. He also tried breeding and training horses for polo at his farm, after which he often named his polo team ‚ÄòKarnisar‚Äô. He wrote poetry in Urdu and Marwari (some of which can be found displayed at the Mehrangarh Fort, Jodhpur) and spent considerable amount of time developing schemes to bring water to his erstwhile jagir Rajlani to improve living conditions of people in the area. He died after a long spell of illness in January 2000 in Jodhpur.

It is used in the form of its sulfate. Mechanism of action Guanadrel is a postganglionic adrenergic blocking agent. Uptake of guanadrel and storage in sympathetic neurons occurs via the norepinephrine pump; guanadrel slowly displaces norepinephrine from its storage in nerve endings and thereby blocks the release of norepinephrine normally produced by nerve stimulation. The reduction in neurotransmitter release in response to sympathetic nerve stimulation, as a result of catecholamine depletion, leads to reduced arteriolar vasoconstriction, especially the reflex increase in sympathetic tone that occurs with a change in position. Guanadrel is rapidly and well absorbed from gastrointestinal tract.Guanadrel, from Pharmacogenetics Knowledge Base In 1981 the JAMA reported guanadrel as an effective step II or step III treatment of hypertension. Chemistry Guanadrel can be synthesized when cyclohexanone undergoes ketalization by 3-chloro-1,2-propanediol, forming 2-chloromethyl-1,4-dioxyspiro[4,5]decane, which is further reacted with sodium phthalimide.W.R.

Chile recognised Finland's independence on June 17, 1919. Diplomatic relations between them were established in 1931 and have been continuously maintained, despite pressures at times to discontinue them. The two countries maintain resident ambassadors in both capitals.  History  Finland's first non- resident ambassador to Chile was G.A. Gripenberg, resident in Buenos Aires, Argentina, who was appointed ambassador after diplomatic ties were established on February 20, 1931. Until 1991 Finland was represented in Chile through its embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Permanent representation at a subambassadoral level was first established in the early 1970s. Initially Chile was represented in Finland through its embassies in Stockholm, Sweden and Oslo, Norway. Lucio Parada Dagnino was appointed resident ambassador in 1991 and Chile opened an embassy in Helsinki in 1991. Diplomatic relations were maintained throughout World War II despite Finland being allied with the Axis Powers. The 1973 Chilean coup d'√©tat and the Pinochet dictatorship brought pressures in both countries to cut off diplomatic ties. Relations were improved following Chilean transition to democracy. Under Salvador Allende Chile had maintained diplomatic relations with the socialist countries of Eastern Europe, including the German Democratic Republic. After the 1973 Chilean coup these relations were severed. Finland was entrusted with the responsibility of representing the East German interests in Chile.  State visits  Three of the four post-Pinochet Chilean presidents have made state visits to Finland, Patricio Aylwin visited Finland in 1993, Ricardo Lagos in 2002 and Michelle Bachelet in 2007. Finnish presidents have made two state visits to Chile, Martti Ahtisaari visited Chile in 1997 and Tarja Halonen in 2003, also attending the inauguration of president Ricardo Lagos in March, 2000.  Cultural ties  The International Commission of Enquiry into the Crimes of the Military Junta in Chile holding a meeting in Dipoli in Espoo in 1974 The socialist Allende government was an inspiration for left-wing groups in Finland, including the Taistoists. The 1973 coup d'√©tat brought to Finland the first wave of refugees from outside Europe and created a solidarity movement. A Finnish-Chilean friendship society was established in 1973 to support the refugees. Future president Tarja Halonen served as the chairwoman of the society in the 1980s and is its honorary chairman. The International Commission of Enquiry into the Crimes of the Military Junta in Chile held multiple sessions in Finland, including its first session in 1974 in Dipoli, Espoo and its 4th session in 1976 at the Finlandia Hall in Helsinki.  Economic relations  Direct communication links between Finland and Chile were first established around 1850, when Finnish \\"Sitka clippers\\" started serving Russian America and Kamchatka, with regular stops in Valparaiso. Economic ties between Chile and Finland center around copper and forestry. Chile is the world leader in copper production while Finland has been the world leader in copper smelting en extracting technology. Flash smelting was developed in Finland by Outokumpu in the late 1940s and is now the standard process for refining sulfur-containing ores. Outokumpu has provided technology to the Chilean copper industry from the 1960s and owned 50% of a copper mine in Zadivar. Other companies serving the Chilean mining industry include Metso, Tamrock and Larox and Outotec, formerly the technology division of Outokumpu. In the early 2000s, Outokumpu was a prospective partner for National Copper Corporation, Codelco in its $1 billion venture to build a copper smelter and refinery in the port city of Mejillones to handle ore from the Chuquicamata mine. The venture was promoted by president Halonen's state visit in 2003. In May 2009, the Finnish Stora Enso and Chilean Celulosa Arauco y Constituci√≥n announced a ‚Ç¨253 million deal that would make their joint venture the largest landowner in Uruguay. In 1993, Finnish researchers were sent to Chile to collect data on logging operations, which began a continued relationship of Finnish-Chilean cooperation on forestry.Eeronheimo, O. & M√§kinen, Finnish Forest Research Institute, Development of forest harvesting in Chilean Radiata pine plantations. , 1995. In 2003, both countries met several times to discuss business opportunities and \\"the Chilean economy and investment prospects to major Finnish companies\\".Lehtomaki, Paula. Ministry for Foreign Trade and Development of Finland, Finnish-Chilean trade and economic relations , November 5, 2003 = Trade = Embassy of Chile in Helsinki Chile is the second-largest Latin American trade partner for Finland, after Brazil, with its main import being copper ore, followed by fruits and wines. Chilean copper ore is the main source of foreign ore for the Outokumpu (now Boliden) refinery in Harjavalta. Finnish exports to Chile vary considerably from one year to year, because they are closely related to investments made by the mining and forestry industries in Chile.

In modern times, significant presence of Ukrainophobia may be distinguished in three geographical areas, where it differs by its roots and manifestation: *In the Russian Federation, and among the Russophone population of South-Eastern Ukraine (where a large portion of the population is composed of ethnic Russians).James Stuart Olson, Lee Brigance Pappas, Nicholas Charles Pappas, An Ethnohistorical Dictionary of the Russian and Soviet Empires, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1994. . Its opposite is Ukrainophilia. *In Poland *In Canada, where a significant Ukrainian diaspora is present. Historically, Ukrainian culture was oppressed in states which included the Ukrainian population: Russian Empire, Soviet Union and historical Polish states. Modern scholars define two types of anti-Ukrainian sentiment. One is based on discrimination of Ukrainians based on their ethnic or cultural origin, a typical kind of xenophobia and racism. Another one is based on the conceptual rejection of Ukrainians, Ukrainian culture, and language as artificial and unnatural; at the turn of the 20th century, several authors supported an assertion that Ukrainian identity and language had been created artificially in order to undermine Russia. This argument has been promulgated by several conservative Russian authors. Ukrainophobic stereotypes Ukrainophobic stereotypes range from mockery to ascribing negative traits to the whole Ukrainian nation. *Ukrainians eat mostly salo *Ukrainians are greedy *Ukrainians are sly and cunning *Ukrainians are traitors *Ukrainians are antisemites *Ukrainian language is in fact a funny broken dialect of Russian Russian Empire The rise and spread of Ukrainian self-awareness around the time of the Revolutions of 1848 produced an anti-Ukrainian sentiment within some layers of society within the Russian empire. In order to retard and control this movement, the use of Ukrainian language within the Russian empire was initially restricted by official government decrees such as the Valuev Circular (July 18, 1863) and later banned by the Ems ukaz (May 18, 1876) from any use in print (with the exception of reprinting of old documents). Popularly the anti-Ukrainian sentiment was promulgated by such organizations as the \\"Black Hundreds\\", which were vehemently opposed to Ukrainian self- determination. Some restrictions on the use of Ukrainian language were relaxed in 1905‚Äì1907. They ceased to be policed after the February Revolution in 1917. Russian gendarmes in 1914 at the Taras Shevchenko burial.Beside the Ems ukaz and Valuev Circular, there were a multiple number of other anti-Ukrainian edicts starting from the 17th century, when Russia was governed by the House of Romanov. In 1720 Peter the Great issued an edict prohibiting printing books in the Ukrainian language, and since 1729 all edicts and instructions have only been in the Russian language. In 1763 Catherine the Great issued an edict prohibiting lectures in the Ukrainian language at the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. In 1769 the Most Holy Synod prohibited printing and using the Ukrainian alphabet book. In 1775 the Zaporizhian Sich was destroyed. In 1832 all studying at schools of the Right-bank Ukraine transitioned to exclusively Russian language. In 1847 the Russian government persecuted all members of the Brotherhood of Saints Cyril and Methodius and prohibited the works of Taras Shevchenko, Panteleimon Kulish, Nikolay Kostomarov (Mykola Kostomarov) and others. In 1862 all free Sunday schools for adults in Ukraine were closed. In 1863 the Russian Minister of Interior Valuev decided that the Little Russian language (Ukrainian language) had never existed and could not ever exist. During that time in the winter of 1863‚Äì64, the January Uprising took place at the western regions of the Russian Empire, uniting peoples of the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Next year in 1864 the \\"Regulation about elementary school\\" claimed that all teaching should be conducted in the Russian language. In 1879 the Russian Minister of Education Dmitry Tolstoy (later the Russian Minister of Interior) officially and openly stated that all people of the Russian Empire should be Russified. In the 1880s several edicts were issued prohibiting education in the Ukrainian language at private schools, theatric performances in Ukrainian, any use of Ukrainian in official institutions, and christening Ukrainian names. In 1892 another edict prohibited translation from the Russian to Ukrainian. In 1895 the Main Administration of Publishing prohibited printing children books in Ukrainian. In 1911 the resolution adopted at the 7th Congress of Noblemen in Moscow prohibited the use of any languages other than Russian. In 1914 the Russian government officially prohibited celebrations of the 100th Anniversary of Shevchenko's birthday and posted gendarmes at the Chernecha Hill. The same year Nicholas II of Russia issued an edict prohibiting the Ukrainian press. Soviet Union Under Soviet rule in Ukraine, a policy of korenization was adopted after defeat of the Ukrainian People's Republic and initially supported Ukrainian cultural self-awareness. This policy was phased out in 1928 and terminated entirely in 1932 in favor of general Russification. In 1929 Mykola Kulish wrote a theatrical play \\"Myna Mazailo\\" where the author cleverly displays the cultural situation in Ukraine. There was supposedly no anti-Ukrainian sentiment within the Soviet government, which began to repress all aspects of Ukrainian culture and language contrary to the ideology of Proletarian Internationalism. In 1930 the Union for the Freedom of Ukraine process took place in Kharkiv, after which a number of former Ukrainian politicians and their relatives were deported to Central Asia. The ethnic cleansing against the Ukrainian intelligentsia was never evaluated and is poorly documented. During the Soviet era, the population of Ukraine was reduced by the artificial famine called Holodomor in 1932‚Äì33 along with the population of other nearby agrarian areas of the USSR. Many prominent Ukrainians were labelled as nationalists or anti-revolutionaries, and many were repressed and executed as enemies of the people.Basil Dmytryshyn, Moscow and the Ukraine, 1918‚Äì1953: A Study of Russian Bolshevik Nationality Policy, Bookman Associates, 1956 In January 1944 during a session of Politbureau of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), Stalin personally gave a speech \\"About anti-Lenin mistakes and nationalistic perversions in a film-tale of Alexander Dovzhenko \\"Ukraine in flames\\".Shapoval, Yu. –ì—ñ—Ç–ª–µ—Ä, –°—Ç–∞–ª—ñ–Ω —ñ –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∞: –±–µ–∑–∂–∞–ª—å–Ω—ñ —Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ç–µ–≥—ñ—ó (Hitler, Stalin and Ukraine: merciless strategies).

The article also denies the existence of the Ukrainian culture. Mykola Levchenko, a Ukrainian parliamentarian from Party of Regions, and the deputy of Donetsk City Council states that there should be only one language, Russian. He says that the Ukrainian language is impractical and should be avoided. Levchenko called Ukrainian the language of folklore and anecdotes. However, he says he will speak the literary Ukrainian language on principle, once Russian is adopted as the sole state language. Anna German, the spokesperson of the same party, highly criticized those statements. Mykhailo Bakharev, the vice-speaker of the Crimean Autonomous Republic parliament (and the main editor of Krymskaya Pravda), openly says that there is no Ukrainian language and that it is the language of the non-educated part of population. He claims that it was invented by Taras Shevchenko and others. He also believes that there is no Ukraine nation, there is no future for the Ukrainian State, and that Ukrainization needs to be stopped.

A host of civic and student organizations from all over the country (including Kherson in southern Ukraine and Donetsk in eastern Ukraine), authors and former Soviet dissidents also signed petitions calling for his removal. Tabachnik also had stated that Ukrainian history textbooks contained \\"simply false\\" information and announced his intention to rewrite them. =Shevchenkophobia= Ivan Dziuba in his lecture \\"Shevchenkophobia in Modern Ukraine\\" (\\"–®–µ–≤—á–µ–Ω–∫–æ—Ñ–æ–±—ñ—è –≤ —Å—É—á–∞—Å–Ω—ñ–π –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—ñ\\"–î–∑—é–±–∞ –Ü–≤–∞–Ω, \\"–®–µ–≤—á–µ–Ω–∫–æ—Ñ–æ–±—ñ—è –≤ —Å—É—á–∞—Å–Ω—ñ–π –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—ñ\\", 2006) traced the origins of the anti-Shevchenko sentiment and stated that the fight with Shevchenko is in fact the fight with Ukraine.

Canada Anti-Ukrainian discrimination was present in Canada from the arrival of Ukrainians in Canada around 1891 until the late 20th Century. In one sense this was part of a larger trend towards nativism in Canada during the period. But Ukrainians were singled out for special discrimination because of their large numbers, visibility (due to dress and language), and political activism. During the First World War, around 8,000 Ukrainian Canadian were interned by the Canadian government as \\"enemy aliens\\" (because they came from the Austrian Empire). In the interwar period all Ukrainian cultural and political groups, no matter what their ideology was, were monitored by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and many of their leaders were deported.Hewitt, Steve. \\"Policing the Promised Land: The RCMP and Negative Nation-building in Alberta and Saskatchewan in the Interwar Period\\", The Prairie West as Promised Land ed. R. Douglas Francis and Chris Kitzan (Calgary: University of Calgary Press, 2007), 318-320. This attitude began to slowly change after the Second World War, as Canadian immigration and cultural policies generally moved from being explicitly nativist to a more pluralistic one. Ukrainian nationalists were now seen as victims of communism, rather than dangerous subversives. Ukrainians began to hold high offices, and one, Senator Paul Yuzyk was one of the earliest proponents of a policy of \\"multiculturalism\\" which would end official discrimination and acknowledge the contribution of non-English, non-French Canadians. The Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism of the 1960s, which had originally been formed only to deal with French-Canadian grievances, began the transition to multiculturalism in Canada because of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's desire to court Ukrainian votes in Western Canada. The commission also included a Ukrainian commissioner, Jaroslav Rudnyckyj. Since the adoption of official multiculturalism under Section Twenty-seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in 1982, Ukrainians in Canada have had legal protection against discrimination. Slang references to Ukrainians and Ukrainian culture \\"Khokhly\\" by Igor Serdyukov.

Commonly known by various names like tree lungwort, lung lichen, lung moss, lungwort lichen, oak lungs or oak lungwort, it is sensitive to air pollution and is also harmed by habitat loss and changes in forestry practices. Its population has declined across Europe and L. pulmonaria is considered endangered in many lowland areas. The species has a history of use in herbal medicines, and recent research has corroborated some medicinal properties of lichen extracts.  Description  Soredia and isidia may be seen on the ridges and margins in full magnification. It is a foliose lichen and its leaf-like thallus is green, leathery and lobed with a pattern of ridges and depressions on the upper surface. Bright green under moist conditions, it becomes brownish and papery when dry. This species often has a fine layers of hairs, a tomentum, on its lower surface. The cortex, the outer protective layer on the thallus surface, is roughly comparable to the epidermis of a green plant. The thallus is typically in diameter, with individual lobes wide and up to 7 cm long. The asexual reproductive structures soredia and isidia are present on the thallus surface. Minute (0.5‚Äì1.5 mm in diameter) cephalodia‚Äîpockets of cyanobacteria‚Äîare often present on the lower surface of the thallus; these spots are conspicuously darker than the green surface of the thallus. Like other foliose lichens, the thallus is only loosely attached to the surface on which it grows. = Photobionts = The thallus contains internal structures known as cephalodia, characteristic of three-membered lichen symbioses involving two photobionts (the photosynthetic symbionts in the fungal-algal lichen relationship). These internal cephalodia, found between the \\"ribs\\" of the thallus surface, arise when blue-green algae (from the genus Nostoc) on the thallus surface are enveloped during mycobiont growth. Structurally, cephalodia consist of dense aggregates of Nostoc cells surrounded by thin-walled hyphae‚Äîthis delimits them from the rest of the thallus which contains a loose structure of thick-walled hyphae. Blue-green cyanobacteria can fix atmospheric nitrogen, providing a nutrient for the lichen. The other photobiont of L. pulmonaria is the green alga Dictyochloropsis reticulata.  Reproduction  L. pulmonaria has the ability to form both vegetative propagation and sexual propagules at an age of about 25 years.Scheidegger C, Walser JC. (1998). \\"Reintroduction and augmentation of populations of the endangered Lobaria pulmonaria: methods and concepts\\". In: Lobarion Lichens as Indicators of the Primeval Forests of the Eastern Carpathians (eds Kondratyuk S, Coppins B), pp. 33‚Äì52. Ukrainian Phytosociological Centre, Kiev. In sexual reproduction, the species produces small reddish-brown discs known as apothecia containing asci, from which spores are forcibly released into the air (like ballistospores). Based on studies of ascospore germination, it has been suggested that L. pulmonaria spores use some mechanism to inhibit germination‚Äîthe inhibition is lifted when the spores are grown in a synthetic growth medium containing an adsorbent like bovine serum albumin or Œ±-cyclodextrin. Dispersal by vegetative propagules (via soredia or isidia) has been determined as the predominant mode of reproduction in L. pulmonaria. In this method, the protruding propagules become dry and brittle during the regular wet/dry cycles of the lichen, and can easily crumble off the thallus. These fragments may develop into new thalli, either at the same locale or at a new site after dispersal by wind or rain. A number of steps are required for the development of the vegetative propagules, including the degeneration of the thallus cortex, replication of green algal cells, and entanglement of fungal hyphae with the green algal cells. This steps lead to an increase in internal pressure which eventually breaks through the cortex. Continued growth leads to these granules being pushed upwards and out of the thallus surface.  Distribution and habitat  In Schw√§bisch-Fr√§nkische Waldberge, Germany It has a wide distribution in Europe, Asia, North America and Africa, preferring damp habitats with high rainfall, especially coastal areas. It is the most widely distributed and most common Lobaria species in North America. Associated with old-growth forests, its presence and abundance may be used as an indicator of forest age, at least in the Interior Cedar-Hemlock biogeoclimatic zone in eastern British Columbia. It is also found in pasture-woodlands. It usually grows on the bark of broad- leaved trees such as oak, beech and maple but will also grow on rocks. In the laboratory, L. pulmonaria has been grown on nylon microfilaments. Various environmental factors are thought to affect the distribution of L. pulmonaria, such as temperature, moisture (average humidity, rapidity and frequency of wet-dry cycles), sunlight exposure, and levels of air pollution. Attempts to quantitatively evaluate the contribution of these factors to lichen growth is difficult because differences in the original environment from which the lichen thalli are collected will greatly affect heat and desiccation tolerances. Due to declining population, L. pulmonaria is considered to be rare or threatened in many parts of the world, especially in lowland areas of Europe.Scheidegger C, Clerc P, Dietrich M, Frei M, Groner U, Keller C, Roth I, Stofer S, Vust M. (2002). \\"Rote Liste der gef√§hrdeten Arten der Schweiz: Baum- und erdbewohnende Flechten\\". - Bern, Bundesamt f√ºr Umwelt, Wald und Landschaft BUWAL; Birmensdorf, Eidgen√∂ssische Forschungsanstalt WSL; Conservatoire et Jardin botaniques de la Ville de Gen√®ve CJBG. 124 S. The decline has been attributed to industrial forestry and air pollution, particularly acid rain. L. pulmonaria, like other lichens containing a blue-green algal component, are particularly susceptible to the effects of acid rain, because the subsequent decrease in pH reduces nitrogen fixation through inhibition of the algal nitrogenase enzyme.  Chemical compounds  L. pulmonaria is known to contain a variety of acids common to lichens, such as stictic acid, desmethyl stictic acid, gyrophoric acid, tenuiorin, constictic acid, norstictic acid, peristictic acid, and methylnorstictic acid. These compounds, collectively known as depsidones, are known to be involved in defense against grazing herbivores like lichen-feeding molluscs. It also contains the sugar alcohols D-arabitol, volemitol, in addition to several carotenoids (total content > 10 mg/kg), such as alpha carotene, beta carotene, and beta cryptoxanthin. The upper cortex of the lichen contains melanins that screen UV and PAR radiation from the photobiont. The synthesis of melanin pigments in the lichen increases in response to greater solar irradiation, and shade-adapted thalli are greenish-grey in the air-dry state, while sun-exposed thalli can be dark brown in color. This adaptation helps protect the photosymbiont D. reticulata, known to be relatively intolerant to high light levels. Also known to be present are various steroids, namely ergosterol, episterol, fecosterol, and lichesterol.  Uses  = Medicinal = Its shape somewhat resembles the tissue inside lungs and therefore it is thought to be a remedy for lung diseases based on the doctrine of signatures. The lichen's common English names are derived from this association. Gerard's book The Herball or General Historie of plants (1597) recommends L. pulmonaria as medicinally valuable. It is still used for asthma, urinary incontinence and lack of appetite. In India it is used as a traditional medicine to treat hemorrhages and eczema, and it is used as a remedy for coughing up blood by the Hesquiaht in British Columbia, Canada. An ethnophytotherapeutical survey of the high Molise region in central-southern Italy revealed that L. pulmonaria is used as an antiseptic, and is rubbed on wounds. A hot-water extract prepared using this species has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and ulcer-preventing activities. Also, methanol extracts were shown to have a protective effect on the gastrointestinal system of rats, possibly by reducing oxidative stress and reducing the inflammatory effects of neutrophils. Furthermore, methanol extracts also have potent antioxidative activity and reducing power, probably due to the presence of phenolic compounds. = Other uses = L. pulmonaria has also been used to produce an orange dye for wool, in the tanning of leather, in the manufacture of perfumes and as an ingredient in brewing.

The demolition has focused on mosques, burial sites, homes and historical locations associated with the Islamic prophet Muhammad, his companions, and many of the founding personalities of early Islamic history by the Saudi government. In Saudi Arabia, many of the demolitions have officially been part of the continued expansion of the Masjid al-Haram at Mecca and the Prophet's Mosque in Medina and their auxiliary service facilities in order to accommodate the ever- increasing number of Muslims performing the pilgrimage (hajj). History Much of the Arabian Peninsula was politically unified by 1932 in the third and current Saudi State, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The military campaign led by King Abdulaziz ibn Saud and his Bedouin army of tribesmen conquered the Hejaz and ousted the ruling Hashemite clan. The new Najdi rulers, nomadic Arabs largely found themselves at the reins of a highly sophisticated society. A cohesive political structure based on the Majlis al-Shura (consultative council) system had been in place for centuries. A central administrative body managed an annual budget which allocated expenditure on secondary schools, military and police forces. Similarly, the religious fabric of the Najd and the Hejaz were vastly different. Traditional Hejazi cultural customs and rituals were almost entirely religious in nature. Celebrations honouring Muhammad, his family and companions, reverence of deceased saints, visitation of shrines, tombs and holy sites connected with any of these were among the customs indigenous to Hejazi Islam. As administrative authority of the Hejaz passed into the hands of Najdi Wahabi Muslims from the interior, the Wahabi Ulama viewed local religious practices as unfounded superstition superseding codified religious sanction that was considered a total corruption of religion and the spreading of heresy. What followed was a removal of the physical infrastructure, tombs, mausoleums, mosques and sites associated with the family and companions of Muhammad. = 19th century = In 1801 and 1802, the Saudis under Abdul Aziz ibn Muhammad ibn Saud attacked and captured the Shia holy cities of Karbala and Najaf in today's Iraq, massacred parts of the Shia Muslim population and destroyed the tomb of Husayn ibn Ali, the grandson of Muhammad and son of Ali, Muhammad's son-in-law. In 1803 and 1804, the Saudis captured Mecca and Medina and destroyed historical monuments and various holy Muslim sites and shrines, such as the shrine built over the tomb of Fatimah, the daughter of Muhammad, and even intended to destroy the grave of Muhammad himself as idolatrous, causing outrage throughout the Muslim world.The Destruction of Holy Sites in Mecca and Medina By Irfan Ahmed in Islamic Magazine, Issue 1, July 2006Nibras Kazimi, A Paladin Gears Up for War, The New York Sun, November 1, 2007John R Bradley, Saudi's Shi'ites walk tightrope, Asia Times, March 17, 2005 In Mecca, the tombs of direct relations of Muhammad located at Jannatul Mualla cemetery, including that of his first wife Khadijah bint Khuwaylid, were demolished. The initial dismantling of the sites began in 1806 when the Wahhabi army of the First Saudi State occupied Medina and systematically levelled many of the structures at the Jannat al-Baqi cemetery. This is the vast burial site adjacent the Prophet's Mosque (Al-Masjid al- Nabawi) housing the remains of many of the members of Muhammad's family, close companions and central figures of early Islam. The Ottoman Turks, practitioners themselves of more tolerant and at times mystical strains of Islam, had erected elaborate mausoleums over the graves of Al-Baqi. These were levelled in their entirety. Mosques across the city were also targeted and an attempt was made to demolish Muhammad's tomb. Widespread vocal criticism of this last action by Muslim communities as far away as India, eventually led to abandoning any attempt on this site. Political claims made against Turkish control of the region initiated the Ottoman‚ÄìSaudi war (1811‚Äì1818) in which the Saudi defeat forced Wahhabi tribesmen to retreat from the Hejaz back into the interior. Turkish forces reasserted control of the region and subsequently began extensive rebuilding of sacred sites between 1848 and 1860, many of them done employing the finest examples of Ottoman design and craftsmanship.Irfan Ahmed, The Destruction of Holy Sites in Mecca and Medina, page 1 , Islamica Magazine, Issue 15.page 71. Accessed online October 29, 2010. = 20th century = On 21 April 1925 the mausoleums and domes at Al-Baqi in Medina were once again levelled and so were indicators of the exact location of the resting places of Muhammad's family members and descendants, as it remains to the present day. Portions of the famed Qasida al-Burda, the 13th century ode written in praise of Muhammad by Imam al-Busiri, inscribed over Muhammad's tomb were painted over. Among specific sites targeted at this time were the graves of the Martyrs of the Battle of Uhud, including the grave of the renowned Hamza ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib, uncle of Muhammad and one of his most beloved supporters, the Mosque of Fatimah Al Zahraa‚Äô, daughter of Mohammad, the Mosque of the Two Lighthouses (Manaratayn) as well as the Qubbat Al- Thanaya, the cupola built as the burial place of Mohammad's incisor tooth, which was broken from a blow received during the Battle of Uhud. In Medina, the Mashrubat Umm Ibrahim, the home of Mohammad's Egyptian wife Mariah and birthplace of their son Ibrahim, as well as the adjacent burial site of Hamida al-Barbariyya, mother of Musa al-Kadhim, were destroyed during this time. The site was paved over and is today part of the massive marble esplanade beside the Mosque. The government-appointed permanent scholarly committee of Saudi Arabia has ordered the demolition of such structures in a series of Islamic rulings noting excessive veneration leading to shirk. = 21st century = The twenty-first century has seen an increase in the demolition of sites in Mecca and Medina by Saudi authorities, alongside expansion of luxury development. As the annual hajj continues to draw larger crowds year after year, the Saudi authorities deemed it necessary to raze large tracts of formerly residential areas around the two important mosques to make way for pilgrimage-related infrastructure. In 2010, it was forecast that developers were going to spend an estimated $13 billion on the largest expansion project in the city's history. While there is widespread agreement for the need of facilities that can accommodate greater numbers of pilgrims, the development of upscale hotels and condominium towers, restaurants, shopping centres and spas has caused some to criticize the over-commercialization of a site which many consider to be a divinely ordained sanctuary for Muslims. The rapid influx of capitalist investment in Mecca and Medina leads many to believe that money and economic growth are the ultimate reason for Saudi authorities. Critics argue that this monetary focus works with Wahhabi state policy that imposes a massive cultural and social deletion within the Holy Cities, erasing any elements that encourage practices counter to the Wahhabi creed. According to The Independent, the House of Mawalid where Muhammad is said to have been born is about to be replaced by a huge royal palace, as a part of a multibillion-pound construction project in Mecca which has resulted in the destruction of hundreds of historic monuments.

He was employed as an entomologist in the Department of Malaria Research, Bengal. The mermithid parasite Romanomermis iyengari and the mosquito species Culex iyengari are named after him.  Life and work  Iyengar was born in a prominent Madras family, his father M.O. Alasingrachariar was a senior judge in the Madras High Court, and an older brother was the botanist M.O.P. Iyengar. After studying at the Hindu High School and graduating from the Presidency College, Madras he joined as an entomologist in-charge in the Bengal Malaria Research laboratory in Calcutta from 1918. He also taught medical parasitology and entomology for public health students. He served as a professor of medical entomology at the School of Tropical Medicine in Calcutta between 1922 and 1923. He also maintained an interest in botany, especially in association with aquatic habitats where he was studying mosquitoes, and described the floral biology of Monochoria and published with his brother on Characium (algae) associated with the larvae of Anopheles in 1932. He worked under the aegis of the Rockefeller Foundation for the Travancore State between 1931 and 1934 studying filariasis on which he served as a consultant for the World Health Organization working in many parts of the world including Afghanistan, the Maldives, New Guinea, Samoa, and Thailand. He collaborated with other malariologists around the world including P.A. Buxton, Wilhelm Sch√ºffner, Henri Galliard, N.H. Swellengrebel and P.G. Shute. He surveyed natural control measures of mosquito larvae and identified fungi in the Coelomomyces group and a mermithid with potential for use in control. A mermithid, named after him as Romanomermis iyengari has found continued use in the management of anophelines around the world. Other findings of his included the observation that microfilaria that had been injested with blood by mosquitoes, entered the haemocoel not from the stomach wall as had been earlier thought but through the wall of the proventriculus. Iyengar also published a couple of notes in entomology that were not in his professional line of work. These include notes on adult coprid beetles emerging from human intestines with faeces. The Dr M.O.T. Iyengar Memorial Award was instituted in 1983 by his wife Mrs Rukmani Iyengar.

Wells. Plot summary In January (about 1900, presumably), the people of Earth awaken to the news that a strange luminous object has erupted, into the Solar System, after disturbing the normal orbit of the planet Neptune. The object is a celestial body whose luminosity is distinguishable on the sky about the constellation of Leo. Although initially it is only of interest to astronomers, eventually the world media announces that it is a whole star, heading in a collision course toward the center of our star system. The star has already consumed Neptune. Many people are concerned by this, but on the whole it amounts to little more than a temporary fad. The rogue star continues on its path, now affecting the planet Jupiter and all its moons. At this point, the studies of a mathematician are published throughout the world. He explains that the intruding star and our Sun are exerting reciprocal gravitational attraction, and as a result it is being pulled deeper into the Solar System. Based on its orientation, it is determined that the star will either hit Earth or pass by at close proximity, which would lead to apocalyptic ecological consequences. As the luminosity disrupts nights on Earth, many people begin to worry, but cynics cite the year 1000, in which humanity also anticipated the world's end. The English winter softens progressively into a thaw, as the intruding star grows fast in the sky. Its high speed is evident during the worst hours of the event. On that day, in the sky above England the apparent size of the star was equivalent to a third of the size of the Moon. Upon reaching the skies of the United States, the apparent size has already increased to the size of the Moon. Soon all of the ice on Earth's surface begins to melt, causing widespread flooding. The star then begins to overshadow the Sun, whose hours seem darker. The planetary crust is affected too, with massive cracks forming and releasing lava on to the surface of the Earth. Tidal waves hit, particularly in the Pacific area, leading to devastation across the world. Most of the human population perishes, and its works are rendered unusable: cities, farms, etc. The few survivors witness the Moon interposing before the traveling star, creating a weak eclipse, as it is permanently removed from its steady orbit about the Earth into a new, more distant orbit. The star then resumes its path and finally meets the Sun. Earth manages to survive despite the massive havoc wreaked upon its surface. Extensive areas of Greenland and other northern islands have thawed and are now green and pleasant for habitation. Humans settle in new areas close to the poles, where the climate is more temperate. Meanwhile, Martian astronomers have witnessed the event, concluding that not much has changed on the distant planet apart from the melting of ice at the poles. Influence An astronomer named Ogilvy appears at the start of the story. An astronomer named Ogilvy also appears at the start of Wells's novel The War of the Worlds. The early part of the story, before the dire danger had become obvious, includes a reference to a South African city where \\"a great man had married, and the streets were alight to welcome his return with his bride. 'Even the skies have illuminated,' said the flatterer\\". This is considered to be a snide reference to Cecil Rhodes, at the height of his power and influence at the time of writing. The master mathematician's defiance of the Star: \\"He looked at it as one might look into the eyes of a brave enemy. 'You may kill me,' he said after a silence. 'But I can hold you - and all the universe for that matter - in the grip of this small brain. I would not change. Even now\\" is a clear statement of 19th century scientific rationalism, the world-view which Wells strongly shared. This story is often credited with having created a science fiction subgenre depicting the impact event of a planet or star colliding, or near-colliding with Earth‚Äîsuch as the 1933 novel When Worlds Collide by Philip Wylie and Edwin Balmer (made into a film in 1951), Fritz Leiber's The Wanderer (1965), and Lucifer's Hammer by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle (1977). However, it was preceded by two stories in 1894: Omega: The Last Days of the World by Camille Flammarion (the astronomer of the Flammarion Catalog) and Olga Romanoff or, The Syren of the Skies by George Griffith. In 1895, Griffith used an comet disaster again in The Outlaws of the Air. The story is mentioned in Arthur C. Clarke's novel Rendezvous with Rama, and Clarke also used the title for a story of his own. The radio anthology series Radio Tales adapted the story into an episode called \\"Asteroid\\". The graphic novel Bloodstar uses Wells's story as the prelude to the post-apocalyptic situation in which the plot - itself derived from a short story by Robert E. Howard - is set.

Following an investigation, the building was condemned. As a temporary measure, the high school students shared the middle school for the next several months. High school students attended on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, while middle school students attended Tuesday, Thursday and every other Saturday. As this was going on, a system of modular buildings were set up in the high school parking lot. From 1 February, the high school students began attending class in the modular buildings. The new Louisa County High School opened in August 2015 in time for the start of the 2015 school year. Curriculum The high school offers courses in a wide variety of departments, including alternative education, career & technical education, English, fine arts, foreign language, guidance, mathematics, physical education, science, social studies and special education. The school also offers several Advanced Placement Program (AP) classes and dual-enrollment courses with both J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College and Piedmont Virginia Community College. Extracurricular activities Student groups and activities at Louisa County High School include anime club, band, Ex Libris, FBLA, FCCLA, FFA,SCA, fishing club, foreign language club, gospel choir, guitar club, HOSA, Impact club, Interact, juggling club, National Art Honor Society, National Honor Society, newspaper, Odyssey of the Mind, Renaissance club, Scholastic Bowl, SkillsUSA, SCUBA Club, Student Organization for Developing Attitudes, Thespians, Tri-M, TSA, Varsity Club and yearbook. =Athletics= Louisa County High School is a member of the Virginia High School League and belongs to the Jefferson District in AA Region II.

Plot summary Ever since Wallace Wallace was young, he has insisted on telling the truth. Since scoring the winning touchdown for the Bedford Middle School football team in the championship, Wallace Wallace has been very popular, to the dismay of his ex-best friend, Steve Cavanaugh (two running gags in the book are Cavanaugh calling Wallace by a double insult, e.g. Dummy Dummy, and Wallace thinking of Cavanaugh by last name only). When Wallace is assigned to write a report on the book Old Shep, My Pal, he won't lie about his feelings. He dislikes the book and writes a negative review, which results in a detention handed down by his Old Shep, My Pal-obsessed English teacher, Mr. Fogelman, and booted from the school football team until he writes a quality review. His detention is spent with the drama club. The drama club is led by Mr. Fogelman, and they are working on a production of a dramatic adaptation of Old Shep, My Pal written by Mr. Fogelman. Wallace is initially bored, much to the irritation of Mr. Fogelman and Rachel Turner, the president of the drama club. Trudi Davis, Rachel's best friend, is in love with Wallace, to Rachel's dismay. During Wallace's detention, he decides to make edits to the script. Mr. Fogelman is annoyed at Wallace because he thinks the drama club should stick to exactly how the book is. The drama club likes the changes that Wallace is making, and later Wallace joins the club. Soon after Wallace joins the club, an unknown person vandalizes the play set and rehearsals. Rachel believes Wallace is the culprit. Everyone else, Trudi in particular, initially regards him as a hero and refuses to believe her, but when one of Wallace's scrimmage jerseys appears during the final sabotage attempt, they turn against him. Rachel changes her mind to believe that Wallace isn't the vandal. Wallace is eventually banned from the play entirely. Despite his ban, the drama club decides to use Wallace's ideas for the play, including having Shep live at the end. This decision results in disaster when the saboteur blows up the stuffed prop Shep with a cherry bomb during the performance‚Äîjust as the actors praise his miraculous recovery. Meanwhile, Wallace figures out that the culprit is Rachel's younger brother Dylan, who wanted revenge because he felt the play had ruined the famous Wallace. Consequently, Wallace tells his first lie to spare Rachel's feelings. He tells her that it was him vandalizing the play. After her initial anger at Wallace, she realizes on her own that Dylan was behind the attacks. Wallace and Rachel recognize their mutual attraction, and plan to go on a date together. As for Trudi, she ends up falling in love with Cavanaugh. Furthermore, Cavanaugh and Wallace do not make up and are still enemies. Just not archenemies. The joke is on Cavanaugh because Wallace tackled Shep with a pillow to block the explosion, mimicking his previous winning touchdown. Reception In a review for Book Report, Jo Clarke said that \\"this was one of the funniest books I have ever read!\\" and that \\"Middle school kids will enjoy this book because it is so typical of their language, actions, and ideas.\\" However, the Journal of Adolescent & Adult Literacy review said that \\"the book is filled with jokes aimed at an adult audience rather than one middle schoolers. These are jokes that desperately wish to be funny but the book produces only one that would be considered genuinely amusing to its demographic\\" and that \\"No More Dead Dogs had serious potential to be a much better book than the writing produced.\\" References External links 2002 Canadian novels Novels by Gordon Korman Canadian children's novels 2002 children's books ","title":"No More Dead Dogs"},{"id":"20686621","text":"The is a Nanboku-ch≈ç period collection of Japanese poetry compiled by Munenaga Shinn≈ç ca. 1381.

It was an outpost of the colony of New Netherland, which was centered on its capital, New Amsterdam (Manhattan), on the North River (Hudson River). Location The exact location of the fort is uncertain. A 1655 Swedish map shows it on the west bank of the Schuylkill River, on Providence Island (now part of the mainland), just south of Minquas (also known as Eagle's Nest or Mingo) Creek.Detail of 1655 map Scharf & Westcott put it on the east bank of the Schuylkill River, opposite Minquas Creek.J. Thomas Scharf & Thompson Westcott, History of Philadelphia, 1609-1884 (Philadelphia: L.H. Everts & Co., 1884), vol. 2, p. 1022. A 1770s map of Philadelphia's naval defenses shows a fort on the island, but it is unidentified. Directly adjacent to (or opposite) the fort was the terminus of the Great Minquas Path, an 80-mile (130 km) trail from the Susquehanna River to the Schuylkill River. This was the primary trade route for furs from the Susquehannock people, and the Dutch named the trail \\"Beversreede\\" or \\"Beaver Road.\\"The Great Trail Pennsylvania historical marker. Swedes Though never recognized by the Dutch, the Delaware Valley region was effectively under control of the Swedish colony of New Sweden, which was first settled in 1638 at Fort Christina (now Wilmington, Delaware). Though the Swedes' colony included Dutch residents, the only official Dutch presence in the area was across the Delaware River at Fort Nassau, at the mouth of Big Timber Creek (south of today's Gloucester City, New Jersey). In 1642, members of the Connecticut Colony attempted to settle in the area, but their homes were burned and the nascent colony was repelled. The Swedes had a competing claim for land at the mouth of the Schuylkill River, and they often vandalized Fort Beversreede. In 1648, they built a stockaded 30-by-20-foot blockhouse directly in front of it, called Fort Nya Korsholm. The Swedish building was said to be only twelve feet from the gate of the Dutch fort. It was meant to intimidate the Dutch residents and intercept trade. In 1651, the Dutch abandoned Fort Beversreede and dismantled and relocated Fort Nassau to the Christina River, downstream from the Swedes' Fort Christina. The Dutch consolidated their forces at the rebuilt fort, renamed Fort Casimir. It was not until 1655 that control of the area was regained by the Dutch in a military expedition led by Director-General of New Netherland Petrus Stuyvesant, establishing a regional capital at New Amstel.Where Pennsylvania History Began (by Henry D. Paxon, The Swedish Colonial Society, 1926) Site There is no remnant of either Fort Beversreede or Fort Nya Korsholm. Nearby Mud Island became the site of Fort Mifflin in 1771. Widening of the Schuylkill's channel, subsequent land reclamation, as well as other transportation and industrial infrastructure have dramatically changed the area. But the site of the forts (whether on the east or west bank of the Schuylkill) is probably south of the mouth of Mingo Creek and north of the George C. Platt Bridge.

History =Inception (1996-1998)= The history of Freeworld begins with Kevin Czinger's purchase of Zoo Entertainment from BMG in 1996 with the support of financial backers Allen & Co. Though Zoo was initially run in conjunction with Czinger's own label Volcano Entertainment, it was eventually absorbed into it. In the fall of 1997, Czinger merged the label with Dallas Austin's Rowdy Records to create Freeworld Entertainment. As a combination of the two producers' respective labels, Freeworld consisted of artists from both previous labels' catalogs. The label benefited from Austin's industry connections and Czinger's keen insight into the business. Unfortunately, the label was wrought with bad luck from its inception. In September 1997, a month after Austin and Czinger worked together, former Volcano flagship artist Tool attempted to dissolve ties to the label by claiming that Freeworld had failed to exercise its option to renew the band's contract. To make matters worse, Austin removed himself from the label after Freeworld made considerable investments in his artists. Czinger attempted to recall his previous success by changing the name of the label back to Zoo Entertainment, however, the damage was already too severe. In the spring of 1998 after putting more than $20 million info Freeworld, Allen & Co. sold the label to Clive Calder's Zomba Label Group. Zomba eventually brought back the Volcano Entertainment moniker. It wasn't until December 1998 that the lawsuit with Tool was resolved, however, by then the Freeworld name had been dissipated. =Reactivation (1999-2002)= In early 1999, Capitol entered into a relationship with Austin to restart the Freeworld Entertainment label. Some of the first artists on the newly formed label were Detroit vocal quartet Vega and preteen R&B; vocalist Sammie. The new version of Freeworld lasted sometime into the early 2000s, however, it eventually dissolved as well. Austin would go on to reform his own Rowdy Records in 2005 under the Universal Music Group.

Implementations exist for different operating systems, including Linux and Microsoft Windows. Through the ETSI, CAPI 2.0 was introduced as standard ETS 300 324 (Profile B). Primarily, CAPI was designed for data transfer over ISDN. The specification has been extended multiple times, thereby it became important to the area of voice and fax communication. Because pure data transfer over IP-based networks is dominant in modern times, CAPI is being used primarily in the scope of voice applications (voice mail, IVR, call center, voice conference systems, etc.), for fax servers and combined systems (UMS). The CAPI Interface in its current release (CAPI 2.0) supports a variety of signaling protocols (D channel protocols), e.g. DSS1 and FTZ 1 TR 6. The interface operates in the OSI model between layer 3 and 4, but only controls layers 1 to 3. Besides popular signaling protocols for ISDN, implementations of CAPI for ATM, GSM and VoIP (H.323 and SIP) exist, thus CAPI applications can be used directly on communications infrastructure.

He worked for Heinz for 32 years before moving on to become CEO of Scotts Miracle-Gro Company. Berger died in 2008 at the age of 72 after a protracted illness. Education and early career Berger was born in 1936 in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania to Edward and Sadie Berger. He attended Princeton University where he graduated in 1958 and Harvard Business School where he earned his M.B.A. in 1960. His father owned a drugstore in Scranton, Pennsylvania where it is said he learned about the power of branding. Berger started his career at Procter & Gamble in 1960 before being offered a position by Heinz in 1964. Heinz Berger was behind the Heinz ketchup marketing campaign that touted the ketchup as being thick and having slow pouring qualities. Advertisements included \\"the ketchup race\\" from 1964 and \\"the slowest ketchup in the West.\\" The commercials showed Heinz being poured from bottles, racing its competitors to see which was thicker. They became one of Heinz's most popular marketing campaigns and were played during Super Bowl V in 1971. The campaigns also spun into the 1970s Heinz \\"Anticipation\\" commercials that used a hit song by Carly Simon. Heinz Chairman and CEO William R. Johnson credited Berger for Heinz success with ketchup by stating that Berger's marketing ideas allowed \\"Heinz to break out of a tie and gain permanent leadership in ketchup.\\" Berger worked for Heinz for 32 years and was in charge of Heinz's operations in India before leaving to become CEO at The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company in 1996. While at Heinz, Berger held numerous positions. In 1970, he became the head of marketing for Heinz's British division. From 1972 to 1979, Charles ran Plasmon, Heinz‚Äôs Italian division. In 1980, Berger became president of Heinz's Weight Watchers division, where he doubled revenue by expanding its supermarket offerings and turned it into Heinz's fastest-growing division. Scotts Miracle-Gro Company In 1996, Berger became CEO of Scotts Miracle-Gro Company. He had been on the board of Miracle-Gro since the 1980s. As CEO, Berger changed the focus of Scotts to being a more consumer oriented company by increasing advertising spending, evolving the brand from that of a chemical company. Sales doubled during his time with the company, largely due to the acquisition of Monsanto Companys' garden unit which included the Ortho pesticide brand. Scotts later built the Berger Learning Center, a multimedia classroom at the company's headquarters. Berger was Chairman and CEO of Scotts until he retired in 2001. James Hagedorn succeeded Berger as CEO of Scotts and credited Berger as \\"largely responsible for the company as it exists today.\\" Berger stayed on as Chairman until he retired from company altogether in January 2003.

Thompson II and published in 1999. The book describes the USS Iowa turret explosion that took place on April 19, 1989, and the subsequent investigations that tried to determine the cause. The explosion aboard the United States Navy battleship killed 47 of the turret's crewmen. Soon after the explosion, Thompson was informed by an Iowa crewman that the Navy was conducting a dishonest investigation into the cause of the tragedy. Thompson, a producer for the television newsmagazine 60 Minutes, later produced several television reports which disputed the Navy's conclusions as to what had caused the explosion. Based on his work for the 60 Minutes reports plus further investigation on his own, Thompson wrote A Glimpse of Hell. The book was published by W. W. Norton & Company. Thompson's book was extremely critical of most of the Navy personnel involved in the investigation, concluding that the Navy had orchestrated a cover-up to conceal the true cause of the explosion. Upon its publication, the book received favorable comments from book reviewers. Thompson later claimed that the Navy tried to suppress sales by banning the book from Navy exchange stores on Navy bases throughout the world. In 2001, five Navy servicemen named in Thompson's book sued Thompson, the book's publisher, and one of Thompson's sources for libel, false light privacy, and conspiracy. The suit was settled out-of-court in 2007 for undisclosed terms. Background On the morning of April 19, 1989, the United States Navy battleship , under the command of Captain Fred Moosally, was northeast of Puerto Rico, steaming at , and preparing to engage in a live-fire exercise with its 16-inch guns.Schwoebel, pp. 1‚Äì2, Thompson, pp. 15, 93‚Äì96. At 09:53, as the ship's 16-inch Turret Two loaded and prepared to fire its three guns, a fireball between 2500 and 3000 ¬∞F (1400 and 1650 ¬∞C) and traveling at with a pressure of blew out from the turret's center gun's open breech. The fireball spread through all three of the turret's gun rooms and through much of the lower levels of the turret. All 47 crewmen inside the turret were killed.Garzke, Dorsey, Diehl, p. 172, Bonner, p. 59, Schwoebel, pp. 7‚Äì8, 136, 232, 238, Thompson, Glimpse, pp. 97, 101‚Äì107, 152. Soon after the fires in the turret were extinguished, Vice Admiral Joseph S. Donnell, commander of Surface Forces Atlantic, appointed Rear Admiral Richard Milligan to conduct an informal one-officer investigation into the explosion.Garzke, Diehl, p. 172, Schwoebel, pp. 10‚Äì15, Thompson, Glimpse, pp. 135‚Äì139, 142, 161‚Äì165. The one- officer investigation was often referred to within the Navy as a \\"JAGMAN\\" and its rules and procedures were laid out in the Navy's Manual of the Judge Advocate General, Chapter 5, Part C (Schwoebel, p. 291). Milligan boarded Iowa with his staff on April 20 and began his investigation by interviewing Iowa crewmembers. Milligan's investigation continued after Iowa returned to its home port of Norfolk on April 23.Diehl, p. 172, Schwoebel, pp. 10‚Äì11, 65, 236, Thompson, Glimpse, p. 137. Five days after the explosion, a gunner's mate who worked in Iowas Turret One called Charles Thompson and told him that Milligan was conducting a dishonest investigation. \\"The news media is the only thing that can keep the Navy honest\\" said the caller.Thompson, \\"Cover-up\\". Thompson, a producer for 60 Minutes, was a former US Navy officer and naval gunfire spotter who had served two tours of duty during the Vietnam War. After leaving the military and becoming a journalist, Thompson had produced numerous news stories about military subjects. Thompson discussed the phone call with his colleague and journalist Mike Wallace, also a former naval officer, who asked him to begin following news stories about the explosion and the Navy's investigation into its cause more closely.Weinberg, Thompson, \\"Cover-up\\", Thompson, Glimpse, pp. 9‚Äì10, 307. Iowas Turret Two explodes on April 19, 1989. On September 7, 1989, Milligan and Admiral Leon A. Edney, the Navy's Vice Chief of Naval Operations, announced the results of Milligan's investigation. Milligan's investigation report, endorsed by the top Navy leadership, concluded that the explosion was \\"most probably\\" a result of an intentional act committed by a Turret Two crewman named Clayton Hartwig. According to the Navy, Hartwig, who had died in the explosion, was a suicidal loner who had initiated the explosion with either an electronic or chemical timer.Rosenthal, The New York Times, \\"Excerpts From Iowa Blast Findings\\", Garzke, Diehl, p. 174, Schwoebel, pp. xvii, 27, 39‚Äì42, 70, 244, Thompson, Glimpse, pp. 284‚Äì285, 288, 299‚Äì302, Bonner, p. 59. Robert Zelnick, an ABC News reporter, wrote an editorial for The New York Times on September 11, 1989, titled, \\"The Navy Scapegoats a Dead Seaman.\\" In the editorial, Zelnick was sharply critical of the Navy's conclusions, stating that Hartwig had been subjected to a \\"process of guilt by fiat\\" and that the evidence against the sailor was very weak.Thompson, Glimpse, p. 307. Mike Wallace read Zelnick's article and asked Thompson to produce a report for broadcast on the explosion and the Navy's investigation.Thompson, Glimpse, pp. 307‚Äì308. With help from a team of ex- military officers, including Ed Snyder, a former commander of the battleship , Thompson produced a story which aired on 60 Minutes in November 1989. The story, conducted by Mike Wallace, heavily criticized the findings of Milligan's investigation. The story contained an interview in which Milligan defended his conclusions, saying, \\"Mike, there is no other cause of this accident. We have looked at everything. We've ruled out everything. This was a deliberate act, most likely done by Petty Officer Hartwig.\\"Thompson, Glimpse, pp. 308‚Äì312, 319‚Äì323, 327‚Äì332, 335‚Äì342. The Navy's conclusions were heavily criticised by the victim's families, the media, and congress. After a test found that an overram of the powder bags into the gun could have caused the explosion, the Navy reopened the investigation. On October 17, 1991, Frank Kelso, the new Navy Chief of Naval Operations, announced that the Navy could not determine who or what had caused the tragedy. Kelso apologized to Hartwig's family and closed the Navy's investigation.Diehl, p. 175, Schwoebel, pp. xix‚Äìxx, 223‚Äì224, 284‚Äì287, Thompson, Glimpse, pp. 352, 372, 380‚Äì382. An independent review of the Navy's investigation by Sandia National Laboratories concluded that the explosion had probably been caused by an overram of the powder bags into the center gun's breech, possibly because of a malfunction in the rammer mechanism or because the gun crew was inadequately trained.Garzke, Vogel, Charles, Diehl, p. 175, Bonner, p. 59, Schwoebel, pp. xxi, 164, 216‚Äì222. Soon after, 60 Minutes broadcast an updated story on the Navy's investigation. The report, written and produced by Thompson and Wallace, included an interview with Kelso.Weinberg, Thompson, Glimpse, pp. 378‚Äì384. After the Navy closed its investigation, Thompson continued his own research into the explosion and its aftermath. Thompson was assisted by Snyder and other former Navy personnel, including Iowa crewmen and Navy headquarters staff members. Family members of the victims as well as staff members of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees also helped Thompson. In addition, he obtained information via Freedom of Information Act requests to the Navy. Furthermore, Thompson accessed depositions taken from Navy leaders and investigators during a lawsuit against the Navy by Hartwig's family.Weinberg, Thompson, \\"Cover-up\\". Thompson's book was published on April 19, 1999, the tenth anniversary of the explosion. The book's publisher was W. W. Norton & Company, based in New York City.Stein, Thompson, \\"Cover-up\\". Content The book begins by describing conditions aboard Iowa before the explosion. Thompson depicts Moosally, the ship's captain, as an inept seaman who gained command of the battleship through political connections. Under Moosally's leadership, or lack thereof, Iowa operated with severe training and safety deficiencies, especially with regard to operations with the ship's 16-inch guns. The book details how the ship's Master Chief Fire Controlman, Stephen Skelley, conducted illegal gunnery experiments with the 16-inch guns. Moosally apparently did not check to ensure that the experiments were authorized, or in some cases, appears not to have been aware that they were being carried out.Stein, Vogel, Thompson, \\"Cover-up\\", Blue. The book describes the explosion on April 19, 1989, and the heroic efforts by the ship's crew to contain the fires and avoid a cataclysmic detonation of the turret's powder magazines. After the fires were contained, Moosally ordered the crew to immediately begin cleaning up the turret. The cleanup involved removing the bodies of the deceased turret crewman and disposing of the damaged turret equipment, all without photographing or otherwise recording the locations of the bodies or equipment which would have presumably assisted with the resulting investigation.Weinberg, Blue. Rear Admiral Richard MilliganAccording to Thompson, the Navy immediately began efforts to cover up the cause of the explosion. Rear Admiral Richard Milligan, assigned to lead the investigation, soon focused his inquiry into trying to prove that one of the deceased turret's crewmembers, Clayton Hartwig, had intentionally caused the explosion. After learning that Hartwig had named another sailor and friend, Kendall Truitt, as a beneficiary of a life insurance policy on himself, Milligan enlisted the help of the Naval Investigative Service (NIS) (the predecessor of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service or NCIS) to investigate Hartwig and Truitt.Stein, Weinberg, Blue. NIS investigators tried to prove, unsuccessfully, that Hartwig and Truitt had had a homosexual relationship with each other and that Hartwig had initiated the explosion after the relationship had soured. As the NIS investigation continued, information about the Navy's focus on the two sailors and innuendoes about their relationship were leaked to the media. The leaks were later said to have come from the NIS and from the Navy's headquarters. Thompson alleges that during its investigation, NIS agents lied or otherwise conducted themselves in an extremely unprofessional manner. Captain Joseph Miceli, assigned by the Navy to lead the technical investigation into the explosion, had supervised the preparation of powder and shells used in Iowa's 16-inch guns. Thus, according to Thompson, Miceli had a conflict of interest in ensuring that the powder, ammunition, or guns were not at fault in the explosion. After being briefed on the NIS's focus on Hartwig, Miceli directed his investigative team to determine how Hartwig had initiated the explosion using an electrical or chemical detonator.Blue. Throughout the investigation, according to Thompson, Admiral Leon A. Edney, the Navy's Vice Chief of Naval Operations, interfered with the investigation by sending suggestions to Milligan on avenues of inquiry and pushing for a finding that Hartwig or Truitt was responsible. Edney interfered with the investigation in order to prevent any findings that the Navy had knowingly operated an unsafe ship in an unsafe manner. Also, Edney feared that if the Iowa class battleships were found to be unsafe, the battleships would be decommissioned and the Navy would lose the associated admiral billets plus the other warships and support ships assigned to the battleship groups.Stein, Blue, Vogel, Diehl, p. 172, Thompson, Glimpse, p. 135. In September 1989 the Navy announced that it had determined that Hartwig intentionally caused the explosion. The victim's family members, many in the media, and the United States Congress rejected the Navy's findings. Sandia National Laboratories, acting on a request from the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services, determined that the explosion could have been an accident caused by overramming the powder bags into the gun's breech during the loading process. Forced by the revelation to reopen its investigation, the Navy inexplicably, according to Thompson, placed Miceli in charge of the new inquiry. Nineteen months later the Navy concluded that it could not determine who or what had caused the explosion, provided a partial apology to Hartwig's family, and closed its investigation.Diehl, p. 175, Schwoebel, pp. xix‚Äìxx, 223‚Äì224, 284‚Äì287, Thompson, pp. 352, 372, 380‚Äì382. In contrast, Sandia concluded that the explosion had probably been caused by an overram of the powder bags into the center gun's breech, possibly because of a malfunction in the rammer mechanism or because the gun crew was inadequately trained.Stein, Garzke, Vogel, Charles, Diehl, p. 175, Bonner, p. 59, Schwoebel, pp. xxi, 164, 216‚Äì222. Critical reception, Navy reaction, and movie Upon its publication, the book received favorable reviews. Dan Blue, reviewing the book for the San Francisco Chronicle, stated that, \\"In its main outlines, it convinces\\" and \\"Beyond accuracy, Thompson's book provides a gripping read\\". Steve Weinberg, in the Denver Post, wrote that, \\"Measured by its information gathering, this is a great book of investigative journalism.\\"Weinberg The book was selected by the Book of the Month Club as its featured selection in March 1999.Stein Thompson stated that after the book was published a previously scheduled invitation to speak at the US Navy's National Museum was rescinded, his book was banned from being sold in the museum's book store, and Navy exchange stores at bases throughout the world were forbidden from selling his book. Emails between Navy officials obtained by Thompson through a Freedom of Information Act request included one from a Navy public affairs officer dated April 15, 1999, saying with regard to Thompson, \\"I will call book wholesalers and tell them not to set up book signings with this author.\\"Stein, Thompson, \\"Cover-up\\", Blue. The Navy denied that it attempted to suppress or censor Thompson's book, stating that it had simply refused permission for Thompson to hold book signings on any Navy bases.Stein, Thompson, \\"Cover-up aboard the USS Iowa\\" In August 1999 Salon.com checked the bookstores at the United States Naval Academy, Naval Submarine Base New London, and Iowa's former home base Naval Station Norfolk and did not find the book available for sale at any of the locations. In 2001 the FX TV network broadcast a movie A Glimpse of Hell based on Thompson's book, starring James Caan and Robert Sean Leonard. The movie received a 3.3 household rating and drew 2.7 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research, enough to make the movie the most-watched program in FX's seven-year history.; W. W. Norton does not appear to have released sales figures for the book. As of January 2009, Amazon.com lists the book at #997,726 in sales out of all books offered by the bookseller, and at No. 85 in books related to the State of Iowa. Lawsuit In March 2001 Moosally, Miceli, and two other former Iowa officers filed suit against Thompson, W. W. Norton, and Dan Meyer, who the plaintiffs stated provided much of the information used in the book, for libel, false light privacy, and conspiracy. In April 2001, another former Iowa crewman filed a separate suit with the same attorney for the same causes of action. In response to the suits, Thompson stated that he stood \\"foursquare\\" behind his book's content.Vogel, Supreme Court of South Carolina, Associated Press, \\"Defamation suit over USS Iowa book settled\\". The other plaintiffs with Moosally were John Morse, Bob Finney, and Joseph Dominick Miceli. Morse was Iowa's former executive officer, Finney Iowa's former operations officer, and Miceli led the Navy's technical investigation into the explosion. Dale Eugene Mortensen, a former gun chief for Iowa's Turret One, filed the separate suit. In April 2004 the South Carolina Supreme Court dismissed the suits against Thompson and Meyer, but allowed the suit against W. W. Norton to proceed. The court stated that South Carolina's long-arm jurisdiction did not apply to Thompson and Meyer, but did to W. W. Norton.Supreme Court of South Carolina. In February 2007 the suits were settled out-of-court for undisclosed terms. Stephen F. DeAntonio, attorney for the plaintiffs, said that his clients felt \\"totally vindicated.\\"Associated Press, \\"Defamation suit over USS Iowa book settled\\". W. W. Norton did not publicly retract or repudiate any of the material in Thompson's book, however, instead sending a letter to the plaintiffs stating, in part, \\"To the extent you believe the book implies that any of you were engaged in a cover-up, were incompetent, committed criminal acts, violated Naval regulations or exhibited faulty seamanship or professional ineptitude, Norton regrets the emotional distress experienced by you or your family.\\"Associated Press, \\"Court allows Iowa officers to sue book publisher\\", Associated Press, \\"Defamation suit over USS Iowa book settled\\".

He currently works as both a performer and choreographer in musical theatre, and has choreographed and/or starred in award-winning shows such as On Your Toes, Singin' in the Rain and Grand Hotel. He began his professional career as a dancer of classical ballet and contemporary ballet and is a former Principal of the Royal Ballet, a major international ballet company based in London. He became internationally recognized for creating the lead role of Swan/Stranger in Matthew Bourne's contemporary dance production of the ballet Swan Lake, a role that was briefly featured in the 2000 film Billy Elliot where Cooper played the adult version of the titular character. Biography Adam Cooper was born 22 July 1971 in Tooting, London to a musician father and a social worker mother. He has an older brother, Simon Cooper, who is also a dancer and they trained at the same schools. From a young age, he and his brother studied tap and ballet at the Jean Winkler School of Dance in Tooting. They also played various musical instruments and sang in a choir. At age 11, Cooper won a place at ArtsEd, a specialist performing arts school in London where he studied classical ballet, character, modern, tap, jazz and contemporary dance, as well as singing, acting and stage combat. After completing his secondary education at the school, aged 16, he was accepted into the Royal Ballet Upper School. At his graduation performance he played the lead role of Young Man in Ashton's the Two Pigeons. Cooper married Sarah Wildor in 2000. She was a principal dancer with the Royal Ballet. and has become an Olivier-nominated actress. Their first daughter, Naomi, was born in 2008 and they now have a younger son named Alexander.> / Dance =Royal Ballet= In 1989 Cooper joined the Royal Ballet and was quickly promoted to First Artist and Soloist in 1991, First Soloist 1993 and Principal Dancer in 1994. He was recognized for his performances in the classic as well as dramatic and contemporary ballet works, and he excelled in playing cruel but sexy villains. While with the Royal Ballet he worked extensively with choreographers Kenneth MacMillan and William Tuckett partnering all the leading ballerinas of the company including Sylvie Guillem and Darcey Bussell. He also performed works choreographed by George Balanchine, Ashley Page, Fokine, Bronislava Nijinska, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Christopher Wheeldon, Matthew Hart, and William Forsythe. He left the Royal Ballet in 1997 to freelance and expand his career opportunities. =Adventures in Motion Pictures= In 1995 Matthew Bourne recruited Cooper to join Adventures in Motion Pictures (now renamed New Adventures) for his radically re-interpreted production of Swan Lake. Together they created the basic Swan movement motifs and Cooper also contributed to the choreography. Cooper performed the dual Swan/Stranger role (the analog of the white and black swan in the classic version) all over the world and his performances won him international acclaim, multiple awards and a strong fan following. Cooper's performance was described as one of \\"tremendous excitement, subtlety,emotional depth and sheer sexiness\\". The popular press embraced him and his photo appeared in many magazines. For his performances as the Swan/Stranger he received the Time Out Award in 1995, the Evening Standard Dance Award in 1997 and the 1999 Astaire Award for Best Dancer. He was also nominated for the 1999 Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical. He appeared briefly at the end of the 2000 film Billy Elliot and, in the guise of The Swan, he represented the accomplished dancer that Billy became when he grew up. A DVD recording of the Swan Lake with Cooper and the original cast was issued in 1996 and can be seen on Youtube.com. Excerpts from Swan Lake (Bourne) appeared on the 1998 Royal Variety TV program and he repeated his Swan/Stranger role for the TV audience. His performance in the Billy Elliot film and in the Swan Lake (Bourne) DVD inspired at least one of the boys playing Billy Elliot in the stage production to join New Adventures in the hopes of performing The Swan role. In 2003 Cooper once again played the Swan/Stranger when AMP toured in Japan, and there was enormous enthusiasm for his performance and he acquired a large number of new fans. In 1997 Cooper was invited by Bourne to take part in the initial planning of AMP's next show, Cinderella. This version of the dance took place in London during the Blitz, but used the same Prokofiev music as the classic version Cinderella (Prokofiev). Cooper helped to create and performed the role of Pilot (the Prince analog) in the initial 1997 London run and also played the Angel (the Godmother analog), and Sarah Wildor was his partner when she played the title role. The production was also performed in Los Angeles in 1999. =Freelance dancer and choreographer= In 1998 Cooper worked with the Scottish Ballet to choreograph Just Scratching the Surface. He also performed the Hoffman role in their production of Tales of Hoffman. Since then he has gone on to choreograph for other ballet companies and for musical theatre. Cooper appeared as a dancer and choreographer at the Exeter Festival for 3 years, heading evenings of dance co-produced with Iain Webb. In 2002 Cooper and Sarah Wildor presented a tribute to Sir Kenneth MacMillan at Exeter and in Japan. The Adam Cooper Company represented the UK at the Washington International Ballet Festival in 2003 performing a revival of Sir Kenneth MacMillan's Sea of Troubles. Cooper has frequently danced as a guest artist with the Royal Ballet since leaving the company, performing lead roles in Romeo and Juliet, Ondine and Onegin. and others. In 2002 he created the role of Badger in William Tuckett's Wind in the Willows. In 2004 created the title role in Tuckett's The Soldier's Tale, which he reprised in 2005 and later performed in Japan in 2009 and 2015. In 2005 he realized a long-held vision with his own production of Les Liaisons dangereuses, a mixture of theater and dance. Co-directed and designed by Lez Brotherston, the production was choreographed by Cooper and he also played the lead role of Viscomte de Valmont. The piece premiered in Japan early in the year before a summer season at Sadler's Wells, with a cast which included Simon Cooper and Sarah Wildor. In 2009 Cooper joined Russell Maliphant to dance in Maliphant's 2:4:10 contemporary dance program- an evening of works celebrating Maliphant's 10 years as a choreographer. Musical theatre =2002 to 2010= In Cooper's first venture into the musical theatre he was both the choreographer and actor (playing the lead role of Junior Dolan) in On Your Toes. In 2002 it played at Leicester Haymarket, and was in transferred in 2003 to the Royal Festival in the West End of London. Sarah Wildor joined the production in 2003 to play the role of Vera Baronova. He was lauded by both the critics and the audience for his contributions and was rewarded with the Critics' Circle National Dance Award for Best Choreography and Most Popular Dancer. In 2004 the production also had a successful tour in Japan. In 2002 Cooper provided the choreography for the Swedish production of Garbo-the Musical. Cooper also played the lead role of Don Lockwood and choreographed Paul Kerryson's Singin' in the Rain in 2004 at Sadler's Wells Theatre, Leicester Haymarket, and was nominated for Critic's Circle Award for Choreography of a Musical. He was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for his choreography of the 2004 Grand Hotel for The Donmar Warehouse. The production won the 2005 Olivier Award in the category of Outstanding Musical Production. In 2005, Cooper and Wildor performed a two- person play, Wallflowering, at the Seven Oaks Playhouse. Their roles were primarily dialogue with intermittent bits of ballroom dancing. Following this, he designed the choreography for the revival of Promises, Promises at Sheffield's Crucible Theatre. In 2006 Cooper appeared alongside Neil Morrissey and Patrick Swayze playing Sky Masterson in Guys and Dolls at The Piccadilly Theatre, London and in 2007 he provided the musical staging for Side by Side by Sondheim for The Venue Theatre, London. 2008 saw Cooper's return to the stage, creating the role of Ramon in Zorro the Musical for the UK tour. He also played the Tin Man in the Royal Festival Hall's summer staging of the musical The Wizard of Oz, after which he turned his attention back to choreography. First, he choreographed Carousel for director Lindsay Posner which had a very successful UK tour and West End run at the Savoy Theatre. Then Cooper was asked by Paul Kerryson to direct and choreograph the first new show, Simply Cinderella, at the brand new Curve Theatre, Leicester. In 2009 Cooper unveiled Shall We Dance at Sadler's Wells, an ambitious all-dance show based on Richard Rodgers' songs. For this production he was the box-office star, director, creator, librettist and choreographer. Later that year, he provided choreography for Lindsay Posner's production of the Donizetti opera Roberto Devereux at the Holland Park Theatre, Kensington, London. Cooper co- starred in the touring stage version of Irving Berlin's White Christmas during the Christmas season in 2009 2010 and 2011. He played the role of Phil Davis. =2011 to the present= Cooper was the above-the-title star playing the role of Don Lockwood in Jonathan Church's highly successful 2011‚Äì2013 production of Singin' in the Rain, with choreography by Andrew Wright. Its first sold-out run was at the Chichester Festival Theatre and then a longer run at West End's Palace Theatre. He also performed the iconic Singin' in the Rain scene on the 2011 Royal Variety Performance TV show. The stage show was nominated for the Best Musical Revival and several other Laurence Olivier and other awards. A cast recording of Singin' in the Rain was issued in 2012. Good Mornin' was performed at the 2012 Olivier Awards Ceremony. The show, starring Cooper, played in Japan for three weeks of November 2014. In 2013 Cooper choreographed Matthew White's well-received production of Candide at the Menier Chocolate Factory. Reviewer Sam Smith wrote \\"Adam Cooper's choreography is racy, and the production finds a particular affinity with the 'Surrealism' of the piece.\\" In late 2013 Cooper was invited to Denmark to choreograph Daniel Bohr's Danish language version of Evita at the Det Ny Teater (The New Theater) in Copenhagen. The show premiered in January 2014. For Evita, Adam Cooper created a choreography with continuous tango elements merged into the rest of the dance. Cooper provided the \\"energetic\\" 60's choreography for Sunny Afternoon Musical at the Hampstead Theatre in London. The show ran from April to end of May in 2014 and then in October 2014 it transferred to The Harold Pinter Theatre (formerly The Comedy Theatre) at the West End. Its run was extended several times due to its popularity with the audience and positive critical reviews. It was nominated for numerous awards and won 4 Olivier Awards in 2015. Details are at Sunny Afternoon. Cooper had another opportunity to present a stage version of Les Liaisons dangereuses (Gef√§hrliche Liebschaften) in 2015. He choreographed and co-directed with Josef E. K√∂pplinger a German musical version of the novel with a newly commissioned book, lyrics and score for the itinerant Staatstheater am G√§rtnerplatz company in Munich, Germany.

Black conservatism emphasizes traditionalism, patriotism, capitalism, free markets, and sometimes social conservatism. Black conservatives are supported by a minority of black Americans, whereas the majority of black Americans favor the left of the political spectrum.  Overview  Booker T. Washington = Beliefs = One of the main characteristics of black conservatism is its emphasis on personal choice and responsibilities above socioeconomic status and institutional racism. In the tradition of African American politics and intellectual life, black conservatives tend to side with Booker T. Washington as contrasted with W. E. B. Du Bois. For many black conservatives, the key mission is to bring repair and success to the black community by applying the following fundamental principles: * The pursuit of educational and professional excellence as a means of advancement within the society; * Policies that promote safety and security in the community beyond the typical casting of a criminal as a \\"victim\\" of societal racism; * Not using the lens of race and the country's history of discrimination as justifications for not excelling to the best of your abilities; * Local economic development through free enterprise rather than looking to the federal government for assistance; * Empowerment of the individual via self-improvement (virtue), conscience, and supernatural grace.For an overview of these themes, see Stan Faryna, Brad Stetson, and Joseph G. Conti, Eds., Black and Right: The Bold New Voice of Black Conservatives in America, (Westport, CT: Praeger, 1997) Black conservatives typically oppose affirmative action, which is supported by the vast majority of African-American communities. They tend to argue that efforts to obtain reparations for slavery are either misguided or counter-productive. Black conservatives tend to be self-critical of aspects of African-American culture that they believe have created poverty and dependency. Moreover, black conservatives ‚Äì especially black Republicans ‚Äì are often accused of being Uncle Toms. Ebony in their May 2001 \\"100+ Most Influential Black Americans\\" issue, did not include a number of influential African Americans such as Thomas Sowell, Shelby Steele, Armstrong Williams, Walter Williams and, most notably, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. The Economist described the exclusion of Justice Thomas from the list as spiteful. Black conservatives favor integration of African Americans into mainstream America and, consequently, disagree with black nationalism and separatism. Black conservatives are more inclined to support economic policies promoting globalization, free trade and tax cuts. According to a 2004 study, 13.7% of blacks identified as \\"Conservative\\" or \\"Extremely Conservative\\" with another 14.4% identifying as slightly conservative. However, the same study indicated that less than ten percent identified as Republican or Republican-leaning. Likewise, a 2007 Pew Research Center survey showed that 19% of blacks identified as Religious Right.Pew Forum: Many Americans Uneasy with Mix of Religion and Politics In 2004, the Pew Research Center indicated only 7% of blacks identified as Republican.Part 1: Party Affiliation: The 2004 Political Landscape A National Election Pool poll showed that support for California Proposition 8 (2008) (a state constitutional amendment defining marriage as an opposite-sex union) was strong among African-American voters; 70% of those interviewed in the exit poll‚Äîa higher percentage than any other racial group‚Äîstated that they voted in favor of Proposition 8. Polls by both the Associated Press and CNN mirrored this data, reporting support among black voters to be at 70% and 75%, respectively. African American support was considered crucial to the Proposition's passage because African Americans made up an unusually large percentage of voters in 2008; the presence of African American presidential candidate Barack Obama on the ballot was believed to have increased African American voter turnout. = Historical basis = From Reconstruction up until the New Deal, the black population tended to vote Republican. During that period, the Republican Party‚Äîparticularly in the Southern United States‚Äîwas seen as more racially liberal than the Democratic Party, primarily because of the role of the Southern wing of the Democratic Party as the party of racial segregation and the Republican Party's roots in the abolitionist movement (see Dixiecrats). Blacks started to shift in significant numbers to the Democrats with the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt and continued with the election of John F. Kennedy. This shift was also influenced by Herbert Hoover's practice of firing loyal African-Americans from positions within the Republican Party, in order to increase his appeal to Southern white voters. This can be considered an early example of a set of Republican Party methods that were later termed the Southern Strategy.

The mill is in a complex known as the Great Southern Roller Flour Mills Limited. On the site (which dates from 1922) are silos, an office and laboratory and other buildings. There was a second Dingo Flour mill in Narrogin from 1903 to late October 1912, when a new company was formed to take over from the Co-operative company. The Heritage Council of Western Australia says: ‚Äú‚Ä¶the place has a landmark quality with strong vertical proportions, height and massing of the mill and silo structures, the Dingo Flour brand image, and the Norfolk Island pine; the place has been commonly referred to as ‚ÄòDingo Flour Mill‚Äô for many years, showing the impact of the symbol, and has developed its own set of myths, including that it was painted by Alan Bond, demonstrating that the ‚Äòdingo‚Äô contributes to the community‚Äôs sense of place‚Ä¶‚ÄùAdam Boyd - paints Red Dingo on PICA roof as a spoof on the story that Alan Bond began his career painting the dingo logo on the Dingo Flour silo at Fremantle Daily news (Perth,W.A.), 13 October 1989, p.1, The mill was designed by architect J.F. Allen, of Allen and Nicholas, and the office building was designed by Powell, Cameron & Chisholm Architects. The sign and the rest of the site was heritage-listed in 2008. The dingo logo was painted by artist Les Nash in 1940 for ¬£40. According to his daughter Mona Rankin it took her father about a week to complete the logo. Nash first sketched the dingo onto graph paper and then used the gridded panels on the silo to guide his large-scale transfer of the design onto the silo itself. It is about five and a half storeys high. It was painted over during World War II, but its outlines were still faintly visible. Refugees and migrants coming to Fremantle saw the sign, and it remains a useful reference point for boaters and anglers. It was mostly re-painted in March 2001. In 2010 the flour mill was renovated, and the dingo now gets re-painted every month.

Career In 1931 Juan published his first novel, L'in√∫til combat (Useless battle). In 1932 he published Terres de l'Ebre, his best known work, a novel that describes the situation of the peasants of the Ebro delta, forgotten and humble, working in a hard and thankless land, subject to the fatalities. The novel transforms their personal and community experiences into fiction. In 1933 he published Notes d'un estudiant que va morir boig and in 1935 Boig Camins de nit. After the Civil War he stopped publishing until, in 1947, he released Tino Costa, with versions in Catalan and Spanish. In 1946 he had, however, published, a biography: Cervantes. From 1948 he wrote works in Spanish such as Sobre las piedras grises (1948) which won the Nadal Prize for novel, and especially Martin Masks (1959).

The coin features an image of the goddess of Liberty and her accompanying Phrygian cap.  History  The Liberty Cap large cent, designed by Joseph Wright, was issued by the Mint from 1793 to 1796. The Mint created this type of cent in an attempt to satisfy the public objections to the Chain cent and Wreath cent. It appears to have been a little more successful than its precedents, as it was continued into 1797, unlike the previous two issues, which were each issued for less than a year. In 1795, the planchets became too thin for the use of edge lettering on the coins, so coins from late-1795 onward have no edge lettering. The Liberty Cap half cent was designed not by Wright, however, but by Chief Engraver of the United States Mint, Robert Scot.  Varieties  Due to the differences in individual dies used in the coin dies used to produce these coins, there are over one hundred known varieties for the series. Some of these include the variable shapes of the head or differences in the size and shape of the numbers in the date. Some of these varieties greatly influences the value of the coin for collectors.  Sources  * R.S.

He moved to Vienna in 1933. At his most productive, he scored up to 10 films a year, including numerous classics and masterpieces of the German and Austrian cinema. Life Schmidt-Gentner was born in Neustadt am Rennsteig in Thuringia, Germany. During his childhood he learnt the violin and took lessons in composition from Max Reger. After World War I Schmidt-Gentner worked as a civil servant checking that cinema owners were paying their full taxes. Through one of his clients he got a position as a band leader at film theatre performances. This raised his interest in films and as early as 1922 he produced his first composition to accompany a silent film. He performed many of his new pieces himself on the piano during films. He was also already responsible at this period for the sound tracks of a number of German classic films, for example Alraune (1928), The White Hell of Pitz Palu (1929) and Hokuspokus (1930) With the arrival of sound films he quickly became one of the most sought-after filmscore composers in Germany, so that for a time he was scoring up to 10 films a year. He had a preference for light comedies and cheerful musical romances, but occasionally he took on more heavyweight productions with political overtones, for example the National Socialist propaganda film Wien 1910 (1943) or the historical film ' (1955) about the k. u. k. spy Colonel Redl. In 1933 he moved to Vienna, where he directed his only two films, Die Pompadour (1935) and Prater (1936), for the company Mondial- Film. For Sascha-Film he composed the music for some of the greatest specimens of the Wiener Film genre, among others Maskerade and Hohe Schule (both 1934). After the Anschluss (the annexation of Austria to Germany) he became the \\"house composer\\" for the National Socialist-owned Wien-Film, which had developed out of the former Sascha-Film. For them he scored not only their many escapist romantic comedies, but also some of their few overt propaganda films such as Heimkehr (1941), Wien 1910 (1942) or Das Herz mu√ü schweigen (1944). He was also repeatedly commissioned by the top directors of wartime Vienna, Willi Forst and Gustav Ucicky, whom he already knew from previous work, to write scores for their productions, such as Der Postmeister (1940), Operette (1940), Wiener Blut (1942) and Wiener M√§deln (1943/1949). After the end of the war Schmidt-Gentner remained loyal to Vienna and successfully continued his composing career for many more films, predominantly musicals set in Austria, until he retired in 1955. Altogether he composed the music for about 200 films. He died in Vienna on 12 February 1964.

Of these the 1819 version is the best known. In these two paintings Kersting depicted fellow German painter Caspar David Friedrich in his studio. Description The picture shows the painter leaning on the back of a chair, focused entirely upon the easel before him. It is not possible for the viewer to see what the artist sees, because only the back of the canvas is visible. Friedrich, apparently lost in thought, holds in his right hand a brush, and in his left a mahlstick, palette, and several other brushes. The studio is ascetically bare. Only two other palettes, a straightedge, and a t-square hang upon the wall. Commentary Hamburg version (1811). Hamburg version There are two versions of this portrait. In the Hamburg version (1811) Friedrich is seated before his easel, painting, with his arm leaning on the mahlstick. In this version the viewer shares his view of the painting, which is recognizably a mountain landscape with a waterfall. There is also a replica of this painting, painted in 1819, which is currently located in Mannheim. Berlin version Caspar David Friedrich sought seclusion, so that he could pursue his work undisturbed. Kersting depicts painting as a contemplative and reflective process - therefore the studio serves as a place of pure concentration. It is not what Frederick paints that is important, but the reverent meditation with which he paints. In the Berlin version the painter is far more removed from the outside world - a chair leg is interposed between his feet and the viewer, and the door to the left of the composition is no longer visible. Most important, however, is the rotation of the easel, which hides the painting from the viewer. The picture has probably progressed to the point where Friedrich laid aside his plein-air drawings of nature and let his own recollection guide the painting to completion. All distractions have been removed from the almost empty studio. The painter Karl von K√ºgelgen added: The doctor and naturalist Carl Gustav Carus described his working process as follows: Friedrich himself did not elaborate upon his methods. He spoke and wrote of his studio time as the \\" consecrated hour \\" within which he did not wish to be disturbed. K√ºgelgen asked himself about the significance of the T-square, which hung as the \\" sole adornment \\" on the wall, and how \\" alone among all other things it was so honored\\". The reason was that ruler and triangle adhere to the sober simplicity of the studio and to Friedrich's working methods, a number of which involved mathematics. Studio Woman at the Window (German: Frau am Fenster) Friedrich's Dresden studio was in the suburb of Pirna. He continued to use it up to 1820. From two sepia drawings from 1805-06 it is evident that the windows here of the studio on the Elbe opened outwards. Friedrich constructed the wooden shutters only after 1806 and took them with him when he moved to a larger house after marrying. These shutters can be seen in the new studio space in the painting Woman at the Window of 1822. Georg Friedrich Kersting Georg Friedrich Kersting belonged to the Dresden circle of Friedrich's friends, and like him came from Mecklenburg and had studied from the same teachers in the Copenhagen academy from 1805 to 1808, until settling in Dresden. Kersting accompanied Friedrich in the summer of 1810 on a hike in the Sudeten mountains, and is probably the figure depicted in several of Friedrich's drawings and watercolors from that time. In 1818 Kersting became the head of the painting department of the porcelain factory in Meissen, but still remained in contact with Friedrich for a time. Kersting preferred painting portraits with an interior setting, and portrayed people familiar to him in a manner that held personal meanings. However, none of his other paintings were as spare as this portrait of his famous friend Friedrich. It differs enormously from the \\"chaotic study\\" of the painter Gerhard von K√ºgelgen, which was stuffed with innumerable plaster casts and painting equipment.

The Classic Head depicted Liberty with long, curly hair. The reverse designed by John Reich depicted the coin's denomination and value inside a wreath. Kneass's design, however, scaled down the design so it would fit on smaller coins and then added a heraldic eagle on the reverse, substituting the simple design by John Reich. A similar design on gold coinage kept the name \\"Classic Head\\", but only retained the curly hair. The head was completely redesigned by William Kneass, and featured a traditional maiden with a ribbon binding her long, curly hair. This variety omitted \\"E pluribus unum\\" from the reverse of the coin. In 1840, a smaller head was designed to conform with the appearance of the larger gold coins, therefore making the Classic Head design obsolete.

He was faculty of the University of Pennsylvania until 1927, at which time he joined the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago. Edward Chiera at Oriental Institute, Chicago, 1931. Chiera was Annual Professor of the American Schools of Oriental Research (ASOR) at Baghdad in 1924 ‚Äì 1925. At that time he conducted archaeological excavations in ancient Nuzi, near Kirkuk, Iraq, at the invitation of Gertrude Bell and sponsored by the Iraq Museum. His discovery and deciphering of the Nuzi Tablets was an important archaeological result. A pre-eminent scholar of ancient cuneiform languages, Chiera became Editor of the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary Project, a monumental work which had been started in 1921, and eventually took 85 years to complete. He was a close associate of the director and founder of the Oriental Institute, James Henry Breasted. Chiera also acted as a curator of the Museum of the Oriental Institute, and made significant acquisitions for its collections, in addition to his own discoveries. Chiera led Oriental Institute excavations at Khorsabad, near Mosul, Iraq in 1928 - 1929, again with great success. The site of the ancient palace of King Sargon II was excavated. Valuable works of Assyrian art were recovered, including a colossal Lamassu which had guarded the entrance to the palace. He continued as field director of ASOR in 1931, in a joint expedition of ASOR and Harvard University. He was instrumental in the development of plans for the ASOR, for the Iraq Museum, and in the careers of other noted archaeologists.

Description Serpents Trail, unknown date The trail was built by the visionary John Otto, who began the campaign to establish the national monument. The trail was, in fact, a road from Grand Junction through No Thoroughfare Canyon to the rimrock near Cold Shivers Point, with an elevation gain of nearly over . From Cold Shivers Point the road proceeded at a gentler grade for to Glade Park. Otto began his survey in 1911 with the help of civil engineer J.F. Sleeper. Otto's grand plan was to link Grand Junction to Moab, Utah by a scenic road to be part of a transcontinental road system. Construction began in 1912 and continued sporadically to 1921, when Mesa County took the project over. Engineer J.B. Claybaugh completed the project in 1924. The construction of the Rim Rock Drive destroyed portions of the Serpents Trail. A portion has been preserved as a hiking trail. During the 1930s the Park Service considered upgrading the trail to a higher standard of road, but dropped the project.

The Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph was an evening daily newspaper published in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania from 1927 to 1960. Part of the Hearst newspaper chain, it competed with the Pittsburgh Press and Post-Gazette until being purchased and absorbed by the latter paper. Predecessors The Sun- Telegraphs history can be traced back through its 19th- and early 20th-century forebears: the Chronicle, Telegraph, Chronicle Telegraph, and Sun. =Chronicle= The Morning Chronicle was established on June 26, 1841 by Richard George Berford. At first a semi-weekly paper, it became a daily on September 8 of the same year. The original editor was 19-year-old J. Heron Foster, who would later be the founding editor of the Spirit of the Age and the Pittsburgh Dispatch. A weekly edition of the paper first appeared in November 1841 with the title The Iron City and Pittsburgh Weekly Chronicle. On August 30, 1851 the daily paper started issuing later in the day, becoming the Evening Chronicle. Historian Leland D. Baldwin described the Chronicles existence as \\"undistinguished for several decades\\". =Chronicle Telegraph= On January 2, 1884, the Pittsburgh Evening Chronicle merged with the Pittsburgh Telegraph (founded in 1873 as the Pittsburgh Evening Telegraph) to form the Pittsburgh Chronicle Telegraph. In 1892, the Chronicle Telegraph Building on Fifth Avenue gained brief notoriety as the site where anarchist Alexander Berkman attempted to assassinate industrialist Henry Clay Frick. In October 1900 the paper sponsored the Chronicle Telegraph Cup, a postseason baseball series won by the Brooklyn Superbas over the Pittsburgh Pirates. Held only once, the contest was a precursor to the current World Series. Iron and steel manufacturer George T. Oliver, later a U.S. senator, purchased the evening Chronicle Telegraph in November 1900 to complement the morning paper he had acquired earlier in the year, the Commercial Gazette. The papers were soon housed under the same roof and frequently exchanged or shared staff members. In 1915, a new eight-story building on the current site of the U.S. Steel Tower opened as home to the Chronicle Telegraph along with Oliver's merged and retitled morning paper, the Gazette Times. Upon the death of George T. Oliver in 1919, control of the Chronicle Telegraph and Gazette Times passed to his sons George S. and Augustus K. Oliver. =Sun= The Pittsburgh Sun was an evening paper first issued on March 1, 1906 by the publisher of the morning Pittsburgh Post. Pittsburgh newspaper consolidation timeline Formation On August 1, 1927, William Randolph Hearst completed a purchase of the two Oliver papers (Gazette Times and Chronicle Telegraph), including the building. He coordinated the transaction with publisher Paul Block, who at the same time became owner of Pittsburgh's other morning-evening combination: the Post and Sun. An immediately ensuing trade between the two buyers gave Hearst both evening dailies, which he merged to form the Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph, while Block created the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette from the two morning papers. The first issues of the new publications rolled off the presses the next day. The deal stipulated that the Sun-Telegraph, but not the Post-Gazette, would publish on Sundays, even though the latter paper's predecessors had Sunday editions and the former's did not. The combined Sunday circulation that the Post-Gazette would have inherited was instead transferred to the Sunday Sun- Telegraph. The Sun-Telegraph was patterned after Hearst's other twenty-five newspapers in its use of screaming headlines, large type, sensational reporting, unconventional picture layouts, splashes of color, and front-page box scores. Decline In the 1950s the \\"Sun-Telly\\" was losing subscribers and advertisers to its direct competitor in the evening and Sunday fields, the Pittsburgh Press, and to a lesser degree the Post-Gazette. The Post-Gazettes co-publisher William Block Sr. later recalled that \\"The Press, which had a great deal of newer equipment, was in a position to give later news, better distribution, and was killing [the Sun-Telegraph] on Sunday.\\" Sale and aftermath In 1960 the Hearst organization sold its floundering Pittsburgh operation to the Post-Gazette, which in absorbing its rival gained a Sunday edition. The deal turned out badly for the purchaser: The Sunday edition proved unprofitable; the Sun-Telegraph building, which served as the new Post- Gazette headquarters, was uncomfortable and inefficient; and many former Sun- Telegraph subscribers, preferring to remain evening readers, switched to the Pittsburgh Press. These problems helped spur the Post-Gazette to enter into a joint operating agreement with the stronger Press in the following year. The Post-Gazette bore the subtitle \\"Sun-Telegraph\\" from 1960 through 1977, though by late 1962 the subtitle's font size had gradually shrunk to almost unnoticeable proportions.

Located in at Mako , (present-day Makung, Pescadores Islands, Republic of China), the Mako Guard District was responsible for control of the strategic Straits of Taiwan and for patrols along the Taiwan and China coastlines and in the South China Sea. It was disbanded in 1943, and reestablished as the Takao Guard District at Takao on the Taiwan main island. History The were second tier naval bases, similar to the first tier , with docking, fueling and resupply facilities, but typically lacked a shipyard or training school. They tended to be established by strategic waterways or major port cities for defensive purposes.http://ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/ref/KYE/CINCPAC-11-45/index.html In concept, the Guard District was similar to the United States Navy Sea Frontiers concept. the Guard District maintained a small garrison force of ships and Naval Land Forces which reported directly to the Guard District commander, and hosted detachments of the numbered fleets on a temporary assignment basis. The port of Mako in the Pescadores Islands was an area with a long association with the Imperial Japanese Navy, having been the first portion of Taiwan captured during the Japanese invasion of Taiwan in the First Sino-Japanese War. Mako was designated a third echelon naval port, or on 4 July 1901. It served as a staging point and refueling base in the Russo- Japanese War, and especially during the early stages of the Second Sino- Japanese War. Mako was upgraded to full Guard District status on 20 November 1941, and served as a staging group and supply base for the invasion of the Philippines and other naval operations in Southeast Asia after the start of the Pacific War.Goldstein, The Pacific War Papers.

It is a gully on Mount Emu Creek, where a small stream adjoins from Station.Ian D. Clark, pp103-118, Scars on the Landscape. A Register of Massacre sites in Western Victoria 1803‚Äì1859, Aboriginal Studies Press, 1995 Of particular note for this massacre is the extent of oral history and first hand accounts of the incident and detail in settler diaries, records of Wesleyan missionaries, and Aboriginal Protectorate records. Following the massacre there was popular disapproval and censure of the leading perpetrator, Frederick Taylor, so that Taylor's River was renamed Mount Emu Creek. The massacre effectively destroyed the Tarnbeere Gundidj clan. Cause The massacre was undertaken by Frederick Taylor and others in retaliation for some sheep being killed by two unidentified Aborigines, as reported by one of Taylor's shepherds. As Aboriginal clans were pushed from their lands, their traditional food of kangaroo and emu became much scarce forcing Aborigines to kill sheep to fend off starvation. A common resistance tactic against the European invasion and dispossession was an economic war to drive sheep off and to kill sheep for food.Richard Broome, pp76-79, Aboriginal Victorians: A History Since 1800, Allen & Unwin, 2005, , However, George Robinson, the Chief Protector of Aborigines, in a letter to Assistant Protector Charles Sievwright on 11 July 1839, questions Taylor's allegation saying: > What proof is there of the Blacks having killed the sheep? The shepherd said > so. Might not the shepherd have done it himself and after keeping the > hindquarters for his own use have given the forequarters to the natives ... > If this is the only charge Mr Taylor can allege against the aboriginal > natives it certainly amounts to very little.

A Register of Massacre sites in Western Victoria > 1803‚Äì1859, Aboriginal Studies Press, 1995 The Massacre Frederick Taylor, the manager at Glenormiston station, with associates James Hamilton and Bloomfield led a group of several shepherds in their employ and attacked a sleeping Aboriginal camp, firing upon and killing men, women and children. The bodies were dumped in the waterhole and later burnt by some accounts. Several Aborigines were able to escape and later told their accounts to Assistant Protector Sievwright, and Wesleyan missionaries Benjamin Hurst and Francis Tuckfield. Taylor had formerly been implicated in the killing of Woolmudgin from the Wathaurong people on 17 October 1836, and had fled to Van Diemen's Land to avoid interview and possible prosecution in that case. In a deposition by Edward Williamson, overseer to the Wesleyan Buntingdale Mission establishment at Birregurra, outlines the events of the massacre as reported to him by Wore-gu-i-moni: > ...The party advanced in an extended line upon the natives, Mr Taylor was in > the centre of the line, the shepherds were on each side of him, they > advanced shouting and immediately fired upon the natives who were asleep. > They succeeded in killing all they could see, amounting to thirty five (35). > I was particular in ascertaining the exact number and they (the natives) > gave me the same number over and over again.

Accessed December 14, 2008 Aftermath Glenormiston station was purchased by Niel Black in 1840, who wrote in his journal: > The blacks have been very troublesome on it [Glenormiston] and I believe > they have been cruelly dealt with. The late superintendent [Taylor] ran off > from a fear that he would be apprehended and tried for murdering the > natives. The poor creatures are terror stricken and will be easily managed. > ...

Black maintained the dispossession and native terror engendered by the massacre by driving Djargurd Wurrung people from his run, pulling down any miam-miams (bark shelters) he found and leaving gunpowder to show as a warning sign. Taylor, fearing prosecution for the massacre, in late 1839 or early 1840 fled to the obscurity of India for a few years. He returned to Victoria and in June 1844 was managing a station on the Mitchell River near Lindenow. When Taylor applied to take up his own run in Gippsland, the Commissioner of Crown Lands, Charles Tyers, refused to grant any land citing Taylor's treatment of Aborigines in the Western District. Taylor appealed to Governor Charles La Trobe requesting: > a copy of these grave charges that are recorded against me that I may have > an opportunity of showing Mr Tyers and the Government that I am innocent of > any improper treatment of the aboriginal natives of this district. La Trobe reviewed the case over subsequent months, including the evidence collected by Charles Sievwright and forwarded by Chief Protector of Aborigines George Robinson, and upheld Tyer's decision. Despite this decision Taylor became a joint licence holder of Lindenow with the Loughnans in 1845. In March 1846 La Trobe informed the Colonial Secretary that all charges against Taylor had \\"ended in satisfactory disproval\\". For the next 13 years Taylor continued to hold licences for land in Gippsland along the Mitchell and Tambo rivers, around Lake Victoria and Lake King, and at Swan Reach, where he continued with a campaign of dispossession of the Gunai people.

The egg was made for Alexander Kelch, who presented it to his wife, Barbara (Varvara) Kelch- Bazanova. Design The egg was created by workmaster Michael Perkhin (Russian, 1860‚Äì1903) and is crafted of gold, silver, rose-cut diamonds, brilliant diamonds and translucent royal blue enamel. The miniature elephant is made of silver, gold, ivory, rose-cut diamonds and red and green enamel. One end of the pine cone, a symbol of resurrection, is set with four petal- shaped portrait diamonds, forming a quatrefoil enclosing the date \\"1900\\". The opposite end is set with a rose-cut diamond star, enclosing a portrait diamond over a later miniature of a young woman. The Egg originally bore the monogram B.K.(for Barbara Kelch) beneath the portrait diamond, probably similar to that of the 1899 Kelch Twelve Panel egg. The egg shell opens to reveal, in a fitted velvet compartment, a surprise, an oxidized silver Indian elephant automaton with ivory tusks supporting an enameled turbaned mahout seated upon a gold fringed red and green guilloche enamel saddle cloth. Each side is set with three rose-cut diamond collets, one covers a keyhole. When wound with the original gold key, the tiny elephant, lumbers forward, shifting its weight from one side to the other, all the while turning its head and flicking its tail. The egg has a height of 9.5 cm. Ownership One of the six Kelch Eggs sold to Morgan in Paris by A La Vieille Russie. The Egg was sold in 1929 to a private United States collector. Sold in 1989 by Christie's Geneva to Joan Kroc (widow of Ray Kroc, former chairman of McDonald's) of San Diego, California for $3.1 million. Daniel Grossman, a New York art dealer, represented Joan Kroc at the sale and he stayed on the telephone with her throughout the bidding. Mrs. Kroc later told the New York Times \\"I was thrilled when I was told I had bought the egg.\\" She had recently pledged $1 million to San Diego's 1989 three week arts festival \\"Treasures of the Soviet Union\\" and the Egg was the 26th Faberge egg at the festival.

It was filmed primarily in Spain throughout 2006. At the time of release, it was the most expensive French and non English-speaking film of all time. The film was negatively received by critics, but performed well at several European box offices, topping charts in Poland, Spain and France. In May 2008, it received the \\"G√©rard du cin√©ma\\" (the French equivalent of the Golden Raspberry Awards) for \\"Worst French Film of 2007\\". Plot Ast√©rix and Ob√©lix must win the Olympic Games in order to help their friend Lovesix (St√©phane Rousseau) marry Princess Irina (portrayed by Vanessa Hessler). Brutus (Beno√Æt Poelvoorde) uses every trick in the book to have his own team win the game, and get rid of his father Julius Caesar (Alain Delon) in the process. The film is loosely adapted from the original Asterix at the Olympic Games comic book. The love story subplot between Lovesix and Irina was not featured in the original story. Brutus, portrayed here as a comical villain with no relation to his depictions in Asterix comics, is the main antagonist, although he was not even featured as a character in the original comic book. Cast There is a cameo of Adriana Karembeu as Mrs Geriatrix and Jamel Debbouze reprises his role as Numerobis. German comedy star and director Michael Bully Herbig has a bit-part as a mute Roman soldier. Italian comedy actor Enrico Brignano appears as a reporter. The film featured several cameos by real-life sports stars, such as Michael Schumacher, Jean Todt, Zinedine Zidane, Tony Parker and Am√©lie Mauresmo. The part of Roman athlete Claudius Cornedurus (Gluteus Maximus), played by J√©r√¥me Le Banner, was originally to be played by Jean-Claude Van Damme. Production Filming took place in Alicante (including the Ciudad de la Luz studio), Spain and lasted six months. Box office The film grossed $23.4 million in France in its opening weekend, which was more than 60% of its gross in 19 territories in which the film was released. Box Office Mojo estimated $38.7 million in revenue within a week after the film was released.

The college was established in January 2007 with the amalgamation of Siena College (Findon), Cardinia Catholic School (Flinders Park), Mater Christi School (Seaton), and Our Lady of the Manger School (Findon).  History  Nazareth Catholic College was established in January 2007 with the amalgamation of three neighbouring Catholic primary schools and Siena College. At the time of its inception in 2007 the Secondary College consisted of a predominately female population, as the Secondary College had previously been Siena College, a school for girls. In 2011 the first co- educational cohort of Year 12 students graduated from the College. As an essentially new College, Nazareth Catholic College underwent significant building works on both campuses. In 2011 the Primary Campus completed a multipurpose space and gym funded by the Building the Education (BER) funding provided by the Australian Government. In the same year the Secondary Campus at Flinders Park completed a Music Centre with additional classrooms built above the new Music Centre as well as additional classrooms in place of the previous Music Centre. In 2012 an additional Technology workshop was created from an existing classrooms as was a Textiles Room from a previous storage area at the Secondary Campus. In 2013 another learning space was created in the Secondary College Library, with additional transportable classrooms added. With funding received from the Australian Government the Secondary Campus added new ventilation, skylights and lighting in the existing gym. In 2019, an additional building was added to the Secondary campus to accommodate an adult learning environment for the senior year levels, as well as to expand the school for the introduction of year 7 students to the Secondary campus.  Curriculum  The Nazareth curriculum follows a framework that covers the eight nationally recognised key learning areas: English, Mathematics, Science, Society and Environment, Languages, Arts, Health and Physical Education and Technology. As with other Australian Schools these subjects conform to the requirements of the Australian Curriculum and the South Australian Curriculum Standards and Accountability (SACSA) Framework. From Reception to Year 7, students study core subjects of English, Mathematics, Science, Design and Technology, Visual Arts, Drama, Dance and Music, Studies of Society and the Environment, Health and Physical Education, as well as Religious Education, and commence studies of a second language with Italian. Japanese is offered as an additional second language for study from Year 8. In Years 11 and 12 a full range of South Australian Certificate of Education (SACE) courses are offered, as is the Vocational Education and Training module Community Studies.

Browning Field has been the home of high school and professional athletic events since 1910. It has hosted athletes such as Babe Ruth and Red Grange. Origin and History John T. Browning (1830‚Äì1910) was a lawyer who served as the City of Moline's first City Attorney. He was also a two-term State Assemblyman. In his last year of his life, Browning was planning on erecting a memorial to himself on the farmland that he owned when he was convinced by A. M. Beal, President of the Moline Board of Education, to deed the land to the city for use as an athletic park. On July 14, 1910, he added the codicil to his will, stating that his land were to be \\"held in trust forever by the City of Moline and dedicated to the public as and for a playground and athletic park, which shall be known and designated as the John T. Browning Park, Playground, and Athletic Field\\". The land is deeded to the city of Moline for use as a \\"playground and athletic park\\".History of Browning Park - Moline Boosters Club While the sports teams of Moline High School have been the primary tenants of the field (and the adjoining Wharton Field House), the Rock Island Independents, the only professional American football team to be charter members of two major leagues, called Browning Park its home in the 1920s, as did the minor league baseball Moline Plowboys. The facility opened on Oct. 5, 1912. Moline High School defeated Maquoketa 34-0 in a football game, the first event at John T. Browning Park. The next four years saw the creation of an American football/track and field stadium and a baseball field. In the late 1920s, T. F. Wharton, president of the Moline High School boosters' club led the drive toward the sale of bonds, the proceeds of which to pay for the construction of a field house on adjoining land (this was also deeded to the city of Moline upon the retirement of the bonds). Wharton Field House was opened to the public in 1928. Moline Plowboys History Moline first gained a minor league franchise in July, 1914 when the Danville Speakers relocated and the Moline Plowboys were established. The \\"Plowboys\\" name reflected Moline's agricultural production history. Companies such as John Deere, Moline Plow Company, and Minneapolis-Moline were located in Moline. The Plowboys initially played at Athletic Park, before moving to Browning Field in 1920. The Plowboys won Three-I League Championships at Browning in 1921 and 1937. The franchise was an affiliate of the Detroit Tigers (1932), Chicago Cubs (1937‚Äì40) and Philadelphia A's(1947‚Äì48). From 1920-22, the Plowboys were managed by player-manager Earle Mack, son of legendary Hall of Fame owner/manager Connie Mack. Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Warren Giles, future President of the National League (1951-1969), was President of the Plowboys Franchise from 1919-1922. Browning Field served as the home of the Plowboys from 1920-1948. The 5,600 capacity baseball park had dimensions of (LF-CF-RF) 550-440-377.https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/park.cgi?id=IL030 The first night game at the park was July 11, 1930. Professional Football In 1926, the Rock Island Independents played at Browning Field. The Independents had been a charter member franchise of the National Football League, playing in the league from 1920-1925 against the likes of the Chicago Bears, Green Bay Packers and Chicago Cardinals. However, the Independents left the NFL and Douglas Park, moving to Browning Field and playing in the new, but short lived American Football League. On October 3, 1926 the Independents hosted the football New York Yankees and their star player Pro Football Hall of Fame legend Red Grange, losing 26-0 with a home crowd of 5,000. The AFL and the Independents folded after the 1926 season. Major League Baseball Events In an exhibition game on April 12, 1920 the Plowboys defeated the Chicago White Sox 7-1 at Browning Field. On April 14, 1938 the Chicago Cubs Played an exhibition at Browning Field against the Plowboys.http://archive.constantcontact.com/fs193/1102126619946/archive/1118710125156.html Babe Ruth appeared at Browning Field on June 26, 1940. 2,600 fans showed for a Plowboys exhibition game starring Ruth and to watch Ruth put on a batting practice exhibition.

ROHHAD mainly affects the endocrine system and autonomic nervous system, but patients can exhibit a variety of signs. Patients present with both alveolar hypoventilation along with hypothalamic dysfunction, which distinguishes ROHHAD from congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS). ROHHAD is a rare disease, with only 100 reported cases worldwide thus far. The first sign of ROHHAD is a rapid weight gain between 1.5 and 11 years of age. Typically, hypoventilation, or abnormally slow breathing, presents after the rapid onset obesity. Symptoms of hypothalamic dysfunction and autonomic dysfunction present in a variety of ways, but in order for a diagnosis of ROHHAD they must be present in some form. Approximately 40% of patients will develop neuroendocrine tumors. There is also a possibility of behavioral disorders, but some children with ROHHAD have normal cognitive development and intelligence. Treatment plans for ROHHAD vary depending on each patient's symptoms. There is no cure, so treatment is geared toward managing the symptoms that each patient manifests. ROHHAD is fatal in 50-60% of cases when undiagnosed and untreated, due to cardiopulmonary arrest secondary to untreated hypoventilation. The earlier the disease is diagnosed and treatment starts, the better a child's prognosis is.  Signs & symptoms  = Rapid- onset Obesity = The rapid onset obesity aspect of ROHHAD is usually the first diagnostic indicator of the disease. Patients often present with hyperphagia and rapid weight gain. This rapid weight gain is defined as 20-30 pounds over a 6-12 month period, and typically occurs between the ages of 1.5 and 11. = Hypothalamic dysfunction = Hypothalamic dysfunction refers to the hypothalamus, which is a structure within the brain which participates in regulating the pituitary gland, autonomic nervous system, and endocrine system. Symptoms related to hypothalamic dysfunction may include abnormal sodium balance (hyponatremia or hypernatremia), high progestin levels, low cortisol levels, delayed or early-onset puberty, and low thyroid hormone. Patients will also often experience a decelerated growth rate throughout childhood. Sodium imbalance within the body can have severe symptoms and be potentially life-threatening if not controlled. Hyponatremia, or low sodium levels, can cause symptoms such as nausea, headache, seizures, or even cause patients to become comatose. Hypernatremia, or high sodium levels in the blood, can cause nausea, muscle weakness, altered mental status, or coma. Irregular temperature regulation and diabetes insipidus are also possible symptoms of hypothalamic dysfunction. ROHHAD patients develop these symptoms at varying ages and in varying numbers, but all patients will develop some symptoms of hypothalamic dysfunction. = Hypoventilation = Symptoms of hypoventilation and breathing malfunctions typically present after the rapid weight gain. Some patients may initially develop obstructive sleep apnea, which is common in obese children. Obstructive sleep apena is the most common form of sleep apnea, and causes breathing to abruptly stop and begin again during sleep. This is caused by throat muscles relaxing during sleep and blocking the airway, and is typically noticed as patients will snore loudly throughout the night. Every patient diagnosed with ROHHAD develops alveolar hypoventilation, regardless of whether they presented with sleep apnea. Alveolar hypoventilation is a condition in which patients have very low blood oxygen levels and shallow breathing. In healthy patients, when blood oxygen levels are low, the brain sends a signal to breathe and bring more oxygen to the blood. In ROHHAD patients, this reaction does not occur. This condition is usually only present during sleep, however in more severely affected patients shallow breathing may continue throughout the day. Hypoventilation can go unnoticed until cardiopulmonary arrest, which is why ROHHAD has the potential to be a fatal disease. Ventilatory support is required for patients during sleep, however it is only needed during waking hours for those most severely affected (about 50% of patients). = Autonomic Dysfunction = Autonomic dysfunction refers to the autonomic nervous system, which is responsible for regulating internal processes without conscious intervention. This may involve abnormalities in cardiac rhythm, temperature regulation, digestion, and eye movements. Not all ROHHAD patients will experience all of these symptoms, however they will have at least some of these issues. Examples of autonomic dysfunction include hyperthermia, hypothermia, pupillary dysfunction, strabismus, chronic constipation, and chronic diarrhea. = Neuroendocrine tumors = Approximately 40% of ROHHAD patients will develop tumors originating in the neural crest. These tumors are typically classified as ganglioneuroma or ganglioneuroblastomas. These tumors are not believed to significantly worsen or contribute to the prognosis of ROHHAD. It was suggested that ROHHAD be renamed ROHHADNET in order to include these tumors in the diagnostic criteria, but this has only been adopted for patients who develop these tumors. = Behavioral issues = Some children diagnosed with ROHHAD may also present with behavioral disorders and/or intellectual disability, however this is believed to be a result of low oxygen levels secondary to hypoventilation during childhood development. The later ROHHAD is diagnosed, the greater the risk for behavioral problems due to hypoxia from hypoventilation or during cardiopulmonary arrest. Cause The etiology of ROHHAD is currently unknown, and the condition is diagnosed based on a set of clinical criteria. It is believed that there may be a genetic component to ROHHAD, however there is no widely accepted gene linked to the disease. There has been one ROHHAD patient identified to have a mutation in the retinoic acid-induced 1(RAI1) gene through Whole Exome Sequencing, but there has been no otherwise proven link between the RAI1 gene and ROHHAD. It is believed that ROHHAD originates from a combination of genetic and environmental or immunological factors. As of yet, evidence of its etiology has not been discovered and is not well understood. In 2011, a case of monozygotic twins with divergent ROHHAD phenotypes was reported. One twin was affected with ROHHAD and developed symptoms, while the other twin developed normally. This report questioned the theory that ROHHAD is genetically inherited, and the authors suggest that the disease may have an autoimmune or epigenetic etiology.  Pathophysiology  The pathophysiology of ROHHAD is not currently known or understood.  Diagnosis  Rapid obesity is the first symptom to arise between the ages of 1.5 and 11. This is typically followed by hypoventilation, which if left untreated, can result in fatal cardiorespiratory arrest. This is why early diagnosis has proven to be imperative for ROHHAD patients, and it has been suggested that ROHHAD be considered in every isolated case of early rapid-onset obesity. Early diagnosis is also vital in maintaining electrolyte and hormone balances caused by hypothalamic dysfunction in order to promote healthy development and prevent further problems. As the symptoms of ROHHAD are so diverse and the condition is so rare, the disease is often misdiagnosed as Cushing's disease or Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome when it first presents in patients.  Prevention  As the cause of ROHHAD is unknown, there is no way to prevent onset of the disease.  Management  There is no known cure for ROHHAD, therefore treatment for the disease involves managing symptoms as they manifest in the patient. As not all ROHHAD patients develop the same symptoms, treatment plans vary between patients. Proper treatment of hypothalamic dysfunction and hypoventilation is the most critical aspect of ROHHAD management, as these symptoms have the greatest ability to cause death or behavioral problems if left uncontrolled. = Rapid onset obesity treatment = Attempting to control weight through diet and exercise can be exceedingly difficult in patients with ROHHAD due to a number of factors. Encouraging ROHHAD patients to exercise vigorously can be dangerous, as their breathing will not increase with exertion and this can cause hypoxia. Therefore, it is important for ROHHAD patients to exercise at a moderate intensity and for their oxygen levels to be monitored throughout. Typically, the obesity associated with ROHHAD is managed by preventing further weight gain as the child grows. = Hypothalamic dysfunction treatment = Treatment for hypothalamic dysfunction is tailored to each patient's needs, as there is no set of hypothalamic symptoms that all ROHHAD patients will manifest. All ROHHAD patients should be evaluated by a pediatric endocrinologist in order to determine a treatment plan for hypothalamic dysfunction. Patients may be given human growth hormone to treat stunted growth, or hormone replacement to treat any hormone deficiencies. Often patients are placed on a strict fluid regimen to treat for imbalances such as hyponatremia or hypernatremia. Patients who present with diabetes insipidus may also be treated with desmopressin, a synthetic replacement for anti-diuretic hormone. = Hypoventilation treatment = Every ROHHAD patient requires some form of ventilatory support, ranging from non-invasive BiPAP machines to tracheostomy procedures. Approximately 50% of ROHHAD patients will require ventilatory support day and night, whereas the other half only require night-time support. A bilevel positive airway pressure machine, or BiPAP, is a ventilator mask worn at night. The BiPAP pushes air into the lungs, therefore breathing for the patient. This is helpful for ROHHAD patients, as hypoventilation causes the mechanism that controls breathing in oxygen to slow and sometimes stop during sleep. A tracheostomy is the result of a surgical procedure to create a hole in the trachea in order to give access to ventilatory tubing. This procedure is performed to create an airway in situations when long term continuous use of a ventilator is needed. ROHHAD patients whose hypoventilation is so severe that they require support during the day and night will often undergo tracheostomies. = Autonomic dysfunction treatment = Treatment for autonomic dysfunction varies greatly on the severity of the dysfunction and the type. Many patients with ROHHAD experience strabismus, which is a weakness in eye muscle causing a \\"cross- eyed\\" effect. This can be treated with glasses, eye muscle exercises, or even surgery. ROHHAD patients also often experience bradycardia, or low heart rate. This may require a cardiac pacemaker be placed in order to regulate heartbeat. Gastrointestinal problems, such as constipation or diarrhea, are often treated on an as-needed basis with laxatives or dietary changes. It is also important that ambient temperatures are monitored in patients who have temperature regulation issues such as hyperthermia or hypothermia. = Neuroendocrine tumor treatment = Tumors of neural crest origin develop in approximately 40% of patients. These are typically ganglioneuromas or ganglioneuroblastomas. Neural crest tumors have the ability to form in multiple organs tissues throughout the body, typically in the chest or abdomen. It is therefore important for ROHHAD patients to have regular MRI and CT scans to screen for tumor growth. It is believed that these tumors do not significantly affect the prognosis for ROHHAD patients. Neuroendocrine tumors can arise 7‚Äì16 years after the initial onset of symptoms, therefore the name ROHHADNET (which includes these tumors) has not been widely accepted as it is believed this name would lead to further misdiagnosis. Treatment for these neuroendocrine tumors requires surgical removal, typically performed by a pediatric oncologist.  Prognosis  The most dangerous and fatal aspect of ROHHAD is the potential for cardiopulmonary arrest if hypoventilation is not found and treated in a timely manner. Approximately 50 to 60% of ROHHAD patients die due to cardiopulmonary arrest. The earlier symptoms are identified and patients are diagnosed, the more positive their outcomes are. It has been found that children who are diagnosed earlier in life and received treatment for hypoventilation and hypothalamic dysfunction (fluid imbalances, etc.) are less likely to develop behavioral issues or experience sudden cardiorespiratory arrest later in life.  Research  A group at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago has an international repository for patients with ROHHAD, which is available to researchers who are interested in the disease. As of June 2018, there are 3 clinical trials currently recruiting patients with ROHHAD being performed respectively at Lurie Children's Hospital, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, and Boston Children's Hospital.  Epidemiology  There have been at least 158 documented cases of ROHHAD worldwide.  History  ROHHAD was first described in 1965, and this was believed to be the first reported instance of hypoventilation presenting alongside hypothalamic dysfunction. ROHHAD had often been mistaken for congenital central hypoventilation syndrome, until the distinction was made by Ize-Ludlow et al. in 2007. These conditions are now permanently differentiated from one other, as patients with CCHS have mutations in the PHOX2B gene, whereas ROHHAD patients do not.  Society  The ROHHAD Association is an organization that aims to increase awareness for ROHHAD and promote research opportunities. They also organized fundraisers and events in order to give to researchers and promote visibility of ROHHAD. ROHHAD Fight Inc is a charity that was created for Marisa, a child who was diagnosed with ROHHAD, with the goal of raising awareness for the condition.

Located at Mol Chottor DU In March 1971, the Pakistani Armed Forces chief General Yahya Khan launched Operation Searchlight to curb the Bengali nationalist movement. As part of the operation, Pakistani forces attacked Dhaka University. Black night of 25 March 1971 The Pakistan Army convoy that attacked Dhaka University on 25 March 1971 included the 18th Panjab, 22nd FF, and 32nd Panjab regiments along with several battalions. Armed with heavy weapons such as tanks, automatic rifles, rocket launchers, heavy mortars, and light machine guns, they encircled Dhaka University from east (unit 41), from south (unit 88) and from north (unit 26).Witness To Surrender: by Siddiq Salik; Chapter: Operation Search Light-1 Massacre of teachers Martyred Intellectuals' Memorial at Rayerbazar, Dhaka. At the beginning of Operation Searchlight 10 teachers of Dhaka University were killed.Annual Report: Dhaka University 1971‚Äì72, Dr. Mafijullah Kabir Professor Fajllur Rahman and his two relatives were killed at building 23 situated at Nilkhet. Professor Rahman's wife escaped because she was not in the country. The Pakistan Army also attacked the house of Professor Anwar Pasha and Professor Rashidul Hassan (English Department). Both of them survived by hiding under beds, but were killed later in the war by the Al-Badr militia.Martyrs of Liberation. War at Jagannath Hall by Ratanlal Chakrabarti Professor Rafiqul Islam (Bangla Literature Department) was in building 24. Two wounded women with their children stayed in the entrance of the building for some time. When the Army came they found blood on the stairs and, surmising that other groups had done the massacre, left. This way Professor Rafiqul escaped. Later he stated that there had been one East Pakistani professor at that building, who left home before 25 March. All other non-Bengali families did the same without informing others. At Number 12 Fuller Road, the Army called on Sayed Ali Noki (Professor Social Science). They allowed him to go but killed Professor Abdul Muktadir (Geology) who was a resident of the same building. His body was found at Jahurul Huq Hall (then Iqbal Hall). He was buried at Paltan by his relatives. Professor K. M. Munim (English Literature), the house tutor of Salimullah Student Hall, was injured at Salimullah Hall. Professors A R Khan Khadim and Sharafat Ali of the Mathematics department were killed in Dhaka Hall. At Jagannath Hall they attacked teachers' residence and harassed Professor Mirja Huda (Economics) and Professor Mofijullah Kabir (History). When Jagannath Hall, a student dormitory for minority Hindu students, was attacked, university staff quarters were also affected. The Army killed Ex-Provost and famous professor of philosophy Dr Gobindra Chandra Dev with his Muslim adopted daughter's husband. They attacked and killed Dr. A.N.M. Manirujjaman, Professor of Statistics, along with his son and two relatives. Professor Jyotirmoy Guhathakurta the provost of Jagannath Hall was severely injured by the Army attack and died in the hospital later.Martyrs of Liberation War at Jagannath Hall by Ratanlal Chakrabarti Dormitory electrician Chitrabali and eyewitness Rajkumari Devi state that the doctors of Dhaka Medical College Hospital recognised Dr. Guhathakurta and buried him under a tree near Dhaka Medical College morgue. Assistant house tutor Anudoipayon Bhattacharja was also killed at that dorm.\\"Riffle Roti Awrat\\": Professor Anwar Pasha This information was taken from the novel \\"Riffel Roti Awrat\\" (Rifle, Bread, Women) by Professor Anwar Pasha who was later killed in December. Professor Pasha wrote this famous Bengali novel during the nine-month war period of 1971. Killing of students The Non-cooperation movement was organised under the banner of \\"Independent Bangladesh Students Movement Council\\" from Jahrul Hoque hall of Dhaka University. The first target of Operation Searchlight was this student hall. By 25 March all leaders of Chhatra League had left the hall. According to Professor Dr. K.M. Munim around 200 students were killed at this dorm. After 12 o'clock the army entered Jagannath Hall and initially attacked the hall with mortars and began non-stop firing. They entered through north and south gate and indiscriminately targeted students in each room, killing around 34 students at that time. Some students of Jagannath Hall were resident of Ramna Kali Bari. So, around 5‚Äì6 were killed there. Among them only the name of Ramonimohon Bhattacharjee is known. Many guests of students who were at those dorms were also killed, including Helal of Bhairab college, Babul Paul of Bajitpur College, Baddruddojha of Jagannath Hall, Jibon Sarkar, Mostaq, Bacchu and Amar of Netrokona. Archer Blood, the then-consul general of US at Dhaka, wrote in his book The Cruel Birth of Bangladesh, \\"Fire was started at Rokeya Hall (girls' dormitory) and, when the students tried to escape, the military started firing. From the conversation of military control room and army unit 88, a total of 300 students death was estimated.\\" Killing of staff The convoy that attacked Jahurul Huq hall initially killed EPR guards guarding the British Council building. They killed hall staff: Shirajul Huq, Ali Hossain, Shohorab Ali Gaji and Abdul Majid at the University teachers lounge. At Rokeya Hall, Chottor Ahmed Ali, Abdul Khalec, Nomi, Md. Solaiman Khan, Md. Nurul Islam, Md Hafizuddin, Md. Chunnu Miya were killed with their families. The convoy that attacked Shahid Minar and Bangla Academy also attacked Shahidullah hall, associated teachers' houses, and the home of Madhushudhan De. At building 11, Md. Sadeq, a teacher of University Laboratory School, was killed. The army left around 50 dead bodies, including some police officers (escaped from Rajarbag Police line), Bengali EPR members guarding President House and general people from Nilkhet Basti in the roof of university residential building-23. Between 25 and 27 March the Pakistan Army destroyed three temples: the Arts building-associated Guruduwara (Sikh), Ramna Kali Temple, and Ramna Shiva Temple (Hindu) opposite Shahid Minar. At least 85 people were intentionally murdered in Ramna Kali Temple before it was demolished. That night, staff of Philosophy department Khagen De, his son Motilal De, University staff Shushil Chandra De, Bodhiram, Dakkhuram, Vimroy, Moniram, Jaharlala Rajvar, Monvaran Roy, Plumber Rajvar and Shankar Kuri were killed. Attack at girls' dormitory Archer Blood, the then-consul general of US at Dhaka, wrote in his book The Cruel Birth of Bangladesh, \\"Fire was started at Rokeya Hall (girls' dormitory) and, when the students tried to escape, the military started firing... On 10 November 1971 some armed criminals attacked Rokeya Hall and kept 30 girls confined for two hours. They also attacked Provost House\\". In 1971 there were two strong military establishments near Rokeya hall, it was impossible to attack university Girls' Hostel without their knowledge for two hours. Excerpts from Genocide in Bangladesh by Kalyan Chaudhury, pp 157‚Äì158: > ...Some army officer raided Rokeya Hall on 7 October 1971.

Academic activities at 1971 Military Governor of East Pakistan Tikka Khan ordered department heads to join work from 21 April and the other teachers on 1 June, classes to start from 2 August. All the dormitories were cleaned to remove any signs of destruction to present a good educational environment at the university to the international community. All exams were postponed due to the national crisis. As the forces of war increased until September, attendance in the classes also increased. As many students had joined the Mukti Bahini (Liberation Forces), they blasted hand grenades near the university and quickly entered classes. This is why the Army failed to arrest anyone. Warning, arresting and punishment of teachers For known connections with liberation force, Tikka Khan issued arrest orders against many teachers and arrested some of them. Among them there were Dr. Abul Khayer, Dr. Rafiqul Islam, Dr. K. A. M. Salauddin, Ahsanul Hoque, Giasuddin Ahmed, Jahrul Hoque and M. Shahidullah. Military Governor of East Pakistan Tikka Khan officially warned Professor Munir Chowdhury, Professor Nilima Ibrahim, Professor Shirajul Islam Chowdhury, and Professor Enamul Hoque. Dr. Abu Muhammah Habibullah was terminated. Professor Abdur Razzak (political scientist and later National Professor of Bangladesh) was sentenced in absentia to 14 years in jail for supporting the Bengali Independence movement. Vice-chancellor during 1971 After March 1971 Dhaka University was without any vice-chancellor. In early March the vice-chancellor Justice Abu Sayed Chowdhury was at Geneva joining \\"United Nations Humanitarian Conference\\". In the middle of March he read news about death of two students. He immediately wrote his resignation letter to State's Education Secretary and fled to London leaving the conference. There he worked for Bangladeshi liberation.Role of Overseas: Bengalees in the Liberation Struggle of Bangladesh, Abdul Matin; After the independence of Bangladesh, he became the country's second president. Pakistan Army fetched Dr. Syed Sajjad Hussain the then VC of Rajshahi University in their convoy. He was made VC of Dhaka University. University teachers who helped the Pakistan government included Dr. Hasan Zaman, Dr. Mohar Ali, Dr. A. K. M. Abdur Rahman, Dr. Abdul Bari, Dr. Mukbul Hossain, Dr. Saifuddin Joarder. Collaborator and VC Dr. Syed Sajjad Hussain, Dr. Hasan Zaman and Dr. Mohar Ali were arrested after the liberation of Bangladesh and exiled.Dainik Bangla:3 October 1971 Massacre on 14 December 1971 In December, it became clear to the Pakistan government that it would lose the war. When Dhaka University reopened on 2 July 1971, teachers who collaborated with the Pakistani army gathered at Nawab Abdul Gani Road to build up a list of intellectuals who supported the Independence movement. Until then, the Pakistan Army secretly trained a group of Pakistan-supporting madrasa, college and university students. This group was named Al Badar. At the verge of the December war Al-Badar members came out and selectively killed Bengali professors, doctors, engineers and many other intellectuals. Many of those killed were teachers of Dhaka University.

The president represents the nation in international relations, administers the foreign political activity of the state, conducts negotiations and concludes international treaties. The president is directly elected by the citizens of Ukraine for a five-year term of office (whether the presidential election is early or scheduled), limited to two terms consecutively. The president's official residence is the Mariyinsky Palace, located in the Pechersk district of the capital Kyiv. Other official residences include the House with Chimaeras and the House of the Weeping Widow, which are used for official visits by foreign representatives. The Presidential Administration of Ukraine, unofficially known as \\"Bankova\\" in reference to the street it is located on, serves as the presidential administration, advising the president in the domestic, foreign and legal matters. Since the office's establishment on 5 July 1991, there have been six presidents of Ukraine. Leonid Kravchuk was the inaugural president, serving three years from 1991 until his resignation in 1994. Leonid Kuchma was the only president to have served two consecutive terms in office. Viktor Yushchenko, Petro Poroshenko and Viktor Yanukovych served one term, with the latter being replaced by acting president Oleksandr Turchynov, who then also served as Chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament, on 21 February 2014. Oleksandr Turchynov was the only acting president in Ukraine's modern history. Unlike in the US, where the vice president immediately receives all powers of the presidency upon assumption of the presidential office, in Ukraine the powers of an acting president are severely limited. On 18 June 2015, Yanukovych was officially deprived of the title of president of Ukraine.Published law deprives Yanukovych of presidential rank , UNIAN (17 June 2015) The Government of Ukraine utilizes a semi-presidential system in which the roles of the head of state and head of government are separate, thus the president of Ukraine is not the nation's head of government.Volunteer battalion Azov members and former members create National Corps political party , Interfax-Ukraine (14 October 2016) The prime minister serves as the head of government,Economic Interdependence in Ukrainian-Russian Relations by Paul J. D'Anieri, State University of New York Press, 1999, (page 187) a role currently filled by Denys Shmyhal who took office in March 2020. The current president is Volodymyr Zelensky, who took the oath of office on 20 May 2019. Overview The president is also the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Army, and heads the National Security and Defense Council, which advises the president, co-ordinates and controls executive power in the sphere of national security and defense. According to the Constitution of Ukraine, the president is the guarantor of the state's sovereignty, territorial indivisibility, the observance of the Constitution of Ukraine and human and citizens' rights and freedoms. As with the separation of powers, the president has checks on the authority of parliament and the judicial system. For instance, any law passed by the parliament can be vetoed by the president; however, parliament can override his veto with a 2/3 constitutional majority vote. The president has limited authority to disband the Verkhovna Rada (parliament), and nominates candidates for the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Defense in the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers. Six out of eighteen of the Constitutional Court judges are appointed by the president. Decisions of the president are subject to review by Ukraine's courts with the Constitutional Court having the sole authority and power to declare decrees of the president unconstitutional. While in office, the president enjoys the right of immunity. Ukrainian presidents are frequently asked by individual citizens for help in solving their personal problems (sometimes successfully); in 2012, (then) president Yanukovych received about 10,000 to 12,000 letters from people every month. By-passing local governments is an ages-old practice in Ukraine. History =Early leadership= Prior to the formation of the modern Ukrainian presidency, the previous Ukrainian head of state office was officially established in exile by Andriy Livytskyi. At first the de facto leader of nation was the president of the Central Rada at early years of the Ukrainian People's Republic, while the highest governing body was the General Secretariat headed by its chairman. With the proclamation of the last universal of the UPR dated 25 January 1918 due to a military aggression, the Central Rada (council) of the UPR proclaimed its independence from the Russia. On 29 April 1918, the Rada elected Mykhailo Hrushevskyi as the first president of the Central Rada of the Ukrainian People's Republic, in effect making him the de facto leader of the republic. Although a rather widespread misconception, the state leadership position title varied and none of them had an official \\"presidential\\" title. On 29 April 1918 the Central Rada was arrested and liquidated during a coup d'√©tat initiated by the local German administration to install Hetman Pavlo Skoropadsky who barely spoke a word of the Ukrainian language. In November of the same year the directorate government of the UPR was established as the opposition movement to the Skoropadsky's regime. The Ukrainian People's Republic was soon re-established in December 1918 with Volodymyr Vynnychenko as the Directorate's chairman, serving as the republic's de facto second \\"president\\" from 19 December 1918 to 10 February 1919. Although really the Directorate was the temporary governing body until the new Ukrainian Constituent Assembly would elect its president. Symon Petliura assumed the representation of the state after Vynnychenko's resignation on 11 February 1919 and until Petlyura's assassination in Paris on 25 May 1926.

Upon the assassination of Petliura, the control over the state affairs were transferred to the former Prime Minister Andriy Livytskyi who in 1948 created the office of the president of Ukraine. Livytskyi served as the first president (in exile) until January 1954. Stepan Vytvytskyi served after Livytskyi from January 1954 until his death on 9 October 1965. Following Vytvytskyi's death, Ivan Bahrianyi temporarily carried out the presidential authority until the third president-in-exile Mykola Livytskyi (son of the first president-in-exile) was sworn into office. Livytskyi served from 1967 until his death in December 1989. Mykola Plaviuk was the last president-in- exile (and the fourth), serving from December 1989 until his resignation on 22 August 1992 when he ceremonially gave in his presidential authority and state symbols to the newly elected Ukrainian president Leonid Kravchuk at his inauguration ceremony. In his declaration, it is stated that the current Ukrainian state is the legal successor following the state traditions of the Ukrainian People's Republic, establishing the continuity of the republic. Viktor Yanukovych has claimed to be the legitimate president of Ukraine stating that the events of the 2014 Ukrainian Revolution amounted to a coup and that the impeachment process has not been properly carried out. On 3 October 2014, a Ukrainian official said that Viktor Yanukovych and other former top officials have obtained Russian citizenship in a \\"secret decree\\" signed by Vladimir Putin. If this actually turned out to be true, it would suggest that Yanukovich had given up his claims for presidency as Ukrainian law does not allow for dual citizenship. However, this would not negate the claim that the change of government in March 2014 was a political coup d'√©tat. =Modern presidency= The modern Ukrainian presidency was established on 5 July 1991 by the Verkhovna Rada of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, which formed the office of \\"president of the Ukrainian SSR\\" (). During the transitional period until the presidential elections, the Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada (then held by Leonid Kravchuk) was empowered with a presidential authority. With the proclamation of Ukrainian independence from the Soviet Union, the office's official title was changed to \\"President of Ukraine\\" on 24 August. In the current Constitution, the Ukrainian presidency is defined in Chapter V, Articles 102‚Äì112. The first Ukrainian president Leonid Kravchuk (left) along with other heads of states of the newly formed Commonwealth of Independent States in 1991. So far, five presidential elections have been conducted. The first election in 1991 was held at the same time as Ukrainians voted to support the Declaration of Independence in the independence referendum. Leonid Kravchuk was elected Ukraine's first president on 1 December 1991. He was elected by a record number of voters with over 19.5 million who wanted him to see as the leader of the state. That number has not been beaten yet. His major opponents were the leader of Rukh Vyacheslav Chornovil and the author of the Declaration of Independence. President Kravchuk remained in office until he resigned as part of a political compromise. A snap election was held in 1994, which was won by Ukraine's former Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma. Kuchma was re-elected for a second term of office in 1999. The 2004 presidential election was marked by controversy with allegations of electoral fraud in the conduct of the second round runoff ballot between opposition candidate Viktor Yushchenko and the government- backed candidate and former Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych. After mass nationwide protests, colloquially known as the \\"Orange Revolution,\\" a new election was held on 26 December 2004 in which Victor Yushchenko was declared the winner with 52% of the vote and was subsequently sworn into office on 23 January 2005. Victor Yanukovych again served as Prime Minister. The 2010 election took place on 17 January, with a run-off on 7 February due to a 13 May Constitutional Court ruling striking down 25 October date that the parliament called in April 2009. As a result of this election Viktor Yanukovych was elected the fourth modern president of Ukraine. After Viktor Yanukovych was removed from power in early 2014 as a result of the 2014 Ukrainian revolution the chairman of parliament Oleksandr Turchynov was appointed to the role of acting president by the Verkhovna Rada in accordance with article 112 of the Constitution of Ukraine. Oleksandr Turchynov served as the acting president from 23 February until 7 June 2014 and was the only person in Ukrainian history to serve in the role. The acting president of Ukraine lacks many of the executive powers of a president and is only meant to serve for a short time before a new election can take place. During his tenure Oleksandr Turchynov was addressed as \\"acting president\\" by other Ukrainian politicians and the media. The 2014 election took place on 25 May, with businessman Petro Poroshenko winning over 54 percent of the vote; Yulia Tymoshenko was the runner up with around 13 percent. Poroshenko was sworn in as president on 7 June 2014. On 18 June 2015 Yanukovych was officially deprived of the title of President of Ukraine. The 2019 election took place on 31 March, with a run-off on 21 April. As a result of this election, Volodymyr Zelensky, a former actor and comedian with no prior political experience has become the sixth President of Ukraine, scoring a record 73.22% of the popular vote in the run-off against the incumbent Petro Poroshenko. The Government of Ukraine is based on a semi presidential system. The president of Ukraine is the head of state while the prime minister is the head of government with the current prime minister being Denys Shmyhal. Ukraine is somewhat unusual in that while many countries use a similar system typically the role of one leader is relegated to being ceremonial, in Ukraine however both the prime minister and the president have great power and responsibility assigned to their roles. Because the president of Ukraine must approve the appointment of the prime minister the post of president is generally thought of as the more powerful role. Election and eligibility Results of the first round by electoral district: The Ukrainian president is elected by direct popular vote by Ukrainian citizens who are 18 years and over. The president is elected for a 5-year term of office, limited to two terms consecutively. Ukraine's electoral law provides for a two-round electoral system to elect the president; a candidate must win an absolute majority of all votes cast. If no candidate obtains an absolute majority in the first round of voting then the two highest polling candidates contest a run-off second ballot.Q&A;: Ukraine presidential election , BBC News (7 February 2010) According to Chapter V, Article 103 of the Constitution, to be elected president a candidate must be a Ukrainian citizen who has attained the age of 35, has the right to vote, and has resided in the country for the past 10 yearsVitali Klitschko says intends to run for president in Ukraine , Interfax-Ukraine (24 October 2013) Parliament passes law that could prevent Klitschko from running for president , Interfax-Ukraine (24 October 2013) and has full command of the Ukrainian state language.

The river, and several other features in the area, are named after the trumpeter swans found in the region. Description The river is located in the Swan Lake drainage basin. It arises in the northwest corner of the basin in the Porcupine Hills and flows generally south, contained in a large valley two miles (3 km) wide and deep, until it nears Pelly, Saskatchewan. Here it turns northeast, collecting tributary streams off the north escarpment of the Duck Mountains, and terminates at Swan Lake. Slopes on the south escarpment of the Porcupine Hills average . The elevation of the Swan River plain at Norquay, Saskatchewan is above sea level, and at Swan Lake it is 850 feet (260 m) above sea level, with an average slope of . The Swan River has a drainage area of , a maximum annual discharge of (1922), and a maximum daily discharge of (1995). Major tributaries include Maloneck Creek and Spruce Creek, (which originate in the Swan River plain), and Bear Head Creek, Roaring River, the West and East Favel Rivers, and the Sinclair River, (which originate in the Duck Mountains). Communities located on the river include Swan River and Lenswood. Communities located on its tributaries include Norquay (on Spruce Creek), and Minitonas (on the East Favel River).

The problem is known under several names, including the Margulis napkin problem, suggesting it is due to Grigory Margulis, and the Arnold's rouble problem referring to Vladimir Arnold and the folding of a Russian ruble bank note. Some versions of the problem were solved by Robert J. Lang, Svetlana Krat, Alexey S. Tarasov, and Ivan Yaschenko. One form of the problem remains open.  Formulations  There are several way to define the notion of folding, giving different interpretations. By convention, the napkin is always a unit square. = Folding along a straight line = Considering the folding as a reflection along a line that reflects all the layers of the napkin, the perimeter is always non-increasing, thus never exceeding 4. By considering more general foldings that possibly reflects only a single layer of the napkin (in this case, each folding is a reflection of a connected component of folded napkin on one side of a straight line), it still open if a sequence of these foldings can increase the perimeter. In other words, it still unknown if exists a solution that can be folded using some combination of mountain folds, valley folds, reverse folds, and/or sink folds (with all folds in the latter two cases being formed along a single line). Also unknown, of course, is whether such a fold would be possible using the more-restrictive pureland origami. = Folding without stretching = One can ask for a realizable construction within the constraints of rigid origami where the napkin is never stretched whilst being folded. In 2004 A. Tarasov showed that such constructions can indeed be obtained. This can be considered a complete solution to the original problem. = Where only the result matters = One can ask whether there exists a folded planar napkin (without regard as to how it was folded into that shape). Robert J. Lang showed in 1997 that several classical origami constructions give rise to an easy solution. In fact, Lang showed that the perimeter can be made as large as desired by making the construction more complicated, while still resulting in a flat folded solution. However his constructions are not necessarily rigid origami because of their use of sink folds and related forms. Although no stretching is needed in sink and unsink folds, it is often (though not always) necessary to curve facets and/or sweep one or more creases continuously through the paper in intermediate steps before obtaining a flat result. Whether a general rigidly foldable solution exists based on sink folds is an open problem. In 1998, I. Yaschenko constructed a 3D folding with projection onto a plane which has a bigger perimeter. This indicated to mathematicians that there was probably a flat folded solution to the problem. The same conclusion was made by Svetlana Krat.S. Krat, Approximation Problems in Length Geometry, Ph.D. thesis, Pennsylvania State University, 2005 Her approach is different, she gives very simple construction of a \\"rumpling\\" which increase perimeter and then proves that any \\"rumpling\\" can be arbitrarily well approximated by a \\"folding\\". In essence she shows that the precise details of the how to do the folds don't matter much if stretching is allowed in intermediate steps.  Solutions  =Lang's solutions= Crease pattern for Lang's sea urchin-like solution with N = 5 Lang devised two different solutions. Both involved sinking flaps and so were not necessarily rigidly foldable. The simplest was based on the origami bird base and gave a solution with a perimeter of about 4.12 compared to the original perimeter of 4. The second solution can be used to make a figure with a perimeter as large as desired. He divides the square into a large number of smaller squares and employs the 'sea urchin' type origami construction described in his 1990 book, Origami Sea Life. The crease pattern shown is the n = 5 case and can be used to produce a flat figure with 25 flaps, one for each of the large circles, and sinking is used to thin them. When very thin the 25 arms will give a 25 pointed star with a small center and a perimeter approaching N2/(N ‚àí 1). In the case of N = 5 this is about 6.25, and the total length goes up approximately as N.  History  Arnold states in his book that he formulated the problem in 1956, but the formulation was left intentionally vague. He called it 'the rumpled rouble problem', and it was the first of many interesting problems he set at seminars in Moscow over 40 years. In the West, it became known as Margulis napkin problem after Jim Propp's newsgroup posting in 1996. Despite attention, it received folklore status and its origin is often referred as \\"unknown\\".

Over time, they were under the suzerainty of the Sassanid Empire, the Hephthalite Empire, the G√∂kt√ºrk Khaganate, the Umayyad Caliphate and the Samanid Empire. Sources Al-Biruni, the native Khwarezmian scholar, mentions twenty-two members of the Afrighid dynasty for a total span of 690 years with an average rule of 31 years for each ruler.Encyclopedia Iranica, ‚ÄúƒÄL-E AFRƒ™·∏† (Afrighid dynasty)‚Äù by C. E. Bosworth According to him, the Afrighids ruled from 305 AD, through the Arab conquests under Qotayba b. Moslem in 93/712, and up to their overthrow in 385/995 by the rising rival family of Ma'munids. The main source on the Afrighids prior to Islam is also Al-Biruni. Part of the reason for the gap in information about this dynasty is mentioned by Al-Biruni. Al-Biruni states: Etymology It has been suggested that 'Afrigh' is the Arabicized of 'Abriz' in Persian (ÿ¢ÿ®ÿ±€åÿ≤ where water flows, a reference to the geography of Khwarazm and its abundant water). However, Dr. Parviz Azkai, in his annotations on Al-Biruni's Chronology of Ancient Nations, explains that this is a popular etymology. Azkai explains that Afrigh was originally Ap-Air-ig meaning from the Aryan descent: ap or af is the same in 'afrashtan' (Persian: ÿßŸÅÿ±ÿßÿ¥ÿ™ŸÜ) to raise; air is the root meaning Aryan as seen in Iraj, and Eran/Iran (land of Aryan); and -ig is the suffix of relation in Iranian languages and cognate to '-ic' in English or '-ique' in French. Kingdom The fortress of Ayaz Kala 2 was built during the Afrighids period, in the 6th to 8th century AD. The ancient Iranian kingdom of Khwarazm had been ruled until 995 by the old established line of Afrighids of Kath. Khwarazm was the well irrigated and rich agricultural region of lower Oxus. Surrounded on all sides by steppe land and desert, it was geographically isolated from other areas of civilization. This isolation allowed it to maintain a separate distinctive Iranian language and culture. Khwarazm was one of the early areas of Iranian civilization, and the local Khwarezmian historian, Al-Biruni traces civilization there beyond the first millennium BC. Before the 8th century, there had only been few ineffectual Arab raids on the fringes of Khwarezm from the directions of Khorasan and Transoxania. But in 712 AD, Qutayba ibn Muslim was able to intervene in a civil war between the Afrighid Shah and his brother Khorrazad. Two Arab invasions lead to much destruction as Al-Biruni notes. Once the Arabs withdrew from their raid, the Shahs recovered power in Khwarezm and they continued to adhere to their ancestral faith, which according to Al-Biruni was Zoroastrianism. The local shahs continued to ally with local Iranian princes, Soghdian merchants and even Turks and Chinese in order to resist the Arabs. Nana. Dated 658 AD, British Museum.British Museum Collection Ossuary Lid, Tok-Kala Necropolis, Alabaster. 7th-8th century CE It thus came vaguely under Muslim suzerainty, but it was not until the end of the 8th century or the beginning of the 9th century that an Afrighid was first converted to Islam appearing with the popular convert's name of ‚ÄòAbdallah (slave of God). In the course of the 10th century, the local family of the Ma'munids who were based in Gurganj, on the left bank of the Oxus grew in economic and political importance due to trade caravans. In 995, they violently overthrew the Afrighids of Kath and themselves assumed the traditional title of the Khwarazm Shah. Briefly, the area was under Samanid suzerainty, before it passed to Mahmud of Ghazna. From then on, Turco-Mongolian invasions and long rule by Turco-Mongol dynasties supplanted the Iranian character of the region although the title of Khwarizm Shah was maintained well up to the 15th century. Religion It is generally agreed that the Afrighids were Zoroastrians until the reign of Abdallah ibn Torkasbatha during the 9th century. However, their Zoroastrian beliefs differed from those in Iran and were a mix between a local form of Khwarazmian Zoroastrianism and paganism. The Khwarazmians, like their Sogdian relatives, also made rituals and sacrifices dedicated to the Iranian mythological hero Siyavash whom they appeared to worship, according to Tolstov, with regards to vegetation. Names of rulers Only consonants of the pre-Islamic names are known with long vowels, since in Arabic script, the short vowels are not written and diacritic signs are used to clarify when required. After the conversion of 'Abdallah, all the names except possibly 'Eraq are Arabic and their pronunciation is known. Unfortunately, the manuscripts that have also come down have also suffered some corruption due to scribal errors, since the Khwarezmian names were incomprehensible for most non-natives. Al-Biruni himself utilizes the extra letters of Khwarezmian which were not used in Arabic writings. More is known about the dynasty in the Islamic era after the beginning of the 8th century and their conversion to Islam. Name of the rulers given by the native Khwarezmian speaker Al-Biruni, and modern scholars.L. Massignon, \\"Al-Biruni et la valeur internationale de la science arabe\\" in Al-Biruni Commemoration Volume, (Calcutta, 1951). pp 217-219. excerpt: In a celebrated preface to the book of Drugs, Biruni says: It is through the Arabic language that the sciences have been transmitted by means of translations from all parts of the world. They have been enhanced by the translation into the Arabic language and have as a result insinuated themselves into men's hearts, and the beauty of this language has commingled with these sciences in our veins and arteries. And if it is true that in all nations one likes to adorn oneself by using the language to which one has remained loyal, having become accustomed to using it with friends and companions according to need, I must judge for myself that in my native Khwarezmian, science has as much as chance of becoming perpetuated as a camel has of facing Kaaba.

He played college football on the undefeated national champion 1947 and 1948 Michigan Wolverines football teams and was the Most Valuable Player on the 1949 team. He later served as a jet fighter pilot in the Korean War where he received the Distinguished Flying Cross. He turned down an opportunity to play professional football to join his father in the automobile business. Over the next 50 years, Kempthorn built a series of automobile dealerships in Canton, Ohio.https://www.indeonline.com/news/20190209/updated-war-hero-civic-leader- dick-kempthorn-dieshttps://www.lamiellfuneralhome.com/obituaries/Richard-J- Kempthorn?obId=4143602#/obituaryInfo Youth Kempthorn is a native of Canton, Ohio. He played high school football for Canton McKinley High School. Kempthorn was a starter at quarterback and linebacker in high school, and in two years of varsity football, his teams went 16-2-2 and won a state championship. College football =Miami University and the Merchant Marine= After graduating from high school, he was admitted to the United States Merchant Marine Academy in San Mateo, California. Before starting at the Academy, Kempthorn attended the Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, where he played in six football games for the Redskins under Coach Sid Gillman. After several weeks of training at the Merchant Marine Academy, Kempthorn was assigned to serve as an engine cadet on the crew of the cargo ship, USS Wild Hunter, which participated in the invasion of the Philippines. =Transfer to Michigan= After the end of World War II, Kempthorn visited Michigan and decided to transfer to Michigan rather than returning to complete his studies at the Merchant Marine Academy. Unable to play in 1946 due to the transfer rule, Kempthorn played with Coach Wally Weber's team of reserve players and ineligibles. When Kempthorn laid out two varsity players in a scrimmage, Coach Fritz Crisler reportedly told Weber to \\"get that wild man out of there.\\" Weber said, \\"He's the roughest young man we've had around here since the late Bill Hewitt. He's strewn the landscape with football humanity.\\" Kempthorn first played with the Wolverines during 1947 spring practice. At that time, Kempthorn impressed Michigan's coaches with his drive on offense and hard tackling on defense; he was described as \\"rugged and beautifully proportioned but green and crude.\\" Even before he played a regular season game, Kempthorn was tagged as \\"one of the finest fullbacks ever to enroll at Michigan.\\" =1947 season= Kempthorn joined a 1947 Michigan football team that was loaded with talent returning from the war. The team went undefeated in the regular season, beat USC 49-0 in the 1948 Rose Bowl game, outscored its opponents 394-53 and was selected by the ESPN Big Ten College Football Encyclopedia as the best team in the history of Michigan football. The 1947 team is also remembered as the first team fully to embrace the concept of defensive and offensive specialization. Previously, most players had played their positions on both offense and defense. But in 1947, Coach Fritz Crisler established separate offensive and defensive squads. At the outset of the season, Kempthorn won the starting job at fullback. Kempthorn scored a touchdown on his second carry in the 1947 season opener, a 55-0 win against Michigan State. In only his third game for Michigan, against Pittsburgh, Kempthorn sustained a knee injury. Kempthorn missed three games due to the knee injury and returned to star on defense against Indiana. Kempthorn was back on the injury list after the Indiana game and later recalled that, after the knee injury, he was unable to execute the spinning movement required of a back in the single wing offense. In the 1948 Rose Bowl, USC penetrated deep into Michigan's territory only once, and Kempthorn ended that drive with an interception on the 11-yard line. =1948 season= After missing the opening game of the 1948 season with a pulled muscle, Kempthorn did not see much action on offense but won respect for his play at linebacker with the defensive unit. In the second game of the season, Kempthorn stood out on defense, leading a defensive stand in which the Wolverines stopped the Oregon on four straight plays from inside the five-yard line. The United Press called linebackers Kempthorn and Dan Dworsky the \\"defensive mainstays\\" of a defense that gave up only 44 points in the 1948 season. The 1948 team finished 8-0 and was ranked No. 1 in the final Associated Press poll. =1949 season= During his senior season in 1949, Kempthorn was used chiefly as a linebacker on the defensive squad, although he also saw considerable offensive duty as a fullback. After a victory of Minnesota, the Associated Press published a profile of Kempthorn describing him as follows > Dick Kempthorn, Michigan's touch blond fullback, is good at both offense and > defense. That's on the record book and none can dispute it. But he'll go > down in the fan's book as a line backer deluxe, a role he played with > magnificent effect as Michigan went unbeaten in 1947-48. ... His vicious > tackling was the keynote of the inspired Michigan line that made a shambles > of a Minnesota team that was rated one of the best in years. After the 1949 season, the Michigan players voted to award the Most Valuable Player award to Kempthorn. The 1950 Michiganensian Yearbook said of Kempthorn > Dick Kempthorn - Destined to go down in football history as one of the > finest line backers ever to come from the Mid-West, Dick Kempthorn wound up > his grid career with a resounding pat on the back from his teammates who > voted him the well-deserved honor of 'Most Valuable Player.' Seeing only > limited offensive action 'the Killer' was generally overlooked by All- > American selectors, an omission disputed by those who had witnessed > explosive Kempthorn tackles on play after play of every Wolverine contest. Kempthorn was selected to play on three College All-Star teams while playing at Michigan from 1947-1949. =Kempthorn's gloves in the 1950 \\"Snow Bowl\\"= Kempthorn stayed on briefly to help Bennie Oosterbaan as an assistant backfield coach in 1950. That fall, his pigskin gloves played a key role in the infamous \\"Snow Bowl\\" victory over Ohio State. The game was played in a blizzard that shut down both offenses, and the punting game became the key. Michigan won the game, 9-3, despite never getting a first down. The teams punted 45 times, sometimes on first down. The strategy was based on the weather in that both teams felt it better to have the ball in the hands of their opponents near the end zone and hope for a fumble of the slippery ball. In the end, Michigan won with a touchdown scored after blocking a punt. Chuck Ortmann was Michigan's punter, and his fingers were becoming numb in the freezing weather. Kempthorn had purchased a new pair of pigskin gloves for the Ohio trip and gave them to Ortmann early in the game when Ortmann complained that his hands were getting numb. Ortmann later joked that they \\"were not masculine gloves but dainty tight fitting little numbers.\\" But the gloves gave Ortmann a perfect grip on the ball. Ortmann noted that even though the gloves became soaked, \\"the wet ball stuck to them like glue.\\" It was Ortmann's error- free punting that won the game for the Wolverines. Kempthorn's gloves, described in may articles as formal \\"junior prom\\" gloves, were credited with having won Michigan the game and a trip to the Rose Bowl. Later years =Rejection of professional football= Kempthorn was the 123rd pick in the 1948 NFL Draft (by the Philadelphia Eagles) and the second round pick of the Cleveland Browns in the 1949 AAFC Secret Draft. However, Kempthorn bypassed professional football and instead opted to return to Canton, Ohio to join his father's Dodge-Plymouth automobile dealership. One sports columnist wrote the following about Kempthorn's decision > Dick Kempthorn, Michigan's great linebacker who could name his own price in > pro football, says he wants no part of pro ball. He'll work for his father, > who is in the automotive business in Canton, Ohio, after graduation. Draft > rights for Kempthorn, rated the deadliest tackler Michigan has produced in > almost three decades, are held by the Cleveland Browns and Philadelphia > Eagles. =Heroism in the Korean War= Kempthorn received the Distinguished Flying Cross When the Korean War broke out, Kempthorn joined the United States Air Force and spent three years as a pilot. He flew more than 100 missions as a jet fighter pilot and received the Distinguished Flying Cross for bravery. In March 1953, Kempthorn was recognized for heroism after he rescued fellow pilot, Henry Rock, from a burning fighter plane in Japan. After Rock's plane crashed on the runway, Kempthorn sprinted 200 yards to the crash scene, jumped on the wing and ripped loose the bullet-proof glass canopy. With Rock trapped by the gunsight as flames burned Rock's face and hands, Kempthorn took the gunsight in his bare hands and broke off the mounting. Shortly after Rock was freed, the plane exploded. In June 1953, three months after Kempthorn was cited for bravery, the 1947 team held a five-year reunion. Kempthorn's former teammates and Coach Crisler all signed a football and sent it to him in Korea. Newspapers covered the long-distance gift, and one reporter wrote > Lt. Richard Kempthorn, jet fighter pilot with the army airforce in Korea, > doesn't know it yet but he's about to receive a present that he'll > undoubtedly cherish the rest of his life. Mighty Dick, one of the great > linebackers in football history, was one of the line-wrecking crew of > Michigan's championship 1947-48 teams, and now he's doing an even finer job > as a fighter pilot with more than 60 missions behind him in Korea. =Kempthorn Automall in Canton= In 1953, Kempthorn returned to Canton, Ohio where he returned to work in his father's car dealership. Cleveland Browns Coach Paul Brown tried to persuade Kempthorn to play professional football, but Kempthorn decided to work for his father. Kempthorn bought the business from his father in 1964 and expanded it from a Dodge-Plymouth dealership into a business called \\"Dick Kempthorn Car Sales\\" selling multiple brands of automobiles and trucks. As of 2004, the 77-year-old Kempthorn was still working at the car dealership with his three children. The business has now expanded into the Kempthorn Auto Mall in Canton, which includes Kempthorn- owned dealerships for Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, Mazda, Volkswagen, and Jaguar.

Pep was a brand of whole-wheat breakfast cereal produced by the Kellogg Company, and introduced in 1923. Pep was a long-running rival to Wheaties, and also the sponsor of Mutual Radio's The Adventures of Superman radio series. One of Pep's advertising slogans was \\"the Sunshine cereal\\". Pep became one of the first \\"fortified\\" cereals, with an infusion of vitamins, beginning in the 1930s. Extensive advertising, from print advertisements to sponsorship of The Adventures of Superman, and the television and radio shows of Tom Corbett-- Space Cadet helped keep the brand in the public's (particularly children's) consciousness. Pep was included in \\"variety packs\\" of serving-sized boxes of Kellogg's cereals. The cereal's \\"mildly laxative\\" property was routinely mentioned in print ads. Pep faded from popularity as public tastes changed, and the brand was discontinued in the late 1970s. In-package prizes In 1945, Kellogg inserted a prize in the form of pinback buttons into each box of Pep cereal. Pep pins included U.S. Army squadrons as well as characters from newspaper comics. There were five series of comics characters, with 18 different buttons in each set. This would make 90 buttons in the complete set, but the Superman button appeared in all five sets, because of the close association between Kellogg's Pep and the Adventures of Superman radio show. This makes a total of 86 unique comic buttons in the set. Mint condition Pep pins, as with prizes from many cereal brands, have become sought-after collectables.

Besides the immediate impact on the victims and their families, the attacks caused widespread anger among the Indian public, and condemnations from countries throughout the world. The immediate impact was felt on Mumbai and Maharashtra state, and throughout urban India. There were also after-effects on the Indian government, centre-state relations within India, Indo-Pakistani relations, domestic impact within Pakistan, the United States's relationships with both countries, the US-led NATO war in Afghanistan, and on the Global War on Terror. There was also impact on the region of Kashmir and this also led to the 2010 Kashmir Unrest. Office-workers at Ballard Estate reacting to rumours of shooting at Victoria Terminus, three minutes away from the Estate Immediate impact =Impact on the attack locations= Bullet marks left at Cafe Leopold The Leopold Cafe opened its doors to customers just four days after the attacks. The owners wanted to repair the damaged parts of the cafe, while retaining some of the damaged pieces as a tribute to those who lost their lives in the attacks. Security forces handed back control of the Taj Mahal Hotel to the Taj group on 1 December 2008, and work on its repairs began that same day. Celebrated artist M.F. Hussain, whose art was destroyed in the attacks, has agreed to replace the paintings with a series that will condemn the attack. Hussain plans this series as a tribute to the staff of the hotel, who laid down their lives to save other people. Control of the Trident has already been handed back to the management, while the Oberoi will take 3‚Äì4 months to resume operations. Both the Taj and Trident hotels reopened on 21 December 2008. Nariman House will also reopen soon, but it is not known exactly when. Several young Chabad couples from all over the world have stepped forward to move to Mumbai and continue the movement's work. =Impact on Mumbai= Citizens outside the Taj Mahal Palace demanding government action In the aftermath of the November 2008 Mumbai attacks, all schools and colleges, and most offices were closed. The Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange remained closed on 27 November 2008. Shooting of Bollywood films and TV series had also been halted in the city. Many international airlines temporarily discontinued operations to Mumbai, in the interest of passenger and crew safety. The Indian Cricket League's ongoing tournament in Ahmedabad was canceled. The two remaining One Day Internationals of the seven match series between the visiting England cricket team and India were cancelled. The visiting team flew home, but returned to continue the test series. However, the venue of the second India- England test match, scheduled on 19‚Äì23 December, was shifted from Mumbai to Chennai. The inaugural Twenty20 Champions League, scheduled from 3 to 10 December, Mumbai being one of the host cities, was postponed. The attacks have brought into significance the issue of 379 Indian boats and 336 fishermen apprehended by the Pakistan marine agency, for entering their waters. Nearly 200 of the boats have reportedly been auctioned, now recognised as a national security issue for India. On 28 November, Pakistan released 99 fishermen who were apprehended, as part of confidence building measures with India. There were threats to blow up ITC Fortune Hotel in Navi Mumbai, after Mumbai police received a bomb threat from terrorists. Rumours about further shootings at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus were doing the rounds in Mumbai on 28 November, and were widely reported by the news channels. The Railway Police denied these rumours, but stopped trains approaching CST. =Maharashtra state government= After seeing the disparity between the quality of helmets and bulletproof vests used by NSG commandos and the police, the Police Commissioner of Pune, Satyapal Singh, said his police officers needed the same quality equipment as used by the NSG to reduce deaths and improve performance. Maharashtra government has planned to buy 36 speed boats to patrol the coastal areas, and several helicopters for the same purpose. It will also create an Anti-Terror force known as the Force One, and it will upgrade all the weapons that Mumbai Police currently have. The CST railway station was upgraded with metal detectors, but reports say that these are ineffective because the attendants cannot hear their beeps in the crowd. Civilians have tested these using their own licensed weapons. Maharashtra's new Home Minister, Jayant Patil, was forced to defend the performance of the police in the legislative assembly, against demands from the opposition parties for resignations from the police chief and other officials. In an attempt to take forward the 26/11 probe, the Mumbai Police will send a three members team to the United States in this regard, sources said. The team comprising Inspector Bharti, Inspector Kadam and Inspector Arun Chavan will share the findings of 26 November 2008 Mumbai attacks, with apex US investigative agency FBI. Mumbai police have sent a proposal to the Home Ministry, stating the need to establish direct contact with the FBI, to facilitate investigation in the Mumbai terror attacks. It is believed that the team, if permitted to go, will share the evidence gathered by Mumbai police, which prove Pakistan's hand in the attacks on the nation's integrity. After-effects =Government of India= Protests against the Government were witnessed all across the Country A Cabinet Committee on Security meeting was held on Tuesday, 2 December, to discuss expanding the National Security Guards (NSG) to cities outside Delhi. The aim is to have permanent presence of NSG anti-terrorist squads in cities such as Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Kolkata, to avoid wasting precious time travelling from Delhi. All NSG commandos will now undergo a new module of training, to learn how to deal with future anti-siege operations, because the Taj terrorists were in a gun battle for 59 hours continuously. Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh, on an all party conference, declared that legal framework will be strengthened in the battle against terrorism and a federal anti- terrorist intelligence and investigation agency, like the FBI, will soon be set up to co-ordinate actions against terrorism. On 17 December, the Lok Sabha approved two new anti-terror bills, which are expected to pass the upper house (Rajya Sabha) on the 19th. One sets up a National Investigation Agency, similar to the FBI, with sweeping powers of investigation. The second strengthens existing anti-terror laws, to allow suspects to be detained without bail for up to six months, on the orders of a judge. =Centre-State relations= The National Investigation Agency Bill, 2008, sets up a central agency for investigating terrorism related crimes. However, law and order is a state subject in the Constitution of India, which had made such a law difficult to pass in the past. Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram assured parliament that the National Investigation Agency (NIA) did not usurp the States' right in any manner. The central government would make use of its power only under \\"extraordinary\\" circumstances, and depending on the gravity of the situation, he said. \\"The agency will also have the powers to return the investigations to the State, if it so thinks. We have struck a balance between the right of the States and duties of the Centre to investigate.\\" =Indo- Pakistani relations= The attacks have damaged India's already strained relationship with Pakistan. India handed over two demarches to Pakistan‚Äîone was submitted at the Foreign Office in Islamabad by Indian High Commissioner Satyabrata Pal. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs also summoned Pakistan High Commissioner Shahid Malik on 1 December 2008, to lodge a formal protest over Pakistan's failure to curb terrorism emanating from its soil. According to the Indian External Affairs Minister, Pranab Mukherjee, India, in the demarches to Pakistan, asked for the arrest and handover of those 20 persons, including gangster Dawood Ibrahim, the founder of Jaish-e-Mohammad, terrorist leader Maulana Masood Azhar and Lashkar-e-Taiba, and chief Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, who are settled in Pakistan and who are fugitives of Indian law. The external affairs minister has also stated that India will await Pakistan's response. He has not ruled out the option of military strikes against terrorist camps in Pakistan. On 28 November, a hoax caller pretending to be the Indian Foreign Minister threatened Pakistan President Zardari with war, leading to the Pakistan military being put in high alert. Military aircraft with live ammunition were scrambled to patrol above Islamabad and Rawalpindi. Requests for Pakistan's cooperation India's claims that the perpetrators were Pakistan-based were consistently denied by Pakistan. Pakistan initially contested this attribution, but agreed this was the case on 7 January 2009. The Indian government supplied a dossier to Pakistan's high commission in Delhi, containing interrogations, weapons, and call records of conversations during the attacks.Pakistan is given evidence in attacks, AP wire story in NYT, 5 January 2009 Shown to friendly governments and media, it provides a detailed sequence of training, supplying, and constant communications with handlers from Pakistan. The Pakistan government dismissed the dossier as \\"not evidence\\", but also announced that it had detained over a hundred members of Jamaat-ud-Dawa, a charity linked with Lashkar-e-Taiba. Moreover, Indian government officials said that the attacks were so sophisticated that they must have had official backing from Pakistani \\"agencies\\". an accusation denied by Pakistan. At the request of Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the head of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), Ahmad Shuja Pasha, was reported to be coming to India to share intelligence and help the investigation, but later on it was decided by Pakistani authorities that instead of Director General of the ISI, his representative will visit India to help the Indian government in the investigations. India handed over two demarches to Pakistan ‚Äì one was submitted at the Foreign Office in Islamabad by Indian High Commissioner Satyabrata Pal. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs also summoned Pakistan High Commissioner Shahid Malik on 1 December 2008, to lodge a formal protest against Pakistan's inaction against terrorist groups operating within the country. The Indian foreign ministry released a statement, describing the actions it expects Islamabad to take. \\"It was conveyed to the Pakistan high commissioner that Pakistan's actions needed to match the sentiments expressed by its leadership, that it wishes to have a qualitatively new relationship with India,\\" the statement said. \\"He was informed that the recent terrorist attack on Mumbai was carried out by elements from Pakistan. Government expects that strong action would be taken against those elements, whosoever they may be, responsible for this outrage,\\" it said. The CNN-IBN reported that India had asked Pakistan to hand over Mumbai Underworld Don Dawood Ibrahim, Lashkar- e-Toiba chief Hafiz Muhammad Saeed and Jaish-e-Mohammed leader Maulana Masood Azhar for their suspected involvement in the Mumbai terror attack. Dawood, India's most wanted criminal, is suspected to have helped the LeT terrorists who attacked Mumbai on 26 November. Azhar, founder of the terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammad, is on India's most wanted list of people it accuses of terrorism. India freed Azhar from prison in exchange for passengers on a hijacked Indian Airlines Flight 814 in 1999. Times of India, quoting Indian External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee, reported: \\"Now, we have in our demarche asked (for) the arrest and handover of those persons who are settled in Pakistan and who are fugitives of Indian law\\" \\"...there are lists of about 20 persons. (These) lists are sometimes altered and this exercise is going on and we have renewed it in our demarche\\", Mukherjee said, adding that India \\"will await\\" Pakistan's response in the Indian-Arab forum. In an interview with NDTV, Pranab Mukherjee had not ruled out the option of military strikes against terror camps in Pakistan. Mukherjee said that every country has the right to protect its territorial integrity, and take appropriate action when necessary. He also said that it has become difficult to continue the peace process with Pakistan in this. Denials from Pakistan Pakistan claimed that it had not received any letter from Mohammad Ajmal Amir, the lone terrorist arrested for the Mumbai attacks, seeking legal aid. It also repeated its denial on his Pakistani nationality, saying it needed \\"incontrovertible\\" evidence. The Mumbai police had said that the captured terrorist Ajmal Amir had written a letter to the Pakistan High Commission in India, asking for help, and that the letter had been given to India's central government. But the Pakistan High Commissioner to India, Shahid Malik, told Karan Thapar in the \\"India Tonight\\" program of CNBC TV-18, that no such letter had been received. According to Pakistan's Dawn newspaper, Ajmal's father in Pakistan had admitted that the man seen in photographs at the CST railway station was indeed his son. But the High Commissioner said they needed \\"something which is incontrovertible, which cannot be challenged in a court of law\\". Pakistan was also not contemplating giving Zaki-ur-Rahman Lakhvi, the alleged mastermind of the Mumbai attacks, access to the FBI for investigation. Interpol involvement Shortly after the Mumbai attacks, the Interpol team visited India and \\"promised help in securing the details of the 10 gunmen who attacked several places in Mumbai, 26 November, leaving at least 173 people dead and more than 300 others injured\\". Interpol Secretary General Ronald Noble arrived in Islamabad on Tuesday, 23 December, for talks over Indian allegations of involvement with Pakistan-based militant groups in the Mumbai terror attacks. Interpol secretary general Ronald Noble met Pakistan's security officials the same day. However, in a later press-conference, the Interpol chief said that India didn't share any specific information with the Interpol regarding the terror attacks. He said that Interpol had the same information that had been with media and the general public. Pakistan's Minister for Information and Broadcasting Sherry Rehman claimed that this statement somehow supported Pakistan government's stance that Indian government has yet to share substantial and credible evidence with them, and again offered help in due cooperation to India, for joint investigations into the Mumbai attacks. On 10 March, India gave Interpol the DNA of the attackers. Military preparations On 7 December, US Senator John McCain relayed a message from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, to a group of Pakistanis at a lunch in Lahore, that if Pakistan did not arrest those involved with the attacks, India would begin aerial attacks against Pakistan. Pakistan Information Minister Sherry Rehman said that \\"Our air force is on alert, and ready to face any eventuality\\". Ali Abbas Rizvi quoted a source as saying, \\"They [India] may have wanted to know whether the PAF was on five-minute alert or cockpit alert, and thereby find out the reaction time\\". On 19 December, private intelligence agency Stratfor, in its latest report, said, \\"Indian military operations against targets in Pakistan have in fact been prepared, and await the signal to go forward\\". They also wrote that, \\"Indian military preparations, unlike previous cases, will be carried out in stealth\\". India's Border Security Force (BSF) has been put on high alert on the western sector, as well as the eastern sector, in order to prevent terrorist infiltration. On 22 December, Pakistan began combat air patrol (CAP) over several cities, including Islamabad, Lahore, and Rawalpindi, which began a panic among Pakistani civilians. Many Pakistani civilians \\"started making frantic phone calls to media house[s] to enquire about whether a war has been declared\\". Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said, \\"Pakistan defence forces and armed forces are ready to face any challenge, as Pak has the full right to defend itself\\". Pakistani PM Yousuf Raza Gilani said, \\"Pakistan remains united and is ready to fight anyone to defend itself\\". Pakistani Defense Minister Ahmad Mukhtar Chaudhry said, \\"If India tried to thrust war, then the armed forces of Pakistan have all the potential and right to defend [Pakistan]\\". According to Pakistani media, India had started deploying troops along the Rajasthan border, and had tightened security in and around the defence airstrips. More radars and quick reaction teams were then deployed along the India-Pakistan border. Indian forces were on regular firing exercises at locations, like Lathi Firing Range in Jaisalmer, Mahsan in Bikaner, Suratgarh and Ganganagar. On 23 December, Kamal Hyder, Al Jazeera's correspondent in Pakistan, wrote that the Pakistani \\"navy, air force and army were on red alert\\" and that \\"the chiefs of Pakistan's three armed forces were holding what had been described as an emergency meeting at general headquarters in Rawalpindi\\". He also wrote that \\"[t]he Pakistani air force have been seen visibly in a number of locations flying close to the Pakistani-India border, in what is being described as an aggressive patrolling mode, following reports that India is planning pre- emptive strikes against locations in Pakistan\\". A Pakistani airforce spokesperson said \\"[i]n view of the current environment, the PAF has enhanced its vigilance\\". Pakistani army chief General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, said that Pakistan would mount an equal response \\"within minutes\\", to any Indian attack.www.ptinews.com Pakistan continued to combat air patrol over several cities. The Taliban and affiliated groups openly declared their solidarity with Pakistan. The banned Tehrik-e-Taliban had proclaimed that they would send \\"thousands of (their) well-armed militants\\" in order to wage jihad against India if war should break out. Hundreds of would-be bombers were equipped with suicide jackets and explosive-laden vehicles. On 24 December, P.K. Barbora, the air officer commanding-in-chief of Western Air Command, said \\"[t]he IAF has earmarked 5,000 targets in Pakistan. But whether we will cross the LoC or the International Border to hit the enemy targets will have to be decided by the political leadership of the country\\". India Today reported that \\"Indian Air Force fighter planes are engaged in round the clock sorties. An unusual hectic activity of Indian Air Force has been visible along the border for past some days\\". On the same day, Stratfor confirmed that \\"the state government of Rajasthan has ordered residents of its border villages to be prepared for relocation\\". President Asif Ali Zardari said \\"We will defend the country till the last drop of our blood\\",www.ptinews.com and \\"[w]e will defend the country till our last breath\\". Pakistan began deploying warplanes to forward air bases. On 25 December, however, the ruling UPA government in India played down apprehensions of an imminent military conflagration. The Indian Prime Minister made it clear that \\"nobody wanted war\\". The Indian Air Force also downplayed the sorties by PAF fighter jets, saying it was an air defence exercise. Officials in New Delhi were amused at Pakistan air force's attempt to create war hysteria in the region. However, R. C. Dhyani, DIG of Rajasthan frontier BSF, said, \\"[a] lot of military movement is being noticed in districts just across the international border for the last few days, which is not normal\\" and \\"Pakistan has deployed more troops across border\\". Leader of the House Raza Rabbani, said that any surgical strike into its territory would be taken as an act of war and would be repulsed with \\"full force\\", and that \\"[e]ach and every inch of the country will be safeguarded\\". India moved MiG-29s to Hindon air base, located near New Delhi, in order \\"to protect the capital from aerial threats\\". The Pakistani city of Mianwali began a blackout. Pakistan continued deployment, and moved the 10th Brigade to the outskirts of Lahore, and the 3rd Armored Brigade to Jhelum. The 10th Infantry Division and the 11th Infantry Division had been placed on high alert. The Indian Army deployed quick reaction teams (QRTs) along the border, which \\"precede the movement of bridging equipment ‚Äì to cross canals in Punjab ‚Äì and of heavy guns\\". Amir Mir of Daily News and Analysis wrote that \\"Pakistan's military leadership has advised president Asif Ali Zardari to take back his statement made last month, that his country would not be the first to use nuclear weapons in the event of a conflict with India\\". On 26 December, Pakistan cancelled all military leave,www.google.com and activated contacts with friendly countries and military partners. Pakistan deployed troops to \\"protect vital points along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir and the international border with India\\".www.ptinews.com Pakistani Foreign Minister Quresh said that, \\"if war is imposed, we will respond to it like a brave, self-respecting nation\\". Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh held a second meeting of the Nuclear Command Authority to \\"discuss all the options available to India\\". Pakistan deployed the 14th Infantry Division to Kasur and Sialkot, close to the border.www.google.com India advised its citizens not to travel to Pakistan. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh met with the chiefs of the Indian air force, army, and navy. On 27 December, India's largest opposition party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), called for all travel between India and Pakistan to be stopped, and for the recall of the Indian High Commissioner from Pakistan. The Pakistani Army alerted retired army personnel to be ready to be called back to active duty. On 28 December, Pakistan postponed all officer training courses. On 29 December, the leaders of the Indian and Pakistani armies spoke over their red telephone, in order to avert an accidental nuclear war. The President of the BJP, Rajnath Singh, called for a joint India-US military action against Pakistan. John McCain said, \\"The Indians are on the verge of some kind of attack on Pakistan\\". On 30 December, Pakistani media stated: \\"The service chiefs of all of the branches of India's military were told to stay in the country in order to achieve 'complete readiness'. All units that are on exercises have been ordered to remain so indefinitely, and to indicate any equipment or ammunition they need\\". However, this was not backed by Indian nor international media. =Pakistani deployments= The Pakistani military had cancelled all leave. Elements of the Pakistani Airforce had been deployed to frontline bases. The IV Corp, with 60,000 troops, has been deployed to Lahore. Pakistan had deployed the 3rd Armored Brigade to Jhelum, and the 10th Brigade, with 5,000 troops, to Lahore. The 10th Division had been deployed to Ichogul and the 11th Division had been deployed to Tilla. Pakistani Army units had been deployed to Kashmir and the Jammu sector of the border. The 14th Division, with 20,000 troops, had been deployed to Kasur and Sialkot. =Indian deployments= India had put its Border Security Force, India's border patrol agency, on high alert. Mig-29s have been deployed to Hindon air base, in order to protect New Delhi. Later IAF sources claimed that the move was a result of intelligence inputs of an air attack on Delhi. The Indian Navy had moved six warships, including the INS Jalashwa and the INS Ranveer, to the west coast. =Trials in Pakistan= Indian and Pakistani police had exchanged DNA evidence, photographs, and items found with the attackers, to piece together a detailed portrait of the Mumbai plot. Police in Pakistan had arrested seven people, including Hammad Amin Sadiq, a homoeopathic pharmacist, who arranged bank accounts and secured supplies, and he and six others began their formal trial on 3 October 2009, in Pakistan, though Indian authorities say the prosecution stopped well short of top Lashkar leaders. =Impact on the United States= US officials feared that should the firm evidence emerge that the Mumbai terror attacks were planned and directed from within Pakistan, it would certainly escalate tension between the neighbouring countries, and could also provoke an Indian military response, even strikes against terrorists, a media report said on Saturday. US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, on Monday, urged Pakistan to give its \\"absolute, total\\" cooperation in finding those responsible for last week's attacks on Mumbai. Rice travelled to India on 4 December 2008, at the request of President George W. Bush, in the wake of the Mumbai attacks. She said that there is need for \\"direct and tough action\\" by Islamabad, even if the perpetrators of the Mumbai terror attacks were \\"non-state actors\\". \\"Secretary Rice's visit to India is a further demonstration of the United States' commitment to stand in solidarity with the people of India, as we all work together to hold these extremists accountable\\", White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said in a statement. After visiting India, Condoleezza Rice travelled to Pakistan on 4 December 2008, to talk with the Pakistani government. She is quoted as saying, \\"We talked at length about the importance of Pakistan taking its responsibility to deal with those who may use Pakistan territory even if they are non-state actors\\". However, some of the most wanted names on the list continue to operate openly in Pakistan. No action has been taken against them by the government of Pakistan.Mumbai suspect lives freely in Pakistan, Kim Barker, Chicago Tribune, 07-Dec-2008 Police forces in places like New York and Boston practised handling of similar situations, should they occur in the US. =Impact on the United Kingdom= In the wake of the attacks, a new system of compensation for UK citizens caught up in terrorist attacks is being considered. However, \\"currently the UK government does not guarantee compensation for people injured in attacks abroad\\". UK police feared similar attacks could occur in the country. =Citizens' movements= The Mumbai attack also triggered a chain of citizens' movements across India. People from all walks of life hit the streets with candles and placards to pay tributes to the victims of the tragedy almost every weekend after the 26/11 incident. While NSG commandos, Mumbai police officials, hotel staffers, etc. who participated in the operation to eliminate the terrorists became overnight heroes, the wrath of the citizens was directed towards the Government's inability to ensure adequate security to its citizens, and soon led to the chain of resignations, including that of the Indian Home Minister, Shivraj Patil. The gathering of citizens at the Gateway of India in Mumbai was unprecedented and historic. From India Gate and Jantar Mantar in New Delhi to marketplaces and street corners all across the country, India witnessed candlelight vigils by the common people. Some organised initiatives to carry forward the citizens' movement included a Hindustan Times-CNN-IBN Initiative, India Today Group's War Against Terror, and Hindustan Hamara Citizens' Initiative, besides a large number of blogs on the issue. =February 2009 video release= On 25 February 2009, new videos were released off of CCTV, displaying the inside of the hotel where the Mumbai siege took place.

While not the founder, he was the spiritual leader of a militant reform movement of the powerful Tijaniyyah sufi ·π≠arƒ´qah (order, path, brotherhood), which has popularly taken his name, as Hamallayya or Hamallism. Disciple Hamahullah was the first disciple of a Tijaniyyah reformer and mystic Shaykh Sidi Mohamed Lakhdar Al Tounsi (d. 1909 in Nioro), who along with doctrinal and ritual changes, stressed opposition to hierarchy and downplayed the importance of formal education. Led by Hamahullah, the movement spread in the 1920s in what was then French Soudan, modern Mali. It first took root amongst Wolof traders living in Nioro, but soon spread to servile caste Muslims in Mauretania and Mali.

The experiment aims to find an annual modulation of the number of detection events, caused by the variation of the velocity of the detector relative to the dark matter halo as the Earth orbits the Sun. It is located underground at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy. It is a follow-on to the DAMA/NaI experiment which observed an annual modulation signature over 7 annual cycles (1995-2002).  Detector  The detector is made of 25 highly radiopure scintillating thallium-doped sodium iodide (NaI(Tl)) crystals placed in a 5 by 5 matrix. Each crystal is coupled to two low background photomultipliers. The detectors are placed inside a sealed copper box flushed with highly pure nitrogen; to reduce the natural environmental background the copper box is surrounded by a low background multi-ton shield. In addition, 1 m of concrete, made from the Gran Sasso rock material, almost fully surrounds this passive shield. The installation has a 3-level sealing system which prevents environmental air reaching the detectors. The whole installation is air-conditioned and several operative parameters are continuously monitored and recorded. DAMA/LIBRA was upgraded in 2008 and in 2010. In particular, after the upgrade in 2010 the experiment entered in its phase 2, with an increase of the set-up‚Äôs sensitivity thanks to the lowering of the energy threshold. The DAMA/LIBRA-phase 2 is in data taking.  Operation and results DAMA/LIBRA phase 1 data collection started in September 2003\\\\. The DAMA/LIBRA released data correspond to 7 annual cycles. Considering these data together with those by DAMA/NaI, a total exposure (1.33 ton √ó yr) has been collected over 14 annual cycles. This experiment has further confirmed the presence of a model-independent annual modulation effect in the data in 2-6 keV range that satisfy all the features expected for a dark matter signal with high statistical significance. As previously done for DAMA/NaI, careful investigations on absence of any significant systematics or side reaction in DAMA/LIBRA have been quantitatively carried out. The obtained model independent evidence is compatible with a wide set of scenarios regarding the nature of the dark matter candidate and related astrophysical and particle physics. =Interpretation and comparisons= The results can be compared with the CoGeNT signal and other experiment limits to evaluate interpretations as WIMPs, neutralino, and other models. However the CoGeNT-signal has since been shown to have resulted from unaccounted background from surface effects; after accounting for this background, the CoGeNT-signal has been shown to be compatible with null results (that is, no signal at all). The COSINE-100 collaboration has been working in Korea towards confirming or refuting the DAMA-signal. They are using similar experimental setup to DAMA (NaI(Tl)-crystals). They published their results in December 2018 in the journal Nature; their result rules out spin-independent WIMP‚Äìnucleon interactions as the cause of the annual modulation observed by the DAMA collaboration. A possible explanation of the reported modulation was pointed out as originating from the data analysis procedure. A yearly subtraction of the constant component can give rise to a sawtooth residual in the presence of a slower time dependence. SABRE The obvious criticism of the seasonal variation of events recorded in the DAMA/LIBRA experiment is that it is in fact due to some purely seasonal effect unconnected with WIMPs. Although the deep underground location minimizes temperature swings and other direct sunlight effects, there are annual humidity fluctuations and other non-obvious effects. At moment, all these criticisms are taken in account by DAMA collaboration in analysis of the experimental data and they have been excluded, as discussed in published results. A repetition of this experiment in the Southern Hemisphere with the variation in phase with DAMA/LIBRA would discount this objection; if on the other hand variation was detected in the Southern Hemisphere that was 6 months out of phase with DAMA/LIBRA, then the seasonal variation objection would be upheld. Improved versions of DAMA/LIBRA, named SABRE (Sodium-iodide with Active Background REjection) are under construction in two places. One is at LNGS, and the other is in Australia at the Stawell Underground Physics Laboratory, a laboratory being constructed 1025 m below the surface in a gold mine in Stawell, Victoria. First results are expected in 2017. The construction of the Stawell Underground Physics Laboratory (SUPL) was halted by the shutdown of its host mine in 2016. Construction restarted around one year later and SUPL is, as of October 2019, well-funded with help from the Australian government.

Saigu procession In the Heian period, successive imperial princesses stayed in the Nonomiya Shrine for a year or more to purify themselves before becoming representatives of the imperial family at the Ise Shrine in Mie prefecture.Kyoto City Tourism and Culture Information Site: Nonomiya Shrine; Kawabata, Yasunari. (2006). The Old Capital, p. 27. Contemporary annual processions recreate a scene from a picture scroll of the imperial court during the Heian period, starting from the shrine and continuing as far as the Togetsu-kyo Bridge, Arashiyama.Kyoto City: Saigu Procession; Events, October 2006. In literature Nonomiya Shrine appears in the tenth chapter of the Tale of Genji.Kyoto City: Nonomiya-jinja There are many plays and other works which are based on the narrative of Genji. In the Noh play, The Shrine in the Fields by Zeami, a scene features a priest praying when a girl enters; and, upon questioning, she tells the story of how, when Lady Rokujo was staying at Nonomiya with her daughter who had been appointed as the Ise virgin, Genji came to her.Varley, H.

He played for the Dallas Texans/Kansas City Chiefs of the American Football League (AFL) from 1962 to 1966. Brooker played college football at the University of Alabama under legendary coach Bear Bryant. He was drafted by the Texans in the 17th round (131st overall) in the 1962 AFL Draft and by the Washington Redskins in the 16th round (211th overall) in the same year's NFL Draft. Doubling as an offensive end, Brooker had his best statistical season in his rookie year, 1962. He caught four passes, three for touchdowns, the only ones he would score during his career. He also made all 33 of his extra point attempts and kicked 12 of 22 field goals for a total of 87 points. Brooker was a member of the Texans team that won the 1962 AFL Championship game, the Texans defeating the Houston Oilers (who had won the first two AFL title games, in 1960 and 1961) at Jeppesen Stadium. It would be the franchise's final game before their move from Dallas to Kansas City. Teammate Bill Hull intercepted the Oilers' George Blanda late in the first overtime of professional football's longest championship game. Hull's interception allowed the Texans to start the second overtime with two runs by Jack Spikes to move the ball to the Oilers' 25-yard line, and Brooker kicked a field goal to give the Texans the win, 20‚Äì 17. The field goal saved Texans star running back Abner Haynes from what could have been a costly error: at the start of the overtime, Haynes won the coin toss and stated that his team would \\"kick to the clock\\", which not only gave the Oilers first possession, but put the wind at their backs (the Oilers having gotten the choice of which end zone to defend). The Texans saved Haynes from embarrassment by preventing Houston from scoring in the first overtime; after the teams switched sides for the second, Brooker kicked the winning field goal 2 minutes and 54 seconds in. On September 8, 1963, in the Chiefs' inaugural game since moving from Dallas, Brooker converted eight extra points in a 59-7 victory over the Denver Broncos. This remains tied as a franchise single-game record, Mike Mercer and Lawrence Tynes equaling it in 1966 and 2004 respectively. Brooker enjoyed two more solid seasons in 1964 and 1965. In the former, during which he would be named to the AFL All-Star Game, he made eight field goals and led the AFL with 46 extra points in as many attempts, for a total of 70 points. In 1965, he kicked a career-high 13 field goals and was a perfect 37-for-37 in PATs, for 76 points. In his career Brooker scored 290 points: the three touchdowns in 1962, 41 field goals in 85 attempts, and a perfect 149-for-149 in PATs. To date, he holds the Dallas Texans/Kansas City Chiefs record for most career extra point attempts without a miss.

National champion He was an exceptionally good player of table tennis and was national champion. *1970 : State sub Junior Champion,Tamil Nadu*1973 : State Junior Champion,Tamil Nadu*Three time National Champion, Table Tennis *Bronze Medal : Asian Games *U.S.Championship - runners up *1982 : Entered semifinals in Commonwealth Games *1982 : Arjuna Award as well as a lifetime achievement award. Among his major achievements are winning the Nationals, making the semi-final of the Commonwealth championships in 1982, and helping India progress to category I from II in the 1983 Tokyo World Championships. =Early days= At the age of 12, Chandrashekhar played in the Madras Port Trust tournament. He joined the Emesor sport's council and it helped him to improve his game. The training regimen included yoga and prayers. Chandra became the Tamil Nadu state sub- junior champion in 1970. In 1973 he became Tamil Nadu's junior champion and also entered the national quarter finals. His style was flamboyant and at a time when sports coverage on TV was very limited, tickets for his matches sold in the black market in towns that traditionally patronised table tennis like Indore and Pune. Later he won the national championship. Tragedy : negligence at hospital In September 1984, at the age of 25, when already the national champion and making his mark in international table tennis, Chandrashekhar had some pain in knee which required a minor knee operation. His knee surgery at Chennai Apollo Hospital. went wrong on the operation table. The wrong dosage of anesthesia played its part and he suffered brain damage and lost his vision and control over his limbs. He spent 36 days in a near-coma state and eighty-one days in the hospital as part of rehabilitation. Treatment abroad was funded mainly from responses to a public appeal by for funds. Members of the public, sportsmen from India and abroad, politicians and actors helped generously. The treatment abroad improved his condition somewhat. =Lawsuit= A lawsuit was filed in 1985 against the hospital which came to trial three years later. The medical community's omert√† was broken by a few brave doctors, especially an anesthetist from Maharashtra who helped to demolish the hospital's case. During the trial it came to light that the orthopedic surgeon of the hospital had received training in arthroscopy only in workshops in UK and not in a medical school as part of the curriculum. Eight years after the operation, and five years since the trial began, after the examination of ten witnesses and recording a thousand pages of evidence, the court delivered a verdict in favour of Chandrashekhar in mid-May 1993. The judgement said that \\"The plaintiff is entitled to in total, Rs 17,37,920.78 by way of special damages and general damages.\\" A medico-legal case of this proportion was unheard of in India. A young patient had sued a hospital for negligence and had won nearly twenty lakhs. Even the cynics of the Indian judiciary were impressed. The hospital appealed against the decision, but ultimately settled after two years. During the trial years Chandrashekhar continued his treatment in India and abroad and worked at the State Bank of India to support himself. He was a gold medalist of Madras University (economics) was to work as a cashier. A fight which he feels would not have been necessary had \\"human spirit prevailed over ego\\". Recovery Chandrasekhar has made a good recovery physically. He has regained 70% of his vision, though reading small letters on the computer and driving at night are still a problem. Chandrasekhar was one of the sports professionals in India to ask for appearance money and also actively sought to improve players' working conditions. He wrote a column on table tennis, \\"TopSpin\\", for The Telegraph and also covered tournaments for newspapers after his operation. From a person equipped with razor sharp reflexes needed to play a game in which the ball typically travels at 100 km/h or more, Chandraselhar today is a person who does not have normal peripheral vision and cannot see beyond a few feet; he suffers from a condition called nystagmus - his eyeballs cannot focus. A bulb, for instance, appears as a series of points of light. Chandra runs an academy for young table tennis players and is married to Mala. They have a son, Sanjay. Autobiography Chandrashekhar wrote, with the help of Seetha Srikanth, an autobiography, My fightback from Death's door, published by Eastwest books, Chennai, in 2006. > There are times when I stumble on the footpath, and people have thought that > I was drunk. That is when it hurts for it is not my fault. Then I look at > the computer in my office and cannot read the small letters. To be lesser > than a normal human being is what pains me the most.

Biography Noyes was born on February 16, 1825 in Minot, Maine, and most known for publishing the Washington Evening Star. He was interested in writing from his childhood, publishing his own juvenile newspaper called the Minot Notion when he was fifteen. Maine newspapers later began to print humorous sketches that he had written. One such sketch, a dialect-heavy piece titled \\"A Yankee in a Cotton Factory\\" was widely republished. Having arranged to write letters from Washington for several New England newspapers, he traveled to Washington, D.C. in 1847; his funds running low and unable to afford train fare, he had to walk from Baltimore to Washington. In 1855 he traveled Europe on foot and during that time contributed letters to the Boston Transcript. For several months, Noyes worked for a bookseller, as an usher in a theatre, and as a route agent for the Baltimore Sun before becoming a writer for a local weekly, the Washington News. He also began writing reports in the form of letters for newspapers in Maine, Boston, and Philadelphia, and became part of the press gallery that covered the United States Congress. In 1855, Noyes returned to Washington and became a reporter for the Evening Star which had been created only a few years earlier in 1852. http://jhowell.com/tng/getperson.php?personID=I164&tree;=1 Newbold Noyes, Jr,, Howell Family Genealogy Pages It was managed by William Douglas Wallach. Circulation increased in the decade before the American Civil War, and Noyes developed contacts with the Lincoln administration's cabinet such that the Star became an outlet for official announcements. Noyes eventually rose up to the position of assistant editor. In 1867 Noyes became editor-in-chief after Wallach sold the paper to Noyes and two other investors for $110,000. After the Civil War, Noyes and his newspaper crusaded to improve Washington's buildings and infrastructure, encouraging the efforts of Alexander Robey Shepherd. In 1863, he served on the City Council and for a couple of terms as an alderman. He was active in the establishment of Rock Creek Park. Miss Noyes He married Elizabeth S. Williams in 1856. They had three sons, Theodore Williams, Frank Brett, and Thomas Clarence, and at least one daughter. Theodore was an associate editor at the Evening Star, and Frank was the treasurer and business manager. In 1893, Noyes and Brainard Warner, an early developer of Kensington, MD, built and stocked what became the first public library in the DC area, now known as the Noyes Children's Library in Kensington. He died on February 21, 1908 in Pasadena, California. Crosby S. Noyes Education Campus, a public school in Washington, DC, was named in his honor.

Demographics India census, Pazhayannur had a population of 15,979 with 7,680 males and 8,299 females. Historically, a major part of Pazhayannur was under the Brahmins, who came from Thanjavoor in Tamil Nadu. Pazhayannur is a place of religious harmony. From Pazhayannur, there are four major roads that point in different directions; towardsChelakkara, Alathur, Ottapalam, Thrissur. This makes Pazhayannur town an important junction to go to many nearby towns.There is a Higher Secondary School and a college run by the Institute of Human Resource Development (IHRD CAS Chelakkara) in this panchayath.The nearby railway stations are Lakkidi and Wadakkancherry.The nearest airport Is at Nedumbassery. History Pazhayannur ‚Äì a small town located in Thrissur district & Chelakkara region of Kerala ‚Äì is a place where religions dwell in harmony with each other. Earlier, a large part of this town was under the Brahmans who had come from Tanjavur (Tamil Nadu). At the centre of Pazhayannur is the Bhagavathy Temple that is presided by the main deity Pazhayannur Bhagavathy. It is believed that this deity was the family deity, paradevatha of the erstwhile Royal family of Cochin and was brought by the Maharaja of Cochin himself. Pazhayannur Bhagavathy Temple is believed to be more than 500 years old. In those times this temple ‚Äì known as Pallipurath Mahavishnu ‚Äì was dedicated to Lord Vishnu. Divine Mother entered this temple in Seventeenth Century and there are synopses to support this. The king of Kochi helped a great deal to develop this temple. And then it was named the Pazhayannur Bhagavathy Temple as it is called now. Both Divine Mother and Lord Vishnu are equally worshiped here in this temple. The premise has a Shiva temple too. The offering of live roosters and feeding them as an act of worship is a ritual as believed by the worshippers. People believe that these are Divine Mother's favorite; hence, by this act their wishes will be fulfilled. People say that when in old times the temple and the area around it was under an attack, Divine Mother appeared in forms of thousands of roosters, assaulting the enemy soldiers with their piercing beaks, knife-like claws and high-pitched sharp sounds and won a victory over them. So, the belief is that the act offering live roosters to Ma & feeding them would burn the evil and destroy the enemies. Going back to that odd yet kindly and pleasant ritual ‚Äì something that we don't see around. Many innocent animals and birds are sacrificed in the name of religion & a visit to such a place was indeed a joy, Adjoining to the Bhagavathy temple is the Siva temple. Pazhayannur is considered a place of historical importance, and is seen in the map of \\"Nannangadis\\" of Kerala. Nannangadis are the tombs of people who lived in the medieval times and are usually depicted in the shape of large pots. Festivals Hundreds of devotees visit the Mahakshethram every year, and partake and participate both in person and contributions to carry out the various poojas and offerings to Her. Traditionally the temple celebrates Aarattu, Niramaala, 9 days of Navarathri vilakku which is sponsored in a large way by the local institutions including the Dept. of Police, Revenue etc. The nightly events include Classical music by famous musicians, Ottanthullal, Kathakali and Harikathakaalakshepam etc. Niramaala is one of the major celebrations that goes on every year in Pazhayannur.

Demographics India census, Puthenchira had a population of 21416 with 9815 males and 11601 females.  History Puthenchira and the surrounding areas were earlier known as Mahadevar Pattanam. In the second or the third century the Perumanadikals created a ‚ÄòChira‚Äô (causeway/bund) for the purpose of agriculture. The Cheraman Perumal designated the place for building the ‚ÄòChira‚Äô by throwing Puthen( the coin prevailing then). Since then it is believed that this place is called Puthenchira. Various muris(parts) of Puthenchira were ruled by the Kodungallur Thampuran and Mukundapuram (Muriyanatt-Nadavarambu) Nambiar after the Chera dynasty fell in the 12th Century. Later when Samudiri extended his territory, both Puthenchira and Kodungallur became part of his empire. Later in 1761, the Cochin king sought help from Travancore. Travancore obliged and defeated Samudiri in the battle, delighted by this, the Cochin king gave Puthenchira to Divan Ayyappan Marthandapillai who was the commander of the Travancore army. The Divan dedicated Puthenchira to the Travancore king. So until the Travancore Cochin merger in 1949 Puthenchira was a Travancore village in the Cochin kingdom. Puthenchira is the birthplace of St. Mariam Thresia Chiramel and Blessed Fr. Joseph Vithayathil, who is the Founder of ST. Mary's GHSSK school.

Demographics India census, Thazhekkad had a population of 13387 with 6412 males and 6975 females. Thazhekkad is covering a vide area comparing to its nearby villages. Religion Hinduism, Christianity and Islam are the prominent religions in this area. 60% of the population are Hindus, 35% Christians and remaining 5% Islamic believers. St. Sebastian's church located in the village is a well known pilgrimage place for people regardless of caste or religious beliefs and social backgrounds. The deity St.Sebastian at the church is called as \\"Muthappan\\" by the residents. Followers of all religions lead harmonious and peaceful lives. Just opposite to St.Sebastian's Church, there is a temple of Lord Siva called as Thazhekkad Maha Siva Kshethram and there have not been any communal disturbances till date. This is well recognized as the best example for the communal harmony existing in the village. Economy The economy of the village is based mainly on agriculture. Agricultural crops grown include paddy, coconut, arecanut, banana, spice crops like pepper, nutmeg, and fruit trees. Thazhekkad has skilled youth who have gone to foreign lands, Middle East,Europe etc.; in search of better employment opportunities. The other significant source of income to the locality is remittances from NRIs. Transportation Road is the main mode of transportation for Thazhekad residents. The nearest railway station is Irinjalakuda, situated at Kallettumkara. The places/junctions connecting Thazhekkad to nearby towns and city include Kallettumkara, Kombinjamakkal, Thommana and Aloor and, these junctions and railway station are located at around 2-4 kilometers away from the village. Fast and easy to and fro commuting is an issue that the villagers face. Public transportation system, the most commonly used mode of transport by the public, is in its nascent stage over here. But gradually, many have overcome this issue to an extent by starting to use their own vehicles (bicycles, motor cycles and cars). Geography The landscape of this locale is attractive and naturally endowed. Evergreen paddy fields surrounded with water bodies like small canals and ponds with clear waters and aquatic richness add a perfect countryside picture to every body's heart. People from other parts of the district pay visits to Thazhekkad to enjoy holiday outings and there are a couple of interesting visitor's spots like Atbhutha Kulam (meaning 'wonder-pond'), fishing spots in paddy fields.

In the 2017 financial year, SunRice recorded revenue of A$1.1 billion and profit of A$34.2 million. The SunRice Group comprises 11 businesses and over 30 brands, and employs over 2,200 staff in Australia, the Pacific, Papua New Guinea, USA, the Middle East and Asia. Australian rice production is based in regional southern New South Wales. The company's main office is located in Leeton (with a corporate office also in Sydney), and it has rice mills in Leeton, Deniliquin, and Coleambally. SunRice also operates stockfeed plants in Leeton, Tongala and Cobden. In 2014, SunRice expanded to North Queensland with the purchase of the rice mill in Brandon, having recognised the region as an opportunity to grow specialty rice varieties to complement its existing supply of rice from the Riverina region in New South Wales.  History  SunRice began with the establishment of a single rice mill in the Riverina, New South Wales in 1950. Today, SunRice has operations across Australia, Papua New Guinea, the Pacific, the USA, Asia and the Middle East.  Products  SunRice manufactures more than 700 products - from table rice and rice flour, snacks and rice meals, to companion animal and livestock products Around 80% of the Australian crop is exported as branded product in an average year to key markets including Asia, the Pacific and the Middle East. During the 2017 financial year, the Company experienced significant market share growth in the domestic Australian snack foods sector due to increasing sales of microwave rice meals. To complement its Australian operations to ensure reliability of supply in low crop years, while enabling Riverina growers to focus on premium varieties that provide higher farm-gate returns, SunRice is establishing sustainable and secure global sourcing and supply chains. In 2016/17, SunRice sourced 320,000 paddy tonnes from Vietnam and has opened a representative office in the country.  Business units and brands  = CopRice = CopRice has been supplying animal feed for over 30 years through its plants in Leeton, Tongala and Cobden.

The assets, located in North Queensland's Burdekin region, include property, plant and equipment. SunRice is committed to building a sustainable Queensland rice industry, investing significantly to improve the quality of locally grown rice and manufacturing productivity at the Brandon Mill. Key developments have seen a weighbridge installed to enable growers to directly deliver paddy to the mill. A new software system is also being investigated to improve the management of incoming and outgoing rice stocks.

She was eighteen years of age during the time of Salem witch trials. As one of the core group of allegedly afflicted girls, Sheldon made claims of afflictions for the first time during the last week of April 1692. Sheldon was the daughter of Rebecca Scadlock and William Sheldon. When Sheldon was a baby, her family was driven out of their home in Saco, Maine by Native Americans during King Philip's War in 1676. The family lived in Salem, Massachuettes during King Philip's War but returned to Saco when peace was established. The family fled Saco once again during King William's War and returned to Salem. Sheldon's elder brother Godfrey died in Maine in July 1690 and her father William died in Salem in December 1691. Having lost their Maine farm, the Sheldon family lived in poverty in Salem after 1691. In April 1692, Sheldon was eighteen years old when she became one of the main accusers in the Salem Witch Trials. Records show that Sheldon testified against eleven witches and filed at least 24 depositions. Sheldon was personally responsible for bringing witchcraft accusations against Salem's wealthiest and most prominent couples, Mary and Philip English. This was Sheldon's first accusation. According to historian Mary Beth Norton, Sheldon likely died unmarried and childless.

It is widely believed that this village was situated on the banks of Bharathapuzha during prehistoric times. Shrinking of the river over several millennia of human settlements has moved the village more distant from its banks. It is surrounded by small green hills and is 30 mins drive away from the cultural capital of Kerala. Varavoor was declared \\"litigation- free\\" village on 7 May 2000. Climatic conditions in and around Varavoor varies around the year. The well-known Palakkal Pooram is usually held in the month of February welcoming tourists from different parts of the country. During the month of February, paddy fields surrounding the Palakkal temple is usually fallow after harvest, making it ideal location for gathering for the pooram festivities and for fireworks at night. Flora and Fauna Varavoor is home to a wide variety of flora and fauna. Several herbs and plant species are found in small patches around the place. Main occupation of the people used to be agriculture. Many youngsters had relocated to cities looking for a white collar job in the past and agriculture has since taken a backseat, like elsewhere in the state. Once lush green paddy fields are now dry barren pieces of land. Animals mainly include domestic livestock and cattle. Small animals like mongoose, porcupine, squirrels etc. were once in abundance. When the habitat of animals like snakes, peacocks, foxes, monkeys, deer and boars were disturbed, they took on to the remaining paddy fields and rubber plantations. Now many of these animals are sighted regularly in the fields and bushes. Depletion of water bodies have driven away many species of birds which used to flock in and roost in the locality. Demographics India census, Varavoor had a population of 7643 with 3617 males and 4026 females. Geology Outskirts of Varavoor were found to be the epicenter of tremors and relatively strong quakes reported in the district. A Siesmometer has also been installed in the locality to record these tremors. Culture and Religion This village was a part of Chera Kingdom once and was later invaded by Tipu Sultan. Chera kings were ardent Shaivas and the legend says that they had built 108 Shiva temples in the neighborhood. Almost all these temples were lost in the ebb of time. Thanks to Archaeological Survey of India, we can still experience the ancient temple architecture in Thirumathaliyappan temple, preserved intact. The villagers have also resurrected some Shivalingas from ruins and one such Shivalinga worshipped in Keezhthali Mahadeva Temple stands tall as one of the biggest In India. Remnants of ancient homes and burial urns were also discovered and excavated not very far from the locality. The village is now religiously and culturally rich with Hinduism, Islam and Christianity in practice. A dilapidated shrine, believed to be that of a Jain temple, is also found at a distance of 15 Km from here, approx. =Churches= *Our Lady of Divine Love Church Varavoor =Temples= *Cheloor Sri Devi Chira Anthimahakalankavu *Varavur Palakkal Bhagawathy Temple *Keezhthali Sree Mahadeva Temple *Ramankulangara Ayyappan Kavu Temple *Moorkkan Kulangara Sree Mahadeva Temple *Methrukkovil Kottaram Shiva Temple *Thali Nedumbrayur Thirumuthaliyappan Temple *Sree Viruttanam Bhagavathy temple =Mosques= *Thali Mosque *thaqwa masjid thali *mohiyuddin masjid naduvattam *Varavoor Makham Sherief (valavu) *Kumarappanal Mosque *Kottupuram Mosque Transport Varavoor is well connected by road and rail.
