(2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, , p. 556 A further single followed later that year - the three-track Desolation Railway 12 inch EP - before they signed to French label Danceteria and released their debut mini album Mars in 1988, collecting tracks from the earlier singles alongside several new numbers. The band's lineup changed frequently, with key members including guitarists Curtis Johnson and John Novak, Dave Freak (guitar, percussion, vocals) and Chris Evans (bass). Their next album, Totem, was released in late 1989, preceded by a single featuring a cover version of Suicide's \\"Rocket USA\\" produced by Kevin Haskins (Love & Rockets/ Bauhaus) and featuring The Jazz Butcher. During this period the band played across the UK and Europe, and supported a variety of acts including Spacemen 3, Tom Verlaine, The Mission, and Red Lorry Yellow Lorry. Thompson, Derek A.

Will Travel, Volume 3 A Czechoslovakia-only live album was released in late 1991 and Pandora's Box followed in 1992, their last studio album for Danceteria, although the label issued a compilation of the band's work later that year.

Novak also released more electronic-oriented music under the names Nova Galaxie Robotnik and Novak State Conspiracy (with Simon Coleby). By the 2000s the permanent members were down to Novak and Denton, who released Zenith in 2004. Musical style The band described their sound as \\"Bladerunner sci-fi rock 'n' roll mixed with acidic cinematic visions\\". MC5 and The Stooges were other reference points while the use of drum-machine on early singles recalls Sisters Of Mercy. They have been characterised as experimental rock, drawing comparisons to Christian Death, also being compared to Joy Division, with goth rock influences.

See also: Casa Amadeo is located in a historic apartment building located in the Longwood section of The Bronx, New York. Designed by James F. Meehan, the apartment building was built in 1905 and named The Manhaset. The building is a six-story, Neo-Renaissance style building with commercial storefronts on the first floor. The lower two stories are faced with rusticated stone and the upper floors in red brick. It features a projecting entrance porch flanked by Corinthian order columns. The building is managed by local grassroots organization Banana Kelly, which has rehabilitated and maintained buildings in Longwood since the 1970s. History The first Puerto Rican owned music store in New York City, Almacenes Hernández was founded by Victoria Hernández and her brother Rafael Hernández at 1724 Madison Avenue in 1927. Almacenes Hernández was sold to record producer Luis Cuevas in 1939. The second music store founded by the siblings, Casa Hernández, was founded in 1941. It was sold in 1969 to musician and composer Miguel Angel \\"Mike\\" Amadeo, who renamed it Casa Amadeo, antigua Casa Hernández. Mike Amadeo still owns and operates the music store. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. Miguel Angel Amadeo Miguel Angel Amadeo, better known as \\"Mike\\" Amadeo, is a Puerto Rican musician and owner of the Casa Amadeo music store in the Bronx. Amadeo, born in Bayamon, Puerto Rico is the son of composer Alberto \\"Titi\\" Amadeo, a musician who played with Cuban bandleader Desi Arnaz for NBC. He is the uncle of Grammy Award-nominated musician Tito Nieves. Mike Amadeo is a prolific composer, with nearly 300 songs to his credit, performed by artists such as Celia Cruz, Danny Rivera, and Cheito Gonzalez. In 1954 Amadeo took a trip to Puerto Rico. While there he met pianist Rafael Ithier, who was working for bandleader Rafael Cortijo. When Cortijo's group fell apart, Ithier formed El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico, and Amadeo began contributing music to the Gran Combo, including Amadeo's best known song - Que Me Lo Den en Vida (Give it to Me in Life). Back in New York City, Amadeo joined Alegre Records, and associated with the first generation of Nuyorican musicians including Johnny Pacheco, Ray Barretto and the brothers Eddie Palmieri, and Charlie Palmieri. With his long residency, and personal connections to the Latin music community, Mike Amadeo is known as a community historian. For his contributions to Puerto Rican music and the Bronx, Mike Amadeo has been honored by the National Puerto Rican Day Parade in 2008, a Hostos Center for the Arts & Culture concert in 2005, and by the Bronx Council on the Arts in 2010.

During the Nazi and post- Nazi era, he provided aid to refugees, Jews, and prisoners of war and was reported to Nazi authorities for these activities.  Life  Carl Alexander of Württemberg (in the middle) with his brothers and sisters in 1903 Carl Alexander was the third son of Albrecht, Duke of Württemberg and his wife, Archduchess Margarete Sophie of Austria. He also had four younger sisters. He was taught at home and attended high school after 1914. In World War I, he fought on the Western Front in Italy. He resigned as captain from active military service following the German Revolution of 1918–1919, and within a few months became a postulant at the Abbey of St. Martin in Beuron. He entered the novitiate in 1920 as \\"Brother Odo,” taking vows in February 1921. His father succeeded King Wilhelm II, a distant cousin, as head of the House of Württemberg in October of that same year. Brother Odo was ordained a priest in 1926. In the summer of 1930, Father Odo was sent to the Abbey of St. Martin, in Weingarten, not far from Castle Altshausen. He held several offices in the monastery and was active with different Catholic youth organizations. Because of his position and his family's conservative Catholic values, he was involved in opposition to National Socialism as early as 1933 and was interrogated by the Gestapo several times. He left the abbey and traveled to Württemberg in 1934. The Nazis expelled Father Odo from Germany in 1936, and he took refuge in monasteries in Switzerland and Italy. In Switzerland, he founded International Catholic Refugees and traveled through Europe.  Emigration to the United States  In 1940, after the Swiss government informed him that they could not 100% guarantee his safety, Father Odo decided to emigrate to the United States. Before leaving, he destroyed his personal papers, which consequently cannot be used to trace his activities in detail. From 1941 Father Odo lived in Washington, D. C., continuing his work with refugees and enabling Jews to emigrate from Germany and its conquered territories. From 1943 onward, he was involved in the pastoral care of Germans in American prisoner of war camps. He convinced the Federal Bureau of Investigation that the Duchess of Windsor was sleeping with the German ambassador in London, Joachim von Ribbentrop. He remained in constant contact with him and continued to leak secrets. The historian and archivist of the House of Württemberg, Eberhard Fritz, believes that Claus von Stauffenberg's opposition to Adolf Hitler may have been partly motivated by his relationship with the House of Württemberg. (Stauffenberg's father was the last Oberhofmarschall of the Kingdom of Württemberg). Stauffenberg was personally acquainted with Father Odo and was well aware of pockets of resistance against the Nazis.Eberhard Fritz: Das Haus Württemberg und der Nationalsozialismus in Christopher Dowe (Hg.): Adel und Nationalsozialismus im deutschen Südwesten (Stuttgarter Symposion, Band 11). Stuttgart 2007. S. 132-162. After the end of World War II, Father Odo founded the Central European Rehabilitation Association (CERA), with the aim of providing war-torn Central Europe with food, clothing, medicine, and other necessities. In 1949, after CERA had fulfilled its function and was dissolved, Father Odo returned to the abbey of St. Bartholomew in Germany. He left the monastery in 1952 because of a heart condition, returning to his family castle in Altshausen. There he spent the last years of his life and was a refounder of the Yellow Hussars of Altshausen.The Bürgergarde, a mounted militia, had been founded in 1748 and abolished in 1812; a re-enactors' organization with the same name was created in 1960. Father Odo was briefly interviewed and mentioned in the 1959 biography of his cousin Queen Mary of Teck by the British biographer James Pope-Hennessy.Vickers H., ed. The quest for Queen Mary; Hodder & Stoughton, 2018. According to his wishes, Father Odo was buried in the cemetery of the Abbey of St. Martin at Weingarten, Württemberg.

The complex includes three contributing buildings and five contributing structures. The Tudor Revival style buildings were built during two construction campaigns, 1926–1927 and 1927–1929 by the United Workers' Association. The buildings feature half timbered gables, horizontal half-timbered bands topped with sloping slate roofs, corbelled and crenellated towers, and picturesque chimneys. See also: The complex was built by the United Workers' Association (part of the Industrial Workers of the World or \\"IWW\\"), and was an important early example of cooperative housing for working- class people. Most of the Association members were secular Jews with Communist political leanings who were engaged in the needle trades. The association sought to improve the living standards of its members, many of whom lived in squalid conditions in the tenements of the Lower East Side. It bought a plot of land in an undeveloped section of the Bronx, near the open space of Bronx Park, and envisioned a community of socially and politically engaged residents who would each have an equal say in the running of the complex, regardless of the size of their apartments or the prices that they paid for them. The complex had classrooms, a library, and other amenities and activities that were uncommon in other cooperative complexes that were built for profit. Though considered a social success, the complex failed financially in the Great Depression and was converted to rental housing in 1943. After decades of neglect by a succession of landlords, the complex was purchased and renovated by a new owner in the mid-1980s. The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1991. It was designated a New York City landmark in 1992.

He sat in the House of Commons between 1805 and 1832. Macdonald was born 14 February 1784, the eldest and only surviving son of Sir Archibald Macdonald, a Baron of the Exchequer, by Lady Louisa, the eldest daughter of Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Marquess of Stafford. With the support of his uncle, George Leveson-Gower, 2nd Marquess of Sutherland (later first duke), Macdonald was first elected to parliament at the by-election for the Tain Burghs in 1805. He then successfully contested the seats of Newcastle-under-Lyme at the general election of 1806, Sutherland at the general election of 1812, the Calne by-election of 1816 (and subsequent elections) and Hampshire at the general election of 1831. Macdonald's father created a baronet on his retirement in 1813 and on his death in 1826, James inherited the title. Sir James was persuaded to accept the office of Lord High Commissioner of the Ionian Islands, in the hope that the climate of the Mediterranean would improve his poor health. He was appointed to the office on 2 June 1832 and immediately gave up his Hampshire seat in the Commons. He was gazetted a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George on 22 June, the same day of the subsequent Hampshire by-election. He dined at his father-in-law's at Berkeley Square on 27 June but fell ill the next day and died of cholera on the 29th at Spring Gardens, without having set sail for Corfu or being invested as a knight. Family Sir James was married three times. Firstly. on 5 September 1805 to Elizabeth, daughter of John Sparrow, of Bishton Hall, Staffordshire, no issue. Secondly. on 10 August 1819 to Lady Sophia Keppel, eldest daughter of William Keppel, 4th Earl of Albemarle. They had two sons, Archibald Keppel Macdonald (1820-1901) and Granville (1821-1831). Lady Sophia died on 29 September 1824. Thirdly, Sir James married on 20 April 1826 Anne Charlotte, daughter of Rev. John Saville Ogle, of Kirkley Hall, Northumberland.

The stone run is slowly slipping downhill, the sliding of its boulders being audible especially during periods of heavy rain. Its name has been given to a much- frequented trail, blazed in 1864 between the Bode Gorge and the legendary Rosstrappe site. In 18 hairpin bends the Schurre wends its way up the steep stone run. The trail has been extensively developed and is cobbled in places. Several trees planted along the route, with its extreme climatic conditions, have survived. Negotiating this route uphill from the valley requires walkers to be fit due to its steep gradient and the requirement to climb around 200 metres in height. In May 2010 there was a rockslide that led to the path being closed for several months. The path was also closed in summer 2011 due to another major rockslide.

Background Sahota was born in 1981 in Derby, and his family moved to Chesterfield when he was seven years old. His paternal grandparents had emigrated to Britain from the Punjab in 1966. After finishing school, Sahota studied mathematics at Imperial College London. , he was working in marketing for the insurance company Aviva. Sahota had not read a novel until he was 18 years old, when he read Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children while visiting relatives in India before starting university. He bought the book in the airport before flying to India. While he had studied English literature at GCSE level, the course did not require students to read a novel: > We had to do a Shakespeare, and we did Macbeth. We had to do a pre 20th- > century text, and we did a play, She Stoops to Conquer. We had to do poetry > and we did Yevgeny Yevtushenko. But no novels. After Midnight's Children, Sahota went on to read The God of Small Things, A Suitable Boy and The Remains of the Day. In an interview in January 2011, he stated: > It was like I was making up for lost time – not that I had to catch up, but > it was as though I couldn't quite believe this world of storytelling I had > found and I wanted to get as much of it down me as I possibly could.

It is located south-southwest Port Austin, Michigan. It was closed in 1988 by the Air Force. After the station's closure, it was replaced by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) at Canton, Michigan (near Detroit) as part of the Joint Surveillance System (JSS), designated by NORAD as Eastern Air Defense Sector (EADS) Ground Equipment Facility J-62. History Port Austin Air Force Station was one of twenty-eight stations built as part of the second segment of the Air Defense Command permanent radar network. Prompted by the start of the Korean War, on July 11, 1950, the Secretary of the Air Force asked the Secretary of Defense for approval to expedite construction of the permanent network. Receiving the Defense Secretary's approval on July 21, the Air Force directed the Corps of Engineers to proceed with construction. The 754th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was initially activated on 27 November 1950 at a temporary site at Oscoda AFB, Michigan (L-20) with an AN/TPS-1B radar. It was assigned to Port Austin in July 1951 and began operating an AN/TPS-1C. The site then joined the Permanent radar network, and the squadron began using an AN/FPS-3 set, and initially the station functioned as a Ground- Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. An AN/CPS-4 was added in 1954. This radar was replaced in 1957 by an AN/FPS-6 height-finder radar. A second AN/FPS-6 height- finder radar was added a year later. In 1958 this site began operating an AN/FPS-20 radar, which replaced the AN/FPS-3. During 1959 Port Austin AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, feeding data to DC-06 at Custer AFS, Michigan. After joining, the squadron was redesignated as the 754th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 1 September 1959. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. In early 1962 the site received and operated an AN/FPS-24 search radar, and the AN/FPS-20 was retired. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-61. In 1964 an AN/FPS-26A height-finder radar was installed, and one AN/FPS-6 was removed later that year. The other AN/FPS-6 was removed in 1968. Over the years, the equipment at the station was upgraded or modified to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information gathered by the radars. The site came under Tactical Air Command control in October 1979 with the inactivation of Aerospace Defense Command and the transfer of the site to Air Defense, Tactical Air Command (ADTAC). Circa 1982, the main bearing of the AN/FPS-24 search radar failed catastrophically. The FAA long- range radar site at Canton (Detroit), MI, was then used as a temporary data- tie site until an AN/FPS-91A search radar could be installed at Port Austin AFS in 1983. Also, the AN/FPS-26A was replaced by an AN/FPS-116 height-finder radar for the JSS Program. The site remained in use as an Air Force site until 30 September 1988 when it was closed altogether, again replaced by the FAA radar site at Canton.

The first variation, \\"H-39,\\" called for six ships to be built, essentially as enlarged s with guns and diesel propulsion. The \\"H-41\\" design improved the \\"H-39\\" ship with still larger main guns, eight weapons, and reinforced deck armor. The Construction Office of the Oberkommando der Marine (OKM) concluded their work with the \\"H-41\\" design, and were not involved in subsequent plans. Two of them, \\"H-42\\" and \\"H-43\\", increased the main battery yet again, with pieces, and the enormous \\"H-44\\" design ultimately resulted with guns. The ships ranged in size from the \\"H-39\\", which was long on a displacement of , to the \\"H-44\\", at on a displacement of . Most of the designs had a proposed top speed in excess of . Due to the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, none of the ships were ever completed; only the first two of the \\"H-39\\" ships were laid down. What work that had been accomplished was halted; the assembled steel remained on the slipway until November 1941, when the OKM ordered it be sent for scrap and used for other purposes. Contracts for the other four \\"H-39\\" type ships had been awarded, but no work was begun on any of them before they were canceled. None of the subsequent designs progressed further than planning stages.  Initial design  The earliest design studies for \\"Schlachtschiff H\\" (\\"Battleship H\\") date to 1935, and were near repeats of the early designs for the ships, armed with guns. Intelligence indicating that the Soviet Navy was planning the with guns prompted the Germans to increase the caliber of the ship's armament to 38 cm as well on 5 October 1936. The Oberkommando der Marine (OKM) issued staff requirements at the end of October for a ship of armed with eight 38 cm guns with a speed of . The ship's radius of action was to be at least equal that of the s. Design work on the ship that came to be designated H-39 began in 1937. The design staff was instructed to improve upon the design for the preceding Bismarck class; one of the requirements was a larger-caliber main battery to match any battleship built by a potential adversary. It appeared that Japan would not ratify the Second London Naval Treaty, which would bring an escalator clause that permitted signatories to arm battleships with guns of up to caliber. By virtue of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, signed in 1935, Germany was considered to be a party to the other international naval arms limitation treaties. In April, Japan refused to sign the treaty; shortly thereafter, the United States Navy announced it would arm the new s with 40.6 cm guns. Admiral Werner Fuchs, responsible for the staff section in the OKM that determined the operating requirements for the ship, discussed the vessel's design with Adolf Hitler, the leader of Germany. Hitler demanded guns larger than any possible adversary, but guns of the caliber demanded by Hitler would have required displacements of over and drafts so deep as to prevent the use of Germany's ports without significant dredging. Fuchs eventually convinced Hitler that the 40.6 cm gun was the optimal choice for the H-39 design. In 1938, the OKM developed Plan Z, the projected construction program for the German navy. A force of six H-39 class battleships was the centerpiece of the fleet. Plan Z was finalized by January 1939, when Admiral Erich Raeder, the commander of the Kriegsmarine, presented it to Hitler. He approved the plan on 18 January and granted the Kriegsmarine unlimited power to bring the construction program to fruition. Only four shipyards in Germany had slipways large enough to build the six new battleships. The OKM issued orders for construction of the first two ships, \\"H\\" and \\"J\\", on 14 April 1939. The contracts for the other four ships, \\"K\\", \\"L\\", \\"M\\", and \\"N\\", followed on 25 May. The keels for the first two ships were laid at the Blohm & Voss dockyard in Hamburg and the Deschimag shipyard in Bremen on 15 July and 1 September 1939, respectively. The outbreak of war in September 1939 interrupted the construction of the ships. Work on the first two was suspended and the other four were not laid down, as it was believed they would not be finished before the war was over. The keel for \\"H\\" had of steel installed, of steel had been machined, out of of steel supplied to Blohm & Voss by that point. Only of steel had been worked into the keel for \\"J\\", out of of steel delivered. Steel for the other four ships had been ordered and partially machined for installation, though no assembly work had begun. It was expected to resume work on the ships after a German victory in the war. The ships neither received names nor were official name proposals published. The names, which appear in several publications (Hindenburg, Friedrich der Große, Großdeutschland) are pure speculation. Especially the often mentioned Großdeutschland (= \\"Greater Germany\\") is highly unlikely, as Hitler always feared the loss of a vessel with name of Germany (compare the renaming of to Lützow). The only hint on the names of the units were given by Hitler himself, who mentioned during documented unofficial talks, that he would propose the names Ulrich von Hutten and Götz von Berlichingen for the ships, as these names are not connected with persons of the Third Reich or the country itself, so the loss would not have a significant negative psychological and propaganda effect on the German people. = H-39 specifications = Characteristics and machinery As finalized, the H-39 design called for a ship long at the waterline and long overall. The beam was to have been with a designed draft of at displacement. At standard displacement, which was , the draft was slightly under the design value, at . With the ship fully loaded, at , draft rose significantly, to . The hull was constructed from transverse and longitudinal steel frames and featured over 90 percent welding. The hull contained twenty- one large watertight compartments and a double bottom that extended for 89 percent of the length of the keel. Four bilge keels were fitted to improve stability. The ships had an estimated complement of 2,600 officers and enlisted men. The ships were to be powered by twelve MAN 9-cylinder double acting 2-stroke diesel engines. The engines were arranged in groups of four, on three shafts, and drove three-bladed screws in diameter. Four auxiliary boilers were installed to provide backup power; two were oil-fired and were located between the central transmission rooms. The other two, a pair of exhaust gas boilers, were placed above them. The power-plant was rated at and 256 rpm; it provided a top speed of as designed. The vessels could have carried up to of diesel oil, which enabled a range of at , or at a cruising speed of . The design had one main rudder along the keel behind the center shaft and two smaller wing rudders. Electrical power was to be provided by eight 920 kW DC diesel generators at 230 volts and four 460 kW AC diesel generators at 110 volts for a total of 9,200 kW. Armament One of the 40.6 cm guns at Batterie Lindemann, part of the Atlantic Wall The main armament was to consist of eight 40.6 cm SK C/34 guns in four twin gun turrets. The 40.6 cm (16 in) gun was 50 calibers long and fired at a muzzle velocity of 810 meters per second (2,657 ft/s). The guns were supplied with a total of 960 rounds of ammunition or 120 shells per gun; each shell weighed . The guns used a sliding breech block, as was typical for German naval guns of the period; the breech was fully sealed with a brass cartridge that contained the main propellant charge. A bagged fore charge weighing supplemented the main charge. The turrets allowed for elevation to 30 degrees, which provided a maximum range of approximately . Rate of fire was expected to be two rounds per minute per gun. Fire control radar was unspecified, but the ships, which were to have been completed by 1944, presumably would have been equipped with an arrangement similar to that of as she was outfitted in 1943–44. Several of the 40.6 cm guns were constructed before work on the ships was halted; these were later employed as coastal guns, including at Battery Lindemann in France. One of the 15 cm turrets on Bismarck, the same type as would have been mounted on the H class. Twelve L/55 C28 guns mounted in six twin turrets comprised the ships' secondary battery. These were the same secondaries employed on the and Bismarck classes. The turrets allowed 40 degrees of elevation and had a maximum range of . They fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of 875 m/s (2,871 ft/s), and were primarily intended for defense against surface threats. The ships were also to be armed with six torpedo tubes, all submerged. They were all mounted in the bow, diverging from the centerline by 10 degrees. Sixteen dual-mounted L/65 C33 Flak guns provided long-range defense against aircraft. Unlike those mounted on the Scharnhorst and Bismarck classes, these guns were armored to protect their crews from shrapnel, debris, and strafing attacks. The new turrets also provided faster rates of training and elevation as compared to the earlier open mounts. Close-range air defense was provided by a battery of sixteen L/83 C33 and twenty-four C38 guns. The 3.7 cm guns were placed in eight twin mounts while the 2 cm guns were arrayed in six Flakvierling quadruple mountings. The 3.7 cm guns were closely grouped amidships and had a single, common ammunition hoist. Historians William Dulin and Robert Garzke note that the anti-aircraft battery as designed was too weak to effectively defend against the high-performance aircraft that came into service in the late 1930s and 1940s, and speculate that \\"it would have been augmented before the ships were completed.\\" Armor The design team envisioned the H-class ships fighting at relatively close range, and therefore selected the armor system that had been used by German battleship constructors since the of 1907. The side belt was vertical and was attached directly to the side of the hull, in contrast with the inclined armor belt placed inboard of the side wall used by American and French designers. The side belt, which consisted of Krupp cemented steel armor (KCA), was thick in the central section that covered the ammunition magazines and machinery spaces. The belt was reduced to on either end of the main section; the stern and bow were unprotected by the main belt. The upper side belt was thick. The German navy did not preserve official estimates for the immunity zone, though Garzke and Dulin created an estimate based on the performance of the US /45 caliber gun firing a shell. The ships' main armor would have rendered them proof against the 16 in shell at ranges between . The 16 in shell could penetrate the upper side belt at any range, however, which left the ships exposed above the waterline. The underwater protection system was broadly similar to the system employed on the Bismarck class. A thick torpedo bulkhead composed of Wotan Weich steel backed the side armor and provided defense against underwater weapons. The bulkhead was placed from the side of the hull, though abreast of the turrets and further in the bow and stern, this distance could not be maintained. The distance between the bulkhead and the side of the ship was reduced to in these areas; the designers compensated for the reduced space by increasing the thickness of the bulkhead to in these areas. Two armored decks composed of Wotan Hart steel protected the ships from plunging fire and aerial weapons. The upper deck was thick above the magazines and over the machinery spaces. The main armored deck was and thick, respectively, though on the outboard sloped sections, thickness was increased to augment the protection over the ships' vitals. Over the magazines, the sloped armor was thick; over the machinery spaces it was 120 mm thick. Concerned with the fate of the battlecruiser at the Battle of Jutland, the designers opted to provide relatively heavy bow armor for the H-class ships. A thick splinter belt protected the bow from shell fragments. It was reasoned that direct shell hits would cause localized damage that could be better isolated than damage from splinters, which could cause extensive flooding. The main battery gun turrets were armored with thick faces, thick sides, and roofs. The rear side of the turret was thick; in addition to the protection offered by the greater thickness, it also moved the center of gravity of the mounting to the rear, which helped balance the turret and improve its operation. The barbettes upon which the turrets sat were armored with face-hardened steel above the upper armor deck and non-cemented steel below the deck. The 15 cm gun turrets had thick faces, thick sides, and thick roofs. Their barbettes had thick armor protection. The 10.5 cm mounts were protected by thick gun shields. The forward conning tower had thick sides composed of KCA and thick roof composed of non-cemented steel. The rear conning tower had 100 mm thick sides and roof, KCA and non-cemented steel, respectively.  Design escalation  In early July 1940, Hitler ordered the navy to examine new battleship designs and how wartime experience might be incorporated. A study was completed on 15 July, and contained several recommendations for the H-class ships, including increasing the freeboard and strengthening the horizontal protection. In order to maintain displacement and speed and accommodate the increased weight of the additional armor protection, the design staff drew up an informal design, known as \\"Scheme A.\\" The design removed one of the main battery turrets to save weight; the propulsion system was also increased in power to keep the same speed as the original design. The original diesel-only system was replaced by a hybrid diesel and steam turbine arrangement. The staff also prepared a second design, \\"Scheme B\\", which retained the fourth turret and accepted a much higher displacement. This design also incorporated the mixed propulsion system. These studies were abandoned in 1941 after Hitler decided to halt further battleship construction until after the end of the war. The design staff therefore attempted to improve the armor protection for the H-class. The 1940 designs did not form part of the design chain that resulted in the H-41 through H-44 designs. = H-41 = Bomb damage sustained by in July 1941 provided the impetus for the effort to increase the horizontal protection for the H-class. The designers were confronted with a significant problem: any increase in armor could correspondingly increase the displacement and more importantly, the draft. It was necessary to maintain the full-load draft of 11.5 m of the H-39 design for operations in the relatively shallow North Sea. The only option that allowed the displacement to be maintained while armor thicknesses to be increased was to reduce the ships' fuel supplies. A 25 percent cut in range was required, which was deemed unacceptable by the OKM. It was eventually determined that since deep-water anchorages on the Atlantic coast were available, it would be permissible to allow the draft to increase. The initial redesign called for an increase of only , 40 percent of which was additional deck armor, the remainder being used for a larger-caliber main battery. One of the most significant changes was the decision to bore out the over-sized 40.6 cm guns to 42 cm caliber for the H-41 design. The design staff determined that modifications to the ammunition hoists and loading equipment would be easily effected and that the original turrets could be retained. The OKM was aware that the British had settled on a 40.6 cm gun for the proposed ; the 42 cm gun would grant the H-41 design a significant advantage over these new adversaries. The ships' armament was otherwise unchanged, apart from an increased number of 2 cm anti-aircraft guns, of which there were now to be 34. The ships' main armor decks were substantially strengthened: the deck was increased in thickness from to and the sloped armor at the edges was thickened from to . Wartime experience with the Scharnhorst class indicated that the torpedo-defense system was insufficiently strong to protect the H-39 design from underwater damage. Beam was therefore increased, with greater width added at the ends of the armored citadel to allow a greater distance between the side wall and the torpedo bulkhead. The stern section of the torpedo bulkhead was also strengthened structurally to allow it to better contain the force of an underwater explosion. The number of large watertight compartments was increased from twenty-one to twenty-two. A triple bottom was also included in the design, the first time this feature was used in a German warship design. The loss of Bismarck in May 1941 also influenced the design; two large skegs were added to the outboard shafts to protect them and increase support for the stern while in drydock. The rudder system was also designed with an explosive charge to detach the rudders in the event they became jammed. The new design measured long at the waterline and long overall, had a beam of , and a draft of up to at full load displacement of about . The increase in weight, while engine power remained constant, reduced speed to . However, German naval constructors were not satisfied with the torpedo side-protection system, and a series of design changes were approved by Admiral Raeder on 15 November 1941; these included increasing the side-protection system depth from to , increasing beam to , and greater hull depth and freeboard at full load. These changes resulted in full load displacement increasing to and maximum speed further decreasing to . As detailed design continued into 1942, the OKM planned to begin construction six to nine months after demobilization, initially at Blohm & Voss and the Deutsche Werke shipyard in Kiel. Deschimag, which had been awarded the contract for \\"J\\", could no longer be used due to the increase in draft, which precluded travel through the shallow Weser. Following the completion of a new, larger dock at the Kriegsmarinewerft in Wilhelmshaven, work would also be done there. The increased size of the ships would have lengthened the building time from four to five years. = H-42 through H-44 = On 8 February 1942, Albert Speer became the Reichsminister for Armaments and Munitions and gained influence over the Navy's construction programs. Speer reassigned some members of the H class design staff to work on new U-boats and other tasks deemed critical to the war effort. The Schiffsneubaukommission (New Ships Construction Commission), intended to liaise with Speer and the OKM, was created and placed under the direction of Admiral Karl Topp. This group was responsible for the design work that resulted in the H-42 type, as well as the subsequent designs. The Construction Office of the OKM formally concluded their work on new battleships with the H-41 type in August 1942 and played no further role in battleship development. After the completion of the H-41 design, Hitler issued a request for a larger battleship and placed no restrictions on gun caliber or displacement. The only requirements were a speed of , horizontal and underwater protection sufficiently strong enough to protect the vessel from all attacks, and a main battery properly balanced with the size of the ship. The results were purely study projects intended to determine the size of a ship with strong enough armor to counter the rapidly increasing power of bombs deployed by the Allies during the war. The Commission did not discuss its activities with Raeder or his successor, Admiral Karl Dönitz, or with other branches in the OKM. As the designs for the H-42, H-43, and H-44 battleships were purely conjectural, no actual work was begun. The German navy did not seriously consider construction on any of the designs, which were so large that they could not have been built in a traditional slipway. Indeed, the Construction Office of the OKM sought to disassociate itself from the projects, which they found to be of doubtful merit and unnecessary for German victory. The first design, H-42, was long between perpendiculars and had a beam of and a draft of designed and at full load. The designed displacement was and at full load rose to . The dimensions for the second, H-43, increased to between perpendiculars, a beam of , and design and full load drafts of and , respectively. Design displacement was and estimated at at full load. For the final design, H-44, the length rose to between perpendiculars, the beam increased to , and draft rose to as designed and at full load. The displacement for H-44 was as designed and up to at full load. Details on the propulsion systems for these designs are fragmentary and in some cases contradictory. Erich Gröner notes that \\"some [had] pure [diesel] engine propulsion, others [had] hybrid engine/turbine propulsion systems,\\" but does not record the type and performance for these propulsion systems. William Garzke and Robert Dulin state that all three designs featured hybrid diesel/steam turbine plants, each supplying for top speeds of , , and for H-42, H-43, and H-44, respectively. According to Garzke and Dulin, the designs had a speed of , , and , respectively, on just diesel engine power. Both sources agree on a maximum range of at a cruising speed of . Information on the armament outfits for the designs is equally contradictory. Both sources agree on the armament for H-44, which was to have been eight guns. Gröner indicates that H-42 and H-43 were to be armed with eight 48 cm guns, while Garzke and Dulin state that the H-42 design was to have retained the 42 cm guns from the H-41 design and H-43 would have also been armed with 50.8 cm pieces. Both works agree that the secondary armament was to have consisted of twelve 15 cm L/55 guns and sixteen 10.5 cm L/65 guns as in the previous designs, though the lighter weapons are disputed. Gröner states that all three designs were to be equipped with twenty-eight 3.7 cm and forty 2 cm anti- aircraft guns, while Garzke and Dulin report only sixteen 3.7 cm guns and forty 2 cm guns for H-43 and H-44 only; H-42 was to have twenty-four 2 cm guns.

It is found in the southeast of the United States, living gregariously on trees, feeding on and lichen and fungi and spinning a web that adheres to the trunk and large branches in sheets. The webs are thought to protect the barklice from predators and neither the insects nor the webs cause damage to the trees.IFAS Extension Distribution This barklouse is found near the Atlantic coast of the United States southwards from South Carolina and along the Gulf Coast from Florida to Texas. Description Both adults and nymphs of A. nomas are soft-bodied insects resembling aphids, with long narrow antennae. The mandibles are designed for chewing and the central part of the maxilla is modified into a slender rod which is used to brace the psocid while it grinds away with its mandibles. The forehead is enlarged and there are prominent compound eyes and three ocelli. There are glands in the mouth from which silk can be spun. The eggs are pale gray or white, oblong and wider at one end than the other. The first instar nymphs are recognisable by the fact that their heads are wider than their bodies. They are wingless, miniature versions of the adult and have a pale brown head and creamy white thorax. It is unclear how many moults the nymphs undergo but in the closely related species, Archipsocus floridanus, the females moult six times whereas the males usually moult five times. Later instars are darker in colour and the third instar female exhibits wing pads for the first time. There are five times as many adult females as there are adult males but parthenogenesis has not been observed in this species.Life history studies on some Florida insects of the genus Archipsocus (Psocoptera) The adults are darker in color than the nymphs and are about three millimetres long.Beneficials in the Garden Not all adults have wings, but when they do, these are transparent and held in a tent- like position above the body. Some females have longer wings than others but when the males have wings, these are always short.Featured Creatures Life cycle In the spring, female barklice lay eggs singly or in groups in crevices on the trunks of trees and cover them with debris for protection. Hardwood trees are chosen for egg laying, particularly evergreen oaks and pecans. As the weather grows warmer, the number of insects mounts and from July to October the colonies rapidly increase in size. The sheets of silken webbing they build may cover the trunk and main branches of the tree. It is at this time of year that long-winged females are seen and these fly off to establish new colonies on other trees. By early December, populations are beginning to decline and most psocids are killed by frosts during the winter. The webs tatter and disintegrate in bad weather. Both nymphs and adults feed primarily on small crustose lichens, but also consume fungi, dead bark and organic debris. The insects overwinter as adults and occasionally as late instar nymphs on the evergreen southern live oak, Quercus virginiana, and cabbage palms, Sabal palmetto, where they are less likely to be killed by frost than on other trees. Polymorphism sometimes occurs in this species. The web The webs are a dense sheet of strands, each of which is finer than the silk spun by spiders. They may cover tree trunks and branches, and also sometimes occur on the sides of buildings and the leaves of palm trees, oaks and magnolias. On tree trunks, the long axis of the web is usually parallel to the trunk and the fabric contours the grooves and ridges. On branches the web may appear to originate from twig junctions. The psocids can detect vibrations in the web and take action to escape from potential predators which are usually spiders and ants. Several species of mites and springtails have been found under the web but they seem to be casual visitors, having no relationship with the psocids but also gaining protection from the web. Behaviour Although these psocids are gregarious, they are not social in the sense usually used by entomologists. The female does not care for the eggs after they have been laid but the nymphs do grow up in the protective environment of their parental web, to which they also contribute silk for building and repairs.

They split up in April 2014 after 6 years as a band citing that they had felt it had come to a natural conclusion. On their own label 'Apres Vous', Hold Your Horse Is self-released two EPs: Good Hustle and Everyone Runs Faster With a Knife, in November 2008 and June 2009 respectively; followed by the double-B-side single \\"Lost The Magic\\"/\\"Broken Sound\\" in September 2009. Their track \\"Christopher Walken\\" received some acclaim, including airplay on Radio 1 by Steve Lamacq, and Huw Stephens, BBC 6music by Tom Robinson and XFM by John Kennedy. 2010 saw them sign to Big Scary Monsters Recording Company, which concluded with the release of the six-track EP Rammin' It Home in August followed by a month-long UK tour with label mate and friend Shoes and Socks Off. Their EP received physical coverage in Rocksound and Front and online coverage from sites such as Artrocker and The 405, as well as radio airplay from all the aforementioned DJs and Alex Baker at Kerrang! radio. The BBC also made them 'Tip of the Week' with their track 'Welcome To Obscurity'.

History The stamps of the dominions and foreign countries were not represented in the Museum's collection after 1890. Wilmot Corfield, one of the most prominent figures in Anglo-Indian philately at the beginning of this century, campaigned from 1910 onwards for the augmentation of the Tapling Collection or, if this were impossible, the creation of a collection of modern stamps in some other museum in the London area. The stamps of the dominions and foreign countries were not represented in the British Museum's Tapling Collection after 1890. At the Fifth Philatelic Congress, held at Edinburgh in 1913, Wilmot Corfield outlined his proposals for the completion of the Tapling Collection and the establishment of a National Collection Committee which would assist the British Museum, on a voluntary basis, in keeping it up to date. E. D. Bacon, in his capacity as honorary philatelic adviser to the Museum, investigated the possibilities of acquiring stamps from the General Post Office. As a result, a parcel of stamps was handed over to the Museum early in 1914. The General Post Office offered to make regular donations of stamps to the Museum, but the offer was declined and, with the advent of the First World War, no further action was taken. Negotiations between the General Post Office and the Museum in June 1962 and culminated in November 1964 with the transfer of the collection hitherto maintained by the Accountant General's Department. Since then specimens of all new issues received by the General Post Office from the International Bureau have been forwarded to the Museum for inclusion in this collection. Colonial stamps circulated by the Universal Postal Union from 1885 till 1948 were overprinted or perforated SPECIMEN for security reasons, whereas the stamps given to the Museum direct were in mint, unoverprinted condition. In recent years the study of 'Specimen' overprints has developed as a branch of philately and the main value of this collection lies in the fact that it represents a period when such overprints (and their equivalents in German, Spanish, Russian, Italian, and Dutch) were in use. There are a few stamps which were distributed through the Universal Postal Union but which were not subsequently issued in the country of origin. In these cases the only examples to survive are invariably in the official collections. They include the St. Helena I d. of 1903 printed entirely in red (instead of in red and black). Apart from the interest to the student of 'specimen' stamps the value of this collection lies in its world-wide scope, as it provides the general public with the stamps of almost 500 postal administrations. As of 2007 the stamps in the collection were held in 228 albums and the postal stationery in 22. There was a small amount of additional material.Martin, Jeremy, & John Powell.

This is one of at least ten species of Knowltonia that are native to South Africa. Knowltonia vesicatoria can be told apart from the other species by its leaves and stems being hairless, and by the slightly jagged, toothed margins of the leaves. It in turn has three subspecies: vesicatoria, humilis and grossa. This slow-growing plant forms clusters of dark green leaves on the forest floors where it grows. It produces white or yellow flowers in spring and then clusters of fleshy black fruits. A tough and adaptable plant that easily survives seasonal fires, Brandblaar grows in shady spots in Cape Fynbos, along the coast, in afro-montane forest and just about anywhere else - throughout the Cape Floristic Region, from Cape Town eastwards as far as Grahamstown. Further east - in the Eastern Cape and Kwazulu-Natal - this plant's close relative Knowltonia capensis is rather more common. This is an ideal plant for shady spots in gardens. It grows very slowly but once established it is tough and attractive, and survives deep shade where other plants would die. It grows much faster if it is watered regularly, and should be allowed to establish itself, free from competition from faster-growing groundcovers.

It has regional branches in most of the major Polish cities and, similarly to the France 3 in France or Rai Tre in Italy, for couple of hours every day it broadcasts regional programming, including local news and reports. In the beginning, TVP Regionalna existed only as an umbrella brand for TVP regional affiliates. By the late 1990s, all TVP affiliates were connected together into a single national network, producing local news as well as some shows which were broadcast nationwide. In 2003–2007 from 7:30 to 22:30 it aired nationwide news bulletins every hour. It was also used as the Polish parliamentary channel, transmitting the Sejm meetings, parliamentary inquiry commission's proceedings and other major political events. In 2005, four new regional bureaus were created by splitting one bureau each from TVP Kraków, TVP Katowice, TVP Gdańsk and TVP Poznań. This move increased the number of bureaus to 16, one for each Polish voivodeship. In 2007 TVP3 was replaced by TVP Info. This channel has broadcast regional programming (from 17:00 to 20:00 and from 21:45 to 22:15 every day). On September 1, 2013 local programs were separated from TVP Info and moved to the reactivated TVP Regionalna (from January 2, 2016 under the name TVP3). In fact, TVP3 is not a single channel but sixteen regional channels with local programming (currently from 7:00 to 8:15 and from 17:30 to 22:15 every day). The rest of the schedule fills a common program with magazines, documentaries and current affairs programs. Its main offices are located at the TVP news compound in central Warsaw. TVP3 can be watched via TV aerial or cable networks and via DVB-T.

With its territory spanning throughout the eastern shores of North Kalimantan and Tawau, Malaysia. History =Foundations= The Sultanate was founded by a Kayan group, the Uma Apan, who originated from the interior region of Apo Kayan (Kayan Highland Plateau), before settling near the coast in the 17th century. Around 1650, a princess of the group married a man from Brunei. This marriage founded a Hindu lineage who settled in the region of today's Tanjung Selor. Around 1750, this dynasty converted to Islam. Its rulers took the title of Sultan and were recognised as vassals of the sultan of Berau, the latter acknowledging himself a vassal of the kingdom of Kutai. In 1850, the Dutch, who had conquered Berau in 1834 and imposed their sovereignty upon Kutai in 1848, signed with the Sultan of Bulungan a Politiek Contract. The Dutch intervened in the region to combat piracy and the trafficking in slaves. =Foreign intervention= In 1881, the North Borneo Chartered Company was created, thereby placing northern Borneo under British jurisdiction, despite initial Dutch objections. The Sultanate was finally incorporated into the colonial empire of the Dutch East Indies in the 1880s. The Dutch installed a government post in 1893 in Tanjung Selor. In the 20th century, like many other princely states of the archipelago, the Sultan was forced to sign a Korte verklaring; a \\"short statement\\" in which he sold most of its powers over land upstream. The Dutch eventually recognised the border between the two jurisdictions in 1915. The Sultanate was granted Zelfbestuur (\\"self-administration\\") status in 1928, again like many princely states of the Netherlands Indies. The discovery of oil by the BPM (Bataafse Petroleum Maatschappij) in the islands of Bunyu and Tarakan gave great importance to Bulungan for the Dutch, who made Tarakan the chief town of the region. =Post-Indonesian independence= After the recognition of Indonesian independence from the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the territory received the status of Bulungan Wilayah swapraja, or \\"autonomous territory\\", in 1950, before receiving the status of Wilayah istimewa, or \\"special territory\\", in 1955. The last Sultan, Jalaluddin, died in 1958. The Sultanate was abolished in 1959 and the territory becomes a simple kabupaten, or \\"department\\". On the dawn of Friday, 3 July 1964, a troop of Brawijaya 517 soldiers led by Lieutnant B Simatupang under the orders of Brigadier General Suharjo quickly swooped in the Bulungan Palace, kidnapping its aristocrat inhabitants while burning the rest of the palace grounds which lasted for 2 days and nights on Friday 24 July 1964. The kidnapees were later murdered, one Raja Muda Datu Mukemat in particular was reported to have been brought to sea between the islands of Tarakan and Bunyu, where he was shackled with stones as weight, shot dead and cast out into the sea.

Most of the works were demolished between 1890 and 1908, but the engine house survived and is arguably the best preserved example of its kind to be found in the United Kingdom. Background During the 17th century Parkend had been, at different times, the location of two charcoal-fired Crown furnaces, known as the King's Ironworks; In 1612 James I contracted the Earl of Pembroke to build and run a blast furnace and forge at ‘Parke End’, bringing with it the first real settlement at what was to become the village of Parkend.British History Online The furnace was destroyed on the orders of Parliament, during the Civil War, in 1644. After the war, in 1653, Parliament instructed that another furnace should be built, a short distance downstream from the first. Being located in a royal forest, control of the furnace returned to the Crown after the restoration of the monarchy in 1660. It ceased production, and was demolished, in 1674. Iron was first successfully smelted with coke in 1709 at Coalbrookdale, in Shropshire. Despite there being extensive coal measures in the Forest of Dean, local coal did not produce coke that was ideal for smelting and Forest ironmasters were reluctant to invest in the new technology. It was not until the last decade of the 18th century that coke-fired furnaces began to make an appearance, with Parkend, and its many coalmines, once again considered an ideal location for iron production. It was one of three coke-fired ironworks, Cinderford and Whitecliff being the others, that were built almost simultaneously in the Forest.The Whitecliff Ironworks in the Forest of Dean, Part one, page 19 History Work commenced on Parkend Ironworks in 1799. It was the third coke-fired ironworks to be built in the Forest of Dean, but was beset by technical problems and ceased production around 1807. Around 1820, Moses Teague discovered a way to make good iron from local coke, while working at Darkhill Ironworks. To exploit his discovery he formed the 'Forest of Dean Iron Co' and re-opened Parkend Ironworks in 1824. The chimney stack being felled in 1908.The lower pond at Cannop was built in 1825 to provide a constant supply of water, and a 1.5 mile long leat constructed to transfer water to the top of a waterwheel, which was installed in 1827 to supply power for the blast. It was 51 ft in diameter and weighed 60 tons – reputedly the largest in Britain at that time. A second furnace was also erected in 1827. Despite the enormous effort expended in creating the supply of water, it proved inadequate and in 1828 a 90 horsepower steam engine and engine house were constructed alongside the works. A year later, a second pond at Cannop was also built to boost the water supply. By 1835 the site had grown to include workers’ cottages, casting houses, blacksmith’s and carpenter’s sheds, a counting house, offices, a beerhouse, and many other ancillary buildings. In 1849 a second steam engine was added. The 'engine house', as it is today Business was booming and in 1871 a third furnace was also added; a ‘hot blast’ design which was the very latest technology at that time. Just four years later, however, the iron trade went into recession and the ironworks closed in 1877. Most of the works were demolished between 1890 and 1908, but the engine house and some ancillary buildings survived to become the country’s first Forester Training School in 1910. During the Second World War, it was used by the American army as a barracks. In 1971 it was sold to Avon County Council and became the Dean Field Studies centre. In 1984 it was afforded Grade II Listed Building protection.British Listed Buildings The building is not open to the public, but can be viewed from the roadside.

It was formed in 1972 to prevent demolition of historic buildings in Fremantle and to assist in their development. As the significance of Fremantle's built heritage came to be more widely recognised and respected (by the City, and property owners), the focus of the Fremantle Society has evolved to include more of the cultural heritage of the area. Various projects over time have highlighted Fremantle heritage, as well as advocating consideration of heritage in planning schemes. When the City's precinct system was established in the 1990s to provide interaction between the City and groups of residents, the Society became the \\"umbrella\\" precinct of the other eleven precincts. It has remained such, and is the only one not defined by geographical boundaries (the others are mostly representative of a suburb). The work of precinct groups can be supported by financial assistance from the City of up to $850 per year (as long as this is not used to support government election campaigning). The overall nature of the Society's work is ongoing due to the inherent pressures from developers and others. Fighting for Fremantle, a history of the Society by Ron and Dianne Davidson, was published by Fremantle Press in 2010. It was launched by the Premier of Western Australia, Colin Barnett, in Victoria Hall.  Campaigns  The Society has led campaigns to prevent the loss of many significant buildings in Fremantle; not all have been successful. Some examples include: * The Oriana Cinema, an art deco building on the corner of High and Queen Streets (demolished in 1972) * Fremantle Markets * The proposed widening of High Street and demolition of all buildings along the south side of the road * Fremantle Prison * Victoria Quay development, which in 2014 was still under discussion Other projects have also been undertaken, such as the 1978–80 photographic survey of almost every building in Fremantle, and the Freopedia wikitown project. The group received assistance in the 1970s in the form of green bans organised by the Builders Labourers Federation.

Launched 1861, it lies along the Milan–Bologna railway. The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni. Train services are operated by Trenitalia. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company. Location Lodi railway station is located in Piazzale della Stazione, at the southern edge of the town centre. History The station at the turn of the twentieth century. The station was opened November 14, 1861, right after the Milan–Piacenza section of the Milan–Bologna railway was launched. It has undergone many changes after that. In the stations heyday, its goods yard was connected with a silk spinning mill a short distance away. This piece of rail connection was closed when the mill shut down. When further tracks were added, those destined to commuter traffic were increased to four. Around 2004, a fifth track was converted to passenger use. It was previously used mainly for overtaking goods trains on tracks 2 and 3. In the same period, the goods yard section facing Piazzale della Stazione was converted into a parking lot and into the terminal of coach lines run by LINE. The warehouse adjacent to Platform 1 suffered a similar fate. It was closed, and the area is now used as the LINE ticket office. Features View of the station yard. The passenger building is connected with all tracks (except the first, which is adjacent to it) by a pedestrian underpass. The platforms are equipped with shelters. The underpass was necessary because the Milan–Bologna railway is one of the busiest in Italy, and was particularly busy before the opening of the Milan–Bologna high-speed railway. The station yard has five tracks for passenger service, and a number of other tracks for the overtaking of goods trains waiting in the goods yard at the Bologna end of the station. Even tracks 1 and 4 are used for the overtaking of goods trains. Near the side street Via Spelta is an operating goods yard, where loads of milk are marshalled before leaving the station by rail. Passenger and train movements Lodi railway station has about four million passenger movements each year. Most of these movements are commuter trips to and from Milan. Lodi is a stop for most regional trains on the long distance Milan–Bologna and the Milan–Cremona–Mantua railways heading directly to Bologna Centrale, Parma, Mantua, Cremona; there are also regional train links with Livorno Centrale and Rimini. Shorter distance regional trains operate to and from Piacenza; these trains stop at all stations between Piacenza and Lodi, and then operate non stop to Milan. Other regional services heading towards Milan stop at Milano Rogoredo, Milano Porta Garibaldi, Milano Lambrate, Milano Centrale, Milano Greco Pirelli, Milano Certosa and Sesto San Giovanni. Also calling at Lodi are EuroStar City, InterCity, InterCityNight and express trains, on direct services to and from Napoli Centrale, Reggio Calabria Centrale, Crotone, Salerno, Bari Centrale, Terni, Rimini, Lecce and Milano Centrale. In addition to these connections, Lodi is now a terminus of line S1 of the Milan suburban railway service, which connects Lodi with Saronno via the loop through Milan. Interchange The station provides interchange with urban and suburban buses, and taxis.

History Michal Yannai at Arutz HaYeladim in 1992 The channel first launched in November 1989, as a part of Israeli cable's trial broadcasting prior to the 1990 official launch. At first the channel broadcast only two hours a day, and in its first two years was based primarily on purchased programs. In 1991, the channel began involving segments with human hosts and presenters. These segments grew to bigger live shows over the years and gave some of the presenters their tickets to stardom. The channel's growing popularity among children also led to many educational campaigns, regarding issues such as safety and tolerance. In 1996, the channel's content was transferred to the control of the new company \\"Noga Tikshoret\\" (\\"Venus communication\\"), and the channel updated its programming to more interactive nature while also adding more original programs - a direction that the channel is following to this day. In 2010, Cartoon Network became a television block on the channel appearing weekdays 11AM to 2PM, showing kids' shows from the channel dubbed in Hebrew. This happened because Cartoon Network's pan-European version was no longer available in Israel, having been removed years before the block's launch. The block was ended in 2019, when yes bought the rights of the shows. Oded Menashe, the last of the \\"original\\" presenters from the channel's first years, left in 2005 after 14 years; at the time no presenter had stayed longer at the channel. As of 2012, Menashe's record was surpassed by Tal Mosseri, who joined the channel in 1997 and left in mid-2015 after 18 years as a presenter. Besides Menashe, Museri and Kobi Machat, who joined the channel in 2000 and left in early 2012 after 12 years as a presenter, none of the other presenters, past or present, has ever stayed in the channel for more than nine consecutive years.

This pathway was first described by John Lowenstein, who outlined its importance in processes including amino acid catabolism and regulation of flux through glycolysis and the Krebs cycle. Outline The cycle is composed of three enzyme-catalysed reactions. The first stage is the deamination of the purine nucleotide Adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to form inosine monophosphate (IMP), catalysed by the enzyme AMP deaminase: :AMP + H2O → IMP + NH4+ The second stage is the formation of adenylosuccinate from IMP and the amino acid aspartate, which is coupled to the energetically favourable hydrolysis of GTP, and catalysed by the enzyme adenylosuccinate synthetase: :Aspartate + IMP + GTP → Adenylosuccinate + GDP + Pi Finally, Adenylosuccinate is cleaved by the enzyme adenylosuccinate lyase to release fumarate and regenerate the starting material of AMP: :Adenylosuccinate → AMP + Fumarate A recent study conducted by Sridharan et al. (AJP Cell Physiology, 2008, 295:C29-C37) showed that activation of HIF-1α allows cardiomyocytes to sustain mitochondrial membrane potential during anoxic stress by utilizing fumarate produced by adenylosuccinate lyase as an alternate terminal electron acceptor in place of oxygen. This mechanism should help provide protection in the ischemic heart. Occurrence This cycle occurs in Skeletal muscle myocyte's cytosolic compartment. This reaction helps to dispose AMP produced after following reaction. :ATP → ADP + Pi (Utilisation of ATP for Muscle contraction) 2 ADP → ATP + AMP (Catalysed by Adenylyl kinase/Myokinase) Purine nucleotide cycle occurs during strenuous exercise, fasting or starvation when ATP reservoirs run low. Consequences 1) Synthesis of fumarate Fumarate is an intermediate of TCA cycle and enters the mitochondria by converting into malate and utilising the malate shuttle where it is converted into Oxaloacetic acid (OAA). OAA either enters into TCA cycle or converts into aspartate in the mitochondria. Aspartate can re-enter purine nucleotide cycle. Oxaloacetic acid + Glutamate ↔ α-Ketoglutarate + Aspartate ( Catalysed by Aspartate Aminotransferase) 2) Synthesis of ammonia (Ammonia genesis) The glutamate produced by OAA as above gains an NH3 to become a Glutamine and enters the circulation to reach kidneys. In kidneys, glutamine is deaminated twice to form glutamate and then α Ketoglutarate. These NH3 molecules neutralise the organic acids (lactic acid and ketone bodies) produced in the muscles.

Hungary: Assorted Census Records, 1781-1850 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: The Generations Network, Inc., 2008. The tax was based on the German statute that a Jew was obliged to pay a certain tax to be \\"tolerated\\".Wine and thorns in Tokay Valley: Jewish life in Hungary : the history of Abaújszántó, by Zahava Szász Stessel, Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1995, p. 50-51 Under Maria Theresa (1740–1780) In 1747, during the reign of Empress Maria Theresa, the Jews of Hungary were taxed for the privilege of remaining in the empire, and were threatened with expulsion if they did not pay. On September 1, 1749, the delegates of the Hungarian Jews, except those from Szatmár County, assembled at Pressburg and met a royal commission, which informed them that they would be expelled from the country if they did not pay this tax. The frightened Jews at once agreed to do so; and the commission then demanded a yearly tax of 50,000 gulden. This sum being excessive, the delegates protested; and although the queen had fixed 30,000 gulden as the minimum tax, they were finally able to compromise on the payment of 20,000 gulden a year for a period of eight years. The delegates were to apportion this amount among the districts; the districts, their respective sums among the communities; and the communities, theirs among the individual members. The queen confirmed this agreement of the commission, except the eight-year clause, changing the period to three years, which she subsequently made five. The agreement, thus ratified by the queen, was brought on November 26 before the courts, which were powerless to relieve the Jews from the payment of this Malkegeld (queen's money), as they called it. The Jews, thus burdened by new taxes, thought the time ripe for taking steps to remove their oppressive disabilities. While still at Presburg the delegates had brought their grievances before the mixed commission that was called delegata in puncto tolerantialis taxae et gravaminum Judeorum commissio mixta. These complaints pictured the distress of the Jews of that time. They were not allowed to live in Croatia and Slavonia, in Baranya and Heves Counties, or in several free royal towns and localities; nor might they visit the markets there. At Stuhlweissenburg (Székesfehérvár) they had to pay a poll-tax of 1 gulden, 30 kreuzer if they entered the city during the day, if only for an hour. In many places they might not even stay overnight. They therefore begged permission to settle, or at least to visit the fairs, in Croatia and Slavonia and in those places from which they had been driven in consequence of the jealousy of the Greeks and the merchants. The Jews also had to pay heavier bridge-and ferry-tolls than the Christians; at Nagyszombat (Trnava) they had to pay three times the ordinary sum, namely, for the driver, for the vehicle, and for the animal drawing the same; and in three villages belonging to the same district they had to pay toll, although there was no toll-gate. Jews living on the estates of the nobles had to give their wives and children as pledges for arrears of taxes. In Upper Hungary they asked for the revocation of the Tolerance tax imposed by the chamber of Zips County (Szepes, Spiš), on the ground that otherwise the Jews living there would have to pay two such taxes; and they asked also to be relieved from a similar tax paid to the Diet. Finally, they requested that Jewish artisans might be allowed to follow their trades in their homes undisturbed. The commission laid these complaints before the Queen, indicating the manner in which they could be relieved; and their suggestions were subsequently willed by the queen and made into law. The queen relieved the Jews from the Tolerance tax in Upper Hungary only. In regard to the other complaints she ordered that the Jews should specify them in detail, and that the government should remedy them insofar as they came under its jurisdiction. The Tolerance tax had hardly been instituted when Michael Hirsch petitioned the government to be appointed primate of the Hungarian Jews in order to be able to settle difficulties that might arise among them, and to collect the tax. The government did not recommend Hirsch, but decided that in case the Jews should refuse to pay, it might be advisable to appoint a primate to adjust the matter. Before the end of the period of five years the delegates of the Jews again met the commission at Pressburg (Bratislava) and offered to increase the amount of their tax to 25,000 gulden a year if the queen would promise that it should remain at that sum for the next ten years. The queen had other plans, however; not only did she dismiss the renewed gravamina of the Jews, but rather imposed stiffer regulations upon them. Their tax of 20,000 gulden was increased to 30,000 gulden in 1760; to 50,000 in 1772; to 80,000 in 1778; and to 160,000 in 1813. The method of calculating the Tolerance tax varied over time and location, according to the size of household, occupation, and income-producing assets. Under Joseph II In 1783, Emperor Joseph II, the son of Maria Theresa, allowed Jews to settle in Pest, while enacting a tolerance tax, which the Jews had to pay to the town.The Virtual Jewish History Tour Budapest, By Rebecca Weiner After 1789, the Jews paid a tolerance tax of 4 guilder per family, a tax on kosher meat, a marriage tax, a tax on the synagogues and cemeteries of 100 guilder per year, and a quota tax of 50 guilder per year. In 1797, after the death of Joseph II, the tolerance tax and the taxes on homes and properties were replaced by a candle tax on Jewish religious candles.JewishGen, The History of the Jews of Rzeszow, Chapter 7, p. 47 In Croatia, Slavonia, and Dalmatia, further rights were granted to Jews in 1840, but the \\"tolerance tax\\" remained in force.

He was severely injured on 16 November 2007 in an IED incident in Afghanistan. As a result, his left leg was amputated. In November 2009, Mailloux redeployed to Afghanistan becoming the first Canadian amputee to deploy to a war zone as a combatant.  Early years  Born in 1983 and raised in Quebec City, Quebec, he is an alumnus of the Royal Military College of Canada (RMC) and the University of Glasgow. During the summer of 2005, he received an international exchange scholarship from the Canada Corps initiative launched by the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada on behalf of the Canadian International Development Agency. His research took place at the École de Maintien de la Paix, of Kulikovo, and the Institut de Recherche sur le Développement, of Bamako in Mali during four months.  Military career  Mailloux in Afghanistan Upon graduation, he was posted to the 3e Bataillon Royal 22e Régiment in Valcartier, Quebec and quickly joined the deploying formation as a platoon commander. Mailloux was injured by an IED explosion on 16 November 2007 which killed two soldiers, an interpreter and wounded several others. Mailloux underwent several surgeries and months of rehabilitation. Following this, he was appointed Aide de Camp to the Governor General of Canada at Rideau Hall in Ottawa and participated in the Presidential visit of Barack Obama to Ottawa, the 2009 visit to Haïti and the Emperor and Empress of Japan visit to Canada. In 2009, he joined the Task Force Kandahar Headquarters as a Brigade staff and later worked as a staff with the Counter-IED Task Force in Ottawa. In 2013, he was appointed as one of the honorary Aide-de-Camp to the Quebec Lieutenant-Governor. The Prime Minister of Canada announced a National Day of Honour to be held across Canada on the 9th of May 2014. This celebration was to mark the end of the mission in Afghanistan and the ceremony on Parliament Hill, presented live on all major news channels, was to be Emceed by Rick Hansen, Honorary Colonel, and a representative from the Canadian Forces. On the May 6, 2014, the Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced that Mailloux would be the second emcee for this national event. Harper mentioned that \\"Captain Mailloux’s unwavering commitment to duty, country and fellow Canadian Armed Forces Veterans has earned him tremendous respect and admiration among military personnel and across Canada. His true grit, strength, sacrifice and dedication are inspirational and serve to remind us all of the fortitude required to serve as a member of the Canadian Armed Forces.\\" He is currently serving in a unit with the Royal 22nd Regiment.  Media appearances  = Injured Soldier = Since February 2008, Mailloux appeared in many provincial and national media outlets explaining his experience and promoting the support of the Canadian Forces veterans. He was one of the first francophone soldier to be injured and played a similar role as Paul Franklin from Edmonton, who was injured in January 2006, in becoming a nationally known advocate for serving amputee soldiers. On 2 March 2008, he participated in the popular Quebec talk show Tout le Monde en Parle and was on the cover of the February 2008 edition of the magazine L'Actualité. Mailloux participated in the 2012 Army Run taking place in Ottawa, Canada and won first place of the 5 km run in the Amputee category. The prize was awarded by Peter Devlin, Commander of the Canadian Army. = Return to Afghanistan = When his return to Afghanistan was announced in September 2009 Mailloux made an appearance on the talk show Canada AM, the Quebec show Dumont 360, the cover of Le Soleil newspaper, CBC Newsworld, the Los Angeles Times and many others. Mailloux is also quoted in General Rick Hillier's book, A Soldier First, as a \\"young wounded lieutenant that asked if he could return with his comrades\\". Recently, Mailloux was heralded by a Winnipeg Free Press editorial as an example that a serious injury is not stopping a soldier from serving its country and that more place should be made for them. Many questions remained on the intention the CF wanted to achieve by sending Mailloux back in Afghanistan. = Remembrance Day 2013 = Mailloux was the guest of the George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight on CBC for Remembrance Day 2013. He was being interviewed on many different topics, but mainly to explain his story and what remembrance Day meant for him. On the same day, he was featured on the 24/60 show on Radio-Canada speaking on behalf of the injured. Mailloux was being filmed training in a gym.  Social involvement  Mailloux is frequently seen running the annual Army Run taking place in Ottawa along with other Canadian war veterans. He is also involved with the Canadian Forces Soldier On program in raising funds to buy adaptative equipment for wounded soldiers across the country. Mailloux has visited many injured soldiers in hospitals and rehabilitation centres in Edmonton, Quebec City and Ottawa and takes a continuing interest in activities for wounded soldiers. On 6 February 2012, Mailloux among other deserving Canadians received one of the first 60 diamond jubilee medal recognizing \\"his leadership within the Canadian Forces and his efforts to help the soldiers injured during the war in Afghanistan which were given by the Governor General and the Prime Minister of Canada. Mailloux was the gala dinner keynote speaker for the Canadian Institute for Military and Veterans Health Research (CIMVHR) during the 2013 Forum held in Edmonton. Mailloux was introduced by the Minister of Veterans Affairs, Julian Fantino, and \\"spoke about his experience with losing a limb in Afghanistan, how he was able to rehabilitate and eventually return to combat. His story was truly inspirational to all who attend the Forum.\\" The following year, Mailloux published an article in the Canadian Military Journal in which he make recommendations to improve the return to work programs for soldiers using lessons he learned during his rehabilitation. Mailloux's experience as an amputated serving soldier is respected among the Canadian Forces and many applaud his leadership in the care of our injured and veterans as is exemplified by his academic research and public work.

It is based in Northampton, England. Early brewing history A 19th-century poster for Phipps India Pale Ale showing the Northampton Brewery on Bridge Street, now the site of Carlsberg UK The company began in the South Northamptonshire town of Towcester where founder Pickering Phipps started brewing in 1801. A second brewery was opened on Bridge Street, Northampton in 1817. All production was moved to Northampton in 1901 following a fire which destroyed the original brewery. Trading as P. Phipps & Co. under the chairmanship of Pickering Phipps II (1836–1890), the company grew to become the largest brewer in the Midlands by the end of the 19th century. The Phipps family was prominent in Northampton in the 19th and early 20th century; both Pickering I and II were mayors and the latter an MP. An area of the town to the east of the racecourse was developed by the family and is known as Phippsville. Other regional brewers absorbed by Phipps included, Ratliffe and Jeffery of Northampton in 1899, Hipwell and Co. of Olney in 1920, T.Mannings of Northampton in 1933 and Campbell Praed of Wellingborough in 1954. In 1957, P. Phipps merged with neighbours, Northampton Brewery Co. Ltd. At this point, the company had 1131 tied houses (pubs), 711 from Phipps and 420 from NBC. In 1960, London based brewer Watney Mann launched a successful bid for the company. The new owner's keg bitter, Red Barrel, was developed by being brewed in Northampton alongside the local beers. However, to ensure a consistent product, Watneys shipped up tanker loads of water from the Mortlake Brewery in London where the eventual mass production occurred, By 1968, all traditional draught bitters were axed and the company renamed Watney Mann (Midland) Ltd. The general spread of keg bitter in the late 1960s, and in particular Watney's treatment of Northamptonshire drinkers, were key spurs to the formation of the Campaign for Real Ale in 1971. Since Phipps NBC had dominated its trading area, Watney's removal of all traditional hand pumps from its Midland pub estate led to CAMRA describing Northamptonshire as a real ale desert. At the beginning of the 1970s, a partnership was formed between Watney Mann and Danish brewer Carlsberg Group with the aim of rebuilding the Phipps Bridge Street Brewery site into a modern lager plant. Watney Mann ale and stout brewing ended on 26 May 1974, and most of the original brewery was demolished. Above ground the relatively modern office block was retained as part of Carlsberg's brewery, renamed Jacobsen House albeit they said retention was to be short term. To accommodate the new brewery, a number of the branches of the fragmented River Nene were rerouted thus ending the pattern of waterways which had existed on maps since at least 1610. Below ground the giant Foundry Street well under the old Albion Brewery stables (which Phipps had enlarged to form the principal water source for the site) was incorporated into the new lager brewery. There is also a nondescript green shed in the old stonewall along nearby Victoria Promenade which houses a pump from another well. The Watney regional office relocated to a purpose-built office and distribution centre across town in New Duston. Pub chain history Following the closure of the Phipps Bridge Street brewery, head brewer Noel \\"Dusty\\" Miller initially transferred to Carlsberg as deputy head brewer along with many brewery workers and office staff. After just two years, he left to take up the Production Director's post at Ruddles Brewery in Oakham. His deputy and final head brewer, Bill Urquhart, founded the country's first microbrewery in 1974, Litchborough, based in the Northamptonshire village of the same name. Other former Bridge Street brewers rose to prominence in the industry in the following decades; Pat Heron became head brewer at Hall and Woodhouse, Bob Hipwell and Peter Mauldon remained in the Grand Met empire, although the latter eventually returned to Suffolk to revive his family brewery, Mauldons. Phipps's chief chemist, Mike Henson, became Carlsberg UK's first chief chemist. The company continued trading as a Northampton-based pub chain, using the title \\"Mann's Northampton Brewery Co.\\" after 1977. This became \\"Manns and Norwich Breweries\\" after 1987 following the incorporation of another of Grand Met's pub chains into the business. Ownership passed from Grand Metropolitan, who had taken over Watney Mann in 1971, through the Courage division of Foster's Group from 1992 to '95 when Scottish and Newcastle (S&N;) purchased Courage. From this point some of the group's pubs traded under the Chef & Brewer brand. In November 2003, S&N; began selling off its British pub estates and many former Phipps properties were bought by the Spirit Group, later Punch Taverns. Return to brewing The pub chain's Northampton managers had been preparing to re-introduce a Phipps draught bitter at the time of the S&N; sale and took the opportunity to take over the dormant company name and trademark. Draught Phipps IPA was re-launched in December 2008. This was followed by NBC's Red Star, Ratliffe's Celebrated Stout in 2009 and Phipps Diamond Ale in 2012. The beers were brewed from original recipes at Grainstore brewery, Oakham under the supervision of a number of old Phipps brewers. The key figure amongst these was Pat Heron, an NBC and Phipps NBC brewer from 1954 to 1966 before becoming head brewer at Hall and Woodhouse In early 2014 the company returned production to Northampton by restoring and back converting the Albion Brewery on Kingswells Street. It was built in 1884 by Ratliffe and Jeffery and was part of the Phipps's empire from 1899 to 1919. Following removal of the original brewery plant, the building produced lemonade and then from 1954 to 2011 housed a tannery. Brewing started again in March 2014, just under 40 years since the closure of Phipps's original brewery in the town.Northampton Chronicle & Echo 25 July 2013 In August 2015, the Albion Bar opened its doors every day in the brewery.Risen from the grave: beers Watney killed are restored to their Northampton home, Protz On Beer, Monday, December 15th 2014 The former Ratliffe & Jeffery then P.Phipps & Co Albion Brewery, Kingswell Street, Northampton, England Other names * Mann's Northampton Brewery Co from 1977 * Mann's & Norwich Breweries from 1987 Constituent businesses Before purchase by Watney Mann in 1960: * Pickering Phipps founded 1801 * Ratliffe & Jeffery absorbed 1899 * Hipwell & Co 1920 * T Manning 1933 * Campbell Praed 1954 * Northampton Brewery Co 1957 See also * List of breweries in England References *Brewed In Northants by Mike Brown with Brian Willmott.

During summer it has artificial turf and is used for association football, while during winter it has artificial ice and fields bandy. The complex also contains a smaller training field with gravel during summer and natural ice during winter. Gressbanen is the home venue of IF Ready, whose bandy team plays in the Norwegian Bandy Premier League and who fields 35 recreational football teams. The stadium was built as a response to the need for a grass pitch for the Norway national football team, as well as to serve as a home to Ready and Mercantile SFK. It opened on 1 September 1918 as the second grass pitch in Norway and the first in Oslo. As such it replaced Frogner Stadion as the home of the national team, for which it was home to seventeen matches. The national team moved to Ullevaal Stadion in 1927. Gressbanen also featured two Norwegian Football Cup Final, in 1920 and 1921. The pitch has been iced and used for bandy since 1935. Mercantile remained a tenant until 1947, when it merged with SFK Trygg. Gressbanen received artificial turf in 2001 and artificial ice in 2004. History During the 1910s there were no grass football pitches in Norway. At the time the only proper football fields in Oslo were Bislett Stadion and Frogner Stadion, the latter which was at first used by the national team.Larsen: 82 The Football Association of Norway took initiative in 1911 to study the possibility for a grass field and conducted visits to Idrætsparken in Copenhagen and Stockholm Olympic Stadium to investigate how the neighboring capitals had resolved the issue.Larsen: 83 The main concern was that a grass field located in the Norwegian climate would not survive the winter. Also financing was a challenge, as none of the local clubs, nor the federation, had capital to construct a grass venue. In 1914 the Norway national team had lost 7–0 against Sweden on the grass pitch at Råsunda Stadium, with the press stating that \\"grass has become our ruin\\", pointing out how the Norwegian players were unable to handle the wet surface.Larsen: 84 Gressbanen's grandstand in 1925 The initiative to build a grass field at Holmen came from M. W. Aas, who had visited Vienna in 1915 and had observed the possibilities created there. He gained the support from Mercantile SFK and later also Ready. To construct the venue the limited company A/S Græsbanen was incorporated on 3 April 1916 with a share capital of 42,000 Norwegian krone (NOK). Ready and Mercantile appointed an equal number of board members in the company.Andersen: 381 Stavanger Stadion opened with Norway's first grass pitch in 1917. The success of the 1917 Cup Final demonstrated the qualities of a grass field and resulted in NFF establishing a fund which could lend money to clubs intending to build a grass pitch.Larsen: 85 Gressbanen was the first venue to be lent money through the arrangement, receiving funding for the stands. As the first grass field in the capital, Gressbanen was also selected as the home venue of the national team.Larsen: 86 Construction was supported financially by among others NFF president Daniel Eie and director Johan Throne Holst. The lot, at the time in Aker, was owned by shipowner Olaf Ditlev- Simonsen and donated the land to the company. He also paid for a road, water and sewer line to the venue.Andersen: 381–382 The official opening of Gressbanen took place on 1 September 1918, in front of an audience of 10,000. The opening match was between a combined Kristiania team and AIK from Stockholm.Andersen: 382 The venue was inaugurated as a national stadium the following year. NFF remained a tenant at Gressbanen until 1926, when it moved its games to the newly constructed Ullevaal Stadion, which also served as the home of Lyn.Larsen: 88 Gressbanen was iced for the first time in 1932.Stang: 47 The combination of natural grass and natural ice gave poor conditions for both bandy and football players. Lack of refrigeration caused the ice to only lay during the coldest part of the winter. The ice took its toll on the grass, causing it to not have grown properly until midway through the summer season. Increased population further raised the number of recreational teams which played on the field, causing further wear as 35 teams were scheduled to play on the two fields. Ready therefore took initiative to upgrade the venue as a combined artificial turf and artificial ice stadium, similar to the solution chosen at Skien Isstadion. Oslo Municipality granted NOK 7.7 million for the first part of construction in March 2000, which in addition to other funding secured the necessary NOK 13.4 million for the first stage. This consisted of the laying of refrigeration tubes under the soil and the artificial turf. The construction of pumps and cooling central was delayed till the second stage. The first stage opened on 18 August 2001. The artificial ice facilities were completed in 2004. Thus Gressbanen was the third bandy field in Oslo to receive artificial ice and the eleventh overall in Norway. Facilities Gressbanen consists of two playing fields and is located in the Holmen neighborhood of Vestre Aker in Oslo. The venues are owned by Oslo Municipality and operated by Ready. The larger venue features artificial turf during summer and artificial ice during winter, while the smaller venue has gravel during summer and natural ice during winter. The main surface measures , while the smaller field measures . Both are illuminated at 100 lux. The main field is one of nineteen artificial bandy rinks in Norway. Football is played from early March through the end of October, while the field is iced for bandy from 1 November to early March. Events An international football match in 1925 Ready playing a Norwegian Bandy Premier League match against Ullevål IL in 2011 Two cup finals have been held at Gressbanen. The 1920 edition saw Ørn- Horten beat Frigg 1–0 in front of 14,000 spectators. The following year Frigg took revenge by beating Odd 2–0 in front of 20,000 spectators. The venue was the home of the Norway national football team from 1919 to 1926, with an additional match played in 1927. The stadium's record attendance of 20,000 took place at the 14 September 1924 match against Denmark. { class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" + International matches ! scope=col  Date ! scope=col  Opponent ! scope=col  Score ! scope=col  Attendance ! scope=col class=unsortable  Ref - style=\\"background: #CCFFCC;\\" ! scope=row style=\\"background: #CCFFCC;\\"   Sweden  4–3  align=right   align=center  - style=\\"background: #FFFFCC;\\" ! scope=row style=\\"background: #FFFFCC;\\"   Netherlands  1–1  align=right   align=center  - style=\\"background: #CCFFCC;\\" ! scope=row style=\\"background: #CCFFCC;\\"   Denmark  3–2  align=right   align=center  - style=\\"background: #FFFFCC;\\" ! scope=row style=\\"background: #FFFFCC;\\"   Denmark  1–1  align=right   align=center  - style=\\"background: #FFCCCC;\\" ! scope=row style=\\"background: #FFCCCC;\\"   Sweden  0–3  align=right   align=center  - style=\\"background: #CCFFCC;\\" ! scope=row style=\\"background: #CCFFCC;\\"   Finland  3–2  align=right   align=center  - style=\\"background: #CCFFCC;\\" ! scope=row style=\\"background: #CCFFCC;\\"   Sweden  3–1  align=right   align=center  - style=\\"background: #FFCCCC;\\" ! scope=row style=\\"background: #FFCCCC;\\"   Sweden  0–5  align=right   align=center  - style=\\"background: #CCFFCC;\\" ! scope=row style=\\"background: #CCFFCC;\\"   Finland  3–0  align=right   align=center  - style=\\"background: #FFFFCC;\\" ! scope=row style=\\"background: #FFFFCC;\\"   Switzerland  2–2  align=right   align=center  - style=\\"background: #FFCCCC;\\" ! scope=row style=\\"background: #FFCCCC;\\"   Sweden  2–3  align=right   align=center  - style=\\"background: #FFCCCC;\\" ! scope=row style=\\"background: #FFCCCC;\\"   Germany  0–2  align=right   align=center  - style=\\"background: #FFCCCC;\\" ! scope=row style=\\"background: #FFCCCC;\\"   Denmark  1–3  align=right   align=center  - style=\\"background: #CCFFCC;\\" ! scope=row style=\\"background: #CCFFCC;\\"   Finland  1–0  align=right   align=center  - style=\\"background: #FFCCCC;\\" ! scope=row style=\\"background: #FFCCCC;\\"   Sweden  3–7  align=right   align=center  - style=\\"background: #FFFFCC;\\" ! scope=row style=\\"background: #FFFFCC;\\"   Denmark  1–1  align=right   align=center  - style=\\"background: #FFCCCC;\\" ! scope=row style=\\"background: #FFCCCC;\\"   Sweden  3–5  align=right   align=center  } References Bibliography  External links * Gressbanen - Nordic Stadiums Category:Football venues in Norway Category:Norwegian Cup Final venues Category:Bandy venues in Norway Category:Sports venues in Oslo Category:Norway national football team Category:Sports venues completed in 1918 Category:1918 establishments in Norway ","title":"Gressbanen"},{"id":"30494867","title":"The Goodies videography"},{"id":"30494874","text":"The TIGR Plant Transcript Assemblies database is a repository of sequences collected for the construction of transcript assemblies.

Eastern Han (25-220 AD) Chinese stone-carved que pillar gates of Dingfang, Zhong County, Chongqing that once belonged to a temple dedicated to the Warring States era general Ba Manzi An ancestral shrine, hall or temple ( or , Vietnamese: Nhà thờ họ), also called lineage temple, is a temple dedicated to deified ancestors and progenitors of surname lineages or families in the Chinese tradition. Ancestral temples are closely linked to Confucian philosophy and culture and the emphasis that it places on filial piety. A common central feature of the ancestral temples are the ancestral tablets that embody the ancestral spirits.Edward L. Davis (Editor), Encyclopedia of Contemporary Chinese Culture, Routledge, 2004 The ancestral tablets are typically arranged by seniority of the ancestors. Altars and other ritual objects such as incense burners are also common fixtures. Ancestors and gods can also be represented by statues. The temples are used for collective rituals and festivals in honor of the ancestors but also for other family- and community-related functions such as weddings and funerals. Sometimes, they serve wider community functions such as meetings and local elections. In traditional weddings, the ancestral temple serves a major symbolic function, completing the transfer of a woman to her husband's family. During the wedding rites, the bride and groom worship at the groom's ancestral shrine, bowing as follows: #first bow - Heaven and Earth #second bow - ancestors #third bow - parents #fourth bow - spouse Three months after the marriage, the wife undertakes worship at the husband's ancestral shrine, in a rite known as miaojian (廟見). In mainland China, ancestral temples along with other temples have often been \\"secularized\\" to serve as village schools or granaries during the land reform of the 1950s and the Cultural Revolution. They have experienced a revival since the economic liberalization of the 1980s. The revival of the ancestral temples has been particularly strong in southern China where lineage organization had stronger roots in the local culture and local communities are more likely to have members living overseas who can support rebuilding of the shrines through donations.

An ancestral death anniversary will be held yearly at nhà thờ họ and this anniversary is usually used as an occasion to renew the relationship between clan members.  In other religions and cultures  Ancestral shrines or similar concepts are also common in other religions and cultures. Especially other East and Southeast Asian but also traditional African religions have ancestral shrines and or tombs. Ancestor worship is an important and common element in native African religions and is still common and practiced by followers of folk religions but also Christian and Muslim Africans.

History Dallas Center Air Force Station was established as part of the planned deployment by Air Defense Command of forty-four Mobile radar stations across the United States to support the permanent Radar network established during the Cold War for air defense of the United States. This deployment had been projected to be operational by mid-1952. The site consisted of a total of 38.92 acres fee by purchase and condemnation and no- area license by donation made between March 1954 and November 1956. Funding, constant site changes, construction, and equipment delivery delayed deployment. Improvements at the site consisted of: Radar station; traffic check house; power building; mess hall; administration building; two supply buildings; 65-man airmen's barracks; base auto shop; water storage and pump house; above and underground storage tanks; sanitary sewer system; streets, drives, sidewalks, and parking areas. Operational status was achieved in 1956 after the 650th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was moved to Dallas Center on 1 July 1955 with an AN/TPS-1D radar that had been moved in from Fort Snelling, Minnesota, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. The construction of the buildings were almost all wood or sheetrock. Budget cuts forced Dallas Center AFS to cease operations in mid-1957 and the tending 650th AC&W; Squadron was inactivated shortly thereafter. The site was then converted to an unmanned AN/FPS-18 gap-filler radar annex (P-71C) for Omaha AFS, Nebraska. It was finally inactivated in December 1957. GSA reported excess 38.23 acres fee on October 30, 1959, and then quitclaimed it to a private party on March 7, 1961, reserving road and utility line easement to the 3.15 acres. Relatives of the private party still own the 38.92 acres, which include the site and access, on which the manned radar station was located. Both buildings and radar tower are still extant, the site now being used for Greenhouses for truck crops and as an auto junkyard. In 1988, the owners stated only two structures remain and all the above ground storage tanks have been removed.

The species was first described by James Francis Stephens in 1831. It is found in large parts of the Palearctic realm. Its wingspan is 19–28 mm. The ground colour of the forewings is ochreous. The forewings have a dark-coloured central band. They are very variable in size, pattern and colouring. The large white or whitish spot in the middle of the distal margin distinguishes M. taeniata from its nearest allies. There is one generation per year with adults on wing in July and August. The larvae probably feed on various moss species in the wild, but have been reared on various plants, such as Taraxacum officinale, Stellaria media and Polygonum aviculare. The larvae can be found from August to June. The species overwinters in the larval stage.

The canal was then extended to Oxford by Banbury's engineer, John Barnes in 1790. Both Parker's Wharf and Bridge Wharf were serviced by fly-boats to many distant cross-country destinations and by market boats to Oxford and Coventry. The canal brought much growth and prosperity to Banbury over the years and is still popular with boat users today.Banbury Canalside Vision, UK. Tooley's is the oldest continuous working dry dock in Britain and was established to build and repair the wooden horse-drawn narrow boats which regularly travelled up and down the newly constructed Oxford Canal network. This is why it was so vital to the development of the Industrial Revolution in Banbury. Over the years road haulage and the railways eroded away the importance of the canals, although they regained their local importance during the Second World War. Tooley's was lately immortalised in Tom Rolt's popular 1944 book Narrow boat, which was re- released in the 1990s when the boatyard's future was threatened. The yard kept on working up until 1995, and is a scheduled Ancient Monument and run by a private company in trust.Tooley's Boatyard, Days Out Guide, UK. Its fully restored workshops date from the 1930s and include a carpenter's store, a steam-powered belt-driven machine workshop, a paint store and a 200-year-old forge where a blacksmith pursues his trade.

It is open to two groups: public-sector employees (and their families) and members of registered professional groups (and their families). Peter John O’Sullivan, a Jesuit priest who founded the Jamaica Co- operative Credit Union League and a number of credit unions) was instrumental in its development under its first president (D.V. Jerry Smith) and treasurer (S. Kellog Wilson). Wilson served briefly, and was succeeded in 1947 by Austin E. McClaren. Membership was first restricted to GSB clerks, excluding managers and executives of the bank and leading to a low influx of capital and a high demand for loans. Despite this, in 1950 GSB Clerks was the first credit union to accumulate £1,000 in deposits. In March 1948 its members amended the rules to include all civil servants, spouses, children and the staffs of statutory boards and public corporations. In 1997, as part of amendments to its bond its name was changed to its present name.  Bond  The credit union's bond of association has widened to include members' brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews, aunts, uncles and parents. In 1950 GSB was the first credit union in Jamaica (and the Caribbean) to contract with the CUNA Mutual Insurance Society to protect members' savings and loans, standard for all credit unions. In 1954 it rented offices at the Teachers Mutual Aid Society Building at 28 Duke Street, hiring Horace Abrahams as the first general manager of a Jamaican credit union. During the late 1960s the office moved to the residence of Walter Brown (canon of All Saints Anglican Church) at 10 East Avenue, Kingston Gardens. Brown's residence was rebuilt as the head office in 1974; in 1986 it was renamed in memory of the credit union's first president, D. V. (Jerry) Smith. Expansions GSB acquired the portfolio of neighbouring Metropolis Cooperative Credit Union (formerly Lands Clerks Co-operative Credit Union Society, with a membership of 1,862) in December 1999, and acquired the assets of the Kingston and St. Andrew Credit Unions (with about 500 members) in June 2003. In June 2001 GSB opened its first branch office at 20 Dominica Drive, New Kingston. In 2010, the membership agreed to expand its bond to members of professional associations. GSB has three branches: at Kingston Gardens, New Kingston and May Pen, Clarendon. Leadership GSB's president is Michael Roofe, and the CEO is Courtney Lodge. They are supported by a board of six members and a management team of seven. Roofe has been president since 2008, and Lodge has been CEO since 2010. Member ownership Like all credit unions, GSB is owned by its members and run by a president and board (elected annually at a general meeting). The volunteer board implements the mandate of the members.

During his 24 years in the United States Navy, Rhee served as a battlefield casualty physician in Afghanistan and Iraq. Formerly a Professor of Surgery and the Chief of Trauma, Critical Care, and Burn and Emergency Surgery at the University of Arizona College of Medicine until 2016, he now serves as the Chief of Acute Care Surgery and as Medical Director of the Marcus Trauma Center at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. He rose to national prominence when he served as the attending physician to U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, as well as other victims, following the 2011 Tucson shooting. Biography =Early life and education= Born in Seoul, South Korea, Rhee lived for several years in Uganda as his father, also a doctor, worked in the Peace Corps. The elder Rhee moved the family to the United States when his son was 10 to get a better education. The family was raised in a small Pennsylvania town, south of Pittsburgh. His father was an anesthesiologist at Uniontown Hospital. The younger Rhee graduated in 1979 from Laurel Highlands High School in Fayette County. In 1983, he received his Bachelor of Science degree in Health Systems Engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology. In 1987, Rhee earned his medical degree from the Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences F. Edward Hebert School of Medicine. He also earned a master's degree in Public Health from the University of Washington Department of Health Services. In 1999, he earned a diploma in Medical Care of Catastrophes from the Society of Apothecaries of London. =Military service= Rhee was one of the first battlefield surgeons to be deployed at Camp Rhino in Afghanistan. Rhee is a 24-year veteran of the U.S. Navy. During a trip to China in 1998, he was selected to accompany U.S. President Bill Clinton as his designated surgeon. In 2001, Rhee became one of the first American military surgeons to be deployed in Afghanistan at Camp Rhino, the first forward operating base to be established during Operation Enduring Freedom. In 2005, Rhee was deployed to Iraq, where he established the first surgical unit in Ramadi. His service awards include the Defense Meritorious Service Medal and the Navy Commendation Medal. Rhee publicly expressed his preference for QuikClot as a hemostatic agent. As the Director of the Navy Trauma Training Center at Los Angeles County+USC Medical Center, Rhee became involved in an interbranch disagreement between the Army and Navy regarding the adoption of new hemostatic agents designed for battlefield treatment of severe bleeding. While the Army had adopted blood-clotting bandage called HemCon, the Navy and Marines instead opted for a different product called QuikClot. After testing HemCon at the Navy Trauma Training Center, Rhee concluded in December 2005: \\"I've tried every one of these products, many times, on many different kinds of wounds. For big-time bleeding - and that's what we're really worrying about here - HemCon doesn't work.\\" Though Rhee preferred QuikClot, he expressed reservations over its commercialization in 2003 because of the potential for misuse by untrained consumers. Rhee was appointed as Professor of Surgery and Molecular Cellular Biology at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences and continues to consult for the Office of Naval Research and the Marine Corps War Fighting Laboratory. =Civilian medical career= Rhee worked in the trauma centers at the Harborview Medical Center in Seattle and the Washington Hospital Center in Washington, D.C. In September 2007, he became the Chief of Trauma and Critical Care and Professor of Surgery at the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona. By that time, he had published over 200 articles in medical journals. In July 2009, the University Medical Center was designated a Level 1 Trauma Center by the American College of Surgeons. Rhee stated that the center had become ranked among the top 10 in the nation. 2011 Tucson shooting In January 2011, Rhee became the subject of national media attention as the attending trauma physician for U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who had been shot in the head near Tucson. Rhee was out jogging at the time of the shooting and had to rush three miles home and go to the hospital. Rhee also held press conferences to update the public on her condition. Upon observing that Giffords was still able to squeeze a doctor's hand, which most gunshot victims are unable to do, he became confident of her chances. Rhee remarked, \\"She has a 101 percent chance of surviving. She will not die. On January 12, 2011, Rhee was met with cheers as he arrived at the McKale Center, while still dressed in scrubs and a white coat from the medical center, for a memorial speech by U.S. President Barack Obama. Rhee was also invited to sit with First Lady Michelle Obama during a joint session of the United States Congress for the 2011 State of the Union Address on January 25. In his memoir TRAUMA RED: The Making of a Surgeon in War and in America's Cities, Rhee recalled that \\"challenging, exhausting, exhilarating, frustrating, heartbreaking, satisfying, bloody, bloody, bloody day at the office,\\" and the path that led him there. From his youth in South Korea and Uganda—where he once watched his surgeon father remove a spear from a man's belly—to frontline surgery in Iraq and Afghanistan, to trauma centers on the urban battlefields of Los Angeles and Washington, D.C..Scribner, a division of Simon & Schuster; June 3, 2014; 978-1-4767-2729-5 \\"It took a long time to be convinced that I should write this book,\\" Rhee stated. He felt that the book would be looked upon as being egotistical by his professional peers. He states that he wrote the book to document from the medical provider point of view what actually happened when Congresswoman was shot in the brain and so that others could learn what a trauma surgeon is. =Personal life= Rhee met his wife, Emily, as he was completing his residency at the University of California, Irvine. They have two children. On October 13, 2011, Rhee and his wife attended the State Dinner for the Korean President. On May 12, 2012, Rhee delivered the commencement speech to the University of Arizona Class of 2012. The theme of the speech was \\"Today is a Good Day.\\" He spoke primarily about his experiences traveling, why today is a good day, and how to look at things optimistically. In April 2012, Rhee was selected as the Hometown Hero for the Thunder and Lightning over Arizona open house at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. Rhee was able to fly with the Thunderbirds in an F-16 Fighting Falcon Jet.

Hofbauer – (1903–1985) was an illustrator famous especially for his advertisements for Simpsons of Piccadilly and Astor Cigarettes. His art was perfectly representing the fashion of the 1950s and 1960s in Western Europe and North America. He was born in Vienna. Biography =Early years= Hoff studied portrait and landscape painting at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, where he had begun to make a name for himself through his stage and costume illustrations. A number of his fashion designs had been published under the alias Max Hof in the European journal International Textiles, where Alec Simpson – the owner of Simpsons of Piccadilly – saw them. Ad for Simpsons 1959 =Simpsons of Piccadilly= In 1936 Alec Simpson brought Hoff – at the age of 33 – to London, and commissioned him to produce a series of illustrations of handsome, virile, sporting men - wearing Simpson clothes - that were to become the representation of Simpson style for a quarter of a century (joined – once Simpson Piccadilly added women's clothes to its stock – by fashionable, elegant and charming women). First used in the direct mail brochures, Hoff's illustrations soon became the mainstay of Simpson advertising. Bill Crawford - the advertising agent of Simpson's - recognized the power of this imagery, and when Hitler annexed Austria in 1938 Crawford persuaded Max Hoff to move to London, where he married Margarete Popper in December of the same year and where his two children were born. His drawings of groups of impeccably dressed and homosocial male figures, virtually always depicted in a smiling and relaxed attitude, became the signature style of Simpson’s and DAKS men’s wear press advertising right up until the early 1960s. FeWa ad from 1958 =FeWa and Astor Cigarettes= Already at the end of the 1950s Hoff started to work with the German advertisement agency Hanns W. Brose GmbH and its enigmatic owner Hanns Walter Brose in Frankfurt am Main. In 1958 a small campaign of only eight ads - due to a limited budget of Böhme Fettchemie GmbH - his illustrations were advertising FeWa FeinWaschmittel (fine washing powder). As the work with Brose was going very well and Simpson's decided to rebrand their advertisement, Hoff finished his work with Simpson's and from 1961 on became an exclusive advertisement artist for the Hanns W. Brose GmbH. This happened due to the fact that Hanns W. Brose - who had an advertising contract for Reemtsma's Astor Cigarettes for some years – wanted to acquire a second contract with another cigarette trademark of Reemtsma Haus Neuerburg. Therefore, in 1956 he agreed with Philipp F. Reemtsma to transfer the Astor contract to his branch office in Hamburg, managed by Brose's son Heinz Martin. In 1961 Heinz Martin Brose decided to provide a new style for their ad campaign for Astor Cigarettes. So has started Hoff's most famous campaign called Rendezvous der Prominenz, which ran until 1967. It was directed first at the German and then at the international high society. Max Hoff has provided far over 200 pictures for this series. Astor ad from 1963 References * \\"The British Tradition.

Credit: Wellcome LibraryCharles Brook (1814–1872), was an English businessman and philanthropist. Life Brook was born 18 November 1814, in Upperhead Row, Huddersfield, West Riding of Yorkshire, England. His father, James Brook, was member of the large banking and cotton-spinning firm of Jonas Brook Brothers at Meltham. Charles Brook lived with his father, who in 1831 had moved to Thornton Lodge; and by 1840 he became partner in the firm. He made many improvements in the machinery, and showed remarkable business talents. He strenuously refused to let his goods measure fewer yards than was indicated by his labels, and he was bent on promoting the welfare of the two thousand hands in his employ. He knew them nearly all by sight, went to see them when ill, and taught their children in the Sunday school which he superintended for years (Huddersfield Examiner, vol. xx. No. 1471). He laid out a park-like retreat, which he himself planned, for his workpeople at Meltham, and built them a handsome dining-hall and concert-room, with a spacious swimming-bath underneath. His best-known gift is the Convalescent Home at Huddersfield, in the grounds of which again he was his own landscape gardener, the whole costing £40,000. He was constantly erecting or enlarging churches, schools, infirmaries, cottages, curates' houses, etc., in Huddersfield, Meltham, and the district; and on purchasing Enderby Hall, Leicestershire, in 1865, with large estates adjoining, costing £150,000, he rebuilt Enderby church and the stocking-weavers' insanitary cottages. He died at Enderby Hall, of pleurisy and bronchitis, 10 July 1872, aged 57. A portrait of him, by Samuel Howell, is in the Huddersfield Convalescent Home. In 1860 Brook married a daughter of John Sunderland Hirst of Huddersfield. In politics he was a conservative. Mrs Brook (died 3 February 1879) survived him; but they left no family.

Life Brookbank was the son of George Brookbank of Halifax; at Michaelmas term 1632, when he entered Brasenose College, Oxford as a batler (poor scholar), he was aged twenty. He graduated B.A. and took orders. In the Bodleian is the printed petition to the king, in September 1647, from John Brookbank and thirty-three other ministers, expelled from Ireland by the rebels. This John is probably identical with the subject of this article, who is called John on the title-pages of his Vitis Salutaris (1650) and Compleat School-Master (1660). In 1650 Brookbank described himself as \\"at present preacher of the word\\" at West Wycombe (he spells it Wickham). Buckinghamshire. It is probable that he was settled at Wycombe at the date (1648) of his sermon on the Saints' Imperfection, and possible that he replaced Peel there, silenced either at High or West Wycombe on 16 January 1640. Brookbank in 1651 was \\"presbyter and schoolmaster in Vine Court, in High Holborn\\" where his books were to be bought. At this date he speaks of Sir Edward Richards, knt., and his wife as patrons. In 1654 he was \\"minister and schoolmaster in Jerusalem Court, in Fleet Street\\". By 1657 he had lost both employments, and on 4 July 1660 (while living in George Alley, Shoe Lane) he expressed his gratitude to Sir Jeremiah Whitchcot. It is possible that he was the I. B. who, early in 1665, published A Tast of Catechetical-Preaching- Exercise for the instruction of families. The writer speaks of himself as aged, and proposes a plan of religious services for the young. His name appears as Brookbank in his earliest publication; afterwards as Brooksbank, Brooksbanke, Brookesbanke, and on one of his title-pages as Broksbank. He Latinises it into Riparius. His Christian name is sometimes printed Jo., and this is expanded into John by mistake. The explanation which he gives of his distance from the press may account for some of the variations in his title- pages.

Baja California Territory (Territorio de Baja California) was a Mexican territory from 1824 to 1931, that encompassed the Baja California Peninsula of present-day northwestern Mexico.

Along with Alta California, the two territories were split from the Spanish The Californias region. In 1931 Baja California Territory was divided into \\"North Territory of Baja California\\" and \\"Territory of Baja California Sur\\".

Province Marker of the historical northern border with Alta California Baja California's northern border with Alta California was first established to demarcate areas of Franciscan and Dominican missionary authority, precisely set on August 19, 1773, near San Juan Bautista Creek by Fray Francisco Palóu. A marker stands on the line formerly dividing the two countries. The marker is behind the ruins of Misión San Miguel Arcángel de la Frontera, in La Misión, Baja California. Palóu's line was adopted as the provincial dividing line in 1804. In 1848, under the Treaty of Guadalupe- Hidalgo, this international border was shifted further north to San Diego Bay, adjusting it to the claim of Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo and the \\"sea-to-sea\\" claims of Sir Francis Drake and of the former colony of South Carolina.

It is located along the Mediterranean Sea at the current city of Carthage, near the archaeological site of the ancient city, fifteen kilometers from Tunis. A house by Le Corbusier sits within the site. Complex The palace complex has four parts: the palace proper, consisting of the central building and a private wing housing two apartments, a building for presidential security and two other buildings, one of which is used for common, administrative and financial services. and general. Within the complex is the residence of the Swiss ambassador, a building ceded by Bourguiba after an attempted coup in 1962, as well as the archaeological site called \\"fountain with a thousand amphorae\\". History Habib Bourguiba was the first resident of the palace. Originally, the palace park shelters a residence of Mustapha Khaznadar. Became the property of an Italian in 1937, the residence was occupied by the Allies of World War II in 1943, then became the residence of the Secretary General of the Tunisian government, a French official responsible for controlling the ministers and the government of the Bey of Tunis. Chosen by Bourguiba as the place of residence after the Essaâda palace in La Marsa, it replaces another palace in Carthage, located at the bottom of the hill, which was the main residence of the last bey of Tunis. After the independence of Tunisia, Habib Bourguiba built a palace there according to his ambitions and to the extent of cult of his personality. It is enough to see the Bourguiba collection of numerous works to the glory of the leader, found in the basement of the palace and shown on Tunisian television after the 2011 revolution, to be convinced. The palace was built by the Franco-Tunisian architect Olivier-Clément Cacoub, in three sections over a period spread from 1960 to 1969, according to an Arab-Andalusian architecture. The palace complex covers a total area of 38 to 40 hectares. During Bourguiba's presidency, the palace served him as a residence and a workplace. His family lived in this palace until the coup d'état of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali on 7 November 1987. Ben Ali refused to use the office of his predecessor and had a new one built, as well as another for his spouse Leïla Ben Ali. Carthage Palace from Sidi Bou Said. Zine El Abidine Ben Ali at the \\"Republic Hall\\" of the palace. He only uses the palace as a place of work, launching the construction of another palace to serve as his personal residence, although he sometimes resides in the apartments which he arranges, at the beginning of his presidency, in the private wing of the palace. On 15 January 2011, one day after Ben Ali's flight during the revolution, the army stormed the palace which houses members of the presidential security who remained loyal to the ousted president. Fouad Mebazaa, interim President of the Republic, following the flight of Ben Ali, decides to occupy the presidential offices of Carthage and announces his intention to settle there, as part of his duties. Shortly after his election by the Constituent Assembly, Moncef Marzouki announced to the press his intention to work and reside within the palace itself. He decides to take over Bourguiba's office, installing portraits of Habib Bourguiba, Farhat Hached, Salah Ben Youssef, Mohamed Daghbaji, and Mohamed Bouazizi there. Interior architecture \\"Aboul-Qacem Echebbi Hall\\" during the presidency of Beji Caid Essebsi. The palace shelters rooms which take the name of Tunisian personalities who played a role in the history of the country such as Habib Bourguiba, Abdelaziz Thâalbi, Aboul-Qacem Echebbi and Dido. In addition to the presence of a gallery in the palace belonging to the beys of the Husainid dynasty who ruled Tunisia from 1705 to 1957. The palace also contains several gifts gifted by foreign leaders and valuable items such as the table upon which the Treaty of Bardo was signed on 12 May 1881, which established the French protectorate of Tunisia. President Bourguiba was keen to bring this table to the presidential palace to proceed there and on the same day, on 12 May 1964, the law on agricultural evacuation, which means transferring the ownership of agricultural lands that the French had owned to the Tunisian government. It also contains a hall in which the President of the Republic receives foreign delegations and is called the \\"Republic Hall\\". The palace contains a theater and a private presidential suite with its bedroom, shower room and salon. Habib Bourguiba is the only president who used it. Official receptions take place in the ambassadors' lounge, with delegations settling in the blue lounge, where a model of the Prophet's mosque\` in Medina stands, presented by King Fahd of Saudi Arabia to Ben Ali.

Martin =Martin and Synge= Archer J.P. Martin and Richard L.M. Synge worked together at the Wool Industries Research Association in Leeds. In 1941 they published a paper entitled ‘A New Form of Chromatogram Employing Two Liquid Phases’ in the Biochemical Journal. Martin and Synge described how they had used columns of silica with water, used as the stationary phase, whilst a second, non-miscible liquid, flowed down the column. The second liquid was the organic solvent chloroform, and they separated acetamino-acids from protein hydrolysates. The components of the mixture separated were distributed between the two phases, depending on their relative affinity for each of the phases. As the components spread, they became separated from each other, and could be collected as they left the column. This is how ‘partition chromatography’ came to be known as a new form of chromatography due to the way that the sample ‘partitioned’ itself between the two liquid phases. Their paper was important because it laid the foundations of all the future work in the field of chromatography. In the first part of the paper they presented the first ever theory of chromatography that attempted to explain the concentration of the solute at any point in the column and also how the resolution of the column was affected by various factors including the column's length. Looking at the figures they present for resolution in terms of Height Equivalent to a Theoretical Plate (HETP), underlying the importance of their work at that time. The HETP is a measure of the resolution that can be obtained by the column. There are several factors that affect HETP.

Bogue for sale in Turkey Sex determination in the bogue is unclear. It has variously been described as a rudimentary intersex organism, with a few intersex individuals, or a protogynic intersex, with individuals starting out life as females, and some becoming male later on. The species is commercially fished, with 37,830 tonnes taken in 2008. It is marketed in sizes from Small (1/2, 2/3), Medium (2/4, 3/5, 4/6), Large (4/8, 4/7, 5/7, 5/8). Sizes are not standardized, but the mentioned sizes are often used in commercial transactions. When cleaned and pan fried, broiled or baked fresh, they are good tasting, but when stored their gut flora soon spread unpleasant flavors to their flesh. Much of the catch is used for fishmeal or tuna fishing bait. Parasites The bogue is host to a wide variety of parasites, ranging from metazoans such as monogenean flatworms (e.g. Microcotyle isyebi), acanthocephalan spiny-headed worms, nematode roundworms, isopod and copepod crustaceans and myxozoan cnidarians to the unicellular dinoflagellate Ichthyodinium chabelardi, a parasite lethal to eggs developing in ovaries. At least 67 metazoan parasite species have been reported from the species. In the aftermath of the 2002 Prestige oil spill, the community of parasitic species inhabiting bogue caught off the coast of Spain was noticeably altered.

On 19 January 2011, Elmer was ordered to answer before the Zurich District Court for breach of banking and business secrecy laws as well as a charge of coercion. Elmer was accused several times by bank employees to have harmed \\"by violence and the threat of serious consequences\\" and supposedly a bomb threat against the main building of the bank. In addition, he was tried for 2004 accusations of attempting to blackmail the bank of US$50,000, which did not respond to his offer. The publications on WikiLeaks were not part of the prosecution.Wikileaks-Star kommt vor Zürcher Gericht in: Schweizer Fernsehen vom 12. Januar 2011. The prosecutor demanded a prison term of eight months without parole and a fine of 2,000 Swiss francs.Richter: Elmer ist ein Whistleblower aus Rache In: Tages-Anzeiger. 19. Januar 2011. Elmer was sentenced to probation for a period of two years and fined about 5,600 euros on multiple counts of attempted coercion, threats and breaching of banking secrecy. He also was ordered to pay three-quarters of the court fees in the amount of 5,000 francs (about 3,900 euros).Fall Elmer: Schlappe für Zürcher Staatsanwalt. In: Schweizer Fernsehen vom 17. November 2011. The presiding judge believed that Elmer had not become a whistleblower for ethical reasons, but for personal revenge: \\"You were for many years part of the banking world and have benefited from it.\\" On the same day of his conviction Elmer was arrested on renewed suspicion of violation of Swiss banking secrecy. Elmer had two days earlier handed over two disks with data of suspected bank customers to Julian Assange of WikiLeaks for publication as well as remanded data collection, which was published on WikiLeaks. On 22 January 2011, Elmer was brought into custody on the grounds of urgent suspicion and risk of collusion. Elmer appealed to the Supreme Court of the Canton of Zurich against the detention order. Elmer was summoned on 16 February 2011 before the court and testified that the disks were empty and thus contained no bank customer data. The court found Elmer's presentation as \\"totally unbelievable\\" and rejected the appeal due to the danger of collusion. In July 2011, the remanding was extended until October 2011. On 25 July 2011, Elmer was released from custody.Ex-Banker legt Berufung gegen Urteil ein in: Schweizer Fernsehen vom 20. Januar 2011.Warum Elmer in U-Haft bleibt In: Tages-Anzeiger. 3. März 2011. After he left court he was re-arrested in connection with handing data to WikiLeaks only two days earlier, a move that was described by the prosecutor of the first case as contempt of court. On 25 July 2011, Elmer was set free.Rudolf Elmer ist frei in: Der Sonntag vom 14. August 2011 =Second trial= Elmer alleged that Julius Bär noted activities done in Switzerland as if they were done in the Cayman Islands. On 17 November 2011, an appeal hearing was held at the Supreme Court of the Canton of Zurich. The Court made no judgment and sent the indictment back to the prosecutor and that it must review the investigation and supplement if necessary. As justification, the court stated that besides Elmer and the Bank, no one knew if this data actually existed in reality on the disks. It was difficult to decipher what data was actually on the disks. The judgment depends on whether the data from Swiss customers are from Switzerland, or those of the Cayman Islands, where the Swiss banking secrecy rights could not be applied. Thus, the bank was asked to explain the exact content of the CDs, which it had not done before. If Elmer is correct and dealing with \\"Cayman - data\\" he would be acquitted of charges of bank secrecy violation. Banking secrecy in the Cayman Islands is potentially punishable, although not per se in Switzerland.Kein Schweizer Recht auf den Cayman-Inseln. In: Neue Zürcher Zeitung. 19. November 2011. Furthermore, the court found that there was insufficient evidence that Elmer authored a \\"significant threat\\" against a legal services employee of the bank. In an e-mail from Mauritius, the sender threatened the employee, and claimed he was a killer and recognized him. It was not enough that Elmer had then lived and worked in Mauritius. It must be clarified where the email was sent directly from and who sent it. It is up to the prosecutor to obtain the necessary evidence. Elmer began a protest display outside the bank. While outside the bank he was routinely under surveillance by private detectives. It is alleged that the bank offered Elmer a monetary incentive to end his display.Schlappe für Ankläger im Fall Elmer. In: Tages-Anzeiger. 22. November 2011.Elmer zieht Anzeige gegen Bank Julius Bär zurück. In: NZZ Online. 17. November 2011. In May 2012, the Zurich High Court ruled in an interim decision that three CDs that Elmer is said to have sent to the tax authorities or the business newspaper \\"Cash\\" may be unsealed and evaluated by the prosecution. The bank renounced the possibility of lodging an appeal against this decision.Thomas Knellwolf: Der lange Weg einer Julius-Bär-CD. In: Tages- Anzeiger. 8. Juni 2012. =Supreme Court of Switzerland= The criminal chamber of the Federal Court on 10 October 2018 - after a public hearing before judges (lasting 150 minutes - without the parties present) - by 3 votes to 2 gave a groundbreaking judgment in the case of Rudolf Elmer regarding violation of bank secrecy, and other matters. Most importantly, the charge of violation of Swiss bank secrecy alleged against the well-known whistleblower Elmer brought by the Higher Prosecution Office of the canton of Zurich was rejected by the Federal court and the acquittal of Rudolf Elmer by the High Court of the Canton of Zurich was confirmed. The Federal Court also upheld the complaint by Rudolf Elmer concerning the imposition of an advance payment for the release of confiscated data and documents as well as the modalities for the return of the personal data of the Elmer family. His complaint against the imposition of three-quarters of the costs of the case, including the investigation costs, in the amount of CHF 320,000, and against the penalty for convictions for document forgery and threatening behaviour, were rejected by the Federal court.Baer whistleblower to learn fate in war over cayman data In: Bloomberg. 10. Oktober 2018.A court ruling knocks another hole in swiss banking secrecy In: The Economist. 18. Oktober 2018 Impact The Swiss newspaper Der Sonntag wrote in a December 2010 article that Elmer had confessed to threatening to kill several bank employees. Elmer said: \\"I have certainly made mistakes. My emotions have been out of control.\\" The newspaper also alleged that Elmer had forged several documents, which would damage his credibility as a whistleblower. Also, the bank alleged that erroneous data about customers was given to WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks had to apologize in at least one case to an individual involved. On his computer a letter to the right-wing party NPD in Germany was found, in which Elmer offered the party certain documents. Elmer reported the letter was never sent. Constantin Seibt wrote in the Tages-Anzeiger: \\"Rudolf Elmer is the model case of a whistleblower. He is no angel. Almost all whistleblowers are complex cases. They betray their companies not only from a sense of justice, but also for other reasons, such as wounded pride and grievances. And get caught up in it. The more that the case involves their lives, the more destructive is their struggle: dismissal, years of court cases, divorces, financial ruin - the impact of whistleblowing has similar consequences to a serious crime than a good deed\\".Elmer und die Uiguren Bank of Switzerland. In: Tages-Anzeiger. 22. Januar 2011. In July 2012, the Swiss Press Council received a complaint from Elmer on the weekly magazine World Week (WW).

One third of the council was up for election and the Conservative party stayed in overall control of the council. After the election, the composition of the council was *Conservative 29 *Liberal Democrat 21 *Independent 4 Campaign Before the election the Conservatives ran the council with 28 seats, while the Liberal Democrats had 21 seats and there were 4 independents. The Conservatives had gained a majority after 2 Liberal Democrats defected to the Conservatives in autumn 2003. 16 seats were contested in the election, all from the rural areas of the council. The candidates in the election were 16 Conservatives, 16 Liberal Democrats, 2 independents and 1 candidate from the British National Party. The election was held under all postal voting, for the first time in Harrogate. A significant issue in the election was the future of the Royal Hall in Harrogate. The Conservative administration refused to fund the restoration of the building and said they would consider financing other projects elsewhere in the council area from the money saved. However the Liberal Democrats would have put 2.6 million pounds towards restoring it, as they said future generations would have to spend even more if the council did not take action. Election result The results saw the Conservatives stay in control, with no change in the party composition of the council. The Conservatives gained Lower Nidderdale from the Liberal Democrats, but Conservative cabinet member Brian Lumsden was defeated in Boroughbridge by Liberal Democrat Peter Phillips, in what had been considered a safe seat. The Conservatives won 62.5% of the vote, compared to 34.2% for the Liberal Democrats. As a result, the Conservatives remained on 29 seats, the Liberal Democrats on 21 and 4 independents. Meanwhile, the British National Party came in last in the only seat they contested in Nidd Valley with 131 votes, with Leslie Ellington holding the seat for the Conservatives, after having defected from the Liberal Democrats since the 2003 election. Overall turnout in the election was 55.2%, an increase on the 34.7% in the 2003 election and the 38.7% at the 2002 election.

Description Adult beetles of the genus Megalodacne range in size from , making them among the larger members of the family. Distinguishing characteristics of the genus along with other members of the subfamily Megalodacninae include large eyes and a lack of depressions in the club joint of the antennae. The first three tarsomeres are also cylindrical and of similar shape and size, while the fourth is significantly shorter. Species of the genus Megalodacne very closely resembles members of the genera Episcapha and Episcaphula (some members of which were formerly classified under Megalodacne). They also often look superficially similar to several other beetles since the patterns of the markings of yellow, orange, or red on the elytra (called fascia) of Megalodacne are shared by many other beetle species. An example of which is the sap beetle (Nitidulidae) genus Glischrochilus. Their native ranges sometimes overlap as well, making it easy to confuse the two (as with Megalodacne fasciatus, Megalodacne heros, and the nitulidid Glischrochilus fasciatus from eastern North America). The best way to tell them apart is by size, as sap beetles are generally small, ranging from in length. Glischrochilus reaches a maximum length of only .Glischrochilus obtusus Megalodacne on the other hand are large beetles ranging from . The elytra of the sap beetles which most resemble Megalodacne also do not cover the whole abdomen and leave the last abdominal segment(s) exposed. The elytra of Megalodacne, on the other hand, completely cover the abdomen. Ecology Megalodacne species feed on harder bracket fungi than smaller members of the family. The fungi eaten include Ganoderma and Fomes species. Some tropical nocturnal species of Megalodacne are attracted to light. Life cycle Megalodacne deposit eggs on the fungi on which they feed. Upon hatching, the larvae, like adults, also feed on the fruiting bodies of bracket fungi by burrowing into it... There are two kinds of larvae of Megalodacne depending on the species. In some species, the larvae are elongated and feed on fungi by drilling holes inside of it. In others, the larvae feed alongside adults by gnawing out shallow depressions on the fruiting bodies of fungi. The latter larvae are sluggish, heavily sclerotized, and somewhat flattened. The larval stage takes about 2 to 3 months from egg to pupation. It is not uncommon to see adults feeding along with larvae. Taxonomy and systematics Megalodacne was first described by George Robert Crotch in 1873. The type species is Ips fasciata (now known as Megalodacne fasciata). The genus Megalodacne is classified in the subfamily Megalodacninae, alongside the genera Episcapha and Episcaphula. List of species Species of Megalodacne include: *Megalodacne bellula (Lewis, 1883) – Japan, Korea, & China *Megalodacne chinensis (Crotch, 1876) – China *Megalodacne elongatula (Crotch, 1876) – Southeast Asia *Megalodacne fasciata (Fabricius, 1777) – eastern North America *Megalodacne grandipennis (Fairmaire, 1891) – Tanzania *Megalodacne grandis (Fabricius, 1792) \\\\- Africa *Megalodacne heros (Say, 1823) – eastern North America *Megalodacne immaculata (Chûjô and Kiuchi, 1963) – Japan *Megalodacne marginata (Arrow, 1925) – Assam *Megalodacne promensis (Arrow, 1925) – Burma, China *Megalodacne similima (Crotch, 1876) – Sarawak, Sumatra *Megalodacne varia (Gorham, 1889) – Malaysia References External links Category:Erotylidae Category:Cucujoidea genera ","title":"Megalodacne"},{"id":"30495911","text":"Karen Kraft (born May 3, 1969 in San Mateo, California) is an American rower and two-time Olympic medal winner.

A smooth 2n-dimensional manifold is a quasitoric manifold if it admits a smooth, locally standard action of an n-dimensional torus, with orbit space an n-dimensional simple convex polytope. Quasitoric manifolds were introduced in 1991 by M. Davis and T. Januszkiewicz,M. Davis and T. Januskiewicz, 1991. who called them \\"toric manifolds\\". However, the term \\"quasitoric manifold\\" was eventually adopted to avoid confusion with the class of compact smooth toric varieties, which are known to algebraic geometers as toric manifolds.V. Buchstaber and T. Panov, 2002. Quasitoric manifolds are studied in a variety of contexts in algebraic topology, such as complex cobordism theory, and the other oriented cohomology theories.V. Buchstaber and N. Ray, 2008. Definitions Denote the i-th subcircle of the n-torus T^n by T_i so that T_1 \\\\times \\\\ldots \\\\times T_n = T^n. Then coordinate-wise multiplication of T^n on \\\\mathbb{C}^n is called the standard representation. Given open sets X in M^{2n} and Y in \\\\mathbb{C}^n, that are closed under the action of T^n, a T^{n}-action on M^{2n} is defined to be locally isomorphic to the standard representation if h(tx) = \\\\alpha(t)h(x), for all t in T^n, x in X, where h is a homeomorphism X \\\\rightarrow Y, and \\\\alpha is an automorphism of T^n. Given a simple convex polytope P^n with m facets, a T^n-manifold M^{2n} is a quasitoric manifold over P^n if, # the T^n-action is locally isomorphic to the standard representation, # there is a projection \\\\pi : M^{2n} \\\\rightarrow P^n that maps each l-dimensional orbit to a point in the interior of an l-dimensional face of P^n, for l = 0, ..., n. The definition implies that the fixed points of M^{2n} under the T^n-action are mapped to the vertices of P^n by \\\\pi, while points where the action is free project to the interior of the polytope. The dicharacteristic function A quasitoric manifold can be described in terms of a dicharacteristic function and an associated dicharacteristic matrix. In this setting it is useful to assume that the facets F_1,\\\\dots,F_m of P^n are ordered so that the intersection F_{1} \\\\cap \\\\dots \\\\cap F_{n} is a vertex v of P^{n}, called the initial vertex. A dicharacteristic function is a homomorphism \\\\lambda : T^m \\\\rightarrow T^n, such that if F_{i_1} \\\\cap \\\\dots \\\\cap F_{i_k} is a codimension-k face of P^n, then \\\\lambda is a monomorphism on restriction to the subtorus T_{i_1} \\\\times \\\\dots \\\\times T_{i_k} in T^m. The restriction of λ to the subtorus T_1 \\\\times \\\\ldots \\\\times T_n corresponding to the initial vertex v is an isomorphism, and so \\\\lambda(T_1), \\\\ldots, \\\\lambda(T_n) can be taken to be a basis for the Lie algebra of T^n. The epimorphism of Lie algebras associated to λ may be described as a linear transformation \\\\mathbb{Z}^m \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{Z}^n, represented by the n \\\\times m dicharacteristic matrix \\\\Lambda given by :: \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & \\\\dots & 0 & \\\\lambda_{1, n+1} & \\\\dots & \\\\lambda_{1, m}\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & \\\\dots & 0 & \\\\lambda_{2, n+1} & \\\\dots & \\\\lambda_{2, m}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\dots & 1 & \\\\lambda_{n, n+1} & \\\\dots & \\\\lambda_{n, m} \\\\end{bmatrix}. The ith column of \\\\Lambda is a primitive vector \\\\lambda_i = (\\\\lambda_{1, i}, \\\\dots, \\\\lambda_{n, i}) in \\\\mathbb{Z}^n, called the facet vector. As each facet vector is primitive, whenever the facets F_{i_1} \\\\cap \\\\dots \\\\cap F_{i_n} meet in a vertex, the corresponding columns \\\\lambda_{i_1}, \\\\dots \\\\lambda_{i_n} form a basis of \\\\mathbb{Z}^n, with determinant equal to \\\\pm 1. The isotropy subgroup associated to each facet F_i is described by :: \\\\\\\\{(e^{2\\\\pi i \\\\theta\\\\lambda_{1,i}}, \\\\ldots, e^{2\\\\pi i \\\\theta\\\\lambda_{n,i}}) \\\\in T^n \\\\\\\\}, for some \\\\theta in \\\\mathbb{R}. In their original treatment of quasitoric manifolds, Davis and Januskiewicz introduced the notion of a characteristic function that mapped each facet of the polytope to a vector determining the isotropy subgroup of the facet, but this is only defined up to sign. In more recent studies of quasitoric manifolds, this ambiguity has been removed by the introduction of the dicharacteristic function and its insistence that each circle \\\\lambda(T_i) be oriented, forcing a choice of sign for each vector \\\\lambda_i. The notion of the dicharacteristic function was originally introduced V. Buchstaber and N. RayV. Buchstaber and N. Ray, 2001. to enable the study of quasitoric manifolds in complex cobordism theory. This was further refined by introducing the ordering of the facets of the polytope to define the initial vertex, which eventually leads to the above neat representation of the dicharacteristic matrix \\\\Lambda as (I_n \\\\mid S), where I_n is the identity matrix and S is an n \\\\times (m-n) submatrix.V. Buchstaber, T. Panov and N. Ray, 2007. Relation to the moment-angle complex The kernel K(\\\\lambda) of the dicharacteristic function acts freely on the moment angle complex Z_{P^n}, and so defines a principal K(\\\\lambda)-bundle Z_{P^n} \\\\rightarrow M^{2n} over the resulting quotient space M^{2n}. This quotient space can be viewed as :: T^n \\\\times P^n / \\\\sim, where pairs (t_1, p_1), (t_2, p_2) of T^n \\\\times P^n are identified if and only if p_1 = p_2 and t_1^{-1}t_2 is in the image of \\\\lambda on restriction to the subtorus T_{i_1} \\\\times \\\\dots \\\\times T_{i_k} that corresponds to the unique face F_{i_1} \\\\cap \\\\dots \\\\cap F_{i_k} of P^n containing the point p_1, for some 1 \\\\leq k \\\\leq n. It can be shown that any quasitoric manifold M^{2n} over P^n is equivariently diffeomorphic to a quasitoric manifold of the form of the quotient space above.M. Davis and T. Januskiewicz, 1991, Proposition 1.8. Examples * The n-dimensional complex projective space \\\\mathbb{C}P^n is a quasitoric manifold over the n-simplex \\\\Delta^n. If \\\\Delta^n is embedded in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n+1} so that the origin is the initial vertex, a dicharacteristic function can be chosen so that the associated dicharacteristic matrix is :: \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & \\\\dots & 0 & -1\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & \\\\dots & 0 & -1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\dots & 1 & -1 \\\\end{bmatrix}. The moment angle complex Z_{\\\\Delta^n} is the (2n+1)-sphere S^{2n+1}, the kernel K(\\\\lambda) is the diagonal subgroup \\\\\\\\{(t, \\\\dots, t)\\\\\\\\} < T^{n+1}, so the quotient of Z_{\\\\Delta^n} under the action of K(\\\\lambda) is \\\\mathbb{C}P^n.V. Buchstaber, T. Panov and N. Ray, 2007, Example 3.11. * The Bott manifolds that form the stages in a Bott tower are quasitoric manifolds over n-cubes. The n-cube I^n is embedded in \\\\mathbb{R}^{2n} so that the origin is the initial vertex, and a dicharacteristic function is chosen so that the associated dicharacteristic matrix (I_n \\\\mid S) has S given by :: \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 &0 &\\\\cdots &0 &0 &\\\\cdots &0 &0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -a(1,2) &1 &\\\\cdots &0 &0 &\\\\cdots &0 &0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots &\\\\vdots & &\\\\vdots &\\\\vdots & &\\\\vdots &\\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ -a(1,i) &-a(2,i) &\\\\cdots &-a(i-1,i) &1 &\\\\cdots &0 &0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots &\\\\vdots & &\\\\vdots &\\\\vdots & &\\\\vdots &\\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ -a(1,n) &-a(2,n) &\\\\cdots &-a(i-1,n) &-a(i,n) &\\\\cdots &-a(n-1,n) &1 \\\\end{bmatrix}, for integers a(i,j). The moment angle complex Z_{I^n} is a product of n copies of 3-sphere embedded in \\\\mathbb{C}^{2n}, the kernel K(\\\\lambda) is given by ::\\\\\\\\{(t_1,t_1^{-a(1,2)}t_2,\\\\dots,t_1^{-a(1,i)}\\\\dots t_{i-1}^{-a(i-1,i)}t_i,\\\\dots, t_1^{-a(1,n)}\\\\dots t_{n-1}^{-a(n-1,n)}t_n, t_1^{-1}, \\\\dots, t_n^{-1}) : t_i \\\\in T, 1\\\\leq i\\\\leq n \\\\\\\\} < T^{2n}, so that the quotient of Z_{I^n} under the action of K(\\\\lambda) is the n-th stage of a Bott tower.V. Buchstaber, T. Panov and N. Ray, 2007, Example 3.12. The integer values a(i,j) are the tensor powers of the line bundles whose product is used in the iterated sphere-bundle construction of the Bott tower.Y. Civan and N. Ray, 2005. The cohomology ring of a quasitoric manifold Canonical complex line bundles \\\\rho_i over M^{2n} given by :: Z_{P^n} \\\\times_{K(l)} \\\\mathbb{C}_i \\\\longrightarrow M^{2n}, can be associated with each facet F_i of P^n, for 1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq m, where K(\\\\lambda) acts on \\\\mathbb{C}_i, by the restriction of K(\\\\lambda) to the i-th subcircle of T^m embedded in \\\\mathbb{C}. These bundles are known as the facial bundles associated to the quasitoric manifold. By the definition of M^{2n}, the preimage of a facet \\\\pi^{-1}(F_i) is a 2(n-1)-dimensional quasitoric facial submanifold M_i over F_i, whose isotropy subgroup is the restriction of \\\\lambda on the subcircle T_i of T^m. Restriction of \\\\rho_i to M_i gives the normal 2-plane bundle of the embedding of M_i in M^{2n}. Let x_i in H^2(M^{2n}; \\\\mathbb{Z}) denote the first Chern class of \\\\rho_i. The integral cohomology ring H^*(M^{2n}; \\\\mathbb{Z}) is generated by x_i, for 1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq m, subject to two sets of relations. The first are the relations generated by the Stanley–Reisner ideal of P^n; linear relations determined by the dicharacterstic function comprise the second set: :: x_i = -\\\\lambda_{i, n+1}x_{n+1} - \\\\cdots - \\\\lambda_{i, m}x_m, \\\\mbox{ for } 1\\\\leq i \\\\leq n. Therefore only x_{n+1}, \\\\dots, x_m are required to generate H^*(M^{2n}; \\\\mathbb{Z}) multiplicatively. Comparison with toric manifolds * Any projective toric manifold is a quasitoric manifold, and in some cases non-projective toric manifolds are also quasitoric manifolds. * Not all quasitoric manifolds are toric manifolds. For example, the connected sum \\\\mathbb{C}P^2 \\\\sharp \\\\mathbb{C}P^2 can be constructed as a quasitoric manifold, but it is not a toric manifold.M. Masuda and D. Y. Suh 2007.

It is located west-northwest of Rockville, Indiana. It was closed in 1966. History Rockville Air Force Station was one of twenty-eight stations built as part of the second segment of the Air Defense Command permanent radar network. Prompted by the start of the Korean War, on July 11, 1950, the Secretary of the Air Force asked the Secretary of Defense for approval to expedite construction of the permanent network. Receiving the Defense Secretary's approval on July 21, the Air Force directed the Corps of Engineers to proceed with construction. Opened in 1951, the 782d Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was activated on 16 April. It began operating a pair of AN/FPS-10 radars at Rockville in May 1952, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. In the mid / late 1950s, an AN/CPS-6B search radar was in use, according to one veteran. During 1959 Rockville AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, feeding data to DC-07 at Truax Field, Wisconsin. After joining, the squadron was redesignated as the 782d Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 1 November 1959. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. By 1960 the original radars had been phased out and replaced by two AN/FPS-6 height-finder radars and an AN/FPS-7B search radar. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-53. In addition to the main facility, Rockville operated an AN/FPS-18 Gap Filler site: * Neoga, IL (P-53A) Rockville AFS was closed on 2 June 1966 due to budget reductions; sold to the state of Indiana and is now the Rockville Correctional Facility.

He was one of the co-founders of the Bettina commune. In 1982, Recorded Texas Historic Landmark 1268 was placed on Malakopf Mountain in Boerne, to honor Herff. Herff's homesite in San Antonio was designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in the year 2000, Marker number 12345. Early life Ferdinand Ludwig von Herff was born November 29, 1820, in Darmstadt, Germany to Christian von Herff, Privy Councillor or Judge of the Supreme Court of Hesse- Darmstadt, and his wife Eleanora von Meusebach, a cousin of John O. Meusebach. Education Herff attended the University of Berlin and the University of Bonn, where his uncle Doctor von Rehfuss was the president of the university. Both universities were the alma maters of Karl Marx. A fellow student was Frederick III, future King of Prussia at the Bonn university. The family social circle included naturalist Alexander von Humboldt and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Herff completed his medical education at the University of Giessen in 1843. Upon graduation, he served a surgical internship with the army of Hesse, and learned techniques in plastic surgery and the treatment of tuberculosis. Texas =Bettina= Herff, Gustav Schleicher and Hermann Spiess founded the Socialistic Colony and Society, or Die Vierziger (the Society of Forty), which originally had plans to establish socialistic communes in Wisconsin. Spiess and Herff were approached in Wiesbaden by Adelsverein Vice President and Executive Secretary-Business Director Count Carl Frederick Christian of Castell-Castell, who made a deal with them to colonize two hundred families on the Fisher–Miller Land Grant territory in Texas. In return, they were to receive $12,000 in money, livestock, equipment and provisions for a year. After the first year, the colony was expected to support itself.King (1967) p. 122 In 1846, Herff and Spiess emigrated together to the United States via New York City. From there, they traveled by railroad to Wheeling, West Virginia, and by stage coach to New Orleans. They then boarded a ship to Galveston. Spiess went to New Braunfels, and Herff went to Indianola at the end of April 1847 to await the arrival of the other colony members. John O. Meusebach and Spiess chose the location for Bettina in 1847 on the banks of the Llano River. The commune was named in honor of Bettina von Arnim, an early feminist activist and a personal friend of the Meusebach family.King (1967) p. 121 The majority of the Bettina settlers arrived in August 1847. Beneath an oak tree, Herff removed a cataract from the eye of a local Indian chief.King (1967) p. 120 Jacob Kuechler was one of the notables at the commune. Bettina failed after the Adelsverein funding expired, and due to conflict of structure and authorities. Some members moved to other Adelsverein settlements in Texas. Others moved elsewhere, or returned to Germany. Herff returned to Germany for an additional period of service with the Hesse army, to learn techniques in treating battle casualties. While there, Herff was able to observe the correlation between a surgeon's attention to sanitation, and the low rate of patient infection. =San Antonio= During his sojourn in his home country, Herff married his fiancee Mathilde Klingelhoeffer. Herff and his new wife re-emigrated to Texas. Herff Americanized his name by dropping the \\"von\\", and became a citizen. After a brief period of life in New Braunfels, Herff established a home and a medical practice in San Antonio in 1850. He served as City Alderman 1850–1851. Herff pioneered the use of chloroform as early as 1854. A number of his patients were indigent, but Herff dedicated his career to caring for the patient regardless of financial circumstances. Herff was personal physician to Richard King, founder of the King Ranch. In 1853, he became a charter member of the Texas Medical Association. Herff strived to elevate the standards of medical practice, and was San Antonio health officer in 1860. Like many Germans, Herff was a supporter of the Union in the Civil War; however, he served as Confederate States Army surgeon, treating the patient not the uniform. He helped the Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word establish Santa Rosa Infirmary, San Antonio's first hospital. Personal life and death Herff married Mathilde Klingelhoeffer in 1849. The couple had six children. He spent his vacations with his family, touring Yellowstone National Park and other parts of the United States, as well as journeys to Europe. The Herff family owned 960 acres on two different tracts in Boerne, Texas, which they used as personal retreats. The acreage has now been incorporated into the Cibolo Nature Center and the Kendall County Fair Association. Mrs. and Mrs. Herff were lifelong friends with Texas State Senator James Rodgers Loughridge. Ferdinand Ludwig Herff died in San Antonio on May 18, 1912 and is buried in San Antonio City Cemetery No. 1. In 1982, Recorded Texas Historic Landmark 1268 was placed on Malakopf Mountain in Boerne, to honor Herff.

Built during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, it was demolished in 1937 and the site is now occupied by the Art Deco Rex Cinema. As well as its architectural merit, Egerton House was noted for its occupancy by the Llewelyn Davies family and its literary association with J. M. Barrie, author of Peter Pan. Architecture Egerton House was a two-storey mansion with attics. The front of the house had three gables with two smaller gabled dormer windows in between the gables in the steep tiled roof. When the house was sold at an auction held in the King's Arms Hotel in 1895, it recorded that the property afforded three sitting rooms, a dining room, a billiards room, a conservatory, four bedrooms, four box rooms and stables. The sale also mentioned a coach house on Rectory Lane and Egerton Cottage, a gardener's cottage. The garden was extensive, containing an orchard and stretched as far as the Ashlyns estate. Part of this land was later acquired for the Three Close Lane Cemetery.Hastie, Scott, p.63 History Thomas Egerton (National Portrait Gallery, London). Egerton House was one of two Elizabethan mansions in Berkhamsted, the other being Berkhamsted Place, located approximately north near to Berkhamsted Castle; both mansions were demolished during the 20th Century. The site of Egerton House is thought to have previously been the site of St Clement's Hospital, a medieval hospital. Cobb records that a seal inscribed with the name of the Fraternity of St Clement (later the Worshipful Company of Founders) was discovered in the garden behind Egerton House.Cobb, pp.73-74 No exact date is known for the construction of Egerton House, nor is it known how it acquired its name, although it seems likely that its early owners were members of the Egerton family, possibly Thomas Egerton, whose descendants were later Earls of Bridgewater. It is known that by 1627 the house was the property of Edward Kellet, a local property owner. It was later owned, along with Harriots End Farm, by Rev Dr Robert Brabant who was rector of the Church of St Peter, Great Berkhamsted. Land documents survive which record that a Mr Lyttleton of Egerton House paid eight shillings for the orchard. In 1840, Egerton House was bought for £700 by Wesleyan Methodists who opened it as a preaching house in 1841. The Methodists sold the house in 1846 for the same sum to Dr Thomas Whately who lived there until he died in 1868. The house was auctioned in 1895, and then purchased in 1904 by the Llewellyn Davies family. =The Llewellyn Davies family= Arthur Llewelyn Davies in 1905, with his sons Nico (in arms), Jack, Peter, George, Michael (in front) J. M. Barrie (as Hook) playing with Michael (as Peter Pan) in 1906 London barrister Arthur Llewelyn Davies and his wife Sylvia moved with their five sons in 1904 from Kensington Park Gardens in London to live in Egerton House. By this time, the family had become close friends with the Scottish author and playwright J.M. Barrie, who had based his Peter Pan on stories he had made up for the children while they lived in Kensington (the character of Peter Pan was based on the boys but named after Peter Llewelyn Davies). Barrie's play, Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up, debuted at London's Duke of York's Theatre in the same year. A visiting friend of the family described Egerton House as \\"a beautiful Elizabethan house - huge nurseries & a schoolroom with mullioned windows which occupy the whole length of the rooms - odd-shaped bedrooms with beams & sloping floors\\". Reference was also made to \\"the beautiful Hall with its huge windows & great 16th century chimney piece\\". During their three years in Berkhamsted, Barrie visited the Llewellyn Davies family frequently. Arthur developed cancer and during his illness, Barrie supported the family financially. When Arthur died at Egerton in 1907, Sylvia returned to London with her children; when she herself died of cancer in 1910, Barrie became the children's guardian. =Demolition= The Rex Cinema, as seen in 2011 The Shipman & King cinema circuit took ownership of the Court Cinema on Berkhamsted High Street, and planned to open a second cinema in the town. Originally they intended to build on a site at the eastern end of town on the corner of Swing Gate Lane, but in 1936 S&K; acquired Egerton House, a site closer to the centre of town which had spacious grounds for a cinema and car park. Egerton House was demolished and the Rex Cinema was erected in its place. Some of the interior oak panelling from Egerton House was saved prior to the demolition and was installed in a house called Four Oaks on Graemsdyke Road, and some other panels went into Boxwell House, the office of the Berkhamsted (sic) Rural District Council. The Rex Cinema was designed in a striking Art Deco style architect David Evelyn Nye and opened in 1938 by Viscountess Davidson. In 1953, Peter Llewelyn Davies wrote of a visit to Berkhamsted in a letter, lamenting the loss of his childhood home: The Rex Cinema still stands on the site today and has been listed Grade II by English Heritage. A plaque inside the cinema, unveiled on 14 February 1979 by actress Jane Asher, commemorates the site's association with J.M. Barrie and Peter Pan.

His career began in the 1760s before first- class statistics began to be recorded and his known first-class career spans the 1773 to 1780 seasons. He has often been confused with his namesake who played for Kent at the same time. Although Wood is credited with 23 first- class appearances by CricketArchive, there are only 13 which can definitely be attributed to him. Using the data in Scores and Biographies, there were 12 matches in which a player known only as \\"Wood\\" took part, with Wood of Kent specifically recorded in 10.Haygarth, pp.3–46.CricketArchive – John Wood. Retrieved on 16 January 2011. In addition to confusion about Wood's namesake, there is uncertainty about his forename as he is called Thomas Wood in Scores and Biographies, where he is described as \\"Thomas Wood, a miller, living in Pirbright, Surrey\\".Haygarth, p.4. This is almost certainly incorrect and CricketArchive believes that his name was John Wood. It seems that Scores and Biographies has equated him with Thomas Woods who played as a given man for Chertsey against Dartford in 1761 when John Wood was only 16.Buckley, p.39. The first time a John Wood is mentioned in the sources is when one plays for Caterham against Hambledon in 1769. This was probably the Surrey-based player. In the same season, a player called Wood played for the Duke of Dorset's XI against Wrotham in the minor match that featured John Minshull's century. Given Dorset's strong Kent connection, this was probably John Wood of Kent. Both John Woods are found in 1773 scorecards and are usually differentiated in Scores & Biographies by the Surrey one being called Thomas. Wood of Surrey had a very good season in 1773 and was one of the leading wicket takers that year.Haygarth, pp.6–16.

Maldives. Lonely Planet, 2006. , . Pg 84 All ingredients are finely chopped and mixed with the grated meat of the coconut. This dish is usually eaten with freshly baked roshi flatbread and sweetened hot tea.Xavier Romero-Frias, The Maldive Islanders, A Study of the Popular Culture of an Ancient Ocean Kingdom, Barcelona 1999, Preparation The fish used in mas huni was as a rule Maldive fish but currently many Maldivians use canned tuna. Traditionally when fish was scarce, chopped leaves were added to the mas huni mixture. The green leaves of certain local plants and trees such as digutiyara (Senna occidentalis), kuḷḷafila or gōramfau (Launaea sarmentosa), mābulhā (Abutilon theophrasti), muranga (Moringa oleifera), massāgu (Amaranthus spinosus or Amaranthus viridis) sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) and ḷos (Pisonia grandis), among others, replaced the fish in mas huni in a smaller or greater proportion. Other variant of mas huni is made with muranga pods (Moringa oleifera) instead of thick, lucious leaves. First the pods are boiled, then the flesh with the seeds is scooped out. This is mixed along with the rest of the ingredients. This same type of thicker mas huni can be also made with boiled butternut squash or pumpkin.Himāl Southasian - Eating on the Islands See also *Maldivian cuisine * List of tuna dishes References Bibliography *Xavier Romero-Frias, Eating on the Islands, Himāl Southasian, Vol. 26 no. 2, pages 69–91 External links *Eating on the Islands - As times have changed, so has the Maldives' unique cuisine and culture *Mas huni and Masriha - Himal: Farms, Feasts, Famines; Disappearing foods Category:Maldivian cuisine Category:Tuna dishes Category:Foods containing coconut ","title":"Mas huni"},{"id":"30496061","text":"Fritz Müller (16 April 1926 - 26 July 1980) was a Swiss glaciologist, who carried out research in Switzerland, Greenland, the Canadian Arctic, Antarctica and the Himalayas. Fritz Müller was born 1926 in a little town near Zurich and graduated in 1954 in Geographies and Geology from the University of Zurich. After expeditions to Greenland and Mount Everest, he concentrated his work on cold region hydrology. In 1959 he became the scientific leader of a Canadian expedition to Axel Heiberg Island organised by McGill University, where he became Assistance Professor of Glaciology. In 1970 he changed to ETH Zurich, where he became Head of the Institute of Geography and started the investigation of the North Water Polynya in Baffin Bay. Müller also worked on the glacier inventories of the Swiss Alps and the world. He became director of the World Glacier Monitoring Service. In 1980 Fritz Müller died due to a heart attack during a field excursion for journalists on the Rhône Glacier in Switzerland.
